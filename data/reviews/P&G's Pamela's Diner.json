{"text":"You're not gonna find a much better breakfast in this city ... or anywhere really. Breakfast is breakfast, but they do it right and its delicious every time.

Get the lyonnaise potatoes with your meal. They're delicious. My personal favorite is the Tex Mex omelette. Guacamole at breakfast time never fails.

The boardgames on the walls are cute too. :)"}
{"text":"The hot cakes are delicious! We came here on a Thursday morning and had to wait about 30 minutes but the wait was well worth it. The service was quick and friendly for our group of 8 and the food was very yummy! The hot cakes did not disappoint. We also had the croissant French toast and some different egg dishes that were very good too. This is a great little place for breakfast if you're in the area and don't mind a wait!"}
{"text":"Happy busy yummy breakfast joint.  Good coffee - nice service - bustling clientelle.  Nommy Lyonnaise potatoes.  French bananas on Whole Wheat French toast.

Boardgames all over the wall - just like my kitchen!"}
{"text":"Pamela's was great! The food and service were excellent. I got the Pittsburgh hash and it was delicious. It's a great value too. As many others said, they only take cash so be prepared."}
{"text":"Cash only?!

Pamela's is a classic diner style restaurant. The food is decent and the staff is mostly friendly.

They get one star b/c they only take cash, making this a great place to meet a friend, if that friend is visiting from 1981. Seriously... who carries cash anymore?

There should be a big sign on the door \"cash only\", but instead, they get you in and tell you after your meal. After you have a moment of embarrassment, they direct you to a nearby ATM. So your omelet and coffee now cost $8 + $3 ATM fee + $1.50 fee from your bank.

Maybe the owners don't understand or trust financial institutions enough to get a credit/merchant account. (If so, perhaps they also keep the profits in the freezer instead of a bank account.)

Or maybe the owners are too cheap to pay the $20/mo service fee + 3% transaction fee. I asked the cashier about this, and she said if they took credit/debit, they'd have to raise their prices.

Please, raise the price of my breakfast by 3%... heck I'll even give you 10%. I'd gladly pay $8.80 instead of $8 for my omelet and coffee for the convenience - your prices are low anyway.

Pamela's staff: This policy is hurting you in 2 ways: 
1)  Your are getting lower tips than you would if people paid by credit/debit - customers are more generous when paying with plastic.
2) Cash-only businesses are much more likely targets for robbery and armed robbery."}
{"text":"Three words: YUUUUU UUUUUU MMMY!!!! We went here after reading fellow yelper reviews. Great decision! Other yelpers commented on the possible long wait. We used the No Wait app and it helped. Our server Jordan was awesome (and cute)! 

We ordered the Croissant French Toast, Pamela's famous pancakes, lyonnis potatoes, eggs and bacon. Our bellies are very happy!!! The pancakes are like Swedish pancakes just alot bigger. 

My only criticsm......Offer REAL Maple syrup and honey as options. Even if there's an upcharge."}
{"text":"I came here several times already, I really like it as breakfast or fast meal between classes.
The only thing is they only take cash. So need to make sure have it before come in."}
{"text":"Had a quick breakfast while visiting local colleges. This place is so popular that there was often a line of people waiting, but it seems to move quickly. The pancakes are great."}
{"text":"Small but tasty place for breakfast.  Plan for a wait but service is good and fast.   Also, cash only!  \"The morning after\" is a good choice which is a sample of all breakfast foods."}
{"text":"Pamela's is a dinner. Nothing fancy but down right hearty and delicious.  My wife and I ordered the eggs and corned beef hash and Pamela's famous crepe pancakes.  Both plates were big and filled edge to edge with food.  The eggs and hash were delicious and just as you'd expect: piled high with corned beef and potatoes.  The crepe pancake is a must.  It's quite possibly the best tasting pancake I've had.  The edges get crispy and the middle stays soft.  

Atmosphere is what you would likely expect from a dinner: busy, loud, fun.  Don't be intimidated to ask questions or things that you might need. The staff is super nice.  They're just busy trying to keep the place chugging along.  

BRING CASH if you intend to eat at Pamela's.  They are cash only.  

Plan to spend around $10-12 per person.  You'll leave feeling full and super happy."}
{"text":"My daughter recommended it to us. We had breakfast there on Monday. The food is good. The service is a kind of rough and rushed."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time today with my family since we have heard that it's a Pittsburgh staple. We didn't know what to expect and we knew ahead of time that it's cash only which is no big deal since there's an ATM right around the corner from the restaurant and up and down the street basically.

We didn't wait to long, their waiting room/hostess could be a little more welcoming though.

The space looks crowded and you're a bit overwhelmed when you first walk in but when you sit down you realize that the tables are actually spread apart enough that you don't feel too crowded. Each table has enough distance that you feel comfortable and you can talk with the people at your table.

The waitress was nice and we got our food very quickly.  So the service was fast and attentive.  And the food was delicious! We got the Morning after Breakfast Special and it was so good. We all ate everything off our plates. I would've ordered another side of the Lyonnaise potatoes if I wasn't so full from all the yummy food.

The only beef I have about the restaurant was that the waitress basically put the check on our table without telling us.  We found it under one of our glasses on the table.  She never announced it and also she never showed up at our table after that. And that was right at the beginning of our meal.  My family wanted more coffee and drinks but she never showed up.  

All in all, the food is great, I definitely recommend going there.  But the service could be a little better. I felt like we got there, got our food and then they wanted us out asap."}
{"text":"I couldn't agree with Courtney P. more. Instead or ordering an Omelet here ask for a stick of butter. It will taste the same!

If you do decide to go I would only indulge in crepes. The Oakland location is overrun with Pitt freshman....for a better Pamela's experience hit up the one in Shadyside. And on Sunday get there before 11 or you will never be seated!"}
{"text":"P&G use to cook a quality sausage and bacon..now they use microwave bacon strips and terrible sausage.
They are known for their Crepes however my last few visits my crepes had an awful greasy taste and were not really good. The potatoes are the only thing that hasn't changed and are still sooooo very good.

Please get back to usibg quality ingredients."}
{"text":"In love with P&G's. Fast frood and frelicious scraps. Watch out though for the homeless. They run the place on weekends but not well. I mean not very well anyway."}
{"text":"Your typical breakfast diner in Shadyside to escape the hustle of Pitt campus. Eggs were nicely prepared and the pancakes hit the spot for our college student. A good go to when visiting."}
{"text":"It's true.  The pancakes here are incredible, and like no pancakes I've had before.  I was a little skeptical when I saw the \"crepe\" pancakes on the full menu, so went for the regular hotcakes on the breakfast special menu for only what, like $4? They are just as incredible as all the other reviews have described!  They are soft and moist on the inside yet crispy on the outside ends. So good! I did not have a problem cleaning my plate and they did not even need any syrup. My husband got the banana choc chip which was a lot rich for my taste, so was glad I went with the regulars. Beyond beyond impressed."}
{"text":"Organized wait line and adequate wait time. Fast and friendly service and wonderful breakfast and brunch food! We will be returning!!"}
{"text":"The food here is over the top excessively greasy. So greasy that it made me sick to my stomach before I was done eating my meal. My husband and I split the chocolate chip pancakes and a ham and cheese omelette with potatoes and toast on the side. Not only was everything in a pool of grease, but it seemed to be margarine...not even real butter. I will never eat here again. I am gagging even thinking about this meal let aloe eating it again."}
{"text":"If you love pancakes and crepes, you'll love Pam's special hotcakes. They are thicker than crepes but thin enough to be perfectly griddled on each side. They still have the fluffy texture of pancakes and are just amazing with strawberries!

We came here on a snowing winter morning, and it was perfect for a diner experience. We were seated right away and the service was very attentive and friendly. I'm not a morning person, but Pamela's makes it great."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place because of all the positive reviews.  I love breakfast, and I am a sucker for corned beef hash (I order it pretty much when it's on a menu).  Sadly, I walked away from my meal with a \"meh\" feeling.

First off, I kept hearing about these pancakes I gotta try.  Well, I figured what better way to experience them than to order a short stack, right?  They were super buttery... Too much so.  I loved the thin fluffy texture, and the crispy edges were a unique touch, but those flap jacks were oozing butter (despite not using the included butter \"pat\" that comes with them)... It's all I could taste.  Too bad.  People generally recommended the stuffed pancakes... Perhaps this well teach me not to listen to the suggestions for the banana chocolate chip pancakes (next time).

My real disappointment was that the corned beef hash was probably just a few points above the stuff you can buy at the store.  If it weren't for the large pieces of crispy potatoes, or the sauteed onion... I would have sworn it came from a can.  Plus it was super salty and the meat over-ground... Kinda looked like pet food.  What happened to using chunks of real corned-beef and making the dish look like a hash?

I'm a transplant to pitt and I'm still figuring the place out.  Nevertheless, I'm still looking forward to trying some the other recommended food items... But... If you want really good authentic corned beef hash: Tasty Diner in Silver Spring, MD.  Can't beat it."}
{"text":"Was in Pitt just for the weekend, and if you're a French toast connoisseur/-euse like I am, I'd order it here. Not at all flimsy or soggy, three slices, done just right, impressively simple, just as French toast should be, and would order again for sure. Crowded on a Saturday morning, and even though they said the wait was twenty minutes, we were seated in two, and we were served our food just as unexpectedly quickly. Silver seal of approval :]."}
{"text":"Good diner food, cool ambiance, with the wait of a high profile restaurant that has no organization. You sign up your name and wait among a crowd until you hear your name. Seems to have a high table turnover however since I only waited 25 mins for a table of two. Food was typical American diner, salty and smothered in butter. Good for that once a month cheat day."}
{"text":"Hotcakes are the best I've ever had, and the lyonnaise potatoes are good as well. The strawberry hotcakes are what they're famous for. For 7 bucks you get 2 with a generous amount of strawberries and brown sugar and sour cream. It's busy in the morning but the service is still efficient and great."}
{"text":"I'm giving it a 4 but honestly, I'm somewhere in between a 3 and 4. I think I walked in with high expectations - I wasn't disappointed, but I also wasn't wow'ed. 

This was my first stop in Pittsburgh. Apparently Obama has dined here and this was the place to be. I didn't actually do my own research, just let my friend guide me along. 

The hotcakes are no doubt delicious. They are like huge crepes filled with your choice of fruit pretty much and a ton of whipped cream. We actually shared one banana walnut hotcake and it was plenty. Definitely a great deal. We could've just ordered that and been full. However, we also ordered the corned beef hash. This  was an extremely heavy dish. It was also really salty. It comes with toast too. 

Huge portions, delicious food, great prices. That's definitely where the 4 is coming from. For me, the food was just too heavy and buttery, so much so that I don't know if I would come back.  Personally, I prefer my fluffy, fruity pancakes. With all that said - If you're visiting, it is still worth a stop."}
{"text":"My wife and I were in Pittsburgh in July and a co-worker suggested I try this place while I was there.  Am I glad she did!
The food is delicious, the service is excellent, prices are very reasonable and the atmosphere is fantastic!!  The chorizo, potatoes and pancakes (crepe style) were amazing and the best we've ever had.  Although not in our plans, we decided to delay our departure from Pittsburgh for the express purpose of returning to Pamela's the next day. Well worth it!! My only issue was that I wish I had a bigger appetite and/or more time to be able to sample their other menu items.  Unfortunately I live more than five hours away and I don't know when I'll get back to Pittsburgh - I may have to make a special trip just to have breakfast though!"}
{"text":"Pamela's is a breakfast staple in the Pittsburgh area since 1980. They have about 3 restaurants in the area and you can expect lines especially on the weekends. I remember being at the Shady side location when I was about 12 and looking around at every one's plates. The portions were ginormous!! Even when I went last week the portions were still giant, though I had grown a good bit. I love their staple of amazing homemade pancakes, crepes and other breakfast wonders! 

My plate was about a foot around and piled as you could see. My meal was daunting and exciting. It smelled of warm cinnamon and buttery toasted caramel. Each bite was delicate, creamy, and cooked to perfection. There were moments where I'd get a bit more of the caramel and the sweetness would ting my teeth, that was quickly stopped by the nutty whipped cream and creamy egg base of the toast. 

I will definitely be back! Feel free to check out the rest of my review. Heres my post Pamelas Diner and the best french toast I've ever put in my body. Founding Ms.Lydia : Pamela's Diner!!! http://t.co/MFcI1eAIjF"}
{"text":"A very popular weekend brunch place, with good reason.  The specialty pancakes are incredible, even if mine had so much brown sugar in it that I could literally feel the grains against my teeth.  That isn't a knock or praise, that's just how it is.  If that sounds good to you, you will love Pamela's...if that grosses you out, there's a GNC across the street, go make a protein shake.  

They turn tables fast for a place this busy, and you get a lot of food for your hard earned cash (they only take cash, so hit up the PNC bank on the corner while you wait 20 minutes for a table).

The service is pretty quick since the wait staff doesn't seem to strictly ascribe to seating sections or table divisions the way the British and French carved up the Middle East (and look at all the problems THAT caused).  They also bring you your check with the food and get you off the table fast by making you pay up front.  I have no problems with any of this, Pennsylvanians are known in my home state for their efficiency and lack of skills operating watercraft.  

Every decent U.S. City has a place like Pamela's, even some not-so-decent ones (that's right, I'm talking to you, Montgomery, and you, Little Rock).  Pittsburgh's specialty is the crepe like \"hotcakes\".  They are delicious, with lots of brown sugar (see above), and a faintly salty flavor along with a crispiness on the edges.  I tore that shit apart."}
{"text":"Overall the food was tasty but there are a few areas that can be improved dramatically:

1)  Don't serve microwave instant bacon!  Who does this?  I've never seen a restaurant do this before.
2)  Don't serve out the package tortillas when you have an authentic Mexican stand right next store that makes them!  Work something out with those folks.  I'm sure they would love to have your business and it'll take your chorizo hash to the next level.
3)  Have a host at the front to greet your customers.  Don't leave them standing there for 5 minutes before someone acknowledges them!"}
{"text":"Pamela's is not anything great (heavy and greasy), but I like the blueberry crepe pancakes and the California French toast. I'd only ever been to the Shadyside location and I never had any problems.  
The Oakland location was an entirely different experience. The hostess was plain nasty.  While waiting for a table, another pair was seated ahead of us. I pointed out that we had been waiting longer than they had, and the hostess yelled at me, saying that if I had a problem, I should go elsewhere.  I probably did have an edge to my voice, but this was an insane overreaction.  I asked to speak to her supervisor, who just shrugged.  She clearly didn't care. So we left. Judging by other reviews here, I really don't think Pamela's cares about their customers.  The President ate there, so that's all that matters.  Like I said, the Shadyside location is fine, but I'm not going back there.  If you care so little, what are you doing behind the scenes?

They also count money and then serve food.  That's not hygienic."}
{"text":"If you do one thing in the Strip District, it needs to be eating at Pamela's. When my wife and I first walked up to the restaurant, we were a little shocked at the line. We almost turned away. So I guess this will be one knock on the restaurant. There's not enough of it to accommodate the number of people who want to eat there! Luckily for us, a local across the street convinced us to wait it out. So we did. And boy were we happy we did!

Once inside, you'll have a fun time looking at all of the old pictures. If you need more reinforcement regarding the quality of food, just know that some pretty important people have eaten there! I ordered the Famous Hotcakes with ham and eggs on the side. My wife ordered the Chorizo Hash and Eggs. Both meals were absolutely amazing. If you get nothing else at this restaurant, try the hotcakes. They are to die for. I had plain hotcakes (which suited me just fine!) but I saw a lot of delicious-looking variety around me, so pick what strikes your fancy. The chorizo and hash was so unique and wonderfully flavored, with plenty of food on the plate to share. 

The staff were extremely friendly (despite the chaotic and crazy atmosphere with so many folks waiting in line) and took the time to give us recommendations, even though they were very busy. We can't wait to visit Pittsburgh again just so we can come back to Pamela's and try different dishes!"}
{"text":"My wife and I visited Pittsburgh for a weekend from Philadelphia this Diner was amazing the food was great would definitely recommend it to anyone going to Pittsburgh for the first time, the line was out the door if that's any indication of how good all the food was."}
{"text":"Disgustingly amazing breakfast as usual. Order what you want and accept you are done for the day!"}
{"text":"Food is always great.  Crepes and pancakes are excellent. Chorizo is interesting. Service on point. A little annoying that they don't take credit cards. At least have a ATM."}
{"text":"Cash only!  Wait time for this location is almost not worth it.  The potatoes are really good and the western omelet was above to at average."}
{"text":"We liked everything except the bacon. Another waiter recommended the ham for next time. If you like potatoes be sure to ask for extra crispy. The crepes were great come in a stack of three. I'd suggest getting one or two only. The fresh strawberry were great even though out of season. Definitely will eat here again."}
{"text":"Not deserving of the rave reviews. Breakfast is cheap, and definitely very poor quality. Grease is the common theme in food, and though it might taste OK a first, your digestive tract may say otherwise later. 

The space was cramped, we sat almost elbow to elbow with other guests, with my back a foot from a brick wall. The waitresses were extremely fast, except for coffee refills. Almost felt rushed because the bill came so quick; probably had something to do with the busy line in the waiting room. And why, in this day and age, are you cash-only, Pamela?"}
{"text":"The hotcakes are *delicious*.  I had a strawberry filling in mine.  It was really sweet, and the brown sugar in the filling might have been somewhat excessive, but it was a really nice treat.
If you live in Pittsburgh, I *highly* recommend you try Pamela's.  I know I'll be going back when I can."}
{"text":"Pamela's is an East End institution.  Let's face it: if you've grown up, went to school or currently live in the area, you've probably spent a Sunday devoring forkfuls of Pamela's unique and delicious brand of pancake.  They are thin, crepe-like a little on the greasy side (in a good way). Quick service make up for the long lines.  Weekend specials are a must have.  My favorite is  the chocolate chip banana pancakes.  There is no place like Pamela's, anywhere."}
{"text":"I had a few friends that recommended Pamela's to me and I was not disappointed. I really love the hotcakes. I ended up getting their special: apple caramel and walnut. My favorite part is the crispiness on the edges. The service was also great and everyone was very friendly."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast.  It was great diner food, coffee, and bacon.   The \"hotcakes\" were delicious.  A combination of crepes and pancakes. The strip location is lots of fun.  And yes we did wait for 20 minutes  -- but we got there at 10:00am on a Sunday.   I hear there is always a wait.  Fun, classic diner with great food.  BUT DON'T BE SURPRISED BY CASH ONLY"}
{"text":"The absolute best pancakes and potatoes I have ever had in my entire life. AMAZING!!!"}
{"text":"We stopped through Pittsburgh as we usually do on our way home from Michigan, and that means breakfast at P&G's followed by a trip to Presto George. The food is always good at P&G's, but I am deducting two stars for the atrocious service we got on our last visit. It was our first time dining there on a slow day - the Wednesday morning after New Year's, and there were only five occupied tables in the whole restaurant. We sat right in the middle of the room, yet were utterly ignored for almost ten minutes, and another couple that sat well after us was visited first. Then the server screwed up my girlfriend's crepe order, and the replacement was wrong also. I know that the restaurant practically prints money because it's such an institution, but it says a lot about a restaurant when they mail it in this badly on a slow day. There are a lot of other options in the Strip District; maybe we should go elsewhere next time."}
{"text":"Great pancakes and French toast! Very friendly service and love the board games,"}
{"text":"I'm usually not one to write an awful review but this was definitely not all that the reviews were cracking it up to be. I was visiting Pittsburgh to see my father who just moved there and had to convince him to go because the reviews seemed to be phenomenal and he was more interested in eating crepes.

When we arrived at the shadyside location, the waiting area was packed. To my surprise, we had a table within minutes. The waiter was there to take our order as soon as we sat down and we received our food in under ten minutes. I was amazed! If you're solely interested in fast service, then this is the place for you.

Otherwise, I'm still lost as to why this place is any better than any other breakfast place. The coffee was bitter and tasted like it had been sitting for awhile (mind you, it was 10am). I ordered the strawberry hotcakes which looked delicious but it was literally two thin pancakes with cold, sliced strawberries inside, a super sweet glaze and very little sour cream inside. As for the vegetarian omelet - the veggies inside were also cold and undercooked and the surrounding egg omelet was not seasoned. I could have made this myself even better. The potatoes, however, were probably my favorite part. 

In a nutshell: Very basic breakfast  & nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place... but was disappointed.  

Pro's:
*probably one of the better diners in Pittsburgh, but not of national quality
*great industrial diner atmosphere.  Busy and feels local.
*cheap (plates are ~7).

Room of improvement
*staff friendliness seems hit or miss on busy days
*few authentic ingredients (ie fake butter, fake maple syrup)
*over use of salt (corned beef hash)
*over medium eggs came out over easy
*no apparent effort to support local farms or sustainable food system.

It could be great, and hopefully will be soon."}
{"text":"Strawberry pancakes are the best and the corned beef hash cannot be duplicated. So delicious, every thing was beyond yummy."}
{"text":"Super good! Great breakfast food, especially for the price. Super cute diner, love it, and highly recommend it if you're looking for a solid breakfast spot. FYI, the place is cash only!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast. Listen to the people and order the pancake/crepes. We got blueberries on one and bananas/walnuts on the other. Wow. No syrup needed. It was great."}
{"text":"Incredibly fast service, and amazing food. I would highly recommend the tex mex omlette! Go in small groups so you can be sat in little to no time!"}
{"text":"I am not a pancake person and I absolutely adore their pancakes. Their other food is just as good if not better. Pamela's is a true gem. Breakfast is easy to make, but hard to do right. They exceed my expectations almost every time."}
{"text":"We heard about Pamela's and decided to go the morning we were heading back home. The hotcakes are massive! I could have split them with my husband! Everything else I tried (bacon, potatoes, coffee) was just blah. But the hotcakes were yummy! Can't say I would go back. The prices were good but you get what you pay for... No cleanliness and rude staff."}
{"text":"Pamela's is a classic diner in the Strip district complete with old timey photos on the walls. You seat yourself upon walking in and right away a staff member came over to make sure that our drink order was taken. Our food came out SUPER FAST!

I had the corned beef and cheese omelet. The omelet was OK, but the real star was their lyonnaise potatoes. I could have eaten an entire plate of those! 

Be ready -- it's cash only (but inexpensive!)"}
{"text":"Pamela's is a Pittsburgh institution. The food is cheap, plentiful and definitely not for dieters, but delicious for that very reason.  My biggest quandary is whether to get the Strawberry Pancakes or the eggs with their unbelievable home fries.  

It does get very busy, especially on weekends, and every location is cash only, so be aware of that.  But I'd be hard-pressed to find a breakfast place anywhere that can match Pamela's."}
{"text":"Love Pamela's - go there every time we go to visit my son in Pittsburgh. They have the best potatoes (lyonnaise) - Home fries with onions and the crepe pancakes are like nothing I've ever tasted anywhere else. Gets crowded since it's in Oakland - the college hub, but well worth it. They keep things moving pretty quickly they -only take cash but I believe there is an ATM inside. You also Can use the \"no wait\" app to get your place \"in line\" - it will keep you up to date on how many Parties are ahead of you so you can time your arrival and not wait to long.  Food reminds me of a mom and pop type place"}
{"text":"Stopped by for breakfast before we left Pittsburgh.   The service was horrible, the food was served quickly but not all that memorable.    Looks like we'll be sticking with DeLucas' for breakfast next time we are back in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Ok, I finally get it. After being in Pittsburgh now for over 2 years and hearing all of the hype about this place, I finally tried it out. Delicious!

After reading the menu and seeing the strawberry hotcakes, I decided to order that. I was a little apprehensive because it seemed like it was their version of a crepe, and it had strawberries, brown sugar and sour cream on the inside. Sour cream?...sounded a little weird to me. But I thought, oh what the hell. 

So it came out with whipped bream on top and after I took my first bite, it all made sense to me. It was delicious! The strawberries were super fresh too. Surprisingly, it wasn't too sweet either. I also got a side of bacon and home fries. It tasted like some good home cooking; the home fries reminded me of some of the best southern cooking I have had. My fiance ordered a waffle, and was far from disappointed as well.

The service from our waiter was great as well. He was very gracious and welcoming, regardless that he was obviously very busy. As far as environment, I wouldn't go here if you're looking for a relaxing one. It gets quite loud and you are sitting inches away from the next table.But if you don't mind that and you're looking for some good home-style cooking, especially a good stick-to-your ribs breakfast, this place is perfect for that."}
{"text":"Ordered omelette with hash browns and toast. Great coffee. Delicious hash browns. Service is good not great. Peppers in my omelette were definitely frozen peppers. Breakfast is a simple meal which is why I believe each ingredient is so important. The tomatoes were fresh. Deluca's down the street way better eggs. The Atmosphere at Pamela's is better."}
{"text":"Best corned beef hash I ever had. I don't even live in Pittsburgh, but I've had their cbh three times when I visit on business. I am not a pancake fan, but their thin crepe pancakes are unreal. Soft and mushy in the center, and crispy on the outside."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for Pamela's. We got there early and were the first ones in the door at 7 am, so obviously the service was very quick. Unfortunately, the crepe style pancakes were underwhelming. Very greasy and sort of just tasted...burnt I guess? I'd go back to try it again, but the line is always out the door and there are just too many other great breakfast options."}
{"text":"Recently took a friend to Pamela's, after hearing about their great, thin pancakes....we loved it and have been back twice since! Service is pretty quick and friendly. The place is popular, so expect to wait on the weekends."}
{"text":"Neat local spot.  They typically have a line buy it moves fast.  Quick food, friendly service but they occasionally disappear after you receive your food.  Food is great I take friends here every time they visit from out of town.  Strip district location has a much faster line than Shadyside (more seating)."}
{"text":"The kitchen staff is very irritating because I had to make a couple trips back inside to have my take -out to be right. Very unprofessional and horrid."}
{"text":"Oh my lord!!! If Pamela's had existed (in any of its Pittsburgh incarnations: Shadyside, Squirrel Hill, Oakland, Millvale, the Strip, and most recently Mt. Lebanon), I  NEVER, EVER woulda left my hometown...I mean, what would that unturndownable job offer from my company's headquarters in CT have meant when I could have remained a homie downing pancakes or omelets or tasty lunch items (ah, but when you do get lunch at Pamela's, however wonderful, I guarantee you that you'll eye the pancakes of other diners that if said diners snapped you with their cell cameras, you'd be ridiculed on You Tube within minutes---cast in the unenviable role as gluttonness (gluttoness?)!!!

I've stood in line at Pamela's, I've turned in my name with my \"party\" and gone off to fetch coffee a few doors down to pretend for awhile that I wasn't starving, yet the past few times I had the pleasure of sitting down (\"Please seat yourself\"--that is what the sign read) immediately.  What a luxury!  Of course, the most recent of these times  (four of them, not that I counted--on two different trips: May, 2008, and July, 2008) occurred between 11 a.m. and 1 p.m. on weekdays.

Okay: two more things.  1) Pamela's cash register displays a sign: Cash Only...so don't try to give 'em a check, debit or credit card.  Have some $$ ready...

2) Craig B.,  I must ask: what are \"honks of butter\"?"}
{"text":"Definitely a must.  We take all of our visitors here and they LOVE it.  Their specialty hotcakes are amazing."}
{"text":"Best hotcakes in Pittsburgh! Super friendly atmosphere and always a great place for a quick lunch. Very casual. Only bummer is that they are cash only."}
{"text":"I was in the mood for breakfast but it was the lunch hour - what better place to go than Pamela's? I had the the Tex-Mex Omelette, which came with potatoes and toast. The food was good so was the service. The restaurant isn't fancy but it is popular.  Good food at a great price. One thing you should know it's CASH ONLY!"}
{"text":"Sought out Pamela's on the recommendation of a Pittsburgh resident. My wife and I enjoyed our meals thoroughly, and everything was as we expected for a diner. 

The hotcakes are unique, and were delicious with or without syrup -- especially the crispy bits on the edges. The lyonnaise potatoes (recommended to us) were also good.

The service was brief, but more than adequate. 

Recommended!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Hubby had \"The Morning After\" and I had the \"Corned Beef Hash & Eggs.\" We ordered extra lyonnaisse potatoes and we were totally stuffed! Friendly staff. Definitely a must when in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"I was visiting a friend in Pittsburgh and we decided to go to Pamela's on a Saturday morning for breakfast with her two year-old in tow.  I liked the overall atmosphere of the place--lots of people, good food, bright indoor space, and nicely air-conditioned.

The food was very good, but very rich. The strawberry crepe/pancakes were delicious- if you don't mind lots of butter/oil (you can tell they've been fried in a lot of oil because they are crispy and very tasty). We ordered the crepes, the french toast and the scrambled eggs with scallion & cream cheese.  They Lyonnaise potatoes were excellent (and again, probably not so good for you).  Big portions and very reasonable prices makes for a busy diner.  A few things that could be improved: 1) their OJ is out of a machine-- doesn't taste sweet/fresh..reminds me of Donald Duck OJ.  2) We asked if we could order food for my friend's 2-year-old first as he needed to eat-- our waitress acted  a bit annoyed and confused (not a very difficult concept)..and of course, that specific order came out 10 minutes AFTER what we ordered! (I'm assuming there was confusion in the kitchen-- they were apologetic and nice about getting us the order quickly after realizing the error). 

Overall, the waitstaff was very friendly, and we were seated very quickly (even though the place was crowded).. And-- we didn't realize it was cash only, and neither of us had cash on us, so they were nice enough to let us hold our tab until we came back to pay for it."}
{"text":"Was in town for U Pitt open house for weekend and Stopped in due to overall positive Yelp reviews.  

Everything was very tasty.  I had the \"Morning After\" with the banana walnut crepe pancakes.  Cooked perfectly and nice portion size.   Coffee was good as well.  It did not seem like the average \"diner\" coffee.    

Got here around 830 am on Sunday and had no wait.  I'd definitely come again."}
{"text":"It's an institution for a reason. It's a fun place with delicious food. Don't let the line scare you, it's a big place, they are quick. Just walk in and put your name down next to the cashier

Two note - don't come here right after church, there's a big church across the street, and guess where they go after it ends? Bring cash, they are an all cash resturant."}
{"text":"Service was incredible. I ordered the hotcakes with strawberries that they're known for, and a side of the lyonnaise potatoes to try them. Those potatoes are delicious. The hotcakes are very good as well. Give them a try!"}
{"text":"Wow,
Took my family to Pamela's the day we dropped my son at Pitt for his freshman year. He said he wasn't hungry but ended up finishing the Morning After special. I can't really criticize though, because so did I. Every item was perfect. Eggs over were cooked properly and the home fried potatoes were spot on. Surprisingly the pancakes were still delicious even though I saved them for last and was pretty full already.
Best breakfast out that I have had in some time. I will definitely be back.
I read a number of reviews and truly don't get all the three's. 
By the way, service was friendly and attentive even during the morning rush. I love that they only accept cash or the school's panther money."}
{"text":"If I could give this place a 3.5 stars, I would. It was good, but not great, and the wait was really too long. 
This place really suffered from the high expectations of the 20 minute wait and the around the block line were simply not met. 
I had the corned beef hash, and it was actually pretty good, but far to greasy, and it didn't need to be. I also got eggs, sunny side up, which I suggest, not just because they were good, but to avoid the awful looking scrambled alternative. 
All in all, not bad, but the hype is probably undeserved."}
{"text":"Cash only.

The 'famous' corn beef hash was not great- and heavily salted.  

Eggs were good.

Not great food / not a lot of bang for the buck / 3.0 from me"}
{"text":"One of the best breakfast places I've been to.   The chorizo patties are fabulous!

Highly recommend you stop in for a bite.   First time here and I'll be back when I'm in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"One word. PANCAKES!!!!!!!! Theses hot cake are simply awesome. The service is great and they were very nice. If you are at a pirates, steelers, or pens game come and eat here."}
{"text":"First impressions are everything. When entering the hostess were so rude. Not friendly and welcoming at all. I asked her for a table for two and she just handed me a pen and looked away. To busy socializing with her co-worker. I had to ask her to figure out wait time and she just rolled her eyes after saying 49 minutes. Very long wait. I was expecting that but not the rude service. Maybe a bad day or just a bad employee. Train your people! Visit Saturday 6/13/15 12:10pm"}
{"text":"Best pancakes in the burgh! I've spent some time in presbyopia hospital and I often send my family down to Pamela to get some breakfast instead of the bland junk they pass off as food at the hospital. Even the take-out being walked from the restaurant to my room in the freezing cold doesn't phase the awesome flavor packed into these pancakes!! The home fries are also another favorite. If you haven't tried Pamela for breakfast, you definitely need to give it a go!"}
{"text":"Taken to Pamela's with hosts that lived in Pittsburgh.  We ordered the blueberry hot cakes and wow, they were delicious.  Only reason for 4 instead of 5 stars is the fact that it is difficult to make something that isn't good with all the butter and sugar used... but kudos to them for creating the legendary concoction.  I liked the 50's style diner feel and wasn't disappointed a bit."}
{"text":"I was so looking forward to going for breakfast at Pamela's Diner at the Strip District. It was almost noon time and although the place was not full, there were people dining at several tables. I had just ordered the hotcakes and sausage when an extremely shrill beeping sound went off and intermittently continued going off for several minutes. I was told it was a building safety drill check. I know these are necessary but not during business hours when people are there paying for a meal and are expecting good service. I practically swallowed my meal whole to get out of there. I can't imagine anyone enjoying their meal at all. Noone in there should have had to endure that."}
{"text":"This is one of the best pulled pork sandwich, I have had. I was just in Texas, and this was better .
Side of breakfast potatoes. .I dare you not to finish. 
Serve was outstanding. 
A Pittsburgh treasure. 
Enjoy! !##"}
{"text":"This is my go to breakfast spot! Great strawberry hot cakes and huge portions for the price. A perfect morning treat and it never takes too long. Only thing, watch out for peak time lines!"}
{"text":"Fantastic!  I know this sounds silly. .. but its the first time in a long time that I actually got my eggs made the way I asked. Who knew over easy was so hard to do. Everything was great and big! Staff is awesome especially at 78 years young! !"}
{"text":"This is my go-to spot for breakfast in Pittsburgh! I love how it is in campus and very close to my school. I always order their strawberry hotcake with no wip as I am very self-conscious about my sugar intake.

I have been here many times with friends and they usually like what they get. Last time I have been here the waitress gave us the wrong change and when we asked her for the right change she was offended like if we are lying to her. I was upset because some one else (another waitress or staff) was staring at us like if we did something wrong and it was humiliating :( especially that I am the one who suggested Pamela's for my sister who were visiting Pittsburgh for the first time.  

I have not been there since then but I really love Pamela's so I hope the management  train the employees better on how to handle these situations"}
{"text":"I have to admit, I was starving and a little hungover when I came here. We didnt have to wait too long for a table (but I heard that is not common) and the food came out really quickly - so I was very happy! Definitely get the pancakes. They were by far the best. Portion sizes are generous and prices are reasonable. But- thry are cash only, so be prepared!!!!  Great place for brunch. I highly recommend checking it out."}
{"text":"Midmorning on a Sunday, we had to wait about fifteen minutes for a table for 5. The kids had pancakes and waffles. The teenager nearly passed out from happiness over the chocolate chip waffle. The three year old had to closely protect his pancake because his mother and I kept stealing bites whenever he let his guard down. I had a chorizo hash special. It wasn't spicy, but neither was it underspiced and I enjoyed it to the last bite.

It wasn't diner prices, but I felt like it was fair.

While we waited, we stood over vent outside Prantl's to stay warm and enjoy the bakery aroma."}
{"text":"Our go to Diner! The food is amazing, you honestly can't go wrong with anything on the menu. THEY'RE A CASH ONLY ESTABLISHMENT! So make sure you come prepared"}
{"text":"Great food.  No wait but the only take cash and the neighborhood looks like it would be fun at night but not a lot going on at 10am an a Friday."}
{"text":"I was visiting from Miami and decided to try Pamela's. The crepe hotcakes are outstanding. Must try!"}
{"text":"This place has the BEST crêpes I have EVER had. My husband had their Banana Chocolate Crêpes and they were amazing as well. My husband would like to go to another Steelers game but I'm planning the trip just to go to Pamela's to eat again!"}
{"text":"The strawberry pancakes were suburb. Sweet and tasty."}
{"text":"Two words: Potatoes Lyonnaise.  These were to die for, as were the crepe pancakes and chorizo sausage my husband and I shared.  One of my favorite breakfasts in a long time.  Place was packed but the tables flip pretty quickly.  Parking can be a bear, but it is totally worth it to get to this little quirky place for the rockin' food."}
{"text":"My friend had been wanting to go to Pamela's for awhile and we decided to stop by while in the strip district for the day. The wait was 20 minutes which wasn't horrible although considering it was a weekday was a bit shocking to me. The decor was extremely adorable and added to the atmosphere. It was decorated in baby blue and pink with pictures of who I'm assuming is Pamela throughout her childhood. I ordered the Pittsburgh Hash which was hash-browns with sauerkraut, swiss cheese, and kielbasa (although I ordered it without because I'm vegetarian) and it was great. It was a combination I wouldn't have dreamed of but worked well. It came with eggs which were done great as well and toast- thick Italian bread that was cooked perfectly. My friend had the Strawberry Hotcakes were delicious and she loved them. My only problem with the experience was the service. The host who took us to our table was extremely rude and gave our table to someone else immediately after we didn't hear him call our name. Our waitress wasn't rude but she seemed very indifferent and not super friendly but I guess she was waiting on so many tables that's understandable. Overall, I would definitely come here again- the food makes up for the not great service."}
{"text":"Pamela's is the hottest thing in Pittsburgh, and they have lines of an hour long, going out the door, they don't take reservations, But I'm not sure why they have such high ratings. After waiting for an hour to get seated, we were expecting good food, and in reality, everything was drenched in butter. Everything was super greasy, buttery. Even their hotcakes (which are like crepes - love crepes) they look great, but once you taste them, it's all butter. Our party also tried the French toast and hash browns and those were super greasy too and didn't taste good at all. The reason it's so busy is because it's the only show in town. There are a few of them and there's really nowhere else to go. It's sad. Being from NJ and having many diners that compete with each other, there are some good tasting Diners making good French toast, crepes and hash browns. This was just a joke and DEFINITELY NOT WORTH THE WAIT. The service on the other hand, was very good and workers were very nice and helpful."}
{"text":"Great little spot we found on Yelp, and right down from our hotel! The chorizo was yummy, the fruit bowl was fresh and delicious, and the atmosphere was fun!"}
{"text":"On my recent visit to the 'Burgh, I knew I had to see what all the hub-bub about Pamela's P & G Diner was. When I arrived, I had a short 10 minute wait for a table and got served the famous hotcakes shortly after being seated. They are amazing! The hotcakes are extremely thin and crispy on the edges. I thought I knew a good breakfast before but Pamela showed me a different world through her addictive, fluffy hotcakes. The workers were very friendly and efficient. This is a must when visiting Pitt. You won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure what all the fuss is about. This is a sub standard diner at best. I will say that our food arrive quickly but after tasting it I really think the cook could have taken a few more minutes to make it palatable. I had Gail's Favorite Eggs...which we're definitely not my favorite. A very meager portion of scrambled eggs with 2 hunks of cream cheese thrown on top and sprinkled with scallions. I wasn't sure what the purpose of  the cream cheese was as it neither was incorporated into the eggs or did it melt on top. The toast was barely \"toast\" and was limp and kind of soggy. The 'famous\" Lyonnaise potatoes weren't anything special....just run of the mill mushy diner potatoes. Not crispy or flavorful at all. My two daughters had the Tex-Mex omlet which was unremarkable save for the chorizo. Again, soggy toast. my daughters boyfriend had the corned beef hash which he said was fairly good but he felt that he only got about 1 egg scrambled with it. The only breakfast we all thought was good was my son's strawberry hotcakes. They were sweet and light, much like Swedish pancakes. I honestly can't say this place was worth the money. A bit pricey for average diner fare, We arrived well before 11am so we really didn't wait more than a couple of minutes but I'm told the wait turns long after then. We won't be back."}
{"text":"If I could give it -1 star I would. Seriously Pamela or whoever owns this place?? This may be one of the dirtiest establishments I've ever eaten at. It's disgusting... They haven't clean the lamp shades in who knows how long. Dust WEBS are literally visible from the shades all the way up to the ceiling where the light hangs from... It was also awesome to bring my gf here talking up the food and it comes out cold. I couldn't even send the food back because the service was non-existent. Seriously I don't know how this place isn't shut down for how gross it is. There are way better options in the city and highly recommend avoiding this place."}
{"text":"Pamela's has been well covered by other Yelpers so I'll keep my review brief. 

This place hits all of the right classic diner notes and then some: it's comfortable, friendly, full of locals, and awash in vintage Pittsburgh centric Americana but most importantly, the food is awesome.  Well, I should qualify that, I can at least say  the pancakes are awesome, because that's all that I tried and frankly that's all I need to try as I have a deep abiding love for all types of fried breakfast cakes and can rarely resist the urge to order them when dining out in the morning (and as a side note I am frankly waiting for the hipster restaurateur set to open a place where I can have a late-night short stack in my neck of the woods).

The pancakes, or hotcakes as they are called, are basically large crispy-edged crepes that are fried in what must be a mountain of butter. You can order straight-ahead versions of the hotcakes or signature ones that come stuffed with things like banana and chocolate, or fruit and sour cream. My wife and I got two orders of the hotcakes: one plain and one with strawberries and sour cream inside and I have to say that despite how strange the latter one sounds it was delicious, and perhaps more importantly, the sour cream counters the sweetness of the dish which means that you don't hit \"the wall\" so early on with them, which if you are in a gluttonous kind of mood is a good thing.

The best part is that everything is entirely reasonable - the pancakes are like $6-$8 and are enough food to allow you to skip lunch. 

Go check this place out, and come hungry."}
{"text":"Located on a cute little side street with an old diner feel. Servers and wait staff were friendly and helpful with accommodating specific diet needs. The breakfast was very tasty and served quickly. Very happy with their food options."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times for brunch. It gets really packed around 10 or 11 on weekends (we had a 30 minute wait) so keep that in mind!

The restaurant is a little cramped and it's really loud. The food is pretty good, though. I usually get an omelette with tomatoes and toast, and I leave feeling very full. However, it's not worth the long wait on the weekend."}
{"text":"I've had a lot of pancakes in my life and these were the best ... Lyonnaise potatoes were really good too. Bring cash.. It's a cash only restaurant"}
{"text":"The food was absolutely delicious! The crepe hotcakes are a must try...not too sweet and surprisingly filling. I got the banana and walnut stuffed hotcakes with a side of corned beef hash. The hash was homemade and very tasty. The hotcakes were great! Quick service. This is a cash only place, but well worth the inconvenience."}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful, took my 11 year old cousin to eat and he loved it. We played a trivia game that was on the table. 
The food was great, he had hot cakes and I have the tex mex omelette. Everything was fantastic."}
{"text":"Great diner food and I love the thin pancakes - you can taste the real butter in them, MMMM!"}
{"text":"Definitely a great place to go if you've had a long night of drinking. They even have a special called the \"Morning After Breakfast\". I found the food greasy, and the pancakes, I wish they had a more regular style. But it's a great place to meet up and catch up with friends! It is cash-only, btw."}
{"text":"I cannot say enough good things about this place. It was delicious. Everything. I chose to go small and I'm glad I did because I ate every bite of the short stack and side of chorizo hash. Words cannot describe to taste explosion that was popping on my taste buds! Delectable! I wish we had one where I live..."}
{"text":"I'm from LA and so Disneyland is in my roots. Why does this matter? Because if you share the same addiction for Disneyland's churros, you MUST order the Croissant French Toast here. It's covered in caramel, nuts, cinnamon, sugar, and a decent sprinkle of crack. Just trust me :)

Quick notes:
-Long wait so come early or after the regular breakfast rush.
-Food comes out quick though!
-Cash only
-Park on the street or nearby paid parking lots"}
{"text":"I don't know why I am writing this review because if you are here reading this  review then you are one of the very few that don't know how great Pamela's really is.  First of all the prices are right that is why you can only pay with cash.  Second you need to order only 2 things on the menu either the crepes  or the potatoes they are both awesome.  If you come here on the weekend you better come very early or you wait for a seat.  No problem it is worth a hundred waits.  It all depends also on the time of the year and the weather. I have waited for a seat that seemed like forever and then there has been Saturdays that I walked in and sat right down but to do so you must come.  I remember the last time the Steelers went to the Super Bowl and we ate here the Saturday before they had Steeler music going it was a great time.  They are only open for breakfast and lunch. I can't see them ever needing to be open later ever.  We are from Uniontown and go to the strip often throughout the year.  There has been other restaurants I have been wanting to eat at but can't get past this place.  The way this place is decorated like you are back in time with all the old photos on the wall and things makes you feel right at home."}
{"text":"Decent breakfast and great service. I found the much touted corned beef hash to be too salty but everything else we ordered was great. Overall, I recommend this restaurant for breakfast"}
{"text":"Had brunch early sunday afternoon.  Be aware that they close very early and they only serve breakfast on sundays.  There was no line and we were seated quickly.  It took a while for us to get coffee and utensils and for the waitperson to take our orders, which made me a little nervous.  But I'm telling you, once we did order, the food came out in NO TIME flat.  It was seriously fast.

Eggs were fine, bacon and sausage not very good, but the crepe-like pancakes were fabulous.  Worth the trip just for those."}
{"text":"Pamela's claims since 1980 they've been serving the best breakfast in Pittsburgh. I would have to agree... I love love love this place. There's something about this place that is a mix of greasy diner and delicious spot on breakfast that's hard to match. My parents always make me take them there when they come into town. The morning after breakfast special with special strawberry hot cakes really can't be beaten. It's a lot of food (almost too much food) and those hot cakes with the brown sugar and sour cream. The edges are perfectly crispy and they're more like a crepe/pancake baby. Don't plan on eating lunch folks. I've also had the corn beef hash which is delicious as well as the French toast croissant and the Tex-mex omelet. All worth having a second and third time. Word to the wise, they don't accept credit cards so make sure you bring cash. And be prepared to wait if you don't get there when they first open, I promise it's worth it though. The only problem about this place is that you don't know what to order because everything is so stellar."}
{"text":"If God ate breakfast, this is where he would go! The only thing you should order if this is your first time is the Strawberry Hotcakes! Be prepared to go into diabetic shock and a food coma immediately after wards! Good stuff!"}
{"text":"Dear Pamela,

Thank you for providing a top notch breakfast and for serving the best potatoes in existence. This is not an exaggeration.  Your potatoes are creamy, flavorful and perfectly salted with the right amount of butter and perfectly cooked.

I enjoyed your Banana Chocolate Chip Hotcakes for my breakfast entree and I enjoyed them. They are unique in that the cake is thin, light and fluffy and with crispy edges. This is a different pancake experience and I rather enjoyed it!  

Your atmosphere is fun and nostalgic and you do not offer a credit card option, which I understand and I'm glad that you give plenty of warning with your many signs.  Your T-Shirts are funny and for purchase and I like that too!

I hope that you continue to do well and I want the recipe for your potatoes! Until next time. Thank you for a great morning and I hope to visit again!

From a breakfast potato lover,

***Breakfast Breakdown***
The food: The hotcakes were pretty good. I prefer a thicker pancake but if you're looking for something different give them a shot! Definitely steal someone's potatoes if you get the hotcakes.
The value:  $7ish for hotcakes? Not too shabby since you get a lot of food!
The experience: Fun! I liked it!
Would I return?: Yes and I'd get an omelet next time.
4 stars?: The hotcakes didn't completely wow me, but damn are those some mighty delicious potatoes! Bring it on!"}
{"text":"Your classic \"serving breakfast all-day\" diner doesn't get much better than Pamela's. I think I have been to three different locations and the terrific-ness is consistant across the board. I highly recommend the broccoli cheese omelette or the starwberry pancakes. If you get the french toast, or anything that could potentially be sugary...beware because they will drench it with a sugary topping or syrup. If I had known I would have asked for my topping on the side. Make sure to order coffee, ice water and some other drink to go with whatever you order and you will have the works!

Oh, and I think all of the locations are cash only."}
{"text":"Pamela's saved us after we were turned away from the S&D Polish Deli down the street for not being Polish enough (we may have fled after being stared at uncomfortably by three strange women).

Wandering gypsies without a home, we found Pamela's a few blocks up and they welcomed us. This Cash Only (of course) diner in the amazing Strip District is freaking adorable with portraits, news articles and art all over the walls. It screams kitsch, and being of the tacky variety of human I immediately felt comfortable here. 

I was really craving something fattening, like a milkshake, but Pamela's saved me from myself by being one of those rare diners that doesn't offer milkshakes. Fine. I ordered the hamburger, and indeed it tasted like a hamburger. The fries were definitely made out of potatoes. Our silverware was clean. The place didn't smell like vomit, and that speaks volumes when it comes to diners. The guy running the place gave us advice about Pittsburgh, useful bits such as \"Yeah, this town is dead by 6 pm.\" Good to know.

Pamela's was by the far the most welcoming place we encountered in this area (S&D and Penn Avenue Fish both being just outright rude), and for that they earn a place in this Southern girl's heart."}
{"text":"Really wanted a great breakfast including a great cup of coffee. Got a limp, bland omelet with steamed broccoli and clots of cheap chaddar. Im pretty sure it was flozen broccoli and bagged pre-shredded cheese. And, most sadly, the cup of coffee was weak.  My food was cold within 5 minutes of arrival thanks to the overdone air conditioning. My husband and I had to raise our voices to speak over the music... very loud in there. Sigh. Not keeping with the the 4 star yelp review that brought us here."}
{"text":"Pamela's is a Pittsburgh tradition. You MUST go when you are in town. I have been coming for years and bringing all my friends as often as possible. If you are looking for high-brow, look elsewhere; this diner has the quintessential BGB (big greasy breakfast); hot cakes, bacon, hash browns, french toast... they do have some healthy items such as omelets or sandwiches, but I have to admit I only ever go for the breakfast food because it is to die for.

There is always a really long wait and they only take cash, so keep those things in mind when you go!"}
{"text":"We were visiting Pittsburgh and decided to try out Pamela's for breakfast due to all the great reviews.  Either their aren't many good breakfast joints or people have a very different taste there.  We found the food to be greasy and not particularly good.  I like the idea of thinner crepe style pancakes, but these just don't taste good.  On top of it all, the coffee was horrible.  

Try DeLuca for a diner experience or Crepe Parisiennes for a good crepe and coffee instead."}
{"text":"Delicious breakfast menu in generous portions.  Loved the crepe style hotcakes filled with fresh strawberries or blueberries.   Excellent friendly service."}
{"text":"Another place my dad and I went on our trip to Pittsburgh to see the Mets.  I apologize for being so late in the review so details are sketchy.  We went for a late breakfast mid-week.  We both enjoyed our breakfast.

I went with the chocolate chip banana pancakes and dad went with hash.  

The pancake was like a large folded crepe-like pancake stuffed with sliced bananas and chocolate chips.  Excellent and very filling.  I left stuffed."}
{"text":"I'm craving their pancakes right now!  In fact, I crave them every day!!  Home cooking.  Quick and unpretentious.  Cheap.  Cash only.  My absolute favorite is the short stack, love to eat the edges of the pancakes without butter or syrup.  Omelets of good and the lyonaise potatoes are awesome!  Always crowded, all locations!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for breakfast on a Saturday. It was around 10am and the place was filled. Fortunately, when my friend and I arrived we were able to be seated immediately. Once you enter the restaurant, you immediately notice the board game wall decor which makes the place look uber colorful. No complaints. 

We decided to try the strawberry hotcakes and the corned beef hash omelette. The hotcakes were different. I was expecting pancake-looking food but it came out as more of a crepe-ish hotcake texture, which I liked. The batter wasn't thick and the combination of the sour cream, strawberries, and whip cream were delish. The corned beef hash omelette on the other hand was pretty ordinary."}
{"text":"If you have 20 minutes to wait for breakfast, theres no doubt that Pam's is your best bet for a breakfast spot in Oakland. With the new app nowait you might be able to reserve a spot in line though!
Every time I have been to Pamela's I have been greeted by a group of incredibly helpful staff who are always in a good mood, even with the crazy morning rush.
I typically get the hot cakes which are a mix between pancakes and a crepe. 
The meals are very reasonably priced, however, they only except cash and Panther Funds- University of Pittsburgh's form of currency, so that might be a difficulty for some people."}
{"text":"As crowded as it is, the service is great, the food creative and tasty, never a bad meal there.  Fun atmosphere actually"}
{"text":"One word I can use to describe my meal...YUM
It's a cool little spot for breakfast. I had the Pittsburgh hash....it's to die for. I'm still planning on re-creating it at home but I know it won't be half as good and I'm a good cook. It was savory and salty which you would expect and  I loved it. The coffee at this place is actually pretty good!! My guy had a breakfast sandwich which was large and tasty. The service was super friendly and down to earth. The decor is eclectic and you'll see things that will remind most of their childhood. If in the Burgh again we'll stop there."}
{"text":"Everything is solid but if you have an addictive personality, stay away from the hotcakes...they are ridiculous. Don't forget-CASH ONLY!"}
{"text":"When is a pancake not a pancake, and better than a pancake?....When it's Pamela's crepe pancakes!

Those things are sooo good. I heard that Pres. Obama had the ladies come to the White House just to make them. So they must be good.

The homefries are superb too. Although, I like mine a little crispy, but Pamela's aren't crispy.

Everytime I'm in Pittsburgh, I try to swing by a Pamela's. Always good."}
{"text":"Incredible pancakes at a reasonable price! Decent coffee as well. Good selection for vegetarians."}
{"text":"Very long lines!!!! Good food with big portions! They only accept cash :("}
{"text":"We visited Pamela's while staying in Pittsburgh for the weekend. I would say it's a must stop for breakfast! You will wait for a table on Sunday, we stopped by around 9am and had to wait about 15-20 minutes. They do move the customers in and out pretty fast.
 I had the Chocolate Chip Banana Hotcakes and they were outstanding! It is a very sweet menu item so beware, it melts in your mouth. The ambiance is old time diner with a lot of history on the walls. Make sure you bring CASH!"}
{"text":"It takes a lot to impress me for breakfast.  Pamela's did!  The eggs are fresh and cooked perfectly. The ham was delicious and the strawberry pancakes were to die for.  The Morning After Breakfast Special was a lot of food but worth the 5 miles I ran to earn it."}
{"text":"Brunch is great here, but do prepare to wait before you can dig in. We arrived at 10am in a Saturday morning and waited for 40 mins. The omelet is delicious and the strawberry shortcake is worth a try."}
{"text":"Not much to say that hasnt already been said.  Great tasting food with large portions, good prices and mediocre service.  Need more menu variety.  Need better busing of tables so on weekends people dont stand around so long while tables sit dirty for ten minutes.  I understand it is busy and hectic, but seaters and servers need to cheer up a little.  No need to go to Deluca's while Pamela's exists."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place an easy 4.  A 4 1/2 is more accurate.  I had the corned beef hash and eggs. My wife had the blueberry crepe pancakes. I love places with original dishes. The crepe pancakes are really great. The corned beef hash is their own home made which is tough to find. What kept it from a 5 was that the hash is a little too salty. They should pull back on the seasoning especially since corned beef is salty already."}
{"text":"Great breakfast food at a reasonable price... Try the strawberry stuffed pancakes, you won't be disappointed.  When parking, use the metered parking, unless you want to stay a while and shop the strip.  Service is fast, so you'll be in and out in about 30 minutes."}
{"text":"It was awesome.  Croissant french toast is one of the greatest inventions ever.  Great service and great atmosphere complete the trilogy!"}
{"text":"Stopped by this locally recommended diner. There were lines out the door for Saturday. Don't be swayed though. My pal and were seated within 15 minutes. The food was aiight but served super fast.  We were ready for a long bike ride so loading up.  I must say the crepe hotcakes are quite tasty with its crispy edges. i found the service to be a bit slow to begin with but the food sure comes out in a jiffy.

NOTE: pay at the counter."}
{"text":"Usually a long wait, but worth it.  Get the California French Toast."}
{"text":"Personal favorites: 
Tex Mex. Omelette
Morning After 

Tip: 
- don't expect good coffee
- he potatoes taste best at the strip district location"}
{"text":"What a great old fashioned diner. The scrambled eggs (I ordered Gail's favourites) were perfectly made. They use fresh eggs for their egg dishes, which is increasingly becoming uncommon. Danielle, our server, couldn't be friendlier. The decor is great as well and the rates reasonable. I recommend it wholeheartedly!"}
{"text":"I come here for breakfast every time I'm in Pittsburgh. It's like a tradition at this point. This weekend was no exception, went for breakfast with three friends on Saturday. Standing room only, as always, but the wait always goes by quick - probably about a ten minute wait at 8:30am. It's been busy every time I've been there but the service is so efficient, it's kind of crazy. 

We were seated in the back room, which I like better because then you don't have to watch all the other hungry people wait to be seated. The decor is exactly what you'd expect from an older diner and there are black & white photos plastered on the wall.

This time I ordered the veggie omelet. It came with their lyonnaise potatoes and toast. So so good, I love their potatoes and their toast is thick and delicious. I've had other omelets and their stuffed banana chocolate chip hot cakes and I've never been disappointed nor left hungry. Very big portions and very reasonable prices. Pamela's is everything I could want in a breakfast.

Long story short: Come here and come hungry. Don't expect to eat anything else the rest of the day. And bring your wallet, it's cash only."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE visiting Pamela's Diner whenever I am in Pittsburgh! It is totally worth the wait! It has an 'oldies' diner feel to it but the atmosphere is wonderful! They are always busy so be prepared to wait! They only accept cash and if you don't have any - there is a nearby ATM to withdraw money! The food is flavorful! You have to try the 'Lyonnaise Potatoes' which is a classic! It is totally different that your regular side of Potatoes! You can order it with a twist of different toppings! I love the Chorizo with it, along with scrambled eggs! Yum! They close in the early afternoon (before 3pm), depending on the location; so be aware. Breakfast is available all day! Parking at the 21st street location can be challenging but still visit! You'll love it!"}
{"text":"Pamela's Diner is a great spot for breakfast or brunch on the Strip.  I'm picky about my eggs and my scrambled eggs were perfect.  The pancakes are delish.  The restaurant is nice and clean and even when it's busy (pretty much all the time), the servers and staff are friendly.  Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Visiting pitt to see my one and only's brother graduate, we weren't invited to the honors ceremony. Thankfully, it was morning so I could try some breakfast foods (my favorite kind of foodz). 

Got there early so there was no wait. Sat down, looked at the small menu and decided on the strawberry crepe pancakes, a side of potatoes and bacon. When I eat breakfast, I do it right, ya'll. 

Food came out quick and was delicious, although the cafeteria style bacon was not my fav. But-the potatoes. OH THE POTATOES. get them. Do yourself a favor. The pancakes were thin but the strawberries, brown sugar and whipped cream complimented them so nicely, i didn't even need syrup.

Cash only, but errbody already said that."}
{"text":"I stopped because this place came highly recommended by several friends and I was not disappointed. The pancakes were very good. We shared the banana walnut pancakes and it was plenty. The pancakes are each the size of serving plates and then rolled with your choice of fruit in the middle and a liberal amount of whipped cream on top. This place will be on the rotation for me when I am in the strip district. Yeah the foods greasy and stuff, but what's the point in living if you can't feel alive? I didn't come here expecting a healthy breakfast, I came for a good breakfast. Just don't eat we everyday and you'll be fine."}
{"text":"I laugh whenever I see lines out the door of this greasy spoon diner. How has this place become such a breakfast institution? The food is cheap, and will do in a pinch, but it's just not good. Canned vegetables and sloppy,oily pancakes. Yuck."}
{"text":"Woah. Thank goodness for yelp. That's how I learned about this breakfast gem. The boy just moved to PA so we went out foraging for breakfast, but before I did, I did a quick Yelp search. We headed to Pamela's as soon as I saw the reviews. 

There were about 15 people hovering outside so went in to put our name down. Here's my only complaint. We waited patiently in the line while people paid to put our names down, but then about 6 people just cut in front of the line, which was a bit rude. 

The seating is tight, but the atmosphere diner-esque. Upon the walls are some differing varieties of art (some for sale, no less). 

The menu, while not particularly health-conscious, was heavy on eggs and pancakes. We went with the specialty pancakes, banana-walnut and choc. chip.  Both were delicious. I really wanted to and tried to finish mine, but I just couldn't man up. 

The other complaint, which is of no-fault of the restaurant, was the mother of teenage boys next to use who repeatedly started screaming at them and causing quite the scene. Despite the deliciousness of the food, things got tense for a while. 

I think the next time I have a serious pankcake-hankering, I'll find myself wishing Boston had a Pamela's."}
{"text":"Best hangover food. I got the famous corn beef hash and was very pleased with the results. The portion size was gargantuan, with a mountain of hash piled alongside two scrambled eggs and some butted wheat toast. I scooped hash and egg onto the toast, soaking the mixture in hot sauce before devouring the entire plate. I sipped watery diner-style coffee between bites. My meal was incredible and fully deserving of 5 stars but the service was less than outstanding. The waitress seemed distracted and wasn't particularly attentive, although the restaurant was not busy at the time.

Pamela's is my first recommendation for breakfast in the strip district. The fact that they only accept cash adds to the retro 1950s vibe and overall diner experience."}
{"text":"Small place, you'll be sure to wait on the weekend, it's cash only, but still completely worth a visit (or many).  For the price you can't beat the offerings, their crepes are famous for a reason, blueberry stuffed and banana chocolate are standouts, a Pittsburgh landmark that lives up to its reputation."}
{"text":"I was there dining with my son.  We've been to Pamela's in other locations and thought we'd swing by the Oakland location.   Food was good and service was great!  So why the low rating you ask....THE ROACH!!   The waitress tried to fool me by swinging by and grabbing it with a napkin but I saw it with my own two eyes!  It was crawling on the cushion next to my son.  I'd go to pamela's again but no this one!"}
{"text":"How Pamela's became a Pittsburgh institution is completely beyond me. The food is average at best (think a step or two above Denny's or Waffle House). Pancakes were soggy and bland and the veggie omelete was chocked full of processed, cheese-like goo and assorted goodness straight out of a can."}
{"text":"Love this place! The pancakes are to die for!
Portion sizes are very generous, we never leave hungry. Service is always spot on, even when it's super busy."}
{"text":"Lovely warm place and nice staff. Beef corned potatoes are very good. I have been their twice and still want to go again. ONLY CASH IS ACCEPTED"}
{"text":"Man oh man.  What can I say about this place that hasn't already been said?  The atmosphere has a 50's diner type feel which is always cool and usually always hints that a good breakfast is coming your way!

The chorizo was awesome.  I love that you can get that instead of just regular breakfast meats.

And the hotcakes...well let's just say that these aren't ordinary hotcakes.  Something about them that I have no clue about makes them some of the best in the city...no wait..the world :O

You MUST have breakfast here if you're in Pittsburgh.

And the best part, you ask?

It's right at the end of the Strip District so, after an awesome breakfast, you can take a stroll down the strip, maybe stop at PennMac, perhaps grab a few other ethnic goods, and probably a Pittsburgh sports team shirt/hat/the usual sports stuff!"}
{"text":"I was in Pittsburgh for 4 days and I ate here two of those days.  The hot cakes are what brought me back.  The first time, I got the strawberry ones.  Fresh, cold strawberries smothered with brown sugar and freshly made whipped cream wrapped in a buttery, fluffy, and slightly salty hot cake.  So. Freaking. Good.

Round 2: Fresh bananas smothered in chocolate and wrapped in a buttery, fluffy, and slightly salty hot cake.  So. Freaking. Good.

It was a bit hectic going in the morning -- they have an early bird special which has really good deals until like 8am or something.  But the second time I went, I went at around 2pm and it was super empty.  The service at 2pm was good though -- super friendly people.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Meh, I'm over it. It's ok. Heavy, typical diner food. The Lyonaise potatoes are scrumptious, but too guilt inducing. The waits, the cash only service, the service in general...I can leave it."}
{"text":"Got there when it opened, I was not looking for much, just a hearty breakfast. I had bacon and eggs with 2 pancakes. The eggs were fine, (cooked the way I requested). The bacon ok (a bit on the thin sliced side) wished it was thicker and better quality.. The pancakes were by far the worst I have EVER been served. Two of the flattest, greasiest, awful pancakes I have ever seen they were as thin as construction paper and tasted about the same.  On the bright side, I found the service pretty good, the waitress was quick with a refill of your drink, and the food was out pretty quickly.. I would have given it 3  stars if the pancakes were better, but they were really, really bad...."}
{"text":"It has to be at least 25 years since I ate at Pamela's. It was one of my mother's favorite places to grab a quick bite. We met a dear friend on Saturday midday for brunch/lunch, and I ask myself, why did I wait so long to go back, after a multitude of trips back to the \"Burgh\" throughout the years? 

I had an omelet -- cooked to perfection. I am a picky omelet eater. My eggs have to be cooked just so . . . and so they were! Truly a rarity. The accompanying potatoes were heavenly. My husband loved his corned beef and hash with eggs and potatoes. The short stack of pancakes that our friend ordered was huge . . . and after one bite, I was in Seventh Heaven. Oh, how I wish I could make pancakes just like that! The thin pancakes, almost crepe-like, with their crispy outer edges are divine. 

This location begs for an aesthetic makeover . . . looks like the same furniture as 25 years ago, but what it lacks there, it makes up for in the yummy food. Service was quick but unremarkable. 

Next time we're back in town, we'll definitely stop by for breakfast -- early so we don't have to wait!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast food in the 'burgh!  Can't go wrong with the hotcakes!!

Depending on the time of day, you may wait for a while. We waiting for nearly thirty minutes on Sunday around 1100.  The food is definitely worth the wait"}
{"text":"delicate and fluffy jussssssst the way i like 'em! 

wait wasnt tooo bad (5-10 min maybe). its short if its just 2 ppl.

i had the choc chip cookie pancake - melts in your mouth son!

def put me into a nice cozy nap mood tho. peep it out at least once."}
{"text":"This was an overwhelmingly positive experience! We were able to reserve tables for 15 people on graduation weekend. The staff were super helpful in setting tables aside for us, and I could not say enough good things about our waitress. We had family coming internationally who didn't speak much English so she was extremely kind and patient while we translated their orders. She was so good with keeping our many waters filled and never seemed impatient or exhausted by our large party! 

The food was incredible and exactly what you'd hope for at a good diner. I had the corned beef hash with bacon. The hash was amazing! Salty and greasy, and really hit the spot. I also tried some of the chocolate chip and banana crepes which were decadent and sweet, super delicious.

The only thing was that they don't have tables big enough, so we had to break up into 3 separate tables. Otherwise everything way exceeded my standards. Definitely highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast. They leave the coffee pot on the table for refills. The potatoes were the best breakfast potatoes I have ever had. Decent menu"}
{"text":"All I can say is YUM.

As many other reviewers have said, get the hotcakes. Or pancakes. Or whatever they're called. They're a cross between a crepe and a pancake with a little dash of heaven thrown in. You can get them in different flavors, I believe, but they're just as good plain. If it's your first time in, that's probably what you should get, if you're having trouble deciding. Round out the meal with some bacon, eggs and coffee and you're good to go.

The second time I went in, I tried the corned beef hash and eggs. Man are they good! They give you a generous portion and you'd better bring an empty stomach because you'll need room to put it all away. Folks, this is diner food at its finest. Why go to Denny's when you can eat locally?

The decor inside is kitschy and old school. Lots of black and white photos, memorabilia and tchotchkes of a bygone era line the walls and give you something to look at and talk about while your stomach growls in anticipation.

Just be warned, weekends are crazy, busy and crowded, and parking is at a premium. Also, they don't take plastic, so bring the green. Stake your place in line while another person from your group goes and gets a \"snack\" from Peace, Love and Donuts.  It's worth the wait."}
{"text":"A fantastic breakfast that never disappoints! I came in on a weekday morning and had a breakfast sandwich with the famous lyonnaise potatoes. It took me longer to decide what I wanted than it did to get my food! Super fast service! When I got my meal it was very tasty and a classic meal. Would highly recommend this pittsburgh tradition for anyone who has the chance to stop in!"}
{"text":"Nothing else like it. We love Pamela's! Eat more pancakes."}
{"text":"Wow the pancakes were fantastic.  Blueberry with  brown sugar the beat.  Great atmosphere as well. Diner style with family photos from the past.
You will love the food."}
{"text":"Good food!! But... Don't let a coupon/ discount deceive you- it's overpriced for value. Okay so not gonna lie the food here is pretty good. My main complaint is the lack of transparency with pricing/coupon for here. I got a coupon for a free stack of hot cakes plain with one purchase. So i purchased orange juice. Then, our waitress told us we could get toppings and only pay the price difference. On the menu, the hot cakes are listed as $6.50. The extra toppings were 2$ more. So we both purchased the banana choc chip ones listed at $8.50, naturally under the impression that with the coupon we would only pay $2. Long story short, for something I expected to spend less than $5 on, I spent $10.15 + $2 tip. Even if I didn't have the coupon I would've spent less because I wouldn't have bought a drink. By the way-- approx 10 oz of watered down OJ in a plastic cup costs a whopping $3. All I can say is that this waitress should get a reward for getting us to pay so much but overall I'm extremely disappointed with the value and have a lineup of better places to go the next time I go out to breakfast."}
{"text":"The service and food is great! 

I had to try to pancakes that President Obama just loves. They were really good. I had to share them with someone because I also has potatoes, turkey sausage, and a veggie omelet. 

The only downside is they do not take credit cards. This will be our breakfast spot whenever we come to town from now own."}
{"text":"New life goal: eat at every Pamela's in Pittsburgh.

Justifiably famous for their hotcakes, Pamela's is probably one of the best diners ever. Even when Obama visited the 'Burgh last year he stopped in. By the cashier, there's a picture of him flashing a giant smile, flanked by whom I'm assuming are the owners. (He went to the one on the Strip -- I asked.)

This particular location is in the Walnut Street shopping district, and it's not terribly large. It's not as funky as the Oakland area Pamela's, but the food is just as good. Upstairs is an unrelated Peruvian shop/cafe, which doesn't seem to serve food on Sundays.

At about 11:30 AM Sunday morning, on Valentine's Day no less, the wait here was only half an hour. Not bad! The crowd seemed to have doubled by the time my party and I left. Originally we had wanted to go to the Oakland one but it was a total mob scene and tried this location instead.

The Food: 
Fattening, delicious, huge and cheap: every diner should aspire to this! They don't serve lunch specials on Sundays, which is fine because all we wanted were the hotcakes! We all got breakfast specials ($6.75 for 2 eggs any style, 2 hotcakes and ham or sausage or bacon) and were allowed to substitute home fries or toast for the meat options. For $2 extra you could substitute a specialty hotcake. 

HUGE HUGE HUGE PORTIONS. Two separate gigantic dinner plates were needed for 1) eggs and home fries and 2) hotcakes which took up the entire plate. I made the mistake of spreading butter on top of my regular hotcakes, which I didn't realize were already approximately 50% butter in the first place. They're thinner and crispier than your average pancake and a little too salty but still good. The speciality hotcakes are more crepe-like in that they're stuffed with the filling of your choice and whipped cream and then rolled up. Whoa.

Coffee's kind of weak. The servers are the sweetest people you'll ever meet. Cash only."}
{"text":"My third Pamela's I've sampled and seemingly the largest one I've encountered. As opposed to Oakland's and Walnut Street's, this one has a 50s retro vibe going for it, which I appreciate. This is also the one Obama visited and there's a photograph of him on the wall by the register.

At about 11 AM on a recent Sunday morning the wait wasn't too crazy, about 20 minutes. Our waitress seemed a little harried due to the throng of hungry breakfast-goers but managed to be pleasant. I wouldn't arrive much later than we did though, it got even busier as the morning went on.

I had raved about the hotcakes to my fellow visitors but everyone else enjoyed their omelets and toast. At least one of us joked about clogged arteries, but we weren't expecting anything otherwise (or less delicious). 

Added bonuses about this particular Pamela's are that you can peruse the Strip District before and/or after you eat, or grab coffee at 21st Street Coffee since the kind they serve at Pamela's is meh at best."}
{"text":"Pamela's serves decent diner food. The eggs are fairly standard diner type: bunch of butter and vegetables that may not be that fresh. The pancakes, however, are quite good. I would recommend trying out there famous pancakes at least once."}
{"text":"Fiance and I hit up Pamelas for a Sunday brunchfest. Overall I was very impressed. 
I ordered the Blueberry Pancakes which were very good but almost too sweet. The internals of the pancakes consisted of brown sugar, sour cream, and blueberry's. They were topped with whipped cream. She ordered the western omelet which was probably the best I have even consumed. The side of potatoes were excellent as well. The flavor of the potatoes is hard to describe, something you will just have to experience for yourself. Service was above average as well. Wait time for food was quick to average. Ambience was diner style combined with a modern retro vibe. Parking is curbside."}
{"text":"Their pancakes are AMAZING. Seriously. They are large and sweetly crisp on the edges. Downside was the 30 minute wait (on a Saturday around 10 AM), but my friends and I walked around the area and got coffee and chai to start our morning and returned in plenty of time. We were even allowed to bring in our coffees! Enjoyed the 50's throwback style."}
{"text":"The chorizo hash was on point, with a bit of a kick to it. The flavor was great and one of the best hash I've ever had! The strawberry hotcakes were delicious, with plenty of yummy strawberries inside. And the crepe style hotcake was cooked just right. I'd definitely recommend this place for brunch/breakfast. Warning: it's cash only!!"}
{"text":"So lovely, so Pittsburgh. Do yourself a favor and try the Banana hot cakes. They're freakin' unbelievable. If one dreamed up a perfect diner experience they would dream up a place like Pamela's. Lovely servers too."}
{"text":"After reading about this Pittsburg institution we had to try it! The portions are huge and get ready to run a few miles after digesting as the food is super greasy and rich but totally delicious. The strawberry hotcakes were amazing! The crispy edges of a thin pancake crepe were soooo good!!! Also we had the famous corn beef hash and it was impossible to finish, soooo greasy but full of flavor, just make sure to drizzle with hot sauce. We also ordered bacon, it was just OK so I would skip it next time. Overall this was a great diner, friendly and super fast service as well. I can see why it's so popular with the locals!"}
{"text":"By far the best breakfast place to eat in Pittsburgh. I had French toast with Carmel and nuts, it was wonderful. My husband had the pancakes with strawberries, it melted in my mouth. Our server was excellent. I would recommend anyone to try this place!"}
{"text":"So, I will start by saying that I no longer live in Pittsburgh (Shadyside) but during the two years that I did, I went to Pamela's just about every weekend for their AMAZING crepe style hotcakes. I have never had anything like them - nor have I been successful in trying to make copycat recipes at home, much to my dismay. Now that I have moved away from Pgh, I have such huge cravings for these things and it is a shame that they are not readily available. For those that aren't into eating sweets for breakfast, just about everything I ever ordered was delicious. If visiting Pgh, this is an absolute MUST. You deserve a swift kick in the shins if you pass this breakfast place up. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Good breakfast. Potatoes probably the best party. Omelette was good, not great, but definitely a solid place for breakfast. I'd definitely go back next time I'm in town. Nice staff and service."}
{"text":"This place is one of the best. Of the two times I've been to Pittsburgh, I've been to Pamela's three times. Can't visit Pittsburgh without coming to Pamela's. This location is nice and small with a pretty cool retro-ish theme going on. The hotcakes are one of the most unique and special items they have. Highly recommended to get at least one hotcake (it's pretty big). Also tried their corned hash which was pretty good but not nearly as special. The location is pretty fun as well especially if you're not from the area since it's on a street with a decent amount of shops to walk around."}
{"text":"Went to breakfast here on a Sunday morning.. Took about 15 minutes to get seated which wasn't bad at all because there was a long line! Got the Chocolate Chip Banana Hotcakes (they were awesome if you like chocolate and bananas which i do) and a Spinach Feta omelet with the home fries (soooo good). Our waitress was attentive and kept checking on us even though the place was full. Cash only keep in mind. And another problem is the lack of space between you and the table next to you. (barely enough room for the server to get by)"}
{"text":"The only complaint I could have for Pamela's is the cash only deal. But never fear, there are plenty of atm's that are close. Other than that, this place is amazing. The service is always quick and the food is always delicious."}
{"text":"Great hotcakes. No so great wait.  The hotcakes are worth trying, but there are other places in Pittsburgh that have much shorter waits that I prefer."}
{"text":"Oh, we love Pamela's in the Strip. We come here several weekends a month for a Sunday brunch. Sometimes there is a bit of a wait in the early morning, but it's well-worth it. Or you can go a little later in the afternoon and get seated right away. 

This place is so cute. Every time we're there, we find some new picture or kitschy item to smile about. And it is so consistent. You know you're going to get exactly what you order, exactly how you expect it, and every time we come for breakfast, it never changes. 

The veggie and mushroom and cheese omelet are fantastic, huge and well-stuffed. Gail's Favorite Eggs are another great choice - who would have thought a dollop of cream cheese on scrambled eggs would be so amazing!? The lyonnaise potatoes are the superstar on the plate though. And I love that they serve your coffee in a huge carafe so you never have to wait for a refill! 

The staff are always super friendly and welcoming, although they do get busy and it can be a wait on drink refills. 

I can't say enough about how much I love this location! 

Pamela's is cash-only. There is a PNC ATM right around the corner and a Citizen's Bank ATM a few blocks up Penn Ave."}
{"text":"Breakfast is always good. But too much Pamela's seems greasy. You can cook it all at home for much cheaper. However, the pricing really is low when you're lazy. The wait is ridicious at times. I would recommend the Shadyside location over the other two. It's more clean and better parking. Cash only."}
{"text":"kinda overrated because its like the only brunch place in the immediate area... wait is always long and food is pretty mediocre... plus shady side has really declined as a shopping district... BR has gone pretty useless now that its so expensive... who would pay $17 for a thin T-shirt made in malaysia?"}
{"text":"Yum! Those lyonnaise potatoes are to die for. Cheap, delicious food, really fun atmosphere, and you get an entire carafe of coffee.  Five star recommendation for this part of town!"}
{"text":"The best pancakes ever! Especially the strawberry filled. Sometimes there is a bit of a wait but if you get there early it's fine. I love it!"}
{"text":"If there's one type of place that is under-represented where I live, it's a good diner serving breakfast around the clock.  Sure, you might run across one ever once in a while.... but you just don't see them like you do in PA.  I miss that.  So, stopping by for a good breakfast was a must on my trip to Pittsburgh. 

As you would expect at a diner, everything was quick, efficient and without unneccessary flourish.  Get in, order, eat, pay the lady up front, see you next time.  I knew that going in.  Some folks expect to be talked to.... to get the specials of the day and ask what's good.  This probably isn't the place for that. 

I ordered the chorizo and eggs, and my wife got the banana walnut hotcakes.  My wife loved her meal, and mine was exactly what the doctor ordered!  It was the fuel needed for that long drive back to DC. 

While a meal at a \"greasy spoon\" isn't for everyone, if you are in the mood, this is a great place to go. 

Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I love this place !! I always want to stop here when I'm in Pittsburgh .
I got the most amazing omelette here. I think I asked them to put ham and cheese on it and it was amazing for an omelette.
Then their pancake was so yummy.
Another person I was with adored their croissant French toast.
This place is great for breakfast and prices are great.
Also cash only!!"}
{"text":"The best hash I've ever had! We had the hot cakes and chorizo hash - couldn't have asked for better brunch food. And not to mention their hot chocolate, perfect for a cold weather like today! Other plus is free WiFi"}
{"text":"Had 4 of us. We had Pittsburgh hash, Cuban sandwich, banana choc chip pancakes and a cheeseburger. Everybody enjoyed their meal. The world famous lyonnaise potatoes might have been the best I ever tasted. Had about a 30 minute wait on a Saturday at 1145am"}
{"text":"We loved this place so much we went twice in the span of 2 days. We would've gone again if it weren't cash only. Anyway the hot cakes are incredible first day I got the banana and chocolate chip hot cakes and these are cooked so perfectly with nice crispy edges on the crepe-like hot cakes. You cannot miss the homefries/famous lyonnaise potatoes these potatoes are to die for, some of the best home fries I've ever had. The first day we came it was about lunch time so my eating partners both ordered the diner burger and they absolutely loved it. Today they both had the chorizo hash special which was also amazing. Needless to say anything you get is going to be great. The staff is nice and you can get in and out really quick if you need to. There were no waits either of the times we came through. If you're in Pittsburgh this place is not to miss!!"}
{"text":"We had Greek chicken wrap,  western omelette,  and California French toast.  All meals were great except for the 1inch, sharp, thick sliver of wood we found in the the chicken wrap... maybe added for more fiber. We told the waitress and she gave us the wood sliver meal for free.  We will definitly go back but we'll be wary of foreign objects."}
{"text":"Pamela's is a Pittsburgh staple. They have the best Lyonnaise potatoes!!! While  you should be prepared to wait for the location in the Strip District (the original), it is totally worth it. It is so delicious. This past Sunday when I went, we waited about 30 minutes for 3 people. Our service was great and the food came out quickly. I got the daily special, which was kielbasa, eggs (done to how you want them cooked), and the Lyonnaise potatoes. It was so good, too much food, and perfect for leftovers for lunch the next day."}
{"text":"I tragically didn't know of the existence of Pamela's until late high school. Being shamefully unenlightened, I likely ingested hundreds of pancakes inferior to these throughout my early years. 

I therefore dedicate this review to anyone that's either young themselves or has young kids. Don't waste your childhood. Life is too short for subpar pancakes."}
{"text":"Always packed, but solid service and great food. Best breakfast in Oakland."}
{"text":"Went there last summer. The food is great, but the thing that I'm not a huge fan of is how small and packed it it in there. In the mornings you can't get a spot so you give them your cell phone number and they call you when a spot clears up. The food I liked the most is their bacon or pancakes. The waiters/waitresses are very professional about everything. You can tell that they have been waiting tables for a while. The wait for your food is not long once you order. I recommend it for people that aren't in a hurry to get breakfast."}
{"text":"On my trip to Pittsburgh we decided to stop by here for a Sunday brunch after hearing it was one of the best breakfast places in the city.  

It was very crowded and they pack you in like a high school cafeteria.  It is a no frills atmosphere with the menu waiting on the table.  It was packed with hung over college kids when we were there around 12:30 pm on a Sunday. They have a good variety of breakfast foods to choose from including hotcakes, french toast, omelettes, etc.  They also had the classic breakfast sides of bacon, sausage and home fries.

I chose the strawberry hotcakes.  This was a couple of crepe like pancakes with strawberries and sour cream stuffed between and some whipped cream on top.

The hotcakes were excellent.  They were soft in the middle, but kind of crispy around the edges.  Just like I want them.  Also, the strawberries inside were very good.  They were sweet and juicy.  This was the best part of the meal.

Now for the not so good.  The home fries were mushy all around and there might have been some type of cheese sauce on them.  There was something creamy mixed with them that I was not sure about.  I like my home fries to be crispy on the outside.  These were just mush.

Finally the bacon was bush league.  If you are going to market yourself as a breakfast spot you cannot serve rinky dink bacon like this.  It was a disgrace.  You need to have big meaty, crispy flavorful bacon.  This bacon was thinner than a piece of paper.  It was just not what you should have if you are specializing in breakfast.  If I wouldn't have enjoyed the hotcakes so much, I would have rated this place a 2.

Go for the hotcakes, but order the sausage over then bacon and skip the home fries."}
{"text":"Very good breakfast! They have a good selection of both sweet and savory items, and personally I prefer their sweet pancakes ans waffles. Those are made just right, with delicious jam. The pancake was really soft and buttery. Love it!"}
{"text":"Maybe this is a local favorite. We were on vacation & just expected more. Where we were seated (in the right hand side area) I felt like we were literally rubbing elbows w/ our neighbor! the b'fast we had was mediocre. The lyonnaise potatoes were tasty.  We just ate as quickly as we could so as to get out to breathe Again, maybe I'm being harsh but this just didn't appeal to us at all. I would try one of the many other choices in the area."}
{"text":"I have been to Pamelas more times than I can count. The line never phases me because I know it's worth the wait. And yes, if you go on the weekends for breakfast, there WILL be a line! The good thing about this is the location. If you have a decent wait you can just walk the strip for a little while you wait. 

There is something special about the pancakes here. They are thin and delicious with nice crispy edges. They tickle my fancy every time they grace my lips. I always get \"the morning after\" which comes with pancakes, meat, eggs and a side of lyonnese potatoes. Please get the lyonnese potatoes! You will thank me later! I am writing this review and am going to get in my car and head to Pamelas as soon as I'm done, yes it's that good! 

I am not a fan of Obama but we can definitely agree that Pamelas is the number one breakfast spot in the burgh!"}
{"text":"P&G's Pamela's diner has a nice old school feel to it. The atmosphere is relaxed and a little on the loud side, but you can still have an intimate conversation...quickly...before your food arrives. The service is fast paced and if you're lucky, you won't have to wait to find a seat.  Soon after you sit down, get comfortable, and begin observing the old pictures and wall decor, a waiter is ready to take your order.  We ordered coffee first and it was maybe a medium dark or house blend, served at just the right temperature. For our meals, we ordered the popular crepe style hotcakes with sausage and I added scrambled eggs with cheese. We took around 3 sips of coffee before our food arrived. They serve their food fast! The hotcakes were perfectly cooked with nice crispy edges. The sausage were link style; and the eggs were cooked well done with cheese, just the way I like them. I had no complaints, the meal met our expectations and was prepared well. Just like most Pittsburgh diners, you can only pay with cash. Also, they do not have free parking, it is either a metered spot or $5 a day along the market place on Smallman.  It's a nice place take family visiting from out of town or if you want to try their popular crepe Hotcakes."}
{"text":"Awesome burgers. Lines were long but it was worth the wait! If you get a salad, try the dressing that's oil and vinegar ( I forget the name, I believe it's the house dressing)The only thing you need to know is it's only cash, so bring your cash!"}
{"text":"These hotcakes (crepe pancakes) are to die for. I just had the blueberry hotcakes this morning and I almost creamed my pants.   I obviously couldn't finish the whole thing or else I'd be in a food coma or turn diabetic from the rich brown sugar embedded between the layers or cream, butter, and magic, but it was one of the best breakfast pancakes/crepe variations I've ever had.  This is actually quite a big deal to me because I've had classic Paris crepes with Nutella, and this is up there on the \"omg you have to try it\" scale.

The quirky diner scene with checkered tables was a nice addition, and the staff is rather friendly. Apparently this place is crowded for brunch on weekends, but going on an overcast Tuesday morning at 9 seemed to work out well.  Anyway, if you're in Pittsburgh, you must try this place. For Shame if you have not!"}
{"text":"Pamela's is a great classic Pittsburgh diner. This is the third location I've visited in the city and it's relatively small but just as good as the others. Affordable on a student budget, fast service, and always delicious. Only downsides are the long wait on any weekend morning, and cash only payment. Worth it! Plus there's an ATM right outside. Highly recommend the pancakes!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast but usually has a long wait. Worth the wait if you have time. Smells heavenly when you walk in."}
{"text":"Have been here a couple of times. Got mixed feelings. Service is usually very slow... not much space between tables. It's very popular in oakland, never been other locations. The food is good, but it is not as good as the popularity level."}
{"text":"Take out today and since I have already tried some of the breakfast items from menu I thought I would try a sandwich.. the roasted turkey. I was a little concerned that it would be lunch meat turkey - but it wasn't.. thank goodness.  It was real turkey and just delicious.  I was surprised the sandwich was rather small.  It was almost the size as two slider sandwiches.   

The Lyonnaise Potatoes that everyone raves about - I tried those.   I was pleased with the portion size (next to my roasted turkey sliders) However; they were good but didn't knock my socks off.  The onion flavor was a bit over the top for me.  That's all I could taste. Maybe the next time - will be a different batch and not full of onions.   The bread was fresh."}
{"text":"5-star food plus 3-star service = 4 stars

We came here on a Friday at 11:30am, so we got a table very easily.  We were planning to go to Deluca's but opted for this place after seeing 2 reviews here and 1 review on Deluca's page that recommended coming here.  Nobody on either review page told us the opposite (to go to Deluca's over Pamela's).

We were not disappointed.  The breakfast menu is pretty basic.  I got the Tex Mex omelette.  The eggs were very fluffy, the bread was fresh and think, and the potatoes lived up to the hype.  My wife got the blueberry pancakes which were filled with fresh blueberries rather than gross blueberry compote.  The coffee was so so.

The waiters seemed rushed, and our waitress never checked on us even though she had downtime to talk to her colleagues behind the counter.  Several times we tried to flag her down for a refill, but she literally didn't even look at us to see if we were okay.  I know this because we watched her walk up and down the dining room at least 5 times.  Pretty disappointed by this, but the food was great."}
{"text":"I rarely give 5 stars. It has to be an exceptional experience. Breakfast here was a religious experience. Hands down the best in my memory. Crepe hot cakes are like heaven on your tongue. The corn beef and Swiss omelet was superb. 

Are they a one trick pony? Maybe but that trick is worth the visit. 

GO HUNGRY."}
{"text":"Yummmy! I had the strawberry day after crepe with some ham and over easy eggs. DAMN! Thats what I am talking about! Generous portions and all cooked to perfection. The Crepe was crisp in all the right places and eggs and were running all over the place! Yummy! only negative is that they dont accept cards. Which I learned the hard way. I had to run back to the Westin to get some bills. The staff was super cool about it though and let me leave an ID while I ran to get some cash. Honestly the best meal I had in Pit!"}
{"text":"To all the haters: Obama ate here while on the campaign trail (Strip District location), and liked the pancakes so much, he asked Pamela to come down to the White House and make hundreds of them for the Memorial Day breakfast!

http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/09145/972563-46.stm"}
{"text":"This diner is sort of a landmark in Pittsburgh.  How do I know that?  The server could not tell me me more about it but she said - what I know is that President Obama liked our hot cakes very much.  
I can testify that President Obama has a good taste because hot cakes were delicious. They were melting in my mouth and had a right balance of fluffiness and consistency.  The other stuff was good but I would go back for hot cakes every day of the week and twice on Sundays.
For me, it was like a breakfast version of DC's the Tombs (see my review of the Tombs) since there are many students working and patronizing it."}
{"text":"Everything was great except the coffee. I had the hash, which varies in quality across places and I thought there's was pretty good. My fiance had a pretty convincing spinach and egg white omelet. Service was great. Cash only is lame though.  Coffeewise, they don't have half and half or light cream. Just milk and a liquid non-dairy creamer. Eww. Good food overall."}
{"text":"Maybe I'm caught up in the hype... Is this really a  place? Maybe,  maybe not. 
A friend and i decided to wait it out on a saturday morning. Add your name to the list and wait around outside. (Better than actually standing in a line.)
I normally go for a savory breakfast, like sausage and eggs, but the hot cakes seemed to be a big deal. They were really f'in good. If everything else were mediocre it would be worth going just for the hot cakes. They're thin, crepe-style with crispy edges. Sooo good."}
{"text":"This place does not take cards, fyi. I was very excited to try this place, so on my last day in town I dragged my 8 college students there haha. It was extremely busy on the Sunday in June that I visited, and it took a few minutes to find a table, but honestly I had expected a much longer wait. Definitely a diner, and looks like a local favorite. Our server was very friendly, and we received our orders fairly quickly, especially given the size of the group. 

My group ordered a variety of different breakfasts, but I went with the croissant french toast on the recommendation of the server. It was great, and definitely something a little different. Now I wish I could go back for the pancakes!"}
{"text":"Great start! Our wait was short and very organized. Loved the text when table is ready. Waited about 30 mins for food. A little long for breakfast but food was very good."}
{"text":"Unless you're in the mood for flat and floppy discs of grease (aka Pamela's famous crepes), don't go here to satisfy your pancake craving. (They don't make traditional pancakes anymore).

In the past few years they ditched whatever hint of authenticity they still possessed and redecorated.  From comfy and gritty city diner to garish comic-book/Andy Warhol-esque ugliness.  Music greats like Janis Joplin are painted on the wall and I guess we are supposed to think they, too, like to eat greasy Pamela's on a Sunday morning?

Pamela's is overrated. For good breakfast go to Deluca's in the Strip."}
{"text":"Best breakfast in Pittsburgh - hands down! Everything I ordered was delicious. Not only I recommend my friends to go here, I also go there when I am in town. Though I moved away from Pittsburgh, I go to eat at least one meal here every time I am in town. 

It can get extremely busy so be prepared to wait for tables."}
{"text":"I so disappointed. Was told this was a great breakfast spot. I found potatoes over salted and way too much butter. The used frozen spinach on my eggs which caused them to be water. But I do saw atmosphere was typical diner and service was good. I will have to see if lunch is better."}
{"text":"We were told that the wait would be 20 to 30 minutes.  We watched the young man at the counter seat young women who came in after us first.  They had the same number in their party and he was calling them by name.  We were told that they would text us.  We left after 40 minutes after we watched this happen 3 times.  We received a text that our table was ready at 55 minutes.  We were already eating at Panera at that point.  Don't go here unless you know the staff."}
{"text":"While I do think Pamela's is a tad bit overrated on Yelp, I still think it deserves 4 stars just for their crepe-like pancakes. Pamela's is the perfect breakfast/brunch spot for anyone with a sweet tooth. 

I ordered their Strawberry pancakes and it was an explosion of sugary goodness in my mouth. Each order comes with 2 thin hotcakes rolled up in cylindrical fashion, filled with fresh strawberries, brown sugar, syrup and topped with whipped cream. If I didn't have diabetes before, I just may have it now. The hotcakes were melt-in-your-mouth soft while retaining some crispiness and char along the edges.
 
I also ordered scrambled eggs and ham which were both pretty average. My buddy ordered the Tex-Mex omelet and was less than impressed. Sure, the food might be a little greasy and/or buttery but I did not go to Pamela's expecting to eat granola and bananas. Overall, the food, service and ambiance were all pretty average. The Strawberry pancakes was the only exceptional dish that raised my overall rating of Pamela's to a 4."}
{"text":"I dream about these thin crepe-style pancakes!!! I make sure I hit up Pamela's every time I return to the 'burgh. It's an institution, and there will definitely be a wait if you show up on a busy Strip District Saturday. I made the mistake of going the Friday before Christmas and the wait was pretty long, but well worth it. Yes, these pancakes are pretty unhealthy, but once in a while you just gotta treat yourself. Potatoes are delicious too. It's all awesome.

Cash only, so don't be that person!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Shadyside breakfast/brunch spot. The food is amazing and doesn't take too long to be served. My personal favorite is the strawberry hotcakes. It's a cash only diner though so make sure you have cash before you walk over. The line can get pretty crazy around lunch time especially on the weekend."}
{"text":"A Pittsburgh institution! Delicious breakfast, fabulous service, a must do! If there's a wait-trust me it's so worth it! Go for the chocolate chip banana pancakes."}
{"text":"This is the best place to get food at Pitt campus hands down. The portion sizes are always up to par. Omelettes come with a large helping of their potatos. The potatos served with meals are not your typical homefries but they are thin cut potatos sauteed in butter and onions. Absolutely divine with eggs and bacon. The Tex Mex Omelette comes with ample scoops of guac, salsa, and sour cream. Just incredible and the service is quick and to the point, kids working there are always nice. Pamelas Hotcakes stand out from the crowd because they are different than your typical fluffy pancake. They are thin and buttery with the consistency of a crepe. You can get pretty much anything you can think of as a topping for the hotcakes! Go there for breakfast if you're in the Oakland, Pittsburgh area!! Cash only which is annoying"}
{"text":"Believe it or not, my native Pittsburgher boyfriend had never been to Pamela's.  So when he brought me home to meet the parents, he thought it would be a great chance for us all to give it a try.  

We went early (8:30am- yikes!) on a Sunday morning and got in easily without any wait.  The inside is bright, colorful, and vintage-retro diner kitschy.  I have to admit I got a little distracted looking at all the old black and white photos on the walls.  

I couldn't make up my mind when it came time to order- which never happens.  I decided to go with the most diverse option and got the breakfast that included eggs, bacon, toast, and 2 of their crepe-style thin pancakes.  

The eggs were great but the pancakes were a little too thin for my taste.  The edges tasted crispy but in a burnt way.  I also think I set my expectations too high, after reading all the rave Yelp reviews.  Naturally, I filled up quickly and could only eat half of the pancakes.  There was no way I'd be able to finish both.

The best part of the meal had to have been my boyfriend's potatoes.  YUM!  They were soft but crispy on the top, flavorful but not overseasoned.  Fluffy but not greasy.  Total perfection!  I'd take them over the crepes if I had a chance to go back."}
{"text":"I can't get enough of this place! The service is fast and the food is absolutely fantastic-my favorite is the chocolate and banana hot cakes."}
{"text":"This is your typical neighborhood diner. Many locations in Pittsburgh and they are always crowded so you know you are getting good food. Many a times I have been for breakfast and my go to is the chocolate chip pancakes with bananas or the pancakes with strawberries and sour cream both delicious. On my past visit I went for lunch- my first time trying lunch but you can always get breakfast all day. I went with a turkey sandwich with american cheese ( really the only kind of cheese they had). When it was served it was literally slices of turkey breast and a piece of cheese on a roll. I had to ask them to bring lettuce and tomatoes for me to put on. I asked for mustard and they were out. How could that be but luckily they ran across the street to buy 2 bottles at the Riteaid. An extra star for that staff member. The sandwiches come with a choice of fries or their famous lyonnaise potatoes. Always recommend the potatoes.  The service is fair and a fun place to try when visiting Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Descriptive phrase: faux-diner.

Pamela's is one of the two most famous breakfast spots in Pittsburgh (the other being DeLuca's). From people I've talked to, that's mostly because of its location on the Strip and because President Obama likes it. I went this past weekend for brunch with Katie K. and her sister. There was a large crowd waiting inside and out to be seated, and we waited about 30 minutes.

The place itself is styled to be an old-school diner, and the menu tries to reflect that. I ordered the Corned Beef Hash ($7.59), while the girls went for Chocolate Chip Banana Hotcakes ($7.29) and the Strawberry Hotcakes ($7.29).

The food arrived fairly quickly. The Corned Beef Hash was fine, but didn't have any kick that I expected. The Choco-Chip Banana Hotcakes (pancakes), though, were to die for. I'd get those if I went back.

I say it's a faux-diner because it just seemed like more of an act. Maybe it was the fact that it's become such a tourist trap, I'm not sure. The service was quick but not particularly friendly. It's also CASH ONLY.

The Banana Hotcakes were great, but that's it for Pamela's. Don't bother with the hype, and head to DeLuca's around the corner for better greasy-spoon grub."}
{"text":"I come for the pancakes, I leave having to loosen my belt a few notches.  If you like pancakes, you must try Pamela's crepe pancakes--they're amazing.

The potatoes are OK, but the eggs and breakfast meats aren't anything special.  The cash only policy is inconvenient, but managable."}
{"text":"P&G Pam's Diner does not need me to tell you to eat breakfast there--I need to tell you to eat breakfast there! Whew, now I feel better. It feels good to get that off my chest, but I must tell you more. The Tex-Mex omelette was muy benito, and my guy's pancake, eggs, and bacon were very good. Is the bread homemade? Maybe! But it is delicious. Y.U.M."}
{"text":"If I could give 10 stars I would. Absolutely work any wait time - I'd sit outside for 2 hours to eat their food. Diners always come off as overly greased, poor quality, blah blah blah. Got eggs, bacon, & choco chip pancakes. The bacon and eggs were not greasy at all! And so tasty. The pancakes (called hotcakes here)were hands down the best pancakes I've ever had in my entire life! Literally, I'm thinking about them and am salivating thinking about it. The food was so good nothing else matters - service was good, ambiance was great. But the food"}
{"text":"Really cute place, fun family pictures and vintage items. The food was really good! Some of the best potatoes I've experienced! Ridiculous folded pancakes are great too. Super long lines when we got there on a Saturday morning and they moved fast. The older black gentleman bussing tables was a really nice guy and funny as well and was great to us. Really like this place"}
{"text":"One of my favorite breakfast spots of the city! Be prepared to wait and make sure you get the crepe hotcakes. My mom ordered the croissant french toast and loved it as well. The portions are large and it is super quality diner food. Check out one of the locations in the city- there are several!"}
{"text":"Casual and delicious place to have breakfast. The pancakes were the best I've ever had!!!  The Tex mex omelette was also fantastic!!"}
{"text":"This place is not bad. Typical diner food, it is what it is. Best thing I ate were the strawberry hotcakes, essentially strawberry crepes. Pretty tasty. They serve what may be the worst coffee I've ever tasted though.

Cash only! But they were pretty friendly and understanding when we had to leave to get cash to pay for our meal. 

Is it worth a eating here? If you're passing by, sure. But I wouldn't make a big effort to eat here either."}
{"text":"Good and great that I got in right away (summer). Pretty standard brunch fare. A lot of rather loud college kids but it was noon on a Sunday so I understand. 
Tried the specialty crepe/pancakes (Chocolate banana) and it was good for a few bites but really sweet. The crepe underneath was great!"}
{"text":"Had the most delicious brunch here last weekend. Those strawberry hotcakes are TO DIE FOR! Honestly so delicious. Wish I lived closer so that I could eat these weekly.

The eggs/ham were fine, but honestly go for the strawberry hotcakes!

Nice service & funky decor."}
{"text":"Consistently delicious food. Able to adapt most foods for any allergies. Have visited many times. Just ate there. Yummy."}
{"text":"Staple breakfast diner for neighborhood. We ate here twice during our trip. Hotcakes were fire and the hangover breakfast was yummy too. Yes, cash only. Yes, you always have to wait. Yes, they pack you in, but it's worth it. This place had a lot of hype and it lived up to it. It's a must for breakfast if you are visiting."}
{"text":"Oh my is this place good. There is a reason why a line be is formed going to this place. Everything on this menu is top notch. Heck the water is good!"}
{"text":"I chose to review this Pamela's as well (along with the restaurants in Shadyside and the Strip District) because I definitely notice a trend in all of them. Although the reviews will all read the same, I think it's important to note and review chain restaurants in different locations.  Factors that can potentially be vastly different from neighborhood to neighborhood include the staff and service, wait time, parking, food quality, differences among demographics in different neighborhoods, etc. With all of this said, however, I have virtually the same critique for the Oakland restaurant as both of the others I reviewed. Again, this is located in the heart of the neighborhood (like the Shayside and Strip District branches), so parking is tough right on Forbes and the place is always crowded. If you don't mind waiting a while for your table, the food here is just as good as everywhere else. The service, if anything, is a bit worse here. However, no one can deny the power of the pancake on a Sunday morning."}
{"text":"Great breakfast.
Love the crepe pancakes!
Nice service.
Reasonably  priced but remember  to bring cash.

Like  most good restaurants  there  may  be  a wait depending  on  the  time of day."}
{"text":"First of all, the decor of this place is great! The multitude of board games posted around the tiny diner makes you feel nostalgic, happy, and kid-like. Secondly, the menu is simple but the food is good. I think the French toast is my favorite! And for you Pitt students: they take Panther Funds!"}
{"text":"I came here for breakfast a few times while I was in Pittsburgh for work. It was just a short walk from the hotel I was staying at so it was really convenient. It was never crazy busy so I was always seated right away. IT'S CASH ONLY!!! Remember this! I had to run across the street to get some cash while I already ordered lol. It's your standard menu of breakfast items (I never came for lunch) and the food was consistent. Will be back!"}
{"text":"one of the best places for breakfast ever. It gets packed every weekend with students, parents, and locals alike. don't be afraid to put your name in and wait the little bit to get an amazing breakfast. the interior is pretty festive with old school board games all over the walls and ceiling. Has some of the standards of breakfast such as pancakes (hotcakes), eggs, omelets, etc  but also has their spin on it. 

this is a cash only restaurant so make sure that you have plenty of cash in order to pay for this meal. I really liked the western style omelet that i got which had chorizo sausage in it. so good"}
{"text":"Cozy diner located in the Strip District. Food was excellent, very large portions. Perfect for a quick breakfast or brunch. We ordered the broccoli and cheddar omelette and the Pittsburgh hash- both dishes are a must try! Make sure you bring cash because they are a cash only restaurant!"}
{"text":"Great and cheap. The tex mex omelet is awesome and filling, and the trivia cards at each table are an entertaining touch"}
{"text":"First time visiting Pamela's. Enjoyed a hearty breakfast. The corn beef hash is a must have. Service was good and food was hot. Will definitely visit again when we travel to the good city of Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places and must go when Im back home in the Burgh. Must try is the strawberry pancakes and home fries. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere and feel of the restaurant, nice setting and has a very welcoming feeling, except from the staff. 

My server seemed to have no interest in my experience, or my food. No personality at all, didn't give me a greeting or tell me her name, nothing. Took my order and that wall all. After I got my food she never asked me how it was, but proceeded to attend to the other tables next to me. I am alone eating here so I agree I'm low maintenance, but I didn't even get to tell her that my hotcakes had whip cream on them even though I asked for them without. 

Other than that my hot cakes and sausage was delicious, but the potatoes were a bit soggy."}
{"text":"I think it's the lack of breakfast places in Pittsburgh that makes Pamela's so popular. I couldn't find anything special here except the value. You really get a lot of food for you money, and it's pretty good food, but it's not spectacular. I'll go on a weekday, but the wait on weekends isn't worth it. I can just stay home and eat cereal, thank you."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast! Love the crepes and corn beef hash. They don't take credit cards so bring cash. Parking can be tough. Wish they would expand a bit. Great food and service!"}
{"text":"This place was great! We had several different dishes, but the chorizo hash was the winner. 

Expect a bit of a wait, but it's worth it."}
{"text":"Ok, I get it. Brunch is amazing. Sunday brunch is more amazing after a late night on Saturday. And I wholeheartedly agree that the food here is good- (how can you mess up brunch?). However, this branch on Shadyside is a nightmare to go to on the weekends. It takes FOREVER to get a table here every time. There are mounds of people that line up on Walnut Street to get a table. After spending the time outside, any food they offer you will sound amazing because your stomach is growling so loudly. Objectively, the food here is good and the dinner decor has a lot of character. However, I stopped going here a long time ago when I discovered that Harris Grill brunch is much more hearty and the wait will at least be half an hour less."}
{"text":"I'll offer almost verbatim the review I wrote for the Walnut branch. This Pamela's is nested within the heart of the Strip District, which is prime real estate on the weekends. Parking anywhere close to here is as painful as passing a kidney stone and almost not worth stopping by for brunch. However, the food here again is good and it's a cool little diner to visit in the Burgh. Another drawback is that, like all of the other Pamela's, the wait is forever to get a table. If you're ok with this, please do visit and enjoy the plethora of breakfast munchies."}
{"text":"Stopped at Pamela's for a late Saturday breakfast with three friends while visiting from out of state. 

The staff were friendly and efficient, using a text message to notify that our table was ready after about fifteen minutes. Ambiance was bright and casual.

Everything we tried was fresh and flavorful. The pancakes were somewhere between American pancakes, Swedish pancakes, and crepes... airy in the middle and crunchy at the edges. 

Portions were a little on the larger side but reasonably priced. Keep in mind that the restaurant is cash only."}
{"text":"Food was good as always.  Unfortunately they put a wedding party of 20+ people across from us and let them do whatever they wanted.  They were really loud, and stood in the aisle between tables.  At one point one woman sat her butt on the edge of our table and was about 6\" from my face.  I had to ask her to move.  The staff said nothing to them, but that may be because we heard it was an employees wedding party.  Unfortunate that they don't care about their other patrons.  When the woman at the cash register asked me if everything was ok, I said the food was good, but being next to that party was terrible.  She acted like I did not say anything.  I guess when you get the great reputation that Pamelas has, you no longer care about what got you there."}
{"text":"This place has the best hotcakes !!.. I ordered the \"morning after\" breakfast special & upgraded to their specialty strawberry hotcakes, it was one of the best hotcakes I have ever had. My boyfriend also had the chorizo & eggs. The potatoes on the side were so yummy!!."}
{"text":"Great food & clean bathrooms. The latter definitely can inform the former & this place is an A in both departments! I highly recommend the strawberry hotcakes."}
{"text":"If I had to pick one thing that I missed most about Pittsburgh it would be Pamela's. I love breakfast and they do it right. I do think that this is the best location, after breakfast or brunch you can stroll through Shadyside. Sometimes you do have to wait but its never been outrageous and I'm not sure if I've ever had anything I didn't like!  My husband prefers the Oakland location but Shadyside is my pick.  (Its because of the shopping, I won't lie.)"}
{"text":"This place is a diner in Oakland with standard American fare.  It's not fine dining.  The prices are right and the service is fabulous.  

This place is an an institution in Oakland, having been here decades.  It had been remodeled since I was here in 2001, so it is cleaner and snazzier than it was before.  

If you want a non-mcdonalds breakfast, and you are in Oakland, this is the place!  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Ah, Pamela's. A true Pittsburgh favorite and must-go place when out-of-town friends are visiting. The food (best known for the famous hotcakes) is delicious and I always get the banana and chocolate hotcakes. It is truly a testament to the Pamela's deliciousness that when Michelle Obama visited Pittsburgh and ate at Pamela's, she asked the White House chef to get the hotcakes recipe to make for her at home. The hotcakes are truly decadent and probably have more butter and saturated fat than everything you've eaten today combined. But it's a wonderful calorie splurge every once in a while! Know that the wait is typically long (especially for Saturday and Sunday mornings) and it is cash-only, if memory serves."}
{"text":"One word review, YUM! This is just my kind of breakfast. Reasonably priced, very tasty and fast. I had the morning after special which included bacon, eggs and crepe type pancakes. I had the banana walnut pancakes. I had a side of the best tasting potatoes that I have ever tasted. The service was wonderful. The decor was inviting and fun. The line and wait can be long. We waited 40 mins. The time went by fast after a quick walk around the corner to get cash. Yep, no cards accepted."}
{"text":"Wow definitely loved this place. Full of culture and very unique. You notice the detail and the time they put in as soon as you walk in. I'm visiting from San Diego but no matter where your from they make you feel at home. The food is very different so it doesn't feel like just any other diner. I got the the roasted turkey breast sandwich. It was good enough to enjoy but the bread wasn't as fresh as it should've been. It was cold turkey between hamburger buns with lettuce and Tomato with a side of fries for $9. I just think they could have made it a lot better, although it was still enjoyable. We also got a turkey sausage and egg sandwich that was simply delicious. I definitely still recommend this place, great for a late breakfast or early lunch. Enjoy :)"}
{"text":"This cash only diner in the Strip District is a Pittsburgh tradition for many (much like DeLuca's around the corner) so be prepared to a) hear about the need for you to go there and b) wait a little bit, especially if your party is larger than 2. Add in the fact that President Obama invited Pamela and Gail (hint: P & G) to cook for his family at the White House, and you've got the makings of a fun place to try.

We knew we were headed to the Strip District on Saturday morning, rain or shine, and thanks to some kind Uber drivers, we were told that getting to Pamela's in the 9am hour would help us limit our wait time. They were right, and we were seated within 10ish minutes of arrival (again, being a party of 2 really helped with that.) We had our cash and were ready to decide on the menu. Wow...everything looked delicious...but one of us had to try the pancakes, right? I opted for a basic breakfast - eggs, bacon and of course, Pamela's pancakes. He went with corned beef hash, because try as they might, the west coast restaurants can never seem to get it quite \"right.\"

The hash was fantastic, exactly as he remembered as a kid growing up in NYC. The pancakes, WOW. Full disclosure: I'm not a huge pancake person, I prefer toast as a vehicle to the delicious butter flavor. That being said, these were AMAZING. They manage to get them crispy on the edge, buttery, but still soft and delicious in the middle. I have a feeling the thinness of the \"cake\" is the reason for this, but it was truly great. We both loved them, so much that the two cakes were gone while an egg still sat on the plate - that NEVER happens in our world. 

If you're a lover of diner food and have some time in the morning hit up the Strip District location of Pamela's - it really is worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Pamela's is a staple and a classic to the Pittsburgh region. I've eaten at 3 locations: Oakland, Shadyside, and the Strip District. There's usually a line and no reservations, and they only take cash. I usually get the banana chocolate chip hotcakes, and sometimes will get just the chocolate chip hotcakes with whipped cream which are both equally delicious! The service is good as well, as they bring you waters the moment you sit down, and ultimately they are trying to get tables their food and ultimately get new customers in the door."}
{"text":"A must stop in the 'Burgh every time we visit.  Pick the right time, and there won't be a wait, i.e. 9:00am on a Wednesday, but even the times we had to wait it was worth it.  Staff is friendly and has been here a long time, they know their stuff.

If you haven't been here yet, you are missing out!"}
{"text":"Good solid diner. Nice staff. Food was too notch. The building needs more adequate air conditioning but beyond that it's a winner."}
{"text":"1000/10. Would always go again. I got the Morning After special with a side of wheat toast and a hot chocolate. The crepe pancakes are amazing, their wheat toast is huge, they know how to make eggs and keep them warm, the bacon is delicious and very flavorful, and the whipped topping on the hot cocoa was abundant and tasted natural. Service was fast (got my food in less than 5 minutes) and very friendly too."}
{"text":"OMG best pancakes ever. Do yourself a favor and get the nation's greatest pancake ever - banana chocolate chip. I still have fond food memories about my single Pamela's experience - almost 4 years later. I need these pancakes back in my life!"}
{"text":"Love this place! I always get the turkey sausage and cheese omelette  it's very filling and comes with toast and potatoes. Sometimes I order it to go because it's just that good lol"}
{"text":"Omg!!! Get a Pittsburgh Salad and Pittsburgh Hash!!! Also the Tex mex omelette killed it!!! Highly recommended!!! It's cash only and there may be a wait to get seated but what do you expect for an amazing place!!!"}
{"text":"Breakfast was delicious! We put our name on the list at the front counter and waited about 30 minutes for a table. Service was friendly and as fast as could be expected at such a busy popular spot.
The pancakes are more of a crepe then a flapjack style. The edges are crispy and they are thin. The taste was delicious but the style of cake may not be to everyone's liking.
I had the Tex-Mex omelet and hubby had the Morning After. Very generous portions and tasty as well. 
I would have given 5 stars but the coffee was pretty bitter and not very hot. They serve it in insulated pitchers left at your table for self serve refills. Perhaps ours has been brewed much earlier and wasn't as fresh as it should have been?"}
{"text":"10am on Saturday, plan to wait for great hotcakes . All that wait was worth. Clean bathroom . Staff were efficient."}
{"text":"Best breakfast in the burgh!  Only complaint is that they don't take credit cards :("}
{"text":"You cannot come to/live in Pittsburgh and not eat here.  Yes, the wait may be long but it's SO worth it.  Hotcakes--that's where it's at.  I'm pretty sure half of Pittsburgh dreams about about them.  I mean, come on, even the President does. I always get the strawberry hotcakes and I've NEVER had a complaint.  Don't expect to get a seat immediately during the weekend but it's completely worth any wait."}
{"text":"I'm from California, really enjoyed the food and the service. I would definitely come back! The crepes are amazing."}
{"text":"I got the set of hotcakes eggs and sausage. The crepes were good and the rest was standard breakfast fare. For the cost the food was plentiful and decent. The decor is very diner-ish with a lot of photos of notable people who have visited before.

Next time I'll try the Lyonnaise potatoes and a specialty hot cake."}
{"text":"Nom nom nom. Food here is seriously good, but ... and I hesitate to say this, but they just give you way too much :( It took me 4 more meals over 2 days to finish my potatoes and pancakes. I feel bad not eating food that tastes this good, but I can only eat pancakes for so many meals..."}
{"text":"Drove my niece to the Univ. of Pitt to check her in to the dorm. After getting checked in we dined at Pam's for brunch before hitting the road. A former alum, my other niece recommended that we go there. The food was great. I had a light meal, turkey sausage on a cheese egg sandwich. It was good and hit the spot. The fish sandwich was huge and easily served two along with the hash browns. I would have loved to have had the pancakes but I would have had to nap after those. Maybe next time! The service was great and remember it's cash only! Till next time!"}
{"text":"Visit from 3-1-18.

I went here with a group of about 33 people for lunch.  First and foremost, I was impressed by the way they handled such a large group.  The orders were correct, and were way more efficiently timed than I expected.  

There were a lot of complaints from our group about the servers personalities, though.  While they were extremely efficient, there was a lot of complaints that they were not as friendly as we'd have liked.  They definitely did their jobs, but they weren't as warm as we would have hoped.  This could just be because they were so rushed in making sure they delivered our food as fast as they did.  

As far as the food goes, there were no real complaints.  Nothing was \"wrong\", technically.  However, I personally tried the Buffalo Chicken Pita with Onion Rings.  While it was okay, there was nothing special about it.  Was there something wrong?  NO.  Just not all the hype that I expected.  Portion wise, I was under the impression that the portions were large from the way the server explained to everyone sort of condescendingly about \"you're ordering a lot of food bro\" to people who ordered meals with extra sides...On my end, I did not experience this.

My plan is to go back and check out the breakfast items, as that seems to be what more people gravitate towards to.  I do look forward to this, and hope to update review.  I also hope to find that service will be more friendly when there is less of us."}
{"text":"Quite simply one of the best breakfast diner experiences I have had!  Visiting from Chicago and the hotel recommended Pamela's for breakfast.  I seated myself and within two minutes had three different people ask if I had been waited on.  I had the Tex-mex omelette which was very good (little more chorizo please) but the show stealer was the hash brown/cheesy potatoes that came with it!  Bonkers good!  Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Mmmm. This place is a must visit breakfast spot. I could go on about the chorizo hash with two eggs over easy, or the croissant French toast with nuts, and the morning after always hits the spot too! But I won't go into detail. The staff is friendly, the service quick and efficient, and the food is always delicious."}
{"text":"I usually go here for brunch and their portion definitely soothes the craving. The food is good, but nothing to be bouncing off the walls about. It's just your ordinary all-American breakfast. The service is fast. Good place to meet up with your friends and chit chat over coffee/tea and food. 

Pamela's definitely known for their hotcakes...warm and crispy. Give them a try and judge for yourself! And don't forget...CASH ONLY!"}
{"text":"Anytime we have guests from out of town staying with us, I make time to take them to Pamela's, especially if they have not been there before! Pamela's is located in the Strip District and is a hot spot on weekends, so plan on going during an \"off time\" on another day if possible! However, it is worth the wait. There is limited street parking, however, there is 2 hour parking located behind the businesses of The Strip. Also, be aware that this place is cash only, so make sure you are prepared! 

The building screams diner inside and out! Teals, pinks, and creams adorn the walls along with hundreds of dated pictures. There is quite a bit of seating available with the neighboring guests seated a foot away - this keeps the dining experience interesting because you may meet people from all over! The bathrooms are very small and my experience was one of toilet paper on the floor and missing toilet holders. Probably one of the only negatives I have to say about this place.

The food - those hotcakes - TO DIE FOR!! I have not ventured to trying anything else on the menu since the first time I visited Pamela's as they are delectable. I have had the banana walnut, strawberry, and blueberry hotcakes, each delicious in their own way. You would have to purchase anything additional, such as bacon or homefries if you want them, however, the two hotcakes themselves are enough to satisfy almost any appetite. Though I have selected my favorite dish at this restaurant, they have a lot of breakfast items to offer - the typical egg breakfast combinations along with french toast,  various types of sandwiches, and 
 multiple omelette combinations.You are sure to find something that you like.  

If you are in The Strip, do not hesitate to check this place out for breakfast or brunch. You will not regret your decision!"}
{"text":"This makes me question Pittsburgh.  Breakfast - and diners in particular - are important.  And Pamela's food is just mediocre:  coffee is 60's, French toast is Wonder Bread, bacon hardly better than microwave.  If this were my local it wouldn't be.

Is this really as good as it gets for breakfast in Pittsburgh?"}
{"text":"(06/12/2011) Was told this was THE place for breakfast in the Burgh.  They do deliver the goods, and in large quantities.  I've never been much for sweets for breakfast, but when in Rome...the crepe-like hotcakes were sweet-salty, buttery, a touch of a metallic aftertaste (possibly a little too much leavening); love the crispy, lacy, browned edges.  The homemade corned beef hash was savory, salty, could taste the pickling spices the beef was braised in; the over easy eggs were perfectly oozy.  The famous Lyonnaise potatoes are probably famously made with a stick of butter; rich and tender.  Be forewarned, there is a long wait on the weekends, it's a popular spot for visitors and Romans alike."}
{"text":"Definitely a good place for breakfast!! Very good potatoes would go here just for the potatoes. But very bad that they dont accept card and just accept cash. I want to go many times but I stop myelf just because I dont keep cash so much :("}
{"text":"Great food but I wouldn't wait in the long lines of students and their parents during visiting weekends. The crepe style pancakes are definitely the best (but make sure you split an order... one pancake each or you'll die of a heart-attack or overly stuffed stomach). The \"Morning After\" is the best deal... standard breakfast combo, two pancakes, two eggs, and your choice of a meat. If you have a normal appetite and a normal-sized stomach... SPLIT one or two between two or three people. Unless you like left over breakfast."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time today. I am so mad that it took me so long to finally go! I got the Tex Mex Omelet and my daughter the Chocolate Chip Banana Pancakes. Do yourself a favor and dont wait like I did. The food was incredibly delicious. Everything about our experience was stupendous! The people are great, the food came super fast, and the place has a bright fun vibe. One of the best meals Ive ever had. Fresh and high quality. Hats off to their chefs!"}
{"text":"The food was ok. Pancakes always good. My fish sandwich and fries were fair. Service? what service? we had 4 different people come to our table with no communication between them. 2 people to take a drink order, 1 to take the food order and the a food runner, (who actually put the food on the table, hid the check with the menus and ran. Never saw anyone again. No check back, not refills, nothing....I know the policy about paying in cash but then they never tally the check so that it is difficult to make sure you have enough cash on hand. Also you can't check the total charge for accuracy."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! Already missing the chocolate banana hotcakes. Worth the wait and family fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"So good! I've only been a couple times but so impressed Everytime. Yum! Bacon is so greasy but I'm not complaining lol"}
{"text":"Tasty diner food and great service in a bright, overly kitschy locale. 

Our waitress was all kinds of awesome.  She was super quick, our coffees never seemed to get low, and she brought out our food on extra plates (even though we did ask about it) to make sharing our meals easier. 

My husband and I came in on a Sunday at about 11:45 and were promptly seated.  We ordered the spinach and feta omelet with lyonnaise potatoes and the strawberry hot cakes.  Both were delicious and just thinking about the hot cakes makes my mouth water.  The potatoes were quite good too, slice up and fried with onions and lots of butter. 

My only complaint about this place is how cold it gets if you are sitting within view of the door.  

Pamela's is cash only, and for whatever reason on Sundays, does not serve their lunch menu."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite place to get brunch in the city. While the wait is usually long to get a table, especially on the weekends due to the large amount of customers that flock to the restaurant, it is totally worth it. Their omelets are fluffy, French Toast is the perfect amount of sweetness, strawberry & nutella flapjacks are something i dream about, and bacon is cooked exactly how you like it my the staff. If you're looking for the best brunch place in town, this is it!"}
{"text":"Pamela's is one of my favorite breakfast spots. I've been to this location many times. I prefer to go when school is not in session so its not as busy. I typically go at lunch time during the week and there isn't usually a wait for a table. 
I always order some sort of omelette. Today I got the Western Omelette. Seriously soooo good. Never disappointed. When we were ordering, my friend ordered a fried egg over her salad. The waiter asked a bunch of questions and then someone from the kitchen asked a question. We didn't think getting a fried egg would be such a big deal at a breakfast joint. Note: over easy and sunny side up are different!!
Parking is a pain in Oakland. As mentioned above the best time to go is when school is not in session. 
I always say I want to try the lunch items on the menu but keep ending up with breakfast. One day....
I will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Everytime I visit Pittsburgh I must go here for their hot cakes. Love this place. They accept only cash and the wait is long during peak time on weekend."}
{"text":"There is typically a wait, so get there early. This weekend, we went around 9:30 and were sat right away, which we were a little surprised by, but there was a wait when we left. Service is quick, and the restaurant is clean.

Their potatoes are amazing. The potatoes and onions are soft but have enough crispy bits that the texture is really good. I definitely recommend those, and you can get them with lunch too. I usually order one of their specialty hotcakes, frequently the blueberry ones. Thin crepe-like pancakes with buttery crispy edges rolled up around fruit. Mmmm...I want to go back just thinking of them. I've also gotten the chorizo hash, which is really good, and definitely too much food, but that's what I expect from a diner.

This most recent time I went, I got Gail's Favorite eggs. It's scrambled eggs with cream cheese and green onions, served with the lyonnaise potatoes and toast. I thought the eggs were good, but was a little surprised that the cream cheese was just two little balls on top. I expected it to be little pieces mixed in with the eggs. While I enjoyed it, I might stick with other dishes in the future. It's been a while since I got those awesome hotcakes so already wanting to go back to get those again."}
{"text":"Pamela's is a bit of a cliche in Pittsburgh. Often falling in with Primanti's as a \"go to\" spot for tourists that think they're getting a feel for the city. Brushing that grudge aside, Pamela's doesn't mess around.

As any diner should, Pamela's has their shit together. They handle a veritable flood of people like it's nothing. Not only is the service always attentive, the food is delicious. It's diner food, mind you, and not the most complex but everything they make is superb. Their pancakes make me want to eat pancakes and I never eat pancakes.

Furthermore, their is no recipe posted online for their special pancakes. Thin and crispy on the edges, there's just something about them that makes you devour way too many only to regret it later. The recipe is so special that only Pamela's namesake knows it. Shucks."}
{"text":"As a visitor to Pittsburgh (and the middle portion of the country in general), I must say that the service at Pamela's compared to other diners really added something to my meal. The host, waitress, and even the fellow diners were just so friendly and happy. 

I guess it's hard to be unhappy when surrounded by 80's pink and teal, with a huge pile of pancakes with whipped cream and chocolate in front of you. 

Committing carbicide never before made me feel this cheerful.

Brad's rating (out of 5):
Price: 5
Food: 3
Decor: 3
Service: 5+
Wild card: No waiting, even for a Saturday morning!"}
{"text":"wow, i have no idea why the reviews aren't that great for pamelas. i LOVE this place and always come here when i visit pittsburgh. i love the banana/chocolate hotcakes (kind of oily though but watever, it is crunchy goodness and requires that amount of oil). i also really like their lyonnaise potatoes (though the last time i went they were a little softer than usual.

anyway, their corned beef hash is also to die for. yumyumyum. it just sucks that they're cash only (evading taxes, hrm?) but i don't care. their early-bird specials aren't that great though so don't bother trying to go for that"}
{"text":"Pamela's is the best. Their pancakes are very unique, thin and sort of fried, and they're very tasty. The potatoes are weird - I couldn't eat more than 2 bites. The bacon was pretty gross. The service is pretty good. The coffee is good for a pot of diner coffee. All in all, an awesome diner with great food."}
{"text":"Cash. Hotcakes. Lyonnaise Potatoes.

Bonus information:

They left a coffee carafe on our table. Perfect. You've seen my picture right?

Get there EARLY. 

\"The Morning After\" is a great deal. Eggs, meat, hotcakes. Just be SURE you order the Lyonnaise Potatoes.

What the heck is Lyonnaise? No idea. But I do know this is how breakfast potatoes are supposed to be seasoned and cooked. nuf said.

Hotcakes not pancakes. This means they are thinner like crepes and crispy around the edges. Also means they they up the entire plate. You can't finish it. You will feel guilty. That is all ok.

This is my second time coming to Pittsburgh, and the second time I've come to Pamela's. If I lived here I'd come here every weekend. Drive, bus, walk, taxi, whatever. It's worth it."}
{"text":"Since Obama ate hotcakes at this Pamela's restaurant... then I naturally had to give it a visit! Besides, I woke up really late and was hungry for some good ol' diner food and a hearty breakfast.  At 1:30pm the restaurant had many available tables open so we were seated promptly.

Yay for bottomless cups of coffee! Coffee isn't too great but it does the trick.

STRAWBERRY HOTCAKES: They can only be described as a pancake disguised as a crepe.  The edges are crunchy and they're filled with strawberries and brown sugar. Top that with the whipped cream and some syrup - not bad! I didn't find them anything to rave about but they were different from the usual pancake.  Our waitress was a little slow on bringing it out though so it was a little on the cold side :(

CUBAN SANDWICH: We choose the onion rings to accompany the sandwich. What a great choice! The Cuban Sandwich was delicious. It was a tasty combo of pork, pickles, cheese, mayo and mustard between two dense and crunchy pieces of bread. Between bites of the sandwich I stuffed my mouth with their fantastic onion rings! Those onion rings are some of the best i've ever had! They had a thick, fluffy, crunchy fried batter which made them worth every bite.

A side of LYONNAISE POTATOES: I am in love with these potatoes! Everyone's right, do try them!!

CASH ONLY!"}
{"text":"My husband and I visited Pamela's while on a business trip in Pittsburgh. It's a cute little place located near The Strip. We went on a Tuesday morning and there were plenty of tables. 

My husband had the Cuban sandwich and it was amazing. The bread was perfect. His side was the Lyonnaise potatoes which are a MUST get. Seriously the best potatoes I've ever had. 

We also loved the flat crispy pancakes here. We tried the croissant French toast as well. It was good but verrry sweet. 

Overall it was a great breakfast and we will come back the next time we visit."}
{"text":"I have been trying to like Pamela's for years, but every time I go, I am severely disappointed.   I have been to the Strip District location, Millvale and now the Oakland one.  They are all completely overrated.  The food is not worth the long waits.  Their omelets come with American cheese which tasted like Velveeta. Gross.  I had no idea or I would have ordered something else.  They also screwed up our order (this happened at the other locations, too) and my mother got the wrong omelet.  We didn't care because we have waited so long for the food to come.  All of the tables were filled with people just waiting for food.  Their kitchen is completely overwhelmed with the amount of orders.  Lyonnaise potatoes and french toast were ok, but not enough for me to ever come back to a Pamela's anywhere.  Seriously, why do people like this place?  Bad service, average food, cash only and huge crowds.  Oh and they won't seat you until your entire party has arrived.  I would rather wait for a table at the Dor-Stop in Dormont.  That is food worth waiting for."}
{"text":"We normally go to the Pamela's up on Squirrel Hill, so this was our first time at this location. Let's be honest, there's always going to be a wait for Pamela's - on a weekend - but the wait for this one was PACKED. All families and students, which is understandable when you don't have a car and this is the most convenient location. 

Not sure if all Pamela's are the same or different, but the food at this Pamela's was definitely different than the one we usually go to. WHY?? I was sooo looking forward to my chorizo hash. At this one, they just dump a pile of chorizo on top of potatoes - not what I was expecting. 

At least their hotcakes are still the same.. 

FYI: this place uses an app that's connected (or may be the same thing) as Yelp. So you can put your name down online via Yelp (one of those stand in line functions). Wish we'd known that. 

Double FYI: this place is cash only for those you all first timers!"}
{"text":"Pretty decent breakfast. I had the Tex mex omelette which was delicious. I substituted the chorizo for turkey sausage - YUM! The breakfast potatoes were also delicious. Luckily when I went, it wasn't packed but it did start getting busy once I was leaving. I can see how this place can sometimes have a bit of a wait. Also don't forget to bring cash, CASH ONLY!"}
{"text":"The pancakes are thin, with crispy edges. It is very rich! I suggest you share a plate so you don't go into a food coma. If I am ever back in Pittsburgh, then I will surely return to this tasty breakfast hot spot!"}
{"text":"Pamela's is my favorite breakfast place in Pittsburgh. I've tried many items on their menu and have never had a bad experience. Only bad thing is that on weekends if you have a big group of people you will have a wait. But trust me, it's worth it."}
{"text":"A great, independent eatery.  They have breakfasts of all description, freshly made and quite enormous, at reasonable prices.  Bring a big appetite.  Their omelots will fill you to bursting even if you don't eat the huge slices of bread and hash browns that come with them.  And,  hey, the coffee is good, too."}
{"text":"Worst service ever experienced at a diner!  How Long can it take to get an omelette and three sandwiches at 2:00 in the afternoon?"}
{"text":"Very Good Food we loved it alllll I loved the pancakes and my dude hashbrowns was delicious my bacon was good and the ham was awesome :P"}
{"text":"The blueberry pancakes were delicious and the price was right. The food came out quick and the service was friendly. There was some sort of event today and the wait was long, but worth it for a good breakfast."}
{"text":"This place is definitely worth a visit and I'm so glad it came recommended during my first-ever trip to Pittsburgh.  The pancakes (or \"hotcakes\") are wonderful. I had the chocolate (read: Nutella) banana hotcakes and they were excellent! I highly recommend them!

The service was nice and fast. The atmosphere is like a diner. The tables are close together, but somehow there still seems to be enough privacy.

I wish they served fresh-squeezed orange juice, but the hotcakes more than made up for its absense."}
{"text":"The hotcakes were good but not special enough for a trip across town or a long wait.  My bacon is thin, wimpy, and burnt.  Any respectable breakfast place should have thick, brown, crispy, flat bacon."}
{"text":"I used to love Pamela's because the chocolate chip hotcakes taste exactly like big, warm chocolate chip cookies, but the last time I ate here, I had such a bad experience that I lost all interest in ever coming back. 

I understand that diner-y restaurants use a lot of butter. In fact, I think that all restaurants use a lot of butter, but the last time I ordered the chocolate chip hotcakes, they were so buttery that there was a butter foam ring 2\" wide around the rim of each hotcake, and pressing on the hotcake with my fork caused wet liquid butter to ooze out. The hotcakes just tasted like a stick of butter. Disgraced chef Paula Deen has taught us that butter is the best, but this was just ridiculous and completely turned me off of Pamela's."}
{"text":"I'll start by saying that pancakes are one of my favorite things to eat. I was very excited to try Pamela's, the pancakes were highly rated in a variety of places.  The pancakes are very good, I actually said to my dining companion that I could eat them every day.  I had the strawberry hot cakes which are the traditional pancakes with fresh strawberries, sour cream and brown sugar rolled up tightly inside.  The foundation for good pancakes is the batter, the recipe at Pamela's is the right balance of ingredients therefore creating a pancake that is thin but still light and fluffy. 

I also tried the lyonnaise potatoes and they taste very similar to the potatoes my grandma prepared for us as kids.  The potatoes taste like they're cooked with onions and spices. Lastly, I must comment on the chorizo hash, it's the lyonnaise potatoes tossed with tons of chorizo, another winner.

Strongly recommend"}
{"text":"Have been to Pamela's several times, and the food and the customer service never disappoint.

That said, I will not return until the place has been thoroughly cleaned and some basic upgrades have occurred.

Lack of cleanliness: sticky menus, fingerprints everywhere on the glass, window ledge is filthy, chairs, tables and floors are all filthy. The bathrooms need new toilets, new stalls, new sinks. The toilets are wobbly and dirty and probably 20 years old. Also take a little care with signage handwritten signs are sloppy. 

I've never been there where the place wasn't packed. You ask us to pay with cash only, to save money on credit card fees. It would be a good idea to put some of that money back into properly caring for the physical restaurant."}
{"text":"Just there today and I've been there numerous times in the past. Up until today I've never had a bad experience with anything I've ordered until today.

I ordered the bacon and cheese omelette, which I've had before and enjoyed. When I started it everything was fine, but as I started to get into it I noticed that the bacon was so fatty that I had to spit it out- multiple times. I eventually started playing around with my fork to inspect the bacon and could clearly see the fatty pieces in there. 

I would expect more from such a popular and well run place, as I'm sure that the fatty bacon would have been seen in prep or in cooking the omelette if the kitchen staff was paying attention.

The only reason I didn't give them a one is because the service was pretty good and the potatoes and toast accompanying my omelette were up to their usual standards. 

Despite the bad experience I'm more than willing to give them another chance as they've earned that with a dozen good trips there in the past versus just one bad meal."}
{"text":"Delicious breakfast place.. got the eggs, bacon and the infamous hotcakes stuffed with sugar, strawberries and sour cream... sounds as heavy as it is lol.. I love the fact that you don't have to chose between a sweet and savory breakfast but can combine and get both. Yay! Cute place, go here!!"}
{"text":"Pamela's crepe style pancakes contain six honks of butter, and they've been unrivaled in my quest for the perfect pancake. They're fluffy in the middle, get progressively crispy toward the edges, and are a great prelude to a Sunday afternoon nap. Man, if a former worker wants to sell me the recipe, I promise not to sell it to IHOP for several hundred million dollars. Please, you can trust me!"}
{"text":"I know what I want my grave to be made out of.  Pamela's Strawberry Hotcakes.  It is to die for.  \"Crepe hotcakes stuffed with fresh strawberries, brown sugar, sour cream and topped with whipped cream.\"  The first bite of that brown sugar + crispy crepe sent sensations into my mouth unbeknown from breakfast foods.  I have had plenty of early morning grub but most of my experiences were average.  It is not hard to scramble a few eggs, fry some bacon, and mash some hashbrowns.   

Pamela's Diner is now at the top of my list for breakfast.  Along with the Obama-approved hot cake, I had eggs, sausage and toast.  My friend's waffle, omelet, and potatoes were good as well.  This Pamela's location is cash only and parking can be hard to find in this district.  The atmosphere is lively and fun.  The waitress to customer ratio is high.  The wait can be long during peak hours."}
{"text":"Quite possibly the best pancakes I've ever eaten, not to mention huge!! Could easily be a shareable. The decor is fun and decorated with different board games throughout the restaurant. Waitstaff was very friendly. The only complaint is they take cash only. Overall a winderful breakfast experience."}
{"text":"Good, but nothing to write home about.  The huge wait baffles me.  I'd get it if the food was really good or if the service was better, but this place is just mediocre.  (...And it's better than the other location I've been to, in Squirrel Hill.)

The hash browns are excellent, but everything else was just okay.  My chorizo was overcooked into hockey pucks, and my eggs were a little tasteless and came out medium after I ordered them dry.  (I also had to wait five minutes after my friends got their food for my plate to come out.)  The crepes were okay - a little overdone and chewy, and my friends said their omelettes weren't very good.

Our waitress was nice, but never really checked in on us after our food was served, thus my five minute wait for my food.

Pamela's is another PGH institution that doesn't take credit cards, too.  Did anyone wake this city up after New Year's Eve 1993?  I think they might still be sleeping one off, because it's really hard to find restaurants in the other cities I've lived in that don't take credit cards.  (...And the pessimist in me still thinks all these little places are tax cheats and don't want the easy audit trails that come with credit cards.)

The hash browns are definitely winners, but everything else is about 2 stars."}
{"text":"Overrated and you'll end up with an upset stomach much better places in Pittsburgh for breakfast. Just because its known doesn't always means its any good"}
{"text":"So I went here with my family last weekend and was told it was a gem of Pittsburgh and there is no better place to go on a Sunday morning. Then once I got there you immediately see about four photos of Obama which makes you even more believe the place is likely very good. 

With that being said the place is very busy so prepare to wait and they do not allow reservations. This is not a huge deal though unless you have a large group 5+ as the place is large and people come and go quickly. 

Now finally to the food.. it was high quality diner food. The pancakes and the hash browns were the best items I tasted. The omelettes were good but did not stand out from ones you would get anywhere else. Service was also good but they did not have Coke products which always annoys me."}
{"text":"When I came to P&G, I was super curious about these mysterious crepe hotcakes - they were all over the menu, but there was no description! Unfortunately, the only way to really get them was stuffed with cream, strawberries/blueberries/fruit, and loads of sugar. Soooo I decided on the only savory option with crepe hotcakes - the Morning After.  

I suppose this brunch could be for a Morning After a very uneventful, humdrum night. The dish consists of eggs, a short stack of crepe hotcakes, and your choice of meat - bacon, sausage, or ham.  Now, I'm usually not one to  clamor for quantity, but my sausage links had a good 5 inches of empty plate to roll around in, and my scrambled eggs took up maybe 1/3 of the rest of the plate. Alas, quality was lacking as well. The sausages might have come from a Jimmy Dean box, and the eggs were about half a step above airplane fare - bland in color, taste, texture, and generally lukewarm. 

The crepe hotcakes came on a separate plate and the best way to describe them is basically crepes cooked like pancakes. And now I realize maybe that's why they're simply printed as crepe hotcakes without a description on the menu. Duh/doh. The texture of the edges was nice and crisp and it came with a little pat of butter. Otherwise, there wasn't much to distinguish this from a regular pancake. 

I wanted a Morning After that would help me get through the shenanigans of a wedding. I'm not sure P&G's Morning After could convince me to get out of bed even on a regular day. And this is coming from somebody who's usually too lazy to grab a granola bar for breakfast."}
{"text":"Subpar coffee but delicious hotcakes reminiscent of Amsterdam. Excellent service."}
{"text":"Been to Pittsburgh several times and finally made it here for breakfast.  It turned out to be everything it's advertised to be. Not sure what it's like during the week, but on a Sunday morning expect a wait to be seated. We arrived around 10:30 with a party of 3 and was told the wait would be about 40 minutes.  Normally that's a deal breaker for me, but I was on vacation so I decided to wait it out.  They were dead on for the wait time as we were seated exactly 40 minutes later. 

Our order consisted of two Tex Mex Omelettes with the lyonnaise potatoes and The Morning After Special.  The service was friendly and attentive and surprisingly our food was out very quickly considering the volume of customers. The portions were generous and the Omelette's, potatoes and Crepes were all excellent.  Definitely worth the wait!  Only small negative is they are cash only so just be prepared."}
{"text":"Great local diner!!! I have been there twice and was never disappointed. They have fresh press coffee, chorizo featured items (strip district location) and AMAZING \"crepe-like\" pancakes! Great flavor, and exceptional service. I hear it gets packed on the weekends, so plan accordingly for a line out the door! Well worth the wait if you must. Reasonable prices. You can get a huge breakfast for under $10. Everything down to the glasses they serve water in is very tasteful. Thanks Pamela's!!!!"}
{"text":"A wonderful place to reconnect with family before hitting the road for home. I had a perfect straight ahead ham and cheese omelette. And the potatoes were both perfect and generous. I'll go back many more times to work my way threw the menu."}
{"text":"I came here for breakfast around 930AM on a rainy Sunday morning. My group had 7 people so we had to wait shortly for a table. Service was great and food was fantastic. I recommend the hotcakes for a sweet breakfast and the Pittsburgh Hash if you want something savory. Both were delicious. *Cash only*"}
{"text":"So apparently this is the best breakfast in Pittsburgh? Alright! 

Well, it isn't bad. Three stars seems a little low but four feels too high. 

I got Gail's favorite eggs (scrambled eggs with cream cheese and scallions) and they were pretty good. I was hoping the cream cheese and scallions would be blended in, alas, they were just on top. Still a good combo, though. Their famous potatoes really are amazing, definitely the highlight of the meal! 

My friend got the corned beef hash and it was UBER SALTY. Like, super ridiculously salty. I know hash usually tends to have a lot of salt but this was outta control. 

I like that they have rye toast. I don't like that they have Pepsi products and super rude employees. Ya win some, ya lose some, I guess."}
{"text":"I was pretty excited to eat here after hearing all of the hype, and I have to say, I'm pretty underwhelmed. It's possible that I didn't order the right thing; after all, Pamela's is known for their hotcakes, but I wasn't in the mood for a meal that heavy. Instead, I went with two poached eggs, rye toast, and the famous potatoes. The food was decent--there was nothing \"wrong\" with it-- but it wasn't memorable at all. The food was pretty greasy as well, but that's to be expected for this kind of place. I sampled a bit of my friend's hotcakes and they were good but not great. The meal I had was satisfactory, but I wouldn't go out of my way to seek it."}
{"text":"This might be my favorite place in the universe.  I highly recommend this restaurant.  You must put this on your Pittsburgh bucket list.  Pamela's has several locations around Pittsburgh, but this is my favorite.  Be prepared to wait if you come on a weekend morning.  My favorite thing to get is Gail's eggs (which come with cream cheese and green onions), lyonnaise potatoes and crepe pancakes.  I've also had the croissant French toast, which is amazing as well.  You must try the crepe pancakes they are huge, and thing with crispy edges.  Don't forget to bring cash, because this place is cash only.  I wish I could give 10 stars..."}
{"text":"I frequently visit the Pamela's in the strip, but this was my first trip to this one.  It's the same great food.  I love Gail's eggs and the crepe pancakes.  The restaurant is smaller than the strip one.  It's clean and the staff were friendly.  You must try it!  Bring your cash, because it's cash only."}
{"text":"Went here based on yelp reviews. The 4 star rating was spot on. Had the crepe hotcakes (strawberry). They were quite good. Staff was very nice. Warning... cash only."}
{"text":"Great service and really cool area for brunch. The French toast was awesome and the chorizo hash was even better. Pittsburgh never disappoints man. Never."}
{"text":"Whether you're meeting up with old friends or you're just looking for a nice, filling meal, Pams is the place for you.  The friendly staff will serve you up an experience and meal you'll never forget.  If you're an omelette person, the Tex Mex omelette is a choice you cannot go wrong with.  Stop by Pam's sometime!"}
{"text":"Their pancakes are a must order. The pancakes or crepecakes as we called them were awesome. I got the chocolate chip and banana, highly recommended. The crispy edges were a perfect
complement to the center with the fillings. Food comes out quickly. Friendly attentive service. Cash only."}
{"text":"We always stop by when we are in Pittsburgh. The food and service is usually always great. However, this most recent visit was horrible. We stopped by on a Friday morning. It wasn't busy and we got a table right away. Someone got water for the table and then 15 minutes go by and nothing. I had to go the counter to let them know we had been waiting and no one has come to take our order. The lady a spoke with a lot of attitude. She placed our orders and initially, we were fine with just waters and then one of the girls ordered a coffee. The waiter brought over the coffee and someone else decided they wanted coffee as well. Instead of just getting another cup, she said in a very passive aggressive tone \"Is there ANYTHING else that I can get ANYONE at this table?\". We said no at the point. In hindsight, I should've asked for the manager. I saw that our order was done shortly. There server pretended to be busy with other things and let our food sit for at least 5 minutes. She had another server bring over the plates and left mine to sit under the lamp for an additional 5 minutes. I ordered the greek wrap with fries. They gave me the scraps from the bag and my food wasn't even warm by the time I got it. Very disappointed with the service. Hopefully this was a one time thing"}
{"text":"Well this is starting out auspiciously.  The gentleman sitting just to my right facing me is rather hairy, heavy set and wearing a sleeveless shirt.  He keeps stretching his arms above his head.  I've rarely seen this many sleeveless shirts on men....."}
{"text":"I know I am so late to the party reviewing Pamela's. I've lived here for years and been a few times but I'm usually pretty resistant when someone suggests Pamela's because I don't feel like waiting in a huge crowd for breakfast food that is good, but not justified by the wait. 

I have changed my tune...mostly. Two family members in town for a total of four of us around noon on Saturday of Thanksgiving weekend. The wait was about 25 minutes but not much of a problem with all the shopping nearby. I would say the wait they quoted us was pretty much spot on. 

The chorizo hash is the selection here for sure. My sister and I shared an order of that and an order of the plain pancakes. Just the right amount of savory, spicy and salty and definitely way more than enough food for us to share. 

One thing I don't really like is their eggs.....way to buttery tasting. Even without finishing the eggs there was plenty to eat and the taste of the eggs is more a matter of personal preference. 

Cash only...but they make that really clear from the minute you walk in so no one should be caught unprepared."}
{"text":"A wait for sun brunch but so worth it. Service is so nice. Get the corned beef hash and ANY of the hot cake combos:) HUNGER GAMES!"}
{"text":"Wonderful food, good atmosphere.  Excellent potatoes and hotcakes.  Best restaurant breakfast I've had in a long time."}
{"text":"The service was excellent despite the amount of people. We waited about twenty minutes for a table but it was totally worth it. The waitress was pleasant and got us our coffee right away. I ordered the corned beef hash and a bagel. The corned beef hash was so delectable and had just the right amount of corned beef. It is a great place to go to enjoy time with friends. Just remember that it is cash only!!!"}
{"text":"My friend suggested going to Pamela's for brunch when I was visiting by saying \"Obama comes here when he's in town\", so I was obviously game since hey, if it's good enough for the President... There was a bit of a wait when we arrived at 10:30, which is to be expected on the weekends. When we were finally seated in about half an hour, we decided to share the chocolate chip banana hotcakes, Gail's Famous Eggs, and a side of bacon. I also ordered a small orange juice, which I would recommend steering clear from. A small cup is big enough for a 3 year old and the orange juice tasted like 80% tap water, 20% orange juice concentrate. 

The food came out really fast, which was great since we were starving after waiting for a bit to be seated. I thought both plates were really delicious! The hot cakes were definitely a mix of a crepe and a pancake since the edges are thin and crispy and the middle was thicker and softer. Loved the bananas, chocolate chips, and whipped cream filling and really appreciated that they split the dish onto 2 plates for us. The eggs were also really good, but I wish the cream cheese was softer since it was difficult to spread on the eggs. We requested extra crispy Lyonnaise potatoes, which I would highly recommend since I prefer crispy potatoes to mushy ones. I would not recommend ordering the bacon unless you just want a bacon taste in your mouth since the bacon is paper thin, greasy, and not very satisfying.

Overall, I thought everything was really tasty and a great spot for breakfast/brunch, especially if you have any visiting friends or family!"}
{"text":"Pamelas is the place to go for breakfast in Pittsburgh! The service is okay but the food is to die for. They make pancakes tbat are very thin and crepe like along woth nice crispy potatoes."}
{"text":"The food was good, but not outstanding. It is classic diner food. However, the service was great and the prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"Wandered in there today looking for breakfast.  Small but varied menu and generous portions.  Had the Pittsburgh hash ( potatoes, kielbasa, sauerkraut and cheese) with 2 eggs and toast.  Quite good.  But I'm only giving 3 stars because it's cash only and because it's apparently optional for the cooks to wear gloves.  Saw one  gentleman plating food (sausage, bacon, toast) with his bare hands! Major turn off for me, no matter how good the food was."}
{"text":"The breakfast potatoes were quite possibly the best I've ever had.  The omelets were good but look for the specials, they were hidden on the tabletop card.  The list system is great.  Put your name on the list and then explore the strip."}
{"text":"This was my first taste of Pittsburgh, and it was pretty delicious! 

We ordered the Tex Mex Omelette and it super flavorful. I was expecting a little more of a spicy kick to it, but I'm glad it wasn't very spicy. We also ordered the special of the day hotcakes (filled with apples, walnuts, and other stuff- sorry yelpers, I dont remember!). It was my first hotcakes experience, and I was impressed. It basically tasted like apple pie inside of a crepe. The portion sizes are pretty large... we didn't end up finishing all our food. I'd definitely recommend sharing. If I had to only pick one item, I'd definitely pick the Tex Mex again (but I'm more of a savory kind of gal!). 

We arrived a little after noon and we were told it would be about a 30 minute wait. We only waited about 20 minutes for a table- score! The service once we were seated felt a little bit rushed, but they were nice enough and didnt mess up our order. 

Next time I'm in town, I'd visit again!"}
{"text":"Awesome!

Went to Pamela's for breakfast/brunch and it was freaking fantastic. Tons of food at a good price. FAST service! The only thing that took some time was getting a table. We had a decent sized group though and it was noon on Sunday so I don't know how indicative my experience was. But even the wait wasn't too long really. 20 minutes maybe.

I opted for the Tex-Mex omelet. it was very big and tasted great. It came with toast and lyonnase potatoes that I could eat all day. They were so damn good. Nobody at the table was disappointed with what they got. I had a couple bites of the pancakes and they were much approved. I was a little sad I was so full from my food that I couldn't have more of those.

They also serve lunch items (but not on Sundays) which I'm sure are good as well but why bother? Breakfast is where it is at.

Eating at Pamela's is a MUST. Damnit, now I'm hungry for more potatoes..."}
{"text":"After waiting in line for about twenty minutes our group was seated.  The place was completely packed.  It looked like someone's basement or garage with tables in it.  Various photos adorned the walls.  I tried the world famous hot cakes.  They were delicious, except I only ate 1/4 of them since there was a very long hair wrapped around the hot cake.  Pamela's turned out to be a waste of money for me and I left hungry.

There's nothing THAT great about Pamela's.  It's like breakfast at most any other diner."}
{"text":"Pamela's is the best place for breakfast in Pittsburgh. Friendly, fast service, reasonably price, cheeky atmosphere, bottomless coffee, need I say more? Oh yeah I should, the home fries are exquisite."}
{"text":"Love comes in many flavors, and at Pamelas it comes in strawberry. Specifically, strawberry hotcakes.

We came into Pamelas on a Saturday morning and had a bit of a wait at the crowded entrance. We waited about 10 minutes and were quickly seated with an efficient waitress.

When our food arrived I think we died and went to heaven right then and there. I'm writing this review from the Great Beyond.

My husband had the corned beef hash, which I tried and actually enjoyed even though I usually hate corned beef hash.

And me? Oh, I had a plate of wonderful. Strawberry hotcakes.

Biting into one of these is like an epiphany. After all this time, all these years of consuming mushy pancakes with generic syrup, I had the epiphany of truth: this is what breakfast should be.

The hotcakes are somewhere between a pancake and a crepe, crisp on the outside and soft on the inside. Rolled inside were strawberries, cream, and brown sugar. And somehow, even though the serving is gigantic, there is a tinge of sadness, even heartbreak, when it's over. In such a simple meal, I found culinary prowess, peace, and God."}
{"text":"This is a great spot on Sunday even though it's a lil crowded. They have a wide variety of breakfast food .... Omelet a for me. I must say a turn off was the lady coughing that took the order."}
{"text":"Spouse and I wanted lunch while we explored Pittsburgh waiting to catch a ball game.  This place came recommended but a way long wait and not the cleanest place I ever saw - plus tables and people jammed in - we wondered why it would be so popular.  Then we ate the food - fantastic diner grub - the real thing including a gruff but sweet waitress.  We would go back despite the jammed noisy ambience"}
{"text":"Honestly, i think this place is a little overrated. I lived in Oakland for four years (and Pittsburgh in general for 5) and I have tried many more delicious breakfast spots.

The food is okay but I could make it myself at home and make it more flavorful, unique, and for less $. It's just average breakfast food.

The atmosphere is cool, they have all these old board games all over and its a family style type diner, so I can understand the appeal of bringing family or a group of friends here but I have been repeatedly underwhelmed by the food and rarely have felt satisfied after my meal - just full and meh. 

There's usually a super long line each and every time I've tried to go here so it raised my expectations that much more. 

They're also cash only so be aware of that."}
{"text":"Great food and great service! The only thing that I didn't like is that it's cash only so BRING CASH! Other than that no complaints. Their specialty pancakes are amazing but better left as dessert, but definitely a must have if you go here."}
{"text":"Went there for a quick lunch, definitely reminded me of a place you would see on Diners Drive Ins and Dives... despite the ridiculously great reputation this place has for breakfast, I got a P&G Burger special. The burger was standard diner fare, but the onion rings that came with it were delicious and perfectly friend. The jalapeno crisps and burger toppings were perfect and made for a really delicious lunch... I will def be back for breakfast and lunch in the future

do wish they would take debit card, but cash talks in this case"}
{"text":"Their chorizo hash was so good. It was perfectly salty and well done. And the pancakes here are amazing. Get the crepe style hot cakes. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I live 45 minutes outside of the city and the drive is always worth the grub! Because Pamela's is so delicious, there is usually a wait on the weekends but the line moves fast. THEY ONLY ACCEPT CASH! The Walnut Street location has a PNC Bank a few doors down. Enjoy those hotcakes!"}
{"text":"Really like Pamela's and have been to all locations. Was at this location a few years ago for lunch. Unfortunately when I found the piece of steel wool in my tuna sandwich I've not returned until today. Today, lost my order, no wait turned into long wait. I left and went elsewhere"}
{"text":"Food was good, but this place is a madhouse.  Waited an hour or so to get seated, but the food at least was good.  Crepe pancakes were very good and unique...a nice crispy texture, and great filled with strawberries and cream.  The potatoes were also very good, as was the corn beef hash.  Overall, a very tasty little spot, but better when it is not packed with people."}
{"text":"Went to a late lunch, so my daughter ordered the Greek wrap and I ordered the spinach and feta omelette with mushrooms:) it was very good, we split so we could try both. The Greek wrap is full of flavor. The portions are huge and the price is very affordable. We will definitely come back."}
{"text":"I intended on going to the Pamela's on Walnut Street in Shadyside, but this location was much more convenient for me since I even was able to walk here from where I was.

It was just as awesome as I remembered Pamela's to be...even in a different location. I used to love the hotcakes, but this time I passed on them and went for one of the early bird special (before 11am)...eggs, toast, potatoes. I normally leave the potatoes on my plate since i am not a big fan of them, but for some reason I gave them a \"try\". Oh my gosh, they are so addicting! I finished them all up. I meant to ask them what \"lyonnaise\" potatoes were...but whatever they are, they are now my new reason to go back to Pamela's in the future!

Service was decent and I can't wait to go back for my lyonnaise potatoe fix! One thing to note, though, is they only take cash."}
{"text":"Best place for breakfast in this \"oakland\" area. the \"pancakes\" are awesome. the decor is wonderful. we were in pittsburgh 4 days and ended up here for breakfast 3 times. i usually try to spread the food variety around, but it was that good - or maybe a lack of breakfast diners in walking distance. i didnt realize it was a chain until our last visit, but i think this location is somehow different than the rest?

i cant stand yelpers who give 1 star for reasons like \"cash only\"...."}
{"text":"Tasty, good food, sometimes a long wait, CASH ONLY (which is why I gave 4 stars, although I realize this is a business decision)."}
{"text":"I walked over to Pamela's for take out breakfast while I waited for my friends to pick me up for our friend's wedding.

I decided to get the breakfast special -- sausage, scrambled eggs, and regular hotcakes. I waited only 15 minutes for my order and I overheard one of the managers say that Pamela's was featured in People's magazine. Not sure if it was in a past, latest, or  future issue, but it made me look forward to breakfast even more and I definitely thought it lived up to the hype. I quickly gambled up the sausage and scrambled eggs, but those hotcakes were AWESOME! They were thin like crepes and with butter and syrup, it was drool worthy. On my first bite I literally said, \"Hmmm...\" With the breakfast special, if you pay an extra $2, you can get one a stack of the specialty hotcakes (blueberry, chocolate chip, strawberry, or banana walnut).

The only downside of this place is that it is cash only."}
{"text":"I have always enjoyed going here for breakfast/brunch. In my younger years, I would go for the hotcakes. So thin, large, and crispy on the edges. Yummmyyy.

I will write an update to this review...after I go to it again hopefully  next month...But if it is as good as I remember, you won't be sorry going here."}
{"text":"Visiting from DC- easily the best breakfast I think I've ever had! The potatoes are incredible. Would highly recommend the chocolate chip banana hot cakes too. It's cash only but it's worth the wait in line on weekends"}
{"text":"I was incredibly surprised by Pamela's.  I thought the food was good (and unique!), the service was great, and the price wasn't too rough.  I went on a Wednesday morning, and it was relatively empty, but I'm aware it gets insanely crowded on the weekends so you'd have to plan ahead.  Definitely going to stop here again with my parents :)"}
{"text":"Cash only and it doesn't taste nearly as good as other Pamela's locations. I don't know why. But I've tried multiple times and not impressed"}
{"text":"I had to checkout Pamela's because of all the high ratings.  Didn't know they were a CASH ONLY kind of place boo. Come on now who does that.  Didn't know you had to it was metered parking double boo.  Couldn't find the restroom triple boo!? Maybe that ones on me I just couldn't figure it out, outside!?

So how does banana walnut crepes on Walnut Street sound like!? Why not.  I ended up ordering some and they even split the 1 order of crepe into 2 plates and loaded them for us which was nice. Their famous crepes weren't so amazing as I hoped they were barely OK for me, they are just crepes. I would have like to try more the menu but I only had like $10 in bills and coins. And again another place that only takes cash really. I don't get it.  If you're ever here with nothing but $10 in bills and coins you order wisely.  You start looking over their menu and notice wow everything's famous, famous lyonnaise potatoes, famous crepe, famous corned beef hash, famous egg salad, etc. haha.  Don't waste your time with the crepes for about the same price or a little more, you should go for something else on menu, everything's under $10 and inexpensive.  Stretch your dollar and order a soft drinks that has free refills and bottomless coffee or just order a water.  They have lots of different omelets and sandwiches. 

Inside there are a lot of seating, tables and chairs are old and so are everything else about it.  There's a wall of photos in the back wall.  Service was friendly and I had to tip in coins. But I'd try one of the other locations or something else. Other possible MEH but I'll leave it as a OK.

\"18% gratuity may be added to parties over 6\" on the menu, does that mean that if I'm nice enough I don't have to pay?"}
{"text":"Back in Pittsburgh for a short visit.  Wandering around in the strip. Used to live in Squirrel Hill and was a fan of Pamelas so stopped in this location for breakfast. In short:  Cofee - bitter and weak Pancakes greasy and salty [how the hell can pancakes be salty?]. Corned beef hash ridiculously salty to the point of inedible. Service - what service? Total disappointment."}
{"text":"No need to wait -- just get there the next time you are in Pittsburgh. I like the restaurant in the Strip District the best -- cool location and lots going on during the week and weekend.
It doesn't really matter what you get because you're gonna be pleased. The best scenario is that you had a late night and working off a bit of a hangover. Stop here, order a coffee, and then some of their pancakes which are actually more of a crepe or a galette (made with flour and unsweetened). These are thin like a crepe, and don't need any syrup. Get 'em with sausage or bacon. Then turn to your main breakfast. I suggest one of the hashes, either corn beef or a sauerkraut and cheese. Wonderful. The place is bare bone as far as interior, but you're there for the food. Why anyone would go to a chain restaurant is beyond my comprehension -- stop in here instead. Prices are seriously fair and service is good. And if you don't know much about the Pittsburgh accent, you'll discover it year. Yinz are gonna like this place."}
{"text":"I would have to say that I was not super wowed by our experience here.  Customer service was lackluster at best.  While my daughter and I stood at the doorway for 5 minutes, following the sign that clearly stated \"Please wait to be seated\", the man running the cash register barely acknowledged we were there.  I finally asked him if we could sit and he said we could sit wherever.  Our server, however, was nice and got our food out fast.  

The food was okay.  Standard diner fare.  I wasn't in the mood for breakfast as we were well past lunch.  Perhaps I should have tried the famous crepe pancakes but alas I wanted a burger."}
{"text":"I came here upon recommendation from a nearby antique shop owner.  She said Obama likes to eat there you have to try the hotcakes!  So I figured I should listen to the lady and try out some of Pamela's Obamacakes.  We tried the chorizo hash and the banana walnut hotcakes.  Everything was delicious and I am glad we got to split one savory and one sweet dish between us. The service was good as well.  I took away one star because the place could have been a little cleaner (napkins and trash on the floor) and I really don't like when they leave the cream from the previous diners for you to use on the table."}
{"text":"It's prob one of the least healthiest things you can put in your body but the best brunch place in Pittsburgh hands down. It's been there for years. You must get their strawberry hot cake. Their hash is amazing too. Cash only. Bette than Oakland locatiin"}
{"text":"I had the tastiest hotcakes (so thin and crispy and yummy!) and yummiest sausage here. The coffee was also really good. Totally worth the wait on a busy Sunday morning."}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast place will always be DeLuca's, but Pamela's is easier to get to and there are a bunch of locations. The banana walnut hotcakes are my favorite. Their hotcakes are thin and crepe-like, and the edges are always nicely crispy. The corned beef hash is also good. Not as much variety as DeLuca's, but not bad!"}
{"text":"A friend of mine once described good coffee as being \"like sex in the mouth\"; if good coffee is sex in the mouth, then Pamela's is nothing less than the breakfast-climax. Their business card claims that Pamela's is the best breakfast in Pittsburgh; I might dispute that, preferring: Best Breakfast in Pennsylvania or Best Breakfast on the East Coast or Best Breakfast in North America or...well, you get the point. Everything about Pamela's fits neatly into the Utopian breakfast experience: the perfectly rolled Banana and Chocolate Chip Hotcakes, plenty of good, hot coffee, the Lyonaise Potatoes (homefries), the well-lit pink and blue artificial-fifties interior decorated neatly with retro-ish photographs and the pleasant service that rivals that of any diner I've ever been to. So, if you've yet to venture on down to the Strip for an epic breakfast at the newest Pamela's location, I plead with you to make your way down there... as fast as humanly possible."}
{"text":"Whenever I am back in Pittsburgh, I always try to get to Pamela's for breakfast.  There's one in Millville that is easier to get into on a Saturday.  The 5 other places are incredibly popular..Witness most of these current reviews.  The lines to get in are intimidating.  One would think if you waited until 11:00 AM,  it would be better...Nope.

The only pancakes I've ever had like Pamela's can be found at the excellent Original Pancake House chain..Their 49'er pancakes are the equal of Pamela's. 

 Pamela's is unique.  Their hash browns are very different as well.  Almost creamy in texture.  The two women who started this chain came up with these two recipes and it formed the basis of one of Pittsburgh's most successful restaurants.

Hopefully one day, a former cook will give us their recipes."}
{"text":"Awesome place!  It was packed on a Friday morning so I can't imagine what it's like on the weekend.  Place is such a good value.  I got the tex-mex omelet and my brother in law got a bacon egg and cheese on a bagel.  My omelet was HUGE and came with two big pieces of white bread and potatoes.  Bro-in-law loved his sandwich.  My huge omelet was $7 and his huge breakfast sandwich was $4.  Those same two dishes are double that back home in Connecticut.  Only downside is the place is cash only, but for prices like that it's worth it."}
{"text":"We go to Pittsburgh maybe twice a year and we always try to go Pamela's every trip.  This place fills up very quickly and I remember often having to line up to get in.

One of the first things you will notice is that there is a photo of Obama at the cash register right out front.  

Some things to point out before I get to the food is that the washrooms are upstairs through the South American restaurant that shares the same building.  Another thing is that the tables do not move so there is no re-arranging for larger parties.  This place only accepts cash unless they've changed that from the last time I was there it's always been like this at least for this location.

The tables are small considering the amount of plates you will get when you order breakfast.  Really with the coffee and side plates of toast, hash, etc it will be a balancing act to get everything on one plate maybe...  So if you ordered side of sausage or whatever, if you can throw it on your main plate and stack all the side plates if possible.

Now to the food.  It's damn good period.  I mean breakfast is tough because you can really only twist it so many ways so what makes Pam's special?  The crepes and pancakes is what is unique if I had to pick something.  The crepes you can get will walnut and creme and whatever but they ultimately become humongous and if you had something else like bacon and eggs then you will have no room on your table and in your stomach (maybe) because the portions can be big.

I prefer plain pan cakes with butter and syrup and nothing else added myself... their pancakes... the edges are crispy and light but not too fluffy.  

We usually get a side of corned beef hash which is just awesome but wow I try not to think about how much sodium is in it especially since I always get bacon too.

The place has packed for a reason and they're not all tourists because Shadyside is a nice cozy neighborhood.  When locals pack a place consistently the reason is simple... the place is +++"}
{"text":"Okay let me tell you something. When I lived in Shadyside when I was in middle school (around 2002-2004), my mom and I ate a Pamela's religiously. 

Best. Breakfast. Ever.

When I moved back to my hometown Chicago after my 2 year life in Pittsburgh, we tried finding a breakfast place just as good in Chicago. Never happened. It is now 10 years later, nothing better than Pamela's from pittsburgh

I missed Pamela's so much (and pittsburgh in general, sure), that last summer in 2013 my friends and I drove the 8 hours from Chicago to Pittsburgh just so I can experience Pamela's again.

It was just as good as it was 10 years ago - and I told the waitress that myself. 

We will be making another 1-night trip again this summer. They are hooked.


Nothing like Pamelas. Nothing. Oh the memories..."}
{"text":"I live in Colorado, and found this place on yelp.  The hotcakes here are so good that I've now been to Pittsburgh on 2 separate trips, but I've been to Pamela's 4 times.  Even if you've never been a huge pancake fan, you absolutely have to try them, since they are a unique creation that's maybe 2/3 pancake and 1/3 crepe with crispy edges.  I've only had something like this at one other place in the Amana colonies in IA.  Maybe its a Mennonite thing?  The bacon was pretty lifeless, but the sausage links are really good, so I can't count them off any stars for that.  Actually, even if I didn't like the bacon or sausage, I would still come here at every opportunity.  The hotcakes are *that* good.  CASH ONLY!!"}
{"text":"One man's trash is another man's treasure and sometimes one man's 3 star review is another girls 5 star! 

I wanted French toast and I wanted it bad and no frozen French toast sticks would not suffice. At 11:00am on a Wednesday this diner was poppin' to say the very least.

I had French toast with powered sugar only, corn beef hash and chorizo patties. 

I was so pleased with myself for getting the chorizo patties they were spicy and a great kick start to the day.   My corn beef hash was barely on the table for 2 minutes before it was devoured. 

Call me a pig , but one thing that Pamela's in Oakland has over the Strip district local hot co-ed waitresses!!!  

Great greasy food, fast service and cheerful environment."}
{"text":"The long waiting line here seems to be a usual occurrence here at Pamela's diner, but the wait itself isn't too long either as the line does move reasonably fast.

I was glad to have tried their blueberry hot cakes after seeing and reading how hot cakes are signature dishes of this place. I usually don't like having sweet breakfast dish like pancakes or waffles as main breakfast dishes but was glad I decided to try the hot cakes here. To my surprise, the hot cakes were not as doughy or too sweet at all. The corner of the cake was even crispy that it makes the cake not too filling. If I had to choose another filling for the cakes, however, I'd pick strawberry fillings instead of blueberry because with strawberries I think you get fresh ones instead of blueberries like what I had this time which seemed a bit processed.

My SO also ordered some breakfast egg dish with corned beef hash and a side of lyonnaise potatoes. I didn't try his breakfast dish but tried the side potatoes that we ordered...and they definitely were yummy! I couldn't pin point how they got their lyonnaise potatoes so tasty..but maybe with a bit of cream?, onions and some butter? ...I honestly have no idea...I took a bite of the lyonnaise potatoes...and ended up finishing the whole side dish :x..oops..it was that good :)

If you are looking for a good breakfast place in Pittsburgh, check Pamela's diner out. They have 4-5 locations within Pittsburgh. also, make sure you bring cash, as they don't take credit cards! Happy brunching here! :)"}
{"text":"The specialty hot cakes are five stars, the regular hot cakes are four stars and most other items are three stars. The omelettes might be 3.5. The breakfast meat I have consistently found to be unappetizing. This place is definitely a breakfast diner though so don't get ambitious. I've done a couple of rounds of lunch here and have been disappointed. Pretty basic, service is always pretty good, morning wait is long after 8:30"}
{"text":"We had a group of 7 on a Thursday at around 10 am and had to wait about 15-20 minutes. That tells you how popular this place is. It has a great diner atmosphere. The service is very good. The key is that the food is excellent and the price is reasonable. If you are looking for a fun breakfast place, head to Pamela's. Make sure you get there early as most likely there will be a wait."}
{"text":"Cash only people! Placed was packed and long waiting list but it moved pretty quickly. Quick service, big portions and good prices! Food was delicious...with typical diner menu. Not sure what the hype is but it's all good."}
{"text":"If I was just to grade the pancakes, it is a strong 5 star. 
Breakfast was very good, service a little too carefree. 
Luckily, our party of 6 had no wait.
The pancakes are worth it."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place - as proven by convincing my parents to drive 40 mins to get breakfast here during my short visit home to PA.  The food is FANTASTIC and the prices are great too.

As usual, I ordered the strawberry hotcakes (the best ones on the menu IMO!) and my dad followed suit.  The serving was a bit smaller than I remember, but the strawberries tasted deliciously fresh and the hot cakes were warm and fluffy with a crisp crust.  My only suggestion is that the cinnamon could have been a little heavier and more evenly applied.  My side order of lyonnaise potatoes were as perfect as usual - a generous amount of creamy, onion-packed goodness - YUM!

My mom ordered the cheeseburger, and ate more of it than I ever see her eat - indicating it was as tasty as it looked.  I also sampled her fries - which were fantastic - crispy and full of flavor.  My dad gave a big thumbs up to everything as he helped clear anything we couldn't finish.

All in all, Pamela's is TOTALLY worth going out of your way to visit!  Absolutely my favorite breakfast place of any in DC or PA!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic!

The staff is friendly and accommodating. 

It's no wonder why President Obama flew the owners to the white house to cook a hotcake breakfast for him. They are worth traveling for! 

Things they need to work on: 
1) Bacon quality. It is poor. Considering the strip district meat store is right down the street that is perplexing. 
2) Orange juice quality. There are many supermarkets in the city that sell fresh squeezed. The concentrate served here is mehhh. 
3) Cash only????? it's 2016. Get a card machine!"}
{"text":"We came here for breakfast that was just down the street for the hotel we were staying at. There were 8 of us, so the wait was about 20 minutes, but not bad considered how busy the place was.

We were asked several times about drinks, so the wait staff has that locked up, and we were left wondering if that's where they make their money like the bars, idk. I did like the large orange juice that was served in a good size cup. The waitress who took our order also brought us a pitcher of water without us having to ask, which was much appreciated.

I ordered the breakfast special that came with their signature crepe hot cakes. Bacon was good, scramble eggs were good, and hot cakes were good. Nothing really special, but a solid breakfast.

They are cash only, but that doesn't seem to be an issue considering how crowded it was, and also being mainly a breakfast/brunch establishment understandable since it probably won't run you more than $10-15 per person."}
{"text":"Decided to yelp a place for breakfast this morning for my mom & I; and I was not disappointed. We didn't have to wait for a table, and someone came to take our drink & food orders very quickly. We decided to each get eggs, meat and the hot cakes, which were so large, we could have shared them. My mom got the regular hot cakes and I got the blueberry ones (highly recommend). I wish I lived closer, I'd definitely come back. They're cash only though, so come prepared."}
{"text":"I had the crepe style pancakes with chocolate chips and bananas.  They were delicious, and priced very well!  Enough to split and quick to serve, my only qualm is that they are cash only.

It is settled in the busy strip district, but we walked right in on a busy Saturday and they were able to seat us.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"1. it is actually 3.5, I don't think it can be rounded to 4.
2. Tax-Max Omelet was good, generous, filling, will go for it again
3. Coffee was just coffee
4. Juice was fresh
5. Place has a name, could do better
6. Banana Hotcake was good."}
{"text":"There is a reason the president flew the owners of this establishment down to Washington DC to cook him pancakes!  

These pancakes are amazing!

The wait is the only thing that holds this place back from being great. Expect to stand in line for 30 minutes or more on a weekend."}
{"text":"All the positive reviews speak for itself! If you're in the area, you should definately check it out!  The portions are good decent sized -  I went there with a friend and we ended up sharing the Choc chip/banana pancake and the ham and cheese omelette.  Of the diners I've been to, the home fries here have the most flavored. I honestly didn't even have to use the salt. Maybe just a pinch of pepper for added taste.

My only complaint is the limited amt of space in the restaurant. I hope they consider expanding because space is tight!  We went in the only day with winter coats, scarves, gloves and I felt like I had no room to breathe..  Plus, the distance between tables are so close that I ended up putting my coat and all misc stuff on my lap.  The two person tables are so small when you have coffee jug, condiments, syrup, large plates of food, etc etc.  You get the picture..

Overall, I would rate the place with only 3 stars considering all things.. However, the 4 stars reflect the food rating."}
{"text":"Approaching Pamela's and the gaggle of people surrounding, I said to my crew, \"I'll wait. But I won't wait an hour.\"

They told us 30-40 minutes when we put our name in. Guess what? We waited for over an hour. 

I was excited for the crepe-like pancakes. I am typically a savory breakfast eater, but reading about all these crispy buttery edges got me really excited to try something new. 

I got the strawberry pancakes, which were two giant pancakes filled with fresh strawberries with a smidgen of sour cream and brown sugar.

Oy. Too rich. The first one went down easy, but the second was a serious struggle, and was left in pieces on the plate. Even at the inexpensive price of $6.95, I definitely recommend sharing. I wish I had asked for more sour cream to cut the sweetness. Everyone left stuffed, but I'm not sure it was worth the wait."}
{"text":"simple yet delicious! Relatively inexpensive and the hotcakes are scrumptious! Thanks Pamela"}
{"text":"It's quite good.

I've got to high-light the Lyonnaise potatoes.  They are excellent. I've had these several times and they don't disappoint. 

Beyond that, the food is good, the environment is decent, and the servers are nice. Breakfast, of course, is their speciality. There are lots of options to try, like choice of toast:  white, wheat, Italian, or English muffin (Italian is the correct answer!). 

Don't be put off by the hype - this place draws people in for good reason."}
{"text":"Best breakfast/brunch in Pittsburgh! The hot cakes are a must, and if you're looking for a really good time, croissant French toast will rock your tastebuds. 

Service is quick during peak hours - I waited only 20 minutes after putting my name on a list behind 15-20 other parties. 

Solid diner with a cool specialty niche.. Just don't forget to bring cash!!"}
{"text":"Pamela's was awsome I went there just about a year ago exact and I had flapjacks and chorizo   and the food came as soon as we ordered it meaning very fast can't go wrong with it even with an out of towner like myself!"}
{"text":"They might have great food and the best pancakes in the city, but their service is terribly slow. It's also unfriendly not to mention sloppy and dirty. This place used to be a must go to for us, but it'll be a while before we return. The help wanted sign in the front door is an understatement."}
{"text":"Strawberry hotcakes is a must, try the morning after breakfast special with some eggs and meat!! It's very filling so bring your appetite!! If that's not enough try it with their famous potatoes!! It's also got a nice retro vibe, staff seems very friendly as well."}
{"text":"The line is always long on Saturdays and Sundays from 10-12. So expect to wait just a little while if you want to go on those days.
I would say that the food is okay, although I have had better. The service is so quick, which is really nice when I am hungry in the morning.
I should order something that they are known for in order to give them a better rating."}
{"text":"After hearing my boyfriend's woeful tale for years about how heart broken he was when Pamela's stop making buttermilk pancakes we stared clear of Pamela's.  I can't be bothered with a breakfast place that doesn't sale pancakes but after hearing that the Obama's ate at Pamela's I felt it was time he let the pass go.

This was my first time dining at Pamela's.  I really enjoyed the corn beef hash but my French toast was rubbish.  I ordered the American style French toast topped with strawberries.  The strawberries were great but they couldn't mask the nastiness of the French toast.  The Fresh toast was not sweet at all. It desperately needed some powered sugar and no matter how much syrup I added it could not be helped.  

My hubby got the blueberry hotcakes.  We were both expecting pancakes but instead he was served a thin crepe like pancake.  He said that the hotcakes were very tasty and  I could see they were full of fresh blueberries and topped with whipped cream.  

The corn beef hash is worth traveling for, but the thin pancakes and nasty French toast not so much."}
{"text":"Wow, how did i not know about this place when I lived two blocks from it?  I was always a Ritters junky but this place is way cooler.

Super cheap and very fast and friendly service.  Poached eggs were cooked properly.  The home-fries were nice and crispy.  Omelette was packed with spinach and not too much cheese.

A+"}
{"text":"Try the pancakes.  Try the potatoes.  Try everything!  I've been here many times but only for breakfast.  I'm never disappointed.  Even at busier times, the wait staff is very attentive.  

They are a cash only establishment, but several ATMs are nearby.  If you go on a weekend, be prepared to wait.  But it will be worth it."}
{"text":"Pamela's is a local chain that my wife had heard great things about and really wanted to try. I had been once before for breakfast, and overall had pretty good, experiences. 

Me, my wife Carla, and 11 month old son went for brunch, around 11 o-clock. It was Pitt's first weekend back, so there were plenty new college students, their parents, and people who had come into town for the Steelers pre-season game. 

The wait was long, but it seems that Pamela's is known for this and this was to be expected. Initially when I asked about the wait I was told, \"don't worry, no too long.\" 15 minutes later we did have a seat with plenty of space for us and our 11-month old. Everyone was very nice, friendly, and helpful.  For this visit, I tried the Tex-Mex omelet (sans chorizo) which was very tasty, if not presented very nicely. It basically looked like mush but frmo a taste standpoint had just the right blend of salsa, cheese, sour cream, and guac to taste good. Come to think of it, it's probably impossible to blend salsa, cheese, sour cream, and guac and not serve it looking like mush. 

Carla was excited to try the \"hot-cakes\" that all the employee's T-shirts raved about, and she tried the banana walnut. I tried them, too. While I thought they were tasty, Carla's complaint was that they really didn't seem like pancakes at all. I have to agree. They looked more likely slightly thicker and slightly crispier crêpes, right down to being served wrapped in a cyclindrical fashion with the banana and walnut stuffed inside. There was a ton of walnut and banana, though, which was nice. Carla tends to enjoy thick, fluffy pancakes, so they were a bit disappointing. 

Leo had a single scrambled egg, which they were kind enough to make. He seemed to be a fan, which is new since he hadn't enjoyed scrambled eggs, yet. 

The price was reasonable and the service  was friendly, accurate, and prompt. 

Overall, we'd potentially come back to Pamela's, though I might want to try one of the other locations that has been better reviewed. As we're still getting to know the breakfast/brunch scene, this place wasn't half-bad."}
{"text":"I was visiting Pittsburgh with some first timers and had to bring them to Pamela's! I used to live in Squirrel Hill so only went to the location there. I really liked the board game theme at the Oakland location - it made for some fun conversation while waiting for our food. We also enjoyed some Trivial Pursuit Q&A!

Food was delicious. They are known for their Lyonnaise potatoes and crepes, and so that is what I recommended to the group. The lyonnaise potatoes are creamy, oniony, deliciousness. I did wish that mine had more crispy parts - those are my favorite! The crepes are buttery and fluffy in the middle, but with really good crispy edges!

I opted for lunch and made a mistake. I didn't find the club sandwich particularly good. The turkey was thick cut rather than deli meat, but it was kind of dry. They also put pickle slices on top of the bread, which made the bread soggy. 

Everyone else enjoyed their food. In terms of non-standard items, my husband really liked the chorizo hotcakes!"}
{"text":"4.5/5. Best pancakes I've ever had. Service was great and the wait was nonexistent when we went. Wasn't a huge fan of the turkey sausage, but my dining partner said the normal sausage was fantastic. I had the banana chocolate and it was amazing! Will always be a Pittsburgh favorite."}
{"text":"Three waitresses last Tuesday morning were so busy talking that I had to go up to them three times and interrupt ( after politely standing there and waiting for one of them to ask \"May I help you?\" And giving up before interrupting each time)....once to ask if we could order (they then accidentally gave one of our plates to someone else who came in later but ordered the same pancakes), once to ask for more coffee and once to pay....I thought we had to be on Candid Camera it was so ridiculous!  I give them one star because the food was so delicious...  We tried the location on Murray Avenue and the food there was just as perfect along with really efficient and kind service....go to the Murray Avenue location ....line is long for a reason but it moves fast...  The corned beef hash and pancakes are the best anywhere."}
{"text":"Yummy, the crepe hotcakes were delicious!  I got the \"Morning After\" which is two eggs, sausage and crepe hot cakes.  I was told this is a must go to in Pittsburgh and I have to agree.  I was stuffed after this.  My gf got the veggie omelet and she said it was so so.  It's all about the crepe's here really."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast.  Got the trash hash and was a solid start to the morning.  Food tasted great.  Very busy but worth the wait."}
{"text":"I had a great experience at Pamela's. The brunch (creamy but delicious) was one of the best in Pittsburgh. It's a great place with a family-like decoration. Very good brunch for a lazy Sunday."}
{"text":"Usually goes to the one in the strip. But we got out late and we know it is gonna be an over an hour wait if we go to the strip, plus it's hard to find a park over there. This location is on no wait, you can put down your name prior to arrival, which can save you 10-15 minutes depends on your location. When I got on no wait, it says 20 minutes wait so I put our name down. Check in was easy because we got there early, we waited for another 5 minutes. Pancake is always a must have! Potato was good too. The bacon is always my least fav here. Too thin, they should get strip meat store's bacon. Ah, some fresh squeezed juice, Then this place would be prefect!"}
{"text":"There was a lot of hype about this place....we went early b/c you have to... if you don't want to wait....
The hash was awesome.
The pancakes were excellent.
Service was friendly and responsive.  They probably do not have to be b/c the place will get customers either way...but they were above average.
Everything was good about this place.  It is popular and now we know why.
Cool pictures/photos throughout the restaurant.  Overall nice feel...

It is also located in a unique area of Pittsburgh.  The Strip District has a lot to offer and this place compliments it nicely.  

Highly recommended as a place to stop and enjoy. 

The staff makes an effort to give you good food, good service and the owners have kept the price reasonable."}
{"text":"First time here but so glad we had breakfast there. Get there early, tables fill up quickly and the line gets long.  

Had the pancakes with a side of the hash.  The pancakes are light, thin and have a sweetness to them - no syrup required.  Best pancakes - a must if you have breakfast here.  The hash was also tasty - perfectly seasoned and fried crispy.  

Service was quick and our server was friendly."}
{"text":"I thought everyone was exaggerating before. They're not. It's the best pancake ever. Thin and crispy edges but fluffy and buttery. Perfection."}
{"text":"Great little breakfast nook in the Burgh. Make sure you bring cash, no cards. Lots of character in the building, located at the end of Pittsburgh's strip district. Expect a wait, but the breakfasts are worth it!  50's diner atmosphere is fun! Very casual."}
{"text":"We stopped for brunch before a Pitt basketball game on a Saturday morning. When we decided to eat here i knew i had to try the hot cakes i had heard so much about. We both ordered the \"Morning After Special\". 2 eggs, 2 hot cakes and sausage links. The hot cakes were so unlike any I had ever had. Thin, crispy edges and they lived up to the hype! I really enjoyed them! Fun decor with quick, friendly service at a very reasonable price.

FYI... CASH sales only!!"}
{"text":"Thank God for coffee! especially when it's cold!
It's good diner food but nothing really to run out and crow about! It's solid short order food with nothing terribly standing out!
When you arrive at the diner be ready there will be a wait; what feels like an annoying way to long for what your getting on your plate wait.
When you are seated the servers are busy, super busy and yet they find a way to be courteous and are on top of it at all times. I have never had a problem with the servers and they are very helpful when needed.
As I have pointed out at the beginning of the review there is nothing really to crow about here. It's dinner food with the potatoes cooked in a large batch which means that your Lyonnaise potatoes are very hit and miss. Sometime you get a well cook morning potatoes tender and tasty then on the other occasions you end up with a lump of semi cooked not so tender kinda cold mess.
The rest is relatively blase and as I said standard diner food... One major disappointment was the \"pancakes\". I was ready for light n' fluffy golden goodness ready to soak up some syrup and fill my belly. Instead I was greeted with crepe style more Nordic pancakes. So for those of you who love a traditional fluffy golden pancake you will be met with disappointment. Also the last couple of times I've gone in their pancakes have had a heavy baking soda flavor present. 
Now I know this place is a Pittsburgh favorite with pictures on the walls when you first come in showing even President Obama ate there. I can tell you that it's serviceable diner food nothing really stands out and makes me go WOW! Which leads me to believe this place used to be the bomb diggity but now is primarily getting by on reputation alone.
It's worth the visit to say you've been but not the repeat as it's just another diner with just another plate of odd pancakes and run of the mill food."}
{"text":"Brunch is my favorite meal of the day, so of course I was scouting for a nice spot for our first morning in Pittsburgh. Per the suggestion of my co-worker's [native] friend, we decided to check out one of the Pamela's locations. We knew we found it when there was a large crowd waiting in front of it. It was a bit deterring but the restaurant was so highly suggested that I wanted to go for it anyway. Turns out, the wait was only 20 minutes long. When there's a crowd that big outside of popular Atlanta eateries, it's usually at least an hour and a half wait! Twenty minutes gave us enough time for a casual stroll around the block and back.

There are two seating areas inside - the game room, and.. the other room. Not sure what it's called, but we were seated in the gaming room and I was glad. This room is very interactive, with old, classic board games pinned up on the walls, as well as classic trivia / card games on the tables for patrons to play with. Talk about nostalgia! Guess Who, anyone?

Looking around after we all ordered, I noticed that a LOT of other people were leaving without finishing their meals. I figured that either the food wasn't good or the portion sizes are monstrous! Seeing as how packed the place was, I assumed the latter.

Food wise, I was actually a little disappointed, at least in what I ordered. They're apparently pretty famous for their hotcakes, even Obama likes 'em! So my mind was made up and I ordered the banana walnut hotcakes. The insane amount of crushed walnuts inside ended up making everything taste really try. And their portion size is indeed massive. My order came with two giant hotcakes, of which I could only stomach one. The beau ordered the tex-mex omelet which I thought was delicious! We both agreed that they could have done with a lot less salsa though. Definitely get the lyonnaise potatoes as your side. The other guys ended up ordering the other items I considered getting, so I got to mooch off them. :)

Warning: cash only!"}
{"text":"Waiting outside in the cold, super-hyped up place that all the politicians are obliged to visit, multiple locations:  all of these are factors that made me question whether this was in fact a legitimately delicious establishment.  But believe me, it was.  

All of the following were simply perfect, up there with the best I've ever had:  
- Pamela's signature crepe-like hot cakes of buttery goodness, crispy on the edges, yet flavorful, just perfect by their lonesome, or with fruit or chocolate 
- Turkey sausage:  no casing, pressed down like latkes until a deep medium brown, super flavorful, almost rich, nicely spiced 
- Fries:  They must be beer-battered.  They were not greasy, perfectly crispy, lightly salted, just perfection.  I ate all of them and there was a serving the size of my head.  And I have zero regrets.  
- Corned beef hash with Lyonnaise potatoes:  It's the corned beef hash I dream of.  Perfectly salted, with small cubes of potatoes and onions, and corned beef.  

I can't speak to the veggie omelet though a member of my party ate that.  The veggies looked like they might be frozen veggies, but come here for more of a splurge.  Because it's worth it."}
{"text":"Pamela's is good strip district greasy spoon diner food.  Sometimes it has a long wait; expect that.  The hot cakes are crispy and delicious, certainly the best thing on the menu.  Most of the food here, as well as the coffee, is adequate.  

I prefer DeLuca's but this place is still a Pittsburgh institution."}
{"text":"Love love love brunch at Pamela's! Go early,, prepare to wait in line. The food  is fabulous.


The staff are friendly, efficient.   Best place for brunch in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"One of the worst breakfast experiences I have ever had.  This was recommended to me by someone whom I thought was my friend, he is dead to me now.  The eggs were clearly some kind of powdered or boxed egg product.  The bacon was that precooked paper thin junk that you microwave and serve at a school cafeteria.  I should have know from my first sip of their almost undrinkable instant coffee that this was a bad decision.  Please learn from my mistake and save yourself a stomach ache."}
{"text":"We came here based on a recommendation and the fact we needed to go to the Apple Store a few doors down.  We put our names in and had to wait about 30-35 min.  Large group waiting meant this was good to go! Staff was very friendly and fast.  We ordered and the food was there within 10 min.  Very impressed.  I ordered a stuffed hot cake with blueberries and it came out looking like a crepe which I loved.  The resin was that the hot cakes were stuffed with blueberries.  Definitely got your money's worth here.  Portions were not to bad or I learned my lesson from the day before.  Price was also very good too! They also have a location in the Strip District.  I recommend!"}
{"text":"By far my favorite pancakes in town. They make them very thin and crepe-like with crispy edges and roll your ingredients inside. I always get the morning after breakfast special with chocolate chip banana cakes and have yet to ever leave hungry. Always great service and always a pleasure."}
{"text":"I came here on a Sunday around Noon.  Part of me says my experience may be skewed because of the busy time I visited, but, the former-server part of me says that if at this point you haven't figured out how to handle a rush, you never will.

A friend and I visited and were sat within 10 minutes.  The waitress came over in a few minutes and took our order.  Easy enough.  After that, we never saw her again.  A man with rubber gloves on served us our hotcakes and potatoes first.  A few minutes later i received my eggs and the check was also dropped off.  I realized right away that I needed more napkins and some hot sauce but our waitress never got within earshot.  I wasn't able to flag down anyone else so after 5 minutes I walked over, took a hot sauce from the counter and took some napkins from the server station where they roll silverware.  Good thing we didn't drink all of our water.

When we were done we took our check up to the counter.  I noticed a line item on our check under bacon that said \"WD .75\".  The girl behind the register didn't know what it was and she took it off.  My guess was that it meant \"Well Done $.75\".  I did ask for my bacon crispy, which it really wasn't and I was upset that I was going to be charged money to leave it on the griddle for another 30 seconds.  I wonder how many people they get with that one.

The food was ok.  It was diner food.  Nothing more, nothing less.  I did like the crepey-hotcakes but I remember them being cooked slightly less crispy last time which made them a bit more tasty.  My scrambled egg whites were sitting in water (which didn't help my bacon retain its mediocre crispiness).

For a better greasy spoon experience, I recommend Dor-Stop in Dormont or for a cafe experience I recommend Coca in Lawrenceville."}
{"text":"Pamela's is kingly diner food. When I'm back in the Burgh, this one of my favorite spots. 

- Atmosphere and decor is a cool, '50s Americana-style
- Great diner breakfast: pancakes, french toast, bacon, coffee, etc
- Line can be long on the weekend, which is a testament to how good it is
- Been here dozens of times, never had an issue with the staff"}
{"text":"HELLO BREAKFAST! This place rocks socks off. There is always a wait but it is worth every minute. I chose what I was getting by simply looking around. Everything looked delicious. I need to go back for the pancakes or should I say crepecakes. Oh, and this place is PACKED yet the service is still good. Impressive if you ask me. 

See ya there next Sunday!"}
{"text":"This place is very touristy in a weird non touristy part of town.  The food is ok but the portions are GINORMOUS!  And I don't get why the line stretches?  It's just eggs and bacon people. . .The staff is always very nice but I feel like there are other options.  Not my first option for breakfast"}
{"text":"Been to the one in Sq. Hill were there is often a line in the morning on nice weekend days. I've only been there when there was no line and I despise myself each time I finish my food thinking \"I could have gone home and put extra scoop of lard on my eggs and it would have cost less than 1/4 of what I payed at Pamela's\"."}
{"text":"We went here Sunday February 4th for breakfast around 11am...just fantastic...even the guy bussing tables was friendly and happy!  I had the pancakes and sausage and my girlfriend had the chorizo hash and eggs...both were amazing...served hot and reasonably fast..."}
{"text":"The breakfast special here should be enough for most people. The pancakes are great. The service is generally very good too. The only bummer is the lines for this location (and all Pamela's locations in fact) are super long around brunch/lunch times."}
{"text":"Not that I've had a whole lot of chocolate chip banana hotcakes in my life, but Pamela's made me wish I had. Holy chocolatey, bananaey, and hotcakey goodness! A quirky brunch place in Pittsburgh, it's filled mostly with locals. I like that. One of my friends took me here and I could see why it was his favorite brunch place in Pittsburgh. Clearly he wasn't alone in this. The service was great. The place had a great dive-type feel, not quite a restaurant, not quite a diner; it was its own entity. I like that too. It's affordable too. Really pleased with this place. I'd definitely go back."}
{"text":"I was in Pittsburgh for 11 days and i wish i found this place sooner!!! I had the morning after breakfast.... ahh the Potatoes are so addictive, like amazing, the hot cakes are like a so different i wish there was a Pamela's diner near me, i would be a regular."}
{"text":"first of all: this joint is cash only.  i'm one of the only people on the planet that thinks this is a mark of a place that will be pretty amazing (likely run by old people).  but, there you go.

the omelets here are fantastic -- filling and soft without any rubbery consistency ever.  my personal fave: the western omelet; i'm a traditionalist.  i've never had the crepes, but they do look delicious.

as another reviewer mentioned, they do give you a coffee carafe so you can top off your own mugs...definitely convenient for both you and your usually somewhat overextended waitress.

i'm sure the 50s decor is a hit with the vintage crowd.  who knows?  i'm happy to just look at pictures of cars by the cash register.

overall, this is a spot where i've always been happy with my meal and have a hard time parking my truck (it's the strip, after all).  

if you're in the strip, skip deluca's and hit up this pittsburgh institution...unless you're on the lam, since there are always rad motorcycle policemen eating in the side room."}
{"text":"I came here at around 10am for Sun. breakfast with my parents about a year ago when they were visiting PGH. I ordered the blueberry and sour cream filled crepes, and they were delicious!  My mom ordered the strawberry hotcakes and I forget what my dad ordered, but they enjoyed theirs very much, as well. The food here is diner food, so it is on the buttery/greasy side, but the pancakes are consistently good. 

The decor is board-game themed, which added a playful element to the experience of eating here.  I believe we waited about 10 min. to be seated, and I don't have any complaints about the service.  This place accepts cash only, so remember to hit the ATM before coming.  Having Sun. breakfast here was a great ending to a fun weekend, as well as a way to introduce my folks to one more unique PGH eatery!"}
{"text":"How good can breakfast potatoes be? You have no idea. Of the two days we spent in Pittsburgh, we ate here twice. Also loved the pancakes, better than the French toast. Worth the wait."}
{"text":"The strawberry hotcakes are the best and i'm not a fan of pancakes. The waiter recommended the home fries well done as a side and im glad he did. Never thought homefries can be so special. I gave it 4 stars because we were constantly waiting, either to get a table or to get our food. Definitely a must if you're in the Pittsburgh area. Great and fun decor of old school board games!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately I had a very negative experience today at Pamela's.  The \"gentlemen\" running the register was unbelievably rude and made me feel like an idiot.  He spoke to my friend and I in clipped tones, gave us the wrong change but quickly caught his mistake, but made us both feel like we were complete fools.

I won't likely go back here for some time due to this treatment."}
{"text":"This place is no joke!  Wow we shared the corn beef hash and strawberry pancakes.  We ate way past the point of full because it tasted so delicious.  Great service too.
Don't forget to bring cash"}
{"text":"An okay breakfast diner, but nothing to be excited about.  The decor, however, is annoying and not at all conducive to relaxing and enjoying the meal.  Much too much fake nostalgia."}
{"text":"I have been going to Pamela's for a long time now and I honestly have not found a better diner in Pittsburgh. The food here is amazing, the service is very quick, and it has a very old Pittsburgh diner feel. No frills, cash only. DEFINITELY my kind of place. And when you order coffee, you get your own little warmer for quicker refills - a VERY nice touch.

This morning I ordered the veggie omelet with no tomatoes or mushrooms (they use canned mushrooms - not a big deal, but just not my preference), Italian toast, and the famous Lyonnaise potatoes. It was a perfect post-5k breakfast for sure. Although I didn't have their pancakes this morning, they are pretty incredible. You can also get some gourmet options with pancakes, my favorite being the chocolate chip banana crepes. 

Seriously, you cannot go wrong here with anything you order."}
{"text":"It came highly recommended that we eat at Pamela's while we were in Pittsburgh for the day.  If the Obama's like it, it must be good! ;)

David ordered the Strawberry hot cakes and I ordered the homemade Corn Beef Hash.  David didn't even know was CBH was!  Mom used to make it for us as kids....out of the can....so I haven't had it in ages!  Seeing it as homemade on the menu definitely grabbed my attention.  He's hooked now!  The Hot Cakes were all they're made out to be and the CBH definitely filled us up.  Don't miss Pamela's while you're visiting.  OR YOU'LL BE SORRY!"}
{"text":"Pancakes and potatoes are by far the best, but omelettes are also pretty good. Definitely worth the long wait!"}
{"text":"Beat breakfast in Pittsburgh. I know there is another place with that on their sign but I'll take Pamela's any day!!"}
{"text":"let me start off by saying i am not a big fan of pancakes..ANY pancakes. now i am sure these are exceptional, but yeah - just not a fan.

because of my above feelings, i confirm that pancakes aside, everything else on the menu here is amazing.

i have gotten omelettes, the chorizo special, and lunch sandwiches - all excellent. in fact, the biggest problem with this place is it's so hard to decide what you want...

the service is also friendly and attentive, making the 20-35 min weekend wait well worth it."}
{"text":"Another must stop when I'm in Pittsburgh. Usually seat yourself on the weekdays, but CASH ONLY (hence the 4 star rating). 

Similar to a greasy spoon, but with more creative and tasty food. Get the crepe pancakes to share with the table - DELICIOUS, thin pancakes! The edges have a different taste (crispier) than the middle, but all of it is just amazingly delicious."}
{"text":"um ridiculously good and so quick and filling. I shared the hotcakes and got a side of eggs and sausage. need both my sweet and savory. This place totally hit the spot.. 930 am SAT morning. um yah, a  short wait witha group of 5+ a toddler seated in about 10 min ! woot 

The crepes (hot cakes) are delicious her signature one with the strawberries is the bomb. also, eggs, crispy bacon toast not bad either. Came here for breakfast while visiting family in the area and really enjoyed the meal. Only draw back is parking sucks the lot is ridiculous and street parking is hard because of the traffic. Also cash only.. sort of annoying.. but would totally go back and recommend to all ."}
{"text":"Pancakes!  What can I say, but pancakes, pancakes, and more pancakes!  Because I'm a type-1 diabetic, I have to plan before and after if I eat a meal here!  Pump that insulin, Susan, pump!  I have to watch the carbs when I eat here.  But Pamela's has the best pancakes in Pittsburgh!  

But if for some reason my BGs are acting wacky--and believe me, they do--there are plenty of other dishes to order here.  I like their eggs, including plain ol' scrambled eggs and fried eggs.  The coffee here is decent, but if you order during off-hours, it can be a little burnt.  Yes, the wait times here are legendary, but if ya want eggs or cakes, this place is it!"}
{"text":"Wow, what a great breakfast.  A little bit of a wait on a Thursday morning, the day after a U2 concert and the morning if a playoff hockey game.
The pancakes are really different, they call the crepe style, so kind of halfway between a crepe and a pancake, with crispy edges.  I got the strawberry one, very good but I could actually taste the sugar granules in the sour cream filling.
The eggs were solid, the bacon fantastic!!"}
{"text":"So far I've been to the Shadyside and Oakland locations and this one is by far my favorite. There is usually a shorter wait, but the food has always been better in my opinion too. I usually feel satisfied and happy after eating here, while the other location usually leaves me feeling pretty bloated. 

Today I got brunch with a few friends and we ordered the strawberry crepes, chocolate chip banana crepes, lyonnaise potatoes, and Tex-mex omelette. The omelette was absolutely amazing!! I love potatoes too so I would highly suggest that dish. The crepes are a bit too egg-y for me, but they are also a staple dish to order here.

Overall, Pamela's isn't somewhere I'd usually lean towards going to and there are many brunch spots in the area that I prefer, but.....
It is definitely a must-visit stop in the city and never a disappointment!"}
{"text":"Good food, cooked well, came out hot. Service was also very good. Waitress came back to top off coffees more than once. Prices also good, but cash only. Wouldn't wait if a really long line, but definitely would go early to get a better than average breakfast out."}
{"text":"Went here in late summer on a weekday and it was fantastic. Pamela's and DeLuca's go back and forth in battle for best breakfast in the city. There's not much to this place. Just a simple diner but the food is out of this world. 

I had a bacon cheese omelette, the wife had French toast and my son had the short stack of pancakes. With two coffees and a chocolate milk, the bill came to $31.00. It's a CASH ONLY establishment so be prepared. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Interesting crepe-like pancake! Definitely tasty but overly salted and oily too. We waited for 20-30 minutes but the wait for worth it. Obama flew the chef over to make him pancakes!"}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday and the wait for our food after we got seated was long. I got the broccoli cheddar inlets and it was good (3.5/5). We got a chocolate chip banana hotcake as well and it was reaaaaaaaal good! (4/5). For my overall experience, being a visitor to the city, id say this is an okay place to go for brunch but I feel like there's got to be better out there"}
{"text":"Patrons from all over Pittsburgh come to enjoy Pamela's thin and delicious pancakes, huge servings of home fries and three egg omelets - and they should.

The first of the Pamela's family, this Shadyside staple has been around long before owners Gail Klingensmith and Pamela Cohen decided to branch out across Pittsburgh.  Since 1980, Pamela's has been voted \"Best Breakfast\" by Pittsburgh's City Paper survey.  Not to mention the diner's modest flare received the White House's \"Presidential approval.\"  

In the fall, while President Obama was on the campaign trail, he ate breakfast at Pamela's.  He loved the crepe-style pancakes so much, he asked Klingensmith and Cohen to prepare a Memorial Day breakfast at the White House for him and dozens of American troops!  Now, that's a good pancake!

I've sampled just about everything on the breakfast menu and, after eight years of patronage, my favorite is still the strawberry hotcakes.  These thinly poured crepes are laid flat, then rolled around a delicious combination of strawberries, brown sugar and sour cream, topped off with a nice dab of whipped cream to truly send your sugar levels through the roof.  They're simple, delicious and just enough not to feel \"stuffed.\"

The egg and omelet plates come with home fries (chunky sliced potatoes with what appears to be approximately 1/4 small white onion and a 1/2 lb of butter per serving) and your choice of toast.   The spinach and feta omelet with rye is a decent combination.  But as a warning, these plates are not for the weak.  

For smaller appetites, they do offer fresh fruit bowls, egg white plates and a variety of a la carte items.  

The space is typical of older Walnut Street buildings with typical diner flare - simple painted brick with tables bolted to the walls.  On weekends, the room get's pretty cramped.  (A note to parents with small children: if you have large strollers, it may be a good idea to either leave them in the car or ensure they pack neatly in the corner.)  If you get there around 11:00 a.m. the wait can run you about 30 minutes or more, and there's literally one small bench to sit at while inside.  Weekday crowds are much lighter.  

Parking can be found on the street, or in the metered parking lot located behind the building.  There's no need to feed street meters on Sundays.  

All in all, this diner is a classic.  It's managed to outlive a lot of other local businesses while the larger corporate chains have moved on the street.  Perhaps it's the presidential influence, perhaps because it's \"cash only,\" but I think it's because the food is good, down-home cooking."}
{"text":"Pamelas was recommended by our hotel staff and located in the heart of Pitt University's food and bar strip. We had a big family breakfast before my cousins wedding.  It was tight, but they were able to accomodate our group of 13.  There wasn't much space between tables even beforehand (pet peev)
 I had an order of hotcakes, bacon ($8.50) and their prize Lyonnaise potatoes ($3.25). I was super excited about the potatoes as they sounded so good...  After the meals were coming out I saw that the stuffed crepes & omlettes  looked really good. Hmm... shoulda...  My meal was good, but not great.  I  wanted the creamy, oniony, lemon potatoes with a dollop of sour creme that I had envisioned, but received the typical side of home fries. I'm still waiting.. :(...
There was plenty of street parking available at 9am on  Saturday morning.  We walked from our hotel a few blocks away.  Pamelas didn' t accept credit cards, so good thing I had my emergency $20 in the wallet.
Maybe I ordered the wrong dish, but wasn't impreased.  The food was filling and not overly priced.  Based on their location and high recommendations I expected either their presentation, ambiance or flavor to be out of this world.  They delivered a good breakfast, but nothing more...."}
{"text":"Food was amazing. The waitress, on the other hand, forgot about us while we sat around for thirty minutes waiting to get our orders in. When we eventually went looking for her, she was counting her tips behind the counter. She gave great service after we found her. Just a little common courtesy goes a long way."}
{"text":"YES! If you are doubting your choice, you must say YES! Cash only, typically a wait, but you gotta go! MUST MUST MUST. 

We went on a Sunday morning pretty early--like 8 AM or so and we had to wait. But they move quickly and have a TON of space. It was kinda loud, but not horrible--definitely a diner atmosphere. The tables were close together, but it wasn't to the point of being uncomfortable.

Enough about the atmosphere, the FOOD. Everything was FANTASTIC. We ordered an array of menu items and everything was great. Make someone in your party get the crepe-style hotcakes because they were soooo yummy! I had the banana and chocolate chip ones and it was just enough toppings, but not too much. My brother-in-law had a hash and I tasted it and it was to die for. Yum yum yum! The potatoes in there just melted in your mouth. You must get the potatoes also! So good. I can't wait to head back to Pittsburgh to have breakfast here again. Worth the wait!"}
{"text":"LOVE this place!! My first time in Pittsburgh and I'm glad we got to go here. Service was great, food came out fast and was so good. I got the banana and choc chip hot cakes, very good. My husband got the malted waffle and my sister in law got the egg salad sandwich, both very good! If I ever come back to Pittsburgh I will def come back here!!"}
{"text":"Delicious, greasy breakfast food.  Mediocre to good service, depending on the day, time, and server.  Large portions."}
{"text":"Pamela's is a Pittsburgh staple, so I felt like I had to go. I went to get some hotcakes, and had a hard time deciding between the three. I went with the banana walnut (since it sounded the healthiest) and it basically reminded me of the crepes at Bob Evans. I wish I had gone to the one in the Strip to get the most Pittsburgh-y experience, but I'm glad I can finally say I got to go to Pamela's after growing up in Pittsburgh and having never gone."}
{"text":"Unbelievable.  Everything is amazing but the hot cakes will be the best you've had.  End of story."}
{"text":"I already feel defensive about my 3 star rating. Obviously, I'm not a native Yinzer. I am a born bruncher though and for me, Pamela's was a good experience and just about that. Perhaps the 45 minute wait on a weekend made my expectations skyrocket. I ordered the Gail's eggs and they came out good. Nice bread, well done scrambled eggs and ok-hash browns. Great coffee! The service is really good for how crowded the place is. The hot cakes are really soft and yummy. You know a place is old school when they are cash only and it takes a 10 minute wait at the cash counter to pay ones check! You have to tick the box if you haven't been here, if nothing else but to experience a traditional local joint.. but now that I have, a couple times.. I could quite easily pass up Pamela's for other brunch options in the strip."}
{"text":"I love this place, I usually get the strawberry crepe pancakes.  The place is always packed but the wait is usually quick and the service is always fast.  I always recommend this place to visiting friends. The have one of the best breakfasts around.  I've eaten lunch here too, which is also great."}
{"text":"A fantastic place to grab brunch on a weekend! 

We tried the special Banana Walnut Hotcakes and that was sooo delish! We also ordered the Corned Beef Hash and Eggs and that Corned Beef was even better than the ones from Le Peep back in NJ!

SO wish we had a Pamela's back home and the prices in Pitt was VERY cheap comparing to NYC and NJ!  

PS: This is a CASH-ONLY place and setting is very much like a diner, but AWESOME food. ENJOY!"}
{"text":"We have to go to Pamela's every visit to Pittsburgh.  The problem is, I can never order anything other than the strawberry hot cakes.  Other family members got regular breakfast items and they were very pleased.  The line to be seated was really large but worth the wait.  It's loud, it's crowded but it's Pamela's!"}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast!!!  Be prepared to wait unless you're there right when it opens.  It's so good, I went for breakfast two days in a row.
First day I went with \"The Morning After Breakfast Special\" with some blueberry hotcakes.  Fresh cut ham was great, but those hotcakes were super!
Next day I went with the \"Famous Corned Beef Hash and 2 Eggs.\"  I thought nothing could beat the previous breakfast, but I was wrong.  My gosh, the hash was heavenly!  I also ordered the strawberry hotcakes, too.  They were good, but I prefer the blueberry.
Definitely worth the walk and wait.  Wait staff VERY friendly!"}
{"text":"A delicious breakfast spot in Pittsburgh that is worth a visit if you are in town.

My mom remembered this as the best pancakes she has ever had and they definitely did not disappoint. The signature pancakes are thin and crispy which is how we love them. If you are looking for big and fluffy this is not the place!

I also had the chorizo hash and it was amazing. I didn't realize it had cheese when I ordered it or I would have had them omit it, I prefer all the other flavors to shine over the cheese but that is a personal preference.

Make sure you bring cash as they do not take other forms of payment."}
{"text":"I think the person who said that breakfast is the most important meal of the day had Pamela's Diner in mind. I had a sausage and cheese omelette with banana and walnut crepes and home fries. I feel a food coma coming on. Easily in the top 5 of best breakfast spots in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast with my cousin the day after he had some sort of tour of the University of Pittsburgh. Overall when walking in... We were waiting in a line with a bunch of people. No one there, not even the guy standing and staring blankly at us from the front decided to tell us there was a paper wait list we had to sign in on to get seated. Not intuitive.. It was on a small sheet of paper off to the side. 

Then he offered us seating next to the front insisting it was better where the cold wind blew in every time the door opened (I'm not stupid, I graduated kindergarten). If I say I want to get on the list and wait, put me on the damn list..... Anyways finally got seated after wasting half an hour of my time (not to mention he skipped 2 people ahead of us in line and I called it out..!). 

When the waitress came, I asked her for recommendations and she had nothing to say... Nothing special or interesting at this place so I just ordered my food. Serving size for cost was good. Quality was \"good\" at best. Food came out quick and hot which I liked a lot. 

See pictures for serving sizes. I got a hotcake and grilled cheese with a side of potatoes."}
{"text":"We ordered the Tex Mex omelette and the pancakes.
The pancakes were horribly oily and tasted ok . Very unhealthy and heavy. 
The omelette was stuffed with chorizo which was also average. 
I dint think this place was that great. Quite below average. Even in spite of the rush, the food came out quick.  But I'll try the other ones the next time."}
{"text":"The banana chocolate chip pancakes are the ultimate evolution of the pancake. Not since mankind first invented batter has their been a more revolutionary flavor experienced by a breakfast-seeking individual. These compliments are coming from someone who actively avoids breakfast and doesn't take pancakes very seriously. This endorsement could not come from a harsher critic of breakfast.

In other news, the corned beef hash is very good. The service is friendly and the space is nice. Protip: Go when they open to avoid the line because they fill up fast."}
{"text":"45-60 minute wait on a Sunday morning, just like I remember it from college. Put our name on the list, browsed up and down Penn, and then had ourselves a nice breakfast. I had waffles with bananas... So good!

Long line, good greasy diner breakfast. Can't go wrong."}
{"text":"We saw this place on the television so we figured since we were in Pittsburgh we would have to check it out. 

There was a small wait to get in because they are so busy. We waited about 30 minutes which isn't really that bad. I have waited at Cheesecake factory with that wireless buzzer longer than that. HaHa

We were seated and placed our orders. The place is decorated like it's the 1950s. The picture on the wall by our table was of a 5-6 year old girl holding a shotgun in black and white. It was actually kind of funny. 

The service was great, our waitress chatted with us a bit about the history, answered all our questions, didn't get annoyed (we were asking a lot of questions) and always had a smile. 

The food literally melted in my mouth, OMG was it good. I plan on going here every time I visit Pittsburgh. You have to check it out if you get the chance."}
{"text":"I can't justify any reason to give them any less than a perfect rating. I went on a very busy Sunday with my boyfriend and his mom and his moms boyfriend, and they found a table for us right away despite being packed. I was starved and anticipating it would be awhile until we got our food since there were so many people, but they prepare very well for the crowd because we barely waited 10 minutes after we ordered until all 4 of our meals arrived very hot and DELICIOUS! I got the veggie omelette which was so good. The veggies were all fresh and the eggs were cooked great. And the potatoes. Oh my gosh. One of the best sides you'll find anywhere. The waitress was so nice and despite having many other tables she needed to take care of, was super attentive. I wish I had gotten her name but I forgot :( can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This is a solid breakfast place for sure, and liked the divey diner ambiance.  We had a large group, so it was about 30 minute wait for our table, but once we were seated our server was with us right away to get our drink orders. Once we placed our food order it was only another 10 minutes before our food was out on our table!
I tried Gail's favorite eggs, and they were creamy and delicious. My boyfriend had their morning after breakfast with the blueberry hot cakes that were on special. The hot cakes are very unique, almost crepe-like, but really good. The bacon however, was a little thin and crisp.
Service was terrific during the entire meal, our coffees never got lower than half a cup.  Overall it was a quick and tasty breakfast, and definitely a place to try at least once."}
{"text":"Has the appearance and menu of a traditional American diner, but the quality of the food was much better than a traditional American diner. Great tasting food for a reasonable price. They have good French press coffee."}
{"text":"I think the originals are always the best.
The hot cakes are incredible, the French toast is also very good.
Today we tried the lyonnaise potatoes and they were some of the best \" home frie\" style I've ever had.
The service is fast and the restaurant is clean and cool with lots of pictures.
The only thing to remember is that is cash only like the other Pamela's."}
{"text":"Really delicious crepe style pancakes here - you can get them plain or stuffed with bananas and topped with whipped cream.  The staff is friendly and it's great for brunch.  

The wait is pretty long on a weekend though - almost 30 min for a table for 5."}
{"text":"I have legit been waiting for years to eat at Pamela's. So when I finally found a weekend in Pittsburgh to visit, I was sure that it wasn't going to live up to my expectations.

Wrong. Highlights:
-The pancakes are definitely more like crêpes than pancakes, which is a good thing. They're served rolled rather than flat with whipped cream and/or fruit and/or other toppings.
-Home fries were fantastic! I get the feeling they may have been baked rather than fried, because they were sort of mushy instead of crispy, but no complaints.
-$6.50 for an order of pancakes? I forget how cheap everything in Pittsburgh is. If I didn't have enough of a good experience to put me to five stars before, I reached that point when I saw the bill.

Go. Just go. Don't ask questions."}
{"text":"I ordered the Strawberry hot cakes which I had also tried at the Milleville location. They were very good but did have more of a greasy after taste as compared to Milleville. If you have the patience to wait in line, this is definitely a great place to go for breakfast!"}
{"text":"Good food at a good price. I ordered the Gails breakfast: ok scrambled eggs with delicious lyonaise potatoes and really good wheat toast. I'd definitely go back again"}
{"text":"Not bad at all but really overrated. Food is average, prices aren't bad. Inside is kinda weird if you ask me. Shadyside location looks nicer but still pretty average food"}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast, ever. The portions are a good size. Crepe style pancakes, fried eggs and homefries are great.  Actually, everything is great.  I particularly recommend the strawberry pancakes.   

Yes, you will stand in line in the cold for a while and it is cash only.  But it is oh so tasty.  Pamela's is probably what I miss most about Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"I heard it was a Pittsburgh staple, it surely didn't let down. Those crepe style pancakes are just phenomenal."}
{"text":"Hip, cool and delicious.  Wait staff was great, food was quick, decor was quirky and homey.  The crepe style pancakes are fabulous and the corned beef hash was killer.  Parking is a pain but we found a spot on the street around 11 am on a Thursday - no surprise there.  All three kids (17 yrs., 15 and 13) were happy as were mom & dad.  I'd go again in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"If you live in Pittsburgh and have not eaten at Pamela's Diner before I find that a little bit odd. Pamela's has the best breakfast I've ever had. Their pancakes & potatoes...OMG Amazing!! Their pancakes are super thin, almost like a crepe and they are crispy around the edges. Their potatoes are fresh cut and so delicious. They're so good and have so much flavor you don't even need to dip them in ketchup. 
Their omelettes are also to die for. Fluffy, thick and full of flavor. 
The only downside to Pamela's is their food is a bit greasy and not healthy whatsoever. Therefore I do not eat @ Pamela's on a regular basis but when I do I enjoy every bite!!"}
{"text":"We had a terrible breakfast here not long ago. Like many couples in the city, we love to go out every other week or so for a weekend breakfast. This day, it wasn't busy, and the speed of service was good. The French toast was an abomination. The toast had about a quarter inch of egg white formed around the edges, from poorly mixed batter. Plus the bread was poor quality. The bacon...crunchy fleks of the thinnest, most meager bacon these eyes have seen. The crepe pancakes were ok, but nothing to write home about. Years ago I worked for a grumpy penny pincher who had been swindled into buying a 3 year supply of prepackaged coffee, which just sat in our storeroom for years until we brewed it, and cursed it. Van roots, it was. Pamela's, in all the years I Have visited, has consistently challenged van rooy for the worst coffee crown. On top of all the bad food, last week Pamela's earned that crown. We'll be enjoying breakfast elsewhere in the future."}
{"text":"Coffee sucks! 
Great service and the pancakes are light and laced, 
I had it Strawberrys, whipped cream and chunks of brown sugar. Total decadence. 

Word on the street was that Obama flew the chef to the White House for pancakes, I have no idea if that is true, but it is very believable. 

But at the end of the day our waitress said the staff agreed about how bad the coffee was."}
{"text":"Best crepe pancake/hotcakes ever!! This is the second time we have come here while in town for a Steeler's game. We walked 15 blocks and waited for a bit for a seat but it is so worth the wait. Heads up that they only take cash so a lot of people make use of the ATM around the corner

It was jammed on Saturday morning but we were served quickly. Nice atmosphere - we'll be back again."}
{"text":"Amazing food.  CASH ONLY.  I always ALWAYS get the strawberry crepes and my mouth is watering just thinking about it.  Perfect balance of sweet and savory, because it's filled with strawberries and like a cream cheese whipped cream and sprinkles of brown sugar...SO YUM.  Otherwise, basic coffee, sides of eggs, bacon, and sausage, etc.  But just go and get the crepes.  Just do it. 

I was going to give it 4 stars instead of 5 because there is ALWAYS a ridiculous wait during meal times.  You just have to expect that and set aside a whole morning or afternoon.  But I settled on 5 stars because, although it's a long wait to get a table, once you get one, the waiters are so fast and attentive, and my orders always come SUPER fast.  So in a way it kind of makes up for the wait.  [if you just hate waiting, you can also order for carry out; OH and another side-note, the crepes are EXCELLENT heated up in the oven later.  I'd usually eat half, take half home and eat the rest later]

Anyway, whenever you're in Pittsburgh, go here!  I sure do."}
{"text":"We visited this place on a recommendation from a friend.  It is downtown, and parking was difficult.  We arrived around 10:30a on a weekday, and there was no wait.  This place is cash only, which was a bit of a surprise to us.  The Tex Mex omelet was great, and the potato side very unique.  The chocolate chip banana hot cakes were crepe style and very heavy with bananas.  Good in small portions, but these were very large portions.  Great service!"}
{"text":"Pamela's was my first real dining experience in Pittsburgh. I was told dozens of times by native Pittsburghians about how Pamela's hotcakes are not only a Pittsburgh staple but a White House favorite. 

Can't argue with that. I had the good fortune of sampling both the banana chocolate chip hotcakes as well as the banana walnut hotcakes--the former is by far superior, even if you're a nut fiend like yours truly. Perfectly crisped around the edges and delectably moist and sweet, the crepes are loaded with melted chocolate and banana slices. I will shamelessly admit to eating two orders... by myself. 

However, the rest of the offerings at Pamela's are your typical diner fare, average at best. Come here for the hotcakes, then go home and sleep it off. Your day is done.

*Pamela's is cash-only and extremely busy on weekends. (On weekdays, service is surprisingly brisk.)
*I recommend the Shadyside or Squirrel Hill locations over the one in Oakland."}
{"text":"This place had pretty plain diner fare. The home fries (sorry, I mean \"Lyonnaise potatoes\") that came with my eggs and toast were a little too salty. The pancake was crisp and good. My friends got the corned beef hash and said it was mediocre."}
{"text":"Maybe \"yinzer good\" isn't always such a bad thing. I went here the other morning and was quoted a 25-30 minutes wait time. It took 50 minutes. That seemed to be pretty standard so be prepared for that. Once we got in and ordered, the food came out almost immediately making the wait time more worth it. The hot cakes were delicious but be prepared for more buttery goodness than one should consume in a month. The potatoes were also half butter. I thought they tasted great if not a tad salty. The orange juice is more affordable than in most breakfast places but it wasn't mind blowing, I doubt it was fresh squeezed. My husband ordered eggs and hash which were also good but overly salty. We left feeling stuffed, guilty, and knowing that while the food was tasty our waistlines could only handle eating there once every couple of months."}
{"text":"I haven't even eaten yet and I'm pissed. My coffee mug came with lipstick, whatever. They ONLY TAKE CASH!!! so now I have to get up and leave the restaurant to go down the block to the PNC. I effing hate vendors who are stuck in the 70s when it comes to credit cards. It costs you 3%!!! It cost me $3.50 to take out the $40 to pay for the meal. That's about 8%!!! Build the g-d credit card fees into your prices and stop pissing people off! What is it to avoid declaring income and therefore paying taxes??? Cash only businesses do not put customers first! Now to eat my meal..."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved it! Just a heads up, this place is cash only but the servers were friendly enough to direct us to a nearby ATM. There was a bit of a wait but it went by pretty quickly. There was also a wait for the food but it was definitely worth the wait. I had an omelette that was really great and my wife had the pancakes which were also very good. I'd definitely recommend this place to anyone in the area"}
{"text":"The food here is amazing the decorations are great. I can on a Sunday so it was packed beyond belief the room was loud but the wait went fast. This is a great place to go but if your looking to chat it is hard."}
{"text":"Serve a good breakfast, but I only have the patience to go on weekdays (that aren't holidays, bc they are closed) bc it is mobbed on the weekends. Wish they were open past early afternoon, I would do breakfast for dinner there in a second (I imagine it wouldn't be so crowded)."}
{"text":"Pamela's is an institution in Pittsburgh.  I tend to be more of a savory eater than a sweets guy, but this place does really well on both.  On the savory side, Pamela's makes very competent omelets and gives plenty of options on egg whites only/eggbeaters.  The most famous aspect of their savory foods is the \"hash browns\" which have some spices/herbs that almost taste like  a super mild and buttery Indian Masala.  They are really really great--ask for them to make them extra crispy.  On the sweet side, their crepe-esque pancakes are delicious.  As mentioned, I am not much of a sweets guy, but after my omelet, I do enjoy sneaking a bite or two off of the edge of my wife or child's buttery, mapley pancakes.  

In Shadyside, don't be surprised to see Lynn Swann, and expect to wait for a table on a Saturday or Sunday."}
{"text":"I could eat here every day.   If I had the patience of a saint and wanted to weigh 400 pounds, that is.   

As far as breakfast goes, Pamela's has it covered.   The crepe hotcakes are amazing and they have a pretty good selection of hearty and delicious breakfast fare.   Everything is always well prepared, quick, and flavorful.   

It's definitely got a diner feel and they turn tables over quickly, which is good because there is ALWAYS a line. There's really not a lot of room to wait, but people wait.   It's sort of a madhouse, especially if the weather is bad and people don't want to wait outside.   I'm more of a reservation girl and don't have a lot of patience for lines, but this is a place I'll wait for.  

Prices are a it higher than diner prices, but not unreasonable.   Payment is CASH ONLY and I'd be sort of surprised to hear that they don't have a lot of people walking out without paying.  You have to sort of fight your way through the crowd of waiting people to the cashier in order to cash out."}
{"text":"Honestly, it's hard to say anything that hasn't already been said about this place. After all, Pamela's is widely known for serving the best breakfast in Pittsburgh, and for good reason. (Even President Obama approves.)

Believe it or not, until this past weekend, it had been at least a couple years since I last ate here. Not that I had a bad experience or anything. I'm just an impatient person and get intimidated by the line, which sometimes on weekends gets wrapped all the way around the block.

Decor inside has a nice, 50's diner throwback. Love checking out all the old black and white photos hanging on the walls.

My all-time favorites on the menu? Any of the hotcakes, but particularly the banana and chocolate chip. And lyonnaise potatoes, which comes as a side for most of the protein-based menu items.

However, this past weekend, while scanning the menu, I saw something new: Pittsburgh hash. Their lyonnaise potatoes mixed with kielbasa, sauerkraut and topped with Swiss cheese. It was a dream, and possibly the best meal I've eaten there. And that's saying a lot.

I think this breakfast is best after a hard workout. Makes the calories more justified. I've eaten here after a night out once or twice, but the meal's decadence was too much while nursing a hangover. Haha."}
{"text":"Clean place.  Pancakes a bit too buttery for my taste (and health!).  But the vibe was good, and people were enjoying themselves, so I'd go back again - just wouldn't order the pancakes!"}
{"text":"The BEST blueberry hotcakes ive ever had! The busser is also incredible! Must stop for breakfast!"}
{"text":"Pamela's was, alongside Primanti's, the place everyone said I must try when I moved here. And this one really delivers.

The food is very reasonably priced, and has a unique selection. Virtually everything can come with their delicious, buttery crepe pancakes, which are thin and amazing, or their lyonaise potatoes, which are outstanding, especially if you are a potato lover like myself. There are a lot of other good choices, like the Tex Mex omelet or the Croissant French Toast, and as I said above the prices are pretty good. The layout is odd and there is a lot of kitschy board games and such on the wall that kind of make it fun and different.

There are a few drawbacks. Their hours are short, and I've not found the help to be especially attentive. Not bad, mind you, just not especially attentive. Also, they only take cash, which is a pain when you don't typically carry cash.

This place is good enough that it is usually the first stop when we have visitors from out of town."}
{"text":"This place is so popular, and I don't really understand why. I mean, the ambiance is cool, but they use american cheese in their omelettes. Gross. It's also cash only which is really annoying especially since I almost never carry cash. Pancakes were great, but I just can't get over using American cheese in an omelette. Why."}
{"text":"Wow, just like old times.  Used to come here often when i was a Pitt student 1997-2002.  Great service and great breakfast spread.  Only accepts cash.  Great alternative to the chain breakfast joints."}
{"text":"Each time I've been here (3 or 4 times as the writing of this review) I've ordered the hotcakes. And when they are sooo good why would you ever order anything else? 

This location of Pamela's is certainly nice and clean enough. The waitstaff are attentive and the kitchen is fast. So really this is a review of those hotcakes. The crispy edges really are the best part. That said the middle with the fruit stuffing, brown sugar, sour and whipped cream is pretty awesome too. 

I have eaten here each time I've visited my sister out in the 'Burgh, a tradition that I hope will continue."}
{"text":"There always seems to be a wait here. Luckily, my group of 4 only waited about 20 minutes around Sunday noon time. Only half of our group was there but they were nice enough to seat us anyway. The service seemed a little disorganized. We had three servers come up and ask if our table had ordered drinks yet. And then throughout the meal, we had trouble chasing one down to get more water. 

Three of us got the morning after breakfast with regular, banana walnut and strawberry hotcakes. He fourth got the Tex-Mex omelette, which was pretty good. On my plate were regular sunny side up eggs and super salty bacon. The hotcakes seemed like they couldn't decide if they were a crepe or a pancake, but definitely more on the fluffier side. The strawberry was definitely the best. I felt like the banana in the banana walnut made the hotcakes taste drier. Very fluffy though! I didn't think the meal was anything special or something I couldn't get at another diner/breakfast place. 

Also, it's cash only! Very affordable though."}
{"text":"Hot Cakes and Lyonesse potatoes.  These are the showstoppers. In my opinion, the other breakfast things are good, but not wait in line 1 hour good. I have done some nonsensical things to get to the strawberry hotcakes at Pamela's. They are THAT good. 
I was there today and wanted to try something different so I got the Crispy Malted Waffle.  Eh... it was ok. Not that crispy.  Not like the edges of the hotcakes.  Just do yourself a favor and get the hotcakes!"}
{"text":"By far, one of the most unique and plentiful breakfasts I've ever had. On the side, I got the kielbasa hash and it was a very large portion but it was just as a expected it (not in a bad way!) I forget the name of the egg plate I got but the guac and sour Creme was the best thing to add on top of eggs. The environment and the overall setting was so cool because it was modern yet antique."}
{"text":"Great place to ruin your diet, totally worth the calorie free fall! Great hot cakes, great potatoes. Stick with breakfast and you cannot go wrong.  Unless you prefer things like wheatgrass.  Then, not so much."}
{"text":"Pamela's is THE place to go for dirty spoon breakfast. Greasy diner pancakes and eggs, to the max. Some of the best breakfast I've ever had. The process for getting a table is a bit confusing and the wait is usually pretty long. But it's very much worth it. 

You have to try the pancakes and potatoes. It would be a sin not to."}
{"text":"Who doesn't love Pamela's? This is the original location, which I love! The food is delicious - their potatoes are probably my favorite thing on the menu. Service is always great. It just tends to get really crowded. And it's a nuisance that they only take cash. But a great Pittsburgh staple!"}
{"text":"Hate the wait especially in winter but love everything else about it. I do want to give it a five star but had to knock one off just because of my love for potatoes and apparently my go to \"Morning after breakfast\" doesn't come with it. Although stealing those delicious  Lyonnaise potatoes from my partners plate has never been an issue. 

Every time we've been here we've never had any bad experience with the food or the service. Highly recommended for breakfast."}
{"text":"THEY ONLY TAKE CASH!!! 
Love this place! Great food and really affordable. My friend had Gail's favorite eggs. It come with potatoes that are DELICIOUS! I had the famous corned beef hash and 2 eggs. I loved it! My friend had coffee as well and the bill was only about $19!

I've only been on Saturday mornings and there's always a long wait but it's worth it. The older gentleman who busses the tables is super sweet and funny! Love him!
The restroom is pretty gross and small but that's the only negative."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE! While I was a Fellow at Carnegie Mellon, I was introduced to this place and fell in love. OBAMA came here too! Cash only, and nearly anything you order off the menu is pure GOLD!.. well.. not literally gold because that'd be weird to eat.. but its REALLY good food!

Seriously. Don't even look. Just close your eyes, point at something, and order it. It's guaranteed to be de-lic-ious. I ordered almost everything off the menu during my summer here. I MISS IT! :'("}
{"text":"I am salivating at the memory of the meal we had at Pamela's this weekend.  My husband and I were visiting Pittsburgh just to get out of dodge & numerous friends recommended Pamela's as a must-try spot. I'm thinking, \"when do multiple people recommend a breakfast place?\" and the answer is when it's absolutely amazing.

We took an uber because it was cold and rainy and when we pulled up we found that the diner was packed and people were waiting outside in the rain.  We were disappointed to find such a wait but then I realized.... people are standing outside in the rain waiting to eat here. It's just that good.  We joined the huddle for a good 30 or 40 minutes but the staff seemed to do a solid job of moving people in and out in a timely manner.  This doesn't seem like a good place to linger over coffee on a weekend but it is a place to get amazing food on the cheap.  Trust me, totally worth the wait, even in the rain.

My husband got The Morning After (two eggs, two choice of breakfast meat & the most amazing pancakes eveerrrrrr) and I got the chorizo hash.  The star of the show were the pancakes. They were reminiscent of the buttery-flavored pancakes I ate at McDonalds as a little girl. They were super thin and big as the plate but they somehow managed to be fluffy and absorb the syrup perfectly; not that they even needed much syrup.  I was guilty of stealing more than a few bites.  The chorizo hash was composed of potatoes, chorizo, jalapenos and onions smothered in the right amount of cheddar cheese. They serve up the hash with two eggs and tortillas which become the best damn breakfast tacos ever.  Yes, ever. I am usually not an absolutist but trust me on this.  

Okay, I think that about covers it. Go eat there. Now. Or the next time you're in Pittsburgh. DO IT.

P.S. CASH ONLY"}
{"text":"Another help wanted sign and closed Memorial day. Ahhh"}
{"text":"Came here for a Sunday morning breakfast and was suprised by the lack of a line.  Quickly seated and ordered a good cup of coffee.  Unfortunately had to stop the waiter a few times for a refill though.   Decided on the morning after breakfast by recommendation of the server which was delicious.  Other yelpers were not kidding when they said this place has amazing hotcakes.  They melt in your mouth.  Eggs and turkey sausage were really good too. Overall, definetely a place to go in pittsburgh."}
{"text":"The corned beef hash here is the best corned beef hash I've ever had. Everytime I visit Pittsburgh, it's a must-eat! The lines can get long so I try to come closer to closing time when the restaurant is less busy."}
{"text":"YUM YUM YUM!  (but go hungry)
We went for a quick breakfast on a Saturday morning.  We got there early because we knew it was popular.  We were seated right away and had coffee and juice very quickly.  I was advised by a friend to get the pancakes.  I got the banana nut version, although the strawberry pancakes looked really good too!  Our food came our very quickly and was delicious!  The pancakes are hot, thin and buttery, almost like a crepe.  They were rolled around bananas and chopped nuts and didn't need much syrup because they were sweet.  I was very happy with my breakfast!"}
{"text":"The best diner option in Pittsburgh is to get on the turnpike and go to Jersey. Pittsburgh diners close at 10pm and the menu is bigger at McDonalds."}
{"text":"Excellent food, fast service.  Fantastic crepe style pancakes."}
{"text":"I love Pamelas.....in the strip! I'll give that location 5 stars!! But my strawberry hotcakes were cold the lyon potatoes were tasteless somehow n my waffle was pretty good. Its alot but I was only visiting and I was sooo disappointed. The waitresses were great and accomodating though. Please retrain so I can go to every location. Thanks!"}
{"text":"I was here at the Pamela's in Shadyside a few weeks ago - dining companion and I were looking for a nice brunch-y place to visit. Naturally, with all the high ratings we saw on Yelp! for Pamela's, we gave it a shot.

I have to ask: What is all the fuss about this place?

My companion and I were a little dismayed to see it was a cash-only place, but luckily in Shadyside there is a PNC just up the street. The restaurant was fairly busy with lots of customers chatting at their tables. It wasn't an uninviting atmosphere, more laid-back, but also a little indifferent, if that makes any sense. Our waitress wasn't unfriendly, but didn't really go out of her way to talk much with us.

After perusing the menu for a bit, the fella ordered a Greek salad with chicken while I went for the crepe-hotcake dish. Food came out pretty fast, but that was sadly the best part about it.

My companion's tiny salad was served in a large silver bowl, like the chef had mixed it up and decided better of putting it on an actual plate. The Greek dressing was saturated with lemon flavor, way too tart and sour, and the chicken was pretty paltry for the price.

My crepe-hotcake thingies were okay, but very oily and griddle-tasting. Way too rich to finish.

Overall, we found ourselves very underwhelmed with Pamela's. Our search for a good brunch place continues."}
{"text":"Favorite breakfast food in oakland... the hotcakes are to die for. It's a fun place for families, as the walls are covered with old school board games and the tables come with trivia cards. It is a very popular spot on campus so there can sometimes be a bit of a wait, but they turn tables pretty quickly."}
{"text":"Pamela's can be hit or miss. It'll definitely be a hit if you got black-out drunk the night before, woke up next to someone you regret, and then want to eat a meal that you'll later forget. It's a miss if you're looking for something more than a heavy, grease breakfast. The hotcakes are dank (that means good, non-millennials), the omelettes are gucci, and their signature potatoes are great alone or swimming in ketchup. Pamela's is inconsistent. I've had good and bad experiences here. My buddy got \"The Morning After,\" which is their pinnacle menu item, and the eggs and all else were underwhelming. To be honest, the lunch items are better than the breakfast at this location. One of Oakland's better burgers, if you ask me.

Bottom Line: If you need a quick breakfast, Pamela's Oakland is good, but not as good as its other two locations in Pittsburgh. As a college student though, sometimes you gotta sacrifice quality for convenience."}
{"text":"We went to Pamela's on our First Steeler's Weekend. They were lined up waiting on tables - but this one is a local favorite worth the wait! I had an Omelet and their famous Lyonnais potatoes - delicious! My husband had their pancakes also - he loved it as well. Prices are reasonable. Service was great. The atmosphere in the older Strip District restaurant was very cool. I will definitely return when in the area and recommend this as well as Primanti Bros as Pittsburgh staples that you absolutely cannot miss out on when in Pittsburgh.

We will definitely go back! This business is CASH ONLY so no credit cards allowed..."}
{"text":"Delicious hot cakes. A really cute, fun, and reasonable place to go for a filling breakfast. The place was packed. That speaks for itself. The wait staff was excellent."}
{"text":"A Pittsburgh tradition! Pamela's is the perfect place for a quick and cheap breakfast any day of the week with classics such as waffles, crepes, omelettes, and pancakes. The menu also offers lunch sandwiches, salads, and burgers. 
On weekends expect there to be a line or wait as they fill up quickly, but once you place your order the food usually doesn't take much longer than 5-10 minutes. The atmosphere is like a usual diner, quick, family friendly, old school music, checkerboard tile, and delicious smells from the kitchen! 

Heads up--they only accept cash so don't forget to run to the ATM!"}
{"text":"This place was recommended to us as a Pittsburgh attraction and we were not disappointed.

I had the strawberry hot cakes and they were amazing.  Not too sweet, tender with perfectly crisp edges.

My husband had the day's special - a chorizo hash.  It was spicy and very fresh tasting and along with 2 eggs made for a very large meal."}
{"text":"Best breakfast place in town, Period.  The wait can be long, but it is worth it.  Just stop you had me at: Lyonnaise potatoes and Chorizo.

I take everyone that I go to Pens and Steelers games with to Pamela's and they continue to talk about it for years later.

Take cash!  That is the only draw back."}
{"text":"We went here for breakfast one day because it was the highest rated spot in the area. This time, yelp couldn't have been more wrong. First off, the coffee was terrible. Just total swill. Another problem? Virtually every dish was basically drowning in salt (potatoes, eggs, hash, omelettes, you name it). I mean the food was so salty that the salt was all you could taste. Also, my omelette was so overcooked that it had a rather tough skin on the outside and just tasted terrible. A fruit bowl, meanwhile consisted of just bananas and strawberries and the berries had some weird, sweet glaze on them. Gross. I don't think anyone in our group liked their food, probably the best was the crepe pancake but even that was only passable. Don't believe the hype--this is a must avoid."}
{"text":"I've eaten at Pamela's several times, usually in the Strip location, but today in Shady Side.  I can honestly say that Pamela's is by far the best breakfast restaurant I have ever eaten at. Their \"crepe\" pancakes are awesome!  I Love how the outer edges of the pancake are crispy and buttery and the taste of the pancake itself is just fantastic. Their potatoes (lionized ?? Potatoes) are outstanding, and are the best breakfast potatoes I've ever had.  I would also strongly recommend their corned beef hash!  As other reviews has commented, be sure to bring cash, as it is cash only.  Also, if you plan to go, you may have to wait in line, as Pamela's in the Strip is typically pretty crowded, especially on weekends.  That said, this restaurant is totally worth the wait. I guarantee you will not be disappointed by any breakfast you order here.  Now if the owners would just open one up here where I live so I don't have to drive down into the city."}
{"text":"So breakfast is my favorite meal of the day...and Pamela's will not disappoint you!
first time in this local and its so cute inside all teal with vintage 50s & 60s ads
it feels all good in there
it was packed and there was a wait ...It was about 81:5am sunday morning on a cold winters day.
we headed right to the back counter to grab a bite for take out
you can not visit Pittsburgh with out eating at Pamela's diner
We were in a hurry ...and told the girl so 
no worries 
8 min later we were out our the door with piping hot coffees and egg & cheese on a croissant 
so good 
I saw those famous thin crispy pancakes go by as we were waiting Yup I should have ordered them! but this was a great take away breakfast. 
ps cash only"}
{"text":"The special potatoes were a bit mushy for my liking, yet I liked the onion flavor.
Bacon egg cheese muffin was ok-bacon is thick cut so it's not crisp at all.
Corned beef and Swiss omelette was very Swiss cheesy.
They only serve breakfast on Sunday's."}
{"text":"I had a wonderful breakfast at Pamela's. The food really is delicious, but quite expensive for breakfast! Our bill came to about $40 for 3 people. That's a lot of money for eggs and pancakes!!

We were a little overwhelmed when we first arrived because the waiting area was packed. They told us only 10-15 mins and it was spot-on, which we were pleasantly surprised about! Our server came to us right away. I could immediately see how fast-paced they work to keep their customers flowing on a busy morning!

Everyone in my group would agree that the best part of the meal was the lyonnaise potatoes. My friend recommended asking for the potatoes to be \"crispy\" and I'm glad I did. They were absolutely delicious. A crunchy coating on top with soft potatoes and onions underneath. YUM.

I ordered the Gail's eggs which were scrambled eggs topped with green onion and cream cheese. It came with a side of potatoes and two gigantic pieces of bread. The eggs were done perfectly and I although I had never had cream cheese on eggs before, it was delicious!! It's going to be hard to avoid cooking my eggs like that from now on! One of my friends ordered the breakfast special with 2 eggs, meat and a side of their specialty blueberry hotcakes. It falls somewhere between a crepe and a pancake. They cook a giant pancake and roll it up over a variety of fillings. It looks beautiful and tastes delicious! If it's too sweet to order for your whole meal, it's definitely worth ordering as a side for a few to split just to get a taste! My other friend ordered a daily special which was Chorizo hash served with eggs and tortillas. There was a surprising amount of meat and he was very pleased with his meal as well.

The food is great and I was happy to finally experience this Pittsburgh gem. Prepare to pay more than your typical diner, but you certainly won't be disappointed by the quality!"}
{"text":"Cheap, fast, friendly, quality food, and best comfort food. My fave is Gail's eggs in egg whites!"}
{"text":"I love diner food, and Pamela's is a great example. The only downside: a very un-diner-like wait. It seems like no matter how early I show up, it's impossible to get seated in under 30 minutes on a weekend.

Do I feel like it's worth the wait? Yes, but I try to make it count. I usually order Gail's favorite eggs AND some hotcakes and eat half there, with half to take home.

I have had omelettes here before, but they are very standard diner omelettes: brown/slightly overcooked. I prefer Gail's eggs because they come perfectly cooked, not overdone.

Honestly though, I feel like the Lyonnaise potatoes are my absolute favorite thing. I am craving them right now."}
{"text":"A must when in Pittsburgh, a great breakfast spot w/ crepe style pancakes. Service is great and the price is right. Cash only!"}
{"text":"If you live in the Pittsburgh area and haven't been to Pamela's for breakfast, brunch or lunch, shame on you!  Pamela's is a must!!  Quick service, reasonable prices and a heaping plateful of deliciousness.  So many options but I typically opt for the classic 2 eggs, toast and the Lyonnaise potatoes.  They also have turkey sausage.  The potatoes are terrific and not to be missed.   Plus they leave a carafe of coffee on your table so no need to wait for hot refills!

The worst parts about Pamela's are the long wait on weekends (I recommend going early) and that its cash only.  Why do I forget that every single time?   No worries, there is a PNC ATM right around the corner.

Ps...I love the gentleman who buses tables.   He seems to love his job and busts a few dance moves and is tapping his feet as he clears tables.   He just brings a smile to my face."}
{"text":"I was back in Pittsburgh for a weekend to attend my graduation ceremony. And I surely wasn't giving up this rare opportunity to grab a bite at Pamela's. We were a group of six people. After waiting for about 30 minutes, we were given a spot. Together, we shared a ham omelet, a morning-after breakfast, a plate of blueberry hotcakes, and a fish sandwich. This was all more than sufficient for the six of us. 

As usual, everything was delish."}
{"text":"Pamela's Diner fits the image one thinks of when going out to a Diner.  We had to wait in line but it wasn't too long -- the rainy weather helped with this.  The wait staff were very nice and brought us hot coffee and extra to let us keep filling up our cups.  The coffee tasted like typical diner coffee. The food was ok breakfast food, not the best I have had.  I ordered the Lyonnaise potatoes which have onions in it and the spinach feta omelet.  It was a good omelet, but nothing out of the ordinary.  My husband ordered the western omelet, potatoes and wheat bread.  The food was fine, but nothing extraordinary.  Bottom line, if you want a decent breakfast and it is worth waiting in line for you, give it a try."}
{"text":"Wow what a great little spot. Crepes were ridiculously good. Omelette was great too.  I think I finished two other peoples plates, ha.

Only downside: no credit cards, cash only!"}
{"text":"Don't come here if you're looking for a healthy breakfast.

And definitely don't come here if you don't want to wait around, especially when the local schools are in session.

But DO come here for amazing hotcakes and the most glorious, buttery, greasy spoon breakfast around.  

The hotcakes, for those of you unfamiliar, are more like crepes.  Usually stuffed with fruit and whipped cream and fried in butter.  Extremely sweet and rich and the best ever cure for a college hangover.

Prices are cheap and the place is cash only.  Super friendly, quick service.  Always on my must-visit list when I'm back in town."}
{"text":"Oh my GOD. Get on line. Let Pamela's seduce your tastebuds into your imminent food coma.

The wait & service: 
Pretty decent considering the overwhelming flow of people in and out of this fine establishment. The evil part is that they make you wait outside while you stare at the unlucky window-seaters chomp away at their food. Service was a little shoddy and unresponsive. I had to steal syrup from a neighboring empty table. -1/2 star.

The hours: 
This is delicious, greasy, goodness. It'd be amazing drunk food if they were open late at night -- closed in the middle of the afternoon...what gives? -1/2 star.

THE BANANA WALNUT HOTCAKES:
ARGHHHH SO FRUSTRATINGLY GOOD!!!! They are delicious, filling, crispy, succulent, flavorful, and so addicting. The only thing missing was the jar of Nutella that I should have brought. 

THE CORNED BEEF HASH:
This i saved for later, as the hotcakes were surprisingly filling. The potatoes were well cooked and it was a great salty break from my assault on the hotcakes."}
{"text":"Been here twice and i love it. Every time i come to Pittsburgh i make sure this is one of my stops. I always mean to get the pancakes but i order an omelet instead. Then i sneak bites from friend's plates for the best of both worlds."}
{"text":"We realllllyy dig Pamela's. I've shared my awesome first-time Pamela hot cake experience on the Shadyside location, so I will not repeat that again. 

I'm literally obsessed with the strawberry hotcakes and the potatoes. 

I brought my sister here this weekend to experience Pamela's. She enjoyed it as well! 

As others have stated, it's worth the wait! It's normally a 30-min wait on a Sunday around noon. Surprisingly, your food comes out realllllly fast! This past weekend though, we waited a good 30-35 minutes for our food after ordering (which was longer than average) Still worth it though!!

Cash Only***"}
{"text":"Today was my second time at a Pamela's. During my first trip I made the mistake of 1)not ordering hot cakes 2) dining alone 3)not ordering hotcakes! 

I was worried about a wait for a Sunday morning but it was surprisingly only 15minutes. We were seated & greeted promptly. Both of us ordered the morning after breakfast with the strawberry pancakes. The potatoes /home fries were awesome & as another reviewer mentioned it feels as if every bite is different (&fabulous). 

Speaking of fabulous, I'm thankful to have finally experienced the Pamelas hotcake. It was filled with fresh strawberries, sour cream, brown sugar bits.. & every bite was better than the last. Don't let that trio scare or fool you-.it's delicious 

Next weekend can't come fast enough to stop back

...forgot to mention it took no time at all for 4 giant plates of food to reach our table."}
{"text":"Best breakfast in Pennsylvania period. The strawberry crepe hotcakes are incredible."}
{"text":"I was determined to come here this morning after seeing all the reviews on Yelp. The front room is pretty cute with old board games on the walls and it brought an eclectic feel to the room. I had to wait awhile before the host even noticed I was there and was directed to the main room which is more of a traditional diner in terms of decor. I ordered the famous hot cakes and was unimpressed. They were basically a little thicker than Swedish pancakes and did not really have a unique flavor. The salted ball of butter and drizzle of was the saving grace. It was just ok and I feel like the hot cakes from McDonald's are even better than this! I ordered orange juice and they. Thought it out in a soft drink cup wtf! I wouldn't waste your time coming here. Although I do have to say they have really good service and attentive servers."}
{"text":"Stopped in with Classy Mike and Pittsburgh's own Mr. Matt-boto during Mike and I's road trip from New York to Los Angeles.

I could have given Pamela's three stars but I gotta be honest with y'all...Pamela's needs a shot in the ass to find that fire again.  Yes, I  understand that being endorsed by the friggin President gives you some mighty laurels to rest upon.  But Pamela's, y'all ain't tryin'.

The pancakes are good.  Maybe even really good - probably 19 stars on my patented 25 star rating system.  But Pamela's just doesn't give a damn about anything else.  Aerosol whipped cream, Minute Maid sold in a tiny glass at a huge markup, and frozen fruit that's been sitting out for who knows how long.  C'mon guys, the endorsement of the President is something to live up to - not an excuse to cut corners.

Food: 18/25 stars
Ambiance: 13/25 stars
Service: 20/25 stars
Bathroom: 17/25 stars (you have to go upstairs to a separate shop)
Probability of going back: 20%"}
{"text":"A MUST! Not much to say that hasn't been said. The hot cakes are remarkable. The hash had great flavor. Worth the wait for a table. Great experience."}
{"text":"I liked the run down diner atmosphere.  The food came really fast and was delicious.  I got the crepe pancakes (tasty with crispy edges) with chocolate chips and bananas.  Elvis would have loved it.  The whipped cream was unnecessary, but ok.  

There was no \"mid meal\" service though, no one to check on the lonely girl in the corner.  But the food was good and the price was right."}
{"text":"I guess I like Pamelas.

Their hotcakes are awesome, though they do need to distribute their brown sugar around instead of getting them in lumps here and there.  Their potatoes are good; I like 'em.  Their corned beef hash is mixed with their potatoes, which I dig, except that their corned beef is too salty :(.  Their tex mex omelete is pretty bad, but I guess that's Pittsburgh.

Despite that, I still go to Pamelas too often for my wallet's liking."}
{"text":"This was my 2nd time at Pamela's. First time was great. Second was not so great. Service was blah. I felt like I was being treated like I was lucky that they served me not that other way around. Got the strawberry pancakes, which are HUGE, the the way. They were very good. What wasn't good was the potatoes!! They were amazing the first time around and we were determined to get them again. My family and I split a plate because the server is rather large. We ate about half then all 3 of us got nothing but mouthfuls of salt. It was disgusting. When we complained we hardly even got an apology. Very much felt like we weren't too important. For the prices they charge I guess I expect better. Don't think we'll be back."}
{"text":"The crispy crepe style pancakes and chorizo hash are my all time favorites. It's always good and the service is great!"}
{"text":"I love the decoration of the restaurant. It is near the university district but we were still able to find free parking on a Sunday morning easily. I ordered morning after special with 2 eggs, sausage, and a banana walnut hot cake! I was so full and the hot cake was amazing. Hot cake had very thin layer and the texture tasted sort of like crepes but it was also very fluffy. I Absolutely recommend this restaurant for the affordable price range!"}
{"text":"This diner definitely lives up to its reviews. We came on a Sunday for lunch and didn't have to wait more than 5 minutes for a seat. Service was excellent, but the food was AMAZING. We ordered the famous hotcakes and a few orders of hash. Not only were they all delicious, but they were like nothing I've had before. And for whatever reason, the pop was really good too! We'll definitively be back!"}
{"text":"Everyone always raves about Pamela's so it was time to try it. 

We went on a Steeler Sunday but it was not extremely packed. There was no line out the door like DeLuca's but I prefer Pamela's. They only had one table which was a table for 5 but they seated us there anyway which I appreciated. 

The service was fast, not too friendly but efficient. 

My husband ordered the chorizo and eggs (over easy), their potatoes and rye toast. The potatoes are unique but delicious! I'm not a huge fan of chorizo but he really enjoyed it. 

I ordred their speciality crepes which are I was not pleased with. I didn't like them at all as they were too thick and not at all like crepes. I did have turkey sausage (which only come in patties) and a single scrambled egg which may have been the best egg ever. 

Only downfall about this place is that it's cash only!"}
{"text":"Great place to go on a Saturday or Sunday morning after drinking way too much. The hotcakes are unbelievable but I am a really big fan of their home fries. I also really like their corned beef hash. I'll usually get some sort of omelette and pair it with a hotcake (usually chocolate but blueberry is pretty good too). I'll then make sure there is plenty of home fries and get a side of the corned beef hash. This usually puts me in a food coma but makes me feel fantastic especially after waking up a little hungover or still drunk from the night before.

Oh. you have to pay with cash. And this location is also pretty packed so there is usually a line up outside. But it's so worth it."}
{"text":"I've always been a big fan of brunch and so far I've been content with my dining experiences at Pamela's. The \"morning after breakfast special\" on the menu is the one they really try to sell. Make sure you change the regular hotcakes to the specialty ones! Definitely worth the extra $2. I highly recommend the chocolate chip banana hotcake. Also go to the shadyside Pamela's if you can. It's better than the one in Oakland."}
{"text":"Pamela's is all about the atmosphere. The kitchy vibe is a really fun environment to visit for breakfast. I've never had a meal that I've really enjoyed, but then again I can't eat their famous hotcakes because of an allergy. They look so delicious and I'm sure they taste better than they look. I love taking my family here when they visit from out of town. Pamela's is a Pittsburgh classic."}
{"text":"So good I didn't stop to take a picture of it! Sure it was worth the wait."}
{"text":"Pretty cool diner, cool enough for me to visit six times in my last five weeks in Pittsburgh. The trick? It opens at 7am, so get there at 6:55."}
{"text":"Love this place. Great atmosphere diner. Breakfast, brunch and lunch only. This location cash only."}
{"text":"I am not a pancake fan, but I AM a crepe fan...and if you like crepes too, you will LOVE Pamela's hotcakes. They are a little bit thicker than a traditional crepe, but they have those wonderfully crunchy, carmelized edges that take a crepe to the next level of awesome. The strawberry ones with sour cream and brown sugar are insane and quite possibly addictive. I want to try the banana ones sometime too, but I just love the strawberry ones too much!

Everything else I've had here was kinda gross...especially the bacon. Maybe the worst bacon I've ever had. Like, even worse than the bacon at Eat 'n Park. And the paper menus with grease stains all over them from previous diners are completely repulsive. But no matter...hotcakes!!! that's all you need to know.

Cash only, duh. I feel like we all know this by now."}
{"text":"Best breakfast and brunch spot in the city of Pittsburgh. Been around for a long time, Pamela's is Pittsburgh's signature diner experience. Their corn beef hash is uniquely great, and their pancakes phenomenal. Tip: sit at the counter for the best experience."}
{"text":"Impressive ability to deliver Pamela's Diner experience at multiple locations across the Burgh. The Shadyside location is always packed, but the experience is just as fantastic as in the strip District. Food is great, staff are friendly, and the best thing is once you're done with your meal you're right on Walnut Street. Highly recommend Pamela's for everything they serve, but the corn beef hash is my favorite."}
{"text":"Very friendly and prompt service.  Great big portions.  Food tastier than Pittsburgh's average but not very exciting."}
{"text":"The most delicious pancakes I have ever eaten.  As a matter of fact, my second favorite meal this year, only to be topped by a Cuban restaurant in Key West.  The prices were reasonable and the staff was very friendly.  Wish we were just tourists and had one by me!"}
{"text":"Food was very good and unique but the environment wasn't very inviting.  I really don't understand why a restaurant in 2014 wouldn't accept credit cards.  The parking meters outside take credit cards.  They have all of these rude warnings posted all over the restaurant about not taking credit cards because clearly their customers would prefer to pay that way.
The waiter was very brief, even in explaining the menu or making recommendations.  One of the waitresses was walking around in grungy sweat pants like she just rolled out of bed.  There were also flies all over that I had to keep shooing away.
The food was really good but it takes more than just good food to run a good restaurant that makes its customers want to come back."}
{"text":"Came here for one of their croissant sandwiches during Oakland's Restaurant Week. It was decent, with a nice portion of crab salad as well as the potatoes (not so sure what's so famous about these, they were good but not particularly memorable). I did wish they heated the croissant though. The surprising thing was that it was ready and brought out to us even faster than ordering a lobster salad sandwich at Quizno's. Probably because they didn't bother heating up the croissant. We also had another side of cole slaw which we found a bit too heavy.

Service left a bit to be desired. It was mostly efficient and focused on getting us seated, taking our orders, and bringing us the food and check at the same time. They didn't really check up on us until we got up to pay at the register."}
{"text":"Best breakfast in the United States. The pancakes are incredible."}
{"text":"Pamela's is one for the books, lemme tell ya. I go there constantly after a late night out with friends. It's the perfect spot. You know it's good because it's always packed, which gets frustrating but is worth the wait! I totally dig the omlettes, although sometimes they are far too cheesy. Otherwise I adore! My sister and I plan to bring my mom down soon so she can get a taste!"}
{"text":"O.M.G. I currently live in Cleveland and I have my favorite breakfast/brunch go to place here (called Coventry Inn). But after going to Pamela's, now I'm depressed that Cleveland doesn't have a brunch place as good as Pamela's! I am craving this spot!

Pamela's is your usual diner spot... place looks a bit homey, a bit dirty, and a bit...local. But that's when you know it's good right? It's got some real homemade cooking into it. If you don't want to listen to my suggestions on what to order, just (i beg you) make sure you order the CORN BEEF HASH. Here's my reviews below now:

Corn Beef Hash (5+): I don't know what they add in there, but that sh*t is delicious and addictive. I took one bite, and it was like my palette was ready for 5 more bowls of it. The corned beef in the hash is so good. They season the corned beef so well that it gives the whole dish this heavenly taste.

Chocolate Chip Banana Hotcakes (5): I think Pamela's called crepes hotcakes. This was just chocolate chip banana crepes. So naturally, it was delicious. The hotcakes was made really well, a bit crispy on the ends. and the melting chocolate with banana was just yummmmmmy.

Go to Pittsburgh, and you better stop at Pamela's. There might be a wait, but trust me, it's worth it. And it's cheap!"}
{"text":"This place is just the best. The good is great. I recommend the crepes and lyoniese potatoes. So so good. It makes me want to travel to Peru (no I don't have my countries mixed up, they have a theme with a few random dishes) but alas the airfare will kill ya for last minute trips to Peru for dinner. Why oh why am I not a billionaire taking trips just for food. All my breakfast love to Pamela's."}
{"text":"Was dying to come here on the weekend, but not if I had to wait in a huge line.  I'm not a line person.  So instead I dropped by on Monday morning.  No line, but still pretty busy.

I had the tex-mex omlete, which totally reminded me of a scaled down Deluca's MOAB.  It was the perfect size.  The toast was great and the potatoes were phenomenal.  The coffee was also good.  The staff was very friendly.  Great spot for breakfast.  CASH ONLY!"}
{"text":"Not sure what was worse the waiter's B.O. (which was akin to a Mumbai locker room) or the fact that this place is most likely owned by the Gambino Crime Family....\"Cash Only.\" The wait is probably the most enjoyable part of this restaurant...which is at least 15-20 min. Our food arrived before we could take off our coats and the check came before I took my first bite of grease. The corned beef looked like mashed goat brains and the pancakes reminded me of Ethiopian sponge bread (apologies to Ethiopia). This is my second time at Pamela's (the first being above average) and most likely my last....unless for some reason I crave food poisoning."}
{"text":"Maybe this is blasphemy of some sort, but Pamela's? I don't know what other people see in it.

There's always a line out the door, so I rarely end up going there.  Why wait when there are 600 million other places within walking distance?

It's cash only, which is basically a business's way of saying \"Hello, customer.  I really hate you, and want to make sure you have to go out of your way to find a way to pay me.\"  It's like when someone intentionally gets a 2-door car when a 4-door model is available.  You only do that if you really hate your passengers.

The food is, well, it's okay! But just okay.  The pancakes are super-greasy.  They're not bad, though.  I do have to put in a word for their corned beef hash, though, because evidently that is excellent.

I would like to one day try their lunch/dinner food, though.  One thing I do love about Pamela's is the price.  It's dirt cheap, and that's great.

But get a credit machine! It's not like you can't afford it! Stop abusing your customers!"}
{"text":"The restaurant is a little small but the food is great. I was in Pittsburgh for just a weekend but had such a great time at breakfast on Saturday that I came back the day right after. Everyone's reviews and recommendations for the hotcakes are correct - my favorite was blueberry! 

If you come at peak hours be prepared to wait a bit but what can you expect with such a popular place? I felt like it was worth the wait and it's a plus that it's on a nice street with lots of unique boutique shops where you can look around. The only bummer is that it's cash only."}
{"text":"Pamela's: Naturally a Pittsburgh staple.

Pamela's is as Pittsburgh as things get.  A fast, easy dining experience, kind caring staff, and Lyonnaise potatoes.

What exactly is the correlation between Lyonnaise potatoes and Pittsburgh?  I don't really know, but the correlation between those potatoes and my tastebuds are pure deliciousness.

What's really cool about Pamela's is that each one has its one personal touch and decor, so it's pretty fun checking out a new one when I go.

I know that I can trust Pamela's for some reliable, consistent and quick basics.

Gail's favorite eggs are my current go to.  Somehow the eggs are perfectly moist, the cream cheese a nice touch, complemented by those Lyonnaise potatoes."}
{"text":"This is absolutely my favorite breakfast place in Pittsburgh.. reasonably priced and the hot cakes are to die for! The home fries and turkey sausage is also outstanding!

Only thing is that this place won't take any cards.. it cost them a 5 star rating! So make sure u have cash when u eat here!

Service is always excellent.. 
Be prepared to wait when school is in session or during busy periods (student check in).. 

For breakfast this is a must go place on the U Pitt campus area!"}
{"text":"This place was literally the worst breakfast I've had in 6 years of traveling around the country. DO NOT EAT HERE!!!"}
{"text":"I love coming here. They are quick, but still polite. Endless coffee refills and an upbeat attitude make it a nice start to the morning."}
{"text":"Great portions, homey service, homey atmosphere, reasonable prices. Classic."}
{"text":"I used to go here after work some Sunday mornings.  I hate to be that person but... the location on Washington Blvd. is better. The pancakes are still amazing but the limeade isn't quite as sweet.  Yes, I had pancakes and limeade in the same meal.  Gotta get that pre-church sugar rush!  The lyonnaise potatoes were still delicious and they always got my eggs perfectly over-medium.  It's always packed on the weekends but the line moves pretty quickly if you have a small group with all the parties present."}
{"text":"Today's special, Rachel turkey wrap. Made w real juicy roasted turkey, slaw, and a very flavorful \"Russian sauce.\""}
{"text":"I miss this place!  This used to be our Sunday Breakfast spot when we lived in Pittsburgh.

Best Crepe Pancakes ever, it's as light as a crepe but not as heavy as a pancake.  The speciality cakes come in 2s, which I always forget to ask about mixing them, a Banana Chocolate and a Banana Walnut.

My other fave is the Corned Beef Swiss omelette.

CA needs a breakfast place like this."}
{"text":"Delicious, unique, amazing hotcakes!!!! Crepe-like and thin, buttery, and exceptionally crispy edges. My first bite was to die for. They're really filling and really buttery so after awhile you feel a bit gross stuffing your face, but it's really, really, really good.

I got the \"morning after breakfast\" which is two eggs, a meat, and hotcakes. It was a perfect combo meal, and I ordered a side of the breakfast potatoes. The potatoes were greasy and not as crispy as I would have liked, but the breakfast overall was really good.

Quick service, busy place, and delicious food!!! It's definitely worth waiting to try the hotcakes here!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service!! The strawberry crepe-hot cakes and the lyonnaise potatoes were out of this world good!"}
{"text":"Came here Sunday noon. Packed. A huuuuge line waiting outside. We waited for 30 mins. Peak hours, this place is always filled to the brim, so prepare accordingly. By 1:30, however, the place empties out, making it a perfect time to visit.

Typical Dinner atmosphere. Super casual. Very loud. Super high noise level. Prepare to talk really loudly. Cash only. Pay at the cashier by the exit after your meal. 

Lunch options on the menu are not served on Sunday.

Super long food wait. Our waiter might've forgot to give our order to the kitchen. Came in to ask us if we ordered, 20 mins after we placed our order. We were starving by the time our food arrived. 

Got chorizo & 2 eggs ($9.25) and corned beef hash & 2 eggs ($9.25). Hearty portions that are served with toast. I got toast substituted for tomato slices. Chorizo was good, nothing crazy. Corned beef hash with two scrambled eggs & cheese was tasty. Huge pile of hash. Well seasoned, not too salty. Enjoyed the meal. 

Overall, nothing extraordinary, but a solid breakfast option. More sweet than savory options on the menu, so a good snack/sweet tooth satisfier option."}
{"text":"After leaving Delucas we found what we consider the best breakfast in Pittsburgh. The food is incredible and the service super friendly. They are located in the strip district."}
{"text":"As a tourist, it was mentioned to me that I needed to have breakfast here before I left. So that is precisely what I did. My two sisters and I strolled in on a Tuesday morning around 11. The main dining room was full, but the room next door was empty and we sat ourselves.

So service is wishy-washy, but it's a diner, so what do you expect? Our drinks were brought out in a timely manner, as were our meals, so I cannot complain.

We each ordered hot cakes, strawberry, blueberry, and banana chocolate chip. We also ordered sausage, bacon, and potatoes. Everything was decent! The portions of hot cakes was really big! Since everyone was talking it up, I was a little underwhelmed, but I did leave satisfied."}
{"text":"I noticed that a couple of trendy places have crept ahead of Pittsburgh's true, best breakfast joint, Pamela's. They may not have a vegan hippie rolling imported organic oats one at a time, or have yogurt cultured with bacteria scraped from the armpits of tibetan monks, but what they do have here is transcendent, albeit unconventional, pancakes at the top of a roster of magnificent diner fare. Those pancakes, a kind of sort of hybrid between flapjacks and crepes--let's call 'em Crepes 'Murican are crazy good straight with butter, or doused in maple syrup, or rolled up around berries and whipped creme. These may not be better than sex, but it's a close call and probably depends upon the company you keep. The pancakes come with bacon or sausage, in a portion that defeated me--a Casey Hampton-esque mountain of a man with an obsessive preoccupation for breakfast food. Maybe it was the the side of lyonnaise potatoes I shared with my companion--and don't be put off by the french name, those taters and just crazy good homefries, some onions tossed in for good measure, fried up in butter until crispy on the side and sumptuously fluffy between. There's a ton of other good stuff here, omelets to fit the taste and whims of a tourbus full of Belgian aristocrats, sausage and chorizo and a lot of other stuff I ignored because, you know, pancakes.  PANCAKES.

Now all and all, it is great that new places are opening and gaining traffic, but this business of Pamela's, with its hundreds of great reviews, showing up below the young pretenders, who've seen a dozen or two dozen reviews, will not stand. Pamela's is still the king--or Queen, if you will. Don't forget it."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious food, melt-in-your mouth lyonnaise potatoes and crepelike pancakes.  It's tiny, cheek-by-jowl and often a long line on the weekends, but worth the wait and the cash-only inconvenience.

I can't speak to anything but the breakfast food since I've never been able to get past it!

My husband and I who lived within walking distance (or waddling distance, when leaving to go home) would normally split a hotcake special with the ham and cheese omelet.  That way we each could get eggs, meat, pancake, and potato cravings fulfilled.  When I went without him, I would either get the breakfast special or the corned beef hash with a side of the hotcake, regular.  My favorite hotcake flavor was the banana and chocolate chip, but occasionally we would get the strawberry or blueberry - don't be afraid by the sour cream ingredient.  It tastes AMAZING, and not too rich. (any richer, with the buttery hotcakes it would be over the top and make it more like dessert than breakfast).

Their hot cocoa is probably from the package, but made decadent by the generous dollop of whipped cream that floats majestically on top.

I once sat next to Franco Harris at the next table.  If he and Obama eat their hearts out here, you'll do fine.  Come try it already!"}
{"text":"CASH ONLY PLACE. Food was great skip the bacon get ham. Crepes were different but really good. Would definitely go again."}
{"text":"Wow, wow, wow!  I have tried crepes, I have tried pancakes, but this was my very first experience with hot cakes. Both crispy and soft at the same time, huge in size, they make for an amazing breakfast. What a treat!  I ordered my with strawberries. My taste buds were pleasantly surprised by extra sugar and cinnamon added inside. Beautiful perfectly cooked combination. 

We came in on a Monday and we happy to be able to find sits right away. Our previous attempt the day before (Sunday) was not nearly as successful as the wait was 40 to 50 min long and we choice to eat elsewhere. I'm glad we made this trip back and tried the hot cakes. 

Restaurant also had a sign \"cash only\" by the entrance. Not sure if they normally don't take cards or if it was a one time event, in any case it might be a problem for some customers and I recommend double checking prior to dining there of cash is an issue."}
{"text":"A Pittsburgh classic and must! First time in Pittsburgh and had to check this place out. The decor is fun and the service and food is amazing! We got the Morning after breakfast special and the Tex-Mex omelette. Both were very flavorful and filling! Our server was also very attentive and friendly!"}
{"text":"We were visiting from out of town on a Friday mid morning, and tried Pamela's on a tip from our hotel.  The food was good, especially the potatoes!  It's a blue collar type place in the middle of what seemed to be Little Mexico, with the street shops and outdoor food markets.  The restaurant was nothing fancy inside or out, but it was light and airy and the service friendly and quick."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness I absolutely love this place! Strawberry hotcakes have brown sugar creme cheese and whipped cream! Also love the chorizo sausage with eggs n hash! Fresh strawberries year round wonderfully delicious !"}
{"text":"6 of us, plus a child went around 8:40 on a Saturday and waited just 10-15 minutes for a table. The place is cute, it's late 50s style and homey with vintage family photos  covering the walls.

So I'm not really a pancake lover, but apparently their special hotcakes are great so I tried a bite and it was too buttery for me, but if that's your type of breakfast, you will be in heaven as there are several different hotcake options. I ordered an egg white omelet with veggies and wheat toast and everything was excellent. Bonus: They bring you an entire pot of coffee! 

There's definitely something for everyone here and I highly recommend checking this place out if you find yourself hungry in Pittsburgh, but go before you're ravenous because there will be a wait."}
{"text":"With its great breakfast food, Pamela's has earned its status as a Pittsburgh institution. However, as a Pittsburgh institution, it is often terribly crowded, especially the location in the Strip District. This location is definitely lacking in acoustics and is often quite loud and chaotic.
The hotcakes, however, are excellent, as are the potatoes. My favorite are the strawberry hotcakes, which are filled with fresh strawberries (none of that preserved stuff), sour cream, and brown sugar. Delicious! I've also enjoyed the banana hotcakes. The coffee is lackluster, but it's a diner, so I wasn't too disappointed. 
This location only takes cash, but there's a PNC ATM right around the corner on Penn, so it's not too much of a problem (provided that you are a PNC customer)."}
{"text":"Pamela's is a classic brunch staple in Pittsburgh. I have many memories here from my college days, and it always brings back great memories when I dine here. After traveling around a bit and living in NYC, I admit I have been spoiled. In college, Pamela's was the best brunch thing to me, but now I've gotten pickier. 

The hot cakes are great as everyone had mentioned. It's a cross between a pancake and a crepe, but leans more towards the latter. I got the Banana Walnut Hotcake, and it definitely hit the spot. I also tried the Tex Mex Omelette, which was tasty as well. It had a little bit of heat, and the side potatoes were good too.

Overall, a solid, safe bet for brunch. Be sure to get there early, as the dining room fills up quickly. Cash only (PNC ATM is across the street). They also grossly underestimate the wait times when I went on busy Sunday mornings."}
{"text":"We met a group of friends at Pamela's for brunch, it was my first time at the restaurant and I loved it. This no-frills place serves the best pancakes that I have eaten in a long time. I had their Blueberry pancakes as part of my breakfast combo. My friends had the strawberry pancakes and the french toast with walnuts. All three dishes were delicious (my mouth is watering just thinking about that meal). 

The pancakes are sort of in between flapjacks and crepes, and the blueberries (fresh ones) were folded into the pancake with sour cream  and brown sugar (which complimented the blueberries beautifully).  The rest of my breakfast was tasty too, but nothing to write home about, especially compared to the pancakes. 

They get very crowded and they will not seat you until your entire party is ready to be seated. Also, they do not accept credit cards (CASH ONLY)."}
{"text":"It's an institution and I love it but I find the service is better at Kelly O's and the food quality might be too. But lyonnaise potatoes are hard. to. beat! Bit pricy for a diner."}
{"text":"Simply put, Pamela's is a Pittsburgh staple.  I regularly go to the one in Shadyside, but have also been to the one in Oakland.  I can't speak for the rest, but I like the one in Shadyside better, simply because the home fries/lyonnaise potatoes (or whatever you call them) are a better consistency and taste better than those in Oakland.  

That aside, the banana chocolate chips hot cakes are to die for.  Seriously.  If you have never gotten them, you must.  You simply cannot live in Pittsburgh but never have had those hotcakes.

My husband gets the omelets and really enjoys them.  The cinnamon raisin french toast is also very very good.  

The only downside is that it's cash only (at least the one in Shadyside is), but meh, going to the ATM is totally worth having such a delicious breakfast.  

Always good (and fast, sometimes surprisingly amazingly fast) service.  Pamela's is one of the best breakfasts in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Any pancakes that are President Obama's favorites are great in my book as well!"}
{"text":"Terrible omelet. Not hot. So bad the cheese isn't melted! Veggies weren't fresh and the plate was watery. My guess is they precook the veggies then dump them into the cooked eggs cold and watery. The mushrooms are canned and may not even have been heated. I will not be back to Pamela's. A place that prides themselves on breakfast should be ashamed to serve such a terrible omelet. 

On a positive note, I was not charged for the omelet or my coffee. I should have tipped the waitress, but I was so upset I just left. For that I am sorry."}
{"text":"If you have not been in here please do stop! its such a good brunch place in my opinion.
Anything and everything you order is always tasty!! If you come to visit PIttsburgh is a nice place to visit, very authentic and good prices. ONe thing to keep in mind is they do not take credit cards so you have to have cash. Great yummy place in the burgh!!"}
{"text":"Yes, the famous place.  This is where Obama had pancakes during the primary season, and liked it so much that he invited Pamela to the White House to make some more.  And the place is regularly featured on the Food Network.  But being only a couple of blocks away from the original Primanti's, could this place be that good?  

Well, I had a fantastic breakfast here.  I had their famous chocolate chip hot cake with bananas and whipped cream.  The pancake is very thin, almost like a crepe, but its texture is crispy which is very surprising and nice.  Also the richness of the butter in the batter really comes through.  The sweetness of the chocolate chips, the whipped cream, and the bananas interplays nicely making for a great dish, and the portion is very generous.  I additionally opted for a side of their Lyonnaise potatoes.  Rustically presented, however, these were delicious too and deserve as much attention.  

Some general notes on the restaurant.  The wait in line to get in early on a Sunday morning was about 20 minutes.  The diner itself is a bit rundown and has a very 50s feel to it.  I think it contrasts very nicely with the quality of the food.  It's not hype, go check it out."}
{"text":"The line may seem intimidating when you walk in the door, but DON'T TURN AROUND! It's absolutely worth your wait. The food is amazing! Huge portions, so flavorful and I'm still talking about how I want to go back! This will be my MUST STOP any time I come to Pittsburgh from now on. And Ron the bus boy is so fabulous. He dances, he smiles and no one loves their job more! A++ for Pamela's!!"}
{"text":"We had an amazing breakfast today! Both of us had the morning after but I substituted handmade chorizo sausage for the offered meats (only .50 more). We also added the house potatoes and toast. The potatoes were cheesy and delish! Worthy notes include: amazing toast ( not sure what it is but I could eat a vat of it), they bring you a POT of coffee (even if you are the only one ordering coffee) plus a glass of water I didn't request but enjoyed, quick and friendly service, and....drum roll....pancakes from heaven. They were thin, light, crispy on the edge and tender as a crepe in the middle. Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"Farewell lunch with the college daughter.  I had corned beef hash and Swiss omelet.  The corned beef was great and fresh.  Lyonaisse potatoes lived up to its reputation.  Hubby and youngest daughter got banana chocolate chip pancakes which were super sweet and  Crispy.  Oldest got blueberry pancakes.  It was filled with giant blueberries and brown sugar and had a slight saltiness to it. Yummy! Food came out fast tho our server never refilled our drinks despite us asking at the counter, hence the three stars instead of four."}
{"text":"I was here the morning after a Steelers game last week. The place was booming even for a Monday! Service was a bit slow, but our waiter was fun. The food was greasy diner food, but so good! I'm not usually a pancake person, but the crepe - like goodness with crispy edges was one of the best I've ever had. It is cash only and the check they give you is not the easiest to decipher. I wasn't sure how much we owed until we got to the register. The location seems cute, but we didn't have time to walk around. If I'm ever back in Pitt, I would definitely stop back."}
{"text":"Pamela's is one of those places I keep taking people to because it feels like I should as a Pittsburgh host. As a restaurant, it's not really my favorite, but it definitely still has its own charm. I'd call it three and a half stars. 

+/- Generous portions. It's normal to pig out at Pamela's, but it's also easy to hate yourself a little after you're done. 
+ Tasty food, both savory and sweet. I like the hotcakes and Lyonnaise potatoes especially!
+ Lots of familiar breakfast food options, so it's a nice place to take guests to. 
- Definitely don't expect to be eating healthy. Butter, carbs, and sugar are all on the menu today. 
- The service has always struck me as pretty brusque. To be fair, they are constantly rushing around with the amount of people they have to serve, but it's not my cup of tea. 
- You'll often have to wait at peak hours, like breakfast/brunch on the weekend. 
- Cash only. You bring your check to the counter when you finish and pay there."}
{"text":"Wayyyyy overrated. There was  nothing even remotely good about this place. Cold eggs, tasteless sausage. My apple juice was $3 and it was about 3 oz, and that is not an exaggeration! 

These infamous pancakes were nothing but some thin batter, with cold strawberries and a clump of brown sugar in the middle. That's the best you've got?

If you're a tourist like me looking for a reasonably edible meal go elsewhere. If you're a drunk college kid looking for a crummy diner, rock on!"}
{"text":"Tasty quick breakfast . I got the pancakes which are quite unique. Crispy edges , thin. Coffee and service were fine. I will be visiting again I think before my next Steelers game !"}
{"text":"We stayed over in Pittsburg on drive home and thanks to yelp found this place. Boy oh boy am I glad I have yelp! This is one of the top 5 breakfasts I've ever had. I had Tex Mex Omelette with chorizo and it was awesome! Son had chocolate chip and banana hot cakes and it was even better (and I'm not a sweet breakfast eater). The chocolate was not too sweet which made for a great match with the bananas, no syrup necessary. I will definitely return on next trip to area. May even make up a reason to come back just for Pamela's. There wasn't a breakfast over $7. We went Tuesday at 1pm and were sat right away."}
{"text":"I am so bummed and disappointed that my Pamela's experience was less than stellar.  I haven't been here in maybe 10 years and it is not at all as I had remembered.

We went on a Sunday and I expected a wait, which was fine.  We were seated within 45 minutes - which again, is standard.

It's almost communal seating with how close the tables are.  They cram about 60 people in a space that was intended for 30, so be prepared to bump elbows with your neighbor.  However, I tried to not let this bother me, because I was expecting a phenomenal meal.

I will touch on the service. They were busy, but our waitress was slightly cold and barely around. Again, I was willing to brush this off for the delicious food I anticipated.

This was one of the most disappointing food experiences I've had in Pittsburgh. My boyfriend ordered the Tex Mex omelette.  It was average, but not restaurant quality.  The only thing that made it somewhat decent was sour cream and guacamole.  This average omelette was still FAR better than what I had.  His omelette is the only reason I'm giving them two stars.

I wanted to keep it simple so I ordered the French Toast.  It had absolutely zero flavor.  I'm not sure how bread with sugar, butter and syrup can have zero taste.  To combat its lack of flavor, I doused those puppies in maple syrup.  After about a 75 second pour, I figured that could suffice and give this meal the kick it needed.  Somehow, this French Toast became a vortex and sucked up all the maple syrup, making it more sugary and less flavorful all at once. I ate about 2 bites and left the rest. It wasn't worth even trying to eat for absolutely zero taste.  I also had a side of Oscar Mayer microwave bacon for $3.

Needless to say, we won't be going back for quite some time!"}
{"text":"The strawberry crepe style pancakes are something that I look forward to every visit home to Pittsburgh. They truly are worth the hype. Very delicious. I've never really had anything bad here, but I mostly stick to the strawberry pancakes. It is cash only and it gets busy, so hit the ATM beforehand and plan to wait. Don't be too intimidated by a big crowd waiting though; the tables clear pretty quickly and it won't take as long as you think to be seated."}
{"text":"Don't let the crowd up front waiting for a seat deter you somewhere else. It's worth the wait, and it'll move quick. I promise. On a cold, chilly Sunday morning it was packed, yet our wait was less than 20 minutes. Service was prompt. I went with my diner \"usual\" of egg-cheese-veg omelet and toast (YUMMMM), and he had the banana chocolate chip pancakes (sweet, but not too, chocolate, but not too much, and the OMG whipped cream...can I just get some of that, please?). Both washed down with coffee (you get your own mini-pot at the table for those who chug with their breakfast), and water (which was frequently refilled, also good for the morning recovery). This isn't your typical \"greasy spoon\" place...instead, brighter (read lots of pink and other happy colors), kinder, and overall, a pleasant experience. And you don't leave smelling like the griddle, but be prepared, cash only."}
{"text":"Went for lunch and it was significantly less impressive than breakfast. I got the grilled cheese which was all right. The onion rings ... also all right. I liked T's fries better. Still a good, cheap option but I think I'll stick with breakfast and their FABULOUS crepe pancakes."}
{"text":"Best breakfast I've ever had! The food came out so fast it was unreal. My omelette was huge and it comes with amazing crunchy potatoes and super good thick Italian bread. The hot cakes are really thin like crepes but are delicious. The staff was very kind and the food is reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Butter enthusiasts of the world: This is your mecca.  The Lyonnaise potatoes are coated with butter's savory, salty goodness, yet are somehow not too greasy! It was shockingly easy to wolf down an entire plate in 10 minutes. They were the best home fries I have *ever* had. 

Crispy buttery edges also graced my delicious chocolate chip pancakes. Loved the salty-sweetness.

Despite the long waits, this is a surprisingly good spot for groups. Most of the tables are large. So my husband and I, a party of two, ended up waiting longer than several parties of 4 or 5 that arrived after us. 

Don't miss the small display of classic artifacts near the cash register, including Barack Obama's handwritten note that \"I love those pancake!\" [sic] 

Cash only!"}
{"text":"Pamela's you were everything I wanted you to be and more. 

* Expect a wait (we only had a 5 minute wait, but after we were seated lines wrapped around the building and were up to 30-40 minutes) But don't worry the line moves fast. This resto is huge and they turn tables quickly. 

Loved the decor. 
Loved the colors. 
Loved the atmosphere. 
LOVED THE CREPE HOTCAKES. 

What is a crepe hotcake? Exactly like it sounds, a thinner pancake, a thick crepe? Somewhere in between crisped up on the edges served either plain with butter and syrup or rolled with fruit and cream cheese. We got the fresh strawberry ones, and I thought serving it with cream cheese would be heavy but it totally wasn't. The strawberries are fresh and not the weird syrup stuff. Overall I can't stop thinking about how unusual and delicious this dish was. Highly recommend! 

We also got scrambled eggs with chives and sour cream in them, something I wouldn't normally get, and we devoured this plate. The eggs were the fluffiest, best texture I have ever had. I don't know how they did this! 

Take a walk while you wait down the strip, this spot is not to be missed!!!"}
{"text":"I had an average experience overall at Pamela's. Parking was difficult, but that's usually the case anywhere in Oakland. I went with a group on a busy Sunday morning, so I expected the service to be a little slow and it was. No big deal. The restaurant is small and when it's super busy like it was it can definitely get really crowded inside. I got the banana walnut hotcakes and their \"Famous Lyonnaise\" potatoes. The hotcakes were fine, they very sweet and crepe-like, as they're described on the menu. They were good, but not anything I personally found particularly amazing. Putting butter or syrup on the hotcakes makes them turn soggy really quickly because of how thin they are. The potatoes were really tasty, they were seasoned well and very flavorful. The potatoes were a little expensive for how small of a portion you get. I've definitely had better breakfast experiences elsewhere for the same price, but I wouldn't say I had a bad experience here. Just average."}
{"text":"What can I say, Pamela's is a classic when visiting the strip district! Even though there is a Pamela's within walking distance to my house in shadyside, I will always prefer this location. 

Usually I order the hot cakes, but this visit I decided to try something new. I went with the veggie omelet and added jalapeños with wheat toast and potatoes on the side. The potatoes were amazinggggg. The omelette was good, but I expected the veggies to me fried into the eggs. Maybe I'm just a newbie with omelettes and didn't know any better. 

My boyfriend got the hash and LOVED it. How can you not with all of that cheese melted on top!! 

Overall, a very good experience. We had a attentive waitress who filled my water glass literally as soon as I needed it filled, it's like she could read my mind. 

I will be back!"}
{"text":"New Yorkers.... if you like Clinton St. Bakery, this is Pittsburgh's answer. Their pancakes are the best I ever had. I had banana walnut once that was unbelievable. I am a sucker for corned beef hash and this was the best I've had as well. Really, this place is a national treasure."}
{"text":"Came here based on the reviews and OMG Pamela's did not disappoint! In a cute quaint area with nice shops all around & is a retro but contemporary feeling decor.  and the food was the BOMB.COM with super fast, friendly service."}
{"text":"Pamela's is great.  The pancakes are crêpe-like, crispy on the edges, and still have a pancake flavor.  Sometimes though, the pancakes can be a little too greasy.  This place gets packed, so if you don't come right at 9am on the weekends, be prepared to wait.  Also, it's cash only, but there are plenty of ATMs in the area."}
{"text":"I have 3 words for you:
Corned beef hash (frankly, that might only be two words, but you get my drift.)

It was AMAZING-you have to try it to believe it. It's a special and bit always on the menu, but never fear, there are other lovely treats for you to try too.

If you want an awesome breakfast in Pittsburgh, then Pamela's is your place.

The crepe pancakes with banana, walnuts and whipped cream are heavenly! 

I recommend getting a savory breakfast for one person and a sweet for the other person and sharing. 

Cash only-so don't forget the green!

The servers are very nice and helpful.

Expect a line on the weekends-a place this good has to be busy!

Don't expect fru fru coffee drinks or hand squeezed orange juice-but do expect excellent food!"}
{"text":"Went to Pitt for Family weekend recently and actually ate at Pamela's twice in the weekend.  First was lunch.  The girls had breakfast food, I went with the burger.  Gotta say, burger was diner good.  Great taste, fresh bun, done just right.  Loved it.  The girls omelets were also very good.  Next day we went for breakfast before leaving for home.  Couple of us had the strawberry crepes.  Simply put...awesome!  Shared sides of the potatoes.  As my daughter says, they were bangin!  It was truly diner food with a fun, whimsical atmosphere.  Service was fast and friendly.  Would prefer the use of credit cards.  Overall enjoyed the place, we'll be back"}
{"text":"Wow. This is one of the best breakfast places I have ever had! A really delicious place. I would go back again and again!"}
{"text":"Don't be deceived by the nondescript \"PAMELA'S RESTAURANT\" sign in the sketchy font out front. The interior of this place is cozily modern, and the food is fantastic:

- Home fries: cooked to a mealy perfection, then smashed before frying in order to maximize their crisp-able surface area. They must put some kind of cheese in them to get it that lovely golden brown color and perfectly crunchy texture. 
- Hotcakes: kind of like a thick crepe, but better. Each bite is different - sometimes sweet, sometimes a little saltier, fruitier, other times crunchier. Delicious every single time. 
- Omelettes: Their egg white omelettes do a great job posing as normal eggs. The fillings are fresh and flavorful without overpowering the flavor of the egg. 
- Toast: Yes, even their toast is excellent. Crisp on the outside, soft and fluffy on the inside. And their toast comes pre-buttered - taking care of that pesky cold-butter-on-hard-toast problem.

It's greasy spoon brunch fare at its very best. My parents ate here two days in a row, which says a lot because they're Asians from Asia and typically don't like greasy American-style brunch foods. I'm an Asian from America and typically don't like to agree with my parents, but I'll make an exception for Pamela's. This place is amazing."}
{"text":"Huge delicious servings. My wife and I were blown away by how good the food was and how huge the portions were for the price. Their crepe pancakes rock especially the banana pecan ones."}
{"text":"This is the best breakfast out I've had in a long while ... and breakfast is a great meal for eating out.  Jess and I ordered two things and swapped.  The crepe style pancakes stuffed with blueberries were just delectable (they are served with whipped cream that we asked to be left off ).  The Mexican style omelet (is anything better than Mexican?  I don't think so!) with chorizo is one of the best things I've had.  Yummmmmmeeeee!  And, Pamela's is in the Strip, a wonderful collection of ethnic markets, bakeries, and other stores in the shadows of Pittsburgh's central business district.  This is a do not miss if you are passing through Pittsburgh or if you live there.

BTW, Pittsburgh has kind of a bad rep ... I really liked it.  Good museums, pretty campi to walk around (Pitt, CMU) if you like visiting colleges (which I do), a fairly vibrant Downtown, charming Squirrel Hill, lots of restaurants to choose from, etc.  About an hour away to the south is the Laurel Highlands that features two Frank Lloyd Wright houses, Falling Water and Kentuck-Knob; rafting on the Ohio Pyle/Youghigeny Rivers, biking on the rivers' side trails, and beautiful scenery.  Definitely worth a day or two in Western PA."}
{"text":"You better go on an empty stomach because there is a TON of food coming your way!

If you go, you need to get the pancakes - but these aren't just any pancakes. It's a combo of a crepe/griddle cake/pancake. 

I went on a Thursday morning, was seated right away. Within 10 minutes, I had plates all around me and I was digging in. I don't think I even finished half of what I had! 

Be sure to bring cash with you when you go since they don't take plastic - but you don't need much cash!"}
{"text":"Clear your schedule and pull up a chair at Pamelas. Everything will make you feel like you're moving in slow motion for the rest of the day, but the breakfast is unbeatable. The potatoes could launch a thousand ships--I love mixing them all up with two overeasy eggs and plenty of ketchup and dipping in a thick buttered slice of Italian toast from the bakery just down the road. Meanwhile, I steal pinches off of my wife's strawberry hotcakes (crepes style)--the crispy deep fried edges are a party for your mouth. 

You'll have a short wait if you come on the weekend--but service is snappy and plates land on your table in 10 minutes flat. 

You'll get similar fare at each location, but I've experienced some mess-ups at the Mt Lebo location (which truly feels like an outpost--austere boxy room crammed with tables). Lipstick on the water glass (no biggie--it happens) and plastic wrap in my omelette (unpleasant in the mouth). Both these incidents occurred on the same visit, so I will chalk it up to an off day for a newer restaurant. Anyway, they gave us a fee meal on our next visit, but I'd stick to the Strip if you have a choice."}
{"text":"CASH ONLY!
CASH ONLY!
CASH ONLY!
CASH ONLY!
CASH ONLY!

Pamela's is in the Strip area and is a great place for breakfast.  From pancakes to egg dishes to their famous lyonnaise potatoes - they are all good.

Did I mention they only accept CASH?"}
{"text":"Love this place! All the food is delicious and lots of options, I always have a hard time deciding what I want to order, whether its the delicious pancakes or the croissant french toast (my mouth is watering just thinking about it!) The only thing I'm not a big fan of is the corned beef hash - super salty! But other than that, great portions, great taste, great atmosphere. 

It's cash only but there are multiple ATMs close-by so no excuse to not try this place if you haven't already!"}
{"text":"My first time trying croissant French toast and I must say the best French toast I ever had! My waiter was very welcoming and sweet she was prompt with accommodating everything I needed. It was pretty packed that Saturday but it's things to do in the area while waiting. If I'm not on my usual diet I would definitely go again when I'm visiting in town!"}
{"text":"Pamela's is an abomination of a breakfast place that represents the worst of everything.  However, to make up for the food being awful, you will have to wait on line for 20 minutes and then dine in cramped and uncomfortable seating.

It is, for some reason, unfathomably popular.  The best thing on the menu is their crepe-like pancakes, which are nicely crisped on the edges.  They are nicely crisped on the edges because they are cooked in a disgusting margarine-like substance that always leaves me, personally, feeling a bit ill.  The coffee is forgettable, the eggs are passable, the bacon is inevitably chewy -- which right there should cause someone to be marched out to the firing squad -- and their lyonnaise potatoes are insultingly limp (and, like the pancakes, soaked in margarine).

If you are dragged here by your friends, find new friends.  If you can't do that, then try to get one of the pancakes that come with some sort of whipped or sour cream.  Not because they're better, mind you, but because at least the cream will help balance the fat that comes from a machine with fat that, at some point in its history, came from a cow.

Better alternatives to Pamela's in Pittsburgh:  on the 'nice' end, Coca Café or even Square Café, on the 'greasy spoon' end either DeLuca's or JoJo's.

Frankly, I think I'd rather eat the completely boring and institutional breakfasts at Eat and Park than go to Pamela's again.  At least they have heard of this thing called \"butter.\""}
{"text":"We were in Pittsburgh for a penguins game over the weekend and decided to try a local diner for breakfast. We were rewarded by an amazingly delicious breakfast in a quaint diner setting. Service was incredible! The staff was friendly, our coffee mugs stayed full, and our food came out fast and hot. The pancakes were to die for!! We both had their pancakes with breakfast meat, potatoes, & eggs and had too much food to possibly eat! Portions were huge, prices were low, and the food was delicious. We will definitely stop here again next time we are in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"Great food with great service. Place can get pretty busy on the weekends. Don't forget that they are cash only!  There's an ATM right around the corner though."}
{"text":"The blueberry hotcakes were unbelievable! The lyonnaise potatoes were also delicious. Definitely worth the wait."}
{"text":"3.5 stars, really. When we were in college, Pamela's was THE brunch place of choice, and I doubt much has changed if you're a Carnegie Mellon or Pitt student. But now that I've been out in the adult world, I have to admit that Pamela's is more about the nostalgia than the food for me.

To be clear, their crepes, omelettes, and Lyonnaise potatoes are fantastic. Greasy, but delicious. Everything else is fine, but nothing to write home about.

Pamela's is a Pittsburgh tradition, though, and I do think that counts for something. Don't knock it till you try it, and definitely try it once or twice. Be prepared to wait if you're going at a peak time (like brunch on a weekend) but other than that, I would say I've always had good service.

Tip: they do not accept credit cards, so be sure you have cash. Also, parking can be tough, so give yourself time to look around the side streets for a spot."}
{"text":"Probably the great breakfast I have ever had in my entire life. My day is set here in Pittsburgh simply by stopping by at Pamela's. My Amazing uber driver recommended this place. He was legit. The beautiful girl who helped me gave me the greatest suggestions and I literally don't want to stop eating it. I got the mornin after breakfast special with the specialty hot cake! Oh my! You guys have no idea how amazing it is! The art work...:the art work is simply beautiful and fun and happy and just amazing. Come here! This place deserves 10 stars! They are simply amazing!"}
{"text":"One of the best breakfasts ever. Awesome diner feel. Friendly service. Delicious corned beef hash. Addictive. And the best pancakes i've ever eaten - really unique and perfect texture. I wish i had a place like this near me. As good as it gets."}
{"text":"After living in Pittsburgh for five years, I finally woke up on Saturday morning and decided that it was time to try Pamela's! The hubby and I headed down to Shadyside and got on the waiting list after 10:30. It took less than a half hour to get our table in the crowded and (very) noisy diner. 

Service was prompt, and we ordered enough food for four people! I really enjoyed my Chocolate Chip Banana Hotcakes. The light and crispy hotcakes were wrapped around little chocolate chips, banana slices, and whipped cream. So tasty! My side of turkey sausage and scrambled eggs were descent diner fare but nothing above average.

Overall, I had a nice experience at Pamela's and would rate the food/establishment 3 1/2 stars. However, there are other breakfast/brunch competition in Pittsburgh that will continue to get my business over Pamela's."}
{"text":"One of the better breakfast spots in Pittsburgh!! Great food that is homemade and quick service. Need to get there quick, because seats fill up fast!"}
{"text":"Oh. My. Word.

I'll start by saying that I am a die-hard waffle person, through and through. Given the choice, I'd have a waffle every day of the week including Sundays and holidays. As the inimitable Leslie Knope once said: \"We need to remember what's important in life: friends, waffles, and work.\" As of yesterday, though, I might have to rethink my stance on the waffle vs. pancake debate.

Yesterday, in the cool light of the morning, I saw God in the most incredible stack of crepe-style pancakes this side of the Atlantic Ocean. These are not your Saturday morning box pancakes. They're not even the golden, fluffy kind you stumble into your local diner for in the wee hours of the morning.

That's because these pancakes are not pancakes. They're religious objects. They're the very personification of whatever deity you worship here on earth. Hell, I haven't been to church in five years but I might just go back and light a candle for these pancakes. God bless them.

Please, please, PLEASE do yourself a favor and order a stack of these pancakes. The fries are great, and I'm sure the rest of their menu is just as drool-worthy, but if you really want to experience some sort of celestial happiness: Get. The. Pancakes.

I'll be back, Pamela's.

Love,
A Former Waffle Person"}
{"text":"Pamela worth me visit once per month at least! Enjoy our brunch several time for my boyfriend and I, Pamela foods special and awesome as usual. We used to order omelet  (with my favorite potato as a side-almost $8)and hot cake (almost$9)separately( these two highly recommend) but now we decided to order \"The morning after breakfast special\" (almost$8)from now on since it's included two eggs, three sausages(there are many choice in Manu) and a complete dish of hotcake(plus extra $2)! Other than that, coffee is refillable. It's cash only. In sum, we will come back soon!"}
{"text":"Recommend by several senior student of mine in CMU, finally I came here today for my dear friends birthday. Food in here really amazing and served very fast. Associates in Pamela's also very kind and sweet. But they only receive cash no credit card such a pity.  Love this dinning experience and will come back very soon :D"}
{"text":"I made the dire mistake of making my way to P&G's during Mother's Day. That was MY mistake. But I had walked from my hotel downtown and was on my own, I wasn't about to turn around. Not to mention my short stay in Pittsburgh wasn't going to allow me to come back another day. So, with the hopes that being on my own would play to my advantage, I went in. And, it did. The very unenthused hostess informed me that I could wait for a spot at the bar and, after staring intently at the bar, willing people to hurry up, I only waited about a half hour before getting myself a seat on Mother's Day!
I knew from the get-go that the pancakes were happening for me. In fact, P&G's only popped up on my radar after I checked Yelp for the best place in Pittsburgh to get pancakes. But after seeing an order of hash pass by me, I had to order a side of that too. So I got a short stack of pancakes, strawberries on top (I felt like the stuffed pancakes would be just a little TOO much for me) and a side of that yummy looking hash. 
As always, fellow Yelpers led me to the best place. These pancakes were more like crepes in consistency, thin, buttery and crispy on the outside and yet... somehow maintained it's pancake-y taste. Definitely quenched the craving. The hash was the perfect salty antithesis to the sweetness of the pancakes, not something I would order on its own, but somehow worked as a side to the buttery star of the show. 
Yet, only 3 stars? That's largely due to the service. From beginning to end, the service was non-existent. The girl at the counter seemed bored, the girl at the bar (where I sat) seemed annoyed, and the plethora of servers who came back there to get coffee or waters for their tables just appeared hurried, not approachable AT ALL. In fact, when it came time for asking for my water to be refilled (after patiently waiting at least 15 minutes with nobody noticing my glass had been empty), the girl I asked made it seem like it was completely inconvenient for her to do so. The ONLY person in that entire building who seemed like he was happy was the man clearing plates, dancing to his own tune as he was doing so, and put a smile on my face too. It's too bad the rest of them didn't take after this guy.
I always find it so unfortunate when a great place, with great food become less attractive because of the people that work there. Service matters, darlings, take note."}
{"text":"Good value for the dollar. I had a western omelette and the lyonnaise potatoes.  Both were good. Service
WS speedy and efficient. This is a great
Place to grab breakfast and go. Two small issues. First they are cash only. Second, due to the high noise level it's not a good place to have a meal and chat. The flat unfinished walls may play a role in the noise level."}
{"text":"The Tex Mex Omelet is the best. And now that you can use the app No Wait- I come here more often. Often the line is very long on Sat and Sun mornings and this makes it very easy to check in and go for a walk, get a coffee, or just do it at home and walk over. I have never been disappointed in Pams... not to mention they have the best chocolate milk ever!"}
{"text":"Delicious!! Had the choc chip & banana hotcakes and absolutely loved it. There was a long wait, but we got lucky with open counter space. I would definitely recommend this place and come back the next time I'm in Pittsburgh"}
{"text":"This was a great experience ! We all say a diner is a diner but this place is unique they make their food from scratch and different ! The grilled cheese was on Texas Toast and very good... Ez on the butter next time.. There home fries are amazing and different from any other diner I been to!!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast in Pitt hands down. The omelette are super good. Must try if you visit pitt"}
{"text":"Okay...don't be scared away by the wait. We waited 30 mins and it was well worth it! The time moved fast because the location is bustling with interesting people all around you. Once we were seated the food came super fast and was delicious! We had the stuffed specialty hotcakes.
Pro:
-Awesome food.
-Great location
-Nice decor and environment

Cons:
-Cash only
-Bill hand written and hard to read and catch errors
-Cash only"}
{"text":"I hate to do this but I just had too. This place came highly recommended and I love egg white omelettes. Mine however had a great big hair in the center. Waitress was really nice. Never did get to eat."}
{"text":"This place is the best hands down period breakfast in Pittsburgh. Decor is so cool. A must must go!!!!!"}
{"text":"I came here on a weekday afternoon with a friend and we had a zero wait time. It was wonderful way to start meal=) The waitress was super friendly and helpful. I had the tex mex omelet and the walnut caramel croissant french toast. I devoured everything. The croissant french toast was a perfect balance of sweetness and buttery goodness covered in bits of walnuts that gave it a nice texture. 

Weekday brunch is the way to go."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast on The Strip. We had a party of eight today and even though it was busy we didn't have a very long wait. When checking in...you simply write your name and number in your party on the list at the front desk. They will call for the party both inside and out...so feel free to wait outside as it can get crowded in the front entrance. This place is cash only but there is a PNC ATM just around the corner. The food came out quickly and everything was delicious. I had the chorizo hash with scrambled eggs and tortillas. If it is your first time here, get one of the crepe-style hotcakes...chocolate chip banana is always my favorite!"}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast. Bring your appetite. Only downside is the coffee- it's VERY weak.  Come early. The hot cakes are amazing.  You get 2 that can be shared. The banana chocolate chip ones are amazing! The add a few squirts of whipped cream which just makes the dish.  It can get kind of loud when it's busy, but not too bad. It has a fun 50's decor. My husband always gets the California French toast, you get 4 big pieces.  You will not be hungry after finishing your meal here!"}
{"text":"Very good diner with breakfast and lunch options! I got the two eggs scrambled with bacon and potatoes which was all very good! The potatoes aren't your average hash browns but they are super yummy. The service was also very good and the food came out so quickly it took maybe 5 minutes. The food was a little greasy but I think that's just the style of the diner and it still tasted good. There also was no wait to eat which was nice even though it seemed very crowded."}
{"text":"A friend treated my husband and I to breakfast here a couple Saturdays ago. We were seated right away. I tried the special, which was croissant french toast with pecans and caramel sauce. Pretty unique dish, rich and yummy. My side of bacon was a bit floppy, which was a turn-off for me. 

The waitress was young and maybe a bit over-attentive -- she frequently interrupted our conversations to ask if everything was okay, which is a pet peeve of mine. Other than that the other servers were mostly pretty young college kids, a bit apathetic and talkative, but I can let it slide.

We'll definitely give this place another go in a few weeks!

Beware: CASH ONLY!"}
{"text":"My family has been eating here for years.  The quality of food is consistent and this is one of the most reliable places you can head to in the entire country (yes, country!) for a good breakfast!  Much has been written about Pamela's so I won't be the umpteenth reviewer raving about the lyonnaise potatoes or crepe pancakes.  I will say that this is one of my favorite places to eat in Pittsburgh.  Forget Primanti's, Pamela's is the face of Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"Tried for the first time today, even though they were super busy we got seated and waited on right away. Our food came seriously within 5 minutes. I got eggs (which were cooked much better than other places), potatoes, bacon and toast. The potatoes were awesome! Had to try a banana chocolate chip pancake...amazing! It's a pet peeve of mine if a server doesn't come back and check on us. She was friendly though. I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Not that long of a wait. Cash only, prices are good. Morning after is great. Love the crepes and atmosphere is classic. Worth the stop."}
{"text":"Pamela's

It's very rare that I eat breakfast out, the reason being is that most breakfasts served in restaurants are so basic or banal that they aren't worth paying for. The ones who have special items charge ridiculously high prices and having been in this industry for over 30 years I get repulsed at paying such exorbitant amounts for food that has such a infinitesimally low food cost.

With that being said I can honestly say that Pamela's is a breakfast restaurant that I would frequent often if I lived in Pittsburgh. Their service was fast, no that's wrong it was faster then fast, drinks order, drinks, food order, and bam food on the table. We were never rushed but the speed was phenomenal. Also a special shout out to our server, a professional waitress, probably been working tables for 40 years and it showed - in a great way.

Super friendly, offered spot-on suggestions, and just made for a great pleasant start of a day. Thank you so much for being you.

On to the food, we had the Chorizo omelet, filled with chorizo, sour cream, cheese and avocado, mildly spicy but good, the Lyonnais potatoes were not mushy or greasy and had some nice caramelized corners to them making them something I would serve at our house. Two slices of toast accompanied this feast and it filled me up.

We also tried the banana chocolate pancake, which is more of a crepe style pancake stuffed with bananas and chocolate chips of course a dollop of whipped cream on top. Again a very filling dish, but oh so good.

Pamela's is really a fancy diner - there menu is not extensive, but what we had was good and the value was there. Overall damage for two plus drinks under $20 with tip. Wow a typical diner experience in Spokane  would have set us back at least $ 25 and the food would have been mediocre and the service average.

5 Stars because it's been one of the best diner experiences and best values I have had for breakfast in a long time."}
{"text":"Came from Texas and had to try this amazing Cafe. Great choice, great people, amazing food. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I stopped between my 2 Dr's appointments. The staff was ok. They gave us time to look over the menu, but really our server wasn't too friendly. She came back once to check on us.

My husband ordered a hot turkey sandwich with fries and he said it was great. I ordered a BLT and fries. The fries were very good, my sandwich was ok. There was no mayo on it and my one piece of bread was brunt. 

I thought the prices were a bit high for the food too. 

Overall, it was good and it's a nice place to stop and eat somewhere different, when you live 2 hrs away and have a 2 hr break between Dr's appointments."}
{"text":"There is not much I can say about Pamela's that has not already been said but if you are reading this, just know that if you have not been to a Pamela's in Pittsburgh and have the opportunity, don't pass it up. In fact, this morning while eating a family sat next to us and the husband asked me, \"Is this place any good?\"  They were from out of town and visiting. I let them know that their decision to come here would not be regretted and that before moving to Pittsburgh myself, I use to drive over from NE Ohio a few times a year for it!  I may have also told them that Pamela's is the reason I moved to Pittsburgh!  After they ate, they said the thought I was joking but now weren't sure.

Known for their thin, crispy and large Hot Cakes, you may also want to try the specialty Hot Cakes that are more similar to crepes filled with fruits, creams and the sort. But don't let the deter you from trying their traditional breakfast offerings of eggs, bacon, sausage and of course the other famous Pamela's dish, Lyonnaise Potatoes.  They will cook your eggs to order but over easy is my favorite.  And don't overlook the Hash dishes either.  Corned Beef Hash and Chorizo Hash are two of my favorites.  

Needless to say, I have a hard time picking what I want here! But today I think after all these years I finally found the perfect order that gives you the best bang for your buck along with variety so here it is:  Order the Morning After which gives you Two Eggs, Choice of Meat and 2 Hot Cakes for $8.95. Then, pay the up charge of $2 to make the Hot Cakes Specialty Hot Cakes of your choice (Banana Walnut hint hint ;) and finally an order of Lyonnaise Potatoes for $3.50. All that for under $15 and you have a taste of all the best here!  They will bring the Hot Cakes on a separate plate so if you are like me, you mix everything else up and have yourself a nice makeshift Hash.

Just a few final comments and you can be in your way to Pamela's but before you go, you need to know these two things. 1) Cash Only...I know I know, just go with it! 2) It's a popular place, especially in the weekend. You may have to wait but it is worth it. Hop inside and get your name on the list and enjoy some conversation with your friends and family until your table is ready.  I promise you, you will not regret it!"}
{"text":"One the absolute top breakfast spots for me!  Easily in my top 3. Yes there is normally a line but it moves at a good pace. They get you in and get you out. Yes it is cash only. If you are reading this, now you know. Take cash! If you don't read this and just show up, any number of signs will tell you cash only. Go get cash!

Now that that is out of the way, I can't think of anything not to like about this place. I love the crepe style hotcakes especially the Chocolate Chip Banana Hotcakes with Whipped Cream. And it is real whipped cream. They have a crispy layer and so much flavor. And they are big! An order of eggs any style, sausage and Lyonnaise Potatoes tops the order off. Those potatoes are phenomenal! Add a little hot sauce and you have a real winner.  If you find yourself here you absolutely must try the hotcakes if nothing else. The other items are a small step above most diners but you come for the hotcakes.

It's a busy place and the staff is rushing around like crazy to get everyone taken care of so they really didn't have time to be rude or ignore you. They were attentive, helpful with questions and fast. Let's put it this way, after a 30 minute wait we were seated, ate and paid (with cash) in under another 30 minutes. 

One thing I did find a little strange is that the restrooms are upstairs.  But you get to walk through a pretty cool foreign gift shop to get to them so all is good. Sorry, I can't remember the ethnicity of the gift shop but I spent a little time looking around and found it fascinating.  Check it out!"}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast! A must if in Pittsburgh. Food was excellent, will return when in Pittsburgh.  Nostalgic interior."}
{"text":"Awesome Pancakes!!!! Fantastic breakfast potatoes!  Definitely going back when I am in town."}
{"text":"We asked at the front desk of our hotel for a good breakfast place.  We were told Pamela's was it, the best in town.  I don't agree with it being the best.  The food was just your typical greasy spoon diner style.  The decor was great, based on classic board games.  I wouldn't rate the service very high, either.  The hostess didn't greet us at all when we came in, and our waitress seemed to have somewhere else she'd rather be.  She wasn't friendly and didn't even check on us after delivering our food.  All in all, just an average visit.  I'm from out of town, so I can't even give the place another chance after hearing so many great reviews and recommendations."}
{"text":"MMMM crepes. If you've had crepes as ihop or other breakfast restaurants, take that and multiple it by 100 notches of yummy breakfast goodness. Then, kick that up 10 more times. And there you will find Pamela's nestled between strawberry crepes and banana chocolate chip hot cakes. If you're in Pittsburgh, it's a law (unofficially) that you must have a Primanti's sandwich and breakfast at Pamela's. MMMMM crepes."}
{"text":"Excellent Breakfast experience.
Good food, featuring intriguing options to choose. I had the chorizo hash with 2 eggs ($8.95) and coffee. I liked the retro decor, good mix of repo and original.
Service was very good.
Really, this place is everything I look for in a weekend breakfast experience.
One watch out...the area that you use to wait for a table seems to crowd some of the tables up front of the restaurant...
Btw...they only take cash."}
{"text":"This diner is always crowded and demands a long wait especially for weekend brunches.  For Pittsburgh food/brunch, I would recommend this place but food is a little greasy (typical for brunch places). I can be picky about brunch places, since many of them can taste similar, so I would recommend coming here but it's not deserving of 4-stars in my book."}
{"text":"This place has the best pancakes I've ever had. They have the perfect balance of buttery savoriness, crunch, and sweet. I usually get the banana walnut with whip cream pancakes. Service is always great and the vibe is casual and comfortable for a breakfast place."}
{"text":"The Hot cakes are incredible.  It's like eating a buttery cloud.  I think Jesus gave Pamela the recipe in a dream to promote heaven on earth.  The only problem is that I could only eat one of the three hot cakes and will have to take them back to Cleveland for my wife to try.  This is my second business trip to Pitt and a stop at Pamela's is officially a tradition with this visit."}
{"text":"OK, let's get one thing straight first.  You're not allowed to call yourself a \"diner\" if you close at 3 or 4 in the afternoon.  You're barely a low-end cafe.  If I can't get breakfast for dinner, you don't belong anywhere NEAR the diner category--and at Pamela's, you can't get ANYTHING for dinner, because they're not even open.  So change the name.

Now onto the food.  When I first moved to Pittsburgh, I couldn't wait to try this place.  I love brunch, and the rave reviews had me salivating.  And my first trip was pretty good!  The stuffed crepes are really tasty.  The line on weekends is out of control, but I thought it was understandable if my first dish was representative of their offerings.  Spoiler Alert: It was not.

Every subsequent visit has been a massive disappointment.  The salads are mediocre; the sandwiches are nothing special; the sides are middling at best; and their \"chorizo\" tastes like a frozen school cafeteria sausage patty pan-fried with a pack of Ortega taco spices.

That people will wait even a few minutes for anything but the stuffed crepes is a mind-boggling mystery, and the hours people spend lingering outside these doors say more about the sad state of local brunch offerings than anything about the cuisine inside.

They do one thing well, and it's the only reason for the second star on this rating.  So if you're in the mood for stuffed crepes and the line isn't long, by all means, hit up Pamela's.  I won't be coming back until they change the menu, the name, and/or the hours."}
{"text":"Will definitely go back. We had the Pittsburgh hash and the crispy malted waffle and both were fantastic. First time in PItt and found on Yelp. Waited for 35 minutes on Sunday morning but worth the wait."}
{"text":"We kept it simple: hotcakes, eggs, and sausage. Everything was cooked properly and was tasty in its simplicity. I'm not a big pancake fan, but these hotcakes were really good. The edges had a caramelized crisp, and the rest of the cake was thin and not overly cakey. It was a really good breakfast."}
{"text":"The dishes taste good but there are so many customers. We waited for almost 45 minutes! But to be honest, it deserves."}
{"text":"Everything about this place rocks! Excellent food and good service. Definitely get the pancakes."}
{"text":"As far as diners go I'm not that impressed.
The pancakes are unique but nothing else is worth trying in my opinion. I gave this place a few tries and while I know it isn't supposed to blow my socks off, I would say that the prices are a bit high for what they're serving. 

The service there is nice and pretty fast. That's all I got."}
{"text":"This Pamela's has a much different environment than the one in Oakland. This had a much more intimate feel and was a lot smaller and less \"diner\" -esque. 

The morning after breakfast special was pretty good with 2 large hotcakes (important sidenote: if a pancake and a crepe had children I would imagine this is what their child would look like, the outside and edges are crispy but it's thick enough to be considered a pancake). The eggs were also of epic proportions but the bacon was quite scarce. A measly two and a half pieces...

The jumbo tossed salad was built for a king - it was brought out in the large mixing bowl that they tossed that sucker in. I asked for cheddar and dressing on the side and it was quite scrumptious."}
{"text":"OMG, I'm from Pittsburgh and just tried Pamela's while I was home visiting. I was skeptical at first because I'm not a fan of greasy diners and like my food to look good. I ordered the strawberry hot cakes, potatoes, and bacon. The hot cakes and potatoes were amazing. I felt like I was eating funnel cake for breakfast.  The bacon was too greasy, but it wasn't a big deal, I just won't get bacon next time."}
{"text":"Favorite place to get breakfast in Pittsburgh, and still the best pancakes! Be prepared to wait in line if you don't get there when it opens. If you do have to wait though it's well worth it. Also it's cash only, but there are several ATM's nearby. Overall I highly recommend and think that everyone visiting Pittsburgh needs to go here!"}
{"text":"Wicked good.  One of the best breakfasts I've had.  If the corned beef hash wasn't salty as hell (it WAS prepared scratch though) I'd give it five stars.

The crispy pancakes were wicked good."}
{"text":"Pamela's is THE PLACE to go if you love pancakes in the morning! Yes, it's cash only and yes, there will be a wait but it's SO worth it! I always get the chocolate chip banana hot cakes and I have never had hot cakes so thin and light but so indulgent at the same time. Order the whipped cream on the side-it's a a rush of sugary goodness otherwise. But that's not always a bad thing. Their coffee is good too. Service is usually slow and not the friendliest but this is one of those places where the wait is so long they want to get you in and out as quickly as possible. This is also a great place to take out of towners for breakfast-even the Obamas loved it!"}
{"text":"I was in town for a training and a group of 5 of us came here for breakfast. 
The decor is interesting with retro board games all over the walls from several different decades.

We each ordered our meals for the morning. And I was surprised at how quickly the order came out. I would have expected 10 minutes or so but our order was on the table within 5 minutes.

I ordered the famous hot cakes with a side of bacon.
I found the crepe style pancakes flavorful and prepared well. They are a large plate sized portion of pancakes. I had no problem finishing it and was clearly full. The thin nature of the pancakes take a little getting used to. The bacon was not crispy enough for me, but I had no problems with it either.

Server was friendly and speedy. She also handled dividing our checks up. 

I would recommend this location. There are plenty of food options and they are exceptional."}
{"text":"This unassuming greasy spoon located in the Strip District serves one of Pittsburgh's most popular breakfasts. Quaint as it is, P&G Pamela's Diner was bustling the Thursday morning I stopped in, filled with moms with toddlers, businessmen with suits, and seniors with newspapers.

Although the restaurant is nationally known for its pancakes, I didn't bring my sweet tooth to breakfast during my visit, and I instead ordered the \"Pittsburgh Hash,\" which featured crumbled kielbasa sausage, sauerkraut, Lyonnaise potatoes, onions, and melted Swiss cheese, with 2 eggs over easy and a side of toasted white bread smothered in half-melted butter. My setting was rounded out with a small OJ and coffee, the total damage coming to $14.82, cash-only. (Luckily I was carrying cash.)

Yes, the dish was a bit heavy, but I was delighted with the wee bit of tang and sweetness imparted by the sauerkraut, an essential component that brought the various ingredients of this hash together in a way that made it truly taste like Pittsburgh. That said, Pamela's Diner could adjust the portion size of this dish: even though I arrived with an empty stomach, I finished about half of the hash, half of my eggs, and half of my toast and was totally stuffed. I couldn't do any more despite that I felt this was one of my better-tasting breakfasts this year.

Overall, I highly recommend this restaurant for breakfast -- though it loses a Yelp star from me for its stubborn cash-only ways.

Food/Décor/Service: 4.0/3.2/3.6"}
{"text":"OMG OMG OMG. This place is not a game for breakfast.

I was in the 'burgh for a theatre gig at the CLO. As always, once I open a show, I have cravings for breakfast around noon. We heard amazing things about Pamela's so here I went.

The place is in the heart of the adorable Strip District; a part of Pittsburgh you have to visit when you go. You enter into a retro-40's/50's ambiance and the atmosphere is for people who dont need to be needy for a good hearty meal. Even if the sign says \"please wait to be seated,\" the waiters know that you want to sit where you pick. 

My colleague and I sat down at a clean table, ordered from an AMAZING looking menue and seriously recieved our freshly cooked meals within 5 minutes. I'm really not kidding. It was hot and fresh and fast!

And the crepe pancakes.. oh. That crepe pancake; Breakfast Coma Heaven. My colleague's healthier choice of an egg white omelet w/spinach and onions and raisin bran toast was as even satisfying as it looked.

If you're looking for a FOR-REAL breakfast and not wanting to be bothered with an unnecessary, over the top, snooty brunch feeling, go have a FOR-REAL-GOOD time at Pamela's P&G Diner. 

Service was friendly and they were definitely busy, but NEVER rude. I liked everyone in there. And the prices were amazingly cheap for the amount of happiness placed on your plate.

Delish."}
{"text":"Great place to eat breakfast/brunch in the strip. Get there early or be prepared to wait awhile. The potatoes are delicious and you get plenty of food at a decent price"}
{"text":"Pamela's gives off a pure diner vibe, and the experience matches expectations. Reasonably priced, with a good selection of eggs, French toast and hotcakes for breakfast. Our server came promptly, and was cordial, efficient, and accurate. What more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"A hotcake is basically a pancake with slightly crispy edges.  Between the three of us, we tried the strawberry hotcake, the banana walnut hotcake, and a plain hotcake.  They were decent but not fantastic -a tad too much of that fried feeling.  Of the three, the strawberry was the best because the tartness of the strawberry and sweetness of the brown sugar blended well.  The banana hotcake and the plain one were sort of bland (pancake syrup did the trick, though).

The \"morning after\" breakfast special is a hotcake with eggs and meat (bacon, sausage, or ham) for $6.95 (+$2 to upgrade to the strawberry or banana one).  I asked for my eggs over medium and they were definitely over easy.  Again, the food was still decent - but I could tell that Pamela's was not famous for their sausage and eggs.

I guess Cleveland wins over Pittsburgh in brunch."}
{"text":"Another Pittsburgh staple, the Pamela's in Oakland is one of my favorites. They are really known for their breakfast and hotcakes, which come with strawberry, banana, chocolate and other varieties. The portions are satisfying and you really can't go wrong with anything on the breakfast menu. I got the 'famous' corn beef hash, and it was particularly delicious, with crispy not soggy beef mixed with their famous potatoes."}
{"text":"Great for a cheap meal... because the service is so bad, you'll never have to tip!  Food is good, diner is a bit dated (read: dingy), but I've never had such HORRIBLE service.  Waitress took our order and never came back, then gave me attitude when I went to find her and ask for drink refills.  Even with good food... why go back?"}
{"text":"Everything I wanted to say has already been covered in previous reviews, so I'll just leave it at this:

OH MY GOD GET THE HOTCAKES

Seriously, get them."}
{"text":"I visited P&G Pamela's Diner for brunch on Sunday afternoon. The line was out the door however the line moved very fast. The wait for 2 people was only about 25/30 mins despite the crazy line.

Also this restaurant is CASH ONLY.

I didn't see the cash only sign above the register until I got inside the restaurant so I had to run to PNC bank at the end of the block. 

So I ordered the Mushroom and Cheese (I chose swiss) Omelet ($8.50) which came with toast and my choice of a side was Lyonnaise Potatoes. My meal okay. Typical diner quality. In my opinion it just lacked flavor and seasoning.

My boyfriend ordered the Chorizo Hash (~$9) with eggs and Tortillas. He enjoyed his meal and said it was flavorful.

Overall typical diner quality food, so if that's what you're into you will probably like P&G Diner more than I did."}
{"text":"Super cool breakfast joint, the pancakes are off the wall, crispy edged thin pancakes.  I deviated from the norm and tried the corned beef hash, it's on par with Denny's save the carbs for the pancakes or waffles!!"}
{"text":"Always delicious, always a classic. 

Pros: food is delicious, decently sized portions, fun areas to sit in, trivial pursuit cards at the table. No problems getting seated on weekdays, casual ambience, room for lots of people. My group once was a little inconsiderate-we had 10-15 people that kept getting bigger once we were seated, but the manager really helped us out, reminding us to reserve for more people if we needed to. I completely understand! If you're going to have a big group, call ahead and make a reservation. 

Cons: CASH ONLY. Crowded on weekend mornings (until 1 or 2), during/after finals week, parents weekends and days of sports events (all usually on weekends)."}
{"text":"I get something different every time, but my wife always gets the same thing: Blueberry Crepe Pancakes. Fresh Blueberries with sour cream in a thin crispy-edged chewy pancake. I always get the last few bites as she can't finish them, and man, they are gooood! Everything else there is pretty good too. Get there at five minutes before eight and avoid the line that starts forming at about 8:15 on the weekends."}
{"text":"This breakfast place is amazing! One of the best breakfast places I have visited out of town and I'll be missing this place. Best hotcakes ever! The French toast is amazing too."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious pancakes. I can't wait to return to Pittsburgh for these pancakes. The word on the street is, Obama loves Pamela's too. But how could anyone not?"}
{"text":"I mean, it's sort of beating a dead horse at this point to talk about how amazing Pamela's is, but I cannot help myself. Breakfast has long been my favorite meal of the day--I can't live without it and I'm cranky when I don't eat something more substantial than cereal or a muffin. That being said, I demand a lot from my breakfast restaurants, and I'd be willing to say that Pamela's is my current favorite for BEST BREAKFAST EVER! Strong statement, but a very strong contender. 

I went here with a group of 3 at 9:30am on a weekday, so it was easy to get seated and the staff was efficient. We immediately asked our waiter for recommendations so that we could all share the best stuff on the menu, and he was dead-on with all of the items. We got:

Strawberry Crepe Hotcakes--hands down the best pancakes I've ever had.

Tex Mex Omelet with Chorizo--delicious!

Egg White with a side of Ham and Lyonnaise potatoes--perfectly cooked eggs, amazing homemade ham, and the Lyonnaise potatoes were exactly what breakfast potatoes should be: well-seasoned, a balance of moist and crunchy, and not just an afterthought.

I wish that Pittsburgh was not so far away so I could enjoy Pamela's more often, but rest assured I'll be stopping by any time I'm back!"}
{"text":"This seems like a Pittsburgh institution. We were visitng from San Francisco and the concierge at our hotel recommended it. We all enjoyed our breakfasts and we will come again whenever we are back in this city."}
{"text":"Didn't even get to try the place. They are cash only and hold that fact close to the vest. We took an uber from downtown based on the yelp recomendations and nowhere was it stated they were cash only."}
{"text":"Iv'e been to better places. I always forget that they dont take a card so I have to remember to get cash out when I go there. I usually order their omelets. The veggies are always crunchy so I taste more of a raw onion than I do my omelet. The food comes out fast which is great until I tasted the food. I checked it out three or four times  to see if it might be different but the omelets were the same. Raw and crunchy. overall  nice atmosphere, nice service, but the food is blah"}
{"text":"A Pittsburgh classic for breakfast...remember to bring cash, and if it's your first time, make sure to order the strawberry hotcakes (or at least one of the stuffed hotcakes)."}
{"text":"Staff are always great and food doesn't disappoint, but this is straight diner food - so if you are looking for something fancy - then this isn't your place. Also, they only take cash - so come prepared."}
{"text":"Hands down this place was awesome.  The crape hotcakes are terrific - with fruit or without.  Even their syrup was good.  The potatoes were so tasty.  Because of my salt tooth I finished the potatoes over the hotcakes.  This place makes me sad that I don't live in Pittsburgh.  Our server was excellent and helpful.  I was ordering when turned out to be one of their specials, but slightly adjusted.  She saved me some money.  Not that it's expensive in the first place.
I'll be going back the next time I visit this city."}
{"text":"This place could be the worst diner I've ever been to, yet it was completely packed.  The coffee was horrible.  The pancakes were inedible. The eggs and bacon were definitely microwaved.  Also the place was uncomfortably hot.  I was recommended this place by a person I thought was my friend. Clearly they are no friend of mine.  Fuck this place.  Seriously fuck this place.  Worst. Breakfast. Ever."}
{"text":"I used to really, really, REALLY like Pamela's. 

The crepe-like pancakes are my favorites in Pittsburgh and nothing will ever change that. I like 'em plain, with none of that sugary nonsense rolled in the middle. The croissant french toast is also another amazing dish, but sort of lame because it comes with no sides. 

The majority of the rest of the food is horribly underseasoned. That corned beef hash was an absolute joke. It's legit just the regular potatoes with corned beef sprinkled in, not cooked to meld all the flavors or anything. 

As of late, coming to Pamela's is a hassle. The crowded seating, the rushed and inattentive service, and the cash only system all really bother me. If you're gonna visit, go for breakfast and don't get your hopes up about much else."}
{"text":"Yo! Fucking brown sugar and blueberries in my hotcakes? Legit!"}
{"text":"we had a great breakfast.  the strawberry hotcakes were awesome here. every bit of them was delicious!

we also had the tex mex omlette and the 2 eggs.  the tex mex was very tasy and the guac was good compared to some diner guac.  

the potatoes they make are also tasty.  get them over all the other breakfast sides."}
{"text":"HUGE portions, solid service, great prices, and the atmosphere was great, quick turn around. Loved seeing all the Steeler fans come out."}
{"text":"I highly recommend the strawberry hotcakes or the banana & chocolate chip ones!  And definitely get a side of the lyonnaise potatoes.  They're delicious :-)"}
{"text":"Fantastic for breakfast and brunch. Pamela's was recommended by the valet parking employee so we checked it out. Pamela's does an awesome job with both the savory and the sweeter breakfast choices. I recommend the crepe style pancakes highly and the omelette was the best anywhere. I was there yesterday, and I really want to go again today!"}
{"text":"A great place to enjoy a nice weekend breakfast, one of the high points of our quick overnight visit to Pittsburgh. The crepe-style pancakes were absolutely amazing - even if you're getting an omelet (mine was fantastic), split an order of pancakes with your friends!  Incredibly friendly and helpful servers as well, with a great 50s feel.  Put it on your list!"}
{"text":"Good hotcakes, eggs and omelettes were good and so is the potatoes and coffee. The side of bacon was less than small and the western omelette came with guacamole paste from a tube or something. I was looking for real guac from a place this popular. That being said it is a good breakfast place on the verge of great if they wanted to take it there. The hotcakes could be better and dont really compete, but this is a good place and you cant go wrong here. Corn beef hash is the real deal."}
{"text":"Strawberry crepes are light as air and delicious!
Be prepared to wait a while to be seated , but it's well worth the best breakfast in the Burgh!
 This location has absolutely sterile decor. We only went because the strip was so packed .

Go for the food , you'll be happy ."}
{"text":"Im giving this place 4 stars because of the hotcakes, real maple syrup, and awesome ambiance. The crepe hotcakes are the best hotcake or pancake i ever had. They certainly are using that to their advantage, as well as the hip and high energy diner style restaurant. The rest of the food is average. I went there two mornings in a row, and tried to get a wide variety of their offerings. The corned beef hash is too salty and fatty. The homefries are too buttery and soft, but taste good because of all the butter. The eggs are below average, but the prices are quite reasonable and the food comes out really fast. I would recommend it, but stick with the crepe hotcakes!!!! JAI BABA"}
{"text":"Had the Chorizo hash. Delicious. this place lives its reputation. Tip arrive befor 9am. after; bring snacks to wait in line. Its that popular."}
{"text":"On the last day of my visit, it was a decision between eating breakfast at the hotel ($$$) or walking 15mins to Pamela's, and I'm very glad about my decision to make the trek down to The Strip!

Firstly, these types of '50s style diners don't really exist in my city, so I appreciated the kitsch.  Old family photos really made the place feel homey.

We ordered:  Greek Salad ($7.50, huge, dressing on the side which was a plus!), Veg Omelet ($7.95, I got mine with 2 slices of toast & potatoes), & Chorizo Hash ($5.95, wanted to try it).  All the portions were HUGE, shareable between at least 2ppl!  I ate just a bit of the Hash and had to get it to-go because I was simply stuffed by eating half of the Veg Omelet.  

Although tasty, I found the Lyonnaise Potatoes a bit heavy on the salt as well as the Chorizo Hash (probably from the Chorizo/cheese).  Then again, I found a lot of the food in the city, especially potatoes, too salty, so maybe I'm just not used to it.  The coffee was ok, although I found all the coffees that I had in Pitts to be on the watery side.

Service was no muss, no fuss!  Would definitely visit again for that diner experience, healthy portions, & solid food."}
{"text":"I don't love Pamela's and almost never went there when I lived in the 'Burgh. But at least, in the summer, there wasn't a long, annoying wait for the mediocre omelets and greasy crepes at this particular location. I have not visited since the remodel, which sounds atrocious. 

I kind of like Pamela's potatoes, which are \"lyonnaise\" and taste like a decent hot German potato salad."}
{"text":"Holy holy shoot!! My sister had said the hotcakes were amazing but she didn't even get close. This might have been the best thing I put in my mouth. A mix between a pancake and crepe so light and fluffy and crunchy around the edges. Filled with strawberries (you can get banana walnuts chocolate and blueberries) and sour cream and brown sugar. It is completely worth finding one of its locations and waiting."}
{"text":"The latest Pamela's in town! Great, as I was out in these parts for a wedding and feared I wouldn't be able to visit one back in Squirrel Hill or Shadyside because of the time constraint. I need my hotcake fix!!

The insides of the place feels as retro as any other Pamela's, and the menu the same. However, the quality is still there. Their hotcakes, with the whipped cream and brown sugar, are still the best. The potatoes, or better, the corned beef hash, remained the most flavourful I've had in my life. Ever.

I think I will have to keep coming back to Pittsburgh, even if I don't need to visit anyone. Because Pamela's."}
{"text":"So many great reviews.  Friends who live or have lived in Pittsburgh rave about this place.  It was supposed to be THE PLACE for breakfast and brunch in this city.  I first visited this place on a short Pgh Apt hunting trip back in April 2013.  Went in, got excited, as the place was packed with people.  It had the classic diner feel.  It had to be good.  Sadly, it wasn't.  Not wanting to give up hope, I went back to Pamela's the next day, and went with the corned beef hash, since many yelpers had mentioned it.  Again, disappointed.  Having settled in Pgh for a few months now, I decided to give Pamela's a third chance recently.  *sigh.  I don't get how this place has such high yelp ratings.

Food = (6.5/10) = As mentioned above, my first visit I tried the western omelet.  It was just ok.  Not well seasoned, and the cheese was meh.   Quantity wise, you do get a huge amount of food for what you pay for.  Second trip was the corned beef hash trip.  Really don't understand what is so great about this dish.  My third trip I tried the tex-mex omelet.  Again, eggs under seasoned, and cheese was meh.  What bothered me the most was the \"guacamole.\"  It's more like avocado paste with mayonnaise consistency.  Like something you would squeeze out of a toothpaste tube. Texture was not appealing.  The friend who came with me on this third trip ordered the pancakes, which he thought were fine.

Ambiance = (7.5/10) = it's got the classic diner feel, with diner friendly waitresses/waiters.  

Service (8.0/10) = as mentioned above, the classic diner friendly environment.

Overall opinion = I wonder if those who give high ratings to this establishment, are the locals of Pgh, and college/grad students on a budget and naturally appreciate the large quantities of food for cheap prices.  This place is just ok for me.  I'm still searching for my go-to-brunch place in Pittsburgh.  I do recommend trying this place out and making your own judgement, especially if you've just moved to the area.  There is always a wait to get in on weekends, so they must be doing something right.  Place is cash only."}
{"text":"Me and wifey ate breakfast here yesterday morning. The place looked like a popular night club on a Friday night instead of a breakfast restaurant. The place was packed! On a Friday morning, we had to wait around 20 minutes for a table for two. Tells you something about the food. I had the morning after special and wife had a broccoli and cheese omelet. If you want breakfast look no further."}
{"text":"3rd time I've eaten here and can't wait to return. The best reason to visit Pittsburgh.   We had Blueberry,  Banana Walnut,  and Banana Chocolate Chip Hotcakes.  Each was excellent, but LOVE the Banana Chocolate Chip.  Service was efficient, but not rushed."}
{"text":"Fantastic diner! So happy I came here. Super fun, young vibe. You can tell everyone is excited for the breakfast to come. Staff is super friendly, dressed in Steelers gear. Service is fast and courteous, though had to wait to be seated. This place is popular, and for all the right reasons!!

The coffee is great. Food selection is amazing. There are omelettes and egg dishes, corned beef hash and chorizo patties. The hot cakes look incredible - strawberry, chocolate chip or banana nut for specialty options. 

I had the eggs with chorizo patties. They come with potatoes and toast. There is no option to switch out toast for hot cakes but you can get a separate short stack or order a single hot cake if you want something sweet with your meal. 

The chorizo patties were fantastic. Crispy exterior and spicy chorizo meat. The potatoes were creamy and delicious, great for mopping up the decadent egg yolk and chorizo. I had it with a side of tomatoes, to cut through the richness of the chorizo. But if you get toast, you can make yourself a chorizo and egg sandwich!"}
{"text":"I love this place. I always get the strawberry crepes. You usually have to wait outside till you get a table because this place is so popular but its never a really long wait maybe like 15 -20 mins at the most. Your food comes out pretty quickly I've never had slow service here. This is definitely a place to go if you have friends or family visiting since its kinda famous."}
{"text":"Once again, Pamela's is outstanding.  Coffee is strong and hot.  California French toast is so delicious and full of flavor.  The potatoes are simply Devine.  Could have eaten 2-3 side dishes of them! Highly recommend.  Place is busy, crowded and loud but worth it."}
{"text":"I live 800 miles away. 
I have eaten here three times now. 
The pancakes are delicious!!  The strawberry/banana fruit bowl is very good. But the coffee is watered down and not good- definitely need to fix this. 

The servers are very friendly! 

Some of their menu items are a little over-priced but we don't get to Pittsburgh very often- once every few months. 
The wait times can get frustrating, as there is no where to sit and wait. 
They do have a nice text message system to notify you that your table is ready so that helps some.
Make sure to bring cash ONLY! 
 It's quite irritating. This is 2015...accept cards."}
{"text":"Wait for table.  Long lines - this would not be a problem, but the food was eh.

Perhaps if I wanted carbs and meat - but I ordered a Vegetable Omelet  with sliced tomatoes and toast.   The toast was great (see -- carbs) - It was a poor vegable omelet.  For a Breakfast/Lunch place I would expect much better.   The filing was Mostly Diced Onions and what seemed to be canned mushrooms, Some diced tomatoes, some diced green pepper. 

I uploaded a picture.   I ordered hot tea - while they gave me a place for my tea bag - it was a plastic cup (ever heard of a saucer?).   Then I had to catch their attention for my refill, which was not easy.  

Yet the long line.... Hard to explain - perhaps if you want carbs and meat....  Perhaps there is nothing better for breakfast here."}
{"text":"My sweet, sweet Lord, Pamela's is Heaven on Earth. 

I brought out of towners, because I had heard it was a Pittsburgh legend. I'd heard bad things from a coworker years back, and it just put me off from ever going until this weekend. 

We waited a half hour for a party of six. They don't have a kids menu, so my daughter and I split a breakfast. They brought extra plates with no issue, service was fast and friendly, the decor is nice and the whole place has this laid back, comfort feel. The staff was all so nice it almost killed my appetite... But then those pancakes came. 

Don't get me wrong. The eggs were good. The sausage was good. The coffee, the potatoes, the bacon, it was all good, but these pancakes... It was a spiritual experience. Most of the time my pancakes are something that get nibbled on but they are so thick at other places you can never finish them. Pamela's pancakes have an amazing texture to them, they're thinner than normal pancakes but crisp on the edges, I mean damn. I only regret not ordering more pancakes. Or all of the pancakes. 

And considering they aren't really outside of the eat n Park /Dennys price range, I mean why do people even go there when Pamela's exists. No comparison. Just go to Pamela's already."}
{"text":"As every other review has said the pancakes are really good! You will need to run for like 3 days straight to burn the calories but it might be worth it. I have visited Pittsburgh twice in 2 years and we have gone to Pamela's both times. It's quick, homemade and worth a 30 min wait if you have one.

A definite must for your visit to Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"Good breakfast spot, quick seating and service. I would recommend the chorizo and eggs, and the banana chocolate pancakes.  The staff was friendly and the decor was neat, with old board games on the wall. Bring cash."}
{"text":"I love this place, that's all there is to it!

I get breakfast at Pamela's at least twice a week, same thing each time: the Tex-Mex omelet is fantastic and so are the potatoes. The price is just what you'd expect a diner to be, which fits my college budget just right. The staff are very attentive and I've never had wait longer than 10 minutes for my food. The coffee is good and the atmosphere is fine; they play a lot of classic rock and oldies, which much better than any of the new music being played at other restaurants around the Pitt campus. 

Lunch is good, too. Pamela's a good selection of salads and sandwiches. The chicken salad comes in a big bowl with fries, and it's very good. Now I'm not a pancake person, so I can't vouch for any of the hotcakes or crepes or whatnot, but all of the other breakfast and lunch food is good and homemade. In short, Pamela's is a good, family-owned restaurant that has excellent food and service for a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Treating your Pitt student to breakfast or brunch at Pamela's is a time honored tradition!  Your student will appreciate the huge servings of delicious comfort food, and you will appreciate the moderate prices (but remember, it is cash only). Definitely try the some of their famous crepe pancakes!  They are thin, crispy around the edges, and the size of a dinner plate. The strawberry stuffed ones are the best. 

This location is right in the midst of Pitt campus and so is always crowded with college students. However, don't be put off by the wait, service is fast and the tables turn over quickly. 

The ambiance is casual, colorful and fun, with old board game boxes and gameboards decorating the walls.  Recommend!"}
{"text":"Cash only!!   We had a delicious breakfast here yesterday.    On a Tuesday morning we easily found street parking (park and then pay at the kiosk).  The atmosphere is warm and inviting with loads of old photos on the walls.  The staff is also quite friendly and efficient.  The food is delicious and the portions large. The pancakes deserve a special shoutout - they're thin, crepe-like pancakes with crispy edges and a delicious flavor on their own.  Definitely make this a destination if you're in Pittsburgh!!"}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast place of any city I've ever been to. The pancakes are thin and tasty with crispy buttery edges and the potatoes are magical. Cash only so prepare accordingly."}
{"text":"Two words: grossly overrated. If I am going to wait an hour for breakfast/brunch, it needs to not only be good, but also unique. Unfortunately, Pamela's is neither of these things. Then again, the hour-long wait does provide you will ample time to find a ATM because they only take cash. If you want to wait in line for an hour for food that is both good and unique, try Coca Cafe."}
{"text":"This location is the diner staple of Oakland. Its extensive breakfast menu makes it a popular destination for many students (and their visitors); so much so, that there is usually a line out the door on weekends. Pamela's has limited hours, but if you can get there during off-peak hours, then you're in for a pleasant meal."}
{"text":"Food was great!! Busy busy busy but sooo worth the wait! If I'm ever in Pittsburgh again I will definitely stop by and have a cup of coffee and some pancakes again. Keep up the good work"}
{"text":"I love a place that serves breakfast all day.  This diner is cash only, but the food is great and portions are huge.  I had an omelet and my friend had pancakes and we were both very happy and very full!"}
{"text":"I have not written a review for Pamela's in the past mostly because it feels wrong saying anything negative, due to the fact that it's almost a Pittsburgh institution- It's like dissing the Steelers; You don't do it, even if they lose!- And I would really have never given it more than a couple stars. 

That being said, I realized something recently when the BF and I went for breakfast...I'm not such a fan of the lunch nosh, but I love it for breakfast. For me, breakfast should be a greasy spoon-ish type experience. I want eggs and sausage and potatoes, all cooked to greasy perfection on a griddle type apparatus, and Pamela's does it very well. I don't really like pancakes, but even I have to admit the chocolate chip crepes are pretty good. And don't get me started on their famous Lyonnaise potatoes...
 I had the sausage and cheese omelet and the BF had the chorizo hash and eggs. His was good with the slightly spicy chorizo and hash, topped with a dollop of sour cream, and my was great; oozing with cheese and stuffed with sausage. Add the toast and yummy potatoes and you get enough food for at least two for like $8 or $9 bucks! But I still scarfed my down all by myself. 

As far as the staff are concerned, I'm a bit biased (I have many friends who work there), so I will only say I have never heard of anyone having a problem there. And if you have, it was probably your fault. 

Overall, I would probably give it 3.5 stars if I could, but as Yelp has yet to let us designate half stars, I am going with 3 stars, giving 4 for breakfast and 2 for lunch."}
{"text":"Stopped by here for a late breakfast on a Friday. Place wasn't too crowded but before we go any further kids- this place is cash only! 
 
We had \"the morning after\" breakfast special which includes 2 eggs any style, pancakes and choice of bacon or sausage. We both got bacon and over easy eggs. The eggs were eggs, the bacon was kind of on the small side with only 3 salty strips (NJ people know that a diner breakfast plate has a tangled up mess of bacon, you can't even count the strips if you wanted to!) but the pancakes were great! Two cakes that were thin with crisp edges with a not too sweet buttery flavor. Perfect canvas for eggs, bacon, and syrup or sweeter add-ons like chocolate chips.

Coffee was decent, bright retro decorated atmosphere, no complaints on service."}
{"text":"ooooooohhh-bama had the right idea by ordering the pancakes.  they're unbelievable...  strawberries wrapped in thin rolls of buttery goodness swimming in cream.  eff yeah!  decadent and down-right delicious.  

my breakfast date raved about the corned beef hash, stating that it was quite possibly the best she's ever had (and she orders it every time we go out for breakfast).

if i'm going to put pamela's into the regular rotation, i going to have to seriously start running more."}
{"text":"Ok the crepe pancakes are the draw for me.  I just love them.  The Oakland location can be a crazy busy so consider the Shadyside location also.  The ability to use the Yelp wait list feature is key since wait times can be a crazy long.  Service is always good and always willing to make it right otherwise.  The omelettes are the #2 favorite on the menu.  Overall, a great place for breakfast or breakfast for lunch."}
{"text":"You just really can't go wrong with Pamelas. On weekends you'll see a line wrapped around the building, so I like to go during the week when it's less crowded. Their potatoes are THE BEST. The coffee isn't great, but great coffee & diners never really go hand in hand. It's hard for me to make one recommendation because I've loved everything they have. I've only come here for breakfast,  but I'm looking forward to exploring the lunch menu."}
{"text":"It's worth the wait, good classic yummy breakfast with great staff!"}
{"text":"The service is prompt and they keep you moving don't be turned away by the long lines at the door.  The prices are extremely fair too, coming from comparing this to brunch spots in Denver.  The portions are huge and just knocking off a star for how greasy/heavy it all was.  If that's the kind of food you're looking for, this is is!

The short/tall stacks are the flat laying hotcakes you'll see in pics, while the specialty are the rolled up ones you see.  

Came here the morning after Girasole while Bryan was TDY to Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Fun atmosphere. Great hostess and waitress. Highly recommend! We're from Buffalo, N.Y. and would definitely go back. Get the hash and strawberry crepe!"}
{"text":"Have been here twice, and the second time felt rather unappreciated as a customer. The food is alright, but I felt like the customer service was lacking. 

We were trying to go on a nice early breakfast date as a 2-person party and got seated next to another person at a 4-top table. We raised our concerns with the host, but she just walked off.

Sure, the place is busy, but did you have to seat us shoulder-to-shoulder with somebody on one side, and employees brushing past us with food on the other? We were practically in the kitchen area and kept getting bumped into or brushed up against, all while being shoulder to shoulder with another party (they bussed the table and put another 2-person party at our table after the first person left).

We made it clear to the server that we wanted to move to another table, but she seemed to shrug it off with stuff like \"oh, yeah, this is an old school diner, the tables are bolted down!\" I said \"well, I think that we are going to be leaving, if we don't get re-seated somewhere else.\" After it was clear that we were going to be sitting with strangers while being bumped into or brushed on by employees, we just got up and left to get breakfast somewhere else where we could have some space.

While we were on our way out, we were walking past about a dozen other 2-person parties who had their own 4-top tables that they weren't sharing with another party and not getting in the way of employees going back and forth from the kitchen.

I wish that either the host or server took our concerns more seriously, and moved us to another table. We would have stayed if it wasn't for the complete disregard for our preferences. I don't think that we were asking for too much, especially since many other 2-person parties were able to sit at their own tables, away from the kitchen area.

The previous time I was here, we did enjoy the food, but found the cash-only policy to be an inconvenience, as well as the general hustle and bustle going on all around us. It was fine though, and I'd rate my first visit a 4-star experience."}
{"text":"Blueberry hotcakes actually had fresh blueberries, and were really good. Went at 3p on Saturday and no wait."}
{"text":"Always great! Delicious meal!  Waitress was super nice.  We had family from out of town.  They too loved Pamela's!"}
{"text":"Was here for the G20 last week.
Maybe it's just a reflection on Pittsburgh (and other nonDC cities) that the service here was really good, and the people were extremely nice! Our waiter definitely answered more than his fair share of questions (what comes on the waffles? caramel you say!). No problem getting water and coffee refills (we needed both for sure). And of course they'll call a cab for you while you settle the bill because it's raining. :)

The eggs and bacon in my \"The Morning After\" special were your standard diner fare...but the HOTCAKES. OMG they were so good. I swear they are cooked in bacon grease or something, and the perimeter of them is edged in crispy goodness 2 inches in. And I only got the plain ones (come with butter, and you can add syrup). Other tablemates got strawberries (sugar added) and banana (sugar not added, so less sweet). 

Decor is 1950s nostalgic B&W photographs posted everywhere. Classic diner tables and chairs. 

Great way to end a trip to Pittsburgh. Doesn't hurt that FLOTUS, POTUS, and the Japanese prime minister ate here either."}
{"text":"The pancake I ate was insanely delicious. My eggs were cooked perfectly and my corned beef and hash was equally good. The service however was awful. Some of the worst I've ever had. We also had to wait an hour outside just to sit down."}
{"text":"I expected fantastic based off of the prior reviews... 

Ordered an omelet with toast and fruit bowl. The omelet had it's fillings only in the middle 1/3 of the omelet and was swimming in oil of some sort. The fruit was quite mushy and had obviously been cut a few days prior. The bread had barely seen any heat and was sopping in margarine.  

I'm not sure what the draw is about this place."}
{"text":"How do I even begin to describe my experience here? I've had such a positive one that I would even go as far to say that I'd come back to Pittsburgh just to go to Pamela's! 

First to note: the GPS will actually lead you a little past Pamela's to a parking lot, which is actually great because you'll need to find parking anyways. It was actually at that parking lot that the guy manning the front told us to order the potatoes at Pamela's, which we did and they were AMAZINGLY GOOD.

I'm getting a little ahead of myself. The wait was about an hour for 4, but since we were only 2 people, we were told to check back in 30 min. We took that time to visit the Strip District, which is really lovely (chocolate, candy, free samples of cheesecake...). We were seated about 40 min after we put our names down, which is actually pretty good considering how busy it was.

Friend and I both ordered hotcakes with a side of the potatoes. SERIOUSLY SO GOOD. I'm craving it already! Crispy and slightly caramelized at the edges with delicious fillings- seriously you can't go wrong with the hotcakes.

And the the potatoes are so good- I still don't quite grasp what umami is but THESE POTATOES make me think of that description- so delicious that even when you're full, you'll keep eating. \"I don't think I can eat anymore\" was said as we stuffed our faces with the potatoes!

Easily the best brunch we've had here in our weekend trip to Pittsburgh. Like I said, I'd come back just for Pamela's. Amazing stuff right there!"}
{"text":"Pamela's is certainly a Pittsburgh institution, and for good reason! Of the several locations in the city, the Shadyside spot is my favorite, probably because it was the first Pamela's I ever ate at.  I love breakfast food, but I'm never big on breakfast-only places because they tend to be too small and crowded, and hardly worth the wait.  But Pamela's food is as close to perfection as you'll ever get, so the long line and cramped space isn't even a factor.  Personally, I love their hotcakes, omelets, and hash browns, but everything on the menu is mouth-watering and inexpensive!"}
{"text":"I much prefer the Pamela's in the strip. I've only been here once, but the food was beyond salty. Even the potatoes that I love were super salty and oily. Maybe I just went on an off day, but I'll be going to the one in the strip only from now on."}
{"text":"This Pamela's I think is the best in the city. I love myself for going out for breakfast after a long weekend night and Pamela's is always there for me. Sometime's the potatoes and omelets can be a little salty. I also love the hot cakes. I wish it wasn't cash only because I never have cash on me, but there is an ATM close by."}
{"text":"Food was really good. Once the order was placed it came out fast. Only gets 3 stars because we had to wait over 20 mins for someone to wait on us. We kept trying to get someone's attention but staff would make eye contact and they look away. They were busy, but would have been nice to just acknowledge us."}
{"text":"The expectations before I first came here were sky high, and when I did try Pamela's, I was severely disappointed. The food is average diner food at best. 

The worst part are the hours. You can't call yourself a diner if you close at 4pm... Diners should be 24 hours! Call it Pamela's Restaurant or something; it's not a true diner."}
{"text":"HOT CAKES.  That's really all I have to say.  I was wondering what the fuss was about, and when I took my first bite, it all made sense.  As for the rest of the breakfast items, they're okay.  I ordered corned beef hash, and it seemed like the kind of corned beef that came from a can.  I could be wrong, but it just didn't have much flavor.  The only annoying thing about this place is the wait.  Get there early or be prepared to wait, outside, for a long while."}
{"text":"I'm told that P&G is a Pitt institution and this location happened to be close to my afternoon appointment so I headed in with my co-worker for lunch. 

First - CASH only. There's an ATM down the street and in the Rite Aid across the street. 

Second - I had no idea what \"Lyonnaise\" potatoes were but they seem to come with everything. I guess they're a bit like home fries but less crispy and better tasting. 

Third - love the board games theme. Who knew there was a Sweet Valley High board game? What poor kid got the \"Allowance\" game as a present? 

It wasn't super busy when we stopped so food came almost instantly (not kidding - it was seriously like 4 minutes). My omelette was well made and quite tasty and service is efficient and friendly. Prices are pretty cheap (everything under $10) so expect lots of students. 

Not a fan of the cheap-ass jelly they're serving up. Overall, tasty, affordable diner basics. CASH only."}
{"text":"Hands down the best \"hot cakes\" I've ever had. Hot cakes are a cross between crepes and pancakes and they are delicious! Fairly long wait here on a Sunday morning so come prepared to stand around for awhile. I also tried their famous potatoes (I forget the name but they have cream cheese in them) and they were amazing as well. Great place and I will be back!"}
{"text":"a decent place for breakfast. More along the lines of a greasy spoon ; but cleaner with better than typical service."}
{"text":"Ah Pamela's. It's reliable, good, and relatively inexpensive.  I come here on Wednesday mornings once a month to meet with a tech group, so I have no concept of what the weekend rush is like.  As we know by now, though, Hungry Angelica does not wait well, so I can't imagine it would be very pleasant!

I've had the Western Omelet, which is delicious and so plentiful I have to take half home, but I love the American French Toast.  It isn't creamy and thick like traditional French toast, it's like your mom would make it - white bread with a sweet egg batter that's got a good crust on it.  Best when eaten with butter and maple syrup because otherwise it's a little egg-y.  Comfort food in my book.

The coffee is great.  The servers all seem to be pregnant at the same time (not a knock against the place - heh - just an interesting fact) but they're quick with the refills and usually pretty attentive to when you're ready to order/done with your food.  The atmosphere is traditional 50's diner.  Can't ask for much more."}
{"text":"Food is not nearly as giod as it used to be, and too pricey. It was better before it chsnged hands, when Pamela actually owned it or worked there."}
{"text":"I was from out of town and some of my co-workers took me here.  It was OK but I've had better.  I had the Banana Walnut hotcakes with a side of turkey sausage.  The hotcakes came wrapped as crepes, something I've never seen before.  Plenty of fresh bananas and walnuts.   The coffee was fine.  They did mess up my co-worker's order by giving him the wrong egg order.  Service was decent.  My hotcakes were very thin crepes and not really pancakes.  This might be a Pittsburgh thing.  They seemed kind of greasy and not the typical pancakes I'm used to.  I'm used to many diners here in NJ and might be spoiled.  Overall, I was satisfied."}
{"text":"My previous experience with Pamela's left me slightly skeptical about the fan base in Pittsburgh. However, when I went there the second time, my opinion was immediately changed. I'm not sure if the reason was because I went to a different location but I'm definitely a fan. My breakfast of choice was the strawberry hotcakes and I hit the jackpot. My love for strawberries coupled with slightly sweetened hotcakes hit the spot on the rigidly cold day I went. My friends ordered the chorizo breakfast special and also loved it! If you have a hankering for awesome breakfast food, Pamela's on Walnut is definitely the place to go!"}
{"text":"Pamela's has delicious food. This location I feel is the best because of everything that is around it and within walking distance. The service is great too. There's Nothing like Pamela's pancakes!"}
{"text":"I'm honestly not sure what the fuss is about. I went here awhile back, but I remember the strawberry flapjack/pancake/crepe thing pretty well. The strawberries were not ripe, so they were a bit sour. I didn't finish my meal, but it made me sick very quickly. I ran to the bathroom before we could leave. 

Service was also underwhelming. We felt ignored. It was almost impossible to get a refill, and it wasn't even busy. 

For the amount we paid, I just don't think it was worth it. This place is overrated in my opinion, and I'll probably not visit back again. It gets 3-stars because while the food did make me sick, it tasted good and the portion was on par with what you would expect. 

It's better than iHop, at least."}
{"text":"I love Pamela's... this was certainly my go-to hangover brunch in my college days. The crepe-style pancakes are incredible especially when stuffed with fresh strawberries, brown sugar, and cream. A bacon, spinach, feta omelette is also a favorite!

While I do dislike the cash only and long lines to get a table... this place is a Pittsburgh staple and a Pittsburgh classic!"}
{"text":"A nice little diner that's great to visit. It's a big place so the wait is never overwhelming, although it tends to get busy during the weekend as the it's right along the strip. Love the food and coffee."}
{"text":"This was my second time visiting Pamela's and it was delicious. I ordered the corn beef hash and scrambled eggs with cheese. This was actually my first time ordering scrambled eggs with corn beef. It was a wonderful experience the American cheese, potato, corn beef, and egg mixed very well. 

My boyfriend got the strawberry pancakes and turkey patty sausage. My first time trying their pancakes and they were fabulous. I am not a fan of turkey anything but their sausage was very tasty. 

All in all I understand why this is a Pittsburgh staple."}
{"text":"I love Pamela's food. This location is the \"tourist trap\" located in the Strip District. Expect longer waits than the other locations, not that the wait isn't worth it, because it totally is! My favorite part of this spot is the aroma. The second someone opens the door you get a whiff of syrup, mixed in with all the other Strip District food smells. 

They have a nice mix of savory and sweet breakfast options. I'm a savory kind of breakfast person. I typically order the same thing at the P&G diner: Tex-Mex Omelet. But, this trip I decided to get really wild and order the Pam's Trash Hash, which was Lyonnaise potatoes mixed with sloppy joe, jalapenos, bacon, and topped with American cheese with a side of scrambled eggs. It was good! Probably switch back to my regular, next time.

I still prefer the Millvale location, but if you're looking for breakfast in the strip. This is one of the best options you'll find."}
{"text":"Typical diner atmosphere but food was very good! Service was great and speedy! It is cash only."}
{"text":"Always one of my favorite stops in Pittsburgh. The food is absolutely worth the wait."}
{"text":"A bit crowded, but amazing blueberry and strawberry pancakes. I fought to go here and waited about 20 mins for a table (weekend) but it was totally worth it."}
{"text":"Great resatuarant. We had I wait a little bit but the service when seated was excellent and the food came very quickly. Large portions and everyone loved their meal. Especially their \"special potatoes\". Definitely a stop when at the strip in Pittsburgh. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Must visit for breakfast or brunch- don't let the line scare you it moved pretty fast and the service & food is so worth the wait!
Their famous eggs with the potatoes and the corn beef hash and the crepes.. all delicious! 
Typically not a fan of heavy american style breakfast but this was perfect! Cant wait to be back!"}
{"text":"If you're in Pittsburgh and like to eat, it's a given that sooner or later you're going to end up in the Strip District. Several establishments there are already in the Roadfood pantheon and for good reason. However, ask any 'Burgher where to find the best breakfast in the city and they will invariably point you in the direction of a spot on the northeast side of the Strip with pink and teal decor and a consistently large crowd in front of it.

Its official name is P & G's Pamela's Diner, P being Pam Cohen and G being Gail Klingensmith, the owners, but everyone just calls it Pamela's. It's reminiscent of a kitschy fifties diner, with Formica tables and vinyl chairs and brightly colored plates. It is always packed and always loud, and you WILL wait for a table. But, it's fun to look at the retro ads and random family photographs and pictures of President Obama posing with the owners while you wait.

You will see pancakes, or as Pamela's calls them, hotcakes. These cakes are closer to crepes than traditional flapjacks. Thin with crisp lacy edges, they completely cover the plate. Get them with butter and syrup, or fresh fruit and whipped cream, or chocolate chips and bananas. Actually, they're not bad plain, either. To complete the carb overload, get a side of Lyonnaise potatoes, a mass of buttery spuds and caramelized onions.

Although I have nothing against the hotcakes and Lyonnaise, I happen to really like Pamela's egg dishes and hashes. Yes, that's kielbasa and sauerkraut mixed with the Lyonnaise and topped with Swiss cheese to form Pittsburgh Hash. The chorizo hash is good too, as is the Tex-Mex omelet. My favorite Pamela's meal, though, is pretty simple--a sausage and cheese omelet with some of the best fries I've ever had (fries with breakfast is a Northeast thing). The Lyonnaise gets the raves, but the fries keep me coming back. Service is efficient, and even though your check will be dropped off with your food, you'll never feel rushed.

Pamela's has five other locations in and around Pittsburgh, but if someone is talking about going there, they usually mean the Strip District. Note--no lunch food is served on Sundays, and like most Strip establishments, it's strictly cash."}
{"text":"Without considering that it's a Pittsburgh icon, Pamela's is such an asset to the city. 

It's a quality diner with the NYC pace. You pay about $7.95 a person for a very healthy portion that you won't be able to finish. The service is minimal, but efficient. It's the kind of place that you want to know your order before you sit down. 

I had the Pittsburgh Hash because it was the special on the window and it sounded like it could cure a hangover. It did. 

I've been to the Strip District Pamela's and the Squirrel Hill and they're both consistent and quality. 

Get there early and avoid the long line."}
{"text":"So apparently Obama loves the crepe hotcakes here. That's what the photo and news article on the wall of this joint tells me.

You guys, Obama has good taste. Holy crap, I love crepes and I love pancakes and they merged them together here into some sort of delicious hybrid that I am drooling about right now. They're fluffy but thin and so perfect. I had them with sausage, so I just slathered everything in an unhealthy amount of maple syrup and had the best breakfast.

They also have Lyonnaise potatoes that are just so creamy and good. I was trying to not eat them all but I was totally trying to eat them all.

It's cash only and it's really popular, so there might be a wait to get in. It's a vintage diner, but very large. It's also cheap, which is even more appealing given the size of the portions.

Great breakfast place, will 100% return for more crepe hotcakes the next time I'm in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Pamela's I have to go back, I ordered the Tex-Mex omelette and it was good, no concerns with flavoring, or the chorizo or the guacamole even. However it was a very thin teeny tiny omelette...

Maybe a half an inch thick with the filling and eggs included, So i knocked down a star for portion size only because it was an 8$ omelette. There was more food on my plate, but I wanted more omelette, less home fries you feel me?

The service is speedy, if they are busy it can feel a little rushed, but nice servers. 

The decor is impossibly bobby socks, and poodle skirts adorable I half expected Rizzo and Sandy to pop out of the ladies room at any moment. Overall this is a yummy spot definately worth checking out."}
{"text":"Fanboy alert!
If you asked me what I'd want to eat for breakfast every morning if my physique could handle it I'd say Pamela's crepe/pancakes, a side of bacon, 2 dippy eggs, and a pitcher of coffee.  Doesn't get much better than breakfast at Pamela's.  I'd recommend heading to the branch in Squirrel Hill as it's not as jam packed as the others.  And sure there are other offerings than their famous pancakes, but why?  Why would you even venture away from them?"}
{"text":"Onions in the hash browns, and a 10 inch peice of hair in my breakfast sandwich. I don't come to Pittsburgh much and don't plan on returning but if I do, I will never come here again."}
{"text":"Great hotcakes! Good sized portions, and very good service. The crowd of people and line out of the door testifies to the popularity of this restaurant. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Cash only! We had an excellent brunch here. I was very pleased with the crepe-like hotcakes (they're a necessary sampling if you've never had! a tad overbuttered but soooo good), the burger was solidly tasty, and the service was quite good considering the bustle. It's pretty basic, but it's really excellent quality. I would strongly recommend it for a quick stop-off bite. It's not fine dining, but if you want to lose the pretentious and just chow down, this is an A+ joint."}
{"text":"Made a special trip here...walked almost 20 blocks.  Yeah, it was worth it.  It's old school, both in looks and in menu.  The malted waffle with strawberries and a cup of good diner coffee will make you feel like all is right in the world.  Lampshades like grandma had in the living room.  Tables and chairs like the ones in her kitchen.  You'll feel comforted.  Even the 80s pop was soothing.  Apparently, the potatoes are legendary.  I don't doubt it for a second.  Go here."}
{"text":"Had to wait 30 minutes to get in but didn't mind at all since it's worth the wait. The strawberry pancakes were so good. They were unique and very delicious! Inside was clean and they served you quick. The only reason I'm not giving this 5 stars is because it's a cash only diner."}
{"text":"I'm from California and hotcakes is something that's not common in our food vocabulary. We just settle on pancakes and call it a day.

My brother took me and my mother to Pamela's for brunch and it was pretty packed. Fortunately, it was only a 10 minute wait and a huge crowd came in after us. I glanced through the menu and learned that they're known for their specialty hotcakes. They all looked very good, but settled on the the strawberry hotcakes (was craving strawberries). We finally got seated, ordered what we want, and chilled in the lively atmosphere of the diner. The food came out relatively fast and I was ecstatic for my hotcakes. They use FRESH strawberries instead of the syrupy strawberries in a can! The hotcakes were thin like a crepe and the crispy edges were the best part. A bit heavy on the butter, but that's how you get the crispiness. The sour cream surprisingly worked well with the strawberries, as it balanced out the sweetness from its tart element. As for the brown sugar, that was like the cherry on top. It was pure harmony.

Definitely check it out when you're in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"I've been here several times and have mixed feelings. While I think the food can be pretty good, it is overhyped. They are a little pricey for food that can either be pretty good or pretty underwhelming. It is always super crowded during weekends but I almost never go because it doesn't feel worth it to wait in line. If you need a brunch place to go to with family/friends, however, this is probably a good choice. 

I feel like one of my main issues is that my boyfriend got the fish sandwich special and it was literally just a giant piece of fried fish and two buns. No sauce, lettuce, anything on top of it. Literally a plain fish sandwich. I wish I took a picture of it! 

Basically, if you need a place to go to brunch this is one of the more convenient options, especially since it has multiple locations throughout the city. If you are looking for better food it is probably better to go somewhere else, especially because the Oakland one gets super busy on weekends. Also remember it is cash only but I know that the Oakland location accepts Panther Funds!"}
{"text":"I read a review about the guy complaining about cash. You shouldn't base your review on that one thing. I've been eating at Pamela's since before freshman year and it feels like home every time I go back. This place is quintessentially Pittsburgh and has the coolest decorations you'll see yet. The food is  good but definitely not great. The staff is friendly as well. One suggestion: get here early on the weekends it can get packed."}
{"text":"Definitely a must for any guest. I only sampled the strawberry stuffed crepes, which sound rather ordinary. Rest assured, they were anything but. The crepes are the same as their pancakes, which are light, lacy and crisp around the edges. Perfection by themselves....they come with several fillings and toppings but I decided to go with my wait person's recommendation. The strawberries were sliced paper thin, fresh, not at all syrupy, and there were two, huge, filled crepes on my plate-enough for two people. I asked for the sour cream on the side, and there was a dollop of freshly whipped cream (not instant, I know these things) in the middle of both crepes. Dusted over the top was a thin coat of granulated sugar (it may have been turbinado) and just a hint of course sea salt. The texture and taste was amazing! The menu was interesting with omelets, egg dishes, french toast, and the usual breakfast fare. All that I saw going by looked good, but my recommendation would be, if you go only once, skip all that and go right for a pancake/crepe creation. You will NOT be disappointed. Also, the order came out 1 minute after the wait person brought my coffee; like magic. This place is a jewel in the middle of Walnut Street!"}
{"text":"We were seated within 5 minutes of putting our name on the list. Neither one of us can eat a lot and there was no judgement when we asked to share a short stack. The food appeared within 3 minutes of our order in- Wow! Hot and perfect as always, light, crepe-like pancakes, crisp around the edges. The server was attentive and I think we've found our favorite Pamela's."}
{"text":"Come get your hot cakes!  Hurry, Hurry, Omaha, Omaha!! Hut!  Yes, it is Peyton Manning* and I am here to tell you that these Hot cakes are extraordinary.  The edges arrive crispy and the consistency of the batter combines enough sponginess and density to form what possibly could be the only hot cakes I'd recommend.  Not being a fan of pancakes, crepes, flapjacks or waffles, I was taken back at Pamela's hotcakes.  If I extract the best qualities of a crepe, flapjack and pancake..this would be the result.  

Of course, an honorable mention to the famous corned beef hash and eggs.  More a traditional dish, I prefer it served extra well done with grilled onions.  Spoon some on a long wheat toast slice, place a piece of egg with its runny yellow yolk, a dash of hot sauce and take a bite.  Now that's what I am talking about, see??!

Cash only and lines can be long on the weekends.  PNC bank ATM just 'round the corner.  What's your excuse?

--------------------------
*I am Ken L and not Peyton but you already knew that.  I am rooting for him to finish his career with a Super Bowl ring.  Go Broncos!"}
{"text":"On a recent trip to Pittsburgh, my buddy kept insisting that we stop by Pamela's. I was skeptical, especially when I saw that it was a chain, but in favor of preserving the friendship, I went along. 

And I'm glad that I did. Although there was a sizable wait on a Saturday afternoon, everything was delicious. I tried the corned beef hash and the regular hot cakes, and like most of the other reviews here, I was in awe at how delicious the pancakes are. 

I'm not telling you something you don't already know but if you're in Pittsburgh, even if only for a few hours, your time is best spent here."}
{"text":"Ever since a visit by Obama, this has really become THE tourist place to go for breakfast in Pittsburgh. It was already a long standing fixture, but definitely got pushed over the top by the executive visit a few years ago. As such, if you're not there before 9am on any given day, you could easily be standing in a line running down the street. Is it worth it? The place underneath all the tourist hype is a good old fashioned corner diner, with huge pancakes, black coffee and lots of fried meats. The place is very retro looking (original decor) which I like. Service was efficient, but definitely not friendly. If you can get there early enough, give it a try."}
{"text":"Note: Let me hear you screeeammm Pittsburgh *holds microphone out to crowd* ...CASH ONLY!!! Yeahhhh, motherfu...

A half-day at work resulted in a few extra hours of free time for Yelp Pittsburgh's most controversial reviewer. Having been to and enjoyed the Dickies out of the Mount Lebanon Pamela's, I felt that I was beyond due to dine at the Strip District location. 

As is typical of a Pamela's the decor is retro, effortlessly kitschy, and familial, pink and blue being the dominant color scheme. Pictures of unknown relatives embellish the interiors further. You feel as if you recognize them all, even though you don't. It's as if you're eating at a restaurant from an unaired episode of \"Leave It To Beaver\" that was directed by John Waters in another reality, and I don't know about you, but I find that fun. Now, onto da grub, bub...

Whenever I come to places such as Pamela's after 11AM, I'm always caught betwixt craving lunchtime or breakfast fare. In this case, as I often do, I split my longings between entree and dessert. 

The P&G Diner Burger had my number. A half-pound burger is topped 
with fried jalepenos, onion straws, lettuce, tomato, near-liquid, gorgeously melted cheddar, ketchup, and mayonnaise. A sesame seed roll (the menu says Kaiser for some reason) held the medium-rare patty and all other contents. A mild sting contrasted with crunch, cream, sharpness, and pure lusciousness, the fresh, plush bun absorbing the fabulous flavors well. 

The \"famous Lyonnaise potatoes\" were merely very good home fries browned brittle on the outside in butter and cut rustically, exposing their inner mashed spud fluff. 

Dessert was a powerded sugar-dusted Crispy Malted Waffle that I customized with chocolate chips. Like the aforementioned tubers, the waffle that that crusty exterior/soft interior my mouth admires, the chocolate bits bleeding black all over my plate. Hardly requiring syrup, the delectable Belgian disk was also a bit chewy a la sourdough bread as well as muffin-ish in texture. A scoop of ice cream and a ladle of hot fudge would have been welcome, if decadent and extraneous, additions. Nonetheless, as I keep saying, pancakes and waffles of the non-savory kind are a finish to me, not a main course, and this waffle was most certainly one killer confection. 

Luckily, I came by in the middle of a weekday, which meant that I was seated quickly. The gent that waited on me was superb at his vocation, his confidence, accuracy, and speed indicating that he'd been proudly waiting on hungry patrons for a good while. 

Pamela's pummels much of her competition with homey, well-prepared diner staples and friendly service that's designed to get customers fed and on their way, just like in the days of trenchcoats, fedoras, gentlemen, and dames. 

That's 2 sisters, and I believe 4 to go before I complete the Pamela's circuit. Millvale, Oakland, Squirrel Hill, and Shadyside: I got dates with all of yinz, and I'll bring bills. Don't you worry. I know how you girls are about charge cards."}
{"text":"First time back at Pamela's since I was in undergraduate at Pitt. I had the morning after breakfast special with scrambled eggs and cheddar cheese and potatoes. The hotcakes were really good and so were the scrambled eggs, but I wasn't really a fan of the potatoes. The breakfast special usually comes with a side of meat,  but I wanted a vegetarian option. I asked if I could substitute a side of fruit for the meat, but was told only potatoes could be used as a substitute. So I got the potatoes, but ended up not really liking them. overall the food and service were really good, but I wish it was a bit more vegetarian friendly."}
{"text":"This P&G's Pamela's Diner is located in an area commonly known as the Strip District. There's some street parking, and most importantly its CASH ONLY folks! Get there early on weekends, otherwise there's a line. It does move reasonably fast as they do a good job or turning tables.

Food: Their hash and hotcakes seem to be the two things that stand out the most. He had the Pittsburgh Hash - lyonnaise potatoes with chopped up kielbasa and sauerkraut topped with Swiss cheese. Delicious, especially with over easy eggs. I had the Morning After Special - basted eggs (do it!), sausage, and hotcakes. I upped the ante and got the specialty banana walnut hot cakes. Their hotcakes are thick and dense crepes. A wonderful crispy edge, and you can taste the butter it's cooked in. 

Service: Decent. Orders are taken quickly, with food and drinks coming out as fast, even when they were busy on a Saturday. You won't get a check, but they'll leave your order chit on the table, which you'll then take to the register where they'll tally up what you owe. 

Cost: One iced tea, a Pittsburgh Hash, a Morning After Special with the specialty hotcake added totaled about $24 after tax. Not bad! 

Overall: Give it a try. They have several locations around Pittsburgh. Again, CAS"}
{"text":"I'm a breakfast fiend so whenever i travel, i try to find the best places i can for breakfast. This place was super good. I ordered the veggie omelet with egg whites and my husband ordered the Tex mex. he said it was one of the best omelets he'd ever had and mine was pretty tasty. Their breakfast potatoes were delicious and he and i split an order of their chocolate chip banana pancakes which are made crepe style. They were amazing. I would definitely eat here again"}
{"text":"Don't be intimidated by the line at Pamela's, it goes quickly, especially for groups of 4 and less. Food is reasonably priced, big portions and down right awesome... especially the home fries and chocolate banana stuffed hot stacks.

Decor is that of a family 50's diner and the staff are upbeat and helpful.  

Reason for the 4 rating is due to the check out process. They give you the kitchen slip, which was barely legible for us and no where on the slip did it mention gratuity. You pay up front, not at your table and we had 3 couples, 3 kids so it was hard to slip checks because everything was lumped together, abbreviated and NO TOTAL. Was hard to see who owed what.  We also didn't know there was gratuity added so we ended up double tipping the server. Yes she was nice but she wasnt amazing. Our total bill was supposed to be $87 and we paid $112 before the extra tip we put down. So we had an unexpected $25 on the bill and put down an extra $25 for the tip we left. 

Overall the check out process was very confusing and my husband was the one who paid. He wanted me to note that the  register is right near the door and is the busiest location in the place. He said everything was rushed and there was too much madness going around to get an explanation or itemize list of what was on the check.  

The food as always was awesome but the end process left our entire group with a bad taste in their mouths. Every experience can be different but in ours this time we learned that this place is great if you are not splitting checks and not in a big group."}
{"text":"Pamela's is truly a Pittsburgh must visit. I've been hesitant in going because there's always a wait. The wait is, however, so worth it. I would wait in line for an hour for this place if I had to.

On a Sunday around 11am for 3 people, the wait was 25-30 minutes. It really wasn't bad at all!

I got The Morning After Breakfast Special because I like a bit of everything in one meal. The \"hot cakes\" are to die for! I've never had them like that before! For my choice of meat, I got the bacon (oh man it was delicious) while my friend got the sausage link which wasn't anything special. My husband got the Tex Mex Omelette which was soooo good!

I can't wait to come back here and wait in line again for this totally delicious meal. If you live in Pittsburgh or are just visiting, you can't miss this place!"}
{"text":"My wife and I ate lunch and had much fun.  The food is solid diner fare with the high price dishes in the $7 range.  Great value!  Friendly service. Food came quickly.  This is a solid no-frills diner.  Breakfast is served all day (always a good sign).

Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast spot. Fun, kitschy, delicious. The pancakes are some of the best I've had."}
{"text":"Awesome Pittsburgh diner - the pancakes (crepes) are amazing.  I can't get past them when I'm there, and always have the crepes either with the blueberry toppings or just plain with eggs on the side.  They are truly unique as far as pancakes go, and a must-have for anyone's first Pamela's experience.

I always take my out of town guests here for an early meal before walking around the Strip.  It can get pretty crowded on weekends, but don't be too scared.  I have put my name on the waitlist when there has been as many as 20-30 people standing outside, and it still only took about 30 minutes to get a table."}
{"text":"Honestly, for all the hype and 5 star reviews this place has I was very underwhelmed. The staff were friendly enough and the food comes out fast, but other than that I would not return. Maybe if I ordered the hot cakes I would feel differently, but their French toast was chewy and bland. The bacon was hard and not in a yummy crispy way, more of a hard and old way. I also don't think the prices are that great - 9.5$ for bacon and some fried bread. And this place is CASH ONLY, which they do not advertise clearly. I found out after eating and was forced to walk to the nearby ATM and incur a $3 convenience charge. Maybe if this place wasn't so hyped up I would've enjoyed it more. I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Had an amazing brunch here with my sister 2 weekends ago. I ordered the veggie omelette and it was absolutely incredible. The portion is just as big as brunch on a Sunday should be, and was served with 2 slices of buttered toast and great mashed home fries. The service was super speedy! We had our meal within about 2 minutes from ordering. Still we never felt rushed. All around fantastic meal."}
{"text":"So happy I looked at yelp when I checked in to the hotel in Shadyside.  Pamela's hotcakes deserve all accolades - they rank in the top 3 in my book.  I tried the banana walnut crepe pancakes - fresh bananas, walnuts, and whipped cream in a delicate tasty pancake - if you like banana bread - you will probably like this - maple syrup wasn't needed but I used some anyway - it is better than delicious.  The eggs and sausage were good too.  I came for a late lunch during the week and did not have to wait.  Service was efficient.  I enjoyed the ambience of the diner and Walnut street - so much fun to hang out here."}
{"text":"Nice place for breakfast, but it took forever to get service on our table.
In general Food was very tasty and quickly once ordered.
I recommend if you are not in hurry."}
{"text":"Always great food and service. I usually get an omelette, but the corn beef hash browns are delicious too. Great french fries. Just try to get here early, because hey get very popular and it can be a wait for a table."}
{"text":"A classic!! Fast, friendly service. Consistent, delicious eats. Lyonnaise potatoes have enough butter to make Paula Deen blush!!"}
{"text":"Outstanding breakfast! Had scrambled eggs and chorizo hash....yummy! The hash was nice with a bit of spice, eggs were fluffy and cooked to perfection. Just be aware that they only accept cash."}
{"text":"First meal ever in Pittsburgh, but so much richness, my goodness!  I loved the brownness of the spinach/feta omelette and flapjacks, not to mention the potatoes.  But, how much richness can a person take?   Thank goodness for the dry toast to absorb some of it.  Did not disappoint!"}
{"text":"Wife and I stopped here while in Pittsburgh.
Im not a big breakfast fan but can always go for a nice egg and bacon and potato sandwich on a roll.
We were in a bit of a hurry so we went in for take out.
Te service was excellent and staff were extremely friendly.
So nice to not be in New York as friendly in New York is not even close to what it is in Pittsburgh.
The food came out quickly and wife and I were off.
I thought the pricing w a bit high, Wife said probably got wrong bill???? my bad maybe.
The sandwich ws ok not anything special to talk about.
The service and staff i would give 5 stars, But the food was about a 2-3.
I was told it is better to eat there when you have more time and that the pancakes are totally amazing.
The next time I'm in Pittsburgh ill definitely give it another shot but we will eat there instead of take out"}
{"text":"Classic Pittsburgh staple for breakfast. 10/10 when you ask where is the best place to get breakfast in Pittsburgh, you're going to hear Pamela's. It's no surprise when you walk in and eat why this is the case. There are a number of Pamela's throughout the city, each with its own personality and vibe. But at the end of the day, one thing remains constant and that's the quality of the food.

I'm personally biased towards diners, and being to so many I've seen it all from down right disgusting to practically perfect. Pamela's is practically perfect when you think of a diner. Quick, delicious, no-frill American favorites. Two things that are a must every time you come are the Lyonnaise potatoes and the crepe-style hotcakes. Trust me, you will not be disappointed.

I wish that I could keep going on about how great it is here, but I think you should come and see for yourself. Happy dining!"}
{"text":"Loved this place. Best pancakes ever. Could use a little more A/C, as people sitting by window couldn't stand the heat."}
{"text":"The hot cakes alone get this place five stars. Beware the long waits of curious parents during the busy move-in/out weekends."}
{"text":"My wife and I have ate here 3 times and had 6 different items from the menu and they were all AWESOME!  Thank you for this slice of heaven.  good luck on sundays but weekdays you can zip in park in the back and have one of the best breakfasts in the country!"}
{"text":"Went with a friend who goes to Carnegie Mellon and raves about this place. 

I got Gail's favorite eggs - while I liked it, I didn't love it, probably because I'm a health nut and the menu isn't the healthiest. With that said, my meal was delicious, and my two friends inhaled their food. The hotcakes are their specialty, I believe, and they looked delicious!

This is a popping place and seems to be a must-do for visitors. Make sure to bring cash though!"}
{"text":"We went Sunday at 10 am and it was packed! There was only two of us and we waited maybe 20 minutes. They move people through quick! Food came out fast and we enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Pamela's is a fabulous place to grab breakfast...whether it's early in the morning or wake-me-up-at-the-crack-of-noon o'clock. (Usually for me, it's the latter, because I'm a lazy mofo.) 

I came here a few weeks ago when I was home in Pittsburgh for Thanksgiving with my lovely boyfriend, Sean. We called in advance to make sure the place wasn't swamped. Because believe you me, Pamela's has a tendency to get swamped despite turnover being fairly quick among restaurants of its kind. Luckily the woman on the phone said no wait for two, so we walked on over from my doctor's office on Aiken. Upon arrival, we could see that it had become noticeably more busy since our phone call about 10 minutes prior and I was worried there'd be a wait....well...there wasn't a wait at all! It was beauteous! 

Our waitress was super sweet and attentive. She immediately took our orders and the food came out in about 5-10mins of time later. Super quick! I had the special strawberry pancakes with sour cream and brown sugar...and don't forget the freshly chopped strawberries! Mmm. The only thing I don't like is their generic watery syrup but I guess you don't really want genuine maple syrup on something as sugary as the special strawberry pancakes. Would be too sugary, most likely! But having that option would be cool for those among us who are syrup junkies, lol. He ordered the \"American\" French toast since he prefers his F.T. as plain as can be...without all of the raisins and cinnamon and jam. I tried a bite of it and it was pretty good but nothing beats their hotcakes.

Despite going to almost every Pamela's location repeatedly in highschool, I totally forgot that they only accept cash--NO credit cards at all! I had to text my dad who was able to bring me a fist fulla' dollars to pay for our meal. My bad. It's kind of weird that they don't take CC's but I guess they want to keep their prices low as it probably costs them every time they swipe a card. You'd think I'd remember that by now, but I always forget. lol.

Anyway I took Sean here because he's never been to Pittsburgh and I wanted to give them \"the experience\" by taking him to. as Amy R. put it, a \"Pittsburgh staple.\" We had a great time and left with full--but not exploding--stomachs."}
{"text":"Pancakes = AMAZING! Everything else = meh.

I have never had pancakes like Pamela's before! They're super flat, crispy and just the right amount of salty. Man, I could eat a thousand of these in one sitting! However, the eggs and sausage were kind of the worst. They cut up their eggs into tiny little pieces!? Why!? This is not how anyone should serve an egg. It's confusing and difficult to eat. And their sausages were overcooked and weirdly chewy.

If you come here, order ONLY the pancakes. Everything else is a waste of time."}
{"text":"Their recipes are well guarded, the restaurant world famous, the chain ever expanding, and they even cooked for the President at The White House - clearly a visit to Pamela's was on the agenda for our trip to Pittsburgh.  Arriving on the strip around 8:00am and finding meter parking for a mere 50 cents we made our way from the car, hit the ATM (cash only at Pamela's) and entered the restaurant to find it just under 1/2 full.  Invited by a friendly young woman to seat ourselves we opted for a booth along the wall and sat for a moment absorbing the kitsch...vinyl furniture, plastic menus, stone walls, and random photographs of celebrities past and present.

Opening the menus and blatantly skipping all the boring eggs, bacon, and ham our waitress appeared to fill drink orders.  With only sweet n' low and sugar available for the coffee I opted to stick with water while my mom chose coffee and my sister selected tea.  Drinks delivered, including full pitchers of each to put the diner on refill duty, we placed our orders and browsed the lively restaurant while listening to the sounds of classic tunes overhead.  Founded in 1980 Pamela's certainly appeared older than its stated age, but it worked.

Waiting less than fifteen minutes our waitress checked in on us to be sure nothing else was needed and to let us know our food would be right out...after watching our neighbors receive their options I have to admit I was quite excited...and without fail the food arrived moments later, piping hot from the griddle.  With each of us selecting a different item and each plate large in portion and ample in flavor there was much sharing to be done.

Beginning first with my selection, perhaps Pamela's most famous option, I opted for the Strawberry Hotcakes.  Served in Pamela's famous crepe style the hotcakes themselves were divine.  Yeasty and soft yet caramelized and crisp around the circumference the pancakes themselves were stunning.  More impressive yet, ordered in the peak of strawberry season, the cakes were absolutely stuffed with super sweet fresh strawberries, brown sugar, and a zippy sour cream then topped with whipped cream.  Adding a touch of syrup (unfortunately not pure maple) the whole plate came alive - really, the dish made a fantastic breakfast but could have just as easily been served as dessert.

Following my lead and going with the signature hotcakes my mother received two enormous cakes absolutely crammed with hot bananas, bittersweet chocolate chips, and packed with whipped cream.  Nicely caramelized and crispy along the edges I sensed more of the yeasty and buttery nature of the batter in her batch and also perhaps the scent of nutmeg - I think it was in the batter, but perhaps it was the bananas - either way, it was excellent.

Figuring she would get plenty of opportunity to taste the pancakes my sister opted to try Pamela's French Toast - specifically the Croissant French Toast featuring two split house made croissants soaked in cinnamon-vanilla egg batter and topped with caramel sauce and nuts.  In order to understand how sweet this was you'd have to know my sister - the lady puts syrup on nearly anything that can be consumed for breakfast...and after her first bite she stated \"wow, this doesn't even need syrup!\"  With Buttery croissants nicely pan crisped, crunchy oven roasted almonds and walnuts, and decadent caramel syrup the best way to describe the dish would be a deconstructed cinnamon roll, but better.

Settling the modest bill and leaving an ample tip we left Pamela's very content and with blood sugar certainly well above fasting levels - the total duration of our meal was only 45 minutes but it actually felt much longer and not at all rushed.  Pleasant service, a nice setting, and a wonderful (albeit limited) menu I only wish Pamela's would offer some alternative sweeteners and a better brand of syrup...with those minor tweaks a great breakfast could have easily been in consideration for one of the best ever."}
{"text":"Some of the best breakfast you'll find.  The crepe pancakes are unique and good.  Everything comes in large-but-reasonable portions, and everything is reasonably priced.  The service is fast and friendly.  The line is understandably long at times.

The secret to the crepe pancakes, and the potatoes, is a *lot* of butter and/or oil.  They aren't really very healthy choices.  Pamela's only has mixed fruit jelly for some reason, as something tasty doesn't fit the budget?  

That said, you don't order fried potatoes and pancakes as health foods, and one can forgive them the mixed fruit.  5 stars, because you're not going to find a better breakfast-only place."}
{"text":"Yes, it's all that you hear! Photos from the past, diner chairs, pink décor, nice staff, great coffee, and breakfast needs a paragraph worth of description.

Definitely visit the Strip District location. Kind of a wait, but could be and cell phones work nowadays.

Coffee...good
Corned beef hash... good
Strawberry hotcakes...good
Eggs... good

Go now!!"}
{"text":"Stopped by here while visiting Pittsburgh after searching for great breakfast places on Yelp.   We had never been to the Strip, so we thought we'd check it out and we are PSYCHED that we did! 

Like everyone said, you sign in but be warned.  The line goes very fast (there's a large section of seating not visible from the door) and if the entire party is not there, they will NOT seat you even though we were outside just one store down. 

It's crowded, a bit noisy and fun!  Our waitress was friendly and efficient.  The decor is 50s dinerish. 

Now the food.... The definition of comfort food!  My hubby went with the Pittsburgh Hash (house special lyonnaisse potatoes with Polish sausage and sauerkraut with 2 eggs and toaat) ... The portion was big enough to feed a Steelers linebacker and so good. My daughter had the banana chocolate chip hotcakes.... So delicious!

Great experience for breakfast... Definitely check it out"}
{"text":"Delicious as always.  What more can really be said?  I always get the crepe pancakes with brown sugar and sour cream.  I remember when you could only get them with strawberries, but blueberries are now an excellent alternative.

Their coffee is as spectacularly terrible as ever.  It's been bad for as long as I can remember, like they're intentionally not serving good coffee.  It's the only thing from keeping Pamela's from being a 5-star breakfast place.  Regardless, Pamela's is still a Pittsburgh classic and always a great breakfast destination."}
{"text":"Yes, the line runs out the door but you better believe it is worth the wait.  We had a table of three and we waited no longer than 10 minutes.  The chocolate chip banana pancakes are heavenly!! Everything comes out quick, fast and in a hurry which is imperative when you get into this place and your mouth starts drooling over your neighbors' meals.  The coffee is just so-so but honestly who cares in this case.  Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"Staff is awesome.  Refills of water and coffee come without asking.  Patient with customers but fast at service and food prep.

Decor is entertaining.  Game Room has all the game boxes and game boards posted on the walls.  (Chutes and Ladders, Monopoly, and some I never heard of -Careers).

Food was very filling!  Our group had a variety of orders.  Crepes were really good.  Next time going to try them stuffed.  

Place is always busy.  Usually have to wait.  Can use the No Wait app to make reservation.  Otherwise they only accept reservations for 6 or more people.

They only accept cash-no credit or debit cards.

You have to try it at least once when visiting U of Pitt."}
{"text":"Mmmm. Crepe pancakes. What an idea. 4.25 stars (sure, I can give quarter stars, why not).

Per the bf's suggestion, we went to Pamela's for brunch, on our first stop of our day trip in Pittsburgh. Hmmm..... a brunch place, you say? Why not! Cool decor inside- half hipster, half well....midwest diner. Our wait wasn't really that long- we put in our name at around 11:30am on the Saturday of Labor Day weekend, and was seated within 30 minutes. In the meantime while we waited, we checked out the cool Mexican place above Pamela's. Cool.

He got the standard breakfast special - which was standard, there's no way to really rate that stuff- and choc chip banana hotcakes. I ordered the blueberry hotcakes.

His choc chip banana hotcakes were so so good. Bananas stuffed into a thin crepe of a pancake with the chocolate all melting inside.....omg, it was good. My blueberry crepe pancakes seemed to be extra crispy (which I liked, by the way) with brown sugar and sour cream in it. I felt like there needed to be more stuffing in it, but it was still pretty good.

Coffee was standard here as well. But I LOVEEEeeee diners, so this was a place that was above your normal diner. Cool. I still crave those crepe hotcakes...."}
{"text":"Awesome spot to grab breakfast. However, they're always busy so be prepared to wait. Their pancakes are unique and definitely a must try, as well as the Lyonaisse potatoes."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to eat breakfast, there hotcakes are the best.  I always get the hotcakes with bananas and walnuts and whipped cream!  The atmosphere is the best it has 1950's memoribila everywhere.  With alot of pink and green.  There are old pictures all over the walls.  Service is very good and fast even when there busy.  On a typical saturday or sunday morning theres usually a wait,  they have outside seating available on nice days.  Some times you don't have to wait at all if you want to sit outside and they have a table available, as long as no one before you wants it.   They only take Cash"}
{"text":"Have been going to Pamela's forever. Always a reliable go-to for breakfast. Service is polite and expedient without being rushed. Never disappointed. 

While no one every went here because of the decor the recent remodeling is ATROCIOUS absolutely AWFUL. Positively UNAPPEALING. Professional help is available. Seek it."}
{"text":"Always get the morning after special since I always want some hotcakes and eggs. The hotcakes are good but nothing special. A place I usually go only if the people I with want too. Not a place I generally suggest. Food is average. After the first time, it loses its charm. I've never had a bad meal here just nothing extraordinary."}
{"text":"Blueberry hot cakes and lyonnaise potatoes give me life. This is a classic spot that everyone needs to check out! Prepare yourself to wait on the weekends...but it's worth every second."}
{"text":"Delicious brunch, quick service and interesting retro board game decorations."}
{"text":"Love the crepes! And the potatoes!!!  Mmmmmmmmm.......
Usually a wait especially when there's event at Pitt!  Worth the wait though!"}
{"text":"I went to Pamela following my friends. Her strong recommendation turned out to be good for all of us. The atmosphere was cool and staff was kind even though we had a lot of questions and took long time to choose our menu. 

Crispy crepes with sour cream, strawberry and banana were so delicious that we can't have time to chat. Mashed potato and omelette stuffed with meat and vegetables were good, too. 

One thing I want to tell you is that there is no need to have additional potato when you order a set menu. We had double potatoes (side dish of a set menu and an independent order) so we left a little."}
{"text":"I know, I know.  Everyone in Pittsburgh is all into Pamela's breakfast.  But I just don't get it.  I don't like my pancakes crepe thin and extra greasy.  And I really don't like the crispy, crunchy edges.  That's pretty nasty to me.  And the lyonnaise potatoes, while good, are just potatoes.  My friend had an omelet that looked pretty good.  And I'll admit, I stole half a slice of his toast.  I'll probably go back, because it's a good location and the service and decor were both good.  But I'm not going to lose any sleep waiting to go back or craving this stuff....."}
{"text":"Cheap breakfast diner. Ambience inside is a bit cheesy and the food is not gourmet by any means, but I'd say that this is a quintessential Pittsburgh diner. I had the strawberry hot cakes (reminiscent of a crepe). I like the cake part better at Pamela's than a regular crepe. I don't know what goes in the batter, but it tastes excellent. I asked for it without whipped cream, because it's pretty sweet."}
{"text":"i think i'm in love. i had heard about pamela's before and that it's the best place for brunch, but i hadn't had a chance to go until yesterday.
i get inside and was not exactly blown away... small diner-style, cash only restaurant. but ok, at least it will probably be cheap right?
the menu looks pretty promising... interesting choices, breakfast and lunch, not a huge menu but not bad. i decide to go with the feta and spinach omelet (with the potatoes), and my friend that went with me went with the crepe hotcakes.
the food comes and i begin to dig in. bam. the magic occurs. the omelet was tasty and the potatoes were even tastier! i had a bite of my friend's hotcakes and was blown away.
moral of the story, don't judge a book by it's cover. the food entirely speaks for itself and makes this place a 5 star worthy breakfast joint."}
{"text":"I always love love love the food here,  but seriously dislike the coffee,  and I'm usually pretty easy going with coffee."}
{"text":"When I first moved to Shadyside this was my weekend go to spot.  The pancake/crepes are the size of flying saucers and the hash browns are top notch (starchy crunchy goodness).  The lines are long but move fast.  

That being said, I find it highly over rated and have since seen the light with regards to other brunch contenders in the area."}
{"text":"My favorite downtown diner, right in the heart of the Strip. The pancakes are so crepey, buttery and fabulous. Get a French Press for coffee and enjoy! Cash only and be prepared to wait, but not as long as \"the other Strip breakfast place\"."}
{"text":"Parking was expensive, the waiter forgot the drink orders, and it was so noisy that we couldn't hear the oldies track that they were playing.  The crepes and waffles were good, but the omelets were fair.  (Who doesn't make omelets today, and who can't make better ones than Pamela's?).  Nothing against Pamela's, because it is the only real diner in the strip and the food wasn't bad,, but the next time I'm there I want to check out the sidewalk restaurants."}
{"text":"Such a cool place!! It's a full on old time-y diner with delicious food and a really cool environment. I got Gail's favorite eggs and it was amaze!! I ordered a side and didn't even need it. The service was great and I was really impressed."}
{"text":"Not sure what to order? Hotcakes! Pamelas hotcakes are out of this world. They are buttery, thin, and the best part is they are crispy around the edges. I have ordered a few other things on the menu, but I keep going back to the hotcakes. Other Pamela's notes: other locations are less busy than The Strip one, weekdays are substantially less busy, cash only, Lyonnaise potatoes are worth a try. Yum."}
{"text":"Cash only, so come prepared. Great classic diner ambiance. Terrific breakfast in the strip."}
{"text":"If you Love Butter this is the place for you, it is yummy & delicious quick friendly service & the potatoes are tasty!
No credit cards this place is cash only"}
{"text":"Visiting Pittsburgh for the first time, Yelp pointed us in the right direction towards Pamela's for breakfast.

It passed the \"parking lot\" or rather waiting room test and was packed to the the brim on Saturday at 11am... Perfect, this means we are at the right place for a good breakfast. Only a short wait later we were seated comfortably at a table.

Great signage to say that they were a \"CASH ONLY\" establishment. Thanks for not making it awkward at the end....

Overall the food was excellent. I had a Hotcake with Walnuts and Bananas... I wished it came with some sort of side because I was still hungry afwards.  My friend had a omelet with home fries which she said was delicious as well.

It wasn't life changing and innovative, but the food was excellent for a brunch location in Pittsburgh. Loved Walnut street as well. Beautiful location for a breakfast spot.

Parking wasn't so bad either! 

See you next time Pamela's!"}
{"text":"Great service, the most authentic corned beef and hash. The lyoneese potatoes are fantastic!"}
{"text":"I live a few blocks from Pamela's and each time that I walk by on the weekends there seems to be quite a few people waiting (and others have raved) so had been wanting to try it for a while. After waiting 30-45  minutes on a Saturday morning for brunch, I wasn't that impressed. It is cheap, the service is fast and they serve ample buttery portions of diner food. If you're not hungover, I hope you have a good reason for going. You might as well just eat some grease and rub it all over your face."}
{"text":"We enjoyed a delicious breakfast at Pamela's. Their crepe-like hot cakes were wonderful! We also enjoyed a side of their home fries--do not pass those up! Be sure to try Pamela's when you're in the Pittsburgh area."}
{"text":"There's a funny comic about the recipe for making your restaurant over the hill popular in a city. 1. Find a hole in the wall location with no parking available 2. Cash only 3. Have 1 or 2 unconventional ingredients paired with some fun menu item names. This is definitely true for Pamela's Diner in the Strip District location.

It was 9:45am on a Sunday. I was not there by choice but out of necessity. While waiting for my kitty to finish getting her surgery, I needed a warm place to grab breakfast nearby. The cramped diner was completely full with a 3-page waiting list. Had I not seen the line DeLuca's already had at this time, I would've hightailed it out of there and gotten a no-fuss pho meal. But at least Pamela's had indoor waiting. At about 10:15am, we were seated at a wobbly table. Every piece of furniture had a slight layer of grease and was tiny. 

I will say this--the service was very speedy and the food tasted great. I got the croissant French toast and sausage on the side. The toast was caramely and wonderful but kind of expensive for just bread. I was hardly full so had to order 3 measly sausages after that. Those turned out to be wrinkled and dry. Hubby ordered the Pittsburgh hash which was delicious and much more filling than mine. 

Will I come back? Heavens no, there are too many choices to be made over this place. It's just greasy diner food, after all. Yummy? Yes, but hardly enough to stand waiting and count out cash for..."}
{"text":"The Shadyside location is a smidgen less crowded than the Strip District location on the weekend. We waited inside the building for about 15 min and got seated. Look carefully because it's housed in the most inconspicuous building ever! Upstairs is this Peruvian restaurant called Feria that I would like to visit next time we're here. 

The hotcakes translate to: the best pancakes I've ever had. I don't even like plain pancakes all that much but these are crepe-style with thin, crispy edges and a mound of butter. Mmm...goes perfectly with whipped cream and syrup. Their speciality potatoes are really good! They're made with sour cream, I believe, to give 'em that delicate softness. 
Their eggs are unseasoned and small though, and it's pretty hard to mess up eggs. Every table comes equipped with hot sauce and syrup so that's a plus. The sausages are a bit dry too so definitely not their strength. Our waitress was very friendly and all the customers were really friendly too. I guess greasy breakfast food just puts everyone in a good mood?

It's cash-only and you don't get a real reciept. I would say the prices are on the higher side for the basic-ness. Portions are reasonable though. Yes, I would come back or at least try another location as well."}
{"text":"I work in Oakland and my co-workers and I frequently go to Pamela's to celebrate birthdays. There is no better place for a medium-sized group's b-day breakfast than Pamela's! The staff are friendly and never give us an guff for separate checks. The atmosphere i.e. the board games and trivia questions on the table, are great ice breakers/discussion points when we're done bitching about work. The food is always satisfying. I love that one of the side options is tomato slices, a healthy alternative to hash browns. And the prices are great as well, so it's never an issue for our group to have to wait until the next paycheck before we can go. I'm also a big fan of the the crepe hotcakes, which I haven't had in a while, but am glad to know they are there, just in case I decide to throw caution to the wind and have carbs at one of these gatherings."}
{"text":"On this visit to Pamela's I got the corned beef hash and have been dreaming about it ever since! For some reason my 2-year old after begging for french toast was totally disinterested when it arrived, but she's crazy. I had some of her french toast, and yes it was dripped in butter, but damn, thank you mam, so good. 

I love Pamela's and the Strip is my favorite location. Not the best for little, little kids, but it's very family-friendly. If you go on a Sunday in fall, best to double check the Steelers schedule, home games will make the strip a nightmare."}
{"text":"Excellent service, great food, nice portions, and a welcoming atmosphere! Would visit again!!"}
{"text":"Good comfort food served in a retro diner with photos of people you don't know on the walls. I had a burger (average) with onion rings (fantastic). My wife had French toast - three huge slices with thick mouthwatering bacon aside. They close at 3 pm so get here early."}
{"text":"The food here is outstanding. I live in California, and whenever I find myself in the 'Burgh, there is always a trip to Pamela's on the agenda. 

The crepe pancakes are magical. There's a reason why Obama invited them to the White House after eating here. I've never had anything like them anywhere else. So light and buttery, and crispy on the edges. The famous potatoes are full of flavor, not like the plate-filler, bland potatoes you might find elsewhere. So savory.

Just delicious!"}
{"text":"I got the western omelette with their potatoes and wheat toast... I LOVED their potatoes and toast... The omelette was pretty standard. Service was great and good was out quick. The atmosphere was nice And I liked how it looked. I will definitely be returning since I live right down the street."}
{"text":"Pamela's is pretty great...to start, there will most likely be a wait at the door but if you sign your name up on the paper, you can settle in and think about the delicious crispy outsides of the pancakes you will want to order when your table is ready. We were visiting Pittsburgh for a family event and came across Pamela's in both the strip district and the one on Walnut street. Both are fantastic. I got the broccoli cheese omelette and my boyfriend got banana pancakes with walnuts and the ham and eggs. These are both delicious options. Their special potatoes are delicious. Coffee is brought to the table by the pitcher, which is much appreciated. Cash only, but guess what---it won't be that much because Pamela's is totally reasonable."}
{"text":"Deliciously hearty breakfast foods served up diner style. Service and turnover is quick so you never have to wait too long. The crepe style pancakes are a must have. Anything with their signature potatoes is a must have. Juices are not fresh squeezed, FYI."}
{"text":"We stopped for lunch on a Monday about 2 pm. Service was a bit slow, but fine. had the burger and Cuban with the special house potatoes and onion rings. Food was average at best. Next visit we will indulge in breakfast items, this seams to be their strength. But for lunch, just ok."}
{"text":"Food is always good. Cash only though. We had the chocolate banana and strawberry crepe cakes. Very unique, and would definetly at least share these, to try, if you go. Can't get them anywhere else, but an egg is an egg anywhere. Also the different hash are great and unique as well. Ask for their french press coffee, the guys at la prima said they sell theirs to pamelas and they call it Pamelas blend at the restaurant."}
{"text":"Unreal breakfast food! You have to get the chocolate chip pancakes or the breakfast burrito! They don't take cash so that's annoying, but it's worth it!"}
{"text":"Always have to come to Pamela's when I come back to Pittsburgh. Always crowded for breakfast on the weekends but so worth it. And the prices are right for the amount of food you get!"}
{"text":"This place knocked my socks off!  The wife's #1 place on her list and she nailed it. Looks to eating there again tomorrow!  If you don't try it you're missing out!"}
{"text":"Pamela's has big diner-sized portions of hearty, greasy food at reasonable prices. We had the crepe pancakes, burger and chorizo hash with eggs.  The crepe pancakes are plate sized, thinnish pancakes with deliciously and addictively crispy (fried) edges that lure you into eating more and more, even you're stuffed. The chorizo hash was spicy and delicious but pretty heavy, especially with the 3-egg scramble that accompanied it - toast also came with it but honestly I hate wasting food and wished I had asked them not to bring me any- it was excessive.  The burger looked good, and the heaping mound of onion rings along side it were crispy fried and tasty.  Not the best food ever but it hit the spot, and then some."}
{"text":"Get there earlier if you can because it fills up fast! The inside is colorful and the staff are friendly. I had the morning after special and upgraded to speciality hot cakes. The chocolate chip banana hot cakes are delicious! This Pamela's doesn't have the main options for hash meals like the squirrel hill Pamela's does, but still good."}
{"text":"This place was freaking amazing! We were told by our hotel that we needed to eat breakfast here and I am glad they did. On our last day in Pittsburgh we headed for a late breakfast.
I had a bacon cheese omelette with lyonnaise potatoes. I now crave those potatoes on a weekly basis. 
They take cash only so keep that in mind when you head over. I'm sure this place can get quite crowded, but we were lucky on a Sunday at noon and got a table right away."}
{"text":"Given the crowd at the door, It only took us 15-20 minutes to be seated thanks to the quick turnover and speedy service. Although one of my hosts recommended the thin crepe like pancakes that Pamela's is known for, I opted for a more protein based breakfast as I had been making pancakes earlier that week. I ordered the eggs and chorio which was spicy and juicy. The star of my dish had to be the breakfast potatoes with chopped onions. I could eat that with some over easy eggs and oozing yolk all day every day as long as my body could accept it.  I had a bite of the pancakes and was definitely a fan with the thin crispiness and sweet strawberry topping.

Definitely a place to stop by in Pittsburgh on a weekend morning followed by a stroll or grocery trip on the Strip on a carefree weekend morning."}
{"text":"Pamela's is essential when visiting Pittsburgh. Try atmosphere and the food are spot on for brunch any day of the week.

The strawberry hotcakes are my favorite!

Just always remember, Pamela's is cash only!"}
{"text":"This is the best breakfast I've had hands down. How do they make the homefries so amazing!?  I could eat here every single day for breakfast!!!  Get Gail's eggs!"}
{"text":"Please use real cheese in your omelettes!
Long wait, we got a table right by the kitchen, not a great place to sit and my chair was sticky ! 
Food took a long time to come."}
{"text":"any time im in pittsburgh i have to stop at pamela's.  it's an absolute staple!

the decor is more stimulating than the coffee (which, mind you, is awesome) and both work hand in hand to yank you out of your hangover (there's also something about pittsburgh that inspires beer consumption).  must tries: the pancakes and the hash browns.  awesome!"}
{"text":"To be honest, we didn't even know there was an Oakland location. And in our opinion it was better than the strip district location. Mainly because there is more room. But even the food was slightly better. I got a broccoli and cheese omelet which was very good and not greasy at all. My one complaint would be that they don't have Italian toast, even though the strip district one does (And for what it's worth, the waitress lied to me and said they did have Italian, hoping I wouldn't notice when she just brought me white. Nice try. I sent it back and got an English muffin.)

My wife ordered basted (since they don't poach) and they said the best they could do was cooked over hard but with spray instead of oil. Not as good she said, but it was nice that they offered to cook it with spray. 

Despite the toast and egg mishap, it was still a very good breakfast."}
{"text":"My wife and I ate at Pamela's the morning of the Pirates home opener, and even though it was 35 degrees outside, there was still about a 10-minute wait. But that isn't much of an issue because they have two dining areas and keep the queue moving pretty quickly. The service isn't really friendly, but it's efficient. And to be honest, that's more important in a tight, cramped, busy diner like Pamela's. I ordered a broccoli, cheddar and ham omelet, which was loaded with real, off-the-bone ham. It could have used more broccoli, but it was still very good. My wife, who loves poached eggs, had to settle for basted because they don't have the ability to poach (I don't understand why). She wasn't crazy about the greasiness of them, nor was she too happy with the canned side of fruit. So it's a mixed review for us. I liked it; her, not so much. What we do agree on though is that it is still second to DeLuca's when it comes to breakfast in the Strip District (and maybe third when you factor in Kelly O's)."}
{"text":"Waited an hour and a half for a table. Wowwwwwww. Food was good, not great. Has the Pittsburgh Hash and the chocolate chip pancakes. Can now say I've been here, but won't be back, definitely not worth the incredibly long wait."}
{"text":"Great brunch spot! I had the sausage and egg omelette, and my boyfriend had the tex mex omelette. They were both delicious! The service was also very quick and friendly. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"A great place to grab brunch on a lazy day when all you feel like doing is choke your arteries.
The omelette with mashed potatoes and hotcakes are my top favorites. Be sure to be carrying cash for this one !"}
{"text":"Typical diner atmosphere, giant portions.
Cash only so stop before you dine. Pleasant staff and family friendly. Coffee sucks tho so prepare for that or dont order it. I had the chorizo and eggs with potatoes and toast, couldn't finish it all despite being super hungry (that's hungry, with a cape) when we arrived. One tablemate ordered a short stack of pancakes, the pancakes were the size of the dinner plate!! So lots of food, which is great, but minus a star for cash only (who carries cash anymore?) and minus a star for the poor tasting coffee. Because what's breakfast without a good cup of coffee?"}
{"text":"I don't know how they make those hotcakes so thin but fluffy, but those were some of the tastiest things I've ever eaten!

There were seven in my party when we got there at 9:30 on a Saturday and there was a huge line outside, but they really turn over the tables so we only had to wait about 15 minutes and I would have been happy to wait even longer.   Everyone loved their meals, esp the malted waffle and those hotcakes.  I had the chocolate chip banana hotcakes and I'm not kidding when I say I can never eat pancakes again.

Service is fast and friendly.   If you like breakfast and you're in Pittsburgh, you should really make sure you visit Pamela's."}
{"text":"Pamela's is a great spot and near where I work, so it makes it a yummy choice that is convenient. Came here with a couple friends for breakfast the other week and the food was great, but the service was so-so. I've been to the Pamela's in Mt. Lebo as well, but awhile ago. I am sure I'll return, as this is a reliable spot with good food."}
{"text":"I love Pamela and her sweet hotcakes! *wink*

I was surprised to see the out-the-door line at 9am, but well worth the wait!  Plus, the diverse neighborhood was lots of fun to browse around, and the affordable tasty, hearty (very) breakfast is well worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Pamela's has been my favorite brunch place in Pittsburgh since I moved here seven years ago. I don't have a favorite location. They're all great and all have the same great menu. Huge portions. I always have leftovers to take home for the next meal."}
{"text":"Thankfully, it was a nice day because (as always) we waited outside for a good 40 minutes before being seated. 

Once seated, we quickly ordered. I got the blueberry pancakes, and my friend got an omelette. My pancakes were absolutely incredible, and I stole a bite of his hash browns-- to die for!! 

I have nothing bad to say about my experience, and I can't wait to go back! 

(Tip for the newbies, you go inside, write your name on the list, then wait outside. )"}
{"text":"Food is absolutely amazing. \"Pancakes\" are more like crepes and are the size of a plate! Potatoes that come with breakfast are also awesome. Worst part is that the wait is always insane (probably because the food is awesome)...and also, they don't take credit cards, which kind of stinks. However, the service is generally pretty good, and once you've placed your order, they are pretty quick to bring it out. Waiting to be seated is the hardest part. They're usually packed between 10-2 on weekends, but if you go at that time on a weekday, you'll have no problem being seated. Remember that they're only open for breakfast and lunch!"}
{"text":"Pamela's is considered the quintessential Pittsburgh breakfast joint. This is the place that everyone wants to take you as soon as you come to the city. When I first moved to Pittsburgh, I can't tell you how many times I was asked, \"Have you been to Pamela's yet?\" Locals love this place. I have been there twice now, and I regret to say that I am not so enamored with it.

I am not usually a huge diner fan to begin with, so I will just preface my review by saying that. I don't enjoy the old-school vibes exuded by diners, nor the greasy fried food options. Today at Pamela's I had the western omelette, which included ham, onions, and peppers. I wasn't extremely impressed with the flavor of the omelette, and it tasted very overly buttery. The Italian toast on the side came out cold which was a big turn off for me. The redeeming factor of this breakfast was the lyonnaise potatoes, which (although greasy) were very tasty. 

As a whole, I give the meal a 2/5. It just wasn't impressive or special, and was comparable in taste and quality to all the other diner food I've had before in my life. I much prefer the freshness of breakfast options found at places like Marty's Market, which is only a couple blocks away from Pamela's in the strip. I know that Pamela's is a big Pittsburgh tradition, but I won't be bringing my out of town visitors here any time soon."}
{"text":"Greasy, brown, skinny, overcooked omelet...again. Second visit for a breakfast meeting. I avoid carbs so I ordered an omelet. Didn't need the toast and potatoes that came with it. Judging from my previous experience, today omelet and online pictures, the cooks must intentionally spread a thin layer of egg on a very hot griddle and cook until rubbery, crispy, and toasty. Honestly was hard to cut with the edge of my fork. Not what I personally am looking for in an omelet. Obviously appeals to others or maybe it's just the pancakes and waffles that garner a high rating. I'm done with Pamela's."}
{"text":"Although we had recommendations from a friend to go to another place for brunch, we decided to try Pamela's when we saw that they had four stars on Yelp and there was a HUGE line on the street waiting to get in. 

First things first, if you are thinking about going here: They are cash only. There's a PNC bank with an ATM machine right around the corner on Penn Ave if you, like us, don't normally carry cash. Then, even if there's a huge line, go inside right away and put your name in the waiting list. We waited a good ten minutes in line before realizing that the line was meaningless - you really need to have your name in the list, and then go outside and wait. The line goes pretty fast, though, so don't get intimidated by the size of it.

Our son had a feta and spinach omelet and loved it (another AWESOME). I had a veggie and feta omelet, and my husband the ham and cheese. Our omelets were OK - nothing to rave about it like our son was doing about his spinach and feta. And the omelets were kind of tiny, especially when compared with the amount of potatoes that are served in the plate. I did wish the omelet was the star and \"kind of the plate\", not the potatoes and toast. Looks like their strength is in the carb world, after all. My son and I also tried the hotcakes - my first time having it and they were worth every single second of stomach pain the gluten gave me after eating a few bites. The outskirts of the cakes were really crunchy like a waffle cone, and the inside is a thin, light pancake. Really good! I just couldn't eat a lot not only because of the gluten, but also because of the guilt - they are NOT a diet food. VERY buttery, but what else would you expect of them, right? As I told my husband, they taste like the ultimate winter breakfast comfort food. I can only imagine a really cold morning, freshly brewed coffee, and hotcakes. Yum! 

And talking about coffee, theirs was really good. Not too strong and not bitter at all, just the way I like it. The waitress eventually left a carafe of decaf for me at the table, which I really appreciated, because their mugs are kind of tiny. 

Final thing to be aware: When we were done eating we waited forever for the check to come (our waitress could have been a bit less absent...). When we finally asked the waitress for the check, she told us with a \"this is the most natural thing in the world\"  face that the check had been delivered with our food a long time ago. How come we didn't think of that, right? We really didn't see the check among the 300 other things in the table. So if you are not from the area and don't know how things work over there, bring cash, put your name in the list, and keep an eye out for the check which comes WITH your food.

Three stars because I didn't think that the breakfast was that awesome. Probably would think otherwise if I knew their system, ate gluten, and wasn't aware of carbs."}
{"text":"Hours are limited and it's right in the heart of the Strip District, so be prepared to wait a minimum of 20 minutes. It is very worth it, though. Prices were incredibly reasonable and there was a large seating area with an old school diner feel to it. The tex mex omelette was excellent.. I'm a big fan of chorizo, and they got this right. I got a side of \"hot cakes\" (I'm from NJ where it's pancakes), and I loved the structure of these cakes. Thin with a crusty edge.. never had them made like that before. HUGE fan. Looking forward to coming back when I'm in Pittsburgh again."}
{"text":"I would probably put it at 4.5 stars if there was an option. This has been the best overall dining experience in Pittsburgh since I moved here a few months ago. A lot of places in Pitt are hype machines, but this is the real deal if you like good old fashion American-style breakfast grub. The place has character, too."}
{"text":"Very good place for breakfast! Staff was friendly and quick, cash only! I had the thin pancakes like crepes with Banana`s and Nutella very very yummy! My Dad had chicken fried steak said it was the best he had ever had!! We will be back!!"}
{"text":"One of God's gifts to this world. Highly recommend the Tex-Mex Omelet if you aren't feeling the phenomenal specialty hotcakes!! H2P, hail2pamelas"}
{"text":"This is probably by far my favorite location. The food portions are immense. Beyond belief. I love the hot cakes more than anything and always order them with a side of sausage. My daughter and I will often share the hot cakes and I'll eat the sausage (she's vegan) and we still have leftovers. Totally could feed a family of four on one hot cake. Ok so i am exaggerating a bit but hey it's delicious and plentiful."}
{"text":"Luke C just an FYI about our walnut at restaurant. Pam and Gail by no means designers but plain old pittsburgh gals are responsible for this change. But the good news is the focal point will be walls of pittsburgh everyday people young and old done by local artist and muralist Sandy Kessler Kaminski. Give us another try in August. Art takes time. But no matter what we still have the same Hotcakes and homefries. Hope to see you soon. Gail Klingensmith"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Make sure you download the \"No Wait\" app so you can put your name in so you don't have to wait as long for a table. This location can get pretty busy on the weekends. 

They have great hot cakes and omelets! I've had the blueberry hot cakes, the morning after dish and the banana peanut butter hot cakes! They're all great! The edges on the hot cakes are crispy and delicious. Along with the crispness, the hot cakes are soft and fluffy on the inside. 

The menu isn't very large but all of the dishes are fantastic!"}
{"text":"This is my 2nd time going to Pamela' s but my my 1st review of the place. I really enjoyed it my 1st time going 3 years ago. I remember the pancakes, the potatoes, the customer service,  and the wall decor. Fast foward 3 years later.... EXACT QUALITY OF SERVICE! I LOVE THIS PLACE!!!! If you have NOT been to this place you HAVE to go!"}
{"text":"I got the suggestion to have brunch at this diner from the guy at the front desk at the Renaissance hotel. Apparently he thought telling me that the President loves the pancakes there would be a selling point, and well... sure, I'll bite.

Walking up to the place, there was a huge crowd outside as well as inside. A packed diner is always a good sign, so we walked in and put our name on the list. They have a pretty good system going, where they have you sign in at the front counter, and a host has another list with him; once his list is finished he'll pick up the list on the counter, then they start a new list. It seemed pretty efficient in turning the tables over. We were told the wait would be about 25 minutes, but it flew by since we were able to people-watch and check out the yummy foods being served.

The menu is pretty standard for a diner - though I chose the chorizo and eggs, which was delicious. *Chorizo = a must-order.* They advertised their potatoes as \"lyonnaise\" which I have not a clue what it means, but they were really good too. I pretty much licked my plate clean when I was done. Ok maybe I didn't, but my plate was completely finished and I was a satisfied pig. There was several times when my friend and I laid back on our chairs and just moaned, in like the really full, content kind of way. If it wasn't for the 15 min walk back to the hotel I would have taken a nap right on the sidewalk. 

If you love diners, and happen to be in Pittsburgh, check this place out."}
{"text":"Busy place to get a spot on the weekends! Bring cash only (I think from what I recall). Such awesome food to get your brunch on!"}
{"text":"I visited here for the umpteenth time the other morning and I must say, it's legit. You know those places that have been around forever and ever and just give up? This is absolutely NOT one of them. No wonder President Obama digs them!

I am a mad hotcake fan here, as the banana chocolate chip are my all time favorite. Trying to be \"good\" I opted for a spinach and feta omelet. I realized there really was no being good, it was bad, but in the best possible way. Follow me?

I mean, I always love the sweet stuff rather than the savory for breakfast, so omelet's are fairly boring to me. But this omelet was seriously so tasty. The spinach was incredibly flavorful and the feta was the same. Great distribution. The eggs were crisp, but buttery. Not too buttery, but buttery enough that I knew this was no healthy option. Oh well, it was delicious! I threw caution to the wind...

On top of that it comes with two pieces of wheat toast and incredible Lyonnaise
Potatoes, which I savored every. single. bite. of. I usually love crispy hashbrowns, but that isn't even a thought after biting into these taters. 

If you have a chance, avoid the weekend crowd, take a day off and enjoy a leisurely breakfast here during the week. It's definitely not half as crowded as it usually is. You actually just seat yourself! So treat yo'self with a cheat day soon."}
{"text":"The reviews are true:  this is a great breakfast place -- definitely the best restaurant we visited while in Pittsburgh.

The restaurant itself is festive, with old game boards lining the walls.  There was a huge line, but they moved people through very quickly.  Not sure how, since the servers did not rush anyone.

The menu is pretty typical breakfast fare, but it's really well-prepared, and the servings are quite generous at the price.  One thing puzzled me:  the toast is served very dry, with no butter, no jelly."}
{"text":"Pamela's in the Strip District is one of my favorite places to bring friends and family from out of town for brunch to give them a taste of Pittsburgh in both food and neighborhood. I can't be the only one to think the same as its the same location they took Pres. Obama during his Pittsburgh visit. It has a large menu with enough options to please anyone. Cash only."}
{"text":"I was in Pittsburgh visiting my boyfriend and this was the first place he took me.  What I absolutely loved about this place were the hotcakes and potatoes!  I also had some eggs and toast.  And it's a lot.  I really could not finish my plate.  But the hotcakes were so yummy, a little crunchy and soft where it counted.  They were thin and filling, and cooked to perfection.  The eggs were seasoned to my tasting and I couldn't stop eating it.  I'm not a big breakfast person, because it's the same food with no twist, but this totally caught me off guard because it was so different from what I'm used to.  Definitely worth coming here!"}
{"text":"For being so popular, I expected much more from Pamela's. My order came out completely wrong. It wasn't that great when I actually got what I ordered. Service was bad. Just average experience, not at all what I expected."}
{"text":"We were fortunate to visit early on a weekday. No wait! Fantastic staff, retro vibe and enjoyed the sauerkraut and kielbasa hash. Great way to start our visit to Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Great diner option for breakfast and brunch. It is cash only, so keep that in mind before you go there. The breakfast selection has something for everyone. Definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"Just go here. That is all. Don't let the crowd scare you away, they move quick. Best breakfast food ever."}
{"text":"I came around 11:40 AM for brunch and ordered the Morning After Breakfast Special with chocolate chip and banana pancakes. While the entire diner was packed, I was disappointed that I did not receive my food until 12:07 PM. With regard to the quality of food, it was good. The eggs (over easy) were cooked exactly to order. The pancakes had a cooked amount of fluff to them and weren't thick and carb-loaded like IHOP. Price of $10 is also fair."}
{"text":"This place is a Pittsburgh institution and for good reason. 

Pamela's has had quite a face lift since my Pitt days, but it's been a nice improvement. The bright colors and game board decor is a welcome change from washboards and old country items that used to hang on the walls. I'm glad the aesthetics haven't changed the yummy food.

The crepes are so tasty - order them (I suggest strawberry); you won't be disappointed. Add a side of potatoes and a bottomless pot of coffee for the full experience. It'll do wonders for a hangover. Pamela's does serve sandwiches and salads for lunch (except on Sundays), but you take 'em or leave 'em - it's their breakfast menu that makes this place what it is."}
{"text":"The ONLY downside to this place is the wait. Although I'm guessing I just went at a bad time - Saturday brunch - packed house! Eh well, so worth the wait. Not to mention while you're waiting, if you're just visiting the city - peruse the rest of the area before and after, you may have to leave \"that guy\" waiting in line for ya because if you don't you get bumped - old school right! haha
Once you're seated - holy crap they're quick.  I mean from the first round of waters, to the ordering, even to getting the food to you - even if it is mostly breakfast food, still!
If you've got that person in the group or pair that \"just/already ate\" - ditch them or make them get hungry because this place will easily put you into a food coma after the first bite! I tend to eat a lot and I almost didn't finish my plate - that should never happen - least of all to me. haha
Anyway, highly recommend."}
{"text":"Thick, crispy, flavorful bacon. Awesome crepe-style pancakes (my personal favorite).  Enough said.  They know how to make over-medium eggs are too. Reasonable prices and a cool throwback decor mixed in with an outstanding breakfast will have us coming back for sure."}
{"text":"A very popular place, with Obama's visit as the most recent claim to fame...and they definitely play that up. Very much a college, cool kid's place feel. The servers are nice, the portions are generous. Got the classic bacon, eggs, and pancakes deal. The protein wasn't anything special but the pancakes were delicious! They look huge but are crepe thin. The edges are crisped and taste almost carmelized."}
{"text":"I usually always enjoy eating at Pamela's because it's always for a special occasion. This time it was a brunch to catch up with friends. I love love love love love their breakfast home fries and have been tempted (on several occasions) to order just a plate of their potatoes. SO GOOD. The rest of the food was just okay. I got the chorizo with 2 eggs and wheat toast. I think they're slightly overpriced for diner food AND also for being cash only. 

We each ordered something different and though we enjoyed our food, the service today was really bad. It was busy but one of us had asked for OJ and the waitress totally forgot about it. Another waitress had to take our orders because our original waitress was preoccupied. And then when we wanted a box to take our leftovers, it took for freaking ever to flag down anyone to ask for a box."}
{"text":"I had breakfast here a couple weeks ago on a sunday around 1030 am.  The weather was nice and the line wasn't that long I thought.  I think we waited about 20 minutes.  This was my first visit to this location and I can say that this location is probably my favorite.  I like the art deco feel and all the old pictures on the wall and I find this location especially \"bright\".  Here's what I really like about Pamelas.  I like the fact that you get your own pot of coffee on your table.  I like that the staff always seems friendly.  I think there pancakes are my favorite in the city.  I'm old school, so I don't throw on any whipped cream or other accompaniments (sp?).  I like just butter and tons of syrup.  I am not a fan of really fluffy or really thin (crepe) pancakes. I'd describe these as \"crepe like\" finding the perfect balance for me.  I also like the crispy edges on the pancakes.  I like that the orange juice is served in an adult size glass.  Now, they should improve on the following right away.  The bacon is crap... I mean worse than the stuff you get on your bacon egg n cheese biscuit at mickey d's.  They don't do poached eggs (my favorite).  They don't have skim milk (I know it's like ordering diet coke with a whopper, but I gotta save calories somewhere)    I ordered the \"morning after\", which is two pancakes (delish), bacon (next time I'll get ham or sausage) and two eggs (no poacching as previously mentioend) and a side of corned beef hash.  I was very pleased with this.  It almsot tasted dare I say healthy.  It wasn't smashed up corned beefish type out of a can.  It was good quality corned beef diced with perfectly crisped not soggy hash browns.  Annie got a cheese omelet that was huuuuge (a la paris hilton's new saying).  She said it was great and certainly looked very good, however I simply couldn't bring myself to try it.  Don't forget they only take CASH."}
{"text":"This place has a 50s diner feel. There are great photos from a passed Era that really give it a retro feel. There are two rooms but I only saw the front one. 
There really isn't a great waiting area and the hostess doesn't take your name, instead you write it on a piece of paper and put the size or your party next to it. You will not be given a wait time unless you ask. Even with a large number of people, the turnaround is fairly quick. We had over 10 parties in front of us and got seated in less than 30 minutes.
The food is good. I got a breakfast sandwich on Italian bread ( aka white bread). It had a fried egg, cheese and cut sausage links and was really good. My husband got French toast and thought it was great, better than our favorite breakfast place to go back home. It was fluffy and had a good flavor. We both got bacon and man was it the tastiest bacon I've ever eaten, it just needed to be a bit crisper (but we didn't ask for it crispy, we know better for next time). The coffee was solid. Not the best cup I've ever had but not the worst either.
Overall I think the ravings for this place are well deserved. It's a good homemade style breakfast for a decent price!"}
{"text":"**CASH ONLY**

WAIT: Came on a Monday for breakfast, the wait was no more than 10 minutes

FOOD: I tried the TEX MEX OMELET, FAMOUS CREPE HOTCAKES, and the usual SIDES.  I enjoyed my omelet --great flavor, though the GUACAMOLE looked like the prepackaged ones that are liquified.  Not a fan of the guac...maybe I'm spoiled with an abundance of avocados in Cali but I like my avocados fresh, not from a bag. 

The potatoes were good...not sure its worth all the rave about them though...

I'd order the omelete again but not the HOTCAKES.  Its not a matter of preference between crepe cakes or fluffy pancakes...I don't discriminate between them.  If they are good, they're good.  I couldn't have more than a few bites of these hotcakes.  They were way to greasy.  So greasy that I was clearing my throat from it for the next 30 minutes after I left Pamela's.

SERVICE: The minimum --seat you, water, order, serve you food, then the ck when you flag them down.

BOTTOM LINE: I'm glad I got a chance to try this place out.  I wouldn't visit again if the wait is longer than 20 min and I wouldn't feel like I'm missing out if I don't come back.  I can see why people enjoy this place, its just not for me.  Maybe I'm spoiled from the large number of great breakfast places in the LA and SF area??"}
{"text":"If you love breakfast than this is the place for you. There are three locations so be sure to go to the one closest to you! the pancakes are so delicious that you can't possibly have a bad day if you're starting with a plate of these warm and crispy flapjacks. They have special way of making breakfast potatoes such that you will understand the lines outside on a Saturday. It is cash only but also fairly cheep! it's a fail safe for everyone."}
{"text":"Visiting Pittsburgh for the weekend and I was told this is the place for breakfast. We were however warned about the wait, We got there at about 9 on Sunday morning and the wait was only about 10 minutes so that was pretty surprising. However at about 11 am we walked back passed and it was out the door down the block.

Coffee is good, hot cakes are ridiculous, California French toast amazing, potatoes to die for. Real diner atmosphere. The \"host\" just kind of grabs you and points you to your table and I don't think we had one specific waiter but everything worked out. 

Def recommend."}
{"text":"My office used to be based in the strip and we would eat out at pamelas constantly.  I'm not normally a breakfast or diner fan, but pamelas elevates typically bland fare to gourmet perfection.  I particularly recommend their onion rings with ranch dressing, their fruit pancakes and the turkey la feria salad.  Easily the best brunch in Pittsburgh and an excellent value!"}
{"text":"Me and a group of friends were regulars at this restaurant for breakfast every wednesday morning.  But after our last visit I don't think we will be returning. The food is excellent but severely over priced, one glass of orange juice is 5 dollars.  Service is mediocre, and the workers constantly complain about tips, even if you tip \"well\".  I went with my group of 6 and we ate a meal worth a combined 50$ and then left a 12$ tip.  Upon exiting the restaurant me and my group were rudely spoken too and told that we don't tip enough, even though we tipped over the standard 20% gratuity rate.  Don't go to this restaurant unless you want a hole burnt through your pocket and rude service."}
{"text":"Great place to eat.  We ordered the crepe pancake specials with blue berries and french toasts.  They were great.  The coffee was weak, I would skip that unless you must have your coffee with your breakfast.  We went Sunday morning, the line was long but I think if you aren't starving, it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Pamela's on Walnut St., but the remodel is TERRIBLE. My friends and I felt like we were sitting in a hospital cafeteria. Who did they hire to do this? It went from a cozy neighborhood breakfast spot to a room of sterile, tasteless, and tacky décor. Not to mention the construction and paint work is horribly done. Very, VERY disappointed. We will be looking for a new place for our weekend brunches. 

Dear Pamela's, 
PLEASE go back to the old décor!"}
{"text":"I have been in search of pancakes like
this since a visit to Seatlle. Thes pancakes are so thin and wonderfully
crispy around the edges, yummy! 
It was 19 degrees outside 
yet people were still waiting to eat at Pamela's.
If your ever in Pittsburgh make this a must
on your list. We will be returning for breakfast
before our trip is over! 
You don't want to miss out on this great little place.
Anyone know fof a place like this in Orange County, California?"}
{"text":"Fantastic! Super friendly and super fast. Food was amazing diner food as well. Hit the spot for breakfast as well."}
{"text":"There was about a 15-20 minute wait to get a table, which was not too bad. The service was prompt, after ordering the breakfast if came in about 5 minutes! We had the famous hotcakes, since almost all the reviews were mentioning them. I had the banana-walnut hotcakes and my daughter the chocolate chip hotcakes. Both were decadently delicious, and a great finish to our Pittsburgh trip!"}
{"text":"It was just OK for me. A cash only establishment that gets very busy, I just wanted a no thrills sort of pancakes and eggs breakfast, and for that it delivered. Service was a bit slow, but the big portions made up for it...almost too big...IS there such a thing? I had the pancakes that are sort of mixed with a crepe, they were huge and not too bad. My egg was quite overdone however, but the sausages were good. Prices are on point, just not really a place I could see coming back to all the time, especially with the crowds."}
{"text":"#1 place to take out of towners.  I mean Obama chose these pancakes once which is good enough for me. I remember when after living in Pittsburgh for six months an employee of mine looked at me like I didn't speak english cause I had never been here. Now that I have been here like 25 times I wonder how I haven't reviewed this place before. I have to be honest everything is average except for the pancakes which are are like 27 stars!"}
{"text":"you must come here, and you may even want to dedicate 2 separate breakfast/brunch meals here! 

hotcakes are the specialty, and you can get them a variety of ways. they're really good plain, but also super delish with the stuff in it (ie banana choco chip, blueberry, strawberry). personal fav is the strawberry or plain. i usually get plain hotcakes sans butter, and sprinkle granulated sugar on =)

other things to try: corned beef hash is yummmmy. 

out of all the pamela's, i like this one the best. this is also the place i mist most from pitts=( it's soooooooooo greasy delicious awesome."}
{"text":"I don't know how anyone gives this place any rating less than five stars. Yes, there is a wait. Yes, it is always crowded. Yes, service is sometimes better than others. Yes, parking is a nightmare. Yes, they only take cash. But one bite of their house-made chorizo and Lyonnaise potatoes erases any other shortcomings that may exist. I have tried just about every item on their breakfast menu and can say without reservation that it is all incredible.

This is the one place in Pittsburgh that we never, ever, ever miss going to each time we are in town. The food is always hot, fresh, and absolutely delicious. From the crispy-edged pancakes to the funky Trash Hash, there isn't one false start in the bunch. They also make a great cup of bottomless coffee!

Bottom line: if you only have time for one restaurant in Pittsburgh, don't waste it on Primanti Bros. Go to Pamela's!"}
{"text":"Breakfast is here when you are in Philly. Their pancakes/hotcakes/crepes are divine.... no syrup is needed. It has a sour, sweet taste that just melts in your mouth and is super addicting. They use fresh ingredients which adds to the amazing flavor. The staff is also great... super friendly and funny. I would definitely recommend this spot."}
{"text":"Solid food, acceptable service. Not going to make you say WOW but not going to disappoint either."}
{"text":"This diner is a classic and it never disappoints. Every person who comes to town I make sure that they stop here for the family atmosphere, fast service, and delicious food."}
{"text":"Not the place for local, organic, grass-fed, gourmet riff-raff. Pamela's is known for stick-to-your-ribs diner food and they do it very well. Definitely my go-to for weekend brunch or hangover recovery in Pittsburgh. The Oakland location you'll find is often full of Pitt or Carnegie Mellon students, whereas the Squirrel Hill and Shadyside locations usually have a more yuppie-type clientele.

Pamela's hotcakes are a masterpiece. Never mind that they use pounds and pounds of butter for these hotcakes, you'll be hard-pressed to find pancakes/crepes as delicious as these. What's great is that they can be eaten alone in a savory manner, or piled with fruit and whipped cream and more butter for a sweeter breakfast experience. The lyonnaise potatoes are also something to marvel at. You can ask them to griddle the potatoes a little longer for a crispier taste, which I definitely recommend. 

The omelets are all pretty standard fare here, but they do them consistently well every time I've been. Best thing is that most combinations or menu items will only run you at about $8-10, with tip and tax about $13. Pretty awesome. Only downside is that it's cash only, but since there are a couple ATM's and a PNC nearby, it can be overlooked. 

Overall, come here for some of the best breakfast comfort food that Pittsburgh has to offer."}
{"text":"Cheap diner with average brunches. It's a safe go-to if you want to have brunch out as long as you have cash. I'm a big eater and always feel full and satisfied after a visit. Service is quick, and the employees are friendly."}
{"text":"Staying in Pittsburgh for the night and walked down the street looking for breakfast. A woman walking her dog overheard us and recommended Pamela's. Done! Everyone had a great meal. The sides of Lyonnaise potatoes are amazing and the crepes looked great, too."}
{"text":"Pamela's is famous locally in Pittsburgh and the atmosphere is real, true Pittsburgh \"diner\" from the cramped space and crowds to the stereotype motherly bustling waitresses. Huge portions at low cost all cooked to order...
The food itself...is just alright. Nothing remarkable. Pancakes and breakfest menu are fine, somewhat overrated. Go once for local \"flavor\", then walk around the Strip District to actually fill up afterward."}
{"text":"I was in town for a quick business trip. One of my colleagues live here. I asked where a good breakfast spot. He suggested Pamela's. He said their Crepe style pancakes were to die for. Well, he wasn't joking. Great place. Great service."}
{"text":"Great Breakfast. Worth the wait. The pancakes/shortcakes/crepes are to die for."}
{"text":"The wife and I went here on the recommendation of several friends who live in Pittsburgh, and it is as advertised! My Chorizo and eggs were fantastic. The hand pattied chorizo had enough spice to remind you that you were eating chorizo, but not drain your sinuses either! Eggs were cooked to perfection and the potatoes were soft and flavorful. The wife got the strawberry hotcakes which was also another strong effort by the kitchen. The hotcakes are a thin pancake that acts as a crepe. The crepe is stuffed with fruit, brown sugar, and sour cream. It sounds weird, but it totally works!!

This place loses a star because it is a cash only establishment. And because it's 2016 and I'm an adult, I expected to be able to pay the bill with my card since I rarely carry cash when traveling domestically. So I had to walk around the corner to PNC ATM and get wallet raped to the tune of almost $4 to get some cash out."}
{"text":"Pamela's was a definite highlight of my visit to Pittsburgh.  

The hotcakes are as delicious as everyone, including Obama, claims. I opted for the banana-walnut variety, and I loved each and every thin, buttery, crispy-crunchy bite. The Lyonnaise potatoes were equally delicious. The pot of coffee on the table was another source of joy. And the whole carb-tastic meal proved to truly be a breakfast of champions, as I was full for the rest of the day.

We visited on a weekday, so there was no wait, which was nice. I understand that the waits get long on the weekends, but I assure you that it's definitely worth the wait. Just be sure to bring cash so you don't have to scramble over to the ATM while you're waiting -- no credit cards or checks accepted."}
{"text":"Wow I couldn't even eat all my bacon cheese omelette, home fries, and rye toast, and it still kept me full from 11, when I had brunch, to 9PM!  Usually I hate homefries, but these were great!  I think I can only go here like once a year though, to prevent my heart from exploding."}
{"text":"The past weekend, I was visiting my bff's in Pittsburgh.  We decided to do Sunday brunch, and I asked bff 1 where she wanted to go - she said she'd heard Pamela's in Shadyside was amazing, and had been dying to go there.  BFF 2 said she had heard all about it and she too had been dying to go, and so it was decided.  

with hype like that, i was hoping it would live up to expectations.  when we arrived, we put our names on the list and waited for about 10-15 minutes.  Pamela's is pretty small, there are maybe 20 tables - some for only 2, some for 4-tops, but the turn over time seems pretty fast.  we settled in and looked over the menu.  the prices are pretty amazing - you can easily do brunch here for under $10/person.  i ordered the strawberry \"hotcakes\" which are not actually crepes, despite what reviews here say... but they are a bit thinner than regular pancakes (crepes would be much thinner than this) and rolled up like crepes.  mine were stuffed with sliced strawberry, brown sugar, and usually sour cream (i asked for mine w/o the sour cream - this place is enough of a greasy spoon).  others at the table had the strawberry and blueberry hotcakes.  we also ordered the hash browns for the table to share.  

the hotcakes are most certainly fried - the edges are greasy and crisp.  delicious to eat!  i think i may have made a mistake ordering no sour cream, b/c the hotcake stuffed with strawberries and dry piles of brown sugar was at times too sweet for me.  next time, i'd ask for very light sour cream or possibly no sour cream and no brown sugar.  the hash browns were amazingly delicious, so buttery and melt in your mouth good.  these were gobbled up by the 3 of us!  the hotcakes were large, and too much for me to finish!  

service was ok - pamela's is a pretty simple place in that aspect, you see your server when you order and to drop off the check.  aside from that, they stand back and let you marvel at the good food.  i would definitely return to pamela's on my next trip to the 'burgh."}
