{"text":"Just go somewhere else!  Really really terrible service and if the guy is not out front smoking he is going from handling cash to touching food.  They need more staff and staff that knows how to clean.  The one guy is overwhelmed and probably nobody wants to work with him.  We call him \"piggy\""}
{"text":"This restaurant is filthy.  The tables are always dirty, condiment area filthy and soda machine nasty.  I wonder what the kitchen looks like.  This place needs to be inspected by the health dept."}
{"text":"Best friggin fast food seafood ever.  Location is prime. Service is always fairly quick. Hush puppies are crispy and lightly oily - just the way they should be. Clam strips and fish always taste freshly pulled from the oil. My order has always been 100% correct. I've honestly never been disappointed.  Actual customer service could be better. Fast food or not, it's your job to not appear too disgruntled. They get really stingy with the napkins and condiments - particularly tartar sauce. Whenever I politely ask for more, they always give me a pinched faced look and then WHACK! The tartar gets thrown angrily into the bag and shoved out the window.  But I don't care. I'll keep coming back for those delicious hush puppies as long as they stay fresh and cheap."}
{"text":"We have frequented this restaurant for a few times, but today was the last!  As Kathy R. explains, the place is very dirty, food is less than mediocre and the staff is not professional.  There were no napkins or forks without asking, and the malt vinegar, which is a must for fish and chips, was split among several bottles, (all with a greasy feeling) and if totaled would not have equaled a tablespoon.  I would not invite ANYONE there for even a free meal!!!"}
{"text":"Martin Mull is trying to seduce Terri Garr and she ain't having it!  Oops, must turn off TV to write about delicious $.99 fish tacos at the great, wonderful, fantastic LJS!  If you don't like fish or are put off by the smell, have no fear, batter and oil are here.  And if you've had a hush puppie you know what heaven tastes like.  Well maybe not heaven, but 65,000 ft or so...  Good fries also."}
{"text":"The mgr could take a few pointers from the behind the counter workers. Ordered food no problem brought out quickly. All good. Wanted to wash my hands before eating waiting for men's room to open no luck. Knock on door and call out. Nothing, turns out door was locked. Notify worker, she tells mgr then I wait and wait, mgr comes out but start pulling out cups etc. finally get her attention and gives me attitude. After 15 mins finally get to wash hands. The bathroom was nasty. Next time I'll wash my hands in advance."}
{"text":"The food was entirely too hard and crispy... not good for anyones teeth. But the food was served pretty fast and the cashier had manners"}
{"text":"Terrible. Just terrible. Horrible service. RUDE management. They NEVER \"participate\" in the national promotions. Most importantly, the food is subpar. I love LJS so much that I keep coming back in hopes of a better experience but that's it I give up."}
{"text":"This restaurant sucks. First they don't have much for options like popcorn shrimp, onion rings or rice like the online menu says. What seafood place has no popcorn shrimp!! Then we had to pull up and wait for the shrimp to be cooked. Then we get home to find out they forgot the freakin hushpuppies. The fries were very sogy, hardly any tartar sauce. The clams were many small crunchy clams. What an awful experience on my daughter's birthday when she was craving hushpuppies only not to get them at all!! I will never go to this place ever again!!"}
{"text":"Love the chicken at this place. Something I can't eat all the time, but it is a treat when I do."}
{"text":"It's Long John Silvers. Tastes like all the rest. The A&W Root Beer addition has added some nice variety and great RB floats."}
{"text":"The worst service ever! You will not only wait in line for a very unreasonable time but you will be lucky to see any of the employees even around a majority of the time.  Seen customer after customer just standing there with nobody at the register to even wait on them. This place should be shut down. If you need a napkin you may have to go in the bathroom and get some toilet paper because they hid them from their customers."}
{"text":"Nasty dirty filthy place. Floors filthy. Tables all dirty and sticky. Bathroom trash all over the floor and no paper towels to dry hands. Manager apparently does not keep stock of napkins or utensils either :( Food was decent, but I'll never take step in there again!"}
{"text":"Long wait for dried up fish. Just to train a new guy how to make hush puppies?? Never seen a fast food operation run so badly!!"}
{"text":"Never again!  We were not able to order ANY food for the drive thru never took my order.  Me and the lady behind me had to back out after sitting for 13 minutes!!!  Should have known after trying to go here 2 other times which were unsuccessful as well.  NEVER AGAIN and it's only a matter of time before this location is shut down.  what a shame."}
{"text":"Rude employees, and poor customer service. What more could anyone expect from half of a Long John Silver's? Oh, I forgot to mention that the parking lot layout reminds me of and ergonomic chair from Ikea that was put together by the blind.  I'm sorry if I've offended any blind people by associating them with this restaurant."}
{"text":"I went to the restaurant for the first time. I got the number 1 combo which was two pieces of fish, a piece of chicken and three shrimp. My sides were rice and green beans.  I sat in the drive through for 20-25 min to get through. the fried foods had all the same flavor. there was distinguishing the difference in the flavor of the fried food. I woke up at 2:30 feeling a little sick. I tried to ignore it for as long as I could. At 5:45am I woke up throwing up and 10 min later I ended back sitting on the toilet. I will never eat at this restaurant again at any of there locations."}
{"text":"Got my drive-thru order wrong...discovered it when I got home.  Then I couldn't get through to their phone number."}
{"text":"This is the best fast food fish establishment ever. The wait for the food after you order can be a while but it's worth it. The food is fantastic and the lobby is very clean. The fish batter is flakey and leave a ton of crumbs on your plate afterwards. It is also very greasy they'd why they have a stack if napkins at the table. I would highly recommend this place to anybody who enjoys fried fish."}
{"text":"This, being my first experience with this location, left everything lacking. The line was slow to move, the wait staff rude and helpful under protest.   The fish that were delivered to the table initially were burnt to a crisp. How anyone could look at black fish and decide to serve them is beyond reason.   When asked for a take home box at the counter my girlfriend was completely ignored by all three of the staff at the counter, so I had to literally stop the boy sweeping the floor and have him gather up take home boxes. His attitude was piss poor to say the least.   I will not frequent this location again nor do I recommend this to anyone, poor food, poor service and poor area."}
{"text":"I just waited 40 minutes for 4 cars to go through the drive-thru. Of course I was the 4th car and penned in so I could not escape. When I finally got to the window the girl handed me my bag with my meal box turned sideways so of course coleslaw was everywhere. Then, I get home and find napkins, but NO eating utensils!  Someone really needs to MANAGE this property in other than title only. The blonde at the window was trying to make sure she lived up to the \"blondes are airheads\" motto; asked me three times which sauce I wanted.  I believe I'll find another location next time."}
{"text":"This is the first time I ever did any type of online review. I had to write this with hopes the health dept gets involved.  I have never been in such a filthy place in my life. It smelt like something was rotting inside. There's absolutely nothing clean about this restaurant.  The dining room, the food prep area and the bathroom.   When I came into the restaurant there was an employee wiping off tables with a dirty rag, then went and served me my food, without stopping to wash his hands.  I have to say thou the employees were very nice. I actually feel bad that they are working in such deplorable conditions.  Please, please take my advice, do not eat here This place was worse than any disgusting gas station bathroom I've ever been in.  I will personally be contacting the health dept. I believe that this establishment is a very serious health risk.  The one star was given for the very kind employees only."}
{"text":"DO NOT GO HERE, its a long wait and the food has no flavor, the only decent thing is the corn. Just a horrible place, it doesn't even deserve half a star."}
{"text":"Horrible!!! Let me start off my saying I was excited to see the location was open again. Myself and my husband decided to stop in. We both ordered the L7 8 piece shrimp and we both added a piece of fish. The shrimp was okay. No real issues. The fish was disgusting!!! It tasted like some sort of jerky. I asked for a fresher piece. That piece was nasty too!! The fries were cold. For $21 total this was a waste of money, time and effort . I will never go to another LJS. This location needs to just shut down."}
{"text":"Great service, Great food, Great prices.... I had stop eating Long John's Silver because the food and service had gotten horrible. However, being vegetarian, I don't eat meat. So I eat a lot of fish and this location, has made me love eating Long John's Silver again.... The manager and staff, seem to take pride in there over all service."}
{"text":"I've eaten here several times, The food is not great but it's not bad either a little greasy a little salty but not too bad.   My main complaint is cleanliness, I went there the other night there was a lot of food all over the floors on the tables when people would leave they would not wipe down the table or sweep the floor that very disgusting.  I'm thinking about not going back because of that reason I cannot eat my dinner and look at filth at the same time sorry."}
{"text":"The service is super slow and the oil they are using is old because you could taste it in the fish and fries. And it's too salty!!!"}
{"text":"First, this location is a dual KFC/LJS so you don't the full menu and you should count yourself lucky if you don't get food poisoning after eating.  What I got though was some fish that looked good but tasted odd, I can't place what the taste was other possibly some chemical added to the batter.  Hushpuppies and slaw was good, service wasn't bad either but when you got to a fish place (even a fast food fish place) you expect decent food."}
{"text":"I go to fast food places everyday of the week since I do not have kids. I must go to Long Johns twice a year...so this was Tue, 6:30pm, I go to their drive thru, and order a Cod and shrimp basket from the ad that was up on their board. They do not have it. So I try and order an L1, which consists of fish and shrimp. They inform me they do not have shrimp...kinda like going to burger king and they do not have burgers, or mcd and they cannot make me a number 1, big mac meal....i understand they might be out of cod, since it's their special, but the sign was up and it wasnt even that late...anyway, i wont be back. I should have read the other reviews before even wasting my time."}
{"text":"iI just visited the LJS restaurant in New Kensington on Nov. 8, 2012 after not having visited it in awhile and was hungry for the fish & hush puppies.  I could not get over how dirty the floor in the dining area was with paper and bits of garbage under almost all the tables.  It looks like it has't been swept in awhile.  There was a broom and dust pan leaning up against the pop machine & I was tempted to use it myself to sweep up.  I think it will sure be a long while before I visit that location again."}
{"text":"I generally am a patient person, and understand that mistakes happen and ultimately  fast food isn't the best profession in the world and asking for something special can be a bit hard to manage especially with many orders.... but damn this is the worst restaurant I've been to in my entire life!!!   It was nearly empty and we had placed orders simple substitutions; a basically plain burger and one item off of another burger. Not only did the person taking our order sigh at me when I wanted to make sure it didn't have cheese, she had  to talk to the cook each and every time we ordered an item to clarify to the chef. When we finally got our burgers they were kid sized (We've been to A&W's before and they were wayyy smaller), Both burgers were nearly plain except 1 item (Not how we ordered them),  they forgot our onion rings, and I was sighed at again when I asked for them. I'm not sure if it was out of spite or incompetence, but THEY MADE US ONLY FOUR ONION RINGS AND THEY WERE MADE WITH FISH BATTER! (My girlfriend's slightly allergic to fish, but these combo places usually have separate kitchens so we risked coming)  We were frankly insulted, but were practically afraid to make another complaint so we just stormed out and got food elsewhere at a place that had no problem making our order right, even with 10+ people in line....  I would never eat at this restaurant again even if the food was free. We paid $17 for probably the equivalent of a few dollar menu items elsewhere, and spent half an hour in an empty restaurant , and got faster ACCURATE service from a drive-thru elsewhere with 10+ cars....  It's a shame since there's so few A&W's and they are not a bad fast food joint usually, but if this is the quality of employee and restaurant I can easily see why there's so few in Las Vegas.."}
{"text":"Filthy as f*** really wanted ljs since they shut our location down drove to this one. It's in a nicer area, but maybe it's beneath their employees to clean? Also no long johns fries boo"}
{"text":"This is one of the worst fast food experiences we've ever had.  The layout is terrible (drive thru across a major exit for the plaza).  We almost got hit pulling in by someone flying around the corner.  Then it took almost a half an hour (after 8pm) to get our food.  The woman at the window (who appeared to be management) just reached out for our card as we pulled up.  No order confirmation or greeting.  She tossed us a bag with ALL of the LJS food we had ordered in a single box, then just told us to hold on for the Taco Bell food.  The LJS box was already cold, but we waited another 10 minutes for a few tacos.  While we waited, several workers were inside looking bored and what appeared to be the manager was chatting with the younger employees, and from that conversation she did not seem to have a clue how to manage the business.  They were worrying about inventory to last until this weekend's delivery instead of the current backlog of customer orders.  It was unorganized and VERY slow just to provide very questionable, cold food.  The smell both at the window and when we opened the box was disgusting. The trash can located just past the order box was overflowing.  It was not a pleasant experience and I would be surprised if I DON'T get sick after eating what I could of this meal.  LJS is not gourmet by any means, but it's also not the cheapest fast food.  I at least expected it to be hot. This location was not busy: maybe 5-6 cars waiting forever in the drive thru.  The parking spots were mostly open and the dining room looked almost empty.  If they weren't busy cooking, then what was the delay in the drive thru?  They all need job training and good management to whip this place into shape!"}
{"text":"Now I understand why long John silver's is facing out of las vegas.. no drive thru service at this location and no sense of urgency.. love this product but employees are not managing the restaurant right for people to enjoy a good piece of fish .."}
{"text":"Got two pieces of chicken in my two piece fish meal I ordered. :(  Where's the fish?"}
{"text":"Someone please change the cooking oil!! With the construction on Rt. 51, it has been a very long time since I decided to put up with the craziness that makes up this intersection. A nagging for fried fish however, sent my daughter, and me to this LJS. Mistake number 1 was ignoring the deserted parking lot. Mistake number 2, was placing an order at the drive thru, and eating our 2 piece fish and more dinners, after the smell of old cooking oil put a damper on our nagging for fried fish.  The service at the drive thru was friendly, the girl at the window friendly, but the smell of old cooking oil, not so much. Not a soul in sight at this LJS. Yes, there are other places to get great fried fish, and after our experience, perhaps it's time to let this LJS walk the plank off our list. The fish was edible, not the usual crunchy, crumbly LJS fish. The hush puppies were soggy from either drowning in old oil too long, or sitting under heat lamps too long. The fries, endured the same sad torture as the others. Cheap, yes, but not worth the money, or Rt. 51 traffic anymore."}
{"text":"We were in the area and thought we would give this place a look to see if things had changed. It is turned around 180 degrees. The tables were clean and looked much better. Could still improve some. As for ordering, we were waited on immediately and the food was ready in a reasonable time. If they keep it up i will raise my rating after the next time. Thank you keep it up please as we love Long John's"}
{"text":"Food was cold since wait in drive thru took way to long. Person at drive thru window was very rude upon taking our order and giving us our food. This location is crossed off my list. Drive thru is horrible it is better to go inside, but when your in a hurry you do not really have that option."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrendous service! Long line. Nobody was getting their food promptly.  A girl threw up after eating their food and the vomit stayed on the floor near blocking the women's bathrooms for over 20 minutes after the employees were made aware of it.  Absolutely disgusting! This place needs new management or This place should be shut down!!!"}
{"text":"Worst place ever.... Placed my order, I got a meal combo. After I paid the girls said that they were out of medium cups. So she gave me a small cup. I went to the soda fountain area to get a drink in my SMALL cup. The area was dirty. There was only one other customer in there. The tables were also dirty.  When they called me that my order was ready the girl asked if I would like any sauce. I asked for malt vinegar. Well surprise surprise they were out. Seems to be a problem at this Long Johns with running out of things.  I gave my order back & asked for a refund. I WILL NEVER STOP THERE AGAIN."}
{"text":"Food has always been tasty, good.   Going to miss Long John Silvers and A&W in Las Vegas. No more locations :(. They shut down a whole bunch of Long John Silver's across the country and no reason has been given.  Does anyone know why?    Always enjoyed going there. Shame that it has to go and will not longer be in Vegas."}
{"text":"Nasty nasty nasty!!! So salty I could literally not eat any of it! Not even the beans!"}
{"text":"Regular longjohns experience, nothing special. The place was real clean tho."}
{"text":"Tuesday nite, got hungry for fish. Drove thru Long Johns Silvers around 6:30 pm, ordered fish/shrimp platter expecting an ok fish platter. Got home, opened the platter up and WOW, I'm not kidding, this fish and shrimp w/hush puppies was great. Fish was nice and huge and so was the shrimp, I'm talking JUMBO SHRIMP!!!!  Instead of sauce packets I was given little sauce cup which I liked much better. Now normally I don't get this excited about a fast food place, but I enjoyed this meal so much I say \"GOOD JOB\" to the cook.   Keep it up Long Johns Silvers on Durango near Cheyenne"}
{"text":"Dirty, dirty and clueless. The only reason I am giving it one star is because the food was fine. Slow service, new people left on their own yelling for help. The floor looks like it hasn't been cleaned in a month. I will never return."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped for a late lunch today and will never eat at this restaurant again. We ordered our food and sat down in the dining room to wait for it to be brought to us. There were very few people in the restaurant and all had their food so we knew ours should not take long. After about 18-20 minutes our food was sat up in the pass through window by the cooks and just sat there. The cashier was in the lobby at that point emptying trash and there was no one else out front to bring us our food. As we sat we witnessed a female employee come from the kitchen with a paper towel or tissue in her hand. She BLEW AND WIPED HER NOSE and threw the tissue in the trash can under the counter and then immediately reached up and grabbed our plates of food with her dirty hands. She reached in and scooped cole slaw onto our plates contaminating the entire batch sitting there and proceeded to walk to our table with the contaminated food. We refused it and demanded a refund immediately asking to speak to the manager. The manager never came out and I left but not before getting the number of the district manager for Long John Slivers. I have contacted her and the health department with a complaint. Do not eat at this restaurant."}
{"text":"We are giving it a shot. We are hungry for fish and Pete's Fish and Chips is not open on Sunday. Weird that the building is 1/2 Taco Bell and 1/2 Long John Silvers. The menu is combined and everything comes out of the same kitchen. The fish, shrimp and hush puppies were okay but the fries were awful, limp & old. The main issue was the girl taking our order. No personality, she failed to smile or react in any way, unfamiliar with the menu and television specials being offered. The Customer Service experience was horrible. I'll not be going back."}
{"text":"Awful!! Rude costumer service. Half my order was wrong, when I asked for my shrimp the girl was rude and questioned me. Place was a mess- food was gross."}
{"text":"I was seriously considering giving this a 1 star rating, because I feel a two star rating is too generous. This is a Long John Silver / A&W multi branded restaurant. I am reviewing only the Long John Silver side of this business. Long John Silver's have been running a TV campaign promoting their Freshside Grille menu items. A friend from work and I decided to give it a try. I ordered the Grilled Pacific Salmon Platter and a medium drink and that came to $10.36. The Salmon portion was small, but I will admit, it tasted very good. The failure of this place came from the corn-on-the-cob that tasted like it had been boiled for 3 days and vegetables that were not warm. The soda fountain was a mess, and the tables were all dirty. We had to select the \"least dirty\" table to eat our meal. I don't recommend it place at all. There are plenty of fast food restaurants in the area and you don't need to settle for this."}
{"text":"Sometimes you just need some fish!!!!  When I have the craving for fish( in a timely manner) I go to Long John Silvers.  Not only is it good but you get allot of it."}
{"text":"Had a craving for LJS the other day.  It was really good.  Everything was fresh.  The place was crowded and very clean and the manager was walking around checking on customers.  I had almost given up on this place but if the food and service stays this good, I will be back more often."}
{"text":"I admit I am not a fan of fried foods, nor am I a fan of seafood, so the idea that I actually eat here every so often isn't smart on my part. However, the chicken is SO delicious! I mean, really really juicy and tasty. However, that is the ONLY good thing about this place. I am sure this place is painfully typical for a Long John Silver's, however, this is the only one I've ever been to and I've only come in twice a year- tops.   The whole place smell awful, it's clearly the smell of their vast vats of oil to fry everything they offer. Limited menu, and nothing healthy, even if they claim it is, don't play into their lies.  Over all, clean, nice service, but the food is sub-par."}
{"text":"I am only giving a star because I hae to in order for this to show up publicly.  For the second time in 1 month. I have gone to Long Johns twice. It seems like they can't get it together.   I went about a month ago. When I got there I tried to go through the drive through and there was a sign that said \"drive through is closed\". I went inside and and waited in line for 20 mins. Finally got to the front of the line to order. The restaurant was full of people waiting for their food. I ordered and waited too. I was there for about two hours total. Listening to the girl behind me order and ask for 5 breast and the girl told her they only have 3 breast right now. By the time she got her food they could have cooked more than enough for the whole restaurant.  The gorl at the counter said every order is to go because it's easier for them to remember. Sounds like lazy to me! Where is the OWNER? Your restaurant is going down hill.   I went in there todayto order and the same things.  There was a sign on the drive through that said KFC drive through only. I parked and started walking in. A young lady and young man were leaving. They had been waiting an hour. My mother in law was already in line. The lady left behind us. So I asked the lady waiting on her food how long have you been waiting she said she timed ot and it had been 45 mins. The girl is packing her order and I asked why we can't go through the drive through as LJ customers? She said she is not sure. I asked who came up with that them or corporate? She said I think the manager. I told my mother in law lets go.  That restaurant SUCKS!!"}
{"text":"This location is now closed! Hard to believe it took this long with how awful the service and food was."}
{"text":"Wow!!!  After not having eaten at a Long John Silvers for a long time, we decided to go. We went inside and had planned on eating there.   When we went in there were only two people inside. They appeared to be finishing up their meal.  We walked to the counter and stood there for several minutes. We could see one employee appearing to be working the drive-up window. Finally someone came to the counter.  There were actually three people behind the counter. But only one appeared to be doing anything.   We both placed orders for fish meals (L4 and two small drinks). The total came to $22.66. I paid with a credit card, somewhat surprised at how much a fast food bill for two basic meals had come to.   Anyway, the bill was paid and we waited for the food to be prepared and served.  On a side note, after I had paid, another couple came in and the lady ordered a fish sandwich. She was told it was $10.58. She asked the clerk how much again and was told the same thing. The lady's response indicated she was not happy and was actually surprised with what a LJS fish sandwich was going for. It seemed pretty high to me as well.  Apparently LJS is trying to get ahead of that $15 an hour disaster before it actually takes effect (will never happen though because a fast food, inexperienced, unskilled, employee is not worth this type of wage, especially here at this LJS).  The lady opted for a lesser priced item. I don't blame her.   After about five minutes, our tray of food was placed on the counter. We had already discussed getting the tartar sauce and vinegar for the fish. We looked through the restaurant for the dispensers and could not find any, so I asked the counter-person for the items. To my astonishment, she told me they didn't have any tartar sauce!!!  Are you kidding me?!!!   No tartar sauce at a fish restaurant??!!!  I could not believe it.   At that point I told the clerk, if they didn't have tartar sauce, I would just prefer to get my money back. She started yelling something in Spanish to another person walking around the back of the restaurant.    I was actually hoping they would find the tartar sauce and I would eat the food that was still on the counter. No such luck. The clerk finally came from the drive-up window area and handed me $20.51. What a waste of food.   Wait a second,  I paid $22.66. Was the difference a fine for not accepting my meal and going on my way?  Not going to happen. I told the clerk how much I paid and she went back and got the rest.  I got the refund back in cash and soon left the restaurant.   So, LJS, is this what you have come to?  Based on the numerous other bad Yelp reviews it would appear there are some serious issues with this location. It could be those stellar (not) employees you have filled this restaurant with (according to other reviews), or it could be they know they may be about to lose that job they so think $15 an hour will solve all of their problems with. It's time to get real LJS. You are drowning in the sea of restaurants that dot every corner of this neighborhood.   I will not be back."}
{"text":"We felt like fish and chips for lunch. So went to long johns Big mistake sorry to say. Very disappointed. It used to be very good before. Now i realize why they are all closing."}
{"text":"This has been a terrible experience. I waited in line in the drive through only to find out that they do not allow you to order it through the drive through anymore. They force you to go inside and order it instead. Wasted my time and the drive. The least they can do is post somewhere before you enter the line so you don't get stuck waiting."}
{"text":"It wasn't super terrible, it really wasn't, but I probably wouldn't return.    I've had much better fish and chips elsewhere for $6-7.  I'd rather eat the fish and chips or fish sandwich at Jack-in-the-Box or Burger King.    Everything here was super salty and the fountain drinks were limited to diet-this and diet-that.  Yuck.  My meal was edible but it took a lot of strength to actually keep it down."}
{"text":"Drove all the way down here for some long Johns so about a 15-20 min drive from my apartment. Ordered and the food was not tasty at all! I come here and it use to be good but that night they food taste like the oil was not changed in weeks. My mother and i had the chicken and fish and it was gross and definitely turned us off to the food. We got a refund and the manager apologized and offered us Taco Bell but at the point we couldn't get the taste of old oil out of our mouths so we just went to McDonald's sad and went home."}
{"text":"Love coming to this place. The workers are nice and the food takes awhile but it's fresh and hot! So no complaining here. They bring you your food which is good instead of getting mixed up in line. Definitely ringing the bell for service when I leave!"}
{"text":"Clean place, food was not good at all.  Ordered 3 Plates, Fries-Fish & Hush Puppies where old and cold on all 3 plates. NEVER coming here again."}
{"text":"Too dirty for dining in. Feel like nobody ever clean up this place. Only good for drive through( drive through is only for kfc). The long john silvers's menu is overpriced. Overall not worth a try."}
{"text":"Second time I've been here on my lunch and both times the team has failed miserably on this occasion I've tried to give this location a second chance man boy was I wrong not only am I left hungry still I paid for a meal that only came with two piece of fish an 2 hush puppies I don't even eat coleslaw at that so now I have to sit hungry at work and these fast food people want 15 dollars an hour you gotta be kidding me can't even put the right box in the right bag I am highly upset because I had an issue here before and now I feel that it's personal I will be writing corporate about this issue as far as whoever the manager is has poor management skills and it shows with there work ethic just make sure you double check your food before leaving this place!"}
{"text":"The staff seemed really busy for lunch. We waited about ten minutes to get our lunch. It looked like they didn't have enough people in the back cooking. But they had three cashiers for some reason. Everyone else was waiting an extended amount of time to get their food.  The food's good....its typical for LJS. We didn't get any of the A&W food except for the root beer, which was great. There's coupons in the paper about once a month, I suggest nabbing these as the food is a bit more expensive than other fast food. It is what it is, tasty fried fish and stuff.  Our daughter got a little kiddy meal. The toy was pretty crappy, which is the only reason why you buy the kiddy meal. Also, you have to get fries as a side dish, they don't have any sort of healthier option. Good thing she likes tasty fried fish and stuff."}
{"text":"First off, very clean restaurant ... But long wait time as they are preparing the food fresh can be annoying... Visited twice last weekend, and waited 30 minutes on 2 burgers and 2 shakes!!! At least the staff was friendly enough and refunded the whole amount."}
{"text":"The food at this location is not the best. My potato wedges were greasy as an old tire and the place smelled like trash. My wife had to take her order back because they mixed her food up with someone else's order. It seems like this place is a hit or miss."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE! The store is totally staffed by teenagers who hate their job.Sassy comments, eye rolling and attitude.  I ordered a meal and the cole slaw was actually slimey indicating that it hadn't been changed (or sold!) The manager replaced it but offered nothing in the way of compensation.  I aslo always have to wait so long that I automatically turn the car off.  It's the only one in my area, so i struggle through it, but ugh!"}
{"text":"Save your time and money and fry your fish at home or make a sandwich.  This is not the solution to you hunger pains I promise you."}
{"text":"Started the experience walking in and being told by the cashier that they were out of the onion rings as a side option.  Whatever; I ordered my L1 combo: 2fish/6shrimp.  Proceed over to get my beverage.  The condiment stand was filthy, the cocktail sauce pump and napkin dispensers were removed, leaving large holes.  The soda machine was out of diet root beer.  This is an A&W/mixed use venue...root beer is their trademark!  It was orange coming out and tasted like the orange soda.  I informed the cashier as he was handing me my order.  He said \"no, it's just out\".  So since I absolutely hate and cringe over diet Pepsi (the worst flavor in the world) I asked for some sweet & low packets for some fresh brewed iced tea...even pointing at the tea urns on the front counter.  He returns with Sweet & Sour packets.  I had to explain that I wanted the small pink paper packets of sugar-free sugar to sweeten up iced tea.  He responded with \"OH, yeah, sorry, we're out of that too\".  Upon seating at my table I noticed that my plate only had 1 piece of fish and the 6 shrimp.  Honestly, at this point I didn't even go back up since the math of counting up to 2 must be eluding them.  This was just a terrible visit.  I have been here several times before...never had a \"great\" visit...they are either mediocre or something such as this (this is my 3rd terrible encounter)."}
{"text":"I haven't been to a Long John's for years. I had a coupon and a fish craving so I went through the drive through for lunch. I ordered the fish and more with corn instead of fried. The fish is really quite good. The corn sticks to your teeth and is chewy. The cole slaw is cold and crunch and good. Not the best but not the worst either. Hush puppies are Hush puppies whatever they are.   This meal is neither fantastic nor awful. But it is expensive. I really like BW3's buffalitto lunch special and I can get that for 5.99 where as this average meal is 6.99. Glad I had a coupon but that still make it's 5.99.   I'm also thinking this deep fried fish isn't very good for me as I wipe the grease dripping from my mouth!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here 3 times in the last 2 months and each experience has been about the same. I went about 6;30 pm so they usually have 2 or 3 people in line when I get there but each time has been quick and the food was hot. I would recommend it for what it is."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a quick bite.  Went to the drive thu and was told it's only for the Taco Bell side of the menu.  So I went inside ordered to go.  Girl said it would be 10-15 min after I paid.   So much for a guide bite.  At least it's fresh I guess right?"}
{"text":"First time I've ever been disappointed with a long John silvers. The employees are rude and it took forever for the food. The food was also not as good as other locations. The worst part some kind of slime came out of a malt vinegar packet. Really really gross"}
{"text":"Your typical Long John Silvers, except I would say we received exceptional service at this one. :)"}
{"text":"There aren't many of the original Long John Silver's left. Many of the newer ones are incorporated with Taco Bell and don't offer the full menu. This one does, which is one reason to come here over others.  This location is clean, counter people are courteous. Food is delivered hot. The food is fried and super salty, but it delivers the same Long John Silver's flavor you remember from years ago.   They also offer broiled healthier options at the ones that have a full menu. They have broiled fish or shrimp, rice, green beans, salads, and corn along with all the old favorites."}
{"text":"Employees are horrible and their attitudes stink . The floor and tables were all dirty ,  such a waste of time I am completely disgusted by this experience"}
{"text":"I haven't gone to a Long John Silvers in 7 years, so I decided to go just for memory sake.  I was sincerely surprised when the manager greeted me twice.  Both him and his cashier were extremely friendly.  I drove home smiling the entire way, pleased with their sincerity."}
{"text":"Ordered the cheese curds ($2) and the five piece dipping fish strips ($3) and somehow got a total of $7 with no explanation- and, after a ten minute wait during 5:00 rush, NO SAUCES with my order.  That's right: no ketchup, no tartar sauce, nothing.  All of this while the manager was standing by the register watching his staff working and chatting with them, but obviously not helping or correcting their mistakes.  Ate the curds and hated myself for it- they were super greasy and half of them were more crunch than cheese. Tried to eat a strip without any dipping sauces (seriously, how did NO ONE in the kitchen notice this?!), and gave up, tossing the order.  Never again. Grab chicken strips next door at Cain's, they have their act together even at midnight. And their sauce is delish."}
{"text":"I arrived at 1:20 PM and I could not find a clean area to eat. Someone really needs to clean the dining room it is dirty and grease."}
{"text":"Waited in their filthy dining area for 20 minutes for my food. Had to clean a table for myself and wipe crumbs off seat. Register clerk was super friendly and helpful. When I got my food my order was wrong. I accidentally threw my cheese curds away. Friendly clerk was heading on break when I asked if I could get replacement and he said sure, ask [another employee]. She denied me saying it would take out of their cost. I work in customer service. I'd take the three dollar loss just to make an already frustrated customer happy so they'll return again. I went to my car for a pen and paper to write down store number. I asked Friendly clerk for store number and the other employee that denied me shouted out \"It's on your receipt MA'AM\". Very rude. Previous experiences were not great either. I'll never return."}
{"text":"We love Long John Silver's can't believe they're gone but this one horrible customer service.  trash everywhere no tartar sauce .no ketchup .our meal was shorted chicken. customer service sucked but I love the fish. How is this place open.."}
{"text":"This is what you get for $7 bucks?! One shriveled up piece of chicken and fish, 12 French fries and two hush puppies. Wow I have better luck in the casinos. What a rip off! Never will return."}
{"text":"My husband and I just stooped in real quick to pick up some fish to go.  12-26-10 at 1:30 PM after some after Christmas shopping. The young lady did not add any condiments to our to go bag and when I asked she was rude to me. My husband now refuses to go back again."}
{"text":"On my way back to the office and needed a quick bite.  The hushpuppies were calling to me so I gave in ordered the 2-piece chicken.  Don't judge me for ordering chicken at a fried fish joint.  It's actually pretty good (juicy chicken with a crunchy batter that's not greasy).  I wish they'd spruce up a bit so it doesn't look so sad.  A solid three stars for consistency in their food and good, friendly customer service."}
{"text":"Lobby was decent, but when I walked in there was no one.  I ordered and was told there was no corn. I heard another customer ask for honey and they were told they didn't have any. There were no napkins in the lobby either. The condiment area was a mess. Shortly after, quite a few customers came in and as I ate my meal, I just watched the chaos.  Very poorly managed and bad service.  No wonder the low rating here. Won't return here that's for sure."}
{"text":"I've had eaten here numerous times..and tonight's was my last. I thought I could taste that the fish wasn't fresh as it tasted a bit bad. Right now I think I have food poisoning..bad nausea and vomiting. My dad got sick the last time he ate here too. Don't eat here."}
{"text":"No Long John Silver in the drive thru.   We went inside, we had to wipe down the seat and table. Received food, fries were cold. We trashed it and walked out. This place is a waste of time and the staff is lazy."}
{"text":"STAY AWAY! Wish I could give this place ZERO stars. They have the worst customer service and it's filthy! Ordered two meals from the Long John Silver menu. The cashier didnt have the courtesy to let us know that the meals we ordered didn't come with drinks. So after she disappered to the back for over 5 mins my husband stands back in line with a gentlemen thats already been waiting to place his order. Upon getting our food they gave us ONE tarter sauce packet... Really? We both ordered fish, my husband asks if he could have more while looking at the manager and she just smiles. The place had food on the floor and on the seats of the booths, the trays that they serve the food on looked as if they haven't been cleaned in weeks. Wish I read the reviews before we decided to go here."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Really reasonable cost and very fast service. The amount of oil is incredibly less for the amount of deep fried stuff they serve. The taste of the chicken, fish and the shrimp was really good. Even the hush puppies and cole slaw was one of the better dishes I've eaten when compared to other places. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Stopped there for fish since its Lent and its fairly close to my neighborhood.  The older folks in front of me could not hear the cashier and she had to repeat everything three or four times.  She needs to speak up so they can hear her.  Very busy, one cashier, not two.  Restaurant - tables, floor - very dirty as everyone was in back getting orders ready. It seems to be that way whenever I stop in that location.  Side dishes size would work well for toddlers, not adults.  Very small side so if you get their wonderful cole slaw, order two or three."}
{"text":"my food was fresh and fine.  Better than that I found a good positive staff of people which are difficult to find in other places and they made my bad day better."}
{"text":"I was getting out of work late, and I hate to be \"that\" person who is always at the store, or the restaruant when they are about to close.  I got there about 915/920, and the lobby is only open til 930, with the drive thru closing at ten. The girl who took my order through the speaker was kind, and patient.  It did take a good 8 minutes to get my food, but I understand that there are closing procedures that needed to be done. When I ordered, I asked for all the sauces, which I did end up getting....without asking again.  The hushpuppies were a little too done. But everything else was fine."}
{"text":"You have to have a taste and love of seafood, and this chain does it best when you have a craving for fried, breaded cod or haddock. The malt vinegar, tartar and Louisiana hot sauce make it even better with a side of chip fries and hush puppies and sides like Cole slaw.  Their chicken strips, fried shrimp, and baked fish and salmon are also great.  I avoid Fridays here because of the massive crowds."}
{"text":"Location did not accept LJS coupons from their own LJS website ... Every other location I have ever been to does accept them.  This location must be so special ( :) ) that I will most likely never go there again ..."}
{"text":"I just moved here from Tucson and we are ALL out of LJS there so I HAD to come in for my lunch. I got my usual (the 2 piece chicken, fries and drink combo) and didn't wait very long. The staff were polite and the restaurant is very clean. There weren't any crunchies in my basket, sadly, but I figured it was because if there WERE I'm positive some health nut would be complaining about it. Everything tasted fine, the chicken could've been in there a bit longer but overall, I had no issues. Thanks for my fix!"}
{"text":"The sewer smell can make you lose your appetite but the food and people are great. I came first thing they open and where I am sitting my daughter saw a cock roach and the flour was not swept from the night before. It's a great location but it looks like night crew are not cleaning up to well."}
{"text":"What are the chances of getting my money back?  I wanted to try your restaurant out for the first time. I had the 2 fish, 6 shrimp platter with rice. And the lobster bites. The lobster bites, fish, and shrimp were bland and greasy.  My fingers were literary greasy after picking up the food. The rice had zero flavor. The hush puppies were the most disgusting thing I've ever put in my mouth. Whatever fake butter that is used is horrible. It tasted like they were soaked in butter and then fried. The tarter sauce is sweet and the cocktail sauce has no kick to it. About 10 min after I had a few bites of each thing I literally vomited from all the grease and fake butter. I'm not sure why anyone would actually continue to eat this food. I would love to get my hard earned money back!"}
{"text":"This place is awful. The food was too greasy and it gave me an upset stomach immediately after. I was dissatisfied with my choice as it was disappointing. I will never go to a long johns silver again, it was my first time there and I was not pleased at all.  The tables were dirty and the staff seemed lazy and bothered when we asked questions, the food didn't even look appetizing to begin with.  If I could give 0 stars I would."}
{"text":"Good food, nothing spectacular.  Prices are a bit high compared to other fast food.  You sort of need to be in the mood for this place.  I do feel like the burgers have more of a home cooked taste than the other fast food joints.  This specific A&W also has a Long John Silvers so it's good for those that want either A&W or LJ's.  The service was a bit slow.  Took longer to get my food than most places and I also thought the hamburger meat was slightly salty this time around.  I have eaten here several times though and it's normally salty like this from my experience."}
{"text":"I am kind to all service workers! always! This place has the worst service I have ever seen. I do not expect four star treatment from fast food but this place is ridiculous. You better check your bag because they are going to forget something. Yesterday my husband went to get a quickie family fish dinner. He was told that no sorry we are out of hushpuppies and Pepsi. Okay thats fine but what can we have to replace the hushpuppies? He was told to go down the street there is a store. This is inside, not the drive thru. It seems that this is a common experience at this restaurant. I already sparingly frequent fast food establishments but this will definitely be the last attempt. And yes I have contacted the corp. I dont want anything from them though, they can keep it."}
{"text":"If only the food looked as good served as in the photos. My wife wanted some fish and hadn't been to LJS in years. Well the order was wrong, probably my mistake for not checking the receipt after I paid for it. The fish came out soaked in grease. Tasted bad, not much fish, mostly grease soaked crust. How can you serve food like this. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Go to this LJS versus the gross one by the airport.   The staff is sweet and friendly & the inside is calm & clean."}
{"text":"POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE, VERY DIRTY LOCATION, a ton of staff in the back but all tables were really dirty in the dining area. The soda and utensil stations were dirty and very sloppy. I placed an order for two combos and only got one. The lady at the cash register didn't take our order correctly. Her mistake but we were left with only one meal and they didn't even apologize. it was my first time trying Long John's and I WILL NOT EAT HERE AGAIN plus they didn't even have tarter sauce."}
{"text":"Always have had good food here! They never seem to be busy. However going through the drive through will take about 10 minutes because they freshly fry your order."}
{"text":"I don't like to rant and rave about bad experiences. It is hard to be calm and understanding when it takes 20+ minutes to get your food at a fast food establishment. It is also not comforting when you ask for your money back and the general manager doesn't apologize or ask for a reason why I wanted my money back. I understand it is fast food but a little pride and professionalism goes a long way no matter what your job is."}
{"text":"I went at 4pm on a Friday afternoon, used the drive thru.  The employee was very nice, but the service not so much.  However she did offer me a water while I wait. I was asked to pull over and wait on the fish.  I waited at least  5 minutes, maybe a little more.  Then when I got home I found only 1 slaw instead of 2. The food was really greasy, more so than usual for a fried item. Don't think I'll be going back."}
{"text":"I have had my last visit here. The service is Sloooow! The staff moves like a snail and never a smile. The place looks old and rundown. The area manager begged me to give the restaurant one more chance because he said things would improve. NO IMPROVEMENT AT ALL. The last place on Earth I would ever visit again!"}
{"text":"Horrible service, items that were paid for were forgotten, over charged for drinks that were included in meal. Cashier was handling money and food with no gloves. Just a horrible experience all together."}
{"text":"The place is very clean. Service was fast. They need to upgrade their type of fries."}
{"text":"The service was poor.  The employees were too busy visiting to wait on me.  When my food was ready, I wasn't asked whether or not I would like to have condiments with my to go order.  When I asked for them, the employee acted as if it was an inconvenience. I couldn't finish my dinner as the fish batter wasn't completely cooked.  This is the second time I've had problems with the quality of food and service at this LJS.  I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Crazy long wait in the drive through. After 30 minutes was told no biscuits. They could have made some in that time. Please shut this place down or fire the ignorant people and start over."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and i just went here (yes, Jerome and I are still together. I can't believe it, either. I must really love him). oh yeah, my review:  1. they were out of chicken pieces  2. they were out of cheese-curd sides  3. they were out of Mountain Dew  4. they never refilled the tartar sauce container  5. the booths and tables were dirty  6. no napkins anywhere in sight - had to ask for some at the counter  7. they took too long getting our order  8. WE DIDN'T RING THE BELL WHEN WE LEFT  whew ! that was painful. so long, until next time. now i want something sweet. i wonder if i should ask if they have any pies or cakes..... naaaaaawwww.........."}
{"text":"I'm not a kfc fan -I only came here because I'm a fan of Long John Silvers. I ordered a 2piece fish meal (basically the first combo on the LJS side).  Not like other LJS (i wanted cheese-sticks, with hushpuppies(only reason why I came here), and corn on the cob. This LJS express didn't have cheese-sticks or corn on the cob.  Basically it was to much food and the potato wedges were nasty."}
{"text":"last minute dinner  I was desperate on my home from Brunswick..  Fish hush puppies and shrimp... My husband was thrilled.. It took me 45 minutes to get home and the food was wonderful.. We could only say imagine how good it would have been at the restaurant. They have great onion rings and the beans were just the way my husband likes them  cooked.. Cod was excellent .. I now it is fried but I will try the baked cod next time.."}
{"text":"Well I have not been here i can say in a good 20 + years! And by the looks of the interior is been longer then that since any works been done inside. Its filthy and beat up. Now for the food  I will start with it is nothing like comparing it to the LJS of the 70's & 80's by far. Got home (4 minutes away) the fries were old and ice cold, the shrimp was so greasy you could squeeze the grease from the breading let alone the shrimp was smaller then a mini shrimp in one inch or horrible batter and then there was the \"fish \" it was thinner then the french fries and I have never ever in my life had a piece of fish you could not bite or pull apart this \"fish\" was like grizzle on a bad steak.. How do they stay open and secondly how do they get away with serving such poor quality food, Wow eaters beware....."}
{"text":"Yeah I get my fried fast food fish fix (5Fs!) here whenever I'm in town and around here.  Living in SF you don't get enough junky fast food and LJS definitely hits the spot - always get tons of tartar sauce - oh yeah!"}
{"text":"This might be the scariest long john silvers on the planet. Its right next to a sleezy check cashing place, so there are a ton of interesting people in the parking lot. The manager was super cool and hooked us up with a bunch of hats for our pirate party."}
{"text":"Hm this LJS is pretty damn ghetto.  Not super clean but not really dirty.  But then you're getting fast food so what can you really expect?  Was a guilty pleasure - although more guilty than pleasure"}
{"text":"long wait time.  crowded.. with lots of angry people  no french fries for the meals.  wut?  The coleslaw is pretty dry.. green beans bland.. The hushpuppies were too moist/not cooked all the way.  The fish was ok though!"}
{"text":"Was visiting Vegas and had a craving . Didn't care for this long jon silvers not being available thru the drive thru because CA they do it thru the drive thru anyway I digress. Other than that the wait was a lil long and the guy that took my order wasn't the friendliest. But,the guy that gave me my order was friendly and the food was on point fresh"}
{"text":"I love LJS and have to agree, service was decent here. I tried a piece of my kid's chicken (I only ever get the fish for myself) and was pleasantly surprised to find white breast meat (same chicken texture as chick fil a). A little grimy dining room, and the bathroom handle is broken 8/2015... It would be nice if they made it an A&W-LJS but as-is still works for me."}
{"text":"So I can't give a fast food place a 5 star, but I wanted to make note of how impressed I was with the gal behind the counter.  There was a couple in front of me for whom English was probably not their primary language.  They were using a phone to help decipher the menu and I have to say she was very patient and helpful.  She made sure they knew exactly what they were getting, helped them make the selections that would get them the right food and helped them put in a to go order along with their eat in. The restaurant should be very proud of her.  I did not catch her name, but in case the management reads this it was Monday the 25th around 445 in the afternoon and the employee was an African American gal with a very long braid in the back of her hair.  Job well done!"}
{"text":"How is this place still open.  The only thing to order at long john silvers at this location is the KFC that it's connected to.  The food is on the edge of bad and horrible.  The fish is flat, dry and over cooked.  The hush puppies are hard and the shrimp tastes fishy and not in a good way.  All the vinegar and tartar sauce in the world can't fix the mess this place has made with it's food.  Zero stars from me!!!"}
{"text":"Fish was fresh and just like I like it. I thought the french fries were very tasty. Excellent customer service too. And you can't beat the sales are having right now for $1.99 one piece of fish and french fries."}
{"text":"Great service!!!!! She wouldnt even serve us fries because they werent fresh so she had cook make fresh ones!!! Love this place.... On our receipt it says Jenna...."}
{"text":"Typical Long John Silver's fried chicken and seafood, but since it's attached to A&W, you can also get some root beer while you're here. Everything is fried in the LJS batter including the onion rings, which made them a little too salty for my taste. Service is fast here and my order was ready before I could finish filling up my drink. Only real downside was that a hobo walked in while I was there, asked for a drink cup and sat down mumbling to himself and sleeping at a booth...not sure why this was tolerated by the staff or allowed."}
{"text":"I have had the unfortunate experience of eating at this location twice now. It's a combination TACO BELL/LONG JOHNS/PIZZA HUT.  The LJ'S portion really blows. Both times I have eaten here the fries were limp and undercooked, and the chicken planks they are famous for, were lackluster to say the least, not cruchy, and almost underdone. And NO CRUNCHIES from the batter were anywhere to be found! The hushpuppies were also underdone. I managed to eat one chicken plank, a few fries, and one hushpuppy, before throwing the rest of my food away.  The first time I ate there I credited the bad food to just an off night, but (3) months later nothing has changed. Seems like the only decent LJ'S in the valley is the one in Tempe on Southern & McClintock.  Don't EVEN waste your time or money on this place."}
{"text":"This has to be the weirdest LJS location ever. First of all it's combined with a KFC and do not have their own sides...any sides you order with your LJS meal will be from KFC. Also they sometimes run out of hush puppies and will automatically substitute for potato wedges (from KFC obviously).   The dining room is also always pretty dirty and gross, and they always forget to include forks and napkins with your order so you have to get up and go ask them for it.  Don't come here very often but we do sometimes get random cravings for LJS chicken planks and this is the only known location to me since all the others seemingly closed down years ago. Luckily our cravings are few and far between so that we don't have to come here but a handful of times a year. Not recommended unless you have a craving or enjoy KFC"}
{"text":"Doesn't taste quite as good as just the one on bell. I found out the one that is not connected with Taco Bell taste better.   But if you are debating if you want fish or tacos it's a good place to go because they have both.   Love how they still have the bell to ring for service.   They do have a drive thru.   Sign up for deals to be emailed to you."}
{"text":"This Long John Silver's is the best. It also tastes better then the combined ones with Taco Bell. This one also reminds me of my hometown one in Chicago. If you sign up with your phone number & visit 5 times you get $5 off your next order. Also they have awesome deals if you sign up through email."}
{"text":"Certainly not as the other reviews stated. Went in for fish and fries. Ordered my food promptly,  to very friendly and competent employee. She said about 6 minutes as they would make fresh food. Very clean except bathroom could use a little work. 8 minutes later order was complete and being bagged. Big fan of LJS, plus picked up root beer from AW for floats later."}
{"text":"The service here can be hit-or-miss, but more often than not, I don't have problems. Usually, when my friend and I stop by, we're waited on by the same server, and our food comes up relatively quickly. It's always fresh, too. Unfortunately, when they get busy, it creates problems because they don't have a stock of anything prepared, which in turn creates delays. Their cashiers have a habit of walking away from the counter in the evening, leaving customers waiting for however long it takes them to notice someone is standing there. While I understand that they have to clean up the restaurant for closing, there should always be someone to watch the counter.  As a side note, their drive-thru speaker went down about a month ago and still hasn't been repaired. It creates delays at the drive-thru window for placing orders, especially later in the evening due to above mentioned cashier habits."}
{"text":"What can I say, tasty fast food and a meals for 2 left 3 of us with leftovers.  Blows Popeyes in the dust!  I've always loved Silvers but after moving 8 years ago, there are none close.    The fish, shrimp and chicken were perfectly battered and cooked.  The fish did have a small piece of fat on the last bite I couldn't chew through, but nothing like you'd find on a whole breast like at KFC.    The help... well they were tremendously friendly! Not the \"order and get out of my face\" you usually see with fast food. Infact they came to our table twice and asked if we were alright and needed anything.  Much like a real restaurant.  I wish it were closer to my house!"}
{"text":"Its Greasy, Good and cheap. The fish and Chicken taste like the fries and the hush-puppies, so yeah its all good all the time."}
{"text":"ATROCIOUS!!!Long John Silvers as a company should be absolutely ashamed. Total disgrace all the way around."}
{"text":"Well it is a LJS and a Taco Bell combined.  Went as my elderly mom wanted the fried shrimp. We took the order to go. The young man at the counter went and opened the door for my mom. That was really nice of him. Overall it is a LJS, place was clean."}
{"text":"Service is super slow. Drive thru averaged 25 minutes both times with only two cars in line. Avoid"}
{"text":"During recent visits to Long John Silvers A&W on Windmill, I have experienced a greater attention to customer service. A few visits ago, I felt it necessary to call the manager about a visit. The manager did a great job over the phone and offered complimentary sundaes on a future visit. Thankfully, on a subsequent visit, the speed at which my food arrived was much faster. My last visit, a few days ago, at the time of the review, was both fast and the food tasted fresh. I like the 50's and 60's music and decor inside. If you are a T-Mobile customer, the cell signal is amazing at this location. I hope my next visit will be as good."}
{"text":"I used to be a hard core Long John Silver, not so much now  since they changed their batter, but I still stop there once in a while. Last night we went out to run some errands and so some shopping, found ourselves by LJS on 18th Ave and Bell Rd. In the old days, this used to be a great location. Here's our experience last night.  We went in and no one was in siggt6, we waited I would say about 4-5 mins. We were calling \"hello...hello\" nothing. We could hear them yapping in the back. Some guy was cleaning the bathroom heard us and went and told them that we were there. We order our food and sit, they bring it out, and a few mins the food comes out. We start to eat and we all look at each other. Out food was cold. All 3 meals, including the fries and hush puppies. My son took all the food up to the counter and told the, I believe it was a manager, that the food is cold. She said that they serve it at 145°. He told her to touch it. She did and said \"OH\". Now by then it was getting late, after 7:30 and we needed to get going, we have a child that needs to go to school the next morning, they did offer to cook us fresh food but that would have been another 15 mins. So we got our money back and left. What a let down night that was. We do not have a location near us so we were excited to eat there. For a fast food place LJS has or I should say had decent food, it's a shame to see it go down hill. They have already closed over 800 locations. If they do not pay attention to what is going on, bring back the quality of good they had and their good batter that made them succeed in the first place, they won't be around much longer."}
{"text":"I only come here for ice cream (polar freezes) be prepared to wait, they cook to order so 10-20 minutes depending on your order.  Love this place, the employees are always polite and the food is always fresh!   I wish they'd do more with chasing off the punks from their drive thru lane, I really HATE summertime here and all the tweens and teens roaming around drive thru lanes."}
{"text":"Waited 30 minutes for my \"fast food\" when I did get it my hush puppies and fries were soggy."}
{"text":"Worst LJS we've ever visited. The guy at the window (customer service) was great I must say. We didn't get everything we ordered, and what we did get the Chicken and Fish were way over cooked and tasted like yesterday's left overs,  lucky if you got a full small hand full of fries which were also nasty!!! We live a good 20 minutes away from this location, which unfortunately is the closest to us...we'll never go back again!!! It's in with a Taco Bell...hope the Taco Bell is better than the Long John Silver's..."}
{"text":"quick service and hot food. they only offer kfc sides but luckily kfc sides are good so it wasnt a problem. You can only order inside the restaurant and it would have been nice if there had been some sign on the outside of the restaurant to indicate that before i got stuck in the drive through behind cars but the quality of the food and the customer service made up for it."}
{"text":"I always like LJS' food and last night we wanted fish and chicken.  So we went to this location and got two family packs of food -- one fish and one chicken.  Service was friendly, fast, and efficient.  Food was great too; and I could tell the frying oil was fresh too!  They changed the recipe for the hush puppies and I think they are way better than before, but their cole slaw is still subpar IMO.  The cole slaw dressing is weak and rather tasteless and the veggies are chopped such they look like lawnmower clippings.  But other than this, we loved the food and will be back."}
{"text":"I know it's not fancy, but I enjoy Long John Silver and A&W burgers. I get the fish and chicken platter from LJS and the bacon cheddar burger from A&W. I definately am addicted to the A&W root beer from the draft."}
{"text":"It's a KFC and Long John Silver! So the food is five star at it's best fish and fries hot and crunchy! I give it 4 stars because the pictures inside before you order are misleading they showcase regular fries but give you wedges instead. I didn't care for the trick-o-ree that they pulled but over all it was good. They need to update they pictures and then they will get that last star from me. Don't tell me I can buy a yacht but then I pay in full and once you have my money you then give me a sailboat."}
{"text":"I was driving aimlessly through Gilbert last evening and found this place by accident. I was so glad I did!  A while back, PepsiCo's former restaurant (Yum Brands) group thought they needed a fish and hot dog place to round out their lineup.  Well that didn't turnout very well, so they sold A&W and Long John Silver's and moved on, or so I thought.   Seems this location didn't get the memo from the home office. As I noted above, I was happy to find something different than the same old, same old. Please excuse my idiom. LOL  Long John Silver's makes some really good seafood. Its not Joe's Crab Shack, or Red Lobster, but it's still pretty good.  Though the best, by far and away at fast food seafood, is still Ivar's in Seattle. Great stuff and I would go out of my way for some of their Cod anytime. But we digress.   Last night I had some chicken here which was outstanding. A little salty, so they must of learned that from The Colonel. LOL. But very tasty. And, the hush puppies were also good, as was their fish and the fries.  A combo meal of two pieces of chicken, two hush puppies, fries and drink ran $5.38, which has to be a great value. The also sell individual pieces of chicken or fish for $1.79, or three pieces of shrimp. See menu board photo.   So Three and Half Stars, and A Okay, bordering on Four!  Sorry, I have a rule about giving four stars to fast food places. But, shhhh!  Yes, I'm a fan.    Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Last night we felt like fish and chicken again and I have always liked LJS' food.  But not this location -- my previous review expresses my sentiment about this location, and if you look at others' recent reviews, you can see where others agree with me.  But this update is being written because I went all the way to the Power Road location since I did want LJS fish and chicken.  I printed out two Corporate coupons from the LJS website and took them with me.  The Power Rd location let me use them and when I asked why the Market Street location would not let me used them previously, I was told that maybe that franchisee didn't want to allow the discounts.  So this confirms my suspicion about this place.  BTW, the service was good and efficient, and so was the food at the Power Road location.  The food was perfectly fried and the frying oil was fresh because I can taste it if the oil is old.  So I was a happy camper."}
{"text":"Dirty, mismanaged. People behind counter can't seem to keep the simplest order straight."}
{"text":"Visited today. (and many times previous) I have always been waited on by very nice people. Tonight I ordered for a group and got (from A&W side) PapaBurgers and Hotdogs, fries, onion rings,and got hushpuppies and stuff from LJS side, everything was perfect and great.  I don't understand the other reviews of this place....I'm really sensitive to customer service/wait issues/ order accuracy.......and I have NEVER had an issue here......they always seem really nice......and I know it isn't 'gourmet fish', but it's good and I like the chicken too.....I really like this place......my cashier today was Ebone.......and was very very very courteous as they always are.....got my HUGE order fast and everything was perfect."}
{"text":"The fish is decent but the inside is very dirty and disgusting. When you come go drive thru and eat in the car it will be much better due to how dirty the place is. I will never eat inside again. Drive thru is the way to go."}
{"text":"Was craving \"hush puppies and shrimp\" so talked my friend, who was driving, into making a quick stop via the drive-thru window.  Both the shrimp and the hush puppies were much too greasy.    I know this has to be an outcome at the local level, as I've had this same snack (L11 on the menu) in the past at other Long John Silver locations.    It is my hope that the manager of this location will read this review and take action as I know I will be returning to this shopping area in the future and it would be great to be able to order L11 with confidence that it will be tasty and not too greasy!"}
{"text":"Wish I could find a nice mom and pop fish place because this place just isn't making it. Good thing you can buy tacos here too!"}
{"text":"Place is disgusting inside. All tables were filthy. The floors haven't been moped since the place opened. Men's restroom looked like a worn out mechanic shops restroom."}
{"text":"I got the $5 fish box. It was delicious for the price!  Plenty of food. My only issue is that the drive-thru took so long. I waited at least 15 mins. Outside of that I'm happy with them."}
{"text":"This place has decent fish which is all I really ever get when I want some super greasy fish from a fast food place. The inside isn't that clean and the staff isn't very professional. The food from here is fresh most of the time, however you can sometimes taste the old grease. They need to change that stuff occasionally."}
{"text":"First time at this place after seeing a commercial for a \"cod basket.\" Absolutely terrible, the food was saturated with grease, the cole slaw tasted old and the hush puppies were so unappetizing they should call them dead dogs!  The \"Yum\" corporation has failed with us on this one!"}
{"text":"Well, it took almost 40 years, but there are no more Long John Silvers fish restaurants in Las Vegas. This location seldom had the fish ready and the only fries you could get were those aweful potato wedges. I guess Long John Silvers no longer has a fan base here. Sad times."}
{"text":"First thing I noticed was how clean it was. Girl who was taking orders was very polite. She informed me that I could switch out any of the dishes that I wanted. So I got all fish. They were excellent. I actually couldn't eat all of it which seldom happens. All you can drink drinks. Lots of tartar sauce and ketchup. Very tasty food."}
{"text":"According to online, they closed at 11pm. I arrived at 9:55pm today and after taking my order, the girl refused to complete the order by saying they were closed. It was a 30 minutes drive for me and I'm never going back. I'll be contacting corporate in regards to this unbelievable unprofessional costumer service."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time or money at this place. Greesy and overpriced. Definitely never get it delivered if you want any hopes of getting a complete order. My order was missing food and when I called to get a resolution all I got was a lazy argumentative poor excuse for a manager. If customer service and actually getting what you pay for matters then probably stay the heck away from LJS. I think it actually stands for Lousy Just Saying. No wonder their parking lot is always empty.  P.s. Yelp is real and so am I."}
{"text":"Service here is surprisingly good. These guys make sure you get your food in a timely manner. One time they messed up my order. As soon as I pointed it out, they apologized and quickly fixed the problem. The only thing that kinda irks me is that just about every time I use their bathroom, it seems that they never have any paper towels to dry my hands.   As for the food, if you didnt already know, 90 percent of their food is fried. Which means it tastes really good while at the same time its kinda actually bad for you. Oh well, you know what they say. All in moderation! They do have some grilled items available which is quite tasty. But come on, thats not what you really came here for, right?"}
{"text":"Long John Silvers is a great place for fried fish.    Do yourself a favor and sign up for their text messaging promotions.  Great deals for whenever you are in the mood for fried fish."}
{"text":"Just had LJS for the first time in years... The location here on Southern & 7th is an express, FYI. One of those hybrids, with Taco Bell so no full menu. nevertheless, it was pretty darn good. Hot & fresh, drive thru service was pretty quick too. I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Food was okay just not as good as it used too be. The service was beyond out standing. Maybe they were just having an off day. After all we all have bad days. No restaurant can be perfect 100% of the time. I will try them again."}
{"text":"YUM! Love this place and their amazing staff! they remembered me after only being there once before!"}
{"text":"I love their fish and shrimp. The batter is delicious. Not much to say about the staff. They change and sometimes good and sometimes bad. I really loved their lobster bites too. Wish they would bring them back. I can't quite figure out what is missing and why they aren't more successful. But leadership starts at the top. A winning franchise is possible here."}
{"text":"First time customer and got the seafood sampler to go,  I was very impressed, the meal was the perfect size to fill me up and tasted great, I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"The food was old and not fresh. I was given knock off sauce that was not from LJS. The restaurant is in a state is disrepair and is just about falling down. There are two HUGE potholes in the drive thru that I know from previous visits have been there for a long time (years) that they refuse to fix. This restaurant is not up to the standards to represent the franchise or any restaurant for that matter. I can just imagine how disgusting the inside of the restaurant is. The staff seem to be doing the best they can with no management involvement to maintain the restaurant or hold them to quality control standards."}
{"text":"I note that I didn't dine in and I'm only basing my review on one takeout platter. My husband was curious about Long John Silvers and brought home a two piece Fish Platter that came with hush puppies, fries and coleslaw.    I wasn't going to review what I tried but I can't stop thinking about how terrible it was. I never had Long John Siver's before. I took one bite of fish and it wasn't crisp but oil logged and tasted like old oil. The fish inside was crumbly and muddy tasting and oily. I then offer my older dog a piece of fish and he took it and then spit it out. My older dog would not eat the fish  either. The fish platter came with a generous portion of fries but they didn't taste right to me or my husband. Not sure if it's because of a processing taste or just from the oil they used. I didn't try the hushpuppies but the coleslaw was ok.  I don't know if what I tried is typical of this restaurant.   Even my dog spit the fish out....sadly I wasn't prepared to photo it."}
{"text":"We wanted Long John's Silver's fish so we came here. There's no drive thru for Long John's so we had to go inside & order."}
{"text":"This place is always pretty good. Greasy but, worth a trip every so often.   The service is awful though. The cashier didn't smile and felt bothered to take our order."}
{"text":"Last night was my first and last time stepping foot into this restaurant. The place was disgustingly dirty, there were no tops for the cups, every condiment bin was empty. There was food and sauces spilled all over the floor. My daughter and I ordered a chicken and shrimp meal and were told they didn't offer that so I showed them the board they had on display clearly showing it was an option. So they gave it to us however we had to get it with the KFC sides. They messed up my daughters food. She ordered 2 chicken Little's and they came plain. No pickles or mayo. I went up to ask for mayo and was told he didn't have any packets. There was something wrong with the soda machine. No flavor to any of them. Tasted like water. A couple came in behind us and everything they wanted they were told they didn't have so they ended up walking out. Save your money and go to one of the many other restaurants in this immediate area"}
{"text":"I have been there 2 times now and both times they have messed my order up shorting me food usually. I probably got 15 dollars worth of food when I paid 25 dollars. I forgot to check my order before I left. But the food tastes very dry and isn't like it used to be. The food there used to taste great. I doubt they will be in business much longer."}
{"text":"With all the Long John Silver's in the area closing there are only a few remain. This location is across the street from Kennywood. I read the two negative reviews and can understand why there were written.   My review is the complete opposite.   We had a great lunch ! Service was wonderful and I enjoyed the retro look and sixties music.   We walked in expecting some total different , and was pleasantly surprised.   The older gentleman at the counter was friendly and served our order to us at our table. It definitely was an older crowed eating here now.   We will definitely return. Maybe not so much during the kennywood season when it's completely busy with that crowd, choose your visits wisely"}
{"text":"Worst long johns in history and you stupid imbeciles think you deserve $15/hr. You don't deserve to even bag at a damn grocery store you fools !! Don't go here. Just drive around the drive thru and look in the window. Straight garbage !"}
{"text":"This has to be the best order ever!  I had to wait which was fine but considering I haven't really eaten all day I do like my food hot not lukewarm. My fish and hush puppies must have just come out of the oven or deep fryer which I love.  Thank you"}
{"text":"Terrible customer service! Was advertised as open till 11 on a Saturday night, but actually closed at 10. The door had midnight posted. We got in the door, but then, the cooks kept coming out shouting out all the items they were out of. Couldn't order long johns at all. And couldn't order anything on the Taco Bell menu with beans. Out of beans!"}
{"text":"Went to this location a little over a year ago, and it reeked of vomit. Gave it another try, but this time we went through the drive thru. We ordered cole slaw as our side, but were not given spoons/forks to eat it with, so we threw it out. The girl at the drive thru told my husband she could not add a drink to our order, when he pulled up to the window.  I ordered the shrimp meal and my stomach is in so much pain. Stay away because this is not like the old, delicious, Long John Silvers' I grew up with."}
{"text":"How is Long John Silver's still In business? Inquiring minds want to know. My mother is a fan of this place and yeah maybe they were good way back when but they are awful. Here is my issue with this place first of all any and every time I have visited the level of service is ridiculous. The employee's here obviously hate the job they have. My most recent experience was enough for me to say I'll never return. What is most interesting is that they constantly market themselves by putting these coupons in the mail but not being able to honor more than half of them. The story is that they are not a \"full service\" Long John Silvers. This was explained to me by the rude young man who was already full of attitude before we even began to order. With that being said they only offer select items and not the ones that may be available at a full service location. That's all fine and dandy but let's make sure that it's properly disclosed on the coupon. If you are thinking about going through the drive thru, forget about it they only service KFC orders. You have to physically walk in to place an order for Long John's. How much sense does this make? Do better or just simply close down. The food is subpar and I can't believe how expensive they are. I feel like I'd be better off going to the grocery store frozen food aisle and buying some Van De Kamp fish fillets or hell even some Gorton's fish sticks...."}
{"text":"Recently, I received a 1 page LJS advertisement (coupon page) in either the Chicago  Tribune or the local News Gazette newspaper.  It contained a variety of different options (coupons).  Last Saturday night, October 6th, I went through the drive-through lane and ordered two meals.  When I reached the pay window I presnted a coupon.  The clerk, after a couple of minutes, told me he could not accept the coupon, because I did not tell him I was using it when I placed my order!!!    I told him this was unacceptable, since nowhere on the coupon or anywhere else was I told I had to mention the coupon when I placed the order.  I therefore paid, accepted my order, and departed.  On the way home, my son and I joked how silly and inappropriate this transaction was.  We decided one action would have been to cancel the order, then drive around and reorder it mentioning this time that we were using the coupon!   I reiterate that I was not informed anywhere that I had to mention the coupon when placing an order.  Other than Company Policy, I assume the refusal of the coupon was because of one or maybe two reasons.    FIRST, the employee entered the purchase when I ordered, and did not know how, or have authority, to override the register.       The SECOND more serious possibility is that there are two varieties/quantities of merchandise offered to the customer -- one for a regular-cost purchase, and another cheaper one for coupon use!  Either way, I think the advertising is deceptive because it did not say anywhere that the coupon must be presented when the order is placed in a drive-through.  This deceptive advertising should be publicized in the same manner that the coupons are issued."}
{"text":"Our experience here was fantastic for a LJS! Customer service was very welcoming and the restaurant was clean and as we were eating the ladies were cleaning during the down time, as an establishment should be. We will come back when in the area."}
{"text":"Hubby found himself with a sudden craving for Lon John Silver's, and turns out this is the one closest to us. He thought there was one by the Harkins North 16 but it seems that has been gone  for a few years now... So we made the trip to this one. Service was good, food was OK. Place was clean. We got the 2 meals for $10, and we both selected the fish and chicken plate. The only things were that they were out of tartar sauce and we had to wait a while to have it refilled. Also, I asked for lemons or limes and I was utterly surprised when they got me some plastic packets... yes, I am that naive, I was expecting real life lemons, but that says more about me than about them.  Bottom line, if we find ourselves again with a crave for greasy fish, this will be our destination... : )"}
{"text":"Expensive for average seafood/chicken but consistent.  Young Hispanic girl that works the window is incredibly nice. Fast service."}
{"text":"When I want a quick seafood fix, this is my spot. Only bad thing is, when I leave I feel like my arteries just clogged up."}
{"text":"Long John Silver's Store 31329 E Flamingo and Maryland Pkwy Las Vegas NV.  Went to this store ar12:33 PM today. What a disaster. The fish tasted like chicken, the fries tasted like chicken, the hush puppies (which were under cooked and doughy) tasted like chicken. All of it tasted like the oil was old and over used.  The crab cake tasted like salmon. No excuse for this. The table was dirty and even after being wiped down twice had food and gunk left on it. Both me and my friend both barely made it to a toilet with the runs after eating there. Stay away if you value your health and taste buds."}
{"text":"Every 3 or 4 months I go there and remember why it has been so long since I was there. Everything tastes like deep fried fish"}
{"text":"Drive thru is for KFC only..huh? I don't get ot. The fish was pretty gross, food was cold"}
{"text":"Not a full menu at this location.  No fish sandwiches. Food is ok but portions have gotten smaller and prices have gone up. Doesn't always honor mailed coupons, Lots of people come in for the fried shrimp and clam fritters, so somebody likes them. The coleslaw I would rate as 5 star. Ditto hush puppies. With the price of fish going up I think it is pretty hard to find a good fast food menu for fish."}
{"text":"The inside of this place is disgusting and the dial up internet for the credit card machine is complete and total bullshit. Let's not forget that the fries are ALWAYS cold."}
{"text":"Terrible visit this time. Usually very good. Long wait and food was way over cooked. To top it off restaurant was a mess."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a place that's going to give you great customer service don't go here!! I ordered a two piece fish and the gentlemen kept asking me if I asked for fish tacos! I told him several times, No a two piece fish combo. I got to the window & he charged me for two fish tacos. I advised him of his mistake & he went to tell his manager. He came back to the window & I asked for the correct receipt & he got an attitude & told me he couldn't. I wanted to make sure I wasn't over charged. His manager came to the window with an attitude & told me I could have my receipt & they charged me less for my food so I shouldn't have cared about the receipt. I have no issue paying for items I order so her comment was inappropriate. They then proceeded to tell me to have a good day without even handing me my food. This was the worst customer service experience ever!"}
{"text":"Are you are really looking at the review for LJS?  Its fried stuff, with extra fried stuff in a cardboard boat.  You will regret eating it 30 minutes after you finish, but it is delicious."}
{"text":"This place has been here for over 25 years. They have had good times and bad times. Right now must be a good time.   The place look great, fresh and clean.  The service was ok but the manager dude was great.  The food was good and they have some decent choices now.   We had a fish plate with 2 big filet's, slaw, frys and hush puppies. I had 2 fish tacos and lobster bites.   The plate was shared by both kids and they eat the majority of it and liked it. I had the tacos and while there are no good fish tacos in AZ these did alright. I would prefer not so crusty breading though. The lobster bites are fantastic but be sure to share them as the butter flavor get a little over powering and gross after 15 or so.   Over all it is better the McDonald's and cheaper."}
{"text":"Prices are always a little high. Clean environment. Not sure if I received all my pieces in the platter combo. Was highly pleased with the device. Manager served and asked us how our meal was. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"If you are in the mood for their fish, shrimp or chicken, this is one of the best locations I have found.   Very nice and friendly staff, they do an excellent job and take care of people here. Also have signed up for the text messages and that gets you freebies, which makes it even better!"}
{"text":"The good news:  Big Catch is the best thing these folks have done in a long time!  The bad news:  As soon as we made it a habit to pick up a Big Catch -- they killed it.  The good news.  The staff here is very pleasant and have to say \"I'm sorry\" a lot, but they do it with aplomb.    The bad news.  They have to say \"I'm sorry\" so much because of a lousy ordering system where they are always out of something.  Soft drinks one day, shrimp another day, onion rings another day.  But, since I seem to know what they are out of so often, I must like it enough to keep coming back.  I miss the Big Catch!!"}
{"text":"TERRIBLE. Do NOT let this be your first LJS visit here- it is miserable. Mean, dull staff serve limp icky fish. NO vegetable sides. NONE. Long John's' are supposed to sell delicious seasoned green beans and corn on the cob- the ONLY fast food that serves vegetables! THIS one doesn't. They claim to have corn- but each visit NO CORN. Awful.. just awful- I love Long John's but this one should not be allowed to carry the Long John Silver's name. It is truly just bad. The other franchise on Bell Rd is fantastic- what a difference! Completely different feel, great smiling staff and GOOD fish- I think the best in Phoenix actually. This privately owned \"kiosk\" is just really a bad mark on the restaurant. Skip it. The place looked dirty, unhappy and all around sad and the fish was almost inedible- greasy, raw looking and not fresh feeling.  IF YOU WANT FISH GO OUT OF YOUR WAY TO THE BELL road location- I DO not work there nor am I affiliated with Long John's in ANY way- I love the other store, see my other Long John's review."}
{"text":"Yes, Long John Silvers actually! for FISH AND CHIPS seriously- I know what you're thinking: what? a fast food place? yes. Hands down, in Phoenix this is the best for fish n chips. Perfect crispy light and airy breading/coating on the fish- tender, moist perfectly cooked fish inside- with no weird brown/grey parts inside!   I have been to quite a few fish 'n' chips places in and around Phoenix, and sadly there aren't very many here. I've tried George n Dragons and a few other so called English pubs around town- and Long Johns has much better taste and quality. Their fries are absolutely scrumptious- they taste hand made not frozen.  I used to visit Long Johns as a kid and they were terrible. They must have changed their recipe, because it's really just wonderful now. Don't laugh- bring home a basket of their food and serve it to the family and ask them how it is. THEN tell them it's Long Johns. They must put some secret ingredient in it that's addictive. Overall, they do NOT taste like fast food at all. It's better than the restaurant stuff anywhere in Phoenix and cheaper too.   I had a hard time sharing small bits of fish with the cats, they fought over it!   Really, really delicious. I wish they had more stores around here because I am not close to one of their restaurants and it's hard to make it to that side of town."}
{"text":"There are far too few Long John's anymore. They've updated their image a bit in the past few years with varied success, but the Broadway store seems to have handled the changes very well.  The new look is much cleaner with much more comfortable chairs and nice lighting. The menu has added several healthy choices as well. There's a general positive attitude from the workers more in line with a sit down restaurant than with a fast food place.  Very rarely is the food not fresh and hot. I often have to wait an extra minute or two, but that's OK. In those cases where the wait was long, they offered me a drink or a pie.  I will say that the fish and chicken come out great, but the shrimp often a bit overbattered. Other than that, great food."}
{"text":"They were out of shrimp. They did not have any Malt Vinegar and they threw my order in an A & W bag. So I guess they were out of the boxes also.  Service was slow. Food was. Ok"}
{"text":"We decided to go to long John silver's for dinner. Everyone has been so accommodating and friendly.  Our fries were a bit cold and before we knew it, they brought us out a huge order just out of the fryer..that was great. Highly recommended from us."}
{"text":"Prob one of my most guilty pleasures out there. I mean...it's Long John Silvers. I can't tell the chicken pieces from the fish pieces. Shrimp is pretty easy to spot but you never know. I would most like to review those amazing little pieces of crumbly things at the bottom of your cardboard container. Let's forget it's prob like eating deep fried butter and just savor the taste. Don't judge"}
{"text":"I wish that I had read the reviews here before I selected this place for lunch. My husband and I stood at the cash register for several minutes. An employee who was cooking in back noticed us and told the other employee that we were waiting. She came out and did not say hello to us. We told her what food we wanted. She kept walking out of our sight to behind a wall, I assume to enter our order into another machine. She hardly spoke to us. Only two other customers were in the restaurant, which seemed like a bad sign for a Saturday lunch. We sat at a table while we waited for our food to be cooked. Several minutes later, the cashier walked over to our table and gave us our food without saying much. We had to walk up to the cash register to ask for ketchup because they had none sitting out. I noticed that my iced tea was very warm, and I wondered how long ago it had been made and sitting in the dispenser. The food was very greasy, and I did not feel like eating all of it. My husband's shrimp had extremely thick batter on them. I remember enjoying Long John Silver's food in the past at other locations, but the food and service at this location definitely need to improve."}
{"text":"We stopped in for lunch and was sorry we did. The employees were polite but food was pretty much inedible. The fish was dripping with grease and had a ton of coating. The french fries were old and stale, I couldn't eat them, same with the hush puppies. The cole slaw was the best part of the meal, it's not the best I've had, but compared to everything else in the meal it was very good. Even the fountain soda was not properly mixed.  Most of the meal went in the trash and I went elsewhere to eat. I will not return."}
{"text":"This is the worst Long John Silver's I've ever been to. The fish was dry. The chicken was barely edible. They only offer fries or coleslaw as your only side options. They don't even put those little batter crumbs you get at every other Long John Silver's. The employees are extremely rude and unhelpful. Plus on top of that, my food had a slight taste of tacos or some other kind of Mexican food. I guess that's what happens when you combine a Long John Silver's and a Taco Bell and put them together in the same building. I won't be back."}
{"text":"So sad that this place has gone down hill. This is the only LJS close to me, and I used to love to duck in for a treat of fish and those crispy little batter pieces they always toss in.  Sadly, this is the last time. The fish was extremely soft and greasy, which usually happens if the fryer is not hot enough. the chicken planks were also greasy, and had an odd taste. On top of that. out of green beans and malt vinegar, and absolutely no batter pieces in the box. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Why is it that the drive thru only serves KFC customers? Most other combined restaurants serve both at the drive thru. Secondly, why is it that I stand at the register for about 5 minutes, a worker walks pass me several times without acknowledging my presence? I find it hard to believe that she was that busy since there was no one in the drive thru and no one waiting for their order. Poor customer service is all I can say about this place.  After I posted my review, I read several others and concluded that you really don't care about the way you treat or serve your customers. You have done nothing to address any of the concerns in the reviews. Terrible reflection on the Long John Silver's brand."}
{"text":"The pop machine was out of several kinds, and staff was too lazy to fix it. Staff was nice but the didn't get our order right and we were the only ones dinning in."}
{"text":"First time there, last time I will come back.  I really just came in for a rootbeer which they no longer have on tap, which makes me very sad.  But i was in the mood for fish.  I ordered one of there combos and the service here was awesome, thats the only reason why they got another star from me.  The staff is great.   Anyway the fish was way too salty, everything was dipped in oil, and truthfully after I ate the food I regret my decision.  It didnt sit right, and i felt disgusted.  Everything was room temp and after walking out the door, i knew I was not coming back."}
{"text":"If you're anything like me, you really don't expect super great service or food from a little fast food place. I can honestly say I've been pleasantly surprised every time we have come to this location! Whomever does the hiring, managing, and team building here is doing a phenomenal job."}
{"text":"It's a dirty place, but go through the drive-through for the fantastic fried fish (don't forget the malt vinegar), and it's all good."}
{"text":"They should get ZERO stars. I came to get something to eat after not eating here for years. Waited in the drive thru 15 mins before I even got up to order. As I go to order they inform me that there is no more long john silver being served tonight, just KFC. REALLY?!?!?! I told her they should've put a sign up letting people know instead of waiting 25 mins to finally get through the damn drive thru. I will NOT try and eat here again. Definitely needs better management and staff!"}
{"text":"Came in to grab food.. wow nothing like seeing the person talking on her cell phone while making your order. She also had zero gloves on and grabbed the food with her cell phone. She got angry when i told her i seen her. Dont come here bad service and dirty restaurant"}
{"text":"Don't come here if you want fast food.  I waited in the drive through line for 15 minutes.  The first two items I wanted were sold out.  When I finally got my ofer, it was wrong, cold and not very tasty.  To top it off, the staff was rude.  With all the options in Monroeville, not sure how they stay in business."}
{"text":"This Long John Silvers location is considered one of their \"flagship\" locations. They test new meals there to see if the customers will like it before it goes to all of their locations.  The restaurant is always clean, the drive thru is fast, the food is served hot and fresh, it doesn't ever come out stale or overly greasy. The employees are nice and friendly. My husband and I always ring the bell as we are leaving to let the employees know how much we enjoyed our food. We have been coming here for the past 10 years. I recommend this location for anyone looking for a fast fish or chicken meal with good service."}
{"text":"I agree with Paul on this one. But I had to stop here on my way home from work tonight.  (I think I feel my heart yelling at me again) , The gal at the drive thru window was just soooo sweet , I just might go back and ask her to marry me!  But then again , she gave me a slip with a survey on it to fill out online.  Maybe she just wanted my positive response. Ok Sarah B. you got it ... now where's my free coke ?"}
{"text":"I went to LJS today after seeing their newest commercial, about the classic cod and shrimp basket, looked real good. Haven't been to one any over a year. So I get there and its one where  KFC and LJS have combine the 2 stores. I placed my order for the cod and shrimp meal. When I got my order home I was fairly disappointed, because my order consist of half LJS and half of KFC products. If I wanted KFC I would have ordered KFC. This what was inside my box of LJS 1pc of cod,4 shrimp,2 hushpuppies, KFC potatoe wedges(fries), and KFC cole slaw instead of LJS (coleslaw). The food had a taste of KFC instead of LJS, like they cooked the food in same fashion as KFC. So my advice is you might not want to order LJS from this establishment unless changes are made for the LJS to give out its own product with their food and get their own taste back."}
{"text":"Stopped here to get dinner for the family cuz Long John Silvers has always been a favorite of mine. I was suprised to find it wasn't busy. The store was clean, the staff was friendly & helpful, and the food was prepared quickly. When the guy brought me my food he asked if I wanted sauce and I said yes some of everything. When I got home and looked in the bags I was disappointed to find no Tartar sauce, no malt vinegar,  and a whole bunch of ketchup.  :(  Then I discovered  the next disappointment when I started eating the food. I sure do remember the fish pieces being alot bigger. The onion rings were not very good, the hush puppies weren't cooked all the way,  and the fries were soggy! Not that it mattered really cuz I wont eat any of it without malt vinegar!  Ugh! What a waste of $45."}
{"text":"The table I sat at was sticky and my arm kept hitting it while I ate. All the food I received had been sitting under a warmer so nothing was fresh, Hot, or crispy. The only thing that worked for me was the coleslaw, it was good.  It's pretty sad when you fork over a $10 bill for a bunch of food that was sitting under the warmer!! The fish was cold and rubbery"}
{"text":"First time trying this place and not impressed. This place was horrific. Service was incredibly bad. Lazy employees didn't want to make extra pieces of chicken. The restaurant was filthy with old food, drinks, trash, and napkins all over the tables and floor. The trash cans were not usable and had a note written on them that read \"Do Not Use\".  Food was greasy and disgusting.   This place needs a health inspection. No wonder people mark this restaurant as \"closed\".   Disgusted."}
{"text":"The employees here are buying illegal perfume from theives. Do NOT patronize this restaurant. They have been crooked for years."}
{"text":"I ordered chicken and waited a good 10 minutes at the drive thru. Got home and realized that I was given fish and not chicken. Really? Sadly though the food is such poor quality you can't even taste a difference if it's fish or chicken.   Might I just add that for 2 fish (which should have been chicken!!) \"planks\", a handful of disgusting fries, and two hush puppies it was $6.99... For $9.99 you can go to a convenient store and get a full CHICKEN meal for your entire family for that much...   Did I mention that you shouldn't go here? Just don't!"}
{"text":"I like the food but don't order any extras such as drinks or deserts if you go through the drive in because the staff will conveniently forget about giving them to you."}
{"text":"So mad when I got home to find out I paid 14 dollars for a box filled with dried batter, and missing cole slaw. If you like that stuff, then this is the place for you. Incompetent workers..."}
{"text":"I'm so sad to have to say this place is so sad. Haven't been to LJS for YEARS and saw an add on TV! It looked so good. Ordered 8 pc family meal, drove home and some of the ordering missing. Drove back (about 15min one way) and watched one of the cooks behind the counter talking to his girlfriend. The lady behind me asked if my order was wrong and said hers was also from another time. I had to ask about a cashier and she came. No tarter sauce either. That was just extremely disappointing. Not one employee looked happy. I'll be praying for each of you. Please just close the store."}
{"text":"This place is really run down....needs a complete renovation. Food was okay, and found 2 hairs in my plate. Their staff need to wear hair nets"}
{"text":"we hadn't been here in awhile but got coupons for their \"Cod\", well, talk about FALSE advertising, when my husband goes to order the COD, the guy tells him they don't have COD, only the Alaskan White fish. So of course, my husband shows him the ad & then the guy tells him, oh that's at the Flamingo store.....NO WHERE in the ad does it say Flamingo location only or select locations only for the COD. Not to worry, we won't be back, their food is still extremely greasy & flavorless........a one star rating is way more than they deserve"}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst. One star is too much. No cod, no fries??? Really??? You're a fish place? Sharing the space with Cornel Sanders. All the way bad. No good food there. Stay away."}
{"text":"Hands down, Long John Silvers has the best fried fish and I'm not joking. I've been going there since I was a kid, and I've never been disappointed, and that's coming from someone who doesn't really like fish. The fish is of great quality and the crispy batter is delicious. The cole slaw is also tasty. The one thing that could be improved upon are the fries, but the hushpuppies kind of make up for that.  This particular location is very clean, and has a fun nautical diner-like interior. The manager of the place is super nice and always greets me and my family when we come in. I just wish the location was closer to home--they need to open some LJS restaurants in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"What a ridiculously average time I had at Long John Silvers today.  The outside was averagely upkept. The inside was maintained in an average manner. The food was average. And the prices? You guessed it... Average!  I do need to point out the employees were overly average.  There is a 100% chance that I may or may not return."}
{"text":"Customer service hete is absolutely horrendous.  We  waited for the woman at the drive thru to acknowledge our presence for about 5+ minutes. When she finally did she said \"go ahead.\" We said thank you and please multiple times and she never said anything in return. When we got our food, it was spilling out o@f its container and into the plastic bag. This employee had no manners and very little job appreciation. I will never return."}
{"text":"The food was pretty decent, but there was NO EXCUSE for how disgustingly filthy the dining room was. Every table was covered in food crumbs. There was food in the floor. The drink station was completely sticky and poorly stocked. There were only two other dinners in the restaurant at the same time as I was. I have no words except that I will not be returning here for a very long time!"}
{"text":"Not sure where those other two people ate but the Long John Silver's that I ate at here it was very good,  wonderful service good food nice fresh will definitely eat here again. there 4 of us traveling through on our way to Wisconsin and we decided to stop here. Well worth the stop will definitely stop here on the way back"}
{"text":"When I was growing up long john silver was a weekday event we always looked forward to. Then unfortunately there were no more around. Fast forward years later and the combo KFC/LJS shows up In my area of Raleigh,NC. I was thrilled till I are there and found it not to be anything like I remember.  Now in Phoenix I thought I would give it one more try. So happy to report this one does it right! It always clean and the staff is friendly with oldies playing which I know my husband enjoys that gives a warm feel to this place. On to the food- it's fresh perfectly cooked from my favorites of chicken, shrimp and fish to items such as baked cod. If you like seafood but didn't think you could find it in fast food this is the place. I consider it my weekly calorie splurge that doesn't break my bank account."}
{"text":"Good fast food diner! Fried fish has tempura coating, and is very good! It is what it is! Not a place to go for a fancy, sit down, dinner, but great, every day, stop on your way home from work, fare!"}
{"text":"Read the reviews and they were dead on, the customer service is pretty awesome. This guy probably doesn't love his job but he acts like he does, I wish there were more fast food workers like him , my hat goes off to you long John silver man, you freaking killed it dude.i don't even care how the food tastes.lol"}
{"text":"Service was friendly & fast.   Food was hot & good. Tarter sauce is out with the other condiments so I'm not sure what happened with the other person that gave a review. Only thing is they don't offer the Cod fish.  They should add that to the menu."}
{"text":"Not bad Long John Silvers. The place was clean inside and the food was quick and tasted as expected. I would go here again in the future."}
{"text":"Son and I wondered in here.  This isn't exactly our hood, but we were near by for my daughter's soccer practice.  The staff person came immediately to ask us what we wanted.  We were only there for root beer floats, but when son saw some of the other treats, he couldn't make up his mind.  He had a polar (something), like a blizzard.  I had a large A&W root beer float.  We were served quickly.  Place didn't look terribly clean, like the other reviews report.  But I saw the staffer wash her hand before touching food, so can't be too bad.  Parking is slightly retarded, tho."}
{"text":"I was outraged when I stopped here , the cashier took 10 minutes to figure out the previous order and when she was asked to ring an item up she said \"really\". I lost patience and left this establishment  ."}
{"text":"Got a coupke of floats.  The amount of ice cream in the float was tiny."}
{"text":"A friend and I decided to visit this restaurant as we had not had Long John Silver's food for a very long time. We decided to go inside rather than go through the drive thru. There was one customer ahead of us and we quickly perused the menu and decided what we wanted to order. There were no employees at any of the registers and after a couple of minutes we asked the customer in front of us if he had been waited on as of yet. He told us that he had been standing there at least five minutes without anyone so much as even acknowledging him. We could see four or five employees in the kitchen and drive up window area, but no one seemed to be paying any attention to what was happening front of house. After probably six to seven minutes, a male employee finally made his way to the register and took the order from the man in front of us. As soon as the customer had paid, the employee immediately walked away and did not return for another one to two minutes. He didn't even ask if he could take our order, he just sort of stood there pulling up his sagging pants. My friend and I both placed our order and never once did the employee make eye contact or thank us, or apologize, or generally engage in any way. But, at least we had placed our order and I proceeded to get some napkins and fill up my to go cup with sweet tea. I realized at that point that I could see back into the preparation area of the kitchen and for the next half hour, I was astonished, perplexed and concerned over what I saw. First, there was not any fish even prepped to make. I watched a woman employee have to make the batter for our fish order and watched her dip our order of fish without wearing gloves. Several times, the male employee that had finally taken our order, would leave the cash register and go assist with preparing the food. After handling cash and repeatedly using his bare hands to rub his nose, scratch under his hat and pull those sagging pants up that were so low, we were seeing much more skin than we should have, after doing all this, he would walk to the prep area and start touching food items and food containers. I have never seen anything like this in my life and I can honestly say that this was the worst fast food experience that I've ever had. Needless to say, I will never return to this establishment and would happily suggest to anyone, that picking food out of the dumpster in the back would probably have been much quicker and much more sanitary. This place should be shut down."}
{"text":"I wish I could put no stars because this is what they deserve. This is one of the dirtiest places I've ever seen every table was filthy. The staff was rude n all of them were playing with their cell phones instead of cleaning. The food was incredibly salty. Never coming here again. This KFC/Long John Silvers needs to hire an adult to supervise these teens."}
{"text":"It's deep fried garbage....it's LOS c'mon what do you expect.....however I have never had better, friendlier service at a fast food restaurant."}
{"text":"Was just in here today. Overall was a great experience. Restaurant was clean and the staff very friendly. Chase was my cashier. He was very patient and knowledgeable of the menu. The food was extremely quick and when I got home it was so fresh. The girl that I picked the food up from was polite and asked me if she could get me anything else. The only disappointment is that it's a LJS Express so you have to get KFC wedges as fries. I'm not sure why everyone is complaining about not being able to order by drive thru. I understand why they do that and I'm more than willing to get out of my car for hot, crispy fish. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Been waiting 20 minutes to find out they forgot our order. They only have 5 ljs items still on the menu and no fries. Don't even care what the food tastes like at this point. Can't do less than 1 star."}
{"text":"I stopped by here today for dinner after not having been to long Johns in years.  Interestingly the inside was still decorated exactly as it had been 20 years ago.  Booths made to look like ships from flags.  For dinner I ordered the 3 piece chicken meal.  Total cost, $7.  What did I get it for it?  Well a few measly pieces of chicken including a piece which could be considered a nugget.  I normally don't review fast food restaurants but couldn't let this one go.  I see why it has been years since I have been here.  Never again long johns, never again."}
{"text":"Mmmmm very yummy food... Hot and fresh. My shrimp was soooo juicy and tasty...Now I want some more lol. Also the service was beyond great everyone was so cheerful and prompt. Yea im definetly coming back soon."}
{"text":"Drive thru is slow as hell. 12 minutes sitting here.  Then I get home and I have the wrong order. I call the store twice and no one answers. Guess I will never come back here.  Waited until the next day to call and again the phone just rings and rings. I'm feeling like someone just took advantage or me  ran a scam on me, although that isn't true that is how I am feeling. These type of things only happen when the store has poor management and poor supervisors."}
{"text":"Waited 25 mins to get food. Place was dirty bathroom was dirty. Come on you guys can do better."}
{"text":"Slow but hot food!  Most people love Long John Silvers for the crumbs .... I got just one crumb (insert sad face). Oh and NO fries only KFC sides!  Clean."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, if I could give give a rating of 0 stars then I would. The fish batter recipe is a yummy guilty pleasure but that's it. I'm constantly finding hair in my food here.  ALSO! From the Handel's Ice Cream parking lot, I literally just watched an employee slowly stumble out of the back door... make his way over to the fenced-in dumpster... take his shirt off and drink a beer \"out of sight\" and then stunble back into work.  Absolutely repulsed and NEVER eating here again."}
{"text":"Glad its CLOSED!!!! Greasey and disgusting \"fish\".  This place gave Long John Silver and A & W a bad name. Stayed open toon long. The customer service was awful. Only second to their tasteless food. I am curious to know if they closed voluntarily. Good riddance."}
{"text":"I was painfully mistaken when I thought they would have a full menu at this location. Just wanted some clam strips! Very small selection of Long Johns food and it definitely appears to focus more on the distant relative of Taco Bell that shares the same building."}
{"text":"If I could give 0 stars I would for this place. They dont honor any advertisements that supposedly even the business owner himself posts on this restaurants yelp page. Takes a very long time to get your food as well."}
{"text":"They do not accept LJS coupons.  Part of a hybrid with KFC so no LJS fries just potato wedges.   The offer lemonade options with flavors added.   lol, Well I guess I should have paid attention to the other reviewers because they have pretty much said 'EXACTLY what it is'"}
{"text":"no, no, no.  I can't say it enough.  Greasy, salty fish eaten with plastic forks in an unclean setting.  What else is there to say???"}
{"text":"This place only gets 5 stars because it was the first job I ever had back in 1994 and I remember those times fondly.  It was a full Long John Silvers back then.  Today I think it's half A&W."}
{"text":"Best Long John Silvers in 3 states. This one is always fresh and their oil doesn't taste like it's been used for 30 days straight. Highly highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I used to go frequent Long John Silvers years ago.  My wife and I decided to go and try menu option L3:  2 fish, chicken, and three shrimp. It was unclear if this option meant two pieces of chicken as well. We asked the cashier who looked at the menu and validated my wife's question. I asked once more to verify I would be receiving 7 pieces of meat total. Again he said yes.  We placed the order and waited.  After calling my name incorrectly, the female shift lead(?) handed out our meal. It had 6 pieces of meat. Not a big deal, but it's the principal of the matter. My wife drew the shortest straw and politely approached the shift lead and stated the discrepancy. The shift lead said that no, it only comes with one piece of chicken. My wife explained our conversation with the cashier to which the shift lead replied rather snarky \"You can buy two pieces of chicken\".  My wife told her she was mistaken and wasn't paying for their mistake.\"  The shift lead threw a fit and stomped away to her Mgr who told her point blank-\"Then give her two pieces of chicken.\"  We received the chicken with extra attitude.   Customer service rule #1:  It takes years to gain customers but only seconds to lose them.   The food was as I remembered-very average(2-3 stars).  The shift lead's attitude was below average(0-1 stars) and I will avoid this resturaunt. Now I remember why I quit visiting."}
{"text":"The fish was okay, but not worth ordering again. The breaded shrimp was not deveined which made it look disgusting, and were still completely raw. Service took forever, and it wasn't even busy. This place is pure and utter garbage. I'm sure a homeless man dumpster diving would eat better food."}
{"text":"This place is an A&W/ Long John Silver's combo store so all your french fries taste like fish. They do have root beer on ice cold tap. Some of the items on the menu are ok, but most of time I leave disappointed. They do have a jukebox and lots of comfy boothes but its still fast food & its fish & burgers. Not the best but if your intoxicated it'll do."}
{"text":"Had to write a review after giving a second chance. The good: hushpuppies were decent. On to the rest...  First time I went there, ordered fish platter. Fish was just ok. Fries were old and soggy. Cole slaw had a ... different... taste. I ask for extra crumblies and was given a separate box full of them. Cool! First pinch of crumblies I put in my mouth, as I was chewing I noticed what was like a hair, but more fuzzy. How did a thread of fuzzy cloth get in there?? Weird, but it turned me off to the place for weeks. Just couldn't stop thinking about it.   Decided LJS sounded good on the way home yesterday, despite the fuzzy crumblies incident. This time... SAME. EXACT. EXPERIENCE. Cold, soggy fries. Meh fish. Weird tasting, warm slaw. Decent hushpuppies. First bit of crumblies I ate, fuzzy thread! I'm guessing (hoping) it's not a hair, but there must be a sweater stuck in their fryer. I wish I was kidding. Lesson learned. Won't be coming back to this location."}
{"text":"Loved my experience! I called ahead because we wanted a family deal. I spoke with Selena over the phone and she was fantastic. We were a little bummed they didn't have any corn on the cobs for our side but she made it up to us with a coupon.  Thanks so much for awesome customer service Selena! We will be back again! :)"}
{"text":"There was no one at the drive through.  Weird.  I had to drive up to the window (which was open) and shout to get someone's attention.  The woman who came apologized and provided me with good service.  I did NOT like the chicken.  There was too much breading and it was super salty.  This restaurant isn't for me."}
{"text":"The restaurant is clean, the employees are friendly. Although the \"getting food\" is slow, it is hot, fresh and yum. I do not recommend the drive thru, unless you are ordering a small, single meal. Big order? Go inside. They have added some healthier options - like salads."}
{"text":"Just spent $21 for food that was not fresh at all! I get it that it's greasy food but it was grease logged because it was not fresh and the  fries were old too!  Big disappointment!"}
{"text":"Well, this place has failed me again. It's been over a year since I last visited this Long John Silver's and it is still the same crappy place that over cooks the chicken, serves you cold fries and has ice tea that has been sitting around all day long and is stale tasting! You would think I would learn, but after a year I thought why not try it again. Employee's don't care whatsoever, serve up crappy food, have horrible attitudes - Had to ask to have a table cleaned off as they didn't have any tables clean in lobby.... Out of condiments and asked for some and was basically thrown them over the counter without as much as a smile or an apology for not doing their jobs!! One thing you can always be assured of here is that you can hear the employee's bad attitudes and complaining about their jobs!!!! I will never return here and most likely never to another Long John Silvers or Taco Bell.......... Of coarse I know they think they deserve $15 + an hour to give crap service and crap food..... No they do not!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This Long John's in Penn Hills is the slowest ever. Unless you have an hour to wait and eat, don't bother. Plus people not friendly. Always get order wrong. I'm afraid  to take back in case they remember me."}
{"text":"The last time  was here was Sept. 19th, 2016 because they were running a promo for \"Talk like a Pirate Day,\" and all you had to do to get a free lunch was to talk like a pirate (see photo).  I thought the place was pretty dumpy back then, and haven't been back since, not to mention, I really do not eat a lot of fast food to begin with.  Fast-forward to about a month ago, I drove past, and noticed the place was recently remodeled on the exterior, and it looked all new and clean on the outside.  Didn't really think much of it, but then a coupon came in the mail for a 2 piece fish meal with 1 side and hush puppies for $3.99, I decided to go back, eat lunch, and see if the inside was as clean as the outside, and I am pleased to report, that yes, the whole place was remodeled inside and out.  The manager who waited on me was very pleasant, and polite, as was the gentleman that made and presented my food.  The food was fine, not outstanding or anything, but for fast food, and for $4 something with tax, I was pleased with the fish and slaw, but the hush-puppies I noticed were much smaller than I remembered, and didn't taste that good.  I think they may have been sitting for a while, as they didn't seem freshly made.  Overall, I am glad to see this place cleaned up its act, and I even rang the Captain's Bell on the way out the door.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"I love me some Long Johns!! But today (Friday) at 11am they seemed pretty busy. One person up front taking orders and serving and one in the back cooking. I ordered the beer battered cod. I would pass on this item the next time I'm here. It's not the oil because the fries and hush puppies tasted great - unless the seafood is fried in a separate fryer. The batter seemed to soak up the oil. I just peeled off most of the batter and just ate the fish but the cod tasted great!"}
{"text":"Normally they have good food but last night the fryer was horrible.  We had the family meal with fish and chicken and we couldn't eat it the oil was rancid."}
{"text":"Absolutely the most poorly run fast food restaurant.  Service was slow and inefficient.  It took over 30 minutes to place and receive an order.  They are so inefficient they no longer take drive through orders for the Long John Silvers side of the restaurant, when every other Long John's does.  If I owned and managed a business that was so inefficient, I would be ashamed."}
{"text":"It's nice that they'll drop your food fresh for you if you ask. Otherwise look out for the grease! I really do love this place. The food just HAS to be fresh out to enjoy t!"}
{"text":"I was in the mood for some good old unhealthy fast food so I came to Long John Silvers which is merged together with KFC. This merge is such a turn off because I DO NOT LIKE KFC, For my sides I ordered fries and green beans and I received items from KFC's menu such as KFC-Potato Wedges and KFC Green Beans, I wanted LONG JOHN SILVERS NOT KFC!! This really sucks because it's not many Long Johns left here in Vegas. My food was fine with the exception of the KFC but however I don't think I'll return."}
{"text":"I love LJS, but I  had to write a review regarding this particular location.  The inside is very dated and appears to be poorly cared for.  It smelled like burnt fish when we walked in the door.  It took about 15 mins for the food, so I figured it was gonna be all fresh...negative!  The fish was old and cold and fries were a very soft.  The corn lacked butter.  I didn't care for the onion rings and my boyfriend said the Coleslaw tasted spoiled.  The chicken planks and hushpuppies were the only things edible.    Service wasn't too bad - nice people.  Too bad a whole bunch of flies started flying around the dining area and prep area, which ruined my appetite."}
{"text":"Extremely greasy.  Tarter sauce is awful.  The workers were polite, but the food was not good at all."}
{"text":"It's a personal irritant when I'm asked to pull through when grabbing food at the drive thru window then have someone bring it out a few minutes later.  I didn't have any special order beyond a menu item, which was odd.   I get it, really.  It's all good.    Anyway, fish and chips.  I've always liked the salty crispy batter making this place a guilty pleasure when I want deep fried goodness."}
{"text":"Terribly slow and incompetent service. There was a line when I got there, with only one person serving food and taking orders/payments. It took forever for me to finally get to place my order, the manager came up a few times to help the girl find certain buttons or whatnot on the register, but then would always disappear.   I waited quite a long time for my food, and watched as half of my order was prepared - then the cashier started taking the order for a large family - while my food sat there getting cold. She couldn't find things on the register - again - so the manager came up to help. I pulled the manager aside and told her I wanted my money back, since it had taken so long, and after all that waiting ... my food was sitting there just getting cold instead of being delivered. She NEVER apologized, she just said that the girl was being trained. I told the manager that if the girl was being trained, someone else needed to be up there helping her. Again, no apology - just attitude from the manager as she went to another register to process my refund.   I think her name was Monica, the manager. TERRIBLE terrible uncaring service, will NEVER return. (There were at least 3 people there but only one person - the trainee - working.)"}
{"text":"Food is OK for fried fish and chicken planks, Staff are nice but seem under staffed each visit. Had to wait 5-6 minutes to place order. Drinks should come with combo meals but had to order drinks separately at a $1.69 each for two  regular drinks WOW!! Self serve condiments area seem messy and crowded with other customers. I prefer the prepackaged tarter and cocktail sauce, I think it is safer... A Popcorn shrimp and chicken plank platter cost $15.43 total  for two people. A little pricey I think."}
{"text":"I wasn't expecting a five star dining experience, but this place is disgusting. The food may even be worse than Jack in the Box and you're better off eating the food at the bottom of your freezer from years ago! My dad even told me that when he used to work there, there was a grease bubble that popped in the kitchen onto the wall and the peeled it off and put it into the fryer. Never going back. EVER."}
{"text":"My review similar as the rest. Not happy that the drive through is for KFC only (with that said if your open till 10pm why are you always our of extra crispy). I have three issue with this location  #1 80% of the time they do not give you are receipt from the register just the receipt from the CC machine. they even seem shocked when you ask for it and the cashier had to ask some one else to print(reprint) so I could have a copy. #2 they do not serve Clams (that suck) #3 you have to go in side to get LJS even then if its past 8pm you may be told that they are no longer serving that for the night, ( you paid for the franchise you should take every advantage to grow that business for your self and the chain.  If there as another LJS or KFC location closer to me I would go there first. as with most business some employees are more helpful and friendly then other. I think Corporate chain should really look at this location."}
{"text":"Gross little place.... I had not been to Long John Silver's in years.... As as you walk in  it smells like old grease... It's smoked up and the employees look dirty.... Not like they just got dirty... I mean like bums.... If they look dirty then odds are they are dirty. (clean hands, ect..) Not like someone I would want to prepare anything for me.. Went in. I noticed these things while waiting in line for about 5 minutes (only 2 people of front of me) and walked out....."}
{"text":"Love this location. My food was cooked perfectly today. Laura is always very nice at the register and I love the oldies music. The fried crab was very good today better than usual."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why I keep going back here.  The food is swimming in greese.  I should just go to any bar and get better fish"}
{"text":"Ordered the fried fish and shrimp, everything was half cooked.  Only got a \"sorry\" from the employee, not coming back."}
{"text":"Ordered the fish and shrimp, was fairly decent cooked, came fast.  The booths are rancid, like they never clean the seats, bathrooms aren't too bad.  At least it's better than the one at Centennial."}
{"text":"I Love long john silvers!!  Sadly, I have not had it for the past 2 years...as many of them have closed, and the few that are still open are in places I chose not to go.  imagine the joy I felt, when I discovered that a partial LJS was right down the street from the house I just moved into last week.  It shares service with a taco bell, so its not the full menu..but that's ok.  Some reviews on here mentioned how slow they are.  I am also ok with that.  It took about 4 mins for me and my friend to get our food.  The fish, fries and hushpuppies were nice and hot, and super crispy! The slaw was awesome as always.  The soda dispenser had some kind of lipton mango tea in it. DAYYYUMMM!!!  That stuff was amazing!!  yeah.  Im super happy that this LJS is here, and I will be coming back many many many many many many times."}
{"text":"I have no words how terribly ran this place was.  The food was awful.  Ultra salty, no flavor, all batter very greasy.  Felt grossed out after eating.  Ew"}
{"text":"Long John SIlvers, as a food chain, is not top-drawer. It's cheap fried fish for the most part, not the healthiest of food, but delicious. And unfortunately, for whatever reason, these restaurants often have customer service issues, understaffed and less than courteous. That said, this particular location has never failed to be polite, prompt, and correct in my order. Every time I go there, I get exactly what I ask for with little delay and everyone's cheerfully polite.  The only real caveat I have with this location is that they have a pothole right in front of the drive-through window that's a bit alarming to hit the first time, and which requires a goose of the accelerator to exit."}
{"text":"If I could give 0 Stars I would   They didn't have any thing today for long johns   No cod , no shrimp , to tarter sauce  Waited 30+ mins for chicken and hush puppies   Then didn't give us our full order"}
{"text":"My husband, 5yr old son and I came in and after ordering we went to wash our hands. Employee cleaning the bathroom was wiping down the trash and turned around and wiped off the counter and everything else with the same rage. She had everything sprawled out on the floor, so we couldn't even walk in. Then the employee sweeping out in the lobby turned around, put the broom down and started grabbing our plates to bring them to us without washing her hands. Went to get a refund after seeing this and Alexis did give our money back but after that, the employee from the bathrooms, came out and started serving food and getting drinks, while taking off her gloves she just cleaned the bathroom with. VERY DISGUSTING. We drive a long way just to go to this location because its usually great but after this experience, we won't be coming back any time soon. Considering this is the flu season and just being that you handle food, you would think they would train there employees better."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and i waited for 20 minutes for our small order (chicken and fries meal and a fish and fries meal). They were serving people who came after us first, there was no order to way people were being served. When i asked the girl if our number was called she ignored me and ran off while another girl was apologizing and offering bribes of free drinks for the wait. They filled our boxes with a ton of fryer crumbs and forgot to give my brother his shrimp (he placed his own order and even got it before my girlfriend and i). I doubt i'll go back again, i'll hit the one in parma with the drive thru as they actually make fast food fast."}
{"text":"I knew I shouldn't have stopped.  All my other visits over the years had been terrible but I was really craving fried shimp and couldn't imagine how they could screw it up.  Well...$8 later after eating 3 flavorless greasy shrimp and picking at the fish I threw it away because I knew I was going to throw up if I ate any more.  It was THAT bad.  Where is the corporate or owner quality control on this product and to make it worse the cashier was an idiot lost in his own world - What's a combo...dah it's a number 9 with chicken.  OK what's a number 9?"}
{"text":"I came to LJS expecting to enjoy some chicken (which was my favorite when I worked there years ago) and asked for rice as one of my sides as well as a salad. The cook stated from the kitchen that he doesn't want to use the rice that was made because it was being saved for the morning crew! So I ignored him even though I was irked that he blatantly just admitted to having a product but was too lazy to use it and make another batch. All of my food (chicken-fries-huspuppies) were old and were past the discard and hold time as far as I could tell. I understand when business is slow they should be cooking food \"to order\" to ensure freshness for their guests. This was NOT the case at this location.  Moving on to my salad. They had no raspberry vinegarette so I said ranch would be fine with me. The cook reached into the cooler and said \"oh great we have salads made up\" and I should have known he wouldn't check quality from his comment \"if people would leave us alone we could get things done around here\". My salad had not only wilted lettuce but it was slimy and not edible in the least bit. Probably a few days out of code I am guessing.   I even had to ask for my drink which was forgotten and given to me with no ice. I had to ask for napkins because nothing was stocked at the condiment bar. Tartar sauce was almost empty and spitting out slowly, and gnats were flying everywhere around the register area. I used to work for LJS before college as a shift manager and let me say, if I ran my store like this crew did my DM and GM would have canned me in a second. The male that made the comments about customers bothering them also stated he was the manager on duty and that he wasn't even supposed to be working and the oil needed thrown out to patrons he knew beside us (obvious from the dark burnt battered product).   This location needs to get it together and focus on quality products and hospitality. This is not the LJS that I remember unless the franchisee is turning their back on their locations."}
{"text":"I'll just start off by saying that i don't eat here and have chosen not too for quite sometime. Only reason i was here was because my mom was in the mood for a  chili cheese dog and this is the only place that has one locally.  The drive thru is a sorry excuse for outdoor customer service. it's so rickety and the signs are all old and outdated. The Glass that housed them menu was clousy and filthy looking. They used to be a Long John/ A & W but i guess that alliance wore thin.   I ordered my mom her dog and got my nephew a chicken finger kids meal. The service was prompt but the inside of the kitchen station through the window was filthy. there was food and flour on the fllor and everything...i mean EVERYTHING was covered in grease. When the cashier handed my the food i checked the bag. my nephews meal wasn't even wrapped it was just a few fries, one piece of chicken and one hushpuppy sitting open inside the bag. tsk tsk!  The smell was pretty good and i was almost tempted to eating a french fry but after remembering how that place looked i just chugged some water and waited to get home. At least there i made myself a decent salad."}
{"text":"Not a five star experience but please tell me what fast food place is. The food is always well made and hot. It takes some extra time especially if you are in drive thru and they really don't give you enough sauce.   Regardless I will go here once a month or so, its a reasonable amount of food at a decent price to feed my little family.  P.S. The batter crunchies are AWESOME"}
{"text":"All my other times were great (albeit salty onion rings), but my last visit there, the employees handed me the leftovers of someone's meal that couldn't have fed a dog. Completely inexcusable and a pathetic service for even a fast food joint. Would not recommend to anyone.  P.S. I actually made this account just for this. That's how pathetic the service was."}
{"text":"I was pretty surprised eating here; the food is actually pretty good and freshly fried. After eating about 1000 freshly fried carbs however your bodies metabolism slows to one akin to Jabbity Hut's.  The food here is like Chris Tucker's line from Rush Hour -  \"Damn, Chin, this is some greasy sh**.\"   Indeed a $4 pile of greasy goodness"}
{"text":"Got the wrong order one fish was cold one was warm and  fries were cold and un eatabe.   To many people to go back  as I was on my lucnh...  Very disapponied"}
{"text":"Why is there no option for zero stars???  DO NOT GO HERE. Especially if you're hungry or suspect you have low blood sugar. You will most likely die waiting for your food. I could feel myself aging while waiting for my to go order. After 40 minutes (not exaggerating) I asked for my money back because I didn't want to die of old age and still hungry. The only thing they did right was refund my money quickly and efficiently. Obviously they have lots of practice with this  Steer clear"}
{"text":"UGH!  I've NEVER had food this GREASY, it was take out so III tried to eat it. I had a piece of chicken & 1 of fish. After the 1st bite I tried putting napkins on both sides to get rid of the grease, I had to do this 3 times !  They still tasted like Salty Grease. I also got onion rings that tasted just like the chicken & fish!!  The food was so salty my eyes were puffy the next morning! Will NEVER go there again."}
{"text":"Food is the same.  Prices are the same.  What this place has that most don't are the people.  The staff always make the difference and the young man that was at the register was soft spoken but patient and smiling.   Glad to stop in at an LJS and not regret it, for once."}
{"text":"I came here last Friday (04/06/2012, Good Friday) for lunch. Most of these locations look the same, not that great looking. Anyways, I dont come here for the location but the food.   I rate the food at 4 stars, I've never had bad food here. It's always served hot and juicy. It's affordable and good.  The service I had, would give them a 5 star rating. It could have been this location and a good day. My cashier was Nathan and he was respectful and polite. The guy that brought me my food was Aric and he too was respectful and polite. I cant remember the last time I had seen something like this with young kids. But, I was impressed."}
{"text":"It took over half an hour to get our order. Usually takes 20-25 minutes. Next time I'll find a different location- even if it's further away!"}
{"text":"20 minute wait once we placed our order.......cashier had no customer service skills and wandered around behind the counter while what looked like 2 people were making food. It's a Friday night..where is your staff? My food was like warm by the time they finally gave it to me."}
{"text":"Incredibly slow service. This location is combined with Kentucky Fried Chicken. The kitchen is too snall to handle 2 fastfood restaurants. None of the orders were right. First they argued the order was correct but when the manager compared the receipt to the order even he couldn't match it up. He offered to remake everything but said it would be another 2 minutes.  It was three simple orders. We just ate what we had. Won't be back. I can see why it's reported that it's closed but it's very much open. Maybe they should close."}
{"text":"I'm unimpressed with this location. Kids were begging to go to a long john silvers since we moved to town. It's usually only a traveling treat since we didn't have one where we lived before. The menu is limited. The staff wasn't very helpful and the food wasn't that great.  (It's been years since I had been and I forgot how greasy it is.) Ketchup and napkins weren't out. The tea containers were both labeled colonel's sweet tea even though one was unsweetened. They only have kfc potato wedges. I think we won't be back."}
{"text":"The employees are not nice, they had the nerve to give my friend old fries, and the dining area was not clean. 0000000 STARS!!!!"}
{"text":"my wife I went there we both had the salmon dinner it was delish,a good size piece of salmon on a bed of rice with broccoli, we well being going back."}
{"text":"Baja fish tacos- holy friggin moly delicious!!!!! :D and only 99¢!!!  I was very pleased with this particular location. Look if you're looking for high quality fish or seafood, you have to understand that this is fast food seafood and you wont find it here. BUT I have to say for fast food quality I LOVE LJ Silvers. And my new favorite item to get is their BAJA FISH TACOS!!  What I loved is that normally, I just get the fish platter but today I was feeling like a fish taco, so I rolled into LJS and ordered ONE fish taco to try out, when I got to the window the cashier asked me if it was my first time trying one and I said yes. He simply said \"This one is on the house, if you like it- which you will, come back and see us again\" :D so I got my first Baja Fish Taco Free! and not only that- it was AMAZING! The taco is big! get two and you'll be full. Then theres the sauce they put in it- and ITS AWESOME- has a little spice to it and it's mouth wateringly delicious... JUST TRY IT. You will be pleased!!"}
{"text":"No tartar sauce or corn. French fries tasted old. The fish and cole slaw tasted good, but who goes to a fish place and doesn't use tartar sauce. It was very disappointing."}
{"text":"They said they observe Veteran.s Day free meal, but required a coupon with a unique number. The coupon I received in my e-mail showed no such number and stated no coupon required. What a dumb store with an equally dumb manager."}
{"text":"I've eaten at Long John Silver's a few times over the years.  I am amazed that this place stays in business!  On my most recent visit to try a fish taco, I was the only person in the place!  When I walked in, the crew was sitting in the restaurant drinking soda and chatting.  When they saw me, they scurried back to their respective battle stations.  I ordered two fish tacos and it took a bit for them to make them.  The fish tacos were okay for a buck each, but nothing to write home about.  Then why the hell am I writing, you ask?  To impress upon you to not visit Long John Silvers unless they a) build a new corporate image b) offer decent food for a change! c) clean up their restaurants.  While I was waiting for what seemed to be an enormous order, I gazed about the dingy establishment.  What a dump.  It is clear that this company is hanging on by a thread.  Why don't they just throw in the towel already?  ...and I don't mean in the deep fryer.  I realize Long John Silver's has opened a few new locations, however, if you're attempting to revitalize your company, you must revitalize all your locations, not just one or two.  This particular location on Brookpark Rd is the worst...bad enough for me to write an e-mail to their corporate office."}
{"text":"What is wrong with The Long John Silvers Stores? The food is awful. They changed the fries, which use to be the best, are now  thick and down right disgusting. The coleslaw is terrible, the fish is greasy and cold. How do they expect customers when the food is just plain awful? Also, you can not contact the Headquarters to report the problem, because it won't take the store numbers to report the problem. How can they even serve the disgusting food they are serving now? This use to be a great place to eat,  so why isn't anyone listening to the bad reviews this place is getting and do something about it? Any suggestions?"}
{"text":"this was the experience from hell,. the first thing to set it off was  I was told by the kid that I couldn't use more than one coupon so he had to ring up the ADD A PIECE coupon by its self and than take the money only to not have the register working correctly....it wouldn't print the receipt and so he kept punching the print key and then he turns around and lets the manager know that it wasn't print and she says 'OH ITS LOCKED UP AGAIN, only to not fix it and turns around and leave us there. I said I don't need a receipt and he then goes to the next item but before that even happens the girl is at the counter calling a number and no one is answering because its MY order but I don't have a receipt because the damn printer isn't working and the kid never told me what my NUMBER was.... sadly this happens to me with the next 3 orders I place. When we went to place the order we were told right away that they had NO FRYS..... really no frys. Nice ordering . This experience doesn't end here , I got home and went on line to contact corporate and they need a store number....THAT I DONT HAVE BECAUSE I DONT HAVE A RECIEPT BECAUSE THE DAMN REGISTER IS BROKEN. so I went to their link to find the store number , which I found but when I put it into their spot to procede with the complaint. CORPORATE says I doesn't validate their OWN store from hell and it wont let me procede. I then went to call the store and ask them for the store number the phone is off the hook because it just rings and rings , I gave them the benefit of the doubt and tried 10 times and the phone each time just had a busy tone. I will find the number and finish this with corporate. I was there at 6:00 pm on 9/17/2016 and I feel bad for the 2 girls that were standing behind me to hand In applications. GOOD LUCK girls!!!"}
{"text":"So our last visit seemed normal  Food prep time about usual  I walk up to check on it and to my surprise they were about to call my number.  the little woman behind the counter said \"We are sorry for the delay, we added 2 extra pieces of fish for you\".  Said thank you and was Very impressed"}
{"text":"The cashier was new so bless him that he put my order as eat in though I stated to go. He also forgot my drink cup. The manager was quick to rite the wrongs. Love the rootbeer on tap. The double Bacon Burger was delicious. Could of came with more fries. A&w rocks."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and yes it's still open, although people who keep marking the location closed are not that far off. First of All, they have a drive thru with a LJS sign indicating to order, then they tell you nope sorry you have to come inside for fish. If this were the only complaint I would ignore the stupidity, but sadly it isn't. You walk inside and the floor is noticeably sticky meaning uncleaned. Trash laying around and pretty rude service! Lots of blank stares in response to simple things like how many pieces are in a family pack....its not shown on the menu, you'd think asking an employee would get you the answer but nope! The true saving grace is that I love LJS and I wish this wasn't the only location within 10 miles from my house. My favorite part is that I arrived at 8.00pm, received my order in about 25 minutes leaving before 9 at night, to have a rather annoyed looking gentleman practically shove us out of the building and lock up the door and started closing up shop when their hours state open until 11....lazy, rude, and needlessly tiresome. I hope to find another location very soon."}
{"text":"I am rating the SHRIMP!! Their shrimp tastes so fresh and tastes like top quality shrimp, and it is bigger than one would expect from Long John Silver's! I actually like Long John Silver's fried shrimp better than Red Lobster's!!! Not kidding, I am shocked at how GOOD Long John Silver's shrimp tastes!!! With that said, it is not cheap, but it is worth the price!!!  I am so glad to have discovered it recently!! I believe it might be a new recipe as I have tried it before and it wasn't memorable. This time it was part of a promotion. It was just so damn good!! It was breaded perfectly and cooked perfectly!!   We eat all the items here, both Taco Bell and Long John Silvers, and all is good! But, my favorite thing on the menu is the shrimp!!"}
{"text":"I went to the This restaurant yesterday to get one of the new fish sandwiches.  They're not cheap. $5.92 for 1 sandwich.  I'm thinking.  This has got to be good for a sandwich if it costs this much.  After waiting for about 5 minutes (I was the only one on  the drive through) I got my sandwich.  I unwrapped it and marveled at how big it was.  It was strange that it had a dark brown color.  When I bit in, grease oozed out of the heavily breaded slab of pressed fish.  What just happened?  This couldn't be true.  $6 for pressed fish?  Soaking in grease?  Dark Brown?  I went inside to get my money back.  Even the manager on duty was apologetic.  She was fully aware that there was a problem with their new product. I called the owner who told me he didn't eat fish, that it was corporate that rolled out the new products.  It's really sad to see a once legend in the fast food seafood industry go down like this.  I'll never never never go back! So sad!"}
{"text":"The food was really fresh and good however the building was really dirty and the bathrooms for filthy.  The dining room is dirty and there's no napkins or lids for the drinks.  The only way this place is open it's because the food is good the rest of the staff is lousy the dining room is lousy and everything else is dirty!"}
{"text":"Went to Long John Silvers today for lunch. We dont live in this area and we dont have a location near us. I was very excited to see one! Unfortunately, everything we ordered was disgusting! (i didnt get a chance to try the clams since i ordered and paid for them but did not receive them) the fish wasnt even crispy, the breading was completely soggy and you couldnt pick it up to take a bite without it falling to soggy pieces. The shrimp was completely over-breaded. It was like taking a bite of flavorless breading and hardly any shrimp. The french fries were cold and soggy, on the onion rings were fried in the fish oil...that did not taste good! I will never go to a long john silvers again. They've gone way downhill and its no wonder they're all closing down. Gross!"}
{"text":"Food is amazing. Service is slow slow slow. turn your car off and wait a half hour or more your food. each and EVERY TIME!!!"}
{"text":"Bad!  Bad food, bad service, very dirty and they were out of everything!  My mother in law wanted Long John Slivers, and well this was close to the house.  We should have left.  So here's hoping they clean things up!"}
{"text":"For what it's worth I give the place 5 stars not bad at all for a fast food fish place fast friendly service and the quality of the food is pretty good . I've been to some sit down restaurants that had horrible food and service . The staff is helpful and patient with the customers too Tks for the great lunch during this Lent season Long John Silvers!!"}
{"text":"Very unhealthy and gross. Get fresh fish instead, it's way better for you."}
{"text":"Do not eat here. The last time I did about a month ago it was really nasty. I sat inside by the window close to the drive through lane. There was a swarm of flying ants in the inside of the window.  I moved to a middle table. The back legs on the chair were broken and it was falling over.  I can't believe no one has fallen out of it. The wood beneath the trash cans is rotten all the way through.  The whole inside is a complete disgusting mess.  I assume most people use the drive through so they never see inside. I understand it's a greasy fast food place so I'm not expecting much but this place is a health hazard."}
{"text":"So......I had to run to the post office on 19th Ave, cut down to Bell, didn't have much time, and here I am!  I had seen a few online reviews of Long John's new \"Beer Battered Cod Platters\", so I decided to stop by the drive thru and place an order.  I went with the 2 piece Cod Platter with double fries as my side.  Total was around $9.00.  Here is how it was............  2 Piece Cod Platter-  From their commercials, this looked pretty good.  I've never been the biggest fan of Long John Silvers regular fish (lately, at least...back in the day, that shit was BOMB!), but the beer battered cod sounded different and delicious.  This platter comes with 2 nice sized pieces of cod, a whole bunch of fries (since I did order double fries), and 2 hush puppies.  The fish was actually really good.  Greasy, but good.  You could totally smell/taste the beer batter once it came up near your face.  The fish was nice and meaty and tasted great.  Way better than their regular fish pieces!  The fries weren't that great.  They were cooked proper, but they just didn't do anything for me.  The hush puppies were delicious, as always.    Overall, I'm glad I stopped.  I hand't had them in awhile and it was a decent lunch.  The beer battered cod and hush puppies were great!  The fries and price ($9.00) were not.  I never crave this place, but I'm sure I will stop by in due time next time they have a new item that sounds tasty."}
{"text":"I was here Saturday (13/16), with a companion about 7:15 p.m. we were greeted promptly and warmly,, end of orders taken right away. We ordered a  #2 and a #5 platter. I don't know if it was my mistake, but when. Two number two platters., which was on the receipt. I went to the counter, and politely told them I wanted number 5 platter, and that I would pay the difference. They very nicely refused to accept my money, gave me the 6 shrimp, and let me keep the chicken, too.  Everything was golden brown, not dripping grease, and my Cole slaw was creamy deliciousness. Even my green beans were decent (not mushy). They had a Christmas  tree inside the door, and Christmas lights, Garland, and stockings with employees' names decorating the dining room.  Today I got a (free after doing their survey  (on receipt) piece of fish and fries. It was a sizeable piece of fish and a good portion of fries. The fish was fresh, flaky, and delicious and was golden brown. Although on the french fries were okay, they would have been much better a bit crispier. The fact that they weren't greasy was great. I tried their tartar sauce, but for me it was pretty bland. Again, the crew was friendly and quick. I wanted to add a crab cake to my meal, but the cashier said that it would take 4 minutes because they're made fresh to order. I'll try those another day.   Ultimately, decent fast food and a decent price, with nice employees. Gotta love that, especially this time of year!"}
{"text":"this place is pretty cool. It's just average as in customer service some is good and some isn't. The manager here (last time I checked) she was pretty nice. And the guys the work in the front in the late afternoon. Pretty good too.   Also, looks very clean here. Which is what I look for the most. The tables need constant cleaning though. Everything else pretty good for me so far. . ."}
{"text":"So I stopped by to pick up some lunch today and wish I hadn't. I have worked in this area for over 3 years but have only stopped here twice. I remember why after the first time I didn't come back. I really just do not like A&W's burgers or fries.   The fries were bland and I believe McD's or Carl's have better fries. The burger, well it was just bland. The flavor came from the \"special\" sauce (thousand island) on top. The cheese was not melted and just didn't work for me.   The service was fast, but just like other drive-thru's, I could barely understand what the guy was saying. There was no one else in line but once I got up to the window, he was rushing to give me my food. It was just odd to me, especially since I was the only one!"}
{"text":"This LJS is decent. Service was okay, but a bit slower than I expected. The food came out fairly well."}
{"text":"The food here is greasy and OK. The customers here, all seem like they've eaten alot of greasy food in their time."}
{"text":"The legend lives on from the Cuyahoga on down Of the big lake they called Ooey Gooey The lake it is said, is full of sheephead When the Lenten season turns gloomy  With a load of hushpuppies, 2 planks of fake cod The Edmund Fitzgerald on WNCX radio The fries were stale and thoroughly chewed And doused in tartar sauce mayo  The shrimps were the pride of the pot smoking side Packaged in some factory in China As the cole slaw goes, more creamy than most And the batter was very well seasoned  On the way to the mall or Lakeland College halls Or going to a show down in Cleveland After your order the ship's bell rang Greasy satisfaction you're feeling  The free pirate hat protected my hair As the waves broke over the seagull chatter we all passed gas at Euclid Beach park I craved some more of that batter"}
{"text":"Terrible fast food place. fish was burnt, and they forgot to give me my drink. I also discovered after arriving at my house with my meal that I didn't get my fries. How hard is it to make food that has specific directions, and these are the same kind of people that want $15/hr."}
{"text":"Yesterday (4/18) was the first day that I've ever had Long John Silver's.. And it'll be the last. Sure, the food was good. Sure, it was fresh. However, it was way too oily for my liking. After one bite of my hush puppy, my lips were glossed with oil. Ech.. I don't know about you, but I would much rather eat food that won't make me feel overly guilty.  As for service, they took awhile to get my food, and I understand that since it's made to order. They were nice and all, but there were only about three people (from what I can see) working in here.   I don't know if I'll ever give LJS another try.. But I will be coming back for their A&W side of the restaurant!"}
{"text":"Great food and service. I've never had a complaint with long johns. It's a combo restaurant with KFC, so it appears as if long johns is like an appetizer menu. I always go with the fish and fries. I used to be able to eat fish, fries, chicken, shrimp, slaw, hush puppies and clams."}
{"text":"My husband & I placed an order at the drive up window at Long John Silvers / A & W at 732 N Nellis Blvd.  We had to repeat the order over and over.  Jennifer finally said just drive up to the window which we did.  We ordered a large root beer freeze, an oreo swirl & onion rings. She kept asking us how many hush puppies we wanted.  We would tell her \"no hush puppies\" and she would say \"WHAT\"  We gave her our order three times.  When she handed us the polar swirl, the cup was 2/3 full with a large swirl hole in the middle.  My husband showed this to her and asked her to fill the cup up.  She said that is the amount we were suppose to get,  that usuall they are in a small glass mug.  We asked her if they gave glass mugs away at the drive thru, she kept saying, \"WHAT\"  We finally gave up and drove home.  I called the number on the ticket and asked to speak to the manager, after a pause a woman answered and said, \"this is Jennifer.\"  It's hard to believe such an incompetent  employee would be able to keep a job let alone be a manager. I'm doubtful anything will be done concerning this until enough customers complain."}
{"text":"My man and I love long John silvers but there just aren't many around the valley. We drove over here and filled our LJS craving bellies. The workers there are so nice, and come around and check on you while you dine in to make sure you are happy with everything. Even brought us extra clams because they thought our basket was a little on the skimpy side. So happy we made the drive. Now nap time."}
{"text":"This location has no improvements at all, they are VERY slow at getting your order, also I have visited this place three times hoping things would be different but, nope, still dirty and not clean, this time was my LAST and FINAL time going here, the booths/chairs/tables all feel like they have a grim and gunk on them and yet they are \"cleaned\" so the staff says. I felt really gross sitting there, I should've left, but there are only TWO LJS locations in Vegas and both are horrible, its sad really. The food was hot but also over done, and the sides are KFC sides and not the LJS sides, I wish they would have a stand alone place instead of sharing with KFC, and also how sanitary is it when you see the staff preparing food and also washing and scrubbing the floors for the evening (I guess to speed up the clean up process) but I definitely will NOT be coming back here again. They should really consider keeping this place open...."}
{"text":"Very friendly employees! The sweet tea was great! The food was good for fast food fish, although I have chicken lol I love the hushpuppies with malt vinegar! The onion rings looked delicious and apparently they have a happy hour where shakes are only $2 which is pretty cool!"}
{"text":"well i have to say i gave this place 2 shots and i will never teturn a third time.  The store on windmill is usually dirty and when eating in with another person you get your food at different times.  nothing like eating with a friend with nothing in front of them.  Then go to their website and try and find hours of operation......NONE.... When i called to find out i was so surprised nobody answered the phone and the voice mail box was full...never again...  Oh and BTW the tarter sauce is the worst i was even willing to stop and get some at smiths."}
{"text":"Our experience here was not the best in many ways unfortunately. We just happen to be in the neighborhood while running some errands and hungry so we stopped.  This is not our first ride on the LJS train so we know what to expect as far as taste and quality of the food.  The place was empty however one customer in front of us trying to use a coupon with a new employee so that was a total disaster. We should have left after waiting 10 minutes in line to place our order however we were there and hungry so we waited and waited and waited some more.  Finally what appeared to be a Manager comes out and takes our order while the \"new\" employee is still fumbling and bumbling trying to understand how to input a coupon into the register.  It was frustrating for us to have to witness what this woman in front of us is going through trying to place her simple order.  No apologies to her or us for the long ridiculous wait.  The food just did not taste good either, the fish was not crisp as it usually is, the coleslaw tasted off and our root beer floats were not very floaty.  We will never return to this location, we only stopped here because it was near where we were running errands.  Common sense goes a very long way! It is too bad some people don't have common sense or manners in this industry. Also however they are storing or cooking the food should be up to par like the other LJS in town. This was the worst food we have ever eaten from a LJS and truly disappointing on so many levels.  Bad staff and bad food, no bueno!"}
{"text":"This was the worst experience I have ever had at LJS!!  We waited for over 30 minutes for our order as we watched people order after us get their food and leave.  The manager wouldn't even come out to talk with us!  The poor cashier had to deal with upset people !  I could have gone to a REAL restaurant and ordered and received our food in that amount of time ! When we asked why it was taking so long we were told that there were many orders in front of us but they 3 people in the store when we got there and the one car on the drive thru were helped and were gone in about 10 minutes ... so WHAT orders were there before us ???   The drive thru was busy when we left but those were after we placed and paid for our order and since only Taco Bell orders are now taken in the drive thru I would really like to know how our LJS order was placed AFTER all these other orders that came in AFTER ours !!! Any type of explanation or apology from management would have been appreciated but NONE was offered . NEVER going to this location again!!!!"}
{"text":"This is the same as Taco Bell. It's combined.    Service is slow. Don't be in a rush if you go here.  Drive through will also be slow. I mean, really slow most of the time.  Be surprised if it is fast.  I am astonished when it is.  Mostly kids work here as the case with most TBs."}
{"text":"Fried LJS is always great, but not healthy of course. The baked fish entrees are yummy, and healthier.  But portions are barely enough. I wish they would put out coupon sheets in the mail or newspaper more often like they used to. Prices are a little high for the meals that come with drinks.  10% corporate discount is nice, even though some of the personnel have to be reminded that it is still valid.  The managers always approve it.  Usually the restaurant is very clean.  I wish they had the small ice cubes that look like rabbit droppings. They changed it some time ago and now it is boring plain ice. Overall, a good place.  Prices just a little high."}
{"text":". What happened?  I'm confused.  About a couple things.  Beginning to eat our take-out, something just wasn't quite right.  The receipt---sure enough---said Long John Silver's.  Then how was it possible that it tasted as delectable as $$$ Halibut dinners from Delmonico's in Independence?   Got me.  Ignore the negative reviews.  Done.  Boom.  Whatever.  A delightful surprise.  I had re-discovered Long John Silver's.  Once upon an afternoon drive down Brookpark on my way home, and knowing it was nearing time for sustenance, I spotted Long John's up ahead.   Some FISH---a favorite food stuff in our household---would be a perfect choice.  It had been many years since we ate at a LJS (one time...North Olmsted) because I was The Official Home Kitchen Fish Frier in town.  (Seven Seas...Lake Erie Perch)  While watching those prices going up, up, and UP---now at $15.99 per pound---and our *other* favorite Lake Erie Perch destination, the Red Lantern at Kamm's Corners, now closed---but hopefully, only temporarily---I fignured it was worth the gamble.  Other last minute fried fish pick-ups at the usual Big Name Fast Food suspects, always seemed to disappoint.   This one likely would, too, but it was right THERE...on my way HOME...so at the last moment I pulled in.     The Stars, the Planets, and my SUV, were indeed, fortuitously aligned.   ~  EXCELLENT lightly-battered fried moist Cod (or might have been Pollock or other mild whitefish) ~  EXCELLENT hushpuppies.  Never thought I'd ever write THOSE two words together.  Ultimate oxymoron.  The few I've had over the years were all positively nasty dry floury balls of horrid.  Until now. ~  Fries and Tartar also far better than most others serving same. ~  One of the nicest ever employees.  So naturally comfortably friendly with me.  Maybe I knew her...or met her somewhere else.  Could be, but probably not.  Just a nice person.  Pulled up reviews for the first time---just before writing mine.  Wow.  If I had read them beforehand---with the exception of Craig L.'s fairly recent 4 star---I would have probably sailed right past this fish food find.   Hope you have a remarkable visit like I did, and if you have, give LJS a break and help boost their star power by adding your reviews.  They deserve more positives.     I'm all for buying \"local\", but my definition also includes \"local humans\" who work in Chains and Big Boxes.   We can't forget about THEM---they have bills to pay and families to feed, TOO. ."}
{"text":"The only thing fast about this fast food joint is the employee turnover.  Long waits in line and understaffed by people who don't want to be there.  Truly dreadful."}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible customer service. The guy was SO rude to his fellow employee and also me! When I ordered my food, he rolled his eyes right in front of me and made a nasty comment that what I ordered was stupid because it'll cost more than if I got it as a combo. I will NEVER come here again, and I hope this place shuts down like the rest of them. Wish I could do 0 stars."}
{"text":"First, no sign before you pull into the drive-thru telling you that you need to go inside for LJS. I understand that taking the time to cook the food takes longer than normal, but how is letting someone ahead of you make a $40 Taco Bell order and making you wait 15 minutes in line behind them?  Kid working the counter was really nice, however. The other worker that brought my food out had zero personality and displayed no enthusiasm for his job at all.  The food was good, but have had better luck in other locations. Do yourself a favour and make the drive to Casa Grande, or Winslow for better service. The native guy in Winslow that helped me last time actually mixed the fried batter crumblies with the hushpuppy batter and they were amazing!"}
{"text":"Only giving 1 star so I can put review I know...its my fault,  a year ago went here French fries were green.  Administrative staff (online)  they was great, even contacted me and apologized, the manager there was a complete jerk. So after a 12 hour shift I see. Long John's commercial, hey it's been a while, so I drive my 5 miles, go through drive thru, get home...wrong order. 5 miles back.....(one way). Manager is outside on the phone, I go inside show them my receipt he makes my order. Comes back and says \"I gave you 3 xtra shrimp.\"  Then they throw the old order away.  My fault, I should not of never went  back, after the first incident. just had a craving.  So after a total of 20 miles, and an hour later, I now have my food. Very disappointed.   Not even, \"I apologize\" nothing but 3 shrimp. What is happening to customer service? I'm gonna eat now, only because I couldn't let them keep the food and get a refund.  I really hate leaving bad reviews, but this is ridiculous."}
{"text":"It doesn't deserve 1 star. Wait staff have no customer service skills at all!! Worst place ever!!!"}
{"text":"Best Long John Silver's I've ever been to. So crunchy and fresh, Crispy. Ask for Jorge, he'll give you great customer service and satisfaction guaranteed!"}
{"text":"Why am I always stopping at fast food?? I'm giving this place 4 stars I have no idea why. I'm a softie. I like long john silvers tho! I had a coupon so that's kind of only why I went there. It's kinda overpriced and soooooper salty, like the batter is way salty, but, you know, kinda delicious. I got the kids meal with 1 fish plank, a hush puppy and crunchelies in the bottom. I got my choice of side and I was able to have ONION RINGS! They were so good, but good like from a booth at the county fair. I got a tiny plastic cup like a kid. Kids meal was great. If you choose to eat more LJS than a kids meal you are whackadoo. Plus don't drink so much pop like a giant size, you could get a kidney stone or something.   The place is DIRTY! STICKY! Dag! I keep thinking I should knock it down to a 3 stars.... But there aren't too many left, and onion rings tho... Little pirate hats... :) it also seems to have a slight laxative effect. That could be good or bad tho! 4 stars baby! The staff is nice. Just don't tell anyone I went there it is embarrassing."}
{"text":"Fast food Seafood!  This is a chain restaurant that seems to be everywhere around these parts.  Fried shrimps were da bomb!  Hush puppies were hella good too.  Nothing special about the fries.  This place hooks it up with the fried foods - Way too much batter for me though.  This place isn't in the greatest area.  However, inside was very clean - tables were wiped down and all.  Some of the fountain drinks were not working.  The manager from Fremont, CA. was awesome - greeted us with a smile, was friendly, and made us feel welcome.  He even rang the bell by the door as we walked out - Kool dude!  Someone...give this man a raise!  Will be back...thx."}
{"text":"I was in the mood for root beer, weird craving I know and I headed here on my lunch break. I got in line in the drive thru and waited and waited and waited for someone to take my order. No dice, so I was hoping to just back out of the drive thru but someone had already pulled in behind me so I pulled forward in line. Unfortunately I was now stuck between several cars and I had yet to put my order in. The process was so slow and each car ahead of me was waiting there for what seemed like forever. After about 15-20 I finally got to the window and was tempted to just leave but I had been waiting for so long I wanted my order and wanted to let them know that the speaker wasn't working.   The girl at the window came to help me and looked at me puzzled since I hadn't placed an order. I informed her that no one was answering at the ordering thingy-majig and she immediately realized she had shut it off by mistake. She looked horrified and offered me a discount for my trouble, so I figured I'd just order my drink and an order of cheese curds (since all the ads on the side of the building that I had been staring at for 20 minutes now had me curious). I paid and the price seemed low, but since she said she was giving me a discount, I didn't think twice. Finally my order came out and she handed me my cheese curds, no root beer. I then realized she didn't even hear my order for the root beer and by this point I was totally over it and just left.   This place is inefficient and so unorganized. No thank you."}
{"text":"Long John Silver's that's false advertising when they advertise that they have fries with their fish I have yet to go to a Long John Silver's that has fries false advertising and even the KFC store locations don't have fries. Don't advertise fish and chips if you have no (chips) meaning fries."}
