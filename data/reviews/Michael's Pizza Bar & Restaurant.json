{"text":"A gem hidden in the busy South Side of Pittsburgh, this bar and restraunt lies hidden off of East Carson Street. I placed a to go order for their turkey club pizza, but did have a chance to check out the place when I picked it up, and have to say that I really liked it; 4-6 small tables on the left wall with a long traditional wooden bar on the right (with dining seating further back), it felt cozy and very welcoming. The crowd was a very interesting mix, some elderly folks enjoying a meal, some young couples on dates, and even a few ladies out for the night, but not at all the collegiate atmosphere that usually accompanies dining in the south side. Now to the main event: the pizza! Wow, was it delicious! Loaded with cheese, lettuce, turkey, and bacon, on top of a thin layer of tomato sauce, it more than impressed me (for those familiar, it tasted like a delicious turkey Devonshire sandwich)! After 2 slices I was full and satisfied, leaving me with another meal for the next day. I lived this dish and will definitely be trying another one of their specialty pies!"}
{"text":"Pizza is awesome here!  This place is hidden and I never even knew it was here!  I went there for lunch with some friends and it's such a nice little pizza/bar restaurant.  It reminded me going to my friends grandmothers house. It has that old bar feel, but to smell.  I suggest anyone who wants some good pizza to try this place out!"}
{"text":"So damn good last time I was here.. Had to come back and get more! What a great place. No crowds and very friendly people."}
{"text":"I hadn't been to Michael's Pizza on Sarah Street in a few years. When I found a 50 percent off a large pizza coupon in the Enjoy book I decided to try it again. The pizza is very good, particularly the crust. The toppings were ample too. I really like their ground up sausage, which is a bit spicy, and their hot pepper rings. The sauce isn't the best I've had, it's kind of like a thicker spaghetti sauce, which makes the pizza a bit dry. If you like a good amount of sauce on your pie I'd recommend asking for extra sauce. As a side note, even with the 50 percent coupon the pie was a bit pricey. I'm assuming the coupon isn't valid for toppings. Otherwise, a good solid choice for pizza on the South Side."}
{"text":"Our favorite neighbor joint, a welcoming atmosphere, friendly and attentive staff, and great pizza!

We come every week and feel right at home every time.  

The noise levels are ideal for a conversation, and I love the unpretentious environment."}
{"text":"We went in here one night when we kind of stumbled upon it by accident while driving in the South Side.  Very casual atmosphere, lots of big screen TVs, quick and friendly service that isn't overly attentive nor was it non existent.  \"Hockey puck\" was delicious, pizza was great, Blue Moons were super fresh and delicious.  Very reasonable price, too!  Maybe our new favorite place!"}
{"text":"Great little place on a side street of the southside that you should not pass up.   Pizza was very good, loaded with toppings for a really fair price.   Twistee's were delicious too.    Service was excellent and beyond friendly !!"}
{"text":"Very, very good. The hockey puck was a great warm-up to my Li'l Charli 8\" pizza. The sauce and crust were perfect!"}
{"text":"This place blows!  Id rather have a rectal exam by jerry s***usky than go here!"}
{"text":"Great food and a real family experience. The pizza is amazing, I've been coming here for 18 years"}
{"text":"We went in this past Thursday night after traveling all day.  Its legit.  The service was really good and so was the pizza.  We went back before we left pitts for san diego.  Glad the front desk suggested this place to us.  Its not really a touristy spot so we definitely got some weird looks when we first walked in haha.  But it was worth it.  Its a really good spot for some pizza with the fam or friends.  My son is a super picky eater (yes he has even passed on pizza before) but he loved the pizza here."}
{"text":"Visiting from out of town with my daughter and went to Michaels because it had good reviews, was close to where my daughter wanted to shop, and she wanted pizza. Pizza is of course very subjective. She would give Michaels a 4 because she loved the crust and the cheese. I also loved the crust and cheese, but like more sauce. We both liked the atmosphere and we both were uncomfortably hot inside. Maybe no AC is normal for Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"We have been coming to this restaurant for years and love it.  The 80 cent Thursday slices are now a family tradition.  The pizza is very cheesy and my favorite in town. The wait staff is excellent and friendly. It's certainly not a fancy place to eat, but it's a comfortable place with good food."}
{"text":"A local joint off of E Carson street.  My girlfriend lives near by so we go when we can.  Nothing fancy, just cheep drinks, good pizza, and a great staff.  A+"}
{"text":"Pizza and wings were good, staff was very friendly. We didn't order any of the calzones but they looked really good, will try them next visit."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh because of the specials that they have. How can you argue with 80 cent pizza slices? The sandwiches are delicious but the appetizers are probably the best thing on the menu... My favorite is the pepperoni rolls and the chicken sandwich lunch special!"}
{"text":"Solid pizza and great prices.  The pizza has just the right amount of dough, cheese, sauce, and preferred toppings.  This is what I consider pan style pizza non- thick variety...good stuff!  The atmosphere here is more dive bar but cozy at the same time.  Service is good...jukebox in the corner.  I like this spot."}
{"text":"OK. So, I'm looking at all of these 4 and 5 star ratings of this place and I've come to the conclusion that there is truly no accounting for taste. Yes, it is a neighborhood bar, cute, quaint. If you want that sort of ambiance, that's fine. The pizza and hoagies are OK, just that - OK. I've had better, I've had worse. Try it and decide for yourself. If you want to justify your \"taste test,\" there is a coupon in the Enjoy Book, as someone else pointed out."}
{"text":"big fan of the pizza here and they offer some interesting specialty options. I opted for the personal buffalo chicken pizza and it did not disappoint. the pepperoni pizza was delicious (we added onion) and our salads had an admirable pile of cheese on top. will definitely be back at Michael's soon"}
{"text":"WAY affordable. atmosphere is your typical pittsburgh dive, but they have windows which is more than you can say for some places. 

pizza and other food = decent+ very very cheap

bar = dive-y + somewhat dirty

pizza-shaped clock = awesome!"}
{"text":"Easily Pittsburgh's best pizza - generous with their toppings and reasonable with their prices!!!
GET THE SPECIALTY PIZZAS! Especially the Turkey Club - with a serve of knots, serves 4 people for about $25!"}
{"text":"I come up to Pittsburgh about twice a year to see a friend, and go to Michael's Pizza Bar every time. It's our fave. We love the pierogie pizza!! The wings are really good too; great flavor!"}
{"text":"Cool location but I found the pizza to be kinda average. The Italian hoagie was good. Parking was a nightmare."}
{"text":"Pizza was good but took a lot of time to prepare so I would've expected it to be better. Will definitely eat here again"}
{"text":"Great place, go here every time I am in Pitt. I recommend the twisties , as I and my family are obsessed with them. Don't eat a whole lot of them because you'll be full before your actual meal. Although the twisties can be your meal.....
Our waitress, Tracy, was a professional. She handled our requests perfectly and was very nice.
Would recommend"}
{"text":"YES! Yes all around! I have had SUCH a struggle with my boyfriend trying to find good tasting, non-greasy, PROPER pizza close to our apartment since I moved in JANUARY to the burgh. It took until just a few weeks ago to finally try this place and I swear I might have actually teared upon seeing and tasting the first bite. I have spent COUNTLESS HOURS perusing for the perfect pizza joint to make our go-to and I am so thrilled to say that this is it. We REFUSE to live in the city and ever order Pizza Hut, dominos or something mainstream when part of the allure of the city is eating what non city folks can't readily get! There are a TON of pizza places on East Carson where we live, and they're mostly all greasy drunk bites. Michael's is top notch. Get pizza and garlic twist, you won't be disappointed! Thanks for saving us from pizza limbo!!"}
{"text":"My Boyfriend and I had just returned from a Trip to NYC and it was NYE.  We wanted something delicious, but quick without having a crazy prices for NYE and needed a reservation.  I live a few blocks from this place and every time I am at Aldi I drive past on the way home and think I should really try this place.

The service was excellent, we sat at the bar and ordered possibly the cheapest grey goose and sodas ever ($5)!!!  We ordered twisties at the suggestion of yelpers and a small pizza.  The twisties are their version of a bread stick and wow are they great!  Light, fluffy, and the perfect amount of garlic and oil.  I took the remaining home and used them as bread in my breakfast egg casserole, it was over the top amazing!

The pizza was great as well and tasted great the next morning cold (always the requirement for good pizza).  Between the 2 of us we drink 6 drinks, 1 sm pizza, and twisties, out bill was $38!  I can't remember the last time I ate and got tipsy for less than $40 for 2 people.  Check this great little family owned joint on the south side for your next pizza craving."}
{"text":"Great local pub on the south side.  Off the beaten path.  Street parking.  Friendly casual atmosphere.  Lots of TVs for watching sports.  Full bar.   Love the old world oak bar - adds to the ambience.  Many specialty pizzas, also hoagies and calzones.  Individual sizes.  Pizza was good - thin crust.  Huge salad with fresh shaved mozzarella cheese.  Pizza did not blow me away but lots of other items on the menu I would like to try.  Plan on returning next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Great little neighborhood bar & grille; old school, but warm and inviting inside. I happened to stop in on dollar burger night so I could not resist ~ seriously? $1 for a perfectly respectable burger? This might be my new watering hole! The bar maid was friendly and the customers, the usual mix of young guys, couples and groups of friends. I was pleased to see a diverse mix of ages & races, male & female. If you are looking for something low key & casual i would definitely recommend this pub!"}
{"text":"The dough they use is wonderful.  The Thursday special is 50 cent slices: just sit down and tell your waitress how many and what you want to drink with them.  This was a favorite lunch outing when I worked in the South Side.  Other recommended menu items are the Twisties (soft, baked sticks of pizza dough you can drip in marinara sauce) and the Hockey Puck (a hockey puck shaped lump of deep fried dough drowned in marinara sauce).

You automatically get cool points for eating here since it isn't directly on Carson Street, but be forewarned that this alone does not prevent the place from getting crowded, especially on Thursdays.

I once ordered a calzone from Michael's and ate it over the course of two days.  Those were a good two days."}
{"text":"So the guys in my office LOVE this place.  I still can't tell if it is due to the $0.80 slices on Thursdays or if they really think this is the best pizza around.

The pizza was passable.  I've had much worse in the 'Burgh and I've had MUCH better.  This pizza, to me, was definitely worth the $0.80/slice that I paid for it.  It wasn't greasy, it wasn't too doughey, it was cooked well, but didn't have much flavor (we had plain cheese pizza).  It could have used some more sauce (especially since this is where the bulk of the flavor for the plain pizza is coming from).  It left me feeling very \"meh, that was ok\" about my lunch.  
 
What else can I say about it?  It was a great place with a great vibe.  Would I go back?  Sure, but I probably want to see a menu next time.  I could think of several places in Pittsburgh that I would rather have pizza, but none in the South Side."}
{"text":"We decided to try Michael's Pizza Bar & Restaurant one sunny Saturday this past summer.  A little off the beaten path running through the South Side you will find this little treasure.  First impressions, it's a quaint neighborhood bar.  The kind of place that if you live close you probably frequent.  I was really excited to try Michael's after hearing about their pizza. So that is where we laid our attention.

We ordered a large pie half cheese (for him) and the other half mushroom, onions, and banana peppers (for me).  Now I am like every other red blooded American, but pizza doesn't usually impress me.  It's ok, great to eat with beer, but I could never eat it regularly.  When I get pizza I like it to be thin crust, crisp, almost stand on its own, with veggies.  That being said Michael's delivered not only a pretty chill atmosphere but a pretty tasty pie.  Matt really liked the crust and the sauce.  I enjoyed the flavors as well, especially since they do not skimp on the toppings at all.  There was a plethora of veggies piled atop my pie.  This was good but came with its own set of challenges as the toppings weighed the pizza down, so there went my stand on its own factor.  That was ok it was still very scrumptious.  The one thing I really wish they would have done was use fresh mushrooms and not the canned ones.   

Funny thing happened as we were eating and enjoying some brews.  A couple with a few kids pulled up outside.  They left the door of their SUV open as their kids slept in the car while they had some pie at the outdoor table.  I laughed cause I would totally do the same thing."}
{"text":"Good hoagies, great pizza.  I highly recommend any of their specialty pizzas.  Their pierogie pizza is second to none and the turkey club pizza can't be beat.  Even when they are busy, the kitchen has a pretty quick turn around.  It's a great little place to hang out or just to get a pie to go."}
{"text":"Michael's is such a great go-to option in the Southside. There are so many trendy restaurants with craft cocktails and huge draft lists, and those are great! But when you want something that will without a doubt be quick, delicious, and affordable, you can always rely on Michael's! As delicious as their food is, I do also really enjoy just hanging out at the bar. It's an awesome low key place!

I would really recommend that whatever you get, you get an order of Twistees too! The Little Charlie meal is always a great choice, but you really can't go wrong with anything!"}
{"text":"Solid Pittsburgh bar, with friendly employees and decent food. When my boyfriend and I visited, I think our expectations were way too high. We were expecting pizza that would blow us away, which made us a little disappointed. It's NOT that it was bad- it certainly was not. It's just not the next Mineo's or Fiori's or Aiello's. The prices were SO cheap, which I really appreciate, and the fries were fresh cut and super tasty. The pizza was good, and we did enjoy it. We were a little disappointed to learn that their ranch isn't homemade.. we are big suckers for delicious homemade ranch. Although we weren't blown away with our experience, it certainly wasn't a bad experience and we are looking forward to coming here to try out a special one night. The location is nice because it's off of busy East Carson and they even have outdoor seating. The service was very friendly when we came, which is always a plus."}
{"text":"I used to live across the the street before all the new development and this place was a secret gem. I still love them! All their food has never disappointed me. Pizza with the perfect amount of sauce, wing dings fried to perfection, prices: awesomeness. I love this place and always will."}
{"text":"This bar was tucked away off the main strip but it is worth the detour!!!!! The food was absolutely amazing! Make sure you get the breadsticks and the lil mini pizza. The sauce was very good. The portions are HUGE!!!! The loaded fries sure were loaded and the fries were fresh cut!!!! Do not miss this spot if you are in south side!"}
{"text":"I ate here because I wanted to try something new on the South Side.
It's behind a parking lot in the newer section.
It's a small local bar with a homey feel.
I already ate but I decided to try the pizza twists.
There was a lot of them with cheese and garlic and sauce.
They were made well, very light and fluffy,  but I wasn't blown away by the sauce."}
{"text":"Michael's must be short for Michelangelo's because the buffalo chicken pizza was a work of art!! Michael's has delicious food a friendly/helpful wait staff. The modest interior sets a comfortable environment, and the pizza and it's incredible flavors will make you not want to leave. I would urge everyone to give michaels a shot."}
{"text":"I think therefore I am...a pizza fan.  I just made a rhyme, wish I could do that every time.  See what I did there?

Michael's the quintessential neighborhood restaurant.  It is large enough to accommodate a crowd without losing it's intimacy.  We went on Friday (3/2/12) and there were two delightful people working and we were always well-attended.  And then there's the pizza...

My friend and I split a buffalo chicken pizza.  I commiserate with you if you've never tried such a pizza and feel you should rectify the situation; Michael's is a fantastic place to do so.  The crust was perfect--slightly doughy on the inside with just enough crustiness on the outside.  The cheese was solid enough so it stayed on the pizza yet was compliant enough to get those beloved strings when pulling your bite from the remaining slice.  The top surface was blanketed with perfectly cooked chicken.  Finally, the buffalo (in lieu of marinara) sauce had a great flavor, enough heat to keep you on your toes but not so much to kill your taste buds and preventing your pizza bliss.  Describing the ingredients doesn't quite do the pie justice--there is definitely pizza synergy going on here.

Alas, I do have to knock one start from the rating because this is a BAR and restaurant.  In my opinion, bars have evolved into carrying a large selection of beer and typically have more than a few taps.  Although I didn't do a thorough search, it seemed as though Michael's only carried the typical domestics that I have grown to disdain.  Pretentious?  Perhaps, but it's what I like.  In saying that, Michael's appears to keep it's corner bar image with a close, local clientele who may prefer domestic beer.  If so, Michael's caters to their customers' tastes and I commend them.

Try this place for your next pizza craving."}
{"text":"It's a small Establishment that packs a big punch for favor. Get the twissties!!! The small canzone is as big as a head!"}
{"text":"I went here yesterday on a whim based off of the Yelp ratings. I must say, it definitely lived up to the ratings! 

We got a pepperoni pizza and the seasoned wings. The pizza sauce and dough were very good. The sauce was tangy and the dough was just the right consistency. I did think the pizza was too greasy, though (partially remedied by sopping up some of the grease with the dabbing napkin technique). I don't usually like sauceless/dry rub wings, but these were actually tasty! Not sure what exactly they put on them, but they were nice and crispy with sort of a seasoning salt flavor.

The other great thing about this place is the super cheap beer: a Yuengling and Shock Top draft for $2.50 each. Awww yeaah.

If you find yourself in the South Side and hungry for some pizza, check out Michaels."}
{"text":"Great place a gemstone in south side! I mean can't beat the 80 cent slice of pizza on Thursdays !!"}
{"text":"This is a review I didn't ever want to write.  This place is just too good. You know, pizza is something we all have a standard against which all others are measured. And the search for that perfect pizza is much like the search for the fountain of youth - elusive but clearly worthwhile. Michael's has restored my faith that perhaps that fountain of youth does exist - the perfect pizza certainly does! And Michael's has it! Sure, there's good pizza all over the place. But there's only one BEST pizza. I've had pizza all over Pittsburgh, all over the US (NYC, Chicago, SoCal...) and all over Europe including Italy. I've had Monte Cello's VIncent's, Domenico's, Luciano's, Mineo's, and all the chains - although I do like Piccolo Forno's too. My search has not been half-hearted nor without focus. I stumbled upon Michaels about 8 years ago and hit the motherlode. When I want pizza, I'm willing to drive the 25 miles from the north hills to the south side just to sit and enjoy my favorite pizza with a pitcher of Yuengling in a comfy bar atmosphere.

I wanted to keep this place to myself, not to tell anyone about it. After all, hidden gems are meant to remain hidden, right? Otherwise people swarm in and spoil a good thing. No one wants to go somewhere where everyone goes!! But alas, I find myself after 8 years of going here as a regular, finally wanting to shout it out!! THIS IS GREAT PIZZA!!! 

Two blocks off Carson street on Sarah, it's off the beaten path and is not a place you're likely to just happen upon. You have to look for it. But once you do, you'll be hooked. First off, the crust is perfect, not too thin, not thick and doughy. It's a delight. The sauce is what make it. One thing I know it's sauce. And this is remarkable. Order the twisty's as an appetizer - parmesan dusted baked dough twists that are to die for - and you'll get a side of the sauce. Go ahead, dip in. You'll thank me. I could eat a bowl of that sauce with a tablespoon. And ask for more. This pizza just kills!! And if Meghan is working there, you'll be treated to the best service with a smile. She is absolutely the best. Good pizza, good service, good beer, good atmosphere. I call that JACKPOT!! What more could you want? 

If I have to wait for a table next time, I'll know I should have kept this secret to myself!!"}
{"text":"Classic little bar feel with some of the best pizza iv had in the area, whether it's the gourmet pies or the $.80 cheese slices on Thursdays. The only thing they could improve on is a better beer selection. There's only two or three beers on draft and bottles in a fridge, but its all usually BMC and Yuengling"}
{"text":"I finally had the pleasure of going to Michael's... it was nothing like what I had expected for some reason but that is not a bad thing. 

The service was good, the food was good, and the atmosphere was comfortable.  I just think there is better pizza around.  I will add though that we did not venture to try the Specialty pizzas, rather we just had a basic traditional pizza.  The pepperoni roll was good.... although the sauce that was served with it was cold (not even room temp).  I thought that this was a tad odd.  Otherwise, it was all a good experience!"}
{"text":"I'll have to update this review after trying some other things on the menu. 

We stopped in for burger night (Monday) $1 burgers which include lettuce & tomato. All other toppings are 25cents.  I ordered mine with cheese, bacon & pickles. The burger was good especially for the deal. We also ordered the cheese fries which were tasty. I love fresh cut fries so I enjoyed them. Next time for burger night i'll probably order 2 but i honestly was full off of one burger and sharing our cheese fry.

The servers was nice as well. I will stop by again soon since it's so close to home."}
{"text":"this is the best pizza I have had in Pittsburgh! The pepperoni pizza was prefect. we ordered the twisties as well which were amazing. The bartender was very nice and the prices were great. Definitely worth a trip to the south side!"}
{"text":"Let's be honest, I don't go to Michale's for the pizza (although it is perfectly doughy yet has a crispy bottom crust ). I go to Michael's for the TWISTIES! They are their signature dough slathered with garlic butter and Parmesan cheese, twisted together, and baked to perfection. I find myself craving them. Get there! And order the twisties!"}
{"text":"Best pizza I've ever had. No question.

I lived in the South Side for a few years, and I would eat at Michael's every weekend. I was a regular to the point that when I'd walk in, they wouldn't even bring me a menu, they'd just put in my order. Even after I moved to the North Side, I would still try to make the trip for the best pizza in Pittsburgh. 

While the restaurant itself isn't fancy, modern, or fussy (although they underwent some minor renovations in the past 2 years), the food is crave worthy. As appetizers go, it's hard to go wrong with the twistees. Ahhh, the twistees. Michael's delicious dough twisted into golden ribbons, dusted with Parmesan and baked until perfect. Served with the best pizza sauce I've ever had the pleasure of devouring. The hockey puck is also a pretty excellent prelude to your pizza. A seasoned, golden brown fried chunk of deliciousness shaped like a...well, you get the idea.  The pizza is perfection. The sauce is outrageously good, the cheese is a great quality, creamy blend, and the dough is consistently perfectly cooked. I could eat a whole pizza, it's THAT good. In fact, I have eaten a whole medium pizza in one sitting during the Michael's Pizza Challenge. Just to get a silly tshirt. I'm still proud of my accomplishment!

The service is always great, Megan is an especially attentive and personable waitress. Great place to watch a game, grab a pitcher, and enjoy the finest pizza in Pittsburgh.

P.S. Michael's, I miss you...I'll be back once I'm off my diet :)"}
{"text":"Definitely coming back!  The pizza is amazing!!
We first ordered the twisties, which were delightfully light and fluffy. Not greasy at all!!  
For dinner we got the Large Turkey Club pizza and first off, it was huge.  There are toppings on toppings and so much cheese!!!!  Loved it!  The dough was again light and fluffy and despite the amount of cheese and bacon, it was not very greasy. All of this plus drinks came in under $27.  Such a hidden gem on the southside. Nothing fancy, but with pizza this good, it doesn't need to be."}
{"text":"I got a calzone here (buffalo chicken)!  It was huge and delicious. We also ordered the twisters.  They were amazing. The sauce was delicious.  My friend and I could have probably just gotten one calzone and the twisters with plenty of leftovers, but with the prices being so reasonable we both got our own calzone and split the twisters.  The pizza looked amazing too, and big.  Not to mention, the people who work here are nice and laid back.  Great place to get pizza in Pittsburgh! Very very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Good little place, good food, good price would go back. I got a Stromboli it had a lot of meat  and cheese very tasty. Can't wait to go back for lunch again."}
{"text":"Such a sweet little place! We ordered the Buffalo Chicken Pizza, Chicken Quesadilla, and an order of 5 chicken wings. The best thing was definitely the pizza! Best buffalo pizza I've ever had!"}
{"text":"The biggest issue we had and what made us leave sooner than we wanted were the myriad fruit flies buzzing around around the bar area.

Visited Michael's Pizza Bar mid June 2013 with a friend. We sat at the bar and were quickly helped. The service was great. We ordered the french fries (they were out of jalapeños) and a sausage and banana pepper pizza. We received the fries and the pizza at the same time. No problem...but the cook piled so many peppers on the pizza one couldn't see the pizza. The crust and sauce were good, but I found the sausage to be wanting."}
{"text":"Oh, Michael's. Lovely delicious Michael's. I have long drawn out dreams about the crispy crust, the perfect amount of sauce, and bubbly slightly burnt cheese.

I feel the real test of a pizza place is a plain cheese of a pepperoni pizza. Michael's goes above and beyond on that pizza alone. Not too greasy. On our last venture we decided to branch out and try the... Mashed Potato Pizza. While not an all the time option, it was amazing. Michael's regular crust topped with mashed potatoes, covered in cheddar and mozzarella cheese, real bacon, and a (as much as I hate this word) dollop of sour cream. Beautiful. 

In additional to the great pizza, they have cheap beers too. The usual liquor options too.

The interior is small but cozy. It has the appearance of a dive bar, but I don't think I'd call it a dive. They have a lot of kitschy decor. Pizza pillows on the window seat, a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle's Pizza Time clock. The first room has the bar and a few tables, there is also a little room to the back where more tables are located if you don't want to sit in the bar area. They've got a few tv's so if you're into sports you can stay updated as well.  Keep in mind Wednesday is 50 cent wing night and Thursday night's are the pizza special so those two nights can get a little packed. 

My only other tip would be that while Yelp says they deliver, and my friend's confirm that sometime's they have in the past, when I called and asked they told me no. So, that may be a hit or miss situation.

Just look for the red neon Michael's sign off the beaten path of Carson Street."}
{"text":"In all my visits to Pittsburgh, it was actually surprising that I'd never been here. My friends live within an easy walking distance and consider Michael's to be a favorite. After our dinner, I can clearly understand why. Michael's pizza tastes like childhood. How does that work, you ask? Stay with me on this one.

Imagine your favorite childhood pizza. You remember the smell, the taste, that feeling when that first bite passes your teeth. Now imagine the cheese, piping hot and bubbling. Do you see it now? That's how pizza tastes like childhood. Michael's pizza served that purpose for me. From the first bite I took, I was back in the early 90s. Michael's is lucky to have their pizza be the crowning glory, because the wings really weren't anything to sing home about. Granted, I'm very particular about my wings, but I know what I like. Also, skip the salad, unless you really like iceberg lettuce. I prefer a darker green with my pizza. Finally, this isn't a place you go to expecting an extensive beer list, so keep that in mind.

I'm glad my friends have Michael's in their neighborhood because everyone needs a solid pizza place nearby. It's great to have an easy flashback option in the form of piping hot pizza."}
{"text":"Michael's Pizza Bar has pizza that is virtually unmatched. The crust, sauce, everything is perfect. The prices are great and the staff is so friendly. 

I used to live in Pittsburgh and would come here regularly on Saturday afternoons with my family. The server got to know our family and we always looked forward to catching up with her. Now that I'm in Chicago with tons of pizza options, Michael's still ranks towards the very best I've had. I make sure to dine here when I come back in town. 

Do yourself a favor- start with the twistys. I'm drooling just thinking about them."}
{"text":"Michael's is always a good cheap place to visit if in the South Side. It's nothing fancy and you won't find a four course meal, but it does the trick and that's all that really matters! 

If you're into traditional bar food and pizza, then this place is for you! They have great simple choices (with the exception of crazy pizza toppings) and you will most definitely find something that will satisfy your hunger. The atmosphere is a step above dive. It was a Friday night and there were a few people at the bar and and most tables were filled with only one bartender/server. I do think they should have had at least one other staff member behind the bar helping out. We ended up sitting outside at one of their outdoor tables. It was a beautiful night and we wanted to take advantage of the evening.

I ordered a personal pizza with green peppers and a basket of cheese fries. The pizza was cooked perfectly and I loved how they shredded the peppers very thin. The fries were great because you don't find many places that give you that fresh cut/Potato Patch type of fry. It was long overdue! My boyfriend ordered a buffalo chicken sandwich with chips and a beer. He mentioned that it was okay, nothing special. The bun looked like a regular old sandwich bun you could have got in a plastic bag at Giant Eagle. I think the sandwich would have been more appetizing with a more gourmet type of bun. Still, for the price, you can't go wrong! The total bill was only $20!"}
{"text":"This place is great! Cheap, good pizza! There is nothing pretentious about Michael's and that is what makes it great! The pizza has a great crust and they don't skimp on the toppings! While the food is delicious on its own, the specials are the star of the place! They have 80 cent plain pizza slices on Thursdays! Nothing beats good pizza at a great price!!"}
{"text":"I lived in Brooklyn and Staten Island most of my adult life. Ate pizza at least twice a week for lunch and once a week for dinner. With that said this would be above average pizza in my old stomping grounds. Great crust, quality mozz and tasty sauce. Cheap too. Add in the oldtime neighborhood bar feel and you get a great lunch and dinner experience."}
{"text":"I love this Pizza.  I grew up in Carrick near Sunseri's pizza on Custer Ave.  I believe this place has or at one time had a family connection to that place.  They are similar, but unique enough to warrant a trip if you like Sunseri's.  The pizza is good, the sauce has a nice tangy oregano taste, bordering on sour, but in a good way.  The crust is soft and chewy.

If you go here and get nothing else, get the twisties.  They're hands down in the upper crust, pun intended, of bread sticks I've had.

Wings are good and tangy, but basic.  I prefer more depth of flavor than just buffalo, but they were cooked well, sauced properly and tasty.

They have some good specials too, slice nights, and hoagie deals.

Lastly, for some reason, I think that their fountain sodas are the best I've ever had.  No cola has ever tasted as good was what came from their fountain.  A small detail, but a perk nonetheless.

I've never had the salads there, but they look fantastic."}
{"text":"Great pizza, the twistees are delicious and the pricing is affordable. The personal calzone is enough to feed 2 people. The atmosphere is great. I especially like how it's a bar and pizza place."}
{"text":"This is Pittsburgh pizza.  

Medium-ish crust, lots of cheese, good bit of sauce.  The price is right and I love it.  We always order half pepperoni/half sausage and it's delicious.  The service here is exactly what you expect for a divey Pittsburgh Pizza bar - very friendly and fast.  I only take it down a star because the ranch isn't homemade and that's upsetting to me :)  Also wish the mushrooms were fresh, but WHATEVER, still tastes good!"}
{"text":"Every day but Thursday: Hi, yes. No, I don't need a menu. I'd like the buffalo chicken little charlie. Oh, it comes with a drink? Raspberry iced tea, please.

Thursday: Hi, yes. No, I don't need a menu. I'd like the buffa--oh, what? It's .80 cent slice day? I'd like 8 slices, please. And a water.

(I also like the pepperoni roll, and the chicken sandwich, and the daily special, and a grilled cheese with a side of marinara, and the wedgies are hoagies made with pizza dough, and you really can't go wrong but that buffalo chicken little charlie is enough to regenerate your soul)."}
{"text":"I think I can sum up this review in one sentence: I live within a 2 min walk, have tried this place twice (always wiling to give a second chance), and would never ever go back--not even if it were free. That's it. 

I'll also add they don't take pizza seriously enough to include it in their name. The sauce is flavorless and the cheese nothing to write home about. The dough tastes undercooked. Basically imagine pizza at a school cafeteria, and you've got Michael's."}
{"text":"I've been here twice so far and love the pizza. However, the service is not as great. Both times they accidentally slid the pizza off the plate onto the bar, but I was too hungry and nice for them to make another. My friend and I also had to explain what the ingredients were to the drinks we wanted. The servers at the time were a mom and daughter so I just didn't want to be mean and snobby to them at the time. I told them they could use their phones to get an app with plenty of drink ingredients included, they were really nice about it. Maybe I will get take out next time."}
{"text":"I LOVE MICHAEL'S PIZZA & TWISTIES! The pizza crust, sauce and cheese are perfect. The pepperoni pizza or pepperoni and onion topping combination are also perfect. And those puffy, twisted cheese sprinkled baked dough twisties with the slightly gooey centers dipped in the delightful Michaels sauce are also perfect.

We've eaten here dozens of times and celebrated so many family milestones here over twisties, pizza and pitchers of Yuengling through the past several years. And we have Meghan, our favorite Saturday afternoon bartender. This little bar on the Southside holds a happy place in my heart.

In fact, most of my family members have also reviewed Michaels and have all given it 5 stars. My star deduction is solely based on one thing and to me it's a biggie - pizza toppings. My favorite pizza has always been pepperoni & mushrooms and they use canned mushrooms. I've tried multiple times to come up with a reasonable alternative and until we went with the onions, everything just fell short. I like jalapeños,they only have banana peppers. Tried the bacon and the spinach, nope not worthy. So pepperoni and onions it is! And I'm now a happy camper.

We've tried the hockey puck, a fried dough ball covered in sauce and its really good. The fried mac and cheese didn't do it for me & i can live with that. The hoagies come out weighing more than your head. If you enjoy a fully loaded hoagie, theirs may be your ticket to heavenly delight.

This little unassuming Southside gem on Sarah Street with the neon pink Michael's sign over the door is truly a happy find!"}
{"text":"The service I received was horrendous. There were only about 10 people (4 groups) in there and the bartender passed by me a dozen times taking care of everyone else. She didn't say hi or anything but definitely saw me. Two people came in after me and got served before I did. Then she took care of everyone who was already there making sure their drinks were full. At one point she checked her texts. At least fifteen minutes went by before she came over to me. Yea, she was a little busy, but not enough to excuse what happened. 

After some people cleared out, I was able to get a little service. The food was pretty good and decently priced. I ordered the pepperoni roll and a personal cheesesteak pizza. The pizza wasn't bad, but the pizza roll was great. Unfortunately, the service ruined my experience. 

I'd still recommend this place based on the food.  Hopefully you'll get better treatment than I did."}
{"text":"Delicious sauce and fresh made crust! Daily lunch specials and 80 cent slices on Thursday!"}
{"text":"I regularly order their pizza special called a little charlie's... which is a small personal pan pizza w/ a large beverage. THIS! Their pizza is A-MAZING! This is the best pizza spot on the southside! 4-stars!"}
{"text":"This place is great. The pizza is in the top 3 in Pittsburgh and may even be number one. The price is great.It's a hidden gem on the south side and well worth the trip. My mouth is watering just thinking about it."}
{"text":"If you are looking for good, cheap pizza, Michael's is your spot. I came here to experience what I had heard from several different people was the \"best pizza in Pittsburgh\". I usually prefer thin crust pizza so I wasn't expecting much, but this pizza was great. The crust and sauce was very sweet, the toppings were fresh, and it was all baked together to create a big gooey mess of deliciousness. It did take a while for our food to come out (not sure if that is typical), but the price is right, and the staff is friendly, so I didn't mind waiting."}
{"text":"Michael's is located off of Carson on Sarah Street and is a neighborhood bar and pizza place. I love that about it since the townies come here and are down to earth, friendly, and welcoming. I grew up two blocks away from it and I always love coming back to chat with people and enjoy a good pizza

Regarding the food, this is one of the best pizza shops in Southside. They have a wide variety of pizza toppings to choose from at reasonable prices. They also have specialty pizzas, like pierogi pizza.  If you aren't in to pizza, you might try one of the hoagies or an order of the Twisties (which is the best appetizer on the menu)."}
{"text":"Michael's is great for what it is: a dive bar that serves great pizza. 

Their beer selection is small, service can be slow, and salad dressing comes in packets. 

However, they make one hell of a pizza! Really tasty dough, zesty sauce, and baked just right. On Thursdays, they have pizza by the slice.

Michael's has a large menu complete with deep fried appetizers, salads, and sandwiches. They aren't bad, but I'd stick to what they do best."}
