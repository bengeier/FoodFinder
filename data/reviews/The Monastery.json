{"text":"After walking out a few weeks ago when we sat for 15 minutes without any service we figured we would give it another try. 

Unfortunately, it was just as bad the 2nd time. Eventually someone did come around to serve us, although I'm pretty sure our waitress was drunk.  Literally every 'empty' table around us sat full of empty plates and beer glasses from previous customers that had left much earlier and remained in place during our hour and a half visit.  

Poor service and bad show are a result of mismanagement.  The place is a great concept with open space and activities (volleyball, ping pong, grassy area, etc...) but it's not just a park, it's a place of business.  It seems management has overlooked this area."}
{"text":"Its a laid back place for sure, with all the plusses and minuses that go with that. Crackerjack super-fast service? Dont count on it. Dusty in the corners. Seems to fly on auto pilot a lot. In any case, its the bar I go to the most... so go figure. Nothing quite like it."}
{"text":"This is the 2 nd time I have come for a meal. The 1 st time wasn't that impressive, service was below average and food so-so... It was somewhat busy so they got a pass on a Friday night. Having heard good things bout this place I was cautious when my wife wanted to meet a friend  for a beer & food for a 2 nd time around. BIG MISTAKE!! It was worse this time. Completely unorganized, horrible service & rude. Would only recommend this place if you were the only patron & only asking for water!"}
{"text":"Love it... this adult playground allows you to cook your own food! That way you know your order will always be made to your perfection."}
{"text":"Unless you have the patience of a saint and aren't really hungry or thirsty, don't go here!  Service is always poor and only slightly better at the inside bar.  The 'food' is terrible and sits in your stomach like a rock.  It's a full bar but the bar staff aren't always given everything they need to make certain drinks.  And if you do decide to go, hope that a party hasn't reserved ALL the tables, inside and out.  This place is so not worth the trip.  The only good thing about this place is that they kick the kids out at 8pm."}
{"text":"Was there at the Monastery sunday for the 2nd. annual chili cookoff.  Had a great cook it yourself 1/2 lb. burger, great food.  They have a huge outdoor play area with 2 sand VB courts and alot of other activities.  Very nice place to hang out and have a beer and some food and games.  Oh by the way I took 2nd., should have been 1st. out of 19 entries.in the chili cookoff. And thats t from \"The Truth\""}
{"text":"Horrible service and management.  We reserved an area for 25 people for a night out with friends. We get there to find that they gave us space for about 12 people, crammed between two kid's birthday parties.  They refused to move us and didn't refund us the money we had to pay to reserve one of the ramadas. Don't even get me started on why there were having an 8 yr olds party at a bar at 9 pm. I mean...WTF. Anyways, the waitress would disappear for 30 minutes at a time, forgot to place some of our food orders, so we were still waiting for them over an hour later. Our drinks would take at least 20 minutes to arrive, along with a list if who was at fault this time for the wait, and guess what... It was never her fault. When the food would finally come it was warm to cold, so it wasn't even edible. 

It was supposed to be a fun night with friends, but instead we had to deal with the shitty situation which ruined the evening.   They lost a bunch of customers, but the way they treated us they probably don't even care."}
{"text":"Off the hook, GREAT BAR, but it's more than just a bar it's a playground for adults. Sand volleyball, cornhole, horse shoes, and things for youngsters to climb an play on too during the day.the manager was AWESOME one of are drinks got forgot and she got us a round of drinks... real attractive servers... great atmosphere and a great time my all time go to place for a good night out with fun loving people. The band was good too.... thanks for all the fun"}
{"text":"This place is fun on many levels. Games in the yard, Live music out side, The patio is one of the most laid back I have been to. Sat there for 4 hours chilin' and munchin' on some peanuts. The Santa fe style of the buildings gives you the feeling of being out in the country. Don't let me forget about dog friendly, and the grill your own meat station, our food was top notch bar fare. Our server \"Lindsey\" had her act together. When I started to think about wanting something she was there?! This is what all AZ bar / restaurants should be modeled after."}
{"text":"It's a good concept if the owners / mismanagement had bothered to keep a trendy or classy atmosphere. As it is save your money get fast food - McDonald's has less grease. We had to ask for plates for the appetizer platter (it is meant to be shared) so the sever handed my daughter 4 paper plates. 

My salad wasn't a salad it was a paper plate of mixed greens - really no tomatoes, nothing on it or in it other than lettuce and she threw a packet of Newmans Dressing on the table just like the ones you get at Burger King or McDonald's. My steak - it was OK - I asked for medium and got medium well and that was the best part of it. The steak is served on a paper plate and when I asked about utensils I was directed to go get my own from around the corner - yup plastic ware for a steak on a paper plate.

My daughter had a burger and it was so greasy the bun turned soggy brown part way through then fell completely apart.

Service? Well let's just pretend this place is 100% do it yourself then it would be OK. The waitress walked away before my daughter finished her order. Never came back and asked how things were, nothing. Really if we were the kind to dine & dash it wouldn't have been a problem because she wouldn't have known we were gone. My daughter actually had to go find the server and ask for the bill!!!!

What kills me is the employees exude an I don't care attitude which is also obvious in their actions (or lack of actions) and the message I got was the owner / mis-management has accepted this lazy unfriendly service because it's obvious by how poorly the place is run that it's OK with them.

It could be great but they would need to make a lot of changes - job 1 fire everyone & start over. If I could have given them 1/2 a star I would have - we won't be going back."}
{"text":"It was a fun place. Meet some cool people. The food was good and the service was good. They had live music and we had fun dancing."}
{"text":"Decent burgers! Grill your own. Volleyball courts. Awesome place to host parties! One negative would be it gets a little hot here and practically everything neat is outside."}
{"text":"Caveat: I don't drink or smoke.

I've been to the Monastery about 3 times now.  It's a fun place but really only makes sense to go about this time of year (Feb-May).  Most of it being outside, other times might be completely unbearable.  We only go with a large group of friends-enough to field two volleyball teams.  There are 2 full size volleyball courts there as well as horse shoes and some other field games.

Physically the place is open and nice for an extremely casual hang out (wear your t-shirt and flip flops).  They have live music occaisionally which is great (but can be loud if you're trying to have a conversation...even at the furthest volleyball court).

Food -- meh, nothing to write home about.  You cook your own, so be prepared for that.  It's part of the experience.  It's your basic burger, a small piece of steak, or some chicken.  Again, nothing special here.  If you are coming for the food, you're at the wrong place.

We always have a good time there with friends.  The crowd starts to get a little smokey/rowdy as the night progresses.  If you aren't bothered by that, then no sweat.  

Bring your ID.  They are kind of jerks about this even though you don't drink (and they allow kids as well...odd policies conflicting).  It's quite lame, but I suppose I understand.  They just aren't considerate about it...perhaps the 19 year old manager-of-the-evening could be more polite."}
{"text":"Average beer selection, Kind good bartender inside. Went outside and waited 15 min. for service. Then there was the attitude not great."}
{"text":"Great place to take the kids for lunch. Lots of room for them to run and plenty of games for them. Great hang out for adults. Kid friendly during the day and grown ups only at night. Not gourmet but good food."}
{"text":"Went there for Wednesday's burger night which is very good typically.  Although now they have open mic night, that is new on Wednesdays. There was a guy here that was running the open mic night named Frank. He was the upmost horrible, God awful singer that I've ever heard in my life. He sounds like a cat caught up in a fan belt. In a old, squeaky, rusted out car...driving off a cliff.

I'm pretty sure he was the guy that was, or in BT'Z on Saturday nights (haven't been the same reasons). It made me want to poke my eyes out with a unbroken beer bottle and stab my ear drums out with the nearest garbage can. I'm sorry, but I come here on Wednesday nights for some peace and quiet and a good burger and things are always quiet. 99% of the time it's a great place to go, during  the week. With good food, good music (on the weekends) and good friends to meet...Its a winner. My advice, just check in out whenever and form your own review.

Call before you go to see what's happening on Wednesdays anyway."}
{"text":"Just an awful experience. We went in very playful, happy and excited only to leave hungry, repulsed, and angry. 

We were seated across from an unbussed table and watched new customers literally sit there and move the dishes and food around while staff ignored it for an hour. 

As for our order, we ordered two steaks, three appetizers, and a chicken sandwich. The steaks came first for some reason. They didn't put the order in for the appetizers. Steaks were cold and raw. I returned mine while my hungry niece tried to chew hers. The chicken sandwich was okay. I asked for the manager. The rest came out before he arrived. An hour after ordering. My niece gave up on her steak just as they returned my very same steak which had been put back on the grill. I couldn't speak for a minute. 

We asked for the steaks to be removed from the bill. The manager halved our bill and we still paid $39 for a chicken sandwich and appetizers we had to take with us in boxes. 

Four of us are still very hungry and are now looking for a place to go at 9pm as we have more than an hour drive home.

They finally cleaned the table after I complained about it twice. 

The site screams apathy. There is evident neglect of the items that are supposed to bring people in, like the connect four where the discs are literally falling apart. If I weren't so upset I would feel sad that I missed it at it's peak. It was probably something great when care was put into it."}
{"text":"Well... I guess this place has been around since dirt... in different locations...Or so I'm told.
I have to agree with a lot of the previous reviews like Melissa F, Kituria G.(and I have heard about the 'Free Taxi' story from other bars too) and  Michael C. overall this place has style and uniqueness seldomly seen in other bars. It defiantly not a stuffy, upscale Scottsdale bar- but sometimes that is just what we need! 
It's just a beer and Wine joint, with 2 frozen drink machines- didn't check on the flavors. The Beer selection was healthy! Good imports and seasonal are available.
Wines were OK.. I didn't see a huge selection..BUT i wasn't really looking... service is below average... both bar and wait service was slow on a slow Friday night; or so it seemed.
Not a place to go if you wanted a \"sit-down and be waited on dinner\", meat is given to you with buns at cook yourself! A novelty idea, and it is fun to do once.. or maybe for lunch after golf or a hike- Personally it was a great end to an afternoon of Frisbee Golf!

NUTSHELL- a great place to meet some folks for some afternoon beers, always weekend music. I'd given it 5 stars but it's no 'Minder Binders'!!!
(GOD how I miss Minder Binders!!)"}
{"text":"I go way back with The Monastery and remember the original that backed up against the canal in Arcadia.

i went to the one at Falcon Field yesterday at 3 p.m. to meet a friend and was utterly shocked by the lousy service. When the customer has to greet the bartender (who just stood there with a vacant stare) then one has to wonder who is serving who.

My friend and I then went outside hoping for better service. There was no detectable service outside at all.

So I went back in and stood by the bar for about ten minutes. It was apparently a shift change where a plasticized, over-inked woman chit-chatted with the bartender about the customers who had not been acknowledged, much less served. 

My credit card and I must have been invisible. So the both of us just walked away.

Forever."}
{"text":"ive been here before and service was rock star, this time i don't know what happened. the bar tender at the back bar was cute but that is the only thing going. not once did sh ask if she could get me anything. cute lil blonde was a server, she was quick to ask me if i needed anything but i had been served from the bar inside. she was good she asked a couple more times then i think she went home i didnt see her. the guy who served me, even for being fairly slammed  there was minimal wait and the prices were ok . the front bartender and i think the blonds name was amanda. they were good. as it was the first time back in a long time i will still give them another chance. the rear bartender may have had a bad night so i will cut a little slack. if that is how the service is going to always be at the back bar. i dont know i think i might keep going back to my dive bars like i had been."}
{"text":"Who works here? This place has a cool concept, but clearly the owners are never around. If the owners were around, they would notice that staff only cares if their friends are being served. The place is huge and mostly outside. However, at 2pm on Saturday, do not expect to be served outside. You must go inside and search for a staff member to place an order.  Then, you must wait a very long time before going back inside to check on your order. If you're lucky, you will be given your order to take back to your outside table. This is such a shame, given that it would be a great place to hang out and share some drinks with friends. However, if you have to do the server's job, you are better off packing a cooler and going somewhere else. I feel sorry for the owners, I am sure they do not know how much money they are losing."}
{"text":"Once again The Monastery is delicious. Wednesday hamburger and fries special. You gotta try it."}
{"text":"Great location but worst service ever! Waited 45 mins for sliders and another person in our party waited 20 mins for a beer before they told him it was out and needed to pick something else. Waited another 20 mins for my check/tab and they tried to give it to me without my card. Shady. Don't go here."}
{"text":"I went there yesterday and sat at the outside bar.   Beer was cold.   Food was delicious.   The bartender was great.   She was super upbeat and hilarious.   All the customers seemed to enjoy being around each other.   There were people playing volleyball.   Bartender invited me back on Sunday to play volleyball pick up games!   I can't wait!   Booze and exercise!"}
{"text":"I went there on  Tuesday Bike night.  When I first arrived I ordered a Jack & Coke which I watched the bartender pour, Very weak.  It tasted like coke.  The Owner Alan happened to be standing near by and offered to add another shot which was nice.  
  We all ordered our food, the staff is nice but took about 1,hour to get our food.  I ordered a Monterey Chicken Club and got just the Chicken Sandwich.  $10.00 with nothing included :( 
  Stupid me, I went back to the bar and ordered another Jack & Coke.  Again a WEAK drink.  I mentioned it to the Bartender and she said the Owner was there so she had to watch her pour.  I even let my Sister taste my drink, she hates Jack.  She even said it tasted just like Coke. 
  I might come back for another Bike night but I will NOT drink here again unless maybe a Beer.
The atmosphere is nice with Music and Volleyball but none of that matters when we had the issues we had.  I hope Alan the Owner can fix these things because he seems like a great guy."}
{"text":"We love this place but the service is terrible for a holiday. It's St. Patrick's and you'd expect the bar to be staffed up. Took 45 min to get food and rude kitchen staff."}
{"text":"We arrived 6-ish on a Saturday night, walked in, no hostess, no signage explaining whether to seat self, etc. We walked into the bar where 2 staff walked around us without acknowledgement. A 3rd staff instructed us to \"sit wherever you'd like\". We found a table, sat for 15 minutes, no menus on table, no staff approaching, nothing. Other diners appeared to have already eaten as we saw empty dishes and people enjoying the weather. We saw staff pass by repeatedly looking busy but not actually carrying anything. We finally gave up and left, as we did a staff did acknowledge us with \"have a good evening.\" I'm disappointed as we'd heard this place was a fun friendly place to eat. There's talk at work of having our holiday party here, hopefully their group service is better."}
{"text":"Come for the outdoor atmosphere, and with a big group you enjoy being with.  Otherwise don't bother.  The food is barely above fast food, takes an ungodly amount of time - an hour a try for us- and most came out wrong and cold.

The worst part though is the service.  These people need to be kept away from the American public and maybe even wildlife.  My wife has food allergies and ordered a sandwich without mayo.  They brought it with mayo, which is an easy enough mistake, but instead of just fixing it they argued with us that it really didn't matter.  The manager was worse.  After sending back the sandwich (one of our whole party) they were really surely, wouldn't refill drinks, slamming things and making sarcastic comments.  It was awful.  We won't ever go back."}
{"text":"Ugh, the moment I walked into this place, I felt really awkward. We came here for our friend's surprise birthday dinner. It was about 6 o'clock on a Friday evening and as we're walking towards the door we see 2 women stumbling out completely wasted. Come on ladies, it's 6 o'clock.. what are you doing with your lives?

We walk in and the lay out is really awkward. If you've never been there and you're there for more than alcohol, it's not exactly clear what to do or how to get a waitress' attention. So we sit down and search the menu for anything without meat since it's a Friday and it is Lent. Sadly, the menu only had cheese pizza and a veggie burger. We ended up getting jalapeno poppers and a veggie burger and both were disgusting. 
 
In addition to the disgusting meal, the patrons and the workers were grimey. Let me just break it down:

(1) There are no designated smoking areas. Patrons and employees were walking around smoking around everybody. It was disgusting.

(2) The crowd is a bit older... there was a lot of mid-life crisis resonating in the air. Let me just use this as an example. One of the guy's in our group paid to have a fire set up outside by our table. This old guy and his old lady dressed in dirt-biking outfits take a couple chairs and sit down right in front of me, blocking the warmth of the fire from me and my 5 month old. Thanks guy!  So the waitress goes up to the old guy and asks him what he would like to drink, and he says \" i'm on a motorcycle, so i'll have a diet coke\". Great to know guy... I think she asked what you wanted to drink, not what your mode of transportation was. 
       So 8 o'clock comes and the employees are letting us know of this ridiculous rule to have all children out by this time. So as were getting the kids ready, the guy in our group who paid for the fire, tons of drinks, and food says to us how he thinks it's a bad idea for business to kick people out by 8 o'clock and how he thinks they're losing money. Out of nowhere, the old guy on the cool motorcycle starts arguing with us about how he knows they're not losing money and he knows because he's been going there for 20 years. WTH? WAS ANYONE TALKING TO YOU? First of all old man, business is being lost because the man who paid for the fire you are sitting by is a millionaire and now he's never going back to this place and he's going to let all his rich friends know. Second, 8 o'clock is super early, and people don't start going out to the bars until at least 10 o'clock. Maybe people went out earlier 20 years ago, but times have changed grandpa. 

(3) This was a main complaint from other people in our party, but this place does not have a full bar. You'll have to settle for a beer, margarita, or sneaking in your own flask to get a good buzz.

-Sorry for my rant, but this place sucked. I'm usually not picky about my food, I usually enjoy the outdoors, and I'm usually a nice person. BUT if you like second hand smoke, crappy food, rude old men, inappropriately dressed sabertooths, and a lack of good alcohol then BY ALL MEANS, check this place out."}
{"text":"Just stopped by for dinner and drinks after playing tennis. Service was very slow just for drinks. Not many people there. They were nice just so slow to take an order or bring anything so we went some where else to pick up dinner."}
{"text":"Cool place to go if you are looking for something a little different. They have food to order at the bar or you can buy meat and grill it yourself on the patio or by the full size sand volleyball court!"}
{"text":"This is an establishment we used to enjoy going to because it was kids and pet friendly.  Our daughter would play volleyball there.  Recently we were kicked out at 8pm due to a supposed no kids after 8pm rule.  The night after other families and kids were there until after 9.  Its unfortunate that they treated us like this and they will be losing our business as well as friends of ours."}
{"text":"It's a great place to hang out and have a beer outside in this large patio area.  The best part is that I can bring my dogs.  As long as you have them leashed the place is the most dog friendly place I have ever been to in the East Valley. 

It really feels like you are hanging out in somebody's back yard.  It's really laid back.  Part of the charm is you cook your own food.  Yeah it could be a pain for some people but not that big of a deal.  This is the perfect spring and summer hang out.

Try the margaritas and the jello shots.  I have had great times with friends here and hanging out near a fire pit just makes it better.  Reminds me of times I used to hang out on the beach in Cali with friends near the lit bon fires."}
{"text":"Been in there twice but never eaten.  Beer is good.  Strange setup.

I'm editing my review, because I have now eaten there and really enjoy the atmosphere..."}
{"text":"Super fun place! We visited around 10:30pm and the outside bar top gal was just leaving- she was very sweet though and helped us out until she left. It was easy since it wasn't too busy to go inside to do our ordering. As my friend described it, this place is like someone's \"really cool, big backyard\". There are two volleyball courts, plenty of seating all over the place, and a good homestyle menu. You can even purchase a \"grill it yourself\" option and have a cookout.

I'm sure we'll be back :)"}
{"text":"Quite disappointed. We have been here before with similar (though not as bad as this) results.
First let me start with the vibe of the place. Very cool, great environment. 
Service was abysmal and the food wasn't a whole lot better.
we came in on a Thursday afternoon (3/29), just after 1pm. Not too busy but not dead either. Every beer (3 different ones) we tried to order off of their beer list was out. So we settled on something that was available. We waited over 10 minutes before she came back to take our order. We just wanted some wings. That's when the waiting game began.
We waited on a beer refill, had to flag down the server to get her to stop by. Then after she took our order (grilled wings in a dry rub, nothing fancy) we waited over 45 minutes. I am not exaggerating. There was a gentleman next to us at the bar who ordered before us and he waited almost as long. However I saw several people (off duty employees?) at the end of the bar getting several plates of food from the kitchen on their own. All before we got our measly 6 wings. The gentleman sitting next to us remarked \"If you are hungry you should go next door and eat. Then just come here for the beer\" 
Not one time did our server apologize, or explain the delay. she didn't check on us at all. We had to continually flag her down to find out what was going on and get another beer
While we waited I saw 2 sets of very upset customers leave. They too waited and waited. One guy said \"I don't even want the food now. I just want to leave.\"
Pretty disappointed. Not sure I will go back and I will tell my friends what happened. They can make up their own minds."}
{"text":"Rayce. He was the best! I literally had the best night of my life here! So spacious, and everyone is so laid back. 10/10 would
recommend coming here!"}
{"text":"We went to the Monastery with a large group and we were scheduled to have a dedicated server to accommodate our group. We waited over an hour and a half to receive our food which was overcooked and cold. We found the place to be totally disorganized and unprofessional. There were no updates as to the status of our order. We would not recommend going to this establishment for a large group!  Totally disappointed!"}
{"text":"This place is too much fun! I met up with some friends of mine one Saturday night. The place was hoppin' but it wasn't so busy that we couldn't have fun and be social. There was a neat seating area by the front that was perfect for our group. 

Now, I'm not a huge beer drinker. In fact, I rarely drink beer but something told me to enjoy a Blue Moon on this particular night and wow...if my beer ALWAYS tasted that awesome, I'm pretty sure I would drink it a lot more. The Blue Moon from the tap was just delicious. I was very impressed.

The bar is really unlike anything I've ever seen. Not only do they have cornhole-ing but they also have volleyball courts, ping pong tables and beer pong happening. They had a live band that was super fun and there are so many places to sit! Kids can come here on weekend nights with their families and enjoy the games out in the huge grass area. There are also nice gazebos that groups can claim for their evening out.

I didn't get to try much of the food but I can say that their fries and buffalo mozzarella sticks are really great if you're just digging some quick bar food! This place is by Falcon Field pretty close to the 202 so if you're out there, check it out!"}
{"text":"It was a packed house for Halloween and they were on top of their game. The servers were out all night. The band was fun. They were all dressed up as Doctors or Nurses. Even the band was dressed up as Hospital Staff. 

Veronica was our outside server and she was really wonderful. We never had to wait and she was really fun and friendly! 

They have volleyball, horseshoes, a fire pit, an outside live band, fun friendly staff. We are come back every time we want a night out. 

So much fun, thank you for one of the best nights ever!"}
{"text":"I'd give it no stars if it was an option. I went there last night with some family. We walked in the door and stood there for a minute not sure if we were to seat ourselves or wait, no host/no sign so we sat ourselves. 
Our waiter was sweating and very rude, almost seemed bothered that we sat in his section. I ordered the tacos, which are hard shell and were stale along with the tortilla chips served with them. When I told our server he stated that they were just thicker and probably not use to them. So I shared with him to tell the cook and owner they were disgusting. The beef in the tacos was not seasoned either .. Just plain ole hamburger. My parents had the fish fry which I'm sure was frozen fish sticks. Everything was served in paper plates and cups. You needed something you had to get up and get it and find the waiter. There are a TON of unattended children running around shoeless and full of sand while their parents sit and drink. My Mother and I went to use the bathroom and decided to just wait. Floors were wet, and just filthy all over. My father said that there are nude photos all over the walls in the men's bathroom. Totally disgusted by the whole place and would never recommend to anyone!"}
{"text":"The Monastery is definitely somewhere you go for the atmosphere, not really the food.  They offer a \"grill-your-own\" ore pre-cooked menu with options ranging from hot dogs and hamburgers to pasta.  The service is extremely slow and can be confusing if you have a large group.  Sometimes it is quicker if you order at the bar, but can also be delayed depending on what the small kitchen offers.  

This las time, I ordered a grill-your-own bratwurst and onion rings.  The onion rings came out about 15 minutes after I was giving my brat to cook.  It actually worked out well, as I waited until my friend got hers and we were able to grill together.  The O-rings came out right as we were finishing.  The chips and salsa used to be better, but now it seems they use Pace.  :(

They offer a decent selection of craft and domestic beers."}
{"text":"I came her with friends after our softball game, and I had no idea what I was walking into. First off, lets set some expectations. This place is like going to a backyard BBQ and everyone is invited. It's outside, there's a live band, and I don't believe they have hard liquor beyond pre-made frozen drinks. So, with that being said, if you want to relax with friend, have a few beers and play bags, horseshoes or volleyball then this place is cool. If your wearing stilettos, you've made a mistake so be prepared to aerate the lawn. We had fun, but if I recall they close around midnight."}
{"text":"First time here for a meet up group and tried to order a beer in the inside bar. The bartender talked and talk and talked. The girls were doing their job but he just wanted to talk. After a half hour I walked out. People were complaining about the fact he gave a beer away but charged someone in our group for it.  Seems the wait staff are really confused."}
{"text":"Great place to hang out and chill with friends and a cold brew! I could see The Monastery becoming my go to place for happy hour. Drinks were cheap and food was decent bar food (not too greasy). I only wish there were s few more vegetarian options. 

We sat on the patio when it was 101 degrees and were very comfortable due to the misters."}
{"text":"We went there on a Friday night. I think it was a slower than usual because it was colder out. The outdoor area is large and it includes volleyball courts, DJ, BBQ area, lawn games, ping pong tables, and a bar. The indoor is a bar/restaurant with a great of local beer selections. There was a volleyball tournament going on when I was there, so we didn't get a chance to play. The DJ played a lot of music that would be played at a wedding. Tons of people got down! Food-wise, you can order raw meat to cook your own burgers on the outside grill. They have seasoning and etc you can tweak yourself. I thought it was kind of a neat idea. They also have popcorn inside. I only had the fries but they were pretty good! The vibe is chill and I would definitely go again."}
{"text":"I hate to say this because I like the place, but... service has really gone downhill. It might have something to do with the new app, so nobody wants to go out and check on you, it took 45 minutes to get chicken wings and tater tots and that was walking up and getting it ourselves.
Does the manager, owner ever come in and look around and talk to people? I doubt it.
The place has great potential but until the server's realize that if they walk around and talk to you ....their tips will increase, weird huh?
Hope this helps....
Oh and one more thing ditch Carvin .....
 please??"}
{"text":"Service was very slow, 30 minutes to get our food. Salad was ok... never got refills on drinks until we asked.... took forever to get our bill..."}
{"text":"This place is by far the most ambitious bar idea I have seen in... well, forever.  Somehow they can pull it off!  I first went to the location out in the west valley and I was blown away.  Then when I moved to Gilbert, I was saddened because I couldn't see myself driving all the way to Glendale to frequent my favorite hangout!

But then (dramatic sounds)... I was invited to play volleyball at the Monastery (YES! they have an east valley location!)

Anyway, enough of the over dramatics.  This place is cool.  Mostly outdoors with firepits, grills, pool, sand volleyball courts, ping pong tables, and horseshoe pits. Would I lie? Check it out!  There is NOTHING like grilling burgers on a humongous community grill when you are two sheets. Everyone is joking and hurling the garlic powder across the fire at each other while listening to a pretty decent cover band.

I honestly can't tell you how good the prices were on beer, but the food isn't bad.  I think it was like $8.00 for a slab of hamburger meat.  Good Freakin' Times!"}
{"text":"This is the place to hang out. People go miles out of there way to be here. Alway making new friends here."}
{"text":"Being as my friends and I frequent this spot on a weekly basis, I'd say it's one of my favorite places to be in Arizona.  With the outdoor sand volleyball courts, ping pong tables, horseshoes, bags, live music, and grill where you can cook your own food, it's a great place for friends to gather and have a great time.  Plus the beer is cheep and they have a good selection.  ;)"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed The outdoor seating. You have to have patience because the waitstaff I have a lot of tables. Food was very good. Atmosphere is fun and exciting.mostly outdoor seating."}
{"text":"Very fun place. We went on a Saturday night and played sand volleyball against some other people. It helped that neither of us were very good, so bad volleyball playing equals lots of laughs and overall a great night. 

The place was very busy when we got there, but calmed down soon after. The bartenders were slow, and the servers were non-existant. The restrooms were a mess. Overall the place is fun, but service sucks."}
{"text":"I went there for the first time last night and was thoroughly impressed. I walked into the bar area and was warmly greeted by the bartender Lindsay and a chef named Blake. Both were super awesome and kept the kitchen open just because we called ahead. I will most certainly be going back with a larger group of people next time. Keep up the great service and thank you for everything."}
{"text":"The Monastery is fun, creative and most of all laid back. All bars should take notes.

Volleyball and tons of space to spread out, listen to music, cook your own BBQ (food provided raw), games etc. Cool place for a wedding reception or party! Has kind of a tropical feel even for Mesa!!! Lots of little area's to get lost in and do your own thing.

NO drama at this place which is a huge plus.  Bartenders could be a tad bit more friendly as they seem to not really care as much as they could.

Overall a wonderful place to visit especially if you are tired of sportin' your man blouse and $500 shoes in the Scottsdale bars....."}
{"text":"As another person posted... I know, I can be lazy... I copied their remarks but I agree WHOLEHEARTEDLY with them! This is a REALLY neat place! 

Rad bar in NE, Mesa. Cheap drinks, Awesome customer service, Volleyball, Fire pits, Pool table, Decent live music, Grill your own food & you can bring your dog! The greatest qualities any bar can have! I live about 1.5 miles from the Monastery, can't wait to visit again!"}
{"text":"Been here twice, brought the grand babies the second time. Love it even more than the first!! Will definitely be back. Bands are awesome. Food is great you can grill you're own burgers, steak or ribs!!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere!! We ordered nachos...don't make the same mistake! Stay away from nachos...there was nearly zero cheese on those bad boys. Stick with beer and games."}
{"text":"Typical bar food, average beer selection, not particularly remarkable service. They do have live music on Fridays and Saturdays but it's damn loud so no chit chatting. They kick all kids out at 8:00 pm sharp(anyone under 21), before 8 it's a pretty good place for wild and out of control kids, they can go bananas on the sand volleyball courts.
Three stars."}
{"text":"The food and service are just okay but the ambiance is amazing.  Very enjoyed meeting friends with the kids here.  Kids enjoyed engaging with others on the sand volleyball courts, playing table games, playing the giant four in a row and doing karaoke on a Monday night.  The fried zucchini was good.  Kids liked the kids meals.  Bummed they don't have any desserts!"}
{"text":"This place is really, really fun!  There is stuff going on all around you. The service was good even though we had almost 20 people in our group. We had a hot dog, slider and soft pretzel from the happy hour menu (goes until 7 which is nice) and it was all delicious and fresh. I heard the wings were especially good too. We will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"What the hell is up with the music?!? You can't dance to it, you can't get into it. We went on 7/31 and it just drug the whole night down. I think three people sat and watched the guys playing. Really? You pay for these guys to be here? Even with the bean bag toss and ping pong and all the good things about The Monastery, the music bit big time! Ugh, it makes me not wanna come back anytime soon."}
{"text":"i dont get this place ....now mind you ihave not been there for a few years so take this review as you want but why would i go to a bar with a weak beer selection and have to cook my own burger????????????? as i rermember the staff was not overly friendly and the building had a wierd lay out sort of choppy lots of seperated rooms  ......."}
{"text":"Would love to give a half star,  this is an old business with no updates,  tv's are from the 80's, bar service slow,  servers slow and forgetful. They have been in business for 45 years,  how I don't know.  Please someone give them the number to bar rescue."}
{"text":"This is one of the only bars in Mesa, AZ.  But it would hold its own if it were in Phoenix.  It is an outdoor bar with two sand volleyball courts, firepits all over the place, and other areas to play games and hang out.  There is also an outdoor stage where cover bands play music on the weekends.  You order your own burger patty to grill it however you would like it, with whatever trimmings you want to add.  It is so laid back, and the owners are so nice, it is one of the few spots I need to go to every time I come back to my hometown."}
{"text":"This place is a lot of fun.  They have tons of activities from free poker (Sunday Nights), ping pong, bands, volleyball - your options are endless.  Our server - Melissa - was also great.  Very attentive and friendly.  The only bad thing I have to say about this place is about the front door guy.  He was very rude and seemed to be on a bit of a power trip.  We almost left before we even got in just because of him.  Once you get past the door, the experience is very pleasant."}
{"text":"That was a disappointment!  Food service was very slow.  35 minutes for chips and salsa. Teens actually asked to go someplace else for dinner. Checker game did not have  pieces, connect four was not available, and only one ping pong table was functional.  Teens were very disappointed. I was so hoping for an evening adults and teens could enjoy. We were all very disappointed. Beer was good!! The potential for this place is amazing."}
{"text":"The single worst experience I've ever had at any establishment!!!! We brought 12 people for a work function on a Sunday night for food and drink. Asked for happy hour pricing to be extended to our party or simply free pool for the evening due to the fact we would be spending a fair amount of money not to mention it was a Sunday night.  I get that a business to make a profit but come on a little effort sure goes a long way!!! Since we do these functions once a month I'm happy to say we will never be back!!!! I"}
{"text":"Three stars says 'A-OK', but it ain't 'A-OK,' so it gets two stars. Food is well, pub food. Salty so you can get thirsty for more beer or ale, or whatever you're drinking. Go play some games with your friends, it works well for that, but get ready for louder than decent atmosphere with below average service and a great feeling of vertigo from the obnoxious music pumping in the air, and you have pretty much a picture. Great place to start your drinking and driving days, seen people do that there..."}
{"text":"If you enjoy bartenders that are in a bad mood, and people watching than this place is a great choice! The only redeeming quality is it has an outdoor bar and the beer is cold."}
{"text":"I worked in the restaurant business, so I am often empathetic with the staff and give them the benefit of the doubt. I don't send food back, or complain if something is wrong. I just deal with it.

Myself, my boss, and a business associate came here around 7, the place was relatively quiet so we figured it shouldn't take too long. We decided on the 'cook your own steak', only to find out 40 minutes later that the type of steak on the menu \"they didn't actually sell\", so they gave us \"better\" steaks for the same price.

We took them to the grill, where we noticed they looked and smelled just a little bit \"off\", but again, we aren't complainers, so we just dealt with it. By the time we cooked our steaks with the few other people in the restaurant on the only grill on (there were 2 or 3 others) we came back to our table to see our appetizers had been sitting there, and were cold.

We downed the steak, ate the appetizers, received a few refills, and waited for our check. We pointed out to the server (who again, was brand new) about the meat, and when she returned she agreed it was a bit off, the other servers with her didn't seem surprised or shocked when we pointed it out. They gave us a basket of appetizers to apologize, and then brought the full price bill.

All in all, it took us 2.5 hours to sit down, order our own steaks, cook the steaks ourselves, get our check, pay and leave. We aren't slow eaters.

I don't know what is going on with the place, or if management is just saying to push out the bad meat, or what the deal is. Myself and the business associate have been feeling pretty gross the last 12 hours."}
{"text":"Went on a weekend after Thanksgiving and had an amazing experience. Laid back and great vibe. Had a great pizza and service. Highly recommend for a casual afternoon."}
{"text":"The Monastery is unlike anywhere you've probably been before.  Natalie's description gives a great idea...

Almost the whole thing is outside, with large sand volleyball courts, outdoor grills where you cook your own food (purchase it seasoned and ready to go there), swings, fire pits, etc.  I like it in the winter when its nice enough during the day to play volleyball then cool enough at night to bundle up in a hoodie and pretend youre at a bonfire.

I also like it when the near-professional near-naked volleyball boys come to play on Friday nights.  I just appreciate good sports.  

The only thing I dont like about the Monastery is how many people bring their kids.  Thats really just because I'm not a fan of them at all right now, so dont take it personally.  The place is actually pretty well set-up for kids and I guess if they werent so annoying in general, it would be a decent scene for them.  There is a sectioned off sand area for them with toys and stuff yet of course they run amock...grrrrr....  Whatever.

Dont expect a Scottsdale crowd at all, this Mesa bar is just that--a place to kick back and relax with friends.  Change is good my friends."}
{"text":"NOT A PLACE FOR CHILDREN!
My husband was invited to the Monastery by his brother for a birthday celebration.  Before going to The Monastery, we visited their website to confirm that children were welcome.  We visited the Kid's Rules tab.  We saw that children needed to be accompanied by an adult and that children needed to leave after 8.  The child pictured on the Kid's Rules page looked to be maybe five years old at the most.  So we felt comfortable bringing our children to The Monastery.  While at The Monastery, my young daughter who is only 4 announced that she had to use the restroom.  So my husband took her to use the men's restroom (I was not at the Monestary).  Inside the men's restroom hung on the walls were pornographic images of women.  Totally NOT appropriate for children of any age to see.  I understand that this is a pub, but I feel that it is very important that you provide a safe environment for all who are welcome on your property.  Adorning the walls in the men's restroom with inappropriate pictures is NOT appropriate when you advertise on your website that children are welcome.  I would request that you place a disclaimer on the men's restroom door informing parents that there are inappropriate pictures displayed.  The fact that my daughter saw these images is VERY upsetting.  My family will NEVER go back to your establishment because of this experience.  I hope that you do more to protect innocent eyes in the future by WARNING parents!"}
{"text":"Great place to play volleyball, they have grills so you buy the meat and grill it right there which is fun.  I really enjoy this place.  If I was going to say anything negative they don't pay for great bands to play there, but I would really be fine with piped in fun music so having a live band is fun.  Been here several times and always leave with a smile.  The staff seems well trained and nice."}
{"text":"This is a great place to hang out especially if you have children and want to actually be around adults for a little bit. They have several yard games that you can play. 

The downside the food isn't that great and you do have to make it yourself which, on another hand, is kind of fun. Pretty much bar style with extra amenities."}
{"text":"If your looking for a fun place to hang out at with great food, this is NOT your place. The food and service were awful! I have never been to a restaurant with a worst staff. They are very unfriendly and make the experience miserable. This could be a great venue but it is very poorly ran."}
{"text":"As far as a fun place to be this would be it fire pits grills volleyball cornhole ping-pong horseshoes that's all fun stuff. They have lots of beer on tap some they're out of. I ordered a salad it had a hair in it that showed me that the chef wasn't wearing a hairnet such a bummer to. Tell the waitress about it she got me another salad. Are friends ordered the ribs so did my husband they were cold and so on and so forth if you're going to go there to have fun that would be the place and drink beer but the food is nothing special."}
{"text":"We came here for my mom's birthday and by \"we\" I mean a ton of us.   C'mon, we're Latinos, you know we mob deep and with a bunch of kids in tow.  We arrived at 7:00 p.m. on a Sunday night.  I guess kids aren't allowed past 8:00 but the place was DEAD and the couple of people that were there all had kids too.  

We had a great time!  The sand volleyball courts were awesome.  There was a guy on the mic singing everything from the Eagles to Michael Jackson, pretty funny.  A bonfire was going and kids were roasting marshmallows.  It was a perfect night.  Unfortunately, I didn't order any food or drinks but my dad said his burger was the best he's ever had.  The server was very sweet but kept forgetting things.  The bathrooms were gross.

Sure enough, right after the food arrived someone came up to us and told us we had to leave when we were done eating.  I think it's asinine to treat your biggest money maker of the evening like that.  No lie, I'm sure we doubled their revenue for the evening on booze alone.  Ok, I get that they have rules and all, but really, there was only ONE other table by that time.  We left no problem.  Will I be back?  Yeah... I can't think of anywhere else you can play sand volleyball and booze it up."}
{"text":"Sunday afternoon visit. 

The entire place seemed \"hungover.\" The tables were a mess, all random squished together. The servers (if there were 3) were slow and seemed to be running on empty. There was 1 bar tender inside and he was exceptionally slow. 

When we asked about the burgers(fresh or frozen etc) she said \"Nothing here is fresh.\" Welll she was not kidding. The chicken wings went uneaten, the burger was gross, the carrot had frost on it still. The tortilla chips were stale. The fries {all 12} were blah. 

The drinks were all sub par for a bar. The only one that liked it was the beer drinker. 
There was zero music or anything fun going on. 

Bathroom was a mess too.  

I see this being a fun place on a nice Saturday night but other then that....MEH"}
{"text":"Have been here several times over the years and its just gotten better. 

Service was wonderful and after spending a bit of time with some friends had an excellent burger while my friends had some taco's and such. Everything tasted excellent and had a great time.

While we were there a group got together and were playing volleyball and had fun watching them. They also have live music on the weekends! 

All in all had a great time and will return!"}
{"text":"The Monastery is my favorite place to go. We bring clients, family, & friends all year round. We enjoy playing volleyball, ping pong, checkers, and their live music. The monk burgers are amazing, and you can choose to cook them or they will. Chicken wings are tasty and the pizzas are great. The servers and staff are friendly and very welcoming. It's a huge place with a lot of ground to cover, so plan to sit back and relax. Food, drinks, and fun are on the way."}
{"text":"This place gets 5 stars for their bacon cheeseburgers. My fellow office mates and I try to come here for lunch once a week. They grill your hamburger to your liking and also add a special seasoning that is totally delish.I choose the pepperjack cheese to add a little kick to it. When they serve my burger to me I can't get to the condiment station fast enough. I pile on the jalapenos, pickles, lettuce, and tomato. I usually can only eat half a burger....but I can't stop eating this one. It is sooo dang good!"}
{"text":"I met \"the best thing that's ever happened to me\" (inside joke) here.  Luckily, our friends frequent this place often when it's a little warmer out.  

We go for the beer and volleyball, but the boy and I are a bit of competitors at the ping pong tables.  It's always so much fun.  Even when we compete against teams of people that we don't know..(and we win!)

Our dog comes with us occasionally, and someone even brings a duck from time to time.  There is live music for most of the summer, but once it get's too hot, they stop coming out :(  

You do not need to have your own volley ball, they will loan you once, as well as horshoes or bags, in exchange for your keys.  They have good pitcher specials, I think 6 or 7 dollars.  A few servers will make their way around the grounds and bring your beer out for you.  You can rinse the sand off of you before heading home.  Keep in mind this place closes at 11 and I personally think they have fun kicking people out.  

They serve food here as well.  You can order off of the menu, or you can buy burgers to cook yourself.  They have all the fixing set up inside.  I have made my own burger once, and have had taco's once, but really, I don't go there for the food, so don't get too excited about that part."}
{"text":"I love coming here but you can only do so for half the year; being that most of the bar is outside, it's simply too hot enjoy.  In nice weather, this place is a great place to hang with friends and family and play some games while you're at it.  The sand volleyball courts are awesome but are usually occupied with very serious players. The food here is pretty underwhelming.  A while back we opted for the \"cook your own burger\" option and that was actually pretty neat.  

Overall wait til the weather is sensational and grab some friends to go play.  This place almost has it all, but really scores well with it's inviting atmosphere."}
{"text":"Excellent new changes happening at our good ol' hang out bar in Mesa. One of kind atmosphere!  Fresh to def new paint job going on. So sparkly clean. And the good ol' burgers we used to crave and love are BACK and better then ever. The hidden gem there on top of the 2 horseshoe pits, cornhole, ping pong and of course volleyball courts, is their pizza!!! Aaamazing!  Huge property that caters to the baby boomers down to the actual babies and every being in between. Service is so strong, and for those of you who don't care much for communication but want instant gratification use their new restauarant app service called Patron. (Its in your app store) Instant gratification!!!! Bravo Monastery for bringing back the glory days of our youth and putting FUN back into The Real Fun Bar we all know and Love at The Monastery in Mesa"}
{"text":"It's hard to describe The Monastery without it sounding really weird. Well, it is, but in a good way. 

The Monastery is in a sprawling southwest-style house, way out east at Falcon Field. There are big open spaces, as well as plenty of private spaces with tables tucked into corners. There's a two-story stucco fireplace in the middle of the front room and a wrap-around bar in the \"kitchen\".

The atmosphere is very eclectic, sort of a beach bar meets the desert. 
Outside they have a horseshoe pit, sand volleyball, darts and a pool table (among other goodies). For when the weather gets fickle, they have portable fire pits (winter) and misters (all the other times). 

Oh, and the bartenders and \"bouncers\" dress like friars. Really.

Maybe the most interesting thing about an already interesting place is the grub: you cook your own! Order hamburgers, hot dogs, chicken, or steak, and cook it yourself on one of the many barbecue grills. Prices are very reasonable. They have lots of cool events, so check the calendar on their website."}
{"text":"My husband and I have heard nothing but good things about this place and decided to try it out for the first time with our family. Upon walking in, two woman working behind the bar made zero means to acknowledge we had come in..after a couple of minutes of realization they weren't going to help us we proceeded to ask where they wanted us to sit she replied with \"anywhere\". We sat for a few minutes with still no acknowledgement that we were even in the restaurant I proceeded to look for a high chair, I couldn't find one so therefore asked one of the women behind the bar where I could find one..she shrewdly said she would get one for me. A few mins later she brings the high chair, still with her poor customer service skills did not ask for our drink orders. The whole demeanor of customer service at this place was unhelpful and cold. We ended up leaving 10 mins upon arrival, that's how unwanted our business felt."}
{"text":"Let's be honest here guys. You get what you pay for. If you can order a 6 dollar burger and 2 dollar beers while having a fun environment on the airport there's nothing to complain about. 

If you want some one styling over your shoulder waiting for you to order or ask a question pay for that at Ruth's Chris like a real adult. 

If you want a reliably entertaining environment with real people where you can feel like a regular come here. I've never been disappointed by the monastery. All of the owners I've met are awesome. The staff is great and you can play horseshoe, corn hole, and volleyball. 

They have a wide variety of beer on tap and great food. The fries are incredible. If you have to get out of your chair from time to time to ask for something remember you're at a dive bar type environment with upgraded atmosphere and food. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I'm not too much for the bar scene  but the monastery is a pretty cool place to hang out. I was there for a car show so I had the opportunity to really it check. Food was decent - fried pickles were super good. They have a sand volleyball court and I dig that, reminds me of home. They have a small stage for a band. Bathrooms are pretty decorated in lovely ladies so guys don't get lost for too long cause I'm sure the ladies know. They have that 6th sense. Seems like a pretty cool place to hang out so check it out"}
{"text":"This is a fun place to grab a drink and hang out with friends especially when the weather is nice. They have volleyball and lots of areas to sit and relax outside. I've been here many times, from a quick bite to eat to birthday/Christmas parties. Always a good time here. The best way to get great food and quick service is to cook it yourself on their grill. If you don't want to do that, the wings are delicious! I've tried a few things that were good, but not great (Nachos/fish n' chips). It gets really busy on the weekends so plan on waiting a bit for service!"}
{"text":"Welcome to the Monastery, gateway to Apache Junction's teeth-optional singles scene, absolutely FLABulous.

A true nadir experience. Check you expectations of service or food quality at the door.

Synopis: 
 - Service - Terrible
 - Food Quality - Far worse than the Service
*You've been warned*

This a place where they allow you to grill your own food. And! I should def have opted for my own cooking skills, for the love of God. On my way in I saw the manager or owner at the bar and said: \"It's been a couple years since I've been in, are we cooking our own food or ordering these days?\"

He said it would be faster to take a seat and order from a server. Bad advice.
 
10 minutes until the server arrived at our table. She was astonishingly gruff and impersonal. 
10 more minutes until our drinks arrived and we had an opportunity to place our food order.

Throughout our wait, we watched our server transform as she frequently danced with other patrons 2-3 minutes at a time. As she left the dance floor, we all took turns attempting to catch her attention for drink refills.

50 minutes later Server McGruff arrived with our cold food. The appetizers came with the meals... cold.

So, again, everyone's food was COLD... perhaps a side effect of the dancing.

Never got the second beer I ordered.

My wings arrived with sauce that appeared to have been cut with water. They were the sauce would not stick to the wings and pooled at the bottom of the bowl. No additional amount of re-tossing in the bowl helped. The sauce was definitely watered down.

Dear God. My burger was beyond well done. It had been ordered medium. It had a curled desiccated look. I ate it. It was as dry as it looked. We all struggled through our meals. Were all famished. And it had become a running joke of Just How Bad Can This Experience Get?

We were ALL disappointed. The server received a 10% tip off the pretax amount of the check. I'm still angry with myself for rewarding our Happy-on-the-Dance-Floor-Irritated-to-be-Serving-Us server.

In the past I have recommended organizational celebrations from my work take place here. Definitely rethinking that now."}
{"text":"Enjoy coming here with a group, cooking our own grub and playing in the sand. Evenings in April and May are great, as are September and October. Winters are a bit chilly after sunset, and the summer... well I don't need to explain that one. 

No great deals on food or drinks. Service is hit or miss but I come for the company and don't really mind. Order a few pitchers and your grub to cook, then pretend you're at home having a BBQ. No service required!"}
{"text":"This is a pretty cool place to hang out.  They serve food so i ordered up a breakfast burrito.it was big and came with tater tots.  I was hurtin from the night before so they surfed me some bloody beers and that was nice.  Volleyball courts outside and plenty of seating on the patio.  I give this a great rating!"}
{"text":"I came here with a group of 6 people and it was alright. Came inside and had no idea what was going on. I just wish they were more organized. We went to the bar and decided to get some drinks and the bartender was really nice! Got a drink and decided to sit outside near the volleyball court which I think it's really cool how they have 2 courts, can play horseshoe, pool, and there's a lil playpen in the sand for kids. That's why they get one star. The servers here are not really that attentive. I had to flag someone down to get a menu and order food. The food wasn't too bad. My bf had the wings and he said it was really good. I ordered the beef sliders with onion rings. The onion rings are really good but the meat in the burger was really dry and barely has any taste. It's super under seasoned. You can bring kids here but they are all to be gone by 8. It's a different environment and vibes, it's fun, I just wish they had more friendlier people."}
{"text":"If your a volleball player it's a fun time.  Never ate here or cooked my own food but I enjoy pitchers of blue moon while playing.  Not the greatest place to watch a sporting event, I think an outdoor large screen or just tvs outside would enhance this place quite a bit."}
{"text":"Rad bar in NE, Mesa. Cheap drinks, Awesome customer service, Volleyball, Fire pits, Pool table, Decent live music, Grill your own food & you can bring your dog! The greatest qualities any bar can have! I live about 1.5 miles from the Monastery, can't wait to visit again!"}
{"text":"Pretty neat and unique venue, definitely want to go again. 

Although this is a burger joint, I had the Authentic Tacos.... They were unbelievably delicious, I was so surprised. 
I imagine their burgers are delicious too since that is their specialty.

It's cool to see people playing volleyball and the live music was good.

I understand people's complaints regarding the seating (yes, very random, yes very squished together).

I also understand the complaints regarding service, it wasn't the quickest I've experienced. Our server was apologetic stating they weren't expecting to be so busy and she was all in all efficient. 

The Monastery kinda reminds me of a large version, hole in the wall venue.
I would definitely go there again."}
{"text":"This is my favorite bar in Mesa! Lots of drink options and an awesome environment. They have fire pits, beach volleyball, giant connect four, horseshoes, and live music. The food is great and they have the option for you to grill your own burger which was a lot of fun with a group of friends. I highly recommend The Monastery!"}
{"text":"Came for lunch. From what I saw, all of the seating is outdoors - so don't come here if you want to be inside or away from the heat. They do have misters. We were the only ones in the entire place, 1 waitress. Believe the other reviews when they say the food comes out SLOW and not at the same time. Half of our party was done before the other half got its food. Quality of the food was just OK, nothing to rave about, burgers come plain, just cheese, no other toppings.

Only reason I gave the place 2 stars instead of 1 is it LOOKs like a cool spot, maybe it's better at night - but I won't be going back during the day."}
{"text":"We stopped here on Memorial day week-end to watch a hot dog eating contest they had advertised on Facebook along with a litany of drink and food specials.  Well long story short, there was no contest, no jello shots, etc. . . . It seems like this place doesn't offer what they advertise.  We had sliders and philly cheesesteak.  Sliders were less than average - the philly cheesesteak was served in a hot dog bun, coleslaw was terrible.  May visit again since this place looks to have potential,  but won't be coming for a meal.  Food is not good."}
{"text":"Overall a fun place to hang out with friends. The food is so-so ..but the drinks are cold and there's plenty of opportunity for fun."}
{"text":"So, this is a fun place to go. I read all the reviews on here. I'm not sure about the food, when husband and I and friends go out, we go out to party, not dine :) Even if the bands are average, after a few beers and good company, they sound great! There's tons to do, it feels like a backyard party. I loved the fire pits and people watching. The only negative I have about it is not finding enough time to get there :)"}
{"text":"if you don't have a wonderful time here, there's something wrong with you... or you're a drama queen (scottsdale brat), etc.  this place attracts the laid back bbq party type of people and the place is set up that way.  tons of stuff to do, you won't be bored."}
{"text":"We went to the monastery for a friend's birthday. Finding a spot for all of us to sit was not a problem since the property is rather large with multiple large-scale sitting areas to accommodate small and big parties. The atmosphere is nice and provides large-scale Games music and good lighting throughout. The prices for alcohol we're very high. The staff consists of overwhelmed teenagers it looks like they're on the brink of a nervous breakdown at any moment. There's only a few of them so the service is rather slow because these poor kids are running around like chickens with their heads cut off. Senior staff sit around and watch these kids struggle to provide good service to everyone inside the restaurant. The food is absolutely ridiculously gross. The prices are horribly High for no reason because the portions are not large. We purchased the nachos which were nothing more than a handful of tortilla chips on a plate with cold lettuce and a light drizzling of nacho cheese everything was cold and disgusting. The nacho said that there was Chicken on them which we paid extra for and we never found any chicken. Someone in our party ordered a chicken sandwich which was delivered to them after waiting for about 45 minutes and the chicken was completely Raw like they had tried to cook it frozen. They took the sandwich back and try it again but when it returned to the table it was burnt to a crisp almost as if a joke was being played on the person that ordered it. Another person or party order to Pizza which was pretty much just dough and a light sprinkling of cheese. What a group of about 12 and the overwhelming response was oh my God how is the food this bad. We all spent a s*** ton of money for very little return. The restaurant is a novelty and if you want to go there to sit by a fireplace and have a bottled beer it is perfect for that anything outside of that guideline is unfortunately going to disappoint you."}
{"text":"Okay, 4 stars is a little generous, but I've been stopping here once in a while for years now and they've made great improvements by adding a kitchen and a full bar. You can still cook your food yourself on the outdoor grills, but at least now you can order off of the menu like at a regular restaurant. The menu needs improvement and the food is inconsistent and overpriced considering the unpredictable quality of it. Overall, it's a fun place with great volleyball courts, a pool table, a ping pong table (or two), fire pits in the winter, occasional live music, and that beanbag game Cornhole or \"Cornholio\" as I like to call it (think Beavis and Butthead)."}
{"text":"its a great time. I love going here because its like hanging out in your yard with family.
always have a good beer selection and food is bar food."}
{"text":"Could be a fun place if they had better service. Not very friendly or personable. I am almost thinking that is what they are supposed to be known for."}
{"text":"I don't get it. 

What's the point of going OUT TO EAT if you have to cook your own food? I thought $5 was pricey for a bun, slice of cheese and unseasoned beef patty you have to cook yourself. For just a few more dollars, I could get a delicious cooked burger from Four Peaks with beer-battered fries. 

The crowd is older here. The patrons could have been my parents' age, if not my grandparents. 

I went for a friend's birthday. I adore my friend, but not her restaurant choice."}
{"text":"VERY unimpressed.  Had to go big the kitchen for my wings cuz after 35 minutes...... kickstands up in 15.  Finally got them to address my order an my two orders of wings came as ( order 1 - 6 wings )...... ( order 2 - 5 wings ).   For $9 an order I think I should get more than 5-6 moderate sized wings.   Brought it to their attention and they blew me off w some bs explanation that their wings are 2x the size ( THEY ARE NOT ).   Save you $$ and go elsewhere"}
{"text":"Pros: Dog friendly patio, huge yard w/volleyball, live music, happy hour at 11am weekdays.

Cons: HORRIBLE non-HD, damaged and even TUBE TVs!! This place is leaving SO much money on the table by completely ignoring sports fans!

Food is mediocre. Need healthier options too.

Staff is mostly decent.

Bathrooms are gross."}
{"text":"My wife and co-workers met on a tuesday. It is a fun place to play outdoor games but they didn't allow some of our teenage boys stay after eight. Ok place"}
{"text":"It was a fun place to spend an evening. The service was pretty good considering we were a large group. 

The food was okay, not bad, not great. I had a steak that they cooked for me, which came out more medium than medium rare. Not horrible, just not what I was hoping for. 

You really want to go here for the ambiance more than the food. If you wanted to cook your own meal, you could probably cook it better at home. 

But it would be a fun place to take a date! Pool tables, ping pong, horseshoes, volleyball, and live music!"}
{"text":"The guy didn't bring us our drinks (just soda) and we sat at the bar for 15 minutes. Only when I got up to grt my own did he try to assist. The waitress (long black hair) was swearing at the other employees. Some kids came in asking for change.  Long black hair waitress told them get out, go ask your parents you shouldn't be in here (they were about 11 years old a day respectful). After 50 minutes waiting on grilled cheese and chicken  we went to ask cooks. Who never got the ticket.  The guy at bar was very dumb and didn't even send our food ticket...when cook asked him for ticket he said no I already sent it. He refused to work as a team. This was the worst customer service experience I ever had.  The place looks cool and relaxed. But the workers at the bar were horrible.  Really hope they fire the dumb guy who won't even work as a team."}
{"text":"The Monastery is a great place for kids until 8 PM when they kick out all of the families that brought their kids.  I sat down on the patio by one of the sand volleyball courts at about 6:20 PM.  It took five minutes for the waitress to make an appearance (6:25 PM), and another ten minutes for the waters I order to arrive (6:35 PM).  Apparently, you have to order menus as well.  Most places just give you menus when you take your seat.  I order our menus, and five minutes later placed our order for food (6:40 PM).  At this point, I sent my daughter off to play.  She tried her hand at volleyball.  On one of the sand courts, a mixture of adults and kids were having a friendly game.  Everyone was welcome.  Then she ventured over to the other court where the kids were just playing in the sand.  Around 7:20 PM, I couldn't see her from my table and initiated a fruitless search.  She finally came running out ten minutes later looking for the bathroom.  There was a hidden play area with sand and sand toys.  After visiting the bathroom, we placed our raffle tickets at the table with the prizes we wanted to win.  A charity for animals was going table to table, trying to raise money.  At 7:30 PM, a waitress came out with food, but wasn't sure what table it belonged to.  At 7:40 PM we were told that our order was just about to come out, and that we were lucky that we placed it early, otherwise it would have been an hour and a half.  Somehow, by 7:45 PM, it seemed like it had just been about an hour and a half.  Maybe we were just starving, but the food seemed good.  The personal pizza wasn't enough for my daughter.  I would have order a second one, but I didn't want to wait around till 9:15 PM for a second pizza.  We were promptly told to leave at 8:00 PM.

What I discovered, is that the best way to enjoy The Monastery, especially if you have kids, is to eat somewhere else beforehand.  Under no circumstances should you ever order food at The Monastery, even if only half the tables are full.  Enjoy the volleyball, the other games, and the sand toys on a full stomach.

By the way, we won a prize from the raffle."}
{"text":"Forgot our order. Cold food. Very well done burger ordered medium rare. 2 wrong beers. Ugh."}
{"text":"This 5 Star review is for MORGAN!  Morgan was our server on Sunday afternoon March 4.  We had a group of approximately 20 people.  
In addition to our large party, she served other large groups with reservations as well as many other unexpected walk-in parties.  Morgan handled each patron of all said parties efficiently and professionally.  Her ability to keep track of separate checks is truly remarkable."}
{"text":"Horrible service at the outside bar. Place was dead. A lot of servers walking around. It took ten minutes to get the bartender to ask for our order. Then 10 more minutes to get a beer. The bartender was too busy talking to  the only people at the end of the bar. She didn't seem to care we were there. We left to go to Cogburns. Always great service there!"}
{"text":"If you like a place that is so noisy you can't hear yourself think, this is for you.  Imagine a bar in the middle of a elementary school play ground, the throw in not enough servers.  Granted I'm not a sports bar kinda guy, the name just made me think this would be a little more upscale."}
{"text":"Very casual place, great if you want to play some volleyball or horseshoes. I'm a fan of the cook it yourself grills.  Not a big fan of the food they prepare for you though.  The beer selection usually has 1 or 2 drinkable beers but their selection is mostly a bunch of the big watered down beer companies or pseudo fake micros like Blue Moon.  You can also bring your dogs and kids which is a plus and a minus for some people. Great for group outings."}
{"text":"Food is good not great - it is a burger joint. Atmosphere is perfect for after a round of golf and the live music .. nice"}
{"text":"Awesome venue! I hosted my wife's birthday party here. They helped with the planning, great service and and awesome space. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I hosted a snow party today for dogs. The Monastary was more than accomadating. They provided great service. This place is dog friendly with good food and a nice place to hang out. Special thanks to Tiffany and Cliff for going out of their way to help us have a great time!"}
{"text":"Pretty cool place with lots to do. We sat down and had a guys cigar smoke going in my kids face. So we had to move seats. My Philly cheese Stake was cold but the rest of my family loved it. They didn't charge me for my sandwich."}
{"text":"This is a pretty cool place to go to while in Mesa. It has it's very own outdoor beach with tons of activities to partake in. The food is pretty dang good and the prices aren't too terrible. This is the place to be on a Saturday night in Mesa. With live music, local libations, and drunken beach volleyball, how could you not have a blast?"}
{"text":"It's amazing how rude some of the staff can be at times. Also, I've never seen so many inbred Hillbillies the one place in my entire life. The music has been very mediocre in the three times that I've been there but the last time was the worst. Forget this place."}
{"text":"I am not sure why I'm writing this review, since I have noticed that the manager or owner seems to not try to make things right for customers. I went on a Wednesday evening and I will say that the location feels like someone's backyard barbecue party. I can definitely see the appeal. I chose to order nachos, I feel like nachos are always a good/safe choice for food at a new place I have never been. Words can't describe how awful these nachos were. The chicken was flavorless, the cheese was from a can and tasted like cheap Highschool football game cheese. The topping were barely there if at all and there was a weird lettuce on them. The bathroom was surprisingly clean, however both soap dispensers weren't working. The paper towels were empty, which was a surprise since it wasn't busy. Thankfully they had a power dryer to dry my hands. I would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"My favorite bar in the country was the Monastery in East Phoenix, mostly because of the sand volleyball court, but I also loved the self-serve BBQ, the fire pit, ping pong table, free water jug, the bench swings, shuffleboard, dogs, feral cats, 80's semi-porn adorned bathroom walls, etc. (Nice bushes.) The ultimate unpretentious hang out place.  

Monastery Mesa doesn't have the same charm, or hitsory, and it's much too far from the homes of my siblings to visit frequently, so I've only gone twice, but I guess it's technically my favorite bar."}
{"text":"Visited for the first time Sunday afternoon to attend their \"Chili Cookoff\". It was only $2 each to participate and try 20 different recipies. Great outdoor space with volleyball, bags, and other games, live music, grill your own food, plus the chili we voted for won the contest!

I think this might end up being a regular hangout even though it is 30-min from Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Smells like old people. Slow service, wings are decent but mostly fried food. More about attraction than food.
Don't bring kids after 8 pm. Over priced for bar/fry food"}
{"text":"Service sucks! Service sucks! I would like to order a bottle beer!. . . They don't have time for that. .   This place is fantastic if they had a server or bartender that cared about something other than drama!. . . Did I mention that service sucks! . . Well it does!"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely atrocious! Horrible people! Nasty pics in the bathroom !! You let the children see that!!? BAFOONZzz!! Yallz food took to long and it taste like donkey booty! And the people!?? H to the IPPY! Smelly and dirty, just how we don't like! I'm never coming to this church again! *drops the mic*"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to go with the kids for lunch.  Bring a small amount of $ - grab yourself a table under the trees and enjoy the afternoon away while your kids play within eyesight.  The entire \"patio\" is really a large, fenced grassy, tree filled area with 2 volleyball courts, multiple gathering areas, ping pong, horse shoes, jumbo checkers and even another fenced in area full of sand and toys for the kids."}
{"text":"I recently visited this location, though I had been to the one that used to be in Peoria before.  We came out from South Phoenix to join some friends for a birthday celebration.  I am definitely a fan.

I am not sure what the whole free taxi thing is about but this is a chill place to come hang out with friends.  They have volleyball, horseshoes, bean bag toss, etc that you can check out the equipment for using your keys as collateral.  I know that you grill your own food for the most part, though we did not partake of that experience this time.  

The best part is that this place is pet friendly, though I wish they said so on the website.  We came later at night and all of us in the group have dogs and wish we had known we could bring them.  We will definitely be coming back and bringing our crew of dog lovers.  It is out of the way but definitely a fun time."}
{"text":"HOT WINGS!  They are FANTASTIC!!!!!!!!!!!!!   Just saying.............. First time I've tried them here and glad I did!.  I don't typically like to order or eat chicken wings because if you don't eat the skin, there isn't anything left. The waitress suggested that I might prefer them \"extra crispy\" and YEAH!  FANTASTIC!  I just don't like that fatty stringy skin and then to find out there is no meat after removing the skin..  These however, were super crispy on the outside and very tender and meaty in the inside.  (They actually have meat on the  bones).  Even during \"Happy Hour\"!    Normally I take the skin off and there isn't any meat so I usually just skip wings but I won't here.  They have so many varieties of wings (which I love).  I tried the medium buffalo but I'm looking forward to trying other flavors..................."}
{"text":"Yea, this was NOT a great experience.  

A group of us went yesterday around 11:30 and apparently they had just opened.  The tables and chairs were all wet from the recent wash down on the patio so after drying things off, we finally sat down. 

About 10 minutes later, a server stopped by (we were the only group there by the way) and asked if we would like drinks.  Yep... most of us ordered beer from the tap.  10 minutes later, we get our drinks.  

It was a half hour later, I went searching and asked him to come back and take an order for food.  We all placed order for appetizers.

Half hour more passes..... nothing.... we ask for the appetizers and got some Ore Ida Tater Tots and tacos that Taco Bell could have beat.

Needless to say - I'm not going back and unless the management figures it out, I'm very sure many others feel the same."}
{"text":"I wish this bar wasn't in the middle of nowhere. 

I like The Monastery. The crowd is chill although there isn't much socializing at the bars. I have not (nor do I plan to) played volley ball during the weekend tournaments but there are always tons of people on or around the courts. 

There is a live band on Saturday nights and they are pretty consistent. You know the usual: 40 something rhythm section with a Female lead rocking a tambourine.  Of  course not everyone loves all the music being performed. I listen to everything so I had no complaints about any of the songs being sung,. But I did hear some murmurs in the crowd and requests for more JIMI HENDRIX! 

Big downer. They only serve beer, wine and premixed margaritas. 
Big Ups: Cheapo  pitchers . YAY
Something Weird: They have a menu but you have to prepare your own food on the outdoor grill. 5 dollars for a cheeseburger and I have grill my own stuff. grrr. They could at least spring for higher quality beef. 
Plus Side of cooking at the outdoor grill is yucking it up with my fellow bar patrons. 

Nothing about the bar made me feel ill at ease. I have enjoyed my visits thus far. 

Oh and one more thing- If you drive to the bar and your Designated Driver drinks to much you can get a free cab ride home. Now you HAVE to have driven to the bar, not cabbed it. Some people complain about the false advertisement. You ask what the stipulations are before you decide to get ripped."}
{"text":"The service here is terrible. I hate how people can smoke here (doesn't make sense to have physical activities and smokers in the same spot). My mother had her 50th birthday party here. I had a lot of fun playing the bean bag toss, horse shoes, ping pong, and sand volleyball. On a November night, it is freezing! The band was terrible and could only play 1 genre- undanceable rock music. Plus there were like these floozy 40 year olds trying to dance sexy and it just made the place look trashy. So a waitress takes orders on our food and she brought it out 30 minutes later and still uncooked. She only brought out the chicken tacos cooked. I would have cooked my food sooner had I known that she was just bringing it out and going to take half an hour. Never came to check out on us and didn't really let us know what we could order. The bartender was great, but the service is not. The food is ok. NOT vegetarian friendly in terms of cooking your food on a meat cooked grill. They have a veggie burger and foil, but no veggie thongs to turn over the veggie burger and no clear definitions of what sauces have meat products in them. I'd never come back here unless my mom paid for me again."}
{"text":"great place for adults and for families! they have great food, the cheesy fries are crispy and gooood! the burgers too are awesome, and they have one of my fave foods: deep fried cheese curds ...yummm!
it gets quite crowded in the evenings and there have been many birthday and going away parties held here. we always sit in Ashley's sectionshe is very friendly and efficient  be sure to try an 'angry balls' drink: it's hard apple cider and cinnamon whisky..delicious and refreshing"}
{"text":"The bartender's rock!! Thanks Will!! Their website SUCKS!!! Can you say, \"FALSE ADVERTISING\"? I thought you could. Their website states, \"Ask your server for a free taxi.\" What they REALLY mean to say is...\"if you drive your own vehicle to the bar, they will give you a ride back to your car in the morning for \"FREE\"....which is standard policy with Discount Cab at ALL bars.....you still have to pay for the taxi cab ride home. If you're going to abide by their policy, you should just use The Drunk Driver's. Their service is much more cost effect than The Monastery's \"free taxi\" service. DO NOT GO TO THE MONASTERY WITH THE INTENT OF BEING RESPONSIBLE AND USING THEIR \"FREE\" TAXI SERVICE.  What a joke!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"So I went here for the first time last night for the BF's birthday with some friends. It was a lot of fun! I loved all of the activities, we played horseshoes and other people were playing volleyball, pingpong, and some bean bag game. The alcohol was fine, nothing to get too excited about, but I don't think this is the kind of bar to go for specialty drinks or anything.... it's about hanging out with friends and playing games (for free :-)). I did have one of their frozen daiquiri's, and man, it had quite a bit of alcohol in it. There were some interesting characters here last night...They had some cover band of Jimmy Buffett or something, so there were a lot of older people (dressed in too skimpy clothes, but that's their prerogative). We grilled our own cheeseburgers and that was fun. They provide a bunch of different seasonings for the burgers and then also a bunch of toppings. They also offer to grill it for you if you don't feel like grilling it yourself. Overall, it was a really fun place and I would like to go back.

 Also, as far as having kids leave after 8, I was surprised there were kids there to begin with.... it is a bar after all. I think all bars have some time limit where kids can't be around anymore, and I think that's for the best.... who wants kids at a bar? And also, it could be an unsafe environment for a child anyway."}
{"text":"This place keeps getting worse and worse. Slowest service EVER! Came for some drinks and was told the person to access the taps won't be here until 3. That's just one example. Someone needs to buy this place and actually teach people how to run it."}
{"text":"At first I thought i was back in a ski lodge in Missoula MT. Very cool place. For all different kinds of people. There was an outdoor bar with live band, vollyball courts, and indoor bar. The wings were very good and prices were good too. The service was good. I would go again but go with an open mind."}
{"text":"Came with a group of people to introduce them to a neighborhood place we'd been to before. We were embarrassed that we suggested the place. The waitress provided horrible service....we had to constantly flag her down or go to the bar for our own drinks. We waited 55 min. for food to come out. It wasn't very busy and the food was basic bar food. When we brought our concerns to the manager ( who was also tending bar ), he had nothing to say and didn't seem to care. During the conversation he took our drink order, turned around and helped 4 others who came in after us instead of pouring our drinks.  We opted not to spend another dime, cashed out and left. They lost 11 customers that night."}
{"text":"A friend of mine booked an all age event here weeks in advance. The moment we arrived  anyone under the age of 21 was refused entry. I just can't figure out why there were so many children running around??!!!! The owner/ manager at the time couldn't even come to the door herself to let us know why all of a sudden there was an age requirement. Very unprofessional!!!! It is clear we were being discriminated! If your neck is not red, you don't belong here."}
{"text":"I was brought here since I was 10 and it is still the place I come to on Sunday's for family volleyball. It is an awesome place to bring friends for relaxing, watching a sports game, listening to live music, and play recreational volleyball!

They have good food at decent prices and certain days they have good specials on beer. You have to be 21 or be with a parent to get in as it is a bar.

They have league volleyball on certain nights and I know Sunday's it's open court. 
They also have lots of games to keep your kids busy and they are pet friendly! 

Well known spot for bikers to come and relax and have drinks as well as lovers of outdoors and volleyball."}
{"text":"Unique atmosphere. Volleyball outside with other games. Sweet! Everything was going great until we went to the bar. When I go to a bar I expect a 'hey how are you! Let's make your night great so you buy a shit ton of drinks!'. All we received was 'oh I heard you were looking for a good night! We'll drink your beer and go the f*ck home'."}
{"text":"I've always said this place has had great potential, unfortunately for me it's never lived up to it. Went there last night for cinco de mayo since they were opening up their \"taco shop\" and it was a local place. The place has a lively atmosphere, there usually is a lot of kids so it your looking to get \"turnt up\" then you should turn around.. Hahaha! Anyhoo, they had a do playing the most invigorating and popular hip-hop music including none other then the legend himself Will Smith! It made for a confusing night wondering if it was cinco de mayo, or the dj just for it his other computer with the mexican music. We hung out by the volleyball courts which they have 2 of. Had a few beers, stopped into a empty inside bar area where I considered ordering 2 tacos for 6.99. My first thought was \"damn, are these made from a sacred cow\" but then I figured they were just probably so big and amazing so I pulled the trigger. Worst 7 dollars I spent since buying 24 miniature lick on tattoos from a machine in front of frys, because I had to have the panther fighting the python. The tacos were dry, the amount of meat made me think we were in walking dead and they had to ration it.... I chewed on the same square of meat 4 times before swallowing it just so I could feel like I got my money worth. The dj wrapped it up around 930, which blew because I was starting to get jiggy with it... When the dj called it a night so did it, and went to another livelier place. This place is alright if you want to get out of the house and enjoy the weather and play outdoor games (horseshoes, bags, volleyball), and relax with family and close friends but if your looking to not deal with children, and have a great time and meet new people of go elsewhere. I don't want to bag on this place to much. I have had burgers on the past that you cook yourself that are delicious (probably because you cook them yourself) but it is a chill place. I may just bee too social, for this place..."}
{"text":"The Monastery could be an amazing hangout in Northeast Mesa...but it's just not that great. It's such a unique outdoor venue, but the service is so poor I always wonder why we return. 

Pros: 
-They allow kids.
-It's a very cool outdoor space with volleyball, horseshoes, ping pong, and fire pits.
-Live music on the weekends.
-You can bring the dog.

Cons-
-They allow kids. Yes, I know I listed that as a \"pro.\"
-Food is pretty average and healthy options are nonexistent, but I'm happy to see a full service menu.
-Service is ABYSMAL!!!

Let me illustrate our most recent experience:

Incident #1
As we were waiting at the bar for our drinks, a waitress walked by and spilled most of a beer on my sister. She did say \"sorry\" as she continued to walk by. A minute or two later she came back and apologized to ME, as my sister stood behind me  emptying liquid from her shoe. Accidents happen, but we both thought this was at least worth a free drink.

Incident #2 (different server)
Sister: This seems like a fun place to see live music. What types of bands play here?
Server: I don't know
Sister: When do you usually have bands?
Server: I don't know
Future Husband: What beers do you have on draft?
Server: I don't know.

Incident #3
It's been quite a while since we last saw our server, but when he finally comes back I order \"chicken strips with a side of ranch and barbeque sauce.\" 45 minutes later the food comes out drenched in barbeque sauce.
Me: Hey, I think I have the wrong order.
Server: No, you ordered chicken strips with barbeque sauce.
Me: No, I ordered chicken strips with a side of barbeque sauce. Can I just get regular chicken strips?
Server: This is what you ordered. You didn't say \"side of barbeque sauce.\" 
He continues to argue and finally agrees to fix the order.
Server: You need to understand that the chicken strips are going to come out exactly the same way. I just want to make sure we're on the same wavelength.
Me: Obviously we're not on the same wavelength. Will they be covered in sauce?
This whole thing was ridiculous. I'm pretty sure that Serving 101 is don't continue to argue with the customer.

Incident #4 (at the table next to us)
Server puts down glass of white wine.
Woman: I ordered pinot noir.
Server: This is pinot noir.
Woman: No, I ordered red wine.
Server: Are you sure?

Obviously our night was a fairly extreme case of bad service, but this isn't too far from the norm. We've been coming here for years and it's always been this way."}
{"text":"This place is the biggest joke ever!!! Went in, it took over 45 minutes to be acknowledge. And once we received our beers, it took another 30 - 45 minutes for them to come over and bring us another one. When we went up to the bar, they wouldn't give us the time of day. Our friends ordered shots of Jim Bean and they were told that they didn't have that in the bar. There was a bottle of Jim Bean sitting with the other liquor behind the bartender. The bar staff was super rude and completely inattentive. This is literally the worse bar I have ever been in. If they are that short staffed on a Friday or Saturday night, maybe they should hire more PEO rather than making the customers suffer. This is the first and last time I will ever step foot in this bar again. We waited for over 30 minutes for our bill and after asking 3 times for it, we walked out and didn't pay our bill. I don't understand how this place could be fun or the IT place to go to. People are rude and super intoxicated and the security does nothing to control the idiots that are there drinking. And the fact you pay $5+ for a burger or hot dog you have to cook yourself is ridiculous. Then you have to tip on top of it. Total waste of money and time. Avoid this place like the plague."}
