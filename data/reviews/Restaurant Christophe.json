{"text":"Simply Exquisite !! À quand l'ÉTOILE?"}
{"text":"This was our first time in Montreal and we had absolutely no idea where we were so we looked for a french restaraunt on Google and found this place. We walked in still in our traveling clothes, way underdressed for this place and the waiter treated us like royalty.  The waiter on Friday May 25th, we didn't catch his name, was amazing. He tranlated the menu, suggested dishes we should and shouldn't eat with the wines we brought and told us which places in Montreal we could not miss. We each has an appetizer and an entree and everything was just amazing. We plan on coming back to Montreal and we plan on coming back to Restaurant Christophe as soon as possible."}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant! They have a small, cozy French Bistro neighborhood type of atmosphere. And the food quality is fantastic. I always order Foie Gras in any good restaurant, but Restaurant Christophe always has the freshest, most delicious, largest portion and most original versions that I've ever seen. It's a BYOB, so don't forget. But make sure it's a good bottle, you'll want it to match the food quality."}
{"text":"Cozy BYOB establishment for sophisticated new French cuisine and tasting menus. Romantic and affordable depending on your menu selection. Always enjoy my meal there."}
