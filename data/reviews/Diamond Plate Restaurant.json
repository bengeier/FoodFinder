{"text":"Disgusting, I'd give it a Zero star if I could. Got the fish \"special\" for $15.50 and got 3 tiny pieces of soggy beer battered fish that tasted spoiled, along with soggy burnt oil tasting French fries, and it came with hush puppies, supposed to be plural, but the cook made one big flattened lemon size one instead and dipped it in the same burnt oil for probably 5 seconds, it too was soggy and no where near cooked inside, a shame if you know real hush puppies. To top it off, it came with a side of again, soggy and no crunch cole slaw that was so bad I spit it out on top of my nasty fries. This all came with a blonde, obviously drinking on the job waitress/bartender, who was completely unprofessional and even slightly louder and more annoying than the drunk customers that she was enjoying the company of. Don't waist you money in this joint, you don't even want to know what the bar area smells like, horrible and unkempt. Go to Mc Donald's next door, I'm sure their food is safer, and the employees will see that you are waiting to order and they aren't obnoxious drunk unprofessional idiots."}
{"text":"I went out to dinner with my husband last night we are on vacation so u know we were getting tired of fast food and was looking for something tasteful and hearty the restaurant/bar is not real fancy but seems to have a few people in there so I decided to give it a try there was only one waitress for the whole place and she was focus more on the bar then the restaurant so It took awhile just to get a menu the prices are a little high my husband got a cheese burger with fries and a side of there chips and salsa the cheese burger was good fries were to soggy to eat but the chips and salsa were fresh and crisp I had the pork chop dinner it came with a salad bake potato broccoli and toast the chops over cooked potato was dry but the salad and broccoli was great would I eat there again probably not!
