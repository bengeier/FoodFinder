{"text":"This venue is essentially an emptied out warehouse with plastic lawn furniture put on the inside.  We were promised a star chef, but in reality got chicken kebabs and rice served cold and buffet style.  They claim their chef studied in Lyon, France for five years but it was clear he was studying at a local fast food restaurant the whole time.  The event was supposed to be open bar but they had run out of all alcohol by 11 pm, even though they only had one bar and three bar tenders for over 150 people.  I would highly recommend not going to this venue!!!!"}
{"text":"Food is ok. The menus has no price on it, and the sevice is really slow , maybe just because it was a satuarday , only opened for soccer event .....any way won't hit this spot again."}
{"text":"This business recently changed names from MountainView Coffee to District 28.

District 28 is trying to build itself as a bistro type cafe.

Location:  Good - in the heart of the Stuido district of Toronto.
Hours:  Website has no posted hours, but they are often open at 7:30am.
Service: Usually very good.  The staff, for the most part, are pretty nice....though they don't often engage in friendly banter.

Food:  There are cookies, muffins, croissants, chips, chocolate bars, and sandwiches.  They changed their name about 2 months ago with the advertised intent on being a lunch and dinner place with a full service menu.  This still has not happened.

My Breakfast Experience:
I went in there one morning to grab a muffin on my way to work.  There were none baked yet.  This was disappointing.  You are open for early morning coffee, but you don't have anything to go with it.  When I asked how long they would be, I was told they weren't even prepared yet.  So breakfast get a FAIL grade.

My Lunch Experience:
When they changed names, they started making their own sandwiches.   For the most part - they are quite good.  They do, however, have one best seller....the BLT.  Sadly, they haven't figured this out yet and it is always sold out, leaving people to either wait 20 minutes for another batch (if they are even going to make one) or they have to buy one of the other sandwiches (these are good enough - but not their best).   I usually just leave if they won't be making another batch.


Today (October 8) I went over to the cafe at 11:30, thinking I was going to be in plenty of time to get at least 2 BLTs (they are smallish), but at 11:30, there was only 1 left.  When I asked about another batch, I was politely told there probably won't be one any time soon as 'they' (as she waves towards the kitchen area) have left on a 'run' and she doesn't know when they will be back.

OVERALL:

The sandwiches are good and small enough that you are not going to feel like you have eaten too much if you have 2 or 3.  Most of the sandwiches (aside form the BLT) have some sort of cheese or avacado something on them - but they are dry.  No other sauces/butter at all.

The prices are reasonable.
The service is OK
the selection of food is basic (you can see their photo of sandwiches on their website)
The selection of drinks available is wide.

There are a lot of people in the area - and with such poor selection of food, and food availability management - they are not making friends.  If you just want a coffee - then you will always be happy.  If you are after food - then you will likely always be disappointed.

As for the 'event venue' they boast (Hang 10 Media) - I can't comment on it - however - if they don't improve their service and selection, it will be hard to attract anyone to actually use them for events....there are so many other places in the city that do it so much better.  The website lacks in information for anyone, like me, who might be researching venues for upcoming or corporate and personal events."}
{"text":"I was here for brunch with a friend on a Saturday, and the place was deserted....usually not a good sign. This space is huge with loft high ceilings, it's great for large crowds and events. I ordered the apple french toast which was way too sweet for me. But my friend ordered crab cakes benny and it was amazing! I totally loved it! They substituted crab cakes for the English muffins and it turned the bennies up to 100! I would return here just for that dish and to sample more of their menu to see if there is anything else as delicious as the crab cakes. Also our server was super nice, but then again, we were her only customers :)"}
{"text":"Highly recommend the Jerk Fried Chicken with Waffle. Hidden gem, great food friendly staff!"}
{"text":"Amazing venue! Would love to hold an event there.  Open house was so much fun. Great show.  Great food.  Great wine. But most of all...great people.  The staff there were so nice and accommodating to all guest's needs.  

I would definitely recommend this venue to anyone  I know that is looking for a space to host an event.  You should go check it out.

Based on a 'blank canvass' concept, they have a ton of rooms that clients can do anything with the space.  They have a list of vendors with food that is amazing.  Art of Food had this southern fried chicken drumette served with a jalapeno cornbread muffin with a charred corn salsa....out of this world! I could eat those....a lot of those....any day! 

They also have a very chic cafe there during the day.  Great coffees, pastries and sandwiches for a quick grab & go! Check them out!!!"}
{"text":"Came here for a business meeting for lunch. 
Private room was excellent. Great coffee. 
Good food and service from the staff. 
The lunch bowls and sandwiches were excellent. 

We will be back for another meeting here soon."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times for coffee but today I stayed for the jerk chicken sandwich special and a beer. I was expecting average, I got awesome!  It was a special, so not there everyday but that sandwich was out of this world so the chef has skills!  The coffees always great and I like the staff. It's a hip place to grab a Joe and go, or sit and sip coffee or beer and have some amazing food. Thumbs up from me!"}
{"text":"This place has a great menu concept with terrible execution.  Mother's Day brunch service was deplorable with more than an hour of wait between order and food delivery. Only a single order ever came out and we had to cancel the other three and leave.    Clearly this place isn't ready to be busy.  With such great food and service options in Toronto I can't recommend this place for anything.  The location is great - so perhaps it will find itself occupied by yet another new business that understands the importance of quality AND service.  1 star is generous for this level of service experience. Unfortunately the whole restaurant was full of people with the same tragic experience.  The worst part is that after all this they decided to still charge us for the drinks and single entree."}
{"text":"I work in the area and am always busy so i need to get my food and go... I've only had take out from this place twice now. The first time it was a burger and fries, and today was another burger (Mushroom Burger) and kale caesar salad. I asked for the burger not to have peppers, but unfortunatly came with. The burger I had the first time was maybe a 3 out 5 as the burger paddy was tasty. The bun (Brioche) was hard on the outside. Im used to buns that are soft and melt in your mouth... so this might be fine for others. The mushrooms were cooked perfectly... along with the peppers. The salad was not good. I paid 25 bucks for this and the food does not live up to those prices... I will not be back."}
