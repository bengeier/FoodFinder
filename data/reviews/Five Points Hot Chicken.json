{"text":"Overall, the chicken was decent but not great value considering the price. My experience was mostly soured by the service I received. Whoever served me was extremely impolite, not to mention slow. Would not recommend this place to anyone, really. Head to PG Clucks if you want quality fried chicken in Toronto. Open house is an alright spot, though..."}
{"text":"13 bucks for a breast... Very expensive. Wasn't busy, about 25 minutes for the piece of chicken. Huge fries for 5 bucks. Medium was very hot (wuss)."}
{"text":"Been hearing a lot of hype about Nashville fried chicken and decided to try it. This place is located in the back of a bar close to Bloordale. The bar is pretty dark but it's not as dank as it appears and there is some seating on a small patio outside.  The chicken is fried from fresh so it took approximately 15 minutes to prepare. They give u a pager that buzzes when it's done I got a leg and a thigh for $11. It's an attached piece as oppose to two separate. I decided to be cautious and got medium and found it had a little flavour but barely spicy. The skin was pretty crispy and the chicken moist. But honestly there was nothing that really set it apart. And after spending $13 for a chicken quarter with no sides I felt a little ripped off. Sides were another $5 (as opposed to $4 on the website)  Maybe u have to go spicy to get a true feel for the Nashville fried chicken experience but this was pretty meh for me"}
