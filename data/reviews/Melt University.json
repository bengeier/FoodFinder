{"text":"This was a terrible meal. The Case Western chicken barbecue melt: Texas toast bread soaked in fake butter and toasted with barely 2 tablespoons of shredded BBQ chicken on it and some melted cheese. The barbecue flavor was too sweet. The french fries that came with it were mushy. The tomato soup tasted like it was made with ketchup. All that in a metallic, cold cafeteria style environment made it just plain inedible. This soup and sandwich plus a mound of soggy fries, with only water, cost $16!"}
{"text":"For being a melt it isn't that good the fries are too hard two sandwiches aren't made like the other melts this typical college campus"}
{"text":"I am a big fan of Melt in Cleveland Heights, and there is obviously similarities between this one and that one, but it's just not the same. There is always twice as much bread as the other ingredients, and I find myself craving some of the specialties like Parmageddon or the Mighty Macaroni, but of course they don't have those ones here. I do enjoy the Awesome Noodle #1 salad, but sometimes I just want something a little more... cheesy. 

Also, sometimes the staff here can be preoccupied with other things, like chatting to each other, so it can take a while to get your order. Just plan ahead if you are stopping here before class or something."}
{"text":"The menu seems to change seasonally. However, the price for a simple order of fries remains cheap - only $2 for a plate of fries! Salty, greasy, and simply amazing! Eat them while they're hot, because once they start to cool off, they become more solid, chunky, and just blech."}
{"text":"Love the food and the service. My only complaint is the lack of available parking spots. The first time I've been there, I had to park almost a block away from the restaurant."}
{"text":"This is a great fast Mini Melt restaurant that still keeps the feel of the real ones and has some unique to CWRU sandwiches like the Case Western BBQ and The Spartan Burger. I don't know how the service is usually because I went while school was out. Excellent new eating area that has only been open since around 8/1/14. They give you a ton to eat, but it's not cheap. For my wife and I it was around $17 and I got a water, that being said I have dinner now also because the sandwiches are enormous. Giant fresh Texas Toast like bread with creative grilled cheese, what's not to like. I thought the fries were good also, larger sized fries, not McDonald's fries and not home fries either. I had the Chorizo and Potato grilled cheese, which it looks like the online menu has not been updated because it was not on there. I almost got the Wake & Bacon, but I was very happy with what I got. The chorizo did not have much of a bite, but had some good flavor to it, so if you're worried about the description saying \"spicy\", don't worry. Only downside is bring plenty of cash (for Ohio, not LA prices), but you are on a private/exclusive college campus and the food is great!"}
