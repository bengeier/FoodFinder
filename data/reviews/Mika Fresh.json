{"text":"Best soups in North York, and everything is actually delicious. I didn't even know I liked turkey patties, but I really really do now. It's well priced, especially considering it's so fresh and tasty. I cannot understand why there is not a line up. I eat lunch here when I can, a soup, sour dough bread and some amazing veggies and meat too.   I must have driven by this place over 100 times before walking in, but walk in to become a brand new loyal customer like me, if you like great food made by people who are passionate about it, and that is sold at a great value."}
{"text":"I would love to give Mika Fresh a better rating.   When they first opened, I happened by quite often. Mika Fresh happens to be on one of my frequent walking routes. I'd try out their soups and stews and bringing home freshly-baked goods. As a new dad it was poised to be a regular destination.   But a funny thing happened on the way to the bakery-I'd walk by on a Saturday, or a Sunday, or an early weekday morning (usually with a baby in a stroller, trying to cajole a nap)...and the place was closed.   Don't get me wrong-as far as I know, Mika Fresh is still in business-they just don't seem to be open any time I'm around.   Review of the hours listed show they're closed on the weekend, open at 11:30 (long after I've gone to work) and close by 6:00 (before I get back-or if I am, I'm usually bathing a small, squealing, splashing person). These hours make great sense if you're among the office towers and condos of downtown Toronto.   It's a curious choice for the weird mix or residential and industrial spaces along Dufferin.   Aren't bakeries supposed to open early? Don't coffee shops stay open late for young couples who are still trying to impress each other?   I'd say \"maybe they see me coming and draw the blinds\", but really one look at me would tell them I would be a keen supporter of a place that sells rugelach.   I'd love to come back; have some soup. Maybe a sandwich on their great homemade bread. And I'm always up for coffee.   Maybe after I retire, and a mid-weekday walk seems doable."}
{"text":"I love all the Mediterranean cuisine here. There's so much vegetarian and vegan food. It's a lovely place. It's a bit pricey though. I believe it's made with organic ingredients. I don't know when they will come back to the Ashkenaz Festival at Harbourfront Centre. I enjoyed seeing them there. I want to see them again. They also have places to sit down and eat your lunch. If you want Catering, Mika Fresh has got that too. The owner is Mika Naor and she's Israeli. Before it was Mika Fresh, it used to be a tea house."}
