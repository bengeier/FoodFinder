{"text":"Worst customer service I've had in a long time. Got off work late came in at 9:30 on 5/15/18 and the cashier seemed irritated my wife and I came in so late and then we sat at the bar to get a drink and the bartender did not say hi nor greet us at all and didn't offer to get us a drink at all and other than the food being good the experience was horrible."}
{"text":"Best subs around. Definitely worth driving to eat. Their cookies are always good. Their meatball sandwich is the best meatball sub I've had so far."}
{"text":"Something for every taste! Cheba has a unique menu with lots of interesting savory combinations and yummy munchies like rice krispie treats. I got the Acapulco Gold on wheat which was absolutely delicious. I'll be definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place is the bomb.com! What seperates them from the rest is their extensive menu, and their crunchy bread. The atmosphere is super fun & chill, and staff really helpful. Will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"Don't let the weed theme keep you from trying this place.  Fresh and unique ingredient combos make Cheba stand out from most other sub shops.  Do yourself a favor and get a goo ball for dessert. Location is handy if you want to catch a movie afterward, because it's right next to AMC theater."}
{"text":"they offer great quality sandwiches (my favorite is the pakalolo with ham, swiss and pineapple) and is a wonderful respite from subway, quiznos and hamburger joints which we all know so well. the staff are both friendly and eccentric and they manage to retain a relaxed atmosphere to eat and hangout.  they're conveniently located next to AMC theatres so give them a try the next time you go to see a show!"}
{"text":"It pains me to rate any Cheba Hut location less than 5 stars but I have to for this location. I've ordered the pinner White Widow over 200 times in the last decade - whether it's the various locations here in the Phoenix area or even in Denver. This location was the only time my take-out bag didn't feel like a dead body was in it - it always feels heavy. Always. But not this time.   As soon as they handed me my bag tonight, I knew something was off. At first, I thought maybe they made me a nug. But no, this was a pinner but the inside was extremely lackluster. This sandwich should be dripping from the ends when you eat it. But this one was about as full as a Subway sandwich.   I'm going to give this location one more shot and will update my review accordingly, but wow Cheba, you've finally let me down. That sucks."}
{"text":"Had an awesome experience here. Such personable, polite staff and they were so sweet to my young son. I didn't want to be looked down on for taking my toddler to a sandwich shop of, umm, this variety... They were so sweet to him, he didn't want to leave. I love this place."}
{"text":"I actually don't have words for how good this place is. I'm picky (and also following other diet restrictions) and I LOVE IT!  The Apollo 13 is bomb. It's like a Greek salad only hearty with the bread. Hummus is rad and the French onion soup is better than my own. DOH!  From the lady on the phone to the one who helped me at pick up...100%. Go here. Thanks Cheba!  Made my Night."}
{"text":"I had an awesome time today at their 4:20 celebration it was a lot of fun and the food was delicious. The staff is super friendly and my friends and I got stickers and rolling papers! I work across the street so I will be here a lot"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The food was great (everyone loved their sandwiches and we all ordered different things), the restaurant was cool (a bunch of cute little jokes everywhere that were hilarious), and the service was pretty quick. We had heard it was a good place to eat before it opened, but it exceeded my expectations. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"By far the Best sub sandwich you will Ever eat!!!  Super fun place and Fantastic employees!!!  This is a Definite MUST try!!!!"}
{"text":"What is there not to love about Cheba?!? Their sandwiches are so delicious and unique and never disappointing. I think I could eat here for lunch every day. They have a very fun casual ambience and this location has a nice patio to also hang out and have your meal. Then you can just walk over and catch a movie right after. So far the two times I have been to this location their employees have been friendly and had my food ready fast. I like their bar area it's small and cozy, but it does the job and it seems like in the evenings they have a special going on because their beers were $3! So glad they opened a Cheba so close to me."}
{"text":"It's got all of the best qualities from the Tucson location with a little more elbow room. Cheba Hut never disappoints! Good food, fun decor, and a friendly environment. Hope this one sticks around."}
{"text":"What a bad ass place to get a toasted sub! Ive been to all of the Cheba Huts around the valley and this one has taken my heart! The employees are very nice and I didn't have to repeat my order like three times as usual. The guy in front of me has an issue with his order and the manager was there very quickly to resolve the issue and not just that but he walked away a very happy customer. I cant believe how on point this place is for only being opened for two weeks! Stoked Cheba Hut made it out to Tukee!"}
{"text":"Been going to Cheba Hut in Glendale for years.  The menu has changed a little, but it's all good.  This is my first visit at the Ahwatukee location and I love it!!  Clean, kind, and courteous.  The fast and exceptional service is why I will be back!  Plus I love the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Love the food and the staff is always so chill (go figure). The Cali Mist is always my favorite. If you're in for a sweet treat, ask for their cookies heated. It will taste like it just came out of the oven!"}
{"text":"I had the nug Midwest Best on garlic bread to go and it was delicious.  I added mayo and dijon mustard and took off the ham and they were fine with that.  The service was friendly and sandwich was yummy.  I'd recommend!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went there ,for lunch....wow what a pleasant surprise. I had the Alcalpuco Gold which is chunks of marinated chicken smothered in bbq sauce on a toasted garlic roll with Swiss cheese, lettuce and tomato. My wife had the Humboldt which consisted of mushrooms, avocado, sprouts and tomatoes also on a toasted garlic roll. The bread was amazing. It's what made good sandwiches great. Although we didn't partake, they also offer a full bar. If you haven't been there yet you definitely need to give it a try."}
{"text":"Great sandwich shop. Friendly staff, fun environment, they serve alcohol! The sandwiches are fantastic and unique. Don't get hung up on the weed stuff, it's worth going. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Holy deliciousness! This is my new favorite sandwich shop by far. This place has fantastic dessert options of a variety of fountain beverages, works of Garden goodies to load your sandwich and they even make it toasty if you want! The customer service is superb from Jordan, the cashier who greets you with a friendly smile. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Placed a Togo order here today, first time trying out Cheba Hut. Ordered two subs with a couple modifications, but nothing crazy. The woman on the phone was rude and very short. We had asked for onion and tomato on one of the subs, and was told it came on all of them. When we got our food however they weren't on there and neither was the dressing. Both food items were made incorrectly. Would try again, maybe it's an off day, but thoroughly disappointed with my first experience here."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, yummy sandwiches, also liked the hummus munchies, and I like the overall concept. And many kuddos to this place for using earth friendly Togo packaging (I hate dining places that uses toxic styrofoam or plastic to wrap my food in).  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"The bad review is not for the quality of food , but the service. There was a very tall thin young man (didn't get his name) who took our order, was not the most friendly . Never asked if I wanted Parmesan on my sandwich I specifically asked what was the details of the house dressing . Anyway my boyfriends sandwich and mine came out but to my surprise there was Parmesan on my sub ... I do not eat dairy (if you are thinking I'm picky ) that is why I make sure of the topping before hand ... he took my sub and said they would re make it . They never re made it and we waited for about 20 min we had to go up and they cooks didn't know about it so ultimately the only person at fault was the guy who took my Order in the first place .... will not come back here"}
{"text":"So, I had my first sandwich here yesterday and I'm back today! Lol I guess that says enough...great sub and fresh ingredients. Pretty good customer service as well."}
{"text":"I've been to Cheba hut before and I like their sandwiches and I'm glad they finally open here near my apt.. I ordered the AK-47 (French dip) with a side greek salad.. I came during the lunch rush and for the most part I got my sandwich pretty fast.. the only thing I'm kinda taking away a couple stars was that they totally forgot my side salad.. and I think it was the manager? But he assured me he's just waiting on that and he thought someone was making it.. so I waited, and waited and kept waiting.. and finally 10 min later I finally got my side salad after the guy kept telling the staff to hurry up and make it bc I've been waiting  on it for awhile that they forgot about.. he was apologetic at the end and he ended up giving me rice krispy treat on the way out.. other then waiting on a side salad which it felt like forever.. the food was pretty good otherwise"}
{"text":"Very stoked to have a new Cheba Hut in Ahwatukee serving up toasted subs and good beers!  I made it down to their grand opening and have been back several times since then, their subs are excellent!  This location has a nice patio with a long, high, bench-table suitable for a group, as well as regular 2 and 4 seat tables.  There are many other interesting businesses in the nearby area.  No matter what kind of sub you like, with their 'build your own' option, these guys are prepared to deliver.  Towards the back of the inside dining room, there's also a full bar and at least half a dozen craft beer taps.  New Belgium's HPA is recommended for the full-on, dank Cheba Hut experience!"}
{"text":"This was my first visit and for now I will withhold judgement besides the 2 star rating.  The employees were great.  I ordered the KGB but got a sandwich minus the 'shrooms & Swiss.  The sandwich was ok but I think I would hold off on the green peppers the next time.   Definitely a step up from Subway."}
{"text":"Super happy to hear about another Cheba Hut to hit the east valley. Also really happy to hear they chose a location in the Tukee suburb area, a little risky but they seem to be doing very well. The Orange Widow with no mushrooms is always my go to. Lastly I was really happy to see some familiar faces from the North Tempe location."}
{"text":"First time l stepped into this eatery concept and l liked it!  We ordered at the counter, menu is up above our head. Easy choices, three types of bread, white, wheat or garlic. Garlic for Both of us. I got a Humboldt veggie sandwich medium size with shrooms, sprouts, tomato, avocado speead. Ron picked the Alcapulco Gold, chicken sandwich.  We were served quickly in casual plastic baskets.  It is like a Subway with a full bar and a 420 atmosphere.  Desserts and small bites are listed under \"Munchies\". There is a street sign named \"High street\"... You get it!  We really enjoyed our sandwiches there, their bread makes all the difference! They also use freshly baked chicken not the deli chicken made out of compressed chicken meat saturated with sodium.  Staff is very friendly!  It is right around the corner of the AMC theater, so a great place to eat before heading out to the movies!"}
{"text":"So delicious! Best toasted sub I've ever had! The spicy Jamaican chicken sandwich had the perfect amount of spice! My husband loved his turkey and roast beef as well! Must try! Will definitely be back!!!!"}
{"text":"I've waited for this moment for so long and it's finally here... The sandwiches are so delicious.  Plenty of choices and let me suggest the garlic herb bread because it is so tasty. Enjoy the laid-back environment and fresh made food. Three sandwich sizes are Nug, Pinner and Blunt (I think you can decide which one is the smallest and largest)."}
