{"text":"This place is great! Really good selection for quick sandwiches and delicious spanish food. Nice chip and beer selection as well. The owners and their daughter are the nicest people! Always happy and eager to help and will make great recommendations. Definitely come here if you are in the puritas area and would like a good sandwich or need a convenience store."}
{"text":"I will give this place 2 stars just because they have FAYGO pop 3 for a dollar.....Besides that the Deli sucks and I wont be back because for 7.99 I can do better with my money....Really I expected better than a overpriced cornbeef!!!!The chip selection is good and beer selection is decent....After a days work I want something better than this place I went out on a limb and got screwed....I went back to 56 miles on a empty stomach because I through the cornbeef out the window!!!!"}
{"text":"The corned beef was good, but no where near \"the best corned beef ever\" as I was told by some of the people in the neighborhood. I will say that the owners/staff were very friendly and helpful. There is a wide selection for a deli inside a convenience store. Convenience Store had a large variety and relatively good prices too. There are quite a few hot food options, fried chicken, empanadas, and other items of Spanish flair. The food was pretty good. I am sure I will be back. It's not on the top of my list."}
