{"text":"Maybe I just had bad luck. Ordered some bone-in chicken for delivery through Just Eat. The delivery was 45 minutes late and the chicken has terrible! Not only cold but the coating on the chicken tasted like cardboard. I tried their Garlic sauce and it didn't live up to the hype of reviews. Maybe this is a eat in kind of restaurant but definitely don't order from here. The Fry is soooo much better!"}
{"text":"very similar to the idea of a popular restaurant, home of hot taste. I enjoyed the experience here and the food was very authentic."}
{"text":"Loving the atmosphere here and their music is to my likings. Not an alcohol kind of person but I really do enjoy their Cheese Bulduk. Ordered Fresh Off the Amazon, really like how refreshing it is.   Recommend to come guys."}
{"text":"Food was amazing! Not comparable with other kfc places.. It may be pricey but after hearing what goes into the chicken, definitely worth the price! Love the atmosphere, the music, the food, and the servers are wonderful ;)"}
{"text":"Great friendly service, good fried chicken, amazing sauces.  Very thoughtful service! (I'm a broken record)"}
{"text":"Chicken is a bit pricey for the amount they give for two people. The sauces they have were good at least... But $40 bill for chicken and one beer that didnt make us full, and as a proclaimed korean place it was my first time I was not offered kimchi! Was a bit dissapointing"}
{"text":"The fried chicken isn't so bad but I did came late around 11 pm so there's wasn't much space to dine in but the amount in the take out box was decent for price."}
{"text":"If you're here for Korean Fried Chicken, I would recommend you to go somewhere else. We walked in on a weekday evening around 7pm and ordered the boneless half chicken with spicy and green onion sauces.  The chicken wasn't \"bad\" per se, but it definitely was not what we expected in terms of quality and quantity. We expected the chicken to be much bigger and taste like the \"authentic\" korean chicken, but it reminded us of more a kaarage (Japanese chicken dish) and the portion was small. Sometimes we would get chicken that had very little meat inside, and we were just crunching on the bread crumbs.  The service was okay, neither stellar or bad. I did enjoy the atmosphere because it was clean and hipster-ish. Overall, the food wasn't too great, so I don't think I would be returning here again."}
{"text":"Came here at around 10pm on a week day. There were a few other people there, eating things that looked delicious. We got the fried chicken sampler and the seafood hot pot.   The chicken was, I thought, perfect. You could tell it was good quality meat. Just the right amount of breading. Three great sauces. (We liked the garlic one the most.) Though the sampler looks small, I thought it was very filling and the two of us could have probably stopped right there.   The hot pot was unlike anything I had ever eaten before - broth full of tofu, mushrooms, and an impressive amount of various bite-sized seafood that I couldn't even identify - and it was amazing. Very flavourful and very fun to eat.   The prices seem large at first glance, but we ended up being happily full for around $25 with leftovers to spare. I just had some of my leftover hot pot for lunch. It was just as amazing.  The service was lovely, very nice and helpful.  I especially liked that the music was good, and more importantly, not too loud!   I'm hesitant to even write this review because I'm kind of worried that if they get more popular, they won't be able to be as good anymore. But oh well, it was just such a great experience. I definitely hope to come back."}
{"text":"Worst Chimac(Korean Fried Chicken) place I have ever been to.  Way to salty, greasy, disgusting chicken, horrible service.  Simply put, It's not a food but pure garbage"}
{"text":"Awesome place! I tried alfredo and yangneom chicken with few side menus fries, deokbokki and caesar salad last week. It was amazing!! New taste, so delicious!"}
{"text":"The bulgogi pountine was amazing. The chicken was even better with yangnam sauce. Cant wait to visit there again  If your coming with friends, i suggest playing their games near the bar."}
{"text":"Korean dive bar with fried chicken. The chicken was fried well and seasoned nicely. They had a large variety of sauces which was nice, however they charge $1 for each little dish of sauce.  For sides, we ordered onion rings and fries. The onion rings had a nice crunch. One of the few restaurants that I've been to in the city that still offer curly/spiral fries."}
{"text":"Their cheese buldak was REALLY good; it was very cheesy and was sizzling in a pan with rice cake and a good amount of vegetables. Their fried chicken tasted really good and they give a good variety of other sauces for the chicken and fries.   The service was really good! There was a misunderstanding with my order and as an apology, they took off one dish from our bill.  The restaurant was pretty nice inside; they had these cute pillows with their logo on it."}
{"text":"Queen Street Pricing alert for all the budget strapped people. Me and a friend went to try their KFC and it did not disappoint. Came with two sauces, we chose yangneom and garlic and both were delicious. The chicken came out crunchy and they gave us finger condoms so we can eat with our fingers and not get the mess everywhere.   You can ask for the sauce to be separated and refills on the pickled radish."}
{"text":"Expensive and subpar. We got the boneless whole chicken for a whopping $35 plus $2 for sauces. The portion was SO small. The chicken was not even good. There were pieces that were just fat globules and membranes with no meat in it. See the pictures!!! Our bill was $45 after tax and tip just for the plate pictured."}
{"text":"Chimac Chicken is a new pub/restaurant replacing Thai One On on Queen St. near Portland. I have been keeping my eye on the new Korean Fried Chicken spot and was happy to see the doors open. Turns out they were doing some training in the kitchen and offering the chicken free for tasting. I had four large wings. The coating was a little too heavy and the tomato based sauce was too bland. Next they brought me some dark meat boneless nuggets. These were nice and crunchy!  The bar looks interesting and they will be serving the popular Korean drinks and cocktails.  They will be perfecting the deep frying (they politely asked for my feedback) and adding many more dipping sauces when everything is up and running. Can't wait!!"}
{"text":"Good food! I loved the Yangneom sauce for my fried chicken, good price as well... The mozzarella stick can do better though, I think a better sauce for it. Overall, everything was fine."}
{"text":"I really really did not like the food here. I saw this place on a BlogTO post on fb, and felt the urge to try it, but general rule of thumb, things on BlogTO usuay look better than they taste. My biggest gripe with the place was the price. We ordered a full plate of boneless wings, and side of fries, and a pitcher of beer, and it ended up costing $70+ with tax and tip. I've paid more for meals before, but it was what I paid for that really bothered me. We ordered the korean sauce on the wings (the name escapes me) and it wasnt good. It did not taste like other korean wings Ive had in the past, and they serves it on the side so it made the wings taste colder. Overall, this place is just hype, and not very good for its price point."}
{"text":"Average Korean chicken bar. It is on the lower lever and does not have accommodations for people who are handicap. I came with a group of six and the owner wasn't the friendliest, more impatient. Food is nothing special. To be honest, I've tried much better at many other surround chicken places. It's more like a pub style and does not have too much space to move around. Open quite late and atmosphere is casual."}
{"text":"Chimac is the newest Korean fried chicken place on Queen West near on the north side of Queen between Bathurst and Spadina close to the corner of Portland.  The place definitely looks more upscale from the many KFC places I've been to both in town and out.  We arrived around 630 and we were able to get a table.  I found it sort of unusual that they had pillows in some of the seats.  Really the pillows are plump and in a chair there'd not be much room to sit with them but what ever it's different I suppose.  They do have what you'll see at some Asian places is that they have call buttons on the table.  You don't have to wait for service or for a server to pass by to flag if you want a refill on your water or anything really, just use the button.  It may seem informal but it's practical and saves time don't ya know.  We were a party of 3 and we wanted a variety of flavors and enough to satisfy our fried chicken cravings so we went with a whole chicken,  bone in and selected 3 sauces (Yangneom, Pa Dak and Jack Daniel all on the side.  As each is described:  Yangneom - sweet & spicy Korean sauce Pa Dak - wasabi sauce with green onion Jack Daniel - Jack Daniel based chili oil sauce  The mountain of chicken eventually came out.  Honestly for a full chicken it looks like a lot but when there's 3 of you and it's bone in it's not as intimidating as it may first look.  I noticed the batter on it was rather crunchy and so thick, bubbly - almost looked like Popeye's.  That's really not that common from what I've seen from my KFC experiences.  If you didn't tell me this was Korean fried chicken (or supposed to be) I would have no idea and it's not really distinguishable as such.    I suppose what I'm saying is that most KFC places I've ever been to the coating of the chicken is not like this.  It looked more like any other fried chicken.  The batter is rather thick and since it's a whole chicken the pieces are also indistinguishable.  I had no idea what I was grabbing for the most part if the pieces were not a wing or drum since the rest were just some sort of piece of chicken coated so thick I couldn't tell what anything was.  The chicken was fried chicken and the sauces were on the side served in dishes large enough to dip and turn our pieces in to get them sauced.  The sauces had some good flavor but nothing really stood out to me.  I was expecting much more boldness from something that says wasabi (even the mashed potatoes at the cheesecake factory served with the Hibachi steak have the wasabi flavor) where the Korean chili sauce was just meh and the JD sauce which was 3 bucks didn't seem special.  Chimac to me on this occasion didn't really impress me.  I love fried chicken and I have had it at many places and this experience for me just wasn't necessarily memorable.  It doesn't help that the prices are sort of in the Mymy league but for what it's worth the service and place is nice.  Even though Kaboom is far from what may be considered the more traditional KFC places like Mymy, Dakogi or the Fry - they're still my favorite KFC place in Toronto."}
{"text":"Chicken was nice and juicy. Location is very convenient. Pricier than some korea town KFC places but it's to be expected because of the location. Plus half a star for an awesome 2000's hip hop playlist"}
{"text":"Had the boneless fried chicken with korean spicy sauce and rice cakes. Chicken was tasty and crisp, the rice cake were nothing special. The service was very good,I like the atmosphere and music they were playing. Over all a good experience, however, it is overpriced, and poor value. For that reason I am glad I tried it but I would not return."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why some of the reviews are critical.  Here's the basics of an experience that you would want when going to a place like this:  The ambience: It's slick, contemporary and mid to upscale, It's clean.  The service: Attentive, friendly and earnest. Love the buzzer thingy  The food: Excellent! We tried many items from the menu that are not typically available at Korean restaurants, which we frequent regularly. The Buldokki was delishymatously cheezy decadence. Now, you didn't come here to eat low fat low-carb diet food now, did ya? The stuffed Lychee dish was unique and awesome. Fried chicken had mucho grande flavor and nice crispy.  These guys are really trying hard to be different and provide good service. Highly recommend trying them out a couple of times at least before you decide."}
{"text":"It's a good spot for some after bar eats. I thought the soju cocktails were a bit overpriced, but I guess that's how it goes. The chicken was amazing (we got the spicy one, boneless, mix) and some rice cakes and pickled daikon. It's a little different (not authentic Korean though), delicious, and fun to eat."}
{"text":"I went with a party of 5 and we ordered the cheese dakgalbi, alfredo and yangneom mixed boneless chicken, and pineapple cocktail.  Based on the other review, I was looking forward to the chicken having a crispy/crunchy outer layer, but that was not the case.  The alfredo sauce was something new and thought it was a neat twist, but the yangneom flavour was very underwhelming, basically tasted like ketchup.  In regards to the pineapple cocktail that cost 22 bucks, you are basically paying for 750mL pitcher that was filled mainly with sprite and only a hint of alcohol and the fruit flavour-way too overpriced, might as well order yourself a can of sprite. The cheese dakgalbi was good, but still thought it was overpriced. Overall, the food was not bad, but it's too pricey and thus not worth it.  There are plenty of other Korean fried chicken restaurants that serve chicken at a better price and for better quality and taste, like mymy chicken.     In regards to service, there was some incident that happened in the kitchen which made us wait for our food for 45 minutes.  Also, the restaurant can work on their customer service.  We were barely checked up on, and it was very hard to wave down a server when needed even through the buzzer."}
{"text":"Huh. Yelp has a strange way of knowing where I've been recently. No, I didn't check in. Perhaps it's because I've been looking at their business listing.  The picture of the menu from May(?) that someone put up on Yelp is outdated now. They no longer have the tasters (sad times). We ended up getting the solo combo boneless with fries ($10.99). I asked for it without fries though. Unfortunately, that didn't qualify me for a discount in any way. We also got the yangnyeom sauce ($0.99? $1.99)? There were two of us, and we just wanted to try the chicken. The waitress said that the portion was barely enough for one person, and asked if we wanted to order more, which was kind of her, but to me, there's a problem if it's called a solo combo and it barely feeds one. I can't think of any situation in which barely and food go together in any good way.   The chicken itself was tasty, but the breading to chicken ratio was off. Too much breading, and not enough chicken. There were pieces where I would take a bite of what seemed like all breading and no chicken. And the waitress was right. The portion isn't the greatest. At $10.99 with fries, it's alright, but at that price, I'm also expecting sauces to be included. The yangnyeom sauce was meh. It tastes like the one I make at home, and I'm not pleased with the one I make at home. I have yet to figure out how to fix mine, so I can't say what was wrong with theirs, but I was not impressed.  On the upside, service inside the restaurant was decent, and when I messaged them over Yelp late last night asking if they had a lunch menu, they were very quick to reply and sent over a picture of their lunch menu, so service online was very good.  I'm in no rush to come back for the chicken, but thanks for the lunch menu!"}
{"text":"Ordered beef burger. $15.99. Terrible. Shaved pieces of beef with no favour and topped with lettuce and tomato and topped with a cold (not toasted) bun. No sauce. Partner had Korean style half chicken. Chicken was good and flavour was good. But for $23 with no sides... not worth it. That meal with 2 beers and tip cost us $70. Wasn't worth it. Won't be back. ChiNOPE."}
{"text":"When I heard about Chimac opening up I was super excited to go.  Then I started reading the reviews and was, in all honesty, put off a little bit.  Nevertheless, I thought I would go and check it out...and well it was AMAZING!! Claude was our server and he was absolutely wonderful!  The food was delicious, well priced and plentiful.  I can tell you it appears that the owners are working hard at rectifying any of the comments about bad service etc.  This is a must go in my opinion.  The boneless chicken was nice and tender, the sauces were to die for and don't get me started on the Cheese Buldak - so cheesy, so well spiced....YUM!"}
{"text":"Came here for a quick dinner before a show at the velvet underground (which is just conveniently next door) and was so pleasantly surprised! We tried both the bone in and boneless options and both were crispy, delicious, and juicy! My issue with most Korean fried chicken places has been that the pieces of meat are sometimes weirdly cut and dry. That was not the case here. I think the bone in is my fav, and it doesn't hurt that the full order comes in the shape of a mountain (a la fishman lobster clubhouse style).  We also ordered dubbuki which was $13 and pretty small in portion. Even tho it tasted good, it was way too little rice cake for me to order again."}
{"text":"I love Korean fried chicken. Unfortunately, I don't love hanging out at either Yonge & Finch or The Annex, so my opportunities to have Korean fried chicken are few and far between. When I learned that Chimac opened near Bathurst and Queen (closer to where I usually like to hang out), I knew I had to check it out.  I'm usually not a fan of saucy chicken, and I usually opt in for the classic option. However, at Chimac, I implore you to try both the Alfredo Chicken and the Garlic Chicken. They are both incredible, especially the former.  Also, Chimac has those little buttons on the corner of the tables to get the attention of the wait staff, which is one of the best things about eating at a Korean restaurant. You're pretty much guaranteed a good experience with the wait staff, which is essential when your fingers are covered in grease and chicken.  Obviously this isn't something you should be having on a daily basis. But as a treat every so often? Absolutely. Check it out."}
{"text":"I didn't know what to expect coming into Chimac, my friend and I ordered the boneless chicken for two and had the sweet and sour sauce and the soy garlic sauce. Now I am not sure if we missed out my ordering the proper Korean sauce but the two sauces were quite tasty. The chicken was crunchy and moist. The portions were okay, they definitely gave enough sauce for chicken. We also ordered the spiral fries, they were good but they tasted like the McCain's spiral fries you get from the grocery store. The service was great and the people were nice. I enjoyed the atmosphere."}
{"text":"The service is just really bad. They screwed up our order like 3-4 times. Each time they came back out something was wrong with the sauce or the order. The drinks were expensive for what you got it mainly tasted like juice, hardly any alcohol. I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Delicious boneless chicken and sauce. Definitely recommend the yangneom sauce, garlic was good too but yangneom #1 classic. Get the sauce on the side so the fried chicken will stay crispy instead of being smothered under the sauce. Batter was super crispy and well done. A little too rich but really good balance with the pickled radish. Only downside is it's pricy, but would definitely come again when I feel like splurging."}
{"text":"It was great experience dining here. Personally, Black Pepper Chicken was amazing. This place is definitely one of the places that most people will enjoy"}
{"text":"There was a lot of hype about Chimac on Facebook, so we really wanted to try it out. The first time we came a few weeks ago it was SO busy, and it would've been over an hour wait for 8 people. We ended up somewhere else that night. However, the restaurant was nearly empty this time, and never got too busy.   We ordered a whole bone-in chicken with alfredo and soy garlic sauce, which ended up being a great amount for four people. I think I liked the soy garlic better, but I would recommend both. Appetizers and side dishes looked to be quite expensive, so we stayed clear of those.  Overall a decent experience. The waitresses were super nice, but the owner (?) seemed in a foul mood all evening. I appreciated the prompt service, but a smile goes a long way."}
{"text":"I came here for the first time with a friend as we wanted to try out a new chicken place out. The interior of the store was very nice and modern, but there weren't many tables or seats. Luckily, we came at a good time and there were plenty of seats available for us. Taking a look at the menu and wow, it is quite pricey! Half a chicken costed about $20 and a full chicken costed about $32. However, these portions can be split with your friends as it is a bit too much to finish by yourself.   The waiter was very nice and patient as it was our first time here and he gave us a rundown on the menu and such. We decided to order the half chicken and ordered the Jack Daniel sauce and garlic sauce separately on the side. The garlic sauce costed an additional $1, but the Jack Daniel sauce costed about $2. Paying extra for sauce is a bit of a stretch, considering the price of the chicken alone. They took less than 10 minutes to bring out our meal. We were given both forks and little plastic napkins where you can insert your thumb and index finger so they won't get dirty while picking up the food. The half chicken tasted very good and the Jack Daniel sauce was delicious. The garlic sauce was very heavy, and I had a garlic after taste hours after eating.   The portions were great as my friend and I finished the half chicken and were moderately full after eating it. The atmosphere of the restaurant was very nice and relaxing. If you're on a budget, I wouldn't suggest this particular place. Their lunch specials were much cheaper than the chicken and looked quite promising. I might come back in the future and try those out."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner after work on a Tuesday.  When we first got here, there was no one else, but it filled up by the end of our dinner.  We ordered the kimchi poutine and the half boneless chicken with Yangneom sauce.  The amount was perfect for 2 people.  The interior is modern, but a bit small.  The window seat was nice.  The servers were friendly and informative.  The food was good.  I've never had kimchi poutine before, so can't offer any comparisons.  The chicken and sauce were decent, but not as good as some of the other chimac places in town.  I do like the boneless option though 'cause I'm lazy.  Would likely return in the future and try out some of their soju selection."}
{"text":"Fried chicken was disappointing. This place is not similar to Home of Hot taste, hey over charge for chicken. We were about to order boneless chicken for 2 but ran out, turns out bone in chicken is more expensive. Our neighbors got their chicken, they ordered white meal bone in chicken which costs approx $30 + $4 for white meat and they received 4 pieces of chicken. With much dispute and going back and forth to the kitchen, they say they made a mistake and the normal portion is 8 pieces.  Being very familiar with Korean bars I spoke up for them and said bars in North York give way more chicken for less, waiter tried to explain the cost which didn't add up.  I'm sure the chicken tastes great, but be prepared to spend $40+ dollars for the chicken in the photos.  It's disappointing say the least."}
{"text":"Cool place to hang out as it open til 2am. Nice place to chill out with Korean fried chicken. Chef is so generous giving a lot of cheese - cheese buldak."}
{"text":"Called multiple times and was told the wait was over 2 hours, arrived to the restaurant and there was barely anyone. Everything was marked up really high, grapefruit soju is normally $16.99 anywhere else but it was $19.99. Food was very mediocre , and can't be justified for the mark up."}
{"text":"Arguably one of the most expensive Korean fried chicken place in Toronto right now. Normally at any other bars and restaurant they don't charge for banchan, but here they charged for the radish ($1.50) It is unlimited refills so I guess that's not so bad. However, upon inspecting the menu further customers can note the extremely expensive items. I've been to a few KFC places and this is the first place that not only charges banchan but on sauces as well. For just up to 2 servings for 2 people Bone in was just 28.99 and Boneless was 20.99. For the amount they give you versus the price and taste, this place just isn't worth it. The rice cake which comes in a tiny bowl is 9.99 and has more vegetables than actual rice cake. The cheese buldak is outrageously expensive going at 19.99 with again more vegetables than chicken. This experience left us unimpressed and heavily upset. Paying so much only to receive baby food. No thanks."}
{"text":"3.5 stars! I came with a large group of about 20 people for a birthday party.  This place probably seats about 40 or so, so we took up pretty much half the restaurant.  A great place for Korean fried chicken.  You can order half or full portions in either boneless or bone-in.  My husband and I ordered two plates of the boneless with spicy Korean sauce on the side and a side of curly fries.  My husband also had a beer. Came to $64 total including taxes and tip.   The atmosphere is casual, pub-style, with dim lighting.  The waiters tried their best to get our orders out on time but had missed a couple of things such as our friends' meals and our curly fries, which required a few reminders.  I think this place would have deserved another star if the service was more organized and efficient. They did give us $2 off for some reason--possibly due to the delay with our food?  The chicken itself was delicious and the sauce was very tasty. There are lots of different flavours available, and other side dishes too. The curly fries were all broken into pieces and weren't that great. It was $7.99 and not worth it. Another reviewer mentioned that it wasn't as good as Arby's and that's exactly what I had thought as well! Also had a taste of the onion ring. They were battered, thin, and tasted okay, but again--not really worth it. I heard good things about the cheese buldak but I didn't get to try it.  Highly recommend the chicken though and hopefully the service would be better with a smaller group."}
{"text":"Overpriced. Food is ok but the portions are so small for what you pay. If you're hungry and must have fried chicken, get kfc. Your wallet and belly will thank you."}
{"text":"(My visit was in May 2017, I haven't had the time to post this review) I had gone here because of the hype, and my friend really wanted to try this place out since we were on the look out for a new Korean Fried Chicken place.  This place looks nice, and the atmosphere was great. The food... wasn't great. We bought the Up to 4 boneless chicken with Yangneom sauce on the side. We also ordered Ddukbokki and a Frozen fruit shake.  Let's start off with the chicken; it wasn't bad chicken. It wasn't the best, nor the worst. It was okay, and nothing wrong with it. The only issue I had was, that it didn't feed the amount stated (none of us felt content whatsoever).  Ddukbokki is up next. First, they had forgotten about this order and took an EXTREMELY long time to show up. They apologized and soon enough it came. When serving it to us, they said, \"We're sorry, and we gave you a little bit more than usual.\" It looked like an average size plate of ddukbokki. It was very bland compared to other places I've been to.  Finally, the frozen fruit shake for 4. We ALL thought this was going to be a frozen drink type beverage; we were all wrong. This is literally frozen fruit and a handful of cheerios in a bowl of milk. Most of my friends can't handle dairy well, so I ended up drinking most of it. Not the best thing for any of us.   Overall, the entire experience was pretty meh. I wouldn't recommend coming here. The best thing that happened there while visiting, was the spelling bee on TV."}
{"text":"Solid Korean style fried chicken. Fun atmosphere. Not the best service but you kind of expect that. Overall a fun place to go with tasty fried chicken."}
{"text":"Gord and I had supper this evening at Chimac Pub & Fried Chicken.  It's a Korean chicken restaurant.  We shared a whole bone-in Chimac Fried Chicken with yangneom sauce and soy garlic sauce, which was served with picked radish.  The chicken was hot, tender and freshly made.  Gina was our server and she took good care of us."}
{"text":"Soooooooo good!! Me and my friend shared the chicken plate and it was amazing. It was quite a large serving for a reasonable price. Drinks are overpriced (so beware!). But the food is reasonable.  My only complaint is that the TVs were way too loud!."}
{"text":"So salty. Wow. My girlfriend normally eats a whole chicken but when we went to Chimac, she barely touched two pieces. I drank 1L water after our meal. There were minimal to none side dishes. If we can give zero stars, we definitely would."}
{"text":"Fried chicken was great, and so was the cheese buldak, came on a Friday at noon so it wasn't too busy. I would definitely come here again!"}
{"text":"Overpriced, awful music/ambience, mediocre chicken, boring menu. Spicy options were bland and portions were tiny. Never again!!"}
{"text":"After reading some of the negative reviews, I still came here as I was craving Korean fried chicken and wanted to give this place a chance. Let's start with the location. It's excellent and located at Queen and Portland. The decor is cool, hip and inviting, but that is where everything ended for me.  Like others reviewers, the food here is way over priced (including the drinks) The poutine here is not really poutine but a liquidy gooey mess of gravy, cheese and soggy fries, the beer list is very basic and bland, the cocktail list is also way overpriced as well ( and the day we came here all their draft taps were down) and they have a very limited menu of side dishes. Service here was also very mediocre (you shouldn't have to ask for water twice) The fried chicken here though is very good (so good, that you don't really need any additional sauces) but paying a premium for dark or white is just a cash grab (when you order the 'mixed' you get both anyway). I love Japanese/Korean fusion, but sadly you will not find it here. It's not too often I regret coming to a new restaurant, but unfortunately, that is how I felt when I came here. I have no issues with paying a premium for a great meal, but I definitely feel I was overcharged for what I received at this establishment. Don't make the same mistake I did, if you are craving Korean Fried Chicken, don't waste your time or money coming here, unless you are ready to overpay for something you can much cheaper somewhere else. If this restaurant is going to survive, they will definitely need to lower prices and improve the 'wow factor'."}
{"text":"Good  place to hang out with friends. They are having happy hour which offer karaage and a pint of beer with only $12.99"}
{"text":"Spotted on Blog.TO, had to come out!  We ordered a whole chicken and a poutine with bulgogi to split between three people. Chicken was juicy and we'll cooked, batter was light, crispy and savoury; not too much salt, but tons of flavour. We got the soy garlic and Jack Daniel's chili oil dipping sauce in addition to the chicken, and both brought pleasant sweet tones to the chicken. There wasn't too much sour or spicy hints in the sauces as I would have thought.   The poutine on the other hand came with a very creamy, yet flavourful gravy with cheese mixed throughout the fries, topped with succulent, savoury bulgogi and garnish on top!  This was a risky venture that went very well! I will be returning soon to try their late night fare and their cheese fondue chicken!"}
{"text":"A small clean resto with pleasant service. I wanted to try korean fried chicken. With a friend we ordered a full order of Seoul which our server said was more authentic.  It was very good. Had 2 sauces the spicy traditional and the garlic. The spicy was sweet eith only a little heat. I expected spicier. The garlic was delicious. The chicken comes without sides so we ordered fries."}
{"text":"Crispy, tender, and juicy chicken, friendly & attentive service, and a casual pub-like atmosphere.  My friend and I opted for a whole chicken (bone-in and separated into pieces), with two sauces.  We devoured it."}
{"text":"Haven't been able to find a good \"soy-garlic\" fried chicken in Toronto yet, so we were hoping this would be the spot. But Chimac just barely hit the spot.  Although the chicken tasted great during the first bites, we quickly realized we were blinded by our hunger & that it was mediocre (a 7/10 at best). Would recommend ordering the \"boneless\" or \"breast\" version, as the one \"with bones\" came with 4 pieces that barely had any meat.   On a different note: This place hooks you up with the drinks. We ordered a margarita & Long Island ice tea, both backing a great alcoholic punch. Would definitely return for their cocktails again."}
{"text":"The chicken is fantastic! These folks do Korean fried chicken right. Super moist and flavorful, with an amazingly crunchy skin and breading.  Order with bone-in and get the unbelievably tasty sweet and spicy yangnyeom sauce on the side for dipping.  The service is great, the prices a bit high but you'll forgot about that when you TASTE THE CHICKEN!  Call for a reservation or just show up and they'll take your phone# and call you when there's an opening for you.  Love this place!"}
{"text":"The chicken was amazing! We were expecting great chicken cause my friend said good things and they exceeded my expectation. Great job Chimac!"}
{"text":"Just dined here and it was okay! It's a Sunday and long weekend so the vibe was DEAD but the ambiance would be awesome on a regular weekend.  Had a pint of Sapporo, chilli spiral fries, half bone in chicken with yangyeum and padack sauce, and cheese bulddak.  Beer- good.. can't mess that up Chilli spiral fries- not as good at Arby's haha tasted like McCain fries and the seasoning wasn't spicy whatsoever   Half bone in chicken- YUMS! Batter was crispy and chicken inside was moist! The seasoning was perfect, you could definitely just enjoy the chicken on its own  Sauces- lame and waste of money haha the yangyeom wasn't a traditional yangyeom sauce you get with Korean fried chicken. It literally just tastes like a sweet and sour sauce. The paddak sauce was sooooo weird. It looked like the ingredients listed as the description of the sauce was all blended together to make a chunky onion sweet sauce..  Cheese buldak- I don't know why there was two peppers beside the name because it literally just tasted like bbq sauce. Chicken was good and yes.. there was quite a bit of veggies with a few pieces of rice cakes in there too. Couldn't eat it all because it was sooooooo sweet.  Overall good to try once if you're curious, if you're not that curious, you can definitely pass. I'd rather go to Home of Hot Taste by bloor and Yonge. They got similar items/theme and they're tastier and cheaper"}
