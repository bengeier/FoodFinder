{"text":"The idea of having a buffet salad bar as the basic that each person will take is not extremely new, but the way they present it is definitely different. The buffet portion includes pops and orange juice is pretty good for the price they are charging. My son and I went there to try out at lunch, and the lunch menu is well-priced. My son added $3.99 for a 8oz sirloin steak (come on a hot plate with little spaghetti) was very nicely done actually. The only thing I was shock is the 10% tip was not only added without mentioning in advance (with taking cash only), but the tips was actually added AFTER TAX too!  Overall, the food was good and if you get over with the tips thing, you will enjoy what you eat for the price they charge. Service was good too, so the 10% was worth it."}
{"text":"Onion Steak I would've given 5 stars for, as the food quality was excellent, prices were ridiculously inexpensive, quite clean, and staff was decently friendly.  Unfortunately, they are no longer in business, and the new place that took over is horrible. It's now called Fu Kou Le."}
{"text":"Nic place, very clean, the waitress is very friendly too. We enter this restaurant by accident, and it gave a nice surprise. The food in mini buffet is great, especially the cream corn soup. I loved the fried yam too.   I had the beaf steak which was on special. It was a bit over-cooked. According to my bf the pork steak wasn't too well either. But chicken steak is pretty good.  Price-wise, it is a bit more expensive than our regular places, but acceptable. Overall pretty pleasant experience."}
{"text":"This is Combo+Salad Bar steak house.  A newer concept among the other steak house.  I would say this is actually a buffet style steak house.  18 dinner combos ranging from price $16.95 to $38.95.  Price is an average of $25-30/person dinner all inclusive which is not bad.  On the menu it says Lunch Special: Steak and seafood combo 10% off.  All combos comes with all you can eat salad bar which includes salad, fried rice, spahetti, fried fish, french fries, steamed vegetables, fruits, beaverages, coffee and tea, ice cream, cakes and puddings.  We came to eat on a Friday night prime time.  Spacious environment and not too many customers.  According to husband, steak is tender and he likes the spaghetti sauce which is from the all you can eat salad bar.  This is our first visit and we realize our server was not really professional.  We were never informed of how to get food and were never ask if we were the first time there.  They didn't even tell you there is 10% service charge ADDED to the bill and they DON'T accept any credit cards which could be a big inconvenience for group dinings.  Overall food is average as we only try steak and black cod.  But we probably will visit another time some day.  Updates:  I went there a couple of times between 2012 and Apr 2013.  They made changes to the menu revising the price upwards a bit.  I think they do take credit cards now."}
{"text":"I am very much impressed with this place.    The steak and chicken combo means that I would only get a 3oz steak.  I was hungry for steak,  therefore, I  ordered just the steak. (I will most likely return soon to try the chicken)  That way I was able to receive a 6oz steak. It was still SIZZLING as it was brought to my table with a smile!  The mini buffet was also great! If I didn't want steak so badly, I would have gladly paid only $14.95. The Spaghetti sauce was very good and the sweet potatoes also went well with my meal. I'm also giving two thumb's up for the soup! (I enjoyed the corn chowder, but they may rotate soups daily)  The self serve beverage section was also a nice touch! I've never heard of \"Winter melon\"(flavour) but it did taste great!  The iced tea was not watered down, and the coke actually tasted like coke!  The salad section was small, but everything was fresh.  My only alarming concern is that they perhaps won't be able to compete with the Starwalk buffet right next door, which has closed down for renovations, but insists they will re open April 30, 2012. Being a buffet fan it may also be tough for me to decide which restaurant to go to when I'm in the area.  I hope the Onion expands to have more than just the one location they currently have @ Midland & Steeles. (Toronto side).  ***NOTE: I had 5 stars posted, but I knocked a star off because the tip is built in @ 10%, listed on the bill as \"a service charge\". I was the only one at that table.  A built in tip should be illegal when there are less than 6 people at a table."}
{"text":"Originally when the restaurant first opened I would've given it a 3.5 or 4, but I noticed a slight management change, which led to a slight decrease in the service. When I first heard of this restaurant, I thought it was a very unique and interesting concept. I would recommend only coming here for lunch though, because they have a lunch deal where if you want something in addition to the buffet you just add 1.99, 2.99 or 3.99 to the base buffet cost (7.99). This is slightly cheaper than the dinner menu where the cheapest steak is 16.99, while the same exact item is just an extra 3 or 4 bucks on top of the 7.99 at lunch. On my most recent visit though I've noticed that they added more cheap items to the sizzling plate menu, while bumping up the costs of some 2.99 items to 3.99. In addition, new management has become VERY negligent in replacing the empty pans in the buffet section which severely limits customers choices. In a way this prevents customers from getting what they have paid for when they expect some form of all you can eat, since foods aren't being replenished at all.  This place is good if you just want to satisfy a meat/steak craving, not quite willing to fork out the cash. If you expect great steak, you will be disappointed. Otherwise this is a decent place for lunch, but I foresee that with the negligence of the new management this place is bound to spiral downwards quick, so try it out before the place starts to completely suck!"}
{"text":"I really love this place. It used to be a sushi house a couple years back, but I guess they changed food games.  It was good as a sushi restaurant and it's good as a steak house. The owner and staff are Chinese, so there is a bit of an Asian theme to the way the food is cooked and the buffet selection. The food is delicious and well-presented. The service is excellent. The buffet selection is small but good. The dessert is AMAZING for buffet standards.  It's not gourmet or anything fancy, but it's simple and excellent. Worth the money."}
