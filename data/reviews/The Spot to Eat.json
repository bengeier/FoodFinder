{"text":"The Spot showed up at a work event today, and I'm sure glad they did! Food trucks are usually overrated and overpriced, but the food here was good and prices were reasonable. I had a buffalo chicken salad, which was just $6. Lots of tasty chicken tossed with hot sauce, corn, French-fried onions, and Cotija cheese. It was a little overdressed but otherwise pretty tasty.
 
My co-worker ordered a gyro and a side of \"crack fries,\" which was another delicious and reasonably priced option. They also offer sandwiches and burgers, so it seems like there's a little something for everyone.

I'm not sure where or when you might encounter the Spot (although it looks like they may have a permanent location on Dean Martin), but keep your eyes open, because you're in for a treat if you find them on the move!"}
{"text":"Everything I've tried has been excellent.  The food is delicious, the portions large, clean operation with friendly staff.  I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This is one of those \"don't knock it till you try it\" moments from me or whatever you want to call it.  For months I've seen The Spot To Eat truck parked next to the VA office on Palms Airport Drive for almost every other day for lunch. I couldnt find any Yelp listings and never thought of looking on Facebook. Until today when something in the office smelt good and I couldn't figure where it was coming from.

At the truck, its a trailer pulled around by a truck, all the pictures and descriptions just blew my mind, I was excited and upset that it took me so long to finally try it. I saw and even smelt their Buffalo Chicken Salad and I wanted one but held off.  I started asking other's what their favorites were and went with Teriyaki Chicken Sandwich and Crack Fries.  It was delicious on its own and only $7 ($6 for the sandwich and $1 if you add fries). It was a fried chicken with Teriyaki sauce, pineapple, tomato, lettuce, and wasabi mayo between a roll, I mixed up some deli mustard and sriracha and added to the sandwich.  Did I have a smile on my face? Yes. Ordering fries on their own are $3 and ordering almost any sandwich or burgers are $6. 

Delicious looking gourmet burgers at a reasonable price.  Their trailer has a TV with sound.  I usually see them during lunch at the VA Office near the airport but follow them on Facebook https://www.facebook.com/thespottoeat and Twitter https://twitter.com/TheSpotToEat to see all their pictures, menu, and where there going to be. You wont be disappointed."}
{"text":"This truck was at our community's pool in July 4th and they did a fantastic job. The food was good and not too greasy. They have this cool Ernie Corn that is a must taste. The service was also good and quick. One of the best food trucks I have been to."}
