{"text":"Decent food for the price however I've been to better sushi places for the similar price(and sometimes its worth pay extra for better food). Their makis are often sloppy and unfinished looking and certain fish(fresh tuna or yellow tail for example) are not the freshest. I guess it's good for quick lunch once in a while but not for a fancy dinner."}
{"text":"The Gyoza was great.  It was both steamed and fried which makes for a tasty combination.  The sushi, however, was a different story.  Too salty and the smoked salmon is not wise choice for sushi.  Next time I go there I am going to try the Udon."}
{"text":"If I could give this place a 0 star review I would. I'm livid. I have gone to sushi too multiple times, both in the restaurant and delivery. I will say the food is great. I just made a delivery order (for the 3rd time since i moved to Pittsburgh in November) and then was called an HOUR after I made the order and told that my order will not be delivered due to the fact that they do not feel safe driving in my neighborhood. I live in East Liberty, a 5 min drive from Shady Side. The part that I am confused about is that they have delivered to me multiple times before, in this neighborhood and now are refusing to.   If they didn't feel comfortable delivering to me I would have understood if they called 5 min after the order to inform me but they called an HOUR after the order was placed. On top of it they told me to come pick up the food, but would not offer any sort of compensation!   HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!!!"}
{"text":"Rolled into da 'burgh for the weekend to watch the Phillies/Pirates games.  My wife and I used to live in Pittsburgh and had originally made reservations at Umi, but on the day of ended up eating a large late lunch and decided to cancel.  But as the night wore on we grew hungry again and were stuck in Shadyside.  It was getting tough to find a place that was open, let alone had an available table, until we stumbled upon Sushi Too.  I had always been curious about this place, but because the menu seemed boring and over-priced, I had never tried.  A bit of circumstance changed all that.  The restaurant is decorated in a somewhat cliched sushi joint manner (you know it when you see it), albeit with far less chotchkies than many other places.  You can sit and be comfortable without being distracted by a myriad of junk that makes you wonder \"What the hell is that doing there\"?  Our hostess and server were both very nice, despite the fact that we popped in pretty late in the evening when it seemed the dinner service was winding down.  Sushi Too has its liquor license so you can order a limited selection of beers - including the obligatory Sapporo and Asahi varieties.    For a starter I had seaweed salad and it was as good as anywhere else I've had it.  For dinner I ordered sashimi - sake, hamachi and hirame (salmon, yellowtail, fluke).  They were presented as three nice looking cuts each, with each cut being slightly larger than average.  The quality of the fish was very good - good flavors and textures.    Overall it was a good experience and worth the money.  If a future visit yielded similar results - I would bump my rating to 4 stars.  Consider it a 3.5 for now."}
{"text":"Usually when I order from Sushi Too, I have no problems and the food and service is great. However, I am very disappointed today. The EatStreet ordering website clearly said the Sushi Bar Appetizers come with soup and salad. They didn't give me any soup and salad. When I called to complain, the staff and manager told me this was a mistake on the website and this was EatStreet's problem. Then, they refused to give me any refund or extra food. I paid $20 for sushi I finished in about three bites. I will NOT be eating here again."}
{"text":"I saw the mixed reviews, and thought, let's give it a chance.  It's close, it has delivery, and I might get lucky.  Even after placing the order with the lady who didn't speak a lick of English (and had to call back to repeat our credit card number six times), I thought \"Hey, she can't speak English, it must be authentic!\"  Well, that logic fell short.  The sushi rolls were by far the worst I've had in a while.  I'm not being a snob.  I've been satisfied with sushi from supermarkets -- but this place just doesn't cut it, especially for the prices.  As for the other items: salad dressing, bleh.  Miso soup, alright. Tempura, bland.  On the positive side, I've heard that poor quality sushi means lower mercury content!  So here's to my health."}
{"text":"Noodle stir fry - Chinese style :(  Noodle soup - Chinese style :(  And, I can make it better without even trying..  Eel roll..  So/so, nothing special"}
{"text":"Sushi Too hosts reliably good sushi in shadyside for its makizushi.  I know it's white trash, but get a shadyside roll.  Cream cheese and salmon inside.  It's not exactly tokyo, but with tons of wasabi it's kinda good."}
{"text":"I order from here quite a bit, and have eaten in about twice. I enjoy their food -- it's not top-notch gourmet sushi by any means, but it's decent and at a good price. The rolls have a good amount of fish, and not a ridiculous amount of rice like some sushi restaurants seem to do to make the rolls seem bigger. The veggie tempura is delicious, best I've had. I have had issues several times when ordering delivery, but they have always rectified the situation for me, so I won't hold a grudge!"}
{"text":"I would say it's the best Japanese restaurant in Pittsburgh. I've been here multiple times after my shopping spree. The service has always been friendly,and the food has been enjoyable. I especially recommend the curry shrimp, fried tempura, and sushi."}
{"text":"Sushi Too is a good place to grab a quick lunch.  On first impression - not much to the decor or atmosphere, but since I was just in to grab lunch that didn't bother me.  The service was great - I ordered quickly and my server was always asking me if I needed anything else - but not in an annoying way as she saw I was reading during my lunch.   I got the American Dream roll (good but a little large and difficult to eat.  I was eating by myself and while I don't mind I always feel like people are looking someone eating alone thinking - that poor girl she doesn't have any friends).  I also got a spicy California roll which was good as well.   Overall - its a pretty relaxed joint, nothing particularly special about it, and the price point was good.  I will go there again for a quick lunch - not sure about what the dinner scene is like."}
{"text":"Food was ok but not spectacular.  Service was poor with our waitress (the other younger one seemed much nicer).  She had a poor attitude and got our order wrong.  We had the lo Mein noodle soup with chicken katsu.  And the Taiwanese pork dish.  Had asked for pork katsu with udon but we were hungry so stuck with it."}
{"text":"We go there every other month and enjoy ourselves, but our recent delivery experience was so horrible that I may never return.  We ordered in for a house party.  The food did not come for two hours, after numerous phone calls to see what was happening.  Every time they assured us that the delivery boy had \"just left,\" a dubious assertion to give twice thirty minutes apart.  The food came soggy and warm.  No offers of discount or any other recourse were given, except to reduce the tip to the poor guy working for them."}
{"text":"Great lunch.  3rd time in the last 2-months and same great experience each time.   Great value as well - as the lunch for two was quite reasonable."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Received the wrong food, and the waitress was surprised that we wanted her to take it back, and bring the food that we ordered. No apology either."}
{"text":"Went there on my break from Steel Cactus. Got in and out really fast! Really good sushi! Waitress was super nice and she handled all her tables well even though the restaurant was busy. Definitely be back there for more."}
{"text":"I'm sitting in this restaurant right now... My sushi still hasn't come... Here's an optimistic 3 star rating assuming the food is good."}
{"text":"Terrible experience both times I have been there. I ordered take out one rainy night, she told me 20 minutes and when I showed up, they acted like I had never called but my order slip was on the counter. I waited while they made my order.   I decided to give them another shot last Friday and went with a bunch of my girlfriends. We got there and were seated promptly. We rbought a bottle of wine which had a corking fee of $15. I was surprised, but since they had a full bar I understood. It took 20 minutes to get us wine glasses and then another 20 before our server took our order. Our server apologized for the delay because they were hosting a large group upstairs. I let it slide then. We got ordered and waited 45 minutes for our food and our orders were wrong. It took us approximately 10 minutes to eat since we were so hungry. We then waited another 35 minutes for our check.   Overall, the menu is great. I enjoyed my food, but it was not good enough to tolerate that service again. You'll see me at Little Tokyo next time."}
{"text":"Visiting Sushi Too was truly refreshing. As a recent transplant to Pittsburgh, I've had issues finding decent sushi that isn't over priced. Sushi Too delivered in an unexpected and pleasant way. I give Sushi Too 4/5 stars for the following reasons:  Atmosphere: 5/5 Sushi Too offers the feeling of a cozy yet high-end sushi restaurant. Features such as custom high quality napkins, high quality chop sticks and a relaxed atmosphere, help make you feel very comfortable here. Though this place may be a bit small, the feeling is just right!  Service: 4/5 The service here is quite nice. Everyone seems happy and was constantly smiling. The only complaint I have was the waiting time for our meal, due to one sushi chef serving the entire dining area. I feel this is more of a timing issue though, as we visited between the lunch and dinner rush.  Food: 4/5 Biting in to my sushi rolls truly was the best part of my visit here. The food was prepared excellently, with large portions for their sides. I've had many tempura rolls but the Asparagus veggie tempura roll was extremely delicious (and cheap!). The only reason I did not give Sushi Too a 5/5 in this category was due to their limited selections. I am a traditionalist when it comes to sushi and felt that there were a lot of classic rolls that simply weren't there. Don't let this discourage you though, their selection still provides some great options for vegetarians and carnivores alike. I recommend checking out their special rolls of the day.  Price: 5/5 I was pleased to get out of a sushi restaurant for under $25, for two people. The price was right here, without any price gouging that I've seen in other places around the 'Burgh. In short, Sushi Too will not be breaking the bank.  Overall: 4/5 Sushi Too is an establishment that successfully blends delicious food, atmosphere, and service. I was very happy with my visit and will definitely return to further explore their menu."}
{"text":"As I passed this place I contemplated going in but upon looking up the reviews had cold feet as they weren't overly flattering. Nonetheless I convinced myself to give it a shot. I was greeted by the hostess and taken to the back, but I then requested sitting by the window and she obliged. I ordered the spicy california rolls with jalepeno flavor and, I think, sweet eel sauce (the online menu didn't have what I ordered). In any case, I found the sushi to be extremely tasty and close to the best I've had. I then ordered the moshi ice cream, which appeared to be dumpling stuffed with ice cream. It was very unusual if not over the top good but I did enjoy it. The bill was a mere $10. I feel for the quality food I had and for how it was just enough to fill me up and leave me satisfied, all at a very reasonable price, the experience merits a solid 5 star rating."}
{"text":"It's been a while since last time I came here, but the service is getting worse and food quality is not stable. We ordered a shrimp Tempura combo, Crazy Dragon sushi rolls, Pork Shogayaki, and Seafood yaki Udon noodle. Both dragon sushi rolls and shrimp tempura are tasty, but it takes a long time to get us a bowl of rice that should have come together with shrimp tempura.  For the Pork Shogayaki, the worst ever! pork Shogayaki is a very common Japanese dish, and suppose to be made with thin-cut sliced pork, but Sushi Too has sliced but very thick pork Shogayaki; it's dry and tasted like chewy gums! It's nothing like Japanese style at all.  And the seafood yaki udon noodle, took forever to make, and when the waiter delivered the food, we found that it's been cool down...maybe they forgot we ordered that?  Overall, not recommended, but if you only like sushi rolls, Sushi Too still is a good place."}
{"text":"This is the first time I've eaten here and I've heard mixed reviews. We ordered a sushi boat so we figured we'd get a nice assortment of different rolls and sashimi. The presentation was ok but the sushi was sub par. The tuna roll ( a very basic roll that is standard everywhere and thus should be pretty hard to get wrong) was no good. The fish had a strange taste to it. A few of the other pieces were not very good. Overall it just wasn't very good. The whole thing was $50 which isn't terrible for two people but really was not worth it. To top it all off the waitress was pretty rude and the staff was not welcoming at all. I will not be back."}
{"text":"Huge fans. The menu has great variety, the food is out super fast, and though the menu is small, the cocktails are delicious. The service wasn't amazing, but every time we go I resolve to go back once a week. I'm no sushi expert, but Sushi Too is my Pittsburgh favorite for sushi."}
{"text":"The place is small but clean. service is fast and decent but the food itself is not very impressive. The rice seemed to be old and dry, each piece was cut/made a little too big. Their nigiri were ok, but the eel nigiri and rolls were mediocre. given the price of about $50 for 2, it was not a bad deal for dinner though."}
{"text":"Pros: - They deliver through Campusfood. - Their vegetarian sushi is well-made, tastes good, and is pretty cheap.  $3 for avocado or kappa rolls, $4 for avocado + kappa or shiitake mushroom rolls. - Vegetables tempura were pretty decent, once you overlook the inherent sogginess that comes along with delivered fried foods.  Cons: - The spicy chicken was not particularly spicy, and was actually pretty bland. - Egg rolls are not very good.  I would skip them the next time I order. - They offer asparagus rolls at their location at CMU, but not on the online menu, which specifically asks you not to make substitutions.  The campus sushi place is closed until fall semester, which means I have to go without asparagus rolls all summer.  The entrees don't seem too great, and I can't speak to the fish, but if you're a vegetarian and like sushi, then I can definitely recommend Sushi Too."}
{"text":"The \"Sushi Too\" refers to Pan-Asian menu which includes Chinese, Japanese, and Korean food. So far I have only tried the sushi rolls. While their sushi quality is mediocre, their cooked rolls (broiled fish, tempura, etc.) are some of the best I've had anywhere. Very savory and saucy. This past time was strange as their specials menu consisted of a laminated page of photographs, with no description. I tossed it aside as it wasn't helpful at all, yet when the waitress came by she prominently mentioned it and talked about a few of them. I couldn't remember her earlier description, so I asked to confirm what was in one of the rolls, but she had trouble remembering (luckily the part I remembered was what she forgot and vice versa). I ordered that and another roll, but she forgot the second one. The first turned out to be very good but pricier than I expected. It was also quite filling so it worked out alright that the second one was forgotten."}
{"text":"Overpriced and really bad - and I am not a particularly discriminating sushi eater. Parts were too bland and parts were way oversalted. I can't remember the last time I was this disappointed with my food. We had actually been here about a year ago and I decided to give this place another chance - totally disappointed. Just hope I don't get food poisoning to top it all off."}
{"text":"Great establishment, friendly staff & top notch sushi. The best sushi you'll find in Shadyside."}
{"text":"I have to agree with matthew w. on this one. get the saki for a psuedo japanese experience, and load on the wasabi. Incredibly convenient and healthier than almost any other restaurant on walnut street, but nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"I haven't been to sushi too in about a year after finding a mealworm in my noodle soup."}
{"text":"Always a good choice for sushi. The bento meal is what I usually go for. Service is consistent and always good. The tempura rolls are good but the sashimi could be better."}
{"text":"The first time I came to Sushi Too, I ordered some rolls. They were terrible.  Months later, I decided to give it another try by ordering some real sushi -- the chirashizushi (also known as the chirashi don), which is only available on the physical menu in the restaurant and not on the online menus. I was pleasantly surprised at the quality. It was actually pretty good. It consisted of a good variety of fish, including (if I remember correctly) lean tuna, fatty tuna, farmed Atlantic salmon, octopus, snapper. While these pieces of sashimi are not particularly outstanding, they are not too bad for a budget sushi restaurant (unlike the unfresh stuff found in certain other Pittsburgh sushi restaurants). The egg and the crab sticks were welcome additions too.  I'd give it four stars for the quality of the chirashi, but then numerous fruit flies and sticky stains on the tables warrant the subtraction of another star."}
{"text":"After foraging for some food in the Pittsburgh area (and after 6-7 hours of moving stuff into my new apartment, unpacking, settling in, etc.), the Kwon clan was cranky, tired and FAMISHED. That sort of a combination, especially within the Kwon family, renders a potential shitstorm.  The scenario: S. Aiken St. was blocked off, parking was nearly impossible at 9PM on a Saturday night, there was some sort of a street festival happening RIGHT outside of Sushi Too... AND it was raining...   Needless to say, the 'rents and I were extremely relieved when we stepped foot into the restaurant. Not only was it low-key (and seemingly oblivious to the happenings right outside), it was not overly crowded or busy.   As for the food itself, it was okay. Service was great (trust me, tending to a cranky and needy Kwon clan is no fun) and the food came out fairly quickly. We ordered a bunch of stuff, including 5-6 rolls, an appetizer, entree and a side dish.  INSIDER TIP: Skip the yaki udon (overpriced and tasted more like mediocre Chinese food) and forgo the crabcakes... Just stick with the the simple tuna or salmon rolls."}
{"text":"Sushi too is one of my regular favorites, I have been coming here since I was a child. I usually go to the area for a light lunch and shopping, and luckily sushi too is great for a light lunch. They have a decent lunch menu, which offers a variety of bento box options. My favorite is the teriyaki chicken with the tempura. I also love their sushi.   They could improve on their service, you usually have to ask for a refill, and sometimes your kitchen order does come out incorrectly"}
{"text":"????????????????????????? ?????????????????????????????????????????????salad??????.........?????????????????"}
{"text":"It took a while for us to get served but all and all calming and great food. Great for a girl's day"}
{"text":"My partner and I go here during the week regularly for than fantastic Lunch Specials. Great food, great price , quick and precise. LOVE IT !!!"}
{"text":"Salads are filling and cheap, and the sushi is alright. Service is also generally good.   Nothing at Sushi Too is outstanding or special for me, but nothing is really awful either. I occasionally like eating there, but it's not my go-to sushi restaurant in all of Pittsburgh.   Overall, if you're craving sushi and in Shadyside, this should be a contender in the list of options."}
{"text":"Lived in Japan for three years, which may be skewing my expectations, but the sushi was fishy and had an odd color. Had to send it back, unfortunately."}
{"text":"I've eaten here more than once... miso is good. Service is friendly and ambiance is okay. Convenient location, sushi is not generous or very fresh but it usually hasn't been too bad. However, my boyfriend and I got food poisoning from some bad tuna. I understand the risks of consuming raw fish, but this tuna just looked bad. I didn't really want to risk ruining dinner by complaining about the light-pink color of the tuna (should be deep, pleasing red) but an hour or so later when we were both puking I wish I would have mentioned it :( I called the next morning just to let them know that for the sake of business they should throw out their tuna, I wasn't asking for a refund or anything--I used to work at a sushi restaurant so I understand that it happens in small establishments sometimes, and I felt bad that others who may not be so kind might get sick and raise a racket. Unfortunately the management seemed to interpret my courtesy call as an attack and assured me that next time I came in I would get money off etc etc and didn't seem concerned about what i had to say about the food that made us sick. I probably won't be coming again."}
{"text":"Horrible experience with this place. My friend and I ordered take out (via GrubHub). First of all,t hey took TWO HOURS to bring us our food. Every time we called to check the status they said \"it's on the way\" and we're extremely rude, vague, and unhelpful (this place is 1.2 miles from where we ordered).   All of that aside, when the food arrived, it was terrible. It smelled like rotten trash and other people with us kept asking what the horrible smell is. I'm not sure if it was because it was made 2 hours ago or what but it was gross. We gave it a try regardless and we're not satisfied and ended up throwing it away (even the 6 other people we were with didn't want it).  Haven't been here and I don't know if this was an off night but I won't be trying it again."}
{"text":"I love sushi donut so much. My friend and I had three together, and finish just in minutes! Looks beautiful and tastes yummy!"}
{"text":"This is really a two star review if I talk strictly about the food and the restaurant. The sushi wasn't the best quality, but it was reliable in its mediocrity and was a great comfort food during the harrowing times of grad school.  The extra star is added because they deliver. Honestly, I thought about adding two stars for this. I'm surprised there aren't more sushi restaurants out there that deliver, because it's the fastest way to part me with my hard-earned money."}
{"text":"I dream of the days when I had a sushi joint across from my work. That being said I miss you, sushi too! I've had a few of the rolls: surf n turf, rainbow, spicy Cali... Etc BUT that rainbow roll is something else. They give an adequate amount of fish on top the roll which makes me a happy girl. The variety is perfect and the fish is seemingly very fresh. Ugh, now I need sushi. Preferably your rainbow roll..."}
{"text":"I love this place! This is a common spot for me and my bestie. Prices are reasonable, food is delicious, service is outstanding... What's not to like?"}
{"text":"I have always liked Sushi Too. I have been going there for YEARS! The fish is fresh. The chef's (King and Tony) are very nice, helpful and fantastic at their craft. I love their sushi. I honestly haven't tried much of their cooked foods; can't get passed the sushi. We've tried almost everything on their menu. They have sushi donuts (a round donut-looking roll with several fish varieties on top), sushi cupcakes (a cupcake looking cup of rice with fish and spicy mayo), rolls (creative and regular), sushi and sashimi.  We recently got take out from them. It came when they said. It was fresh and, even in the take out boxes, was well presented. We did make a special request that we didn't get; but, it was minor and we certainly enjoyed the meal without it."}
{"text":"Not the best sushi restaurant, but good for Shadyside.  In general, the sushi was about average.  Never tasted very fresh and flavorful, but not terrible either.  My recommendation is to go for lunch, rather than dinner.  The lunch menu is much more economical and is a better value.  On the other hand, I would usually end up getting sushi from Whole Foods."}
{"text":"I had forgotten what bad sushi tastes like. Now I remember.  I am not a sushi expert but I enjoy sushi, and have been to countless sushi restaurants. I've been to phenomenal 5 star places in Miami and California, and also great hole in the wall places. I'm easy to please I think. Heck, I enjoy Giant Eagle Sushi.   I wish I would have gone to Giant Eagle.  I came for a quick lunch, sat at the sushi bar and ordered the sashimi lunch special. Came with salad and soup. Perhaps I should have ordered a roll?  The sushi bar area had an unpleasant order. But I held my nose and stayed. The soup and salad were completely mediocre, but not bad. Well the soup was OK. Salad was limp with excessive dressing.   The sashimi was just not good. The tuna was tough. And several of the other pieces just had a mushy texture and no good flavor. I partially blame myself for even getting so sashimi. A sushi roll would've been a much safer bet. The quality of the fish is less apparent in that setting.  The service, was pleasant and quick. I got in and out very quickly. The price was also very reasonable for a sushi lunch. I spent only $10. So if you do decide to come to this place, try a lunch special for the price, and do not get sashimi. Try a funky roll. Maybe that will be good."}
{"text":"I would give between 4 and 4,5 stars considering their cheap price and service. I love their Salmon. It's the most fresh Salmon in the city. I also like their Ginger Dressing, Fried Ice Cream and Tempura, but if you're looking for a fancy restaurant or something exotic, that's not the right place."}
{"text":"I live really close to here so this is my takeout and delivery go to for sushi. It's not the most fresh sushi or the best deal, but when you're too lazy to eat out or drive to Ginza, it perfectly satisfies your craving. They have a pretty large menu but I generally stick to the sushi entrees, so I can't speak to any of their hot foods. I usually stay with the basics-- tuna and hamachi rolls, shashimi and nigiri. I don't really like the spicy tuna because it's mashed up fish rather than sliced tuna, and I generally avoid the more creative rolls because the sauces are too much. The sushi combos such as the royal platter ($24) are the best deal because it comes with soup, salad, rice and multiple rolls or shashimi/nigiri. It's enough for me to spit into two meals."}
{"text":"sushi was awesome but amount is little. Clean and tidy but not the restroom. Services r nice"}
{"text":"Nothing about the food at Sushi Too was special. Not typical Japanese food. More wannabe Japanese Chinese style. If you are looking for something authentic or good, go somewhere else. DO NOT RESERVE A ROOM FOR A PARTY UPSTAIRS. We did that and our waitress told us if we needed service go down stairs and track them down if we needed them. So don't expect any service for the high prices you pay. The lowered tables and legless chairs upstairs, looked kinda cool and fun initially, but not comfortable at all. DO NOT BYOB. $15 corking charge which they tell you about when you get the bill. Also DO NOT GO THERE WITH A LARGE PARTY. 20% automatic mandatory tip for large parties which you also find out about when you get your bill. Hefty tip to pay for very little service along with subpar food. Nice Location on Walnut, but AVOID if you don't like overpaying for poor service and food. They more interested in emptying your wallet than serving you good food."}
{"text":"This place is home to one of my favorite Pittsburgh delicacies: the Sushi Spring roll (called \"SSR\" from here on). There's nothing remarkable about the restaurant otherwise. My 4 star review rides solely on the back of this magical little treat. It's basically a fried piece of heaven, like forserious. They're so good, they were probably made by Jesus himself.   On the outside, it looks like any other spring roll, but once you bite in, a journey begins: you go through four flavor stages by eating the SSR. FIRST, a crispy little exterior mixed with the delicious sweet sauce they come with. Second, a mix of perfectly cooked rice and veggies. Next, the sushi comes to play. Finally, like Captain Planet, the ingredients all combine to form a super-tasty-happy-time-Asian flavorgasm. Enjoy."}
{"text":"Got the tempura appetizer, soft shell crab roll, fantasy roll, and an avocado roll. Totally over-ordered...whoops! But it was all delicious and the service was fast and effective :). Glad to have found a good sushi stop while visiting from out of town! The only bummer is that parking can be tricky since it's in a popular area with only street parking."}
{"text":"Phenomenal. Really firm and chewy tofu, immensely savory and delicious miso soup, tasty scallion pancakes. Sushi rolls were the best we've ever had. Wonderful value for money, thoroughly enjoyable."}
{"text":"Their lunch menu is served at a decent price for the quantity, so if you are to visit take the advantage of lunch hours. Many times I visited, their sushi or sashimi are pretty dry- ruining the texture of the fish. :(  but they have the yellow egg sushi (tamago), so if you are a tamago lover, you have a place to go!"}
{"text":"Amazing sushi! Friendly staff. Prices are reasonable and not over priced. Surf and Turf roll is a must have!"}
{"text":"My date ordered sushi and I ordered a vegetable noodle soup. I didn't get my soup until 20 minutes after his sushi and I didn't eat it because there was a egg in it. When the waitress came and asked if I needed a box I said no. She asked if I was happy with the soup and I said no and explained about the egg. She didn't care. Maybe if my main dish would have arrived at the same time as my date's I would have had time to ask for something else but  he was already finished. So I paid for a soup I didn't eat...very disappointing. Also the bathroom was gross."}
{"text":"Sushi Too was not on the Walnut Street restaurant rotation list. It was the first time I tasted Tempura. I have not taken, take out, only ate in once. I am sorry I never got to try the Sushi Cupcake that everyone is talking about.  I had the Tempura lunch and a California Roll. The service was quick and friendly. I am sad to say that the green tea, I love so much, was warm at best and not Hot :(  The lunch was good and tasty, but I didn't return. I would recommend it for those that have never tried it. I can't say it was a bad experience, just nothing that ever made me want to return."}
{"text":"I ordered sushi too for delivery. Everything was fine until a half hour later when my boyfriend and I both got really ill. It wasn't pretty. Will never order again.  I think I'm done with sushi for awhile now."}
{"text":"Decidedly nothing more than your average American sushi joint. They are inoffensively mediocre at it and you just go along, only because you are really craving cheap sushi."}
{"text":"We ordered Crazy Dragon Roll, Noodle Soup and Pittsburgh Roll. The rolls were very good, especially the Crazy Dragon. The Noodle soup was okay. We don't like the vegetables in the soup. The waitress was not very friendly to us."}
{"text":"Sushi Too is by no means the best sushi restaurant in town but they are pretty good and also--my favorite place for maki rolls.  Whats good about this restaurant is they have options other than sushi in case you're craving maki and your dining companion doesnt want sushi.  The sushi here is solid.  It's not the best, but its good.  Here's the trick:  You can order take out from them (I use grubhub.com) and this is the way to go.  Dining in the maki are somewhat sloppy for some reason, and the service can be brusque due to what I'm assuming are language barriers.  If you get take out, your maki will look perfect for some reason, and the food always arrives quickly and as ordered.  I dont like dining here due to the over powering smell of fish in this restaurant.  If they have their front door open you can smell it across the Walnut Street.  Many sushi restaurants smell slightly of fish--you're eating sushi!  This place has ALWAYS just totally smelled like fish.  Its a good place for a casual lunch or dinner if you dine in, I would not bring a date here.  The restaurant is cute inside.  My favorite menu items are the spicy tofu salad, age tofu, edamame, the Negihamachi roll, Spicy Caifornia Rolls, Shadyside Roll, the Sunshine roll, and any of the tempura rolls.  Their miso soup is also very good.  I recommend this place for take out.  This review is all over the place, but they get 4 stars from me bc I am a long time patron, and I just love their maki rolls so much."}
{"text":"I took a business lunch at Sushi Too.  How adult does that sound?  \"Business lunch.\"  Man, I'm a cool graduate student.  Disclaimer:  I have NO IDEA what this place's hours are.  Yelp shows that they close in between meals, but we lunched straight through from lunch to dinner.  I'm sorry if they do close, but Yelp needs to see if the hours listed are correct.  Service was great and continued to check on us throughout our four hour meeting.  Some of the reviews were lackluster so I played it safe and stuck to Chicken Lo Mein ($15).  It was not memorable, and fairly small for the price.  But there was nothing wrong with the meal, making it an A-Ok.  Would I be opposed to coming back?  No.  I just think there are other more exciting options in the area."}
{"text":"I'm not big on sushi, and this place has plenty of non-sushi options like udon, tonkatsu, and much more. I decided to skip those though, and order some sushi with shrimp tempura which I do enjoy. I ordered their Oh My God #A roll, which is a shrimp tempura roll where you can choose from 3 different options. I went with #A, which said that the roll was wrapped in avocado - I expected it to just be in the roll since sometimes these menus can suffer from some translation error, but I was pleasantly surprised when the roll did in fact come wrapped in avocado. I really enjoyed the roll since it combined rice, avocado, and shrimp tempura, always a winning combo, and all three were done well. The avocado taste can be a bit overpowering if you're not into it, but I certainly am."}
{"text":"Sushi is ok, but location is convenient and staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"Service 4/5 --restaurant was almost full, yet the service was still very prompt and polite Atmosphere 4/5  Main: Unagidon (Eel and rice bowl) 4/5 --a good amount of eel --comes with soup and salad ----fish broth soup 4/5 ----sesame/ginger salad 3/5 ------a bit too salty but veggies are good and crisp  Sushi: Masago gunkanmaki (Caplin fish roe) 5/5 Sake nigiri (Salmon) 5/5 --the salmon was very good. Good texture, good temperature; shiny and firm.   I'll come back again for more sushi."}
{"text":"I went for dinner last week and shared a dinner special with my brother. It came with the miso (good), a salad (shredded lettuce = boring and it had too much quantity of a nice ginger dressing), and a nice variety of rolls. As everyone seems to report, it was not the best sushi.. Didn't seem overly fresh, but it was tasty \"enough\" and moderately priced. Better than the grocery store."}
{"text":"This place is my most favorite sushi place in Pittsburgh. Sure, it's small but I've visited 30 different sushi restaurants in and around Pittsburgh and this is by far my favorite. The New Fusion tri-colored roll is a must try! Everything is always fresh, but the only problem is the parking on walnut street. This place is the best!!"}
{"text":"For a small restaurant, they have great service and delicious food!  FOOD:  For lunch I got their lunch Bento Tempura and Sushi, which is shrimp and vegetable tempura, 3 pcs. of assorted sushi, and CA roll with a side of rice.  I started with a salad with ginger dressing and their fish broth soup.  So yummy!  Everything was fresh and tasty, except for their tuna nigiri sushi which tasted old.  I was surprised by that.  I didn't complain since I ate it.  All this for $14.  It was a lot of food so I had to take some of it home."}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times. It's not too bad. But it's not mind blowing good. It's about average. But it's walking distance from the CMU campus so whenever we had a sushi craving, we'd sometimes come here to satisfy it. The prices are a little high for the quality of the food but it's still ok. Never liked how the soft shell crab is priced at market price. Also, the eel roll anywhere else is cheaper. However, when I do come here, I usually get the eel roll, sometimes the soft shell crab roll and some sort of spicy fish roll. Whether it's tuna, salmon, yellow tail, etc."}
{"text":"I've never had a bad experience at Sushi Too. No matter what I ordered I ended up loving it. Their ginger dressing for the salad is delicious. If you're in the mood for yummy and affordable sushi, this is the way to go!"}
{"text":"This sushi place was definitely up to par with the reviews it got. There was a large and unique variety of sushi rolls to choose from, which I enjoyed very much. I always like to try new and unique twists on some of my favorite foods. Although I did not order anything other than sushi, I appreciated the noodle and other food items the menu had. Overall, I would definitely recommend this place to anyone that wanted reasonably priced, good quality sushi."}
{"text":"After 20+ years of going here, I will NEVER go or get take out again! The newest manager is, sorry!, a total ass. No clue how to deliver service, food and service wise. Shame on me for another try. This time, order arrives with no chopsticks or soy sauce or any other Necessary accompaniments. The manager Len, argumentative and arrogant. Offers me $3. NEVER again! Do not patronize! Terrible!"}
{"text":"Like most places on Walnut, the food here isn't a good value. At least the spicy tuna rolls aren't, at 7 bucks for 6 teeny pieces. In order to get full I have to order about 14-20 bucks worth of food. (Granted, this doesn't take into account the vegetarian rolls, which may be a better deal.) Not cool, especially when I compare to Oishii in Oakland."}
{"text":"We went here and ordered the royal boat. For the price, it's definitely a lot of food. But...the quality of the fish wasn't very good. If you're looking for a really casual place you could go here but if you want great sushi I'd go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Good cheap sushi! My go to for sushi cravings. Always start with salad and ginger dressing and miso soup. Both are delicious and at this point I don't think I could eat here without ordering them. I usually go for assortment of rolls. The dragon roll with eel and avocado, the tricolor roll with fish laying on top, and the good old spicy tuna roll. Also like the roll with either salmon or tuna and asparagus but cannot remember then name. The sushi boats for 2 are fun but even getting an assortment of things to share they will dress that up on a platter as well. Full bar and Japanese beer."}
{"text":"Strongly recommend ordering from somewhere else. Pink Lady roll is inedible; grey, rotten salmon. Sad!"}
{"text":"A hidden gem! Being vegan, it's pretty hard to find food to eat. Sushi too delivered with the vegetable rolls! Delicious and pretty filling! The service was a bit slow considering there was only one other table in the dining room eating, but I wasn't too bothered by it. Our water glasses were being constantly filled up! One downer was the appetizer came with our meal, but then again, also didn't bother me too much! It was a nice meal and I would recommend it to friends"}
{"text":"I orderee takeout, the Miso Soup and spicy tuna roll. When I walked in I was charmed by its dated interior nestled into the high end shops on Shadyside's Walnut Street. It's a hole in the wall vibe that draws you in.   This was the first time I've had Miso soup so I'm not in much of a position to rate it, but I think it's a typical recipe, Wakame, tofu, scallions, and topped w mushrooms. My taste buds felt like it should've been saltier. The spicy tuna roll was on par with most maki rolls, the caviar mixed with the spicy tuna was a nice surprise."}
{"text":"Can a sushi place be more bad? I highly doubted. The owner and waiters are rude and the food is a joke"}
{"text":"Great Sushi and Sashimi served or delivered fresh to your door. A clean and friendly environment for in-house dining, and thoughtful presentation and packing for delivery. Priced well with generous portions. Only complaint is similar to other sushi restaurants- please do not use the pseudo-crab in dishes. This restaurant has been a longtime staple when staying in the area."}
{"text":"A-OK sushi place in Shadyside.  I recently had the soft shell crab (spider) roll.  It says market price on the menu, which made me raise my eyebrows a bit, but it turned out to be only $14.  Not bad price wise, and super tasty.  I would pass on the green tea here, not very good."}
{"text":"Always my favorite sushi place. Great location here on Walnut street. All maki rolls are incredible and surprisingly cheap too!"}
{"text":"If you're dying for good sushi, this is not the place. On the bright side, if it a nice day and your okay with average sushi, the plop your butt down at one of their outdoor patio tables overlooking Walnut Street. I ordered the fantasy, fresh salmon and spicy tuna rolls ($4.50-6.50 ea.). The prsentation was fine, but the sushi wasn't as fresh as it probably should be. Also, I found the ginger, something I always gobble up, to be disappointing. At least the water is good. For top notch sushi without the Shadyside fuss, hop over to Andy's at Wholeys Market in the Strip District."}
{"text":"Seriously, this place is not terrible, and is great for a quick lunch or if you are needing to kill some time. Rolls are kinda small, but I really liked the mushroom roll. Service is friendly and quick- so quick that the waitress admittedly wrote my order down wrong and brought the wrong rolls. She was nice about it so I didn't mind much.  Again, it's not amazing but not terrible. I'd come again at lunchtime."}
{"text":"No complaints about the taste of the food.  It's hard to make a bad roll as long as you have fresh ingredients.  They also have free delivery within a 3 mile radius.  However, everything is overpriced in my opinion.  Everytime I get something from Sushi Too, I always forget how small the portions are!  The Tri-Color Roll, the last roll I got, is $9.  Sounds cheap but they give you half the amount you usually get from another sushi joint.  Case of the overpriced Shadyside restaurant?  I think so."}
{"text":"I've been here a bunch of times and this place is okay.  There aren't a lot of places to eat on Walnut Street (there's a creperie across the street, a Thai place further down, a breakfast place, etc) and it's not a bad deal.  I've had their katsudon and tri-colored roll.  The first comes with soup and salad - get miso soup and ginger dressing!  The roll was yummy (so juicy!) but maybe a little pricey... it comes with six pieces, two w salmon, two w tuna, and two w avocados on top, for $9."}
{"text":"Came here on a Wednesday evening for some sushi with the girls!  I had just exercised and was looking forward to a nice, light meal.  The place was a little busy - not full, but several tables occupied - but we were seated immediately.  Atmosphere and service both were functional but not personal, nothing special there - except the hammerhead shark that hangs above the sushi bar.  I got the Rainbow Roll and an Eel Roll, with soup and salad first.  Miso is $2, so is house salad.  I prefer it when that comes complementary, but I decided to pay for it since it just feels wrong for me to have sushi without.  Miso was good, hot and filled with tofu.  The house salad was about two or three times larger than it usually is, and the dressing was a little heavier than I like it.  I was a little bummed since I started feeling full of salad before my sushi even arrived!    The rainbow roll was small.  Usually I have rainbow rolls with about 8-10 pieces (I think?) but this one only had 6.  It was also about the same size as the eel roll (standard 6 pieces).  I don't think the rainbow roll was a good deal for the price.  All the sushi was okay, it didn't taste uber-fresh but it wasn't bad either.  Not as flavorful as I'd hoped.  It was well-made, but the presentation completely lacked any flair.  It's a pretty inexpensive place to grab a few rolls, which is nice.  I paid $20 for soup (2), salad (2), one specialty roll (10?!?!), and one regular roll (6).  Rainbow roll was NOT worth $10, so I'd say stick with the simple rolls that make more sense with the price.  It satisfied a craving, but I've had way better sushi elsewhere."}
{"text":"I definitely think this is the best sushi in Pittsburgh!  I love the \"Oh My God A\" and the \"Oh My God T.\"  Very good.  They sushi is very fresh."}
{"text":"This sushi place is to die for!  My parents were in town for thanksgiving; and it was Black Friday. I was craving sushi, but my normal sushi go to place was closed unfortunately. So I scoured the internet for another option that would satisfy all of us; and came up with this.  At first glance, it was a whole in the wall dive that looked questionable both from the outside and the inside. Yet, remember that saying to not judge a book by its cover? That applies here. Don't judge the restaurant by its cover; judge it by its food.  We ordered way to much food; but all of it was delicious. As a family who grew up going to dim sum restaurants and Chinatown in DC and Rockville MD growing up, this brought up back to our time spent together when I was a child. That being said, when our table was covered in food plates, it would have been nice to have a heads up when we ordered that we had ordered a LOT.  My only other criticism would be that for my bento nigiri box, when i asked for just salmon and tuna vs a mixture of fish, they uncharged me $2. I feel that with the multiple items we ordered, and the amount of money we spent, that should be waived."}
{"text":"Sushi Too is an excellent sushi place, but it is also affordable. The service is quick because for some reason no one is ever eating in there! Why?? I can't understand it! The food is great; the prices are good; the service is fast; plus, it is on Walnut street. I cannot believe this place isn't packed at all hours.   On one particular visit I ordered the shrimp sushi and one of the variations of their Oh My God roll. Everything was fresh (very important when it comes to sushi, duh) and the textures working together in the Oh My God roll were complementary  -- crispy shrimp tempura, perfectly cooked rice, creamy top. Very very good overall.  Their lunch specials are also legit, so I recommend visiting for lunch. You get a lot of food for a very small amount of money."}
{"text":"i feel it is my duty, nay, my purpose in \"yelp\" to write this review. my husband and i got VIOLENTLY ill on 3/20/10 after eating at sushi too. i did NOT EAT anything raw. I had the veggie tempura, chicken satay and california rolls. we were both ill for 3 days - and we have a very young child so this was really, really terrible. i would also like to add that sushi too is owned by the same people who own china palace (3 doors down) and my brother found a cockroach in his soup there a few years back. i've reported sushi too to the health department. go to chaya or someplace better for sushi...hell, even orient kitchen on baum blvd. never got me sick. so, this is my warning to all of you who read yelp. never, ever eat here."}
{"text":"It is good for its price. The staff are very kind and welcoming, and I like all of their menu."}
{"text":"Man. I guess I should've taken this place's 3 stars more seriously.   When I pay for a specialty type roll, well in my entire life any sushi rolls, even the simple maki, have ALWAYS had either 6 or 8 pieces per roll. The one I ordered tonight was just FOUR little pieces! Like they took a roll and cut it in half and just serve the half roll.. sooo strange, I've never seen this before.   Also my roll was supposed to have smoked salmon in it. Which was the whole reason why I ordered that roll. Instead of smoked salmon it contained like some kind of baked salmon...   The roll my husband ordered was fine, and the rest of my roll after I picked out the salmon was okay I guess.. not very visually appealing, usually the eel is covered in sauce, this one isn't really at all and doesn't seem very high quality. Also the shrimp tempura in the other roll was greasier than any other shrimp tempura roll I've ever had.  I guess I'm lucky that when I ordered I added a note saying \"please nothing spicy and no mayo\" just in case, cause thankfully mine didn't get mayo but my husband's roll automatically came with that mayo sauce even though there was no mention of it on the menu. I hate when they don't mention things like that on the menu.   Sushi isn't cheap you know, for what I paid I'm soo disappointed by what I got. Oh and one thing of chopsticks. Never seen a place be so stingy, usually any place will give you like three things of chopsticks minimum.... not Sushi Too, nope. Neverrr going back, could neverrr recommend to anyone. I finally learned my lesson and will never pay with cash again, only card from now on so I can get a friggin refund next time this happens."}
{"text":"Sushi and a beer at Sushi Too in Shadyside. Really nice little restaurant in a great location. Very friendly place with great food. I'm sure I will be back at this spot soon. They seem to do the sushi bar but also have Thai and other favorites so they have a larger menu selection than some of the other places in town."}
{"text":"Sushi Donut! Try it. The tempura ones are the ones to get."}
{"text":"After ordering our meal, I used the women's restroom and it was just filthy. Not anything obscene, but dust and dirt around the rim of the toilet, splatters of I-don't-know-what on the walls, and goo build-up around the faucet of the sink. And what really upset me is that they store their highchairs in the women's room, as well!!! Toilets and highchairs just... ugh!!! I understand that restaurant restrooms are not perfect, but if you can't clean the restroom on a daily basis, I certainly question the cleanliness of the kitchen preparation area and food storage area. In addition to the filthy restroom, the server served the table of 6, but forgot all about one of the customer's meals. This was the person who suggested eating here in the first place, and was the one with the headache because they were really hungry - this same person has been here several times before and had an incorrect meal given to him on his last visit - poor luck?!?!? I gave the place the extra star because the food is pretty good. But, sorry... cleanliness wins in this case!"}
{"text":"I have been dining & ordering from Sushi Too for years with family & friends . Full circle-wonderfully consistent & delicious . The one place where I don't have to order the same thing to be happy"}
{"text":"I have heard about Sushi Too and seen it several times on Walnut St, but I never stopped in until a few days ago. My boyfriend and I were really craving sushi, and this seemed like a good spot to go.   The restaurant wasn't crowded at all, which was nice. Unfortunately, I was freezing to death the entire time because I was directly under the AC vents. That made it a little uncomfortable, but I dealt with it.  The staff here was unbelievably kind. The ladies serving us were nice, not pushy and somewhat attentive. I feel like refills could have been given more frequently, but oh well.   I am a vegetarian, so I ordered cold sesame noodles and a vegetable tempura roll with zucchini. My boyfriend ordered a vegetable tempura roll with asparagus, and a sunshine roll.   The sesame noodles were absolutely delicious, but I would have liked less peanut sauce. It was a bit salty, and there was a lot of excess. Something about it made my stomach a little irritated, but it still tasted good enough to finish. I'll have to ask for the peanut sauce on the side next time so that I can adjust it to my preferences. My vegetable roll was really good. I'm a huge zucchini fan, so the slight crispiness of the tempura batter and the softness of the zucchini made me happy. I put spicy mayo on top to add a little kick. I could have easily eaten these all day and night. One roll is surprisingly filling, though! And for only $5.   I can't judge the fish roll my boyfriend ordered, but he said it was average compared to the sushi he has had near beaches.   I'll definitely be back to Sushi Too, but I may not eat inside. The atmosphere is bland, and it's really a small space. I would rather get it to go and eat at the park or something. The price is reasonable, and the service is great."}
{"text":"I don't normally post reviews but tonight I had a great dining experience at Sushi Too. We got right in on a Friday night no reservation required. Our waitress came right over and brought us waters. She was quick to take our food order as well. I started with a large ginger salad which had a dairy-based dressing (I prefer an orange ginger dressing) but it was still good. Vegetable fresh rolls and vegetable stuffed tofu pockets contained fresh crispy vegetables. The dipping sauce for the fresh rolls was delicious. Our waitress also brought over low sodium soy sauce and hot sauce upon request. My friend had the rainbow roll and seaweed salad and she enjoyed both. I can't wait to come back here and try some of the many other vegetarian options that were on the menu."}
{"text":"We got the sushi boat, which came with an assortment of sashimi, sushi, california rolls, and tuna rolls and started off with miso soup and salad with ginger dressing. I'm sure the dressing had a mayonnaise base, which is fine, but I wish the taste of ginger was stronger. Our miso soup was warm, not hot. The sushi rolls were not very good at all. The sushi was alright, and while some of the sashimi was delicious, the rest of it was mediocre. I hate to leave such a harsh critique, because the people working there seemed very nice, but based on the food alone, I will not be going back."}
{"text":"I came here once on a date, when I was new to the area, thinking that since this place is in shadyside it would be fairly trendy.  On the contrary, the atmosphere was awful, I felt like i was in a cheap diner. The plates/glasses/chop sticks all felt cheap. I was surprised they served drinks, but their mixed drinks were awful.  The sushi was actually better than expected for such an awful looking place, and from what i recall it was fairly fresh. They did serve all of our sushi on one plate, and it felt really crowded and sort of took away from the taste of it.  I keep thinking i may go back with a buddy just to get some sushi and give it another shot, but the atmosphere really takes away from the food, so I doubt I will come back."}
{"text":"Tried take-out from here yesterday for dinner. This was a risky move because I had never eaten here before but it was closes location to me. The sushi was delicious and tasted very fresh. I ordered one warm roll which stayed nice until I got home. The inside was very nice and it seemed somewhat busy. Only reason I did not give 5 stars is because of length of time I waited."}
{"text":"As a general rule, I love sushi, so as a sushi lover, Sushi Too is a huge disappointment. The selection was not great, the service was slow and the fish was not good. There was dust all over the ledge of the booth (it is like a ledge for decorations next to the table) and the bathroom was filthy and doubles as storage for high chairs and other miscellaneous items. Cleanliness is an issue here, which is a big deal for restaurants in general, but especially so for a sushi spot.  The food was not gross and spoiled rotten, but was not fresh and had an odd taste, like it was low quality. I honestly considered leaving a few bites of sashimi on my plate, which is very unlike me. The sesame salad dressing was very good and I liked the miso soup. I did not get sick after eating at Sushi Too, but I will not be returning. My boyfriend felt the same way as me and did not finish his meal, stating that it tasted odd."}
{"text":"not really japanese food. the menu of food is actually a big mix of random chinese and japanese food put together. the sushi it self is poor, the fish quality was really bad, i sat at the bar to get a closer look, and after the look i decided to get things that were safe to eat such as inari *tofu pockets. i always order safe and cooked things when i feel the fish might be a killer several hours later.  the cooked food is blah. i've had much better and i'm pretty sure the grocery store frozen section is better. miso was super super salty and grainy which im not a fan of. overall i wont be coming back if i have a choice..."}
{"text":"After a nice workout my friend and I decided to grab some food in Shadyside. I have not been to Sushi Too in a really long time and had an appointment on Walnut at 8:30 so it kinda worked out perfectly. When you walked in you were greeted warmly and led right to a table. It was not packed in the restaurant but it had more people inside than I expected for a Monday at seven. The waitress came over and asked about drinks but I opted just for water, if I just worked out I better try to be a little bit healthy throughout my meal.   While looking at the menu I was particularly interested in the fact that they had lunch boxes. I think that a little bento lunch box at a reasonable price is really the way to go for a quick and easy take-out lunch. I put that in the back of my head as maybe lunch spot for later.   I was interested in the sushi donuts on the menu. But I think it was more for the idea of me ordering a sushi donut not for anything else more than that. I think that it was just sushi in the shape of a donut. The prices weren't bad, around $9-15 dollars per donut, but it just was not what I was looking for and I would have wanted to share it not really get it for myself, it looked a little much.   It was a colder day so I opted for the wonton soup to warm myself before we picked out our meals. I will say that this is where they started to lose me. I am a sucker for wonton soup. I order it at almost every place that has it looking for my favor broth and wonton combo. The broth here was not good at all. It, to me, tasted like salt. I mean that honestly, deer in the woods licking a salt lick, salt. That is the very image that popped into my head as I was trying to enjoy the soup. It was hard to get through and I had to drink a lot of water that night. The wontons were ok. I would say that they had a nice stuffing of chicken and seafood and the meat consistency and flavor was good. But the broth.... I do not think that I could make myself drink that or even go through that again.   My friend then for her before dinner snack ordered the vegetable gyoza. I had one of the little dumplings and they were pretty good. I have never had a strictly vegetable gyoza so this was an experience. It still tasted good as any semi fried/steamed dumpling would and the dipping sauce made it extra delightful. I would order this again, especially if there were any meat issues within the group that I was with.   For my main course I ordered the house special roll \"dragon roll\". It is my go to for all sushi. I love eel and avocado. It was wrapped perfectly and had a nice smokey eel taste to it. A perfect amount of wasbi was put on the plate. I would ask for my ginger for the next time, but overall the presentation and the taste was very good. I would get this again because it tasted fresh and it was a tight roll that didn't give way when dipped in soy sauce. Yum.  I also ordered on the side the two piece of sashimi that was just two pieces of tuna over a rice roll. I got this to go for my partner to eat but then he already ate so I took it to lunch the next morning. YUM! What a nice filling little lunch treat. It stayed fresh and tasted very good. So if you have to keep your sashimi on hold for a bit, just know it will stay good for just a day.  I liked it here. I would like more opportunity to explore the menu, but I can say that it was A-Ok in my book. Try it out, maybe you will like it too."}
{"text":"I was really anxious to try a sushi place in Shady Side, so when I walked passed this place, I decided to try it! The ambiance just wasn't there- the inside was small, cramped and you could hear other people's conversations around you as though they were sitting right next to you. It was distracting how busy and loud it was, especially because our booth was confined to such a small area. It did not seem very clean and almost smelled like floor cleaner. The bathrooms were tiny, cramped and you had to wait in the hall/through way for servers if someone was already in there. So, basically if you like the mood/setting of a restaurant, this isn't going to be your first choice. They did have a large shark figure on the wall, which is fun if you like sharks like me! That was the only part of the restaurant's interior that I liked. The miso soup was absolutely wonderful, as well as the ginger salad. It was one of the best ginger salads I have had in a long time. I ordered a California roll, which seemed to be a bit dry and nothing spectacular, mediocre at best. I also decided to be adventurous and order the Christmas roll I think it was called. There were giant salmon eggs on top of it, which gave it a really fishy taste. The server was very sweet and suggested I get this roll, though, I had no clue what I would be getting myself into by ordering this! If you are adventurous and like to try different rolls, this would be perfect for you. If it did not have the fish eggs, I think this roll would have been perfect for me. My thoughts on the roll is not a reflection of the restaurant as much as just my personal taste. I ordered the chicken satay appetizer, which was pretty good- tempura like battered chicken with a dipping sauce. Was the food decent? Yes. Would I go back? Probably not. The food is worth a try but don't go in there with the same expectations I did, you will be unpleasantly surprised!"}
{"text":"I've always had a pleasant experience at Sushi Too. They have lots of different options on their menu, but I always get the cupcake sushi, which is the reason I'm writing this review. It's pretty awesome. I remember when I first told some friends about it, they were hesitant to try it and maybe a little grossed out, but I assure you, there are no actual cupcake ingredients in the cupcake sushi. It's literally just made up of what you would normally find in sushi (rice, salmon, avocado, and spicy mayo if you want) but in the form of cupcakes. It's called cupcake sushi because it looks like a cupcake. The order comes with two cupcakes. Definitely give it a try.   Taste | 4 Atmosphere | 4 Presentation | 4 Service | 3 OVERALL | 4"}
{"text":"Food is decent, service is awesome. Be sure to ask for Mia as a server. You will make a friend in her as she brings your drinks and food throughout the meal!"}
{"text":"I decided to look up Sushi Too on Yelp to see the reviews. It only has an average 3/5 stars?! A TRAVESTY.  First let me preface this by stating I have been eating at this fine dining establishment, oh, since I was about age 12 or so. I am now 22 years old and I live in St. Louis, MO for college. But I am from the 'Burgh, and let me say, it was at Sushi Too that I consumed my first ever roll of sushi. Yes. And that was the start of a beautiful and long-lasting relationship. Raw fish? Ew. That's what my 12 year old self thought. And  then I put a california roll in my mouth. Chewed. Paused. Swallowed. MAGICAL!  Enough about my snooze-fest of a childhood. On with the review.  As I stated above, I have been going here for years. Not every trip has been 100% perfect, but c'mon now, people. It's a restaurant. It's going to have good nights and bad nights. Slow nights and fast nights. All of that jazz. Maybe I am just lucky and have always had the good fortune of having excellent service?  I just ate here recently...about a week ago during my return to Pgh for Thanksgiving Break. I noticed they are remodeling the front of the place AND the menu has changed quite a bit. Almost  for the worst, I think. It seems as though they are starting to try to appeal more to the \"mainstream\" sushi crowd. As in the  folks who love the flying magical rainbow dragon tiger crawdiddly daddy rolls. Tuna rolls? Out. Yellowtail rolls? Out. Hell, even a Cali Roll is getting too \"boring\" by today's standards even though it is technically a fusion roll. (Called Cali Roll for a reason, it was a roll concocted on the West Coast, not Japan.)  Next thing you know, they'll be phasing out the spider rolls in favor of something that has 15 different ingredients in it and comes deep fried with dipping sauce. (There is actually a restaurant that serves this in STL....look up \"The Drunken Fish\" in my other reviews.)  But I digress....!   Sushi Too is affordable, IMHO, compared to say...Chaya in Squirrel Hill. Not only is it affordable but the fish is very fresh and good for the price. I have always ordered more traditional rolls here, like for instance the tuna rolls, yellow tail rolls, eel nigiri, ikura nigiri (salmon roe), and occasional sea urchin roe which is my all time fave. Not saying fusion is bad, folks. Their Alaska roll (salmon, avocado, and flying fish roe) is insanely good too, but I didn't see that on the menu last I went there but I bet you could still ask for it. Also the \"Oh My God Roll with Eel\" is superb! It has shrimp tempura on the inside, deliciously warm melt-in-your-mouth saltwater eel on the outside. Seriously, it does melt in your mouth.  Another good thing about Sushi Too is the appetizers. Pork gyoza (dumplings). Scallion pancakes. Edamame. Miso soup. There are entrees and appetizers w/o raw fish if you don't like it! Their food that isn't sushi is actually pretty authentic when it comes to Japanese food.  Their lunch specials are DELICIOUS and AFFORDABLE.   Also their hot green tea is the best in town, hands down. It's also better than any sushi restaurants in St. Louis. I swear!  Don't be put off by low ratings on this site, just go out and try it for yourself. If you go back there enough, they will even bring you edamame on the house--my family and I having been eating at Sushi Too for years--so I've been offered free appetizers a few times now. :D Maybe it was dumb luck, a messed up order, or maybe they truly care about bringing customers back, especially repeat customers!  PS: Did you know, they are also owned by the same people who own China Palace a few doors down? So if you like Chinese food better but you still want a sushi fix, go to China Palace and you can order sushi from Sushi Too. It's pretty damn awesome. :)"}
{"text":"This is some of the best sushi we've had in the city so far - and they delivered! We couldn't be more impressed."}
{"text":"I love Sushi Too. I've dined in and had delivery - both of which had exceptional food and service. I believe the prices are more than reasonable, especially for sushi and with his tasty theirs is. When we dined in it was close to closing time, but nobody was impatient with us or rushed us to leave. I'll definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"The diver was so nice and gave us extra food cause we waited for our delivery so long! The wood was great! Very yummy! Get the seafood pockets!"}
{"text":"Ordered sushi from here and after I was done eating my stomach started feel funny and I felt sick. This is not the first time I had sushi but this is the first time experiencing this. They serve poor, rotten, old quality sushi, your better off someplace else."}
{"text":"I came across Sushi Too as I was searching for a dinner place. The set up and service was nothing fantastic but it still worked. A few tables and booths scattered inside the restaurant.   The portions were pretty large. I ordered a seaweed salad and a huge bowl of it came. I rolled out of the restaurant after having 2 special rolls and a bottle from their selection of beers. There were a number of regular and special rolls, deluxe platters, different appetizers, and cooked entrees."}
{"text":"Since my first review, I have done take out a few times at Sushi Too to validate my stance. I have gotten the chirashi bowl and all is good. There is a lot of fish and rice along with a salad and miso soup. Sushi Too does the trick but I do feel that the chirashi is a bit expensive - about 22 bucks. I will continue to go to Sushi Too since it is close to home but still on the look out for my sushi place in the burgh."}
{"text":"Placed order online at 4:58pm.  Arrive 25 mins later to pickup order of one shrimp roll and pork dumplings .  Restaurant is completely empty and order has not even been started.  Rudely told to sit at bar and wait without even the offer of a water.  Wait was 15 mins.  Food was good but a little customer service would go a long way."}
{"text":"Best miso soup in Pittsburgh. Beef teriyaki, chicken lo mein/katsu, and curry with tofu and vegetables are a few delicious highlights. The sushi is good too!"}
{"text":"Best sushi in Pittsburgh!! Staff is so friendly and accommodating. Every roll is amazing. Sushi cupcakes changed my life!!"}
{"text":"The highs are high, and the lows are low.  In descending order: - Eel is awesome. Seriously some of the best eel sushi I've had in a long time. - The soft shell crab roll was good; it filled the I-want-sushi-but-I-also-want-fried-food craving very well. - Wasabi is strong. - Salad was fresh, and the ginger dressing was tasty. - We got one of the platters, and most of it was quite adequate. However, the ebi (prawn) sushi was notable in its toughness. Very disappointing.  - The age tofu was simply not agedashi tofu. It was tofu puffs in a sweet-salty, General Tso's thick sauce. Not authentic by any stretch of the imagination, and furthermore not even tasty. Gross.  In summary, go for the cooked rolls like Joey F. said. Go somewhere else for the other stuff."}
{"text":"Wasn't the best in the universe, but it was definitely good. I only got the sushi as takeout, but the interior seemed clean and was pretty busy when I went to go pick up my food (always comforting). Well-priced, too, which isn't a guarantee on Walnut Street."}
{"text":"Wow. Really? 4 stars? This place = mediocre/decent. Why can't Pittsburgh do chicken teriyaki? As for sushi, I've heard way better things about Little Tokyo in Mt Lebanon and Sushi Tomo in the N Hills."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery (no delivery fee!)  and due to the minimum I ended up ordering the \"Chicken katsu, California roll and harumaki\" lunch special and asked for gyoza instead of the harumaki. It came with miso soup and a side salad. I also ordered an addition eel roll, along with a coke.   All the food tasted good and I think the lunch special portion was pretty generous and filling for the price. If I was eating in the restaurant I probably would've ordered just that, but the eel roll was good and tasty as well. Everything looked nice, clean, and presentable. Including tax and tip, it was all under $20 and it was delivered in about half an hour. The driver was also very friendly and nice. I had no complaints and I would definitely order from here again."}
{"text":"Sushi Too has the best Japanese food in Pittsburgh for my taste.  We usually eat lunch there when we go to the Apple Store in Shadyside, and it is always a treat.  We usually get a Sushi/Tempura combination with Miso soup and ginger dressing on our salad.  Everything is cooked perfectly and is oh so tasty."}
