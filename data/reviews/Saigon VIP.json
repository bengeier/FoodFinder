{"text":"Their pho tastes weird...
Their waitress suggested some kind of soup with curry and coconut milk in it, and my friend got to try it. It was way too oily and salty to finish the whole bowl.
Furthermore, you do not get much choice from their small menu, and although the place is called \"Saigon VIP\", it doesn't even have a theme or style on its own as it is a combination of Vietnamese, Thai, Malaysian and Singaporean cooking.

DO NOT GO."}
{"text":"Saigon VIP is a pretty standard Vietnamese restaurant on St. Catherine O near Guy-Concordia metro. I would mostly stick to the Pho or Bun options, they are both quite good and the portions are generous. I haven't ventured too far outside those two menu items and their variations.

Overall, Saigon VIP is a good bet in this area at a pretty reasonable price."}
{"text":"Come here if you want to eat rice...that is mostly what you'll get. I went last Friday with a friend...I ordered some chicken with rice noodles and a salad and he ordered rice with shrimp...and rice he got, a pound of boiled, unsalted, unseasoned rice with two shrimps and two slices of cucumber and a bit or grated carrots.. me,  I got a huge bowl of tasteless rice noodles, and two small cubes of chicken..... I don't expect lobster if I pay for shrimp or caviar if I pay for chicken, but I do expect to get a decent meal for my money's worth and I did not happen here at the Saigon VIP.....needless to say that this will be my only visit."}
{"text":"We were told this place has good laksa so we went and ordered a couple bowls - one of the laksa Singapore and one of the laksa VIP... and we threw in a couple appetizers - the peanut butter dumplings and the calamari.

I loved the peanut butter dumplings and the very flavourful laksa Singapore. The calamari and the laksa VIP were not as good.

I would recommend this place for its laksa Singapore."}
{"text":"My friend and I decided to eat here after we were having trouble finding somewhere that had any room available. We both had the pho, one vegetarian, one beef. The vegetarian was really delicious with lots of broccoli and carrots and the beef was also really tasty. Another great thing is that it was so cheap! For under $10 I was really full. 
The service was good and SUPER fast! I mean we ordered and not even 5 minutes later we had our food. Being a Concordia student, I will definitely be back here very soon!"}
