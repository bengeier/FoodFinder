{"text":"Unbelievably good!! I was at the Gilbert Farmers Market this morning and Molly had a booth. There were so many different flavors it made it difficult to make a choice. I ended up getting Spicy Chicken and some Spicy Beef. I couldn't wait to get home to try them and wow they didn't disappoint. They are VERY spicy so if you like 'em hot this is the real deal!

The real selling feature for me is these are gluten free & have no lard!!! Plus, I'd rather support the local peeps than a chain."}
{"text":"I stopped by Molly's stand in Mund's Park with my family and I could not have been more impressed with the tamales. The gentleman working that rainy morning was one of the friendliest people I came across in Arizona. While he tamales were being steamed he asked questions about my vacation a seemed genuinely interested. To top it off, the tamales were outstanding."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed.  First, I never expected to receive frozen tamales from a takeout establishment.  Who wants to go home and heat up their lunch? Second, the tamales were small, extremely dry and had no flavor.  I'm so sad.  I expected better."}
{"text":"I'm also surprised to see a one star review. I have been a dedicated Molly's Tamales customer for years. I won't eat anyones tamales if it isn't a Molly's tamale!  

Molly and her husband are the kindest people in Arizona. They treat you like family and make sure you leave with a smile. We need more business owners like them! 

They have the best variety of tamales. I love having the option to go with the originals beef and pork. But you have to try a southwest chicken, vegan or my favorite salmon.  The variety will blow your mind and make your taste buds go crazy. 

Do check out Mollys Tamales restaurant if your looking for great food and family like service."}
{"text":"First of all...I love the Roadrunner Farmer's Market on Saturdays....It  has introduced to so many fun, yummy local foods, Molly's Tamales being one of those.
Tamales are one of my favorite bits of Mexican fare, the almighty enchilada being number one, and I'm always on the hunt for the perfect tamale.  I think I may have found it!  I have only enjoyed their goodies via the market and have yet to visit their actual establishment.
So far I have had the southwest chicken, chicken & spinach and my new all time favorite.....wait for it!   The wild Alaskan salmon tamale!  Yes, I know you purists are probably shouting blasphemy, but seriously, it is insanely good!  I had one for breakfast this morning:  holy crap!!!!!   
Here are your marching orders:
1.  Find Molly's Tamales...
2.  Buy some tamales...
3.  Eat them and scream in mouth-gasmy bewilderment!

PS - A successful reheating is necessary, so wrap it in a wet paper towel and nuke for 1 minute for the goodness..."}
{"text":"I know little about tamales, but the ones I had from Molly's stand at the Litchfield Park arts festival were delicious!  I had one with potatoes, cheese, carrots, and another vegetable whose name escapes me.  I also tried one with cactus that was yummy, as well.  I had thought that tamales were generally meat-based and am so glad to know that there are many healthier versions from Molly's."}
{"text":"This place was very small and had a funky smell to it, like the sewage or something was bad. The food was ok. I probably won't be going back anytime soon. They do have various flavors of tamales. We tried the vegan ones because they were different but were not impressed."}
{"text":"**BEWARE** Me and my husband tried the pork tamales at an art fair in the Prescott Courthouse Square. We had 2 each (they were on the smaller size) and within 45 minutes, we were RUNNING to the porta-potties!! Then, we had to rush home. We had to stop along the way, as well! This establishment ruined our entire day, as this situation continued throughout the night and the following day. I don't want to assume what happened, but I would never take a chance again with this place! Walk (better yet, RUN) from this food booth!!"}
{"text":"Molly had a stand at the Westgate farmers' market, and I tried one of her (full-size!) samples of red pork. It was very tasty and moist, if not as spicy as I would like. She did say that you can request that your dozen be made spicier. 

It was also really full of meat. She also said that she only uses really good cuts of meat, and no lard.

However, I passed on buying a dozen, as I thought $26 was a little high, and I wanted to try some more elsewhere."}
{"text":"I was at Momma's Organic Market which is a farmers' market in Peoria and Mollies Tamales was there. I bought 2 different kinds of tamales to have for dinner. The older man bagged them up and I paid and when I got home I was shocked at how small they were, what a disappointment. Next, after I steamed them, I noticed how hard the masa was when I cut into one with a fork. The masa was dry and had no flavor. It was truly tasteless masa. But here's what was disturbing more than anything else. The pork and beef weren't shredded as one would expect. It was mushy and greasy. There was a strange film left in my mouth after I took a bite. The filling was kind of like a tub of processed pulled pork or beef that you'd get in the freezer section at Walmart. It was also pretty tasteless. How on earth are they getting away with charging $30 for a dozen small, tasteless tamales? Thankfully, I only bought 3 pork and 3 beef. All in all, I was not happy with paying $15 for 6 small tamales that had no flavor and mushy filling."}
{"text":"Molly's Tamales is a modest little shop that sells wonderful Tamales...and that's not all, Chili Rellanos and Enchilladas are also available but for some reason, there is no menu  and the only thing on the wall menu behind the counter is Tamales.  Still I had two encilladas(cheese) and a tamale (chicken and cheese) .  I skipped the rice and beans....rice and beans is everywhere. What I did have was  wonderful. The other customers who were there swore that everything was delicious and I believe that whole heartedly.
My wife had a couple of  green chili tamales.  While my tamale was good, we enjoyed her's a touch more.
They also serve desert tamales, tamales for diabetics, tamales with cactus (napal) leaves.  As you can see, lots of different kinds of tamales and our food came fast.
There are four tables inside or you can get to-go service.
The place is run by two ladies who are personable, charming, friendly and happy.  
Molly exhibits pride in her store and in the quality of her food. \"No lard or grease, we make our stuff with olive oil\".  
You betcha' we'd eat there again........and we will."}
{"text":"Tried one at a farmers market when we first moved here. Have to say size was good but lacked any good flavor. Nothing like we have in New Mexico I've even made em Better than that myself. Got some jalape√±o jelly from other vendor there have to say it was awesomely good."}
{"text":"I just went into Molly's tamales thinking, \"a place that only makes tamales has to perfect them!\". Boy was I wrong! Terrible Red pork tamale, the place smelled really bad when I walked in, and the table was covered in dust! Never coming again!"}
{"text":"Dry n small tamales. I had high hopes because it seemed legit. Keep looking if you wsnt really good tamales."}
{"text":"Best tamales around! We buy them every year for Christmas Eve. We like the beef and pork."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing. You made a customer for life. I read the reviews about size. They're Tamales. Not burritos. They are perfect size, made from scratch and as authentic as you get. Owner even stayed open late for us to continue our holiday tradition. Thanks. I will be back!!"}
{"text":"You have to love Molly's Tamales for their sheer creativity! A vegan tamale, YES please! And they have so many yummy choices for us veggies! Where else can you find a spicy salmon tamale? If you love tamales, you gotta try this place! Start a new tradition for the holidays!"}
{"text":"I take off a star for the price which isn't to bad which is why it's still 4stars, but I feel there should be a price break when buying a dozen or more at least maybe even for half dozen. We all like to save money, and when buying bulk usually there's a price break even if not much, a few bucks still adds up. They could definitely make the inside less dingy/brighten it up and make it more welcoming, but all that aside I love the tamales! & that's why I go!"}
{"text":"Delicious tamales!  I tried the green chile and it was tasty and the masa had just the right amount of flavor.  I was bummed that they didn't have more of their other options available when I stopped by but you can order them in advance."}
{"text":"I was in Flagstaff this weekend and stopped at a Farmer's Market . Molly's Tamales was there and I bought one veggie. These are the best veggie tamales I have ever had to eat!

I am so happy to have found Milly's tamales here in the valley (43rd and Dunlap). 

These are delicious ...authentic for sure."}
{"text":"I love going to Molly's for delicious Mexican food. 
Doesn't lack a home made taste like other 'fast food' joints. The prices are reasonable as well.

I definately recommend the tamales. And their lunch burritos are huge!

They can be a little slow it getting you their food, but it's worth the wait. 

Doesn't deserve a 1 star for someone not checking their food properly."}
{"text":"From a propane range, served in a tent on the sidewalk of the Courthouse Square, I unwrapped from foil and wax paper a \"golden ticket\" .... actually a \"golden\" Green Corn Tamale. The last GC Tamale they had or i would have bought a dozen. then my Green Chile Chicken Burrito (Burro to those from AZ.) was practically perfect. I paid Molly's husband, sat in the grass and waited once again for the Mariachi band to appear.... but they never do ....?!? 
Real (good) Mexican Food- Yes
Service- traditional Matriarchal Business, she cooks, he keeps his mouth shut
Atmosphere- It's a tent...... but where you find the tent can be fun."}
{"text":"Hand made and delious.  The prices are good.  Very flavourfull.  The owners are very nice."}
{"text":"The best tamales I have ever had, hands down. Pork and Salmon are my favorites!!! No lard, everything is local, awesome!"}
{"text":"Wow, the 1 star below really surprises me!  Are you sure this was Molly and her husband selling these?  If it wasn't, why wouldn't you have called the store...I'm sure they would've been glad to exchange the order to make things right, because that is the kind of people they are.

Molly and her husband are two of the most wonderful people that you could ever have the pleasure of knowing.  They are family oriented and kind...not to mention, wonderful cooks!  

Molly prides herself in making her tamales with the best produce and meat cuts, with NO lard.  I haven't come across a tamale of hers that I haven't liked.  They are a bit \"pricy\" but goes the saying \"you get what you pay for\".  

If you want the best tamales in town (and possibly the best tamales you'll ever try) head on down to their store on 43rd and Olive, or try catching them at one of the local farmers markets, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Wow.  Talk about disappointed.  My wife and I have been loyal Molly's devotee's for years, but this weekend all that went to hell in a handbag.  

When in Prescott and when Molly's is in the square selling grub, we're there to buy it.  Never fail.  This weekend my wife stood in line and ordered 5 \"burritos\" - not tamales.  When they rang her up, it was a bit cheaper than she expected, so she asked if the price was right for five burritos.  The old man behind the register says, \"yes\", and hands her a bag of grub.  The bag felt a bit light, so she again asks, \"these are burrito's, right?\" and he answers, \"Yes, burritos\".  So, the wife gets into car and we drive away.  One minute later she tells me that they've given us tamales - not burritos.  So, we drive back willing to stand in line because we simply love Mollys' food.  

And here's when everything turns south. Upon addressing their \"mix-up\" with the old man behind the register, we are quickly told that the order was correct and they would not offer an exchange. Nor would they give us our money back.  Whatever happened to the old customer service mantra, \"the customer is always right\"?  Apparently the old man has never heard this before.  

Needless to say, my once uber-loyal spouse was not pleased.  Hence this post.  Sorry Molly's...you just lost a few loyal customers over a few burritos."}
{"text":"Good tamales to go, prices are alright, and I was a little frustrated they were out of some options on a Tuesday and actually told me they have been out since Saturday.  Why so long?  Sketchy area too, if you ask me.  Don't mess with the tattoo folks next door."}
