{"text":"We live in the neighbourhood and thought we would try Padella on a recent weekend. The person who answered the phone was terribly rude and gave us a lecture about how we were basically losers for trying to make a reservation (they don't take them, just say so!).

I think the restaurant experience starts before you actually arrive (and so do the best restaurants). So for me this restaurant failed and I would never go to a restaurant, no matter how great the food and ambiance, that can't respect its guests.

Pass!"}
{"text":"Overall decent Italian food. Very good service and quick to prepare the food. Great ambience. Mac and cheese was slightly watery with the cream and oily. The pasta carbonara had too much bacon and an overpowering Smokey flavour. Gnocchi was amazing could definitely tell it was homemade! The gnocchi melts in your mouth."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I were looking for a local neighbourhood restaurant on a recent weeknight, and we came across Padella. I can say without a doubt that our meal here rivalled or surpassed most experiences we have had at other Toronto Italian restaurants. Everything, from the service to the food, was fantastic. 

The flavoured beans served as a complementary appetizer were delicious. We both had their soup of the day - an asparagus and green apple puree - and it was the perfect blend of flavours. For dinner, I had the orecchiette with meatballs and my girlfriend had the bolognese. Both were amazing. One of the best Manhattan cocktails I have had too!

Service was very attentive, and I believe were served by one of the owners. He was extremely friendly and accommodating to my girlfriend's gluten allergy. They have gluten-free pasta and he said they can do most dishes gluten free. 

We will 100% return and I recommend others in the community visit and support this new restaurant! Hopefully it will remain for years to come."}
{"text":"This could easily be a five star review but it falls a bit short on the food.  The ambiance is chillaxing - though can get pretty loud, and the service is spot on for this simple and small Italian restaurant.

Padella is one of the many new restaurants that fill the Avenue Road corridor between Wilson and Lawrence.  You have to be a standout to survive the ever changing gastronomic landscape of this trendy upper Toronto Neighbourhood.

Stepping through the single door you are confronted with a heavy curtain (used as a pseudo-second door that usually baffles the wind and cold).  Once you navigate that, you enter a small restaurant that is BZ!  Almost every seat was taken.  Ended up at the table next to the swinging door of the kitchen.

The aroma of the place made me hungry and I wanted to try so many things.  I ordered the Padella Pizza - can't go wrong with ordering a meal named after the restaurant, it's kind of my thing when trying a new place.  My bud order the scallopini and I also ordered the chopped seafood appetizer.  A couple glasses of wine to complete the order.

The appetizer was ok.  Lots of various seafood served on makeshift radicchio bowl but I found it more salty than it needed to be.  The wood-oven Padella Pizza was better than an Il Fonello but not stellar - simple prosciutto and spinach.  The scallopini was covered in chopped mushroom but my bud seem to somewhat enjoy it.

I watched the other patrons and what they were having.  Next time back, I want to try one of the many pasta dishes they have.

As this is Avenue Road, parking is at a premium and the Parking Enforcement Officers are aplenty here.  Watch out.

Cheers."}
