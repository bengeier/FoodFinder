{"text":"I love the flatbreads, be it in their sandwiches or pizzas. Good location, free wi-fi, unlimited drinks, relaxing atmosphere. I love the melted sandwiches, especially the pesto chicken sandwich. I also enjoy the bufallo chicken pizza as much. My only complain is that they are too generous with their sauces sometimes, which kinda ruin the pizza and the delicious taste of the flatbread. The prices range from 6-7 for the sandwiches, slightly more for the pizza; which, I must say, a bit too pricey for the types of meals."}
{"text":"This place for the price sucks. Food is only ok and the portions suck. 8$ for 6\" sub basically."}
{"text":"I love their flatbread sandwiches.  I don't go often but when I do I get the BMT melt.  I'm a vegetarian and their other veg sandwich just doesn't hold up for me."}
{"text":"Great Fresh food and excellent service. This business values it's customers and it shows.   I've been getting lunch from Cosi at least twice a month for 3 years.   The food selection is pretty good, with quite a few vegetarian options. Their menu is easily accessed online along with the nutritional and allergen info. They keep the website up to date with seasonal offerings as well. They also offer a 'Duo' option where you can choose 2 items of either a small salad, half sandwich, or small soup. It's perfect to change it up for lunch depending on the season.   I've not once had a poor quality meal here. The food is fresh, substantial, and quite tasty. The menus list all ingredients in an item and you can customize. They also provide a 'lightened up' version of many salads and sandwiches that allow you to cut the calories a bit.   I've also had darn great service here, too. Only once did I have to wait an inordinate amount of time for my To Go order. When I asked how much longer it would take, a manager jumped on it right away (despite being super busy) and not only got me my order but gave me a certificate for a free meal. They also offer a 'rewards' deal. 10 purchased meals will get you a free Entree with no restrictions on your selection. The counter staff is very friendly, and there's one older gentlemen who works there who is fantastically outgoing and funny!   The restaurant itself is cozy and clean. I rarely see dirty tables, the decor is warm with a mixture of booths and chairs and tables that can be easily pulled together for larger parties. And free Wi-Fi is also a huge bonus!"}
{"text":"Tried ordering lunch for a small group of people the morning of. The online system automatically assumed I needed it for the next day since I chose \"catering,\"which wasn't obvious, so I didn't notice. So, my stuff wasn't ready when I went to pick it up for the group. The website should be a little more obvious and not assume I am ordering for the next day. Luckily, the staff was nice enough to make it all quickly for me once I arrived to pick it up.  Also...I can't lie. I LOVE their food."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now, once for a late lunch, and once for breakfast.   My first visit, for a late lunch, I had a turkey club sandwich on their regular bread. I must say, I wasn't overly impressed. The bread was a little hard for my tastes, but the ingredients inside were fresh and flavorful, albeit a little dry. But the dryness may have been due to the type of sandwich it was.   Today, my second visit, was for breakfast. I had a Cosi Club Squagel (square bagel). High quality eggs, sausage, (asiago?) cheese, and tomatoes all combined onto one of their delicious square bagels. It was fantastic! I'd definitely go back for another.   Some folks may think Cosi is a bit pricey (and it kind of is), but the ingredients are extremely high quality, so I think it's worth it. Plus they participate in some deals, like the Google Daily Deal (buy one entree get a second free), so we were able to get a great price each time."}
{"text":"Cosi pretends to be a higher end restaurant, but its quality is equivalent to Panera and their prices are higher. Their sandwiches are only mediocre, as well as is everything else they serve. It's not some place that I think about when I think of somewhere to eat."}
{"text":"The food is mediocre at best. Their salads are awful, their soup is thin and tasteless, and their sandwiches are actually good. However it's the service that's the worst. The last 3 times I was there I stood in line for 1/2 hour and waited another 1/2 hour for my food. Each time only one person was taking orders and the line was out the door. That's no way to run a restaurant, especially when all of the working people come in to pick up lunches."}
{"text":"Slowest Cosi ever. I waited 25 minutes for one sandwich and not even at the heart of the rush hour!!  I would avoid this restaurant at all costs for lunch unless your boss is understanding."}
{"text":"For what this is - fastish type sandwiches and pizza, it is great! Their bread rocks - sandwiches and flatbread are good and fast."}
{"text":"I don't like their sandwiches at all. The bread is really hard and cuts your mouth, like its old! The portions are small and the prices are quite high for what you get.."}
{"text":"The food was great.  This was my first time at Cosi, before this evening I had only heard of the name but didn't know much about what they served.  We got a salad and two flat bread pizzas.  The pizzas were great, we got a margherita and chicken & Spinach.  The cheese on both was better than what I had been expecting.  The crust on one was a little on the crispy side (overcooked, but not burnt).    The salad ordered was a seasonal one, which was also very good.  We were eating with three people and they offered to put the big salad in three individual bowls for us.  The salad was served with certain ingredients on the side like we asked, great that they can be customized.  My only complaint, we sat outside and the music, from speakers, was very loud.   The outside seating has a view of the parking lot and the dumpster enclosure.  Overall, the great weather made up for the not so great view."}
{"text":"Stopped at  Cosi this afternoon, and was not impressed.  The store was extremely hot and uncomfortable, the food took FOREVER to get to the table (nearly 30 minutes).  That's too long to wait for a sandwich and small salad.  Staff spent a tremendous amount of time running around looking to deliver food to tables.  Won't go there again."}
{"text":"Cosi has great food. The first time I went here I had a Squagle, their take on a bagel and it was excellent. The cream cheese was super creamy and it was one of the best bagels I have ever had. Today I went there for lunch and tried the California Shrimp and Avocado Sandwich, it was outstanding. Also had their Greek Salad. They make it with chopped cucumber which I loved. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Various friends of mine have told me that Cosi makes good sandwiches, but at best, I find it mediocre. Not that they're bad sandwiches, but I feel that they lack a bit of character and taste -- The sandwiches I've had just seemed too cooked and also seemed to be lacking a bit of a fresh/raw element as well as a couple condiments. I also find them a bit too tiny for the price. Ah well."}
{"text":"It's good reliable food. Just not very generous on their ingredients. The overall portion sizes are good but the ingredients on their salads and pizza's leave something to be desired every time. Good flavors and a great eating environment. Good for studying or reading as well. I'd consider this more of a \"coffee shop\" style place with good food and if you compare it to a cafe instead of a restaurant it's a 4 stars, but it just doesn't quite fit the cafe description so I must leave it at 3.5"}
{"text":"I was randomly in Madison for the first time ever and just wandered down State St looking for eateries, the outside of Cosi looked promising so I went in. It's adorable inside, great decoration and layout. I was there at a slow time, so it may not always be true, but the food was extremely fast. And very delicious. I had a toasty whole wheat pesto chicken melt, and it was all I could have hoped for."}
{"text":"After spending the morning protesting up on the square, my friends and I trooped down State street looking for food so we could continue protesting.  Cosi was a good place for us to land up.  The food was hot and very tasty.  I had a small cup of the spinach and artichoke soup which was creamed - honestly, it would have been better if it was not creamed.  I also had an Italian sandwich that was great.  My bill was about $10.  They delivered the food to our table.  The music in the restaurant wasn't loud and the servers were friendly.  As a casual dining chain restaurant, it's pretty good with better than average fair.  I will definitely go to this and other cosi's again.  For a quick bite (though we weren't rushed to leave), it's a good restaurant to go to."}
{"text":"http://www.getcosi.com/index.html    Madison, WI 250 State St. Cosi 02/15/2012 11:33 am Wow! Visit number one complete. OMG doesn't even begin to describe it. Service is above and beyond excellent, The decor is most inviting, appealing and very relaxing. I had no time so I placed the order to go. I swear, I barely picked up a to go menu and I was ready to be on my way. The staff there is rocking friendly (rocking is a very very good thing in my book). I had the Turkey Alfredo....IT\"S SOOOO GOOD..in a single word *YUM*. They've been there and I never knew until a few days ago.  It's better than Panera's IMHO..omg that sandwich is absolutely delicious. I'll for sure be going back...one more thing..it's sparkling clean inside I could tell right away..I'm still smiling about how nice the lady was that waited on me. I'm super eager to go to Middleton now. Thank you Staff, you're first rate in my book.  Così® - Life Should Be Delicious www.getcosi.com"}
{"text":"Much better than their other franchises in Madison. Service is good and quick. Food quality is good and the bathrooms were clean."}
{"text":"Food allergies beware...   No salads are made fresh. Could not removed specified items from salad everything pre mixed. For the cost one would believe that could make this request happen.    Just disappointed.  Left hungry."}
{"text":"I work close to here and come in for lunch and meetings. Food is marginal but here I am at 3 in the afternoon for a meeting and it is very quiet but several of the tables are dirty, food on the chairs. Business is tough out there get it together Cosi."}
{"text":"Went to lunch there today.  I paid $11 for a old salad and a cup of soup that took me two bites to finish.  WAY overpriced for the quality and quantity.  Will not go there again."}
{"text":"Is it Lunch time yet? If you want a quick pizza for lunch, look no further. They have excellent, quick to cook pizzas for the individual or a few people. I believe I had the Margarita pizza on my first visit. The lunch can get a little pricey, and if you time it wrong, you could find yourself waiting in a lengthy line. But they do a pretty good job of getting people in and out in under 30 minutes for the standard lunch rush.  My co-worker and I have eaten at the same table both times with a few weeks in between and that table is oddly sticky, yet it doesn't appear dirty. We may need to try a different table, we're hoping that's not with all the tables. That being said, the restaurant looks clean, it has many options for party sizes and if memory serves me correctly, there is even a fireplace in the middle of the dining room."}
{"text":"Needed a quick lunch, so I stopped in and got a Margherita flatbread pizza and a Mojito lemonade. Let me be clear, I don't usually eat at chain restaurants except for a select few so I may be biased on principle. But it did not even live up to my very low expectations.   The lemonade was sickly sweet, and I actually could not bring myself to drink it. WAY too much sugar. When I want a mojito lemonade I'm looking for something light and refreshing, not some weird kool-aid mashup with a mint leaf in it.   The pizza, the pizza. Where do I even start? The bread was extremely hard, except where the watery, flavorless tomato sauce made it fall-apart soggy. The mozzarella was barely melted and the whole thing was cold. The only good thing I could say about it is that they put a lot of basil on top, maybe overdoing it, but I don't mind an overabundance of basil. Unfortunately that was the only thing I could taste on the entire pizza besides the overly-salty cold mozzarella.  I came in with pretty low expectations, thinking that this would be a modicum better than fast food like McDonalds or greasy Five Guys, but I was sorely disappointed.   Positives - The interior looked nice, and the staff seemed to be friendly. But even that can't help the fact that their food was awful."}
{"text":"I loved Cosi lunch back in the day when I worked in the Loop in Chicago. Since I was on the west side of Madison and lost in a sea of chain restaurant options, I thought Cosi would be the lesser of the evils. Plus, they have patio seating.  I ordered the hibiscus mint iced tea (good), an Adobo chicken salad and a side of tomato basil soup.  Soup was barely warm, trending cold. I ordered the salad without the tortilla strips and with very light dressing. I can see my receipt captures the correct order. However, the lettuce was drowning in a very tangy dressing and they forgot to include the chicken. I really needed a little protein and appreciated that the chicken they serve has no antibiotics added. Too bad I didn't get any!  I guess the good news is I really stuck to my diet by only eating a 5 oz soup and bit of romaine lettuce for lunch. I did have a couple bites of the flatbread with my soup. I try to stay away from bread since it's so calorie-dense, but it was definitely the star of the meal."}
{"text":"Not a bad place. The prices compared to actual food portions received aren't very impressive in my opinion. The best thing I've tried so far was the mozarella related items. It's very comfortable seating and has a nice, open design that is quiet when there isn't many people there. I need to try it more to experience more of the menu before I am certain where it stands but I do not recommend the \"take 2\" portions."}
{"text":"I do generally like the food at Cosi, but everything else at this place is just terrible. Food is good but not spectacular... when I order a sandwich with a few ingredients and a sauce on it, I would expect it to be generally spread throughout the sandwhich... typically not the case no matter which one I get. For the small sandwich you get, it is WAY over priced. You get tons more at Panera. Plus, the service is so slow I don't understand how I'm waiting so long to make a SANDWHICH when there's hardly anyone else waiting. While I don't have too much to knock on the staff demeanor or food itself, customer service is so bad and the price so high I'd rather go most anywhere else."}
{"text":"Oh Cosi.  Things used to be great between us.  It has been two years since I have eaten there.  In that time, the prices have completely skyrocketed.  The same flat bread that was a little over $6 in downtown Chicago has peaked to over $8 with tax.  That is disheartening.  Yes, I know this location can not help that but it felt dirty to pay that.    The menu is right at the entrance so it gets REALLY congested when you do not know whether people are in line or just reading the menu.  The place is loud so it is hard to hear someone calling you down to their register.  The whole front area is really thrown together.    I appreciate their effort but the layout of this restaurant makes you feel tense and shoved in to a small place. Like a little sausage.    I do LOVE that the quality has not changed.  I ordered the chicken TBM (tomato basil mozzarella) and let me tell you, it was delicious.  Get it hot, otherwise your cheese does not melt.  I usually order the whole wheat bread and it is absolutely noteworthy.  It is hearthy without being too hard and since I am eating fresh mozz, well I like to pretend the whole wheat evens it out.    They are generous with the mozzarella slices and the basil spread you get, wow.  YUM!  Beware, if you do not like basil.  Stay away.  Cosi has very rich flavors.  If you see something on the menu and think, oh it is just something small, I will pick it off.  Nope.  It is a taste explosion in your mouth.  Just avoid that flatbread."}
{"text":"So simple. So good. Why can't every city just have a Cosi by now?  Or at least Milwaukee; that'd be perfect.  Having been here a couple of times now, I consider myself a fan.  Between the pepperoni pizza and the Tuscan pesto chicken sandwich, Cosi offers tasty options for fast but warm meals without tasting cheap or unhealthy.  Me gusta."}
{"text":"While this place definitely isn't as good as Panera, I love their flatbread and salads.  Slightly pricey for \"fast food\" but the staff is SO nice and always seem like they are enjoying their jobs, something that is rare at a quick eats restaurant.  Just tried their new dinner meal pasta dishes, I wouldn't recommend them, stick with the soup/salad/sandwich menu.  All -in-all the staff is the thing that keeps me coming back.  I haven't tried breakfast - the other reviewer keeps having problems with his orders, I can't comment on that.  No problems at night!"}
{"text":"I stopped in to get a bowl of soup on my walk home yesterday. I go the soup of the day, turkey chili, and it was definitely average. The flatbread that came with it was pretty bad. Everything was served in paper, even though I got it to eat there, which I thought was pretty weird.   There are lots of great local restaurants on State St, and I don't know why I came in here.. I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch last Friday while in Middleton.  The place really reminded me of Panera.  The decore was very nice, and it was cool to see the pizza oven.  I also realyl liked the couch-like seating.  I had a half of their Chicken Tinga sandwich and half of their signature salad with multi-grain bread as my side.  The salad was very good, and I really enjoyed the pistachios.  The sandwich was average.  It seemed small, even for a half, and there did not seem to be anything but chicken on it.  The bread is flat bread, and is a bit dry, especially for a side.  I needed something to dip into.  I like the lemonade they have on tap.  I did not pay, so I cannot comment on the price.  All-in-all it was a decent meal, and I felt a bit better about myself after it that over something deep fried.  I look forward to going to another location, and trying they pizza, along with a few other menu items."}
{"text":"I had to use the bathroom before a long trip. I popped into various stores and eateries along the street, and I was disappointed with a \"no\" each time. Desperate, I stopped at Cosi and asked. Finally, a yes--no purchase necessary! On top of that, the bathroom was clean and smelled kind of nice.  Thank you, Cosi. I love your food, decor, and atmosphere!  (As thanks, I ended up buying something healthy.)"}
{"text":"I always loved the Cosi in downtown Washington DC and found myself drawn to them more often than not when having lunch outside the brown bag. This Cosi is very conveniently located in the shopping center near World Market where we were cruising the other day. We ordered the tomato basil bisque and another sandwich which I think was chicken. I had the salmon salad which was good with the vegetables seeming pretty fresh. I was disappointed that the bread was not fresh and was tough. When the lunch crowd is anticipated or at any other time of day the bread should be something you can actually eat and enjoy. There was no big line at the time we went but seeing the menu while you are in the line is not really an easy thing here. Moving the menu back is maybe an idea that would help. I have seen better days at Cosi cafes and hope that in the future things will be super again."}
{"text":"This restaurant is filthy. The front doors were filled with handprints that were there for days. I understand the occasional handprint after a busy lunch - but this was layers and layers of handprints. Such a turn-off. I went in and ordered a to-go meal- salad and soup- and asked to talk to the manager. I mentioned to her about the doors and her explanation was that they only have their windows cleaned bi-weekly by a service. I said, really - you don't clean your front door daily? Anyway, I had ordered, so I sat there watching a male employee try on and off an obviously shrunken black coat, touch his head and his hat numerous times, and then bag and deliver people's food. I looked around at the bottles of syrup for coffee, don't think they've ever been wiped down. Looked around at the floor, again - not recently cleaned and not a \"care about your job kind of sweeping\". I watched employees work with aprons on that haven't been laundered.   Since I knew which one was the manager, I watched her prep meals behind a higher counter. I saw her, with \"gloved\" hands go back to the kitchen for supplies. That's when I realized I couldn't eat my meal, and that I just might puke. The kitchen door hadn't been cleaned and was filled with smutz (what I would say is BACTERIA). With the same \"gloved\" hands that touched that disgusting door, I saw my food being ladeled/dished up, which was handed over to the dude who kept touching his head, had and dandruff/lint filled microfleece jacket, on to me.  So I left, with a bag of $10 food. Went over to Culver's, where there business is 3-4 to maybe even 6 times that of Cosi at lunch time. Employees are clean, aprons are clean, the doors and counters look like they have been washed (yes two kids handprints on one door, but really, it was lunch time so I do expect a few - not hundreds). Ordered another lunch and when I got to my work I tossed the Cosi lunch immediately. I cannot afford to get food poisoning and I was so GROSSED out!!!  I thought more about it and decided if your front door looks like that, I can't imagine the kitchen.   YUCK YUCK YUCK.   I don't care that I'm out $10 - after all, food poisoning, my deductible, and missed work would be far more expensive and risky."}
{"text":"Where I live downtown there is a Cosi directly across the street from a Noodles and Company. I decided to check out Cosi for a second time one evening when there was a line at Noodles that was out the door.   I walk into Cosi, I order two Tuna melts with chips, to go - I pay 18 bucks.    I take my number and I sit down, 40 minutes later I go to the front counter to find out  what the eff is going on.  What's going on is a group of young workers unprepared for the dinner rush and completely disoriented because of it.    I get my food, I go home, I end up taking two bites and throwing the entire thing away. Horrible meal, tough bread. Barely any tuna, and a nasty tasting sauce on the sandwich.   After two bad experiences I will not be returning to Cosi."}
{"text":"Worst service ever. Ran out of food not prepared to service any size crowd. I have been to others and this one needs new management. horrible !!!!!!"}
{"text":"Stayed at the Hilton so this was a quick walk across the parking lot. Had the clam chowder. Portion size was decent. Thought it was a bit salty.  Bread that came with it was delicious. Service was fast and friendly. Will not eat here the next time I am in town."}
{"text":"I really enjoy the sandwich I always get here.  Problem is the restaurant is dirty.  I had a hard time dining in and not noticing the crumbs everywhere, unkempt floors and surfaces needing to be wiped down.  Ruined my appetite a bit..but still enjoyed my food!"}
{"text":"I had been here a few times a few years ago and remembered how much I enjoyed it. I ordered the flat bread last week and was so excited to eat it. However, it was like a frozen SMALL \"flat bread\" that wasn't fully cooked. It was cold and soggy and didn't have good flavors. I do love the steamers though!"}
{"text":"We've gone here twice now and enjoy coming here. The food is good and the prices are a little high but not horrible. Especially since we had a coupon from the Bucky book. Today I had the tomato basil soup and the buffalo bleu sandwich. Both were really good the only complaint I have is the bread was pretty salty today."}
{"text":"I stopped in one evening hoping to find some soup and I was thrilled that they offered a homemade chicken noodle.  I got a soup and regular bread to go.   The soup was very good and the bread was a unique flat bread.    This is a sandwich shop where you can get salads or soups and a few other items.  It is quite large inside and very clean.  It's a step above fast food for sure.  I will definatley return when i can try the appetizers."}
{"text":"We were driving through Madison and stopped here for lunch.  The food was great and it was a good value for the money."}
{"text":"In summary: Fast casual sandwiches, sandwiches, soups, coffeehouse drinks, and flatbread pizzas. Emphasis on the heart oven for making the bread&pizzas.  Free wi-fi.  The salads are one of the better menu options, as they use some premium ingredients for a reasonable price (salmon on a green salad for a salad cost of $8.50 ain't bad).  The coffeehouse drinks run the gamut of espresso, lattes, hot chocolates, and chais, although I can't testify about the quality for coffee aficionados.  Pizzas are not as good as a dedicated Neopolitan pizza place but you'll feel more virtuous about the healthiness compared to a chain pizza place.  The pizzas are made with flatbread and the cheese is mostly little mozzarella balls rather than a \"pizza cheese\" mix.  I've had Chicken Mozzarrella  with grilled chicken, fresh mozzarella, basil and tomato and Chicken Spinach with grilled chicken on a white pizza with onions, mozzarella and Parmesan. I think a wee bit more time in the oven would have benefited these pizzas to brown the cheese slightly and ensure all melted.  Still, both had a generous amount of chicken and vegetables.  I do like the S'mores dessert.  They bring you a little sterno oven, Hershey's bars, and marshmallows for two to make real S'mores. Fun!  As for this location, when I visited on a weeknight, only 1 customer was dining in.  The dining area is very large and I think this location primarily caters to lunchtime customers.  The person closest to the register was cleaning, and when I approached, he looked at me but didn't say anything. Later, another employer took my order but a \"Hello, someone will be right with you\" would have been mighty helpful.    Also they drew a picture of a chicken drinking a martini on my \"chicken margarita\" pizza box and a picture of a chicken eating pizza on the other pizza, which I enjoyed. Not sure if they take custom requests.  All in all, it's not my favorite chain fast casual restaurant, but it's a good option and I've certainly stopped in for a cheap date with S'mores (mmm...fire)"}
{"text":"First off, my husband and I love the food.  It's great for a quick, healthy lunch.  However, when I get charged $5 more when it goes through my bank account that what I approved? That's really not cool.  It's very disappointing. I don't think we'll be back because it appears whenever someone other than the manager rings us up, they leave themselves a tip."}
{"text":"The place is really welcoming...always clean and presentable...the cashiers greet you the moment you open the door...the sandwiches and salads they have are super fresh and made to order I've had them cater a few of my business meetings and I was very satisfied with the presentation as well as the quality of what they gave me They're a bit pricier than some of their competitors but they seem to make sure that you're satisfied...so it makes sense since you get what you pay for, right?"}
{"text":"Literally no one else in there except me and it took 15 min for three dudes and two people at the register to make a wrap. Been here a couple times and each time I wonder why I didn't just starve."}
{"text":"I just loooooooooooove their flatbread sandwiches. Also the fact that you can get really creative and pick your own unique combination makes it very interesting.   They've got quite a few ingredients and dressings to choose from. So plenty of opportunities to mess up as well!"}
{"text":"Chocolate cupcake - real good."}
{"text":"I don't think is so bad. There's nothing to rave about, but I do like their flat-bread. The flat-bread sandwich is much better than the typical mid-west white sub buns. I think they are aiming for upscale, contemporary fast food, but the execution is mediocre and ambiguous. I can see why many people prefer other places with more definite local flares."}
{"text":"Although Cosi is close to my home I had not yet visited as I heard many not so fantastic things about this place.  To sum it up, \"It isn't that bad.\"  My muffeleta sandwich included a gigantic handful of cold olives in the middle of my otherwise warm lunch, but my friend's salad seemed quite tasty. My bread was craggy and hard.  My side of carrots instead of chips were scary looking. (they looked like baby carrots that have been sitting in your fridge for 3 weeks) I may return, but not upon my own volition. Panera is better, way better. (2.5 stars)"}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch in between shopping. Prices are a tad high for what you end up getting, portion size. I order the house salad, which was awesome! I also ordered a chicken melt, which was not impressive. Next to no sauce, mozz cheese that was still cold and not even close to melted. To top it off, before heading back out to cont shopping, I decided to order an Americanio....for some reason the manger taking my order was pissed. Kept sighing as I told her how I liked it made, then she turns to the co worker and says,\"she asked for an Americanio , but that's not what it is at all...do this and that and this...oh, and whip on top\". I was close to saying  forget it, and walking next door to starbucks. She then hands me my coffee completely screwed up WITH no whip.....not worth coming back for the salad..."}
{"text":"This is a great spot to grab a bite during your lunch hour. It is spacious and comfy. The staff was super friendly and helpful. The appetizers are decent portions . I had the spinach dip & the warm brie with fruit, I couldn't finish both in the first sitting. Both were DELISH. Cosi is a little pricey, but the food is delicious."}
{"text":"The food is flavorful and the atmosphere distinctive... But even more distinctive is the thin, cracker-like \"bread\" they serve their sandwiches on. It's an interesting change of pace from a traditional sandwich, and you might like it, but I wasn't too impressed. But their smoothies are decent, and I like the fact that they offer a side of carrots as a healthy alternative to chips."}
{"text":"Cosi makes a darn good flat bread sandwich, and their salads are great too (so I'm told). The atmosphere is very modern and minimalist. So, although they have free wi-fi, this isn't the place to try to find a comfy couch and surf the 'net all afternoon.  It's a great spot for busy young professionals to rendezvous downtown for a tasty lunch date. Or just a casual lunch with friends with a discerning palate and thin wallet."}
{"text":"I was a little skeptical at first because the menu really reminded me of Panera Bread, but the food doesn't even compare.  Every bite was as good as the last.  It was exactly what I needed for a lite dinner.  For such a small menu, I felt I had a lot of options.  Better than the food was the service!  We had a huge party come in with us (so we had A LOT of little requests) and they were very accommodating.  At no point did I ever feel that I was an annoyance from either employee that was working. At one point though they did lose the ticket for one person in the group, for which they apologized and actually returned his money.  It's not often I give a 5, but given the quality of the food, excellent service, and professionalism of the staff, it's the right choice."}
{"text":"I visited this Cosi location on a Thursday around 11:30. There was a very long line when I arrived--the rush died down after 1pm. The counter staff was very friendly and appologized when she gave me the wrong change back. I ordered a smoothie and lounged around for several hours. The smoothie was just fine--nothing fancy, just made from a smoothie base. The atmosphere was very comfortable and I was able to find a outlet to plug my laptop into. Free wireless. Definitely an OK experience, but nothing out of the ordinary as far as counter lunch service goes."}
