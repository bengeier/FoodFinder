{"text":"Really good Chinese food. Second review here. Favorite Chinese place in Pittsburgh. So cheap, tasty, and clean. Love the lo mein and my family loves the moo shu."}
{"text":"Not that impressed.  It's close to home, so we might visit once in a while, but we went expecting great food based on all the reviews here.  While it wasn't terrible like food court style Chinese, it certainly wasn't great.  Sesame Inn was still better in my opinion, as is Chen's in Cranberry.

That said, it was a good amount of decent food for a small amount of money.  The General Tso Sauce was a little too thick for me, but tasted ok.  The Kung Pao Chicken was pretty good.  Beef Broccoli was overcooked and a little mushy.  Noodles were good, not overcooked like a lot of places.

Decent food for cheap.  But certainly not great."}
{"text":"well sesame inn has fallen off so now yeung's house gets my top pick"}
{"text":"I would put 0 stars if I could. Got sick vomiting and high fevers immediately after eating here. Gastroenteritis secondary to this poorly prepared food. Caution."}
{"text":"It's not your typical greasy Chinese fast food. It seemed a lot healthier. Food has good taste, big portion for the price. We love it, the kids love it - what more can you wish for!?"}
{"text":"The best Chinese food I've had thus far while living in Pittsburgh. Vegetable moo shu is delicious. Good price, great food."}
{"text":"I've been eating here for years. It is one of my favorite Chinese Restaurants! The food is always on time, delicious and so reasonably priced it makes you scratch your head! I always get the  sweet and sour chicken with friend rice. Great lunch specials as well.  Everything here tastes great, never a bad experience."}
{"text":"Hugh portions for the price. Excellent taste and plenty of parking. Shrimp spring rolls had plenty of shrimp and shrimp lo mein was amazing!"}
{"text":"the worst Chinese I ever ate. just wasted 60$ on garbage food.GO SOMEWERE ELSE"}
{"text":"We've been on the hunt for a good Chinese place for awhile now. That search ended tonight! Both entrees were great and priced well. Can't go wrong ordering from here. We are already talking about getting it again in a few days"}
{"text":"Very rude staff. Treated like garbage from the minute I walked in. Food may be good but they need to learn how to treat people."}
{"text":"Delicious chinese food!  I usually get the chicken with mixed vegetables and it is always very fresh tasting.  Lots of vegetables and real chicken.  Great brown sauce too.  They only reason I don't give 5 stars is because of customer service.. they aren't exactly rude but they are a little cold.  Also, the ambience inside is a little awkward, this place is best for take out.  If what you want is awesome food to take you with you, this place is a safe bet!!"}
{"text":"this is our usual takeout chinese place.  It is decent and cheap, plain and simple.  this isn't the place you want to go with seafood dishes etc."}
{"text":"Yeung's House. What else should I say, really? They're tremendous people. Wonderful. They're very great people. I made a deal with them. A great deal, let me tell you. They brought me loads of food for very little money, ok. I would give them 7?8?9? maybe even 10 or 20 stars if I could."}
{"text":"This is an amazing Chinese restaurant.   The portions are large and always delicious.   I was there a few weeks ago and noticed a lot of chopping going on in the kitchen and I asked the person taking our order what was up.  They were making ingredients for their egg rolls.  Not surprising that food there is fresh; it explains the taste."}
{"text":"Lived near this restaurant for several years.  This Chinese take-out place is awesome.  My husband and I have eaten there numerous times.  The food has always been fresh, hot and tasty.  (Be forewarned that some of the other Chinese restaurants in the area have some suspicious tasting meat in their dishes but Yeung's House is definitely not one of them).  Coming from Hawaii where there is an abundance of great tasting Chinese take-out places, this was the closest thing to home for us.

From the outside, you may dismiss the restaurant as being another hole-in-the-wall establishment but the inside is very clean and well kept.  The best deal is the lunch special which ends around 3:00 p.m.  You get an entree, egg roll, soup and fried rice for a very reasonable price.  Our favorites were General Tso's chicken and beef with broccoli."}
{"text":"Consistently good take out. We always order the general Tso, wonton, lo mein, or moo goo gai pan and swear by them. We've eaten here a dozen times and I've yet to venture out with my order. Your food is almost always ready in 10 minutes too."}
{"text":"My favorite local Chinese joint.  Always hot and fresh, and always fast.  Even my little guys gobble up the veggie lo mein.  You can't go wrong with the veggie egg rolls, general Tso's, and fried rice.  Yeung's has never disappointed!"}
{"text":"We ordered take-out this weekend. Upon arrival, a man was washing the restaurant's windows and they looked great. The server pleasantly greeted me and promptly retrieved my order. The food was perfectly prepared as requested and was served piping hot. The portions were quite large. We will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Inexpensive and solidly-consistent Chinese-American food. No frills.  All the standards."}
{"text":"Solid Chinese takeout standards . Everything was very good and prices well below many places with more well known names in pgh"}
{"text":"The food is always fresh and delicious. It is usually made within 15 minutes. The woman who works the at the counter is so nice. My daughter and I love the cashew chicken and hot/sour soup."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by the amount of food given for the lunch specials. In my experience at Chinese restaurants in Pittsburgh, it usually isn't very much. I ordered a few sides because I was expecting to still be hungry afterwards. I was ordering for two and got an egg foo young lunch special, beef with broccoli special, an order of crab rangoon, two extra egg rolls (the specials included both soup and an egg roll), and the total was just under $20. We had plenty to take home with us. As far as the food quality and service were concerned, overall I thought it was good. The staff was polite and the food satisfied my craving for Chinese food (the egg roll especially; it was excellent). A few reasons prevented me from giving five stars: I really love crab rangoon and tea, and I didn't really care for either one of theirs. I hope reading that doesn't prevent anyone from coming though, because overall, I found the food both cheap and good, and the staff was nice. I will return."}
{"text":"This place is phenomenal.  

Seriously I know it's not the look it's the final product. 

For example got a large wonton soup. Could have sworn I had at least 12 wontons. The larger places. (sesame inn & others) you're lucky if you get 5."}
{"text":"I never expected to be giving 5 full stars for Chinese take out, but this place is a winner! We ordered from here on a weekend evening. The only issue I ran into with ordering from here is that I had to locate their menu online from Google. They dont have it posted anywhere -so definitely pick up one of their paper menus if you take out. I called in our order and the woman on the phone was very friendly- it was already off to a good start. I called back to make an adjustment to the order and she was super nice about it also, which I appreciated.

 I drove to the restaurant to pick up our order and the place was IMMACULATE in its cleanliness. I couldn't believe how clean and organized the restaurant and counter were. Needless to say I was impressed. The parking lot was full when I got there - always a good sign - and my order was ready as soon as I got there! No wait time at all - order was perfect, except for one white rice that was supposed to be a fried rice - nothing I cant overlook as there was no price difference for one or the other. As a take out place it was also nice that there was an area for those who pick up where you can grab your own plastic cutlery, napkins, soy sauce, duck sauce, and hot mustard. This was also really nice as most of the time when ordering Chinese take out, they just throw a couple of sauces in the bag. I liked being able to get everything together myself and pick up what we wanted. 

I tried a few different menu options to check out the quality of their basic offerings. We went with egg rolls, General Tso's, Chicken with Broccoli, Kung Pao Chicken, and Vegetable Lo Mein. For all of that- it was only about 28.00 - a super good deal as we ate for half the week! We were not disappointed in one single thing. It was all super hot when I got it home and super delicious. There were huge chunks of real chicken in both the Chicken with Broccoli and Kung Pao Chicken. The General Tso's was also delish and the Lo Mein had tons of whole, fresh veggies in it and was not greasy, as some Lo Mein's can be. All vegetables in all of our dishes were large chunks of real veggies - they were crisp, not wilted or old or non-existent. Probably some of the best take-out I have had in awhile. Needless to say, we will definitely be ordering from here again, and it is now our go-to for Chinese in this area.

If Yeung's House is near you, it is a great option for take out- you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Easily my favorite Chinese take-out in the area. Food is always hot and tasty and the prices are extremely reasonable. They're always fast too."}
{"text":"I was so happy to discover just how good Yeungs house was when we bought our Westview home a few weeks ago.  Everything is delicious.  My favorite is the shrimp rolls, made with the flaky wrapper as opposed to the doughy dry wrap other places use. The shrimp are always very fresh, and no mystery smells in the food like most places you'll find around town.  
From the outside, it doesn't look like much - but try your favorite go-to Asian favorite.  I'm almost certain you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Was really excited to try this place based on reviews. Liked the fact that they have small and large portions so that you don't have too much food. My problem was with the egg roll... it dropped out so much grease when I was eating it. Only ate half and felt sick from all the oil."}
{"text":"I had a fantastic experience. Always good value for price and good portions too. Really delicious!!! A lot better than Sesame Inn!!"}
{"text":"I rarely eat Chinese and the only menu items that appeal to me are hot and sour soup and steamed dumplings. I'm usually weary to try a new place but after someone suggested Chinese I yelped the local places to me since I just moved to PA.  Well the steamed dumplings are superb! The sauce is sweet and delicious with enough flavor you might want to drink it... Seriously. I haven't yet but if no ones watching next time I order, I may. The hot and sour out is good, it has more black pepper flakes than I'm used to,  it other than that it's very tasty. 

Since this place has been discovered a week ago, I've ordered this 3 times. It's clear I like it. Yum!"}
{"text":"My wife and I eat here once a month or so and the food is always good. Our food is always ready in 15 minutes or less and the staff is friendly. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone that likes Chinese."}
{"text":"I decided to stop in for take out after driving past it several times.  The lunch menu featured many options for the right price.  I believe I paid less then $7 dollars for my selection.  I was very surprised to see that the lunch portion was large enough to be considered dinner size.  Hot tea is available as you wait .  The dining area is very spacious ."}
{"text":"Always a good choice for pick up! Never had a bad meal- recommend the chicken lo mein! The combo meals are the way to go"}
{"text":"Portions are large, and very affordable!  The workers are always friendly. You can't find chinese food this good, with this large of portions for takeout anywhere around here.  Every time I call to order is always ready within 15-20 minutes, I've only every had to wait one time,  and we have been ordering here for 6 years."}
{"text":"I got takeout from here for dinner this past Sunday with my girlfriend.  This has actually been my go to takeout Chinese place for a while because the food tastes great, you get a ton of it and it's cheap.

For my dinner entree I ended up ordering one of their lunch specials.  You can do this for $1 more at dinner and it comes with an egg roll and soup of you choice.  So for my entree i ordered an extra spicy general tsaos chicken with hot and sour soup and fried rice.  Their hot and sour soup might be my favorite hot and sour soup in the burgh with a very peppery taste in addition to the normal flavorings.  The egg roll was crispy on the outside and filling although not overly tasty.  My General Tsaos was both sweet and spicy due to my ordering of it and was very pleasant to my palate.  The rice never is anything special but since you already have had a ton of other food, it is tough to finish.  I think that in the end, it cost my girlfriend and I $13 for two lunch specials which both of us struggled to finish.

The bottom line for me is that I will definitely be back here in the future.  The food taste itself is probably only about  four stars but the quantity combined with the price and always courteous customer service makes this a 5 star place to me."}
{"text":"Our go to for Chinese take out in the West View area...we've ordered several times and were happy each time. 
This week we ordered off the lunch special menu...comes with egg roll, soup and rice. I won't order off this menu again because I didn't like the extras. They only had pork egg rolls so I didn't get one and I didn't like the egg drop soup. The meal itself had good flavor. I had the chicken with garlic sauce. The menu indicated this was a spicy dish but I didn't find it so. My husband had the hot and spicy chicken. He didn't find it all that spicy but he said it was tasty. He didn't like the wonton soup but he did like the egg roll. 
We will no doubt be ordering again."}
{"text":"Delicious!  We've tried several different dishes and they have all been great.  Good prices on the lunch specials as well."}
{"text":"There are two Chinese restaurants near me and Yeung's House was the one I had not tried yet. This evening I had a craving for so General Tso's and decided to try them out. As far as looks and everything goes, this is just about the same as any other Chinese takeout joint with one glaring difference.  Yeung's is extremely clean and well kept! It was noticeable as soon as I walked in. You can look back into the kitchen and it looks very well kept. They have the familiar picture menu above the register counter and your typical takeout flyer menu. I was greeted by a very friendly woman who spoke to me first. I placed my order and after a short wait, my General Tso's and Shrimp Spring Roll were ready.  The wait was under 10 minutes.  I ordered off of the Chef's Specials which was explained to be larger portions. The General Tso's was only $9.95 and believe me, there was enough there for two meals!  It was delicious and exactly what I was looking forward to.

The convenient location, friendly service, clean atmosphere and food are all reasons why I will be back!  I highly suggest checking out Yeung's House if you live nearby."}
{"text":"We drove the extra 10 minutes to give this place a try instead of our normal chinese take out in Crafton. It definately was worth the drive. The general tso chicken was made to perfection as well as the egg rolls and fried rice. The price was a little bit higher than our local place but it was still under $10 per person. If you are within 15 minutes of this place and like chinese take out, I would definitely recommend Yueng's."}
{"text":"I have to start by saying I do not like Chinese takeout because in my experience it's always gross. When my boyfriend mentioned trying here I was hesitant but figured what the hell. I ordered an egg roll, vegetable lo mien and chicken and broccoli. All of it was pretty good. The egg roll was crispy to my surprise being it was take out. He ordered a bunch of differ things, said he wasn't a fan. (I think he just liked the crappy stuff he is used to in our old neighborhood). I would order again."}
{"text":"Always good, fresh and reasonable $
We always have the steamed dumplings 
 Shrimp Lo mein
Programmed in the phone"}
{"text":"Just had a great meal at Yeung's House. The world has far too many chinese takeouts with at best marginal food. This place definitely breaks the mold. I got the the \"Hot and Spicy Chicken\" and was quite pleased. Full of fresh veggies (carrots, green pepper, mushrooms, broccoli, baby corn, water chestnuts) and while it was spicy, it wasn't not knock your socks off spicy. The pint sized order, with an included cup sized side of rice, was plenty to fill me up."}
{"text":"Yeungs house is pretty much a cheaper version of Sesame Inn. The general tso chicken is the best thing I've eaten here. The only thing that sucks about this place is the parking lot, it's all torn up and the place looks a little shady, but the food is great"}
{"text":"In an unfamiliar neighborhood and with 6 hungry people in the car, we relied on yelp to select Yeung's House. The good reviews were well deserved. It was a solid choice for no frills Chinese food at a very reasonable price. My only suggestions would be to provide eat in customers with actual plates instead of styrofoam. Also, the decor could use an updating and/or a good scrubbing. The tables and chairs felt grimy to the touch. Yes, If I was ever in the neighborhood, I would return."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite Chinese place! The food is flavorful, well priced, and the portions are very generous. I also love a good egg roll, and the ones here are FANTASTIC. Also, the workers are always really kind and efficient. The one woman even knows my dad's order just by recognizing his voice! The inside is clean."}
{"text":"I rarely give 5 stars to a business, but this place has been great! The staff is friendly, the takeout orders are quick, FRESH food, and very reasonable prices compared to other Chinese restaurants in the area. We've had just about everything on the menu here.. the General Tso's chicken is fresh meat, and always tastes great. The Lo Mein is not greasy, also fresh. We love their steamed dumplings and eggs rolls too! I would highly recommend takeout from here, as we have never eaten inside. Reasonable prices and fresh Chinese food are a must when getting takeout."}
{"text":"I'm not going to give a long review for this place as it doesn't need it.  Yeung's simply has the best Chinese food in Allegheny county and one of the best places I've eaten at.  The prices are very fair and downright cheap.  The food tastes fresh and the veggies are never soggy and few like most American-Chinese fare places.  The sauces aren't bogged down with salt and corn syrup.  
Just a great friendly place located in MY neighborhood!  Couldn't be happier.  

Try Yeung's you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This is not only some of the cheapest Chinese food around, but hands down some of the best. I order from here frequently and have never once been disappointed, in fact, almost every time I finish eating I wax about how great all of it is. 

They have a pretty extensive menu and have never once gotten my order wrong. I also really appreciate how easy it is to order over the phone. 

The only thing I keep wishing is that they'd open a buffet (even a tiny one) with all the space they have. I'd eat in at least once a week."}
{"text":"Excellent Chinese food, and huge bonus, they don't use MSG!  Great for quick take-out!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Chinese take out place of all time. I had to move to Denver for a year and I missed this place so much. Chinese food in Denver seriously sucks. I have lived in Pittsburgh for 26 years and this is my favorite. The staff is always sooooo pleasant and friendly. We always get general tsos, chicken with mixed veggies, fried rice, pork lo mein, beef lo mein, chicken lo mein, or egg rolls, they are all excellent. Change for fried rice with no extra charge. HUGE PORTIONS feed 4-5 people for $20. The pork lo mein has to be our favorite has an excellent smoked pork flavor. Everything looks, smells, and taste very fresh."}
{"text":"The food here is good but not outstanding. I had the mushroom egg foo young which was good but the brown sauce was a bit salty. The other thing we got was the General Tso's chicken. This was pretty good but again not outstanding. The crab rangoon was very good, crispy and good flavor. Meals here are a pretty good value for what you get but not a place for a special dinner.  I wish the place was a little cleaner. The tables have greasy and sticky smudges on them and the rug from the door to the counter is down right filthy. When you look over the counter into the kitchen, the kitchen looks clean. All in all, I go there for takeout."}
{"text":"Quick service. A little expensive for dinner but so affordable for lunch. 

Decent food and portions."}
{"text":"You will NOT be disappointed by the food from Yeung's.  Large and satisfying portions are complimented by fantastic prices.  Less than $8 for a lunch combo anywhere is laughable and the quality would be questionable... but it's the standard at Yeung's.  The food is so good that I'm not even going to deduct a star for not offering delivery.  Sure, it would be great but then I think that would raise prices and possibly affect quality if drivers were spread too thin.  If I'm out and about, but don't want to pay for a sit down meal or eat garbage mall food court Chinese, Yeung's will always be my first choice for carry out!"}
