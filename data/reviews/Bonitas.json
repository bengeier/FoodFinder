{"text":"Come here often for breakfast burritos and love them.   Green sauce is delicious.  Sometimes service is slow but food is worth it."}
{"text":"Very pleasant and smooth customer service, always let me customize my breakfast burrito(2 eggs, crispy potatoes, jalapenos, and cheese), their rice and beans are pretty decent as well. Habanero sauce and the \"hot\" sauce are amazing. If the burrito was sitting at $6 this would easily be 10000/5 stars for me. Being extremely close to my house I'm more than willing to drop the dollar more. I suggest going here."}
{"text":"The food is fantastic! You have got to try the Big Booty Burrito! Amazing! What a great addition to the area! The staff, the several times I have been there recently, are extremely pleasant! Oh and you have to try their pasole. Ask for a sample and you will be hooked."}
{"text":"Green Chili Burrito, enchilada style is so good, I could eat it everytime I come here, but you have to try the shredded beef tacos too, they are so good.  The people are nice and the food is awesome.  Thank you for making my taste buds happy and my tummy full."}
{"text":"Had my monthly inventory at work. I ordered 21 burritos. 21 employees satisfied! Everything was awesome !"}
{"text":"They have a taco Tuesday special. The tacos were so good I went back Wednesday and paid full price"}
{"text":"Delicious! I've only been there a couple of times.
Carne Adasa Burrito!!!! awesome!
Tacos!!! very good!
Posole! super awesome!!!

Green guacamole hot sauce.. wow!!!!"}
{"text":"Reasonable price and nice tasty! Green Chile, red Chile, shredded beef and chicken, they are wonderful."}
{"text":"Great breakfast burritos with lots of bacon or sausage.  I have tried both.  - Excellent tortillas surrounding ample contents.  Ask for extra hot sauce."}
{"text":"Bonita's is absolutely delicious!! We have been here a few times and have tried the carne asada burrito, fish tacos, breakfast burrito and the pozole. Everything is great, especially the carne asada!! Chips and salsa is delicious as well as the baja sauce. We've ordered to go and have also dined in. We'll definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"The food was very delicious. And the two young waitresses were very nice and knowledgeable about the menu. The food was delivered promptly to my table with a smile. I will definitely be eating here again."}
{"text":"Large portions and good prices. However its extremely bland in taste. Ordered a green chili shredded chicken burrito w rice and beans. After waiting 20 minutes I had to inquire about my order and they informed me they forgot to actually make it. After waiting another five minutes it came out. Quite large but the beans tasted like canned refried beans the chicken was dry and tasteless, plus they gave me no rice.

So good if you are really hungry and don't care about taste.

I personally won't waste my time when I can get a better burrito at filibertos"}
{"text":"The service was good.  Young lady at the counter was pleasant and not bothered with my questions about the food.  I ordered the enchiladas.   The woman from the back (owner or manage perhaps.  Suggested i try one red and one green enchilada to try em both.   Each enchiladas had about 2oz of chicken by my guess.  Great mild flavor.   Both sauces were tasty.  The green was my favorite...it was a bit creamy and mild in heat.  I paid $6.71 total for two small/med size fresh made enchiladas.   Perhaps too expensive but satisfying enough.   I will eat here again."}
{"text":"Okay, it is a awesome small Mexican restaurant. Great food and friendly service, I was satisfied with them."}
{"text":"I have been here probably 5 times or more and not once was I disappointed.  Whether I ordered Beef Tacos, Shrimp Tostadas, Fajitas, etc, it all was pretty good. If you are in the area and wanting Mexican food, I would definitely recommend this over the Taco Smell next door."}
{"text":"All the food surprisingly was pretty good. Had a variety   of their menu from posole to green chili burrito pleased with all."}
{"text":"We used to always get food from here until we received not one but 2 huge soup bones in our menudo to go.  One in my husbands and one in mine.  That's when we decided we were done with going there.  It was disgusting we never went back.  My daughter also stopped going there and she use go there regularly."}
{"text":"Great food and service.  The green chile beef burrito and carne asada taco were excellent!"}
{"text":"What a great little taco shop I would put this place against the top places here in Valley cheap fast and good portions and there mini Bandidos are really good as well even though the nickel and dime me for everything here I have no problem paying it food is really good the lady at the counter is always sweet so if you want a quick bite for lunch great place to be"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic' I eat here like everyday, mostly because the food is lit. Lollll titty titty bang bang. Shoutout to Mei and Amanda for being the true cashiers."}
{"text":"I just paid $40 for 4 tacos, 2 carne asada burritos and what seemed like 2 teaspoons of rice and beans. The tacos are not good. Greasy and no meat in them!!! What a waste of money. I won't be back!"}
{"text":"Bonitas is the best!! Awesome food and great service!! Will definitely be back for more next time I'm in the area!!!"}
{"text":"Wow!  We really really enjoyed the Red Menudo and their $5 red or green Burrito special.  We will return and you should as well!"}
{"text":"Great place great food great service we visited this place yesterday and found it easy .The register person asked us if this was are first time and told us their specials which was fish Friday. Our food came out fast and was hot and smelled and tasted good we had a great time here ."}
{"text":"Bonitas is in the old burrito bandido spot across from asu west. it even looked like some of the menu items were still on it.  I have tried the big booty burrito, the loco pollo burrito, and the big booty breakfast burrito on seperate occasions.  All of them were just okay for me.  The burritos were big but not as big as others have depicted.  I easily ate them without feeling like I was on a man vs food episode.

The tortillas were store bought, the salsas were tiny and in need of spice and seasonings, and the meats could have used some marinade, and been more tender.

The price was on par with any fast food mexican joint.  Not a real value or expensive either.

I read they have menudo everyday of the week.  that is nice.

Wouldnt recommend based off what Ive tried so far."}
{"text":"Quality has changed and not for the better. Last 3 times the food and special requests have not been good. Bean and cheese burrito tasted like canned beans were used, red chili meat was tough, salsa tasted like it's been sitting in the tub behind counter for a week. I was a weekly customer not anymore."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Friday night.  Order at counter And food out quickly. Good sized portions and tasty substantial quality.  Got my money's worth."}
{"text":"I had the two soft tacos and a side of rice.  It was very good! The lady behind the counter was very nice and friendly.  Very clean and the inside was decorated very well.   I will be back!"}
{"text":"I didn't care for my meal but I feel pretty certain it was just a personal preference thing.  The ingredients were quality and I would give it another shot.  Service was friendly and fast."}
{"text":"Ok so let me start by saying the food in very good and to be honest I'm surprised, I figured it would just be another mexican food place that had...well... Mexican food! But at Bonitas they really know how to make it for sure! The only bad thing is they seem to be really slow...at any hour you go in... So be patient and wait and you'll love the food!!"}
{"text":"They have the best green chili burrito hands down. I used to go to Richard's for green chili burro but they closed down years ago. I was so sad because I never thought I would ever again be able to have such an amazing green chili burro. Bonitas have creeped into my heart and makes me very happy. Chili is always flavorful, not fatty or hot and the tortilla is always packed full. Try the green chili. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"After my last review they totally fixed the onions in the great burritos they make!! And their pozole is great for those mornings you need one!"}
{"text":"This place gets better and better every time I go here! Green chili burrito AMAZING! Do yourself a favor, next time you are craving Mexican food, give this place a try."}
{"text":"Seriously first problem right off the bat is the rude lady who works behind the counter. It's u fortunate. Dealt with her twice and will not return too bad to because the street tacos and salsa here are pretty good. My last order was chicken burritos enchilada style. Horrible flavor tasted like cigarette ashes were In there.  Something burnt and dirty. Probably from grumpy lady ;) lol.  It's a no go for us"}
{"text":"How hard is it to put a order in  right,WHAT PART OF NO BEAN DO YOU UNDERSTAND i didnt find out about this until i ready to eat do to it been a take out order if i could give no stars i will"}
{"text":"The food is ok, just ok, if you like lots of salsa with your Mexican food, then either bring your own or go across the parking lot to Taco Bell and grab some.
They'll give you about 1/2 ounce of salsa with each item, if you want more, you'll have to pay extra.
Anyway that's what we dealt with the first and last time we went there.
I've never had this happen at any other Mexican restaurant, I've always had plenty of salsa for my meal.
The salsa is not that good at Bonitos anyway, PULLANOS has way better salsa they are not chintzy with the salsa and better green burritos."}
{"text":"Love this place.   Been there a few times and have come away happy each time.  Big portions.    Great place if you are hungry for a solid Mexican lunch.  Had the Loco Pollo Chipotle yesterday; fantastic!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast burrito....and a good morning price too! When I'm back in PHX... I'll be dropping by for more good food! Cheers."}
{"text":"So good!! Me and my boyfriends favorite New Mexican spot! Friendly service and very clean! TACO TUESDAY!!"}
{"text":"I enjoy coming here, their food is great, the customer service is always awesome. You have different varieties and their orchata drink is delicious. Love how they had taco Tuesday and they are delicious"}
{"text":"We love the Carne Asada street tacos here.  Awesome flavor and great salsa as well.  The Churro was really yummy also.  We'll be back!!!"}
{"text":"After a disappointing start to lunch, I located this one.  Nice decor, clean.  Friendly cashier, maybe owner.  Nice selections.  Decent prices.  Good tasting horchata.   Clean bathroom.  Decent food, not spectacular, tasted more like Americans doing the food vs Mexicans.   I think I can cook it better and I'm not Latino neither.  Cold salsa, I prefer it lukewarm; chips were ok, nothing to brag about."}
{"text":"Get the Big Booty Burrito with all the meats. It's the biggest fucking burrito that I've ever seen. I ordered one last night and the girl up front told me it was going to be big. I had no idea it would be the size of a fuck'n chihuahua. They told me I was the first person they'd seen finish it. That shit was the bomb too. When I was eating it I felt like I was on Man vs. Food. After I ate it I bought a 400ml coke bottle to wash it all down. The people who worked there were pretty cool too and I can't really say that about very many places. I can't believe nobody ever told me about this place. I just got lucky finding it myself. They for sure have a new regular."}
{"text":"I'm Sorry But I Was Very Disappointed, I ordered flautas & there was barely any meat inside & they were burnt on the ends a quarter on each end. The beans taste like they are from a can & what was suppose to be guacamole was more like green salsa. 
My boyfriend had the pozole & that was good. 
Nephew had the Big Bootey Burrito, he was pleased.
Will I ever come back?? No!! I'd rather go down the street to Mixteca. 
P. S. 
$2.50 For a 32 Oz fountain drink, in a dive place like this?? I was raped!"}
{"text":"I probably wouldn't have been very happy with my visit here if it weren't for the really nice tattooed chick working the counter. She was pleasantly eager to see us and asked us if we had been here before. She helped my extra-picky boyfriend find something new to try, and didn't seem annoyed at all our strange requests. It was $27 for 2 sodas, a beef taco, chicken enchilada, pollo fundito, side of beans, and a side of rice. I thought this was a little pricey. The chips were fresh and warm, but the salsa came in those tiny filibertos cups (how do you dip a chip in those?) They do give you 3 mini salsa containers per order/person. They should really just buy bigger ones and give you one cup..or stop with the plastic waste and serve in reusable ramekins. The taco was great but very small compared to the several other mexican joints I frequent. The enchilada was pretty good. I wish the green sauce was spicier. My bf's pollo fundito was great, although I thought there was too much sauce on top. (Remember how picky we are? Preference..) I don't care for Spanish rice, so I didn't try it. My boyfriend ate all of it anyways. The beans were nothing to write home about..and usually the beans are my favorite part of the dish and never get left on the plate. They serve the food on real plates, so it was kind of confusing if we should leave them at the table or scrape them off in the trash and leave them on top. The place looked clean, and they serve reasonably priced booze. I believe the board said $1.50 Dos Equis and $3.00 margs during happy hour, which is pretty sweet. I think I would have given this place 4 stars if I didn't feel so cheated on the itty bitty salsas..or if I had an opportunity to try more than one of them. I feel like it lessened the value of this place. I am unsure if I would return. Maybe if I still lived on this corner, but I wouldn't travel to go here."}
{"text":"YUMMM ! DELICIOUS. Amazing tamales , red chili beef burrito , cheese crisp lite , fluffy & cooked to perfection. So excited this is a new little Gem in the neighborhood ! Enjoy"}
{"text":"Not bad

Bonitas came highly recommended and the food was okay. The tacos and green chili burritos were glavorful, as was the rice and beans, and I am usually extremely disappointed by the rice and beans in most Mexican restaurants. 

It was a busy afternoon and they might have been  understaffed, however, we received our meals quickly. Inspite of the slow service, I'd go again, the food makes up for it."}
{"text":"I stumbled across this place by complete accident. I couldn't have been more pleased. Their fish tacos are amazing. The prices are reasonable. It's in a convenient location (right around the corner from where I live) The lady at the front counter (not sure of her name) is alway pleasant. And you can't beat those $1.25 tacos on Tuesday and Friday. I recommend this place to anyone craving decently priced Mexican food from someone other than a Berto brother."}
{"text":"Delicious food nice Decore great cook highly recommend I don't know how I only got four stars"}
{"text":"Burnt churro! Very upsetting because they offer it FREE WITH PURCHASE WHEN YOU CHECK IN!!! The girl taking order and payment seemed so disinterested and not friendly at all. The food was extra cheesy, so if you like lots of cheese on your food then it's good, but the rice and beans were tasteless."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good food. This is my favorite fast food style Mexican place. Salsa is delicious."}
{"text":"Figured I'd give this place a try as I live very close and the reviews were high. A more or less mediocre experience. I ordered tamales sat down, was then informed that they were out of tamales so I exchanged that for a green enchilada. After a while, they tried giving me red enchiladas and asked if I'd take that instead. I'd already accommodated them once and I figured that was enough so then I had to wait longer for my correct order. Eventually I got what I ordered which included a bowl of pozole which, to my disappointment, was served with a lime so dehydrated, I could've gotten more juice out of the skin. However, I will say that the food was good if not remarkable and the portion sizes were very generous in relation to the prices. But, in the end, nothing really stood out about this place in a good way and I can't recommend coming here when Anaya's is just down the road. If you want really good Mexican, just take the extra 3 minute drive there."}
{"text":"Okay I've probably been to this place three or four times in the last month! I have to say the Green Chili Burrito here is frick'n awesome! It's usually their special for Wednesday's but I usually get it any day. It really filling and has spectacular flavor. 

The place is kind of small but in a way makes it seem really cool. I like their Guacamolé and Habanero sauces. Yum!!!

If your in the area and are craving some great Mexican food. You should check this place out! The lady at the register is really nice too! :)"}
{"text":"What a great little fast Mexican food place. I have been here several times and have not been disappointed.  They have good quality food at an affordable price. The service is fast and makes a great spot for lunch."}
{"text":"I love Pullanos and had high hope for Bonitas but have not been impressed. So far I've only enjoyed the crunchy tacos, quesadillas, and hot sauce. The breakfast burrito I got last week was terrible. The bacon was burnt and the potatoes were just mush."}
{"text":"I've tried this place twice and both times I've been disappointed. The first time I had green chili burrito and it looked like dog food and it tasted like it. I gave it another shot, maybe it was better to eat there then do take out. Disappointed again!! The girls up front were super nice and that's why I'm giving 2 stars. The red chili burrito was better but still gross, the meat was good but the flavor was non-existent. The chips were way too salty and you could taste the aluminum can the salsa came out of. I do NOT recommend this place to eat. What's sad, is I heard this place is owned by the same people that own Pullano's and I LOVE that place!! Maybe they should stick to the Italian food, it's what they do best."}
{"text":"My husband and I came in for some good Mexican food and we were not disappointed. He ordered the red chile beef enchiladas and I their red chile burrito. The portions were huge. Their prices are reasonable but depending on what you order can add up quickly. I also recommend their Nachos which are enough to feed three people easily."}
{"text":"Found this great little restaurant because of Groupon
Super casual with great Mexican food eat in with a huge take out following.  

Forget about the bert guys
Go for Bonita"}
{"text":"Pretty decent Mexican food. So so for the price. But I definitely like how friendly the staff always is and how fast they have the food ready."}
{"text":"This is by far the worse \"Mexican\" food place I've ever been too! The rice smelled and tasted like fried fish.  The pozole is so thick and greasy and absolutely flavorless!! The only thing half way decent is their tacos. Save your money and go elsewhere!"}
{"text":"Walk up to the counter, it's taco Tuesday. Girl behind the counter ignores me. She doesn't say a word!  I wait. She takes an order or to someone, passes me twice, not a word. After messing with some papers she asks for my order, not friendly at all. After I place the order, she turns to the pass through and coughs. She didn't cover her mouth at all and there were two plates of food sitting there. The tacos were shredded beef with deep fried shells. Not the worst thing I ever had but I won't be back."}
{"text":"It was bomb! The Chile relleno was finger licking good.  the salsa is fucking  spicy!!! Love it. Will recommend to everyone!!! Y'all gotta try it!!!!"}
{"text":"We hear about once a week, the burritos are amazing! The amount of chicken they put in the chicken salad is absolutely unreal, and their salsa is to die for! I highly highly recommend eating here, it is an amazing place!"}
{"text":"Big bad arse awesomeness. 

This group of people are always nice and the food is nomnom."}
{"text":"i love everything ive tasted at this place. the tamales are great and so is the menudo and tacos."}
{"text":"This place is excellent. Definitely the best Chalupa I've ever had and the staff is very friendly. I'm only here for a few days and already I've decided I will be returning to Bonitas within that time frame."}
{"text":"Service is always excellent and I've never had a problem with an order I've placed. Their breakfast burritos are amazing, as is their carne adovada burritos. Highly recommend to try this place!"}
{"text":"We LOVE Bonita's!! Owned by the same wonderful people who own Pullano's, Bonita's is turning into our new favorite place. It's honestly getting hard to choose between Pullano's and Bonita's... but Bonita's wins for those nights we need a quick, convenient meal.

First: the prices at Bonita's are phenomenal. We get a ton of food, plus a drink plus churros, and never walk out of there paying more than $25.

Second: Bonita's is not Taco Bell, nor is it Filiberto's. It is SO much better. Yes, it's fast-casual (meaning you can eat it there or take it to go, it's not a sit-down-and-get-served place), but everything seems to be made fresh and is definitely made to order.

There are way too many items I could recommend to you, but some of our favorites are the bean & cheese burrito, the tacos (any kind) and the CHURROS. I can't say enough about the churros - I've tried churros far and wide, in many different states, and Bonita's is seriously amazing. 

Let me repeat: If you don't order the cajeta churro, you are not truly experiencing Bonita's. I don't even care if you're allergic to caramel - try the cajeta churro!! If you don't like it, your tastebuds are officially dead.

So good. Go. You likely won't be disappointed... and you definitely won't be disappointed if you choose that cajeta churro!"}
{"text":"We were excited for Friday fish tacos but after a few month of not eating here we find out that the quality has really suffered! Took one bite and requested our money back. The tortillas were uncooked, the fish was cold and the cabbage was like cole slaw. It was pretty gross."}
{"text":"Thought we'd give this place a try last night, not what I was hoping for, but if your looking for tasteless food and salsa and something in the line of Filibertos etc you'll like this place. 25.29 for one taco, cheese enchilada, red chili burro with rice, chips and salsa and two drinks is WAY over priced and not much flavor at all. Could have went somewhere else for better and FREE chips and salsa for about the same price. Think the other people who have reviewed this place are a little bias since they do own Pullano's across the street. Here's a tip, stick to Italian food.

Added one more star for effort, my husband liked the red chili, meat was nice and tender, since he cant taste texture is his thing."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good. I dont know about giving it 5 stars though. Place was somewhat clean, bathroom looked a mess and dirty. Not much room for seating and is really crowded. The customer service was good, the lady greatly helped us with our questions. Food did take a little long to come out. They did serve take out orders faster than people sitting down. We had been there a good 30 minutes before we saw our food.
As far as food goes-
Big booty burro was a good start. To my surprise is was awesome. There wasnt much meat though... 4/5

Red or Green burro was alright, but again not much meat.. 3/5

Im not sure if i would come back as a regular. Maybe if i really wanted to eat and was in the area id stop by. Its a good place to try out if your looking for Mexican food. Also they serve breakfast which sounded good too, something to try!"}
{"text":"Delicious food!! Friendly Employees. Perfect if you are near Thunderbird Banner or ASU West."}
{"text":"Man, the Bonita's breakfast burrito is huge!  The Bonita's Big Booty Burrito must need apple bottom jeans! I enjoyed the heck out of my burrito.  The tortilla was soft and filled with eggs, bacon, cheese, potatoes and onions. For $5.55, this was a fantastic deal.  Especially since I will get two meals out of it.    

If you want fancy or absolutely authentic then this isn't the place for you.  If you want quick and tasty food at an affordable price then I suggest you try Bonita's. 

I believe it is owned by Mike Pullano, from Pullano's Pizza, a Glendale landmark! Just another reason to give it a whirl!"}
{"text":"As of writing this review, I have paid for two separate burritos and have eaten neither.  Both were take out orders the same night. First one was a tear in their bag and the burrito fell out into some water on the ground and became uneatable.  No sympathy, made to pay for the remake.  Fair enough.   Second one was cold as ice halfway through.  Evidentially they make no attempts to warm up anything out of the fridge, so anything like Pico and Guacamole are as such.  Still no sympathy, no offers of a free soft drink or anything to help ease the pain of wasting an hour and a half and $18 on food I didn't eat.  Instead I am looked at like I am crazy for expecting my cooked burrito to be hot.  I don't expect free food, but at least the offer of something to help would've been nice.  If you can manage to eat the food it sounds good, and at least they allowed me to switch out the last burrito for a burger at no extra cost (considering that the burger is cheaper too).  

Edit: having now eaten the burger and fries with it, it wasn't bad.  Was actually half decent.  But this is still one star, as for some reason they make a better burger joint than a Mexican place.   Might even go back for the burger, although in that market there are better places to go for cheaper."}
{"text":"Pretty sure this is the same place as 'burrito bandito' that used to be on 19th Ave and Union Hills... Until I ate a mini chimi. The menu is not correct, it's not meat and bandito cheese on the side, they put the bandito cheese on the inside and fry it all together which I thought was super nasty. Please update your menu accordingly... Husband had the 'big booty breakfast burrito' it was great, and the quesadilla. Younger girl at the counter was quite unpleasant and that's my biggest take away from my visit. Not sure I'll be back.

giving them more stars because the girl that worked here tonight 11/16/15 is so nice (ive had her now twice) and im obsessed with a shredded beef and cheese burrito from here.  SO GOOD, just dont love their mini chimis


Edit #3 
I'm getting extremely irritated that every f'ing time I come here my order is fucked up. I'm done and won't be back. Train your employees. How can the food taste different EVERY TIME when I order the same thing? 1/10/15"}
{"text":"Okay, so when you see a small Mexican joint in the corner of ho hum strip mall you immediately think \"Random\"bertos. Not at all. Good little spot. 

Baby banditos are great."}
{"text":"I should have walked across the parking lot and went Taco Bell. 2 chicken tacos almost $8 and it was all shell no chicken. What rip. Never again"}
{"text":"Highly recommend that you try Bonita's.  Friendly service, great food!! 
You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Good food I had a shredded beef burrito rice and beans.. My husband had a burrito and tocos he said they were good"}
{"text":"First time there. Great Green sauce! Nice people. Clean dining area. Good food and quick."}
{"text":"Excellent food, great service!

My wife and I were on the search for a good quick Mexican food place in north Phoenix. We looked up their reviews and were quite pleased with what we read so we decided to try it. Boy are we glad we did. The Enchiladas are awesome! I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"This was our first time. Being a Pullano's fan made me hopeful. Bonita's did not disappoint. The place was clean and nice. I would probably turn something else on the TV-( Soap operas are not my thing.) My husband had the carne Asada burrito with rice and beans. I had the taco salad with ground beef. The cheese was really good. Not synthetic cheese like most places. All Meat and no filler made both of these dishes delicious.  Chips were good. Had the habenero salsa-really good. Hot salsa was like a taco sauce.  We will definitely return!!"}
{"text":"Big Booty burrito was excellent. Carne asada was moist and tender. Tortillas were fresh. Fish taco was crisp and slaw on them was great."}
{"text":"Just ordered some food from Bonita's, a Carne Asada burrito and a cheese quesadilla and I got to say I couldn't of been happier the Carne Asada meat was tender seasoned perfectly and cooked to perfection!! The cheese quesadilla had the perfect amount of cheese and the perfect amount of Crispness to the tortilla and I cannot begin to tell you how good all their hot, mild,medium sauces are especially the habanero!! If you are looking for a great little local Mexican food restaurant I highly recommend Bonitas! In regards to the negative Carne Asada comment I am POSITIVE you're NOT talking about the same place BONITAS is tremendous!!! Can't wait to go back with the family!!!"}
{"text":"Today was my first time coming here after hearing so many great things about this place and WOW I have to say that it lived up to the hype. The young lady at the front had great customer service wasn't bothered by me not knowing what I wanted she even gave me samples as to what she recommends. All around great the food was beyond tasty, I recommend this place to anybody I was also going to post a few pictures of the food but there goes to show you how good the food is I fell in love with the first bite and didn't get to take no pictures."}
{"text":"I think that it should be noted first that this is more of a taqueria than it is a sit down restaurant. The service is great. Food was brought out to us and we were continually checked in on. As far as the food, it was just ok. The carne Asada did not taste fresh, the Tacos were very plane, and it all seemed like something I could easily whip up at home. I think that's it is safe to say that our experience was not worth the drive!"}
{"text":"OMG so good. Had the fish tacos, care asada tacos, baby bonitas, and flan. The flan omg the flan... so freaking good! Creamy and delicious. Every single item was perfect and the re-fried beans are wonderful!"}
{"text":"Literally and I mean literally just walked out just now because the girl behind the counter didn't take my order. Phone rang and she took 2 Togo orders instead of helping the person right in front of her. I used to come here on sundays for their breakfast burritos and it's been a while but now I will never return. Shame to because the food isn't bad but the customer service was horrid."}
{"text":"I'm a HUGE Mexican food fan and love menudo and this has everything I love! The menudo is a tad salty but the best I've had in town. I brought my family here and they all thoroughly enjoyed it, so much so, that my dad told me I needed to write a review immediately."}
{"text":"Food was ok. Steak burrito was very salty and churro was dry. Still tasted great. Service was amazing. I thought our cashier was very knowledgeable and helpful. She was incredibly friendly as well. I will probably go back there someday if I'm in the direct area."}
{"text":"Wow, The Best Bean Burrito with sour cream and melted cheese in it. I am hooked on them. Always get an extra to take home and watch late TV."}
{"text":"Had the carne asada. It was so dry it teleported me into the hottest desert imaginable. Walked about upset I spent money on it. Taste was ok"}
{"text":"Just so disappointing. Came in under the power of a Groupon for take out.  

Ordered mini chimis. Soggy. Sitting on a bed of slimy old iceberg lettuce. 

Ordered macho nachos, guacamole was brown.  Literally just scraped it out and threw it away.  

Ordered dulce chimi, soggy relatively unimaginative and tasteless with caramel sauce one one side of chimis with cream cheese on the other. 

The other reviews are really positive here,  but trying to reuse old guacamole and old lettuce along with the presence of a Groupon indicate doom maybe eminent.  

Today's performance only helps.  I won't be back soon."}
{"text":"I love the carne asda Fries, best smaller run shop around. My friend visiting from California loved this place"}
