{"text":"Amazing food!  Devoured half my ceviche tostada before my daughter even got her food."}
{"text":"Just came in for the shrimp cocktail and it was delicious. The location is clean and the staff is very attentive. Glad their is a location like this in Henderson /whitney ranch aree because robertos does not compare. I did notice the prices for the mariscos are higher than nearby locations and portions smaller but I figured it must be due to the location. But if you don't want to drive so far and live in the Henderson area I do recommend this place."}
{"text":"That hit the spot!  While we were visiting Las Vegas we had a craving for some good Mexican food and were not disappointed. This place is worth the trip away from the Strip for sure. I would definitely come here again.  Our party had the shrimp tacos, cheese enchiladas, chile relleno, carnitas tacos, and shrimp cocktail and we liked it all!  Prices are more than reasonable, and they cook with soybean and canola oils which made it very easy to eat here with a peanut allergic person in our party.  The staff and management are very friendly and welcoming as well."}
{"text":"A little miscue on the online ordering but they more than made up for it, serving chips and salsa while we waited for our takeaway.  It only took about 15 minutes for our made to order tacos, burritos, and guacamole.  Everything was excellent, the guacamole obviously made from scratch and the burritos each a meal by itself.  The chorizo and the al pastor tacos were perfect. The only downside was we ordered way too much!  They have table service as well, so next time we will dine in.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Food was great! Wonderful service.  Live Mariachi! It's nice to have an authentic Mexican restaurant in the area."}
{"text":"Absolutely AMAZING!!! Authentic and flavorful!  They had a special on tacos, buy one get one!  We ordered the chicken, pork and steak tacos. The tacos were soft and seemed like they were made in house. The tacos were topped generously with meat, onions and plenty of fresh coriander. They were accompanied by various hot sauces. Definetly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed a delicious lunch. We ordered the meat molcahete (may be misspelled). The sauce is so tasty. It was served with fresh corn tortillas. Great food and service."}
{"text":"Una excelente comida y lo mas importante muy buen saz√≥n y calidad un trato amable pocas veses encuentras lugares como este limpio y muy agradable lo recomiendo al 100%"}
{"text":"My hubby and I went to eat there tonight and it was amazing! I had the Birria de Rez and my hubby had carnitas burrito and both were great and so tasty. The portions were great and the prices were not that bad! Ramon the (owner we think) was great and made some great suggestions for us to try. Everything was clean and fresh. We got great customer service! We're definitely coming back."}
{"text":"So, my friend and I walked in at 8:58, not realizing they closed at 9.. They still served us, gave us a free horchata (which was delicious!) because we were gonna be the last customers of the night. My friend asked what the man behind the register recommended and he was super friendly and suggested the fish tacos and the chile verde burrito. We ended up getting both and the man gave us two sides of each salsa and explained how he liked to mix them, etc. 
We took the food to go and ended up eating it about 20 minutes later and it was still delicious. Amazing customer service and amazing food! Definitely recommend and we'll definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"This is now my favorite Mexican food place. everything was amazing but the fish tacos are to die for."}
{"text":"Do not eat here! Absolutely horrible. Tried the carne asada...so bad. The small portion of meat was tough, grizzly, and had zero flavor. The worse part of this place is the stupid music blaring while you are trying to eat...so annoying. Not good, much better places to eat!"}
{"text":"Warm customer service every time I come in pick up or dine in. Great prices for the fresh quality ingredients!!! Highly recommend the Shrimp ceviche"}
{"text":"Thank you Yelp for this great find! Everything was very fresh, flavorful, and overall delightful. The chips came out with a complimentary bean and chorizo dip and a few different salsas.  We had camarones rancheros and a lengua taco plate.  The shrimp came in a delicious tomato sauce I ate by the spoonful, a good serving of said beans and chorizo, rice, and fresh veggies with avocado slices.  I got some guacamole on top of my tacos (for .50-- why not!?), which was zesty and had a very interesting (slightly sweet) flavor. The tongue was some of the better I've had.  The service was great and we were lucky these guys were open on New Year's Eve!"}
{"text":"Awesome place! Great service and amazing food, I got there early right when they opened and by the time I was finished with my meal the place was busy! 
I really loved it and I will be back. The lady server was great! I didn't ask her name"}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for dinner... And I must say this is by far the best seafood I've ever had!"}
{"text":"Oh my gosh, the el pastor tacos were so good! Multiple flavors coming together to make one of the best tacos ive ever had. Loved the chips and salsa to snack on while i waited for my food. Staff was very friendly. But the food is why you should go."}
{"text":"Great food and even better customer service!!! Love this place and the atmosphere. You won't regret eating here."}
{"text":"First time in to try it out I seen the reviews and it didn't disappoint I had the carne Asada tacos and must say the best I had in a very long time I will always come back."}
{"text":"This place was perfect. Food was delicious and service was great. Taco shop setup but don't let that fool you. The owner and staff were very pleasant and took the time to explain all the dishes we inquired about. You have to see the amazing dishes that were being served all around us. I cannot remember the name of the meat dish I tried, but oh man the sauce that the beef, chicken and chorizo are cooked in was amazing. We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"From the beginning with the chips and beans you know this place will be good. They definitely didn't disappoint."}
{"text":"I am impressed with the food here! I had a burrito and a taco, it tasted very authentic, and delicious. The tortilla they use is great. I would include a photo, but I ate it too quickly. Like the others said, I will not go anywhere else for my Mexican appetite."}
{"text":"These are the best mariscos in Vegas! They are fresh and we can't get enough. I'm not usually one that is reviewing often, but when I do it's usually because it was OUTSTANDING! If I could give them ten stars I would."}
{"text":"We love it here! Service is very attentive, they aim to please. The food is delicious!  We devoured our oysters in seconds! 

The complimentary beans (with chorizo), salsa, and chips are delicious! 

Their michilada (Mexican red beer) beers are very refreshing! 

Our ceviche tostadas are fresh and filling. 

This is our go to spot :) :)"}
{"text":"This place is a wonderful local taco place. The food is very fresh and cooked to order. The staff are very friendly and engage with the customer to make a nice family friendly dinner environment. Definitely some of the best tacos in Vegas!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for healthy, delicious Mexican fare at a (somewhat) reasonable price, this is it. Meats were juicy and the ceviche was fresh and excellently seasoned.  Service is top-notch."}
{"text":"Wow!!! This place is the real deal. From the chips & salsa it already blew us away.

We ordered the seafood ceviche (delicious), seafood molcejete (mind blowing)

Ramon great server you can see he loves his job & wants to show off the food. 

Delicious so delicious I will write to Guy Fierri for his good eats.

Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I only tried the green burrito, which was done very fast. It was humongous and a bit much for one meal...at least for me. I just found it OK because I've had better. It had rice, beans and shredded meat. I like the burrito that have some chunks of meat. The service was good and the cashier was very friendly."}
{"text":"First timer here, the service was excellent,  and the food was very fresh, me and my wife ordered the shrimp cocktail, i was expecting cut up shrimp, but it was full size shrimp. Me and my wife are definitely coming back here."}
{"text":"First time ever eating here and both my boyfriend and I were really impressed! Complimentary chips with some delicious bean mix, and super really yummy salsa! We both ordered the 2 taco combo plates, he got carne asada, I got carnitas. Both cooked perfectly and seasoned well! Service was great and very pleasant with a very authentic feel. I would definitely recommend to others and eat here again!"}
{"text":"This place is so great.. Great atmosphere, good location, great food, and table service. The Carne Asada Burrito's are the best!  My sister's favorite were the Taco's. You can have a sit down meal, or take it  to go.. Prices are very reasonable.  I won't go anywhere else."}
{"text":"Close to home and always on point with the flavor. Their meats aren't as greasy as most places and their portions are well balanced. Their rice is good with just about anything if you take some home."}
{"text":"Food was really great! Carne Asada and Carnitas Tacos were super yummy. Servers were friendly and took good care of us."}
{"text":"Definitely will be back! My boyfriend and I love seafood spots like this! I heard about this place from a really good friend that lives in the Henderson area. We live the exact opposite in North Las Vegas. But if there's good food we don't ever mind making the drive. There was a friendly greeting right off the bat as we walked in the door. We sat and the gentleman was super nice and gave us menus and was ready to take our drink orders. We love Micheladas! So we always have to try it if it's available! Their Micheladas are definitely a must! It's very tasty, refreshing and made perfectly! The waitress we had was just as nice and had good recommendations. We got the fresh prepared oysters, aguachiles and a side of rice! Everything was fresh and super good! The rice even had a great flavor to it! This place is a definite must if you love Mexican seafood!! And a plus is that they even have karaoke nights!"}
{"text":"Shaved Oysters and a bucket of beers. Awesome lunch. Server was super nice & attentive. There's a vegetarian section on the menu. Definitely gonna go back :)"}
{"text":"Great service with excellent food. Best Mexican food I ever had. If you like Mexican food, you must try this place."}
{"text":"This place gives you so much food. My friend and I could have actually shared a plate but he got chick enchiladas and I got shrimp. Food was nicely seasoned. Salsa was overly hot and it was more of a pick de gallo. Delicious. Only thing was the chips tasted stale. We would come again. You can sit down or order out. It was clean, bathroom was clean. Good people"}
{"text":"I've been dining here for about a year now and I can't give enough positive feedback on this place. The food is absolutely delicious and the service is friendly and helpful! I've gotten the pleasure to meet the owner and he's so polite and always remembers me every time I stop by. The carne Asada burrito is my favorite with lean meat, Mexican rice and a house made tortilla! The tres leches cheesecake is also a must have!!"}
{"text":"This review is solely based on service. I came here to this restaurant with my father around 11:15am and we got seated pretty quickly then our server (a red headed woman, we didn't get her name) took our drink and food order because we had already waited 15 minutes before anyone even came to our table. So from 11:30am to 12:10pm we still had no drinks, no one came to check up on us or tell us how much longer we would be waiting for our food. At this point after waiting over 40 minutes my father got irritated and we walked out. I understand locations get busy and all but this restaurant wasn't busy and we still get better service at restaurants that seem 10x busier."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!! I ordered the shrimp cocktail paired with a michelada. Sooo good! The service was also great, I will be back soon!!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The service was so good. They made you feel like you where at home. The tacos are so so good."}
{"text":"This is our go to spot! At one point in time we were eating here three times a week! We have cut eating out to once a week, and I feel this is our once a week outing. Everything here is delicious!"}
{"text":"We just went for our first time tonight. It's Cinco de Mayo and they have a mariachi guy. Super fun atmosphere, with buckets of beer flowing! We had some street tacos, shrimp tacos and a carne asada burrito. Really great food on all accounts. We are excited to have such a legit place so close by!"}
{"text":"Cute little spot, food was good, chips and guacamole where on point.  Service was excellent, and they had a live band when we went.  I recommend the street tacos for a starting point."}
{"text":"The menudo and tacos were very good. The menudo was very flavorful and the meat on the carne asada tacos was fresh and very tasty. The salsa is also very good."}
{"text":"Been here several times and have always had a wonderful experience.  Food is fresh and made to order. The guy running the show is kind and professional. This place is clean you can tell by the way it smells when you walk in and when you sit down there's never a sticky surface. They have a great selection and their prices match the quality."}
{"text":"Delicious! I ordered the AL pastor burrito and it was soooooooo good. I've never had al pastor before but it's my friend's favorite so I tried it. It has pineapple in it but it wasn't too sweet. The burrito came with three different salsas. A green one that kind of tasted like a mix of a salsa Verde and guacamole; very good. Next was a darker red salsa. Mild, but very good flavor. Last was a light orange salsa. That definitely had a good kick but it wasn't so spicy you couldn't eat.

Will definitely order again. And again. And again."}
{"text":"Great service unfortunately the food tastes below average,portions are small for what you pay for ,I order the shrimp cocktail, cocktail tasted plain and not much flavor also not much shrimp and octopus it was mainly.tomato flavored water and that's it ,save your money and go somewhere else I have been here twice and both times food was below average the 2stars are mainly for the service but what good is that if the food is overpriced and not good"}
{"text":"They are usually pretty busy on Tuesdays, so be ready to wait more than usually for your food to be ready, however the food is delicious, one of the best tacos I've ever had."}
{"text":"I have been here several times and every visit has been awesome. Great service, it's a family business and they truly care about their customers, and the food has 100% true mexican flavor. If you want awesome service , mouthwatering food at an awesome price I would recommend you give them a try. This is a hidden Gem you will be glad you discovered It as we are."}
{"text":"Food is on point! The aguachiles is amazing!! The carne asada is flavored so perfectly!! It's a bit of drive to get there for me but so worth it!! I'll definitely keep going and explore more of the menu!!"}
{"text":"So this is the second time I've dined here and decided to bring my mom, 2 sisters and bf along. It didn't disappoint!! My mom is pretty picky on her Mexican food and she ate everything off her plate!! My bf loved his fish tacos so much that he ordered 2 more after his first three. Our server Christian was absolutely amazing!! He is so kind! You can just tell that he has a true passion in what he does! Our family can be a little difficult in their diets and Christians was able to accommodate all of us. My sister fell in love with the veggie tacos!! We all had something different on the menu and it was all so delicious!! But honestly Christian did make the experience so much better!!! We will definitely be back!! This restaurant is bound to make it not just because of the food but because of the awesome people that work there!! My only tip is that I hope they get more tables and seats because once the word gets out I'm in trouble."}
{"text":"Food was good at this hard to find place!! Very authentic and great staff. Clean too!!"}
{"text":"Bought the Agua chiles. It sucked! Container was empty they only gave me 8 shrimps for 20 bucks!! Fucking rip off. Never again. Service was horrible as well."}
{"text":"I moved over to this side of town in August, far from my normal Mexican restaurant so I suggested to my significant other that we try it, we loved it!

We decided to try the guacamole and omg, amazing.

Check it out, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Best Mexican food!!! Simply
 Amazing en gusto se rompe genero, y la verdad yo recommend altamente Este lugar"}
{"text":"I love this place! Their food is so authentic and made with love. They also have a man who sings on friday nights I think and he has an amazing voice. I will be coming back."}
{"text":"Cute little local spot with amazing customer service and great food! They give you chips, salsa a d bean dip to start off. We ordered the Green chicken enchiladas, Chile rellenos , tacos, burrito and the Ceviche in Chipitin sauce. All were very good, the most standout dish was the Ceviche. So fresh!! The enchiladas were also really good, grilled and marinated chicken that was nice n juicy"}
{"text":"Had shrimp ceviche and two tacos. The shrimp ceviche tostada was fresh and packed. The tacos (shrimp and fish) had lettuce on top, the fish and shrimp were cut up, and were fried. Not your most authentic. The horchata however was on point and the service was excellent! The service alone brings a 3 to a 4."}
{"text":"Our second trip, yet again to this amazing restaurant! This time we decided to try some different things on the menu, as shown. We had the shrimp cocktail, carnitas tacos, and Molcajete ( with substituted octopus in place of the normal chorizo). The food just keeps on getting better and better! Not one complaint from us! If you still don't believe me, please go try it yourself. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"We come from San Diego,  and we can defenetly say this place was amazing.  Food was on point , and their orchata is delicious.  The beans with chorizo are really good too . Our server was super nice and attentive.  Thank you for the amazing service rego."}
{"text":"I have been to Tacos Y Mariscos before and loved it from the jump. I've been hesitant to write a review mainly because I am selfish and like this place as if it were my own. Keep it near and dear to my fat heart  but I cannot do it a disservice any longer. If you live in Vegas and want to try authentic Mexican seafood look no further!!! If you are traveling to Vegas and want to experience a fine establishment, gamble on it. I can't boast enough about the service as it is impeccable. They greet you as soon as you walk in, music blaring of Mexican polka aka Banda Music. The menu is simple, two sided filled with seafoody goodness. You cannot go wrong with this place as it also has tacos!!! That's the equivalent to having and ice cream sandwich made of bacon. The decor is something from a Frida Kahlo dream, colorful, vibrant and heart warming. If you do stop by, you must have the fish ceviche tostada. Just $4 for each one but two will satisfy your taste buds! Tacos here are off the hook and of course.....beer!!! Wow, if I ever decide to get married this is the place I will come to do it. Hell, if I ever get divorced again I'm coming here with the quickness!!!"}
{"text":"I was greeted instantly upon my arrival. All of the staff was incredibly friendly and that's not the best part. The food.... was incredible . The last time I had an authentic alambre this delicious, I was in Mexico City. I will definitely be returning for taco Tuesday every week."}
{"text":"Perfect Monday night football ! With this Large Shrimp & Pulpo cocktail with a side of corn tostadas!so delicious and such a HUGE portion for 16.99. I will definitely be back soon! Excellent and quick customer service too."}
{"text":"Overall, pretty impressed, and very glad it is so close to me. We came in here for dinner one night and ordered some food to go. The two young ladies at the front desk were very friendly and asked us to have a seat while we waited and told us they would bring out some chips and their homemade refried bean dip. The bean dip was great, and it was very nice of them to offer this to people who were ordering food to go.

The inside was clean (of course it was, the place is brand new), and decorated with bright colors. The only real complaint about the environment was that the music when we walked in was REALLY loud. It was mariachi music and spanish pop music. One odd Flogging Molly song snuck in for some reason, and that turned up way too loud in a Mexican restaurant was a little weird of an experience...

We ordered a few tacos and a burrito. When our food was brought to us they said \"here are your two tacos and burritos.\" I ordered three tacos, checked the receipt and realized I was only rang up for two. I said \"it was probably my fault, don't worry about it, two tacos are fine.\" The young man who brought me my food said \"oh no no no, let us treat you\" and less than 2 minutes later a third taco came out and I wasn't charged for it. Major customer service points there!

Prices are also pretty reasonable here too. About 2.50 per taco and the burrito was 7 bucks. We will definitely be back to try the other entree options!"}
{"text":"Loved this place! Carina met us as we entered and made us feel immediately welcome. Everything we ordered  (pork burrito, shrimp & chicken tacos, quesadillas) was delicious, including the homemade juices. Yummy food, great service."}
{"text":"Went into order tacos, but our server mentioned how good the molcajete mixto was! Just had to order it, and it was delicious. Tangy, spicy, flavorful, red sauce with all the meat and seafood was excellent. It came to the table boiling and sizzling and was cook perfectly. The carne asada and homemade chorizo was the best!"}
{"text":"Just ate there while waiting for my meeting to start the food was fresh it was absolutely amazing had to eat inside the car because the kids would go crazy and the meeting was going to be soon. the owner Ramon  actually came out and greeted us and told us more about the food and offered us water. amazing Place, good food, awesome!"}
{"text":"Everything was good, I really liked the chorizo beans and the rice was nice and fluffy :)

The shrimp cocktail was so fresh and delicious you get a lot of shrimp in the serving too, loved that :) !! Had to Bring left overs Home of the shrimp cocktail. 
 
Chips, were fresh salsa was amazing we asked for 2 orders and couldn't get enough!"}
{"text":"The Horchata is the best I've tasted in a long time!!! The food is amazing, the staff are amazing"}
{"text":"Food was awful. They don't list that their burritos are loaded with beans. My pastor burrito was 80% beans, it was disgusting. The guy complained about the commission he was paying to eat24 when I went to pick up. If you don't want their advertising then stop using them. The food is the worst I've had in years. My disappointment is overwhelming."}
{"text":"I ordered the torta and it was pretty damn good. The complimentary chips, salsa and beans were a great plus!"}
{"text":"Best street tacos in the Henderson area"}
{"text":"This has to be one of the best authentic Mexican restaurants in Henderson/Las Vegas. The food is fresh and the quality of the food is really good. It is my first time here with a co-worker and I am happy with, not only the food, but the service! Check this place out!"}
{"text":"My friend brought me here for my birthday. They have some delicious shrimp cocktails (Mexican style). I really enjoyed the fish tacos ... again, delicious!!! 
The service is great and the food is authentic.  I'll definitely be back!!'"}
{"text":"The most disgusting burritos we have had in a long time. We ordered two al pastor burritos with red sauce and sour cream guacamole and cheese on the side. The cheese that came on the side tasted funny. The guacamole was horrible. The al pastor pork was diced and burnt in a lot of places which made a lot of pieces crunchy and some of it tasted old. I'm surprised I didn't get sick off of the couple of bites that I had before I pushed the plate away because it was that foul. Don't let these pretend reviews fool you. SKIP THIS PLACE."}
{"text":"Wow!! Such good food ! I had the shrimp cocktail and my boo over there had a torta de asada. The food was sooooo perfect ! The flavors were on point and he service is GREAT. Super nice and friendly cozy restaurant great music nice vibes. I would recommend this place to anybody looking for some good ol homey Mexican food at a decent price ! So many Mexican restaurants are over priced but it's not too bad here. Loved the shrimp cocktail !!"}
{"text":"A hole in the wall Mexican joint that has very good food.  It's small so don't expect linen table cloths and silver place settings.  Chile Caliente has a great selection entrees but focuses on marriscos and street style tacos.   The seafood cocktail is awesome. My wife had carnitas tacos and they were very good. Great selection of beer including michelladas. The food is about as close as you get to the places you find in Rosarita or Tijuana - definitely will be back."}
{"text":"This is one of the best Mexican food restaurant in Henderson. Great seafood and everything else. They have space for large groups and booths. I highly recommend it to all my friends."}
{"text":"Been here about a half dozen times now, the food is always great with great service. Nice place to go with family and friends."}
{"text":"The food was unforgettable and fast. Such a relief to have a break from the high priced food of Las Vegas too! Sad to have found it on the way to the airport heading back to Pittsburgh. Would recommend this to anyone!!"}
{"text":"Excellent fresh Mexican food. The service was friendly and prompt. I can't wait to return to try out more of their specialty dishes.
Location in my neighborhood makes this such a bonus. Easy to access right off Whitney Ranch Road off of Russell.  
Give this place a try I am sure you will be suprised."}
{"text":"I ordered the food for delivery and got the Caldo de Camaron y Pulpo soup... I must say its one of the best in town! I see a lot of the reviews on here are based on the customer service, I didn't have to deal with any of that since it was a delivery order but the food is GREAT especially for the Henderson area. I will try to dine in and update this review based on the customer service I receive."}
{"text":"Excellent authentic tasting street tacos, that don't skimp on properly seasoned good quality meat. (Try the Al Pastor)
Overall, one the best sit down Hispanic food places in Henderson."}
{"text":"BEST Mexican food on this side of town. I love how friendly they are and how authentic the food is. I have referred 5 people to the restaurant and every single one of them loved it! My husband and I go to the restaurant at least once a week."}
{"text":"I grew up eating homemade Mexican food, so if i find a place that is that serves Mexican food and i like it, that's says a lot. Their food is soooo good! I always get tacos al pastor and a tostada de ceviche shrimp. It's so delicious! I also, always get a michelada and boy, don't get me started on how yummy that is!! I also end it all with dessert, their chocoflan. It's a perfect way to end my meal. I've never had a bad experience there. It's a hidden gem. Food is amazing and the service is just as good! They are always friendly and attentive! I think I found our new food spot!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I came here for the first time. Food was amazing! I had the carne asada tacos and chicken. Flavor was great. Rice and beans tasted good too. Loved their salsas. We will definitely be coming back soon. The staff was also very nice even while they were busy."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in all the Henderson/Vegas Valley. Home made food & great service. The portions are huge & the prices are a steal. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Excellent food!! Really really good flavor and exceptional service the owner personally came to the table waitress was very friendly and provided great service. I will definitely be going back would highly recommend."}
{"text":"This place is exceptional. The food is fresh prepared to order and while they certainly have some delicious and indulgent choices, they also have beautiful salads with house made dressing. 
We tried a few different things, grilled shrimp salad, chicken tacos, chorizo tacos, and a carnitas burrito. Everything was top notch, including the complimentary homemade bean/chorizo dip and the salsas that were brought out with our meals. The food and the menu left absolutely nothing to be desired. 
The service also sets them apart. They were attentive and considerate and brought our salad out with both dressing options on the side, aware that we hadn't been there before. 
The topper was the excellent selection of Mexican beer, not just Corona. 
This is not only my new favorite Mexican restaurant, it's my new favorite restaurant in the Las Vegas valley."}
{"text":"So far I think this is going to be my new spot for Mexican food. I ordered the alambre, which was perfect. They use al pastor. They also have a yellow habanero salsa which is actually spicy. Just make sure you ask for it!"}
{"text":"Once again my Yelp family has led me to an amazing culinary experience!  This strip mall located gem had amazing Mexican food. The menu is weighted heavier towards seafood dishes which I loved!  We tried the shrimp empanadas and slicked them right up. The Rudy's Special and shrimp enchiladas were completely enchanting.  While it has a higher price point than most Mexican eateries, the quality and portion sizes over the top."}
{"text":"This little hidden secret in the the middle of the neighborhood we were advice of we always drove by and never knew it's a full size restaurant it's our second time around and it's the second time we eaten oysters and they are the freshest this place will be one our favorites in our list that we can count in one hand in Las Vegas price are very reasonable and the food is very fresh and service is excellent we highly recommended it."}
{"text":"They start with chips, tasty chorizo and bean dip complimented by chips and salsa. All the salsa's are delicious and range in heat. I had a chorizo burrito, which was amazing!!! The flour tortilla is homemade...trust that you can taste the difference! The burrito came with rice, beans, chorizo, cilantro and onion. I would recommend this to anyone looking for really good Mexican food. I will be coming back to this five star worthy spot for sure!!!"}
{"text":"One day I was craving ceviche and stumbled upon this place. It didn't disappoint.

For one, I can't believe how reasonable their prices are. Their portions are also generous, and everyone is incredibly friendly. The staff is always checking in with you and asking you if there is anything else you need.

To start, you get free chips with homemade salsa and bean dip. It's pretty delicious. 

As for what to order, my go to is the shrimp ceviche combo. They are generous with the avocado, and the ceviche is of very high quality. My husband loves the carne asada burrito, and likes that they bring it cut in half as it's easier to eat. 

Their horchata is also one of the best I've ever had. 

You really can't go wrong here. You are sure to enjoy whatever you buy. 

I will definitely be coming back every time I'm craving authentic Mexican food!"}
{"text":"I have tried three different meals here and am excites to try more. The food is excellent, it's a great atmosphere and the staff treats you like you are a guest in their home."}
{"text":"SUCH great food.. been here three times and the food is always so well prepared and so full of flavor! Came at 11 on a Sunday and they made chilaquiles (even though they're not on the menu). Soooo delicious! The coffee was amazing too. The service is always great, and they are so attentive and nice. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy the shrimp ceviche tostada, and the al pastor tacos and carne asada tacos everything was good I will definitely be back to try other things I left super stuffed lol"}
{"text":"Great place with authentic Mexican food.  Food is fresh and served quickly.  Had the chicken enchiladas with green sauce plus rice and beans... delicious.  Must come and check out, you won't be disappointed .  Added bonus great music."}
{"text":"I highly recommend this place.  It's hard to find authentic Mexican food on this side of town.  The food was delicious, the restaurant was immaculately clean and the service was top notch.  I have to come back with my sisters so we can share some oysters and ceviche."}
{"text":"This place is deeelicious!!!  Great and quick service.  Food was so flavorful. Our waiter was so kind and on top of all the tables making sure everyone was satisfied.  Definitely coming back"}
{"text":"I can't believe I've lived so close to this place and never stopped by. After my first visit, a couple of months ago, it has become somewhat of a tradition for my family and I to come by on Sunday's. You must have their michelada and the aguachile. Their tacos are pretty delicious too! The staff is welcoming and very friendly. The prices are comparable to that of \"Lindo Michoac√°n \" - however the quality of food is much better (more home made)."}
{"text":"New place in town and will definitely give other Mexican places a run for their money. I was greeted as soon as I walked through the door. My wife had tacos alpastor and they actually put pineapple on them. Only place in Las Vegas that I know does that is Tacos El Gordo so that should say something about the authenticity of the food. Will be back for sure not just for my self but to buy lunch for my employees at the hotel."}
{"text":"Five stars is not enough.  Everything from the bean dip with chips at the beginning to every last bite of our meals was delicious and full of flavor.  We found this after a tennis tournament at Whitey recreation center just by chance and returned the second night because it was so good.  Staff was fantastic, they remembered us and one gentleman came over on the second visit and asked for any criticism or suggestions.  Haven't had that happen in any recent restaurant visit and we do eat out quite frequently. Will return again no doubt!"}
{"text":"The absolute best carnitas tacos anywhere in the world. Authentic and low key, this place has amazing Mexican food at super affordable prices. I came her at least once a week because it off the hook delicious!"}
{"text":"I love this place. It's like my private little secret spot to eat. Ramon and his crew are awesome. Great customer service and great food. 5 star establishment in my experience. A must try out for all of you restaurant go'ers out there."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! The food is amazing, shrimp tacos and asada tacos are perfect but my favorite so far is the molcajete de Mariscos. Tons of fish and shrimp with the most unique and delicious sauce. Combine that with nopales, grilled onions, Chiles, queso fresco and homemade corn tortillas...sooo delicious! They have awesome beer specials (michelada was great) and our server, who I think was the owner, was just amazing. We also had a tres leches cheesecake that was delicious. I can't wait to go back. Definitely try this restaurant, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"The fish ceviche tostada is very tasty and comes with avocado. The shrimp tacos were right on point and the sauce is dreamy and flavorful. The fish taco wasn't as good as the shrimp band I don't think I'd get t again."}
{"text":"Friendly waitress and good food! Plus, they have Taco Tuesdays- 99cents for carne asada, chicken, or homemade chorizo. Happy to have finally found a good Taco Tuesday spot! I recommend this spot, especially since those I bring here definitely enjoy the food! If you're looking for dessert, my friends and I enjoyed there homemade tres leches cheesecake :) . Now, stop reading and just go check them out! This place is my go-to and one of the best Mexican spots in the Henderson area hands down!"}
{"text":"I'm so glad I came across this place. I've placed 2 orders via yelp, the food was ready promptly. Customer service was excellent, and the food was better than I expected. Great portions. Will continue to order from this restaurant."}
{"text":"From the moment you walk in you feel welcomed.. the food was amazing one of the best tasting carne asada burritos ever.. the meat was delicious.. everything was greater than expected.. definitely will be coming back more often!"}
{"text":"Just happened to find this little hole in the wall place..This was great Food and the price was cheap! Service was really friendly too."}
{"text":"Amazing food.  The Shrimp cocktail is amazing!  And the Chili Relleno was huge and good - only thing I would recommend is that the chili be precooked before stuffing and baking to bring to table.  Tacos were nice and big with wonderful taste........  small place with good food and Ramon is so friendly........  we loved it and will go back again."}
{"text":"Great food and amazing service. Everyone is so friendly. The ceviche is amazing and the molcajetes are great. We've been here 4 times already and will keep coming back. The food reminds us of home and we love it."}
{"text":"My new favorite taco place! 100% authentic! Music-food the workers. Love this place:)"}
{"text":"My wife and i were looking for a Mariscos restaurant not to far from the house and somewhere that had good Michelada's but we didnt feel like driving to North Las Vegas ( hood ) so this place popped up and we said lets give it a try. We were glad we did, its in a nice location, great food ( fresh seafood ), good Michelada's, great service. We will definitely be back, this is our new spot that has been added to our list"}
{"text":"Delish authentic Mexican food!! The owners are so nice and welcoming! Amazing fish tacos, shrimp ceviche, al pastor and carne asada tacos! We loved it all! We will be back"}
{"text":"Now this was some excellent food. 

We have driven by this place quite a few times, and could no longer resist trying it out after all of the fabulous reviews. SO happy that we did. 

The Shrimp Ceviche tostada was so fresh. You really get a lot on this tostada. Our al Pastor wet burrito was flavorful. The meat was perfectly done. We split an horchata as well, it was was icy cold and also full of flavor. 

The service here is impeccable. You can tell they take pride in their food and their service. It really shows."}
{"text":"The best fresh Mexican food in Las Vegas. 
The service is wonderful. 
Food is made fresh to order.
Check them out."}
{"text":"On a recent trip to Las Vegas we ate here twice. It was that good. Clean, bright, great service, affordable, varietal menu and the best corn tortillas I ever had. The beans and chorizo were a nice alternative to salsa and chips. Try it for yourself!"}
{"text":"I ate here with my girlfriend and we both loved it. The food was delicious. She had carne asada tacos and tacos el pastor (I think), and I had the carnitas burrito. Their carnitas is probably the best I've had in any restaurant so far. I find some places don't use enough salt. There was a singer there which is a big part of why we actually stayed. We were going to order to go but the music reminded her of Mexico so I told her we should just eat in the restaurant. It was worth it. The server guy was
 really cool and always there to check up on us.
My only complaint is that it was kind of warm inside, but I'm naturally always hot. My girlfriend said she was fine, so it was probably me. I don't think they had the a/c on.

All in all, great place to get authentic Mexican food at a good price and only a few minutes from my house. Will definitely go back again!"}
{"text":"We found Chile Caliente by googling it and because of the reviews we decided to go to this restaurant to taste the food and consider them for our last minute catering service. Upon meeting with Christian we were impressed with his professionalism and willing to work within our budget and time frame. We intended to order and pay for samples of their food but instead they brought us out samples of the food that we were interested in ordering for our event, and did not charge us.. The food was very good and fresh, I can't rave about it enough. They have the best homemade corn tortillas and guacamole.! You can tell they take pride in what they serve to their customers.
  Catering: Christian arrived ahead of time to set up all of the food (and sides) AND all of the plates, napkins, utensils (including serving utensils), and disposable chafing dishes. It looked so professional and everyone loved the food. We will definitely be using this restaurant again.!
Thank you Christian and Ramon.!"}
{"text":"Fast fast fast service. I ordered the shrimp ceviche. tWO! They were huge. They have this crazy oyster plate. Six. They put a mixto ceviche on top(octopus,fish,shrimp). Holy moly. 

Also they Have SOY AL Pastor tacos!!! Not bad. Dress it up with sour cream, onions and hot sauce. 

Good price off the strip, but then go over to the Mexican ice cream spot next door. That made the drive and whole experience extra special."}
{"text":"Apparently until this place, I've been eating oysters completely wrong. We ordered the Ostiones Rasurados al Estilo Chile Caliente, and it was absurdly fantastic. I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Service is outstanding! They gave out flowers to all mothers on Mother's Day. Food is so tasty and service is quick and friendly. We are definitely coming back for taco Tuesday!"}
{"text":"Best place for tacos in Vegas hands down!  If you want authentic Mexican food definitely come here and all the ingredients are fresh definitely becoming a regular. The service is also great"}
{"text":"Super delicious chilaquiles, chorizo and egg tacos and pancake dessert! Their cafe de olla was to die for! Super clean establishment and server was sweet, kind and super attentive! Will be back whenever were in town. Gracias por la comida deliciosa y el buen servicio!"}
{"text":"Great authentic Mexican food with a great seafood menu.  I was pleasantly surprised with the portions of the Carne Asada tacos. Lots of meat bursting with flavor. I got the 2 for 1 taco special and was extremely satiated with my four tacos. I'm a really big guy so hat means a lot. I had a really tasty Michelada beer as well."}
{"text":"Since living nearby I decided to stop by to try the food. Since moving to Las Vegas from NorCal I have been looking for my go to Mexican restaurant.  This place is good. The food is somewhat tasty but the price is a bit high for my liking. It may be the location that makes the prices higher but I if i'm spending a pretty penny on the food then I better be getting a good amount of meat in my burrito. Salsas are good, burrito is ok but needs more flavor and meat. I do wish they had a salsa bar with chips, radishes, pickled carrots and jalape√±os and an self serve soda machine with unlimited drinks. (Kinda like El Pollo Loco) Overall, the place has authentic Mexican tasting food which I appreciate."}
{"text":"This place is a gem!! Close to the house!!  Brings me back to my childhood days with the music they play on the jukebox.   You can't beat the prices on the bucket of beers!!!  The food  is Authentic and the fish is fresh!!! Loved the oysters too!!!  Salsa was yummy!!!  The owner was super nice and personally came by to make sure we were taken care of!!!   The only flaw was there retried beans with chorizo.   I hope that's not a family recipe, didn't want to tell ya, but no one liked it in our family .  We all love the traditional refried beans.   I think that's the only hindrance.   Please  make that an option as we love our beans!!!"}
{"text":"I won't be going anywhere else for tacos ever again in the Las Vegas/Henderson area. Today was our 2nd time eating here. First time we got food Togo. It was fantastic. 
Today we walked into the establishment around 1:20 PM and there was a decent amount of people but we were greeted immediately by Lolis. She took great care of us. Anticipated all of our needs. She rocked the restaurant we were very impressed. 
The food was fantastic as always and we are going to be coming back as long as we live here."}
{"text":"Great place to eat ! Food was very good and delicious . Customer service was outstanding . Molcajete was very authentic and full of flavor . They also have live music on the weekend ! Perfect hidden Gem ."}
{"text":"If you love traditional Mexican food you must try this place. Fantastic menu with a variety of seafood choices, the ceviche and chorizo tacos were on point. The Molcajete is amazing looking, we didn't try it this time but the table next to us did and WOW is all I can say, next time for sure."}
{"text":"Great place to eat, nice environment very friendly staff! Bathroom clean. Food was great!"}
{"text":"The food is phenomenal, the owner is personable. Makes us feel like familia every time we come in. I recommend this place to everyone I know. Everything on the menu is a good choice."}
{"text":"Over priced and wasn't tasty.  I tried to order a Vuelve a la vida Cocktail only for them to tell me it would be a $25 plate (something you can get at Mariscos Vallarta for $12.95).  I ordered 3 tacos, a burrito (which hardly had any meat you are better off getting a burrito at Felipitos or Robertos), and a cocktail(which didn't taste good at all). Don't even get me started on the 30 minute wait for my food. If you want good tacos go to Tacos el Compita(about 5mins away from this place). If you want amazing seafood go to Mariscos Vallarta (which is also about 5mins away).  Steer clear of this place!"}
{"text":"We just moved to Henderson and have been scoping out new places. This is not a real big place, but the food more than makes up for it. The staff is amazing. Nice as can be, very helpful and keeps it SO clean in there! In fact, the whole time we were eating, one of the girls was cleaning the chairs in the dining room. You just never see that.
The food portions were huge. And taste... It was simply delicious. 
They brought out homemade salsas and bean dip with chips, and I could've just eaten that. All of the sauces were amazing on our food. We had enchiladas and tacos and quesadillas. Everything had great flavor.
The only issue we had was that our food was not that hot. Our cheeses weren't even melted in our enchiladas, and that really bothers me. I like my food hot. 
Otherwise this is a great place to eat. I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Food was gross. Servers were rude. I'd never recommend. We went for taco Tuesday and saw they had tons of good reviews. Were very disappointed."}
{"text":"The BEST GUACAMOLE I have EVER had!!!!

This was my second visit to Chile Caliente, once for lunch and once for dinner.  Anxious to try the Huevos Rancheros for breakfast -- haven't found decent HR in the Las Vegas Valley yet (in 20 years) but am cautiously optimistic that Chile Caliente's will be great.

The chorizo is much like we found in Panama; i.e., not greasy.  The chips are salty and good; and served with bean dip and at least one salsa, maybe two, maybe three.  I think they serve gringos the mild salsa unless you request the medium or hot.

Prices are VERY reasonable and service is excellent.  Nice selection of beer.  They also have wine, but don't have a liquor license so you can't order Margaritas.

Family-oriented; easy parking; easy to get to; extensive menu and authentic Mexican food.  And, literally, the best guacamole I've ever had -- and a very large serving, as well.

Chile Caliente Tacos  Y Mariscos has replaced Lindo Michoacan as my favorite Mexican restaurant.  The prices are lower by far.  In my opinion, this is the best Mexican restaurant in the Las Vegas Valley."}
{"text":"OK when I went to this place it's not Tuesday so I was off on my taco Tuesday craving. I ordered shrimp tacos and rice. I thought it was a little bit pricey for my meal cost me about 15 bucks but whatever the food was good. I also dine in,
So I was able to get free chips and salsa. My food was really good, service was excellent , place looks clean so I think I will be back when they have their taco Tuesday special."}
{"text":"I could eat this everyday , found this little gem through yelp while looking for a lunch spot. Yum yum yum the mocajete was big enough for 2 but since it was our first time here we also tried the shrimp ceviche tacos it was so much food and so delicious we ate it all .  I'm already planning to try the shrimp diabla the next time we visit . The prices are anywhere from 3-30 so up to you what you want to spend , everything I had was good, I'll for sure be back."}
{"text":"Wow. I'm not a big fan of  Mexican food, so I wasn't overly thrilled about coming. The waiter brought us the guacamole and said it was the best in the world.... he wasn't wrong. Absolutely amazing! I don't eat tortillas and they were truly phenomenal. The green burrito was fantastic and the staff were wonderfully kind and sweet. A pleasure and a terrific meal. Highly, highly recommend it!!!"}
{"text":"Living in New England, I'm definitely starved of authentic quality Mexican food. We drove out to Henderson just for this place and it was well worth it.

TOSTADA MIXTA: Lots and lots of seafood on top consisting shrimp, fish, octopus. Slightly light on the flavor so feel free to top off with some spicy sauce.

SHRIMP COCKTAIL: Plenty of shrimp served in cocktail sauce, in a glass. Shrimp was very good and got that fresh crunchy texture to them. 

MICHELADAS: I've never had this drink before! The shrimp stock part sounded a little strange, but it was an excellent and refreshing beverage. Think blood mary but less thick (given beer).

Overall, excellent and cheap Mexican seafood. While I've had better in Mexico, this one was pretty close!"}
{"text":"Just when I thought they couldn't get better...they now serve BREAKFAST!!   If you want a satisfying home cooked breakfast then come here. Great people, amazing food, and a pleasant atmosphere.  Perfect start to our day!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious, the service exceptional!! I believe the owner (or chef) came to our table to make sure we were enjoying our meal and suggested a specialty to try for next time. 
Their tortilla are homemade and so tasty!!
Next time I'll try their Aguachilles (raw shrimps marinating in lemon juice), now that I know they make everything fresh!! Great service + great food, this is going to be my new spot!! I recommend this place 100%!"}
{"text":"As everyone else has said, this place is the real deal. They are not messing around - some seriously on-point Mexican food. Add to that that the service is steller and ultra friendly. My new go-to place for Mexican in Green Valley."}
{"text":"Ordered toastada de camar√≥n a grilled nopale, and a shrimp salad. It was fantastic! Super fresh and when you walk in it doesn't smelly fishy like some other establishments. Ordered fresh guacamole as an appetizer as well it needed a little salt but that's an easy fix! We will be back!"}
{"text":"The fish is so fresh here!!! And the customer service is amazing. I love the fish ceviche, best I've ever had. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"I found this place when I was travelling east on Sunset and wanted to bypass the traffic on Stephanie and at the mall. So I turned left on Whitney Ranch. You'll find this family owned restaurant just south of the Whitney Ranch and Russell intersection. I've come for two lunches and had two enjoyable experiences.

I chose to have table service for my lunches, but you can also order take out from the counter. While reviewing the menu, you'll get an order of chips and refried beans . The first page of the menu has your classic tacos and burritos. But turning the page, you'll find a nice selection of seafood entrees served as tostadas, cold seafood, and hot entrees. This is where my focus was as I've had the camarones a la diabla, camerones rancheros, shrimp ceviche tostada, and fish ceviche tostada. I thought the two takes on ceviche were excellent, generous amounts of seafood marinated in lime juice served on a crispy tortilla with nice chunks of avocado to cut through the acidity. My server suggested that I have the ceviche with their spicy salsa and that was the perfect bolster of heat.

The sauce with the camarones a la diabla definitely brought the heat but it wasn't too much handle. I had the cheesecake for dessert on one visit and thought it was just OK. I'll have to try the tacos and burritos on another visit. But Tuesdays would be the best day to come for the tacos as on Taco Tuesdays, tacos are $1 all day.

Service was slow one of the days, but the owner/manager stopped by multiple times to make sure I was fine. Pricing is fair in my book with the entrees on the second page being a little bit more pricey. I'm planning my next trip on a Tuesday to have some tacos."}
{"text":"Amazinnggg!! This pace is amazing! Today we got the guacamole and chips, carne Asada nachos (not on menu) and aguachiles. Everything was soooooooo delicious! I came in on Tuesday and got 10 street tacos for $10. Tuesday's are $.99 tacos! Sooo yummy! Please come check out this hidden gem! My boyfriend is from Sonora Mexico, and he is now hooked! Very authentic and homemade! Fresh and great quality! Seafood is to die for too!!"}
{"text":"Been on a taco tour of Henderson, and this is one of the best places so far. Awesome customer service, greeted right as we walked in the door. Tasty tacos and delicious beans. Will be back for sure!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, great Micheladas, also service was on point. Will be back. Also tried the oysters too very fresh. Don't have anything bad to say about this place."}
{"text":"Can't believe I have not rated this place yet. It is awesome! I honestly don't like the spot where it is located very much but it is not really a reason to decrease any stars. It is very authentic and food is very good. We have been here with the kids too - very family friendly and staff is helpful and we never got a nasty look because of ... kids... hahaha

We found the place randomly (were going to the ice cream shop next door and got hungry before dessert) and since we have been there a few times. I kind of consider it my favorite Mexican in town."}
{"text":"Wow! This place is incredible. We came for dinner on Mexican Independence Day and we had a great time. They have a karaoke singer on Fridays and Saturdays. The music is a little loud, but it definitely adds to the ambiance. The restaurant is very clean and reasonably priced. The staff is very friendly and speak fluent English.

The Carne Asada tacos are very flavorful and are not greasy like at many taco shops. The meat is lean and tasty!  But let's be serious, the real reason to come here is for the seafood!

The oysters on the half shell were extremely fresh and are reason enough to come here. They are medium sized, plump oysters with a very clean taste. They are served with limes and a variety of hot sauces.

We also tried the tostada mixta which was a very generous portion for $10. I was expecting a a single tostada, but I received a plate of seafood with two tostada shells. The seafood was a mix of cooked shrimp, ceviche shrimp, octopus, and fish. The flavors were amazing!

The micheladas are also amazing here. They serve them in a large glass that is fit for a king!

The only issue we had was with our restaurant.com certificate that the manager would not accept. He claimed that restaurant.com fraudulently issued the certificates without his approval. I find this to be suspicious and poor customer service, but we still enjoyed our meal. We will still come back and bring my parents."}
{"text":"Another great place! This one is on my side of town so a bonus! Good Ceviche and everyone else had good things to say about their tacos and burritos!!"}
{"text":"Great service 
Food was delicious 
Great atmosphere 
Friendly staff 
99 cent chicken & chorizo tacos
Very clean

Highly recommend the seafood 
Ceviche fish & shrimp, shrimp cocktails"}
{"text":"Oh my gosh, I think I've just discovered a gold mine and can't wait to eat my way through the rest of their menu. Had the machaca plate and was one of the best I've ever had! The guacamole was chunky and authentic. Refried beans the perfect consistency. GREAT place!"}
{"text":"Excellent food!! nothing else I could say about this place , I order about 3 times a week from here my favorite are the Carne Asada tacos, fish ceviche , the guacamole is soooooo good , can't complain about the desert either , so freaking tasty :) gotta love the delivery service also."}
{"text":"Real deal- lots of seafood choices.  OMG so good.  I'm not gonna go on and on.  Not much else to say at this level.  I hope they don't get tired of me.  LOL"}
{"text":"By far the best asada fries I have ever had. This place is fantastic! Service is great and the owner is a very nice guy!"}
