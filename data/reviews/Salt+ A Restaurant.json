{"text":"So happy a relatively upscale replaced that nasty bar around the corner. Unique food options, wonderful atmosphere. Drinks are a little pricy, but that's it's only downside. I will continue to be a patron of theirs."}
{"text":"Pretentious, Sexist, and not really good.  Came in for a birthday meal.  Service was good.  Kitchen was slow.  Wine menu is sexist claiming 'even men can do ok'.  Attempted to order some calamari, specifically asked for it without sauce on it as my child has an allergy.  Told to 'F' off.  Never again."}
{"text":"To start, I absolutely love the atmosphere!  So well decorated and such a cozy vibe! The staff is super friendly and knowledgeable about the wines and dishes! The wine list is unique in a great way and the wine suggestions have been on point every time. The new menu is the best yet! The Steak skewers over the melted blue cheese onion is one of my favorite bites ever!!"}
{"text":"Great new place, must try, sweet potato croquettes so good, also must have white bean puree, smoked beets,  and curried cauliflower so much I wanted try and share, we had a great time. Very nice place"}
{"text":"Would have given this 1 star but raised to 2 based on 2 visits to this restaurant. And the space is beautiful!  First time when  it had just opened. Around 7 pm. The wine list wasn't printed yet but the hostess went to the basement and brought several bottles for our selection. She was informative and helpful. The small plates were really good and the place felt warm and welcoming. That visit would rank 4 stars and we gladly paid the higher than average prices.  Returned Wednesday of this week around 5:30. The hostess had a horrible hacking cough and could hardly speak. Oh my. There is no happy hour and the server laughed when I inquired. Our small plates were terrible! The cheese was almost frozen and had no flavor of the citrus marinade. The accompanying bread was cold and almost stale. The smoked trout was suspect, way too fishy even for smoked trout. We also ordered the white bean puree, which was ok but sported maybe a teaspoon of olives on top. When I asked if we could have veggies instead of bread, I was told in no uncertain terms that no subs can be made. Since the server had just gone to great lengths to explain the glazed carrot special, I found it odd that a couple couldn't be spared to accompany the bean dip. But regardless, her no-nonsense snippiness was unnecessary.   The place was almost empty the whole time we lingered over our wine and tried to pick at the food. Not sure what happened since opening, but definitely a down hill slide. Pretension and exceptionally high prices for lousy appetizers will not play well at this establishment."}
{"text":"I always have such a wonderful experience at Salt!!!The ambiance is great and decor appears to be SO thought out. Usually I will sit at the bar because I love the actual feel of it and that way I can try new bar snacks. :)  I love that they change their menu up with what's in season, but my staple every time is the white bean purée. All I need is that and one of their magnificent vegetable small plates and I'm good to go.   The serving staff and bartenders are incredibly knowledgeable and friendly. Always a great reflection of a well run establishment!!  You must check out Salt!"}
{"text":"Great place for tapas tasting. The calamari was fantastic. Many vegetarian options too. Interesting comfortable decor. Fast service. Pricey for amount on small plates."}
{"text":"A must try restaurant! Better than I expected. Good staff, unusual but great menu, freshest of food and even serves late. I will go back soon. A great place to stop after an evening at the Beck Center."}
{"text":"Yum!! We love this place!! The calamari is nothing short of amazing! The service was also fantastic! Great date night place!"}
{"text":"We tried the curried Cauliflower with chopped figs, the sweet potato croquettes the manchego cheese, a pork dish and some calamari. Everything was wonderful! Calamari was very lightly panfried and served with a wonderful coconut-based sauce flavored with coriander it. For dessert I had grilled angel food cake with lemon curd and strawberry. It was wonderful to be able to sample small plates of a variety of items and not be overly full. There was a chocolate dessert I can't remember the name of that was amazing as well. We enjoyed a nice bottle of Rioja wine with our dinner. The atmosphere is very cool. Natural brick on one wall, finished wood floors, comfy, roomy booths and tables. The service was attentive and friendly. I will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Girls night out, dinner for 8! My friends and I do a dinner club each month and Salt+ was the restaurant for November, while some of us were a little leary because of the fancy names on the menu, we were ALL in agreement that this place was amazing! Dan, our server, was fantastic - had great drink and food recommendations. The small plate concept allowed us to try a variety of the menu - we had the special cauliflower, calamari, duck, lamb, sweet potatoes, burrata, roasted beets, mushroom tapenade, white bean puree, and the short ribs...we were happy and full when we left! The Gloria seemed to be the favorite drink of the table - very tasty! For anyone hesitant to try because of the menu - just do it, trust me. The staff is very helpful in explaining each dish! Note: Dinner for 8, we split the food and had separate drink checks- pleasantly surprised with the price too! :)"}
{"text":"Amazing food. Great atmosphere. Try it you won't be disappointed. This was my 2nd visit. Loved it the 1st time and wanted to make sure it really was as great as I thought before I wrote a review. Besides a great excuse to go for the 2nd visit. My new favorite!!"}
{"text":"First time visiting - Delish small plates - tried a bunch of different options - all were Yum!  Will definitely try again"}
{"text":"I'm a sucker for small plates- it really is the best way to try lots of new dishes! So due to a whole menu of small plates- two thumbs up. We ordered 5 items: smoked walleye (daily special- very tasty!), short ribs with avocado and grapefruit salad (wonderful- our favorite dish!), calamari (interesting and very good), asparagus, and Brussels sprouts. We were very underwhelmed by the vegetables- definitely generic and something I could whip up at home. The proteins were incredible- and very unique. Will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"My friend and I stumbled across this place for brunch.  The food was delicious!  The coffee is fantastic and their signature brunch drink was also great!  If you are thinking about trying this place definitely do.  I can't wait to try dinner there."}
{"text":"Salt is an excellent edition to the Lakewood neighborhood. It is a contemporary take on reasonably priced small plates with an extensive wine list. Feels elevated without feeling stuffy. This is in part due to the genuinely warm hospitality with each visit. The octopus is a big hit."}
{"text":"Go here. Do it.  A friend and I came for happy hour after having this place on our \"to do\" list forever. We got the chicken liver pate, white bean hummus, and the calamari and I honestly couldn't tell you what was better. It was all SO good. The cocktails were also delicious and spot on with the holiday herbal/spicy flavors.   I can't wait to find a reason to come back...it's OK to go twice in 10 days, right?"}
{"text":"Visited Salt because the chef is a James Beard award semi finalist. While small plates dining is still relatively newer in the Cleveland food scene, which sets Salt apart, the actual dishes do leave more to be desired. I had the cauliflower, scallops, duck leg confit, and lamb tenderloin.   The cauliflower was almost like a cauliflower three ways dish but really ended up being cauliflower two ways because the brown butter cauliflower was more of an afterthought on the plate. The charred cauliflower tasted like it sat out for too long while waiting to be ordered off the menu and plated - missing the texture. The scallops were overcooked and I had a hard time finding the pickles chilies even though I was expecting that to be a more nuanced flavor. The \"confit potatoes\" were really more like home fries, too much bite and not enough tenderness. The duck leg confit was probably the dish that best met expectations. It was tender as confit should be. However, the fat was not fully rendered and rather salty. The pickled onions can also benefit from more flavor profiles - for the current version, they screamed just acidity!  Perhaps the most disappointing was the lamb tenderloin. The tenderloin had a thick ring of well-done meat with a sliver of medium-bordering-on-medium-well. Instead of a minty punch, I got a greasy companion from the bok choy. The pairing has potential but flavor ratios and techniques need to be reimagined. For now, the ingredients taste more dissonant than harmonious.   I hate giving this establishment three stars and wanted to like it. The ideas are there but execution has room for more work. I suppose the good thing is that this place changes menus every 10 weeks to provide a natural way to select for successful dishes. Even so I would have appreciated better curation and more attention to details."}
{"text":"Yummy food. Definitely a place to order a few different things and sharing is a must! Great service. Awesome atmosphere. Will go back. Met the owner, super friendly. A great addition to Lakewood!"}
{"text":"Such good food! Went here for brunch. Got the cinnamon roll french toast and spare ribs with sweet potato hash. So delicious. We weren't full so we tried the smoked beets and white bean purée. Equally amazing. Great decor and great service make it a wonderful addition to our Lakewood neighborhood. Can't wait to come back again."}
{"text":"Salt+'s intimate yet eclectic feel has made it one of my favorite late night date spots. This establishment is a great through and through.  Great food, great drinks, great atmosphere, great people.  We love to stop in late night and sit at the bar sipping on their delectable well-crafted cocktails and share a small plate or two. Their staff are always friendly and bar staff are always will to provide recommendations.  Our first visit we tried their garlic shrimp and duck special, which we enjoyed sharing, but secretly wishing we didn't have to because they were both so tasty. I have had the opportunity to try a few other small plates on occasion and have yet to be disappointed by any item on their menu.  Their small plate concept makes this a great place for sharing with friends but keep in mind the small plate doesn't necessarily come with a smaller price tag. You can expect to pay $9-13 per plate."}
{"text":"Contrary to their window sign, they now open at 11am on Sundays. So, still haven't eaten here yet. So ignore the star rating. I'll update when I've actually been there."}
{"text":"Great food, service, and burbon cocktails. The dates, in particular, were amazing.  The short rib was wonderfully flavored, but a tad dry.  Price point appropriate for food quality. Very cool ambiance."}
{"text":"Service was outstanding and friendly.  Scallops cooked perfectly along with seasoning.  This place is very clean also.  I would stay away from any vegetable entree except the scallops.  You are basically getting a tapas salad.  Bartender was a bit gruff.  Drinks were a bit off."}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't reviewed this place yet! It's my favorite restaurant other than Astoria cafe.   Their calamari is delicious!! One of the best in Cleveland!! Cioppino is very flavorful and full of shrimp and mussels!! The quiche is superb and I can't even tell you how delicious the white bean purée is!!! Its a must have whenever I go! The lamb meatballs are really good especially with the charred red pepper!  Trust me people, if you live in or are visiting Cleveland you HAVE to try this!! I almost cried one Tuesday when I was craving it and realized it was closed!"}
{"text":"Went to Salt for the first time last night. Service was great and the food was on point. We had a number of good dishes including the pork belly, short rib, and the fritters. They really did a great job of cleaning up the old Pug Mahones and turning it into an interesting tapas restaurant. We will definitely be back and hope to try some different bites next time!"}
{"text":"The foods are really good. Environment is perfect for after long stress day and relax with some food and drinks. Love the environment."}
{"text":"Came with the Wife last night after eagerly anticipating this place for some months now.  I was a little surprised to see some of the middling reviews and almost didn't make the drive.  I'm glad that I did.  Salt was a tasty restaurant that was worth a little bit of a splurge for us.    So, this is a small plates type place, don't expect monster sized portions.  We ordered the white bean/olive toast which was umami'licious.  And a great value.  The calamari was different than most calamari that I've tasted.  Lightly dusted with some flour or cornstarch mixture which was slightly crisp and tender as well.  Not a huge portion for the price but really delicious, especially with the sauce.  Loved the duck confit- perfectly cooked with a tasty side of a root hash.  Probably the only miss for me was the short rib candied jalapeño.  It was only ok and the portion of ribs was small.    Our waitress was friendly and she did a great job of fixing our wobbly table.  Total came out to $61 with tip for 4 food items and some hard cider which was potent and delicious.  We were hoping the owner would stop by- she did at some other tables, but no biggie.  Enjoyed the food and experience anyways. We'll be back."}
{"text":"We can here with another couple because we wanted to try a new restaurant outside Downtown and Tremont.  We were really disappointed, food was mediocre, we ordered mussels, lamb, pate, broccoli, and a few other plates, I can't remember. The best thing was the calamari. The worse thing was the cocktails. We have never had someone not know how to make old fashions, and I think I tried the Evelyn drink, it had too much simple syrup and was over sweetened with no flavor. The drinks came out very slow even though one of my gf's was just ordering red wine. The waitress was very pleasant, they ended us giving us a round of drinks and dessert, but we won't be back. I really wanted this Tapas place to be great. Please try not to over season everything and hire bartenders that actually know how to make drinks. We actually would like food to actually taste like the actual food not the seasoning."}
{"text":"Came here with friends for a leisurely and social dinner ... great service, Dan was top-notch, friendly, funny, and completely on top of the menu.  He recommended we order rounds of dishes like we'd order rounds of drinks, which is what we did, keeping the dishes in the middle of the table so we could all try every dish.  I was a little hesitant at first, because a number of the dishes we're outside my comfort zone, but I intended to be adventurous, and I tried every dish that was ordered, and I'm glad I did.  Amazing food, with some really interesting flavor combinations!  The braised octopus was quite good, and I'll definitely be getting that one again.  The duck leg confit was also quite good, and the smoked sturgeon dish was terrific ... and now I want more.  All in all we had a great experience.  The food was awesome, the drinks were good, dessert was decadent, and we were allowed to take as much time as we wanted, which was perfect for catching up with old friends.  The sleekly-designed interior is a HUGE upgrade over the dumpy dive bar that used to be in this space, and overall, Salt is a great addition to Lakewood!"}
{"text":"Wow. Going to a restaurant that specializes in small plates means you are tasting multiple dishes, which increases the odds of being served a \"miss,\" as opposed to a regular dinner where you're just trying one appetizer and one main course. But the five plates we had on Saturday night were all \"hits.\" All. Of. Them.  Every protein (from octopus to short rib) was perfectly cooked and seasoned as was every garnish (from beans to diced sweet potatoes and other root vegetable).  We started out with the mushroom tapenade ($11) and I was going to let Jeannene have most of it, but I ended up eating my share of it after tasting how the chef added salsa verde and goat cheese to the dish, which gave it an unexpected lightness as opposed to the usual earthy, umami flavor of mushrooms. Next came one of that night's specials, blackened shrimp polenta ($13). The shrimp was coated in black pepper (as one expects when it's \"blackened\")  but the polenta with small beans mixed in balanced it out perfectly.  Next was the braised octopus ($9). This was the softest octopus we've ever had, it was almost like eating a scallop, and again the chef added bold, contrasting flavors -- salty olives and tart grapefruit wedges -- and they perfectly complimented the overall dish. After that it was too heavier plates -- Duck leg confit ($12) and Short ribs ($11). The meats were literally falling off the bones while the root vegetable found the sweet spot between being mush and having too much bite.  The drinks we had with the meals were also very good, especially the \"Elenor\" ($11), a bourbon drink which tasted like fall/winter thanks to the all spice dram, smoked tea simple syrup and lemon and peach bitters. The one disappointment of the night was my other cocktail -- the \"Concepcion\" ($11). I'm not a big fan of mezcal but I was curious to see how it tasted with orange marmalade and egg white. But they might as well just serve it straight up because all I could taste was the unabashed smokiness from the mezcal.  Another high point was the service. You need a good wait staff to help you pace yourself through the myriad of small plate options and they did a great job."}
{"text":"Enjoyed eating here the other night with a large group of people (13).  We had one server and she nailed it: friendly, funny, knew the food and drink, and timely with everything.  I got the short ribs with kimchi and smoked sweet potatoes.  Not only was it delicious, it was the perfect size for me and priced great.  Since I was with a large group I also got to sample some of what others ordered.  The white bean puree was fantastic!  Even knowing this is a tapas place some of the dishes were small compared to others; the dates and beet salad.  And the consensus was that the desserts need a little work to match the level of dinner food.  I will return for the shorts ribs and the white bean puree."}
{"text":"The greatest part of my month is when I have dinner at Salt. Oh man what a night! Highly highly highly recommend! You will NOT be let down! That's a promise and believe me, you'll be glad you went!"}
{"text":"Hands down this is the best dining experience that I have ever encountered. Salt is a gem in the Cleveland area. I have very few restaurants that I am confident in recommending anything on the menu. The food is absolutely amazing, the drinks are superb, the chef is an angel, and the staff is incredible.  If you have a date with a significant other or even just want to impress someone, go to salt, get 3 to 4 plates to share between you and have an incredible time. It is a life changing experience. Anytime someone asks me about where I like to eat, it makes the top of my list. If you have not been to salt then you are missing out on the best food Cleveland has to offer."}
{"text":"Great interior, not busy for Sunday brunch, which is nice. Staff was semi-attentive, but ended up fighting with us about their menu. In case you're curious, the sandwich and the scramble do contain egg, even though not listed on the menu, but don't expect your waitress to tell you that even after ordering a two-egg side for $6 (the price of 2-dozen eggs). Our waitress did this, then insisted we were wrong, was quite dismissive of us, then returned 10 minutes later to inform us she double checked and we were right and only then was she willing to fix the issue. Great customer service   Sandwich was $11, not worth it. Mostly hard bread, very little toppings, wasn't asked about the egg (as mentioned before) or I would've preferred not to have it sunny side up...a huge issue for me.  Friend got a scramble with squash and feta for $8, and they put no feta on it...probably the only reason for it to be $8.  I'm not sure how their dinner is, but I definitely would skip this place.  UPDATE: They charged me more than I had put down, including tip! I don't know if this was the waitress or what, but seriously...AVOID. I'll be checking to see if they did the same with my friends."}
{"text":"Heard and read many good thing about Salt and wanted to see if they Truely Rock as their name implies. Cool looking bar and dining area that is both tasteful and comfortable at the same time. We were seated right away and our waitress had waters and menus out quickly. After making our drink selection wine for my better half and the Murray off the cocktail menus for yours truly we began to consider the small plate menu.  We opted for the following small plates that included a trout with bread and bacon jam, stuffed portabella mushroom, a surprisingly tasty acorn squash dish, a crab cake and a Pork Belly dish. Our waitress brought each dish out separately, allowing us to enjoy the plate, while staging the next item timely to not feel rushed. Each plate as a winner stand alone and viewed as a complete tasting menu. Salt + A Restaurant was a happy find that we will go back to when craving multiple small plates."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place. First, my cocktail was delicious. I had the Gloria cocktail with fig vodka, ginger beer, rosemary and port. It was served with crushed ice and was like a snow cone. It's my new favorite drink!  We tried almost everything on the protein side of the menu with our group of four. The scallops or the octopus had to be my favorite, but it is so hard to choose. The meats were delicious too, but I just feel like the seafood was so expertly prepared and paired with flavors that made it outshine everything else (olives and octopus/ slightly smokey root veg purée (carrot?) and scallops).  We didn't have as many side dishes but I remember they were bright and fresh. Honesty, I kinda forget what we ordered besides the green beans bc the egg was delicious and I love turnips (you don't see them on the menu often!).   I follow the restaurant on instagram and they always seem to have something that they are adding to the menu for a special. My next visit is gonna be to try brunch!  Just be prepared that the dishes are pretty small but easily set up for sharing. I think they suggest ordering 2-3 per person but as perpetually hungry person, I would lean more towards 3-4 per person."}
{"text":"I went to Salt for brunch this morning and I cannot wait to return! This was my first time there and it was out of this world. The parking was easy, they have a lot behind restaurant so that was super convenient. The decor was so cool. The brunch special adult beverages were amazing. I had a blackberry/vodka drink and it was one of the best cocktails I ever had. Then finally the food....some of the most delicious dishes I have ever tasted. I love the tapas concept because our group ordered a bunch of meals and we all shared! Overall, this place surpassed my expectations. Now I have to come back for dinner!"}
{"text":"It's beautiful, it's wonderful. It's the epicurean equivalent of a young Martha Stewart taking your virginity."}
{"text":"When you come to Salt+, you can be assured of two things - (1) Fresh, unique and flavorful small plates perfect for sharing, paired with posh cocktails served in a cooler-than-you'll-ever-be space & (2) A bigass bill.  Salt+ is a New American bistro slightly off the beaten path of Lakewood's more heavily trafficked dining scene (this is a good thing) that has managed to carve out a bit of a niche for itself as a hip, classy little joint that serves tapas-style small plates and froofroo cocktails all expertly prepared and about as fresh and \"in-house\" as you're likely to find anywhere. We wandered in on a random Thursday looking for something different and, lucky for us, we found it. Around 6pm, not much of a crowd and we were shown to our table immediately.  Park around back on on the street somewhere and don't worry about being towed or having to pay $10. That's definitely worth the \"+\" in their name. The dining area is really well decorated and beautifully laid out. Exposed brick columns accented by slate blue walls lead into the front bar area with high tops for mingling while the main dining area features both traditional tables settings and a row of high-backed banquettes along the far wall. Helping to dampen the noise are clusters of weathered metal panels suspended from the ceiling. It's just a cool spot that reminds me a bit of the rowhouse eateries in Baltimore.  Our server was exceptional. His knowledge of the menu and the restaurant was evident, with recommendations for both food and drink offered immediately. He was professional and attentive while the kitchen kept our meal well-paced.There's no doubt that Salt+ is leaning more toward the specialty cocktails market than the beer market. They've got a list of mixologist inspired drinks - something like a dozen or more of them - with fancy schmancy ingredients like elderflower liqueur, smoked salt, celery juice and cardamom bitters. I'm a beer guy, so I was a tad disappointed that they only have 4 taps. No worries, though, they've got a decent bottles list that kept me occupied and my wife really enjoyed her drinks.  The food here is all about composed small plates designed for sharing. I wouldn't call them large, so sharing is probably for 2-3 people, max. My wife and I had no trouble working our way through 6 different dishes (we wanted to experience this place, don't judge us!), leaving us pleasantly full at the end of the meal. Your experience may vary, so pace yourself. The menu is sectioned into three sections - veggies, fish and meat. Ingredients are clearly listed, although you'd better have your smartphone ready to Google some of the (we were stumped by cioppino and pebre). I recommend starting with a couple plates at a time and going from there. They pace them out for you so everything doesn't arrive at once. That was nice.  We went with wild mushroom quiche, the white bean puree and the butter lettuce salad. My favorite of this trio was the quiche - perfectly seasonsed eggy innards loaded with wild mushrooms exploding with umami atop a buttery, crispy crust. I could have eaten 4 of these. The white bean puree was sort of a take on hummus, flavorful, smooth and salted well by the chopped olives, but the bread was a bit on the oily side and there wasn't enough of it. The salad was just ok - leaves of butter lettuce wrapped with thin-sliced cukes and a few slices of grapefruit.   For our more protein-y options we had the blackened swordfish, fried calamari and marinated flatiron steak. The swordfish was the star here. Seared perfectly, a hint of blackened crust, a touch of heat over tender, meaty swordfish topped by a fresh avocado, black garlic and red onion salsa and that polenta cake was sinful, sweet, just the right amount of mushy. The steak was cooked to medium, topped with a salsa of olive oil, smoky peppers, onions, garlic and coriander and paired with cumin roasted yukon gold taters. The meat was tasty, although some of it was on the chewy side, and the salsa was incredibly fresh and flavorful. The use of cumin was a tad heavy-handed, ruling the roost for sure.The calamari, lightly breaded and fried, was a hearty portion served over a ridiculously delicious coriander coconut sauce. I like my calamari a bit crispier, but damn, these were addictive.  Salt+ is a welcome departure from the usual fare you'll find up the street in Lakewood. Smaller dishes, beautifully composed with an artful eye, fresh and local, the whole deal. If you're a fancy cocktail person, you'll be in heaven, too. Now back to (2) from above. As I mentioned, you're not gonna get off cheaply at Salt+. Cocktails will run you about $12 each and dishes are in the $10-12 a piece range. For the 6 dishes and 4 drinks we partook of during our visit - $107 before tip. That's what I'm talkin' about. Yeah, it's not everyday you'll drop a C-note on a dinner and drinks, but if you wanna feel special and all grown up or just treat yourself, Salt+ will do you right."}
{"text":"I've lived in Lakewood for a long time now and should not have waited this long to eat here. It was some of the best food I've ever had. Excellent presentation, excellent service and excellent atmosphere. So happy this place is within walking distance."}
{"text":"Great food, great beer, great cocktails, amazing service.  What more could you want.  What's nice is you can order amazing dishes and if your still hungry you can order a couple more amazing dishes.  Had the shrimp...twice. The prices are totally reasonable which ordering cocktails a lot easier."}
{"text":"Recently had my rehearsal dinner here with family and friends and it was incredible. The atmosphere, service, and most importantly the food is top notch! We all had so much fun ordering different cocktails and small plates and passing them around. We had a hard time deciding which dish we liked the most. The white bean purée and scallops were definitely two of my favorites! Everyone went on and on about how much fun they had and what a great dining experience it was, especially for a larger group of people. I highly recommend Salt. Whether it's for a night out with your partner, friends, or a large group of family. They can accommodate you in any way! Jill is as talented as she is sweet."}
{"text":"First time here and will definitely be back. I love that this place serves small plates, lets you try a little of everything. The Octopus and the Lamb carpaccio is a most try. The meatballs were fantastic and rival my mom 's. ( shh don't tell her).   Vibe was chill and a great place for a date. Service was impeccable, Allison took great care of us.   Will be back soon to try the calamari and much more!"}
{"text":"We went in a group of 4 and shared 7 small dishes and 2 desserts, tapas style. Everything was very good with many interesting, unusual, subtle flavors. Service was good; minimal waiting considering it was a Saturday night and the place was full; the dishes came in 1 or 2 at a time, with just enough time in between to savor them. I could complain that the bill was a bit high, but it was worth it."}
{"text":"Wow. Just delicious. Drinks, apps. Fish and Meats just wow. Even drinks and desserts were great. Who would think to put pepper on pannacotta!"}
{"text":"Went here with a large group. Tastings/tapas on the pricier side. Tried several things. Depending on what you get, you'd need 3 plates each to be full. More likely just a place for a drink and a snack before dinner elsewhere. Décor is on the trendy industrial intimate side (wood, metal, exposed brick, soft lights). Server was excellent (knowledgeable and attentive).   *Manchego cheese - Nothing special at all. Get the cheese from a grocery store and eat at home.  *Smoked Beet Salad - Had a bite of this and thought the flavors worked really well together.  *White Bean Puree $8 - The best thing I ate! Very good. Four points of toast is not enough though, and I ended up eating the puree with a spoon.   *Stuffed Dates $8 - Good, but expensive at $2 per little date (4 per order). *Calamari $10 - This was tasty, really enjoyed the coconut sauce.  *Sweet Potato Croquette - Seemed plain to me.  *Short Rib - Had a bite and thought the meat was cooked perfectly.  *Angle food cake - Good/okay, but lacked enough sauce and fruit to make it great.   Seems like they have some tempting sounding concoctions; but dishes are either excellent or completely fall short of expectations. Some plates were smaller portion sizes than others (and they were all already tapas sized). Menu has changed since my visit in September. I think if you  prepare yourself to spend money, eat several small plates, and are willing to gamble on what is going to be good, then this place will be satisfying. I would try it again, but am nowhere  near in a rush to get back."}
{"text":"We had heard thru the grapevine that there was a new addition to the Lakewood dining scene and happened to stumble in on their second night of service.  We had a great experience and look forward to many meals.  Decor: my wife loved the blue walls and the corrugated ceiling. There is a great intimacy to the room. The only odd thing is the Kitchen has an open pass and the fluorescent lights are really harsh compared to the rest of the dark space.  Service: The service was attentive but not overbearing. Our server had a good knowledge of the menu. The only critique is that all of our food hit the table at once. The was no pacing to the meal. Since it is small plates it would be nice if the server or expediter coursed out the meal so that food stayed warm.  Food: The food was legit good. We over ordered and had 9 plates for 2 people plus dessert. The problem was everything sounded so good! All of the food had a light touch and minimalist presentation. The highlights were the smoked trout, octopus, curried cauliflower, pork pie, and the calamari.  The calamari is a bold move in Lakewood. With both Deagans and Forage rocking amazing renditions it takes a big set to put calamari on the menu. But the coconut glaze at Salt+ is equal to the challenge.  The only dishes that we had that we did not enjoy were the short ribs and meatballs.  The meatballs were rather dense and the short rib dish just lacked a component the kimchi did not pack the punch I had expected  A final note: The angel food dessert is something I woke up in the morning still thinking about. Get it."}
{"text":"Went for our two year anniversary! All of our food was delicious, and we enjoyed a cocktail and some wine.  Cocktail: The Bride (of course, lol! It's an anniversary celebration!) Vodka, pineapple cordial, lemon juice, simple syrup. Served to us with two straws, since we're married and all, y'all. Quite delicious, although we couldn't both sip at the same time... more about that later!  Wine: Stolpman Vineyards Syrah 2013. Quite good. Better with food than alone. Paired very well with our food choices!!!  Food: Citrusy olives - very nice mix of green/black/purple olives with herbs/spices and citrus zest. I  olives and wine, so this was a win!!!  White bean purée - SO DELICIOUS!!!!!! Like a very mellow hummus with super good flavors. The grilled bread has a tad toooo much oil on it, but not a deal killer. Tied for my fave plate of the night!  Smoked mahi - served with plantain chips and pineapple salsa. Cold dish, with excellent smoky flavor! I likened it to jerky in the best way, my hubby said NO WAY - he loved this dish the most! Great flavors and textures.  Duck breast pastrami - served with rye toast, house pickles, mustard relish. This was my tied for best dish!!!! If you like pastrami, this will make your mouth, and heart, happy!!!! The pickles are delicious and add some needed acidity. Hubs was worried because he does not like duck... let's just say he now knows duck is delish!  Pork belly - glazed with spicy mustard and honey, served over peach salsa. Another hit!!!! This tasted very Asian to me. Lovely husband ate it up, and finished a lot of the salsa when the porky goodness was all gone.  So, you ask, such great reviews of everything, why ONLY 4 stars?!?!?   First, 4 stars is still ridiculously awesome. However, if you sit in a booth, either have a super long torso, or be prepared to have your chin very close to the table (which is handy for shoveling in the good food, but weird overall). So even as my husband argues with me gently on this anniversary, I've gotta take one star off for awkward seating!  Still, highly recommend overall!"}
{"text":"Salt+ has absolutely become one of my favorite restaurants! You can go there for beautifully made cocktails, a snack, or a dinner and you'll have so much variety in your meal. The white bean puree is one of my favorites, and is surprisingly filling! I've tried multiple small plates from here and have enjoyed every single one including the calamari, carrots, pork belly, carpaccio, and the list goes on! Their menu changes relatively often so you never get bored, and always want to come back for more! Make sure to check out their happy hour at the bar as you can get awesome chips w wasabi dip or nuts with a glass of wine or a French 75 for $5! You'll end up staying past happy hour though, but just to get you started ;) You're doing a phenomenal job Allison (my amazing go-to server/manager), Jessica, Jill, Cory, Angela, Jess, Nick and everyone!! I'm already looking forward to the next time I come back!"}
{"text":"A group of 4 women visited Salt on a Wednesday night. We tried maybe 10 different plates and there wasn't one that we didn't like. They were all delicious! Service was attentive and knowledgable but not annoying or obtrusive. Atmosphere was great - warm and welcoming.  Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Owners did a nice job turning a rundown local bar in to a cozy spot and we wish them luck. Having said that, 2 scallops presented as a \"small plate\" should not cost $13. Yes, they were quite tasty but seriously- that's almost $7 per scallop! Had we thought to ask in advance how many scallops came on the plate we never would've ordered them.  The duck was excellent and the beets were tasty but in all fairness we left Salt paying $71 (pre-tip) for 3 small plates, a cocktail and 2 glasses of wine. Our server was great , well-informed and attentive, so adding that $15 tip put us at $86, not full, and feeling taken advantage of. It will be a while before we return to Salt and we hesitate recommending it to friends due to pricing. We do not typically cringe at our dining bills and eat out quite frequently. This one took us by surprise. Hopefully once they figure out cost vs profit they will be able to charge prices that actually represent the portions being served."}
{"text":"Came here tonight for our first visit. Loved the decor, the food was yummy, the waitstaff great and accommodating. We love the place!  Ecclectuc decor, presentation fantastic. We will come here often!!  Lakewood had a real winner here!!"}
{"text":"Having just returned from hiking in Perú with my brother, we decided to make our first meal back something new. Driving around the Strongsville/Cleveland area for a good hour, we ended up deciding on Salt +. The + is silent, haha. What drew us in was a combination of the hangry kicking in, but also it's interesting exterior and windowed design. From the outside, we were quite intrigued by the designs we saw within the establishment.    Entering, we were greeted by the wait or, but as well as a swanky LA/NYC hipster later night dining location. The dim atmospheric lighting, the rustic hipster furnishing, the enthusiastic service, and of course as we sat, the unique plates. There are alcoholic selections, but we wanted something traditional and refreshing, an ice cold coke with lime. To our surprise, it came in a large classic glass bottle (which is the best flavor coke gets). So by that, I assume, no refills.    To eat, we were informed by the very helpful Nick, that we should get about two plates each to fill up and share properly. The dining experience is very unique, well designed, and sort of tapas style, with various smaller platters of intriguing dishes. For a group of four, we ordered about 7 plates. A butter lettuce plate, marinated olives, a dried Mahi Mahi with pineapple, a calamari mussel bowl, iron flat meat, and Lamb meatballs. Each dish came in a very nice design and look to it. I would also agree with Nick, that one plate would not be enough to fill you up, therefore sharing is recommended. Out of what we tried, I'd say the dried Mahi Mahi was my favorite, but I do give you the heads up that it is dried, not hot.    All in all, this is undoubtedly a unique and hip spot to done in. I loved the design and atmosphere as we were dining. The service is very kind and knowledgeable, as well as even spacing out your dishes as they see fit to match the pacing of the options. I recommend having an experience here, because it is one of the more unique and memorable restaurants I've visited. Even at the end, each waiter has a little notebook they hand to you with the bill, in which you can leave a little note."}
{"text":"First time yesterday and it was a great experience:  We had the white bean purée, short ribs, pork belly, calamari, malanga fritters and lamb stew. Everything was great except the lamb stew: the rice was undercooked and we had to send it back. Most of the plates were $8-13  Our waitress was also great! She gave good recommendations. For drinks, I has the Joan. $15 was steep but didn't stop me from ordering it twice"}
{"text":"Simply amazing!   The food is delicious, the atmosphere is relaxing and the service is on point.  Great addition to Lakewood."}
{"text":"Excellent food, drinks, and service. Great ambience/atmosphere/decor. I simply thought it was a tad overpriced. Just a tad, though. I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"mi crítica del día de restaurante prohibido en Cleveland: setas rellenas de verduras era agradable, pero la mermelada de tomate era la estrella. pastel de cangrejo necesitó 2 minutos más en la sartén. los muslos de gallina eran la perfección. voy a volver"}
{"text":"I'm little bit disappointed with this place. Read further for details. I wanted to visit this place for a long time. I had often attended Beck center and the restaurant was next to.  The welcoming staff was nice and helped us to find the table. The interior is modern/ industrial but I liked and felt comfy.  Ok, so here what I didn't like. Our waitress was Elaisa (maybe I spell wrong but sounded as \"Elaisa\"). The waitress wasn't probably in the mood because I couldn't call her attentive or even professional. She brought water, took order and then brought drinks. We ordered two cocktails that were covered with ice. Of course, ice started melt and we asked for cocktail napkins, and the waiter stated that the place don't have any cocktail napkins or covers for drinks. We were surprised with the answer, but didn't say anything. Next, she took our order and as always I do, I asked for dressing or sauces on the side. Suddenly I needed to listen 5 minutes talk how the chef didn't like the requests for substitutes, and that guests needed to be happy with the food bc all ingredients were needed in the way how they were- seriously? Just bring what I want or make some professional and polite statement without making people tired of listening when they want to have fun!lol  Food came fast enough because the place wasn't busy. I won't lie- food tasted week. Although my girlfriend disliked her appetizer- eggplant, I thought that asparagus and eggplant were fine. My fish and her steak were good too. By the way, while we were waiting for entrees, we saw guy sitting at the next table, and his drinks had...cocktail napkins. At the same time, another waiter asked if everything was good, and we repeated our request about napkins. The waiter was surprised that our waitress hadn't brought them before.  My verdict is that I liked the place and ambience. I disliked the waitress's attitude and the rule that I couldn't substitute the items. However, I may try the place one more time to have a better opinion."}
{"text":"I have been planning on visiting this restaurant for a while now after hearing all of the good things about it and I'm glad I did.   Atmosphere: feels like a lounge where you can just kick back and relax. Very friendly staff. Decor is simple yet sophisticated.   Food: we ordered about 7 small plates for the table. I can honestly say 5 were very good and 2 of them were okay. I would highly recommend the lamb meatballs and the wild mushroom quiche. The down side is that each small plate averages about 8-10$ so your bill for 2 people can easily reach 100.   Service: very kind waiter, although the plates did come out one at a time and at times there were 15-20 minutes of waiting until the next plate came out. I'm not sure if this was intended if not."}
{"text":"This is probably the best restaurant in Lakewood right now. The smoked trout and the curried cauliflower in particular are two dished I recommend to friends going there. Everyone who works there seems to know what they are doing, and really want to be there. A delightful experience."}
{"text":"Usually I'll give restaurants with good reviews more than one chance but not gonna do it with SALT ... I can think of nothing positive to say .. the music was so loud I couldn't hear my friend and we were almost nose to nose .. we were seated directly under a speaker with music so loud I had ringing in the ears for 2 days .. when asked to be moved to a different table not so close to the speakers , I was told all the empty tables were \"Reserved\"..  apparently SALT attracts people who make reservations but don't show up .. most of the \"Reserved\" tables were still empty when we left ..  the experience was so awful I can not remember what I had for food nor do I care .. too many good restaurants in Cleveland to repeat that experience . One word about SALT  , AVOID!!!"}
{"text":"1st time at the new Hot spot and I'm leaving happier than I can remember after a meal.  Ambiance is great, music not too loud, no tv's, and 12 seat bar.  I will skip the wine selection which was very good and the fun drinks which were unique. Had two apps, white bean and chicken liver pate. I'm not fibbing when I say that I licked the bowl the pate topped w duck fat and pickles came with . Toast points ....etc...everything perfect . No flaws. My only hope is that they switch up the menu often cuz I'm gonna whip through this one in a couple weeks!"}
{"text":"Salt+ is a swanky little shindig. As an art gal, the décor is fantastic. It's sleek and sexy with great lighting fixtures and exposed brick walls.  The concept of tapas gets lost on Americans often, because we're all trained to be gluttonous over eaters. I've lived abroad and understand the art of tapas. So when it comes to Salt+, just know that you're coming for small plates and it might not suffice a full meal for you.  While some tapas portions are generous, I found the portions, for the price, to just be decent. Everyone at my table had a few small plates, which we shared bites of. A few small plates and a drink will run you $50+. 1 of my 3 small plates were excellent--the short rib was inventive and hearty. The other 2 weren't super memorable (lamb, angel food). I can't dispute that it seemed like they had many creative concoctions, so I likely just didn't choose the right things.   My drink, the house made gin Evelyn cocktail, was a disappointment. While it had potential, the glass was fully littered with herbs. I've actually never seen anything like this. The drink had so many herbs, that even in the littlest sip, it would uncomfortably prick and be stuck on your lips or teeth. Trust me, I hate seeing a good cocktail go unfinished, but this was just so weird to me that I barely finished half of my drink. If you're torn on the drink menu--I would go with a glass of wine. Overall, an interesting spot, just know what you're getting into."}
{"text":"If you like garlic you will love this place, unfortunately I don't tolerate garlic well and dishes that didn't even mention that they had garlic in them came out so full of it that I wasn't even able to taste the dish (shaved zucchini).  White bean dip was yummy and so were the beef kabobs (and not garlicky).  Ambiance was beautiful and well thought out.  Nice wine list.  Good service.  We were able to make a reservation same day for 2 (I believe this is a new development.)."}
{"text":"There aren't enough tapas joints in Cleveland, in my opinion, so Salt+ is a refreshing new addition to the local food scene. I've only been once but plan to return again soon!  The hostesses were friendly, & the server was, too, in addition to being prompt & helpful without being overbearing. Someone who I presume must be the owner or manager also came by once to make sure everything was going well. They seem like a well-oiled team, which can't be said for so many new - & even old! - restaurants.  We had a hard time deciding what to order off a menu where just about everything sounded delicious, but for our first visit, we split the date with bleu cheese & bacon jam (DIVINE), the sweet potato croquettes with red pepper sauce (good but a little... squishy for my tastes?), the calamari with coriander coconut glaze (would've liked more of that amazing glaze!), & the short ribs with fresh kimchi & sweet potatoes (easily one of the best dishes I've ever had). The short ribs, in particular, were standout - sweet & smoky & sour all at the same time, the perfect blend of flavors - even for my boyfriend, who's not a big kimchi fan.   I also tried a fancy little cocktail, the O'Keeffe, made with bourbon, St. German, orange flower water, & rhubarb shrub. Upon first sip, it was WAY TOO BOOZY, but on the second, my taste buds adjusted... & loved it. What a unique drink combo! I loved, too, that it was served with a little, old-fashioned paper straw. Hey, it's the small details, you know?  I look forward to trying Salt+ again & to seeing how their menu changes with the seasons. I have a feeling I'll like just about anything they whip up!"}
{"text":"A lovely place to enjoy trendy drinks or wine, and graze through amazing small plates!  The employees are so warm and attentive.  The white bean puree and the calamari are wonderful!  Great people watching. A Lakewood gem!"}
{"text":"Crowded on a Friday night, but not too long of a wait- we waited at the small but well-stocked bar, which had beers from several small local breweries (I had the Sibling Revelry Belgian). Decor is urban trendy. No television, but a bit noisy on Friday night from the babble of conversation. It's a small plate restaurant, so the idea is to get a number of dishes and share. Short menu--one sheet- but they put a lot of work into each dish. We had the acorn squash with pistachio and sage pesto-- excellent (but don't look for it on the menu, it was today's special), lamb kebabs with tzatziki and mango chutney, smoked sturgeon with bagel  chips (and a sprinkle of caviar), roasted yellow beets with Stilton bleu and mustard frills, short ribs with jalapeño and root vegetable hash (that root vegetable hash was great!), and \"French bean and breakfast radish Caesar, soft cooked egg and crouton\" (interesting concept, but somewhat boring eating)."}
{"text":"So much fun eating such good food. Best meal I have had in a long time. Shared all food btwn 4 of us. Would be really great for 2-6 people."}
{"text":"The hostess was amazing great to see politeness and professionalism all at once.  Great job to Tristin"}
{"text":"I'm convinced that small plates are going to replace brunch for most beloved yuppie cuisine any day now. As such, Salt is on the right track. The plates are Cleveland small (think way bigger than tapas) and nicely varied. The menu is streamlined but interesting, with creative options for carnivores or vegetarians. We tried an array of things and were impressed overall, though a couple items were a bit lacking on seasoning and an otherwise delicious chicken liver pate came out bone cold (as in too cold to fully enjoy). Service was very fast even though the place was packed. It's a good spot that I think will only get better."}
{"text":"Food was not bad, service was odd.  The menu said eggs and they brought out one egg.  Per my request, the server asked the owner/manager if this was correct (as he was new). A few feet from our table, I could hear her complaining about my simple question. If it's one egg, the menu should say egg and not eggs. Also, it shouldn't be $3."}
{"text":"Some relatives were in town so we came to Salt for a late and light dinner. We all loved the selections of tapas we chose (except my 95 year old grandfather. He thought the food was good, but too complex for his taste, and he didn't understand the concept of tapas. but then again, his favorite restaurant is Applebees and will only get the chicken fingers there). The calamari was, by far, probably the best and most tender calamari I have had in a restaurant. The beet salad was also incredible. Someone else got the mussels and kept remarking how tender they were. Their cocktails are also very good. I would definitely return many many times.  I have only written a couple restaurant reviews, but I had to come on here and share how good the calamari was. A+"}
{"text":"Salt is a bright gastronomic light in a challenging food scene. Chef Jill knows how to hone in on amazing flavors with her tasty small plates. Also the atmosphere is so fun and moody. It's like finding a little underground treasure.   MUST ORDER: Any of the bourbon cocktails with witty names. The white bean puree on grilled bread was surprisingly delicious.  And come on, you have me at grilled bread.  The calamari is also some of the lightest and most tender calamari I've ever had. The shrimp is also so meaty, rich and flavorful. I think i ate two orders myself.  Since they work with seasonal food, I can't wait to see what is on the fall menu!!!"}
{"text":"Girls night out and Salt did not disappoint. Great food and great drinks with great friends The small group plates are awesome for sharing. We all chose 1 item each to share and all 4 were delicious. Our waitress actually suggested 2-3 small plates per person but we decided to start slow and it ended up fine for us. If your appetites are larger than her recommendation would hold true.  Our 4 choices were: 1. The spaghetti squash which was tender flavorful and covered in shaved Parmesan-yum! 2. White bean purée, covered in smashed olives and served With a crusty buttered bread which was delicious, possibly my favorite. 3. Fried Yucca frites served with a chimichurri aioli-fabulous 4. Crispy Brussels sprouts in a delicious soy glaze.  All in all we cleared our plates. Now for the drinks. While we stuck with wine at the table for the most part I did dabble and tried a cocktail. Having been disappointed that they did not carry a moscata I decided to try the The Tarana honey vanilla vodka and silver dust while magical was a little strong for me and I switched to a Riesling. Hopeful a moscata will turn up on their menu in the future, but all in all I highly recommend a visit to salt."}
{"text":"$$$$ - one of the most expensive ways to eat in Cleveland.  A meal for 2 was around $75, with tip, no dessert.  However, if you are open to a super expensive meal and you have a diverse palette, this is a place to go.  On Saturday night we arrived around 540pm and were seated immediately.  When we left at 645pm, there was a decent crowd waiting for tables and every table top was full.  They don't take reservations except for 6+, probably because in this style of eating it is hard to predict how long each group will be.    Still earned 5 stars because the small plates were amazing.  Menu changes every 2-3 months, except for keeping some chef specialties.  The two of us ordered 5 plates, which was a very satisfying amount of food.  The ingredients are high quality and beautifully prepared, and taste fantastic.  We really enjoyed each plate.  Our two favorites: --white bean purée, olives & toast - terrible breath, bread was super buttery, amazing combo  --braised octopus - per my husband, he says it is very difficult to cook octopus well and they nailed it  Did I mention - awesome vegetarian options?"}
{"text":"Excellent tapis meals.  Amazing wine list. Excellent service.  Wonderful food.  Prices good.  New York City dining in Lakewood, OH.  Wonderful service."}
{"text":"My new favorite restaurant in Cleveland. Every dish was a delight to the senses. AND we were lucky enough to come on Monday night, when they had live music. So happy that they are adding more tapas restaurants to Cleveland!"}
{"text":"This was my second visit to Salt. First visit was on our anniversary for dinner a few years ago, right around when they opened. The food (shareable plates) is phenomenal, the drink menu stellar, the decor subtle. Our party or five started with a bottle of wine, mixed drinks, and some Brussel sprouts, which we had to order a second plate because they were so good. We ordered two each of the lamb meatballs and shrimp on polenta. We followed this with short ribs, scallops, and schnitzel. Another bottle of wine, and a couple of shared desserts (apple Brown Betty al a mode and salted caramel ice cream-meh). The service was \"ok\" and here's why: my wife ordered a Diet Coke, and the server brought a cute, but expired bottle of Diet Coke. It was flat. We pointed this out to the server, who said she would go look for a different bottle, but came back with another bottle of expired Diet Coke. We pointed this out to her again, ands hen she offeeed to try again, we decided water would be a better choice. We spent $300 on the meal, with tip, which is moderately pricey for a Lakewood joint, but we love our local businesses, and Salt is owned by a Lakewood native. The last thing that made this a four star night was the hostess came to our table and said, \"I don't mean to rush you, but we have  another party waiting for this table.\" Many problems with this. First, you did in fact mean to rush us. Second, you sat a party of five at the largest table in the joint, which could have accommodated 8-10 people. And finally there were other open tables in the restaurant. That was all we needed to hear. Any other opportunities to have another drink we're lost: we packed up and left with a less than stellar experience in what should have been a five star review, and headed elsewhere for a nightcap."}
{"text":"Went on a random Tuesday evening with my love and enjoyed our dinner. We didn't want to overstuff ourselves and just wanted something small so the Tapas was perfect. We shared 3 small plates starting with the artichokes which were delish and actually had quite a lot for a small plate. We also had the steak with demi, onions and blue cheese and I thought it was delish and a perfect blend of flavor. The last plate was the meatballs and homemade pasta. SO BIG for a small plate. It was amazing. It was a little on the more pricey side for only having 3 small plates and waters, we spent $50 but the portions were big and delish. The ambiance and decor is amazing. I'm a designer so I loved looking at every corner and seeing something different. The only down side was that it was only us and another couple in the restaurant so it felt a little awkward but will def be back to try more and have cocktails."}
{"text":"Food was outstanding. The really good waiter, Dan suggested ordering a couple plates, eating those and then ordering a couple more, until we were satisfied. I'm going to crave the Mushroom oyster Brie bread pudding. Also loved the octopus and calamari though I'd have them in different \"rounds.\"  Both were so good and very different.  The space is comfortable and a bit fun-loud. You knew you were eating out, but had no trouble hearing those at your table. Not inexpensive but worth the money. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Modern decor live musician and yummy tapas no way to go wrong with that. Came to SALT on a Monday night and was pleasantly surprised they had someone playing instruments and singing and she was very good, setting a nice relaxed vibe. The tapas were yummy tried the calamari, peppers and braised beef. Enjoyed all three and their different flavors. Tapas are small as you know and can get pricy so definitely check this place out but don't come as a starving grizzly bear because it will add up quick. Can't wait to come back and try more Tapas!!"}
{"text":"Interesting tapas place in Lakewood.  We're always a fan of tapas- mostly for the fact that you can try lots of different things with small portions and you get full. I always equate it to the spanish version of dim sum- just lots of variety.  We were looking for a new place to check out on the west side, and decided to check out Salt+ A. We were greeted with what seemed a lot of local Lakewood people- given we went during the first month of it opening- but still, it was nice to see the neighborhood support a local business.  I had ordered the Evelyn to drink- eh, wasn't too impressed with it. However, the food was rather interesting and good!  We got:  - braised octopus- a little bit on the oily side, but still nice and chewy, marinated well, and was quite tasty. - sweet potato croquette (may have just been the special for the night)- that was lightly fried and oh so tasty- we really enjoyed that one - lamb carpaccio- I really enjoyed this- the presentation was really interesting too- at first I thought a decorated plate came out...until I realized it was the lamb (haha) - a seafood special that I can't remember the name of- wasn't super notable, but it was pretty good  Overall, it's a nice place for some tapas in Lakewood- and a nice addition to the interesting mix of restaurants that they have in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Everything that we ordered was ridiculously flavorful. We ordered about 9 things off the menu and each this was expertly made and goddamn!!! It was so delicious!  Everyone who was serving us was great and regular and relaxed and super kind. The cocktails are awesome.  Will be back often"}
{"text":"Second visit, and hands down I'm in love just as much as the first visit! Ordered a bottle of Malbec that went super well with the Charred Octopus, mussels, roasted carrots and lardo plate. The only thing I was missing was the calamari. Should have ordered it, had it the first visit there and the flavors are outstanding! Will be back for more."}
{"text":"Okay, I LOVED Salt. Everything about it. The decor, the food, the friendliness of our waiter. It has been one of my most recent favorite restaurant experiences!  We tried several things from the menu and everything was great-- the pork pie and shrimp were really stand outs though!  The cocktails were A+! Some of the better ones I've had at a restaurant, and I know my cocktails, so that is important.   I truly think it's perfect for a date night. A little dim, tables aren't too cramped together, you can share your food! It is a bit pricey for what you get but I would pick this place ever a lot of others based on the atmosphere and service."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. I kept hearing great things about it and everytime I drove by it on my way home it always looked packed. One summer afternoon after a long day at work my boyfriend and I decided to stop by and hit up their happy hour. We ordered the swordfish appetizer and it was phenomenal. The swordfish was cooked perfectly and the flavor was awesome. We then ordered pork fat with a black bean puree and it was not really good at all. The drinks were ok but when I asked the bartender for something tart what he recommended tasted like straight sugar. He was nice about making me another drink but the mojito he made was just soso. Overall for as overpriced as it is I would say I was disappointed."}
{"text":"I went with 6 friends and for the corner triangle table. The bench was horribly uncomfortable. If I go back I wouldn't ever sit there again. The service was good and Dan was attentive. Great wine and cocktail list. The food...It was good but not worth the price. The seating and cost are why I gave 3/5."}
{"text":"First time visit  Service is quick and very good.   Small plates. Be ready if you are hungry.  Comes out fast.  Drinks were very good - unique and tasty. They were appropriately strong, unlike some places that go easy on the booze.  Group of 6. All loved."}
{"text":"I LOVE Jill Vedaa!!! This concept is amazing and so is every small plate we've had! Absolutely outstanding! I first had the pleasure of enjoying her cooking at the botanical gardens when we went for a cooking demonstration/sample. After that was over, we went directly to Rockafellers where she was the head chef and we had yet another wonderful experience! I cannot tell you how happy I am that she opened a restaurant on the West side! We will be back as often as possible!!!! Congrats on such a unique to lakewood spot!"}
{"text":"We've been here several times and they never disappoint.  Food is exquisite, service is excellent.  The white bean puree is to die for - and I don't even like beans!  I highly recommend this great restaurant!"}
{"text":"Recently visited with a couple of friends and was pleasantly surprised. The atmosphere and overall vibe is what you would expect, in a good way, and service was outstanding. I would rate more as 3.5 stars.  The drink list looked good, although I didn't order a cocktail so I can't say how the actual drinks taste, but they looked to have a nice selection of beer and cocktails.  The food is what I would really rate, and it was good. It is definitely a tapas place, as advertised, so don't go expecting a huge meal. My husband left a little hungry, he ordered two different plates for himself and is a normal 'guy' type of eater. I also ordered two plates, had leftovers, and was very comfortable. They suggested we all share a bunch of plates, but nobody could agree on what the table wanted so we went our separate ways for food.  Prices were ok, they were on the higher end for portion sizes, but it wasn't awful. One thing that really bothered me was something they used in the short rib dish. They used those really cheap Utz Potato Sticks. ?!?!? Really?!? Maybe they weren't Utz Potato Sticks, but they certainly looked and tasted that way: cheap and stale. They just didn't fit. IDK, perhaps they think it's fun and hip, retro or something, but the rest of the dish didn't read that way. It would be much better if they left them off alltogether.  Salt was a good option for that night, I would definitely recommend everyone give it a try. I'm not sure we'll turn into regulars, but I would be happy going back if a friend ever wanted to try it out."}
{"text":"Plus side: The food was really very tasty. Server really worked hard for our group.  Wine suggestion was spot on.  Minus side: The prices were high for the tiny portion sizes.  Yes, I understand that this is a small plate place where you are encouraged to share a few small plates.   For $23, I feel that the shrimp dish and smoked beet salad should have almost filled me up.   I also think that hominy and salad greens are pretty inexpensive ingredients and Salt could have easily provided more of that on the plates. Anyway, I have come to the conclusion that I am not a small plate restaurant kind of patron."}
{"text":"First of all, I love the style of this restaurant. The decor is great. We sat at a triangular table in the corner and I loved that.  As other reviewers have pointed out, this is a place for tapas, or small plates. Best to come here if you just want a snack. The portions are small but that is to be expected.  We came here with a rather large group. Despite our large group, the service was excellent. Our server was very knowledgeable about the menu and was able to make recommendations.  Ok, moving on to the most important thing - the food. We started with the sweet potato croquetes. They were good, but unfortunately, I can't say they were anything special. Then we had the garlic shrimp. This was the best thing we ate that night. The hominy was a really nice addition and for $13, I really thought there would have been a bit more of it. We also tried the short ribs - they were cooked well but not super flavorful. We also had two desserts off the menu (the crunch bar and the pot du creme) which were decent. I would like to go back and try a few other things off the menu. Other people in out group had the bean  dip which looked great and the manchego cheese on the menu seemed interesting.  Overall, this place was really nice gathering place to have a snack and a drink with a friend but be aware that the prices are a bit high for what you get and you might not leave there with a full belly. But, the decor and service were great."}
{"text":"Interesting spot... we are seeing more and more of these izakaya inspired/ tapas style joints popping up. I think people should be aware of what this restaurant is before they try it out. For starters, it's really not meant to be a \"dining\" restaurant, but rather a drink and snack kind of joint. Not in the casual sense, but rather in the sense that their dishes are designed to be stacked. Ideally, you might visit a place like this later in the evening with a group of friends, and each person would order a few dishes to share. The food isn't really designed to be filling, but rather to enjoy while drinking and hanging out with a group. That being said, it made it the perfect joint to stop in as a large group for our supper club.   Our server, Jess, was absolutely amazing. She had some awesome serving skills, and had a very laid back style while still keeping everyone in the group happy. On top of that, she seemed very knowledgeable about everything on the menu, from wine to drinks to the food. I personally ended up trying the calamari, served with a coconut-coriander sauce along with the short rib, which is served alongside sweet potato and fresh kimchi. I really enjoyed both dishes, the calamari with coconut sauce was an interesting twist, and I did find the flavors to be complimentary. The short rib was really tasty, I felt it was prepared well and I loved how the kimchi was super gingery! The portions are served to taste, and I will say that some of the portions are more generous than others. For example, I felt the short rib was quite filling for the price, especially since I got two sides with it. The beet salad however, seemed a little skimpy for $10 considering it consists of mostly beets and greens, I felt they could have beefed up the portion a bit. I also felt the desserts were a miss... I ordered a chocolate ganache style dessert and it was quite rich and heavy, with not a lot to balance it out. I definitely would skip out on dessert next time and just get another drink after dinner instead. As for the drinks, they had some interesting choices, and I did end up trying a Kentucky Mule style drink, it was good, but if I were judging off of this drink, I wouldn't come back here just for cocktails. The beer list however, while it was small, had some unique choices I have not seen at other bars, so I think I would lean towards this option next time. I do wish they had some sort of happy hour special to incite people to stop in more, I think it's hard to justify spending $35-$50 a person on just snacks and drinks, but I will admit that the food itself is inspired and tasty.   Time will tell whether there's enough demand to keep a place like this going in the long term, but for now I'm giving it a thumbs up based on service and flavor alone!"}
