{"text":"I know they have only been open for a few weeks but the service was extremely slow. It took forever to get refills on water, never got refills on coffee, had to asked another server to get our bill,  and had to walk over to another server to hand them our payment. $11 or $12 for 2 meatballs (appetizer) was pricy even for Little Italy."}
{"text":"The food is hit and miss.

I've had great burgers and salads and other times when the meal falls flat on its face.  This is to be expected at a new establishments while they work out all the kinks however. 

It's also wonderful to have a place in little Italy finally that will serve some bar food.  (Unfortunately, there are many faux Italian restaurants here)

My biggest qualm is that they allege that the kitchen is open until 10.  In any restaurant I've ever worked at or eaten, that means the customer has UNTIL 10 to put in an order.  At Toli, 10 really means 9:30.  I tried to put in an order at 9:40 and the response was \"I'm sorry, but the kitchen closes at 10.\"  Meh?  Not the best customer service with that approach. 

I have all the faith in the world they'll figure out this hiccup and the chef/cook will get over that he/she can't walk out of the place at EXACTLY 10 just because that's personally convenient."}
{"text":"I wouldn't recommend stopping here if you're interested in good food or service. I stopped here when only a handful of people were in the restaurant. The service was slow despite there being plenty of help, and the food was below average. I wish I had taken a picture of the food, so I could show the disappointment in appearance as well. The only reason to stop by might be for a drink, but you should not expect much service. There are plenty of great restaurants in the area. Please visit one of those."}
{"text":"Awesome place! Came on a Friday early evening-ish and were worried about it being crowded, but it was pretty empty; according to the bartender it was a quiet weekend due to it being spring break at Case. 

Had the fried spaghetti for an appetizer - definitely recommended. I had a sandwich and my date had a burger - both were delicious and a fair amount of food for the cost. Server was attentive and helpful.

The prices were a little high for us to become regulars here, but it's definitely a spot I would take people visiting the Little Italy area. Great atmosphere and I'd like to see it on a bustling night too."}
{"text":"This is probably one of my favorite places to visit in Little Italy just because of the hip atmosphere and the kind service we always receive. The updated beer list made my boyfriend, who's in to IPA's, a happy camper. I always opt for the ever-fruity Ruffino Moscato- that I simply adore. We ordered the chicken wings with the dry rub and it did not disappoint. We got a sizable portion, the appetizer could easy be a entree. We both ordered the tavern burger and unfortunately it's the reason why TOLI gets four stars. I ordered a medium-cooked burger with sweet potato fries. Though the fries were thick-cut and simply AMAZING (I could seriously eat a whole plate of them), the burger was cooked well-done and the buns were quite burnt which made it too hard to bite into the burger. 

Even though my dinner wasn't perfect, this won't keep us from returning to such a hip and lively place in Little Italy. It's the perfect atmosphere for both the young and older crowds. Plus our waitress was super helpful and made our experience very enjoyable. Definitely will be returning, but possibly going to try to order something else as my entree."}
{"text":"You have to try TOLI, we've been here 3 times in past year and have not been disappointed.  Cool atmosphere and food is awesome.  Menu is limited, but we enjoyed everything we've ordered.  Wings and Bruschetta are excellent appetizers.  Love the flatbreads, burgers, pasta and meatballs.  Service could be a little better, but take this place for what it is...a really cool pub with excellent food!"}
{"text":"Stopped in TOLI today after seeing on social media they were going to serve brunch until 3 pm today.  We went into the establishment expecting a crowd due to the Columbus Day parade, although not expecting poor service and no hostess present. We were disappointed to see that @1:30 they had ran out of brunch food as well as Bloody Mary mix. We had a flat bread instead which was alright, although not what we had came for. Hopefully they can better prepare for the crowd next time."}
{"text":"Went with my girlfriends for our monthly dinner out.  We thoroughly enjoyed it! Great food & great atmosphere.  This the perfect addition to Little Italy!  We will be back!"}
{"text":"It was ok. The flatbread was good, happy hour wasn't bad either. Service just bit slow for not being busy. May return for happy hour again!"}
{"text":"My friends and I had an interesting but fun experience here recently. Our bartender happened to be a stand in bartender and while she didn't know the ins and outs of the bar she was absolutely hilarious. We didn't order any food but we had happy hour drinks. The draft beer list is good (around 8 taps) and of course we had to get Peroni's...because when in Little Italy..."}
{"text":"I'm going to be upfront. The only reason TOLI doesn't get 5 stars from me is the service. It literally took 15-20 minutes for anyone to give me a menu or ask me if I'd like a drink, and it only happened after I asked them. 

That aside, let's tackle the food. It was phenomenal. I got one of their specials, the Eggplant Parmesan. Now, if I'm getting Eggplant Parm at an Italian restaurant, I have high expectations. TOLI did not disappoint. The crust was flaky and wonderful, and the eggplant was cooked to perfection. The sauce was also fresh and flavorful. My only complaint would be that the portion was a little small. I kept craving more, even as I was eating it! Washed down with an IPA and a stout, this was a great little meal before heading out of town via the rta down the street. 

I definitely understand the concerns from others on the service. I request management to improve training or hire new staff, since it seems like this might be preventing people from re-visiting or trying TOLI out for the first time."}
{"text":"Had a Groupon I wanted to use before it expired. Called to make sure the kitchen was still open and it was. Grabbed my husband and we had an early valentines celebration. The meatballs w the spaghetti was really good. Loved the sauce. I devoured the mussels! Soooo good. The bread was the perfect crustiness to soak up all the good juice. Our bottle of wine was great and the waitress gave us a couple of tasters to make sure we picked one both of us would like. Great little spot to sneak out to on a week night."}
{"text":"Great new place, friendly staff, and my salad was delicious. They need to expand the wine selection and add some more appetizers"}
{"text":"Started out with excellent mussels.  Wow.  Best we have had in awhile.  Requested more bread.  The juice was delish.  Had that with a Chardonnay.  Limited wine selections.  Our daughter had a burger.  Wait staff Jackson was as very good.  The owner Dominic is very attentive as well.  Can't wait to go back!  Will review again on other entrees.  Stay tuned."}
{"text":"Suprisingly good food. We had rice balls and a flatbread. Two bottles of wine helped as well. Maybe not the most authentic Italian experience and a limited menu but it was good and I would go back."}
{"text":"Not a place for traditional Italian fare, but an awesome spot that's a fusion between a tavern style food and Italian cuisine. 

Some faves: the arugula salad with fried cheese! Refreshing greens pair surprisingly well with cheese balls. Also, spaghetti in meatballs are very fun and satisfying. And to return to the cheese- TOLI bombs are deep fried mozzarella but the stand out is the nice zesty little sauce it comes with.

You'll also find a hugeee selection of beers and tons on tap. Wine list is decent. Service has always been great. 

I seriously love this spot, and I guess the point deduction comes from only having two purely pasta options and not that many menu choices overall . It's nifty but not super duper Italian if that's what you're going for, though still a good place in many regards."}
{"text":"Came here with the Groupon deal. Bartender was very nice but it took an hour and forty-five minutes for our food to come out, which seems to be a recurring problem. Food was very good when we finally got it but probably won't be back unless the kitchen can pickup the pace in the future."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped by TOLI the other night to try the place out; we were not disappointed. 
TOLI sits centered in Little Italy in a warm niche between the other restaurants, bakeries and churches that make up this historic section of town. My wife and I got some libations and she got the Marghareta flatbread, and I got a little thing called \"The Bad Man\", which was a chicken parmesian sandwich on the thickest, tastiest ciabatta I've ever had. Add a side salad to it, and it was a full-up feast for the two of us after a cold day. 
The costs are about what you would expect, and there's only street parking or some lot parking (down by the rapid station at the railroad bridge,) that's close, but it's worth a stop if you'd like a nice bit of food and also, if I may say, some great service:)
So, if you'd like to find a spot that more that...TOLI-erable...(yeah, I went there,) than hit the Tavern Of Little Italy up for a nice warm meal)"}
{"text":"We've been to TOLI, or the Tavern of Little Italy, twice.  Once for dinner and tonight for happy hour.  Both times we've enjoyed ourselves.  The food is good and very reasonably priced. I had a Moscow mule tonight and it was delicious!  There is a small patio next to the restaurant that's great in the summer. Parking is pretty easy in the neighborhood. Certainly a place you should try!"}
{"text":"SLOW and terrible service with complimentary bad-attitude!!
My husband and I stopped in on a Saturday early evening so it wasn't terribly busy yet.
We sat at the bar and waited...and waited...and waited. When the bartender finally got to us she didn't smile, didn't apologize for the delay and acted as though being behind that bar was the last place on earth she waned to be.  The first 2 drafts my husband wanted to order were out and Miss Personality didn't bother to recommend anything similar.  
After we got our drinks we observed that her \"sparkling\" personality wasn't just for us- she didn't smile or act cordial to ANY patron.  With seemingly NO staff members interested in serving/greeting/helping customers, my husband and I witnessed at least 4 people wait at the door then opt to leave due to no staff acknowledging their existence.  We also over-heard other customers requesting servers double check to see if their food order was ever placed due to the length of time it was taking to get a simple appetizer.  
Little Italy has some WONDERFUL bars and restaurants with professional, attentive and quality service: I find no reason to go to a bar that lacks all three."}
{"text":"I would come here for just drinks and go somewhere else for food. We had a delicious $28 bottle of wine , which was a pretty good price. Service was pretty bad, but I think our waitress was brand new, so I will cut them some slack. Burger and Chicken Alfredo was just OK, alfredo sauce was broken. They should probably just be a bar and only serve a few apps."}
{"text":"Try the burgers!!!  They have some creative options and are in the running for a local contest where for \"Cleveland's Best Burger\". They have a contender in the peanut butter burger which I've seen pop up on a lot of menus of late but these guys really nail it. I don't know if they are going to win the contest but for my money this is Cleveland's Best!!!  The service is good but the place is loud. I still give it five stars because it's a tavern and that's to be expected."}
{"text":"I was excited to see a craft beer bar pop up in Little Italy.  The East side of Cleveland is sorely lacking in places with a good beer list and good food.  Sadly, TOLI is no exception.

The beer list was meh by craft standards - nothing special on the tap list (8 IPAs), but not too bad.  

I had mussels in white wine.  The white wine they used tasted like it had been opened the previous week and left to \"age\" on top of the stove.  It resulted in a bitter and acrid broth.  In the plus column, all of the mussels were open.

My wife and I shared the aranchini - which is to say, we both didn't eat them.  They were large, cold balls of rice that were barely deep fried.  

She got the Devils on Horseback flatbread, which she remarked, was \"okay\".

Another bad Italian-lite Little Italy over-priced meal.  At least we got lucky with parking.

The highlight is the outside seating."}
{"text":"We stopped in for a drink and then could not resist eating. The smells and the laughter pulled us in.  The mussels were delicious.  Saturday was nearly an all time high temp for winter in Cleveland, making everyone dream of when they will be able to open up the garage style windows, and use the alley space too.  Good cocktail and beer on tap.  The menu is broader than just Italian. Can't wait til summer, but we'll be back before then."}
{"text":"Based on other reviews, sounds like maybe a Saturday night wasn't the best time to try TOLI out. 

We arrived around 7:45 pm and took a seat at the bar after standing around for 5 or so minutes waiting for a table without a greeting. When we sat down and asked for food menus the bartender grimaced and said she wasn't allowed to put in a food order for 20 minutes since the kitchen was behind. Okay. 

We picked an appetizer and entrees (we were excited to try the sweet potato fries, but they were out) and asked her to place our orders when she was able to. About an hour and a half later, our appetizer arrived, cold (while chilly calamari isn't the most delicious, we were starving). About 30 minutes later my fiancé's burger arrived, but my burger didn't show for another 15 minutes. I kept trying to convince him to eat before his food got cold, but he wouldn't, since we figured it wouldn't be much longer since we ordered the exact same thing. Wrong. Sam ask for mayo and I asked for buffalo sauce. It took asking 3 separate waitstaff for our sauces before they finally arrived. 

While the location was great and I enjoyed my glass of wine, the service was the worst I've experienced in Little Italy. It seemed like every other patron was dealing with the same issues. Perhaps an off night, but seeing similar reviews to mine makes me think that the only good time to come in is a very slow weeknight."}
{"text":"They have a good selection of beer and wine with a well stocked bar. I wish they had more food options because what I ate was so delicious and I'd love to try more

I had the burger and fries and split the mussels with a friend. Burger was cooked perfectly and, even though it was a pretty straightforward burger, was absolutely delicious. The fries were perfectly crispy on the outside and soft on the inside and seasoned well. I definitely broke my low carb diet and have no regrets.

The mussels were well cooked but I thought lacked salt. My friend had no issue finishing them off with a side of sweet potato fries (the kind sprinkled with cinnamon, nomz).

Definitely want to come back to try more things on the menu like the flatbread with figs and jalapeño goat cheese, but I hope they expand the menu more. The convenient location and great ambience would make this such a good regular spot"}
{"text":"Reeks of cigarette smoke. The terrible pop music and tolerance for unruly drunken behavior are at odds with its rustic \"hipster\" aesthetic. Still, it's a nice break from the beloved kitschy nostalgia of Little Italy, fitting in without increasing competition."}
{"text":"We stopped in this past Saturday at around 7pm. My g/f had a Groupon to use. There were four of us in our party and the Restaurant was not that busy at all. It took over 20 min to receive our original drink order and over and hour and a half to get our food. Turns out they were out of my order of Spaghetti stuffed meatballs, so they brought out a hamburger and fries. Sorry but I did not venture to Cleveland's Historic little Italy to eat fast food! I personally would not recommend this restaurant to my worst enemy nor will I be returning."}
{"text":"Was looking to try some place new and close and had heard the food here was good. Showed up around 9 on a Sunday with maybe 6 people there when we arrived. No one came to our table for at 15 minutes. The server was almost impossible to track down. 
The kicker for the absolutely awful service was when we saw your food come out to the bar and the server didn't bring it over. I had to actually go up and get.my food in concern for it getting cold. 
Waited 15 minutes for a check and had to finally track down the chit chatty server to get a bill...I never wanted to pay for the meal but to be honest I paid just because I wanted the terrible experience to be over."}
{"text":"Terrible service, average food. Went here today for dinner and there were 4 other customers, yet it still took 45 minutes for a burger to come out. No explanation from the waiter and no apology for the wait, and the burger was overlooked when it came out. I asked for medium, and it was fully brown in the middle and dry. When we asked for the check, it took another 10 minutes for the waiter to bring it out. This is a bar. It should not take that long for food."}
{"text":"I like this place.  I've been there about a dozen times and it is always a nice place to stop for a beer or watch a sporting event in Little Italy.   They have my favorite beer on tap (Left Hand Milk Stout) so I will keep going.  Highly recommend it in the warmer months because of the patio areas.   Something different in Little Italy."}
{"text":"Not bad for one of their first nights open. Nice crowd and great vibe. Time to table could have been a bit tighter, and what the food lacks in authenticity/creativity, (although tasty for bar food) the vibe carries the day. Prices for the food offered are appropriate !"}
{"text":"Stopped in here for drinks before dinner at another local restaurant on a Sunday evening. We were looking for a place that was a little more casual than the nearby upscale restaurant/bars in the area. This fit the bill. 

There weren't a lot of customers on this particular Sunday evening. There was one bartender working and a couple other servers around helping the customers that were there. Football was on the TVs in the background. As with most places I've been to in Little Italy, the prices are a little higher than I'm used to around my neck of the woods.  Beers were about 6 or 7 dollars, so the three we ordered left us with a $20 tab. 

There were about 15 beers on tap with my first choice being out. The bartender made some other suggestions and was very nice every time she came by. Didn't get a chance to try any food this time in, but the bar menu showed that most of their food items were around $12, making them a cheaper option in the area. Looking forward to trying their twice-cooked wings or one of their sandwiches next time I'm in. 

Guessing this place is probably a hot spot with Case Western students on the weekend. This place also has a patio area to the side and out back that would make it a neat spot to visit during summertime. They've got a website out there but it's a dead link, so you'll have to come check this one out in real life."}
{"text":"I was aching for a hot, comfy bolognese for dinner in Little Italy. Because, you know, it's Little Italy. The first warning sign should have been that it's a tavern. An Italian tavern? Hmm. The second warning sign should have been that it was empty around 6:30pm on a Friday night. But, hunger pangs overpowered all common sense and we went inside. The best part of the meal was the wine, a nice $32 bottle of Chianti. Around the table we ordered five different dishes, including the Sausage-stuffed Manicotti, the Chicken Puttanesca, Bolognese, Eggplant Parmesan, and Chicken Parmesan. The food was mediocre at best. My first inkling that this was going to be a sad, depressing night was that my food was lukewarm and the side of ciabatta bread was amiss. Too bad the waitress never made another round to see how things were going. The Bolognese comes with three pasta options. I went for the fettuccine. Upon its lukewarm arrival, more saddening was that the chef decided to chop the pasta into little pieces. My excellent noodle twirling skills could not be used. I had to use an inordinate amount of parmesan cheese to add enough salt to the dish. Next to me, the Puttanesca was shamed for having too much salt. Apparently, the dish was served with a bounty of unannounced Kalamata olives. 

I can't comment on the other dishes. There is no way to screw up a Chicken Parmesan, but its portion size was most generous. The rest of us were still slightly hungry. Who wants to pay $6 extra for a side of pasta with eggplant parmesan?!  I peeked at the menu and here was my final sign that this would be the last time we would come here - the only dessert on the menu in Little Italy (!!!) was an ice-cream sandwich. Sigh. 

If you have some common sense and want good food, do not come here. $16 for a cold bowl of Bolognese with no pork, no bread, and cut-up fettuccine is a major disappointment. However, if you have no other options and want some good beer selections (we didn't try any), this may be the place for you."}
{"text":"Pros: location and drink selection.
Cons: horrible acoustics, bad music, limited space, over-bearing screens, and outrageous prices for what you get.  Food is regular bar fare served in trendy presentations that \"justify\" a jacked-up price.  Skip it."}
{"text":"Came back for a second time and we were again pleased. We had a reservation for four, and the same waiter who was very knowledgeable. The wine selection was fine for us. We ordered apps. The spaghetti stuffed meatballs were three large ones and were very good. The Hawaiian flatbread was delicious. The calamari was over fried, therefore very crunchy, but good.  The place is casual with the long bar on the left, and tables on the right. Patio seems ideal for good weather."}
{"text":"Went here for happy hour the other day. Pretty good beer selection on tap, and the menu was interesting. I ordered the Pasta \"in\" Meatballs, which are meatballs stuffed with spaghetti and mozzarella and then deep fried. Definitely a unique item. Good but a little dry. I'll definitely be going back to check out some of their other items."}
