{"text":"I've lived near this restaurant for as long as they've been open and every time I go there is one very rude girl who works behind the counter. At first I thought she might just be racist and not care very much for people of colour. But it seems after reading a few reviews on this place, she's a jerk across the board. I don't mean to taint the place because there is a very super sweet and helpful older woman, not sure if she's the owner or not. But she was kind and patient with customer's. So if anything, you should go and hope to be served by her. The food is good, moist and flavourful. But that one girl got under my nerves so badly I had to post something about it. And it's not even a rude undertone, she just blatantly doesn't care about what she says in front of customers. She NEEDS to be fired ASAP!"}
{"text":"This is probably one of the best Portuguese chicken places in the city. They know what the're doing here. Chicken has such a good taste and the potatoes are just delicious. Everything i've had there is great, i'd definitely recommend this one :)"}
{"text":"It does not matter how good the food is, I want to be treated nicely first of all! The service is awful, and they are very rude. They treat their customers as if they are giving the food for free. The food is worse than ok. The grill is not charcoal like in some other churrasquiras. I will never go there again."}
{"text":"The best Portuguese chicken in the area! Great portions for a very reasonable price. The chicken is moist and flavorful. The hot is not too hot and the potatoes are to die for. 100% my favourite new place."}
{"text":"I ordered the 1/2 lb chicken with rice and potato wedges and it was a very satisfying meal for $10! 

You can dine in but this place seems more like a take-out place anyway. The food is served in styrofoam containers which made it quite challenging to eat using the plastic utensils they provide. I kinda felt a little handicapped so ya, take-out is preferred. 

I highly recommend Zita's Churrasqueira, even if I can't pronounce it!"}
{"text":"Portuguese chicken...and these guys do it right! Whether you have it from the rotisserie (Espeto) or the grill (Na Brasa), both are excellent! Moist, flavourful, and always fresh. Great (traditional) sides as well.
Today I bought 1/2 chicken dinner for $11.99
see picture."}
{"text":"0 star for horrible customers service, the owner \"the guy\" is super rude, he speaks English but if you go up to him, he just points at the girls working the counter as if he does not speak the language, but I heard him speaking in English with the customers. his daughter is also obnoxious, very rude and weird, the only person at this place nice and sweet I think her name is Zita -the owners wife.

I Just stopped going for their attitude, but the food was ok, and not bad at all, and they get really busy on Friday nights so they must be doing something right.

Note: they are also Halal now.

Tip:if you do end up here, ask for the BBQ chicken to well done, I found the chicken to be pink from the inside few times, &  I did mention it , the owners daughter response was \"it is always well done\" 

Thanks for reading"}
{"text":"Went here tonight for dinner to satisfy my craving for Portuguese chicken. I usually go to another joint because Zita's is not the place for BBQ Portuguese chicken. 

The potatoes were underdone, and as everyone says the girl behind the counter is a straight C*NT. 

I asked for extra sauce because she gave me ONE tiny little container for 2 chickens. . . Um hello? I asked for more and she gave me a look and put one more. And I said, \"That's it?\" And she goes, \"one sauce per chicken and you have two chickens. There is sauce on the chicken already. If you want that much extra you can buy it for 25cents each\" meanwhile the guy she served before me bought four chickens and I didn't see her giving him a small
container for each she gave him a big tub! And free! So there's favouritism and attitude with MEDIOCRE quality food? Yeah definitely not coming back. You can keep your pathetic .$25 cent sauces and food. 

You want good Portuguese BBQ chicken and nice service? Farols on Cawthra!!"}
{"text":"I don't live in Mississauga but I used to come here everytime I was in the area. However, the last time I tried, I was a bit disappointed. The chicken tasted a bit dry and bland, and the breast meat was especially tough. The potatoes were great though. I think the price is quite good as it is a take out place and I like that everything is fresh. However, when I went, they already had a pile of chicken made beforehand in one of the warming ovens so perhaps that is why my chicken tasted quite dry."}
{"text":"Good chicken and decent sides. I love their hot sauce but they never ever give enough. I bought a chicken tray for a party and had it pre ordered. I came on time and still had to wait 30 mins. I also over heard others trying to order chicken but they had ran out. This was at 630 pm on a Saturday.  They're grills were full and yet everyone was still waiting for their order. They need to organize their service big time."}
{"text":"I would love to split this rating into 2 parts... the service and the food because one clearly stands out from the other.  The people and service is fantastic.  It's run by a lovely couple who clearly has a talent for service and charm.  They care about their place and their customers.  I'd give them 5 stars!

The food is a bit hard to rate because you get decent value but to me, it was not the best meal.  We ordered a full sized grilled chicken with 3 small sides (salad, round potatoes, and mixed vegetables).  The chicken is supposed to feed a family and I don't think it can.  We're a family of 3 and I think the 2 adults could have eaten the chicken ourselves.  It is a bit on the smaller side.  We did like how it was charred nicely and still moist inside.  That was nicely cooked.  The problem with the chicken was when we looked into the foil lined bag and noticed there was nearly 1/4 cup of oil in the bottom.  When we placed all the pieces of the chicken on a platter, more oil came off of it.  I think we had another 2 tablespoon of oil come off.  There was so much oil that it marred the flavour of the chicken and almost became inedible after the 4th bite.  It felt too heavy.

The sides are a mish mash of good value and unfortunate oily mess.  The round potato were seasoned wonderfully and not super oily.  They did give a lot for the small take out box so that is something to order.  The salad was pretty dismal.  We were given a little less than half a head of iceberg lettuce with maybe 3 olives, 4 slivers of red peppers, 1 tomato slice, and 1 cube of cucumber.  Definitely not worth the money!  The mixed vegetables was piled into the container and it was very flavourful.  The unfortunate thing about them was that there was nearly another 1/3 cup of oil at the bottom of the styrofoam container.  I wish that wasn't the case!

Food is an unfortunate 2 star but the people and service itself deserves a 5.  I hope they reduce the amount of oil used in their food and they'll be a great local place to do take out on a weekly basis for my family.  Till then, I'm still trying to find a good place for chicken take out."}
{"text":"Doesn't come close to taste of Brasa or John's BBQ, but it is pretty good. We liked their potatoes the best, except that you go there for the chicken. Since they're pretty much the same distance to us as Brasa guess who's going to get our business??  Oh, and when we went there, there was a younger woman and an older one. The younger one stuffed a few more potatoes and rice in our containers. The chintzy old lady told her in Portuguese to take some out, right in front of us!!!  Bad taste lady!!!  If you're reading this. That and your chicken is probably why you consistently have a 3* rating and the others 4* and up."}
