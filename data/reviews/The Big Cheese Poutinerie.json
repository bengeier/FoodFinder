{"text":"The Big Cheese?  I'm sorry, but this place should really be called \"Fries and Gravy\".   There were hardly any curds.  I'd give it 4 stars if the big cheese served big cheese, but they don't.  I heart poutine.  I hope they pick  up the slack.  That is all.  EDIT: You can order extra curds for $1.25.  You need to add curdsx 3 to make it reasonable.  Makes a small poutine about ~$11.  You decide."}
{"text":"As a vegetarian, I know some people will say I am not knowledgeable enough to review a poutine place; however, I have lived in Montreal & in Ottawa, where I have had many authentic plates of this Quebec specialty. Plus, I know a good curd & a proper frite when I taste one!   The pros at the Big Cheese: 1) lots of options, even for vegetarians 2) the vegetarian \"sauce\" is pretty good, a bit peppery.   The cons: 1) curds are low quality. I understand they have to refrigerate them here (unlike Quebec & Ottawa) so you won't get the full squeak, but these were still below par even for Alberta 2) 2 of the 3 times I ate there, some of the fries were overdone to the point of being rock hard. Even the ones that had been soaking in sauce at the bottom of the container were too tough to stick a fork into. The first time, I assumed this was a fluke, but a repeat episode sadly proved me wrong.  Won't be back."}
{"text":"Didn't care for the Traditional Poutine. Not enough cheese, too much gravy. Gravy tasted like it was from a mix. Nice idea, good location, but needs some tweaking."}
{"text":"Considering that this is a place that specializes in poutine I was very disappointed. I found the gravy to be quite thin and the cheese curds to be quite minimal. There was also no layering of cheese which made the second half very boring. When I asked if the Mac & Cheese Poutine was worth a try the server told us that it depended on the cook that day...I guess she was honest, but not really what I was expecting to hear. We therefor chose the standard poutine hoping that the cook would be consistant with that order.   As for the ambiance....The music was WAY too loud and my husband and I opted to sit outside where we thought it would be quieter. We were wrong...it was just as loud outside. Not sure exactly what music they were playing but it hurt my head!   I will not be going back again, nor will I try any other Big Cheese locations. Feeling sad that this did not impress given my love for great poutine ;("}
{"text":"Im sorry, it was not good at all, being from Montreal and reading my reviews and photos from poutine  from there can tell you i have had a few.  I ordered their traditional large poutine, first there was little to no curds on it and not enough gravy to call it a poutine.  i shared the poutine with my family  we all took one bite and my son spit it out and my wife and i forced it down. the gravy was NOT traditional poutine gravy it had no flavor no thickness just blah,  the fries had a burnt taste or some (taste) and not a good one,  my son refused to eat any more i tried one more bite but we ended up tossing it out :(  . i made the trip to 17 just to try it i wont be going back.  Unless you have been to Quebec to try the ones there you have nothing to compare it to."}
{"text":"Yikes!  For those that love poutine do yourself a favour and do not eat here. But, let me clarify.  They have an amazing selection, great toppings (piled high!), reasonable prices, and friendly staff.  BUT... in reality poutine shops only have one thing to do. (its not hard to deep fry potatoes and order curds in from Quebec) And that is to make a great gravy and wow do they ever miss. It is so so bland. Need I say more.... ruined my experience.  My friend tried one with the peppercorn gravy which was also - not so good.  I was stoked to go, but won't go back."}
{"text":"It's nice going to a place with all sorts of different poutine options, but I can't say that I was impressed with the food. It is definitely worth checking out with friends, but I am in no rush to head back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Okay, I admit that I have never eaten here before 2:00 am and in any sort of clear mind, but that doesn't take away from the greatness of the Big Cheese.   In essence, its fast food with a couple uncomfortable tables in the restaurant and most clientele having orders to go. Poutine is simple in nature, but add on some sauces, meats, a few vegetables (peas seem to be popular) and you got yourself...well...poutine, which is the only thing served here.   There are roughly 20 choices of poutine that come in large and small sizes. Most nights I find it hard to finish a large by myself, which at $6.99-$10.00 is an excellent value. They offer vegetarian, beef, pork, chicken combinations ect... that suit anybody, as long as you like poutine.    Here is a menu link : http://www.mybigcheese.com/menu/menu_thebigcheese_poutine_25-may-11.pdf  I am not an aficionado, but I can tell that the cheese 'curds' may not be official, however it still makes a good meal and snack. I find it helps to let the flavors settle for a bit (as I vigorously shake my brown take out box) and the cheese to melt before enjoying.  They have a condiment station with extra spices and whatnot to make it the way you like.  I highly enjoy this place and continue to work my way through the menu. Scottish Curry is quite spicy, Donair seemed bland, traditional poutine is a safe bet, but anything with Pig in the name is recommended.  Big Cheese seems to have an inviting atmosphere, is well lit and clean, which is more than I can say for some of the pizza places that I frequent late night.  Next time, I trying the yam fries...maybe even in the daytime!"}
{"text":"Giving it 4 because the toppings & fries were good. Don't go expecting Quebec style poutine. You will be dissapointed. Not even sure the cheese was curd. If it ain't curd, it ain't poutine!"}
{"text":"Great to have a place to satisfy the late night munchies.  But the service is slow and cheese curds were cold.  Sure you've got a slew of toppings but you've got to bet better organized there."}
{"text":"Walked past this place a lot and never really had a hankering for poutine. So I waited until the right day for the salty fatty treat.  The environment was pretty cool I'll admit and there were a handful of people dining inside. Didn't have a single problem with the customer service, which is a huge thing for me. And the music was great. I went with the Montreal Smoked Meat. I took note of the guy making poutine in the back but found it too awkward to watch after a while so I just kind of stared at the wall which had interesting details until my food was ready.  The poutine came with a very lovely grainy mustard and a pickle. The Meat was all right, and there was a lot. What I didn't expect based on the name, was that there would be more meat then cheese curds. I'm not sure if they all melted or what but they were hardly in there. I guess it's expensive to have \"authentic cheese curds\" in your poutine in Calgary. Another thing I noticed was that the gravy was liquid, which I did not like at all and that without the mustard I would not have enjoyed my food.  I didn't mind that some of my fries were really soft, and some were crunchy.   Oh and the \"big\" cheese didn't have that squeak that curd connoisseur's crave.   Overall I was satisfied, but I went into the place with no expectations, other then a sign that constantly reminded me about where I can get some poutine."}
{"text":"Very disappointing! I went here because they have options for gluten free vegetarians. I ordered the small. The gravy was fine and the cheese curds were OK, but the box was half empty! For more than $7 for fries, some gravy and a few cheese curds, I would expect to at least get the serving I paid for!! The customer service was also terrible!"}
{"text":"This place defiantly gave me the poutine fill I was looking for. When would couldn't finish it even better :) I had the pigasus which is bacon, shredded chicken, peas, onions, cheese curds and gravy! Deliciousness except the onions far too sweet! Kev had the donair poutine again great size but the onions put him off they were way to sweet. Will defiantly go again to try something else though."}
{"text":"Had take out but I will say the fries were soggy and definitely not the best poutine I've had"}
{"text":"I really enjoy poutine especially when drunk...really hard to disappoint a drunk!  The poutine was gross..didn't enjoy any part of it..brewsters poutine is WAY better, plus they have yummy beer...try theirs and then compare it to this crap and tell me which is better!!"}
{"text":"Took a friend who is visiting from NYC to Big Cheese, and was less than thrilled. It was my second visit, and definately not stellar.  Ordered from a nice girl at the till, she was bubbly and pleasant, after paying we waited off to the side. Another diner's order came out, she called the number, he mentions it's to go, she quickly folds the container closed, and puts it in a bag.  Our order comes up, served by some guy, I mention that it's for takeout and I get \"Yeah, it's all for take out. It's in a takeout container.\" and continued to serve up the unrequested douche-baggery. I folded the 2 containers up, and asked, albeit hesitantly for a bag. We got one, and left.   My friend mentioned that he'd never had such poor service, even in NYC. When we got home, we found they'd botched his order (asked for no onions, and got TONNES of onions), but weren't about to walk back, and deal with this dude again.  Poutine was so-so my second round, fries a bit under done, gravy was a bit different than the first time, and WAY saltier.   I'll definately go back, but not for a while."}
{"text":"This was a huge disappointment. There's nothing more satisfying than deep fried potatoes smothered in cheese and dark brown deliciousness, but I left the Big Cheese feeling like crap. It could have been because I ordered the vegetarian nacho poutine and not the traditional like I should have. Who came up with the bright idea to mix guacamole with beef gravy? In my defense, I didn't know they were going to add the gravy to it. For some reason I was imagining it was going to be similar to The Works from New York Fries, but it was so far from it. This is probably the only time I would ever pick a food court meal over something more \"gourmet.\"  Despite my gross poutine, I would give the Big Cheese another chance because there are probably better ones I could have chosen. The fries were decent, and the prices are on par for your average urban poutinerie. I find the menu to be overloaded with strangely elaborate toppings and I'm more of a simple creature. It's your potato equivalent to Tubby Dog - you either love it all, or you can only handle so much of it."}
{"text":"Yikes. I have family in Quebec, so I have been to Montreal dozens of times and had the real deal poutine. This place is nowhere near the quality I've had in Quebec. The gravy was watery and bland, and the fries were overcooked. The cheese curds didn't melt at all, and had no flavor. If you want something a bit closer to poutine you'd find in Quebec, try Smoke's."}
{"text":"I agree with other reviews that the fries were under cooked and a little to firm. The gravy also did not have much flavour. For me the gravy either makes or breaks a poutine and this was a let-down.   I purchased a large and it was very filling. I didn't finish the box but that may have also been partially due to the under cooked fries and lack of flavour in the gravy.   I had the chipotle pulled pork (hog heaven) and the pork was delicious. I loved that pork. If I could get that chipotle pulled pork on a sandwich it would make for a great lunch.   I may try it out again but I won't go out of my way to get this stuff.   Hopefully they can improve on the key ingredients to have a superior product.  Service was great and quite quick but it wasn't too busy."}
{"text":"The thing about The Big Cheese Poutinerie is that the cheese is squeeky. Like, alright poutine, but so damn squeeky.  If you don't know what I mean, check out the Big Cheese Poutinerie and find out for yourself...if you dare."}
{"text":"I don't enjoy writing bad reviews, but this place was just horrible. My partner and I have recently moved from Vancouver to Calgary and were on the hunt for vegetarian poutine. Alas, we had to look no further than our front door step as 'The Big Cheese' looked so promising.   I opted for the original veggie poutine. My boyfriend took the first bite (sneaky) and gushed 'Wow, that's hot' and not hot as in temperature hot. He meant hot as in THAT SPICE IS BURNING MY MOUTH OFF hot. I swear a whole pot of pepper was added along with a handful of chili flakes. Why? Why would you do this, my mouth is burning! Maybe they did this so you had to also buy a drink, which we did. The next disappointment came in terms of the cheese curds. There were about four on the top layer, honestly, literally four cheese curds on a LARGE poutine. The final disappointment came in the form of the fries. They were burnt (both me and my boyfriend had several BLACK fries in our 'poutine', and if they weren't blackened they were the bits of fries that no one wants to eat anyway - obviously been sitting in the botton of the deep fryer for 10 years. The worst poutine I have ever tasted.  Cheers Big Cheese for the bad tummy."}
{"text":"Good poutine. They have vegan options (but they overcharge for it). It's almost worth buying your own Daiya and adding it yourself. Daiya doesn't cost that much.  Edit: the vegan prices are fixed. I am bumping up the stars"}
{"text":"Ordered the veggie poutine. It was awful. Fries were cold and soggy! Won't come back."}
{"text":"Look. Poutine isn't that amazing or incredible. Therefore, it is not that hard to make. Find the right potato. Cut it. Add the inedible cheese by-product that is carved off from real cheese. Add gravy. Compared to southern food, it shouldn't be too hard to master. But this place seems to make such a simple dish beyond adequacy a really difficult feat. Maybe it's the overwhelming menu they set up. Perhaps they should just get the basic type of poutine \"right\" before offering over the top varieties that contain edimame or pre-packaged smoked meat.  I go in, and there's the usual half baked enthusiasm that epitomizes Calgary's service. Order basic. Fucking rip off, something like $8 after tax. I have to thank them for doing their job upon serving it to me. The fries are not fresh and I suspect they were frozen. The curds are almost non existent, and the gravy is from stock. Enough said. I won't waste your time the same way this place did. Go to A+W instead. Or Alberta King of Sub. Even District. Good lord.  17th should be restricted to good restaurants. Not pita pit and this shit."}
{"text":"Take a stroll down 17th Avenue, if you are looking for a quick bite and happen to pass by the The Big Cheese Poutinerie it would be worth your while to check in .  Just located a few doors down from the Melrose Cafe, it's hard to pass by without noticing the mouth watering aroma and the big plaid awning flaring off the building.  It was slightly crowded with a small line up which is a good indication that I had arrived at the right place.  I had been hearing mixed reviews and had to try it for myself.  We ordered two small sized poutine's, the portions were perfect for the two of us to share.  There was good flavor in both, I enjoyed the \"Notorious P.I.G.\" over the \"Veggie Nacho\".  I found the two to be a great combination, we decided it was best to go with one that was heavy and the other... slightly heavier.  Nice setting, good flavors, but eat it fast or be prepared to grab a spoon for some potato soup in a box.   Summary It's a nice venue to check out and open late on weekends.  I would recommend trying it out, but I wouldn't say it fully satisfies my craving for a good traditional Montreal poutine.  It's definitely great to see a new fast food restaurant that is unique and non franchised.  Not that I have anything against franchises, it's just nice to have some variety and competition.  It keeps vendors on their toes, which means higher food quality at reasonable prices."}
{"text":"I actually really enjoyed the meal and atmosphere here. It's relaxed, the poutine was hot and melty with plenty of flavor. The staff was friendly and courteous. For those that are trying to compare this place to others like it that they know of, let the place stand on its own. I for one am glad I didn't listen to the reviews comparing it to places hundreds of kilometers away. I will be returning, no question."}
{"text":"The poutine was not as good as I had expected.   Too many fries, not enough cheese curds!  However, the fries were delicious as was the gravy.  It was more the ratio that was off.  There are better places, but it's worth a try!"}
{"text":"I should preclude this review by saying I am not really a fan of Poutine. Nothing against the creation it's just for a snack I'd rather have a good Shawarma or Burger. However, with out-of-country friends in Calgary I though it best to share with them some \"traditional\" Canadian cuisine.   We ordered the traditional Poutine along with the Montreal Smoked Meat concoction. At $5.99 and $7.99 for smalls I did find it pricey for jazzed-up fries with a little bit of gravy, cheese and meat.   It was ok. There was nothing wonderful about it and I hardly doubt with so many options on 17th that The Big Cheese would be my first, second or third choice for an afternoon or late night snack. However, my friends and I did clean out the box and we were generally satisfied with the experience. The service was good. The place was clean. The box amazingly did not get soaked through with all that was in there."}
{"text":"Had the traditional poutine, fries were well cooked, very crispy, first time I have it, I loved the gravy and cheese... not sure what to compare it to, but I would go back there again."}
{"text":"DO NOT ORDER THE HORRIBLE MILKSHAKES. Worst milkshakes ever and the cashier had a HORRIBLE attitude. If you're miserable work somewhere where you don't have to deal with living people. Extremely rude. Wasn't that great. I would definitely NOT go back. Get fries and gravy at KFC instead. Tastes better and no attitude from the wannabe hipster cashier. Boo on her."}
{"text":"This place was not what it was chocked up to be.  I went in Thursday afternoon with a friend.  I had heard good things, and wanted to try it out. I love poutine.   The cashier was so stoned she couldn't understand a word we said to her.  My bud tried to make conversation and she just stared blankly. Did not smile,  say hello,  goodbye,  or thanks for coming.  Less actual service than you'd get from the worst McDonalds restaurant. The cook in the back looked pretty ripped too. By the time we got the food I was already discouraged.   The poutine was mediocre,  nothing I would recommend you go out of your way for as we did. I just got a regular poutine.  My friend said his tortilla poutine or whatever was good,  but he's from Columbia and just didn't want to offend me I guess.  0/10 cheese curds.  McDonalds makes better poutine."}
{"text":"It was just OK.  If you do go here, just order the small portion - the large is massive and can feed two adults easily (even big guys).  Poutine is really a Montreal thing / don't think they have it down in Calgary like they do in Montreal.  There are a lot of other good restaurants on 17 Ave though..."}
{"text":"Today was a cold and blustery day in fine YYC. Having to brave the blowing snow to run another errand and having intended to try this place out sooner, my partner and I decided this was a great day to splurge on a rich, high calorie take out food. Upon entering the building we found the interior to be very pleasing. It had a homey and folksy feel. There were some cool vintage pictures on the wall. The counter service was pleasant enough, if not overly friendly.   Why do I spend so much time telling you about my day and the decor? Even thinking about the two shockingly small boxes of vomit inducing, $20 worth of mush inside induces my gag reflex again and disappoints me so much. Recycling appeared to be important to them from the signs in the store, and that sure explains their portion size, as it means less garbage headed for the landfill. Especially in the face of how long we have waited to try this place. We ordered different kinds, they were both utterly disgusting. They both had unmelted curds and tasted probably a little better on the way up when body heat partially melted them. You will enjoy the taste of a big box fast food store much better, and I used to think that was poor quality poutine.  Today, Big Cheese Poutinery lowered the bar for us significantly."}
{"text":"The Big Cheese has improved over the couple of years they've been open."}
{"text":"Being from out-of-town we spent a lot of time searching for the best poutine in Calgary and were largely disappointed. The Big Cheese continually showed on lists so we drove downtown to taste the fare. We quickly learned that this place is a strong average. It's nowhere near the best poutine you've had (unless you've never left Calgary) and way better than the worst. Service is average, too. The girl at the counter was emotionless. Almost mute.   Who cares? We came for the food, right? Before coming, ask yourself a question. Have you been drinking or not? If you've been enjoying the scene on the Red Mile, you'll probably say this place is awesome. It's a great late night option for those hitting up the bar scene. Meanwhile, if you're sober and simply looking for a bite there far better choices on the strip.   Fortunately, the portions are fair and is the amount of toppings you'll find on the fries. The fresh cut fries can be paired with an endless amount of toppings, and enough curd chunks to make you full in a few bites. In short, if you are in search of poutine this spot will suit you well."}
{"text":"Came here a while ago, first time trying poutine, we got the vegetarian one. I like that they have a huge selection of poutines to try. Service was very poor, the workers had an \"I don't care\" attitude, giving off a bad vibe.   The food was decent; gravy was good however the fries were a little too greasy. Pricing is fine considering the portion size. It's worth a shot if you like poutine, but I will not be returning."}
{"text":"I had a veggie poutine from this place, didn't hate it, didn't love it. It was a bit expensive for what you get, and the customer service was a little less than friendly. Other than that, the corn fritters were definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"I've been around Quebec and eastern Ontario so i've had my fair share of poutine! I found the poutine here to be great, but not outstanding.  Fries: Very tasty. The potatoes used have a good flavour and the cut is great. Solid  Gravy: Pretty solid too. I had the peppercorn gravy and it had a nice flavor. I also tried the Scottish curry and that was great.  Curds: Not that great. They were pretty melted and too soft. They didn't have that fresh \"squish\" to them, although you don't always get that for every single curd. But usually when I get great poutine (say at La Banquise in Montreal), the curds are much more solid.   Service: Exceptionally friendly. They let me try the gravies before I decided and even re-filled my water! You can tell that the employees take pride in what they do and are just friendly in general.  For poutine i'd say this is a solid bet, but if you've been to, say, rural Quebec and had poutine there, then don't expect this to beat it out. But if you're used to most of the poutine you get on the prairies (shitty fries and shredded mozza cheese) then you will probably have your mind blown here."}
{"text":"Five stars hands down!  I am a proud Canadian and have had my fair share of poutines, but last night I felt like my taste buds had finally been awakened.  Word on the street is they are getting a food truck! Look out Food Truck Frenzy, things are about to get cheesy!"}
{"text":"My experiences with The Big Cheese :   Round 1 - I headed there with a couple other Yelpers for their opening day. Granted, they had opened just after a Poutine Crawl event that I had been on the day before, so at least for me they were up against some pretty serious competition. I found that their fries were a bit undercooked, but I quite enjoyed the different toppings that they had. Initial rating was, in my mind, 3 stars.  Round 2 - I was there after a friend's birthday party. It seems they fixed their issue with the fries being undercooked, but overall the poutine toppings tasted absolutely horrible. Their peppercorn sauce tasted quite bad, and the toppings were sub-par. Keeping in mind that I was drunk (and I've been known to eat pretty much anything when it comes to late-night hungries), I was quite surprised at how bad it tasted. This rating would have been 1.  Likelihood of going back? Pretty low, especially since there are other excellent places in Calgary to get a good poutine."}
{"text":"Great late night snack. Close to the bars and plenty of options!  Spent a good amount of time in Calgary on my visit and this was one of my favorites! 10/10 suggest if you like poutine!"}
{"text":"After a night of reveling and beer consumption on 17th Ave, my friends and I decided to sample some of The Big Cheese's poutines... Kudos to the Big Cheese for staying open late on the weekend.  I love poutine: It would be my last meal if I was about to die.... But it wouldn't be a Big Cheese poutine. Although the Big Cheese has a great selection of unique toppings and combinations (i.e. carolina pulled pork, sausage, sour cream, beef), their fries aren't anything special and their gravy is extremely bland. I had bites of the Notorious P.I.G., Hogzilla and Veggie Nacho. All of them had bland gravy, over-cooked meat and stale fries.  For a bigger serving, a lower price and a more traditional Quebecoise poutine, Alberta King of Subs is worth the drive to the NE. For a unique, gourmet-type poutine, try Brava Bistro's lobster poutine."}
{"text":"Poutine!  What's not to love?  Gravy..yum!  Cheese..yum!  Fries...yum! And to make this more interesting, there are a lot more different toppings/selections to choose.  I got the Cowtown poutine.  It has the caramelized onions and beef.  It was delicious.  However, the reasons I can only give it a three stars are because: - Really, how hard is it to make a poutine.  It is almost impossible to mess it up, no? - And the presentation of the poutine is quite un-appetizing.  Mind you, the poutine IS delicious, but if you just look into the box.....just not attractive nor appetizing at all.    The three stars really belongs to: - Their fries are good.  No doubt.  Just eating the fries alone, I would be happy. - Their gravy is good.  Not too thick, not too watery.  It is just right. - The novelty.  I love the idea that they have variety of selections for the poutines."}
{"text":"So I have had a hate-hate relationship with Big Cheese ever since it opened. I had tried them a number of times, just on the fly as well as post drinks, and honestly they never came anywhere close to making me happy.   Friends really wanted to stop in on Saturday night and I acquiesced to their request. Got a large classic to share between 4 of us. More than enough food for sure. For the first time they managed not to over cook the fries so they didn't taste slightly burned, or maybe they just have a new batch of oil on. Plus the gravy was actually thick and just salty. MASSIVE improvement on the last time I was in there.  They did ok on Saturday night, but honestly not sure I will ever go again myself based on previous experiences which were all mediocare at best.  Shout out to the 2 ladies working the cash register who were polite, friendly and chatty while we waited. Was great to see some smiling faces come midnight when you stop for food."}
{"text":"I do not know how people think this place is good! I've been here a handful of times and all i've ever gotten is a greasy fry, gravy overloaded mess. For those few people on here who have commented that this place was their first time trying poutine, good lord- make sure you eat at another place and DO NOT make this your last poutine experience."}
{"text":"Having been born and raised on the Quebec border, I expect a lot from my poutine for it to be outstanding. Big cheese was acceptable. It was post hockey game time at 11:00pm and the Red Mile was busy. Into Big Cheese we went for the first time. Big line-up, one guy behind the til taking orders and a true to life \"Find Waldo\" raised up in the back getting all the orders ready. Limited seating. I do not like to mess with my poutine. I got the traditional, nothing fancy no gimmicks. I like my poutine the way it was made to taste like! Hubby on the other hand got the Pigasus with chicken, caramelized onions and baby peas. Small sized portions were more than enough for each of us. I am still so full, hours later. My reg poutine was OK. The fries could have been crispier, the cheese could have been a tad more plentiful and squeaky (6 little pieces) but I Iiked the gravy. The chicken one (was that really chicken on top?) mixed with the veg, cheese and gravy was actually pretty decent. Next time I may go CRAZY and try the perogie poutine. The little restaurant itself was cute and as crowded as it was the patrons were well behaved!"}
{"text":"Food: 2.5/5 Atmosphere: 3.5/5 Service: 3.5/5 Overall experience: 3/5  (1- Terrible; 3- decent; 5- Fantastic)  After seeing pictures my friends took of a monstrocity of a poutine i just had to check out Big Cheese. Once you walk in, a small walkway guides you to the front where a giant menu board hangs over an open kitchen. After placing your order you can wait in their small dining area which could probably hold 10-15 people. There is more room in their back patio if you decide to stay and eat.  There are two sizes, small or large with about $2 difference. There portions are fairly large so I suggest getting a small if you want to avoid food coma for the rest of the day. The prices range from $7 - $10 and a choice between traditional, pork, chicken or beef products on top of the poutine. We went on the weekend so our fries came out pretty fast. We didn't have to wait for more than 5 minutes.  My bf ordered a small Traditional Poutine ($5.49 - Quebec cheese curds and poutine sauce) and I had the small Porky Pig ($7.99) with double smoked bacon, italian sausage, sauteed mushrooms and carmalized onions.  The fries were crispy, covered with a decent amount of dime sized curds, and then heavily drenched with a flavourless gravy. My Porky Pig poutine was overly salty and looked like a mess. Instead of layering the toppings and curds within the fries, they just plopped it on top of the fries without combining all the toppings together.   Overall, the Big Cheese is nothing to get overly excited for. I enjoy the novelty of having a wide variety of poutines, but the overall poutine lacked flavour and flare. I definitely had better!"}
{"text":"My very first poutine in Canada. Awesome. My friend and I shared the one with steak and cheese. Adding $3 for a larger portion was a nice deal. Very full and satisfied though I expect a bit more steak. If we weren't here at Calgary as a day trip, we are so gonna ry more flavours."}
{"text":"Are you drunk? Is it 2am? If so, grab some poutine, head straight home, and enjoy some delicious poutine in bed."}
{"text":"Big Cheese is a cool little place with tiled mosaic walls, limited seating and black and white framed photos.  The ACDC music was full blast and  needless to say very annoying.  Huge selection of toppings make the menu interesting.  I stuck with traditional, just cheese and gravy.  The fries were too dark, bitter and soggy. The thin gravy had no flavor but the cheese curds were authentic.    The Big Cheese makes a spiritless poutine and I've had better at DQ and A&W."}
{"text":"I'm thoroughly pleased with my first visit! I've been waiting several months for them to open, and now they finally have! Huzzah!  I stopped in today for some take-away. I asked the gal working the counter which one she thought I should try for my first time. She rec'd three, and I went with Notorious P.I.G. Pulled pork, double-smoked bacon, and Italian sausage. Ok, so...yum! She, by the way, was chatting and friendly and wonderful.  The fries were perfectly cooked (namely, well, but a little bit gravy-logged, which I like), the cheese was a little meltier than I would have liked, but blame that on it being take-away and there's not much to do about the encased poutine in the ten minutes it took to get back to the office.  All of the Porky goodness was great. There was a hint of a-little-too-strong vinegar that probably comes from the pulled pork, but wasn't so strong as to adversely affect the overall flavour.  I'll be more than pleased to head back to Big Cheese and sample some of their many, many other poutines! Most likely to be most often at somewhere around 2:00 am. (Forgot to ask how late they're planning to be open. I'd think they'd do late night. I'd HOPE they'd do late night!)"}
{"text":"Well they can do celiac safe poutine which is great; however, the staff didn't seem entirely confident in that which made me uneasy.  I would say that if you have had real poutine in QC this is not comparable.  Too much gravy, and not very good gravy.  Not enough fries or cheese.  It was basically fry soup.  Disappointing.  I guess no one makes poutine like Chez Ashton, if only there was one in Calgary."}
{"text":"When we tried this place out it was on a saturday afternoon when I was really hoping to stroll in here in late hours in a more belligerent state (wait are they open late?).  I decided to try out their traditional poutine: yukon potatoes, quebec cheese curds, and gravy. It tasted ok and plunked down on my gut like a heavy brick of carbs.  I regretted not being adventurous enough to try their more adventurous creations like Mucho Italiano or the NOTORIOUS P.I.G. (R.I.P. Piggie Smalls)  The scenery of the joint was slightly overwhelming, for a small space there certainly was a lot of swag on the walls. I hereby decree this place as the \"Jack Astor's\" of 17th Avenue. In truth I'm actually rating this place as three and a half stars, but something tells me I'll be asked to come back to this place again, and something tells me I wouldn't put up a fight either."}
{"text":"While The Big Cheese is no Smoke's Poutinerie in Quebec, it will do until my next visit out East.  I tried the Philly Cheesesteak.  Overall, meh.  The chips were good, but most of the flavour came from the caramelized onions, not the gravy.  And it had roast beef on it, not actual steak as in a Philly.  I would visit again, but probably wouldn't try anything with meat and mushrooms again."}
{"text":"All that is greasy and fantastic about poutine.   I came here late on a Friday night with some friends from good ole Saskatchewan, thinking I'd treat them to some of the finer things in the place we call Calgary. Well folks, treat them I did.   Three of us split the regular large poutine, and it was everything we were hoping for. Nice crunchy fries, big chunks of cheese, and delicious hot gravy.   Way to go Big Cheese! You've created some future repeat customers. I'll be back."}
{"text":"First time here - place has pros and cons. Had just a traditional poutine and fries were so over cooked and burnt. Really should have returned it. Incredibly salty dish, not sure if it was the fries or the gravy or combination of both but was huge salt overload and so hard to eat. Price was ok I think for what you get (just ordered the small) which I thought was very big/filling.  Pros: cute little place inside, cashier (girl) was friendly and nice. Place looked clean.  Unfortunately due to the extremely over salty poutine and the incredibly burnt fries, I will not be back again - it's a shame as I presumed that a place dedicated to just poutine would at least make an OK product but this wasn't even edible."}
{"text":"It should be noted that I loath poutine. I decided that I'd try it anyways just for kicks. Afterall I was quite hungry and had just come back from Hawaii, so I was looking for the Canadian experience again. They have a huge menu with loads of variations. I decided to order the traditional. Let's face it, if you can't at least make a classic poutine well then there's no point trying to make it fancier. The fries were actually really good. Slightly crisp, golden brown and flavorful. The gravy was decent though bland. I would suggest they add some XO or something to give it some omphf. The cheese curds were nice big pieces, but again kind of bland. I wouldn't even bother mentioning the cheese if the gravy was better. I ordered a large portion. It was a lot of food! I might be persuaded to try it again if they improve the gravy."}
{"text":"Yuk! Really? I'm born and raised in 514. You can't fool ,me with your overpriced poutine. The sauce is like brown water and the cheese curds have no flavor either.   Drive to Canmore and visit La Belle Patate for a real taste of Montreal Poutine"}
{"text":"Cheese curds were still solid   *sad face*   I needed my poutine fix.  It only comes one a year, so I had to take care of my annual craving ASAP.  So, here's My Big Cheese Poutinerie within a walking distance of my accommodations.  Atmosphere:  It is small, and quite dark.  One thing I don't like about dark places, unless it is at night in a romantic restaurant, is that it is difficult to see your food properly, especially if you would like to be able to see it if it is cooked properly, or if the kitchen crew may have personally customized your food without your knowledge.  Food:  I had originally ordered the Smoked Meat poutine, but no smoked meat was available.  Hmm...  Montreal flavour will have to be met another day.  So I had ordered the Maple Bacon poutine.  The large portion was great, it was good for two people.  The fries and gravy was not hot though, so my cheese curds didn't even warm through, let alone melt.  Chunky.  The maple bacon bits were in good portion, plenty of it scattering all over the top of the poutine.  Other than the non-melted curds, the maple was too strong in sweetness, the salty gravy couldn't even properly balance the two out into a savoury/sweet dish.  Darn.  All drinks are either bottled or canned.    Service:  The service was nothing to rave about.  The woman at the register seemed disinterested in taking our order, or even bothered to provide suggestions when my first order was turned down.  She even didn't care about the patrons behind us to take their orders either.  The poutine did come out quickly though (probably because the food was not cooked to order).  Mostly likely will not be back.  Sorry."}
{"text":"My Wife & I stepped into the Big Cheese for a quick meal while between errands. Both being Vegans, we were pleased to see the door menu advertised Vegan options. We both opted for the traditional poutine, vegan style. The poutines were ready quick, and were tasty. We were in & out in no time, and would likely come back. Now I'm no poutine connoisseur - I understand there's a specific true Quebec way to make this speciality, but I have no real idea how close these are to what some consider a true poutine, but to a layman, it was a fine meal. The Pros were the kind staff, the quick meal, the fact that they can do a vegan option, and that is was ready quick & was tasty. The decor was also decent. The cons were that the place was quite small & cramped, and while the vegan options were there, I believe it cost me an extra $1.50 for the vegan cheese - and by no means am I against charging extra for a speciality product with a short shelf life, but it meant that one small vegan poutine came to over $7.00. Overall though, we had a good experience."}
{"text":"I went to this delightful little place with a girl friend, and yummy! I had the Scottish something poutine, she had the nacho-something poutine.  I would definitely given this poutine a perfect score except for one thing: They DO overcook their fries. Toppings are delicious, and I have eaten poutine in both Quebec and Montreal, and this place is pretty authentic. The service was great, atmosphere was quirky, and casual, perfect to eat a load of fries.  Please don't overcook your fries! You have a really good thing going there...Keep it up.  K"}
{"text":"Terrible customer service!  Came in just for ice cream, and received such bad attitude from the server, and he even quoted us the wrong price!  Even when I pulled out my calculator to prove it to him, he still wouldn't acknowledge it and continued to give attitude.  Manager came out and was reasonable, and offered to make things right, but at that point it was such a bad experience.  It was our first time there, but will definitely never come back or recommend to friends, train your servers to work on their customer service skills."}
{"text":"Meh. Shared a traditional poutine with my bf. The fries were a bit overdone, or cooked in old oil. The gravy was über-salty, and the cheese was okay. I dislike the disposable take-away containers they serve in. Too much waste. They may have been made out of recyclable material, but I'd rather a plate or platter. Call me old fashioned, or environmentally conscious...  What really turned me off on this particular visit was a fellow patron that smelled so much like stale weed and b.o., we actually had to move to another table, so as to regain our appetite. There was also two music stations being played simultaneously, one in the kitchen, one in the restaurant, that just annoyed me.  Might be back to try some other poutine, but won't be soon, and won't be often."}
{"text":"I've heard a lot of mixed things about The Big Cheese, but mostly unfavourable. I've avoided it for that reason. But I happened upon it one evening after some drinks for a friend's birthday at Melrose, which is how I'm sure most of the poutinerie's clientele make their way there.  Despite it being busy, they managed to get the food out very quickly. I had the chicken peppercorn poutine. The fries weren't bad: not great but not terrible like I've heard in the past. Chicken and cheese curds were yummy. However, I could not stomach the peppercorn sauce - not sure what about it but I am all about the traditional gravy, apparently. So much so that I could only finish about 1/4 of it before giving up.   So, while my first visit wasn't amazing, I will be back to try again as it's not totally their fault that my choice was bad. I think it'll be the buffalo chicken or the traditional next time.  (15/30)"}
{"text":"The one they have in Kensington is definitely better. Maybe the other options would taste better but i got the butter chicken and it tasted funky. so skip that if you decide to eat here."}
{"text":"Not sure as to why there are bad reviews, but also haven't been here long enough  to know what real poutine should be like. I am just glad I found vegan poutine! There are also a couple vegetarian options.Decent price for the amount of food."}
{"text":"this was simply not my thing.  I thought it was terrible, there was a bucket of  gravy with some fries.  the disappointing thing was the fries, I could taste that the oil was not fresh and I had much better.  Please note that I am an big fan of poutine, but this was definitely not my style.  It felt unhealthy and did not sit well afterwards.   I was with the work crew and the other person that really likes poutine said it was great so take my feedback with a grain of salt."}
{"text":"Hmmmm...I like that they cut the potatoes & fry them fresh.  The gravy was good, but I don't quite understand the curds.  They add texture, but zero flavor.  It was almost impossible to eat a small due to the texture & one dimensional flavor.  We were searching for fries that had a little bit of crispness to break up the mushiness.  I would definitely recommend asking for the fries well done/extra crispy."}
{"text":"Hmm, this is weird. I've steered clear from this place on account of it's relatively poor reviews, but I finally tried it with a friend and I think that this is actually pretty good, especially given it's lower price point. As a former montrealer who has had good and bad poutine, I was pleasantly surprised with the Big Cheese.   They have a ton of poutine options, with generic ones to adventurous ones. This is the kind of place I would love to have gone after a night of debauchery, but unfortunately I don't think this place is open late. I opted for the curry, with green peas and chicken, and it was phenomenal for $7. The peas were not over cooked and mushy, and the chicken was real - and the cheese curds were appropriately melty. Loved it! It wasn't gourmet, but there is a special spot in my heart for a cheap pile of poutine. I would definitely hit up the BIG CHEESE!"}
{"text":"By Calgary's standards, their poutine is edible, and I would've had no problem giving them 5 stars, however...  their pickles, which are quite popular, and worth the $1.00 each, as they are/were LARGE authentic deli-style sour pickles, however during my recent visit, I purchased 5 pickles at $1.00 each, and as the pickles were being pulled out of the large glass jar behind the counter, I noticed that the pickles looked quite small (compared to how they normally look), less than half of their normal size, however I still purchased them.  When I got home, I tasted one, and discovered that not only were they smaller than normal, they tasted like regular dill pickles, like the ones you would get from a jar at the supermarket (ie; NOT deli-style, and certainly not large).    Shame on me for not questioning their size and authenticity at The Big Cheese in Calgary, and SHAME ON THE BIG CHEESE IN CALGARY, for not only trying to pass off these smaller generic pickles as their usual large authentic deli-style sour pickles, but for also charging the full $1.00.  It just seems like a silly way to tarnish your \"brand\".  It is also interesting to note that this was also posted on their Facebook page, and was deleted.  It's not the money, it's the PRINCIPLE :("}
{"text":"I'm from Montreal. I make my own poutine at home. I have family members fed ex me cheese curds. So I know my poutine.  The only thing this is place is missing to make the most authentic poutine outside of la belle province is the tin foil container, like the ones take out Chinese comes in.  The fired are delicious, if a little salty. I've had the classic and the notorious PIG, both of which were fantastic.  Ideal for a late night after bar/club snack. Not as good as what you'll find in Montreal, but better than most attempts out here."}
{"text":"Alright this is long over due.  I came here when this place was pretty new, after hawking it for 2 weeks they finally took down the papers in the window and I excitedly lined up for my share of POUTINE! The space reminds me of old Montreal, lots of wood and vintage tinker peices used as decor. Huge chalk board of menu items, it makes it hard to choose what to get. Really laid back, jeans and tshirt joint. Food? Sad to say, I was really dissappointed. I have to agree with some of the reviews already up.   However, since then i have gone back a few times and each time it has gotten better. More cheese curds!!! More pulled pork goodness! Drench it all in gravy!!! Hell yeh!!! They still have to work on their fries though, seems too dry or over fried. but this definately means they are improving and possibly taking our suggestions into consideration? Let's hope so!"}
{"text":"Its a hit or miss here. There's days you can go and have an amazing poutine, hot, toppings are awesome, great meal. Other times, it's just slop that a pig could eat that's barely hot. The staff are not friendly, it's just a place to grab a poutine and leave because the staff make you feel so uncomfortable. The menu does have a great selection of different poutines."}
{"text":"You've seen the sign, you've peeked through the window. You've asked time and time again \"When is the Big Cheese going to open?\" Well my friends, I have an answer for you. Today! And it's a hot little spot.   It's in the same place as the old Nellie's, so be prepared for limited seating. 9 tables in all, it's a cozy wait when it's busy. But turnover seems pretty fast so far, so your wait shouldn't be too long!  Sporting a menu of 21 different kinds of poutine, these cheesy dishes of potato gravy goodness fall into 5 different categories-traditional, chicken, pork, beef, vegetarian and the all custom built! Oh, but which to try first? My eyes skim the menu like an excited mouse in a cheese pantry.  After much deliberation, I decide on the Notorious P.I.G. (Carolina pulled pork, double smoked bacon and Italian sausage), although after pigging out on poutine during yesterday's Poutine Crawl, I opt for the smaller $7.99 portion. Good choice, Wendy, good choice. It comes in a takeout box. And it's a large portion on its own. Smothered in gravy, cheese curds and with pockets of spice.   Other items that caught my eye?  Scottish Curry - shaved grilled chicken breast and our own authentic Scottish curry sauce Donair - authentically seasoned beef and caramelized onions Veggie Nacho - salsa, sour cream, guacamole and jalapeno peppers  Now... if only there were a poutine platter!  PS... free wi-fi! Hookup to dlink."}
{"text":"They have quite the extensive menu , all poutine based. This was my first time having this treat in Canada itself. We had the peppercorn chicken, a small. Now if splitting, the small is just a snack size for two. If you're hungry j recommend getting your own. There wasn't much chicken in our poutine, so I was a little disappointed in that sense. Overall poutine is a decent dish. The environment here is pretty chill, casual, laid back. Nice place to stop in for a snack!"}
{"text":"I walked by this one of a kind restaurant and thought it was neat that we have a poutine diner.  My friend and I decided to take a peak.  We ordered the pull pork with bacon and sausage poutine aka Notorious P.I.G.  I thought it would taste spectacular since they specialize in just poutines, but quite frankly new York fries is probable better.  The only difference is they have a wide range of toppings such as AAA beef, chicken, pork and a few more ordinary mix-ups that you wouldn't normally add to your fries.  They use a typical beef gravy, much like something that you could whip up at home yourself.  The poutine left a sour after taste, my friend suspected that it was red wine.  I was curious to find out what it was so I asked the cashier.  I brought the poutine up to the counter and saw the look on her face, she was probably hoping that I wouldn't complain. She said the sour after taste came from the south western sauce marinaded with the pork.   $8 for a small poutine is a tad high but it's loaded with meat so I guess it's worth it if you're a meat lover. The place is small and cozy so it's perfect for a small snack on a cold day, not so much a hot day because it was rather warm so I couldn't imagine how stuffy it would be on a hot day.  This shack would definitely curb your enthusiasm if you're a poutine lover, not so much for me."}
{"text":"Late night heavy snack! hahah. Had the peppercorn steak poutine, good flavor with a bit of kick from the peppercorn. Person in front of my had the Notorious P.I.G. and it  looked soooo good! I will get that next time! :)  My fries were crispy, and cheese melty and the ratios were all good."}
{"text":"Really lousy service and poutine to be honest.  Someone please explain to me what the big deal is with the Big cheese poutinerie...   Terrible"}
{"text":"I haven't had poutine in well over fifteen years, so I decided that I should order the traditional poutine rather than venture outside of the box on my first visit.  The small order is plenty of food but unfortunately, it was nothing to brag about.  It was hot and the cheese curds somewhat melted, but I thought the fries were overdone, the gravy was pretty flavorless and it was too salty as a whole.  If I ever go back, I'll try something else.  It was busy at 10:30pm on a Saturday and mostly full of twenty-somethings.  My spouse and I enjoyed watching the old school He-Man cartoon playing on the flat screen for all to see."}
{"text":"First time trying poutine, got the traditional. It was good! Service was fast but not that friendly."}
{"text":"Being a former Montrealer, I've been raised on poutine during my teen to adult years.  You need the right type of squeaky cheese.  The fries have to be fried twice. The sauce has to be brown and rich. Well... they got the cheese right.  And they do have some pretty imaginative combinations that does make the poutines there interesting.  But the base of it all, is still the sauce and the fries.  And I can say, they've completely messed that up (and CBC reviewer John Gilchrist completely agrees with me when he did his own review in 2011).   Look, the fries are done twice for a special reason.  The first time locks in the flavour.  The second helps enhance the crispness despite the gravy soaking in.  And at even the most basic places in Montreal, such as the legendary Lafleur hot dog and fries chain in Montreal, this is always done with FRESH potatoes cut right there on the spot.  I walk in, and what do I see?  Bags of McCain's-like frozen fries bags being opened and then cooked once.   Then came the sauce.  Basically, it was lifeless, with little real taste except maybe too much salt.  Back home, the poutine gravy is made with some sort of beef base, and has a great flavour on it's own.  Hell, some people I know even drink it straight with their meals.  This was just a sauce that wasn't too far from powdered mix.   As Mr. Gilchrist said, and I whole heartedly agree, if you're going to make yourself the gourmet poutine place to go in Calgary, then follow the basic steps at least.  If you need inspiration, go to Canmore and try the poutine at LA BELLE PATATE, a poutine easily matching some of the best Quebec has to offer.  Just make it right people!"}
{"text":"As far as poutine goes they are OK.  There's really nothing too special about their poutine except the fact that they have a large selection of additions.  The service is good and the price isn't too high.  I found that the fries could have been a bit crispier for my tastes."}
{"text":"I don't care what anyone else says I love this place! I adore the fact that they divide their menu into sections such as chicken, beef, pork, and vegetarian poutines. They are very generous with their portions, they load up on the curd cheese (which is vital) and don't cheap out on the gravy, or whatever sauce is on your poutine. I think that their prices are highly reasonable, $8 for a box of deliciousness (then again I've paid $15 for a poutine once).   The staff is friendly, quite knowledgable on their poutine and that is important. The place is small but there's loads to do along 17th so why not just take it to go?   I recommend the chicken Scottish Curry for all you wondering what it would taste like ... It's pretty awesome."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and my most recent visit here was to bring my out of town family for a taste of Canadian fare. I had the beef donair Poutine and was very satisfied with my choice.   Starting with the fries, they were the home cut style fry, which is probably one of the best cuts for a Poutine. They were crisp and still had substance on the inside. The seasoned beef and onions were delicious and had a hint of the sweet sauce flavour that a donair ought to have. All around a delicious helping where the small size is good for two.   I will definitely have to come back here to try more of the flavour combinations. Definitely a great late night after bar snack as well!"}
{"text":"The biggest thing that irks me about this place is that they're a complete rip-off of Smoke's Poutinerie in Toronto (http://smokespoutinerie.com/Default.aspx). I did my research before writing this review to see if there was a connection between the two businesses but there doesn't seem to be.   Complete with plaid, an eerily similar menu, and a black and white character plastered all over, this has the complete makings of Smoke's. There's only one thing different here: The poutine isn't as good.  My first trip here was in early June, not long after they opened. The fries were soggy and the gravy wasn't hot enough to melt the cheese. I chalked this up to them just having opened and was willing to give them another try on a future trip to Calgary.  I came back this weekend after a night out with a friend. I thought that maybe some slight intoxication might make things better for me here. Not really. The fries were better and the cheese melted but it still didn't taste that great. I'd probably give the poutine here a solid three stars, but never anything more."}
{"text":"First time in Calgary and the fiancé and I had to stop here. Contrary to other reviews, we received exemplary service from the guy at the register. Wish we could remember his name, but strawberry blonde with a pony tail :) We had the Notorious P-I-G, which if you're a pork lover, it's for you. I'd rather try the corned beef with mustard and pickle or the hamburger one next time. They also have a macaroni cheese brat I could see myself enjoying. Don't miss out!"}
{"text":"I definitely liked the feel of the big Cheese with their limited seating take out style setup, defaced old photos and folk tunes.  However after being initially blown away by the menu of 20 different poutines, I was left alittle underwhelmed by a serving of their Notorious P.I.G.....I mean it had everything about food that I love (aka greasiness and meat) but their seemed to be something missing as well as the flavours kind of clashed.  But that being said,  that was just one item and with 19 other poutines on the menu I must make a return visit...for now the 3 stars are pending."}
{"text":"Horrible!! Stoned and hung-over staff do not care what they are serving you. I paid $10 for a soupy watery poutine that was not edible. I took it back to the counter and told the staff who went back to texting on her phone rather than helping me. I would advise against this place unless you are hung over and need Denny's style grease to soak up alcohol. Not appetizing at all and wasted my money."}
{"text":"Before I went vegan I would always get poutine from here and it was soooo good. I decided to try the vegan poutine and was expecting it to be disappointing, but it was actually really good  even without real cheese (and it's awesome that they include vegan options). I had a slight problem with my order (I paid for extra ingredient and it was really lacking in what I ordered) but the owners went out of their way to make it up to me, so it's clear they care about customer satisfaction. If you want a poutine, go here! Definitely worth it."}
{"text":"I know it's the wrong part of Canada, but we wanted to get some poutine on our ski trip to Alberta and BC.  The Big Cheese certainly fit the bill, offering more varieties of poutine than one person could ever try.  We had the Notorious PIG, which was rich enough I think I could only justify eating it at the end of a big athletic trip."}
{"text":"I was quite surprised when strolling down 17th and stumbled upon this little restaurant. I've been looking everywhere for my beloved viande fumée poutine in Calgary for quite sometime. Unfortunately, they didn't seem to hit it right and seem to skimp out on the necessary ingredients, they don't use enough cheese curds, gravy, fries and smoke meat. Too bad, I guess I'm just going to stick to making poutine at home   It's a very small place maybe seats less than 20 people and can get crowded on weekends and nights."}
{"text":"Jade Moore is such a delight every time I go. Which is often. I look forward to seeing her because she always cheers me up after a long day.  The food is great and so are the new milkshakes.  The store is clean which is great since I have a cleaning business so I know!!Lol. She always asks if I want a drink which brings up sales I'm sure.  Keep up the great work and I look forward to eating there again as I always do! Steve from #getalifecleanerinc."}
{"text":"I have been twice, I have eaten twice and I have loved twice... it's a fast food poutine place so if I walk in expecting delicious poutine and I get that and more - WINNING!  Most people have seen this place.. It's relatively new (last year ish), its small (seats like 20 ish) and its tucked away by Melrose on 17th ave... about 15 feet to the left (ish). My first thought when I went in was HOLY LOTS OF KINDS... so as my brain is trying to comprehend what I want .. Nacho poutine? Pulled pork? Philly cheese steak? REGULAR? Cowboy? Dessert Poutine? Steak? Shoes? Sink? I'm confused... too many choices. Needless to say, what we had we loved - which I believe was the pulled pork and a steak one.  The reason I am writing this review is because when I returned last weekend I was near ready to order something when I saw what the person in front of me got - and my eyes couldn't comprehend such beauty. A Mac and Cheese poutine. The back-story is this... I'm addicted to mac and cheese in all forms, so to see my favorite thing in life ON TOP OF a poutine my heart skipped a beat. My order had to be changed immediately to this flavor. It's a busy place, with a decent line for 2am on a Friday, all seats filled and the aroma of grease and cheese filled the air. They sell pickled eggs and pickled \"pickles\" (?), which was \"interesting\", they sell T shirts and they sell pop. So it's really a poutine place.   The beauty arrives. Its heavy, smells amazing and it's hot and gooey. A creamy, super cheesy, hot and fresh mac and cheese piled thick on a really good poutine like they do best. The fries are brown and crispy and hot, the sauce is great and the cheese curds and perfect. This is one carb overload that is HITTING.THE.SPOT. This is prob the best poutine I have had in a while. Or.... It's the beer? I need to go back very soon...which my waistline will not appreciate."}
{"text":"Just went to the Big Cheese for a post-drinking snack (yes, on a Monday). The man wanted the Philly Cheese Steak poutine so we shared a large.   Then my eyes got a glimpse of their large jar of pickles!   $1 for a pickle..  Oh I'm doin' it!  The pickle was great, not as crunchy as I'd like, but its hard to find a large yummy pickle anywhere in the city.  The poutine itself was interesting - the beef was overcooked/dry, but the cheese and red peppers were delicious.   It was a large portion for 2, and didn't finish it.  The staff was great, and it had nice decor.   Overall I enjoyed it, likely won't go back unless I have a pickle craving."}
{"text":"Had porky pig routine it's good. If you don't like salty stuff might not enjoy it as much Parking is hard to find since it's at 17th ave The serving look small but it's enough eat for the regular size They put lots of meat in it too which is good."}
