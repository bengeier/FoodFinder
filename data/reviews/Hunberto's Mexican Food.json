{"text":"Driving by and saw the sandwich boards out advertising a $2.99 breakfast burrito special. It's 7:10AM and the doors are locked! Not a good way to gain customers."}
{"text":"Very good tacos - good quality tortilla and the carne asada was delicious! I also really liked the rice and beans. Besides that, I had a tamale and it was only ok - it seemed microwaved. My friend had the enchilada and said it was too salty but otherwise very flavorful."}
{"text":"Me and my family love coming here! The breakfast burritos are to die for and the service is top notch. We always come Thursdays and love the personal experience with the owner. They take the time to get to know there customers!"}
{"text":"Found this place by accident but it has good food and really great service. Only thing is you can get tired of their food pretty quick nothing too special."}
{"text":"We really wanted to like this place. This place fits the definition of over rated! There wasn't anything wrong necessarily, but nothing of our experience was worthy of a 5 Star review. 
It looks and feels like a standard
 \"fill in the blank\"-BERTO's

The food was ok. We ordered the carne asada tacos, beef rolled tacos, and a quesadilla. Everything was average or a little better maybe. 

I really am not trying to say anything negative about the place. I would eat there again. It just would have to be someone else's idea!
All in all, with so many great mexican food options in the valley, Humberto's needs to step it up if they want to stick around! I wish them well."}
{"text":"Amazing food, whenever I am in town this is my go-to place for mexican food. Better quality than any filibertos BY FAR. The service is great and the food is made quick so whenever I'm in a rush this is my place to go to. Worth every penny."}
{"text":"Always VERY FRIENDLY Family owned and operated AWESOME food!!!  I love their grilled chicken (most places boil it)  and you can get it in anything!  Ive never seen or had grilled chicken in a taquito/rolled taco...EVER!  My family and friends we've brought here also love it!"}
{"text":"Ate dinner combo here last week it was the closest the homemade that my grandma used to cook for us chicken Asada rice and beans"}
{"text":"Great breakfast burritos for cheap! I had a bacon breakfast burrito this morning. After tax, the price was $3.22. Bacon, eggs, potatoes and cheese, delicious! Amazing self serve salsa, take what you need."}
{"text":"Ive been here 4 times now and their food is good and they never dissapoint. Try this place they have good food, good service and clean shop. I always get the fish burrito. Not greasy, not to much tartar sauce and  like how they have coke in bottles with real sugar."}
{"text":"By far THE best \"fast\" Mexican cuisine in the East valley. Their food is consistently very, very good! Please support this local eatery!"}
{"text":"Small place I have overlooked. Friends recommended it and I'm glad they did. Good food. Friendly staff. Comfortable restaurant. Biggest burrito I've ever seen!"}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a try for lunch and was not disappointed at all. Food was fresh, clean and full of flavor. Tortillas were delicious. Small business/establishment but big on taste. Highly recommend you give it a try. Lunch was so good, I ordered a vegetarian burrito to go to eat later."}
{"text":"I was not that impressed with this place.  While the food was average at best, I was not too thrilled when I found out that the restaurant adds a .50 charge if you want to use your credit card.  And, to top it off, when I got home, I realized that the cashier overcharged me for my food."}
{"text":"Loved the hash brown burrito.  Went there for the first time on Sunday and will definitely be back.  The place is very clean, the guys working there when I went in were very nice.  The burrito was huge!  I got my food to go but like I said the place is very clean so staying there is another option."}
{"text":"This place has the most delicious burrito I have ever had! I ordered the super burrito which has everything and I couldn't believe how huge and great it was. First time ever going and definitely won't be the last! The owner was so sweet and even gave us free chips for it being our first time!"}
{"text":"Great choice for quick inexpensive casual Mexican food! It is easy to miss just driving by but it is definitely worth stopping in! The salsa bar is especially great and I love the carne asada, rolled taco combo!"}
{"text":"First visit here, but it is a very typical taqueria format. The place is not terrible, but with many other better options around town, it is really only good if you are close and want to stay close. The salsas at the salsa bar and the carne asada in the California Burrito lacked flavor. I am sure there are other menu items that might have been better, but staples like salsa and carne asada are benchmarks by which I measure a place like this and you would hope at least those would be good. Again, not terrible, but not great."}
{"text":"I thought this was going to be a crappy place like Filiberto's and it is absolutely is not! The food here is so good. Way better than what I expected. The horchata they have is homemade and I can never pass it up. We've sat in a few times too and it was a great atmosphere with dining room type tables rather than cheap plastic ones. Highly recommended for some great Mexican food."}
{"text":"Read a lot of reviews for this place saying that it is good and it is my husband had the carne asada nachos I had a chicken chimichanga out of guacamole today a little bit disappointing but the front counter girl apologize for this she gave me lots of sour cream on my chimichanga which made me happy husband stated the steak was a little overcooked and chewy portions are huge plan on taking some of it home for another meal we will be back"}
{"text":"Have gotten a few burritos here and they have been so yummy, their green sauce is delicious! The Service is a tad slow but it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"First time here. The selection of food is excellent and they have Jamaica and Horchata. Yum. The portions were huge, the service is fast and friendly and the place has consistent customers so it must be good."}
{"text":"First time in! Family owned. Paula took our order and answered all of our questions about different menu items. I was so impressed with her sweet customer service & the pricing is greatttt!!!
Definitely my new place for carne asada and right up the street ;)"}
{"text":"For just moving from San Diego, I have been on a (rather desperate) search to find genuine taco shop food. It has been quite an exhausting quest around Gilbert, until this place... I found it. I love this place and their food. Their breakfast burritos are to die for and had many other menu items as well which never left me disappointed. Taco Thursdays... amazing. This place is delicious, friendly and quick. I found my new home away from home Mexican food joint."}
{"text":"Stopped in last Thursday for the .99 street tacos and ordered about a dozen carne asada.  For the price they were tasty but not sure I would pay full price. If your looking for an inexpensive street taco than the Thursday deal is for you. Don't get me wrong the tacos were good just not the best I have had."}
{"text":"My go to place for my weekend breakfast burrito. Hash Brown burrito is by far the best. You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Great taco shop, order at the counter kind of place. We had breakfast burritos & they were big & delicious. The tortilla tasted fresh & there is a salsa bar. The staff was super nice too."}
{"text":"I paid $9.00 for the two beef taco plate that came with rice and beans. The food was on the lower edge of okay taste wise. I could have lived with that if the portion hadn't been TINY. I ate everything on the plate and felt like I'd had a snack, and not much more. Anyway, if you want this type of food Filiberto's is a better bet. Larger portions, and while not gourmet, it has about twice the flavor of this place. Disappointed."}
{"text":"This is certainly NOT Cheap mexican food with large portions of over seasoning or huge gobs of cheese. this is the real deal in mexican cuisine. I have tried several dishes and enjoyed them all. My favorite is the Macha breakfast burrito. I now order it on a plate with no torilla to keep the carbs was down, but with the tortilla and some of the \"red\" sauce they make there it's a fantastic way to start the day! The people there are friendly. Stop and and try this small family owned and operated quaint mexican restaurant. You should be all smiles!"}
{"text":"Surely disappointed. I ordered their ceviche tostada which was okay, too much sauce and not enough shrimp. Tostada was amazing though. Carne Asada burrito was very similar to Filibertos. The steak was too choppy, almost minced. It definitely could've used more pico de gallo and less guacamole. The hibiscus drink was so yummy! And the reason for the 1 star? OUR REFRIED BEANS SMELT AND TASTED LIKE CIGARETTE ASH. Almost like someone dumped an ash tray into the beans. If you work in the food industry (smoker or non smoker), WASH YOUR HANDS!!!! First & last time we are ever coming. I wanted to like this place so bad but this was just sick and disgusting. As a non-smoker, I am able to smell cigarette smoke/ash from miles away. My kids (who usually down refried beans in 2 seconds) refused to eat it before even trying it (thankfully), so I went for a bite and as I put it up to my nose, that's when I got the whiff of cigarettes then intentionally smelt the rest of the beans and sure enough... My jaw dropped to the ground in shock that a place can be so unsanitary. This mama bear was not happy. Don't waste your time here."}
{"text":"Great breakfast burritos. I have been there on multiple occasions, and enjoy the food. The only reason that I didn't give them 5 stars is because we have been overcharged twice."}
{"text":"I was waiting for my car to get brakes replaced and saw the good reviews here. I ordered a chicken chimi.  It was good but not great.  The tortilla was not as crunchy as I like so it could have used an extra couple minutes in the deep fryer...hey if I'm eating deep fried foods may as well be crunchy.  I like the chicken since it was cubed instead of the usual shredded.  However there was not alot of chicken in the burrito so I would suggest they add more filling.   Place is clean and comfy.  The only other complaint I have is the cheap plastic ware most of these places use.  Would be nice if they had real forks and knives but not a deal breaker for me."}
{"text":"This place is great!  We went on a Sunday morning and had breakfast burritos.  They were large and oh so yummy!  It is an order at the counter type place, and the restaurant was very clean.  The price was very reasonable for the size of the burrito.  I am looking forward to going back to try other menu items.  I would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Been coming to this place ever since they have opened.  They have some of the best burritos in town.  Their quesadillas and combo plates are all very good as well.  And I havent found a better green salsa or breakfast burrito anywhere else.  I highly recommend trying them out!"}
{"text":"We were looking for traditional, maybe this was a little to traditional for us.  This place seemed to have steady traffic and the staff were very friendly. They definitely cater to patrons of their homeland and they seem to enjoy it. For us it was a bit of a hit and miss between our 3 orders."}
{"text":"Hunbertos is THE place to get delicious authentic Mexican food in Gilbert! Fast friendly service and quick turnaround time is what makes Hunbertos one of my absolute favorite lunch spots. If you love breakfast burritos come to Hunbertos to get the hasbrown breakfast burrito, best breakfast burrito I've ever had!"}
{"text":"I was craving a bean and cheese burrito \"enchilada style\" like I used to have back home. I saw that this place had chimichanga's that they made that way, and they were happy to make me a bean and cheese one. It was so good! I also really liked the jamaica. Excited to come back."}
{"text":"Went over to try a different place and saw all the reviews, was not disappointed!  Grabbed a chorizo and a hashbrown burrito for me and my wife to go.  Chorizo was spicy, delicious and overflowing with flavor.  My wife who had the hashbrown is a bit more harder to please and she took the first bite with a very happy look.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Staff was very friendly. 
Both menu's are a little difficult to read.
Food is good but no different than a Filiberto's. 
Good value. 
Pro Tip: Check-in with your phone for a free drink! Horchata refills are not included!"}
{"text":"I had no idea this place was located here. But I was tired of filibertos low quality food and craved descent Mexican food. So I gave this place a try and it is really tasty, high quality food! I recommend this place for sure"}
{"text":"Not only the food was great. I totally forgot my wallet on the table there when I ordered to go. I didn't realize the wallet was gone till I got home. It was about 45 min I just noticed it was gone and just my luck, I came back to the store and they where holding it for me when I got back! Talk about good customer service!!! But the food is overall amazing! I had a carne asada quesadilla which I recommend!"}
{"text":"Probably best breakfast burrito place in Gilbert. Everything tastes fresh, and the bacon wasn't chewy! Also had a side of beans, and they were tasty. Definitely will be back for the breakfast burritos. 

The place was clean, soda was good (I feel like most of Mexican fast food have nasty soda), and the staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"I've eaten at probably almost every Mexican restaurant in the East Valley and this is the one I continue to frequent. Thursday they have street tacos for .$99, and this includes both carne asada and carnitas which most places don't include in their specials. The steak is actually gristle and fat free! It's wonderful!  Keep up the great food and quality Hunbertos!"}
{"text":"So... By recommendation of a fellow yelper, I finally had a chance to try this place out. And I'm glad I came!

I had the mini tacos aka street tacos and they were made as they should be. I really enjoy that they stick to the traditional method instead of tryimg to add om unnecessary items.

My daughter had a shrimp taco, excellent! And a bean n cheese burrito. Well half of it, its a big burro. Very tasty!

All in all a very great 1st experience. We will come back and order something different to give them a more thorough review"}
{"text":"Very loyal local customers here since hunbertos opened, but unfortunately all that just changed.  As their burritos get smaller and smaller,  apparently so does their idea of custumer service. My boyfriend ordered our breakfast burritos and was told there was a wait,  but he counted 8+ burritos being ORDERED,  COOKED,  and SERVED AFTER he ordered while he sat there.  It was like they lost his order.  Accidents happen,  but no apology made for the 30 min+ wait for these burritos that were so filed with potatoes, you wouldn't know they were supposed to be bacon! So sad."}
{"text":"You know, for what you pay, you can't go wrong at Hunbertos. Very authentic, without the hoity-toity-ness of a fine Mexican restaurant. A great pop-in place to get a quick bite to eat. We enjoyed!"}
{"text":"This is pretty much like going to Filiberto's was hoping for a little Mexican food place hole in the wall. Not much cheese on the beans the food was mediocre. A little overpriced as well for get your own food clean up your own table party of $26.. and no margaritas."}
{"text":"We woke up on a Sunday morning craving breakfast burritos.   OK...*I* woke up on a Sunday morning craving breakfast burritos, and managed to convince the wife and kids into getting out of bed to go on a burrito quest.   Luckily they did, and we found this place.  

It's pretty good.   I got the steak and egg, and the wife and kids got the bacon and egg, and the sausage.   They were delicious.    Really similar to other fast food-ish Mexican restaurants

We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Love this place. My family eats there every week. GREAT breakfast burrito specials before 10am every weekday. Can't beat a $3 giant breakfast burrito."}
{"text":"So...first I want to start by saying my entire family loves the food  here. The staff is always friendly and the wait is usually not long. Second Do Not order the Diablo burrito unless you want your face to be on fire! We have ordered it before,  but this time it was peel your face off caliente! Woo...hoo! HOTT! On another note you can feed a family of 4 for about 30 bucks and my kids are never full, but they never leave hungry when we come here."}
{"text":"This place is love at first bite... so far everything we have tried is wonderful.  The staff (I think owners) are super friendly, and grateful for your business.  100% recommend :)"}
{"text":"This was a bit of a hidden gem - the food was delicious and very reasonably priced! I had the carne asada salad and the proportions of meat to lettuce to toppings was exact and very filling! I will definitely be coming back here again!"}
{"text":"My husband ordered take out from here after another one of my recent surgeries. We drive by it all of the time and have been meaning to check it out.

I ordered a Carne Asada burrito with rice and beans enchilada style and my husband ordered a Carne Asada burrito with just meat and cheese. We also got a side of chips and guac to share. The total came to somewhere around $19. 

My burrito was seriously bigger than my head. It barely fit in the to go container. The first few bites weren't very good, but once I got passed the tortilla and got into the real stuff inside, it was pretty good. 

The chips and guac were also huge. It came in a take out container with cheese and guac drizzled all over. The guac was pretty decent, but we barely made a dent in them.

Overall, I think we will come back here. We definitely want to try the $3 breakfast burritos we keep seeing advertised. The tortillas are really good, so I imagine they will be as well. As for the Carne Asada, we will probably stick with the other \"bertos\" to get our fix!"}
{"text":"If you're from the East Valley, you know everyone is crazy over Los Favs or Filibertos. They're good and all, but Hunberto's is hands down the TRUTH. 

The flavors in general are more complex, the meats have more flavor to them, and taste much better than the generic carne asada that you'll find in every burrito place all over. The salsas are pretty good, but to be honest, nothing special or notable. The pickled carrots and jalapeños are some of the better ones that I've had, being that they still have a nice crunch, while being deliciously vinegary. 

For me, other than the better overall flavor, the star of Humberto's is the Patron burrito. If you're like me, you love places that PACK on the meat. After all, that's the best part. Well this is one of their \"special\" burritos, which has bacon, ham, carne asada, I believe potatoes, but I may be mistaken, and Pico de Gallo. Now you may be thinking that sounds like a disgusting salt bomb, but I promise you it's amazing. It's everything I would look for in a burrito. The traditional but amazing base of carne asada, an occasional salty crunch of bacon, and nice bits of ham, give it a different but nice switch in taste and texture, all without leaving you fearing for gout (would not recommend if you really do have gout, or are at risk )."}
{"text":"I've eaten here several times each time trying something new and this place never disappoints. The staff are always friendly and the prices are more than fair. The Diablo Burrito is really good but they're not kidding when they say it's hot."}
{"text":"Bomb a** Menudo but get it early because once the pots gone your outta luck.  Great Mexican food without that New Mex Tex influence that's found so common in the AZ.  Prices are great and the personnel are helpful and friendly.  Great Salsa!!"}
{"text":"Pretty good Mexican food for fast food.  The people working here are very friendly.  Recommend."}
{"text":"I drove pretty far to try this place instead of the usual Los Favoritos by my house just to see whats up. They seem to have pretty good specials here to save some money. The only thing memorable about this place to me is the tortillas. They have those buttery tasting tortillas. To die for. The rest of the food was pretty good just not memorable honestly and not worth me driving far when Los is across the street."}
{"text":"Excellent Mexican.  In my estimation, the best of the \"bertos\". The carne asada is flavorful and tender in whatever dish you order.  Tortillas are fresh and so yummy.  The kids love their rice and beans (although I haven't tried them). The restaurant is small but always clean. The tables are big and sturdy and beautiful. The service is always friendly and quick. Definitely the go-to place in Gilbert for quick Mexican food."}
{"text":"I've driven passed this place for years but didn't realize this restaurant until my cousin placed an order when I was out hanging with him. He ordered the Carne Asada Fries and I instantly got hooked. I've only tried that from their menu and I LOOOVE it so much! Super flavorful, good & even distribution of meat, cheese, onions, beans, tomatoes, and guacamole all over the fries. They make it fresh so the fries are always extra crispy as well! I definitely recommend that if you want to try out this place (but I'm biased bc I've only had this but OMG so good, hahaa!) My sister's boyfriend thinks the meat here is better quality than Filiberto's. I also recommend getting the green salsa they have in the small little salsa bar! It's delicious. Perfect amount of spicy-ness and flavor."}
{"text":"Great breakfast burritos. The brown salsa was delicious. The music makes it a great authentic atmosphere. Recommend for good mexican food."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place and I finally made the commitment tonight. 
I'm a mexican food fanatic and love cheese enchiladas, I get them any chance I get. 
I was expecting this place to be similar to Los Favoritos or Filibertos.....a mexican fast food. 
It was what I had expected, but the quality was not up to par. 
They cooked my enchiladas in a styrofoam to go container in the microwave. 
The menu had great options, and I will return to give them a second chance."}
{"text":"I have always driven by this place on my way to drop off dead batteries or picking them up from a battery place next door. Then I had read a review on one of the community websites. Today coming back from work decided to step inside, I was greeted by the cook who is busy at her work area located near the front entrance. She was mature and very friendly. I wouldn't be surprised if she is the hefe. That's mean person in charge. I had my order taken right away by a clean-cut, young man who could have been her son. The place is small, clean with nice touches. A small donkey cart on the window sill, pictures of some of the dishes on the wall, and even a plaque from Mexico. There were several groups of customers talking in Spanish sitting down, several flat screen tv's on the wall with a Spanish soap opera and it felt like a another place other than Gilbert, AZ. It was a great atmosphere. I ordered the super burrito. Aye chihuahua! Not only was it generous, tasty but the price was far less than a regular burrito you would get somewhere else. It wasn't made fast but it was made fresh. I enjoyed half of it and saving rest for breakfast. Thank you Humberto's of Gilbert. I'll be back soon."}
{"text":"Had lunch here last week. 
Again, check this place out if you haven't already. It's such great Mexican Food.
I'm a HUGE fan of the rolled tacos (still could use a little more meat in them). So reminds me of a place I use to have them when I was little! Brings back tons of memories in each crunchy bite! LOL
The Carne Asada Burrtio is really flavorful, the meat is marinated just right & is really tasty!
Customer service is average.
It's a little pricey, but well worth the cost for the experience.
A big plus ( in my book) FRESH Guacamole!! It's superb.. 
Note: each day of the week they offer a special. When I was in on Thursday the offer was if you purchased a combo meal ( with rice and beans) you got a free drink. Generally, these daily deals are located on a board out front as you walk in!"}
{"text":"Great Mexican food, breakfast burritos ate awesome as is the super burrito. Music from kitchen is a little loud."}
{"text":"We ear here quite often and so far they don't disappoint. Always great service. So many choices that I haven't tried. Kind of stick to my favorites. Taquito plate, carne asada tacos, tacos al pastor, menudo. Good stuff!!"}
{"text":"so good. always manage to overeat when i go. not fancy and that's part of the charm. your plate is going to be full and not just full of lettuce. the food reminds one of eating at a family member's table."}
{"text":"My first and last time here. Two stars only because the cashier was great. I ordered a super steak wet burrito with no potatoes. As the chef was preparing my burrito. The cashier (female) went to him and said something. I'm assuming she said no potatoes because he started picking them out and angrily throwing them to the side. Then to cover up whatever potatoes were left I seen him get a large spoon full of beans and throw it on top of whatever else was inside. I get to work and start to cut the burrito and it's hard to get through. That's when I noticed my burrito had TWO tortillas. There's barley any meat so I guess that's why they add potatoes as a filler. I literally had to pick through this mess of tortillas. It was lacking flavor and just a mess. I would never go back."}
{"text":"This is the best Mexican food in The Phoenix Metropolitan Area.  Very authentic.  It's not fancy.  Just great food and a great value!"}
{"text":"Ive been to Mexico and this place is the real deal.  I got a Super Burrito and it weighed probably a pound.  They have a salsa station and even had the carrots with jalapeños.  Everything tasted great and their tortillas are made fresh."}
{"text":"Love the ceviche here!  Great food now and nice owners. Place is clean and their food is fresh."}
{"text":"This place is close to our house. We have been here twice; its a little more than just your hole in the wall quick Mexican food eat. Its nice and clean inside; plenty of seating and staff are accommodating. We have had the street steak tacos; they were good but not a favorite. My brother went with is and he got a quesadilla and lived it. I AM kinda picky about Mexican food; depending on where you are from you know there is a huge difference on what you are accustomed to. Being from Chicago; this place is great for a cheap eat but not my favorite. I would recommend trying them as the prices is great and atmosphere is nice."}
{"text":"I have been going to this place since they opened. Taco Thursdays $1 tacos is the best deal around and they are delicious. You won't find a better mom and pop place around that serves better tasting food. Eloisa one of the managers always says hi and is very kind to me when I go in. I would highly recommend this place to anyone that would like quick fresh good tasting Mexican food."}
{"text":"BEST MEXICAN FOOD! I had the chile verde burrito & chips with guacamole the food was fresh & tasted so good! Best salsa I've ever had & to top it off their customer service they were so nice & treated me like family. I will be recommending it to everyone I know. My new/favorite spot!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! I love the owners because they've always been friendly and courteous to me and the fam! When the hubs picks up take-out, I'm always called out for not being there, haha! But, we all make it a point to do eat there more than just pick up food. Now for the awesome part - the food. Portions are so generous and filling. We have our go-to's: carne asada torta (flavorful beef inside a toasted bolillo bread), 2 taco combo plate (daughter loves the shredded beef) with yummy rice and beans, fish burrito (2 of my sons' staple here, and they're huge!), rolled tacos with guac & cheese, the gigantic \"wet\" chimichanga (my preference is chicken), and the carne asada french fries (over-generous amount of fries, covered in onions, pico, cilantro, cheese, guac, & sour cream)  - kids devour this in mins! My personal favorite & the hubby's is there weekend menudo - so filling, so clean tasting, and when you add the toppings, it just enhances the awesomeness even more! Go for the people and go for the food! Nom nom nom!"}
{"text":"Wasn't too sure about the place to be honest. Thought it was going to be just your typical, run of the mill Mexican food but dayuuuuuum, this place is DELICIOUS!  I had the #2, 2 tacos, rice and beans. Fairly priced at about $7. I got the chicken and was not disappointed even though I'm not a fan of meat these days! The red sauce was spicy and just added in the tastiness of it all! Definitely try it out (even if the front lady is a bit mean)."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing. The staff is super friendly. We come here for take out nachos and they ALWAYS load it up with their tasty meats. I moved here from Texas and this is my favorite Mexican restaurant. The meats here are seasoned to perfection."}
{"text":"Love the breakfast burritos, the taco Thursday 99 cent tacos are the best!! Quick, delicious, inexpensive...win!"}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in town, hands down.. 

I go there for their bacon breakfast burrito with hash browns every chance I get. It's also a plus that I live close to it!"}
{"text":"Sorry, but they just heated my food up in a microwave right in front of me. It was good food -- chile relleno with rice and beans. But they nooked it to like lava hot, like only a microwave can do.

I stopped in after a meeting at the coffee shop next door. It was like 6pm, and the place was empty. Should've been a warning sign to see it that empty."}
