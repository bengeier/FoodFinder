{"text":"I took the oyster as appetizer. It was freshly arrived that morning. Both taste and texture were just excellent. The sea bass dinner was great too. At last, the black sesame ice cream wrapped up the meal in a fantastic way. The restaurant setting is both business and family friendly. I've been there discuss business with my friends at lunch and took our kids out to enjoy nice food there."}
{"text":"I simply love this place. The rolls are inspired and the fish is always fresh. Also pretty nice decor. This is a very tasty and consistent place that I frequent time and again."}
{"text":"Very good quality sushi. Ordered the Salmon lover combo which had 3 different rolls, they were all delicious, also had Yuzu tea which was a good balance and not too strong. The atmosphere is really nice, well designed interior, friendly staff. A little pricey but definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Had the lobster dish here. It was alright but the mashed potato and vegetables it came with were tiny. Considering the price of the dish I would have expected a bit more food.  Overall I didn't think it was that special and worth the price compared to other sushi restaurants I've been to."}
{"text":"I had heard that the sushi at this little place was good, but had never ordered from there before.  Last night we had takeaway from Rollian and it was some of the best, freshest sushi that I have ever had.  So much better than the \"all you can eat\" places that have sprouted up all around Leaside.  Absolutely impressed by the quality of this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Great quality and fresh sushi. The menu has a lot more interesting dishes than just the usual sushi/sashimi/maki rolls that a lot of Japanese places offer. I recommend trying the balsamic tuna appetizer. The unagi sushi, a favorite of mine, was also particularly good here. The service was very friendly and pleasant and the atmosphere was great."}
{"text":"A wonderful place that not many people may know about yet. The fish quality is wonderful, and presentation is perfect. Innovative takes on traditional sushi fare make it a pleasant surprise. I'm a fan of their lunch combos, but the regular menu offers great soups and other options. The staff is friendly and welcoming, and the dining room is contemporary and spacious. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Great sushi place, very fresh food, good service. We ordered the spicy trio and it was amazing"}
{"text":"I live near Yonge and Eglinton and have tried almost all the sushi restaurants in the vicinity, and I am kicking myself for not having noticed such a hidden gem earlier. Rollian Sushi is at Bayview and Eglinton, 10 min bus ride from Eglinton station. It looks very trendy and upscale, but you will find the staff is very down to earth and friendly. The best part of Rollian is the FOOD! The ingredients are very fresh, the presentation is elegant, and most importantly, the taste is amazing! I love their spicy kamikaze roll, volcano roll, scalop butter yaki, unagi sushi (not overly salty or wet). The rice they use in their sushi and maki is perfectly seasoned (not too bland or too tangy). I'd rather spend more money here on quality food than go to a sub-par ayce place. I will definitely go back to try the rest of the items on their menu. I highly recommend Rollian Sushi."}
{"text":"This place was great, there were several items on the menu I have never even seen before at the run of the mill standard sushi places around the city.  The sauce on the Shrimp Bangkok Roll was delicious... if you love mushrooms you will love this.   Server and chefs were very friendly. Food was fast and delicious. Great place I would go again and order take out from here."}
{"text":"Attentive service, pretty good quality sushi, good looking dishes, eclectic atmosphere, fair prices. Ordered the Noodle soup and sushi boat for 2. Was recommended to come here by a neighbor and we were glad we went. There were couples and families dining in, and people doing takeout. There were some regulars there that the servers recognize so that's a good sign!"}
{"text":"I went there early Saturday around 6pm.  The restaurant only had two other tables seated but the waitress took 10 minutes to come by.  Another 15 minutes to get our drinks, then our meal arrived as we stood up to walk out at 7:15pm.  There are way too many good sushi places in Toronto to try this place again."}
{"text":"I've been both for lunch and dinner, many times. Always fresh food, great friendly staff and awesome ambiance. Wonderful sushi. Wicked bonus is they always have the best music playing! And the wooden plates to serve are sweet!"}
{"text":"The service and food was great. I liked how their rolls didn't have too much rice. The appetizers are awesome. The crunch noodle soup is so simple but so tasty and the kalbi ribs are perfect - cooked perfectly and not too sweet."}
{"text":"Great service, great sashimi, the best rolls in town. You definitely get what you pay for. Love the atmosphere in this sushi place too... A modern feel to it with awesome background music. A must go for authentic sushi"}
{"text":"The salmon roll and the green dragon rolls were yummy. Place was clean. And empty when we got there so everything was done fast. The staff knew the menu well, able to cater to ingredients limitations. Would go back again !!!"}
{"text":"Ive always wanted to try this place but didn't get a chance until recently. I've had takeout from this place for dinner and lunch a few times. The first time I ordered I was nicely surprised. This place has authentic sushi and fresh fish. Combos have great selection of fish. If you're a discerning sushi eater you will know what I mean. Lunch combos are great. A bit in the pricey side for sushi but worth it if you're into quality and taste. Finally good sushi in this part of time that stands out from the crowd."}
{"text":"First time here and definitely will be back!   Food is tasty and fresh.  Parking is not too difficult since it's located in the plaza on the North-East side of Bayview and Eglinton.  A lot of the LRT construction has moved further east so access is much better than before.  Good service and good food.  You should look it up if you are in the area."}
{"text":"The highlight of this place is really the excellent service.   While the food was good, it wasn't spectacular, but then so was the price - pretty cheap, given the area.   Won't go out of my way to repeat, but if I'm there - sign me up."}
{"text":"Great service !!! Great sake !!! Great food !!! Very clean !!! Rolls, delicious ^^ must try ^^"}
{"text":"We have been going since it opened. Fresh fish, lovely presentation, friendly staff, unfortunately we always get the one miserable waitress and it totally kills the mood of our lunch. Every time she's just as miserable as the last. She clearly doesn't want to be there. It's a shame because we won't be going back anymore to endure her rude, unfriendly, pouty service. Too many other options! We went back again out of convenience and time constraints. Different server, just as miserable. Wow. I really wish they take note of this, they work hard, let someone else do the serving! Will really go out of my way to go to another local sushi place. Too bad."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious and fresh! We went yesterday and I had 2 cooked rolls, my husband and son both had sashimi. The fish is really fresh and I love that they provide a tiny noodle soup before the main dishes. My son drank his soup, had mine and ask for more! All was approved by a 3 year old. The beef I had was really tender as well. They have this amazing house made ginger tea as well."}
{"text":"I have not posted a review in over 2 years and wanted to provide an update. Rollian is a neighborhood gem. The quality of the food is definitely above average. They have added some new dishes including a Salmon avocado poke bowl, Shrimp Bangkok roll and Bulgogi Bibimkap. This is a lovely family owned restaurant with warm service. One other thing...so many restaurants are \"loud\". At Rollian you can hear yourself talk while enjoying a great meal!  https://www.tripadvisor.ca/ShowUserReviews-g155019-d6616361-r252830851-Rollian-Toronto_Ontario.html#"}
{"text":"I am so mad at myself that I didn't keep track of the rolls we had.  Sorry about that.  We stopped in here on our way from the Ontario Science Center back into downtown Toronto.  The atmosphere was nice and the sushi chef was friendly but our waitress was just... present.  She wasn't unfriendly but also not friendly either.  Business like.  Rollian was very quiet on a Saturday afternoon for lunch but we didn't mind.  The view out the window wasn't bad either.  The sushi was fresh and we didn't have to wait long which was good because we were really hungry.  We aren't local to the area but would definitely come back if we were nearby for the tasty food.    Hopefully the waitress is a little more cheerful next time!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times & the place is alright. The menu has a nice selection. The staff is friendly & the service is fast enough. It's a nice local place for family's. If you're in the area I would stop in."}
{"text":"The good: I was actually surprised how fresh the sushi was! My group ordered the large boat (64 pieces of sashimi and sushi, comes with two hot appetizers). All the pieces were pretty good. Ordered the shrimp tempura as the appetizers and they were hot and fresh :) the boy was enough to feed through 5 hungry adults.  The bad: the price was a bit up there but you do pay for the quality. Turned out to be about 25 a person.  The ugly: service was a tad slow but there was only one server and she was good at what she did.  Neutral: good for groups. Sunnybrook employees get extra 10% off."}
{"text":"Very nice & clean place. Great bar area too. Sushi is fresh and delicious. Service is friendly and constantly good! A bit more expensive than regular places. We go there often and enjoy the patio!"}
{"text":"The sushi lunch combo was great and fresh. Balsamic tuna was served with sliced orange on salad. This was probably our favorite dish that we ordered today. I wouldn't recommend the jaken sushi (round sushi of salmon and tuna with teriyaki sauce). It wasn't anything special. The interior decor is nice."}
{"text":"This place desperately needs another server. The food is So fresh and creative! Loved the sushi and the soup at the beginning. However, I always leave being annoyed about the service. The poor girl that is trying to serve everyone is ill equipped to handle all of the tables by herself. It is def hurting their business."}
{"text":"The tea was lukewarm and so was the misogyny soup. My lunch was china's hi and the portion wasn't big.  Overall I could think of better place to have sushi."}
{"text":"I'll be honest that I have not tried a whole lot of items on the menu. I'm basing my review on 1 visit having ordered Oyakodon. The Oyakodon itself was tasty, but the portion was a little on the small side.  I found their rolls overpriced IMHO, but you might disagree and say: \"Well, what did you expect? It's Leaside.\" Maybe, I'm not going to argue this point. Their rent might be too expensive to afford lower prices or their foot traffic is not enough to afford lower prices. Who knows. If their maki and sushi were $2-$3 cheaper, I think they would hit a sweet spot. I would definitely be more open to coming back.  Overall, I do not claim that my review is representative of your typical experience at Rollian. I like their interior and their maki / sashimi might be very tasty. They just seemed overpriced to me, so I skipped them.  Service was good. No complaints."}
{"text":"Was there several times and always satisfied with atmosphere, food, and service. They have great selection of sushi and rolls. All dishes looking as a piece of art. Love this place."}
{"text":"Second time here and second time amazing:-) Great service and DELICIOUS food!!!! Relaxing environment!!! The menu has a couple of surprising items too!! Oh and the ginger tea was soooo good:-)) Go, enjoy, you'll be happy you did!"}
{"text":"Great sushi- fresh and presented beautifully.  I had the maki lunch which was filling for $15.  I will definitely be back for dinner.  Side note- the bar is lovely and there are some nice wine and drink options. Consider coming here for drinks and cocktails with some appetizers too."}
{"text":"Rollian Sushi is a good neighbourhood sushi joint if you have craving for some Japanese food when you are in Bayview and Eglinton area.   There are not too many sushi restaurants I have been to in the area that has a patio! Even it overlooks the parking lot, it can be an enjoyable experience to dine out when the weather is nice.  I came here after the lunch rush so I was the only one in the restaurant for a quiet lunch. Lunch Special starting from $14, at this price point it is above average for lunch. At this price point and with all these 5 star reviews, I did have a high expectation.  Chirashi & Soup ($15) has this awkward plating with some pine leaves as deco? The fish generally was ok but quite standard. Nothing really wow me. I am not even sure I would order a chirashi again here...  Maybe rolls are better option? It is after all call \"Roll\"ian Sushi."}
{"text":"We walk in hoping to get sushi takeout but decide to stay as the place looked so pretty and inviting. Also, it looks bigger on the inside! Server was really nice. There was only one server for the whole restaurant on a Thursday night. But service was still pretty fast. Food was delicious. We really enjoyed how everything was presented. We had the Love Boat plus extra things on the side. Will definitely come back and partake in more sushi another time.   PS: Its so nice to have this restaurant in the crazy intersection that is Eglinton and Bayview! You can drop by while waiting for traffic to move."}
{"text":"One of the best casual sushi places we've been to. High quality sushi and great tasting, very fresh and well presented. We've been several times now. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the service is not great. We had to keep calling the waitress over to ask for plates, spoons, tea, to take plates away, etc. Also quite unfriendly and looked as if she didn't want to be there. It kind of ruins the experience. Although we will come back for the food."}
{"text":"Less then stellar. Ordered the chirashi lunch, really small pieces, tuna was not fresh at all and smelly, everything else was not special. Did not like the quality and quantity was small.  The tempura in the roll was not warm and felt like it was made hours before being put in the roll. Also slow service. Waitress didn't even come once to refill our drinks"}
{"text":"The fish was really fresh and the food really good. I got takeout but I was happy all the little containers were good quality and didn't leak everywhere. I'll be going in for sit-down sometime soon because I think it was great! I must say though, I had the spicy salmon appetizer (sashimi) and I didn't like the spicy mayo. I think it would have been way better with a wasabi paste because it overwhelmed what I'd say was amazing quality fish."}
