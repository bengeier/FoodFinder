{"text":"I don't know if it was the day we went but definitely did not get the experience all the other reviewers seem to have had. Overpriced, over spiced, slow service, unpleasant atmosphere in my opinion.  Chips were too salty to eat, salsa was gelatinous?! My husband's carne asada burrito had no distinguishable flavors, rice was under cooked, meat was over cooked and didn't taste like meat, just spice, inedible, he couldn't finish. At least the cashier was a sweet girl with an infectious smile, best thing they had going for them on a Sunday afternoon. Definitely will not be going back or recommending."}
{"text":"Ordered 1 burrito at 640pm. Didn't get it until 708pm. Way too long. Don't be in a rush. Food was good though."}
{"text":"Their homemade crema and sauces are just amazing and remind me of real Mexican street food where the vendor makes everything fresh. I tried their 2 dollar taco, but the burrito bowl with the Carne Asada was what I ended up with.  This place used to be in Cleveland Heights but is now in Bainbridge."}
{"text":"I tried this place out on a recommendation from a friend, and was very happy with the food.  I have to say there is a flavor about the meat that is very different from what I'm familiar with.  I got a huge nacho plate and can't imagine how anyone can say their food is tasteless.  I gave 4 stars because the ambiance is lacking, but other than that, I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place after Paco's closed down.  Sadly the menu is confusing, the food is mediocre, and when I asked why I'm waiting 27 minutes for 4 tacos I was told they make everything from scratch.  Unless they were picking the cabbage I can't imagine any reason to take so long as there were only 6 other people inside & half were already eating.  There were people just milling about in the kitchen area looking somewhat lost.  They really need a experienced line cooks to expedite the process. I'm guessing this is a family operation with no experience.  If you've seen the show Restaurant Impossible you know how this story ends.  Sadly, we wont be back unless it improves drastically."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place as I am a native California and lived a number of years in SD.  The atmosphere is a little bland and generic- plus the rusty furniture and leaks in the ceiling do not help.  The staff is friendly but does not seem to be knowledgeable about the food preparation.  The menu is very extensive - too many choices which is confusion to customers.  Also, not enough description of what is actually in the menu items.  Photos on the menus or boards would be nice.  The menu makes the service extremely slow because it takes a long time for the staff to explain the menu and for people to make a decision.  We decided to order fish tacos which anyone who has ever lived in or visited San Diego knows that this is a regional specialty.  They are really amazing when prepared right.  These were very soggy from too much dressing and the mango-pineapple salsa did not complement the spices in the creamy sauce.  It was very unappealing from a flavor perspective and the combination smelled off.  Tasted like they are using prepackaged spices and condiments instead of fresh.  Also, was expecting shredded cabbage on the tacos as the menu stated but instead had shredded iceberg lettuce. The guajillo corn side was disgusting- chewy and ice cold and did not taste right.  (I had asked upon ordering if this was a hot dish which is traditional Mexican). After I complained about it I was told that it not a side but a \"topping\".  Why is it listed as a side order option? We ordered two combos which included 3 tacos, a side and soft drink each and the bill came to $26.  We will not be back.  A previous reviewer was right on the mark that the menu needs to be more simple (maybe less selections) and better prepared. Owner needs to make sure that their staff tries the food so they can understand the preparation and what it tastes like so they can recommend.  Restaurant 101."}
{"text":"Went with friends who highly recommended but...Worst problem was staff did not seem to know what they were doing nor at all helpful with the confusing process of ordering. It took us quite a while to figure out how & what to order. The food was ok but didn't live up to what we had expected. We are also originally from CA & what's tacos without Beer?! Well no liquor license and we are not soda drinkers at all-doesn't quite cut it, haha. We were hoping for much better, disappointed.   Actually, if you want much better tacos locally, go to the Chagrin Falls Heinens! I have had their fish tacos twice now and my husband had their chicken & carnitas tacos-Delicious & Excellent!!"}
{"text":"This is supposed to be a fast food restaurant, but each time I've found myself waiting at least 30 minutes for my order, along with all the other patrons.   On my last visit, my two very hungry children patiently waited while our order took 40 minutes. And they were missing half our order once they brought it out.  No one there knows what they are doing. I will not be back."}
{"text":"This place makes me wish I could give less than 1 star. I don't even know where to start. We've tried getting take out from here 6 times and each had been worse than the last. The order always takes forever, it's incorrect, and somehow cold. The last time was the final straw. It was really salty and there was something really hard in the burrito that broke off a peice if my tooth. I accidentally swallowed whatever it was but I'm quite certain it wasn't food. This is overall the worse restaurant experience of my life. Don't waste your time, dollars, or health here."}
{"text":"I'm all for supporting local, independent restaurants, but this will not be one that we visit again. We heard \"San Diego tacos\" and having been to SD and knowing the fresh flavors their tacos offer, we wanted to check them out. I'm not sure what tacos in San Diego inspired this \"food\", but not only the worst tacos we've had - we were debating at dinner if it was the worst restaurant-served food we had eaten.   First, the fried shrimp taco was topped with ... wait for it ... cocktail sauce. It was one of those weird dining moments like when you take a sip of soda expecting to have Dr. Pepper and instead get Diet Coke and you're thinking \"huh??\". I thought it was going to be some sort of salsa/chile sauce. Nope, cocktail sauce. And, not even homemade. It had this tinny aftertaste. Gross.  The other fish tacos were topped with shredded cheddar and iceberg lettuce because they ran out of the chutney that tops their seafood tacos. It didn't help the cause ...  The chips were so incredibly grease-laden, we couldn't even get past 2 or 3 of them without feeling sick. The only redeeming quality of that portion of the meal was the chili we got to go with the chips. It had a fresh taste to it and a nice heat/spiciness. Not sure why that same fresh flavor couldn't translate to the rest of the food.  Finally, ordering off the menu was extremely confusing. Their taco concept is based on customization and the ability to create whatever kind of taco you want. There were two menus offered at the order counter, one of which we didn't even understand (it defined all these international flavors, then had a waiver at the bottom). The service was horrible, but I don't entirely blame the staff. Given the complexity of the menu, it's no wonder they're struggling to keep up. Here's a tip - don't lead with allowing customers to build-their-own. Offer some killer combos, then say \"don't see something you like? build your own!\" As we were returning our menu, we passed another couple frustrated with trying to figure out how to order.  We ended up tossing more than half our meal. Such a disappointment since we were looking for a new taco hangout since Paco's Tacos closed shop."}
{"text":"After my third visit I'm comfortable with awarding a five star review.   Dinner consisted of Mahi Mahi tacos, grilled chicken nachos, and a burrito. Everything was nothing short of outstanding.  Note: Initially I believed the ordering process to be a bit tedious but this appears to have worked itself out."}
{"text":"What a great find. Found this place after driving through the area. Really loved their Classic Taco and i also got an order of their Nachos which were excellent! You can tell they just opened as the decor is not much to write home about. But the food is excellent!"}
{"text":"Awful! Terrible! Disappointing! Rip off! Overpriced! We waited 30 mins for our food. We could have gone to an authentic Mexican restaurant & been served faster, better food and not paid this much. Portion are small, food was bland, service was terrible. Get it together! Or this will be yet another restaurant that fails in the plaza!"}
{"text":"Probably the worst mexican food I've ever had. I'm from the San Diego area so I was under the impression that it was going to be similar to like a Miguels Jr or something..... this isn't even on taco bells level. If your going to have a San Diego theme style of food and claim authenticity why is there not 1 Mexican working there. Secondly the steak has an sweet bitter taste to it just horrible.               The rice was mush and taste like garlic. My son had pollo oaxaca that was gross and salty. People if you want an authentic mexican food this is NOT the place for you. I waited 25 mins for my food the service sucked and the food was even worst I wish I could give no stars.        The owners could not have ever lived in San Diego ever. Please don't wast your time or money. I hope this isn't the same restaurant owners that failed in Cleveland..... I'll look into it."}
{"text":"My wife and I are repeat offenders of this place as it provides great food in the perfect quantities.  The owner, Kevin, and his staff are personable, the restaurant is clean and the food is always highly satisfying."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were very excited to try this new place as we live in aurora and kept driving past it. Staff is very pleasant. My boyfriend got the shrimp and fish taco. Shrimp taco was good and flavorful however it was small. Fish taco was bland and all you taste is pineapple. I got a quesadilla I designed myself. It lacked toppings (you can only choose 3 and they aren't given out in high volume), and it was super soggy. We also ordered the chips and guacamole. The chips were super salty and the guacamole was thin in consistency, somewhat watery and again super salty. I wanted to like this pace but do not recommend."}
{"text":"First visit was great (wet burrito), second visit, I ordered something different and it was terrible.  I decided to not count them out, so the third time, I ordered my original wet burrito with steak.  The burrito was ice cold and there was more charred grit from the grille than actual steak.  The owner was very apologetic and offered a full refund and would replace my meal, as well as the other meals that I'd ordered which were equally cold and terrible.  The next day, we ordered again, were told 10 minutes, 25 minutes later, we're presented with the completely wrong order and when we notified them, they said they were busy and we'd have to wait another 20 minutes for them to remake the order.  The attentive owner at this point refused to speak to me, and stayed in the back.  Definitely won't be back."}
{"text":"Awesome. Seriously good food. My three kids loved their food (tacos, chick fingers and quesadilla) and my wife and I went to town on ours.  I had the Rollo Prava with canitas. Delicious!  Clean place, nice people, and all around a great lunch."}
{"text":"It's been hit or miss so far.  I've had two great experiences and one horrendous.  I went during off hours my first time and the carne asada Tacos with authentic 2x hot smoky red sauce were excellent.  Second time was delivery off hours of a very of a simple burrito and set of Tacos; also very good.  Third time took family during peak evening hours and waited 30 minutes and all meals were screwed up.  I gave the manager some feedback regarding improving operations, e.g., less items on menu, get rid of the drive through and delivery service for now.  Work on timeliness and consistency.  I hope these guys succeed; we need a good taco joint, and they need a good operations manager."}
{"text":"I agree with the other review.  Food is very good but portions are small on the taco fillings for the price.  Carne Asada and shrimp tacos are delicious.  Menu and ordering system needs to be simplified.  Suggest checklist pad that is used by places like Barrios (pictured on Internet). Owner and staff are very pleasant and efficient.  Have only been there twice but will go again."}
{"text":"I grew up in California and lived there for 46 years!  This is not authentic Mexican food.   Puréed  guac?  Are you kidding me?  The food is very underwhelming.  Our chips were stale, and the guac was horrible.  We had shrimp and fish tacos.  Meh...no seasoning, no salt, just bland. The service was ok, but I didn't expect it to be a basic take out type of place where you order up at the counter.  if the food had been great though, that wouldn't have mattered to me. Also, I think they are remodeling.  Is this a new place or what?  Because it felt undone.  The bathroom could have been cleaner etc. Just not my kind of place at all.  Won't be going back."}
{"text":"Found this little gem on social media and glad we did. Stopped in for a late dinner. First, they are remodeling so ignore the decor or lack of it. Owner was super friendly and checked on us to ask if we needed anything. You basically pick your main dish - tacos, quesadillas, burritos, etc. Then pick your protein and there are lots of choices! Try the fish taco - you won't be sorry. Carne asada was solid and carnitas was flavorful. Lots of different condiments, salsas, etc. So much to try. Everything is cooked fresh and staff was friendly. We will be back."}
{"text":"Another great experience here! This is probably my 15th time and ive been trying to alter my choosing of items each visit. Today I had the chicken tacos and was blown away! The chicken had the perfect mix of marinade and spices. Great service, amazing food, fair pricing whatvmore can you ask for!"}
{"text":"I've been impressed with the variety, flavors and food here so I do keep on coming back. However, I have to say that the service has been disappointing me more and more lately. There is no longer any excuse that orders (for my past 3 visits) are made and placed wrong, and while I understand being a new restaurant, that the menu and recipe will change... but the consistency has been lacking - and I find myself surprised each time eating here, not knowing what to expect. Also, to the new staff up front, please check your attitude in serving customers.  To customers - If the manager is not around, be wary.  I do love the food here but the service needs to get better."}
{"text":"This seems like a popular place. The menu was overwhelming to me. It may have just been poorly laid out. There aren't many tables. My husband built his own burrito and I got 3 enchys. The ingredients seemed fresh. My husband liked his burrito but we both disliked my enchys. He felt they had a sour taste to them...and we aren't talking about the sour cream. As I write this my tummy hurts and we aren't even 5 minutes away from the place..."}
{"text":"Good SW Mexican food. No cheap but good.  Some of the best taquitos of have had in Ohio."}
{"text":"Delicious!! Fresh ingredients...friendly staff and they take pride in their product because it shows In the amazing flavors"}
{"text":"I ordered a catered lunch from here on 6/13/17. I requested the order to arrive between 11:15-11:45 am for a 12 pm luncheon of 20 people. My order was delivered at 1:50 pm after making several phone calls and getting different stories from different people each time at the restaurant. I have ordered catered lunches from here before and the food is ALWAYS good, may not always be the most presentable for luncheons but nonetheless I would expect to be more valued and not charged for something I still have yet to receive an official receipt/invoice for. Not to mention that the food miraculously was still delivered piping hot and some of the order was missing and not evenly portioned. I'm quite sure I was lied to because they forgot about the order. To make matters even more disappointing I have called there almost every day for a week and no one will take my call  and the manager will not reply to my emails.  Inexcusable customer service San Diego Taco Factory."}
{"text":"Literally the worst restaurant experience of my whole life. This is my first ever Yelp review, I told myself I wouldn't write reviews on here.. but this place really compelled me to do so.   Now listen, I'm a server so I know that these reviews sometimes aren't fair. But seriously. This was awful.   First off, the workers made me feel very uncomfortable. They were all smiling and giggling like there was some joke I didn't get. I went with two friends. They ordered right before me. Their food came out in about 10 minutes. My food took 40 minutes. It was 3 tacos. I ordered 3 of the specialty tacos, but there's literally a whole page of them to choose from in the menu.. I didn't realize it wasn't a normal item to order.   Please don't get me started on how they tasted. Who the hell puts carrots on tacos? Like just raw stick carrots that come out of the prebagged mix lettuce. It just wasn't okay. The only one I liked was the orange chicken taco which was basically chicken nuggets and lettuce. But hey, it was the only one I actually finished. It had been 40 minutes, I was starving.   With times like that, they should just make it a dine-in restaurant. It's very awkward going to the counter to order then sitting in the dining room staring at the register and waiting for your food for 30 minutes.   Please don't waste your money unless you like bad tacos, waiting forever and an awkward atmosphere."}
{"text":"This place is lauded as the \"best tacos in Cleveland\".... if that is true, then Cleveland is one sad place.  Tacos were very, very, very bad. I am from Texas and there is a Mexican on our team -- these tacos were easily the worst that we have ever had! If you are with a group, expect your food to come out at different times, and read the menu very carefully. Bad service aside, the tacos were GROSS!! They are trying to reinvent the wheel -- it doesn't need to be reinvented!"}
{"text":"I have been here a number of times, and today was no different.  I went for a late lunch of taco's.  They were simply outstanding!  Carne Asada and Chile Mole tacos could not have been better.    Why the 3 stars - they still have not gotten down the ordering side.  It just takes too long even for someone like me who has been there a number of times.  Get behind someone new ordering, and you could be waiting 5 minutes just to order.  The second reason for the lower rating (from my initial 5 star).  My Chips were stale and my Guacamole was browning (old).  They are slipping on the details that brought me in.  Great people and great tacos - but that does not make a meal.  Sorry to see a favorite go down hill so fast."}
{"text":"I have been here twice and I love there tacos.  They are yummy.  Not Chipotle yummy or Taco Bell yummy.  A special type of yummy that had me dreaming of them for lunches and dinners.  The guac is kinda interesting and I haven't decided whether I like it or not.  Go there.  Do it.  You cannot regret a trip here for Machaca authentics.  Lard me!"}
{"text":"This is my first time in, just a quick lunch stop with my mom wile shopping. We both LOVE tacos so I was excited to see a new place. The building is clean, however it could use a sweep. The menu is extremely \"eccentric\" meaning there is some weird stuff that you would never have thought to put on a taco. I'm adventurous, but when it comes to my taco i am a purest. Tortilla, meat, cheese. The staff is extremely slow. I had a few questions but I decided not to ask simply because I didn't wanna stand at the counter any longer. While waiting for my food a few ppl came in and left because they were standing around for awhile. We ordered chips and guacamole and my mom ordered 2 shrimp tacos and I ordered a shrimp taco, the LA and a fajita chicken. On corn tortillas (flour is awful). The chips are huge and waaaay to hard, the guac was flavorful but missing the chunks of red onion and tomato, it was beat to a pulp almost liquified. I like a lil chunk to mine. My shrimp taco came on flour but it was delicious.. the LA was on two mini tortillas both were great. The fajita was pretty big, the chicken was tender and the veggies were ok, I will say the tortilla became soggy from the creme and sauce from the meat, it was piled with lettuce which I didn't enjoy and picked off. The downsides for this location is the slow staff and the massive menu of strange tacos. Will I come back? Yes. It's one of those places, you gotta know what to order and it will be great."}
{"text":"Stopped in while out shopping, was very good got Taco Salad w/chicken, steak quesadilla & a couple Soft Tacos everything was brought out at the same time and hot. Will be back to sample some Fish Tacos next! Manager Jeremy was very polite and attentive he stopped by our table twice to see how everything was."}
{"text":"Oh my... where should I start!? Well, let me first tell you to stay away. This place is ridiculous. No one there know what they're doing or what they're talking about. Everyone is oblivious. Huh? What? I don't know... How about ask your MANAGER who's walking around doing nothing while overhearing you not make any sense. Im not sure how it's so difficult to take an order or make simple tacos for that matter. I'm from the San Diego area and this is NOTHING like the tacos there. I've gotten food poisoning from this place once and I decided to give it another try...bad idea. First off, my tacos today were all wrong. Like many other occasions. Why take my order? How bout make me whatever you want seeing that you aren't going to get my order correct anyway. And it's a waste of money. My tacos today were so soggy and had no taste. What was I thinking going back again? The icing on the cake was the old lady behind the counter insulted my friend and when I called her out  still didn't apologize. This place won't be open much longer, they are no where near \"authentic\" with all the Indians they have working there. Don't waste your time. Go to Subway around the corner."}
{"text":"Lots of mouthwatering, authentic Mexican flavor combined with a highly efficient business model is what did it for me. I highly recommend their tacos autenticos, as well as the shrimp taco which utilizes actual full-sized shrimp, a chipotle crema and red cabbage. Like I said, you get that combination of Mexican style flavor that really pops in a refreshing way."}
{"text":"Really disappointing. These are not west coast let alone San Diego tacos. Had to beg for limes, staff super aggravated I had questions about the giant hard to decipher menu. Somehow my meal ended up being like 19$. Watched management shame an employee for not taking the garbage out correctly, then pulled garbage out with no gloves in the middle of the dining room. Felt real bad for the employee who got chewed out, to the boss that blasted him, chill bruh, it's not his fault you made life choices to end up in a failing strip mall taco joint."}
{"text":"Stopped here on my way home from school in twinsburg for a quick snack and I wanted to try it out. I got the carne asada taco with guajillo corn, tomatoes, and cilantro and a side of avocado crema on a flour tortilla . The meat was super tender and had lots of flavor. The medium salsa and condiments went together really well. Overall very happy to have a fast casual taco place like this near me!"}
{"text":"I almost cried eating my taco it was so good. The mango and pineapple salsa was to die for!! I got the corn and flour tortilla, I prefer flour! Pollo Oaxaca was so flavorful and the carnitas was heavenly. The staff made ordering way easy so just talk through it with them and build your own, they offer suggestions too! Love the reasonable pricing and food came out quick. COME GET YOU SOME TACOS!! Bowl is good too, but I'm a taco girl!"}
{"text":"Is it terrible the more often I go the worse it gets. Smh I would crave the tacos when it first opened but now I could do without. I have attempted to try to get something different each time I go but that I feel has not been a good idea. So today I got the giant burrito which it was huge but the chicken they put in it was like a shredded style with no flavor and tons of rice which was $9 which based on the size would be worth it if it was good. The hubby got the bowl for $9 and I would not recommend that, there was barely anything in the tin pan they give u. You get more food from chipotle and they charge $6 for a chicken bowl and sadly it taste better. Finally I also ended up getting chips and guacamole and the guac was so bland and gross I just ended up throwing it away. I am going to take a hiatus from this place for a while before they disappoint me further."}
{"text":"Two words: Simple. Delicious. Affordable. Authentic.  OK that was four words, but it goes to show this joint exceeded my expectations. The shrimp on those shrimp tacos were juicy and plump. The fish Tacos and Carnitas Tacos were also highly recommended. You can't go wrong here. For take out, might be best to call ahead. This is ain't your fake, mass-produced, fast-foodified Tacos, this is as real as it gets."}
{"text":"We have been here twice.  I wanted to give it a second chance but it's just not good.  I got 3 different tacos and each of them had a funny taste and the meat seemed to be old and dry.  The worst part is the wait for food.  We for there at 1:40pm, so not a super busy time, and had to wait over 25 minutes for our food.  This happened the first time we were there too.  Chipotle is just so much better overall."}
{"text":"Noticed this place when we were in the area grabbing dinner the other night so stopped by on Saturday for a trial run. This location is very new and is still going through the additional opening pains of not having beverage dispensers out as well as Little to no decorations. One of the initial potential problems is the age of the workers and looking extremely extremely young. We will chalk it up to being very new but our order had tacos that were wrong as well as we got charged the wrong prices as well. Would we be back? Yes as this place has our interest of being new and different type of tacos."}
{"text":"Terrible experience.  The food took 30 min (order at the counter style) and mine was cold. I didn't like the steak tacos, the chips were meh and the guac wasn't fresh homemade guacamole.  Go to Chipotle or Taco Bell for better flavor and less $.  The lady at the register was nice.  The girl making tacos had a hair net but hair hanging out of it around her face.  The chairs are wobbly and the place looks a little shottily put together which I would expect for a location around a year old. We won't return."}
{"text":"Solid 3 for our first visit. Hubby's burrito bowl looked good but he thought Moe's is better. I had 2 authentic tacos - i prefer 2 corn tortillas with my taco-one is just not enough support. Plus other authentic Mexican joints give 2 and it's much tastier. They do give you a huge amount of chips with the chip/salsa order BUT the salsa was slightly sweet. The HOT chili peppers didn't seem that hot. Maybe I am immune to heat.  We'll try it again but I say it's not authentic."}
{"text":"We had the Atlantic cod, mahi mahi and LA tacos. They were decent, with the LA taco needing more seasoning. The big problem is that they are not worth $4. I should not have to spend $12 to eat 3 small tacos. We also ordered the Flautas with carne asada and these were not good. They were not crispy and were very dry. Too much money for the final product in my opinion."}
{"text":"Wonderful little joint. Ordered a huge carry out lunch to feed the whole family, and they got everything correct. Followed all the special instructions that I listed. Service was amazing; they were courteous, timely, and made sure I had everything I needed before I left. I have a service dog and when I brought her in they didn't skip a beat. The food was perfectly seasoned and delicious, and the portions were huge! We have lots of leftovers. For those who are super hungry I'd recommend the massive burritos. Will definitely be going there regularly from now on!"}
{"text":"Went today for the first time and wasn't overly impressed, especially after waiting almost 30 minutes for a walk up taco order. Employee was nice enough to give us free chips and guac because of the long wait but food was so-so. Don't think we'll be running back for seconds anytime soon."}
{"text":"Been here once a week since they opened. Recommend the wet burrito with mole chicken."}
{"text":"Figured I would check this place out; always appreciate good tacos and I had some time to head out to Solon.  San Diego Taco is in the corner of the shopping plaza near where Geauga Lake used to be.  The store is nice looking with a nice sized dining area in front of the swoopy counter area.  Service was good, helpful and friendly with the food coming out fairly quickly.  The menu is extensive and a bit hard to navigate; I am a bit skeptical of a place that tries to do too much.  I don't need a taco place to do burgers, and international tacos.  It was Tuesday, which means $.50 off of tacos, so I ordered the Shrimp Taco and the Fish Taco.  The 2 tacos were decent sized, not huge, but both had a decent portion of the protein.  The flour tortillas were toasted to add some flavor and crispness.  The tacos were topped with a mild mango salsa, cabbage and crema plus a wedge of lime.  I would have liked some extra heat, but there was no hot sauce or extra salsa evident.  The cod was nicely cooked, mild with a little bit of a sear on the outside.  The shrimp were the highlight of the meal, with a good sear that brought out the shrimp flavor.  Overall San Diego Taco is not bad, but it also is not great either.  I can get better tacos for a bit less at a couple of places around town plus I get free chips and salsas.  I believe that instead of trying to do too much, they should try to concentrate on doing their core food even better."}
{"text":"Waste of money.  Overprice blah tasting tacos.  Doesn't surprise me that they are now closed."}
{"text":"Good flavors and food truck in a store feeling. Tried for the first time and despite some glitches in the ordering process (still working out the menu and ordering kinks) they were very prompt to solve them. Have had mexican many times before, but this has been definitely one of the tastier so far. Tried the shrimp tacos, cod tacos and quesadilla. All very tasty."}
{"text":"I didn't know what to expect but I had Chipotle in mind when I went in. Similar sort of price range.  I had the Pollo Pavo with Pollo Colorado and it was fantastic. My wife had the quesadilla with Pollo Oaxaca. Both were fantastic.  Much more flavor than what you get at chipotle. I'll be back to try the carry out window.   I believe this is a local shop, not a chain."}
{"text":"It's our second visit. Food is so, so delicious. Very well spiced. Burritos and quesadillas are HUGE. For sure my new favorite Mexican food. Much better than the places that serve rice and beans with every dish and everything seems similar. Will be coming here often."}
{"text":"Horriable. Dry quesadillas. How can u mess up cheese and chicken on a burrito shell? Fish tacos are tasteless even with the sauces which, well, have no taste. Ordered a side of rice that was total mush.  They were out of guacamole and the food did not come with salsa.    Bottomline - i will never eat here again. Total crap!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Not sure what tacos are really like in San Diego because I've never been, but from what I hear they are just like this spot. Friendly staff, clean restaurant and really fresh food. They have a big menu and everything is made to order!   This is good food fast: however, it's not fast food. If you want to order and eat your taco within 2 minutes go to Taco Bell. When you're here, take your time, look over the menu and you will find plenty of goodness!   I've tried the chicken tacos, beef soft tacos, and beef chimichanga (which is huge) and it's all great. This food doesn't leave you feeling over stuffed or sick because of grease! It's priced right and a must try! I hooked and pretty sure you'll be too."}
{"text":"I would like to be able to review the food but I've been waiting for over 20 minutes.... hoping the food will warrant a 5 star rating to make up for the lack of service. Would NOT recommend this restaurant if you are in a rush or expecting a quick bite."}
{"text":"Food is fresh and delicious.   It's a little bit pricey, but the seafood tacos were great and the taco salad was yummy (not enough lettuce though)  Basically you design what you are eating!"}
{"text":"We will routinely drive 20-40 miles for good tacos (hello La Loma in Akron and Senor Tacos on Painesville!). However, it would be really really REALLY nice to have a great taco place 5 minutes from home. Enter San Diego Taco Factory.  The space is cheery with bright colors and upbeat  music.  Kevin, the owner, was running back and forth between the counter and the kitchen when we walked in. The menu is a slightly bewildering option of different shells, proteins and toppings that you mix and match - it's like a chaotic Barrio...on steroids...lots of steroids. After spending several long minutes staring at the blackboard and printed menu, we cornered Kevin and asked him to order for us. We ended up with three tacos (chile mole, puya pork and machaca mole), a kids quesadilla and a half verde half mole wet burrito with carne asada, pinto beans and Colby cheese. The food arrived and my eyes nearly fell out of my head because, holy mole, that burrito was the size of my head! Husband was already well into his tacos by the time I took a bite of the burrito. The carne asada was extremely flavorful and the verde and mole topping the burrito were perfectly tangy and smoky. The chile mole taco was delicious. The sopapillas perfectly crunchy, cinnamony and sweet. The kiddo loved the rice and black beans. On a regular night, the burrito would be dinner for two or two meals for one but tonight we demolished it all! We watched a busy Kevin taking the time to interact with almost every customer that walked into his restaurant tonight - we are big fans of restaurateurs who make the effort to do that. We are even bigger fans of people who are visibly putting in a tremendous amount of effort and energy into doing what they love. As we were chatting with Kevin, we were told that starting May 5, there will be even more items on the menu including al pastor, agua frescas (Jamaica!) and horchata.  If the pastor is as good as the food we ate tonight, we will save quite a bit on gas as 20-40 mile long taco trips are exchanged for a 3 mile one...I am looking forward to that."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and wanted to wait until after the second visit to post a review. Food-wise, this is a better option than any other out there in the Mexican category - Baja, Chipotle, Moe's. Our family has gotten several different things off the menu and found each of them to be very tasty. It would seem you can't go wrong with this menu. Where this place suffers is with service and the eating area. Service both times was so-so at best with the typical \"wish I was someplace else\" order taker. Also, the food seemed to take an inordinate amount of time to prepare and arrive at our table (both times). If you're taking your food to go, this is a pain because the place is small and feels crowded even if there are just a few customers sitting at the tables. If you're eating in, it still feels crowded and is a little noisy. On the second visit, the manager was messing around with the girl taking orders (teasing, joking, flirting, etc) , which was off-putting. Why the 4-star review, then? The food is that good. Take it to go and find a nice park nearby or just eat at home realizing that it is worth the wait."}
{"text":"These tacos are amaaaaaazing!!  I love me some tacos and this place follows through! Kevin is crazy talented."}
{"text":"The tacos here are really full flavored. No bland browned ground beef here.  I'm talking about carne asada, carnitas, marinated chicken, shrimp and fish.  There are vegetarian protein options of black bean, grilled veggies and tofu. Fresh toppings to choose like lettuce, tomato, onions, peppers and cilantro.  Choice of various chilies from mild to x4.  Make your taco custom or order \"authentic.\"  The tacos are prepared with no shortage of spice.  \"Authentic\" tacos with carne asada on this visit.  They are currently my favorite on the menu.  This place is worth trying if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Inept staff with subpar communication skills. Ordered food, gave name they attached to it, and they gave it to someone else. They didn't tell me of the error, just let me wait longer. Looks like plenty of not busy workers in the kitchen. They all move slooooow. No energy. Ordering is tedious: menu with too small type, too many items, too many toppings to pick, upcharge beyond 3 toppings. They need the Chipoltle model where you see what you are ordering. I left in disgust without eating but patronized them before. Food is good, not great (chicken tacos, salad).  Too expensive with other options out there. I am not a Chipotle fan, more into Qdoba. This place will fail in this location with this staff. Feel bad for any owner or investor. Probably too hands-off to see the shortcomings."}
{"text":"If I could give it 4.5 stars I would. They need to get their ordering process down but they mean well with all those choices. I suggest a happy dog style sheet. You're always greeted by upbeat latin music and the food is worth the short wait. They forget some order details (hence the suggestion) but their food is on point. Really authentic and probably the best fish taco in the area. Can't wait to watch them grow!"}
{"text":"The GREATEST tacos outside of Mexico! I can't believe how authentic and delicious  these tacos are. The Chef is from San Diego. It reminds me of the little surf shack tacos I would eat every day off after surfing  in Rosarito Beach.  I ordered Carnitas, Chicken Oaxaca, and carne asada.. They are small so order a bunch of them. All three were absolutely perfect. It couldn't possibly be any better. They have several sauces but I highly recommend getting the authentic red on the side (it's spicy)..I would give it more than 5 stars if I could. I just ordered 3 more (6 total) and washed them all down with a authentic bottle of coke from Mexico.. This is without a doubt my absolute favorite restaurant in Ohio period!!!  I asked about a beer license and was told it will be coming soon (within 4 months) :)"}
{"text":"This place has the best tacos in the area with lots of choices. The menu has sooooo much on it, so it's confusing what to order and how to order it. That's my only only criticism. Clean up the menu and take so stuff off of it too. Other than that the food is really good."}
{"text":"Deplorable, I have tried this place 3 times giving them the benefit of the doubt that they are new establishment. I have ordered shrimp tacos 3 times every time there was something wrong with them, I guess they just don't listen to what the customer wants. Nothing like a San Diego Mexican restaurant! I look forward to this place going out of business."}
{"text":"Food was terrible. LA Tacos steak was over flavored and the guacamole is like soup. It tastes terrible too. I wouldn't recommend and won't be returning."}
{"text":"My husband and I where so excited to try this place after awaiting for it to open. We went opening weekend (this past weekend), they are still training employees but the head chef was out helping us place our order and giving us samples of the black beans (which are AMAZING, so much flavor) and the rice (also very good with a lot of flavor). He was very helpful and explained what the dishes were along with how to pick your selections beans, rice, and protein.   I got the Sope with carnitas and it was sooooo very good I will be getting that again in the future. The Sope is just the right size if you don't want a lot of food I would pair it with some chips and guacamole/salsa or get 2 Sope. I got my 2 kids 1 quesadilla 14\" and they split it the size was perfect for them right amount of food. My husband got the Carne Asada wet burrito that was so large, he is a big guy and ended up sharing some with me because it was that large. We also got the chips they were great and a lot of them for the price. All the ingredients were so fresh and the beans, rice and proteins had a ton of flavor!  So glad to have this in our hometown and I look forward to going back!  Here is the link to the menu: http://www.sdtacofactory.com/#!menu/cfvg"}
{"text":"I LOVED the tacos here. I got two carne asada tacos with white onion, lettuce, tomato, and the yellow chile. Perfect amount of spice, delicious seasoning on the flank steak. New place: so still working out the kinks with their internet/payment system. But let me tell you.. Some patience is greatly rewarded with these tacos. I also had the chips and Guac, if you don't like lime you won't like the Guac, but I appreciated it."}
{"text":"Excellent tacos-I love being able to get a soft corn tortilla.  I had three tacos for lunch-ground beef, spicy chicken, and shredded pork.  There are A LOT of things on the menu but they're all a variation on the theme-great So Cal Mexican street food.  VERY fresh and flavorful.  The staff was all very friendly and helpful.  Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Our family dined at this new restaurant and wow what a treat! The ambiance is completely appropriate and the food bountiful and sumptuous!!! We can't wait to go back.  I'd go everyday if i could!"}
{"text":"Maybe third time is a charm? I waited to write this after giving the place another shot. First time I got a burrito it was very heavy with rice and very few of my other toppings. I was also given cheese after ordering sans cheese. Second time around, we had it delivered. The delivery fee is steep, $6. They did not make two of our burritos correct, omitting the crema that was ordered in both. Once again, very few my of 4 toppings other than rice and protein. Maybe the burrito is not the route to go...Next time I will try tacos. I see some comparisons to Chipotle and while I know they are different, Chipotle is consistently good. This place is more expensive by a few dollars, which I wouldn't mind if I was getting what I paid for. I like the menu selection and variety of proteins, so, I am not moving on from them just yet."}
