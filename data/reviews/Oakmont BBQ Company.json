{"text":"This food truck came to our Employee Food Truck Roundup. I had the Brisket Mac and couldn't finish the portions were HUGE! The Mac was creamy and the brisket was done perfectly with a delicious Smokey flavor that wasn't overwhelming like some can be. Many of my colleagues posted on our social site how much they enjoyed as well and hope they'll be back really soon."}
{"text":"Great food truck! Best ribs and Mac and cheese is phenomenal!"}
{"text":"I got to try Oakmont BBQ at the Verona Food truck round up at the farmers market. I was disappointed that the sign said no ribs today , and as I stood in line to get Brisket Mac; someone came out and crossed the brisket items off the menu board......was getting worried that by the time I get to window that pulled pork would be out also BUT it wasn't and I have Pulled Pork Mac & cheese. Was definitely worth the wait.  Very filling portion and had regular BBQ sauce added over top and it was fantastic. I can't wait to try some of the other items on the menu .Would highly recommend trying them when you see them."}
{"text":"We were able to finally get to try this BBQ place as they were at the food truck event at the Monroeville Convention Center this weekend. They did not disappoint! We had the brisket sandwich and pulled pork mac and cheese! It was so good I totally forgot to take pictures before we completely devoured the entire meal! I would definitely recommend checking them out if you get the chance!"}
