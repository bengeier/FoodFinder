{"text":"Terrible buffet. Just go somewhere else for buffet. BBQ was cold on the inside like it was reheated. Not nearly as many choice as other places. And the food is not nearly on the same quality as others. Probably leftover from what they don't sell during the week. Go to a dedicated buffet place like continental. I dont even have high standards but this place was still dissapointing."}
{"text":"Very clean!  Spot in the back in case you need a place to pray.  The food is authentic Pakistani, and the staff are welcoming.  Delicious nan breads with your meal."}
{"text":"Went for lunch, only 6 items to choose from, was not worth the money as food was bland. So many better restaurants/ buffets in the area."}
{"text":"Terrible food. Smallest chicken wings I have ever gotten like they seemed as if they were from a small chicken. Too expensive. But the store looks great."}
{"text":"Came here with quite a few people for their lunch buffet, so we were hungry!  Lets get down to logistic of the place:

Seating: The place is of a decent size and has quite a bit of place to seat.

Menu: Lunch buffet had 4 chicken and 4 veg dishes with Naan, rice and dessert. 

Service: was quite good, there was only one person and she kept up with all the people

Food: for $10 I think it was a steal and the food was fresh the meat didn't smell, they kept things filled.

Parking: plenty of parking as its in plaza. 

Its worth the visit so check it out!

P.S - They serve halal food and they are the same owners from the last havelly restaurant which closed down. They have relocated here."}
{"text":"Not a lot of option for the buffet menu the dinner price was expensive the flavour of the food was fine  nothing extraordinary"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch and was pleasantly surprised the decor is better than most and food was good we ordered the meat thali which came with chicken briyani butter chicken and chickpea currie it was also served with raita(a yogurt based sauce with fresh herbs and diced carrots and cucumbers) naan and salad the briyani was quite good and better than most Indian restaurants and chickpea curry was incredible that's something I usually don't like but was done incredibly well here the chickpeas were so soft they almost melt in your mouth my dining partner ordered the lamb briyani which I did not try however it looked good and was HUGE portion"}
{"text":"Food is fresh! Great variety. Staff is great. Clean restaurant! Do expect to make a reservation as the place is busy."}
{"text":"went there for Iftari during Ramzan and it was a good experience. In the buffet, we really enjoyed the Haleem, Biryani, and kababs. The nihari was not good."}
