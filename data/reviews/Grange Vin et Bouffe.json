{"text":"For starter, I had a very basic salad: lettuce, mini tomatoes and a bit of parmesan. For main dish, I ordered a tartar.  Unfortunately, the restaurant doesn't offer fries so my main dish comes with the same small portion of salad I had before.  Speaking of the service, the waitress was nice, but fast to fill up our wine glasses.  In short, no more than an average experience."}
{"text":"Food: Went there a while back for their tapas-style brunch now I think no longer offered since they don't open on Sundays. Overall nothing impressive about the food itself.  Service: Very professional and helpful.   Value: Located in an expensive area, the price is close to the neighboring restaurants but still steep for brunch/poor price-to-portion (tiny portions!), rather pricey for what they have to offer.  Ambiance: Urban barn-like style, very comfortable and big space! Good ambiance but seems a little pretentious~"}
{"text":"A very unique place, here's the run down on its Atmosphere, Service, & Food  Atmosphere: Grange is a very unique tapas dig - even by montreal standards.  Located in the uber-chic Old Port area, Garange is part French (france) local store / market and part Quebec mess hall.  the Cluttered decor is surprisingly seamless and very comfortable.  Service:  Very professional.  The staff knows that they operate in an expensive area - and thus go the extra mile to be that little bit more professional than the average place.  This however does not interfere with their seemingly genuine helpfulness.  Food: Tapas is the name of the game. For brunch the offers cheeses, meats, as well as freshly cooked breads and home made jams make the meal diverse, and for dinner Kraft Cheese al la Garange is an interesting order.  Chic, stylish, very \"Sex in the City\""}
{"text":"We had a reservation at 7pm. When we arrived, our table was not available - the group before us \"took longer than expected\" - so we had to wait at the bar. We got our table around 7:30pm, but it took another 30 minutes for the waiter to take our order. The quality of the food was ok: the do-ré-mi appetizer was very good, but the salmon tartar was very salty. The ribs were good (could have more vegetables on the side), but there was way too much salt and clove in the meat pie. You don't need that much salt when the flavours are good to begin with.  But the worst part was that at 10pm (remember, they took our order at 8pm), slightly after we paid, the waiter asked if we thought of leaving soon because another group was waiting for our table ! Of course, he waited after we paid his 15% tip to ask us to leave. We were finished and would probably had left 5 minutes later, but it's the first time anyone at the table has every been asked to clear the table at a restaurant.  A near-400$ bill for a table of four, took an hour before our order was taken, salty food, and being asked to leave the table 15 minutes after dessert is served... There are too many good restaurants in the area (graziella, local, l'appart, helena, ...) to go back to this grange !  To the owner: booking three services on the same table for a night without enough staff to allow for a quick service, no hostess and no manager on a saturday night might be you're idea of a profitable restaurant, but count me out.

{"text":"Il y a un moment que j'y suis allée, mais pour moi c'est un endroit parfait pour un 5 à 7. Pourquoi?   Premièrement pour l'ambiance et le style de l'endroit. C'est un endroit sans prétention avec un décor robuste.   Deuxièmement, pour le type de nourriture au menu. Évidemment, il est possible de manger des plats principaux, mais le plus agréables est de se partager des planchettes d'entrées ou de finger food.  Puis, les vins sont biens.  Bémol? On ne va pas là pour le service... Plaisant, mais un peu bête.... Mais entre amis avec un verre et un bon grilled cheese à la main, on passe par dessus.   En général, j'avais bien aimé."}
{"text":"I & my sis had a meal of a glass of wine each and a good variety of appetizers. In a word Yum! The food was impeccable - delicious. On the pricey side, nothing I'd do often but a great outing, especially for an earlier evening. It fills up and the service diminishes as the clock ticks away. Luckily, we had an early meal.  Just a note: everyone uses the word tapas to describe small plates (usually savory) eatz - to me tapas connotes Spanish or at least Latin in flavor."}
{"text":"Honestly with the wide variety of restaurant that Montreal has to offer, your hard earned cash will be better spent elsewhere. I had a risotto that had the same texture as rice, and a mac and cheese that was lacking some richness. Yes the place is cool and the concept is trendy...but the quality and innovation of the food is just not there. Sorry not sorry."}
{"text":"Lovely restaurant--great food and wonderful service.  We brought our two kids aged 5 and 7, and I wouldn't recommend that if your kids are picky eaters.  Ours are, and total meltdown was only averted by the wonderful attentions of the handsome waiter who brought my 5 year old daughter unadorned cheese curds.  The children were graciously welcomed and treated extremely well, but unless yours are adventurous eaters, you'll need to feed them elsewhere."}
{"text":"This place is a cool place for brunch. They have little breakfast tapas which were great, and absolutely superb bread! The atmosphere is very cool too. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Belle ambiance de 'chalet' dans ce petit resto de la rue MCGill.  Bien situé a la limite du quartier des affaires et du Vieux-Port, Grange devient un endroit facile a adopter si vous voulez passer une soirée sur les quais après le travail. Le menu est simple et concis, (tartares, salades copieuses, burgers) mais contient des choix variés pour tous les palais. Les prix sont moyens-chers (25$ une assiette). Ils ont une bonne sélection de vins également.  Le service est plus qu'amical, quoi qu'un peu lent. Nous avons bien aimé notre expérience et serons probablement de retour !"}
{"text":"What I like about walking around a new place is finding places to eat. The prices is are high, but the server was really attentive, always coming by to make sure that we were taken care of. There's a large area in the back, ideal for a big group. Had the crab chowder, it was thick and good, the mac and cheese was alright. It wasn't crowded, because the weather sucked and people tend to stay in indoors. I forgot what I got which had some crumbled popcorn which was good."}
{"text":"Came here late with a group of 6 - atmosphere was certainly unique - sleek but rugged, and the servers dressed in black and white plaid.  I like the way that Emma B describes it (\"urban take on barn-like chic\").  We were given the late-night menu, which of course was in French.  I've found most places in Montreal have English menus if you ask for them, so I asked if they had English menus.  Our server was not super pleasant - he gave us a rather gruff \"no\" and then walked away.  When he came back 10 minutes later to take our order, he offered to translate the menu for us, but it would've been nicer if he'd done that in the first place.  One of my friends spoke a fair amount of French and tried to order in French, and the waiter refused to answer him in French - it was kind of awkward.    Food was pretty good - we got the olive and nut app, I got the Bison burger which was small but tasty, my friend got Green Bean Poutine and his cheesecurds were out of control good.  The Tuna Tartar tasted like smoked salmon - straight delicious.  Portions were small, but in general people were happy with the food they ordered.  So yah - food was pretty decent, but with a very hot-and-cold waiter I could take or leave this place.  Also, there was a spider in my wine glass, so I'd check your glassware closely before letting them pour!"}
{"text":"I can't get passed the cook (female Asian) touching her hair, eating random food, and touching her face without washing her hands while cooking. Nasty."}
{"text":"Décidemment, le Vieux-Montréal n'est plus ce qu'il était, et c'est tant mieux. A des mille des anciennes trappes a touriste, on sent un renouveau en restauration qui respecte les clients et ou l'on rejette les cartes hors de prix de qualité douteuse.  Grange Vin et Bouffe, fait partie de ces établissements. J'ai eut le plaisir de goûter leur tartare ainsi que le Mac&Cheese et c'était très bien. La belle carte de vin avec un beau choix aux verres (quoique restreint) rehausse définitivement l'expérience. Finalement les desserts sont de véritables douceurs pour le palais (le pot de crême au caramel salé.... mmm...) Le service est discret mais efficace."}
{"text":"A great place for drinks and creative food after work!  Atmosphere: A very urban take on western, barn-like chic. Comfortable without being too trendy. Bathrooms (located up stairs) were gorgeous (I'm picky like that)...unisex, individual stalls/rooms with a shared marble sink.  Food: We initially went just to have drinks after work, but after checking out the menu of tapas, cheese, oysters, etc...we had to try a couple things. So we ordered 3 tapas dishes to share...smoked salmon chopped and mixed with pecans, mini bison burgers, and ceviche. All were to die for but the salmon in particular was amazing.  Service: It wasn't very busy when we first got there but got really crowded later.  The service didn't change...our waiter was attentive, super helpful (provided recommendations when asked, translated when I needed it, suggested wine to go with out order, etc). Really friendly...and when I wandered trying to find the bathroom (there were no signs), one of the chefs saw me (they make everything out in the open in the mid-back of the restaurant) and pointed out were to go...really nice guy!  Would definitely head back here!"}
{"text":"we went there because of the $59 groupon discovery menu for two that gives you 4 courses with wine pairings. We chose this place for my bday and it was a great experience and a great evening. All food and wine choices are nice. Especially liked the red wine that goes with the 4th course, some Italian Nero d'avola that smells so full of roses and tastes not bad either. Not to mention the music, cute bartender and thus overall ambience. Definitely will go again if I'm around and get a chance."}
{"text":"Interesting restaurant . . . very quiet for a Saturday night, almost too quiet. Perhaps we were just there too early.   Very sleek atmosphere . . . almost a little cold, but yet still comfortable. Staff was nice and non-intrusive. Tapas were unique! Some very good, some underwhelming, but A+ for creativity!"}
{"text":"An excellent experience for my first visit. I was invited for dinner here with a friend who I knew would pick a great place and I was not disappointed. This place was not very busy but it was a Tuesday night. The service was good; wine list very good and the food was sort of tapas style with a French flair and very delicious!  I will return!"}
{"text":"They had these amazing appetizers, very unique, there was one in particular that stood out -- it had a hint of licorice. ...  I think it was cheese mixed with something else and licorice. I have no idea, but it was so good.  I attended a private event here, and they served random appetizers. They weren't normal ones either, they were creative with their ingredients. I haven't eaten their main courses, I wonder if they'd be any good...  The atmosphere was okay, the music wasn't memorably hip shaking..."}
{"text":"I would describe the look of the restaurant as rustic-chic. The walls were wodden and so were the platters, and at the same time the bar and even the washrooms looked very modern and sophisticated. The service was wonderful and the food tasted great. However, my reason for a minus one star goes to the prices. I find it pretty pricy to my liking considering the serving sizes ie. tapa-like. I would definitely go back for drinks for a 5 a 7 or hanging out with friends on a Saturday night, but I wouldn't be going back for the food just because I could find cheaper somewhere else in downtown for the same quality food but at a much larger portion. It was a good tasting experience thought (went there because I got a Groupon thingy for a 5-course meal for two)."}
{"text":"J'ai vraiment aimé mon expérience chez Grange. Le staff est chaleureux, l'ambiance est super cool, le décor est vraiment invitant. J'ai mangé une assiette de charcuteries et fromages et un tartare de buf au cognac. C'était vraiment wow ! Mon nouveau Resto favori"}
{"text":"We ran across this place, located outside the craziness of Old Montreal. The waiter translated the entire menu for us, complete with commentary on what each dish is comprised of. The wine list is great. And most of our dishes tasted amazing. We really liked the beet carpacchio (who knew?) and ceviche salad. The bbq duck was okay, not great. But overall, great service, nice atmosphere (trying towards Western/\"barn-like\"), relaxed, and small, tapas-like plates. One of our best dining experiences in Montreal."}
{"text":"Je n'avais jamais entendu parler de cet endroit auparavant et je n'ai pas été déçu! Mes baby back ribs étaient succulents, le potage très bien réussi, l'ambiance était cool, le service très attentionné (notre plat principal accusait du retard, on nous a offert un excellent gravlax de saumon pour compenser). Les prix sont raisonnables du moins pour le lunch (entre 15 et 20$). La carte des vins est adéquate même si le choix au verre est restreint.  Vraiment, j'y retournerai."}
