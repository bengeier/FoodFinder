{"text":"Caught this food truck the other night at a century link event and had a falafel pita sandwich. It was very tasty and freshly made, nice job guys!"}
{"text":"Best gyro in town. The meat is seasoned perfectly and the rice is succulent and delicious."}
{"text":"Huge gyros for 7$. I first met with delicious Greek Delights when I was in First Friday festival in las levas.I can recommend this place with their yummy baklava."}
{"text":"I first encountered this food truck at Foodie Fest. Their gyros were amongst the best I've had and I really enjoyed it! Very good portion plenty of meat and sauce."}
{"text":"I write this from a bathroom at Albertsons, reflecting on the life choices that have brought me to this location. It all started when I decided to get lunch from this food truck. As a fan of Greek food, I was so excited at the prospect of enjoying a chicken kabob lunch that I didn't mind standing in line under the grueling Las Vegas sun for 15 minutes to place my order. However, when it was time to place said order, I was informed that my savory kabob dish was no longer available. Saddened, but not deterred, I ordered a rice bowl instead.  By the time I got my order 30 minutes later, my soul was discouraged and my skin was slightly darkened but I still clung to hope at the prospect of a good meal. The rice bowl itself was quite tasty and flavorful with chicken, rice, tomatoes, onions, and feta cheese. Tons of feta cheese. I almost thought it had been worth the 45 minute wait under the sun. But that was before the wrath of Hades had unleashed on my stomach nearly two hours later. I was casually working at my desk when the first ominous grumble hit. I brushed it off, but after a few minutes I realized that there was no escaping this terrible fate. Three trips to the bathroom later, I knew I wasn't going to make it at work until 5 so I left so I could at least suffer in peace at home. Except I didn't make it home either, which is the reason I am now confined in a bathroom stall at Albertsons. Overall, if you don't mind long wait times and Medusa's hair slithering in and wreaking havoc on your intestines, this food is amazing. However if you value your time and your stomach, there are probably better alternatives."}
{"text":"Best Greek food ever!! Hades gyro to die For! We tried multiple things and were not disappointed."}
{"text":"I'm so excited for this Rancho and Craig location... finally great Greek food near me! I first fell in love with Greek Delights through their food truck at the food festival. I can't get enough of their Spartan Fries, they are a MUST TRY. If you like a little spice you HAVE TO try the Hades Pita. The meats are so tender. The Greek lemon soup hits the spot on a cold day. If you're looking for an appetizer, I loved the spanakopita. The menu is so diverse and has more options than any Greek restaurant I've been to. My daughter loves their Greek yogurt bar. It has all the fixings! The portions and the food never disappoint. The ambience is chill, clean, and comfortable. The staff are friendly with great customer service!"}
{"text":"First time customer. Ordered the Gyro Classic and seasoned fries . Both were very delicious. The staff was super friendly as well . Dinning room very clean . I will definitely be a returning customer ."}
{"text":"Greek Delights is the best! much better then gyro time! the customer service is spectular, and the owners mike and lois are fabulous! the gyros are fantastic with lots of meat ect, and the prices are worth the trip. yum yum!!"}
{"text":"This review is for the location inside Walker Furniture. Let me first state that I am NOT a picky eater. I will eat just about anything and like it. This is the second time I ordered from them. I ordered the classic gyro and the Zante fries.   The service was very good and the guy behind the counter was very nice. However the gyro was very plain nothing spectacular and could not eat more than two bites before I had to toss it. I thought ok, not all is lost and I was looking forward to eating my fries.   The menu said they would have herbs and spices and feta cheese. No trace of any feta cheese and barely any herbs. On top of that, they were waaaaay undercooked. Sometimes I like a little soggy fry once in a while but not undercooked. I ultimately had to toss them in the trash.   Overall, pretty disappointed and probably will be my last time there."}
{"text":"Wasn't delighted with my Zante salad w/ chicken. Served in a plastic basket on wax paper, asked why it wasn't on a plate? A: Order comes in a basket. Asked for a plate and transferred my salad onto a paper plate. Don't understand the high ratings maybe people enjoy eating geek salads off wax paper? If you're into this...... And If you love olives this salad is for you! (Pic after I transferred)"}
{"text":"I give this place a 2.5. Although my gyro was packed with meat, the meat was one notch away from being cold. The fries are like McDonald's fries, but a nice serving. The owner/manager (?) was amazing. Upgraded my fries for free and also gave us a free drink. Very nice man. The 2.5 is mostly bc of him. Overall the place has great vibes.  I don't know. Maybe I'll try again one day bc of how great the manager was, but for now Gyro Time will be my go to."}
{"text":"Very friendly service. Big portions, great food! The baklava was so awesome! I got the Gyro plate, so much food I had so much food i left for lunch tomorrow."}
{"text":"I come here at least once a month, my family doesn't go out often, but it seems we always end up here.  The food is great and the staff is friendly. They are genuinely helpful and excited to get good food to customers. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone, regardless of diet restrictions and preferences."}
{"text":"This is a cafe style restaurant. No frills, just great food! The food is delicious and fresh, even better than some higher priced restaurants. We've ordered the Gyro platter, a meal with three skewers, the Zeus Gyro and a regular gyro, all of which were excellent. Their fries are the best! They are so crispy and don't get soggy. This has become on of our favorite places!"}
{"text":"This is hands down the best Greek food in Las Vegas.  The gyro meat is perfectly cooked and the rice is amazing.  I will drive anywhere in the city (and have) to get their food"}
{"text":"This is the best food truck I have ever eaten I am Greek it is hard to find good Greek I have searched and searched all over Las Vegas and more the people are friendly and fair down to earth awesome and delicious food."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to give this place a try after Yelp recommended it and we were not disappointed. We had the classic gyro, the Greek salad and their soup. The gyro had plenty of meat and they even gave us extra Tzatziki sauce, the salad had a delicious lite dressing and the lemon chicken soup was also very flavorful. Another thing, the prices are pretty reasonable for how much food you get. We will definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"If you like authentic Greek food, you will like Greek Delights. We had the gyros and they were fantastic! We are looking forward to trying more items on their menu"}
{"text":"Waited in the heat for over half an hour after ordering when they said the food would be ready in 10-12 minutes. Also, the staff was incredibly rude. I paid $10 to be incredibly frustrated and annoyed. Don't waste your time or your money."}
{"text":"Waited in line for 20 minutes for them to open up late. Got a tiny bit of food. Slow service. Limited choices. Would not recommend. I give it an extra star for tasty food."}
{"text":"Food and service were on point for us! Hubby has been eagerly awaiting our first visit & he was already planning a return by the time we left.  Sweet Greek lady greeted us & confirmed that our orders of the Classic Gyro and the Chicken Souvlaki Plate were the most popular. We could see why when our food arrived--the gyro was a warm pita generously filled with the rotisserie lamb and beef mixture, laced with their tasty tzatziki sauce, a bit of red onion and fresh tomato. My souvlaki, 2 long skewers of tender grilled chicken breast, were laid on a bed of delicious Greek-style hot rice which was sprinkled lightly with crumbled feta. My side was a green salad with tomatoes, cucumbers, red onions, feta, all tossed in a light olive oil and lemon dressing with select herbs--refreshing. We stopped talking and just started sharing and enjoying our lunches.  The nice lady at the counter came to see how we were doing and also stopped by other diners to check on them, too. We were the first in, yet wanted to be the last out. So hubby went back to counter and ordered baklava for dessert. He knew it was best to order two of the larger than usual diamonds of light phyllo, with a super scrumptious filling. They were not overly sweet, like some we've had, but were done with a delicate touch and made today.  Yes, we are going back, sooner than later. Maybe next time we will try their outdoor seating, although the pretty azure tabletops inside made it feel like we were somewhere seaside. We liked this place!"}
{"text":"I suggest trying the \"Flaming Cheese\" which is a Greek version of Queso Fondido (melted cheese. The tzatziki is the best yet. And of course the spartan fries. And do not forget the Baklava! This restraint is clearly family own, and maintains a mom and pop cliche which is awesome considering our corporate dominated city.   \"Your body is not a temple, it's an amusement park. Enjoy the ride.\" -RIP Anthony Bourdain"}
{"text":"We ordered through GrubHub to be delivered at work for lunch. We ordered the Spartan Fries with a request of well done fries and extra Gyro meat and The Greek Rice Bowl. The Spartan Fries were like they were only thawed out and there was no Extra meat that we were charged extra for the meat. You could tell that the meat was not made on a shawarma machine. The Greek Rice did not state that it had feta cheese and when you open the container it was covered in feta. That is not what someone wants when they hate feta. There was so much on there you couldn't taste anything else. We contacted GrubHub and they attempted to contact the location to request that we get refunded or have the order remade. The owner refused to accommodate. This is terrible service for a business to refuse to rectify the situation. We will NEVER be ordering from there again. Thank you to GrubHub for giving us a credit that this terrible business refused to do."}
{"text":"I enjoy Greek salads...alot, so I was excited to see a Greek restaurant open up in this area.  Stopped in last week.  The restaurant used to be part of a restaurant chain.  Front of restaurant is wide open so that you can see the food being prepared.  I was greeted with a happy smile and a welcome.  Altho the menu has plenty authentic Greek items...I of course ordered my Greek Salad.  Crisp and fresh.  Absolutely loved the freshly made dressing.  There is an outdoor patio area where you can eat.  I'll be attending their Grand Opening to try the Zante salad and freshly made Baklava."}
{"text":"Let's just start saying that this restaurant is great. The food is made too order and fresh. The prices and portion sizes are unbelievable as well as the help. The cooks work hard, along with the counter staff always providing great customer service. This restaurant is a breath of fresh air. Being for Chicago I have been waiting for real Greek food on this side of town let alone in Las Vegas. I recommend it without hesitation and you will be very happy if you try it and make a regular stop for yourself or with the family."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. I tried a Gyro, Zante fries, and a strawberry smoothie. The Gyro was a great size and came with lots of meat. The fries were seasoned with lemon and topped with feta cheese. They went perfect with the Gyro. The smoothie was creamy and very flavorful. They definitely have the best Greek food in town. I will be returning soon."}
{"text":"Been here three times for lunch with a friend. So good. Favorites are: Greek salad and the Chicken Souvlaki plate. These are both filling but doesn't put you in a food coma and \"now I don't want to work\" feeling  extremely flavorful and satisfying. I am picky with salads for it to be good to me the lettuce must look and taste fresh and it always does for each order! I don't get the sad wilty lettuce that should've been thrown away dish but fresh, light and well seasoned! Nice patio area outside to take full advantage of the good weather. Our new lunch time favorite!"}
{"text":"Had a gyro this evening from Greek Delight Food Truck.  The gyro was perfectly cooked and loaded with plenty of meat.  It was super yummy.  I wish I had asked for more tzatziki sauce.  It needed just a bit more.   I am glad I chose this as there was another in the food truck selling Greek food in the lot but this one had the line - and that means great food - it was def. that."}
{"text":"A co-worker ordered a bunch of food for us from Grub Hub and said that he had eaten here before and the food was good.  The gyro meat was tender and flavorful, but the rice was extremely salty.  None of us has high blood pressure and it gave us all headaches.  I mean it was \"very\" salty.  I'm not sure if you used chicken broth and salt for the rice, but that just ruined it for us."}
{"text":"I just placed an order through Grubhub for this place. They cancelled my order because they wanted to close up early. Wow..."}
{"text":"Some of the best greek food I've had! Super fresh and super good. Will definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"So glad the owners have opened a new location on Craig and Rancho.   I ordered the Spartan Fries which are a bed of fries covered in Greek spices, gyro meat, feta cheese, onions, and a few other yummy toppings.  Aside from the food , the service is amazing. I was able to meet the owner which is pretty rare in a place like Vegas.   Shout out to Ronnie the hear chef for taking good care of me. Greek Delights is definitely my new obsession."}
{"text":"My wife and I went to try this place out and the food was great!  Service was fast and friendly."}
{"text":"If you're from Chicago, truly from chicago born and raised, you KNOW what a gyro is supposed to be and exactly what tzatziki is supposed to taste like; living in the desert now I gave up, until NOW.. Do yourself a favor and if you're not close make the drive, this place is the real deal, from the service to the flavoring this place is the real deal through and through EXCELLENT EXCELLENT EXCELLENT gyro and the rice bowl GET OUTTA TOWN AMAZING"}
{"text":"So if you're from Chicago good luck finding a normal gyro in this town UNTIL I FOUND THIS PLACE!! They SO get it gimme meat with extra meat and sauce with extra sauce and we're in business!! SO GOOD and just like home the way it's supposed to be LOVE YOUS GUYS!!"}
{"text":"The Greek Delights food truck was scheduled to be at my location today from 11AM to 1 PM. I told my associate that I'm about to go grab some food from them at 12:45 to which my associate replied \"oh they left, I went there at 12:30 and they had their window closed and were packing up\". Both of us are very disappointed because we do enjoy the food. Why did they leave 30 minutes early when they were scheduled for only 2 hours and were supposed to be there until 1 PM? I am torn as to how many stars to give, so I gave 2. :/"}
{"text":"The truck came by our office today, and after checking out the menu, decided to get the Greek Salad with Lemon Chicken. The salad was $9.00, which sounds a bit pricey for a salad, but it is a big portion. The food was exceptionally tasty and came with some pita bread on the side. The wait was long for the food however, and I ended up waiting about 20 minutes for my food. Overall, it was a good experience though and would eat there again."}
{"text":"I love this place. I've eaten at a lot of Greek restaurants around town and this is one of my favorites. They have the avgolemeno that I love. Not all places carry this soup. Tom took my order and bought out my food. He was very patient and helpful. His service alone makes me want to return. I had the gyro plate. It was tasty. They give you a lot of food. Too much to eat in one sitting. I like that I had enough to eat later. My only negative is I felt the rice had a very strong lemon favor. I will definitely be back here again."}
{"text":"This is the best Greek food I ever tasted . It fresh made to order , excellent service . Will be back for sure . Keep the good work."}
{"text":"A new place on the northwest side of town! Great Greek food with a nice menu even something for vegetarians. I tried the pork souvlaki pita yum!! Add a Greek smoothie too! Thumbs up Greek Delights!"}
{"text":"Super friendly staff, refilled the ketchup for me and gave me extra Taziki sauce for free. Delicious food!! Huge proportions, I took half of my meal home. Overall I would definitely come back and recommend to friends!"}
{"text":"Well that was an unexpected surprise.  I was following one of my favorite sweets-centric food trucks to some sort of \"craft show\" event at some space that was hitherto unknown to me when I decided that I really wanted some solid food. Greek Delights, which is more of a trailer than a full-sized truck, was conveniently located alongside.  Although I'd never so much as seen this truck before, the menu - relatively simple, like most food trucks - seemed familiar. They seem to feature fries a little more prominently than everything else, but I kept it simple and ordered a gyro combo ($10), which includes a Classic Gyro (normally $8) and an order of American Fries (normally $4). I was fortunate enough to find one of the very limited seats open as I waited for my meal, which didn't take too long to come out.  The gyro meat, touted as all beef and apparently the same rectangular meats as anywhere, was surprisingly as far from dry as I can recall. It was flavorful on its own, and the plentiful tzatziki, tomatoes, and red onions only made them better. The pita is standard fare but got a decent char on the grill. Overall, my impression there it's at least as good as the other gyros that I've tried so far in town.  The fries are not that impressive. \"Plain ol fries\" was the menu description, and they were pretty much that: generously sized portion, average-thickness cut, decent seasoning, but a little dry. They went alright when eaten with the gyro, but benefited a lot from ketchup (separately from the gyro of course). Perhaps the loaded Spartan Fries or at least the herbed and feta'd Zante Fries would have been more interesting, albeit not at a discount. Regardless, I wouldn't go for the plain fries again unless I was as hungry as I was tonight.  Considering that they serve one of the better gyros around while being a food truck, I am impressed with Greek Delights. I hope that they show up more often toward my side of town or at food truck gatherings that I tend to frequent. I'd love to get my hands (or fork) on those Spartan Fries next time."}
{"text":"Mike was incredibly nice and made our visit delightful! As soon as we walked in he greeted us and shook our hands, helped us order and even gave us complimentary dessert! Outstanding service overall, and the food was to die for!"}
{"text":"My dad is from Greece, so we are used to authentic Greek food. We were all very excited to try this place.  We ordered the Greek chicken plate. The flavor of the chicken was great!  But other than that, so disappointed! I really wanted to LOVE this place but...we were terribly disappointed! The potatoes we're grossly undercooked (raw), the rice was bland, the feta was more like cottage cheese than feta. The pita bread was good. But the thing that really got me was their Spanikopita. Horrible! No layers, soggy, and no flavor!  There's no way that this is home made! And they charged us $6 for a little 3x3 piece. I always judge a Greek restaurant by their Spanikopita and the feta they use. We will not be going back."}
{"text":"We have now been here several times. The first time we tried a Gyro and a Chicken Souvlaki Pita. The food was so fantastic, we couldnt wait to go back and get more. We went back this evening and ordered the Chicken Souvlaki Plates and they were huge and amazing! The bed of rice with the Feta was delicious. 2 skewers of the most moist and delicious chicken with awesome grilled vegetables on top of the rice. Their tzatziki sauce was also so yummy! You do wait a minute for your food if you take it to go, like we do. But its just like ordering at any other restaurant if you were to order \"curbside\". Its well worth the wait for delicious, fresh food! We will definitely be back! We love finding awesome neighborhood restaurants, and we love that its family owned and authentic. Thanks Greek Delights, we will be back!"}
{"text":"I thought this place was amazing, until I actually saw how the food was made. The gyro meats are basically microwaved before serving. That kinda ruins it for me, though it tastes good. I mean, you wouldn't know it was microwaved had you not seen how it's prepared.  Their fries are made using an air fryer. That's a great option for those who are somewhat health conscious. But for me, if I'm going to eat some fries, they better be fried in some oil."}
{"text":"Enjoyed there spartan fries.  Very tasty  Greek salad was just that . Gyro was good.  Not bad all in all"}
{"text":"So I'm biased. The Greek Delight truck was at our office earlier, and while I waited for my Gyro salad, the meat was being freshly-grilled - While I waited! It only took a couple of minutes, but it was well worth it. The meat was at a perfect temperature, the perfect seasoning and the perfect amount. The lettuce was crisp and olives a pleasant, salty brininess. The salad was much heavier on the protein than I'd anticipated and that was welcome. I may have to pay the restaurant a visit."}
{"text":"Classic Gyro was good, and portion size wasn't oversized. My wife and I walked into wonderful Greek hospitality, and Greek music playing in the background. And they have spanakopita! Need I say more!?!  We'll be back."}
{"text":"We have eaten here twice now. I own a nearby business and spent more than $50 each time. The first time everything was absolutely amazing. The second time...not so much. I would even go as far as disappointing. They forgot a salad which I have to admit they did fix but we had to go back to get it.  The fries were burnt and gross and literally had no one or two pieces of feta on them. The first time they were fresh and covered with cheese. Sadly this may make it so we don't return  Update:  The owner really made an effort to make this better. We are there again today and the order was correct and delicious. We will be returning. Give it a shot!"}
{"text":"I'm not a food critic, so I don't waste my time reviewing every place I eat. My point is, I'm back for the second time, and I don't live anywhere near here, that's how AMAZING their \"Classic Gyros\" is. I have eaten Gyros from Florida to Canada, and I've never had one as juicy or as flavorful at the one here at Greek Delights. Do yourself a favor and come try this, you'll thank me."}
{"text":"Food was subpar nothing amazing like the above comments read...the most discerning part of this food truck was the blatant lie of wait time.  Said 10 minutes, literally took 40 minutes. When asked the son of the owner if I could get a free drink for the inconvenience he quickly muttered, \"NO\".  Then when I asked to convert my tip to a drink the owner had to exclaim I was being rude....Whats rude is not being considerate of a customers time. BYEEEE"}
{"text":"I'm pretty much judge the Greek food that I've had in this town by the MarketPlace Grill they have always had the best food. We did try Greek Delights about a month ago because it was close if you are home. All I can say is that I don't have any intention of going back the owner said the hummus was made on site overall it was pretty disgusting I also had a cup of the lemon and rice chicken soup which I love that also was not so great I had trouble finding a few pieces of chicken in the soup and had more of a sour flavor than the taste of lemon. We both had shish kabobs the chicken was tough vegetables few. Frankly I don't see this restaurant lasting very long"}
{"text":"I wouldn't want to be this person but i have to -This is how I will start my story STAY AWAY... thats the  business name  they should have not Greek delight... Anyways let's continue.... i got a gyro sandwich gyros were so long and dry all i could taste was Lemon juice from concentrate ... the Tzatziki sauce was  made with cucumber peels not cucumber but the peels.... DISGUSTING... it was yogurt with oregano.. no salt nothing Sad :( ... the Lady didnt know anything about the food no knowledge at all... As i walked in she had her finger inside her ear   then it was the nose then she had to scratch her hair too .  NASTY... ok lets move on ... as im writing this review im drinking Soda water hopefully it will  help my stomach... their hummus was grainy and full of cumin ... it was more cumin paste then hummus.... And their falafels i will be honest with u the flavor was kinda ok but it was so hard  my gums  got ripped!!! I will be nice enough and stop talking ... if u respect  your stomach and value your money DO NOT WAISTE YOUR TIME"}
{"text":"Amazing Greek Food!! Excellent portions!!!! This truck had the most customers out of any food truck that visited my job since I've been here and the prices were reasonable!! Super fresh and delicious!!! WORTH THE WAIT!!!!!!!!! Looking forward to eating here again!!!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. I found it last week after they took over the old Baja fresh restaurant. I've eaten here 4 times in the past week. Their portion sizes are great, no skimpy sizes here. The gyros are superb, as are their meat skewers. My favorite thing on the menu are the Spartan fries. They're literally big enough for 2-3 people to eat and be full. I'm a big guy and I shared them with my wife once, with my son the second time we went, and both times we were full. Definitely give this place a shot, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"The gyro taco they made me was about 1/2 the size of others around town. It was made using the small pre made pita bread you'd buy at the grocery store. After looking forward to trying this place I was pretty disappointed and most likely won't go again. At least the refund went smoothly."}
{"text":"Love their gyros but honestly everything we've had there is been great, the kabobs and my personal favorite is the Hades pita and the Zeus is pretty amazing too"}
{"text":"Gyro is great everything is made fresh to order and portions huge love this place. Strongly recommend Spartin frys"}
{"text":"Best gyro I had since I left Chicago unbelievable you have to try this place Spartan frys are amazing great idea"}
{"text":"Two words.... absolutely AMAZING!!! In all the places in Las vegas that I have tasted a gyro  by far this is the best taste ever. I will definitely be coming back !! The chicken is also nice and tender with a great flavor. Must try ! Very friendly staff and a great confortable feel in dining room!"}
