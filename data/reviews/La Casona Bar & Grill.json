{"text":"Great Nicaraguan food, by far the best in Vegas, food prices are great and the food is very fresh and tasty.  Stay away from their Nicaraguan import beer they are pricey.  Over all this place is clean, and the service  is excellent."}
{"text":"Latin Nights! Dance Merengue, Salsa, Bachata and much more. Thursday thru Monday, doors open 8pm to 4am, 21 and over  No Cover."}
{"text":"I liked it. I went there today to watch a soccer game and it was fun. Great drinks and food."}
{"text":"They are trying something new.  Sushi.  Excellent.  I had the Salmon Nigiri.  Trying to have a bachelor party here for a friend.  I hope he picks this place.  If not his lost."}
{"text":"Food was way overpriced ,food was not good at all a can  of soda 5$ ..music was ok but would not go again."}
{"text":"Pesimo servicio, mi familia y yo fuimos de paseo a vegas desde san jose ca,  a ver la pelea del siglo a ese restaurant y aparte de que nos cobraron caro, no pudimos ordenar comida por que la manager me dijo que comieramos parados. La verdad no se los recomiendo, por que el servicio es pesimo. Vendieron lugares que no tenian disponibles."}
{"text":"This is the worst place I have ever been to. Service sucks and the food was horrible. Well over priced for the poor quality. Soda is 5 dollars, water is 5 dollars, and no refills. We waited two hours for our food and they forgot my daughters and my aunts order. This place doesn't even deserved a star. I believedThey are under a new owner so is not what it used to be years ago."}
{"text":"La verdad es sushi que sirven aqui en restaurante la casona esta para chuparse los dedos, lo recomiendo totalmente vayan a probarlo y saldran felices....!!"}
{"text":"Good was sooo good I def reccomend the Honduras food! The margaritas are string but good! I will def come again"}
{"text":"This is a branded as Central American restaurant, and not even a good one at that. If you are looking for a Mexican Restaurant and come here, you will not leave happy.  I have visited a few Central American countries, but lived in Honduras. So with my Honduran adapted taste buds, I was not impressed. Perhaps it is more Nicaraguan? I couldn't figure it out, the menu is sectioned out by country, with a bit of overlap. Best advise? If you are looking for pupusas, head to an El Salvadoran restaurant. Baleada? Head to a Honduran- and so on. This might be your restaurant if you are looking for Nicaraguan food, but I am not 100% on that."}
{"text":"I want to thank la casona Restaurante for such great food and service , we were here with the contestants for the senorita Mexico Us 2015, the were great to us, and really treated us like queens. theyre food was great and the owners amazing, if your in vegas you must visit La Casona, they have the best food."}
{"text":"Luckily the food was good. Still didn't make up for the poor service. After reading other poor reviews on here I was hesitant, but figured I'd give it a try. The waitress sat us on the (Much warmer) lower level next to some folks preparing for a Baby Shower. To say we were in their way would be an understatement.  Our table got no drink refills and we had to chase down our waitress to even get the check. If you're getting your food to-go you'll be fine, just don't dine-in."}
{"text":"Here with this place you get a 3-for-1 kind of venue which consists of a restaurant and karaoke on one side and a nightclub on the opposite side. The nightclub has a fully stocked bar so have at it.  If you're in the mood for hookah, well you can get one here for around $25. You're feeling hungry? Go ahead place your order. Now, the nightclub really gets going around midnight and it's very much happening. I've gone only on nights when the nightclub is open and had a blast. Inside you'll see couples, some cougars on the prowl and your young chica hottie that belongs in a centerfold of a magazine. No, it's not a fancy club like the megaclubs you'll find on the Strip with all the extra bells and whistles. It's just a cool local latin hangout to kick it for a few hours.  There are two DJs and they take turns back and forth playing different types of Latin music to appease the taste of everyone in the crowd (salsa,merengue,bachata,raggeton) It has a small dance floor with tables surrounding it but you can manage a few moves. The DJs are pretty cool, they keep the party going till around 5am.  The staff from the bartenders, waitresses and bouncers hold their own. Professional and quick, especially the bouncers standing outside, don't expect to wait in line to get in, you get to the entrance, they pad you down and in you go. Best of all, admission is free. Once inside, you can come in and out of the club to have a smoke or catch a breather from all the craziness happening inside. The one thing that has been added is valet parking, it's not needed and totally pointless. It's coming off as a little bit pretentious.  Check out the karaoke if you feel like letting out your inner Pop Star then later hit the dance floor. It's low key but would suggest guys wear a nice suit or a blazer, you never know if \"Ms. Right Now\" will be in attendance! So check it out."}
{"text":"First it a boring place no music server look upset wait time for simple plates is outrageous! Dont come here"}
{"text":"Unable to get a table on nights that fights are shown.  We specifically went to this restaurant to be able to eat a nice dinner and watch the fight.   Received absolutely NO service OR a table.  Had to stand to watch the fight and left hungry.  Very disappointed."}
{"text":"talk about being disappointed, every time i go to vegas i stop by another central american restaurant, i won't even say which one it was for the sake of this review. when i reached said restaurant it was closed for renovations and recommended  la casona bar and grill. excited to try a new place we got in the car and headed here, big mistake. the food is terrible starting with the chips and salsa that they bring out i was surprised they would serve stale chips like that. i also ordered a baliada and a traditinal plate. the baliada was hands down the worst one I've had in my life and thats not me being dramatic, stale tortilla and the filling was not good at all. the traditional plate was ok but i have NEVER been to a central american place that served store bought flour tortillas, the side of \"fried cheese\" was un edible. wish i would have just gone to in and out and had a burger before heading back to LA."}
{"text":"A real good restaurant and club .they also have Spanish karaoke in another area  Where you wouldn't know unless you were with a local if your not from here. Drinks are somewhat pricey along with hookah you can purchase . As well you can enjoy the music along with dancing to the we hours of the morning."}
{"text":"Very slow service considering that they where only serving 4 tables at the time. Once we got our food the carne asada was to over cook and the pork had a funky smell."}
{"text":"Long story short, I ordered 2 dinners from Uber Eats and got a confirmation saying that the orders were accepted and should be delivered. When I received my food, a whole order was missing.. I called 5 times before the manager \"Jackie\" got on the phone. She said there was no order for 2 dinner plates only 1. I let her know that I was charged for 2 and was expecting 2 as my confirmation receipt shows, she said for the inconvenience I can pick up a new order. I let her know that I was unable to pick up, hence why I utilized Uber Eats, she was totally unapologetic, didn't even offer to reimburse me for their mistake, just said \"We can't deliver the food you can pick it up\"   Will never order from here again, should have took the bad reviews as a hint! I will be contacting Uber eats to get my money back; if not I will be paying Jackie a visit!"}
{"text":"I would not recommend this place. We went on 7/2/16. First the chips were stale and the salsa had no flavor, watery. My husbands Michelada was not cold, he had to ask for ice. His fish ceviche was boiled instead of cooked in lime and his tostada was warm not cold. He ordered shrimp and octupus cocktail they gave him shrimp and oysters, it also smelled bad. My mexican plate was also not good. The beans had no flavor, the enchilada & chile relleno were not good. I was only able to eat half. My sons fries were over priced.  The floor was dirty, at the entrance, that should of been our first clue. We went because we heard promo on spanish radio. Thought it would be good. This is my first review and for the first time we wished we would have asked for our money back. We are definitely not going back."}
{"text":"From started the outside of this place looks like it's run down and there's two separate entrances but only one works but the other one doesn't have like any sign or anything  Came in on a Sunday around 3pm with my dad and we kind of expected it to be busy and it wasn't. In fact, Us and another table were the only ones there and his place is huge. As we walked in there was a really nice waitress who showed up our seats and was really helpful but The service was VERY SLOW.  even though it was basically empty. the food was good. I got the chilaquiles verdes and my dad got a cocktail 7 mares which he said he wished there was more than just 4 shrimps but it was good. I didn't like is that they aren't consistent on how you pay your check, The other table had the waitress drop off and pick up the check and we were told to go to the front cashier which I don't mind but I just don't understand why would be different."}
{"text":"I ordered the Chilakilas with meat and egg  but my meal smelt like seafood. I was starving and had to eat. So i decided to try this place.. My mistake. I wont be back...  Customer Service was decent."}
{"text":"not good at all!!!! bad service. bad food. this is the place to go to when you want to show servers in training what not to do. never going back. not worth it."}
{"text":"Llegas Entras no hay quien te salude oh te ofrezca mesa, oh un sign donde ir para que te atiendan. Pasan los meseros pides que porfavor te atiendan una media hora después te sientan! Traen los menús toman tu bebida se desaparecen luego un rato llegan con tus bebidas otras pa la orden desaparecen. Te cansas de esperar le pides a otro mesero que ya llevas 45 minutos esperando que alguien porfavor tome tu orden y te ayude. La mesera original no le importa nunca somas sus narices la otra mesera te atendí. Wow entraremos pa las 9:00 pm y a las 11 de la noche decidimos que ya era demasiado mi niña se queda dormida sin comer del Cansancio, mi esposo coraje y dolor de estómago por la hambre, mi mamá sin su cena de día de las madres muchas gracias por arruinar la cena. Es demasiado avisamos que nos vamos por la 2 horas sin ver nada de comida, la mesera grosera nada de disculpas solo se da la vuelta y cancela la orden y tienen el descaro de cobrarme las 3 sodas que pidimos que descaro súper mal servicio ninguna disculpa la manager nunca no la pasaron cuando fuimos a buscarla para decirle que dos horas sin comida es para que nos hubieras dado las disculpas. Peor servicio pero ah que paguemos las bebidas sin vergüenzas !"}
{"text":"really  dirty had to walk in and move a garden hose that was at front entrance.  no ac on ...it is currently  103 outside.  salsa had no flavor,  quesdilla  was ok, Spanish rice had old plastic taste and Margarita  was marginal.   service was little and only if you flagged her down."}
{"text":"This place is the worst place ever.  Huge portions of mediocrity. Overpriced for what you get. Obnoxiously loud music plays while you eat, from a DJ that didn't know the mood or his audience.  Food took forever to come out. and when it did, it was cold and unappetizing. I had the Honduras style fish. Nothing \"Honduras\" about it.  Will never be back."}
{"text":"The food was awesome, the steak El Paso was fenom. Great prices friendly staff. The place was empty I was Suprised there was no one there. Check it out for sure."}
{"text":"Great service, friendly staff & the environment is nice! Overall appeal is great, very clean, very prompt service. We are definitely returning on our next Vegas trip!"}
{"text":"If you like authentic food from Latin America, and a party atmosphere... Don't miss this place!!!"}
{"text":"We arrived at this restaurant t 5:30pm on a Friday. Have wanted to try it for a long time, it's so cute from the outside and lit up so pretty at night.  3 cars in the parking lot should have been our first clue, on a Friday, at dinner time.  Still wanted to try it... walked in, the restaurant is huge on the inside, yet we were the ONLY customers.  We were seated and ordered our usual, iced tea, no lemon. Ice tea delivered, with LIME.   Arghhhh!!!  I know this is a bit soon in the review, but the taste was intolerable, disgusting... not drinkable.... had nothing to do with the lime, I love lime, it just tasted rotten.  The complimentary chips and salsa were good, have had better salsa but okay.  Chips disappeared quickly and still had nothing we could drink. Waitress was not within eyesight and was not attentive toward her only 1 table to serve in the entire restaurant.  She finally returned and we told her about the iced tea and she seemed to just smile a lot and shake her head, we were finally able to communicate, \"bottled water, please\".  We ordered vegetable fajitas and queso fundito.  The queso, average tasting with an over abundance of grease, my husband is a queso fundito expert... he was NOT impressed.  The fajitas, ZERO flavor, there is nothing else I can say.  After a brief conversation, we decided to get up and leave, we went to the counter to pay, the waitress approached us and we explained or dissatisfaction with our meal.  Surprise... not only did she not speak English, there was nobody in the entire restaurant that could speak English.  Luckily there was a customer at the counter picking up a take out order, and was kind enough to explain and interpret our position to the waitress... he told us that she said we only had to pay for our drinks, we insisted that we pay, she insisted \"NO\".... we insisted that we at least pay half the bill and she took it.  The take out customer/interpreter said he has only ever ordered take out pupusas and they were always very good..."}
{"text":"This place it's so much fun and food it's delicious!! They have a big selection of food from many different countries of Latin America and honestly i haven't had a chance to try everything but what I've got is tasteful!!. This is a great place to have fun with your friends or even by yourself. I usually come friday nights to enjoy a cold beer and listen to live music (rock en español) and also they have a good Dj when the band is taking a break. On the other side they have karaoke and DJ as well. Waitresses are fast and really friendly!!. Got the pleasure to meet the owner (Daniela) and she made sure my group was well taken care of. Overral I recommend this place 100%!!!!."}
{"text":"We have a Good time my friends love this place food was very good and the service excellent they play music for us corridos we are going back soon thanks Casona"}
{"text":"horrible place there was a roach on the floor , waitresses didn't have their hair up . found a platinum blonde hair in my food , everything was horribly over priced c"}
{"text":"Drinks were okay. Serves at a point was food but not enough. Waitingn for our food to come to the table for 45 mins. When we got our food the food was cold. They took the food back they brought another plate but meat looked old. Never coming back."}
{"text":"Don't come here! I called to order food for a company party. I specifically told them I need it at 10:50, got there at 10:55 to give them a few minutes. 11:20 the food is still not ready!!!! They made me late to the party. Never bothered to call and tell me it wouldn't be ready and they were not that apologetic either. There are a few other salvadorean restaurants near them, spare yourself, and choose anyone but this one!"}
{"text":"Desde que se fue Dona Norma; no es lo mismo"}
{"text":"The  food was fine but over-priced and so were the alcoholic beverages. Lastly, we tried doing some karaoke but there was this certain guy that just kept singing song after song and I guess he was a regular there and that's why he was allowed so many songs but his singing was terrible."}
{"text":"My family came to eat here over the weekend, and it was a terrible experience. I don't even think the establishment deserves a single star, but that's not an option. The service was slow, and inattentive even though the restaurant was empty; the food was extremely overpriced, and it was cold and not appetizing when it came to the table. The server only cared to pay attention when it came to the bill, and instead of walking away, she stood right next to the table and waited for payment, and was very rude the entire time about it. I would definitely not advise anyone to come here."}
{"text":"I order Uber eats on a Saturday at 11 pm and I got popusas de chicharrón con queso popusas de queso con frijol and popusas de queso and they were really good they send enough repollo and red salsa super bomb the rellenitos de plátano were allright very well packed bagged with everything needed"}
{"text":"what can i say!!!!!?  best place ever,dancing, dinning,singing lot of fun!!  mexican food deliciosa,pupusas riquisimas ,very nice servers!!  thursday to sunday karaoke nites!!!  and dancing!!! live dj's etc..."}
{"text":"The restaurant have over priced food. The food is not good and the place is always empty. The attention from the waiters is poor and please don't even make me start with the owner. I do not recommend this place at all. If you are a person with morals believe me you don't want to do business in this restaurant."}
{"text":"Realized why this place is dead, the food is absolutely horrible. The service is just as bad. We ordered the agua chiles. Literally it was water in jalapeño. The only good thing was the michelada.  EVERYTHING WAS OVER PRICED. &&& it was Karaoke night, by the time everyone was done eating the mood was different. Sad songs were played too much. Dj hooked us up for 15 minutes with some good songs. Then back to depressing, cutting vain songs. NEVER WILL I EVER RECOMMEND THIS PLACE. IT WAS EMBARRASSING! I would leave no stars if I could."}
{"text":"My favorit thing here is the papusas but they have so much more. The food and service is top notch"}
{"text":"I enjoyed this neat little hole in the wall/ restaurant/dance club/kareoke bar. My only complaint was that the dance floor was SUPER SMALL, so It's makes it hard to get your Cumbia on. I like that the restaurant is open late and you can order food while you drink and dance the night away. The music is great, a mix of latin but mainly Cumbia. The crowd is mix of both young, old, and just plain creepy :b. The staff seems friendly and they were quick on the service."}
{"text":"CAUTION food here is old and rancid, costumer service there is none. P.S. they just changed their name to fool people."}
{"text":"Great place and great food!!! Came for the Super Bowl and had an awesome time! Everyone was so friendly."}
{"text":"La comida no estubo tan mal pero el servicio malicimo nunca mas vuelbo a la casona quise presumirle ami familia y les quede mal.bad service.no lo recomindo."}
{"text":"Great food. Best place to watch your boxing fights.   First time been there and something new to explore"}
{"text":"Food is ok, good popusas. Other then that , service is terrible. Being the only table there I figured we would get our order in no time. Nope took 40min! To get 4 popusas out. My order of bacon wrapped shrimp was a disappointment as the bacon was extremely under cooked.. If you see this place just keep driving."}
{"text":"Don't order a Bottled Coke. It's $6.00.  Same price as the beer! The Pasole tasted old. The music is so loud you can't talk with anyone. They're not sure if it's a restaurant or club??"}
