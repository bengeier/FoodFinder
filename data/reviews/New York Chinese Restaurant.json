{"text":"Horrible service!!  Made a delivery order and was informed it would take 40 minutes. After  1hr and 15 min called and asked where my order was. I was told it would take another 20 min... 25 min later food arrives. It was ice cold and was not edible after heating it  totally disgusting. Called to complain. Only response was \"I'm sorry\". Really that's all you have. Will never order from here again and advise you do the same."}
{"text":"worst food ever, wouldn't feed a rat their food, the food was so bad I might have well thrown my money in the garbage disposal. thrity bucks what a waste. I have absolutely nothing good ta say about this place and cannot emphasis how bad the food was. I have to believe that anyone who wrote a good review either has no taste buds, or they are made of  cardboard or is working for them because they SUCK, SAVE YOUR MONEY! I am only posting one star because otherwise I can't post this message, but if I had a choice I would post a negative 5 star.  Plus your house will stink even after the food is out. Hot and sour soup tasted like beef stock, the fried rice was dry and tasted old, sweet and sour pork was so gross, it was breaded pieces in one container and sweet and sour sauce in another....no vegetables and don't even get me started with the Mongolian beef. One bite of each and I walked the whole thing out to the dumpster. If I had not bad cash I would dispute it with my bank!!

I used to work in the business and I come from a family of chefs, this restaurant should be shut down. DISCUSTING

Eek Methinks they owe my 30 bucks and a health department visit or at least a real chef!"}
{"text":"This place is what I would call Chinese food for Americans. I am a little biased however because I was raised eating Chinese food prepared in the Hong Kong style. 

We had the General Tso's chicken, fried rice and the roast pork. I ordered the roast prok hoping for some fatty goodness bu instead was served the red, dry type, called char siu.

However the prices are very cheap and it is really close to my house. I am going to try them again but order some different thing off of the menu.

If you think Pandas is good Chinese food yo will like this place,"}
{"text":"The food was great and the servings are enormous.  Lots of leftovers.  Excellent service too."}
{"text":"This is seriously the worst Chinese place I have dealt with. I ordered my food they charged my card and I waited two hours for my food. Then I call and they tell me they couldn't place my order. Remind you that I am a regular customer and I usually only go with this Chinese place but today my decision has been completely changed. I now need to find a new Chinese place."}
{"text":"Finally a really, really good Chinese restaurant!  I'm from the NY area, but have been living in the southwest (AZ & NV) for the past 25 years - and FINALLY have found the tastes I grew up with.  

The food is so good, the portions are huge, the staff is so nice.

We started going to this location right when it opened, and now, a few years later, we are still frequent customers. I don't think there is anything on the menu we have tried that we have not liked.  The Chow Fun is some of the best I have ever had in my life.  

My mother - who still lives in AZ but is also from the NJ/NY area - likes to go here to eat every time she visits - often going more than once.  She says she doesn't even bother getting Chinese Food in AZ anymore - she would rather wait until she comes here to get the good stuff.   

We almost always call our order in - and even with some of the very particular adjustments we ask for, it is always ready in a very timely manner, and they always are more than happy to make the adjustments we ask for."}
{"text":"Have been looking for good chinese in Vegas for awhile, this place has got it right. Good portions, good content and done right!! And they deliver!! Score!!"}
{"text":"New York Chinese is not good.  Do yourself a favor and find somewhere else.  I knew from Yelp reviews not to expect much, but it was convenient and close.  So keep in mind my expectations were already pretty low.  I called to place an order and picked it up myself.  While online ordering can be convenient, I prefer to call since you end up spending 10 minutes online entering your order and CC info anyways.  When I came to pick up, the place was nearly empty, and the younger boy at the counter (I'm guessing a family member) was arguing with one of the other employees (probably another family member).  He was also not very friendly, handing me my receipt without saying thank you or come again or anything at all.  He's just a kid though so not too surprising.  This business should take a step back and retrain all of it's employees on proper customer service.  Is this young boy really who you want to be the face of your business?  As for the food, I ordered orange chicken, moo shoo pork, and pork lo mein.  The orange chicken was mushy and not appetizing.  The moo shoo prok was decent but the pancakes it comes with tasted like eating paper.  The pork lo mein was the best thing we ordered and was done pretty well.  Given the lack of service and good food, I can safely say I won't be back."}
{"text":"So happy to find this place!!! As a native east coaster I have spent the past 8 years looking for good chinese food like back home! Well the search is now over. The food is AWESOME! Tastes like Chinatown back in NYC! Ordering online is so easy and its priced perfect for a quick lunch! Can not wait for the hubby to try!!!"}
{"text":"We were excited to try this restaurant but we were disappointed.  The food was horrible and it made me really sick. The vegetable roll had a long piece of hair in too. I will never go to this restaurant again!!!!"}
{"text":"It was ok only. I ordered delivery and they messed up my order. They gave me egg drop, instead of wonton. The rangoon and general chicken were delicous. Other than that it was alright."}
{"text":"This is my local Chinese joint. Pretty standard stuff, but I've never gotten something I didn't truly enjoy."}
{"text":"Second time here, first time I had Chicken w. broccoli ... Bad!

I said to give them another chance, so today I've ordered Kung Pao Chicken ... Bad!

 

Both times the chicken was boiled ... no taste... I will never go there again"}
{"text":"Great food and great prices. They were very busy on Friday when we were there, so the food took a little while, but it was worth the wait. Dumplings are awesome."}
{"text":"Reviews are subject to your expectations. I expected nothing exciting, but found my new favorite neighborhood Chinese food joint for miles around. Finally!!  Been here 9 years and have been subject to bland greasy carry out joints until this little gem came to the neighborhood. The food is fresh, big portions and very affordable. Very friendly young staff. Thank you. We will be back many times."}
{"text":"The worst Chinese food I've had, anywhere. Ordered take out tonight, and specifically asked if side sauces were in there (they charged for them) and she said yes. My husband had to go back for them and his rice they forgot. And their \"pork\" egg rolls have absolutely no pork, it was ridiculous. The food had a funny taste, like they cooked old meat. Everything was stale and cold. I will never ever go back to this place."}
{"text":"Why is the concept of good tasting food so foreign to most Chinese food restaurants? So we come in, and look through the menu, ask if they can substitute the meat in a couple of dishes for tofu; they say no, so I order the vegetable fried rice and the egg drop soup and my fiancé orders the lemon chicken, we sit and wait for half an hour while the kid of one of the people who works there, plays loud videos and music that if we were to have dined in, he would have been a heavy nuisance. We finally get our food and leave, when we get home and open up our food platters we see that the chicken breaking is not throughly cooked (so we re cook it) and as I am eating the rice I wish we hadn't decided to try this place. The rice has no flavor whatsoever and you can feel that the rice is not all the way cooked either. I try to add different seasonings to it but it's just unsalvageable. We didn't even touch the soup since it smelled bad, like the eggs were bad. My fiancé eats his chicken and end up throwing up all night. Never again will we come back."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed in the dish I ordered.  I had the chicken lo mein and there was no flavor.   The meal tasted like soggy noodles.  The crab Rangoon appetizer was good but I won't go back."}
{"text":"Ordered $60 worth of food, wanted spicy nothing was spicy, no chopsticks or fortune cookies or napkins or sauces, nothing. Aside from that the food was tasty."}
{"text":"Being from New York this restaurant is the closest you could find that tastes like you never left the east coast.
I always order their chow mien which is completely different here.  They are the only ones here in Vegas that make it like back east.  Their prices and variety of combinations are great.  When you have food delivered it is hot and ready for you to eat."}
{"text":"The staff can be a little rude and can't speak English well, but the food is MUCH BETTER than Panda Express and PF Chang. They have lunch specials that is good and the price is awesome! Since I live a couple blocks away, I would order and pick it up to eat at home. The food taste good and the spareribs is great."}
{"text":"Soooo yummy. I love their egg rolls and they have real actual duck sauce like in New York :)"}
{"text":"Great value. Well cooked. Excellent Chinese takeaway. Can get busy some evenings but worth the wait. 
We have had General Tso's chicken is great. Sweet n sour chicken is very good. Beef chow mien is excellent.  Will update if anything changes."}
{"text":"As good as u would expect from a small local place. No complaints after a few different visits. Recommended."}
{"text":"I have no complaints on this food. I have eaten it 3 times and all 3 times I got a huge portion and it was delicious. I highly recommend this restaurant. Thumbs up and keep up the good work."}
{"text":"Ordered for the first time and everything was excellent. For those from the east coast this is what you have been missing since you moved here. They even have poopoo platters spare ribs tender.... jumbo fried shrimp.  We have found our place 
Very easy on line ordering and delivery was perfectly timed"}
{"text":"I have eaten in the restaurant and ordered on line today through eat24hours.com, not realizing I had been there before.  I think this place is fabulous.  The portions were huge, the flavors great, delivery was about average for delivery.  My order was complete.  Like the name reflects New York (American) Chinese.  This will become one of my favorites."}
{"text":"We had a very good meal here yesterday. My bf had the chicken curry dinner combo. The curry was delicious, perfectly spicy with plenty of vegetables. I had the chicken egg foo yung dinner combo. Both came with choice of soup, rice and egg roll and crab rangoon (we chose wonton soup and brown rice). The egg foo yung was some of the best I've ever had - light, crispy and flavorful. The egg rolls were the awesome big ones - not to be confused with lame spring rolls. :)

Service and food was fast. Food arrived to our table fresh and piping hot. We ate inside the restaurant. Ambiance was casual and low-key with a TV and the game going, but it was the type of dinner we were looking for and the staff were friendly. 

There were no bland foods on our plates. Not sure why some reviewers used the term \"bland\" - all the items I tasted had plenty of flavor, and I am a fan of spicy and \"ethnic\" foods. Portion sizes were good and there were leftovers.

I would definitely eat at this cool little east-coast-style chinese restaurant again."}
{"text":"The food is excellent, but the service has become terrible over the past few months.  The past three visits have gotten worse each time.  Wrong food order, slow service, no plate or silverware.  They seemed very ill prepared and completely overwhelmed.  The wrong order was brought to the table and then took over 10 minutes to have it replaced.  I hope they get their act together, because their food is delicious.  Take out doesn't help either...wrong food in my bag.

Time to find a new restaurant, unfortunately."}
{"text":"Customer service seems to not exists in this place. First time in and placing my order after being looked at for 5 min and then them saying oh you want to order. I place the order and ask what one do you like better , she said with attitude there two diffrent dishes. Yes I understand that but do you have one you like more... All I got was a repeat of I don't know and there two diffent things. Then when repeating the order i thought something was wrong, she snaps saying two come to an order. Finally at the end she calls the number and I'm looking at the receipt calls ya it's yours. RUDE! Won't be coming back for this kind of service."}
{"text":"Food was not good, rangoons were cold, pork rice was so bland and meat/ pepper steak was chewy and gross, orange chicken was drenched in thick not yummy sauce. After 4 bites i was very dissapointed n yucked out.  This is not good chinese and there is a bad smell as well. Not worth at all 40 dollars. Nice server..."}
{"text":"Service was quick and friendly.  Price was reasonable.  But food was at par level.  Not wonderful and not bad either.  One or two bites of my Kung Pao Chicken tasted a little off.  Everything else was fine."}
{"text":"Sat down at 5:20 Saturday evening with a party of  six.  The tea was Luke warm at best. The waitress did not belong in that position.  It is the only restaraunt were they served a plate at a time and to a varity of tables.  My was the first to be served her warm shrimp with lobster sauce at 6:00. The rest of the table was seved their dinner in a span of 30 minutes, except of me.  My entree of orange chicken over rice never made it to me.  At 6:40 I walked out hungry and irritated."}
{"text":"I am very disappointed. I have been a dine in and carry out customer for several years. I tried delivery for the first time tonight.  My chicken in the kung pao was mushy and slimy and clearly not cooked in the center, which made me sick to my stomach. I notified the vendor and they do not seem concerned.  It sucks being a loyal customer and then this.  I will not be a customer again."}
{"text":"Lived on long Island 50 years.we search for Chinese food that reminded us of home. New York Chinese is right in the Zone of New York style of Chinese food. The chicken chow main is right on the money. Very good service.Great table service also."}
{"text":"Ordered through yelp app, food was hot and fresh.  Quality was good and prices werent bad."}
{"text":"Food is very good.  Service is poor.  AC never seems to be turned up enough.  Employees are kind of rude.  Get take out so you don't have to sit in the place."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food I have had in Henderson. I order online and it's always waiting for me when I come to pick it up. It's a Chinese place, so the best cleanliness isn't expected from the restaurant itself, however I feel it does a good job comparatively. Great food, friendly service, and great online ordering. They also met my request by combining my two small portions into one big box, and nothing beats that service."}
{"text":"Loved the food. Would be a 5 star if not for the dining room layout--kinda cramped and you can hear every conversation by tables near you. 

The food, though, is great. If you crave old-skool Americanized Chinese food, this is the best spot I've found. 

The won ton soup was awesome. Every entree I've tried was horribly bad for you but fabulous tasting--if I wanted healthy food, I'd go to Sprouts next door. 

And the coup-de-grace is the boneless spareribs. I was super hungry when I went in there and ordered that lunch portion of this. And I couldn't even finish it. Which doesn't happen all that often, I tell ya. I left stuffed to the gills and had a snack for later. True to form for American Chinese food, I was hungry again a few hours later and finished it off. 

Service is great. Staff is nice. Wifi would be nice, but beggars can't be choosers, right?"}
{"text":"My first Yelp delivery experience and this restaurant definitely ruined it. Waited an hour and a half for the food that didn't even come. I a canceled the order because it just got ridiculous. I am less than five minutes away from this place. I called once it hit an hour and they claimed it was ready to go. I called again once it hit over and hour and a half and just told them to cancel the order and they said that they didn't have my order as received. I Called them out on that lie real quick because I had just spoken with someone before and they had my address and order info just from my phone number. 

Worst service ever. Absolutely no customer service either. Would not spend a dime with  them ever. Who lies to their customers?! Who has them waiting for so long for a simple order? These guys. I would advise order from here for delivery  unless you want to waste your time."}
{"text":"I have to say the pork egg rolls are just like the East Coast and were delicious. Not a big fan of the pork dumplings. The rest of the food was average."}
{"text":"This place seems like a hangout for New Jersey expatriates. Some tasty New York Style Chinese food especially the Beef & Snow Peas and the General Tso's Chicken.   My uncle turned me on to the Beef & Snow Peas and I turned him on to the General Tso's.  So much for his slim figure now. 

I'd give these guys 4 stars but the fried rice was just ok.

3.5 stars"}
{"text":"Ordered Szechuan chicken, extra spicy, online. When I got the food home I was extremely disappointed with the quality. There was an unpleasant sourness to the dish. If I were in the restaurant I would have refused this order. I have never found a Szechuan chicken that I couldn't eat, however this one was the exception. I will not return to the New York Chinese Restaurant."}
{"text":"Best Chinese in Vegas!.. Boneless Spare ribs and Wonton Soup.. Love it"}
{"text":"As a new Yorkers, food is just ok, anyone who knows real Chinese food and says this place is great, obviously has not been to NY!! Also the nastiest S.O.B's I have ever encountered- HORRIBLE customer service!!!"}
{"text":"I ordered the combo teriyaki bowl (chicken, shrimp), egg rolls, and the orange chicken. Everything was great! Now I have had better chinese food just not here in Nevada so far. So, this spot will definitely be an option for dinner night here and there. The staff was friendly, delivery was prompt and priced fairly."}
{"text":"Not sure why all the complaints.I ordered the general chicken and it was really good.it a small place but perfect for take out. they are always quick to respond. Their low mein is delicious."}
{"text":"Place sucks.  Service sucks and food is bland.  It's not the worst I've had,  but it's not the best.  Not even close.  Prices are decent,  but that's all this place has going for it.  There was way too many staff,  almost more staff than customers.  And they were all over the place.  Some strange fluid was leaking from one of the wall mounted ac units and it was all over the wall turning it green.  It was probably water,  but still who should have to eat next to that. Even my fountain drink had a strange taste to it.  Oh and there were no Booster seats or high chairs  for the little ones. If it wasn't for two of the most beautiful girls I've seen in a while being there,  I would have asked for a refund.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"Great food and super clean...  Even the bathroom was spotless..  That may not mean the food is going to be great...  But it was! Hot and tasty and even my gf's veggie food was bomb! Went there a week ago and I will be back...  But first I must sample all the great places here in Henderson! Excellent Asian food."}
{"text":"I loved this place. They made ordering food for my son that was so far away so simple! Thank u very much. The food was excellent and prices are fair."}
{"text":"Awful.  Ordered to go as I have for several months.  To night there was a mistake.  Ordered and paid for a large item and received a small container.  I just called and was told by the \"manager\" Maggie that she felt it was plenty even as I explained I was in as early as last week and ordered the same exact meal and it was in a different sized container  She fought me on the subject.   Can't believe the experience.  After so many good ones I will NEVER Return.  Great service Maggie. I said I would hate to go elsewhere and she responded you are welcome to go elsewhere.   WOW"}
{"text":"It's what you'd expect,  decent food at a decent price.  I got a smile from the lady working the front, so I can't say I had bad service,  in fact it was pretty good.  

I ordered the Singaporean chow main, sweet and sour pork and an order of egg rolls.  Portions are fairly large and I have enough for day old Chinese food tomorrow.  One thing I do like is that they put the sweet and sour sauce in a cup, separate from the pork so it stays nice and crispy.  When I'm back in Vegas, craving some fast chinese and up Spring Mnt. and Fort Apache I'll defiantly go back."}
{"text":"Back in Maine we have a small family owned restaurant that was much to our taste and have be a bit disappointed in Vegas UNTIL NOW...  We have eaten there as well as take home, fast service hot and fresh and the egg rolls are none finer.

The pork egg foo yung  is better than the house chow as well as the house fried rice.

General's chick is a bit warm but tasty.
 OHHHHHHHH  forget the ribs... save them for me,,, absolutely excellent.

Do yourself a favor and try this place... Ten to one you will be very happy.

We give this place the BEST IN TOWN FOR CHINESE FOOD even over the high price spreads"}
{"text":"This is the best Chinese food I've had in a long time. When I bit into an egg roll I said it tasted like back east! We had house fried rice, house lo me in and Kung Pao Chicken. This is our new favorite place for Chinese food!"}
{"text":"I have been living here in Las Vegas for 11 years.  I am originally from New Jersery/New York.  I had all but given up on all these restuarant that say they are \"New York\" style.  This is the first and only one that has lived up to their name.  The food is great and the prics are good.  I have finally come home here in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Having moved here from east coast I wasn't expecting good Chinese food, I found one but they are gone, found this one and we are very pleased. Wait time is long but it's a small price to pay for something that is palatable."}
{"text":"I do love this place, don't get me wrong.  The star docking is merely because they do have some things that they can improve on. First of all, their food is great! I have been going there since the first day they opened and the quality of their food is always fresh, bright and delicious. Their lunch and dinner combinations are a great deal and definitely worth the money.  Their egg drop soup is one of the best I've had.  It's not filled with peas or carrots, nor do they put soy sauce in it. It's like good old fashioned soup. 

Now, on to what could be improved.  When I first started going there, their service was amazing.  No longer than two minutes after making my order, was my egg drop soup sitting on my table piping hot. By the time I'd finish my soup, my entree was on the table.  Nowadays, the service is not as quick.  Maybe because they are much more busy than they once were with to-go orders but I seem to do a lot more waiting in their restaurant than I used to.  This even goes with takeout.  Always add on at least 5 or 10 more minutes of waiting time than they say on the phone.  Needless to say, they are always super friendly there and like I stated earlier, the food is great.  I will continue being a loyal customer."}
{"text":"The worst Chinese food I've ever had, and I've had quite a lot of it over the years. 

First order was so bad, we returned it. 

Went back a week or so later and had different dishes and they were just as bad if not worse. Worst Kung pao chicken I've ever had. Flavorless, no heat, couldn't even taste the peanuts. Some sort of unusual spice that was oddly off. 

Flavorless egg rolls. Flavorless is the word to apply to this food."}
{"text":"Good authentic NYC Chinese food made to order and served in large portions. Love the Wor Wonton soup and Moo Shu Pork. Egg Rolls remind me of home."}
{"text":"So, we have a Chinese place near our home at the 215 and Valle Verde.  We think it is fairly good, but we wanted to try out another place in the neighborhood for comparison.  Now I've traveled to Asia on numerous occasions and have eaten Chinese food all over the world.  This is probably the worst Chinese food I've eaten other than some of the street food in Taiwan.

The rice was dry and not sticky enough.  The vegetables were frozen, not fresh, so they were extremely limp.  The crab rangoon was far too sweet and had little or no crab flavor.  The duck sauce was watered down.  The orange chicken was OK and spiced properly but had far too little sauce and practically no broccoli.

Now the place near our home has fresh vegetables cut in larger pieces, rice cooked correctly, and the proper amount of sauce.  I guess I didn't realize how good we had it.  Prices at this place deserve two dollar signs, not one.  They do have smaller portions, but that doesn't mean it costs less.

I don't usually get on Yelp because I'm really disappointed, but this was really bad.  I don't understand where the good reviews come from.  My wife recognized the problem when she saw them take frozen vegetables out of the freezer for our order."}
{"text":"There are more chinese restaurants than any other, and usually the rule is you get what you pay for but not in this case. Here you get good food at a very low price. They're dinner combos are the best bet, at $8.95, you get a good choice of entrees and lots included extras. Even if you're not that hungry, ordering ala carte is a good deal, single order menu items are as low as $2.00, so if you're strapped for cash this is the place to go, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This is a very good restaurant. Very good Chinese food. I tried it after reading the reviews and its location. I always take out from here and call ahead yet sometimes there is still a little wait but I think it's because the kitchen is always busy. 

The combination plates are where it's at. For $10 you get your entree, rice, eggroll AND soup. For us this usually means we get 2-3 meals from one combination plate. The egg roll is amazing, not the usual spring roll you get everywhere in this town. The egg flower and hot and sour soup are absolutely spot on and very much how the Chinese food where I grew up in California is. (No corn in the egg drop soup, for example.) 

The chicken broccoli is perfect as is the lo mein and the pork fried rice. The pork and the sweetness and the spices are amazing. It might be my favorite thing. The cashew chicken and Mongolian beef are flawless and the broccoli beef is tender and flavored just right.

At the counter by the soda machine there are all the sauces one could hope for. Soy, hot mustard, hot sauce and duck sauce as well as fortune cookies.

You can't beat these takeout deals. You get 2 to 3 meals out of it plus egg roll and soup. I wish I could give 4.5 stars because of the wait even when you call but oh well. It's worth it"}
{"text":"Very good food and fast service.  I have never been disappointed.  I love their chicken and broccoli, and their hot and sour soup. Personally, I am not crazy about their crab rangoon or egg roll...it has a sweetness about it, but that's just a personal opinion."}
{"text":"I got the teriyaki chicken, and if it is supposed to come with rice as I believe I saw it said it does then that's why I gave it a 1. No rice.... if it wasn't supposed to have rice then 3/5. Chicken is fine but I think because they were like 20 mins from closing when I went in that they had ran out and did not let me know since I ordered to go. Still shady, won't be going back."}
{"text":"Last night was not one of their finest moments=-O the food was not flavorful like it was before. The shrimp in garlic sauce was very runny with very little flavor, I like my sauce thick and flavorful. The shrimp lo mein had not been sauteed at all ,that too was less flavorful than what I previously had. It sure is disappointing. Also I had got the fried wonton and I will surely pass on those next time. I must admit that is one thing China go go makes that I really love as well as the egg rolls!

B.T.W this was a first update I ever done and apparently the good review of this place was taken away when I updated this review as well. I didn't know it does that. So I must say the first few tunes I have ate here was great."}
{"text":"A hole-in-the wall in Target strip mall, we FINALLY found our go-to Chinese place. It was busy for 4:00 on a Saturday. Friendly service, fresh and tasty food, and great prices!"}
{"text":"My friend Ray and I tried this place about a month ago since we are both from New York it caught our eye. What is New York Style Chinese Food? Well I think the restaurant is aptly named, but not for the food, for the New York Attitude in the staff.

Most people who are not from the east coast don't get it, I have seen a few reviews about the staff on yelp. I personally like the east coast attitude. The night we dined there one of the lady's was giving me crap (in a fun way) because I didn't eat the mushrooms in the hot-n-sour soup, I picked them out and put them on the side of the plate. Yes, I am a mushroom hater. Anyway I just laughed it off and told her if she didn't put mushrooms in her damn soup, I wouldn't have to do it. It was an oddly comforting exchange.

I digress, the big plus for this place is that its dirt cheap and decent  Chinese food. Now go get some."}
{"text":"Food is pretty good. However, I called today around 11.30 to order 2 lunch specials to go. They said \"ready in 15 minutes\". When I got there they hadn't even started to make it! An hour later and I finally got my food."}
{"text":"Counter service is bad, I mean really bad. The kid behind the counter can't seem to understand line order and was asking people their orders as though it was an auction.  Most of the customers seemed irritated. After waiting over 30 minutes for a to go order, I got back to the hotel (5 mins away) to find the food tasteless. Not only that but the sesame chicken was so chewy it was hardly considered edible. I would not recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"I would rate the food a five. But trying to order it over the phone is horrible. We are always told to wait and have been forgotten a number of times.

My advise is to eat in, not order for pickup."}
{"text":"When I originally saw the place and the name, I decided to give it a try and I was impressed. 

The service isn't that great, but the orange chicken was good along with the wonton soup was good. I also ordered the pork dumplings, which are excellent. I recommend trying the pepper steak or beef lo mein. Overall it is worth the price and it is really isn't expensive at all."}
{"text":"Love the food. Well priced and always hot. We ordered food tonight because I am sick in bed. My son paid the man at the door with a $3.00 tip, but accidentally gave him an extra $10 bill. He returned to the door and gave it back to my son when he realized it. Hard to find such integrity these days! Very impressed."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Never disappointed. Lunch special is great. Lots of food as well. Just wish they had more locations. I want a Chinese spot in every corner just like NYC !!"}
{"text":"Blech... That's how I feel. 

I'm stuck at Summerlin Hospital and everyone knows how much hospital food sucks. So I send my husband out on a little journey to get me some fried rice. I take out my trusty iPhone, open up Yelp and see that my two closest options for Chinese are NY Chinese and Ho Ho Ho. Hubby wanted Ho Ho Ho but I wanted to try NY Chinese. I'm from NY so I wanted to see if this lived up to the name... Especially since I remember that this place came up during a talk thread a couple of months back. 

Ugh. 

I wish I had let my husband choose. The shrimp fried rice was not good. The shrimps seemed ok. The rice was not though. It had a strange consistency to it. Tasted pretty stale. I don't even know how to really describe it. It just wasn't right. 

The one thing I will say is that it is the only Chinese restaurant in the valley that has the duck sauce packets that I've seen. If you're looking for duck sauce, you'll find it here. Otherwise, I would rather drive an extra few miles to chinatown  get some fried rice."}
{"text":"Love it!  A great place for take-out.  I always order the mixed vegetable with shrimp -  it's my favorite dish.  You get 12 LARGE pieces of shrimp! For 9.95 and it's DEE-LISH!  I've also had the egg foo young and the BBQ pork and that's very good too! 

I'm a picky fried rice person, not too many places can impress me - it has to be just right - the shrimp fried rice is not the best but its still has great flavor. (i just like more veggies, pieces of shrimp and egg in mine)  I'm still giving them 5 stars anyway.  I love homemade authentic style food - you can see they work hard and prepare hard to get their food just right.  I like that you can order small and large, not all places do that and it gives you the opportunity to try a couple different things without spending too much.

I walked in last night right when they were closing but they still took my order and had it out quick. Their super busy most of the time so call ahead if you can.  You  really can't beat the prices for the taste and the amount of food you get."}
{"text":"The best option for to-go Chinese in this area of Henderson.  The flavors and prep method are very east coast.  Nice amount of vegetables in the dishes and the meat appears to be of decent quality.  Online ordering, no MSG and brown rice are nice offerings.  Egg rolls are very good - just enough crunch.  Portions are on par with other places and the prices are great."}
{"text":"Best Chinese take out anywhere. I have lived all over the  US and if you want great Chinese delivery this is it!  Always great quality, and the BEST hot and sour soup anywhere. The delivery is wicked fast!! The staff is awesome and very friendly!  I highly recommend the cold noodles on the appetizer menu.  OMG...I love it!  It has peanuts so anyone with allergies shouldn't order it.  It's even better the second day!! You get a lot!!  I really can't say anything bad about this place.  They are the best!"}
{"text":"Food - good - as close to back east as I can find. But never again will I order take out. And shame on you Yelp EAT24 for having the worst customer service. They do NOT process these orders unless you call! And shame on me for trusting either of them more than once. 90+ minutes for delivery is insulting! First bad review I've ever written.

Update  -  ordering direct from the restaurant was the way to go - and the food arrives within the hour depending on the evening. Good news is they call minutes before they deliver so I can rein in the dogs :) So I upgraded to good and still find the food yummy."}
{"text":"We ordered the Orange Chicken lunch platter and shared it. The food was fresh and delicious and the portion size perfect for 2 people."}
{"text":"Ordered many times for our family ( on delivery ) always Hot & tasty) but recently i noticed they changed their rice  from HIGH quality Basmati rice ( too a cheaper tasteless brand ) rice is starchy & bland , NOT MY CHOICE ANY LONGER! ( u get a 3star unless ur change back! BEWARE OF CHINA TOWN LAS VEGAS NASTY NASTY NASTY ALWAYS ON DIRTY DINNING!!!!"}
{"text":"I drove by this restaurant hundreds of times thinking it's the same old fast food Chinese restaurant, it's not.  The dishes are made to order and fresh. The prices are reasonable too."}
{"text":"This is a rather delayed review, as I have been eating at New York Chinese longer than I have been Yelping.

My wife and I have been eating at New York Chinese for almost three years now, and I have never been disappointed in the food or the service.  Now, I've read reviews here on both sides of the middle saying \"I'm from New York and I know what New York-style food is all about ...\" and then one review says that this or that restaurant makes the best food that's ever been cooked, and the other review says it's not fit to feed your pet.  Amidst all the confusion, let me state that the Great Bearded Bird has never been to New York, either city or state, so I can only go on what I like.

Also, in the interest of FULL disclosure, I will state that I have only purchased food for take-out once.  All the remainder of my experience with this establishment has been of the \"eat-in\" variety.

The food has always been top-notch.  What should be crisp, has been crisp.  What should be savory, has been.  Never a complaint on their preparations.

Service has always been outstanding, even when the place is crowded.  (With only eight tables, crowded comes easy.)  The people are always nice.  Story from today ...

For a number of reasons that don't need to be gotten into at this time, it's been about eight months since we've been there.  Always meaning to, and always something comes up.  Today, we go.  We get there, we order our usual (no matter how many times we go, we almost always order the same things), and we sit down and wait.  One of the staff, a darling young lady named Michelle, sees us (she's waited on us many times), says \"hi!\" and comes over to touch base.  She tells us she's missed us and how glad she is to see us to know that we're all right.  Now, just exactly how many other places do you get that kind of greeting, even if you HAVE been gone a while?

Food: 4-amd-a-half of 5.
Service: 5 of 5.

Of course, we'll be back.  Never better.  Well done, people.  *Sheh-sheh* (\"Thank you\" in Chinese.)

{"text":"We went here and order: general tso chicken nice balance of sweet and spicy, Hunan beef spicy and full of flavor, beef lo mein plenty of beef and noodles, egg rolls were crispy and not dried out cabbage like most places, fried shrimp perfectly cooked not dried out, mushu pork most authentic ones I've had since leave California over 20 years ago! So far this has been our big favorite of all the Chinese food places we've been to! Yes its americanized but no disrespect to other who like real Chinese food out of China but I've been to those places and wasn't impressed or like it much so I'll keep my americanized versions!!!"}
{"text":"For the price, you can't beat this place. Great food in a no-frills atmosphere."}
{"text":"Service is poor to nonexistent.  I was trying to order to eat in, but of the to go orders were given priority and I was just not served."}
{"text":"I wish there was something between \"OK\" and \"I'm a fan\". I had the Generals chicken (it was ok) which came with a really HOT and yummy Egg Drop soup. They are really friendly and I had it delivered very quickly!
  All in all I will definitely return as a customer and try something new."}
{"text":"We have ordered from here multiple times and have never been disappointed. Most recently, we ordered chicken fried rice, Buddhas feast, veggie lo mein, egg rolls, cashew chicken and kids sweet and sour chicken. Our total for all of this was $40 and we ordered it as carry out. (I have never tried the delivery). We had enough food for leftovers. The food was hot and there was plenty of it. Not salty and not greasy. One of my favorite things about this place is their use of fresh veggies. The dishes don't just contain book choy and onions. There are big pieces of fish broccoli, mushrooms, carrots etc.  the egg rolls are actually egg rolls - not spring rolls. The cashew chicken also had plenty of whole cashews. I'm actually surprised this place has only 3 stars overall. I've tried many Chinese places in Vegas and this one is by far the best, in my opinion. For this most recent order, my whole family loved everything and plans to make this the go-to restaurant for Chinese food."}
{"text":"The BEST Chinese food in Vegas! We have tried so many Chinese restaurants, always sick afterwards or not happy with some or all of the food and most likely dissatisfied with service as well. We probably won't try any more restaurants here in town. Service is top notch and the food is so tasty. It's usually always busy when we go or order pick up, but the turnover is quick."}
{"text":"Would never order from this place again.. I had order for delivery.. Called them at 5:37pm. And this should of been my sign.. She told me that it was gonna take more than 45 mins. I said.. That's fine.. She sighs and says what can I get you. I ordered my food anyways.. It is now 7:03pm. Still no food!! I had called at 6:45pm to see how long till the food gets here.. Why says that it has not left the restaurant yet.. I said to the boyfriend, forget it and let's order from China one.. He says lets just wait, I'm sure the food will be here soon... Never again!! This place is a joke and the people that work there is a joke!! Terrible customer service whether it's delivery or not.. That's not a way to treat your customer!! It's 7:06pm and still no food!! Didn't know it takes an hour and half or more for delivery!!"}
{"text":"I have been able to swing by and pick up food at the last minute! They are very nice and clean!  Their combos r awesome and yummy! I think they deliver too. Lovely place with nice parking accommodation.  Thank you guys!"}
{"text":"Closest thing to east coast Chinese food!! Egg rolls are best in Vegas.....by far!!!! Make sure to try the Generals Taos chicken as well!!  Have never had anything here that didn't taste bad. Highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  Have never actually been to the restaurant - have only used there delivery.  Super fast and always great.  Definitely, recommend to others."}
{"text":"The best Chinese restaurant! Friendly employees and they are always busy. They have a bunch of shrimp options which is hard to find at other Chinese restaurants. I recommend the Mongolian shrimp and shrimp fried rice! Yum!!"}
{"text":"Pretty awful! I ordered the chicken pad thai, steamed pork buns and the war wonton soup. It was a little more pricy than my normal Chinese place, but I was craving the pork buns. Each item had almost no flavor and I'm fairly certain the veggies used were a little past their prime. To the cook's defense, the presentation was beautiful! Everything looked really good but tasted pretty terrible. $30 down the drain"}
{"text":"good stuff I've finally found in New York style Chinese restaurant....that knows how to cook"}
{"text":"Good food! I wouldn't say the best,but it's the closest taste as NY
The shrimp in all the dishes are always fresh and nice size"}
{"text":"Have ordered from here many times. Good Fast Easy and employees are very nice! Fast and convenient! Try this place for consistent real Chinese food."}
{"text":"I love this place!  They always deliver ahead of the estimated time, and it is very fresh.  I really like the hot and sour soup (especially after a night of drinking).  And the crab Rangoon is delicious as well."}
{"text":"I'm from New York I have been out here 7 years and I have been looking for good Chinese food and it has been very hit and miss. I just moved across the street from this place and figured I'd give it a try. I kept it very simple, I ordered the barbecue spare ribs which a very big in New York. And I ordered a small chicken broccoli to go. The ribs with just shy of being good , they were just okay. I think they were little over cooked but the flavor was very good. The chicken broccoli was just a little better than okay. Did remind me of being back home in New York. The people were nice for the short time I spent in the restaurant. But what I really like is that I was able to get pint size order of chicken broccoli. I usually just order for myself and getting the quart I tend to eat too much, and if the food is really good who wouldn't. Next time I order I will post another review. Stay tuned."}
{"text":"Pros:
Not far from where I live.
Relatively cheap.
Love getting their large house combination rice for $7.30.
Duck sauce! Quack.

Cons:
Ridiculously inauthentic.
Egg rolls contain no meat whatsoever.
Definitely not a fan of the service. The workers can be very rude and impatient and sometimes make fun of customers within earshot.(Although i've also talked about customers that get on my nerves, at least I whisper)

The only reason why I go here is because it's a stones throw away from where I live. If that wasn't the case....I probably wouldn't bother."}
{"text":"After about two years of searching, my wife and I thought we found the go to Chinese place here in Vegas.  The first two times we ordered from there, the food was great. Today I call for delivery...was told 1 1/2 hours. So I opted to pick up the order (they're only five minutes from my home). WE both have colds, so we decided spicy would help. 

We ordered two orders of the chicken skewers...they were BLACK...not just a little overdone-black. So we called the restaurant and let them know, their response was just to give us a store credit. The problem I have is they would even let this order leave the restaurant. You're telling me nobody there does QC? 
I have pictures .
The REAL problem is the lack of consern by management..."}
{"text":"Stay away from here. I'm from New York and they ought not be allowed to use the name. The tables with dirty from previous customers and when I got my food and got home it was horrible we were sick and ended up in urgent care that evening. as for now add to my bacon wrapped shrimp was coated no encased in egg just nasty. Not worth 45.00"}
{"text":"HIDDEN HENDERSON GEM!!! I am a HUGE Chinese food fan and I have been I search for over 8 years! I am originally from NY and as you knew we have some of the best Chinese food there. We ordered Family Dinner B with Won Ton Soup- full of flavor!!, Fried Rice- BOMB!!, Orange Chicken & Cashew Chicken. I forgot to mention the egg rolls best in town!! The food was amazing! The service was very friendly and quick. I will definitely return!!"}
{"text":"So the food was edible and the place seemed clean.  Ordered from grub hub for pickup in 30 minutes.  I got there in 35.  Took them 10 minutes from that point to drop my eggrolls into oil.  total wait in restaurant was 28 minutes.  Food was not very good.  8 of 8 in the family gave it thumbs down.  Some stuff to salty (pork dumplings), other stuff flavorless Eggrolls.  Out of 9 items I could only give 1 of them even 3 stars (ribs)  though my wife did not like them at all."}
{"text":"The only Chinese restaurant we like in the area. Very true to it's name it tastes just like NY Chinese food. Yummy!!"}
{"text":"Not my cup of tea. When you place New York in front of the name, you BETTER be ready to provide flavorful dishes. I must say that I am disappointed also, the smell inside the restaurant kind of had a stitch of either sewage or old mop water. I will not be returning here. It wasn't at all what I was hoping for. Disappointed..."}
{"text":"Our office orders from here quite often. We have never been disappointed. The lunch specials are reasonably priced and it is enough food for at least two people. My favorite are the egg rolls, as they are true NY egg rolls and they are huge. My other favorite is the vegetable fried dumplings. They give you about 8-9 which is a lot. The taste is amazing. The dipping sauce a little garlicky but not overwhelming.  
The delivery is fast. I wish this place was close to home."}
{"text":"Ordered for delivery via Grubhub and was pleasantly surprised.

This is pretty much exactly what I've been looking for since moving here from NY.

The sweet and sour chicken was pretty standard, but I was really pleased with the fried rice and egg rolls.  The rice is actually dark and flavorful as opposed to the bland, yellowish kind that every other place in Vegas has served.  The egg rolls have a thick wrapper and are crunchy and satisfying, unlike the tiny spring rolls that every other place around here tries to pass off as egg rolls.

All in all, I don't see myself ordering from any other places as long as this one's around."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery and service was very quick and convenient.  Food was yummy! We ordered the kung pao chicken, chicken chow mein, and sweet and sour chicken lunch specials.  The portions are huge so you really can't beat the price for the amount of food you get."}
{"text":"This place was sooo good, I came 2 days in a row. Brought my parents the second time."}
{"text":"I'm from New York and we have been bitching about how terrible Chinese food in the valley is forever. This place knocks it out of the park! From the sauce to the eg rolls, this place is cheap and authentic. It's not Five star dining so get over yourselves, it's comfort food. It's perfect fried chicken vs.  cock de vin. Enjoy it for what it is....delicious!"}
{"text":"Great food, very fresh and not too heavy like other chain Chinese restaurants. Very fair pricing and quick service. We go here often."}
{"text":"I dined in at New York Chinese Restaurant for lunch today with my girlfriends and everything was great. They have a $6.95 lunch menu with 10-15 different entrees that come with soup, rice and a crab rangoon. Service was quick and friendly. Each of us really enjoyed our meals - tasted great! My only complaint is the dining room is very small and cramped with very few tables."}
{"text":"This is the best fast food Chinese food I've had in town, hands down. No frills, just great food. As a New York transplant, I am confident you will enjoy it."}
{"text":"If you need a quick, inexpensive Chinese food fix then this will suffice. I thought the people who worked there very friendly but if I'm being honest, the food wasn't really very good and the place was kinda dirty."}
{"text":"My one star review has nothing to do with the food but with the awful service I received on several occasions. I live in North Las Vegas and was recommended this place by someone from my job. My food has always been hot and fresh. On the other hand, every time I place an order online(for pickup), I receive a phone call saying they don't know where my zip code is and ask if I'm coming to pick up my order. I do business on that side of town so I always pick up my food and carry on with my day. Not enough to warrant a complaint, just annoying. On other days, my husband and I dine in for lunch. Today I went for lunch to dine in alone. I drove 20 minutes out of my way to be completely disrespected and shoved out the door. I have never been treated this way by any establishment and couldn't believe they treated me so nastily. They are rude and not very customer service oriented. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"I just found my new favorite place for Chinese food in Las Vegas.  The food was amazing.  I had the BBQ Ribs, Hot and Sour Soup and the Vegetable Chow Mein.  All of it was great."}
{"text":"I ordered for delivery and the delivery was pretty quick but the food smelled bad, tasted bad and made me sick."}
{"text":"solid neighborhood chinese joint. service is friendly but spotty. the first time i was in, i saw the waiter butcher an old lady's order next to me. they got there before me but (hopefully) got her food after i finished eating and left. food is solid. american chinese takeout food. lunch specials and dinner specials are good deals with generous portions of food."}
{"text":"This place always has good food for a good price with a quick delivery for those who wish to eat at home. But one thing I'm learning is to EAT AT HOME. Take it To-Go! For some reason, there's a horrible smell of something rotting and the tiny place is crammed with tables. As for the food, it is good for what you get, don't expect anything extravagant but you get what you paid for. Service isn't the friendliest but I suppose it gets the job done."}
{"text":"The food is ok, just your basic Chinese chain.  However it is nothing like NYC or the east coast for that matter. My experience was almost hostage like creepy. We placed an order from work and while most of it was correct or at least we were able to make it work, one order was not. A co worker ordered French fries and fried shrimp (she isn't a Chinese food fan but was hungry). She got shrimp friend rice. She threw it out and decided not to eat. We called NY Chinese to see if they would fix the order. They recognized it was their mistake and sent out fried shrimp and French fries almost immediately. Here is the creepy part.... They admitted to sending us the wrong dish, they insisted on sending us the right dish HOWEVER the delivery guy would not leave until he got the shrimp friend rice back! We work at an animal hospital and the trash it went into had kitty litter and feces in it. He didn't care, he wanted it back to prove we didn't eat the rice, otherwise we owed them $3! So we sent him on his way with the rice and 12 emptied litter pans. Hope his Subaru enjoyed that stench. Never again because if they took out kitty litter and traveled with it, how sanitary are they!?!"}
{"text":"\"Hey, hey! I want a Chinese take away! hey, hey! woo woo woo!\"  - The Adicts

My wife was craving some Chinese food, but instead of going to Little Dumpling which is our go to because it's near our house. I hit up a place I'd haven't tried yet, New York Chinese Restaurant. Located near Horizon Ridge and Green Valley Parkway across from Petsmart and Sprouts, it has a very smallish interior of a few small tables for eating in.
I ordered the usual suspects, house special fried rice, chicken Lo mein, and General Tso's Chicken (hint of chili pepper, chunks of fried loveliness bathed in a sweet sauce). But instead of the standard beef dish, I ordered something that caught my eye on the menu...Under the Chef's specials they had Butterfly Shrimp Jumbo. Butterflied shrimp wrapped in bacon, dipped and fried in an egg batter with mixed veggies...heaven, like a big omelet blanket of shrimpy, porky deliciousness atop a bed of sautéed bamboo shoots, mushrooms and broccoli. My new fave, you gotta try it!
New York Chinese Restaurant (in Henderson), I'll be back."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible, fried won tons were soggy not crispy, chow fun soggy overcooked vegies and shrimp... chicken wings tiny and old tasting... I would never order again from this place..."}
{"text":"So far I'd say its average for Chinese food.  But the price is good.  Especially for the location (near Anthem)."}
{"text":"If you're from the east coast this is definitely the closest you're going to get to east coast Chinese food. They have lunch specials till 4pm. I love their sesame chicken. Their crab rangoon is pretty decent. I would suggest to call in your order to pick it up. It's in a good area and there is plenty of parking."}
{"text":"Pretty good for local take out & delivery. Unfortunately the deliver often takes an hour or longer. Our last order had a large container of soup that was broken and it filled the bag it was delivered in and saturated the rest of our food. When we called to explain what happened rather than credit our next order for the same amount ... The manager said he could only offer 20% off our next order. We will not be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"My family and I are originally from the east coast (NY & CT) and we are SO glad to have found this place! We have suffered through sub-par Chinese cuisine for several years and can not believe this place has been here all along!  (Thanks to Eat24 for the head's up!)

The egg rolls are spot-on! JUST LIKE HOME! Big, crispy and absolutely delicious! The wonton soup is second to none! Ribs, General Tso's chicken, Lo Mein, Fried rice... all just like we remember! 

Always great value and fast service! We will never order from another Chinese food establishment as long as we are in Vegas/Henderson!"}
{"text":"They could probably wash the walls, they are all pretty dirty. The food was excellent though. I would defiantly come back, but only for take out."}
{"text":"Gave it three stars only because the shrimp fried rice is my bf favorite but their teriyaki bowls are awful their chicken is dry and weird tasting and they dont have the amount of veggies most bowls have. And it's not saucy I was very disappointed."}
{"text":"I come from the east coast and we have always ate Chinese food on New Years Eve, a little tradition. I have yet to find a place as good as the east coast Chinese but this place does the trick. It is for sure American style so I wouldn't go here for authentic gourmet Chinese or anything. Egg rolls, crab rags, orange chicken, wonton soup...all great. This will be my go to for those greasy little treats I crave here and there."}
{"text":"Our go to delivery spot for Chinese. Tasty food, great service and the delivery people are always pleasant. Their combination dinners are well priced and they give you tons of food! The Mongolian Beef is a standout for sure! (Be advised it's spicy, which I love!) As a New Englander who has lived in NYC I miss tasty Chinese take out! Fortunately we have found a good alternative in New York Chinese!"}
{"text":"Wow... I can't believe it.. Their most popular item, the general Tso's chicken, doesn't really contain any chicken. I'm sitting here having cut every piece open and theres hardly anything resembling chicken in here at all. What the hell? How can you charge 10 dollars for this? Merry Christmas to you too... Big mistake."}
{"text":"The prices are low and the wonton soup is good. The brown rice was moist and cooked just right. As for the sweet and sour chicken--it's white meat bits  so that's good, but the breading was soggy and flavorless and the sauce just wasn't good. But the service was nice--they refill your drinks even though the dispenser is out for the public. I thought they were friendly and I'm pretty sure I'll go back since I'm in the area occasionally."}
{"text":"Ordered take out one evening after driving past this place many times. 1st time I've been able to get real chow mien like what I used to get back home. Most Chinese places out here think that lo mien is chow mien - well they are not. Was able to substitute shrimp in the combination chow mien dinner for the same price. With the combo meal you get a choice of hot sour soup, wonton soup, or egg drop soup, comes with an egg roll & crab rangoon (was greasy & not cooked all the way), then a choice of pork fried rice, steamed rice or brown rice. Was surprised to see that you could get brown rice w/o having to pay extra. Enough food for 2 meals & all under $9.25. All in all I think it was good. Fast friendly service. Think that it's probably just as good if not better than China A Go-Go. Less $$ as well. I would order from here again."}
{"text":"Just tried this place again, and in 1 week......everything was the same,,,,excellent. This is now our go to place for Chinese."}
{"text":"The pot stickers and spicy beef are my favorite here. I ask them to leave out any veggies and just add extra peanuts. When I place an order for delivery it can take sometimes 2 or more hours and if I pick up the order sometimes I am still left waiting. My wife just thinks the food is okay and gets too upset with how long delivery is so I most of the time just pick up dinner for myself if she is working late. They have coupons inside so you can get something free depending on how much you order. If I am working in the area then the lunch specials are the best deal so I try and eat here then. The soup isn't that special but it comes with the lunch specials."}
{"text":"We order from this place A LOT and their food is delicious, but time after time we never get any of the extras that we ask for. We only get soy sauce enough for one person, we didn't get any sweet and sour sauce for our egg rolls. No silverware at all. It's just kind of frustrating that we never receive any of the things that we list under the notes section. I had to send my boyfriend to get me silverware and a bottle of soy sauce which kind of defeats the purpose of having your food delivered since he has to go somewhere anyway."}
{"text":"After ordering online and waiting over 40 minutes I had to call them to make sure they were bringing my order... lady on the phone was rude... the sodas were placed in with the hot food so they were warm... there was no soy sauce or forks... the food was bland.. the only good thing was the egg drop soup.. I would definitely choose another Chinese place!"}
{"text":"This is the only Chinese food I've found in Las Vegas that I like. I've tried their beef fried rice, orange chicken, spring rolls, and Kung pao beef. All of it was perfect. Other places in town have this after taste that I hate or no flavor at all. Not this place though! I look forward to trying more. Highly recommend to anyone!"}
{"text":"This place actually had pretty good food for having such a weird name. It's worth a try if you like Chinese food."}
{"text":"I don't know how the food is because when I ordered last night it never arrived. I had a family of 5 waiting for the doorbell to ring. It was a peanut butter and jelly night. A lot cheaper than the 70 dollars in food I never received.  If you order have a back up plan."}
{"text":"I chose New York Chinese Restaurant because it was the closest Chinese Restaurant my gps pulled up at the time and man did I luck out because I absolutely love  this place! Its great food/service/portion size  all for a more than reasonable price! I constantly have my order delivered & have not once been unsatisfied with the service."}
{"text":"I want to leave the a one star rating...  It took them almost two hours to deliver us food the other day.  BUT the food was so good I forgave them immediately.  Still a must try!"}
{"text":"Ate some good from here, only because I didn't pay. The food has absolutely no flavor, the soy sauce made my white rice black, not the usual brown color soy sauce makes. Got beef and broccoli, chow mein and some other stuff with mushrooms. Never again."}
{"text":"\"New York\" style Chinese food must mean bland Chinese food made w/o fresh ingredients.  For someone raised dining in San Francisco's Chinatown restaurants, this stuff borders on inedible.  I've actually not found a decent Chinese restaurant in Las Vegas west of Rainbow Blvd, but have found dozens on and nearby the Spring Mountain corridor.  I can't imagine choosing to eat here instead of say, China Mama, HK Star, or Orchids Garden (on Sahara).  I'd rather eat at Panda Express than NY Chinese.

I guess it's a regional thing.  My neighbors from New York think this place is the greatest.  If you were raised on west coast Chinese food, you'll probably think it is as awful as I do."}
{"text":"Love this place. Great chinese food and affordable prices. I can't even make this stuff cheaper at home. Service is so-so, but the food always tastes yummy and the price is right. They also offer delivery, but I prefer to pickup since i live close by
Try their black pepper chicken, it's the best!"}
{"text":"This review is based on my take-out order.  I came here to order just Won Ton soup but after checking out the menu I couldn't resist the great deal they had for the Family Dinner. It's a good value for what you get. 
 
Choice of 3 soups (Won Ton, Hot&Sour and Egg Drop) got the Won Ton - the dumpling was pretty meaty and wrap texture was al dente, chewy bite to it. (I like it cooked more and softer)  The broth was full of flavor, steamy hot, sprinkled with bits of chopped green onions and slivers of char siu pork, for me it was pretty basic and just a tad salty though  Mr B. says I have hypersensitive taste buds and he thought this was the best Won Ton soup by far. 

3 different appetizers are also included; egg rolls, crab rangoons, and fried shrimp. Egg Rolls had a crunchy outer layer but wrapper inside was a little chewy, filling of veggies and pork was pretty good, but a little greasy. Crab rangoons had alot of filling and fried shrimp was okay..more batter than shrimp. 

Entrees - choice of TWO! Got the Pork Egg Foo Yung and Sweet and Sour Pork. EFY came with 3 huge thick patties and separate container full of brown gravy. Cooked perfectly. This was my favorite dish. Also the S&S Pork did not disappoint.  It's the westernized version where pork is coated in batter and deep fried. Nice chunk of bite size juicy pork, but batter was on the thicker side.  S&S sauce is like every other place. I liked the sauce and pork were packed separately for take out. 

Big plus for me is choice of brown rice in this meal. Or you can have Pork Fried Rice or steamed rice.

Dining area is small,  but plenty of seating, layout of tables and chairs are designed to fit at least 7 tables of 4.  There is also a large screen TV. Artwork on the walls and pretty water feature and bamboo plants as part of the decor. The kitchen in the back looks pretty snazzy and clean as well. 

Service was....curt... employee at counter took my order which at first was misunderstood, said I ordered some dish as my first entree, but I never told employee my first choice. No apology for mistake, no welcome, no small talk even when I tried to initiate it.  Pretty much straightforward till I got my order was when employee managed to crack a smile and say thank you.  
 
So overall 3.5ish. Counter service could use little more improvement. Food is pretty good it hits the spot when craving Chinese food, I appreciate the choices and menu selections. The prices they charge are very reasonable and servings were more than enough"}
{"text":"First, thank you Yelpers for rating this place; I found it on here! Today, I tried New York Chinese Restaurant, and it was the best Chinese food that I have eaten in the Las Vegas area. The hot and sour soup was amazing. I tried the hunan chicken and it was delicious. The Moo goo gai pan was good, according to my friend."}
{"text":"Super close to home. Bf always gets the s&s chicken.. Sauce comes on the side so it's never soggy. Service is great!"}
{"text":"Curry chicken! Best deal ever.. their lunch specials are great.. It's great for a quick, convenient  run in and get out type place with tasty dishes"}
{"text":"We have been ordering from here for 4 years and LOVE it!  This is the only place my husband will order from since they do not use MSG. Large portions. Great flavor - I've never had something bad from here.  I always go in, order, and take to-go, but there are a few tables if you prefer to eat-in.  I have not used their delivery service as it started after I moved out of Summerlin, so it would be too far."}
{"text":"The food was good. Unfortunately, one of the ladies at the counter was rude so I will not be revisiting. Customer service should be the first priority."}
{"text":"1st time my wife and I got food here it was ok..we ordered egg roll which was horrible, definitely not New York style..We also ordered beef and brocolli which was just ok. The second time we went there my wife ordered chicken mein fun when we got home she immedietly got sick. This New Yorker won't be going back..I'm not going to spend another night cleaning up my wife's vomit."}
{"text":"We stopped in to try them for lunch. I am glad we did!  

We were greeted immediately by the very friendly lady behind the counter.  She was over to get our drink order as we looked over the menu.   Everything she did, she did with a smile.  Our drinks were brought out quickly as was our lunch order.  They have great lunch specials that come with soup, rice and a crab rangoon.  Yum.  

I had ordered the shrimp and broccoli with the brown rice. The shrimp were large and the broccoli was steamed to perfection.  Delicious.  The wonton soup that accompanied my meal was also fabulous.  Great flavor in everything I ate.  

There is plenty of parking all around and their quaint little restaurant was very clean.  I was happy to finally try them! Thanks NY Chinese!"}
{"text":"AVOID!!! This place is naaasty. Egg rolls had no flavor and some bright pink stuff that was supposed to be meat. The water tasted of chlorine. There was a hair on my plate. General tso chicken had tendons in it. My wife threw up after we left. Do not go to this place."}
{"text":"My wife and I were craving Chinese takeout, since we can't get any at home. We checked out a lot of places near the Strip and found most of them either way too authentic or way too upscale/stylized/Asian (think PF Chang's). 

A Yelper suggested we try New York Chinese. It's basically a takeout place, although it has a couple of tables if you wanted to eat there. We had egg roll, shrimp egg foo young (nice fresh shrimp and the gravy was the kind we like, made with flour, not the clear shiny gravy), chicken chow mein (they called it Hong Kong style with the crispy noodles). It is way out there on Ft. Apache off of Spring Mountain, but you do what you have to do to fill that Chinese take-out craving. We are definitely putting it on our Las Vegas list."}
{"text":"Terrible service! When I called in my order they said it would be 15 minutes.  When I paid my check they said it would be a few minutes. Hour and  10 minutes later I finally asked for my money back. While I was waiting I noticed how dirty the restaurant was. Not sure what is going on maybe new management?"}
{"text":"Good value Chinese restaurant with above average taste compared to Vegas standards.  My personal favs are ny crispy noodle, house fried rice and hot and sour soup.  Price is very reasonable as well."}
{"text":"Good ol' greasy chinese food. Pretty much what you'd expect from a \"fast food\" Chinese restaurant. Lunch specials are pretty good. If you're thinking of ordering á la carte just opt for the dinner combos. It's a dollar or two more and you basically end up getting the same amount of food with an extra egg roll or rangoon. My kids love the egg drop soup & chow mein."}
{"text":"Im not a fan of Chinese, my husband is the main reason we order Chinese food. Moving out here from Jersey City, NJ you've got pretty big shoes to fill in the Chinese food department but they've got it covered hands down. The chicken fried rice, crab rangoons and wonton soup is my fav. My husband and daughter LOVE the wings. I took away a star for price. Just a tad pricey but for good food I would pay. I also took away a star because they dont have crab sticks LOL man I miss that."}
{"text":"After seeing some reviews, we decided to try.  I love west coast Chinese and nice interior dining which I have yet to find.  Took it to go and honestly with the the interior, debated about that even.  Long story short I ordered BBQ ribs and instead of fried rice I asked for chow mein and paid extra. When we got home they certainly we not the short drop off the bone ribs I was antcipating.  They were pork ribs about 5 to 6 inches long and dry and tough with a foul taste.  I ended up with very untasty noodles  instead of chow mein that I paid extra for.  The soup had no flavor and the spring rolls were not worth commenting!
My son got sweet and sour pork...the sauce was watered down and very little of it.  We ate very little and ordered a pizza!  WORST CHINESE I'VE EVER HAD IN 20 YEARS ALL OVER THE COUNTRY!  Sorry I wasted $22 for the garbage.
Eat st your own risk...I don't know how anyone could rate higher unless they don't know what good Chinese is.  Seriously don't think it was a bad day."}
{"text":"This is the second time I've at here in the past week. The wonton soup is amazing and their pork fried rice is some of the best I've ever had. You also can't go wrong with the ragoons. As far as the meals I've had the sweet and sour pork, which is your typical fried pork with sauce on the side, but the pieces of meat are large and juicy, much better than other places I've had. The orange chicken is flat out the best I've had so far in Vegas. The portion sizes are massive, one combo is plenty to feed two people and still have leftovers. I love that you can order online, the delivery was timely, though with the amount of food you are given ordering $15 worth seems unnecessary. Pick up was fast, the food ready in the time it took me to drive there. Just be make sure to double check your order, in case something was forgotten, like my soup almost was. Other than that easily fixed mistake, one of my new favorite places to get food when I'm too lazy to cook for myself."}
{"text":"Ordered the lunch specials - cashew chicken and shrimp in lobster sauce, fried rice, hot and sour soup, wonton soup, crab wonton and an order of egg rolls. Reasonably priced and good. One downfall - the \"lobster\" in the lobster sauce was crab sticks and there was more  \"sauce \" than shrimp. Decent food. Decent price. Decent quantity."}
{"text":"Very good place often get my lunch since I work right next to it. Haven't been disappointed not once!  just pretty long wait from time to time, placing an order is the way to go when your wanting to eat here !"}
{"text":"Two weeks ago we ordered our usual order. It took two hours for delivery. I was irritated, but chalked it up to unusual service. We have always been pleased in the past.
Tonight, we tried again. Two hours have passed so far. 3 phone calls. STILL not here.
Never again. Get your shit together or stop taking delivery  orders."}
{"text":"Awesome food, close to home and fast delivery! Definitely will order from here again. Thank you!"}
{"text":"We ordered take out,  very disappointed.  Well at least they got the order right,  no onions in the chicken fried rice,  Mongolian beef & wor wonton soup.  Let's start with the soup. .. wontons were hard: super al dente &the shrimp tasted fishy.  The chicken fried rice had no egg in it & too little chicken,beef was tough,  dry,  chewy,  very fatty.  The order came with fat crunchy noodles that didn't taste great & there was no dipping Sauce  for it. No napkins,  chopsticks,  forks or spoons for the take out order.  :/ definitely not worth $22"}
{"text":"I was a very frequent customer & liked this place a lot. BUT NOW I WOULD NEVER GIVE THEM BUSINESS AGAIN. Not only did they get my order completely wrong, but when I called back to ask them to fix their mistake, the woman refused to accept responsibility and told me I was wrong. I get this order about once a week & for some odd reason they got it wrong this once. But to not accept responsibility, not come back out with the correct food, & telling the customer they were the ones that made the mistake is absolutely ridiculous and horrible business."}
{"text":"Decent quick chinese take out restaurant.  I like that you can order online through yelp.  My order was correct with no problems.  

The food was hot and seemed fresh.  The offered both a large and small size.  Most places don't and the small was perfect for one.  All dinner items seem to come only with steamed rice.  I prefer fried rice.  

I will return to this location.  I would say it is worth a try if you are nearby."}
{"text":"Delicious tasty food Great prices They deliver"}
{"text":"Whenever I eat Chinese (and by Chinese I mean western style take out food) I pretty much always get the same thing

-Crab Rangoon (cream cheese wantons)
-Sweet and Sour Chicken
-Pork fried rice


So my review is based solely on these items. Most of the deduction came from the crab rangoons although overall the meal was aggressively mediocre.

Crab Rangoon

A good CR should be crispy on the outside, and stuffed full of moist, gooey cream cheese and fake crab meat. The ration of filling to pastry should be such that there is barely enough pastry to hold the filling inside and no more. These CRs have way too much pastry and not enough filling. This produces a CR that is really dry and no matter how much sweet and sour sauce you slather it in (as a professional slatherer I should know) the taste/texture is never quite right. In addition, unclear if this is because of too much pastry, the whole thing was very very dry- no delicious moistness. 

Sweet and Sour chicken

Getting take out SSC has a few pitfalls
-if they mix the sauce beforehand the chicken will be way to wet/not crispy
-if they don't mix there is a chance the steam from the dish will make everything inside mushy
-they can have vegetables mixed in

This one was actually dec. The chicken wasn't super crisp but they wisely did not premix the sauce so it was salvageable.

Pork Fried Rice
Not enough egg , but other than that acceptable."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of NY Chinese and this is about as close as it gets. For the price it's hard to beat, especially for lunch. I go here all the time and have always had a good experience. The place isn't always clean and sometimes their delivery is slow, but generally a good value for above average food with above average service. Price point on dinner and lunch specials put them from a 3 to a 4 Star."}
{"text":"They have it going on!  We have dined in and taken out and have never been disappointed.  The service is good to boot!  We ordered orange chicken, chicken fried rice and a couple soups and the order was accurate, prompt and delicious."}
{"text":"In my opinion this is the best Chinese food in Las Vegas. It's the only authentic NY style Chinese restaurant I have found in Las Vegas in 7 years of looking and tasting. The food is excellent. They don't even deliver to where I live but it's so worth the drive over there. Most Chinese restaurants in the area don't have the authentic NY style packets of duck sauce, or the NY style egg rolls NY Chinese has both!  Amazing food. I highly recommend them."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good here. Not Great, but pretty good,  and it's very inexpensive.  The one problem I have with this place is that I always order delivery and they NEVER send utensils or napkins...even when I ask them to.  Very rude if you ask me. Idc if it's going to a residence, you should send everything that a person might need. Especially when you were asked to! Start giving me utensils and I'll bump you up to 4 stars! Oh yeah,  also, the potstickers are pretty good,  but the sauce is awful! Too much 5 - spice powder! My chicken and broccoli this time also tastes like 5 - spice powder. Hot and sour soup is awesome though!"}
{"text":"I wanted to eat American Chinese food for lunch and I thought I might as well give this place a try. I have to say I like my usual place way better than this place.
I had the general chicken lunch special. The general chicken was ok, could be better. The hot and sour soup's ingredient was a little off, that's not how hot and sour soup is supposed to be, what's with the preserved vegetables?
The other problem is the fried rice, it doesn't taste like fried rice at all. It's like they cooked the rice with the ingredients in the rice cooker and mix some soy sauce in it for color. It seems like they didn't fry it at all. The bbq pork's color was too red and it doesn't taste like regular bbq pork that I used to have when I was living in Hong Kong.
I have never tried Chinese food from New York, but if this is how New York Chinese food is, then it's really not as great as people say it is."}
{"text":"The other reviews must not know chinese food.
Anyone who comes from east coast knows chinese food, and this place
SUCKED! It was the worst of the worst!!"}
{"text":"Just had my first order delivered from here. I was impressed with the quality of the food. The egg drop soup was still hot, thank you so much! Beef lo mien noodles was tasty with a hint of garlic.... which I love garlic! As usual I ordered more than needed but that's just what I do. The seafood fried rice had shrimp, calamari and imitation crab (not a big fan of imitation crab). When I saw the imitation crab, I just knew it was not going to be good but to my surprise, it was pretty tasty. The shrimp fried rice was tasty (you can never go wrong with shrimp fried rice by the way). The pork fried wonton, cooked a little too long but still was ok. Now onto the orange chicken... I am not a fan of by the way but decided I'd give it a try. I'm very thankful that I did, it was actually pretty good. So bottom line here, if you're looking for some fair priced Chinese food, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"I'm originally from NY and am super picky when it comes to my Chinese food! New York Chinese is the closest to home I could get with the flavors and menu options!"}
{"text":"By far our favorite Chinese place, because the have pork egg rolls that are delish.  No-one else in the Vegas area has real egg rolls, atleast that we have found in the last 8 yrs. All the other food is above average too.  Only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because of service.  They need a bigger dining area and more employees. It's so busy they can't handle it sometimes and there is nowhere to sit."}
{"text":"New York Chinese. Not quite. Don't let the name fool you. When I saw Butterfly Shrimp on the online menu I was overjoyed,when I saw the Butterfly Shrimp on my plate I was far from overjoyed. It was like shrimp egg foo yung with bacon. One piece instead of individually wrapped shrimp. 
All three dishes we ordered were soaked in the same brown sauce. It wasn't horrible but it wasn't great. Zero individuality between the dishes. It was a let down & we won't return."}
{"text":"This place was right by the Walgreen's I was at, so I stopped in to get some food to go. I was feeling a bit under the weather and didn't want something heavy, so I decided a large wonton soup. While I was there though, I decided to get some pork fried rice as well. My total was just under $10, not bad! I sent my boyfriend to get some food for himself from the pizza place next door, thinking we had some time to spare. Not even 2 minutes after I paid, my food was ready to go. Scary.

The wonton soup was darker than others I have had. The broth was brown, something I am not used too. Unfortunately for me this meant the soup was old and not tasty at all. Even the wontons were old and almost tasted spoiled. The fried rice was a bit crunchy and lukewarm. I only ate a few bites of rice and drank about half a cup of the broth from the soup before I tossed everything in the trash. Luckily I didnt get sick. I won't be back."}
{"text":"I order from NY Chinese about once a month and it's great. The orange chicken is amazing and they have the best egg rolls in town hands down. I would say their family meal is one of the best deals in town hands down. If it was up to my daughter we would order there everyday Lol!"}
{"text":"I don't even know that this is worth one star. I will give it one star because the fortune cookies are good. This was horrible. The WORST Chinese food I have ever eaten. It was close to my house and after a long day I did not want to cook. I did a pick order, had to wait 45 minutes. I ordered Chicken with broccoli, it was horrible. I ordered Chicken Lo-Mein, again horrible. The third entree was Mongolian Chicken, it was average.  The Crab Rangoon was greasy and nasty tasting. The hot and sour soup tasted like beefy dog food. We will not be back. The sad thing is this place was busy with to go orders and the phone was ringing off the hook. Sad! I guess when you are looking for Chinese in Sun City Summerlin and this is the only place near by, people make it work. Not this person. It was disgusting."}
{"text":"This is a great place! The food is delicious!
Magie & Andy are the best! This is authentic 
Chinese food. I would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Love this place. Food is always freshly prepared, and the lunch specials are around $7 and come with won ton and a crab Rangoon. Hell yes. Wasn't sure if I was imagining that they were a cut above other Chinese restaurants, then recently tried China One in the north and quickly realized the difference. Never going astray again."}
{"text":"I placed an order for pickup.  Their timing was excellent.  My food was ready to go when they said it would be.

ATMOSPHERE:  There are tables available but I think this was designed to be a delivery or pick-up kind of location.  The tables and atmosphere are for quick-service.

FOOD:  
Cream Cheese wontons - EXCELLENT.  I couldn't even wait until I got them home.  It helped that I was hungry, but these were delightful and I could have made a meal on just these.
Egg Drop Soup:  Bland, I am sorry to say.  I spiced it up with a little soy and some hot sauce, but it really had no other flavor at all.
Dragon & Phoenix - I was looking forward to this because I love both chicken and shrimp and had not seen combos with both.  I did special order it with carrots and water chestnuts only as I don't like the abundance of onions and green peppers that usually accompany Chinese entrees.  They did an excellent job of making it in accordance with my request.  The portions were more than generous.  I MAYBE ate 1/3 of my entree before I was stuffed  But the flavors, again, were a bit bland.  Perhaps it had to do with the way that I ordered the veggies.  There was no spice either which surprised me because it was supposed to be General Tso's.  

OVERALL:  Not a bad place to eat and I would definitely try it again - this time I'll let them make it the way it's supposed to be made so that I can get the full flavor."}
{"text":"Recently moved to Las Vegas.  My son and I were craving Chinese food.  He ordered online and had it delivered.  I was pleasantly surprised.  It was the BEST won ton soup I have ever had.   My son thought so too.  We ordered combo dinners and I love their sweet & sour chicken.  My son loves their chicken Lo mein.  We have now ordered three different times and their won ton soup is consistently the best we have had.  The only problem we have ever had was they forgot our egg rolls with our last order.   I would definitely recommend this restaurant to my family and friends."}
{"text":"first time there. finally a place that knows what egg drop soup is, without green giant corn floting in it. low main ---yes---not chow foo.  closes thing to new york here in vegas. thank you!!!!"}
{"text":"The food is still disgusting since they changed owners.Its not the same... And its far from New York style chinese food. I'vd had New York chinese its cooked fresh and the quality of beef and chicken is good.I tried to give this place one more chance. The fried rice was either old or overcooked with too much soy sauce. The beef broccoli was terrible, the grade of beef is inferior. It was too chewy and I didnt like the flavor. The only thing that was meh was the chinese spare ribs, I'vd had better!... Plus, the guy at the register had a bad attitude ...which prepared me for the let down.This was the last and final time I will come to this establishment. Never again!"}
{"text":"Normally we have received good food but tonight I tried the Kung Pao Shrimp dinner combination - after waiting almost an hour when was told half that time my dinner had a Whole 2 little shrimp but a lot of celery, green pepper and rice! Guess they forgot shrimp dish includes Shrimp"}
{"text":"For what it looks inside, the food quality caught be by surprise. I've been here only once, and I ordered the Hong Kong pan fried noodle, which was really, REALLY good, and I have tried that dish at almost every Chinese restaurant I've been at--this place definately met my expectations! Even a whole tray for just under $10 was worth it. I'll be back."}
{"text":"All I want is good orange chicken....  They show it as spicy on menu and you can order it xtra spicy which I did.  Even confirmed they got xtra spicy and they said yes.   There was No spice at all.  Even without I wouldn't eat here again. Can't find good orange chicken in this town to save my life!!"}
{"text":"By far THE BEST Chinese food in town. The Lo Mein is probably the most tasteful I've ever had. My wife says it's because the recipes are from New York; whatever the reason, this place has spoiled me. I won't go anywhere else!"}
{"text":"The reviews vary greatly. I think the negative reviews have a lot to do with cheap people having unrealistic and unfair expectations.  At this price point, you have to understand that little money is going into the overhead and general aesthetics.  Thus, when evaluating the merit of this place, it is only fair if the focus of the reviews is on the food - not the decor or even the efficiency of their delivery (the fact they even have delivery is deserving of admiration).  

When it comes to food, this place excels. The menu is extensive.  We tried several things and everything we had was delicious and the portions were generous.  Highly affordable spot for fast and delicious Chinese food.  When dining in, manage your expectations accordingly - you're paying little for awesome Chinese food."}
{"text":"Yes, really... 5 stars in my world anyway.  

As a former New Englander/New Yorker I can say that there is a distinct flavor (variety of spices) that is used there and I had been unable to replecate until I came across this place.  Hip Hip Hooray for that discovery!!

The prices are quite agreeable, especially the combos that are offered and are my usual grab and go orders.  Serving portions are really quite ample and the service is propmt and efficient.  If your looking for upscale and snobbery, this is not your place.  If your looking for something that reminds you of an New York Chinese experience of past, then this place is for you.

Highly recommend the Cashew Chicken and the soup... Damn, now Im getting hungry!"}
{"text":"We LOVE this place!!  Best Chinese food we've had in the Valley, by a MILE!  Yes, as Timothy said, the place is Chinese food for Americans.  If you want authentic Chinese cuisine, you usually won't find it at a take-out place.  Don't get that rating.  Anyway, the service is great, efficient and friendly.  I've ordered probably 20 different menu items and never been disappointed in the least.  Sometimes they're a little slow in clearing off the tables for new guests, but they're just really busy, so I guess that's a good sign.  I can't really say anything bad about this place.   Very affordable too.  Love it!!"}
{"text":"I was hesitant to try another Chinese restaurant. The last one lasted for one bite and then the trash. This time this restaurant proved itself capable of providing  a decent meal. I ordered the combination Sesame Chicken dinner. The soup was very good and thick noodles were provided. The egg roll was very good as was the wonton. Th Sesame chicken was crispy and Would have been very good but I did not like a spice they used. Definitely too much food. I will return to try a different entree. Worth a visit!"}
{"text":"Yummy! First time ordering food for delivery. Was fast and tastes amazing!! We ordered Hot & spicy beef, house fried rice, chicken lo mein (which is like chow mein lol ), shrimp in garlic sauce & the meat egg rolls. LOVED IT ALL! Def will be my new go to for Chinese delivery!"}
{"text":"Service ... Needs to improve but the food is surprisingly good. Shanghai noodles is excellent. I am sure the service upfront will get better. I think main issue is language. The food is good. I was not expecting much totally surprised. Give it a try."}
{"text":"Ordered NY chinese last week, and now again this week. this time with some friends who are always ordering chinese takeout. I figured i wanted to see their opinions.

We called ahead and asked for the broccoli and beef (large).  

Beef and broccoli was good, nice amount of beef. they didnt skimp. It had a little too much sauce for my liking but everyone else loved it. I'm not a saucy person. 

The lemon chicken had such a light and fresh batter on it. It came on a huge bed of lettuce with fresh lemons. The lemon sauce was on the side and it was a ton! The chicken was very tender, not over cooked at all. I didnt like the lemon sauce, it was very sweet and thick so i skipped it. 

Orange chicken was same as last time. I'm still a sucker for the orange chicken at Panda Express but this is a nice second place. I liked that this time it had pieces of broccoli. Got to get those veggies in! Just shows that they arent consistant though.

OOOH and we also ordered a side of the crab ragoons and they were so crispy and perfect. I was impressed with the amount of crab/creamy cheesy stuff on the inside. 

They told me it would be ready in less than 20 mins and when we went in 15 mins later it was ready to go! (and they were super busy too, so glad i called ahead!) Quick and fresh, cant complain!

It was really cheap, less than 30 bucks for four people and we had left overs for the next day! The entrees were 8 bucks each and all came with steamed rice. Winner!"}
{"text":"Chicken wings and crab rangoo from here and youll be back everyday. The best I had in a very long time"}
{"text":"I order here probably once a week, pretty good food when your starving. I like the dinner combos that come w the hot and sour soup. Yum!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing food! It had been a long time since I had east coast Chinese food, and this place doesn't disappoint! Lunch specials are great as well with perfect portion sizes. Staff always seemed friendly too. Granted I never walked in with that east coast attitude, but hey. Can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"As I sit here, in an empty restaurant for over an hour.  I contemplate my decision to have food here. Please god spare me from coming inside ever again."}
{"text":"1st time eating here. Will definitely come back!  Crab Rangoon is outta sight...sweet, generous filling & light crispy wonton.  Wonderful. Happy I shared a large sweet and sour chicken + fried rice with my husband.  Very generous portions.  Chicken was tender and coated in the S&S sauce, had some pineapple chunks in it but no other veggies. I guess the only improvement in my opinion would be if the chicken was a little crispier.  Anxious to go back & try something new!!"}
{"text":"Great food, friendly and helpful staff, and really good lunch deals.  Have eaten here twice now, tried the veggie Lo mein w/ egg drop Soup, then had the pork fried rice and broccoli with garlic sauce- loved everything!"}
{"text":"If you order 2 hours ahead you might get your food in time for dinner. Horrible service!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Food is always fresh. I feel special every time I pick up my food. I feel like I have my own chef!! I got their teriyaki chicken and their bbq pork and it was delicious!"}
{"text":"Very good.  Closest to East coast Chinese food we could find.  Very good and close to home."}
{"text":"I'm Chinese and from NJ. I've spent a lot of time having authentic Chinese food in Chinatown, NY as I lived very close to Manhattan. I've had my fair share of Chinese takeout places (which is not authentic) back at home. I tried a couple places when I moved to Las Vegas last year -- Grand China and China-a-Go-Go -- and I thought they were okay for what they were. When we moved to Summerlin (we were up in Aliante previously), I was excited to try this place because they boast that their food is New York style Chinese. At first, I thought that mean the food was like what you'd find in a Chinatown, not Chinese takeout, and I thought it was kinda neat that there was a place like this closer to where we were (although I don't mind having to go to Las Vegas' \"Chinatown\" for some good Chinese food; my favorites so far are KJ Kitchen and Joyful House). However, after reading the reviews here, it seemed like my first impression was incorrect. The first time we ordered from here further confirmed that. I don't really know what NY style supposed to mean. To me, there's just real Chinese food and there's Americanized Chinese food. This would fall under the latter. 

The first time, I ordered chicken and broccoli, which was all right, but I've definitely had better from a Chinese takeout place. It seems that this place has a tendency to not change or wash pots when preparing different dishes. I found some noodles mixed in with my chicken and broccoli and it also tasted like curry, leftovers from a previous order I presume. The second time we ordered, I got Mongolian beef. Again, I got a little bit of noodles in there. However, there was no curry flavor. It's not a problem, I guess. My main gripe about this dish was that the cut of beef that they used was very chewy. I made the mistake of eating a few pieces at one time and made a piece of super beef. It was so stringy and rubbery that I couldn't break it apart without chewing it for a few minutes. And I didn't feel comfortable trying to swallow the entire wad of what felt like jerky, though I probably could've. Additionally, I wasn't sure if I'd have any stomach problems later from swallowing a chunk of super tough meat, so I chewed it for like three minutes and then I was finally able to break it up a bit more (I did have to use a fork to break up a sinewy part) and swallowed them in smaller pieces. My jaw got tired from chewing, so I saved half of it for later.

My boyfriend liked his General Tso's chicken and curry chicken. I think this place is average. If we order from here again, I'll try another beef dish to see if I get the same results. If I do, I'll probably stick to poultry -- if we continue to order from here."}
{"text":"Very accommodating & had some dishes like back east. Haven't tried them all. Could use some tables out front especially for days like today."}
{"text":"My favorite orders here? Crab rangoons, chicken entrees, and fried chicken wings. But *especially* the crab rangoons! 

I always laugh when people compare Chinese food to what they've had \"on the east coast\", because the vast majority of Chinese options - even in Manhattan - are pretty substandard. This location far excels most corner Chinese joints in New York in both price and taste. Not too greasy, not too salty, but also not without flavor.

All entree orders come with white rice on the side. You can scoop up your choice of fortune cookies at the counter, as well as utensils, napkins, duck sauce, etc.

For a quick bite of Americanized Chinese takeout, I highly recommend it. Service is fast and friendly, food is of consistently decent quality, and prices are very affordable. It won't be the best Chinese food you've ever eaten, but it'll more than satisfy a quick craving."}
{"text":"Love the beef and broccoli! The fried dumplings and crab raggons are one of my favorites too! Even better, now they serve Thai tea!"}
{"text":"Not good. Tastes cheap and not much flavor, bad flavor at that. Got the Chow Fun Chicken and King Pao Chicken. Didn't even finish eating it as a meal."}
{"text":"Love this place. Closest Chinese food to the Chinese food back East. I drive the extra miles to come here. Only Chinese food I will eat in town"}
{"text":"Not to many good chinese places in town and this place has to be the best so far. Traditional american chinese food that everyone loves. Prices are good too. They have a great family special selection dinner"}
{"text":"The workers are rude and don't say hello or anything when you first walk in. And even worse the food isn't that great."}
{"text":"I am so excited to have this place so close to my house! Finally decided to give it a shot after driving by on my way to Target all the time. 

The thing that really pushed me into trying NYC is that you can order online. It's an introvert's dream. I was super-pleasantly surprised to see two features: one, they have dinner combinations (most places only have lunch combos) and two, they still give you your soup when you do a takeout order. YAY! The combo includes the entree, rice (pork fried, white or brown), your choice of soup, an eggroll, crab rangoon and a packet of fried wontons. For $8.25. Amazing. 

I ordered my standard Mongolian beef and found it delicious. Not a gristly piece of meat to be found, great sauce and plenty of onions. I ordered it mild, which translated to no spice at all, so I will go medium next time and see what that's like. Pork fried rice, of course. Not the best I've ever had, but pretty tasty. I chose wonton soup, which was delicious. The broth was great and there were 3 giant, freshly made wontons in it (filled with some sort of meat). I was not a fan of the eggroll. Kinda tough and had an overpowering celery-like taste to it. The rangoon was awesome (let's be honest, they're always awesome). The fried wontons were superfluous, but good. 

The portions are big. You really get a lot of food for the price. I'm a big eater and I didn't come close to finishing everything. Fortunately, that just means leftovers :)

My order was ready to go the minute I walked in the door. Everyone was very friendly. All in all, a pretty great spot!"}
{"text":"I'm very surprised that people have had negative experiences in this restaurant.  I have dined here about 5-6 times, and every time, the food is excellent and the service is fast and friendly.  I plan on having lunch here tomorrow or the day after.  I never spend more than $8 (20% tip included) and I leave stuffed to the gills every time."}
{"text":"Normally I don't care for anything called \"Other state + food type\" I want Chinese Chinese food!

We got the smaller of the family meal and between Steph and I we only ate about half of it. For 26$ delivered (not including tip) it was quite a deal since It felt like it coulda fed three to four depending. We will see if we will be back for more in two hours. :P

We got the egg drop soup with the meal and for entrees I got the Moo Goo Gai Pan and Steph got the Egg Foo Young.
The egg drop soup we both thought was a bit bland. It had a lot of egg but it was all thin wisps and really missed the seriously eggy flavor. The MGGP was good with a few flaws IMO. I am used to fairly authentic MGGP so when the sauce isn't extra thick and it's not made with MSG it's not the same. I've had worse but this is fairly bland to my tastes. Steph was tingly giddy because she said it's the first Egg Foo Young she has had in Vegas that meets up to her strict east coast Egg Foo Young standards (Disclaimer: she is from New York). She said it was all about the sauce, which she could identify by color and smell. The egg rolls and sweet sauce for them was the exact same as from the place I used to eat from in north town that made my baseline for amazing. The pork fried rice was also well done, the peas and carrots didn't seem to be rehydrated or freeze dried but full and juicy and it was all and all great without any soy.

All and all it was a mix, some things where great, some not up to my expectation. I miss my MSG kick but they advertise their lack of MSG, next time I order the MGGP I will ask if they can make it with MSG proper. However for a full review you HAVE to try the pork.. Ok lets be honest, I am going to have to try EVERYTHING, they are walking distance from my apartment, cheap, and are good for the tummy."}
{"text":"This restaurant deserves a solid 3.5 rating in my book. There is a lot to like about this place. For example, the food is fresh, the portions are substantial, and the prices are reasonable. 

There are several lunch specials to choose from that include your choice of won-ton, hot & sour, or egg drop soup. I opted for the chicken and string bean special  with hot & sour soup. Their version of hot & sour soup was outstanding! It was perfect for a cold day and was just spicy enough. Although the chicken used in my dish was not the best quality, the green beans were cooked perfectly. Once I asked for chili oil, my lunch was complete. 

My wife opted for the cashew chicken and was marginally satisfied. She wasn't exactly thrilled about the fatty chicken used in the dish. My smaller kids split the chicken and broccoli dish and seemed to enjoy it.

The service is actually pretty good for a take-out Chinese restaurant.  Our drinks were re-filled in a timely manner, and our dishes were cleared immediately. For a party of 5, our bill was about $28.00 not including tip. 

I don't know if I would choose this place over my favorite Chinese restaurants in town. However, this does make a great place to stop if you want a quick lunch that is actually pretty good."}
{"text":"I have to say .......BRIANNA ROCKS!!
We order from here all the time and when we order over the phone, we all know it's sometimes hard, with any cuisine......but if your lucky enough to get Brittany to take your order or help you in the restaurant she's always great!! Thanks girl for making dinner EASY! 
P.s. food is always amazing!
The couple at #6233!"}
{"text":"I was pleased that my delivery did not take as long as mentioned in some other reviews, but the cuisine left me desiring more. I have to give the restaurant an extra star because it seemed the woman who delivered my food was not a delivery driver, but another employee getting off of her shift.. so it showed me that they went the extra mile to get hot food delivered. We had the extra spicy Mongolian chicken lunch.. which was a more than healthy portion but lacked the flavor and extra spice requested. It wasn't spicy at all to me. I was also less than satisfied with the Wor Wonton Soup. We were looking forward to this large soup, and ended up throwing away the sweet and sour that we ordered with the lunch special. The Wor has tons of fresh vegetables and protein.. but no taste.. even after adding 2 packets of spicy mustard (I asked for extra and did not get) and 2 packets of soy sauce. I will mention that We love spicy food which is why I asked for extra spice, but regular wonton soup broth has more flavor than this soup. I regret not ordering that because it might have been prepared ahead of time and been more flavorful.  But the fresh vegetables and protein sounded and could have been a game changer. It just wasn't. It followed in the fried rice, Mongolian chicken's lead and was just bland. One of my favorite things from a Chinese restaurant is the crab rangoon. Again, a complete miss.. filled with a brown mixture rather than a crab and cheese mixture. ???? I do have to recommend the spare ribs, though. The Sauce and char was an unexpected delight. I likely will not order again."}
{"text":"Two coworkers and I ordered from here and as we were eating we found a worm in the beef and broccoli. The most nasty thing I've ever experienced."}
{"text":"Tried NY Chinese again, and very mixed results.  All in all the entire meal (ribs, noodles, Kung pao) all tasted reheated and microwaved.  Egg rolls were very good.   This was our third attempt and after hearing so many good things from friends... was  a bit disappointed."}
{"text":"I ordered at 6 05 pm online i got email with confirmation  order after 1 hour i called he said it was on the way 30 minutes later nothing i called back he asked me if i ordered online he said he's going to make it now i said forget it wont be ordering from them anymore ."}
{"text":"If I could give this craphole 0 stars I would. Placed a delivery order 2.5 hours ago... Called twice to check the status and the Asians just pick up the phone and put it down and never pick it back up again!"}
{"text":"I am from the East Coast but have lived in Las Vegas for 15 years. I NEVER would order Chinese food in Vegas because it was terrible. That is until I found this restaurant. I love it!!!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery and it was not good at all. Everything tastes stale from the veggies in the dishes to the soup. You could tell the oil was old and needed to be changed because everything that was fried tastes that way. The only plus to this place was they deliver later at night, and the driver was polite. Save yourself a tummy ache and some money and skip this place."}
{"text":"Best NY style Chinese this town has. They have Chicken Chow Mein; not Lo Mein as others have."}
{"text":"I grew up in NYC and have had the best Chinese food in NYC's Chinatown, as well as SF and LA.  This place is nothing like NY Chinese food, whose focus is on Cantonese or Hunan cuisine.

We had our food delivered.  We ordered 4 main dishes.  It was TERRIBLE.  One of our orders was a Shrimp dish, and the shrimp tasted really off.  Two other people who tasted it agreed, so we didn't eat it.  

As a result of the shrimp tasting bad, I called the restaurant and asked to speak to the manager.  He was immediately defensive, saying there was NOTHING wrong with the shrimp and that he had served hundreds of dishes that day.  He continued to argue.  I told him that I wanted to let him know just in case he had a bad batch.  He did not offer any kind of apology or anything else.  I had to insist that he refund our money for the Shrimp dish, which after 10 minutes of wrangling, he did reluctantly.  The beef dishes were bad as well with thin and stringy beef.  The Fried Rice was really greasy.

I do not understand another reviewer saying this is the best East Coast Chinese, when it is NOTHING like it.  The only thing good about this restaurant was that it was close and delivered.

I found a restaurant that is more like East Coast Chinese and it is \"Food Express Chinese Restaurant\".  The name doesn't say it, but the food DEFINITELY does.  

It is not in Summerlin, but it is not far.  I will go anywhere for quality Chinese food.  95 to Decatur to just past Oakey on the East side of Decatur."}
{"text":"We had New York Chinese for our first meal in our new place. We ordered veggie lo mein, shrimp with snow peas, and the fried rice/lo mein combo with pork. 

When the food came I found garlic shrimp instead of what I ordered. I gave them a call and they immediately got the right item back out to me, so that rates high with me. Mistakes happen and they were happy to fix it, no fuss. The shrimp and peas were good. So were both of the lo meins; they were flavorful but not drowning in sauce. The downside was the not-so-fried fried rice. DH was really disappointed with that one."}
{"text":"I knew the was not going to be good when the egg rolls were pink in the inside.  Who makes pink egg rolls.  Then, the Chicken Egg Foo Young was plain and the gravy (which looked like country gravy served with biscuits) were on a different bowl. I didn't want smothered chicken, I wanted egg foo young. The chow mien (Lo Mein) was average as well as the shrimp fried rice. It was no better than a food court Chinese food place. It was edible, but no one in our family fought over the food. We left our food and didn't even take our left overs.  $28 down the drain. My husband said, \" I was extremely disappointed.  The plates were so small, all of the food couldn't fit on the plate. The table was sticky.\" My daughter said, \"Even the Fortune Cookie was nasty.\"  I joked and said, \"My fortune cookie said \"Next time eat at Taco Bell..  I hope this food doesn't come back to haunt me in the middle of the night.  It's just a strip mall Chinese food place."}
{"text":"Always amazing. Friendly as heck too! 
A lot of food for the money! Go for dinner and have lunch the next day! Fresh, authentic & only place I will eat now"}
{"text":"I've dined here several time now and have been very impressed.  The food is prepared just the way I like it.  For take out or dine in, this is my go to place."}
{"text":"This is my second time ordering feom here they have Big portions and delivered fast. Very good Chinese food! I really like the spice level options."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery and the food was 2 hours late and everything was cold and congealed. When I called to ask what was happening with my order lady on fold told me she was too busy so she forgot. Horrible service and since I prepaid with my credit card I was ripped off. Never again will I give them any business."}
{"text":"Came in for the lunch special. Got the shrimp and lobster sauce with pork fried rice. And also some shrimp fried dumpling too. For what I paid for, must say I got my money's worth. I'll be back for sure big time. Every once in a while I myself, enjoy this style of Chinese food. Portion are on points folks."}
{"text":"This is super close to my folks Sun City home and their preferred take out Chinese; if I'm around, I'll grab it for them. They also deliver. By no means is this authentic Chinese food, but I think the New York is a reference to the type of joints we were used to on the East Coast which used to be lacking a while back in town. 

The hot and sour soup is pretty darned tasty; spicy tofu with brown rice is my choice and folks like won ton or egg drop mixed soup, house fried rice, Orange Beef and Kung Pao Shrimp. Another option they enjoy when they have guests is the Family Dinner A or B which has about 10 main dish selections and comes with apps, soup, fried rice and egg rolls: lots of food for under $25.  The occasional appetizer sampler is ordered including mainly meats, which I don't eat. They love the spare ribs, too. 

Lunch specials are reasonable as are dinner prices and service is friendly. Hey, it makes the folks happy? I'm in!"}
{"text":"Good food but very bad costumer service the lady on the phone is rude and you'll be waiting 1hr plus for your food and I don't think the delivery guy should be smoking a  cigarette when he gives me my food"}
{"text":"I had heard from a ton of people how good this place was so I was pretty excited to try it.  This place is terrible.  i don't know why so many people from New York like it.  The Chinese food in New York is excellent, and this was nothing like it."}
{"text":"a hidden gem of wonderful Chinese food...they do mostly take out but there is seating...never, ever had a bad meal there...would recommend it to anyone looking for quick and delicious Chinese food."}
{"text":"Aw yeah big portions, good food on a budget. I often pass this way but decided to give this place a try. Wen't for the appetizer portion of the BBQ pork, steam rice and a drink for under 10$. I know this place ain't fancy smance like the one where the person mixes the sauce for you but still pretty damn good. I am big fella so the appetizer portion was more than enough to fill me up. The staff was friendly and very attentive. Food was very good, prices were awesome as well. I'm sure the dinner portion could be made into two meals. Give this spot a try."}
{"text":"I don't get what people see in this place. Yes I'm from New York too (like that means one knows food better than a non New Yorker). The only thing this place reminds me of from home is the lousy places I wouldn't go too. Yes they have thick skin egg rolls and some other non authentic Chinese food. However, that's not stuff I want to eat. 

I probably spent $80 on just my wife and I so I could try a bunch of things. There pricing is reasonable, so that was enough food to feed 8-10 people. I had heard such good things I couldn't wait, and we like food. I don't mind having too much stuff to try out a new place. We barely ate any of it. Maybe a bite or two of each dish, but we were not happy with anything. Ended up making a salad at home at throwing it out. Not sarcastic comment. My dog was perfectly happy to eat what we gave him. So, that common yelp comment of my dog wouldn't even eat it is not needed (nor is that ever true). It just wasn't good."}
{"text":"I'm sure they have some things that are good but I suggest to not get the sweet and sour chicken. Not very good flavor."}
{"text":"I spent a lot of time in NY when I was younger, and this place definitely reminds me of the Chinese restaurants. Both the food and atmosphere. The egg rolls especially are how I remember them. My favorite, but consider me bias based on my background"}
{"text":"Please note that I am a multi year Yelper with many Yelps under my belt. In other words, my Yelp is legit. On that note, the worst Chinese food EVER. I don't remember throwing away an almost full plate of food before, ever.

To the Yelper who said they loved the \"fresh, handmade egg roll\", where were you having these ? Not at this restaurant. Absolutely a mass produced frozen egg roll with soy protein & not thoroughly cooked. Who can't fry an egg roll all the way done ? Gross. 

I ordered the BBQ ribs & asked if I could get veggies with it. The answer was \"No, get garlic pork if you want some veggies\" HELLO ?!?!?
I am a paying customer, not a street person looking for a hand out. You sell food. I want vegetables with my ribs, even if you charge me twice the price. I end up getting some kind of BBQ pork, tiny pieces not on a bone. Overly dried out, like very old or way over cooked. Couldn't eat 3 bites & I was starving. The meat was deep fried, although it wasn't battered. Sitting in a pool of, I presume, vegetable oil. I have never seen ribs or Chinese BBQ pork prepared like that. All I can say is, disgusting. They staff watched me throw it all away & didn't ask why. I really can't believe the 4 & 5 star reviews. But every one is entitled to their opinion. 
I would not eat here again. It was a total waste of time & money."}
{"text":"I like the location and the quality of their food. The General Tso's chicken is very, very tasty lightly breaded almost soaked in the sauce after lightly deep frying the chicken pieces. It's not too spicy. I branched out and tried the Chicken Mein fun (thin rice noodle) and was pleasantly surpised. It tastes like very good top ramen type noodles with nice pieces of meat and vegetables. I like this even better than the chicken chow mein, which I found quite fishy tasting (probably the fish stock or clam sauce used in their stir fry). The service excellent and friendly. Check it out if you're in this area!"}
{"text":"I ordered Chinese from here. 2 hours later they hadn't brought my food.
I called. And she said I hadn't ordered. 
Sorry but phones have the number in them....You push last call. I never got order. So a few days later I went and picked my food. Snow to get orders out. 
And took home. It was horrible.  
Never again."}
{"text":"Recent health inspection highlighted some serious sanitary conditions and shut them down. 

That explains why the food tasted weird, hair in it, and even some flavors that I couldn't explain.  Beware"}
{"text":"Yum! I'm from ny and this us the best I have found in Vegas. Still not exactly the same but closest to what I'm used to in NY!  Too bad it's about 40 minutes from where I live or I would frequent it more!"}
{"text":"I don't know about you guys, but I think the only place Chinese food should be based from is China. If this is \"New York\" style Chinese food, then I guess I don't like it. 

I have eaten at many Chinese and Asian restaurants in town and this location is at the bottom of my rankings. 

When this restaurant first opened, every citizen of Sun City and other Summerlin residents flocked to it. It is rare to find actual Chinese people cooking Chinese food, but this location is authentic in that sense. Customer service was great at this location, but their food was the opposite. It isn't horrible, but I do eat Chinese food so much that I have higher standards for it. 

This place is always busy, but a lot of people are there only waiting for take out. There are a decent amount of tables, but I would not bring a group here. You can also call in your order and pick it up. 

Overall, besides the food, I think this place is run well by management. You may like this place, like the other reviewers. I just personally do not."}
{"text":"Lots of choices here! This has probably got to be the best Chinese restaurant I have ever tried in my 17 years I lived here. It is located in the Sprouts parking lot next to Color Nails & Spa.
I ordered the chicken lo mein alongside with dumplings, which was huge. To be honest, it was really hard for me to decide what I wanted to order. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"First time ordering here and it was delivered way faster than expected so that's always great!!!!! :) all the portions were good sized and everything tasted amazing!!!!! For sure will order back again from them!!!! :) probably my new go to Chinese food place :)"}
{"text":"This is my go-to Chinese place near my house. My sister and I probably get takeout here once every week or two whenever we're in the mood for Chinese. They opened about 2 years ago, I believe. We've been going here ever since. The food we get is always consistently delicious and we've never had a problem with our orders. We usually order online which makes everything much easier for us & them.

Only gripe I have is that they don't serve salt & pepper squid! My favorite Chinese places in the NYC/NJ area have salt & pepper squid on their menus and I miss it so much. Still trying to find a place here that serves this dish."}
{"text":"If you were in a small town and this was the only place to eat, then maybe. Vegas has 25 other Chinese restaurants within a stones throw from here. Go elsewhere."}
{"text":"I'm very nervous about where I buy Chinese food!  I have to say, I was very surprised of the flavor and taste was in my food!  I always get Mongolian beef NO vegetables and it still tasted amazing!  

If you have any doubts like me, try this place first!

I'll be returning again!"}
{"text":"I have been going to NY Chinese Restaurant for awhile always hoping they would have better service. The food is consistently good and so is the wait.  Do not go to this place if you want to be satisfied immediately.  Plan to have good food in about 2 hours."}
{"text":"This is easily my favorite Chinese place in town not on Spring Mountain Rd. The food is incredible, always fresh and the staff are very kind. Their delivery is quick as well, with their time estimates always being accurate. The dinner combo is a deal that can't be beat and usually is enough for two meals."}
{"text":"The best little Chinese food restaurant in town. I've eaten here many times and the food is always outstanding. I especially recommend the fried rice or the sweet and sour chicken, kung pao chicken. The service is the best and they also do a lot of takeout orders. I can't recommend this place enough so do yourself a favor and give them a try."}
{"text":"Pretty yummy. I was skeptical for a while on take out Chinese. I had a bad experience once and haven't been too keen on eating Chinese out. This place did not disappoint. The delivery was fast, the food was good and the left overs where better. IF you are looking for a late night snack, post hangover meal or just good grub, check this place out."}
{"text":"East Coast Chinese to a tee. Delicious, fast, hot and in large quantities. My family has been ordering take out from here for years. It stands alone as it's own class of food.  House Lo Mein is worth a try and they will generally make anything you ask."}
{"text":"After placing my order online, I needed to change my payment type after choosing the wrong one. It took 3 times before I could even get through. When someone finally answered, there was no greeting. They finally told me to hold on. After waiting for 10 minutes, I hung up and tried back. Same thing. They picked up but said nothing. I was finally loud enough and they rudely told me to hold on. After another 25 minutes, I called from another phone and got through. When I told them how long I had been on hold, she was dismissive. I brought it up again and same result.   I was told an additional 15 minutes which would have made it 45 minutes. It took an hour and a half. If this is how they treat customers, I can find another Chinese restaurant to order from."}
{"text":"This is a great place for lunch (...and dinner too).  The lunch menu items are very reasonably priced and come with choice of rice, soup and 1 crab Rangoon.  With a soda I was under $9!  Can't beat it for he price, and the quality of top notch too!"}
{"text":"This place was good and I will be back! Yummy egg drop soup - just hot enough but not too hot and definitely tasted homemade."}
{"text":"I had the chicken & cashews and the shrimp and fried rice. I ordered the family dinner for 4. It is a good value. I'm glad they had Won Ton Soup, but the meat in the wan tons tasted very funny....a lot different from other restaurants, and it looked weird too. Overall, good and quick Chinese food, but nothing I would rave about."}
{"text":"Well, new to Las Vegas and am slowing finding my groove. Having a great Chinese takeout is paramount and I got lucky here. Found through Yelp, and ordered some of my favs, dumplings, Kung Pow Chicken.... has to try the New York style Shrimp Chow Mein since it's been years since I had it done right. Well, kudos across the board! Gotta try some other items on the menu, but this is a great place when you want good Chinese! Yum"}
{"text":"I'm a native New Yorker this is one of the best Chinese restaurant in Las Vegas. I had the generals chickens it was great enough food for 2 and half people. The only thing you need to make sure everything is in the bag... They forgot the drink 
But yes I would order from them again."}
{"text":"This place is great always on time, prices are good and the food is fantastic. Been here plenty of times and always give great deals for bigger purchases."}
{"text":"Not coming back. Under staffed and not very efficient at running the restaurant. Made me wait too long standing up. My back hurts too much."}
{"text":"I ordered the shrimp lobster sauce (pork fried rice) and kung pao chicken (brown rice) dinner combination, both with wonton soup. I also added another order of egg rolls as they seemed to be popular based on previous reviews. I got to say, the title caught my eye because most places with \"New York\" in front of it ends up being a deli, pizza, or hot dog place.

The prices are fair (dinner combinations ranging from $8.25 to $8.95). The one comparison that does not seem logical are the family specials that include the same exact thing as ordering two dinner combinations. Kudos for being the first Chinese restaurant that gives the option for brown rice.

The set-up for the dining area is extremely small with a large kitchen in the back. Spacious, but only 6 tables that seats 4, and 2 tables that seat 2. It was quite busy being 7:00 p.m. since I imagine most Chinese places are known for being take out.

The food was great. The Kung Pao was loaded with vegetables, but that is the usual nowadays. Eat the peppers to get the spice in. The shrimp was salty, but that is also expected from Shrimp w/ Lobster sauce. However, the fried rice, wonton soup, and crab rangoons are EXCELLENT!"}
{"text":"It's close to are home. We get are food fast and hot
Are orders are correct

We have ordered from them 5 or 6 times
The food is good"}
{"text":"I am trying to understand the reviews on this place. We heard it was great and had soured on or fav place, so decided to try it, delivery was a joke, 2....TWO hours.  So I take one bite of wonton in won ton soup and spit it out, sorry, there was such a weird per fumy spice in there that was NOT agreeable. so passed and went to fried won ton, well, after two hours they were cold and so hard I think I moved a tooth trying to bite into it, when I did bite into it
had the same perfumy taste, ...spit it out. Moving on, to the sweet and sour pork, cold but tasty (hence the 1 star) and then we went to beef and string bean, again that same magical spice that gags you.  If hat is what New York Chines taste like I will never order Chinese in NY.   We got on the net to try to figure out what it was, kept thinking it was us, doesn't matter if it was us it was inedible.

When I called to find our order after 1.5 hours she said driver left, what the heck does that mean he could have left at noon could you call? No he come was all she said.  Late , cold, hard and weird....we will go back to our fav thanks.
If anyone has a ans for what the heck they put in the food (other than enough MSG so send my heart reeling for 2 hours) I would appreciate it."}
{"text":"They deliver quickly a have good food.
We like the General Tsao chicken and the pork low main."}
{"text":"I won't be ordering from here again unfortunately. The food has never made me sick so that's why I'm giving 2 stars instead of 1. It always takes at least 70 minutes to get it. Sometimes 80-90. The food arrives sloppy, spilled, some cold, some warm. They don't listen to whether you want mild medium or hot. The food is always super oily... I'm not usually one to notice things like that but they use a lot more than necessary."}
{"text":"Found this little gem thru direct marketing via USPS.  Food has always been hot and delicious. Ample servings. This restaurant delivers ! Awesome. Prices are extremely reasonable. First decent Chinese restaurant I have found in Vegas/Henderson area, and I have lived in the Valley for 20 Yrs. Highly recommend this restaurant. Delivery person is always happy, smiling and very personable. Thank you for your great service, which is getting increasingly difficult to find."}
{"text":"Good food must try chicken and broccoli... Also dumplings are on point and fast delivery"}
{"text":"This place  is just like food back home 
All the flavor and style new york chinese food  has
So glad they're  here cause California style  chinese food  is not 
The same  at all
Never disappointed  here
Everything consistently  good"}
{"text":"Great food.  Good prices.  The staff is extremely friendly and courteous.  Orange chicken, Broccoli Beef, tofu sweet and sour are all great!"}
{"text":"The soup is good. I wish they had spring rolls but other than that everything is tasty. Get the kung pao shrimp"}
{"text":"Best chinese food in Las Vegas. I'm from nyc Bronx to be exact. Been in Las Vegas since 2013 tired of places and they were horrible. I finally ran into this place and been coming since 2013."}
{"text":"Please take the \"New York\" out of your name! I was born and raised in NYC and this is definitely NOT like anything I've had on the east coast. 

For starters, my order took an hour and 50 minutes to come. We only ordered a few items and we live a mere 3 miles away. It's unacceptable. They said the order would arrive in approximately 45 minutes. I had to call two more times, both calls I was told \"he was on the way\".

I was waiting outside and saw the delivery man wondering around the block, clearly he was lost. So, I walked toward the curb and hailed him over. He said he didn't have a cell phone and he couldn't find my address. Ugh. 

Everyone was starving by the time the food arrived.. We all agreed that we would've been better off eating 25 cent ramen like broke college kids! 

The dumplings were filled with a bland, gummy grayish meat. The hot & sour soup was OK, not great or even good. We also ordered orange chicken, combination lo mein and Mongolian beef. Everything was overcooked, and either overly salty or too bland.

My son and I just took benedryl because we are both allergic to MSG (actually everyone should avoid it since it's a excoto/nuerotoxin)   

Never again, hope they go out of business. They should be ashamed to claim any New York ties."}
{"text":"Have been getting the Mu Shu chicken here for several years; it is always delicious and there is always plenty of it.   This is my favorite take out place in Summerlin."}
{"text":"If you're in the mood for Chinese food accompanied with speedy service,  this is the place.  Fried rice, soups, and a variety of playes I've had here have all been good.  Not mind-blowing, but everything is as you'd expect from your favorite Chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"Great egg drop soup, wonton soup and chicken with vegetables!! The general chicken is super spicy though!"}
{"text":"The lunch specials are totally worth it!  Soup, a large portion of entre and rice and a crab rangoon plus delivery and tip for around 10 bucks.  For me, one lunch special will feed me for two or three lunches at work, so well worth it.  

I usually get Moo Goo Gai Pan with the Wonton Soup.  I have had better elsewhere, but not for the price here."}
{"text":"First time eating here. I ordered the Mongolian beef plate with pork fried rice. The Mongolian beef was mostly onions, with a few small pieces of beef. Flavor was okay. Pork fried rice was good. Hot and sour soup was just alright. Egg roll wasn't bad. My fiancé ordered the beef and broccoli. The beef had no taste at all. Broccoli wasn't too bad. Price came out to $19.xx. Wanted Chinese food and we are only 5 mins away so thought we would try it out. Don't know if I would recommend this place unless you have no other options."}
{"text":"Place an order online and estimate time for P/U was 20 minutes \" when to p/u and they said just a couple of more minutes waiting for the egg rolls I have also order \" at the end my names was called! When i got home no egg rolls to be found ! Sad"}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place no stars if that we're an option. I called in to make an order and asked of I could do 2 separate transactions. She said \"why you make this so difficult?\". I decided not to eat from there. Can't give a review on their food. It can't be good quality with such bad service."}
{"text":"I have given this place several tries. Every time has been a dissapointment. I wish there was a great chinese place in Henderson.  Please someone open one soon !"}
{"text":"I love this place.  We try to have it every Friday to celebrate the weekend.  Delivery of course.   Sometimes it does take a while but is well worth it.  The food is hot and delicious.  My husband gets the combo Mongolian beef and really enjoys it.  I get the Large  Shrimp and Lobster sauce and it's incredible.  So Yummy.  I vote try it.  Very nice people."}
{"text":"Will never go back. Gave them a second chance even after knowing their other location was previously demerited  by the health dept. This time service was horrible and they would not honor their own coupon. The owner was our server. On previous visits they always honored the coupons. This time they didn't.  They said next time. So I wrote next time on tip. Food was horrible. Service was horrible.  Shrimp egg foo Yong had four cocktail shrimp in each piece. Dishes were even smaller. Done with this place. Multiple chances and this time just took the cake. Moving on."}
{"text":"First time came to this restaurant. Restaurant was small but it's just a chinese take out. The food was ok. I would recommend taking these food to go because the dinning room was small. If you live around here, I would recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place 2 stars because they got the order right and the food was ready when we got there to pick it up. I ordered the spare ribs dinner, eggrolls, and chicken chow mein. The ribs were tough and the sauce was at best uneventful. The pork fried rice was flavorless, and they did not give us any soy sauce to season it. The eggrolls were hard to chew, and the filling lacked any flavor. My dog, admittedly a picky eater, other than the mostly uneaten ribs, didn't want the leftovers. I couldn't in  good conscience recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"This is the Best Chinese food in town. They have amazing food. The egg rolls are to die for. The deliver.  What more can you ask for. I have Tried. Several items on there menu. My favorite is the Mongolian beef, egg rolls, general chx. Crab ragoon, omg .. I could list forever. Please if you want amazing Chinese food. Look up Nee York Chinese.  They have got me for life. An I have been in vegas for over 20 yrs."}
{"text":"Have ordered from here many times...tonight they called to confirm we ordered something different on purpose and not by mistake...AWESOME CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!"}
{"text":"Don't do delivery. I live 1 mile from this place and took them 1 hr 30 mins. U might as well just do a pick up."}
{"text":"We were nearby and decided to stop and try this place. See they have mixed reviews on food quality. We ordered Kung pow chicken, happy family and shrimp fried rice. The KPC came with won ton soup and egg roll. Soup broth was ok but the won tons seemed like they had been sitting for sometime. The egg roll was more like a spring roll and not cooked completely and the main KPC had no flavor and tasted the same as the happy family order but had a little spice to it. The happy family order was just ok. No flavor and broccoli was over cooked, soggy. Did have lots of of meats in it but all tasted the same. As for the shrimp fried rice it was dry and appeared not very fresh. We were not impressed with the food and will stick to the other Chinese places nearby such as Cook on Wok, Dragon Wok and our favorite place which is a little drive but well worth it is Great Wall on Charleston and Rancho. If you like this place you must have no tastebuds."}
{"text":"Ordered the Family Dinners A & B today for my family lunch. We were pleasantly surprised, it was all very fresh and nice size portions. Favorites of the feast were the pork egg foo yung and the hot n sour soup. We ordered online, they delivered when requested, and we paid at our door with card. This will be our new Chinese takeout joint!"}
{"text":"I ordered the lunch specials the general Tso chicken and beef with broccoli. The chicken was tasty and the crab Rangoon was yummy but the beef and broccoli were a little disappointing the broccoli had a weird aftertaste and I couldn't keep eating it same thing with the meat. Idk what sauce it was cooked in but I should have just ordered the chicken. Delivery was fast and everything went well. Cheap though, you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"Ordered two sesame chicken lunch specials to go. Waited about 37 mins while my buddy and three others who ordered before me had already had their meals ready. Next time ill just call it in which I advise everyone else to do. The pork fried rice is the best in town."}
{"text":"This is the best Chinese food I've had since I left Chicago in 1976, and moved to Los Angeles.  I now live in Henderson and the food is so delicious -and they deliver too, try it you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"First went in this location the other day. Anyone from N.Y. would know there are very few to none great  Chinese restaurants in Las Vegas/ Henderson. There was one place Yum Yum House on Tropicana, however they closed. This restaurant is great. As Lee M. mentioned in their review ..  \"Chow Mein with crunchy veggies like celery and sprouts and meat, no noodles\".. Every chinese place I have gone to has never made Chow Mein like that, except for Yum Yum House. Maybe Chinese places in the area have gone down hill. China A Go Go has flavorless fried/ yellow rice, while New York Chinese Restaurant has Fried Rice exactly as I remember it from NY. 

We have since visited again and the owner ever remembered us and smiled as we walked in. The other employees are very polite as well.

If your looking for amazing chinese food of NY quality visit this restaurant!"}
{"text":"This is the second time I tried this place. I will not return at this establishment. Although, the people there are friendly, but the food is not good. The food all taste the same. Orange chicken is the same as General Tsao Chicken. Pepper Steak has the same flavor as their chow fun. Will not go back again."}
{"text":"The quality of the food here is amazing, we have been gong here for a year.   I like their dinner combination sweet and sour chicken (sauce on the side).    When I get home it's amazing.   I used to get it the chicken with the sauce mixed and now I love the chicken still crispy.    I'm happy we moved right around the corner from this gem.   We even get coupons sometimes in the mail.  

~*Their lunch specials start at $7.53 (tax included).*~    You get a choice of soup, rice, entree and a crab rangoon. BIG portions you can save some for later.  I always thank them for the great food."}
{"text":"After hearing great things about this place, I'm so upset to be only giving one star. 

We called in our order and gave it about thirty minutes before we went to pick it up, which we were assured on the phone was plenty of time. Unfortunately, this place is so poorly staffed that we then waited an additional ALMOST FOURTY minutes once we actually arrived. For freaking SOUP. Safe your time and go somewhere else"}
{"text":"Mostly Chinese staff. 50/50 split mix or Asian customers. Staff spoke good English. Food is pretty good for price point. Menu is like a more Chinese version of panda."}
{"text":"Delicious! The food is always hot and fresh. Its near my house and they deliver! They are reasonably priced too. If you are paying with a card, they bring the m machine with them.  I usually let them know \" this will be on the card\" . I am hungry thinking about it.  I love  their fries, yes i said fries! It's so convinent and they  have amazingly nice service!  It's small inside, so thank goodness they have delivery as well."}
{"text":"My hubby and I love this place. We pick up food here often. It's is fresh and not greasy. The veggies are al dente. They offer brown rice. It's easy to eat healthy here. I'm a gluten free vegetarian and I always get the mixed veggies with white sauce. They're very friendly and helpful here. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great service and great food at a great price if you are looking for a east coast Chinese restaurant here it is"}
{"text":"The people that work there are very unfriendly but the food is great just had the dragon and Phoenix tonight really good"}
{"text":"People that say this place is bland have obviously burned their taste buds by eating too much cheap overly spiced food. Food should have flavor and not just be garlic and spices! I actually taste green beans and chicken! I'm not just eating garlic Sauce with something thrown into it! It's nice to be able to actually taste my chicken and veggies!

I had actually tried this place years ago and didn't like it, but a neighbor of mine kept suggesting I try it again since they changed ownership. 
Well let me tell you it's great! And I feel like the food is less Greasy, and I don't feel sick after I eat it like some other greasy Chinese places. I will definitely be ordering from them again. 

Bonus: my lunch got to me within 20 minutes of ordering it!"}
{"text":"Possibly the worst Chinese food I've ever eaten. We ordered egg foo young, the brown sauce was awful, gummy and tasteless.  Our other dish was the lemon chicken. The chicken was tough, the breading was gummy under the crisp outside and their lemon sauce had the consistency of jelly. The only thing edible was the white rice. This was a huge disappointment and we won't be ordering from them again."}
{"text":"After 3 years I returned to try again and was pleasantly surprised how good the food was. Spare ribs were excellent, fried chicken wings were good,  pork fried rice was good and wonton soup was good. And by the way the wontons they use in the soup DO NOT fall apart and dissipate from the hot broth unlike every other Chinese restaurant in the Vegas/Henderson area that I've tried.  I stopped in at lunch time and the place was super busy so call in your order ahead of time if you are in a rush. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Real NY Chinese food is hard to find. That being said this restaurant is pretty similar to what I use to order in NY. I always order the lunch special boneless spare ribs with pork fried rice. The hot sauce is really good too...Can't complain it definitely hits the spot when craving NY Chinese."}
{"text":"Great to-go place. Dishes are not your typical run-of-the-mill Chinese restaurant entries. 

Their dishes have flavor, cooked fresh when you order. Vegetables are not overcooked, seafood is fresh and the meat, be it pork, chicken or beef, are tender which is what you would expect from a Chinese restaurant. Each and every dish I have ordered never disappoints. 

They say that the Best Chinese Food in the World can be found in New York and am glad this restaurant is here so I don't have to travel all the way there to experience that distinct flavor."}
{"text":"I've only get delivery here, so my review is only based on that. 
I find it hard to review Chinese here; most of it just isn't very good. Compared to Chinese restaurants in my hometown, it's not that great. Just ok. However, compared to a lot of the Chinese food I've had since moving to Vegas, it's pretty damn good. 
Now I don't know if this is really New York style or not, because it just seems like every other Americanized Chinese place in the country. 
Things I like here, Mongolian Beef and Hunan Chicken. The General Tso's is ok too. 
Now, the two things that set this place away from the pack, is the fact that they have quick delivery and ridiculously cheap prices. Decent chinese food at panda express prices. 
They have cheap lunch deals, but I think the best deal has to be the combo dinners. Entree, rice, soup, one crab rangoon, eggroll, and of course, the fortune cookie. This will cost you less than $8. It's easily enough food for two meals.
Delivery is always fast and friendly. 
*Note* As other reviewers have said, the beef tends to be a little chewy."}
{"text":"Been looking for New York style Chinese food for years in Vegas. We visit every year. This is it! Everything we ordered was delicious. Hole in the wall eateries like these are usually delicious in New York. We ordered takeout & ate it for lunch & dinner. Have some left for breakfast. Very reasonable too. Owner (former New Yorker) of a large supermarket in Vegas hipped us to this eatery. Thanks."}
{"text":"They earned the extra half star...the offer duck sauce in packets! and you can order the fried rice without the carrots and peas.  They did a large \"to go\" order for me that I carried 300+ miles home and it held up amazingly!  Yum!"}
{"text":"Hot and sour soup excellent. Shrimp with lobster sauce really good and Mongolian beef also really good. Service was quick and pleasant. With the combination dinner you get soup, large egg roll and a crab Rangoon. Couldn't finish everything. Good for tomorrow."}
{"text":"Food was really tasty  , service was great , prices very good .. delivered on or before expected ... very nice experience, would order from there in a minute"}
{"text":"Kristi M. has it right in describing the mom and pop Chinese(American) East Coast restaurants. You really have trouble finding that type of food at reasonable prices(without being served rubber food). 

The lunch specials are great but the combination plates are an even better deal if you don't want Chinese lunch. For around $8 you get a soup, crab rangoon, egg roll, and a choice of rice along with your meal. The portion size isn't huge but if you can eat all that food and still be hungry maybe you should eat a little less.

Bravo NY Chinese! I'll be spending a lot of my days eating your delicious East Coast inspired Chinese food. Yummmmm"}
{"text":"This place was a real positive surprise! If you are ever in the area, the food is great! What it lacks in ambiance, it makes up for in quality at a great price!"}
{"text":"I order from here often, although this company does have on-line ordering I personally use \"eat24.com\" for my orders.

I rated it at 3 stars as it always a 50/50 chance when it comes to taste.  I have had great flavor able dishes and then others:  not so much.  I would avoid the chop-suey  and order the Mongolian beef.

Spicy means just that here! Use caution. 

Delivery is fast and my food is always hot."}
{"text":"My first time here and I ordered Wor wonton soup to-go. I know, pre-made, it's an easy order, but that's my way of \"testing\" to see if a Chinese restaurant is decent. The soup was pretty good! What shocked me was the multiple pieces of JUMBO shrimp in there! They did not hold back with that shrimp. I have never had wor wonton with so much chicken and veggies & of course that shrimp! The restaurant is small, maybe only like 5 small families could fit. As I passed by the tables of families, their dishes of chow mein & orange chicken looked/smelled good. There is a ton of staff, so someone is always ready to help ! I would definitely go back to explore their menu."}
{"text":"I've had their take out 3 times now. It's pretty good. It's not the best I've ever had, but it's really good. My go to's: 
crab rangoon, always delicious.
sliced pork, really good
egg rolls, crunchy and tasty
The sweet and sour pork and pepper steak are pretty decent too.
The fried rice and lo mein are just ok. I wouldn't rave about them. 
The food is made pretty quick, but I recommend calling ahead.
Keep an eye out because they have a coupon in the local newspaper for free items."}
{"text":"I have a love/hate relationship with this place. If I place the order for pick up or delivery sometimes the wait is much much longer then they say it will be.  I have been left waiting inside for up to 40 minutes and waited almost 2 and a half hours this last time we ordered for delivery. We actually cancelled that order and got a refund.  This would be the hate part of the relationship..

Now the love part.. The food is pretty good. There are certain items I have ordered that I wouldn't and others I order each time. Like the \"Fried Veggie Dumplings\". You get 8 in an order and they are addictive. The Egg Rolls are bigger then I'm used to. I can get a 2 piece order of those and eat some dumplings and rice and be stuffed. 

I have always ordered online. I have only called when checking the status of my order.  The online ordering is very convenient and they have a area where you can out extra instructions. 

The \"Orange Chicken\" only comes in large size on the menu, but if you order it from the kids menu you can get the small portion. If you still want the larger portion then you might want to order the combination dinner meal with the Orange Chicken because then you will get a choice of Soup, Rice, an Egg Roll and a Crab Rangoon for $8.95 and the Orange Chicken alone is $8.55. Might as well get more for your meal for just 40 cents more."}
{"text":"My fiance and I order delivery from here frequently. I love their egg drop soup and the food has always been good. However the last couple times we've ordered, the food came wrapped in bags and all the sauce had leaked all over inside the bag. The associate my fiance saw today tried to charge him for the food when we had already paid online and was very rude and condescending.

Bottom line: good food but could improve their customer service and packaging techniques."}
{"text":"This is my go to for chinese food. The service is outstanding and you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"We just ordered takeout from this place for the first time last night. I was a little worried, after reading some of the reviews, but my worries turned out to be baseless.
We ordered a family meal, so sampled many different items. Everything was delicious. Wonton soup had tons of big, fat wontons, Orange chicken was served on a lovely bed of steamed broccoli, the Crab Rangoon was delicate and tasty. 

The only two issues that I had were the eggrolls and fried shrimp. The fried shrimp was a little overcooked, and the eggrolls were very dense and pretty tasteless.

Overall, we got a ton of really tasty food for a decent price, and I will order from them again."}
{"text":"Our go-to restaurant for Chinese food. Have never been disappointed with the food. Great lunch specials. The staff are hard-working and friendly. Waitress asked my Wife about me last time she went in without me. We didn't even realize they remembered us."}
{"text":"Food was fresh it taste really good. But I wouldn't say new york style exactly but the taste is similar. The pepper salt shrimp is amazing!"}
{"text":"I like the food here. So does half of henderson. The food is really good to take home. There are not alot of tables to hold all the people. Best bet is to call it in and take it home and enjoy"}
{"text":"Yummy fresh choice.   We like it here and it's close to home!  Orange chicken and broccoli beef are favorites in my house!  

Recommend !!"}
{"text":"I've been going to this place for at least 6 years . I have recommended it to countless people in that time. Sadly about a year ago they started on a rapid decent to become one of the worst run operations in town . I don't know if its new ownership or employee's but the overall food quality and flavors have gotten terrible. Delivery service used to be reasonable even on very busy Friday or Saturday night. Not anymore. We usually order with EAT24 online and have never had a problem . We figured we would give them one last shot to redeem themselves and they failed miserably tonight. We placed our order and waited 2 hours (stated wait time 60-75 mins)  . We called to ask and were confronted by two employees that spoke no English . Not broken English  as might be expected but literally no English . We called Eat24 to cancel our order . Sadly we will have to find another East Coast style Chinese place in our area.  If it is the same owners who originally opened the restaurant and they are reading this . Please fix whatever it is that is broken . You were the best and now are a sad excuse who will be out of business soon running like this ."}
{"text":"Food is good and delivery is reliable. It's a good go to in a pinch. If they offer you a choice between small and large, go large if you aren't just feeding 1 person"}
{"text":"This ranks in my top 3 for Chinese food in Vegas and is a different but great twist on Chinese food! But first let's start with the space in the restaurant or should I say, what space...... for a place that's so popular man they really need a larger building because there is only 4 tables to eat at inside and it's extremely tight and anyone waiting in line might as well dine with you because the line is also where the tables are at lol.

Now onto the greatness- they have some of the crispiest , thick, juicy wings I ever tasted and they come in a plain or slightly lemon pepper which is delicious. It's weird to say a Chinese place has great wings but man they are on point. Next is the egg foo young with shrimp which has a great texture and comes with a gravy that has a medium consistency so not to watery not to thick and pairs perfect with the dish. We also can't forget there special fried rice with all the meats and is a great add on to any dish.

The Nice part about this restaurant is the prices are reasonable, the portion sizes are large, and they have a great family deal for $26 that can feed 4 people and have some left overs. I also want to mention the menu is VERY extensive so there are options for the whole family"}
{"text":"Always looking for good neighborhood chow.  Got lunch takeout yesterday...  egg drop soup (an atomic yellow color, but very tasty), ma po tofu with pork.  Portions were large, and food was the best Chinese I've had so far in the neighborhood.  There are a few tables for in-house service."}
{"text":"Where to begin...
So, I don't usually eat Chinese food because I'm particularly picky with the amount of oils and sodium. I decided to try this place out since it is near my beau's house and he claims the food is delicious... Let's just say I need to take him down to Chinatown and really have him question his palate for real Chinese food! We ordered the following:

- orange chicken/ steam rice
- Mongolian beef/ pork fried rice
- egg drop soup
- won ton soup
- egg rolls


Best thing about the orange chicken was that they used actual orange peel in the marinade, other than that, it was chewy and needed seasoning possibly a bit of sweetness and crunch.
Mongolian beef was also lacking flavor and too chewy, as if it was the same protein from 3 days prior. Not at all spicy as it claimed to be and was covered in onions.
Pork fried rice was decent. I'd order this again.
Egg drop soup was also tasty and glad it wasn't salty.
Won ton soup broth was delicious, but a bit salty and the won tons were definitely pre frozen and the pork inside the won ton was rubbery and tasted like jerky. Who knows how long they've been stored.
Egg rolls were yummy, although the ingredients inside were questionable, but good.

All in all some of the items were just ok. I don't think it's enough to make me eat here again though. Definitely was not impressed and will make a detour to Panda Express or even Chinatown instead. Next..."}
{"text":"Awsome!! Awsome! I order from them weekly,  they are always QUICK and the delivery is super fast! The food is great and very reasonably priced. I would recommend anybody to this restaurant.  It really has a small store front so many people pick up or have delivery . Try the eggplant and the war wonton soup is superb!  Lots of shrimp,chicken meat and veggies. It's a winner."}
{"text":"The food is priced good if you are budget conscious but we have tried it on three different occasions and each time the food has not tasted very good and almost bland. It seems as if its almost fast food or buffet style. Not authentic at all. I would recommend someplace else if possible."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE SERVICE, WALKED OUT!
Sat and waited 10 minutes to be acknowledged while a couple of Regulars came in, were seated, orders taken and drinks served. Will not waste our time here again!"}
{"text":"Tried this restaurant for the first time today.  Did an online order and picked it up.  Ordering and pick up went smoothly.

There was a lot of food, the ingredients appeared to be there and it was hot.  I don't like mushrooms so I was not happy to find them in my cashew chicken.

There simply was nothing that tasted good.  It's not like we have a lot of great Chinese food restaurants here in Henderson, but after 30 years of having good Chinese in other cities I think I know  bland and bad.

Orange chicken was gross, chicken egg rolls were hard and dry.  Chicken fried rice was bland and didn't taste good.  An overall D grade would be about right."}
{"text":"Until a friend from  the east coast told us about this place, I have refused to get Chinese take out since moving to Vegas. The few places I tried, were not to my liking so I lost interest. I grew up eating Chinese food in Chinatown NYC and At some of the best takeouts in New Jersey, so I'm tough to please. I picked up our food here the first time after calling in the order we and everything was fresh and hot.  We've also had it delivered once as well. The ribs are great. They have a lot of meat on them. We've tried beef with broccoli, moo goo Gai, chow fun, chow menu, pork fried rice, orange chicken and more. They were all really good. We got a ton of food for a reasonable price and have made
This our go to take-out  place."}
{"text":"Closest thing in Vegas to good old fashioned East Coast Chinese food. This is not a gourmet restaurant and it doesn't try to be. It's good, solid take out!"}
{"text":"I had dinner here a few days ago, it was my first visit. The food was delicious! Large portions, fair price. The owner and her staff were very friendly & service oriented. Clean dinning room, clean restroom. Great selection of items on the menu!

I was in town visiting family,and decided to eat here at my sons suggestion. He was right, the food was great! 

I would definitely recommend this place if your looking for good Chinese food,and plenty of it! I will be back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Spend the fifteen minute drive out to Green Valley Parkway for some excellent Chinese off the strip. Very reasonable (under $10 for a dinner combo).

Free drinks with Yelp check ins. (Don't mark as \"used\" until you share with your server...)

We ate in, nothing fancy, but the service was extra-ordinary. They delivered crispy noodles as appetizer along with our soup, Rangoon and egg roll. 

The Sichuan Chicken And General Tso's chicken were yummy and mildly spicy. Perfect for me. 

From the looks of the makes and models of the clients cars and SUB's pulling up to the front door, I'd say they have a high profile clientele!!

If you are from outta town and are looking for a great off the strip Chinese place, New York Chinese is the place!!!"}
{"text":"Their food is really good. Whenever I go, I order the dinner combo special of the chicken lo mein. Good stuff. The reason I'm giving it 3 stars is due to the fact I found a very long strand of hair along with my chicken and noodles. Super gross."}
{"text":"Excellent  food, Maggie takes care of her regulars. Lots of protein in the dishes and always fresh and hot."}
{"text":"Orange chicken was good. Wasn't super thrilled. Took a long time. Egg rolls and won tons tasted old and reheated."}
{"text":"The food is great, this is my third time ordering from them. Sometimes I don't have time to cook or go get food, and am not always looking to get a pizza. Their food quality is exceptional, always tastes fresh and it is delicious. They are really very fast as well, even though I'm sure me being close has something to do with it. I ordered my food through the Yelp app, and it was at my door in literally less than 20 minutes. Will order from them again I'm sure."}
{"text":"Went here a while ago and as I do when I go into any restaurant I looked to see there health grading.  I could not find it anywhere and asked where it was.  They giggled as they removed a picture hiding the plaque with a C rating.  I told them that it was against the law to hide that and they appologized.  I canceled my order and walked out.  I proceeded to Walgreens next door and on my way back to the car I popped back in and noticed the sign was again removed.  I called the health department on them and went somewhere else.  Shame on you for playing with people's lives!!  I wish Yelp would have an option for zero stars."}
{"text":"I always get their shrimp egg foo young and shrimp fried rice which is delicious. They put lots of shrimp in both and the shrimp are an adequate size. The rest of the food that I have tasted there is questionable. It wasn't very good. I will continue to order the shrimp egg foo young and shrimp fried rice. The reason for the 3 stars is because of the other food I've had there not being good."}
{"text":"Regulars here. Pickup and take out. Our waitress knows our menu choices and is pretty good since our first encounter. 

A good regular stop. Nothing fancy but good nonetheless"}
{"text":"This is my go-to place for chinese takeout.  Wonton soup is a must, and the kung pao chicken and mongolian beef are great as well!"}
{"text":"Okay I do truly love this place and all the food is authentic and great. BUT I find it absolutely disgusting when the walls throughout the inside look like the attached photo I just took. Paint or clean your walls within 1 week or I am turning this over to the health department! Take care of this issue ASAP and I will update my review."}
{"text":"I love the Wor Wonton soup. I always get it when I feel a cold coming on and it really helps me feel better."}
{"text":"We have tried this place a few times and really like it. The fried rice is good but nothing spectacular. However, the sesame chicken is DELICIOUS!!! I will get this every single time I come back."}
{"text":"I have been a customer for several years, but tonight was the last straw. The last time I visited, I left frustrated, and vowed not to return.  They let me stand there for 15-20 minutes, and never asked me what I would like to order, so I left. I am a regular, and always tip the help. Anyway, tonight I thought I would give them another chance. Boy am I sorry. I placed the order, (it is always the same) at 5:30 pm. At 6:05, I was still waiting. Meanwhile, people were being seated in the restaurant, and they received their food while I continued to wait.  When they did realize they had an extra bag of food, the food had been sitting on the counter for 15 minutes. It was barely warm. They tried to tell me the food just came up.  They vowed to take care of me on my next trip!  Are they kidding?  I got my money back, and needless to say there will not be a next time.  We did enjoy their food, but the service is horrible."}
{"text":"You want New York Chinese food this is definitely it.  Great food and great customer service. Recommend this place to everyone."}
{"text":"Good lunch menu. Tasty. Been here 4 times. Always fast and good. Cheap too. I like the Mongolian beef. Also like broccoli with beef. The broccoli is fresh.  Lunch meals include a choice of soup and rice.  The egg drop soup is good. Lots of parking in front in strip mall, near Walgreens."}
{"text":"Have eaten here a few times before, and was never dis-satisfied. Went back last night for the first time in a long time. Had my boys with me, and we ordered a bunch of stuff for take-out. I didn't want the boys running around their shop destroying it, so I took them out to the car to wait. I was just about to go back in and see if it was ready when at the same time, the guy was bringing it out to my car. We exchanged our thanks, and we were on our way. Smelling the food on the way home made me and my oldest son even hungrier! When we got home, the bag was ripped into, and started divvying up the dishes. Beef n broccoli, orange chicken, lo mein, soup, ribs, and FINALLY, REAL egg rolls!! Not spring rolls being passed along as egg rolls, but real, thick, bubbly skinned egg rolls. 
I work EVERY night, so being able to just have some simple take-out, and watch Spongebob with my boys was  a great feeling. I only see my kids when I drop them off at school in the morning, and after I get home(usually around 11pm) as they are going to bed. This food was part of a good memory that I will be able to have. I got such a buzz from the food, I had to wait until today to write the review."}
{"text":"Being in Las Vegas I've learned that the standards have to be lowered because food out here is just not able to be compared to food back east. Finding good chinese food out here is just as hard as finding good pizza out here. The closest thing I've found to east coast Chinese food is this spot. Got BBQ spare ribs, and general tso's with the hot n sour soup. Soup was pretty good. Ribs had good flavor, but needed way more sauce. General Tso's was just ok. Nothing special. Four stars for friendly staff, quick service and simply because I am comparing them to the other Chinese food I've had in the area. If I want Chinese food, I'll probably be back."}
{"text":"Best Take out Chinese Food Ive had in Henderson. My father in law is New Yorker and is very picky about his Chinese Cuisine. And this was a hit with him and the rest of us!"}
{"text":"Close to home, flavors are ok but the sweet and sour pork has way to much doughy breading on it, it would be so much better crispy or even a light coating of batter. It felt like I was eating pork doughnuts. The fried rice seems prepared in advanced with not to much going on flavor wise. The wonton soup and general tso's chicken is good, and the place is quick and convenient. Lunch specials for $5.75 is a killer deal."}
{"text":"Tried it for the first time today and holy shit, delicious! My roommate got a large pork fried rice and I got the orange chicken lunch special, including pork fried rice. Portions are extremely large, and the price is great! I also had a coupon for two free egg rolls and those alone were a meal! They also include the soup with to go unlike no other Chinese restaurant! Overall great experience and I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"I ordered the spare rib combo with pork fried rice and a side of won ton soup. There was only 4 ribs. They were ok I guess....There was a lot of chewy fat so I probably wouldn't order it again. The rice however was good. Very flavorful. Haven't had the won ton soup yet. Maybe if I get hungry later tonight."}
{"text":"Stopped in last night with my 12 yr old daughter.  The food was excellent!  I had shrimp with snow peas, It was the perfect mx of Peas, water chestnuts, bamboo shoots, celery & a bit if carrot for color with some really good size perfectly cooked shrimp.  It was my daughters orange tofu that blew my mind though.  I thought I didn't like tofu!  This stuff was amazing, it reminded me of French toast!  Crispy on the outside & smooth in the inside in this amazing sauce that had some serious orange zest in it!  Forget dinner!  Get that broccoli off the plate & let me at it for breakfast! LOL! 
I will definitely go back because I can't wait to try different items I think I know!"}
{"text":"The food is bland here.  Maybe that's how some like their Chinese food - or any food for that matter, but not me.  Had the following items:
-dinner combo (chicken lo mein and fried rice) w/ wonton soup, eggroll, crab rangoon
-beef & mushrooms w/ steamed rice

Cons:
-bland flavor all around
-thick wonton wrappers - I don't like having to chew through thick wonton skin especially in my soups
-chewy eggroll

Pros:
-huge dinner combo portion
-price (under $15 for everything)

I've definitely had better elsewhere; most likely not a return for me.  I guess if you're looking for quantity over quality, then go for it and try it out.  If you seek quality flavor, then it's an easy skip."}
{"text":"I am extremely satisfied with the food I ordered. It's so good! It wasn't too pricey, I love that they do large and small orders, everything was perfectly seasoned and the moo goo gain pan was AWESOME. So glad I ordered from here."}
{"text":"Terrible service
 Called to order delivery told it would arrive in about 30 minutes
 45 minutes later no food called them again told another 30 minutes. 45 minutes later no food them again. They said it would be 30 more minutes. No apologies no sorry, no discount nothing from them at all. I told them forget it. Never ordered from them again or even walk in to tale out. I give all my business to Little Dumplings."}
{"text":"Soooo good! Taste like just like it's from NY!! The pork fried rice has so much pork!! It tastes fresh and they give a very good portion of food. The egg-roll was really good too!"}
{"text":"I have given this place many chances and I'm sorry but it not good at all. There's is nothing I eat on the menu that keeps me coming back. I hate go bash a restaurant because they are nice and hard workers but there just isn't good, in my opinion"}
{"text":"Fast delivery. Food was delivered hot and fresh and everything tasted great. The delivery drive was also very kind."}
{"text":"I've eaten at this place 10-15 times and almost always get kung pao chicken. The problem i have is that they put so little chicken into it that i wind up paying mostly for stir-fried celery and other low-cost veggies. I finally made a complaint when i ordered and they increased the amount of chicken...barely.  There are better places so i won't be going back."}
{"text":"I order from NY Chinese once a week. Joe the delivery guy is sweet and polite. Food is delicious. Reminds me of home. Always have the shrimp and snow peas with brown sauce, egg rolls, chicken drumettes and pork fried rice. Last for two days. No complaints. 
See you next week Joe."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Chinese restaurants in town. Way better than Little Dumplings, and the staff is much friendlier. I love their combination dinners. . . so much food I always have left overs."}
{"text":"Darn, they must have gotten a new chef because \"Yucky\" is the best way I can describe my last \"meal\" here.  

I ordered some Won Ton soup...what a disaster. They completely changed the recipe and added some pork strips and so the won-tons ended up dyed pink and the taste? Horrible.  I spit it out. 

Not sure if it was spoiled rotten but it was disgusting.  

The chicken noodle soup was a boring spaghetti cheap stringy old rubbery stringy strips of chicken and plain broth. 

Ugh, never again."}
{"text":"This place doesn't scream New York like I expected it too.  It seems less greasy than your normal Chinese joint though.  

The chicken fried rice was bad.  It was literally fried rice with small strips of chicken placed on top.  I'm afraid to think they used a batch of fried rice and placed chicken strips on top but it didn't taste old.  

I posted pics of the menu as I suggest just ordering out or having them deliver it to you.  I've dined in here before and the people working here are nice and you'll notice they have repeat customers, especially from residents in Sun City.  

As far as items go, I would go with Steamed Dumpling's for appetizer and entree's of either General Tso's Chicken, Chicken with Garlic Sauce, Four Season, or Seafood Delight.  I would stay away from the Lemon Chicken, Fried Rice, and Walnut Shrimp (Panda surprisingly did this better).  I woudn't not go but if you're dying to try this then get it out of your system.  It's not the best but it's alright.

Brown Rice is always a good option, few places have this option and I'd always choose this if I came here."}
{"text":"I only experienced the food as take out.  I was not impressed.  

We ordered sesame chicken.  The chicken we got was soggy, doused in sauce, and not sesame like at all.  

The fried rice and noodles were sub par at best.  I won't be back - There are too many other inexpensive Chinese take out places with better product."}
{"text":"Avoid at all costs. Treated my wife so bad and the food is below 9/10 other quick Chinese restaurants. Stay away"}
{"text":"I ordered 2 chicken lo mein to pick up whenI got there the order was ready but was put it a messy container with the foil covering it which had a rip in it, I had to ask for another foil to cover it.  I got 2 egg rolls which was on a coupon special and asked for Chinese mustard to go with it . The snotty girl at the counter gave me an attitude about it. I also asked for hot sauce and she gave me siracha but I wanted the other kind and she actually said to me that she never had a customer that want so much sauce! She gave me a terrible attitude and i told her that it was just condiments to ho with my meal. She proceed to scream at me, it was the worst experience that I have ever had.  I've had their lo mein before and it was average at best, a nit too oily for me. I however never had good service there.  I don't recommend this place at all !"}
{"text":"I can't believe how bad this food is. Egg foo young, the only thing about it that resembles egg foo young is the egg. Orange chicken hardly worth eating. They didn't get most of my order right as well. Most of a very large order for the holiday was unbeatable.  I'm finding this very hard to believe a restaurant can be this bad. Crab ragoons do not have crab in it. They are terrible."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch after a haircut next door.    My 1st time here me it was a great lunch special.   Soup fried rice and Mongolian chicken for $6.99.  And hey a 20oz sod in Vegas for $1.50.  ILL BE BACK"}
{"text":"The orange beef was indeed the worst dish I had ever gotten in all my years.  I felt like Clara from the old Wendy's commercials, \"Where's the beef?\"  The dogs did enjoy it.  The egg rolls were less than average as was the kung po chicken, I swear the chicken was spongy.  We used to go to the location on Lake Mead occasionally but not for years so don't know if that one went downhill also.  The one positive note is we did not get sick.  Of course, we didn't eat much of it either."}
{"text":"The food was hot. Order delivered within an hour. However the food sucked!  well not all of it the soup was ok. But that was the one thing that wasnt really hot. General tso chicken had an overly sweet red sauce that seem to come out of a can. The food looked like something from dirty dining.  Such a waste of money. Gave two-star due to the fast delivery and hot food. Taste gets no star.  Absolutely the worst i have had from this place. The food get worst and worst.  I knew i should of just got mcdonalds.  The food was so bad i want my money back. Your better off going to panda express."}
{"text":"Definitely way better than I thought it would be! A guy with whom I work with recommended this for lunch last week and I must say I was surprised, especially with the insanely low lunch price. Would definitely recommend"}
{"text":"I love the food here but the younger girl with glasses that sometimes works at the front is so rude its enough to make me not want to come back. She treats customers horribly. Gives them attitude and makes snide remarks."}
{"text":"worse food.. got order home and it was not complete. worse egg rolls..hot and sour soup..sweet and sour pork was like dog food.."}
{"text":"I am addicted to this place for the past 4 years.  Their food taste fresh and never over cooked.  The lunch special is a good amount of food for a great price. The spicy garlic beef is amazing"}
{"text":"Really good food and large portions.
It bothers me to see such a good neighborhood restaurant get a mediocre overall score because of so many 1 star complaints about delivery and not the food and value itself. (Don't be so lazy and pick it up)

While not perfect (could b more flavorful) as a few other reviewers have noted, I can't beat the overall value and quality. 4.5-5 star rating from me"}
{"text":"I am reading a lot of negative comment about this restaurant but based on a fellow \"eastcoaster's\" recommendation I tried it. I honestly gotta say.. I loved it! Maybe I got lucky the 1st time... IDK . Got pupu platter, fried rice, lo mein... I have been looking for chinese similar to back home and this is it!! Anyone from back east knows what I'm talking about when it comes to \"west coast chinese\" and \"east coast chinese\" food.. Not the Best but definately the best I have found out here. If anyone has any other recommendations please do share with me!! THANKS!!"}
{"text":"We don't do Chinese often, but when we do, we always order from here. Every time we have ordered, the food is great and good portions for the price. We always order too much and have leftovers, which also taste great! The usually do take away and it is always ready when promised. We never have to wait to pick it up. It is nice to be in and out so fast."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge fan of Chinese food, but we were craving fried rice, and so I yelped and remembered seeing this Chinese restaurant by Target. We called and ordered fried rice, chicken low mein and sesame chicken.  Ready in 30 minutes, when we arrived we paid and requesting some spicy hot mustard and sweet and sour, reluctantly the lady behind the counter handed over 3 tiny containers each. 
When we arrived home, we dove in and I must say I was pleasantly surprised by the freshness and quality. 
The restaurant does have about 10 tables to sit, and you'd be waited on. It appeared to be clean. 
I'd probably return next time I need a fried rice fix."}
{"text":"This restaurant serves the closest tasting Cantonese food to New York style Chinese food. We enjoy their dishes once a week. The restaurant is clean and the food is delicious."}
{"text":"Wow, this is a hidden gem in Henderson.  The rangoons and pot stickers are amazing.  I'm talking giant potstickers, like the size of your fist.  The egg drop soup was great.  We all loved our entrees.  I had the Kung pow chicken and was surprised at how generous they were with the chicken.  Next time you're in Henderson and craving Chinese, check this place out because they take care of you.  The only issues are the place is small for dine in."}
{"text":"This place was like a ghost town when I walked in. But that's ok on account of my general dislike of people. It was clean and after rubbing sleep out of her eyes, the lady behind the counter greeted me.

I'd like to preface this part of my review by letting ya'll know how much I hate onions. I can not convey enough how disgusting I find white onions, green onions, red onions, leeks, chives, scallions or anything in the onion family. (It's really hard to order most foods but I digress.) I give the menu a rundown and notice that it's less expensive than most chinese take out places and the cheap ass inside me smiles. I order the lunch special ($5.75!) and a side of lo mein. Then I give the lady my No Onions Please speech. She's like, \"Oh no problem, we don't put onions in our food.\" I swear to you, the heavens opened up and and a chorus of angels started singing \"Hallelujah\". You have no idea how rare this is. People put onions in EVERYTHING. But not this place apparently.

So while I'm mentally planning my wedding here, the lady tells me it'll be a five minute wait, which is slightly optimistic, in my opinion. 15 minutes later my food comes out but I'm not even bothered by the amount of time it took since I was still on my onionless high. And the food was delicious. 

So yeah, I'll be back and I recommend, this place to anyone who likes cheap tasty chinese food. I especially invite my fellow Onion Haters to try this place. They get us."}
{"text":"Waited 1 hour and 10 minutes for cold, mediocore food. Extremely disappointed!! I called to complain and the gentlemen I spoke with was very disinterested....save your time and $$"}
{"text":"This place is great! Reasonably priced and I am from NY and like their food! I do not know if the name is just NY or they are from NY but they make good food! We have been looking for a good take out Chinese place since July 2012, tried about three others including China Tango and Panda Express ( very chain like) this place is bar far the best in town!

We had the general TSO Chicken, very good and tasty sauce, a bit spicy for me but it was good! General TSO is usually spicy so I cant complain.

Good also was the spring rolls, the lo mein and the chicken and broccoli, I look fwd to trying some of their other dishes and lunch specials in the future."}
{"text":"Egg rolls were good. Should have asked for more sweet and sour.
I ordered my favorite Curry Chicken w/onions. Excellent Server was very attentive.
Would definetely return"}
{"text":"Do not order from here. We have been waiting 2 hours and still do not have our food for delivery. Called twice and they keep saying 20 minutes...now 2 hours have gone by and they aren't even nice about it on the phone or offering to comp the order. Horrible service."}
{"text":"We had high hopes for this restaurant based on some of the reviews and also how busy the restaurant was. Fried rice was too dry. Chicken lo main was ok. Egg rolls yuck! My husband got some spicy chicken dish and he said it was good. With more Chinese food restaurants in the surrounding area I don't think that we will be returning to this one."}
{"text":"If you like & miss East coast (think NY & DC here) Chinese food, then you will LOVE this place.  

Plan ahead, delivery takes at least an hour on a fri night.  Order online & vacuum the house or wash the dog...you'll have time!  I'm not taking off any stars for this since I'm lazy and not driving to get food on a fri night & I had read the other reviews so was prepared to wait.  

I left NY in 1995 and have yet to find any restaurant (fine dining or dive in 6 different states) that makes cold sesame noodles like my favorite hole in the wall in Kew Gardens....until tonight that is!   YUM x10!!  And a big portion (enough for 4).   Tiny little bit of shredded carrots & even tinier bits of shredded cabbage on top which is perfect IMO.   Why muck up the star attraction with veggies?!

The pork fried rice has the perfect amount of peas, pork chunkettes & chinese-y flavor.   No soy sauce necessary and it's not greasy...score!!

We ordered the family dinner with hot/sour soup, egg rolls, sweet/sour chicken (I hate, but it is hubs' favorite) and Mongolian beef (figured it was a safe try-out meal).  

It was still 90 degrees out so we skipped the (steaming hot) soup saving it for later.   The beef was moist, tender-ish and spicy but not tongue on fire hot (I don't like hot so by normal hot & spicy standards it was probably only a 1 out of 5 peppers).  When you order online, there is a place for special instructions so you could get them to make it hotter if you like.  As far as the sweet/sour chicken, the portion is huge and I tasted the chicken (no mystery meat here!) and thought it to have a very good chicken to breading ratio & also NOT greasy.   And I know you thought I forgot to review the egg rolls, but I was saving the best for last.  Get a load of this....we got 2eggrolls, 2 crab Rangoon AND 2 fried shrimp for our appy.....who doesn't love a gift with purchase?!?!  I scarfed both Rangoon & hubs ate the shrimp & 1 eggroll.  It is rare he will agree to eat Chinese food with me and even more rare that he will say anything nice about it, but he says, \"very good, I thought it was all very good/no complaints with anything.   Best we've had (since moving here 2 years ago).  No, really!\"

They give you a little packet of 2 mustard, 2 soy sauce & 2 duck sauce and 2 packets of crunchies.  We didn't use any of it...everything had such a good flavor on its own.   There was no plastic ware, but I guess they assumed they were delivering to a house that has silverware.  So if you're picking up or in the middle of moving, ask for plasticware.  

Can't wait for leftovers tomorrow!"}
{"text":"We had friends come in town from California, and after a drive out to Red rock we all agreed on quick take out. 
Needless to say, we found our new \"Go-To\" for Chinese. I ordered a large order of the Wor wonton soup. WHICH I HIGHLY RECOMMEND. I was beyond impressed. The base of this soup was so incredibly flavorful. It did not taste like your typical chicken stock base. The \"dumplings\" or \"wontons\"  in the soup were VERY good. The soup was filled to the brim with a lot of shrimp, pork, and just about every veggie you could imagine. It tasted so fresh. I vowed to order this soup with every order after trying it. 

For entrees, We got the orange chicken. Wow. The portion was huge. Enough for two- and some will be left over. The orange chicken was spiced perfectly. It had the slightest kick, and flavor was outstanding. We also got an order of Mongolian beef. This was also another great pick. I was so full after a serving of soup and a few bites of chicken that I hardly got to show this dish any love. Luckily it reheated the next day and was tastier than ever. We got a large side of chicken low mien for our daughter. We of course stole a couple of bites and it was very good. This place was a total hit. It's very reasonably priced, everyone loved their dish, and the portions are out of control! 

We will be back!"}
{"text":"This place is right by my house but it took them 1 hour and 15 min to deliver my food only to find that the food they delivered was someone else's (after going through all the food and opening it of course). The delivery guy came back  after I called the place to demand a refund. They likely took that food to the other customer, I'm sure they didn't re-make it.  I would be horrified if I found out my food was at someone else's house for 15 minutes. Yuck."}
{"text":"We love this little neighborhood gem. There are just tables, and always busy. Phones ring constantly, too, for pick up and delivery. The war wonton soup is fantastic. Large pieces of BBQ pork, chicken, veggies and wontons in a flavorful broth hit the spot. The steamed dumplings are another favorite, as is the cashew chicken, and steamed veggies with garlic sauce for the light and healthy side. Service is fast and friendly. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This Chinese food is great the best you're going to get out of here, they even had the same Source packs like New York it's best to call ahead  because it takes  time to cook their very busy, at least we all know all the food is fresh"}
{"text":"This is my second time eating here.... I ordered 2 lunch specials: General Tso Chicken and Shrimp With Garlic Sauce, fried rice, wanton soup....also, an order of fried shrimp dumplings. All the food was average, to slightly above average. So I am going to stick with my original rating of 3 to 3 1/2 stars."}
{"text":"Not very good at all- fried food packed over steamed veggies makes for soggy food. Spring rolls sucked- huge and stuff inside was mushy yuckiness.  Very mediocre.   Dying for chinese food for my birthday, made for a sucky birthday meal.  Triee before and thought the food was pretty ok, this meal changed my mind."}
{"text":"Ordered twice so far and been very happy with the quality and delivery speed.  I was hesitant since I've had bad experiences with restaurants that aren't in china town but this place was on point!

Portion sizes are decently filling.  Delivery time in Eat24 said an hour yet I was pleasantly surprised to have the food in 40 minutes.  Will be a repeat customer"}
{"text":"This restaurant is fairly priced. The egg rolls are tasty, however the fried rice is bland and broccoli beef is overly saucy and garlicky. Their lo main was pretty good, but the chunks of veggies were huge. Overall it was nice to try somewhere new, but I won't be going back."}
{"text":"This Chinese food is one of the better ones for the price.
It is fast, convenient, and the portion is pretty good here too! I am a fan of the spicy eggplant. Will definitely be coming back here to try the rest of the things on the menu!"}
{"text":"*sigh* Where do I start...I'm truly upset & confused as to how this place has good reviews! Me andy fiancé were starving on a Sunday & we were craving chinese food. We ordered shrimp fried rice, sesame chicken, pepper steak, and egg drop soup. Now let me just say the fried rice I thought was decent. My fiancé stated otherwise. He thought the rice was overcooked.  Soup was also good. But the pepper steak was the absolute WORST we've ever had. Flavors were there, but the \"steak\" didn't taste like steak at all. It was mushy. Had a very weird taste can't even describe. Sesame chicken was ok. Not good after the first day but I think that happens with all fried foods. Waste of $40 Sunday dinner. Sadly, we will not be eating here again. But they do have really great service! Delivery guy was so nice & kind lady that took my complicated order because my fiancé is a picky one. Lol

Oh forgot to add...the cream cheese wontons are MONEY! I would only return for those little fried pieces of heaven..."}
{"text":"Absolutely the BEST General Tsos Chicken!  We also had the Egg Foo Yung, Shrimp in garlic sauce and the Crab Rangoon which is exceptionally flavorful.  The owners (or whatever family) are always on hand and are very friendly and accommodating."}
{"text":"Best Chinese Food in town.  We love their Orange Chicken it's delicious.  We moved a little farther but willing to drive because it's worth it."}
{"text":"Never had ny style chinese food so i didnt know what to expect. Ordered garlic shrimp it was delicious. Their hot & sour soup is one the better ones I've had. I'll be back to try another dish."}
{"text":"Favorite take out restaurant in this area. Really authentic and the staff is always so nice, I love coming for the lunch specials. My favorite is the general tso chicken, garlic fried rice and the wonton soup but it can be a little bland sometimes."}
{"text":"Love the Yelp order app for this place.  We ordered 

4 wonton soup with noodles and it was flavorful, but there were no noodles instead we got 4 fried wonton baggies instead. Not their fault since I had wishful thinking that they had Hong Kong noodle wonton soup at a place called New York Chinese 

We also ordered the beef chow fun but when we opened it at home it was chow mein (thin rice noodle) and it was shockingly good since this wasn't what we ordered.  

Glad we tried this place as this will be a coin toss between this and the one next to Smith"}
{"text":"A few months ago, my grandfather and I ordered, a credit card was used to pay and the tip was left blank because we gave a cash tip. They took it upon themselves to write in a $10 tip and charge it to the card. 

Today, I ordered again, but paid with cash this time. I used their online ordering system. I waited 15minutes before I went to pick up my food. I ordered chicken chow mein. When I got their they had no record of my order and looked in a pile of papers and said, \"we just got it\" clearly that was a lie since it was already at the bottom of a stack of papers. When I got my order they gave me what resembled a gelatinous soup with lettuce (not cabbage), chunks of chicken and only a few noodles. I showed them and expressed my concerns and they told me the order was correct. Methinks not. I will never order from this place again."}
{"text":"I was highly recommended by a friend to try this restaurant. I decided to give it a try yesterday, and was pleasantly surprised. I ordered egg fried rice, orange chicken, beef lo mein and chicken with snow peas. The food was delicious! I'm excited to have a good Chinese take-out restaurant near my house."}
{"text":"Excellent taste of food very tasty! Ordered wonton soup, chicken fried rice, egg & veggie rolls for delivery and they put everything in the bag, including soy sauce & fortune cookies  Thanks guys, keep up the good service!!"}
{"text":"Wanted to like this place as a native of Queens, but no.

I wish the food was bland like for the other reviewers, but it was just weird tasting.  Waited almost an hour for my food - not exactly what I expect when I order takeout.  Worst of all, my husband got sick from it and was out of commission for almost a week.

Chances of going back - none."}
{"text":"It's pretty hard these days to find solid tasting Chinese food that doesn't put a dent in your wallet.  I've been coming to this place for several months now and I figure it's about time I write a yelp review about this place.

I dig the lunch specials ($5.25 everyday, not just weekdays) with a wide selection of foods. My personal favorites are General Tso's and Sesame Seed Chicken with steamed rice and wanton soup.

The wanton soup is the best wanton soup I have ever encountered, hands down.  The staff is super friendly, I am always full whenever I eat there, I dig the egg rolls.  Everything I ordered has been great, I can't help but give this place less than 5 stars.

No stories, no wacky convo's, no random encounters with strangers.  Just a very solid establishment that I'm a huge fan of and I will continue to go there as long as I live in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, decent price and yummy food. Great for chinese take outs."}
{"text":"Love this place. Google service , the food was delicious. I would recommend this place"}
{"text":"Various mini-crises meant a dinner even later than usual.  Trader Joe was already closed, so no cooking.  Almost 10 pm on a Monday, so Mercadito's late HH wasn't gonna fly, either.  Chipotle?  Also too late.  Fall back to our fallback:  NY Chinese Restaurant, right around the corner.

I didn't update my review after our last take-out from there.  If I had, I might have read it and just stuck with a container of yogurt.  I've been loath to eat anything from there since their infamous appearance on Channel 13's Dirty Dining segment.  This report was particularly egregious, since the young woman interviewed by the great Darcy Spears categorically denied every single thing they were cited for by the Board of Health, and it was pretty bad.  The B of H shut them down.  (See photo posted by another Yelper). Nevertheless, hunger wins every time.  Well, not next time, since this was the final straw.

It's easy to measure the decline of quality when you order almost the identical things every time, and this time was no exception.  Hot and Sour soup was medium spicy, but the amount of \"stuff\" in the soup has whittled down to almost nothing.  A couple of mushrooom halves, a couple of pieces of tofu, and the rest made up of long strings of celery.  Not only am I not a big fan of celery, I detest having to eat soup and pull pieces of unchewable and undigestable pieces of celery strings out of my mouth while I'm eating.  Good thing this wasn't a first date - not a pretty sight.  What happened to bean sprouts, the pork, or all the other goodies that a good hot and sour should have?  That their hot and sour USED to have.  Speaking of sour, someone needs to tell them that hot and sour needs some SOUR.

The eggrolls were all right - the shell hot and crisp, the filling less bitter than usual. (Free with coupon and a $10 order).

But the main dish we shared - Chicken in Garlic Sauce - was abominable.  We always ask for a lot of extra ginger, and it was undetectable.  It's supposed to be a spicy dish, but there was NO spice, none, niente, nada.  Bland as could be.  Tender, but tasteless, chicken.  Oh, there was a little cup of red spicy stuff on the side, but I like to have my spice cooked WITH my food, not play with it until I get it right.  

Will someone please open a restaurant that stays open past 9 or 10 pm on a weeknight?  Is that too much to ask for in a 24-hour town?  Because I'm pretty sure this was our last run to NYCR."}
{"text":"If you want cheap take out Chinese food this is the place to go! They have the best Wonton soup here. The Wontons are pretty big. If you get the soup with a special it will typically come with two. I like that they have lunch and dinner specials.  The selections are okay but not impressive. The special comes with not only the soup but with fried rice and an egg roll. If you eat in they add little wonton crisps that you can snack on.The portions are a pretty big for the price! I had the Sesame Chicken special it tasted similar to sweet and sour chicken except they sprinkle sesame seeds on the top."}
{"text":"Great stuff here, quick delivery and fresh food.  I thought the hot and sour soup was the best and the rest was A ok...  Hotel delivery let me enjoy my hotel room in style..."}
{"text":"This was a to-go order, so take it for that. This is in Summerlin, too.

We got a large variety of stuff and all of it was very good and stayed super hot in the packaging. Egg Fu Young, eggrolls, Chicken Lo Mein solid -- and not really greasy or MSG-y as far as I could tell. (No gallon of water to drink for the rest of the night).

There was a spicy dish too that I enjoyed with vegetables and chicken. Brown rice was a nice option, too. 

Now, the beef and broccoli - well the broccoli was actually more of a highlight. The beef was a bit chewy, so that's something I hope can be improved upon. Otherwise, I'd definitely recommend NYCR and would gladly eat their food again."}
{"text":"Used to order from here a lot but haven't visited in close to two years... Until tonight. 

The first thing I noticed was that the cleanliness of the restaurant was terrible. The front glass door is covered in greasy hand prints from months of accumulation, not just a day or two. It obviously hasn't been cleaned in several months, possibly longer. Then when I entered the restaurant it was equally grimy. That scared me a bit as I picked up an order of chicken chop suey to go.

After getting it home I could tell the chicken had a tinge of, well, oldness to it. Like it was on its last day of edibility before being prepared. It was chewy and had a funny taste so i didn't eat much. Sure enough, three hours after eating a small amount I'm having stomach problems... And my gut is iron clad!- haven't thrown up in 19 years. 

Anyway, I'm sorry to say my once favorite quick Chinese restaurant in town is no more."}
{"text":"Just visited this place It was pretty good It wasn't the best but it wasn't the worst I would say its better then average So if you're having a chinese food crisis and its close to where you live i would give it shot I really like you can order everything online Thats why i tried it"}
{"text":"I've always wanted to try this restaurant since it opened. But never had the chance to. My gf and I had a chance to go there this past weekend and we were both amazed because its a small but constantly busy. The food was great.... Authentic... And super flavorful. We were both very surprised and will for sure come back again. The only downside side was that they were very busy and only one waiter."}
{"text":"We had just moved into our place in GVR, it was 10pm, we had 3 kids under 5 with us headed to Target for some \"shit, our new house has no toilet paper\" type items. Everybody was tired, hungry, hangry, ya know. We drove by this place and my husband SLAMMED on the brakes and parked. We fully expected some half-okay Chinese food, but we were just excited to have something warm in our stomachs.

Low and behold, it was really good! It was ungodly hot. I mean, ungodly hot. So, let me just say that THEY MAKE YOUR FOOD FRESH. So fresh and so hot. That was my fault for not testing temperature before I shoveled it into my mouth. I got the shrimp noodles, I can't quite recall the name. It was the wider noodles and a brown sauce. My husband got the combo plate with Mongolian chicken and fried rice with wonton soup and an egg roll. That's a mouthful. The combo plate was a whole lot of food for really cheap, and the husband says \"that Mongolian chicken was FIRE.\" His words. Lol. 

All in all, if you're in the area and in need of some super comforty comfort food that's warm and soft and fuzzy and tastes good..... AND is priced very reasonably, this is your spot!"}
{"text":"We always order from here but today's food was off! My brother in law didn't care much for it he wanted to order out from his original place  I don't know if they change hands or something else is wrong the sweet sour chicken looked funny before u put the sweet on!"}
{"text":"With 45 check-ins here, you could say I am a fan of New York Chinese Restaurant. I have been a fan of New York Chinese Restaurant before they opened this location a couple of years back. I'd dine in their Lake Mead Boulevard and Fort Apache restaurants when I was in the Summerlin area. 

   I am a fan of New York Chinese Restaurant because they bring the East Coast Chinese restaurant cuisine to Southern Nevada. In comparison to many and least every Southern Nevada Chinese restaurant that I have been to, they serve a Chinese Restaurant experience that is unique West of the Appalachian Mountains. For starters, the meal includes wonton soup instead of the usual hot and sour soup or egg drop soup. The egg roll is East Coast style, large and crunchy. The major difference is the chow mein that is served with either pork or chicken. This is a vegetable and cabbage based chow mein. 

   Whenever, I visit New York Chinese Restaurant, nearly every time I dined here for dinner, I ordered the chicken chow mein without celery. This is a dish that I have been going goo goo over since I was a toddler, and a dish that my parents would reward me with for a treat. So, as an adult, I will reward myself with the New York chow mein. In comparison to a New York Chinese Restaurant this chow mein could hold its own. There is a few increments of tastiness leading up to this New York style delicacy. The meal starts off with crunchy noodles served with duck sauce. I pat extra for bottomless Coke.  Then there is a delicious bowl of wonton soup. I appreciate that New York Chinese Restaurant serves wonton soup with the meal. Wonton soup is one of my dearest foods in the World and in my opinion every Chinese restaurant ought to include wonton soup with the meal. Then with the meal, I order fried rice over white or brown rice. The chicken chow mein dinner plus a beverage adds up to around $11.

   When I visit New York Chinese Restaurant for lunch, I usually order the chicken lo mein lunch special. Interestingly the New York chow mein is omitted from the lunch special. I also give applause to the chicken lo mein which includes the crunchy noodles,  wonton soup, and rice. The bill usually adds up to around $8 with a soda. 

  In contrast to the majority of my Chinese restaurant reviews, New York Chinese Restaurant is unique in the sense that I am mentally comparing it to the establishments in New York. I haven't indulged in New York chow mein in many of the Las Vegas restaurants. There was one time recently that I tried shrimp with lobster sauce. To be honest, it trailed behind some of the Las Vegas Chinese restaurants. 

  New York Chinese Restaurant's biggest problem besides the Lake Mead Boulevard location Dirty Dining press, is they just cannot handle when it gets busy. There have been a couple of times on a Saturday for example that I'd just sit patiently for the server to acknowledge me. There have been other times where I'd have to walk to the restroom to pick up paper towels. It is on account of the fact that they serve a unique cuisine in the Las Vegas market that I'd tolerate this. There were a few times in the past, when it is busy I cannot get a table causing me to substitute another restaurant experience. The restaurant that holds a take-out ambience only holds around eight tables. 

   New York style chow mein and wonton soup are Chinese food that I have been fond of since toddler hood. With that said, I am fond of New York Chinese Restaurant despite its faults. Before I fly across the continent to New York, I will fly on cloud nine savoring New York style chow mein and wonton soup in New York Chinese Restaurant."}
{"text":"I am a fan of New York Chinese Restaurant. Unfortunately it is a distance from where I live in Henderson    

 New York Chinese Restaurant is a Vegas Chinese Restaurant that gives New York Chinese Restaurants a run for their money. They serve tasty New York Style Chinese food that I grew to love and miss. Before stepping foot in this sit down Chinese Take Out style restaurant, I ordered the New York style chow mien combination with a cola. Contrary to Vegas Chinese restaurants that offer  New York style chow mien, New York Chinese Restaurant's is pleasing to the taste buds. My complaint was too much celery. However, It is my understanding that New York Chinese Restaurant cooks their food the way the customer wants it. New York Chinese Restaurant are the first Las Vegas Chinese Restaurant that I know of to include won ton soup (delicious) with  combination dinners. The egg roll and fried rice that were also included in the combination were pleasing on the taste buds. New York Chinese Restaurant provides customers with a reasonable size glass for cola. 

   I also appreciated that they did not rush my brother and I. After finishing the meal we spent several minutes talking (by now the only people in the place). I am a fan of New York Chinese Restaurant. Regretfully I am a fan who lives in the other end of town."}
{"text":"New York Chinese Restaurant puts me in a New York State of Mind. It serves New York style Chinese food that is out of this world.

  My past visit to their Lake Mead Boulevard location left me with an exceptional first impression of New York Chinese Restaurant. When I write exceptional first impression, I am saying that it is my contemporary favorite Chinese restaurant in the Vegas valley. With that in mind, when I hiked in Red Rock Canyon this past Saturday, I planned it so that I would try their Fort Apache location on my drive back to Henderson.   

  New York Chinese Restaurant blends into the Fort Apache landscape. Passing the southwest corner of Fort Apache at Spring Mountain, it is easy to pass New York Chinese Restaurant, which sits in a shopping center anchored by a Dollar Tree. Featuring only eight tables and a take-out environment, the restaurant itself is ordinary. Due to the fact that New York Chinese Restaurant appears to have a strong take-out business, I landed a table with ease.

  I ordered Chinese food that delivered me back to my fond memories of eating Chinese food in New York. Their chicken chow mien combination which included won ton soup, crunchy noodles, fried rice, and an egg roll was déjà vu to my taste buds. The fact that New York Chinese Restaurant includes won ton soup instead of the conventional egg drop soup made an impression on me. The New York style chow mien that they feature is a different entrée than the chow Mein served in Las Vegas Chinese restaurants.  This chow mien is vegetable instead of noodle based. Because I dislike celery, I specifically directed them to eliminate the celery. They listened and the chow mien was first-rate. 

   
  Their cold beverages are Coke beverages. It works like this. If you order a cold beverage, they give you a disposable cup. Near the counter is the Coke machine. You serve yourself as often as you want.

  When you dine in, they will deliver your food to the table and clean up after you. I feel that this service deserves a dollar tip. Most of all I feel that Yelpers deserve a bigger tip: As of the time I write this review, New York Chinese Restaurant is a first-rate restaurant specializing in New York style Chinese food that will put you in a New York State of Mind."}
{"text":"Well I can't say it's the best I've had but for delivery it was good. They were a half hour late with the delivery and forgot part of my order. I guess that's par for the course. Won't order again more than likely."}
{"text":"We live down the street and use to get it allot.  I would have given it a 4 or 5 star a few years ago but the food and service has deteriorated allot. Allot of times there short on help, and the food looks and taste like its thrown together. ..sorry New York Chinese, but you need to go back to how it was.  Maybe new management ?"}
{"text":"We've been here a few times and find it inconsistent. The lemon chicken was doughy. The General Tsao's chicken was not spices and it was over cooked. The low mein was a little greasy. I know this sounds negative but although not gourmet it is adequate when you just want to grab something. It is not great, but not terrible. We are still searching for a great Chinese place in Henderson."}
{"text":"I hate leaving bad reviews, the service was good and the people were nice but the food was terrible. Bland and just not good. Although they give good portions, the food is just gross. They kept the wonton chips that they serve on the table in an old blue storage container, that was left out in the open and just sitting there in plain sight. It was gross."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I just moved to this side of town. Over on the other side of town we tried several different mom and pop Chinese restaurants and we were left feeling rather disappointed or maybe grossed out.

Last week we drove by and saw the New York Chinese restaurant and decided to give it a try. The first time we tried it we walked in to place our order. We ended up only waiting 15 minutes. The food had much higher quality than what we had experienced from other places in the past. Hot and fresh too.

We definitely wanted to try it again so we called in an order the next time and it was a 30 minute wait. So we were glad that we called that order in. I noticed that they are consistently pretty busy at night. But the wait is worth it to me.

The crab rangoons are my favorite. The egg drop soup is mild but delicious. Last time we tried the sesame chicken and loved it as well as the orange beef.

I recommend this place for Chinese takeout for sure."}
{"text":"We tried this place for the first time yesterday after passing it so many times going to target. We ordered to go. We got two dinner sets, the first one was pork fried rice with sesame chicken and the second was pork fried rice with chicken lo mein. We got two apps - boneless pork short ribs and crispy wontons. The boneless pork shirt ribs were better than I expected them to be and a good amount of them. The skin on the wontons was very thick so you have to really chew, the meat in it was tasty though. The dinner sets we got came with crab rangoons, egg roll and your choice of soup. We got the wonton soup. The chicken lo mein was nothing to write home about. The pork fried rice and sesame chicken were good and we would get them again and probably try another dish. Waited maybe 5-10mins before order was ready. Overall good and I'm keeping on the list."}
{"text":"I'm a born and raised New Yorker and have been living out here for six years.  I've found most of the Chinese food out here to be disappointing.  This place is 100% spot on in doing New York style Chinese food and I'm always weary when any place implies New York style. 

Another reviewer stated this was Chinese food for Americans and gave it a bad rating.  The name of the place is \"New York\" Chinese, not Hong Kong Super Authentic Chinese Food.  Last I checked New York was in America, not China.   That's like going to the best Pizza place in town and saying it wasn't good because you're used to Pizza from Italy.  

Like with any ethnic food, there are two types:  Americanized and Authentic.  I happen to love both!  Americanized Chinese food has it's place and for the most part, the American-style Chinese restaurants in Vegas stink.  

The Low Down:

Won Ton Soup - Awesome!  the Won Tons are made how I'm used to back home.

Egg Roll - Amen!  I've been longing for this for quite some time.  Again, exactly like what I'm used to.  I've had such a hard time finding good egg rolls.

Kung Pao Chicken - Again, Awesome.  NY doesn't really have a style with this, but it was simply good.

Pork Fried Rice - Just what you'd expect.  Nothing special, but it was good. 

My one little tip to get the NY experience:  when you get the noodles and duck sauce in the beginning, ask for the spicy mustard and mix it with the duck sauce."}
{"text":"The name of the restaurant caught my eyes. New York and Chinese? Usually I would only stick with real Asian restaurant names, because it somewhat gives me comfort that it's real Asian food lol. Plus I would go to Chinatown for Asian food. 

My first experience: I was sick so I wanted some soup, my husband bought me wonton soup. It was kinda bland, I thought I was just because I was sick and my taste bud was broken. 

Second time, he was sick, so I ordered wonton soup for him and Szechuan chicken for me. I tried his soup again, it was still bland. Then I had my Szechuan chicken, it tasted nothing like Szechuan chicken that I used to have. 

The restaurant is very small, and they have an open kitchen that you can see from outside, if you are tall enough. That could be one of their ways to show that their food is clean."}
{"text":"My friend and I picked up dinner here last night. We ordered the egg rolls, hot n sour soup, ma po tofu, sweet and sour chicken and house special lomein.
 I was hesitant to try this place, but I'm glad did.  This place is the closest thing I have found to Chinese food back east! I'm so excited! 
First of all, they have actual egg rolls! Not spring rolls that they serve everywhere else.  
Second, I order hot n sour soup every time I eat Chinese and theirs is on point. Exactly how I like mine.  The food was fresh looking and tasting. The shrimp in our lo mein were cleaned, as opposed to a previous review. 
When we asked for hot mustard they gave us the house made good stuff.  I will def be back."}
{"text":"So now I'm a bit more wary of their food. I still like this place but our last order was \"off\". The beef had a weird smell and tasted like it was rotten but they cooked and covered it in enough sauce where you could cover it up, but that \"off\" smell where food has turned was still there. All of us that took a bite before realizing that smell was not our imagination, kept saying the same thing that it was spoiled and tasted spoiled. We ended up just throwing it out. It's not enough of a deterrent to not order again since that was the first time it happened but the next time I'll call the Health Department."}
{"text":"Food is delicious and really enjoy the amount of food you get in combination dinners including both egg roll and soup. Only critic I have is there's no silverware provided nor napkins."}
{"text":"I ordered online my order took 2 hours to get to me I had to call twice and the food was soggy... Also it took the guy 30 mins to get to me when it's 5 away.. I wil come here again"}
{"text":"The New York Chinese is the place place in Summerlin to get fresh & very good Chinese food. The lunch menu is fantastic . Large portions and fits the budget. The help is very helpful when ordering, 5 star.  Order a head on weekend. Long wait if you just go in. But it's worth it. Happy dining. Swordie"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. My favorite place to eat. :) I love it!!!!! I have absolutely no complaints and I've eaten here multiple times:) everything is always amazing and the staff is amazing too:) great place to have an early lunch at or to grab take out:) my favorites are the sweet and sour chicken and the orange chicken. It's just so different from your typical Chinese place. They really make some amazing food here."}
{"text":"The shrimp fried rice is my favorite thing on the menu. For a box of it, it costs me around $5. Need a quick and easy lunch with some yummy flavor? Definitely check this spot out. The quick service they provide is an extra bonus as well."}
{"text":"Again a definite yes!
Fresh, tasty, generous portions.
Easy to pick up and they also offer 5 mile delivery.
Glad to see them doing so well!"}
{"text":"Disgusting. Cashew chicken should be called Celery Cihicken that tastes like the dirt it grew in. Wife orders General's chicken had good flavor but suspect texture and my wife found a piece of plastic embedded in a piece. We threw at least 1/2 the meal away. Maybe the worst Chinese I've ever had."}
{"text":"Everyone was super friendly and helpful! Love the handheld cc machine for delivery. Delivery was fast, well packaged, and the driver provided very courteous service. Big portions and a fair price. Very nice people working there. 
I had the butterfly shrimp jumbo and I like the egg foo young style and big shrimp and veggies but the \"gravy/sauce\" was just tasteless brown oily liquid. Ugh. 
Next time I'll stick with other tried and true options like their kung pao chicken. There's also a Yelp mention that if you call and spend over $10 you get 2 egg rolls (see attached screenshot) and...you don't. Hah. Trust me, I asked and was told no, so they should probably update that because I would have just ordered through the Yelp app then. Anyhow, I would recommend this place for trusty lazy day dependable Chinese delivery fare. Just stick to the basics through when ordering."}
{"text":"Great food! The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is the spice mustard is watered down."}
{"text":"WOW.....I mean, wow. 

I loved my recent visit to this restaurant. The people are very friendly and the place is clean. The food came out hot and fast. We ordered a few lunch specials and they all were very tasty. I have to give props to the veggies. Meat and veggies usually do not cook at the same rate. This is something even a novice chef knows. But time and again people cook everything at the same time and it leads to overdone meat and underdone veg. NY Chinese has perfected the art of an excellent combination. 

I would like to take this moment to gush about my fave part of the meal. THE WON-TON SOUP! Dude, I seriously doubt you will ever find another broth that can beat the one they have at NY. The dumplings have a texture to them that leads me to believe that they are scratch made. Not only are the dumplings delish, but they add slivers of BBQ pork as a garnish to the soup. Nice touch!

A few side notes: 
the chicken in my dish had a few too many fatty pieces. Also, they were cut in different sizes. What I mean is some were sliced for stir-fry, some were cubed. I'm a stickler for consistency. 

Great place for take-out or dine in."}
{"text":"Awesomely good and reasonably priced.

Friends from NYC also love this place. I've never been to the Big Apple, but they say it lives up to its name."}
{"text":"Standard run of the mill Chinese food, not bad but also not great.. The search continues!"}
{"text":"First time eating here, delivery. The beef n broccoli was pasty, and kinda bland. The egg rolls tasted stell. However the Orange chicken was delicious."}
{"text":"Yelp reviews drew me here for a quick Sunday night meal for myself. BBQ pork & wonton soup were 'mama-huhu' - 'so-so' in Mandarin Chinese. Counter staff acted like they were doing me a favor taking my order and serving my food. A table left by diners remained cluttered for the duration of my take-out visit with little care from staff to tidy up. Attitude, people!"}
{"text":"So, Matt S in his review was talking about this being an American Chinese Restaurant, not a Chinese one, so please consider that I would give this a 4 star based on the category of American Chinese.

The main difference of American Chinese vs. Chinese is things like Fried Rice, Orange Chicken, Kung Pao, Chow Mein and all that.  If you like this, then it is American Chinese.  Regular Chinese is things like steamed whole fish, or chicken on the bone with green onion, chicken feet, water spinach sautéed in garlic.... These are more authentic Chinese that most people would not order or taste.

The help - Everyone here seems ethnically Chinese, from the front desk to the cooks and that is kinda rare nowadays.

The food -

Brown Rice - Great choice and you can substitute the white rice with brown rice.  Much more healthy.  That is great stuff.

Beef Chow Fun - The meat was thin, and very tender. Very tasty.  Noodles were thick and just the right fir mess.  good quality vegetables in it and a very nice portion.  I really enjoyed the taste and the texture of this dish.  We ordered two orders because everyone enjoys this.

Curry Chicken - Just the right spice, lots of chicken and again, quality veggies.  Snow peas, mushrooms as well as your traditional celery, carrot and onion.  The spice on this was very mild, just right.  This is another one of our favorites and it did not disappoint.

String Bean with Chicken - Nice. Good taste, lots of chicken and very tender.

Beef Broccoli - Can't complain at all.  Very good, at same time, nothing special.

Tofu and Eggplant - one of the best.  the tofu is lightly fried.  Very nice.  I really enjoyed this and rarely order it.

The price - for basically 8 cartons of food (rice and all) in total, we paid 52.00.  Not too shabby.

The stuff - If you are taking out, don't forget to grab a handful of fortune cookies from the basket. The utensils, and condiments are near the soda fountain and you can take what you need.

The place - Clean, well lit, overall very welcoming and comfortable.

GK says for American Chinese cuisine, be sure to try this place. It is good overall."}
{"text":"We've ordered food from New York Chinese three times now (we live close, so it's convenient). It's not the best Chinese food I've ever had, but it's not the worst either, and it will fulfill a Chinese food craving. We've never had a long wait for the food, it's always been about thirty minutes or less, even with delivery."}
{"text":"I ordered the large NY style Chicken chow mein, fried wontons and egg rolls. Nice small place. Service was fine. Prices were good. Nice size portions and food was the best NY style chinese food I've had in Vegas for past 25 years. Egg rolls were large and stuffed with good fresh ingredients. Chicken chow mein was soo good...... everything tasted perfectly cooked and fresh.White rice was great I will be back over and over again to try their other dishes. I highly recommend you give this place a try"}
{"text":"I love this place.  My husband and I stumbled on it when driving by.  We have been back several times.  Honestly, I am usually disappointed by the Chinese food found in Vegas (*disclaimer, I have not explored China town: we live too far away to go on whim). This is BY FAR my favorite Chinese place on our side.  I am in love with the Walnut Shrimp and my husband really likes their fried rice.  The broccoli is never mushy, the ragoons actually have flavor, I have never been disappointed.

The tables are a bit cramped, but the service is always pleasant.  They are very polite and attentive, and seem to know what I want before I do. =)"}
{"text":"A little hard to find at first a true hole in the wall old fashioned type of family owned and operated restaurant. Limited seating but there no problem getting a table as the majority of their business seems to to be take out. The selection of items on the menu was just about overwhelming. The food was excellent in every aspect. The portions were too big. We ordered a plan B dinner for 2-3 people and and extra orange chicken dish. Took home at least half.....and we are all big adult eaters as well.  Glad I finally found a great non buffet Chinese restaurant. And it's only 3 miles from home, thanks to my niece who lives in LA."}
{"text":"I love the menu here but the time it takes to get a delivery or even a pick-up order is much too long. My order was received at 5:00 and I'm still hungry at 7:00. 
The online ordering is a great feature, but they really need to quicken the pace of their service."}
{"text":"My favorite Chinese food spot ever!! Found this place when I used to live here. And now I still get to have some every time I go visit my bro. Always get chicken wings, sesame chicken, pork fried rice, sesame chicken, mmmmm."}
{"text":"New York Chinese is awesome.. My boyfriend and I won't eat Chinese any where else. The takeout menu comes with soup, which are all delicious. And their portions are large, especially for the price!"}
{"text":"We are big Chinese food fans so based upon the reviews, we placed an online order for the \"Family Dinner A\" on sat night. We placed the order online and the response was it would be 30 minutes for pickup, 70 for delivery. We only live a couple miles away so pick up was the plan.
When I got to the rest, it was pandemonium!  Its a very small place and although they say you can sit, its really not a sit down restaurant. The are not staffed for the amount of business they receive, about 4 counter people were running around but not much getting done, one answering two phones at once....

There were about half a dozen tables all filled with people waiting. When i arrived,  I gave the guy at the counter a printout of my order, he poked around on the register for a while, and said thanks...I said ,\"did you get the order online?\" He said, \"it will be just a few minutes\"...yeah right... 45 min later I asked what was going on, and miraculously our dinner arrived....OK let's hope the food was worth the wait.... Once home we found the order was correct, but some serious quality issues:
1. The Crab Rangoon was not fully cooked (raw dough)...and I know there seldom is real crab in these things but these really were nothing but cream cheese and dough...no veggies no seasoning, just cream cheese...

2. Pork Fired Rice, tasted off, and old like it was yesterdays steamed they used to make today...the really small bits of pork were OK, but the rice had a metallic, freezer burn taste to it.

3. Sesame Chicken, ok a unique version with very thin sauce, mostly thigh meat.

4. Beef with Vegetables, The best entree, but that's not saying much...

The ONLY tasty item were the egg-rolls, and Yes they are like NYC...but that certainly is not enough to recommend this place...

China Tango or China Go Go are far better overall and much faster."}
{"text":"DO NOT EAT HERE!!
The food is stale, cold, and tasteless. 
We ordered \"extra spicy\" general tso chicken... we got ginger flavored brown sugar chicken.
We ordered house special lo mein... it was odorless and bereft of flavor (steamed rice has more flavor)
We ordered potstickers... they were cold and tasted like a pine tree took a crap in them.
We ordered egg rolls... cold, stale, and tough.
The sweet and sour chicken was dried out like it had been sitting in a mall food court all day long.

None of the food was anything like the chinese kitchens in New York. This place is horrible and they should be ashamed of themselves.

Save yourself the money and just go to Panda Express..."}
{"text":"I don't understand how you can get this quality of food for so cheap my wife and I both tried a lunch combo it came with soup entrée and rice of your choice I chose General t. Chicken which also came with a crab Rangoon that actually had something resembling crab in it portions were very generous and each combo deal was six bucks and change Service was impeccable my drink at no point was below the halfway mark a thousand times better than any of the quick Chinese restaurants we had back east in Central Florida"}
{"text":"Ordered at 7:10p on a Saturday... almost 9p and no call or update on restaurant. Then I called. They said my order was just done and in the same conversation they driver was 5 mins away. Which is it?

No delivery yet!!!

Food good, but could have made my own Chinese food in 2 hrs as well...

Get better service and communicate with customers if you are busy..."}
{"text":"Being from New York I don't know what it is about the food out here but sometimes it's not the greatest. When I moved out here one of the things I was on a search for was great Chinese Take Out. We must have tried about a dozen places before we found this place. 

If your looking for a good take out place try this one. Especially if you are from the East Coast, so worth it."}
{"text":"Really horrible food! Nothing remotely like the Chinese I've EVER eaten in New York or, for that matter, ANY quality Chinese restaurant anywhere!  They recently changed their name & I stopped in yesterday to see if they'd also changed their menu. The hostess told me that they are \"working on it\" but still currently  using their old menu. I'd recommend you AVOID this place!"}
{"text":"My family has ordered from this place since it first opened several years ago. Service is always fast and usually friendly. Our favorites include the chicken wings (large, meaty and fried to perfection....about 10 for $6.75), Wor wonton (a generously large bowl for $7) and lemon chicken (white meat...$9.75, including steamed rice). Other dishes, hit and miss, have been tried over the years. It's great to see real egg rolls included with the combination dinners, especially since most Chinese places in town pass off spring rolls as egg rolls. However, I don't particularly for the generic,obviously-from-frozen filling. NYCR's weakest point is the fried rice, which is incredibly bland (seemingly just soy, some heated up bbq pork bits and the awful mixed vegetables). I love a good fried rice and hope to see this improved to an East Coast standard."}
{"text":"There was an unpleasant smell as we entered the restaurant. The waitress was great and attentive to us. The food was not as we expected and here is why. The egg drop soup did not have great flavor and was not even sure it was egg drop when it was placed in front of us. The soup had a brownish color and not the bright yellow color you normally expect. Tried adding soy sauce but did not help the flavor. The waitress did remove this charge from the bill. I ordered the Chicken satay and the chicken was dry and burnt crispy. Great waitress but food was blucky."}
{"text":"The food here is fantastic. I have eaten here a couple of times and each time was impressed with the flavors and the freshness.  I think it is quite unique actually. The service is friendly and the prices are reasonable. The eggplant tofu is the best of it's kind."}
{"text":"Wow! Talk about fast delivery for lunch. I placed an order around 12:40 pm and was delivered by 1:09 pm. Yay!! First time to try this Yelp delivery! Cool beans!! sure to order from here again :) Keep it up!!"}
{"text":"Been here many times.  As a New Yorker,  this is as close to Chinese food as I've had I in NY since living on the west coast for 6 years.  The prices are pretty reasonable for the area.  I suggest the dinner combos.  You get a lot of food for less than $10. You can place your order online easily for pick up or deliver.  I live around the corner and never had it delivered so I can't comment on that."}
{"text":"Good Chinese food is ALWAYS a matter of opinion.  But overall, I liked this place.

We ordered the family meal and substituted 2 different entrees and paid the difference for them.  The people that work there are very nice.  This is more of a fast food/casual chinese place.  It's very small, only 6 tables.  The portions are very large, the soup is great and very flavorful.  The fried rice is just ok though (I've had better)  They definitely don't cheat ya on shrimp or portion size or anything at all like that.  The food is very hot too, and they have good egg rolls.

I tried their brewed green tea (it says unsweetened, but it was definitely sweet) however it was really good. 

I would definitely recommend this place for normal prices, good portion size and just simply very good chinese food. 

Don't forget, the people here are VERY nice."}
{"text":"As the rating suggests: It's ok. Not terrible, not great. It's ok if you are looking for something quick and easy (and a little greasy lol sorry I had to) then this place isn't too bad. I have had better, much better at other hole in the wall chinese places but can't seem to find them here in Las Vegas. I must say the food at this particular establishment has gotten better since when it first opened. Prices are good and service is quick. Girl at the counter is hit or miss.. sometimes friendly, sometimes she seems just angry.
If I could give 2.5 stars I would but I will bump them up to 3 because I'm in a good mood today."}
{"text":"Delivery was a bit slow, 40 minutes from ordering. The restaurant is only 1.5 miles from the location of delivery. The driver was friendly and helpful with bringing the food in. The food itself was pretty good. Since this was my first order from this restaurant, I had my standby, pork fried rice and egg roles. Both were above average. I'd order from here again when in town."}
{"text":"New York Chinese Restaurant is my preferred spot for take out.  I don't eat a lot of Chinese food, but if this place is truly like NYC Chinese food, then cool! Can any New Yorkers vouch for this place? My only brush with Chinese food in NYC are the xiao long bao (soup dumplings) at Joe's Shanghai. 

Wor won ton soup ($7) - fully loaded with won tons, broccoli, char siu pork, mushrooms and veggies! They don't skimp on ingredients here. My only gripe was that it was a little salty, but still edible. 

Lemon chicken ($9.25) - pretty good! I like that there is a good amount of chicken to breading ratio. It was also nice of them to pack the lemon sauce on the side to prevent sogginess. Another plus, is you can control the amount of sauce on you pour on the chicken. The sauce was really balanced not too lemon-y, sweet, or artificial.

Eggplant with tofu in garlic sauce ($5) - For non-meat days, I love this dish because it is super tasty with just the right amount of spice. 

Boneless spare ribs (lunch special) - sliced pieces of tasty, reddish colored pork over white rice. Yummy. For around $6, it's a steal! 

The service here is great, very friendly people! Food always tastes fresh and of better quality than other take out places in town. 

I usually call in my orders and by the time I arrive my food is ready! Kudos to them for offering delivery services as well. Ordered once at the counter and the wait time was very reasonable!

{"text":"I order here all the time. I love that they have an option for delivery because let's face it, I'm lazy! And the delivery guys are always so nice. It has an option on their site for special directions- I personally asked for them to call instead of knock because the babies were sleeping, I love how they have this option and are respectful about it! But I absolutely love their steamed dumplings, seafood chow fun, orange chicken, broccoli and scallops, and their moo shu shrimp! Oh my goodness it is delicious! I've read some previous reviews on how this is New York style, well being as I have never been to New York this place is tickling my fancy for a visit. This place rocks!"}
{"text":"Actually New York style. I like that.

The food is good and I recommend getting the chicken wings and dumplings if you're into New York Food. The only thing missing is the onion pancakes."}
{"text":"I'd consider this average among chinese take-out places in Las Vegas. I've had better, and worse. I'm a big fan of General Tso's chicken and if I'm craving this dish there are a couple of other nearby places I'd rather go (namely Little Dumpling). Service here is fast and friendly."}
{"text":"I found out about this place after I'd gotten stuck in my office for lunch. I was happy to know they delivered since I couldn't leave. The service was quick and the food arrived piping hot. I'd ordered the curry chicken which was definitely much spicier than I'd hoped but nonetheless it was good. For lunch you get soup, your meal choice plus rice, and a yummy wonton all at a decent price. Happy I found this joint."}
{"text":"I've ordered here several times over the past year. Usually ordering the same thing. But I'm giving up on the place. The last few times the quality has significantly gone down. Last night I ordered delivery, it was supposed to take an hour, which is already a really long time, but it was late by an additional half an hour. An hour and a half for something that takes ten minutes to cook is crazy. The food arrived luke-warm. There was no crab in the crab rangoon, just cream cheese. the eggrolls were very oily and very salty. The pork fried rice was crunchy. The General Tso's chicken was mushy from steaming in the container, there was barely any sauce maybe less than a teaspoon, and the chicken was incredibly low quality even for cheap Chinese takeout. I threw most of it out. I won't be ordering from them ever again."}
{"text":"Solid Americanized Chinese!

Good portions and prices, with flavor beating out the average mini-mall token Chinese restaurant.

Ordered a lunch special, which included choice of soup....Egg Drop Soup for me. Good rendition, could use more black or white pepper to taste.

General Tso's Chicken w/ Pork Fried Rice (Lunch $5.95). Again, solid Americanized Chinese, whether it's NY style is debatable.  I enjoyed my chicken, albeit not spicy in the slightest. Hard to beat the price and portion...half of it came home with me!

Overall, a good choice if you are craving this style Chinese food!"}
{"text":"We ordered in last night from what used to be a fairly decent Chinese restaurant. My wife ordered the shrimps and scallops in garlic sauce which was 4 shrimp and about six bay scallops. Total waste of money and no garlic to speak of. The Singapore Chow Mein Fun had very few noodles. Make sure you ask for crispy noodles when you order soup and then check your bag several times before leaving. They never ever include them in the bag. All in all one of the worst experiences in Henderson for Chinese food"}
{"text":"This food was disgusting it's nothing like it is in New York and they pre cook all their chicken so when you order it they just drop it back into the wok so it is very dry and bad quality in general the sauces they add to the food and I tried all were horrible !!!"}
{"text":"True to their name...happily to review again...probably the only real constant of our food foraging.
Much a staple in our house...with perfectly serviceable and just..really...decent Chinese delivery. We depend on NY Chinese for all our lackadaisical dinner delivery needs. 
Nothing tthat would actually disappoint...
Easy peasy....a true gem...in an abyssal dearth of delivery options. 
PTL..NY Chinese....PTL !"}
{"text":"I've been going to this place since I moved to Henderson from the Bay Area.  Everyone is great and friendly and the food is amazing and cheap.  I'm a field technician and I drive all over town and when I'm in the area, guess what for lunch or dinner NYCR. Their chicken wing is to die for, I always order on kids menu K2 and comes with 6 wings and steam rice and it's perfect!"}
{"text":"This place is incredible. We always order ahead and food is ready or nearly ready when we arrive. Chicken fried rice is some of the best I have had. We always get a meal combo. 2 or 3 items at a reasonable price and can feed the two of us with enough for lunch the next day. Josie likes the won ton soup. Will have me stop if she is under the weather. It's magic. Staff is super friendly. And they remember you when you come back. If your in Henderson you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"I read some of the negative reviews about this place, but I tried it anyways. I called in a takeout order, and was told it would be ready in 30 minutes, it did take a little longer, but the food is the best in town, and the portions are generous!"}
{"text":"Ok, I tried to like this place and was excited with the reviews ...
I hate to say that Panda Express is better and that is BAD!!!!!! 
Ugh! Still searching for a good place in summerlin but I will find it!
We ordered 4 meals to go... Full of fat, dark meat and grease.

We had Mongolian beef, sesame chicken, orange chicken and mushu pork...
The best part of the meal was the white rice...

Sad... Will move on and will never eat here again"}
{"text":"The best carry out Chinese Restaurant in Vegas. I have eaten American style Chinese Food all over the country and this ranks right up there at the top.! Everything I have had was good from the soup to the entrees.
Their combination dinner is absolutely huge and I always have leftovers..just cant eat it all.! It comes with soup, a large eggroll, Rangoon, choice of rice and a huge portion of whatever you order..!! All for about $10. They also deliver but on weekends. It can be as much as an hour because they seem to be very busy.! They also have a small dining room that seats about 30 people. you can usually get a seat.!"}
{"text":"This place has the best Chinese food in our area! I'm not a big Chinese food fan, but I really enjoyed the food and will be coming back again! The fried rice is amazing!"}
{"text":"Ordered Gen Tsao's chicken,  not great, but not bad either.  Won ton soup was good, but the won tons were not, the stuffing didn't taste like anything I've ever tasted before.  Then there was the pork fried rice that was very dark and mushy.  There were lots of pork and veggies in it, but It tasted like someone pissed in it!  I've had NY Chinese before, in New York, and this ain't it...

5 months later, I thought I'd try it again.  Food was MUCH better!  I ordered online and arrived for pickup at the time Eat24 said was \"confirmed\".  It was 40 min after I ordered and they were just starting to cook my order!  Result, I wasted 30 min waiting for them.  Do yourself a favor and have it delivered..."}
{"text":"So much food on the dinner combination! I got the spare ribs... it comes with a choice of rice, a choice of soup, a crab ragoon, and a huge egg roll; all for under $10. I can't even finish my ribs!"}
{"text":"Will never order from here again   Still waiting and order is two hours in. On a wednesday night. Ridiculous"}
{"text":"Super fast delivery, under promise and over deliver, said will be here in 45min to an hour and was here in under 30min, one thing I can say is this place is consistent, food is always good and the lunch special is the best price in town for a fast food Chinese spot, I order from them at least 5 times a month and I can truly say I have never had a bad experience"}
{"text":"Crab Rangoons are on point as are the egg rolls.  Food in general is awesome and staff is very nice."}
{"text":"Eww! I found a pubic hair in my broccoli beef the next day when I heat up it. And I know what is it. And then I called this restaurant, they said: \"that is yours!?\" Ok I can't show u. but I fucking shaved every single time I take shower ok? They were so rude. Be honest food is just ok, not taste good. I'll never come back ever. No need refund, save it and the refund for ur next customer."}
{"text":"Very good food. Reasonable price. Closest thing to Chinese Food from back east including Egg Rolls and proper Wanton Soup"}
{"text":"We love the orange beef here ! They forgot my crab Rangoons last time , but it's okay . I'll get some next time."}
{"text":"Well this used to be our family's favorite chinese restaurant in the city until the spring  of 2014. We have tryed going back after the 1st bad experience 4 more times and we were so disappointed I felt compelled to write this review. I will tell you all the problems that we encountered.
1. Family dinner and there was a hair in our main entree. I noticed none of the cooks were wearing hair nets. I took the plate of food with the hair up to show the manager and told him we cannot eat this and he made us pay for it even after he took the plate and he clearly saw the hair.
2. Decided to try again. This time we were almost done when I cut my mouth from a hard piece of plastic that was in my food. My husband took the dish with the plastic up to the manager again he clearly saw the plastic and again made us pay for our meal.
3. They say the 3rd time is a charm, well not so. Again we found black hair in the entree did the same as always showed the manager the plate with the hair and as always he made us pay for the meal even tho we did not eat the food. We were beyond grossed out by now. Again no hair nets were being worn by the cooks.
4. I guess we don't learn but we decided one more try. We arrived and noticed that the place was empty not one customer in the restaurant. Once we opened the door and walked in we immediately realize why. The place smelled so bad like bad sour pork. It was the most disgusting smell we walked right out.
This place used to be so excellent. Don't know what happened but we will never ever step foot in there again and it really needs to be reported to the health inspectors. So  the moral of this review is stay away. It's not worth getting cut by plastic in your food and grossed out by hair in the food. The owners need to implement hair nets and much better working stations so foreign objects are not in the food they are serving."}
{"text":"This place has been my favorite for over 5 years now, staff is always nice, owner is sweet very hard working, my go to is always the general combination it's like orange chicken and better.

Combination is the way to go, good wonton soup, nice sized egg rolls and the price is perfect.

Wish them many years of success I bring everyone here and they get hooked!"}
{"text":"Best food since I left New York.
Always fresh and hot whether you take out or eat in.
Huge portions reasonably priced.
Management and wait staff are very professional.
Definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"My dad is old school Bronx, so when he tells me he likes some 'New York-style' Chinese place, I try it. Of course, as has been said here about 500 times, this is American Chinese. Fine. 

I walked in and ordered for carry out. The wait was a bit longer than I am used to for Chinese (20-25 min?), but it was also prime time on Friday night and they had lots of people in the restaurant and other pick ups and deliveries. Prices are pretty cheap (under $10 for a huge combo). Everything was really good. That egg drop soup is spot on. My shrimp lo mein was decent and my fried rice was great. Sometimes you cant describe why you like a place, you just do. If I have to pick some grubby, American Chinese place, of all the places I have tried lately in Vegas, this would be it."}
{"text":"The food is GREAT, but delivery service is the WORST!  They are ALWAYS LATE!  They do not give anything free, not even an apology.  I guess I need to go to Panda, or get delivery from people who aren't greedy. and care about their customers.  When I called to let them know they were late, I was rudely interrupted, and hung up on! \"She's on her way, bye bye!\". They got the bye bye right!"}
{"text":"If you want really greasy, typical, fast chinese food...this isn't the place to order from. This place is not your regular chinese restaurant where the take out box is soaked in oil. The food comes fresh and they pack everything to where your food doesn't get soggy from sitting in sauces. So far, I have ordered delivery from here 4 times and I haven't been disappointed. It's so convenient how you can order through the yelp online system as well.
I've ordered multiple things from here and there hasn't been anything I didn't like. I would highly recommend their honey walnut shrimp. The shrimps are huge and they come with fresh steamed broccoli. I'm also obsessed with their spicy string beans. 
But my favorite part about ordering from here is that they offer a small or large portion of mostly everything. When my husband and I eat chinese food we like to eat it family style, so it's great to be able to order a variety of things without overspending.
I would definitely recommend to order from here if you're craving chinese food."}
{"text":"As the name says, it is New York style Chinese Food.  The staff is very consistent and stays the same.  I am a fan of the War Wonton Soup.  Very good and lots of shrimp, chicken and pork."}
{"text":"If you like good basic Chinese food, this place is for you.  Though it does offer dining in, it is basically a take-out joint.  Nothing wrong with that, but just know that there is no (or little) décor and the service is done by the counter person as they have a chance.

The soups are great.  Love the War Wonton.  It is a meal in itself.  The spare ribs are very tasty.  The low miens are good as is the General Tso's chicken.

When we want take out Chinese, this is where I go."}
{"text":"This place is around the corner from our house, so we decided to try some takeout tonight.  It's not the best Chinese I've had, but it satisfied the craving I had for chicken and broccoli and meant we didn't have to cook. For 2 people it was less than $20 and we have leftovers for lunch tomorrow, so that's super cheap in my opinion. Will definitely order from here again...and probably get it delivered so I can be uber-lazy!"}
{"text":"As a East Coast transplant, we literally craved East Coast style Chinese food (there is a difference).

New York Chinese is exactly like it's name. Real Egg Foo Young with brown gravy, Pork Low Mein and fried rice with scrambled egg! Delicious! Now if I can just find fried  chicken wings with hot sauce ketchup! Enjoy East Coaster, this is the closest!"}
{"text":"Try the lunch special. I got a huge soup, crab rangoons and an order of beef low mein  with a side of rice all for 10$. Can't beat that. The egg rolls were the big ones I dont care for, but everything else was awesome as usual."}
{"text":"We order from this restaurant when I'm sick or don't feel like cooking :).

Our faves are usually the orange chicken, house lo mein, and sweet and sour soup."}
{"text":"Some people love this place, but there is absolutely nothing special about it to me. I like their shrimp with lobster sauce but it doesn't strike me as being extra tasty. I have no real complaint about what I've had there, and I've tried several dishes, but nothing is especially memorable."}
{"text":"We decided to try this place after a night of indecisive dinner deciding. Orange chicken, fried rice, egg drop soup, and \"wontons\". The chicken was tangy. The rice was a little dry, but hubby enjoyed. The soup was good. The \"wontons\" were way over cooked and over priced. Not the best choice of add-on. You get a good portion for the price & we want to try their 'Mongolian beef, so we'll be back!"}
{"text":"The food here was excellent. And yes there is a difference in NY Chinese food. My wife who was raised in NY said this was the Chinese food she had when she was a kid. And my favorite thing about this place is the Lunch specials huge portions. Two specials only coast me about 14 bucks, what a deal."}
{"text":"Chinese food is my comfort food.  Some people go for pizza and icecream, but I, I want some fried rice and wonton soup.

I was visiting some friends in Vegas and wanted Chinese food realllly bad.  We decided to order from New York Chinese Restaurant Inc and got:

Chicken Fried Rice
Chicken and Broccoli
Chicken and Mushroom
Shrimp Wonton Soup

I didn't realize all the dishes had chicken.  Anywho, I was super excited because I love Chinese food.  At the same time, I'm also really picky as I've grown up eating amazing food cooked by my madre and was surrounded by what I call Little Taipei (Rowland Heights).

The soup was pretty tasty and had many wontons in it.  My friend commented that it tasted like carrots however there were no carrots in the soup.  Either way, I think that was probably the best dish of the bunch.

The chicken fried rice was a little bland and didn't have any egg even though we requested specifically to have egg in it.  Chicken and mushroom had a great sauce to it, I have to say it was tasty.  As for the chicken and broccoli, I was a little less impressed with that.

All in all, New York Chinese Restaurant Inc. can be a quick fix when you're short on time and money in the city of sin."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food ever.  Try to eat in, the food is freshly  made, hot and wonderful.  Been there at least once a week since we found it.  Having lived in ny for years we were thrilled to find REAL NY. Chinese food"}
{"text":"The fried chicken wings are the BEST in town!  They are JUMBO in size and the texture of the wings are deeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeelicious!  We ordered the Tomato beef -- the tomatoes are on the \"mushy\" side, but the flavor is good!  Can't beat the $1.95 delivery fee!"}
{"text":"This place claims \"no msg,\" which is great. However, they most likely use a lot of soy sauce to compensate, which must be why many of their dishes have a browner sauce or tint. Fried rice is super brown! I'm used to a reddish Szechwan, theirs was brown. Moo shi chicken; way too brown, lacked fried egg, skimpy itsy bitsy chicken pieces, & too many mushrooms. BUT, hot n sour soup & egg drop are good for a hole in the wall take out joint. Shrimp dishes aren't skimpy, big shrimp! Nothing was too salty. I stopped in 5 min before closing just for an egg drop soup & had to wait 10 min; NOT complaining, I watched him make it FRESH! Good to know they're not reusing old soup! On another visit, they gave me a free 2 liter for my order over $30 (I think.) That's a helluva perk! If u live close, go for it. Rice n Noodle on Rainbow was my fav but I moved so this will have to do & I'm ok with that."}
{"text":"I am from NY and while there are many good Chinese Restaurants this is the first that has the only Chinese food that can say it is just like NY.  The wanton soup has just the right seasoning that a lot of places don't have.  The portions are large, their cost low.  Food came out fast and hot.  The only minus is that they have few tables.  They need to expand to a larger location because they will have the client base."}
{"text":"My wife ordered from here and I was excited to come home and get my food as I was pretty hungry. 

I was across town so it took roughly an hour to get home. When I arrived I would have figured the food would have been there but to my surprise the food wasn't. 

Not only did the food take an hour, halfway into our meal my wife finds a short curly hair cooked into her Kung pao shrimp. Yes. Cooked in. 

We called the restaurant hoping to be met with concern for our experience and meal but the person that answered the phone was only interested in knowing if the hair was long or short even going as far as asking if we were sure it was a hair. 

Please do yourself a favor and find another Chinese place in Henderson as this place shouldn't be serving anyone."}
{"text":"Delicious! I stopped in here for my lunch break and they were fast and kind to me. I got the beef and broccoli lunch special. Seriously such a steal! It comes with your entree, rice (I got the pork fried rice, which was excellent!), a crab Rangoon (my fave), and your choice of soup (I picked war wonton!). All of that cost me like $7. Absolutely lovely. Doesn't taste anything like it costed!"}
{"text":"I must say this was by far the best Chinese food my boyfriend and I have had in Las Vegas... We ordered the sweet and sour chicken, Gen Tso chicken and BBQ pork fried rice... It was by far the best food ever!!! The woman on the phone was very nice told me my delivery would arrive in 45 min and it only took like 30... We will definitely be ordering from here again!"}
{"text":"Love this place! We recently moved near this neighborhood. We ordered lunch specials and they delivered under 45 minutes. Food was delicious! Reasonable price and they give you a lot of food."}
{"text":"Maggie always treats us right, you just tell her what you want (if it isn't on the menu or you want to change something out or substitute) and you get it perfect!  This is just the same as real New York Chinese, no panda bears in the place.  The egg fu yung is my husband's favorite.  They make beef with snow peas just like the place that used to be on Times Square.  Awesome food at really great prices.  We love eating here!"}
{"text":"Ok Chinese food.. It's bland .. They have good lunch specials if you like this place.. Just too bland for me .. Only thing I like here are the Singapore noodles .. Other than that it falls short :("}
{"text":"I ordered yelp delivery from this place. We actually really really like it! Their lunch menu comes with soup! It's a great deal for $6.75 and a really good amount of food. It lasted me the whole day but the boys, one sitting lol. We ordered Mongolian Beef with white rice and the guys said it was really good and flavorful! They even wanted to know where I got it from. They also got a side of egg drop soup and finished that as well! I ordered the orange chicken with rice and hot and sour soup! I loved it! It's made with the orange peels and you can see that they coated the chicken with it. Delicious! It's different from your typical Chinese restaurants, I would get it again! Don't expect the Panda Express style orange chicken. It's more tangy and saucy. Hope this helps! Cheers!"}
{"text":"I ordered my food 2 hours ago. The estimated delivery time was a 1 hour wait. I called when it was 10 minutes past the EDT and they said driver was on his way, he'd be here in 5-10 minutes. Okay, fine. Another 15 minutes goes by, I call and ask what is going on. They inform me the driver left 15 minutes ago and was on his way in 10 minutes. So that means in the 40 minutes after the EDT the driver still hadn't left the restaurant until I called and asked that first time. And the restaurant isn't even 15 minutes from my house, so who knows how old my food was. There was no explanation, just awkward silence when I asked why my food isn't here almost 2 hours after I ordered it. No apology, no nothing, just telling me to wait another 10 minutes. Cancelled my order, and never ordering from here again."}
{"text":"I'm super suprised that this place has such mediocre reviews. Their food is fantastic. My husband is from NY and I'm from LA, and for many years we were constantly disappointed by the Chinese food in Vegas. Our favorites: pork egg rolls (big, fat and stuffed with meat as they should be) & BBQ spareribs and BBQ pork fried rice. I want to say I didn't care for their beef and broccoli. We love this place."}
{"text":"The couple times I've ordered food from here, it's been very good. The delivery has always been on time. Couldn't ask for more from a fast-food Chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Reminds me of East coast Chinese restaurants. Excellent customer service. Bathrooms are spotless. I love their shrimp dumplings and war won ton soup. Egg Foo Young is heavenly. Vegetarians and meat lovers can eat here. Highly recommend this place ."}
{"text":"IMO this is the best chinese that I am use to. Love their lunch specials. I work down the road and for lunch at $5.25 you get a soup, crab rangoon, entree, and rice the portions are big so I usually have left over for the next day."}
{"text":"Did not like when changed owners!  Food was not good! Tried again to see maybe off day but again, food was not good and not worth the $$. My opinion 
Just saying!
The dishes were bland, the meat was chewy,  and the fried foods tasted like old oil when cooking?  Definitely not worth my time anymore!"}
{"text":"Never order from again, I had been a good customer for over 2 years. Recently I placed an order I had to give turn by turn directions on how to get to my house cause their driver was an ass. Even though I have ordered from them before for some reason they couldn't figure out how to get to my house.... after an hour and a half the driver calls me and tells me he is lost... WTF? REALLY? And by now my food is about as warm as an Eskimos ass, after fifteen min of going back and fourth with the driver I finally gave up and canceled my order and I was told they won't take my order again cause I canceled.... so I should eat cold food cause their driver doesn't listen to directions or knows how to use google maps.... after I called the main number and told them I see they just don't care, how nice! Would give less then one star if I could"}
{"text":"Pretty disappointed with the food here. All I can say is bland!

I was craving Chinese food, and I couldn't resist the ease of ordering online through yelp and the cheap prices, so I decided to give this place a go. I ordered the black bean chicken and pork fried rice, totaling about $10. Like I said, great prices, but the lack of flavor just isn't worth the price! Black bean chicken is always my go to dish, so I have a lot of places to compare it to, and this is way down on the bottom of my list. There was plenty of sauce covering the chicken and vegetables, but it was completely tasteless! The fried rice wasn't quite as big of a let down as the chicken, but it was still just mediocre. 

If you just want cheap Chinese food, then this place is for you. But if you care even just a little bit about flavor, then I'd go elsewhere."}
{"text":"I ordered last night House Chow Fun. It was terrible and cold. I saw some other reviews were good maybe I just order the wrong dish. Lo Mein and vegetable was okay but not impressed"}
{"text":"The staff is very friendly but this place does far too much volume for the tiny amount of space and staff they have. It's always a mess inside but the good is very good. Tr bathrooms are a bit awkward as they play the music from the hair salon next door- I'm thinking they share cable?"}
{"text":"Thought to try something different and stopes by but it was not good at all won't stop again for sure. I ordered curry chicken with fried rice and wonton soup and the curry is worst I have tried and doesn't have any test the fried rice sucks. Would recommend to go somewhere els than trying here."}
{"text":"This Chinese restaurant is wonderful.
The food is always fresh.
We really love the Crab Ragoon so far it as never been burnt. Just lightly cooked and very appetizing. Fried Shrimp is big not on a stick.
We always get delivery from
# little Dumping# 
But #New York Style Chinese Restaurant is way better.
I usually get the Shrimp & Lobster Sauce their Shrinp &Lobster Sauce has crab meat in it.  # Little Dumpling does not.
My husband will try anything and it is always good.
We tried the Shrimp and Cashew big shrimps and a lot of different kind of vegetables in a brown sauce.
My husband tried their version of sesame chicken and it was very good and it was not dried out.
But it is always better to have more than 2 Chinese Restaurant close by.
Each as their own way."}
{"text":"Slowest  service  ever. If you're looking for  Chinese food  avoid  this  place.  No sense of  urgency and customers  waiting  over 30 minutes  for orders.  Not overly  busy eithier. Got the food  home  and  the  quality is less then panda. The rice was dry and the children  average at best."}
{"text":"The food here is very greasy and if they make an mistake, they treat you like you're lying to them. This has happened more than once. Whatever happened to I'm sorry about that, let me fix it. They think they don't make mistakes and I'm tired of arguing over this with them and I'm not going back EVER."}
{"text":"I order general Tao chicken, wonton soup, pork fried rice and their pork egg roll. It's by far the best Chinese restaurant in town. The egg rolls are big and fat, they have meat in it, not like most Chinese restaurants that stuff it with vegetables and are small and skinny... the general Tao chicken is not too spicy and it's battered / deep fried. I come here all the time. I give it 4 stars. 
Staff is nice and friendly too"}
{"text":"The food is yummy and the service is great. They are little cramped with the furniture but overall it reminds me of a little spot in the east coast."}
{"text":"THE Lunch Special is the best value in town. You get sweet and sour chicken, pork fried rice, and a soup all for 7 dollars. The food is always good every time I had it. Will highly recommend it"}
{"text":"Just moved here 3 months ago. This is the best take out so far! Will continue to order from here. Chicken, rice, veggies, and cream cheese rangoons were all excellent!"}
{"text":"Store front belies grear food inside. Even small entrees are generous. We started with Po-Po platter; lots of delicious bits. Only challenge was they came out bit by bit. Sweet sour pork was fine. Took Pork Fried Rice home for later."}
{"text":"I found 3 pieces of hair in my food and they wouldn't give me the money back then my friend pulls a piece of hair out of her mouth and my mom can and demanded to gets refund and they finally did and they have a little boy working there that sits in the dining and puts on loud music"}
{"text":"We were pleasantly surprised by our meal here. I understand the NYC concept of good food fast with limited seating out front and they nailed it.

We ordered a family meal, two dinner dishes and tried a combined total of about 5 different dishes. The other patrons were staring as the server kept bring plate after plate to our table but we were only sampling and bagging dishes up as the new ones came out so don't know why we were getting weird looks!

The Spicy LoMein was a home run. Perfectly spicy and shrimp were plentiful. The General Tso chicken had good flavor and plenty of Broccoli. The vegetable LoMein was delicious and reminded me of a dish I grew eating. Thanks for that wonderful memory. Had been years since I thought of that dish.

There were a lot of take out orders that night, be sure to not sit in the asile to the counter as you will be getting bumped as people push in past you. Also as the sun sets you will be blinded by it so make sure you aren't in the path of the sunbeam our you will spend half your time their squinting at your dinner partners. 

All in all it was a great experience and we enjoyed leftovers for days."}
{"text":"***CHECK YOUR BAG***if you order carry out!! I didn't check my bag today, because I've never had a problem with my past orders. BUT once I got home (13 miles away) I was quite upset that the Shrimp Lo Mein that I ordered, and PAID FOR was NOT in the bag. I immediately called the restaurant and Aaron attempted to convince me that the order was in my bag. NOT!!! in MY bag I assured him. Asked him to write my name down because I will come back tomorrow or Tuesday to get the food that I already paid for, and then I'm done with that place for good."}
{"text":"fabulous food reasonably priced.  huge menu selection.  we eat their food at least once a week.  yummy!"}
{"text":"The seafood fried rice is very good and actually has scallops in it what a pleasant surprise!
This was a good first entree to have here. Plenty of seafood (shrimp, that fake crab stuff, small scallops & some weird chewy thing that may have been calamari). The rice was decent tasting and service was quick and friendly. The menu is chock full of all the favorites and then some! 

Takeout is served in a paper bag- genius! 
Huge point score just for that. I will be back."}
{"text":"Food is amazing!!!!! Best Chinese takeout available in the Summerlin area. Only awful thing about this place is placing an order. It takes about 10 minutes for the person taking my order to understand that i want kung pao chicken. Haha it's been like that the last 10 times I ordered from them. But i still go back because the food is delicious. I recommend going and placing your order there or else they'll most likely make a couple or errors on your order like they do mine every time."}
{"text":"Great lunch specials! 

NY chinese is located in the Target shopping center at Green Valley Pkwy and Horizon Ridge. They have 26 lunch specials which all come with 3 choices of soup, steamed/fried/brown rice and a crab rangoon. Priced at $6.35-6.75 this is a fantastic deal for lunch.

I chose the shrimp with garlic sauce, fried rice and hot & sour soup. The quality of the food was very good and it wasn't overly salty. There were 5 large shrimp with snow peas, broccoli, water chestnuts, carrots and green peppers. The fried rice and soup were also enjoyable. 

The lunch specials are served from 10:30-4:00 so perfect for those who eat early and those who don't. A very satisfying lunch for under $7!"}
{"text":"We used to eat here years ago and kind of just stoped. But was craving Chinese the other day and figured I'd look them up online. I saw they have Lunch Specials for about $7 and figured I'd order Beef and Broccoli with steamed rice. It came in a lunch size portion which was fine because I wasn't too hungry and it tasted all good! I'll have to come in more often again."}
{"text":"I have always been curious about this place. I have been next door to Expert Tailor a few times, but never stepped in here until last week. The first thing I noticed when I walked in was that there was no menu on the wall. You walk up to the front counter and take one of their menus that are printed on nice paper. Just thought that was weird, I mean the least they could do was laminate a few of the menus so it would be easier for customers to look at.

I decided to order the Sweet Sour Chicken Lunch Special, which came with

-Egg Drop Soup: thick and pretty bland. I have definitely tasted better. Next time I will try the Wonton or Hot and Sour soup.
-Crab Rangoon: it tasted like 98% cream cheese. It was like eating a big spoonful of it with no crab whatsoever.
-Sweet and Sour Chicken: pretty good because it was lightly battered, which was nice, and the sauce was tasty.

They did not charge extra for brown rice, portions were big and the price was very reasonable for all that food. I took my order to go and did not have to wait very long. The cashier who took my order wasn't very nice. He kind of just stared at me, not saying anything and waiting for me to give him my order. However, the employee who brought me my order when it was ready was friendly. He actually thanked me and said \"have a good day.\"

I would definitely like to come back and try other items on their menu. Hopefully it will be better the next time around.

Located between Little Caesars and Expert Tailor."}
{"text":"I really don't know where all these crappy reviews are coming from.  We had a great meal with great service.  The food was very fresh, hot and flavorful.  The portions were generous and the value was great.  We had family dinner B for 2, came with egg rolls, fried shrimp, and cream cheese wontons( I didn't eat that or the shrimp).  The egg roll was vegetarian and very good.  We also got won ton soup with the meal.  We had cashew chicken, shrimp lo mien, house special fried rice and a separate order of orange chicken.  We enjoyed all the food and we had a lot leftover.  Total 5 star food in my book."}
{"text":"I don't know why this place doesn't have more 4 and 5 star reviews.  The food is awesome.  I live in Socal and always make it a point to eat here when I'm in town.  The food is made fresh and the price is right.  This was my first time at this location and it was as good as the other location( in Henderson).   My wife and I each chose a dinner combo.  It comes with soup( we got won ton, very flavorful broth), egg roll, rangoon( skipped), rice( brown, white or pork fried) and an entree.  I wanted Moo Goo Gai pan.  It was not an option, but the server said \" No problem).  My wife ordered orange chicken made with white meat( 1.00 extra).  The food was hot and fresh and I had plenty for lunch the next day."}
{"text":"So disappointed after everyone saying how great this place was and to try it out! So... I know what authentic NY Chinese Food should taste like having grown up there and this wasn't it... not even close!

I ordered several items off the menu and they were all equally terrible! No flavor extremely bland and small portions for what you pay. They are pricey just like NY but they don't serve as much and it's not worth the money. The food tasted stale it was weird and the chicken and beef tasted old also. 

Oh and the place charged me 2 dollars extra for delivery for a total of $4.00 saying I was out of their area, when I was only 0.3 miles out of it, and the guy showed up on a scooter.... WOW!!!!!
That thing doesn't even burn an ounce of gas... I couldn't believe that part.

Save your money.... Lesson learned I will continue to keep making my homemade chinese which never disappoints. There are some great recipes online.

What a waste of $47.00........"}
{"text":"Closest thing to NYC style Chinese. My go to spot close to my home."}
