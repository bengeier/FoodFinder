{"text":"I am going to be specific the shift I am critiquing is the night shift. The food is as bad as a cafeteria can make. There is never a clean table in the dining room. Everything that is supposed to be hot is cold the salad bar is pathetic. We can't leave the property so this is the only place to eat unless you bring your own from home. I recommend bringing your own instead of eating here on the 3rd shift. Several of the worst meals I have ever had have been here. If you are lucky they didn't try to give a hot food selection for the night."}
{"text":"Copa burgers always on point.  Chicken fingers are solid when fresh. Shoutout to my boy Ernie on the night shift who always goes the extra mile to be awesome and do the best he can with what he's given."}
{"text":"I have given up hope of having a cafeteria that I would be willing to buy food from at work. It wasn't too bad 20 years ago, but it has steadily gone downhill over the past 10 years. Too many budget cuts and bringing in an outside company to run has been a horrible decision with yucky results. I agree with Robert..just bring your own food if you happen to be here for the night shift. Then you will know that it will something that you can eat."}
{"text":"If you find yourself in this side of the Colorado River, I highly recommend stopping by to visit the Twisted Fork. As a treasured relic shared by many Phoenicians and a place where culture fuses with food, the Twisted Fork serves as a the epitome of all-American cafeteria food with influences of regional dishes.

While there may be naysayers abound, I can always depend on TF to deliver a meal fit for any dietary restriction. 

Sodium-restricted? So-what, they have oatmeal, baked Mahi-Mahi, steamed veggies.

Diabetic diet? Do not dispair! Diet fountain drinks, teriyaki tofu, and of course the salad bar. (Easy on the dressing there, cowboy!)

Cardiac, gluten-free, paleo...they have it all. They even cater to the see-food diet.

As I recollect on my gustatory experiences at The Twisted Fork, two local favorites come to mind: 1) anything fried and 2) Chili Fridays. Seriously, these chefs have mastered the craft of cooking with veggie oil. With the exception of a few items you can bet your meal will be delicious and your stomach satisfied! Now, as for the hili on Fridays...you will just have to come and try it. It's hearty, full of flavor and warms the soul when you're stuck in colder weather!

On most days, this is my go-to place for breakfast and lunch (and sometimes dinner) and for  a many good reasons not least of which decent food, friendly staff, and great salsa packets. Don't pass up on this hidden gem! 

Yours truly!"}
