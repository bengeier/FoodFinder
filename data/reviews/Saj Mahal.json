{"text":"Done right!  Atmosphere: So what makes reviewers credible? for one - their experience ... just so happens I've got a little extra for this review seeing as to how Mum & Dad are Lebanese :) and therefore by extension so am I.  The atmosphere here is absolutely Lebanese - spot on - from the Fairuz music in the background, to the way the goods are presented ... it's simple, it's homely, it is very casual authentic and doesn't try to be more than what it is - just a place to get a damn good Man'ouche :)  Food: Hands down - the best of the rest.  You have your al Taib's and Arouch etc. - but this place makes the tastiest Mana'eesh (plural for Man'ouche) ... and not just that - they've got more than 2 dozen different toppings. Soujouk? check! Cheese? Check! Labneh (sour yogurt) double check! all here and more!  They use Saj bread which is thinner than the regular pita - so for those looking to watch their intake of carbs this is good, however given how good thier food is - you cannot have just one! (I dare you to try!)  best for breakfast (that's how the Lebanese have it) or for a mid-day snack / lunch.  Service: Counter servie - and on busy days some table service.  The owner and his wife are there most of the time - him cooking and her serving - again very Lebanese of them.  Kind, curious, and very efficient - I appreciated their work (I didn't tell them that I was a Yelper or that I was Lebanese!)   a very good place to have! Must visit again (and again)  W"}
{"text":"Staff is friendly, however food is not good, I ordered Tawook but what i got wasn't even a grilled chicken ... wasn't able to match what i ordered to what i eat. also, the chicken pieces was not fresh."}
{"text":"Great place for a delicious bite! The proprietor was super friendly and helpful with choosing items from the menu. The menu was large without being overwhelming. The food was delicious! We will definitely be eating here again."}
{"text":"Food was great. Prices were awesome. Had lots of fun trying a pile of different things with our group of   7. Could have just been the dude working that eve but the music was eclectic and fun"}
{"text":"The taste is great! One of the best Saj places in town, although it does not have the best location and it's not the love-at-first sight from outside place, but if you want good dough and taste then you are at the right place. Close to the Metro and St-Catherine.  Service is good! Prices are reasonable and the overall experience is excellent! Worth trying and worth coming back to."}
{"text":"For the most part, I've never found myself craving Lebanese food, at least not the kind found in the city. Sure, a late night shish would be nice once in a while, but I was never taken in to the flavour profiles, especially when 90% of what's out there is your usual falafel joint. At least Basha on Ste-Catherine has a substantial salad bar.  So what makes Saj so exceptional? - Fresh saj flatbread, which is thin and crispy, making it the ideal vehicle for pizzas and sandwiches. It's hard to go back to the thick, spongy pita you find everywhere else afterwards. - Fresh toppings and ingredients. You won't find any dried out spits sitting roasting all day. - Open every night till 3-4am. - Incredibly cheap. Even when I'm starving, eating 3 by myself is pushing it. 2 will do for most."}
{"text":"Bird Portions! the food is ok nothing great but for the price the amount served is enough to keep a bird happy! if you're starving or on a budget don't come here but if you are interested in trying some authentic Lebanese dishes it's a decent place + they have hookah"}
{"text":"Haven't had proper Saj in a long time!  The service is really good, the food is fresh, the Saj are so good my boyfriend and I had four different kinds!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Their saj are perfect for sharing. I suggest going with a friend and trying out different kinds of saj. I also recommend the sultana kibbeh, it's delicious."}
{"text":"Just off a busy downtown street, and down a few steps you are transported into the little Casbah of a Lebanese restaurant called Saj Mahal.   Immediately, the smell of spices hits you, then the feel of the terracotta tiles, Arabic style music playing in the background and finally your taste buds are loving the fresh, smooth silky hummus. Better yet the hummus is being scooped into your mouth with warm triangular Saj (pita like) bread. Quite a delightful light lunch then punctuated with a side of green olives and sliced tomatoes.   Tables are centered with about a dozen spices, yours for the shaking - onto your food that is. I think I dabbled with all of them just for fun, even if they aren't normally sprinkled on hummus. I would suggest that they label them, since the smell test can yield varying results unless you have an expert nose/taste palate.   I'll have to come back to try a proper breakfast, lunch and dinner Saj. Ah and of course the regional desserts offered. I believe I saw a photo of Kanafeh (sweet cheese pastry/dessert). There are also a bunch of specialty pantry items to take home too."}
{"text":"Probably the worst shawarma I've had (under-seasoned meat, no tahini), the worst pizza (sloppy, hyper salty, and unmelted cheese) I've had, and the most terrible kunafe. The delivery person wasn't even holding the food upright (pizza was sideways). Lastly, they changed my order (pepperoni instead of chicken on the pizza!) and didn't even let us know, and still expected us to pay. Also, everything had sesame seeds (even the pizza).   Lastly, the bread is this, very thin. This is great for when it comes out of the oven fresh and hot, but when it cools it becomes brittle, like crackers. On pizza (in my delivery) it was sloppiness on a thin layer of mushy stuff....pretty bleh!  Sure, it's all cheap, and the guy in the phone was nice, but if I spend $20 on food that's not my order (and nauseating to look at), which I cannot eat, then that's $20 down the drain, and shows absolutely atrocious service. Not a recommendation."}
{"text":"Yelp tells me I've never reviewed SAJ. Shame on me! I love this place... And I keep coming and trying one of the many different options of the Lebanese pizzas.   Prices gone up since when I've come for the first time, but it's still student affordable, if you know what I mean! ;)  BTW... No credit. Cash or interact only."}
{"text":"i came here with my lebanese friends and had an incredible brunch! according to them, it is quite authentic! to me, the food was yummy and flavorful and the environment was very relaxing! perfect for sharing and definitely going to try it again sometime in the future!"}
