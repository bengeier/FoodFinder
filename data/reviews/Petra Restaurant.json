{"text":"I would give this place a better review but the service was extremely slow. We asked 7 different people for pita bread to go with our appetizers. It easily took over half an hour for that. Unfortunately the service completely overshadowed our experience and it didn't really matter how good the food was as we lost our appetite. We had to wait a long time to get our main dishes as well.   Maybe wait until they hire more staff or go on a night that is less busy. I would check if they are having an event in the banquet room before you go.   We had a reservation and our total experience was about 3 hours. The food was good though. Everyone liked what they ate although they did forget part of our order which of course they tried to charge us for but I had it reversed. All of the patrons were experiencing similar issues.   If I were running the place I would have given folks a discount or offered them a rebate on their next meal. Unfortunately, they didn't do either. It took me over 20 minutes to get the bill. I eventually got up and threatened to leave unless they gave it to me."}
{"text":"You can see by my attached bill we spent $241.58 here. We told our waitress to bring our fries with the apps because they were for the kids. The fries came out after we got the apps finished them and after we got our main meals.   The management in house is rude. The men in suits walk around like they own the place and are absolutely no help.   Service is extremely slow. Takes about an hour and a half to get your food. They bring your apps and don't give u bread. Then when they bring the bread they bring 2 pieces for a table of 9. We had to ask for glasses multiple times. They brought the 1L water bottles but no glasses. The waitress was asked for hot sauce. Forget it, because she sure did.   I swear I'm not sure what's going on at this place but the service staff is so slow and forgetful. Horrible and unacceptable. They pretty much hide in the kitchen the whole time. Won't return."}
{"text":"One of the worst experiences ever; Firstly  the food was so so so bad ,   the meat (the mixed grill plate) was  something that could not be eaten so bad and you pay about 30$ for this small plate and then you can't even eat it, the chicken and shawarma were better but they are also not that Good . Secondly the prices are expensive , by this prices I could have tried a much better place. The service were average like any fast food place so no need to pay that much and you also need to wait for long time to get your plate.  The atmosphere isn't that special as it looks to be . Eventually I cannot find any good side in that experience and I don't advise anyone to try it unless they corrected there situation ."}
{"text":"Nice decor but absolutely horrible service and bland food. The prices are a little steep too which is fine if everything else was on point but this was not the case."}
{"text":"The only star this place deserves is for the cute decor. Service is terrible (slow, waiters and managers not welcoming or courteous). Halloumi salad was too salty and had only 2 thin slices of cheese. Grilled fish and fish tagine were unseasoned and fish tasted not fresh. Rice was confusing-not seasoned and greasy. Also, they charged $5 for water. I really had high hopes for this restaurant, but came out very disappointed :("}
{"text":"One of the worst dinning experiences in recent memory. The overall setup is very nice. There was considerable investment in the decor and the overall theme. And sadly that is the only positive thing. The food is sub par at best. The pictures on the menu do not match the actual entre.   Service is completely non existent. The owner seems nice, but doesn't seem to have any experience in restaurant management and instead just runs around the servers.   Advice to management: focus on the service and overall food quality. You have a good shell of restaurant, but look/feel are only a small element of an overall dinning experience."}
{"text":"Food is terribly overpriced and was charged 5$ for water.  Service was terrible, food came out slow and took the waitress 45 mins to get us the bill even there were no other customers in the restaurant at the time."}
{"text":"Went on a Monday night, after meeting with someone in the area and they recommended this new place. The decor is very prettt, it feels like a restaurant you'll find in Dubai. The waiting area is furnished like a Arabian desert camp, and the dining area has palm trees and water fountains! It was a quiet evening but the food was delicious. We had the hummus beiruti, these little sausages and mansaf (their special that night - traditional Jordanian dish: fall off the bone lamb on rice served with yogurt). It was so good! It was the best middle eastern meal we've had in Toronto"}
{"text":"Worst. Service. Ever. Stay away from this place at all costs!!!!!!!!! We waited over an hour for our main dishes to come out. Mediocre food also not worth it. Unacceptable."}
{"text":"This place is just sad.. apart from the nice interiors everything else is below any acceptable quality standards. Ordered the mix grill and mix shawarma plate, it was a disappointment and I fail to understand how one is able to disappoint with these two very easy and uncomplicated dishes.. the appetizers were equally bad (Sojjok, mutabal and fatoush) the staff are not flexible with separate check..  our table was left uncleared for 45 minutes, they only cleared the plates and table when we specifically asked them too and no the restaurant was not busy.. Their konafa is underwhelming and it's not made fresh. I do not recommend this place at all will not give it a second chance because there was no glimmer of flavor in any dish."}
{"text":"I highly recommand Petra Restaurant. By far the best and most authentic Middle Eastern restaurant in the GTA."}
{"text":"The worst customer experience ever .. the waiter who is responssible for the shisha is rude and has attitude .. will never go to it again."}
{"text":"Avery successful Ramadan open buffet for a high-quality taste of middle eastern food.    Well, I should do this review earlier but I decided to wait for Ramadan buffet and they earned my 5 stars.   Service was absolutely excellent and atmosphere.  Quality of food ( the taste of Palestinian Hummas and Mutable ) lentil soup is wonderful and perfectly done!  Beets and fatoosh salads were my favorite Mansaf, mufatah, magloobeh and muskan roll all were amazing in taste.   If you like this type of food try  Ramadan buffet for 40 dollars only!!! some ppl may find that pricy but compare to the quality they nail it!"}
{"text":"Very nicely decorated. I ordered the mix grill which was disappointing. My wife had a fried fish which she liked. The appetizers some good and some aren't. Seems like their menu is hit or miss on a lot of items. They need consistency in making every dish they offer worth ordering. The service is very slow. The waiters don't check on you to see if you need anything else. Had to get up myself to go find condiments and extra utensils. The prices are a little steep so it won't be a place you would attend frequently. My bill for a couple of appetizers/soft drinks, and those dishes I mentioned above was about $90. I hope they improve their food quality and reconsider their pricing. Would probably give it another try but in a few months to see if changes happened."}
{"text":"Finally real food full with flavours and cooked to perfection, tasty traditional Arabic Mediterranean food. Friendly hospitality. You can see that the decoration is well spent on. Try the Golden Kebab and you must try the Knafe."}
{"text":"My husband and I dined at Petra a few days ago and when I think about my overall dining experience there, I feel that this place deserved a solid 3 stars.   What Petra has going for it:  -An inviting desert themed entrance with a large tent sent up that was decorated with bright pillows on the seats -Beautiful decor that really makes diners feel like they've been transported to the Mediterranean (large palm trees, canopy of leaves above, small waterfall area, nice wooden tables with cute benches and chairs) -Large selection of tapas style appetizers and mains -Some reasonably priced food such as appetizers for $12 or under -Plenty of free parking in the plaza   Room for improvement:  -The dishes that we ordered were filling BUT could be improved in flavour. We felt that they tasted okay but were not memorable in flavour, which was disappointing. We ordered the garlic labneh (yogurt dip), soujak (fried sausages with tomatoes) and the Petra mix grill plate (1 beef kebab, 1 chicken kebab, 1 meat kebab). -Service was inconsistent depending on the staff member as some were more friendly than others and actually looked like they wanted to be there. Then again, it was hard to track down a server at times considering that the restaurant was only half occupied. -Staff should check on the washrooms more often as only 1 of the 5 stalls actually had toilet paper.  Overall, I wish that I could give this place a higher rating. I truly appreciated how beautifully decorated the restaurant was, the ambiance was nice and I can tell that a lot of thought went into creating such an exotic setting for customers. When it comes down to it though, the taste of the dishes is what would make me come back to a restaurant and this place didn't knock it out of the park for me. I'm hoping that since this place just recently opened, it's just going through growing pains and continuing to improve on flavours of their dishes. I might be open to trying this place again in the future but I would wait a while."}
{"text":"Don't do it!! The crappy food and incredibly slow service is not worth it ! You will be waiting for more than an hour for your main dishes to arrive. And don't bother making a reservation, since they don't even honor the reservation time.   Place not run properly. Avoid."}
{"text":"Im going to go all Gordon Ramsey on this restaurant, The decor does not blend in with the prices of the dishes and the taste, YOU NEED TO TASTE THE FOOD before serving it, everything we ordered was bad looking left and right no one was satisfied, when serving something to a table and asking for the same thing I don't expect something different, I asked for fresh bread I got old flat bread. The keba was bad, chicken with mushrooms bland, the salad is supposed to be fresh why is it cold it seems like they did it ahead of time and stuck it in the fridge, the Jordanian potato taste nothing like the potatoes back home, and the prices WAY TO EXPENSIVE, I get the decor says it all but the food should too, id rather go to another restaurant with modern decor same prices but when leaving I feel satisfied"}
{"text":"My family and I went on eid day. I could say worst service ever. We had reserved 17 seats we were only provided us with 13. We didn't get glasses and water except when we asked multiple times.  Not enough bread. Not enough employees. Bad management. It was a complete mess. We waited 1.5 hours for our food to come. They missed one of our orders and said that it'll take them another hour if we need to re order it. We weren't satisfied with the food quality. Definitely not worth it and won't be recommending it to friends and family. There are other middle eastern food options. If you want Petra you are only going for the nice interior not food! Save your cash Not worth it!!!!"}
