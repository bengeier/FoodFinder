{"text":"This place is a Mississauga GEM.  I have friends that drive from far places just to have rotis and doubles from Leela's. The goat curry roti is the best and i have never had a dish here i have not fallen in love with. The servings are huge amd the prices are good.  The best part of it all is the warm and friendly service that comes with your order!"}
{"text":"Not a robot, just an avid fan of the food. Everything is flavourful and it's consistent. The owners are from T&T, everyone knows they make the best rotis.  I recommend to all my island friends with no complaints, so far."}
{"text":"Coming from a Trini family I know my roti & doubles very well. Leela's also being very close to me means I am here frequently. I can say the doubles are very decent in terms of offerings within the GTA. Up to the standards in Trinidad? Not quite. Ask for slight pepper. \"Slight is just right\". Leela's tends to dab the pepper sauce in one spot in roti & doubles so you'll be eating with no pepper half way through usually. As for the aloo-pie it is pretty good as well as the pholourie. They have roti specials on Tuesdays and Wednesdays as well as other specials during the week (try the veggie platter). The roti however usually is not filled with a lot of meat at times and can be a little dry. The wait times always can be frustrating. I've had to wait very long for an order that was placed over the phone for two roti shells - many times I've experienced this. However in the area it is placed it is the only West Indian option worth visiting."}
{"text":"Diarrhea & Extremely Upset Stomach.... I am serious. Both my wife and I. I've been to Leela's for lunch before on my own without issue. This was Saturday night, 7- 8pm or so. They looked like they were preparing for shutdown soon, vacuum was brought out, a good sweep was being done in the dining area. Still taking orders and a few people were seated. My wife had the Chicken and I the Goat Roti. My wife's looked strange as the Roti was wrapped really loose, the cornmeal inside seamed excessive although it all tasted normal. 2 hours later her stomach started. Mine shortly after hers. All Sunday confined to the home with multiple trips to the toilet thanks to the diarrhea. I often eat many spicy foods, with curry as well, no allergy here, ever before. Bad food poisoning, period. We may have got the bottom of the pot seeing it was late. Whatever the case, poor cleanliness or old food late in the day, it's no excuse. If you are serving food, you better make sure it's clean and handled appropriately. Thanks for giving us the loose stools Leela. Here I am Monday, two days later and still feeling the unsettling in my stomach, on the road to recovery though. Never Again Leela's !!!"}
{"text":"Great tasting food. Everything that comes out of the kitchen is fresh. Had the chance to try one of their doubles and a boneless goat roti. Top notch!! I would put it at one of the top 5 places for roti; and some of those places are located in Jamaica!! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I am shocked this place gets such a good reviews - perhaps because there is not many options in this area.    Doubles and pholouries are way too greasy.  They try to nickel and dime you for every little thing.  The roti's skin is decent but the filling is bland or overwhelmed with a favourless hot sauce.  My sister got sick after having the jerk chicken special - which I tasted and is one of the worst takes on jerk chicken.  And on top of the mediocre food, the service is horrible especially from one of the females who works there. She's rude, unprofessional and has no manners.  Perhaps she needs to do everyone a favour and stay in the kitchen behind closed doors where she can clean and flavour the food better so customers do not have to deal with her presence."}
{"text":"first time having roti so can't really compare it to anything else. place had few chairs and tables but it was mostly a take out place... went there on a friday night and the there was always a line up of people getting take out! the service was fast and friendly as well, which is always a plus. got the boneless chicken and their regular size roti is huge! will be going back to try their goat roti and some more doubles :)"}
{"text":"Very delicious and tasty  great service so I go there Regularly. Highly recommended Indo Caribbean foods with a touch of the other Caribbean isles."}
{"text":"I've been to this place many times and is still the best place in mississauga to get Roti and pholourie. It is always fresh and hot when I get it. The pholourie comes with a tamarind sauce which is used for dipping. It adds an excellent touch to the pholourie. It has a bit of a sweet and sour taste which makes the pholourie taste perfect. The staff as well is very friendly. Great Caribbean restaurant for mississauga!"}
{"text":"I also swing by for the Tues and Wed. specials.  Nice flavors, generous portions, and super friendly staff.  I love the rotis, but the doubles I find a bit greasy.  Also,  beware the lineup, or prepare to practice your dance moves while waiting because the tunes are so catchy.   Also, the Veggie platter is YUM, full of flavor and variety"}
{"text":"I've been coming to Leela's for about a year now. It is now a part of my work week lunch rotation. Great food and value as well. I've tried a number of items on the menu and have not regretted a single one. According to my co-worker, even the veggie platter is good. My usual is the boneless jerk chicken with rice and beans. Occasionally I get a double. It's really hard to pass up on the doubles!"}
{"text":"My uncle told me about this place months ago. I used to go to a shop on dundas and hurontario and that was once or twice a month. I finally tried Leela's. Now i'm there at least once a week! Try the chicken pies as well as the doubles with meat. Inexpensive and better than any tuesday specials out"}
{"text":"Polite service. I like the specials they offer and the doubles are great! This is the \"go to\" roti shop for my husband and I in Mississauga."}
{"text":"Roti is EXCELLENT here.  And the specials are fantastic.  Tuesday specials are $3 rotis - boneless chicken (dark meat), bone chicken (white meat), bone goat, etc. Wednesdays are $3 chicken munch - boneless chicken (dark meat) wrapped in a thin paratha.  I have been going here since it first opened.  At first, the roti was a little dry and they didn't put enough gravy in it.  I was ready to write it off, until friends told me how great it was, so I gave it another try.  So glad that I did.  Now, they have perfected their food.  The roti and paratha are consistently fabulous, never dry, nice amount of gravy and the curry chicken or goat is very tasty.  Now I come here every week for takeout special roti or chicken munch.  It is very consistent now.    Go here for the great food and the value.  Don't go for the service or the atmosphere.  I'm glad that I don't have to drive all the way downtown for Island Foods (my other favourite) every time I have a roti craving."}
{"text":"Outstanding customer service and food! On Saturdays they close at 9pm. We called and placed an order for our roties at 8:50pm and got there at 10 past 9. They waited for us and served us happily. I felt so welcomed that I wouldn't have cared if the roti sucked at that point. But It did not suck either! On the contrary for $9 after taxes the roti you get is gigantic and delicious, I must mention though, we were pretty hungry. I had the boneless chicken one, which had huge chunks of chicken breast in it. I am looking forward to my next visit :)"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing! Had the veggie platter and I literally couldn't stop eating. I can't move now! Great food! A must have!"}
{"text":"This restaurant needs to be more generous with their serving portions. Don't think about buying the Macaroni pie, you get 1\" by 1\" pieces. Bought a Roti got only three small pieces of chicken and to make it worse they were all bones!!!!!"}
{"text":"Really nice people, quick service (although this place tends to be busy)  Pretty solid menu, most any Trinidadian dish you can think of they have at a reasonable price.   Veggie platter is great, doubles are good, roti is perfect.   Best Trini cuisine I've had that wasn't home cooked (from a Trinidadian)."}
{"text":"This place is ok. Flavour is nice but they made a mistake with order,giving chicken instead of lamb. I ordered the duck and i find half the meat is duck  (with bone )and the rest is goat. I think they should be honest and stop mixing the meat up."}
{"text":"Delicious lamb rotis. I went twice this week. I only wish there was some close to home."}
{"text":"This is the spot for roti and doubles in Mississauga.   Problem is I'm starting to get more potato in my roti and less meat.    The roti is made well and the service is quick.    They don't take credit"}
{"text":"This is a place that I only accidentally found through Yelp itself.  No one I know had ever heard of it, but they have now.  The jerk chicken is what I constantly get every trip there.  Its hot, but its a quality heat.  Absolute delicious every time I've been there.  Had chicken curry in the past, and while it was well done, I end up constantly coming back to the jerk chicken.  Yet to have a bad meal there, after 10+ trips."}
{"text":"Excellent Service and fantastic doubles, choka, roti etc..  Service with a smile and consistent quality for the past few years."}
{"text":"One star add I am beging to like this place more . Great deals on lunch a d perfect spice . Great serive . I might give them full stars by the end of the year I have try more food ."}
{"text":"The doubles  are  awesome    ask for  mild  so you  can  enjoy the  flavour and  not  kill  your  taste buds"}
{"text":"Amazing Boneless Jerk, Food does take some time to come out but absolutely worth it. Also the Tues Roti deal is a very good option for lunch!"}
{"text":"i must say Quick service n staff is so nice .Today i visit there in the early morning at 9:15am and had alloo pies to go,it was so delicious tht i ate it voraciously.Veggie platter is also so gud i love their service n their food .i usually go their once in a week or wenever i get tym . Best indian food ."}
{"text":"Whenever I have that special craving, this is my \"go to\". Beautiful food, beautiful people, always fresh and satisfying. Always there for a boneless chicken roti, doubles (both with and without meat) and of course I MUST end my meals with a coconut water and a bag or 2 of kurma! Thanks Leela's ... Oh ya!! BEST DOUBLES IN THE GTA!"}
{"text":"I went to check out this place after I saw it said halal on yelp.   I went around dinner time to do a takeout and the place was decently busy. The owner at the till was very friendly and helpful in taking the order and informing us about their product and spice levels.   Once you check in on yelp there is offer of doubles for free with your order. Although the offer was done but the owner gave it us. The restaurant itself was clean and the seating arrangement was nice.  I ordered the chicken roti, Jerk chicken dinner and the free double. The roti was nice and filled up properly and the jerk chicken was ok as I have had better spiced up jerk chicken but the portion was very good it came with rice and coleslaw. The doubles was roti filled with chickpeas. People beware for the spice level mild is medium and medium is hot and I found it the hard way.  On the halal note - They have a sign on their door, plus I inquired the owner and he stated that he buys halal meat."}
{"text":"Still the same rating, even though the food is quickly growing on me! (I think you'll understand why in a sec.)  My family decided to order takeout today, and were intrigued by the side orders whereby you can order by 8oz., 12oz., or 20oz. We thought that this was perfect, and a great value - we'd be getting almost a pound of meat for only $7 to $8!  However, when we went to get our order, we were massively disappointed. It turns out that the 8oz wasn't by weight (which was what we thought the reasonable person would expect), but by volume. For what we paid, we received only 2 tiny containers of food!  Despite all this criticism, the food was tasty, rich, and delicious. My favourite is without doubt the goat, but it turns out the duck is really good as well! All are fall off the bone tender."}
{"text":"Ask the lady for recommendations.  This place is absolutely awesome for carribean food."}
{"text":"We ordered for takeout:  - Boneless goat roti (dhalpoori, meat separated as requested). Goat curry was a tad bit salty, but absolutely delicious. Dhalpoori was huge and fluffy.  - Boneless chicken roti (paratha, meat separated as requested). Chicken curry was perfectly done: Big portion. Paratha was good too.  - Double, medium spice level: Mango chutney added for spice. Excellent.  - Double, mild spice level. Very good.  - Jerk chicken with rice and peas. This meal was quite spicy/hot, yet delicious. Not recommended for those who can't handle spice.  The Doubles shells were a bit soggy, due to them being wrapped for takeout, but still delicious. The lady (owner/cashier, I presume) was courteous, informative and flexible. I highly recommend this restaurant for those looking for a good Trinidadian/ West Indian meal in Mississauga."}
{"text":"Top tier Trini food with substantial vegan options aiming strait for your ultimate satiety. Full stars as soon as I can Apple Pay my veggie platters (no tap)"}
{"text":"I really enjoy the food. It is a quick wait and the food is delicious. The only thing bad is they rose the Wednesday special to 4 dollars"}
{"text":"Just had my first taste of one of Leela's Rotis and I have to say that it was the best chicken roti I have ever had, and my family is Jamaican so I've had my share. Wow. I should mention I'm a very finnicky eater (sorry Mom), and one of the best things about this roti is how there was absolutely nothing about it to put me off, the chicken was perfectly groomed, no gristle, nothing, just clean deliciousness in beautiful curry sauce wrapped in a roti that really hung together, and not too dry either. Love it. I can't wait to try the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"Come here for authentic delicious Trini food! I tried the curry duck, stewed chicken, doubles and aloo pie. All amazing! Can't wait to return."}
{"text":"Wonderful Caribbean food in Mississauga. Rotis, Chicken Curry/Jerk, Doubles, Goat are very good. Will spice to taste. Friendly service."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times now.   I normally have the boneless goat in roti. It tastes great.   The server is very pleasant."}
{"text":"Quick Review:  I have been to this place few times, and the food is decent, it wont blow out of the water but it is clean and good food  So here is list of items that I had tried so far  Jerk chicken = 3/5 Goat Roti =3.5/5  Curry fish on rice=3/5 Curry Shrimp and daal on Rice =4/5 Chicken stew =4/5 Boneless Chicken Roti=4/5 hope this helps  PS. their hot sauce is really hot so be careful if you have a mild palate   Thank you for reading"}
{"text":"I moved here almost 4 years ago and always miss my mum's cooking (Fijian cuisine). This place is a fantastic! Literally tastes just like my mums food. I had never had Trini food before, but I have to say, it tastes just like Fijian cuisine. Absolutely loved the flavors and the rotis, omg, just like mum's!  Our usual favorites include doubles, Trini fried rice, potato and channa roti, and the chicken roti. All fantastic and delish!  The service is always great and welcoming. Tuesday specials are the ish! Best time to go, just make sure to call ahead if you're planning to do takeout!"}
{"text":"I like popping in here to grab some doubles on the go to snack on whenever I'm in the area to see my chiropractor. However my last visit left me a little upset. I ordered the shrimp lunch special.. i got 3 pieces of tiny shrimp. The curry taste was nice but I felt ripped off.. that was some overpriced rice.. i won't make the mistake of ordering that again."}
{"text":"Really liked this place. $5 for the lunch special jerk chicken roti Tue-Fri. Great value. There's quite of bit of chicken in the roti and its spicy & delicious. Its quite substantial too.   There were some other specials (not as good as the $5 one, but still good), as well as a regular menu. A lot of the potential things to order.   My yelp app was showing a check in deal for a free Double. Apparently this offer has ended, but the owner honored it.   Ample parking. Accepts debit (not credit). Friendly staff. Will be back next time I'm in the area"}
{"text":"I have been to almost every roti shop in the West end and this is the best one that sells both roti and doubles.  They are very consistent when it comes to serving your food hot, fresh and spicy.  I went there today and ordered a doubles ($1.25) and a mini boneless chicken roti ($3 Wednesday special).  That's less than $5 with tax!  They are also super friendly.  It can get very busy at lunch so call ahead if possible."}
{"text":"After reading all the amazing reviews I decided to stop by on a Wednesday to try their roti special. At 3pm the place was still wow busy and there was an order line! I got a boneless chicken roti and two doubles to go (chicken and goat).   The doubles were delicious! The meat added some different flavors to them though I'm sure plain they would've been just as awesome. The pastry texture was lovely and held up well during the car ride home. The sauce is great too though I only got one for my two doubles to share.   The roti was filling - absolutely massive for me and no way I could finish in my own (especially after two doubles!) The one thing I didn't like was that there was a high roti to filing ratio. At times I was just eating mouthfuls of roti because I was low on filling.   Staff is friendly and fast, would creatinine so by to pick up more doubles if I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"went there for lunch, first time for me, ordered typical boneless curry chicken roti (regular size), and a double. The roti was big and very delicious, no disappointment! barely finished it. Double was very tasty too, will come back order other dishes.   the place is very busy during lunch time, so we took out instead.."}
{"text":"Fantastic roti. Amazing service. It was super busy when we went in and they sped through the line as quickly as they could while making sure everyone was happy and their orders were accurate. We are becoming regulars at this place...and when you are treated like long lost family... why wouldn't you want to be?"}
{"text":"Great place for authentic Caribbean food. Good quality and value for money. GREAT FLAVOURS!! Will go again and recommend to others. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I've been to alot of places but this place is by far the best ! I've been going here for a long time and  it's never let me down ! I get the boneless curry goat wrapped in the roti with dal ! ( the dal is a must have) and a double for later :)   The best !"}
{"text":"IMHO, best Carribean place in Mississauga.  I've had doubles, jerk chicken, beef stew with callaloo and goat roti and they are delicious. What I really love about this place is that it has a bit of a homey feel to it without feeling too dive-ish and the staff at the counter are very friendly and serve you with a smile. :-)"}
{"text":"The dhalpuri is fresh and soft, I would have given four stars to this place if it were not for: 1. The boneless chicken curry is super dry 2. The Tuesday and Wednesday special is more than one half less the quantity of meat than the regular ones 3. The curry has no potato except for the shrimp curry (they put potato in this, I assume to make it more hearty because there is very little shrimp) 4. The flavour of the curry is very mild, has no kick and overall, quite bland.  Note, that if you pack separately there is an extra charge, which is standard, but lets you see the quantity you get on tuesday and wednesday specials are much less.  The doubles have no kick, and is very oily.  This place gets a three star because it is adequate curry in the area and great dhalpuri.  Also note, that they were randomly closed at 2 pm on their lunch special days."}
{"text":"Chicken boneless roti wrap is what i ordered. The spice Level was above average so I would recommend to go down one spice Level while ordering. Also they only take cash and debit.  taste was absolutely amazing. Orginal Indian trindad flavours.  I could feel a mix of boneless chicken curry with sambar in roti."}
{"text":"This is my favourite Roti stop in Mississauga. The staff are friendly. The location is great for dine in and take out. I like how you can call ahead for pick up. Tuesday's they have their chicken Roti special and it's delicious. Location is clean and there is ample parking in the plaza. The cassava cake dessert is yummy. I like how you can add meat to their appetizer: Doubles."}
{"text":"One of the best Roti Shops in town, friendly family owned restaurant. Food is phenomenal. The Chicken Boneless roti with mild pepper is perfect. I could eat here everyday!"}
{"text":"Come here for those Tuesday and Wednesday specials!! I usually get the boneless chicken roti. it's dark meat. Roti is good, a mix of chicken and potatoes. They consider it a snack size, food does take a while though. People are friendly.  Doubles aren't bad either, but small for the price.   Minus one star for not taking credit and its a minimum of $5 for debit.  Edit: They raised their prices to 3.99 on Tues and Weds for specials"}
{"text":"Roti was huge and delicious. Just wished they stayed open later on weekends.  You must try the jerk chicken roti. Messy to eat, but incredibly tasty."}
{"text":"In my experience, there are 2 great places for Roti. According to Trini's and Guyanese, this is one of the best in the Toronto area. It is always busy, and they do such a great job with all their food. The service is great, always a smile, Trini style. (i think they are Trini) Anyway, their Doubles....WOW! Their Roti's are always perfect. If you can handle the spice, go for it. I always do....no regrets. We also have the curry chicken/goat/beef with the rice, it is also excellent.   It is not a fancy, sit down restaurant (paper plates), and I am happy about that."}
{"text":"We were visiting from Detroit and decided to go there as the yelp reviews were good. First time trying Caribbean food and have to say that this place is AWESOME. Clean and well kept restaurant with steady crowd (even at odd hours). We ordered shrimp roti, boneless goat roti, Veggie platter, chicken stew roti and doubles and everything was made to perfection. It's a family run operation and the food is hearty and made with love. My wife literally requested to meet and compliment the chef (Owner) after eating all that deliciousness. Will definitely be coming here every time we visit Canada.  Keep up the great work :-)"}
{"text":"Wednesday is the time to be at Leela's! There are a lot of specials available, and the serving sizes are generous. I ordered the bone in goat roti ($3.99) and my friend got the jerk chicken platter ($10 I think), they ask if you would like peas and hot sauce in the roti, but beware, the hot sauce is intense. I would recommend getting it on the side and adding it in as you go, similarly for the jerk chicken.  The roti was a bout the size of a large fist, and had large pieces of goat inside (the bone was kind of annoying though), I could have loved to polish off 2-3 of these, I want to try the chicken and potatoes ones next.  I stole some jerk chicken from my friend too, I personally thought it was average at best, but my friend has been in love with it for the longest time.   Good place for a cheap but filling meal, will go back soon!"}
{"text":"The flavour is different. Base is mostly hing and ghee. Now that can truely be Caribbean flavour but wasn't for me. I have tried few other Caribbean places and liked the flavour better."}
{"text":"I found a hair in my roti and when I informed the woman at the cash (I believe her name was Annie or Anna) she accused me of planting the hair and refused to give me a refund. The other ladies who worked there are very polite but I was very offended and will never return to this place."}
{"text":"Love love love this place!   Great for a quick and hearty Roti or my favourite doubles.   Relatively good prices and fast service but I wish there was more seating. They really need to expand.   Expect a wait when they're really busy.   I always get the channa roti but anything you order here will be fantastic. The staff is usually pretty friendly and often enjoy a little humorous banter if you make the effort.   Make sure you get some of the tamarind chutney on your roti. It's fantastic!"}
{"text":"From Queens, NY - home of all the Caribbean eats, had Lunch at Leelas (was a reccomendation)  tried their Curry Goat , dhal and Rice , one word -  perfect! meat seasoned well and cooked tender , dhal was literally home made and the Peppa sauce, best I've had in Toronto, not the watered down crap they give at other places.....Can't wait to try them again!"}
{"text":"Went with my three Asian friends, helping them experience the wonders of Caribbean cuisine. Needless to say, they were blown out of the water not only by the taste, but by the price.   Ordered bone-in goat special ($4.99) with doubles ($1.25), pholouri ($2.00), and a drink ($2.00). The goat was great and there was barely any bone, doubles are always a good time, and the 12pc pholouri was split among my group. I would advise against getting a drink, as it's relatively overpriced.   Atmosphere is nice; they upgraded the washrooms, though seating area is still pretty small. They play some great mashups for music, which was awesome.   For less than $10, you honestly can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"One of the best Roti places in Mississauga.  The only thing is that sometimes there's more wrap than there is filling on SOME DAYS! Other than that I'm a huge fan of their jerk chicken roti and their doubles!  They're quick and super friendly staff!"}
{"text":"So good! Family run business with really good service and really good food! Their rotis are amazing and double are reallllly good! Try the Pholourie you will love it!! Very good pricing here highly recommend it! Only complaint is that they close a little too early LOL"}
{"text":"Doing an update on this resto for menu purposes. Read my previous review as it hasn't really change much. Went here for lunch with my coworker and he ordered the fish soup and curry goat roti. He loved it and said that was the best 11 dollars he spent for lunch.  I ordered the chicken roti as they have 3.99 roti specials on Tuesdays.  I also ordered the doubles. The menu said it was 1.79 for veggie, 2.75 for meat. As I placed the order for my doubles she failed to mention that the shrimp would cost 4.95. They should put a sign saying shrimp is 4.95, so that people are aware  A little fyi would be great. Nonetheless I didn't bother to change it."}
{"text":"Tried the doubles with meat (goat) with medium pepper (spice level) and boneless goat roti (paratha, medium pepper) in regular size.  Both were fantastic!  It was my first time eating the doubles and I am addicted!  The online ordering with email confirmation made it so much easier to pick up my food.    On my second visit, I had the Tuesday/Wednesday special.  I chose boneless chicken, Dhal & rice, medium pepper.  I also ordered the mini duck roti (paratha, medium pepper).  Since the online ordering wasn't available at this time so I showed the screenshot of my order.  Initially I was surprised to hear that the free coupon from Yelp is no longer valid.  But the owner was nice enough to honour the offer.  One star is lost because I didn't get the duck roti that I ordered.  I got goat with bone inside instead! If it was the boneless one, I would've been less upset."}
{"text":"We've visited this spot a few times, and overall, each experience has been pretty average (if that). Located just west of Mavis Road and Rathburn Road, in the same plaza as Long & McQuade, we've visited whenever the cravings for 'doubles' hits us (for those unfamiliar, doubles are a Caribbean street food similar to a sandwich, stuffed with chick peas and spices). To be honest, I've had infinitely better doubles out in Scarborough and while the the doubles at Charlie's (another Caribbean joint in Mississauga at Hurontario and Dundas) were also pretty basic to me, I liked the Charlie's version vs. Leela's version.  On a recent visit, we purchased three (3) doubles and a potato pie (aloo pie). The doubles were so soaked in oil that it was so flimsy and difficult to pick up. It lacked the slight crispiness the flatbread should have, and was to the point of soggy. The aloo pie was okay but lacked the flavour I'm used to.   Overall, pretty mediocre. There are many other spots in the GTA (and Mississauga) that do these items better."}
{"text":"I honestly can't believe how high the rating is for this restaurant. I tried this place out last week because of yelps reviews... Let me just say, I want my $9.05 back. I ordered the stew chicken dinner and it was bland, bland, bland... Not authentic at all! The rice and beans weren't even good! I was very disappointed in my meal. The service however was good and the restaurant was clean which is why I'm giving it 3 stars instead of 2. I am almost certain that Shondra's Roti Place is as authentic and fresh as it gets! I've learned my lesson ... I won't cheat on my Caribbean joint again!"}
{"text":"OMG This place is amazing! The bone in chicken Roti was seasoned perfectly, the right amount of pepper and is a HUGE serving for $9.00!!!!  I also bought a pepper sauce for $4.00 it's great! I will be going back soon!"}
{"text":"Doubles were delicious, Rotis were great (and huge, one is easily enough for two people). Had the duck option and there really wasn't too much meat in the mix; what I had instead were a lot of bones (meat-eaters might be better off sticking to one of the boneless options perhaps? I'll have to try that next time). What meat there was tasted pretty good though. Overall a pretty solid place, it's just that next time I'll be looking to fine-tune my order to something that suits me a little better."}
{"text":"Tried their shrimp roti after all the hype and was kind of average. With a huge portion of roti, the shrimp were only 3-4 small ones and the curry flavour was a bit land tbh. Might go back to try once again but nothing out of the ordinary!"}
{"text":"Try the boneless goat roti. The flavour is fantastic and portions are ample, even the \"mini\" serving."}
{"text":"The selling point of this place is that it is cheap, and for the quality of food you can't complain.   I tried both the goat boneless roti and the double. were they the best? No, but certainly still quite yummy. I had no complaints on my roti, it was flavorful and filling. I finished it in less than 2 min and forgot to take a picture (sorry).  the doubles were a tad too oily, and was slidding all over the wrapping. but since this is literally my first time having the dish ever I can only say that I personally don't like the oil."}
{"text":"Came here with my coworkers because it was highly recommended by my manager. It was my first time getting roti but I enjoyed every single bite (I got the \"bone goat parathra)!"}
{"text":"This is by far the best Roti in town! I don't eat them very often any more, but when I do, I make sure it's from here."}
{"text":"PRETTY GOOD! I have been a few times now and it's been consistent..however four stars simply because they're little slow on the orders. I work close by so I call ahead and then pick it up. it's very fresh and quite tasty.. their dhal phouri alone is tasty. I have had their Goat with and without bone and the chicken both in regular size and mini. I haven't tried any other items offered on the menu but their roti...worth the trip."}
{"text":"Roti's big and a bit too juicy. They don't honour their Yelp check in offer. It's ok, and fills the roti hole, but it makes me miss my old roti place even more."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best trini restaurants in Toronto! Authentic mom and pop type place serving comfort foods. Love the doubles and veggie platter with pumpkin, mango, eddoes, spinach with of course bus up shut. Nice that they have pasteles during holidays and pone(cassava cake) and paime on a regular basis. I think I would go with the goat in dhalpuri naan at Lena's though because first of all I ordered a mini boneless goat with rice but when I opened up my to-go order, we were given a bone in goat wrapped in dhalpuri naan...tell me something...how do you bite into a roti full of bones??? Kind of messed up or shady if you ask me plus we were charged extra for the boneless price and not the mini price. Only for that I would go to Lena's, plus I think Lena's has better pone!"}
{"text":"This is my FAVOURITE place to get my Trini food fix! Doubles is a big deal for me, and I've tried so many places after moving to TO. And nowhere came close to the way I liked it. The bara is almost perfect, plus the consistency of the channa is the way it should be. Everything on their menu is like you just sat down at your mother's table. I travel 30mins to get there.... and it's worth it every time."}
{"text":"Great place, atmosphere, food and staff....it's more of a take out place but they do have a few seating area that is self serve....prices are reasonable and generous portions, we ordered the goat, jerk chicken, boneless chicken roti and they gave us a complimentary doubles, I really liked the doubles, jerk chicken tastes different from other Jamaican places but it guess it's because this is a trinny place Will come back for sure"}
{"text":"Hi, the source of my complaint was not the heat of the pepper. It was the fact that I had food poisoning the next day after eating your food. Also I am from Trinidad and I'm pretty accustomed to the peppers and all the other ingredients in doubles."}
{"text":"The food is tasty but the restaurant is off-putting.  I visited Leela's for the first time on a random weekend afternoon back in July. The plaza was fairly quiet but once I stepped inside, I could see that the restaurant was bustling and had a steady line of customers. The original plan was to eat there, but there was a really sickening, strong floral bathroom scent near the entrance, so we ended up getting take-away instead. The service was a little frosty but tolerable. While waiting for my order, I noticed a bucket above a wall beside the counter, near the kitchen... for catching a roof leak I assume. It wasn't directly above where tables of customers were sitting and eating, but I found this to be very odd so close to a dining space.  I ordered for 2 people (not knowing that the portions here are massive)- the doubles, a regular sized boneless jerk chicken roti, and a regular sized boneless goat roti. Both roti were delicious! The jerk chicken was juicy, spicy and very flavorful. The goat was nice and flavorful, though some pieces were a little dry. The doubles were very saucy and too sweet for our liking, probably wouldn't get them again but don't regret trying them.  I will swing by again for some take-away and perhaps try out some of their specials during the week."}
{"text":"This place was pretty good, like 3.5-4* good.  It's been a while since my last visit to Leela's.  The last time I was there, it was pre-reno as I've noticed that it looks more inviting and it actually has seating now.  It's also more professional with an actual menu posted and less hand-written signs.  I ordered the Lunch Special which was Jerk Chicken with either Rice & Peas OR Roti for $4.99.  And I decided on the Roti.  It was a good portion, very tasty, and not super salty which I find a lot of the time with West Indian/Indian food in general.  Good flavours and I loved the hot sauce which came on the side!  As I was waiting for my takeout, I was able to take my time to scan the menu + various signs on the same wall.  And I found out that there's actually various options that you might not know about, re:  you can order dalhpuri or parantha shell, various hot sauces are available, and the \"deals\" are posted aside from the menu.    A mini roti was $5.99 whereas there was sorta the same option available, at least on Wednesdays, for $3!  So if it's your first visit, take your time to see all those various options that are available to you.      Would definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"Amazing roti shells, I've been coming here for roti shells (I make my own fillings) for years !!! I highly recommend. Food is fresh and the service is super quick."}
{"text":"I'm Guyanese, so I know good West Indian food (though I'm slightly biased, as everything is compared to mom's cooking - lol).  This place is FANTASTIC!  The prices are great, and the food is even better.  The people are very friendly, and the restaurant is very clean.  The doubles are delicious and only $1.50 each.  My boyfriend, who has a bottomless stomach, ordered 4 and was stuffed.  Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"Doubles are really amazing but I think that the ones with meat are on the pricier side... We also like getting their plain (either frozen or fresh) dhalpuri and rotis. But be prepared for long lines and a long long wait for your food to be ready, or avoid going on weekends."}
{"text":"Had lots of expectations when i went there after reading fellow yelpian reviews. But i found food to be more on the average side rather than being good. Food was oily. Would not be repeating it as i have a restaurant near my home serving same cuisine and probably better than it. To conclude, I would say it is just an average eating joint."}
{"text":"Friendly and helpful staff even during a busy rush. Food was tasty and very filling. If you're not sure about your spice threshold ask for the heat on the side as the seasoning is perfectly balanced of flavor and spice."}
{"text":"Not bad chicken Roti but it was dry, no sauce, dry chicken. Not really worth the $10 they're asking for it. Maybe $6-7."}
{"text":"Had the boneless chicken wrap. It was missing taste. I feel as though there was no salt or pepper or anything to make it distinct. However, the price and the size makes me willing to try other menu items."}
{"text":"Best doubles and roti in the GTA hands down!! Consistent and great family vibe! A must eat!!!"}
{"text":"Never disappointing... always good and fresh!!! Love to come again and again...!! Busy place but quick on service and food test constant!!!"}
{"text":"After reading other people's raving reviews, I decided to try it myself. I'm not a roti fan and have had only a couple of them prior to my visit to Leela's. When I got there, there was only 1 other person waiting for his order, and I was wondering why it took so long to get my mini roti. For a grand total of $3.50 (including tax), I wasn't expecting much. I drove home and unwrapped the piping hot goodness. I ordered chicken (bone-in) roti, medium spice - I ate half and had to drink 2 glasses of water! The flavours were definitely all there and the portion was huge! I can't imagine what the full size order will be like. I'm excited to go back and try the other items on their menu."}
{"text":"Best Trinidadian/Caribbean restaurant in Mississauga by far! It's always busy but nevertheless the service is good (they were happy to help with any confusion I had about the menu offerings) and the food is excellent. My usual is the boneless goat with rice and dhal, which is amazing. I also, tried the veggie platter, whereby there are numerous choices of veggie options to choose from, all of which were delicious.  The prices are very affordable and the quantity given is large. I would highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"excellent food. consistent quality. generous servings. super friendly staff."}
{"text":"For a stress free Tuesday, you don't need to cook dinner. They have Tuesday's special at $3.33. While you wait, there's reggae music playing in the background.   Happy:  For the price, I'm full with a chicken roti with spicy sauce on the side. It's really spicy and awesome!!   Not happy:  Sometimes the wait can be 15-25 minutes depending when you on a Tuesday. There was not enough chick peas and pieces of potatoes on top of the rice. See photo. Too much rice and not enough goodies.   Verdict:  I'll only go back on Tuesday's special as it's more worth it. Prepare to wait as I wonder how long it takes them to prepare behind closed doors."}
{"text":"Finally got a chance to visit the long-bookmarked Leela's Roti and Doubles while I was doing some penance in 'sauga. Located in a plaza near Erindale GO Station, there was a queue of hungry patrons when I got there, and the delicious aroma of West Indian food was quickly working its way into the fabric of my clothes. It's not a hole in the wall: very clean and painted in bright island yellow.   The menu above the counter gives you the scoop. The prices here are quite excellent and -- as I would find out later -- the portion sizes are quite generous. We ordered a goat ($8), a boneless chicken ($7) and a potato/channa rotis ($5) for five people. Each combo comes with a roti, which seemed to be a folded up square mile of dhalpuri stuffed with crumbly yellow peas. The meals were also served with tiny cup of hot sauce which we used as a dipping chutney.   The meat was tender and flavourful and with the roti it was a super satisfying meal. While I expected the curries to be spicier, the spicy sauce it came with was REALLY hot. Maybe I should have just poured it in and stirred it in. (Is that what you're supposed to do?)  A great take out experience. I'd love to go back and check out their counter where you can purchase spicy dried channa, tamarind flavoured treats, dried plantain chips, and Guava cheese, especially since I have no idea what the latter is. Oh, and I think you can buy CDs here also.  Obligatory Title Pun: That's all she ROTI.  Menu Readability: I like my menus like I like books: with pictures.  Need to mention: Fried plantains are only available on the weekends.  What this place teaches me about myself: That I must humbly bow to the suburbs on this one."}
{"text":"I recently came here the other week to grab some Caribbean food on the go. Never tried doubles  before so I decided to get some. I got the goat doubles . It was surprisingly good as the goat was soft and tender. Im a fan and will be back to get more doubles and try their rotis as well."}
{"text":"Ordered take out this morning through the phone.  I was very happy they were open at 9 am on a Sunday. It was easy to order. They asked me if I wanted boneless or not and how spicy and small or large. I ordered 2 large chicken roti, boneless, medium spice and 4 doubles little spice. The only thing is that you still have to wait in a long line whether or not you order through the phone, that's the only downside.  I was so happy they spelled my name correctly though! In the store they play traditional music and have desserts on display also some pictures of what you can order. My total came to $31.  The people are nice there.  The doubles were kinda sweet and not what I expected- next time I will order medium  or hot. The chicken roti in dalpurri was very good, right amount of spice. Will definitely be returning. I want to try their mango curry."}
{"text":"A solid 3.5 if I could. Fresh rotis and doubles. Nice and clean good ambience. Generous portion of chunky goat pieces in the doubles. Will surely be back for their jerk chicken and chicken stew."}
{"text":"Tuesday's special is great! Went in today and the place was packed. But the jerked chicken with rice was worth the wait. Heat was on point. Establishment was very welcoming and clean."}
{"text":"Something was off today. Ordered boneless chicken roti and it was dry and lacking flavor.  The jerk chicken on rice was meh.  Coleslaw w was great. I ordered a small side of callallo and it was $6!  I gave a 10% tip when ordering but when I went back to ask for some pepper sauce they said it would cost me extra!"}
