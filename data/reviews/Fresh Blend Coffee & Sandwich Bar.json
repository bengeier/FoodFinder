{"text":"A very cute, small cafe located in Varsity across from Planet Organic. I've been coming here for approx. 2 years and have seen it switch management, but still retain its customer service, food, drinks, and atmosphere.  Couches at the back provide a comfy reading spot and can be reserved for meetings if you wanted. Free wifi is available.  Coffee is fresh--the coconut one if they have it brewing that day is amazing--and they've recently added loose leaf teas in addition to their bagged tea selection.  Sandwich bar and paninis are offered, but the soups are my favourite, especially chicken noodle, along with the raspberry/rhubarb muffin which is the most amazing tasting thing in the world. I know some bakery items are freshly made in the cafe, while others are brought in.  The employees are always lovely (I work nearby and they are so kind in remembering who I am) and strive to offer the best service possible. They offer a drink punch card that gives you $5 off on your 11th punch, and have soup/sandwich deals depending on the day.  With their newly extended hours, including being open on Sundays, there is plenty of time to relax with a beverage and read.  It would be amazing if outdoor space could be provided, and while a bench is offered, the complex the coffee shop is located in unfortunately lacks the space. That being said, plenty of room to sit inside, and always a calm atmosphere."}
{"text":"1st time going to Fresh Blend Coffee shop at 2 pm on Sunday, December 11, 2016.  Went to the counter and a young (14 or 15) kid was behind the counter.  Nothing; absolutely nothing for a response to a customer standing in front of him.  Ordered drip coffee it came lukewarm.  Asked for cream and a 1 litre container was put in front of me.  An older women \"Mom\" was there to and \"Dad\" came in after 10 minutes.  There are so many warm, friendly with good coffee shops around why would I bother to go back?"}
{"text":"Absolutely an unprofessional, arrogant and rude owner! Smelly place! I went there for the first time (and definitely  the last time) with my friends, a friend of mine ordered a cappuccino and politely asked about adding less sugar, but the owner rudely with a mocking tone argued with my friend that \"here is not a Tim Horton\". We asked to cancel our order he refused! We just left there! Never come back again!"}
{"text":"Alright food. Very slow service. The owner wrote down our order and then forgot our coffees, so we asked again and it was about 10 minutes before they came out. They were OK coffees. At one point a man walked in and went to the back to use the washroom, the owner followed him, saying \"excuse me, where are you going? Washrroms are for paying customers only, are you going to buy something?\" The guy said yes and went on his way.  The washrrom was borderline dirty.  Overall wouldn't reccomend."}
{"text":"Hey, I went for a Latte this morning. Asked for no foam, the owner argued with me and told me what I ordered was not a Latte. I left.  Anyways, I went to Starbucks supported the \"big guy\" got my Latte non fat with no foam. They did not argue and took my $5.  Won't be back."}
{"text":"I wanted to try Fresh Blend for a bite to eat.  The place is a decent size, there are quite a few small tables to sit at.  The woman at the til didn't really greet me, I greeted her.  As I stood there trying to decide what to get she kept rushing me, \"Hello, what can I get you? Hello.\"  I hate being rushed.  I asked what soup they had and she pointed to a written sign behind the til.  The sandwiches all went for around $5, a bowl of soup was $3.60.  I decided on the potato bacon soup and a small cappuccino.  The coffees for a medium were all at least $4, which I would expect to pay for a large at other small cafes.  The woman took my money and gave me my soup, she was miserable.  I found a table in the back and waited for my capp.  The woman who brought it out to me seemed nicer than the other woman.  My soup turned out to be pretty good, my cappuccino as well.    Overall the quality of my soup and capp were good, the setting was pretty laid back.  I wasn't impressed by the service when you are paying those prices though."}
{"text":"I like to support local businesses when I can. It looks cute from the outside.  I stopped in on route to an appointment and needed a coffee STAT.   They do serve a variety of different coffees and some light food (soups, sandwiches and salads). When i walked in, it was quiet basic space and not spaced very well. It seemed very disorganized with how the tables and chairs were laid out. Went to the counter and just stood there. No line up and no one served me. Finally iI saw a lady behind the counter, she walked up and just stood there. A bit strange since a \" hi or hello\" would suffice. I ordered a mocha to go. Slightly over priced at almost $5.00 and no whip cream or anything. Paid and got out of there. Not the best warm beverage I have had and definetly over priced comparing to any large chains or local coffee shops. Next time I have an appointment, i will keep driving past this place and go else where.   The 3 stars are that it was quick service and no line."}
{"text":"I love this place and think the food and coffee is fantastic. I like supporting local businesses and the owner is very appreciative of everyone who visits. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"The americano was mediocre, the lemon poppyseed muffin was stale. The barista/waiter was very rude even though we tipped him...he didn't crack a smile and he didn't tell us that they were closing in 5 minutes as we ordered to stay and set up the computer and everything(we assumed that a coffee shop would be open past 5)."}
{"text":"Fresh Blend just doesn't do it for me.  The service isn't particularly friendly, you have to walk through somewhat of a storage space to get to a dingy restroom and their mochas are no good.  The food and other beverages might be fine, but the atmosphere is weird.  I've never felt happy and excited to settle in and I've always noticed the music to be a bit too loud or kind of lame.  Today they were playing some sort of Belinda Carlisle greatest hits CD until it started to skip, which they didn't pick up on right away.  Then it was more lame 80's music.    I'm also not a fan of the parking lot situation.  The stalls are so small that I'd be willing to bet there's a 50/50 chance of getting a door ding.  In fact, I had to rest my car door on someone else's today just to get in and out.  I've given Fresh Blend enough chances and now I'm done.  Enjoy, Varsity residents."}
{"text":"This is actually quite a cute, neat little coffee shop.  I've been in and around the Varsity area countless times and never visited this place.  I was happy I stumbled into it one afternoon when I was shopping.  It's a fairly average place with the regular coffee and pastries you'd find at other places, but has more of a homemade feel to it.  It has a nice atmosphere to it with interesting pictures of coffee-related designs painted on the walls.  They have these nice chairs with coffee imprints on the back... just thought they were cute!  The workers of the place were all so cute and friendly.  They all had such welcoming faces and seemed excited when I came in.  The place wasn't dead, so it couldn't have been due to boredom.  They just seemed like good people who enjoy what they do.  All the pastries and goodies looked so delicious and fresh.  The prices aren't outrageous for the amount of food you would get.  There was this yummy looking pie thing that I'm kicking myself for not trying.  Next time, I guess.  They also had an assortment of sandwiches for lunchtime to choose from.  I really enjoyed sitting in this place enjoying a cup of coffee.  It was a good afternoon... and I even got a second coffee to go!"}
