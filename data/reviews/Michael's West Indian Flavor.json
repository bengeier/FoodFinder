{"text":"Don't let this hole in the wall fool you! The oxtail with coleslaw, rice and peas were amazing and flavorful. The portions are of generous size. My boyfriend had the stewed chicken and loved it. Unfortunately they were out of jerk chicken but i will definitely be coming back to try some new items again!"}
{"text":"The absolute best Jamaican food in town! The oxtail is slow cooked to perfection. Jerk chicken is done perfectly and the curry goat is delicious. Don't let the looks inside fool you this a diamond in the rough. Keep in mind that everyday the menu has it changes and the food is cooked fresh daily!"}
{"text":"I was a little disappointed with Michael's. I came just before noon on a Sunday and there was indeed a line of about 4 people in front of me. It seemed that the oxtail here truly is the most popular dish as 3 of the four in front of me ordered it. Since I'd be feeding four, I ordered a large oxtail ($14) and a large jerk chicken ($9). My \"large\" oxtail came in a larger container than the people who had ordered smalls before me. It had more rice n' peas but I was given the same amount of oxtail as the small orders. It became evident that she was almost out of oxtail and wanted to reserve the last few for one more order. Not cool, but I decided against saying anything.  The flavour of everything was ok. The oxtail was mild in spice and had a subtle curry flavour. The jerk was cold, mild in spice and just mediocre.  I will not be back as I have another Caribbean spot down the street which I prefer much more."}
{"text":"Curry anything here is damn good, and if you get a chance to taste their oxtail you'll agree it's some of the best tasting around. As mentioned below, oxtail is usually gone by 1-2pm so be there early. Any regulars reading this will know what I mean, get there or it's gone. I've only ordered the dinner size and it leaves me completely satisfied everytime. Try the oxtail just once and I guarantee it'll keep you coming back for more!"}
{"text":"I'm writing this review on behalf of the hubby who thought the oxtail here was amazing. In fact, he ranked it #1 on his list. I thought it was good too but oxtail in general isn't really my favorite so it wasn't as big of a deal for me as it was for the hubby who's a huge fan. This place almost always sells out around late afternoon/early evening during the week. We swung by around 6pm and they were already sold out of everything (I think they just sold not too long ago because the store was still open)."}
{"text":"If you want jerk in the hood this is your place.  Real deal and price is good to.  Just a takeout."}
{"text":"I'm so glad I found this place in my last year of school. For $6 (cash only) you can get a delicious small jerk chicken meal which includes rice and peas, and coleslaw. The area doesn't have much to offer in terms of affordable meals, so this is an absolute STEAL. Will definitely be coming back here."}
