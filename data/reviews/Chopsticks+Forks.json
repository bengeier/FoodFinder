{"text":"Chopsticks+Forks runs a great food tour. I got to experience the Korean one and it was a lot of fun with great company. I've had Korean food before but still learned about dishes I wouldn't normally try and discovered some new dishes that I really like. Definitely recommend you try it out!"}
{"text":"What better way to experience Toronto than with your tastebuds! Jusep, the highly knowledgeable proprietor of C+F and his able assistant Michael, took us to the center of Toronto's diverse food culture. Our walking tour included Peruvian, Korean, Tibetan, Ethiopian, Native American and other interesting cuisines including a stop at a Scandinavian tea house.    We prepaid and the 2+ hour tour included all the food.  Our group included seniors and a four year old.  Everybody was entertained and well fed. It was a great way to see some of the sights and learn of the history of the food, the ethnic immigrations and the city itself. Food for the body and the mind! Delicious! I recommend this tour highly and would do it again without hesitation just to tap into Jusep's knowledge and try new foods."}
{"text":"I attended Chopsticks+Forks' Korean Food 101 about a month ago. It is a dining experience introducing diners to the diversity of Korean cuisine. The program was designed to teach people about the richness of Korea's culinary delights, one that goes beyond Korean BBQ. The dinner was a 7-course tasting menu, and the portion was pretty substantial for our table of 6 people. Since it was a communal dinner, we were encouraged to socialize with those at the table.   The 2.5 hour guided \"Korean Food 101\" sit-down dining experience ($53 CAD person) introduced us to many dishes that are loved by Koreans. I am quite familiar with Korean cuisine, but I did learn a lot about some of the dishes served that night. We had a total of 7 dishes (+ bachan) that night, and each course was accompanied by a detailed explanation of the origin and background of the dish. For example, I didn't know that the Jap Chae was considered a dish of Imperial decent.   The concept behind Chopsticks + Forks is to explore the rich culture of Korean food with other like-minded people who also love food. The company is run by Jusep, who have traveled to over 50 countries, which is very impressive. He was full of energy and enthusiastic about Korean culture and its food. Jusep also shared several personal stories about his childhood and his life growing up eating Korean cuisine, and explained his reason behind Chopsticks + Forks. Overall, I found the event to be extremely well-organized and the food came out in a reasonable time frame. Lastly, the evening ended with a guided tour around a Korean supermarket that is located next door to the restaurant."}
