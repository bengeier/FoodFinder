{"text":"Great place and great wings EXCEPT when the short female is working. She has major attitude, over cooks the wings till they're dry inside, even the Kool aid is watery when she's working. She also takes the phone off the hook when she feels like it. I don't know why they let her work there especially by herself. She is the only reason I stopped going and I was going about 3x a week!     Makes me sad because I really loved that place, she just kills it. The food and the customer service. The rest of you guys are awesome! Would somebody please train her properly?"}
{"text":"Yum-itty Yum Yum... so many flavors and taste. I recommend the oh-so crispy TWC style. They have Kool-aid Baby! 3 flavors... and their banquettes for sure."}
{"text":"Just finished lunch wings are amazing. Tried 4 different types all were delicious. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"First time here. Loved the service and the food. It's my wife's birthday, and they gave us a free sample of TWC wings and complimentary beignets. The TWC rub is amazing. Definitely a different kind of flavor for a dry rub for wings. I got the hot and mango habanero. Hot were great with more of the smokey habanero taste. Mango habanero were not too hot and had a great sweetness to compliment. My wife had the original buffalo wings. They had more heat than normal and a very original flavor. Five stars! This is officially our wing place!"}
{"text":"Excellent wings. Tried the boneless ones in medium and then in the garlic. Nice crunch and tender meat. Excellent food."}
{"text":"Great chicken,excellent seasoned fries.Inexpensive too.I'll be back a lot."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place finally and it was awesome. You can't go wrong with Flavorful crispy wings and a Kool-aid cocktail. The staff was super friendly and polite! We will be here again!"}
{"text":"I ordered the TWC dry rub and Lemon Pepper chicken wings and they were delicious. Nice sizes wings and very crispy. I also ordered their sesoned frys and they were great. Good friendly service and nice and clean. I definetly will go back."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Ive been here about 12 times the past two weeks... it's that good. High quality chicken for both traditional bone in and boneless. Always cooked to perfect crisp. Sauces and dry rubs taste great. TWC is amazing. Also they  have a great staff that are very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Customer service here is awesome!! They let me try any flavor and gave me their recommendations! Wings were flavorful (I had TWC and honey Sriracha) seasoned fries were awesome, yummy kool aid, and home ranch! Need I say more? Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"First time eating here. We tried 3 kinds original twc and parm. All were crispy hot and .excellent. the best part is they use rice flour so they are gluten free. First time ive been able to have wings in a long long time. The french fries are not gluten free. If you order wings and french fries you get a free drink. They also have a reward program you can earn points. Friendly staff. Small and plain but has tables. I would recommend highly."}
{"text":"My Husband and I are huge Wings fans. And we would drive the city to get a good wing!! This place  is worth the drive!! I have not had a bad experience yet and have gone many times. I even had my job cater from here for a lunch and it was a huge success!! The TWC flavor are my favorite!!"}
{"text":"I have been to the Wing Counter a few time now, and really like that we have a good Wing joint in the North Valley.  It would be a five star review, for the Wings and Fries, but last night, the technology and customer service just left a lot to be desired.    We had made plans to go to a family members house to watch the Cardinals play Green Bay (Go Cards!) and volunteered to bring wings, so we could enjoy them and let others know about this great option in North Phoenix.  My family literally lives around the corner from me and although I am about 20 minutes from The Wing Counter, I thought I would make the drive since I was craving wings by this point.    I tried to place the order earlier in the day using their online ordering, but it would not allow me to adjust the pick-up time, it only had pick-up in 15 minutes as an option.  So I waited until about 40 minutes before we were to be at my family's to try to login and place the order.  I made all the selections and hit check-out, where it showed the list of items in my \"cart,\" but did not have a submit option.  In fact the options it did give, add more items, clear order or schedule for later, all did not work.  If I clicked on other links at the top of the page it would take me to other parts of the web site, but would not allow me to submit my order.  After about 3 attempts, I decided to just call and place the order.  The phone was answered promptly, and I placed my order at which time I was told the order would be ready in 15 minutes.  So I ran out, hopped in the car and began the 14 mile trip to the location.  It took me 17 minutes to drive there, so my wife volunteered to run in and pick up the order.  From my vehicle, I saw her pay at the register and then sit down.  She motioned to me that it wasn't ready yet.    I thought maybe they are running a few minutes behind, since it was right before the game and I likely am not the only person who thought wings would be a great game enhancer.  I watched as a couple of people came out with their orders and a few others go in and place orders.  I watched the clock as time ticked away and sent a message to my family letting them know we were running a few minutes late (as they also had other food, they picked up and were attempting to keep warm).  Another 5 minutes past, then 10 and 15.  At this point, I am becoming irritated; after all, they told us on the phone it would be ready in 15 minutes and it has now been 30.  It was then I saw the group that went in and placed their order after my wife had gone in to pay for ours, receive their food that I lost it.    My wife got up to check on ours, but I also walked in to see what was taking so long.  As I walked in they were handing our order to my wife.  I asked what took so long, to which the cashier replied \"we had a bunch of orders come in.\"  Fine, I understand that, but I would assume those orders must have come in prior to mine, so if you knew the orders were backing up why did you tell me, and continue to tell people placing orders as my wife waited, that orders would be ready in 15 minutes, when we had now waited 40 minutes.  This could only mean, they did not have even start our order until my wife had been sitting there for 10 minutes.  He could have easily told me when I placed the order that it would be 30 to 40 minutes.  But instead, I rush to get there and end up waiting an additional 25 minutes.    I realize this is a \"first-world problem\" but customer service is not that difficult.  We all know restaurants get busy, but my time is also valuable to me and having already wasted time with an online ordering system that was not working, driving across town to share a previously positive experience with my family and then waiting long enough that I could have almost driven their, home and back again, it just really seemed like TWC dropped the ball, which creates a negative customer experience.  Now, with that being said, the quality of the wings and fries were spot on, and my family really liked the TWC style and the honey mustard.  The Beignets were tough, like they had been sitting for a while and we did not get the carmel dipping sauce (which I swear must contain crack, it is so addictive), so they were a disappointment.    Moral of the story, if I am in the area and have time to kill, I would likely visit again, but unless I am having a serious wing craving, I don't know if I will go out of my way to make a stop as I seem to value my time more than TWC seems to value it."}
{"text":"I went in for the first time today. I LOVED the sriracha honey wings! I love that they are fried and yummy! I am still on the border about the ranch but it works. Nothing wrong with it but it's homemade! I love the flavors. I got the sriracha honey and mango habanero. I love that it is convenient for me to go and grab wings when I get the craving. I don't have to drive! Overall satisfied. The fries might have been a little burnt. Must try!"}
{"text":"Nothing I love more than good chicken wings and this is definitely a good stop for them! Not only was the food fantastic but employees were friendly and so helpful! Whatever you're doing you're doing it right! Keep up the good work"}
{"text":"My second visit, these wings are great. I'm in town until Sunday.  Gotta try and get back at least one more time"}
{"text":"Excellent wings and customer service. This place is new and a hidden gem. Free kool aid when u order your wings with fries. This place is the business"}
{"text":"Really disappointed paid 30 dollars for wings and a fry and the boneless wings over just priced chicken nuggets. We will not be eating here again."}
{"text":"What really sold me on this place were the bitchy, passive-aggressive replies of the owner solely to the negative reviews. Apparently the throwaway, cheap part of a chicken is haute cuisine. Who knew? Anyway, solid wings, if not middle of the road. Slightly higher priced than comparable art forms. Wings are an art form now. If you're in the area, do it. If not, don't. If you don't like them, be sure to write a review here, because I love reading the self-congratulatory owner replies."}
{"text":"It means a lot for me to go out of my way and write a review..  Because toddler. Haha, I don't have time. But.. The Wing Counter deserves it. I've been there four times now. The food and service are both incredible. Tonight was exceptional  though. I like extra TWC seasoning on my wings. I asked for it, they may or may not have done it, I don't know. They were delicious regardless. Martez (sorry if I butchered your name) asked me how they were and if it were enough seasoning. I said ehh, could use more but I was NOT complaining. They were still great. Five minutes later, he walked out with a dozen extra TWC seasoned wings for me. THAT'S customer service my friends.  Also, best chocolate chip cookies ever."}
{"text":"The only thing that was good about the place was the fountain drink which wasn't even offered free to me with an order of fries. Service was horrible and wings were worse...I get it the F/B business sucks at times and is the last thing you want to be doing but to be greeted with a \"whats up\" is unacceptable if you want to be a respectable establishment. I ordered the 5 original buffalo wings and 5 TWC style dry rub flavor. Taste wasnt there and flavor was sub par. Felt like i was biting into a piece of salted cardboard box. Finally i get to my fries and they were soggy by the time i got home. Noted i live 5 min away from the place. Get home to find out I only found 1 souffle container of ranch... seriously? 1 for 10 wings? The guy that packed my food looked higher than a kite after he came back from his \"break\" Needless to say wont be going back and I would like my 14.95 back. Oh and they have a \"tip\" option when they already have a tip bowl next to the register. That made me chuckle."}
{"text":"I've tried wings in 30+ states and really like good wings. I ordered mine naked, and these are very good wings.  Good sauce. Great flavor. Not overdone. No old grease aftertaste.  I wish these guys would move to Alaska so I could stop in more often."}
{"text":"I had honey mustard, they were ok. My husband had garlic parmesan and sriracha honey. He enjoyed both. Had the season fries, they could have been crisper but good flavor. Two things, check the paper menus on counter there was a ranch that wasn't on main menu on board. Then we heard the guy behind counter ask another customer if they wanted boneless. I don't see anywhere on menu that says boneless. I prefer boneless."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing.  Best wings that I have had. I am a boneless fan and the sweet Thai chili were so unique and flavorful.  Not sure how they do it but they were actually crispy with a crunch.  The chocolate chip cookie is too good!  It is very clean."}
{"text":"The food is awesome! It is easy to order, try the dry rub wings!  I don't get a chance to come here often, but when i am in the area, i always stop in for lunch!"}
{"text":"Great wings and service! Blue cheese was just what I was looking for. Price was just about right.   I'll be back!"}
{"text":"The food and staff are great at The Wing Counter. My family makes a weekly trip and our children love the food as well. The TWC wings and buffalo style are our favorites. We will continue to go to The Wing Counter as it is now a family tradition!!!"}
{"text":"Super delicious wings! We got the original, mango habanero, Parmesan, and honey BBQ. They were crispy and had the perfect amount of sauce. We ordered online and our order was ready when we got there. The inside decor could use some work. Took a star away because they didn't give us celery and carrot sticks OR ranch (which we selected when we placed our order) with our to-go order. I feel like those things should be a given at a wing place. We will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Loved the Mango Habanero! Service was great! Would highly recommend if you like wings! Casual and fantastic!"}
{"text":"The ONLY reason this isn't a 5-star review is the prices here are steep! Borderline excessive.  But the wings and selection are excellent, from mildest to nuclear, dry seasoned to thick sauce.  We will definitely give it another try, maybe without our teenage food inhalers, so we don't have to take out a loan.  The staff is 5+ star worthy!  They were busy, but they still cared about everyone."}
{"text":"Second time back to the Wing counter . I was just as impressed as the first time . The wings were excellent.  I added seasoned fries this time and they were also excellent. Service is top notch. Thanks every one will be back soon. Chris b"}
{"text":"Delicious! My son is a wing addict, so we had ourselves a little mother-son night and ate here. He says they were the best wings that he has had in Arizona.   Everyone was really friendly and were happy to let us sample as many sauces as we wanted.  The fries were meaty, the ranch and bleu cheese both tasted homemade, and the wings were crispy and moist."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Perfect every time! Crispy on the outside and juicy on the outside. And the staff is so friendly and nice. Coming back!"}
{"text":"Come here multiple times a week for lunch..the staff and owners are always very friendly and welcoming. Food is amazing! Best wings I've ever had. Crispy style wings, delicious sweet potato fries with homemade ranch and refreshing Kool-aid to wash it all down. If you haven't tried this place DO IT! You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"The Atomic Buffalo Style buffalo wings are NOT for  the faint of heart. There's a reason they have you  sign a waiver because they are so hot. They have the distinction of having the hottest wings in the valley. Now I know why. Do love their honey mustard and will try their other flavors but never again will I order the Atomic. Ever."}
{"text":"Great wing, crisp and fat. The TWC dry rub is a must and the wings are gluten free. Love that it is an independent restaurant. Hard to find but a must try. Staff was friendly and helpful"}
{"text":"The Wing Counter is overall not bad. I tried the Original Hot, Honey Mustard, Garlic Parmesan, seasoned fries, and celery and carrots (free with checking on Yelp). The Original Hot was good and had plenty of heat to them without being overbearing. There is hotter sauce available. The Honey Mustard was very tasty. The Garlic Parmesan was my least favorite. The Garlic was so overbearing I couldn't taste anything else, including the Parmesan cheese. You get a healthy side of celery and carrots (cost extra) which were fresh and crispy. The seasoned fries were good. They cost $2.50, but are enough for two and you get a free drink with the fries. The cons: I was not impressed with the amount of meat for the price. At a little over a dollar per wing, they could have some more meat on them. The ranch dressing has too much dill. Although I appreciate the fresh ranch, the dill is a little much. Those two are pretty big for me as far as flavor and value. The sitting area is small. I had to take mine to go for lack of seating.   I'll probably be back every once in a while because the good customer service, you can sign up for point to earn free food, and some of the unique choices - but it won't be my go to wing spot."}
{"text":"This place has the BEST wings! Not a fan of the boneless wings, but the bone-in wings are big, meaty, and delicious. The TWC dry rub is my favorite, crispy on the outside,  juicy on the inside. The seasoned fries and the sweet potato fries are very good too. The staff are friendly which is always a definite plus. I am so glad The Wing Counter opened in my neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Great selection for wing sauce! Awesome customer serve and let's not forget the bomb home made donuts."}
{"text":"Wow! I'm addicted. Tried the TWC rub and original buffalo and they were both really flavorful. The buttery base gives their wings such good flavor. Also if you think you can handle heat you can sign a waiver to try the hottest sauce ever created."}
{"text":"Well as far as wings goes this is the place to go.  It is very convenient but more importantly the flavor is awesome.  Hubby has classic hot buffalo & Sriracha Honey and both were tasty.  The best ones were the TWC Style, try it, it is fantastic & seasoning is tasty.  We also had the French fries seasoned was two thumbs up.  Most importantly though to wash down all that saltiness & hotness was Kool aide which was perfect on a hot day.  So for fast wings but tastiness try this place, very easy to find & the staff were very friendly."}
{"text":"Good wings, great flavors and yummy fries. Only thing we didn't enjoy were our beignets, they were noticeably  burned and not tasty...kinda annoyed it looked like powder sugar was overused to hide it."}
{"text":"Finally crispy flavorful wings!!! This is my first experience and I will definitely return.  I tried the lemon dry rub and sweet chili wings.  Crispy until the last wing was devoured."}
{"text":"My husband and I had a takeout order from here the other day, and brought it home to our family. He had stopped in several weeks ago for dinner, and said he liked it, but on this takeout visit we didn't find things as favorable.    I placed the order, and made the drive to go get the food. Everyone is friendly, but I just did not find the wings to be a good value. I heard a comment on here, from one of the managers or owners, saying the wings are \"jumbo\". I would have to disagree 100%, as the wings were so tiny, that they're literally was barely any meat on them.  And when I say tiny, I'm not exaggerating.  I like that they were  crispy, and the flavors we had were pretty good, but just because they're crispy doesn't dismiss the fact they were so tiny.  We also received almost all \"flats\", with only 7 drumstick/legs out of 36 wings.  That was also dissapointing.   At about $1 per wing, they are more expensive than some other places, even many sit down restaurants (and many others don't charge extra for celery).  If the wings had more meat, this price would be more acceptable.  We also felt that the ranch dressing was so watered down, it was the consistency of milk, not dressing.  It was so thin it wouldn't even stick to our wings when we dunked them.  Hopefully they can get the size of their wings up so they're at least average, and will thicken up the ranch dressing. If they do this, it would be a much better experience."}
{"text":"Air handling system inside basically doesn't exist. Don't eat inside the store, get take out. Had garlic parmesan boneless and liked them. I don't think 6 boneless wings for $6 is a good deal. The bone in original flavor tastes good also, but I would again rate the value poorly. Carrots & celery seemed really fresh."}
{"text":"Had the honey BBQ wings with Coleslaw for lunch.  Both deserve 5* for sure.  Especially liked the slaw.  It did not have any mayonnaise, as one would normally expect.  Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Awesome wings!   Second time here and neglected to ask for boneless.  Remade the order without issue.  Stand up guys!   Great food!   Thanks"}
{"text":"Food is great! Service not so much, at least not at night.  Ordered online a couple of times, paid online but when I got tot the store to pick it up the place was closed. Just happened again last night. Came in on a weekday night in November and the 2 guys working, were yelling and cussing at each other and there was a large mixing bowl laying face down on the floor in the fry area (you can see it when you walk in) the eating area was a disaster. I asked the guys what the problem was, one responded they were short staffed. I get it.... but at least try to be professional when paying customers are there.   During the day the place is awesome- it is kept clean and the staff are friendly and courteous. Night time is when it seems to fall apart. The staff working seem nice but you can tell the quality and care is not up to par as the daytime staff."}
{"text":"Ordered 18 wings, fries, 2 beignets & and a drink for $20. The wings were good, the honey bbq was our fav the origonal our least fav. Too much seasoning on the dry rub wings & the fries, they were both very salty. The ranch was also odd, too much dill. The beignets were just okay. Would recommend waiting until you finish your wings to order so they are still hot. The service was great but the food just okay. We will try again in a few weeks to see if conditions improve."}
{"text":"Been here a few times now, and I have to say the wings are perfectly crisp yet moist ....I recommend the TWC rub, and seasoned fries... Great combination, and washed it all down with red kool-aid. Service was quick and food was hot, what more could you ask for...will definitely return...AGAIN."}
{"text":"Like good spicy wings so decided to try this place. Ordered to go. They were over zealous in their attempt to educate me about their wings & really didn't give me a chance to talk. Anyway, got home with our order only to find they forgot our Fries that we paid for. I called to let them know they offered me some donuts next time I come in. No thanks, won't be back.  Got the dry rub TWC wings & the Thai. The TWC lacked flavor, where was the dry rub? The Thai were supposed to be spicy but they tasted like honey with no flavor in the chicken.  Paid $20 plus a $4.tip for take out! They have you choose a tip % when you pay. I don't like that but I was the sucker who gave 20% and they still forgot my fries. Apologies are great but we were disappointed when we got home.  So $24.00 for some wings & I'm still starving! Lol! Gotta go eat!"}
{"text":"~OMG~ I thought I could take the heat, but I found out I would be the latest victim of the TWC Atomic Sauce. Misty warned me, even made me sign a waiver. Luckily she talked me into taking the HOT wings home and trying one dipped into Atomic sauce. I will not be making that mistake again. After 2 glasses of milk, I was able to enjoy my Kung Pao & Sriracha honey wings. I love TWC wings, but no more ATOMIC !"}
{"text":"Came for the first time on a mother/son date. We had a great experience. Wonderful, friendly help. The fries are delicious and the variety of flavors for the wings will keep us coming back!"}
{"text":"I was one of the first customers when this place opened and I have to say from then to know the quality of service and the food has dramatically reduced. Went in two weeks ago got 2 orders of wings the twc wings which had no sauce were good the got wings with sauce were atrocious. The young girl behind the counter was also a displeasure to deal with no smile and seemed genially unhappy to be there or to deal with those coming in. She was also verbally aggressive towards the cook. Overall worst experience ever."}
{"text":"I am so disappointed! So many good reviews, I expected better.  First, online order system is very clunky and did not submit the correct order.  I ordered 24 wings, 4 different flavors, they packaged 2 flavors per box, one box had BBQ and Kung Pao together, 2 problems there, packaging hot and mild together and placing a product with peanuts in a box with another product. Peanut allergies anyone?  The wings were tiny to small at best, the garlic Parmesan wings were so dry they almost choke you.  The 2 things that got them 2 stars instead of 1 are the flavor of the Kung Pao and the service, very nice people. The wings seemed to be over cooked and undersized, I may have caught them on an off morning but I won't try again, too many better options around."}
{"text":"Can't say I was impressed. I had heard there were rave reviews about this place and was eager to try it, especially about the Parmesan garlic wings....until I realized they were dry-rub. :/ I'm really not a fan of dry rub; I like my wings saucy and juicy!! But I was told they were  good and decided to try them anyway. They weren't terrible but they weren't great either. I just found myself wishing that they were saucy. The other flavor I got was hot. They were tasty but too hot to really enjoy...I could eat one about every 15 minutes. I have a very high heat tolerance but they were just a little too much. I will give them this- the french fries were excellent. Hot, crispy and flavorful - just the way fries should be!! I would go back if they got the parm garlic wings in a saucy variety. Otherwise probably not. (To be entirely fair, it's not close to me.)"}
{"text":"Great service and great food! If you go you must try the deserts. Food was exceptional."}
{"text":"My first stop here was a very pleasant trip. The food is fantastic!  But, additionally the staff was welcoming and couldn't do enough to make sure we were happy. Thank you, The Wing Counter, for the food and the hospitality!"}
{"text":"Love  love this place. Super friendly and clean. Their TWC house dry rub is amazing. Wish they would put up a couple flat screens in the store while waiting for the order! Definitely worth a try. Hubby and kids have decided TWC is their fav wing place!"}
{"text":"What a fantastically simplistic concept. If you like good wings perfectly prepared crispy with extreme attention to detail in the various sauces then you have found your dream wing shop. Martez was very hospitable, knowledgeable, and had a great attitude, in general. Awesome place!!"}
{"text":"100 times better than wing stop! The food is fresh the wings are crispy and the sauce is amazing.  My favorites are the honey mustard and kung pao. The staff is friendly. Go support this local business!"}
{"text":"IMPRESSIVE, all I have to say is Wing Stop has a major worry. This place served us with a wonderful welcome, they encouraged us to sign up for their bonus program, greeted us by name, provided us with great suggestions on wings, and the southern donut dessert was to die for. The other very awesome thing was the drink selection, Kool Aid??? That was so awesome, they had 3 flavors, and I have never been so excited to eat wings and drink.  I was very impressed with their level of service, how good the wings were and how fast the service was. Plus the wings were meaty! That place is awesome, and best of all I got a text after that provided me with my points incurred and a future discount! AWESOME!"}
{"text":"This place had some very delicious wings...the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because some of them seemed a tad bit overcooked. The flavors are very tasty. We had the siracha, Thai and honey BBQ - I think it was. We also had the little dessert puffs with the powered sugar on them ...mmmm yummy! I'd eat here again for sure."}
{"text":"Great experience and yummy food.  Owner and staff were very friendly.  I liked that they offered samples of the sauces before ordering.  So many choices that sounded great ... it was nice to be able to taste before deciding what to get.  We had the mango habanero, honey BBQ, Thai chili and the TWC dry rub.  All were very good.  The seasoned fries and sweet potato fries were great too.  The owner gave us a sample of the coleslaw and I will definitely be ordering that next time.  It's vinegar based with great flavor.  The ranch was not my favorite.  It's kind of like a dill dressing (more runny than thick - would be good on a salad); however, it didn't matter because I liked the wings by themselves.  I like that you can order in smaller amounts than a dozen if you're not that hungry.  I will definitely be back.  It's nice to have a wing place nearby that you can grab some to go or sit down and enjoy."}
{"text":"great place. great food.  my son and i loved it. will come back again soon. I'd recommend to anyone who loves wings."}
{"text":"Martez was awesome! I hope I spelled that right. He prepared my wings for me, let me check out the ingredients as I have an ulcer that I am healing and I need to make sure I eat things in the proper proportions. Everything was good. I didn't eat my wings for a while as I had errands to run. But when I had them for lunch, they were still flavorful if not hot anymore. They were plenty hot when I picked them up, you could feel it through the bag. Really enjoyed this encounter with everyone at Wing Counter and I plan on returning when I can."}
{"text":"Come try the buttery dry rubs!  There is much more to wings than buffalo sauce.  These are quality wings with a great variety of rubs and sauces.  I tried the house wings, TWC dry rub, and the mango habanero.  The TWC was amazing and the other was fine, but the taste combo did not work for me.  The guys at the counter were very friendly and Jaris, the Manager, made a special effort with almost everyone.    Minus one star for the bare bones decor and deep fryer atmosphere.  Order to go or bring a magazine because the wings are worth it!"}
{"text":"Awesome wings!  Had the TWC rub everyones been raving about.  Damn good.  Crispy outside, juicy inside, made to order, and the best part of all lots of drums and very few flappers.  I tried the atomic sauce and it is hella hot.  Not just hot.  Hella hot.  Fire.  Be careful.  The honey mustard was okay, and the sweet thai chili was a disappointing. It tasted straight out of the jar.  Their ranch was really good.  Had some fresh dill going on in it.  Nice touch.  I would definitely come back and recommend it to others."}
{"text":"Best wings in Arizona!! Amazing bone in and boneless wings. They let you sample all the sauces before you order. Homemade ranch and blue cheese. Sweet potato fries were amazing"}
{"text":"My friends and I tried out this place and it was pretty decent. Their TWC dry rub and their Siracha honey were our favorites. We also tried their garlic Parmesan and the atomic flavor. Sweet potato fries and the seasoned fries were pretty good as well. It is good that they provide a side of ranch.   Really big warning: the atomic flavor burns your lips. There is a reason why they have you sign a waiver. Your drinking cup of koolaid or water will become your best friend by the time you are done with that. Be prepared to get up and refill multiple times. Also be prepared to use that napkin dispenser like crazy. PSA: make sure to wash your hands thoroughly after handling the atomic wing. Do not rub your eyes unless you want a good half hour of that burning spicy sensation."}
{"text":"I love wings. The Wing Counter does a fantastic job seasoning their wings. The wings are packed with favor. I often crave more after eating about six wings. The kool-aid is amazing. Grape kool-aid and wings make a good combination. The prices are average. It's about 5-6 dollars for six pieces of wings. I'll come back as often as I can. Located next to the Asian market that I go to."}
{"text":"I came here because I don't like wing stop and I love wings. Buffalo Wild Wings is cool but nothing to go crazy for. So when I saw this place on Yelp I got excited because it's right by my house and anywhere I really go. Saw that the TWC and Sriracha honey wings were recommended so I got those and honestly they were good but nothing to go nuts for. The place was clean and the Kool-Aid option is cool. You get a \"free\" drink when you get fries with the wings but realistically it's like making it a meal so truly it's not free because 2$+ for a small side of fries is expensive especially adding a drink to it. The ranch is not thick and has dill in it. That's what I'm guessing. Wings were cool, customer service was cool and the place was clean. I recommend over wing stop and Buffalo Wild Wings."}
{"text":"I am a very big wing critic! Over the years wings have been placed on the same level as a T-bone steak with how cost has risen! Back in the day wings were .25 then .35 and at .50 cents we were like wow.... Now that they are about a dollar a piece, I still eat them. A lot!   Recently I stopped into TWC for an event benefiting service dogs. It was great to see a local business supporting a local cause. My wife and I split a variety of regular and boneless wings with fries. The quality of the wings was above par. My favorites were the TWC dry rub. The fries were very good as well.   I would highly recommend this place for wings!"}
{"text":"I've been looking for not just a good wing place, but a GREAT wing place in the area and have finally found it. I've tried the other places in the area and none of them are worth a damn. But this place? Not only is it the best wings in the area, but it's the best wings I've ever had. I've had buffalo wings in Buffalo, NY... These are even better. The people who work here are beyond friendly and helpful and their wings... OH GOOD GOD THEIR WINGS. I had the spicy thai chile and the honey siracha with the sweet potato fries and the INSANELY GOOD Blueberry Koolaid Lemonade. My only complaint is that the experience was too good. Seriously you guys, how am I supposed to eat at other places now? I'll just sit there eating, no matter how good it is, thinking of The Wing Counter.  If you like delicious, mind blowingly good wings, even if you don't you STILL love this place. Bravo I say, bravo."}
{"text":"I tried their seasoned fries and original wings in got! They were really good. Their beignets are amazing. I ordered seconds!! Must try!"}
{"text":"definitely better wings/flavors than bw3 and wing stop, however the only thing I didn't really like too much was the over use of dill . they use it in their twc dry rub, they also use a good amount of it in the home made ranch. I'll have to hit up wing stop next time to give a final verdict. They definitely get extra points for fast and friendly service, which is definitely hit or miss at wing stop."}
{"text":"Ordered boneless and bone in with a few different sauces. The wings were nice and crispy served with homemade ranch! Seasoned fries and beignets were yummy as well."}
{"text":"Holy cow hottest wings I've ever had I couldn't even finish one amazing I've never had a wing that was to hot until today!"}
{"text":"I am a big fan of yummy, crispy wings and this place definitely satisfies that craving. The restaurant is clean and bright. The staff is friendly and welcoming. They have many flavorful options, and their \"scorching\" buffalo wings are some of the tastiest HOT wings I've ever had. All in all, I highly recommend this new place.   It's so good I thought \"wingstop, who?\""}
{"text":"The wings are just OK in my opinion, s bit on the small size and priced too high. I will not go back after trying it twice .    Well, just to give you an update here goes. After writing my not too flattering review, Sheri the owner wrote me a very nice email inviting  me to come back for another wing try $$ on her. Nice.  Now I'm not the kinda guy who eats something I don't like even for free but I found myself at Kols yesterday, hungry and in need of food so hey, why not . Well true to what Sheri said when I told the guys at the counter that I was the guy who bitched on Yelp they hooked me up with some wings, sweet potato frys and a drink. You know that expression, \"third times a charm\". Well it was because my lunch, free or not , was super good and for sure I will be back.  Delicious food, friendly great service and Sheri I want to thank you and your guys for a wonderful lunch.  Mal Cooper"}
{"text":"I've been here twice now, and each time I have not been disappointed. Perfectly cooked wings, delicious sweet potato fries, and top it off with the Kool-Aid fountain.   I've tried 6 flavors (TWC Style, Garlic Parmesan, Honey BBQ, Thai Sweet Chili, Teriyaki, and Sriracha Honey). By far the Sriracha Honey is my favorite, the heat followed by sweet just is amazing.   I recommend this place, and also check groupon for a great deal for here."}
{"text":"This wing lover finally found what is now his favorite wing joint, and I'm so glad this is in the same commercial complex as my one of the Asian supermarkets I frequently go to for grocery shopping. My favorite here is the TWC wings; these, together with seasoned fries, make a sensation for the tastebuds so pleasurable it seems that such a combo should be banned ;)  A simple uncluttered menu, delicious food, friendly service, reasonable prices, a very clean environment, convenient location ... for me, the only thing about this place that detracts from perfection is the lack of WiFi (as of this writing), but that's not a significant enough reason to prevent me from giving this place a 5-star rating."}
{"text":"TWC wings is amazing and has a wide variety of choices for everyone. I plan on making TWC my choice of wings for every game."}
{"text":"If you're a fan of chicken wings then you've gotta make your way over to this place. These wings are to die for... Ok well I wouldn't go that far but seriously they are the bomb. You gonna love it here I guarantee it.  Best wings I have ever had and nice friendly service to."}
{"text":"Best wings in town  I recommend lemon pepper rub and the sirachi honey  Staff always friendly and place always clean  Hidden gem."}
{"text":"The seasoning is good though is all spice with little flavor left to savor. This is my second time here having tried both the original and honey BBQ. A little on the pricey side for what it is but hits the spot."}
{"text":"Edit: Updating to three stars. The owner contacted me about my review and offered 24 free wings as compensation. I politely declined, because that's not what I want. I agreed to try it out one more time and we did. And frankly came away underwhelmed. The TWC wings were so salty that the seasoning could barely be tasted. I took a basting brush and knocked as much of the crust off as I could and put Frank's on them again.  Appreciate the owner's response, but the wings just aren't what they were in the beginning and that's too bad.  Original Review:  I've probably ordered food here about 15 times. It started out really great, first 10 orders and I thought I found the go to place for wings. At one point, I had even submitted TWC to \"Check Please, Arizona\", but they weren't in business long enough to qualify for the show.  I'm not sure what's happened recently, but the quality of food/service has tanked and worse, my last 4 orders have had issues.  I typically order 24 TWC style for my wife and me, and always phone order to go. (See Angela Z's review for what our first ten orders were like)  1) They're stingy with the ranch. Paid for extra ranch didn't get it. Forgot to season the wings. Basically had plain chicken fried in oil.  2) Paid for extra ranch, again did not receive it.   3) Paid for extra ranch, this time I opened the bag. Complained. Employee put ranch on the counter, walked away. No apology. Got home, only 18 wings instead of the 24 I paid for.  4) Stopped ordering extra ranch. I'll just make some at home. Get home, 20 wings instead of the 24 I paid for. Again have plain wings instead of TWC seasoning. I sauced them with Frank's red hot so that I'm not eating bland wings.  I AM NOT going to deconstruct the to-go bag in the middle of the restaurant to ensure I'm getting what I paid for. I'm not going to complain repeatedly and be viewed as a jerk customer. TWC has lost our business."}
{"text":"Came in for the first time tonight after driving past a few times earlier this week. Ordered the hot and Thai sweet chili flavors, and both were amazing.   The hot has more flavor than normal everyday hot wings, and the Thai chili were really flavorful as well. More so than other Thai chili that I've had before.  The staff were really helpful when ordering and were talkative when we were waiting for our wings to cook. What can I say, other than every aspect of our visit was  excellent. Wingstop who?"}
{"text":"The wings are fantastic! The choices of dry rubs and sauces are plentiful. I was a little skeptical on choosing their signature TWC rub but was so happy I did, it was excellent! This place is small but the atmosphere works. The wings are airy and crispy, the seasoned fries are great as well and are a must try. My order consisted of the original buffalo, parmesan dry rub and TWC rub. I was extremely happy with my choices, and will be bringing my family here in the near future."}
{"text":"I wish they were closer. Finding a wing spot with good food is a big plus (and hard to do IMO), but as a fellow local small business guy, what really caught my attention was the service.  Not only how they were with me, but how they were with everyone I saw come in while I was there eating.    I see some comments in other reviews regarding the pricing - but to me you get what you pay for (if you're lucky) and with TWC I feel it's easily worth a couple of extra bucks compared to other places to get great food, great service and support a local small business joint.  I live over 20 minutes away from TWC and only ended up there because my g/f had a tire blow out near there and we were waiting for it to be repaired. Even with the distance - I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"First of all they have great customer service. They quickly took my order and made sure it was done correct (I order my wings naked/no breading). I tried the Hot and Teriyaki for my first visit. The wings were good sized and 10 was very filling. The hot ones were good but not out of ordinary compared to other wing places. The Teriyaki wings were awesome. I will definitely return. I hear that Sriracha Honey and TWC wings are good so that will be the ones I try next."}
{"text":"Ridiculously awesome wings! TWC dry rub seasoning doesn't disappoint! The wings have a salty, crispy skin that you'll never forget. Dont even get me started on the Thai Sweet Chili! What is even better about this place is the super fun, animated staff. They added to the overall experience. Move over BWW, we have a new favorite wing place! Can't wait to get back here again soon."}
{"text":"I walked in with an open mind and excited to support a local business. The place is clean and welcoming. It is small, however cozy. After putting in my order and asking for my wings to be well done. I opened wings that were slightly uncooked and had this slimy texture to it. And they reeked awful. Don't know if it was the sauce or perhaps the wings were not kept at the right temperature before frying. I just know I wasn't able to eat any of my wings. I ended up giving all 8 wings to the cat and just stuck to eating the fries for dinner. Definitely a disappointment considering the meal was not cheap in my terms. However the seasoning they had on the fries which they called \"house rub\" wasn't bad."}
{"text":"Stopped in after work because a good friend was already there with coworkers and suggested I do a quick pit stop on the way home. By the time I arrived, group had finished their wings -- they looked and smelled fabulous! Group and myself ordered Beignets. There is no place that can compete with  the Beignets from Café du Monde in New Orleans but this place comes pretty darn close! I loved every bit of my heavenly pastry. I will definitely be back for Wings. Cheers***"}
{"text":"The Wing Counter has some of the most fantastic service and food I've experienced. I highly recommend their TWC chicken, with or without the bone, and seasoned fries. The Lemon Pepper and Garlic Parmesan chicken are also among my favorites!  Going inside, you're greeted by the Wing Counter employees who will walk you through the process of ordering, and you can even ask to taste some of the sauces! Everything I've had so far has been absolutely delicious. The employees here remembered me after one visit, and have been kind and social every time.   As an added bonus, they have Kool-Aid on tap, which tastes delicious, especially on a hot Arizona day.  Overall, 5/5 stars. I've eaten here about 6 or 7 times here, and have brought friends and family who have all loved it. It's great if you're looking for something quick, easy, and delicious."}
{"text":"OH YES!  I was very pleased with the service. I was greeted in a happy tone when I walked in.      The wings were really good!  The best part was the customer service!  Keep it HAPPY guys!! Thanks!!"}
{"text":"This place is hands down better than wing stop. Which I did not believe I would say for a long while since wing stop is pretty darn good. Their process is very similar but I think it's the mixture of sauces they've really got right here. The smaller operation makes it more finely honed. Their special TWC spice is fantastic and it's also what they use to season their fries. If you're looking for great wings this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Clean, Friendly staff, Great Wings! Now, I've been in 2 times, first time, I got 6 Atomic Wings. Even after all the warnings....I still got 6 of them.....SIX....I got through 3 in about a half hour and threw in the towel. Second visit, I get 1 atomic wing, and 5 habanero mango(I think mango), yep, still CRAZY HOT, Chile-Heads out there, I implore you VISIT THIS PLACE! These suckers are H O T! They taste like pain. Make sure to order some fries w/ Bleu Cheese Sauce, you'll need it."}
{"text":"This is going to be my favorite wing place!!! They were perfectly crispy just the right amount of sauce! We wanted sweet and spicy and we're recommended the Sriracha honey and the mango habanero they were on point! We're excited to go back and try their other flavors!!!!"}
{"text":"Great staff, wings were overly saucy, and not crispy. I could've just ordered a bottle of sauce, and the spice dill was in everything!"}
{"text":"Ok. I'm a wing fanatic. I've eaten wings all over the country. I eat at all the usual spots around Phoenix, Scottsdale, etc. I stumbled upon TWC with my wife. These wings are OUTSTANDING!  They were fried perfectly. The chicken was crazy juicy and tender when I bit into them. The TWC dry rub, and lemon pepper are amazing. The hot sauce was outstanding as well. My wife loved the fries. The staff are super friendly and are very proud of the product that they are proud of. They e got a fan for life!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This is a great new place for us!! It's got 5 tables inside and seating outside. Very clean and I love the way it is painted inside. They should be getting their liquor license soon, so my husband will be more interest in eating there when he can enjoy an beer with his crispy wings. I tried three dry rub flavors (TWC, Lemon Pepper and Garlic Parmesan) and was able to get all flat wings. :) My husband and daughter had the Original wings (all drummies).  We also had their seasoned fries and some beignets...all were delicious. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I really had high hopes for this place, but the wings were a huge disappointment. I got the boneless, but they honestly tasted like tyson wings from the grocery store. I tried 3 different sauces, and all 3 were just basic and underwhelming. The ranch was the worst part. They had used extra dill in there, and it tasted like a weird Greek Tzaziki sauce. Not great with wings at all. The only reason I gave 2 stars instead one one was the workers were so kind, and helpful. As a new place, they need to change a lot to ever get me to return again. Sorry"}
{"text":"Awesome wings! Great service! I love HOT food; they make you sign a waiver for their Scorching wings...they are something serious! I have to say they are THE BEST WINGS AND SWEET POTATO FRIES in the Phoenix area!"}
{"text":"Food is delicious and service doesn't get any better! Wings are crispy and they have several interesting sauces to choose from!"}
{"text":"The wings where very good. The Beignets were very good too.  The Wing Counter was very friendly. This restaurant was very clean the employees were very courteous and very helpful in making decisions on the wings.    Far better place to go then wing stop down the street ."}
{"text":"The concept is great and the place is simple and clean  The staff is nice but scattered.    We tried every sauce n rub   The hot sauces are not distinguishable.   For instance we could taste any honey and way too much cracked pepper...  The rubs - especially the house rub is WAY too SALTY!     The fries need to be cooked in clean grease and not the same fryer as the wings...  If they can adjust those things...they will have a home run on their hands.     Hope it happens!"}
{"text":"Decided to try this place out last night for dinner. I picked up an order of the \"house\" wings (TWC wings with dry rub) and an order of the Thai Sweet Chili that are sauced. Both orders were the wing-in type and they did a good job at giving us a mix of wing types in each order too. We also got an order of the seasoned fries that we enjoyed. I did see other comments that the fries get soggy if you don't eat them right away; however, 5 minutes in a 400 degree oven and then 2 minutes under the broiler got them back to a nice crispy texture so you can take these to go if you are okay with a little post heat-up. They seem to really like to season food and ranch with dill (at least pretty sure that's what it was); I really enjoy dill so that was good with me... just something to note if you don't like that flavor. Not sure if they offer any dipping sauces without that flavor profile but if you're not into it then I would suggest you ask ahead or get your dipping sauce elsewhere.  Did you know you can order online? This can be very useful during peak ordering times. You can order direct from their website or you can order through the Yelp ordering button... the guy at the counter said that ordering direct from their site is quicker since you don't have to wait for the text confirmation from the third party.  Anyway, with about 20 base flavors to try with your wings, I can predict frequent visits to this place finding my favorites. One more little perk; when I picked up my order, they asked if I wanted a drink (apparently included in the meal?)... happy news to me."}
{"text":"Really great wings are about as common as narwhal sightings if you ask me, so I was pretty skeptical when The Wing Counter opened near our house. I've tried, and been disappointed by, just about every pizza and wing place in the valley.    You may accuse me of having impossible standards, but I think it's important that great wings have a few essential characteristics - like being the right size ( somewhere in between a humming bird wing and an Olympic Athlete chicken leg drumstick), having a crisp/crunch to them, and of course, having great flavor. I also like them 'saucy', which should not be confused with 'greasy'. Lastly, I gotta have good, thick, cool, creamy, ranchtastic ranch for dipping. And lots of it. I don't care if you gotta charge me, just gimme enough ranch, man!   We've been to The Wing Counter (TWC) probably ten times now, and the place has yet to disappoint me. The service is fast and friendly, and they are happy to give you the rundown on the different styles and even give you a sample if you're not sure what to order. They have a signature \"TWC\" style of wing that's very popular - for good reason.  The \"TWC Style\" nails all of my basic wing requirements: They are a perfect size, they have a great seasoning blend that has just the right mix of saltiness and herb flavor (including an unexpected but delicious hint of dill), and they are crispy and never greasy.  And oh, the generous portions of delicious, dill-y, ranch-mazing, house made ranch.  I think we need to bring back #Winning, and instead of it being about Charlie Sheen, let's make it about this ranch.   This is not a place you'd come for a nice, sit-down dinner out, but if you're looking for great wings and fries, this is THE place to go in North Phoenix to satisfy your wing craving.    PS - fries don't travel well in Styrofoam boxes people. And we know this. They make amazing wings here folks, not miracles. Enjoy those fries in the restaurant, or else just know that they'll be a little soggy by the time you get home. Don't worry, you'll still want to eat them (to sop up whatever is left over of the ranchtastic goodness after your wings are gone) - but just get your expectations set that fries don't travel well (from here, or anywhere else...) and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"We have found our absolute go to for wings! They have a great variety. The wings are bigger then expected,meaty and crispy. They travel well for take home (from Glendale to Avondale) and I'm sure leftovers would even be good if we had some Very generous on the veggies and dips. Love the kool-aid."}
{"text":"Yes! A great buffalo wing place has been added to my favorites! On my first visit I tried the hot wings with ranch and celery/carrots. The flavor of hot sauce was packed with flavor and had the perfect crisp skin to soft meaty ratio. The wings came out steaming fresh but were not so hot to burn my tongue.  The ranch I think had cut up chives in it?"}
{"text":"Loving the dry rub recipe. They came out quick and were amazing wings. The whole restaurant is nice and clean and the staff is great too. If I want some good wings I'm going there"}
{"text":"I spotted this place one night while my wife was shopping nearby and decided to check it out. The place was bustling with customers so I decided to try this place out the next time I was in the area. The lunch business is sparse. I was the only customer in there during the time, except for one pickup order. They were trying to sell the Siracha Wings but I'm not a big fan of Siracha. So I placed an order of 10 wings and split it between the TWC (The Wing Counter) rub and the Kung Pao flavored wings. Btw - the people behind the counter were very helpful.  Both of these flavors were excellent. I would say that I probably enjoyed the TWC rub the best, somewhat salty but delicious. This was actually my first time going to a place that mainly sold wings. I was a little taken aback about the pricing. I believe I spent about $13.66 for ten wings and a soda. This place sells beer and other sides like sweet potato fries, etc."}
{"text":"I can't say enough about this place. Martez (I think this was his name but probably butchered the spelling) was amazing! Gave us the whole run down and convinced this hardcore boneless wing girl to branch out into traditional wings. They were amazing!!!! I always stick with honey bbq but tried the twc rub and my mind was blown. The sweet potato fries and beignets were just as delicious and the service was enough for this to become our new spot!"}
{"text":"It was the 3 of us after a day of golf and hiking. we were hungry and we wanted wings. We checked yelp and this place was close and highly rated. So we pulled up and took a seat in the well lit dining room after we ordered up 36: 4 flavors, 9 per flavor. TWC dry rub, original, bbq and honey sriracha. Celery, carrots and blue cheese came as sides. We added regular and sweet potato fries as well as fountain sodas to the order. It took about 5 mins for the order to arrive.  We were all very happy with the quality and taste of the meal. The wings were large and juicy as promised. The portions on the fries was ok, and could have been slightly larger. but they're good, so next time I'll get two and try the seasoned variety. the one thing we would have liked more is to have been able to try more flavors, but we're like that. The beignets with caramel dipping sauce at the end was a nice treat. We had a pretty nice time. If you're into wings, try this place."}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of wing shops because we are usually disappointed. This place is so freaking good. We drove out of the way to try this spot and it will be a regular. The manager and staff are super chill.   Warning the scorching is the hottest sauce I've ever had in my life and I'm a hot sauce enthusiast."}
{"text":"The staff is very friendly and kind. The only thing I noticed, while waiting for my meal, is the staff itched their nose, neck and head. I know it's hot and it's hard not to itch, but just make sure you wash your hands after.  just a friendly reminder. I'll still come again. Food is excellent. Great customer service."}
{"text":"This place was AMAZING ! The wings were extra crispy & the customer service was fantastic . Everyone was very nice and friendly . They let you sample the sauces before you get them. The prices are not bad at all, especially for what you get .   I got the TWC style wings & they were my favorite (I usually do not like dry rubs but this one was great ) . The beignets were sooooo good too !   I will definitely be back and letting everyone know about this place ."}
{"text":"First time in today thanks to a Groupon.  Eric was behind the counter and was a fantastic help.  He recommend the TWC wings which were probably the best flavored wings I have ever eaten.  He also recommend the sirccha honey wings.  They had a little heat but a really good flavor (I told him I did not like super spicy).  My son ordered the hot buffalo which I made the mistake of trying.  Great flavor but my mouth was burning for 15 mins.  We will definitely be back and I think a double order of the TWC will be on top of the list.  EXCELLENT!"}
{"text":"This place was the bomb when it opened and it's still tasty but.. The size of the wings have decreased, the flavor has decreased and do not order the salad. It's literally a handful of greens for like 4 bucks. I called them and complained to no avail. I hope they do some quality control because they were like the best wings ever."}
{"text":"Quick service, fun workers, and the wings... So good!! I had yet to find a good wing place here in Phoenix, and who knew I had to come to Glendale! Living so close to this place is going to be bad for my wallet, but amazing for my stomach. We will definitely come back here."}
{"text":"My friend and I split some wings and fries. Not too shabby!! I really like the TWC wings. Sriracha honey was good too!"}
{"text":"This is a cheap knock-off of ATL wings. I imagine the owners must know each other because these unique restaurants that only serve wings and fries are a new concept.   I really wanted to like this place since it is closer to my house than ATL, but I did not like any of the flavors they offer for their wings. No medium? You should always offer the classics and yet, they don't. And what they consider mild just doesn't taste right. Its more of a Louisiana-inspired hot sauce than a Texas Pete's/Red Devil type of hot.  The french fries were excellent.  The store is so small, after eating there, my clothes were soaked with the smell of the deep fat fryers. I had to take those clothes off and put them in the washing machine right away, as they reeked so badly of the fryers it was even smelling up the clothes hamper. They definitely need to improve the ventilation. Prices were also a bit steep but the staff was super friendly and had a great attitude."}
{"text":"Eureka, I discovered a new cure for my chicken wing mania!  Started off the New Year with a craving for some chicken wings, but didn't want the same old tired and unappetizing places.  I found an ad for The Wing Counter and thought I'd give them a try.  Turns out they're a winner!  These wings were just what I was looking for.  I was greeted by the friendly staff and they immediately gave me the low down that set me on a path to chicken wing bliss.  After contemplating the many different favors offered I decided on a dozen wings with the \"recommended\" TWC rub.  I combined my order with a coupon for free french fries and a drink (great deal).  My wings were cooked perfectly.  Crispy and lightly seasoned with no greasy taste.  Add a little of the house made Ranch with dill dressing and it hits your flavor funny bone, oh so good.  The seasoned french fries were crispy and cooked more than I like, but were good none the less.  Drink selection was nice, self service, with several kinds of Kool-Aid as well as other fountain drinks.  Can't wait to go back and try a few of the other flavors of wings."}
{"text":"Love their wings.  Love the TWC and the original Honey BBQ.  Great sweet potato fries.  You can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"The service was great and the food quality was superior when comparing to many national chains in the valley.  Hoping a location comes to NE Phoenix area in the near future!"}
{"text":"Best wings in town! I'm so happy this place opened up - it's literally a 6-minute drive from where I live. They have good size wings; better than B-dubs and Wingstop. I highly recommend the dry rub, which makes the wings crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. We had 6 of the TWC style wings - very flavorful and fragrant. We also had 6 of the lemon pepper wings - also very well-seasoned and equally delicious. I had extra sriracha honey wing sauce on the side as additional dipping sauce, and it was simply delicious. Love the sriracha honey sauce! The seasoned fries were pretty bomb; it would have been perfect if they were a tad bit crispier. To top it off, they have kool aid here: fruit punch, blue raspberry lemonade, and grape berry splash. If you're in a dilemma, get the fruit punch - soooooo gooooood with the wings.   Remember to check-in to yelp. You'll get free carrots and celeries with your choice of ranch or blue cheese. Friendly and fast service. I'll definitely be returning."}
{"text":"The place was okay, we eat wings everywhere we go. Our spicy wings werent spicy enough. The wings were crunchy and crispy that's a plus, but they lacked flavor. The wing flavors I orders was sweet Thai chile, sriracha, and mango habanero (I'm not sure what their names were exactly).. My kids ordered the medium wings and it seemed the medium wings were spicier than our wings. My kids weren't fond of the ranch dipping sauce. The fries were good. They sounded interesting but I didn't try any, koolaid mixed with vodka and tequila. They had grape/vodka, cherry/vodka, and blue raspberry/tequila."}
{"text":"Excellent service and amazing wings! The managers know their flavors and give great recommendations and sauce samples. Loved the TWC and Sriracha honey."}
{"text":"Really good wings. Very friendly service. I had to wait a little bit and got some free wings for my time. Fries are ok and the bbq sauce was a little thicker than id like but still good. They have kool aid which was great"}
{"text":"This place makes the best wings in town, when ever I have company over to my house we, always order wings from the wing counter they are the best, thank you guys for those delicious wings."}
{"text":"The place is tucked into a corner in the shopping plaza.  The staff is SUPER nice.  I got the boneless chicken wings:  5 lemon pepper and 5 garlic parm, order of fries, and I got a drink for tree with the purchase of fries...  SWEET!  The fries were very good.  Crispy and crunchy...  The chicken was boneless and a little hard.  The flavors are STRONG!  SUPER STRONG.  Almost a little too much.  I maybe should have gotten the actual chicken wings instead.  I will come back to try the chicken wings."}
{"text":"Today two days after Christmas I arrived here at 1030 when they opened, I ordered TWC wings and Lemon Pepper wings and they were not great like on my last visit.  It was dry and over cooked with hardly any seasoning. I told the guy and he said this is how they do it. Nope.... I'm disappointed and probably will have to look for another spot for wings."}
{"text":"The sweet potato fries were old so that was super disappointing. The dry rub had little flavor.  We spent $30 for two people and ended up throwing out the food and eating a jack in the box. We won't be back.  The girl that took our order was friendly and that's the only positive thing I can say."}
{"text":"Ordered the mango habenero combo..so delicious and loved the seasoned fries. The guys working were so welcoming and provided excellent service. We will definitely return."}
{"text":"Not sure what the hype is about. We came here because we saw all the great reviews and thought the wings were just fine.   On the positive side, the wings are cooked very well. They are crunchy and have a great crispy exterior and juicy inside. Everything else though was standard at best.  We had 6 original buffalo and 6 twc dry rub wings. They were fine. Nothing special. Nothing bad. Just normal wings that you could get anywhere.  As a foodie it pains me to say that a chain is better than a small business like this one....but honestly....I would rather go to Buffalo Wild Wings....."}
{"text":"We are driving home now and I couldn't wait to write them a review! This place is great all around!   Staff- there were two guys working when we visited. Both were very helpful! Explained everything, offered samples and signed us up for their points program. They were very nice and we chatted with them on our way out.   Wings- YUM! We actually tried several flavors! Sweet chili Thai, lemon pepper, original buffalo and mango habanero. All were so good! The lemon pepper (dry rub) was my favorite! They were are so crispy and all had a good amount of meat on them! My husbands favorite were the mango habanero. He loved the sweet and spicy combo.  LOVE their wings!   We also got a side of seasoned fries and carrots and celery. Their ranch is different than the normal. It has dill in it and it was really good! Seasoned fries were great too! We were so full after all that great food that we didn't have room for dessert. But the beignets will be apart of our order next time we come in! Love the decor too! Very southern and charming!"}
{"text":"I've been a customer of this place since they opened. Something has changed. The female cashier wouldn't make eye contact, no thank you or the niceties you get from the cashier. There was one customer waiting when I ordered. People started coming in but no one had any food. After 40 minutes I asked for my money back and the response was \"I don't know how to do that \" she called someone and they talked her through it. No sorry. No thanks, nothing. Worst ever."}
{"text":"Honestly....   I wish I could give this place a thousand stars!! Amazing service through and through! The best wings I've ever had, and I strive to find the best! This place was located next to Kohls and got my attention this afternoon so my fiancé and I decided to try it out before a movie. Quick service and we even got to try the wing flavored before ordering. I tried the siracha honey and it definitely had a kick but not what I wanted at the moment. The Thai sweet chili was just right- I got boneless and good thing because they were definitely sticky. My fiancé ordered the honey Bbq and the TWC dry rub. I got sweet potatoe and he got regular fries. Great variety!  The order came out quick and looked soooo good!  The Thai sweet chili was amazing and had just enough kick. The fries were great, I liked mine better than the other, but my fiancé felt the same way about my fries! Depends what you like better :)  The TWC was amazing! I couldn't believe what I was tasting and definitely wanted a million more wings!! Very crispy and amazing seasoning!   We got the cookies to go and they were amazing also! Very fresh!   Will be a definite repeat customer and am already craving more of the TWC!!"}
{"text":"My family and I decided to try the Wing Counter as we haven't found any other place that specializes in wings and fries.  Needless to say, they were fantastic!  The service was great as well."}
{"text":"The wings and TWC fry's where on point, can't wait until I try the Garlic Parmesan!!! We have been looking for a great wing spot! We had the lemon pepper, TWC, and the hot wings Would have taken a photo but they too good to stop eating! I'll take these bad boys over Wing Stop any day!"}
{"text":"Kinda disappointed. I ordered hot, original and honey Siracha and I only got hot and original. Doesn't matter how good a restaurant is, if u paid money and still but u don't get what u want it really ruins everything. I even left a tip... Never again... Is it really hard to get an online order right? How about summarize at when the customer is picking up their order, just a suggestion."}
{"text":"Wow wow wow !!! This is sure a hidden gem! My fiancé and I are huge chicken wing fans. We used to go to B-dubs on the regular but now that we live in az it's not that close and wing stop is our last resort for any chicken wings. Thanks to the great reviews... we made a pick up order. We ordered 18 wings 6 of them were TWC the rest honey BBQ. And an order of seasoned fries.  Omg the chicken wings were soo crispy and juicy full of meat and tons of flavor. every bite was so delicious!  The fries were amazing they were also full of flavor also the ranch that comes with everything was yummy.(don't forget to use their yelp offer that they have for the free celery and carrots) My fiancé even said \"were ordering from them tomorrow they were that good !!\" Seriously can't wait to try all the other flavors they have ."}
{"text":"My wife and I went here last night and ordered a verity of flavors but the best had to have been the TWC style it was so good that I had to go back today and get 36 more and the season fries are great. Thank you for creating a new favorite place for me to frequent"}
{"text":"VERY COOL STAFF!!  Austin showed me the ropes since this was my first time here. He had me sample the original and spicy buffalo sauce - the scorching requires you to sign a waiver due to its strength, lol - ended up going spicy buffalo. They have a wide variety of combinations - 3 rubs & 10 different sauces.   Ended up getting a free sample wing with the TWC rub - not bad at all. Best part about these wings is they are crunchy & moist, packed with a ton of flavor. Definitely found a new wing joint. The staffs willingness to help me decide, cleanliness of this place, & awesome wings will make me want to return real soon. Next time I'll try some desert."}
{"text":"We tried this place earlier this week because we were craving wings. We ordered 12 original, 6 lemon pepper and 6 garlic parmesan and an order of regular fries and sweet potato fries to go. We took them home and the wings were big and we had high expectations. The seasoned fries were very good and the best part. But the original wings are a mixture of flavors that tasted overwhelmingly like black pepper and way too spicy.  I like spicy with flavor, but it was just a bunch of pepper flavor. The lemon pepper was just ok and the garlic parm didn't taste like anything. The sweet potato fries had way too much salt. Maybe I just ordered the wrong flavors. I'm curious about their buffalo and liked the size of the wings so I may try them again."}
{"text":"Friendly service is about all I can say. I ordered 6 boneless wings with the original sauce because I don't like super spicy food. I think I got the super hot wings instead because they were so hot that I have a couple of blisters on my lips and they were so hot that I need tums now. I was only able to eat 1 of them before I gave up. The fries were cold and the ranch is extremely runny.  Not a fan and the price of the combo meal (6 boneless wings and French fries) was almost $10.00. They do give you a \"free\" drink if you order the combo.  Definitely will not be going back."}
{"text":"Came hear after seeing a groupon deal but decided not to use it. Husband and I were very pleased, it's hard to find a place that has the perfect hot wing and this place has it! With many unique flavors that they let you sample. The service was excellent even though it is run like fast food. We will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"We visited tonight for the first time and it was amazing!   We asked for flats only and fried extra crispy and they delivered.  The garlic parm was delish as well as the mango habanero and thai chili.  The guys working were super friendly and helpful.  Coming from upstate NY three years ago, this is first time we have found amazing wings in AZ.  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This place is really great! The honey-bbq is some of the best I've ever had, and the buffalo was delicious. The staff is super friendly and accommodating as well! I do agree with some posters in regards to the ranch being 'dilly', it's a weird taste, but they haven't been open for even a month yet, there's tons of room for improvement on that end. All in all, wings are amazing."}
{"text":"The Wing Counter is tucked away adjacent to Angelina's Pho and next to a music workshop. The location itself is small and there is limited dine-in seating - hence the name counter, but the food is excellent. I visited for the very first time on a Friday night at roughly 7:00pm and it was obvious they were in the middle of a dinner rush. We decided to dine-in and saw a constant stream of customers ordering take out and dining in which was a good sign! The employees were extremely courteous and apologized to each customer for the wait. I ordered the bone-in sweet thai chili wings and my boyfriend got bone-in buffalo style original wings, we also each had an order of seasoned fries. The wings were crispy and incredibly flavorful but what really stole my heart was the seasoned fries, it's a big plus that a drink comes free with each order of wings and fries as well. I will definitely be back to try their lemon pepper and TWC wings!"}
{"text":"We live in Scottsdale and happened to be on this side of town hanging out with some friends. My husband wanted wings and they recommended this place. I didn't feel like wings so only my husband ordered. He got the scorching sauce and I believe the mango habanero. If you love supremely spicy you will love the scorching, but you will probably hate yourself later so beware lol. You will need to sign a waiver for the scorching. We also got the thai chili for my son, he loved the sauce. They ended up giving us some sample with I think it was their house seasoning? It was pretty awesome. My husband regretted not ordering some. It was the perfect amount of crispness on the outside and tender on the inside! By far some of the best wings I've had!! I'm sad they're so far from me, but we will probably make some impromptu visits in the future! (We usually eat at hooters, but they have gotten worse in my opinion. Sometimes hooters wings will end up so greasy you can see pools of oil in the sauce or they'll be soggy. What's the point in deep frying wings if they're going to be soggy?)"}
{"text":"Well the TWC dry rub is pretty bomb but the price of the wings and the fact that you only get one ranch to go with it is outrageous. Not happy about the price at all for the size of the wings either...."}
{"text":"The sauce choices are very unique from other wing restaurants and taste just as good if not better. I was so happy to see that they offered both normal and sweet potato fries. The staff was super friendly and informative and have little spoons to taste the flavors before ordering your wings. I will deffinately be coming back"}
{"text":"I saw the signs for this place prior to opening and was excited to see what they were all about.  Finally got the opportunity and personally...meh I ordered the TWC and the sriracha honey.  The TWC was more like WTS (way too salty). It was as if I dipped my chicken wing in a container of Morton's salt.  As for the sriracha honey, they were better but didn't have the heat that I was looking for.  More like honey dipped wings but not really what I expected.   Finally I tried the beignet (it was tempting since you don't really think beignet here in the desert) and it wasn't really that great.  I understand it's fried dough but still even after the sugar and caramel, it was just really not appealing and a little tougher than expected.  The staff was nice so that helped push it to the rating that I gave.  I'll consider maybe trying it again since maybe all they need is the experience, but at least for now I'll take my chances at other venues."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was light, airy and had a relaxing feeling. Thought it was interesting that they had Kool-aid along with soda to chose from. Staff was very helpful and encouraged us to sample the sauces prior to ordering. The wings were okay. Had the traditional wings that were overpowered with sauce. Maybe ,next time try the dry rub."}
{"text":"Delicious!!! Definitely exceed my expectations, tastes were extraordinary! Will definitely be going back to more."}
{"text":"Had the boneless garlic Parmesan and the boneless TWC and they were not as good as I was hoping. The wings were small and had to much breading. The flavor of the garlic was overpowering and the TWC was okay. My moms first bite was fat. Maybe the traditional wings are better."}
{"text":"Hubby & I were craving wings last weekend and thought we'd try this place( only minutes from our home).We did a drive by late in the afternoon on a Saturday, it was packed! We opted for Pizza that night. Next weekend, we decided to call in our order, I'd pick up on my way home from errands. Wow!! order was ready in10 minutes( friendly staff, BTW)... We ordered an array of flavors and styles..bone- in, boneless , rub,crispy & sauce on the side, and Biegnets!!!.Did I say Wow already?...All were just as we ordered, tasty, crispy and sauces were hot, sweet & spicy as expected. The rub seemed too salty for us, but nice flavor. The ONLY down side, was when I went to pick up..I had to wait for 3 other customers place orders, as I saw our order get packed up and sit on the counter...It was torture!!- the wonderful smell of fresh ,hot wings was making it seem an eternity!!!.. Regardless, we will be placing more orders here!"}
{"text":"Went with a bunch of friends and ordered about every flavor. It was just before the game and they were busy with take out, Its a small joint, it was clean, They hot was not hot enough but there were so many others that we all got full and couldn't decide which was best. Friesd were good too. While it wasn't worth a long drive, the wings were fine."}
{"text":"Best wings I've had in AZ. Owner and staff were very friendly and the food was great!!!"}
{"text":"FINALLY!!!! Chicken Wings like back in my hometown Rochester/Buffalo NY. Delicious - Crispy outside & Juicy inside. Great friendly staff & owners. BEST Wings in The Valley - if you don't think so, then you don't know wings!!! Wing eater from Western NY Since 1979!!!"}
{"text":"Second time here. Try the TWC dry rub. All sauces are great. Good service.  Beignets are made fresh.  Use the caramel sauce."}
{"text":"Worst wings I have ever had, non existent sauce, payed 40 dollars for wings and fries could only stomach about 6 of them, sent the owner and email today got this as a response    We have been in business over a year, have over 150 yelp reviews, and 400 reviews through our Groupon (as well as many review on other websites) We have a 4 1/2 star rating and out of all of those reviews I have never heard that the wings were \"the worst wings ever\".........I\"m really not sure what to say? In terms of the amount of sauce, I guess an employee could have messed up or not have been paying attention, our sauces were created by a chef and most people love them.  I guess we can't please everybody and everyone has their own tastes?  Sounds to me like he cares more about his yelp rating then making his customers happy, oh well"}
{"text":"I was searching through Yelp to try out new restaurants since my husband and I just moved here from FL, and we were not disappointed!  We both ordered the TWC wings and seasoned fries. I requested for only the flat wings since they're my favorite! The wings are so juicy and well-seasoned. The fries were perfectly seasoned. We also tried to beignets, which were yummy as well.   The employees are very friendly and welcoming. My husband and I loved the very easy-going vibe of the restaurant as well.   Definitely would recommend!!"}
{"text":"Great wings!  Crispy and fresh meat.  Loved the TWC style dipped in Scorching drizzled Ranch.  The do have beer (San Tan DA) and looking to add more alcohol per posted permit.  Super nice owner,"}
{"text":"My wife is a huge fan of wings, so we decided to stop by around dinnertime last night to give it a shot. I really like all the varieties of wings offered, and ended up with a plate of Sriracha Honey. They were quite good, but not something I would order regularly. Just my personal taste. I would really like if they added a Hot Honey BBQ option (Note: I didn't even think to ask the cashier if this was a possibility already).  My wife got the hot Buffalo style wings. She loved them. She was especially glad that there is NO EXTRA CHARGE for boneless wings. She said that next time she's going to go for the atomic ones (brave girl, I know).  We both loved the sweet potato fries (I got them salted; they'll ask). They were super good. Will definitely order them again.   You definitely can not beat any place that serves Kool-Aid with their chicken. They're right around the corner from my house, which is great. Prices are totally reasonable. Service was quick and friendly and looked really clean. Overall a top notch experience that we will be repeating in the near future."}
{"text":"Wow I was checking my past check ins and totally forgot to review The Wing Counter?!? I've been hear about 5 times already and have it say it's one of my favorite places in Glendale to eat at. My wife and I are always satisfied when we eat. So happy that a place like Wing Counter opened in my area.   My personal favorite is the TWC dry rub on the boneless wings. The wings are a little small but the dry rub really makes them worth it. I also like the garlic Parmesan rub and liked the lemon pepper. I've tried the Buffalo and habanero sauces on the side and all were good. Personal preference I'll stay with the dry TWC and half of a 12 order being garlic parm. Oh and don't forget a side of their seasoned fried, you won't be disappointed!  Almost forgot they even have Kool Aid so you really can't go wrong. Anyways this I'll be back soon to eat more chicken!"}
{"text":"Heart shaped beignets for Valentines day!!! Even though it was tedious work according to wingman (cook extraordinaire)  the effort paid off in smiles and warm fuzzies for me. I love sugary sweets so I could actually end my review here but you probably want to know more about the wing experience.  The staff were so patient with us as we attempted to choose our wing flavors and sides, we welcomed the guidance which ultimately produced some great choices.  I had the the house wings which were good, the buffalo style were great, just the right heat and lots of flavor.  Sweet potato fries really grow on you, couldn't stop eating them and i usually just have a few fries and quit, not so with these tasty spuds.  One thing for me, which does not diminish our 5 star experience was the seating which I get it because the premise is wings and a lot of take out action, but I like a nice soft chair and a bit more attention to the ambience.  The staff and food were definitely the stars of the show, pun not intended."}
{"text":"ranch is amazing, love the taste of dil in their ranch.. fries are perfectly golden. the gentlemen that work there are nice. wings are extremely fresh --need to get cooled down a bit before digging in, i got the lemon pepper. ill try something more saucy next time but for sure reccomend this place"}
{"text":"My wife and I just came for our second time and have been more than pleased both times. The \"TWC Style\" dry rub is definitely a winner. I ordered a 6 pc combo of all drumsticks and they were absolutely perfect. Seasoning was very tasty but not to the point where it's overpowering.   As if the perfectly cooked/seasoned wings weren't enough, they offer seasoned fries which we ordered both times and they are quite delicious. Fries were an awesome combination of crispy yet still soft in the center.   The only reason I didn't commit to the full 5 stars is due to the fact that when we came tonight, about 45 minutes to closing time, it seemed like they put less effort into it. My wife ordered the sweet potato fries and we had to wait for a second batch to be made because they burnt the first set. The second batch were also on the burnt side but since we love the vibe and the food is still amazing, we weren't about to complain. Overall, this place puts wingstop to bed and that's saying a lot. Well done TWC, well done."}
{"text":"Great place! It's always nice to have a small business open in the neighborhood. This place has really good wings. My dad and I ordered the hot, honey mustard, and sriracha. The wings are very flavorful and crispy. I felt like the were sauced just right. I definitely recommend this place to anybody."}
{"text":"This is the place to go for wings. I caution you on the garlic and Parmesan wings because they are full of raw garlic and very strong. But tasty at the same time. I also had the sweet Thai chili wings which were great. Staff was friendly and the seasoned fries were yummy."}
{"text":"Not worth it we got the teriyaki boneless wings were so dried also the Thai chili wings taste like sauce out a jar... So not worth it! Only thing I enjoyed was the celery"}
{"text":"Great chicken wing place and its close to my house. I am pretty picky when it comes to chicken wings and this place has it. If u like your wings fatty and soggy then move onto another place. I ordered the Sweet Thai chili wings and the lemon pepper wings.  Nice and crispy and flavorful just the way I like them.  They are not the biggest wings I have had but they are among the tastiest.  Skip those chain places,  you know the ones with New York in the title or Wild from Buffalo and give this small business  a shot.  Hopefully they will expand their menu to include more flavors and maybe show some creativity.  Even if they don't, with it being football season I will be back!!"}
{"text":"A very small place but totally worth it. Kind of expensive but like I said worth it. When we were there they're were photographers taking pictures of the food. Even though the staff was distracted they still provided excellent service. It's far from my home but when I'm in the area I will go back."}
{"text":"Very cool concept.   Fast service.  The reason not 5 stars:  The wings not the best size and taste.  Value is better in other places.  And the ranch is not good. They should change the name because it doesn't taste like ranch."}
{"text":"Great place, check it out if you're in town. We were visiting from San Diego and I must say these guys do a great job"}
{"text":"Best wings in the valley!  Fresh, great food with awesome sauces.  A lot of places say they have really hot wings and they're all posers; don't try the Scorching sauce unless you've got a day to recover!  Delicious seasoned fries also.  Neat, clean dining room and nice staff."}
{"text":"The wings were very good!  Had the teriyaki flavor with the salted sweet potato.  Really good!  Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to this place.. im so torn. I am a HUGE wing lover and i wanted to make this place my regular stop because its so close to my house.   To start i ordered 10 wings. The guy behind the counter told me i could get 2 flavors. I picked lemon pepper and original. I really wish they had medium but the guy said closest to medium would be original. They have soo many cool flavors to pick from, but at least keep some originals like medium. Not a bad price for 10 wings 2 flavors and ranch. I also ordered a side of fries seasoned.  It all went down hill when i got my food.. I will say the wings were crispy like i lovee! But when i tried them i did not like the flavors. The original was nowhere near medium like the guy said.. The lemon pepper was pretty good, i didnt mind those. The fries on the other hand felt like such a mistake on my part. Everyone on yelp liked the seasoned fries so of course i had to try them. They were soo seasoned i had to take a napkin and rub it off. I know to not get them seasoned next time. The ranch had the same seasoning as the fries and wings, i mean it was on everything.. which i did not like because too much of one thing is not always a good thing. I wish i could have tried the sauces before i picked them.  I like that they have kool-aid thats a plus! The staff was nice too! Would i be back? I dont really think so.. i so wish my experience was better.."}
{"text":"Great Wings & Great Service. Original Buffalo was very well done w/ a sprinkle of season w/ the sauce. Fries were a bit over seasoned but the employee said they would take the advice into consideration to season a bit less. Kool Aid was really well made and one of the few places that even serve it. All in all a great experience. Will be returning soon w/ friends!  P.S. Midwestern Students get a discount =)"}
{"text":"Their honey sriracha wings were great. They also have Kool Aid on tap which is pretty unique."}
{"text":"This place is alright, I ordered 24 wings with a variety of flavors (Honey BBQ, Sriracha Honey, Garlic Parm, TWC & Hot) my order was to go so when I got home and unwrapped everything I had no clue of what flavor was what because they don't label their wings. I can't tell you about any of the flavors except garlic parm (not really garlicky in my opinion with fresh parm cheese on them) and the TWC (seasoned basic wing, nothing spicy or bland about them). The wings were crispy as I requested but dry in the terms of whatever sauce they were suppose to have on them -  literally there was nothing to dip the wings in once you pick them up now was there any sauce residue left behind in the container like one would expect.   The wings ARE breaded so this place isn't low carb friendly like wingstop. The fries are $2.50 for a size that should be no more than $1.50. I ordered them seasoned and my son stated the fries reminded him of cheese ruffles chips if that helps any. They were fresh, crispy and hot. If you add fries to your order you get a free drink so basically you are paying $1.50 for the fries and $1.00 for the drink in the end. I didn't care for their ranch, it had entirely too much dill in it and it overpowered the sauce.   This place is a solid 3 stars, its a better bargain than wingstop which had become outrageous with their prices. I was hoping I had found a better alternative to usual wing places in the area but I guess not...the search continues.   PS: all wings over 10 pieces you can have as many flavors as you like, but with the 6 piece you only get one flavor option"}
{"text":"TWC!! By far my favorite wings at the moment and have been done this place started business here in Glendale.  A hard fried crisp on the outside, herbs and spices flying at you and then you get to the chicken that is fried to perfection!!  I like to have them with the fresh parmesan flaked on top not melted.  Also If you make it a combo with Fries added to the order they will throw in a free drink."}
{"text":"Fried chicken is good chicken and winner- winner, chicken dinner is this place right on the money! Can I get a hell yeah?  Stopped in for a quick dinner with a friend which allowed us to chose two different flavors and share. We were recommended the TWC wings and given samples of the sauce in which we ended up getting Honey Sriracha for our second set of wings. As for sides we got sweet potato fries and seasoned fries plus fountain drinks.   Decided to do this meal some justice and got myself some red Kool Aid, absolutely the best when it comes to good ol' fried chicken. The TWC wings were delicious! The dry rub allows the chicken to be crisp and seasoned on the outside, but maintains a moist, juicy interior- the flavors were spot on. It's on the salty, savory side in case you were wondering. The Honey Sriracha I did not care much for, the heat was good but honey doesn't seem to balance well with Sriracha's bold chili and garlic flavor, it was very off. The fries here are soo good! Not too salty, cooked just right and you get a good portion even with the smallest size.  The staff and service was quick, the place itself is so clean and cooks up some mean chicken. The place also filled up quickly with diners and seemed to already developed regulars. If I were blessed with a fast metabolism and/or just worked out more you'd probably see me cooped up here stuffing myself with chicken wings and fries. They do have a TV inside for you solo diners as well.  Definitely try the TWC dry rub! I'll surely be back to try more of their awesome sides and other wing flavors."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a Saturday afternoon snack, around 3:30. 2 tables steadily filled, clean and friendly staff! Got 6 Sriracha Honey wings...honey sweet with a tinge of heat. Got 6 buffalo \"hot\" wings....good flavor and a nice soft heat (good choice). Seasoned fries, healthy portion, but over seasoned (too salty). Cut back on the seasoning and leave a seasoning mix shaker out for people who want more. \"Sweetest\" deal on the menu....beignets! Spot on and at $2 for 2, worth it. I know, it's about $1 a wing, but it's locally owned and operated, plus it's cooked to order, with a lot of flavor choices. So, an occasional visit is warranted."}
{"text":"Want mediocre service, sub par food, and long waits? Go to Buffalo Wild Wings. This place is, for lack of a better phrase, the bomb. I tried the Sriracha honey wings - stellar. Sweet and spicy, with all the kinds of tastes I like. The seasoned fries are amazing, the prices aren't to shabby, and the staff are wonderful! My husband and I shared 18 wings, fries, and a Kool aid...so much food we will be bringing home leftovers! My only gripe is there aren't  any beers on draft or at all, but hey, small sacrifices."}
{"text":"What a cool place! The wings were yummy and extra crispy just how I like them. I would have given 5 stars, but my fries were burnt and not really edible. The employees were great and funny, making it a nice experience. I will be back to try out more sauces!"}
{"text":"Excellent wings, with some extra originality. Alcoholic Kool-Aid cocktails too. Their Traditional medium and hot flavors have a totally different taste than most other wing places, in a good way. I really enjoy the Thai sweet chili and Kung Pao."}
{"text":"Very good wings nice to have a wing place. But order the atomic wings at your own discretion otherwise very good delicious spicy challenge."}
{"text":"Warning: when they say hot wings they are freaking hot wings! I like hot stuff and always order hot, but these hot had some heat! Also got boneless srirachi honey and they were really good. Solid wing place, friendly staff, quick service. Talked with the night manager a bit and he was a cool guy. Had kool aid for my kid so he was happy. Got the regular fries and seasoned and couldn't tell much of a difference. Both were good though. Only complaint was the ranch wasn't good. Had to use what I had at home. Or did they give me blue cheese...?"}
{"text":"Pros- cashier was friendly. Beignets were yummy.  Cons- ordered over the phone. Was told I could not order two different sauces on one order and was not given the choice of ranch or blue cheese. However, while I was waiting for my order, I noticed people in line were offered both. I asked for seasoned fries and received plain. I was not automatically offered the free drink, I had to ask for it. Wait time was much longer than quoted on the phone, I don't even think they started making my order until I arrived as the guy in front of me who placed his order in person received his food at the same time I did."}
{"text":"Boneless wings are made of Mechanically separated chicken.... disappointed!  When the whole business is about wings, you expect better quality..."}
{"text":"I had driven by TWC a few times during regular shopping trips and today I had time to stop and enjoy a late lunch. I entered and was immediately greeted by a gentleman behind the counter. He asked if I had been in before and when I replied that I had not, he briefly went over the various flavors and sauces vs. dry rubs then offered me samples of any flavors I wished to try. He suggested the sriracha honey since I mentioned that I like heat.   Ultimately I ordered 6 sriracha honey wings and seasoned fries, which came with a drink at no additional charge. After paying, I saw my food being cooked to order. I like that everything I ordered was made for me and not sitting around. After a short time, my meal was brought to the table and I was offered napkins, ketchup, etc...  The wings were much bigger than I expected, probably because I'm used to getting wings from pizza places where the emphasis isn't on the chicken but the pizza. I was surprised at the crispy outside and juicy, perfectly-cooked meat. I ended up eating only 3 wings and taking the remaining 3 home. The fries were filling and the seasoning was good although abundant. If you haven't had the seasoned fries before, you may want to steer clear until you have tried them because they are heavily seasoned. I like them so the heavy seasoning was not a problem for me.   The food is good and the service is great!This will not become my regular lunch destination for two reasons: 1) the price of my meal was $9 and change. Over the course of a few visits, that gets expensive. 2) Because of the frying, I smelled like the restaurant for the rest of the afternoon. A few colleagues wanted to know where I went for lunch, which I found humorous and slightly embarrassing.   If you want good chicken and great service, try The Wing Counter. Ask to try the sauces and know that it's not cheap but is delicious."}
{"text":"Need wins for your next party?  These guys can hook you up!  Love the honey BBQ!  Many flavors."}
{"text":"2 words. THE BEST! I seriously crave these wings like no other! I think about them ptetty much on the daily. Its probably good i dont live closer because i would be here way to often. I think the price is great. The staff is always friendly. I Really enjoyed chatting with the manager today very great crew."}
{"text":"Had food delivered from TWC just the other day. Absolutely loved their TWC flavored wings! Can't wait to order from them again."}
{"text":"We decided to give Wing Counter another try bc we still had a Groupon that needed to be used. We hoped our disappointing visit a couple months ago was just a fluke, but now I see that isn't the case. We were disappointed in the dryness of the bone-in wings last time, so we tried the boneless this time. That was a huge mistake! They were literally like chicken nuggets and not even good nuggets! What a rip off to pay $18.95 for 18 chicken nuggets! We tried the same flavors as last time and they were just as awful as we remembered. The lemon pepper and twc just tasted like pure salt. The original buffalo is way too spicy to be their 'mild'. The fries and ranch were again decent but we will definitely not be back here!"}
{"text":"Order salad with our wings and got nothin but old brown lettuce. Asked for a refund and was instructed that I had to go through eat 24 for it and all they could do is fresh in up the salads."}
{"text":"These wings are the real deal. Crisp skin with lots of meat and real flavor in the sauce. Not just a dose of spice without real flavor like most wings. Be sure to add seasoning to your fries. Super cool staff made our visit extra enjoyable!"}
{"text":"The best wings I've had in a while,,,,mmmmm so yummy Sriracha honey my new favorite!!!!perfection!!!"}
{"text":"This place has gone so far down hill. There used to be lots of people working here. Tonight it was two. I showed the girl my groupon and she looked at me like I was dumb as she never heard of a group on. The cook was able to work it. Then after waiting 15 minutes we we went outside as the baby was getting restless. The cook came outside and said \"what did you order?\". They had not even started on our food. When we first arrived another customer was trying to get there money back because they had waited 45 minutes. The clerk didn't know how to do a refund. I will only be coming back one more time to use my last group on"}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS NOT CLOSED. They simply changed their name & added items to their menu."}
{"text":"Ordered the TWC Wings Dry Rug and the Teriyaki Sauce Wings.  The Teriyaki were okay but the TWC wings were very good. The Teriyaki wings where on the slightly dry side. The sauce was really not like a Teriyaki flavor.  The TWC wings were seasoned nice and with the ranch complimented the flavors.   The restaurant is small but there is some tables outside. There is a soda machine so it is all self serve.  Would I come back here, not just come out of my way but if I was in the area."}
{"text":"Excellently crispy wings with many sauces available and seasoned fries that rival the best. The scorching hot is insane"}
