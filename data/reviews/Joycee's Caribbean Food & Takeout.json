{"text":"Visiting from the States and craving some good Caribbean food. Found Joycee's on Yelp and I had to visit. The place is near downtown and the food was great. The best thing was the service! Very welcoming and we talked like I was visiting family for a quick bite to eat. I even had an inspiring hand written note on both of my takeout boxes!"}
{"text":"Best Caribbean food in Calgary.  I've been coming here for years. My favorite is oxtail with rice and peas. Great flavor,always fresh. The portion is big (enough for left overs) you also get some nice dumplings, and cabbage to go with it. I always call in my order and it's always ready when I get there. I'm always greeted when I come in. There are a lot of Caribbean restaurants here in Calgary but none of them are half as good. The chicken and roti is great too. All at a decent price"}
{"text":"Established 3 years ago, Joycee's Caribbean Foods is a popular place to stop just off of 1st Avenue N.E.   Specializing in jerk and curried dishes, Joycee's is your one-stop shop for jerk seasonings, salt cod and mackerel, plantains, rice, frozen fish, oxtail and dried hibiscus flowers. They also carry delicious Jamaican meat pies!   Whether you're picking up some groceries or grabbing lunch to go, Joycee's has got enough flavour to get you well into next week ;)"}
{"text":"Ahhh.  Joycee's Caribbean Foods. A little taste of the Caribbean, in Bridgeland. I've been coming to Joycee's and have been recommending the place for at least 10 years, maybe more - in fact it used to be called something else (Joy's??) until a few years ago - but little changed when it changed hands/names. Roti, stews (beef, chicken, shrimp, fish, oxtail, goat....), patties, fresh and frozen goods, spices, odds and ends and snacks from Jamaica/etc.. that are hard to come by, and a little Jamaica culture to boot. Fridays they have a specialty fish dish that never disappoints, but get there early as it usually sells out. Prices are fair, expect to spend a little more for good food. I like the atmosphere, there are a few seats inside if you don't want take out, and the clientele make it worthwhile to stay in and eat anyway.  There is always some music or cultural event being advertised or talked about. Friendly and fun, always a Joy! MK"}
{"text":"How have I not reviewed this place before?  whoops! I go to Joycee's every time I'm on Ed Trail to get a Jamaican patty or two and a ginger beer. Although they're a grocery store selling Caribbean specialties, they also have a hot food section where you can get jerk chicken, oxtail, curries, and patties.   Their patties are the real deal - just like Tastee in Jamaica! It looks like a pizza pop but it's a dry yellow pastry and inside you can get spicy beef, regular beef or chicken, which are sort of like a stew or curry. So it's soft and flavorful on the inside. And get the ginger beer to go with it. It's not alcoholic, more like a soda, but the ginger is so strong it burns so good!  I also can't live without their jerk marinade and their scotch bonnet sauce. Irrie!"}
{"text":"Used to like this place for their patties but the last 2 times Ive been there, they were horrible. A few months ago the patties I bought were full of uncooked gelatenous meat. Yesterday meat was dry, overcooked and horrible tasting. See the pic I posted. For the record I cant eat here anymore"}
{"text":"Every time I drive down Edmonton Trail, I see the sign for Joycee's and I think, \"Ok! I'm stopping in there next time!\" And then the next time I'm driving by, I think the same thing... and again. Well, no more!   Joycee's is part convenience-ish store part kitchen. I hesitate to call it a restaurant, it's more take out food, but there is a high counter with chairs to sit at if you need. The menu is written on a chalk board behind the counter. Jamaican patties, rotis or platters with different meat choices (curried goat, beef, chicken, etc.) rice and peas or white rice. Meals with meat come with the bone still in there and most range from $12.50-$14.00. Remeber to grab a Sof Drink (that's right, no t) from the back fridge  While you wait for your food, roam the 4 aisles. Bitters, rose water, condensed milk, spices and rubs... those are what I noticed. Plenty of other products as well that I need to learn more about. Oh, and cod liver oil above the back counter. I thought that was only something people took like 200 years ago?? I've only read about it in books!   Anyway, take my lead and stop driving by Joycee's thinking you'll stop in next time. It's worth pulling up for.  Tip: It's a laid back atmosphere and no one's in a hurry. And come hungry. My curried goat dish filled me up for 2 different meals!"}
{"text":"This is a solid Caribbean grocery store with some fresh/warm dishes to take out. There is a good selection of spices, snacks, and some meat if you are looking for that Caribbean flavor. Honestly, it's close to a 3.5 for me but I ended up at 3-stars. There is a good selection of groceries and a good selection of take-out food but it just didn't wow me enough to get to 4-stars.   We typically stop by to get some Jamaican beef patties to go. They aren't the best in the city but they are pretty good, and definitely worth it if you want a snack and are in the area. Honestly, the jerk chicken/oxtail/goat are probably better choices but we have a love of beef patties (and generally we are driving somewhere else so trying to eat soup in the car never ends well....)  There are quite a few of these little shops around the city, so if I didn't live near this one then I probably wouldn't drive out of my way to come. However, as I said, it is a solid opinion for Caribbean food in the northeast. The shop workers are very friendly and there is a good selection for its size so next time you're in the area, it is worth it to check it out."}
