{"text":"The first thing i've noticed about the place was that threre was only 4 tables. Didnt seem too busy at the time and the server was very friendly.  Ordered the pho noodle, was very tasty. The soup was flavourful. The flavour of the soup is a little different from most of the other pho places, definitely have their own unique take on the soup.  Overall, a cozy place to visit, with decent vietnamese food. Good to go if you want a different variety of food."}
{"text":"Our favorite Vietnamese in Calgary.  The charbroiled pork is always great.   Some great Pho as well.  Stop in whenever we are back in town."}
{"text":"It's pretty ugly. Really, it's awful looking.  It's got 4 tables and a cruddy little steel bar-height table in the middle, overlooking a plasticky ugly wall and, if you;re really curious, a mop bucket and whatever the heck is stacked in the back. In the kitchen area, which looks a lot like a poorly-laid-put military mess unit, are stained pots and pans sitting on a hodgepodge of various stoves, with occasional hunks of bony looking cow parts floating in them, There are always two really friendly women in there, smiling at you with a greeting when you enter, and after a look around the first time you figure they'd better smile.  I ordered the #10, rare beef noodle soup the first time I went. It was addictive.  I have tried the rolls and other soups (all quite good) and the subs (um, sorry, not great) and every time I leave I can't help but be pleased at the price.   Now I go twice a week and order the #10 again and again. And again. And again. It's eight bucks or so and really very, very good, and filling. Eat in and take out are both similar enough, but keep in mind they recommend reheating the broth at home to get it back up to near boil to finish cooking the beef and other items, typical cooking style of Pho houses.  So that said I totally discount the looks - if looks and atmosphere were an issue I'd give it one star. Seriously. The nice people might make it a two - tey are rather nice there.  But the food - not miraculous or award winning, but simple and quite tasty regardless the low price - is a rock-solid four stars for the genre. Helps they are within walking distance of home, but I'd drive to it. Go try some."}
{"text":"As much as I want to give it a 3 star, I just can't. I wanted to bring a friend here as it was on the way to Market Mall and we had not tried this place before. I knew it would not be a pretty place to look at (thanks to the reviews) and that there were only 4 tables inside but I was not expecting it to be as bad as it was. Hair on the wall, cheap tables and chairs, the knowing of not to dare look at/in the makeshift kitchen and the barely there service. Meh.  Food was just ok, a pass I would say. I have had better vermicelli bowls. (I had the pork, shrimp and spring roll) My friend had the same.  The cost was under $10 so the price was right but we have no need to return here."}
{"text":"8I love this place! It looks like nothing but the people are great and so is the food. Check it out sometime. I always get 21a but my girlfriend always gets some sort of soup that she loves. The appetizers are wicked. I'm glad this place is close to us."}
{"text":"This restaurant is more like a fast food place with 16 dine in seating and it's located across from Sir Winston Churchill High School.  It's caters to students with take out & quick lunch. It's more like a 70s cafeteria. This review is based on the Beef Stew noodle soup only since the name of this Restaurant implied this bowl of soup.  The soup is good but a bit on the citric side.  Beef stew is very good, tender & tasty.  The egg noodle was cooked right.  It's worth a try for this bowl of soup if you are around the neighborhood."}
{"text":"This hole in the wall looks entirely unimpressive from the outside, and in. Four tables. Plain white walls with cheap art work. I was greeted immediately. The menu was easy to read and understand. I was able to order a heaping bowl of pho shortly after sitting down. The prices are very reasonable. Pho for under $10 - large bowl. The restaurant is quite clean. The pho had a great aroma. I ordered beef with satay. Excellent spicy flavor, firm noodles. The beef still had some pink color, not over cooked. Tender, not fatty or chewy. Totally glad that I came here."}
{"text":"Predictable quality. Nothing amazing here, but it is local goodness at a reasonable price. I can't get enough of the salad rolls and my young daughter loves the spring rolls and wonton soup. Any meat on vermicelli is good with the usual ridiculous portioning that most Vietnamese places do. Dining in is not for the faint of heart. Take out is more common but not necessary."}
{"text":"This is my go-to for Vietnamese food. Their Pho is out of this world! The place doesn't look like much but the food speaks for itself. The beef skewer appetizer is heaven - lemongrass glazed, thinly sliced, grilled, and topped with crushed peanuts. Also their namesake dish is delish! Big chunks of melt in your mouth brisket in a tomato broth with stewed radish and carrot, mmmmmmm!"}
{"text":"This little casual restaurant serves one of the best Vietnamese food I've ever eaten.  Who knew that this little place can whip up hot, steaming bowls of Beef Stew Noodle Soup No. 8.  This is the traditional Bun Bo Kho; the beef is so soft and tender as are the carrots and the white carrots.  The broth is tasty with a hint of tomato in the soup.  It comes rice noodles and the usual platter of fresh bean sprouts, mint and lime wedges.    Our party also ordered  -an appy of spring rolls - really piping hot and delicious and eaten with the fish sauce.     - No. 9 - House Special Beef Noodle Soup  (Large) - heaping bowl of thinly sliced beef, cut up beef balls, thinly sliced tendon, tenderly cooked tripe with rice noodles and onions.  Comes with fresh bean sprouts, mint and lime wedges.  Very good broth and no after taste at all!  I like it! - No 24b - Satay Beef & Spring Rolls on Vermicelli (Bun) - Very, very good bun with nicely marinated satay beef, fresh lettuce, bean sprouts and cut up spring rolls with fish sauce. - No 51 - Beef sit-fried with Bean Sprouts, Onion and Rice Noodles - quite tasty  Very reasonable prices around $9 for noodle dishes.  Very small restaurant with 4 booths.  More of takeout place.  The owners speak English very well and are very pleasant people.  I'm going to try their subs next - cost is about $6."}
{"text":"I'm sorry to say that I found this place way overrated given the reviews posted. It was the true definition of a hole in the wall. Food was mediocre but the owner was super nice and despite only being the only person working she managed to stay on top of things which was a plus. We ordered some spring rolls, vermicelli bowl and pho.  The way I gauge whether a Vietnamese restaurant is a keeper or not is based strictly on their pho. I found the pho to be very salty, lacked depth of flavor, and the broth was not crystal-clear. It appeared that the broth needed to be strained as there were remnants of what I assume to be bone or meat particulate floating around the soup.   The location itself is tiny and seats less than 20 people and feels like you are climbing around and over people to pay the bill or to pick up the orders. Also the makeshift kitchen left a lot to be desired, with caldrons filled with bones stewing and dirty dishes stacked up, made me think twice about eating here.  Had we not been starving and not in the area we probably would've just went and picked something up from the mall across the street.  However, after seeing the rave reviews, decided to give it a fair shot. I rate it a 2 out of 5 on the fact that the prices were cheap so if the quality of food isn't a big deal to you this might be the place for you, but if you prefer a clean environment, more than one server and an overall better dining experience I'd say skip this place.    Calgary offers several Vietnamese dining establishments where you pay a little bit more but the food is a lot better, and the restaurants are a little bigger and a lot cleaner and the kitchen operations aren't in plain sight and often times have more than one person running the place.    I'd say if you were picking up a sub or a vermicelli bowl to go, this might be a decent option if you're in the area but I don't plan on coming back, I've had better pho for a couple dollars more.  Lucky we were finishing up as the kids from the high school across the way were heading in for lunch- it was pandemonium. Definitely need another person helping out to at least bus and clear tables."}
