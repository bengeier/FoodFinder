{"text":"Very good izakaya! Loved the grilled miso black cod, the hamachi sashimi and the green tea tiramisu. Service was excellent! Will return to try out other dishes!"}
{"text":"I love this place.  Food is great and well priced, drinks are good, ambiance is awesome, staff is wonderful.  I bring everyone who visits and they all love it too!  My favourites are their carpacios, karage, udon, takoyaki, short ribs and the cod!  Their desserts are really yummy too!"}
{"text":"I really like this place! The service was very good. The food and drinks were delicious. It's really great if you want to share and taste the menu with friends. If you like sake, I strongly recommend the sake sorbet they serve in the dessert section. It is absolutly lovely!"}
{"text":"After a quick Wikipedia search, the phrase ichigo ichie, which means \"never again\" or \"one chance in a lifetime\", perfectly describes my experience at this restaurant. 

We came here instead of the mediocre ramen place next door because there was a long line (temporary lapse of judgement). Once we got seated, we were left alone for 15 minutes by our server while there were only 3 occupied tables in the dining room. Although After the food arrived at our table quite fast after we placed our order, the bill took another 15 min. 

The dishes were ok but pricey: the beef nigiri was good (although the dressing tasted like instant noodle flavour mix), but at 2 PIECES of sushi for $8! Negima (chicken and leek) and karaage were very flavourful but both were too heavy on the seasoning.

The entire dining experience took less than 50 minutes, which was quick for something that costed ~$50/person. Also the atmosphere didn't feel like an izakaya, the cooks just did their own things quietly while servers were constantly on their iPads."}
{"text":"Ended up at Ichigo Ichie after we were told that there would be a delay for ramen at Yokato Yokabai, however we were not at all disappointed! The atmosphere was low key, the staff were friendly and the food was fantastic. Our server was very helpful with menu recommendations, one of which was the deep fried octopus balls - my favourite dish of the evening. Will definitely be returning to try out the other items on the menu!"}
{"text":"Incredible place. It has everything. The vibe, decor, food, drinks and service. I had the Sake Sangria which was amazing. Sweet but not too sweet. The Sake bloody mary was also great. Aki the manager was really friendly and by the end of the night was having shots with us. Mike our server was attentive and knowledgeable. The seared tuna was amongst the best I have had. The green tea pudding and sake ice cream was also a treat. All around 5 stars."}
{"text":"After trying the Ramen side of this place, we figured we needed to try the izakaya side.

My girlfriend and I split a few different dishes and each one was unique. Ranging from the mushroom noodles, to miso coated edamame, to short ribs that you grill yourself on a hot stone!

All this along with a Sapporo with ginger beer!"}
{"text":"C'était pas mal. Je ne peux donner les 5 étoiles car l'entrée en matière à mal commencé, on a collé à côté de la sortie arrière sans aucune raison alors qu'il faisait un froid polaire. 
Après deux verres de sapporos, nous avons testé plusieurs petites dégustations du menu Montréal à table. Cela m'a beaucoup plu, tout était bon, je reviendrai."}
{"text":"I usually go for ramen there, but I finally decided to try the izakaya menu. I was definitely not disappointed.

Everything we ate was great! I especially loved the takoyaki. The salmon tartare tasted very fresh, and it came with fried wasabi seaweed. I don't usually like wasabi but I enjoyed it. We had the Japanese ice cream sandwich and green tea tiramisu. Their desserts are incredible and it's partly what makes me come back!

The prices and portions are reasonable, I don't know why people complain about it. It's worth every dollar."}
{"text":"Étant donné que le côté ramen était plein, on a essayé le côté isakaya (tapas japonais). 

Le service était inégal. On a reçu les premiers plats vraiment rapidement. On a attendu 20 minutes avant qu'on nous amène le bol de riz (pourtant pas très long à faire) et un autre 15 minutes avant d'avoir le poulet frit et les calmars grillés. On a oublié nos verres d'eau. 

L'ambiance et le décor est bien festif. 

Menu : j'étais avec un ami plus difficile, alors on a pris des plats plus simples. On a essayé des brochettes de flanc de porc, des pleurotes, bol de riz au saumon, calmars grilles et poulet frit. La nourriture est bonne. Les portions sont petites à moyennes. Ils nous ont d'ailleurs suggéré 3 tapas par personne. Rien par contre d'exceptionnel. Le menu offre par contre tellement plus qu'on n'aura pas le choix de revenir. 

Prix : avec un apéro et deux bières, le prix était de 45$ par personne. Le prix de l'alcool est quand même cher pour ce qui est offert. Il faudra cependant essayé les sakés une prochaine fois."}
{"text":"Le meilleur ramen que J'ai jamais mangé ! J'ai beau en avoir testé d'autres depuis, on revient toujours à celui-là. Ils sont classiques, mais parfaitement réalisés et surtout, ils sont personnalisables !
Les portions sont généreuses et le bouillon est délicieux, plein de saveurs.

Le seul point négatif, c'est certainement  le temps d'attente. C'est un endroit connu et très aimé, donc mieux vaut arriver avant le \"rush\". Ou alors, allez patienter au bar en bas.
Les amateurs de whisky auront de quoi déguster en attendant qu'une place se libère au restaurant."}
{"text":"Large variety of tapas to eat with your ramen. The takowasa is a bit salty. The burdock roots and the salmon tartare with the nori chips are a must. I love the fact that you can customise your ramen according to the salt level. 

The service is quite fast and the staff is friendly. 

Would recommend this place if you cant decide between the ramen from yokato yokabai next door or the tapas."}
{"text":"Decent, friendly service and some of the best Japanese food I've ever had. Would come back again in a heartbeat!"}
{"text":"My wife and I were in Montreal for a week.  We were here on a Friday night, and we knew it would be busier.  Well, when we arrived, there was a group of 4 in front of us.  But I noticed a place for 2 at the bar.  Without an attendant or host, we went to sit at the bar thinking it was open seating.  We sat there for a few minutes until someone said we couldn't sit there and had to wait in line.  Well, we went back in line.  After 15 minutes, the group of four was seated.  Then, once they were seated, we took the same two seats at the bar.  I feel like this was unusual, but maybe it was a Montreal-type quirk.

We ordered a pair of beers and some food.  The food itself was okay.  It was smaller portion than what I expected considering the price.

I wouldn't recommend this place, especially if you have had Izakaya somewhere else.  This is really is not an Izakaya in my mind."}
{"text":"Strongly recommended! And reserved a day before or early if you don't wanna wait too long. Big_good_and_nice place, the services are so friendly. The food is just perfect!! Most of food that I ordered I love it, specially the black cod and smoked duck \"can't miss it every time I go\" And before you leave don't forget to try the dessert, you won't regret it"}
{"text":"Alright! I came here to celebrate a friend's birthday as a party of 8. I am a regular at Yokato Yokabai, and this was my first time on this side of the restaurant. If you specifically want ramen, they seat you in Yokato Yokabai, and if you want an Izakaya menu, then they'll seat you in Icho Ichie.

I had their Kinoku Udon, which was well done, but I thought the portions were too small. It was also quite pricey, which I was slightly disappointed about.

I am also not crazy about the ambiance; it is loud, hot, and dark. The server looked like she wasn't happy to be working there, although she remembered our names and efficiently took our orders. 

They do, however, have an interesting 'Ginger Sapporo', which is essentially a slice of ginger in Sapporo beer for a $1 surcharge. 

It was an alright experience, but I was not crazy about the ambiance. The portions are a little small, but very tasty!"}
{"text":"Had an amazing dinner on our last night in Montreal. The Menu is pretty small but the flavor of the food is to die for. Don't expect to get your typical sushi rolls. Everything is tapas style ( small portions). Make sure to save room for dessert."}
{"text":"Happy to find another izakaya in town! The tapas are all super delicious as well as their cocktails. We went with a group of six so that we were able to order a good variety and enjoyed more options. They also have quite a large selection of sake. In the end we all got pretty drunk but had such a great time. Supposedly they are a complex of three sections - this one for tapas, another for ramen, and a bar. Look forward to try the others next time!"}
{"text":"J'adore cet endroit. Différentes sections : Izakaya et Ramen Bar. On vous accueille et dit aurevoir en japonais :-) Les tapas japonais sont excellents, servis de manière originale et il y a beaucoup de choix! Mes favoris sont : morue noire (black cod), canard fumé (simmered duck), tartare de saumon avec feuilles de nori frites, kaarage (poulet frit), edamame aux piments et ail (peperoncini), et leurs mochis pour dessert!

L'ambiance est décontractée, beaucoup moins bruyant que Imadake (même proprio). Donc plus facile d'avoir des conversarions :) C'est mon nouveau resto favori!"}
{"text":"A scam. An absolute scam. We live in New York, and good food can be expensive, even for izakayas. But this was an absolute scam. The seared tuna was meh and was basically a tasting. Tempura mediocre. And on top of it, the waitress was implying it was our fault that we had so little food, because we didn't let her help us with the order. Never again."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I are both suffering from colds and wanted some comfort food--what better comfort food than ramen? We both ordered the pork with Kara-miso (their spicy broth) and added a whole egg. Service was fast and friendly, and the ramen was delicious! It had a rich, thick broth, and the pork was so tender it melted in your mouth. The spicy broth had a good heat, but wasn't overwhelming. They also brought out some add-ins for the ramen: hot oil, garlic oil, and sesame seeds. We both ordered cocktails which were okay, but not very memorable. Definitely worth a visit for the ramen!"}
{"text":"This is my second review for my second experience at Ichigo Ichie Izakaya.
Last time we went there we tried ramen, black cod and other small tapas and my first experience was amazing although we had to wait in line a little bit. 
My wife and I decided to go there last friday night, expecting to wait a little but we got offered a place on the second floor of the restaurant which we took right away!
The second floor is amazing looking, with a great atmosphere and decoration. Since it was only our second time, our waitress Bianca recommended us some tapas according to our budget and taste and she hit exactly right! Food and drinks were always on time, waitress was very friendly and attentive. Second experience definitely was amazing and my wife and I were more than happy.
Will come back!"}
{"text":"We got there on a busy friday night. The nice hostess asked if we wanted to sit upstairs while we waited. While upstairs, we had some delicious appetizers. The Negima was our favorite. After about 30 minutes we were lead downstairs to the busy restaurant. Ordering the ramen was quick and we received our food in a timely matter. The broth was delicious and had just the right amount of spices. I would definitely come back here when I am in Montreal."}
{"text":"Heard many good things about this place so I decided to finally try it out. First off, the shime saba (torched mackerel) was fantastic. It was served with torched kiwi as well, which was a strange mix, but the servers torch it in front of you. Quite a show! Though this is only after they forgot about our order and I had to remind the servers. 

Most of the food we ordered were below average compared to other Izakayas. For example their takoyakis were extremely mushy and had very little octopus in it. The menu is beyond overpriced for its quality. 

The reason why I gave it 2 stars was the absolute terrible service. I've never felt so attacked in my life. We were one of the first customers to walk in at opening (5pm) and they were already in a bad mood. At the door, one of the servers rudely told us to wait at the door to be seated, talking over my question, which was \"can we eat Ramen in this side of the restaurant?\". Throughout the night, the servers only did what they had to do, serve the food without looking or explaining the said dish, ignored me to the point I had to foolishly wave both arms in the air to get the 4th waiter's attention.

There were only 2 great waiters this visit that did their job correctly, but honestly, 0 stars on service for the rest of the staff of about 5 people. Terrible terrible terrible. We were expecting to drink and enjoy our time tonight, but instead we felt very unwelcomed and had to finish off our night elsewhere."}
{"text":"We decided to come onto town for dinner. 
The food was amazing!  I highly recommend this restaurant. There has been  a line up at the door all evening and I understand why."}
{"text":"I recall the reason why I loved this place so much wasnt for the ramen but for the pork on rice. The ramen is extremely thick and almost impossible to finish. 

Overall, few selected items on the menu were decent but I will not be returning for the ramen. To be honest I found a much better ramen place therefore I will not be returning to Ichigo Ichie.

Incident that occurred* We had reserved for a table of 12 and before arriving I had specifically asked if they can serve us ramen & the person on the phone said \"yes of course\". So we arrive and they decided not to serve our table of 12 a few bowls of ramen. I find it ridiculous because they've served us ramen in the second restaurant before and all of a sudden that particular night they didnt. So we left."}
{"text":"Amazing food, service and vibe. All the staff here is joyfull and super polite. All dishes have its particularity and all very tastefull. I have been here so many times and never disppointed. You also have to try their cocktails its very original."}
{"text":"The decor, atmosphere and service are the reasons I'm not giving this place 3 stars. Our waitress was nice, attentive and using her iPad, remembered our names and our orders. Our waters were frequently filled up. It's a VERY LOUD and HOT restaurant so if you're a big group around the large rectangular tables on the top floor, chances are you'll only hear the people next to you while sweating buckets. Dress lightly.

Overall, I found it overpriced. I had one cocktail (mango & berry) and ordered the ebi mayo and the albacore tuna sashimi for $43 (including tip). The ebi mayo is essentially 2 shrimp tempura cut up with mayo and some fried noodles... it was ok, kind of bland. The tuna was delicious, fresh and paired really well with the pink peppercorns. I got to try the garlic and pepper edamame which was delicious. The deep-fried calamari appetizer burst in flavour and the beef sirloin rice bowl tasted pretty good. Props on plating too - creative visuals using gorgeous plates. Again, just overpriced. 

Fun vibes, great service and would consider returning if I wasn't paying!!"}
{"text":"After a positive experience, at yokato yakobai, we decided to got here again.  We noticed that they had expanded considerably in terms of their seating and menu.  The place looks more like an izakaya now.  Serving Japanese tapas and has huge communal tables.

The funny thing after paying and leaving the place, we noticed we were eating at a different place.  It's called ichigo ichie, apparently, yokato yokabai and ichigo ichie are joint businesses.  

We had the ramen, chicken karrage and curry potato croquettes.  Everything was all good except for the yuzu ice cream.  The last time we went, the ice cream was memorable.  This time the ice cream tasted like fluffy egg whites.  My cousins said:  \" the ice cream does not even melt!\" :)"}
{"text":"While I was visiting Montreal during my reading week I stumbled upon this place while exploring the neighbourhood. Originally I came in for the ramen shop but I was in the mood for a little drink so came here instead. I got the Pork Belly skewers and Kaarage (fried chicken) and a pint of Sapporo. The food took a while to come out because of some issues with the kitchen so they gave me a couple drinks on the house. Personally I didn't think the wait was that long but hey I'm not one to turn down free stuff :). The food itself was plentiful for its price and delicious. The staff are very attentive and friendly. The ambience is very nice for a small pub. I can honestly say this was the best experience I have ever had in any restaurant/bar and will definitely stop by for a drink or two whenever I'm in Montreal."}
{"text":"After tasting the ramen in the small shop right inside named Yokato Yokabai, I left with very good memories of good ramen from Japan. Remembering this, I was itched to try the other restaurant. And then voila, the moment presented! My friend decided to organize her birthday in that restaurant on a Saturday evening. Being a large group, we had access to the higher floor, where they were able to reserve for about 25 people. 

So let's get to business now! Going in and checking the menu, I was kinda overwhelmed by the prices, I mean 12$ for small plates is kinda a big ask IMO. But that did not stop me and I was determined to try to get my nostalgic vibes from Japan again. After all, I decided to go for a few plates including a plate of beef where you can cook it yourself, a plate of fish belly, and many others that I cannot remember, unfortunately. I have to admit, it was good, but not outstanding, especially all things considered such as the pricing and the amount of food. 

The vibes at the restaurant were also very nice! Overall, I'll give it 4 stars, 1 lost because of value."}
{"text":"I didn't expect this restaurant to be so spacious! The place js nice, a little bit loud but not too much. The food was good and different from other izakaya we've tried. I wouldn't say it's the best though. On the pricy side. Service was friendly and nice."}
{"text":"Décoration, accueil et plats ; tout est de bon goût! Le seul problème : on devient très vite accro..."}
{"text":"Ichigo Ichie has two floors, the basement level only offers Ichigo's menu while the main floor has both Yokato and Ichigo's menus. Thus, you can order ramen and appetizers from Yokato and other Izakaya food from Ichigo. I actually prefer the main floor because I get to order the karaage and gobo from Yokato (I didn't quite like the ones from Ichigo and I will explain later).

During our first visit, we asked the waiter if they take reservations and he said no, both Yokato Yokabai and Ichigo Ichie are under the same system: no reservation. However, once we got there this time, the waiter asked us if we had any reservation... We were quite confused to be honest... My best advice is to get there when they open (5:30 pm) in order to not get caught up in lines! The restaurant gets fill up quickly on the weekend.

We ordered the simmered duck, jumbo shrimp tempura, stone grilled steak, kushimori, karaage, gobo and Yarai style grilled squid.

The simmered duck had an interesting presentation. The waitress told me to get my camera (well phone) ready because the smoke disappears very quickly once she removes the cover! The duck breast was really yummy and tender. It is mixed inside a yuzu sauce and there is a spicy sauce outside the bowl that I didn't try because I don't eat spicy. But I find it overpriced for 5 small pieces of duck meat slices.. 

The jumbo shrimp tempura came with two jumbo shrimps and it was good (but the other time, the shrimps were chewier, I guess fresher). I liked how the shrimps were well-fried (but not over-fried) and the sauce went well with it. It also came with two shishito peppers.

The stone grilled steak's meat was well-seasoned. However, the meat was definitely not steak meat.. It was short ribs (which I like) but I find the menu to be misleading. The stone was not hot enough for two rounds of \"steak\" grilling (but you can ask the waiter to re-heat it). The experience of stone grilling was fun but I wouldn't order this again if I go back.

The kushimori came with 7 skewers: shishito pepper skewer, chicken gizzard skewer, chicken thigh skewer, chicken and leek skewer, Japanese sausage, pork belly skewer and bacon wrapped asparagus skewer. My favorite ones were the chicken gizzard and pork belly skewers. 
-The shishito peppers were not spicy (yay!) 
-The chicken gizzards were grilled to perfection! They weren't hard at all. I loved the texture of it. We ordered another chicken gizzard skewers afterwards because 1 skewer wasn't enough!
-The chicken thighs were tender and flavorful, it was pretty good.
-The chicken and leek was good but nothing special about it I find.
-The Japanese sausage was a big round sausage (looked like crab cake). I don't know what it contains because everything was chopped and all mixed-up. It was good but not \"wow wow\".
-The pork belly was very fat this time. Despite looking all fat, the pork belly's fat wasn't disgusting, it was actually quite chewy! I hate when the fat \"oil\" explodes inside your mouth or when the texture of it is soft and tender... If I had to eat the fat, I prefer when the texture is \"chewy\" and not soft..
-The bacon wrapped asparagus is pretty much self-explanatory. 

The karaage from Ichigo came with wasabi-mayonnaise sauce on the side. The chicken were crispyly fried but not too dry. But I prefer Yokato Yokabai's karaage because theirs is juicier and less dry since they added a yuzu-lemon ish sauce on top of the chickens. 

Yokato's gobo came with a homemade mayonnaise sauce but at Ichigo Ichie, you only have 3 choices of seasoning: spicy, corn chowder or barbecue. Our waitress told us the spicy seasoning is like Yokato's gobo, so we picked that one. It is not spicy at all (trust me, I can't eat spicy). Ichigo's gobo just doesn't have the mayonnaise sauce, but it was still very good! Actually, you can eat it without the sauce and it is still delicious.

The Yarai style grilled squid was my mom's favorite dish. I remember it had a strong charcoal taste which made the squid really tasty. The tentacles were my favorite parts because they were a little bit crispy but not burnt!  

One thing that I find it weird was the ice cream. My godparents ordered ice cream and this time, it came with a waffle cookie (which tasted like fortune cookies). The last time we ordered, we didn't get the waffle cookie nor the pocky sticks... Normally, Yokato's ice cream comes with pocky sticks and Ichigo's comes with the waffle cookie... How come last time, we got nothing but the ice cream scoop... 

Our waiter was attentive and constantly filling up our cups with tea. He also emptied our plates very quickly too. Sometimes, when we had a few pieces left on the plate, he would ask us if we were done, which I didn't like because it felt like he was rushing us to finish our dishes..."}
{"text":"We went to celebrate the birthday of a colleague at Ichigo Ichie, located in heart center of the city and I had no clue that this place even existed!

We were a group of 12 in total and staff service was awesome. I also wanted to say this restaurant is divided in half, where the other half was a ramen bar and waitress recommended for us to try it at another time :)

Within the other half, the menu is has been made up as Japanese tapas and the selection offered is quite large. So much to pick from, we ended up trying everything on menu and all plates were spotting with explosion of flavors.

In my opinion, the pork belly served on a bamboo shell with the wasabi sauce was the biggest winner otherwise the duck and the fried rice delicious.

I will go back to try out their ramen and thanks again for letting us have an awesome evening!"}
{"text":"K. Yokato Yokabai shares this building? Anyhow, Best ramen found, thus far, in Montreal. 
On the pricey side, but worth it. 

Ambiance is thoughtful. Ambled through both main floor rooms, down one set of stairs to the restaurant, then down another set to the washroom and noodle making room. Great wall murals throughout. 

Looking forward to sharing with a friend, having a drink on the bar side, and a meal in the main restaurant."}
{"text":"Ichigo Ichie is literally down the hall from Yokato Yokobai - this small Japanese bar is located right off of Rachel, and offers a variety of hot and cold appetizers, as well as hot and cod dishes.  The hubs and I came early in the evening, and while there was a queue, there wasn't much direction or notification the host.  It was really based on an honor system who arrived first, and who should be seated next.  I personally enjoyed their homemade yuzu sorbet, as it had pieces of the yuzi rind and it was tangy, sour, citrus-like, and refreshing. Some may opt out of dining at Yokato Yokobai and just walk down the hall to order small plates; however, others may bypass the bar area to just focus on the ramen.  Restrooms are located down the narrow small-stepped stairs.

{"text":"This is my fav. Japanese restaurant in town: the atmosphere feels authentic and although the restaurant is quite spacious it is quite cozy.  Wait times are long and the service can be slow at times - they are always quite busy. But honestly i think it's worth it and there's space to wait inside in winter. I've been there 4-5 times and can confidently say that the food quality is consistent and outstanding for the price: the ramen is a must, the torched mackerel is mouthwatering, the grilled squid is tasty and never burned and the green tea tiramisu has the perfectly balanced flavor and is just the right size: you enjoy it and it's all gone before you think you should try the other dessert the next time!"}
{"text":"In my recent quest for Montreal's best Ramen places
Yakoto Yakobai was first on the to do list due to the amazing yelps. Unfortunately,the few times we tried to get in this winter the line - up was way to long. Last night,however, was the perfect opportunity and we were seated immediately in a new section of the restaurant called Ichigo Ichi. So good news for all the yelpers like me who hate long lines. Now is  your chance to try this combination Ramen house and Izakaya as they have plenty of seating. Even better there is now a cool bar serving up very nice drinks where you can sample the best of the Ramen options and order off of the menu from the new Izakaya. 

I complement the design and the decor of this entire restaurant. It is authentic and at the same time has a cool industrial look that's akin to one of the high-tech sets that you might find on one of the food channels. I think they went all out on their kitchen which you can see as you are served in the Izakaya part. It's simply great.

As for the food, the Ramen lived up to all of the great reviews. It was absolutely delicious and totally authentic. The noodles were of the highest quality and the savory and creamy broth was exceptional. Clearly the Ramen bowls here are made with a lot of care and love. The Izakaya items that we ordered were beautifully presented and had everything you would expect of the tastes of real Japanese cuisine.
The avocado and salmon salad tartare was just plain yummy and really pleasing as it was served on a glass block. It also contained some of the  tastiest and crispiest Japanese rice chips that I've ever had. We also consumed a smoked salmon salad ,artfully presented with a great variety of lettuces and veggies on the plate, as well as scrumptious chunks of  in-house on demand smoked salmon. The fried chicken Kara-age was right on the money and should be entered in a championship competition.

We went easy on the Japanese tapas so there was room for dessert. We chose a green tea tiramisu and a play on ice cream and waffles utilizing mochi and green tea ice cream. Both were satisfying, unusual and pleasing to the eye which is a good thing when one opts for dessert.

Hands-down this is the best Japanese place in Montreal.  Its affordable, cool and hip. The staff were really friendly and they try very hard to please. 

New York has Ippuddo and quite a few other Japanese greats and I'm happy to say now Montreal has this place. I hope you yelpers out there will be kind enough not to storm this place after this and the many other great reviews as I'm hoping there will be a place for me when I return sometime very soon."}
{"text":"Nous sommes venus ici un peu par hasard en fouillant dans mes signets Yelp et cela valait le coup. 

Il y a 2 parties dans le restaurant, une plus ramen et l'autre où il est possible de prendre soit des ramens soit des tapas japonaises.
Nous sommes allé dans la partie la plus complète et nous étions au bar.
Le service était vraiment impeccable que cela soit les serveuses ou le gérant on s'est très bien occupé de nous.
Les cocktails que nous avions pris étaient bons, la carte est sympa et il y a du choix, Ils possèdent aussi de la bière et bien sur du saké !
Au niveau des plats que nous avions pris j'ai aimé mes tapas, portion un peu faible pour le prix à mon sens. Il ne faut pas avoir une grosse faim au risque de faire monter rapidement la note. Au moins ce que j'ai mangé était bon donc c'est un point positif. Les ramens végétarienne étaient aussi bonne.

En conclusion un endroit sympa pour manger japonais et se sentir transporter ailleurs le temps d'un repas grâce à la déco et au personnel qui accueille et dit au revoir en japonais."}
{"text":"This place was great!  Awesome service, ambiance and food.  We rolled in with 11 people on a Saturday night and were seated immediately even though it was busy.  My favorites were the udon carbonara and agedashi tofu.  Couple things to note: They don't have sushi rolls.  We were looking for sushi on Yelp when we found this place, but it's not a sushi restaurant. 
 There are some cold fish dishes, we had salmon tartare, but no rolls.  Also, they love wasabi here.  Be warned if you don't like spicy or wasabi.  At least 3 dishes we had were not just unpleasant, but inedible to those in our party who didn't like spice or wasabi."}
{"text":"Fun, friendly, bumping and quiet delicious! We rolled up, put our name on the list, went to a nearby bar, enjoyed a glass of wine and they called us when our table was ready. We were tucked into a booth that felt both cozy and in the thick of things, and the bartneder came over to do a complimentary shot with us because they took a little longer than they had estimated. Super kind and cheerful kickoff to a great evening. We ordered way too much food, as you do when you've been drinking hungry for an hour, but we left with zero regrets.

This is basically the same menu as Yokato, and then some. You can get truly rich veggie ramen here as well as the crazy delicious pork on rice, and a take on French fries that is somehow both light and totally indulgent. Super great meal and awesome experience. Merci!"}
{"text":"Really good izakaya! Food was tasty but small portioned, got lots of different dishes and all were amazing. Desserts were good as well. The waitress were nice looking and dishes came out fast. 
This is a solid alternative to imadake or kinka if you are in the neighbourhood!"}
{"text":"Best Isakaya I've had in Montreal by far! Menu highlights: salmon tartare with crispy nori, tuna tataki with yuzu, ebi mayo. Great space, awesome drinks."}
{"text":"I have gone to this restaurant 3 times so far in the past 6 months (about to add another 2 in the next 2 months). It's by far my favorite izakaya restaurant in Montreal! The decor, the service, the food, everything is amazing. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Nice place to chill with friends... if you are looking for a place to stay light then Ichigo ichie is a good choice!"}
{"text":"This place had so many good reviews, my expectations were very high. Only to be disappointed when we got there. The karage chicken was bad & so was the ebimayo. I think it was $12 and I only for 2 full shrimps and a couple of shrimp pieces. The tataki beef salad was alright, only came with a few pieces. Portions are less than at other izakaya places. Will not be returning. I like to snapchat and at one point I just stopped snapchatting cause the food was so under average."}
{"text":"For those who know IMADAKE, this is the new IMADAKE of the east side, except, better! I know right? Who would think that it could get better, but experience makes perfect, and this IMADAKE 2 will soon have a reputation of its own: Ichigo Ichie! 

The location, ambiance, service, food and presentation are excellent! Every single detail is well thought of, and whatever you order you will not regret it. 

I got to try  Simmered duck,braised pork belly (this one is a must!), rice cake rolled in bacon  (tastes like cheese!great texture), tilapia ceviche and tuna sashimi seasoned and slightly grilled on the outside, and edamame spiced with garlic and red peepers to accompany all these plates!

Desserts! Do not forget about dessert, Ichigo Ichie has homemade sake ice-cream. It is extremely soft and creamy, very well balanced. Oh, and the green tea tiramisu, definitively my favorite and a must try! (and I am not a big green tea fan, for those hesitant about the green tea word being there).

Last but not least! Ichigo Ichie also have their own beer and they have cocktail drinks, but ask the bartender to make you a special invention. These guys know what they are doing. I personally recommend you ask for Aki1 light to accompany fish and dessert! and Aki2 red to accompany meats."}
{"text":"Came here on the recommendation of my tattooist, and was not disappointed!  I'm just sad that I was only visiting in town and can't be a regular!
My friends and I all got ramen.  It was THE best ramen I've ever had.  Seriously, great broth, perfect noodles.  This is going to sound weird, but you order the ramen on these small quarter sheets, and I loved that could customize with miso, extra noodles, etc.
I got the green tea pudding for dessert, which seriously changed my life.  It was described as \"creme brulee without the brulee,\" which sounded really strange, but was actually a perfect description.  Great texture, great flavor!
At the end of the meal, the bartender offered to call a taxi for us, which I thought was very kind since we were from out of town.  He was also very cute too... just sayin.  Sit at the bar so you can stare at Max -- you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure if this review should be written for Ichigo Ichie or Yokato Yokabai. I actually wish I could somehow add the two businesses to my write up, but we were served in Ichigo Iche, so they are receiving the feedback. 

Sunday Thanksgiving night. Six of us are in mood for Ramen. The wait is 30 minutes and actually one of our friends is there 15 minutes early negotiating the table. We are finally seated in Ichigo Iche at a comfortable corner to order ramen. The set up is the following, if you want ramen, Ichigo Ichie will accommodate you and they will bring the ramen from Yokato Yokabai, but you need to wait in line, no reservations accepted. If you want Japanese tapas dishes you can reserve a table. As Yokato Yokabai is relatively small, bigger group will end up anyway in Ichigo Ichie. Meanwhile the underground floor was half empty, but this is the peculiar way the things are managed there. 

The food. The ramen broth is thick and heavy. The options are simple and you can select few side dishes, broth style (vegeterian, spicy...) and add extras. The ramen bowl is huge, it is enough to order one side dish and may be one ice cream for dessert to share between few. My friends raved about the fried chicken, but I'm not a fan. The fried gobo is my favorite. I also ordered the the agedashi tofu for the table to share, nice flavors, but nothing extrodinary. The ramen was delicious, but... I woke up early in the morning with bad pain in my tummy and I'm not the only one who complained from the same. We collectively believe the reason is the ramen was not boiling hot, when served and raw ingredients were added to it, indicating how slow were the things that night. That leads to the service. The service was slow and slightly disorganized up to the non pleasant point, we had to wait for drinks, for water, for food and of course bills. Would that impact the quality of the ramen, may be. I'm ultimately happy with the Bloody Ichigo, pretty decent version of the Bloody Caesar a la japonaise.

Would I come back. May be, may be I would give Yokato Yokabai specifically a second chance as everybody claims it is the best ramen in Montreal, but I really don't know now."}
{"text":"Must eat here if you're visiting. There was a wait when my party arrived but luckily I made a reservation 20 minutes prior and got seated immediately. Everything was extremely fresh and flavorful. Gyoza sticks were a unique and delicious take on gyoza. Vegetable tempura was yummy but I do wish they gave me more variety of vegetables or at least more asparagus because they only gave me one spear. Dessert options are limited if you do not like green tea but those who do will love any of the desserts. Service was very good at the beginning; Appetizers arrived quickly. I realized they was only one waitress working our area but several runners/bussers. Could have used one more waiter because it was difficult to get the check at the end. Overall, a very delicious meal. Would recommend and return."}
{"text":"A gorgeous Japanese resto on the Plateau. You must try it out, the deco is perfect the building is phenomenal and the atmosphere is great thanks to the team who work there. We had a great nite with friends and enjoyed our food. We tried quite a few things based on our waitress' suggestions and we enjoyed all the dishes. Each dish was picture perfect, check out my pictures."}
{"text":"Hands down, the best Ramen in Montreal. 
The broth is so tasty, you can become an addict of it, so quickly! Price is reasonable, service is great."}
{"text":"Best ramen in Montreal, HANDS DOWN.

Get the pork tonkotsu ramen, with extra egg, and follow it up with one of the ice creams. Any of them, they're all reeeeaaally good."}
{"text":"Personally, I would say this is one of the top ramen joints in Montreal and I continue to recommend this place to friends. Not only do you have a wide selection of ramen soups, but it gives you a great selection of amazing Japanese dishes."}
{"text":"Awesome Izakaya! Very delicious and exciting food and a fun casual atmosphere. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I'm addicted to the ramen here. It's the only local option I've found that replicates real ramen broth (extremely rich body and flavor)."}
{"text":"Finally came back again and this time I made sure to take pics before sceafing down the food LOL!

Our waiters were nice, helpful and funny. We ordered the:
-torched makerel that the waitress torched in front of us
-smoked duck which came out in a glass and a mini-smokeshow when she removed the cover which was fun. 
-braised pork belly
-grilled pork belly
-grilled mushrooms
-chicken karage
-matcha tiramisu
-creme caramel with Japanese black sugar
-green tea ice cream with red bean mochis in wafer

Yup. Nothing to complain about. Everything was delicious (except I think my mom's braised pork belly is much better than theirs but it doesn't mean it wasn't good!)

Make sure you order some sake to go with this, their list is quite nice."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite ramen/izakaya spot in town. I have been to this restaurant few times, they have a ramen section and an izakaya section. The ramen was amazing, the broth was on point. The selection of their izakaya is great, a lot of unique items comparing to most of Japanese restaurant in Montreal. I"}
{"text":"Je ne me considère pas comme un expert mais j'essaye de toujours essayer les Ramens dans un Izakaya. J'ai goûté quelque uns des plats que mes amis avaient acheté. C'était délicieux. On ressent l'esprit \"pub\" au sens où il y a cette cuisine japonaise simple, peu d'ingrédients et une orientation vers des saveurs épurée; C'est délicieux. Le service était amical et plutôt professionel. J'ai été a quelques autres Bons Izakaya de Montréal et je dois dire qu'ils (c'est deux restaurants en un, autre review à venir pour l'autre partie) sont dans mes préférés. J'y suis allé deux fois en une courte période de temps et je dois avoué avoir été heureux en sortant de là. Je dois admettre que j'ai manqué d'originalité dans ma sélection des plats puisqu'Ichigo Ichie est la portion qui est justement concentré à la portion pub et Yokato Yokabai est la portions Ramen shop. Ichigo est plutôt grand et une partie du côté intéressant est le lieu; en plein dans le plateau résidentiel. Moi qui est habitué d'aller dans le Quartier chinois ou le deuxième Quartier Chinois sur Ste-Catherine dans le coin de Atwater pour normalement y manger des Ramen. 

Les experts en Ramen ou encore les gens qui pensent y retrouvé quelque chose de nettement supérieures à Ichifuku et autres spots similaires risque d'être plutôt décue. Pour moi ce l'est : Le service est incroyablement supérieur, la constance pour les plats, prix compétitif (Excellent pour les groups d'amis moyennement pauvres!) et quelques exécutions que j'ai préféré ici. 

Important: Arrivé 5-10 minutes avant 17h sinon armez-vous de patience."}
{"text":"The black cod is too sweet. The service is pretty slow and the girl at the reception is acting unprofessional.They only got2 people in the kitchen. My table has been empty for 20 minutes after we had two dishes. I have to say this is just a regular Japanese restaurant. I wonder why people are so obsessed with Karage and endamame which are not consider as a real dish in Asia. The squid is not tender but dry.
But they do have some specials like the deserts. I won't come back."}
{"text":"We enjoyed Ramen for takeout and we look forward to going back to try other things, but beware of the crowds!"}
{"text":"A nice space with friendly staff and awesome food!

My husband and I ordered their torched mackerel, garlic fried rice, carbonara udon and karaage.

Torched mackerel - amazing and unique flavors of eating each hand torched mackerel with a slice of lemon and kiwi. The staff hand torch it at the table, and the torched mackerel tastes so good with the acidity of the lemon and sweetness from the kiwi! The flavor combo blew our minds!

Garlic fried rice - delicious and not clumpy! It has great garlic flavors and sesame, and the most surprising element is the ume that gives the fried rice an unique fragrance!

Carbonara udon - nicely cooked and chewy udon!! It was such a good texture. Overall flavor was good and doesn't feel too heavy.

Karaage - batter was a bit heavy for our taste, overall the chicken was well seasoned and tender.

If we lived in Montreal, it would be one of our staple izakayas for sure! I think this place might be better than some popular izakayas in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Belle izakaya sur le Plateau !  En effet, on se croirait presque au Japon, la déco, l'ambiance feutrée, le bruit de fond et bien sûr la bouffe. On a adoré le ramen tonkotsu (13$) comme son voison de palier, Yokato Yokabai (même proprio), le poulet karaage (9$), le calmar grillé (9$) ainsi que le sashimi (12$) & edamame (4$) en entrée avec la bière. Prix raisonables. Le service était rapide et notre serveuse, toujours à notre disposition. Une des meilleures izakayas à Montréal, à mon avis ! C'est sûr qu'on reviendra, après cette belle expérience ! 

5/5 visité en mai 2016"}
{"text":"Thanks to our Airbnb host for recommending us to this restaurant. 
Street parking available (in the residential zone). And please remember to make reservations, we wished we had done that before waiting about 30 minutes for a table. :) 

Also note there are 2 entrances to the restaurant. There's the ramen shop side and then there's the tapas side. Originally my partner and I wanted ramen but the line-up was so long we switched to the tapas. And we were glad we did because the tapas side includes ramen as part of their menu, yay! 

We ordered the chicken katsu as recommended by our Airbnb host. It was just simply Japanese fried chicken - made well but nothing too exciting - although the mayo type of sauce paired well with it! We also got a bowl of ramen - it was delicious!!! We have never seen the pork slices so thick and big - such a generous ramen shop (we were very satisfied!). The soup base and noodle itself were delicious as well, must have been made in house of course. 

We also ordered beef tataki. It reminded us of the one we ordered in Distillery District. It was very tasty as well. Lastly, the grilled calamari was worth trying - it was just quite a lot for 2 people though. These tapas would have been better if we came with a bigger group, so we can try a variety of their food. 

The barista was also very friendly as well. He recommended us a plum sake I think - I wanted something sweet! It was great. Overall, we had a great time eating here. We will come again when we visit Montreal again."}
{"text":"The staff, ambiance are pretty good, we had a very friendly waiter. Too bad the city didn't allow patios. The food was good i like the fact it's flavour was subtle and not has much sauce compared to the other isakaya, the the portions are way too small compared to the others. We were 2 girls with 6 tapas and mostly was fosh and meat and we were not full. The karaage was great, miso cod aswell, the hamachi sashima was tasty aswell."}
{"text":"Ho.ly.kamoley. How is this place not on yelp?! It's pretty legit.

That must have been the best japanese food I've had in my life. It's a tapas style restaurant, so a friend and I shared 9 dishes for a total of 40$ per person... Usual pricing I'd say, for an izakaya.

Alright, I'll start a sorted list strting with what we liked best (see photos for reference):

- Grilled black cod (5/5): o.m.g. Marinated to perfection, the taste, the texture, the sauce, everything was perfect. Downside: you can probably eat 4 portions of that - which translates to: pretty expensive.

- White tuna with watercress ...(4.7/5): Whaaaaaaat, just try it, and don't forget to eat the pink peppercorns: it has a lemony tingling feel. It was so good I forgot the name of the dish...

- Salmon tartare and avocado dip (4.5/5): Really have to eat them by putting avocado dip and salmon on the nori crackers.

- Grilled squid (4.5/5): a whole squid grilled to perfection: not rubbery at all. Well seasoned, had a char flavour, and with a squeeze of lemon juice and japanese mayo, it's heaven for my tastebuds. 

- Takoyakis (4.5/5): fried calamari balls accompanied with fish flakes, mayo, and takoyaki sauce (similar to worcestershire sauce).

- Negi-pon takoyakis (4.3/5): Not sure what it was that made it excellent, but the fried calamari balls was dressed with spring onions, mayo, and ponzu sauce (soy sauce + citrus vinegar).

- Grilled steak on hot stone (4/5): Very well seasoned and marinated, but you have to cook it yourself on the hot stone - a unique experience. It's very fatty and chewy if not cooked properly (under or overcooked).

- Simmered duck (3.5/5): Worth the experience of having smoke coming out of a covered bowl. The duck itself had the texture of pork belly and good flavours, but there were only 5 small pieces and it costs 10$... Not worth.

- Jumbo shrimp tempura (3/5): Two jumbo shrimps that were fried to perfection and flavourful. The accompanying sauce was tasteless though, I don't remember what it was.

- Japanese sausage (2.5/5): Waitresse hyped it up for us, but that was the biggest scam I've been through today. She said it is the best sausage she's had in her life, but I found it pretty average, and I don't think it's a subjective matter. The truth is, the sausage came as a pork patty, mixed with onion and possibly garlic and ginger, but it didn't taste like what she was describing to us, and certainly not a top tier sausage. Worse part, it was 2 for 6$.

- Karaage (2/5): Now I understand why KFC is Japan's national restaurant. The fried chicken were just underseasoned KFC. The accompanying wasabi-mayo was underwhelming and didn't go well with the fried chicken. The chicken is dry and underseasoned. Lastly, the layer of batter was a bit too thick, so the pieces looked bigger than they are.

I don't have a sweet tooth, but the desserts are worth a mention:

- Green tea pudding (4.5/5): Tastes like green tea syrup on egg pudding. It was very tasty, but also very sweet.

- Sake ice cream (4.5/5): Tastes like my rice cooking wine, but it's very balanced in terms of taste (of sake) and sweetness. Excellent.

- Green tea tiramisu (4/5): Flavour faded in comparison with the green tea pudding. But looks more familiar to westerners and american born asians. People fought over the tiramisu, but the pudding was better gg.

The ambiance is bar-like AND almost romantic. The waiters were very quick and attentive, grabbing finished plates from the table seconds after they're empty. And water was refilled before I thought I'd need more (5/5 for service)."}
{"text":"Its a Pub first then resto .. Tapas japonaises savoureuses dans un beau decor. Prix raisonable. Belle presentation des assiettes. A la mode.."}
{"text":"Wow! What a fabulous meal and time I had at this gem! I am so glad I finally made it there after having it bookmarked for months!!!!


I give it a well deserved five stars for food, service, ambiance and presentation. We had: tuna, fried calamari with salt and pepper which was absolutely delicious, the beef was even more delicious and we were also given a plaque to fry the meat. 

Let's not forget to mention the best part of the meal... the desert!!!! I had such a hard time what to order since I was debating between 2-3 items . I ended up ordering the matcha tiramisu and it was to die for. 

I hope you get the chance to go there at least once in your life and have the same experience I did. 

Tip: rsvp before going  since it's a very popular restaurant even on a Tuesday night ;-)"}
{"text":"I've waited a bit of time to write this review because I am very torn. The longer I wait, though, the less I am bothered by the ramen mishap (see my review for Yokato Yokabai, which works with Ichigo in a collaborative menu to include ramen). I guess I would suggest not getting the ramen unless you're sitting in the ramen side (even though it is delicious!)

Nonetheless, everything about Ichigo Ichie was fun and tasty. It's definitely a spot for those who are adventurous with food. 

My group of 6 luckily got seated right away on a Saturday night. The spot was packed, but the timing just worked out! We sat in a booth around the corner - not as good for people watching, but it made the space feel a bit more intimate.

Ambiance is trendy and definitely feels like a izakaya in Japan, with all its unique dishes and fun atmosphere. Everything we ordered was delicious. Stand outs were the fried chicken and pork belly. Even the fried rice was innovative (beware, it has seeds!). The presentation of each dish was delightful. There are tons of ways to avoid getting the ramen and still be super satisfied."}
