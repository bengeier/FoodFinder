{"text":"My favourite place for breakfast. Staff is always nice. Food is good. I love their Signature milk tea."}
{"text":"First bite was tasty but then you realize that it's way greasier than it should. They are providing good service for a little join though and it looks clean. They are caring about if you like the food or not. They came to ask which I always appreciate. I only give 3 stars because I don't like the processed meat patty in the malay sandwich and it was way too greasy for me. The crepe roll was soaked in butter and the patty as well, but I reckon some might like that. Also the door makes a really loud \"ding\" each time it opens, but just dont sit next to the door and you should be fine. ;)"}
{"text":"Only place in the GTA that serves my favourite Singapore/Malaysian breakfast food - kaya/butter toast with soft boiled eggs (eat with pepper and black soya sauce). 2 toasts with 2 eggs for $4 - super deal. I like their roti prata with chicken potato curry and fish balls noodle soup. Their Malaysian sandwiches are also very good. I will try their bak kut teh next. And their milk tea is a must try as well. I am there for brunch most weekends."}
{"text":"We went early in the morning at around 8:30am to check out this breakfast place and no one came in during our 2 hour stay until near the end when we were paying for the meal.   I wanted to try their original taiwanese egg crepe ($3.50). It was a handmade  green onion pancake, panfried with egg. It was alright, a little crispy on the edges...but I prefer the Chinese style one where the pancake is filled with a piece of crisp. It was alright. Great for a light breakfast or a snack. I also ordered the milktea. It was alright; too much milk for me and not enough tea taste. Another person liked it though, so I guess the taste of milk tea is personal.   The house special sandwich, which was pork loin marinated with house special recipe, tomato, fried egg, cabbage, and peanut butter ($5.99), was good and the potato croquette ($1.75) was good too but a bit overpriced.   The Malaysian Street Style Sandwich ($5.99) was flavourful, but it felt like it was missing something...maybe an addition of asian coleslaw would tie it together.   Next time I want to try their claypot \"Bah-Kuh-teh\" and their malaysian curry chicken on rice! it is only available from 10am - 3pm."}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem in Mississauga. Awesome Malaysian breakfast place! A must visit."}
{"text":"Came here for a Sunday lunch! Small space but quick turnover. Once you find your own seat, you can check mark what you want to order on the laminated menus and hand it back to the server.   I highly recommend the  original sandwich ! Succulent and tasty pork loin w juicy sauces and toppings in between three delicious milk toasts! I gobbled it up within seconds! The milk bread was also amazing and definitely unique. So so so tasty! I'm so excited to try their other sandwiches.   Second up, definitely try their Malaysian laksa. It was not spicy at all but it was really close to the laksa I had in Singapore at a restaurant called toast box haha. Same toppings w bean sprouts, tofu poc, and coconut and spicy base! The noodles were probably slightly different but the laksa at Breakfast ing definitely had a lot more Flavour that the other places that I have been to in Toronto. So if you are in the area, check it out. I'm still thinking about the tasty soup!   We also got the Malaysian pork bone soup.. which was lacking taste and flavour. Good noodles though!   If only they had more drink varieties and a less expensive price !   Ambiance : Like an Asian fusion quick in and out cafe.  Service : Good. Food comes out quickly and fresh.  Food quality: Excellent! We need something like this in the area :) Price: $$"}
{"text":"Love love love this place, this is definitely one of m fav brunch place in Mississauga. Clean, great food, good and efficient service, it's the perfect neighbourhood brunch joint. I adore their breakfast sandwiches, great value for the price."}
{"text":"Nice cozy brunch place. The atmosphere makes me feel like I'm having above standard quality breakfast food at a bubble tea like shop.   The menu offers some unique and tasty items with Malaysian influence and hard to find elsewhere."}
{"text":"Kind of hard to find if you aren't from the area it's in the complex with the No Frills next to Erindale Go station. I'm not big on breakfast so this is one of my favourite \"breakfast\" restaurants as they don't just serve breakfast food. I can get a soup and a sandwich for an extremely reasonable price of and did I mention the service is super quick which is amazing as I hate sitting around in a restaurant waiting for my food.  I ordered the Taiwanese sausage sandwich which was awesome! I ordered it with the laksa soup and they were the perfect combination for me. This is definitely a one of a kind place and serves good you can't find elsewhere. The restaurant is clean and the staff is friendly what more can you ask for!  I will definitely be back here soon!"}
{"text":"I've updated my review because I didn't realize I never tried their Malaysian choices, which is ironic. This is one of a few places in Mississauga that offer it, but taste is pretty spot on. Favourites include the Malaysian Laksa, Bah Kut Teh (herb infused meat) Noodles, Street Style Sandwich. They have lots of other interesting options like French Toast with Kaya spread, Malaysian Curry, etc. Overall lots of different options to try.  I also had their Egg Crepes, which were tasty but a bit pricy for the portion. Signature Milk Tea also very tasty. The only thing I tried and would not reorder is the Potato Croquette given the price for size, and the Minced Meat/Fish Ball Noodle Soup (given how flavorful the other noodles they have are).  While I wouldn't consider this the cheapest breakfast/brunch option, it certainly is still filling and affordable (less than $10 for most entrees) Also good variety and unique with the various Malaysian based dishes offered. Casual environment makes it nice and unassuming for a table of 2-4. It can get quite busy however.  Now that I have revisited, this will be on one of my top breakfast/lunch places to come back to or hangout with visiting guests or friends."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch and it was so good. Everything on the menu is cheap and portion size is great for the price. I got the laksa and it tasted good. Waitress was nice"}
{"text":"Quaint cafe with quick service and good food. We got their house special sandwich and Malaysian street style sandwich for breakfast and they were delicious. Their milk tea is reminiscent of ones you can get in Hong Kong. Note that they take cash or debit, but not credit."}
{"text":"A pretty nice place for breakfast!   Food was decent with reasonable price.  House sandwich was $5.99  and the egg crepe with milk tea were $4.20. Will drop by again if I happen to be around the area."}
{"text":"Visited Saturday morning. Our first visit here. The place is small but quiet accommodative if you do not mind to have the next table inches away from you. The service is slow but did not matter much. I tried the original sandwich which people had reviewed here on yelp and they were right I would say. Well cooked pork loin grill and toast combination. But my wife being a vegetarian tried the Kaya toast with boiled egg which was a disappointment. I will surely come back to try some authentic Malaysian dishes on the menu, especially laksa to see if It could match the Singapore food court style."}
{"text":"if you're looking for a new laksa place in Mississauga, you should give Breakfast ING a try. Personally, I think they're currently the top runner (comparing against Lion City and the Lotus Tea House. If there are others in this neck of the woods, please let me know - I love me some laksa!).   I came for a take out recently as I didnt have time to sit in. The place is fresh and clean and lively, which is fantastic! The space felt small for sure, but no one really seemed to mind except the people waiting awkwardly at the door for a table, as there really isn't that much standing room.   I picked up a laska (obvs), the house special sandwich, and a milk tea. The tea was okay - there are a few places that have better teas at the plaza across the street, so I wasn't too impressed. Mine was quite milky so the tea flavour was weak. The sandwich was delicious though a bit on the greasy side. Portion wise it was okay, I was secretly hoping for more food at $10 a bowl, but the flavour made up for it.  They also have an early bird breakfast special (note that this place closes at 2pm daily) for $5.50: eggs, sausage, toast and a milk tea I think. Not bad at alll! I'll for sure be back for more food - I'm glad there's some more variety here!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Always fresh! Best breakfast place in Mississauga in my books (in Asian food category). We tried all different types of noodles and sandwiches. Nothing failed us! I love the iced milk tea and iced lemon tea! If you are in the area, give it a try. Highly recommended the house special sandwich and all their noodles!"}
{"text":"Laksa is so good! Great price, great selection. One of our favorites go to places. Bak khu teh is also amazing."}
{"text":"I have come here several times and I always had good experience. The service and food quality are great and the price is also reasonable. It also has authentic taste. However the space is not big, so we have to be patient to get a seat especially on weekends."}
{"text":"I like this place.   I tried the clay pot rice and rice vermicelli and I thought they were very tasty. Clay pot broth was really flavourful. The downside was the amount of rice they give you as well as the meat portion. Was expecting atleast the rice to be in bigger portion. I mean rice isn't expensive.   As for the noodle dish, I would describe the flavour to be clean tasting. Delicious but similar complaints regarding noodle portion and the meat portion. Maybe I am too spoiled by other Asian breakfast places where the portion sizes are generous.   Service was friendly. No complaints there. Restaurant was clean and tidy.  I won't hesitate going back!"}
{"text":"The Malaysian style sandwich was tasty, but the ground beef probably was too fatty because I had to go the the washroom a hour afterwards.    The noodles portion was too small for the price. Same with the curry chicken rice, portion too small.  I didn't try the Laksa because the price was way too high. Toronto has better and cheaper ones."}
{"text":"My wife's family came from overseas and wanted to try something new. We saw this restaurant on Yelp and decided to stop by on our way to Niagara Falls. We ordered a noodle soup, two sandwiches, 2 crepes and 2 milk teas.  No complaint overall. Soup could have had a little more flavour to it, and the milk tea just tasted like Lipton Milk Tea from Hong Kong, but the sandwiches were really good! Crepes were really good as well."}
{"text":"I came here for a quick breakfast one day while working from home.  I had their egg crepe plus a warm soy milk.  It was very reasonably priced, ingredients were fresh and the atmosphere is very clean.    The egg crepe was fluffy and crispy and was cheap at 3.50.  It wasn't big, but made for a good little snack.  I don't you can expect much else for this price.  The soy milk was very good too.  This place is reminiscent of the old Chinese food courts in Chinatown (when they were actually clean and had good quality food for cheap prices) but in a much better atmosphere.  Verdict:  Breakfast is decent and may try for lunch soon.  Check it out."}
{"text":"Found \"breakfast ing\" while looking up restaurants that were open on Canada Day. Yes, they are open on stat holidays! When we arrived, they were already busy in the late afternoon.   You will find this is a small dine-in restaurant meant to seat a party of 1-4 guests. The staff are super friendly. We were provided with laminated menus and a whiteboard marker. The menu was interestingly a fusion of ingredients creating various egg rolls and sandwiches to choose from. However, we were there for the noodle soup.   Not sure if noodle soup is a breakfast thing in other parts of the world. We were starving so for sure we wanted the Malaysian Curry Laksa (found on its own separate menu). That did not disappoint! It was my first time having Laksa, so I can't compare it to other Laksa. You can choose between the thick noodle or vermicelli. I prefer thick noodles with soup as this is a comfort food for me. I am coming back here for the Laksa!   We also had two sandwiches for the \"buy one, get one 50% off\" Canada Day promotion. The sandwiches are made of 3 layers of milk toast (the one from T&T/Oceans). Maybe I don't like sandwiches as much as I thought I did, but we weren't a huge fan of it. We ordered the House Special Sandwich (HSS) and Malaysian Street Style Sandwich (MSS). I don't know how the pork loin house special recipe tastes like in the HSS, because all I tasted was peanut butter. If you love peanut butter choose the HSS. The MSS ground beef patty tasted like the McDoubles at McDonald's. Not very appetizing because it was quite dry. Made me felt like I was eating a burger with milk toast. Many other customers ordered the sandwiches and seem to enjoyed it.   We washed down our meal with a cup of their signature milk tea, nothing too special. I would pair this with their breakfast options.   Note: You may leave this place carrying a scent of food as it is a open kitchen where they make the food in the same room. Accept Cash & Debit only."}
{"text":"Best breakfast/snack spot in the area, imo.  What I love about this place is that it's small, but they manage to make it bright & cozy. With that, it makes the food much more welcoming and appetizing. If you're here for the purpose of breakfastING, you'll feel so energized after your visit; step out that door and you'll feel like you're ready to take on the day!  They've got an impressive array of breakfast staples down pat at very good prices. Tons of options including Western (HK) breakfast combos, sandwiches, rice, noodles, croquettes... they even offer homey Malaysian ROTI too, with curry chicken! Get here early (8:00-10:30 am) and you'll be rewarded with the Early Bird menu including drink.  Whenever I'm in there area (very rarely), I always give this place a thought because it'll be unfortunate not to eat here if I had the chance to. I want to make sure you don't miss out either!"}
{"text":"Yum! Had the crepe with egg, milk tea and house special sandwich. Don't let the peanut butter combo freak you out it was very good. Will be back to try other dishes  like roti canai ( a personal favourite) . Busy midday on a Monday."}
{"text":"Okay, so, we had a full meal here, with drinks, for less than $20. Can somebody say Value?!  We came here for brunch on a Saturday around 10:00 AM, and it was relatively full. We ordered: the Malaysian Curry Chicken with Rice ($6.50), the Malaysian Street Style Sandwich ($5.99), soy milk tea ($1.80) and the hot honey lemon juice ($1.80). The Malaysian Curry was delicious but really, really oily (you could literally see the pools of oil gathering on top of the bowl). If you're fine with that (which I was), you'll probably still enjoy it. The sandwich was our highlight - it really filling but still super light and tasty (the bread was white toast, crispy and buttered). It was stuffed with everything it promised, but it didn't make you feel gross afterwards. With the tea, it was a great, comforting Saturday morning meal!  Located right beside the Erindale GO Station in the same plaza as Sushi Tei, Chili Chicken House, and Wonton Chai Noodle (among others), on the northwest corner of Creditview and Burnhamthorpe, and a few minutes away from the Mavis exit of Highway 403, this place really gives you bang for your buck. Plus, the food is delicious, prepared fresh. Overall, a really enjoyable meal.   Our total with tax was around $18.00. With tip, we paid around $21.00. A great, go-to cheap eat in Mississauga where the food is actually decent! Will be back."}
{"text":"I was looking for a traditional bacon and eggs breakfast and found this. There was none of the usual western breakfast stuff but it was an egg based crepe. I found it quite flavourful but greasy. The coffee was ok but didn't taste freshly brewed. Reminded my of breakfasts in Kuala Lumpur - quite authentic."}
{"text":"In love with the lak-sa! I think i found one of the best places for laksa noodles in sauga.   This Malaysian style cha chan tang has fast service and good value. Definitely a place to fill your belly on a budget. It doesn't look much but it's pretty filling!   Ordered the pancake roll with meat floss and corn, laksa, and Malay sandwich. Everything was pretty tasty. The pancake was light, crunchy and a bit chewy. The laksa noodles contained udon, chicken shreds, half boiled egg, lettuce and bean sprouts with a bit of a kick to it. The sandwich is filling with the layered toast-so make sure you open wide!  Will come again to try the other items!"}
{"text":"Cute little place in Mississauga. I came here with a girlfriend for brunch/lunch the other day. This place is small but nice and neat. The seating is not too crowded, which is nice because a lot of small Asian places are generally extremely cramped I find. I thought it was neat that they laminated their menu, which double as their ordering forms - no need to use paper or any electronic means to place orders. You just use an erasable marker to mark up the menu to place your order.  We ordered two sandwiches, two Hong Kong style milk teas, and a curry roti. We ordered the house special sandwich and the Malaysian Street sandwich. The food was good, but the milk tea was weak. The roti that came with the curry was a might stiff, not fluffy enough but the curry was a good flavor.  The prices that they charge is very reasonable. However, this place only takes cash or debit. I think next time I will try their noodles.  Overall this was a good place for breakfast and lunch."}
{"text":"This place is only open until 4pm.  We ordered kaya toast with soft boiled eggs which was so so especially if you've had the original version in Singapore.  The crepe was good. The instant noodles soup with egg and luncheon meat was also good.  Service is efficient but we asked for water that never came. The milk tea we ordered came promptly.  Will go back just to get our \"fix\" for food like that."}
{"text":"Pros:  Very Clean, friendly staff, simple and well articulated menu, well lit  Minus:  Sandwich (Malaysian Street Sandwich in particular) sucks big time.  This place has pretty good reviews, so it means it has its share of fans.  I tend to think that this is one of those nostalgic places that remind some of our Asian patrons of their homeland, and bring back some sweet memories of their youth.  Me - I grew up in the West.   I was very disappointed with sandwich that was 75% bread, and very little in between.  The meet that was in my Malaysian Street Sandwich was something I just cannot identify what it was, what animal it came from, and tasted like something found in dumpsters in back streets of Malaysia.   I took a photo of their sandwich, where meat was plentiful enough to be sticking outside of the three bread pieces. (yes there sandwiches are triple deckers)  The one I got, meat was hiding deep inside by its shy and lonesome self.  I wish I never found it bc it tasted like road kill.  I can go on and on about what else I did not like about the sandwich I had, but I will stop here and sum it up this way:  If you did not grow up in Asia as a kid, and familiar with Asian street sandwiches, keep walking and don't stop at this place.    You will be saying - \"where is the Beef\", followed by some expletives you wish your family and friends were not around to hear you say.  BB"}
{"text":"If somedays you're just like me and you're just craving a sandwich (as simple as they are) then you should absolutely come to breakfast-ing. It's a small but cute place for some simple but delicious eats. And it's a totally new concept, I'm not really sure how many Malaysian styled breakfast places are around.   We managed to try two of the sandwiches here. The Malaysian street style sandwich and the house special sandwich. Oh boy, were they hefty. Both were tasty and features the sweet HK square style bread. The house special featured a pork loin with a hint of peanut butter. Whereas the Malaysian one had two beef patties seasoned with Malaysian spices (couldn't taste them however) and a sweet Thai like chili sauce to compliment it. Both sandwiches could have featured more sauce to bring more harmony and togetherness into the sandwich.   I was also genuinely impressed by the green onion pancake. It was super crisp and I really enjoyed the sweet chili sauce that came with it. The meat floss and the corn was also a good combination.  I recommend their signature milk tea as the perfect accompaniment to your meal; a HK style tea that is super creamy and deep."}
{"text":"Went with the family for breakfast. I had the laksa, husband had the sandwich and get my son the roti with chicken curry. They ran out of the noodles for my laksa,  and they substitute it with the thin noodles instead. It was good (could be more creamier but overall it was nice). My husband loves the sandwich and my son seems to enjoy the roti. But it seems to me that the roti is not made from scratch, but it came from the pre-made frozen ones who get at the stores. I really love their milk tea (had two while we were there and pack one for the road... LOL) They are nice!!!!"}
{"text":"Came here for Family Day brunch and it was packed. They have just one narrow row of single tables along the wall, which can be joined to accommodate parties of various sizes. We had a party of 5, so we waited about 15 minutes before we were able to connect 3 tables together.  The menu is short and sweet. They have just a handful of dish categories - egg crepe rolls, sandwiches, noodle soups, and sides. They also have a laksa special which is given in a separate menu.   We ordered a couple of the egg crepe rolls (4 two-bite pieces per order, served with ketchup), two orders of laksa, rice vermicelli noodle soup, and two orders of Malaysian curry chicken.  The food was quick to arrive considering the level of busyness.   The egg crepe rolls were delicious. My favourite part was the crepe, which was cooked to be crispy on the edges.   The laksa was, in my opinion, the highlight of the meal. The combination of spice with coconut milk was very enjoyable. It came with fishballs, tofu, shredded chicken, and shrimps.   Unfortunately, I didn't get to try the noodle soup at all, and I only tried a bite of the curry chicken. The curry was thinner than other styles of curry, but was delicious when paired with the roti canai.   Breakfast ING is only open until 3pm, but it's definitely worth the morning/early afternoon visit. I really enjoyed every part of my meal - it's always great when a restaurant just focuses on doing a few things really well. One thing I regret is not trying the sandwiches... They were being brought out to every other table but ours and looked delicious.  Oh, and the bill came out to only $50 for the 5 of us - with all that food! Love this place."}
{"text":"Came here after church with a couple of friends. We walked in and they quickly accommodated us for a table of 10 people although they were busy. I've been there one other time before and got the curry laksa that I loved- so I ordered that again. Our friends recommended us to try their sandwiches so My boyfriend tried the Malaysian sandwich. And we both got the milk tea. The milk teas came out first and it was creamy and refreshing. Then came the laksa and the sandwich. The second time around of me having the curry laksa with udon noodles it wasn't as outstanding as the first but my boyfriend liked it! The Malaysian sandwich was interesting, it was like a burger but worth sandwich buns and jam. Pretty good."}
{"text":"I came here as I was walking by looking for a place to eat. Inside is clean and done up nicely. The egg crepe was interesting. The house special sandwich was nice but having peanut butter on it is an acquired taste for sure. Inexpensive and good food I would definitely return."}
{"text":"This is my main 'go to' brunch place! As previously, I often do take out, but I have had a chance to dine in.  Nevertheless, it was great! Due to my back injury,  I require high/bar tables and conveniently they have a table at the window with stools. Thanks for being so accessible :) During my dine-in experience, service was great. We were seated right away and ordering was quick as you just select the items you want on a sheet. The food is served fairly quick and food is made fresh and served hot. I always ask for recommendations when they have a new item- the dish is always spot in.. So good!   Recently,  I tried their Laksa and I would definitely recommend it. Often when I have had Laksa, the broth would be heavy and I would not be able to finish it. The laksa here is flavourful and delicious,  and the dish itself isn't overpowering.  You can never go wrong with their sandwiches as those are my 'go to'  items when I do takeout.   Another shout out to the staff as they are super friendly and nice. Thanks Breakfast ING for being to accommodating (to my back problem) as it is quite difficult to find an accessible 'dine in' place to eat at an Asian restaurant."}
{"text":"Went here on a Sunday morning and am glad we got there a little earlier before it got really busy. They have a few amount of tables for seating and the place is really clean and well kept.   We ordered quite a lot in my opinion for our first time here and out of everything we got, the Malaysian Street Style Sandwich has to be our favorite. I can definitely see why a lot of people like it so I absolutely recommend it. It's just light on the stomach despite it looking heavy and you would feel like you have room for one more.   The staff is really nice btw...and overall the atmosphere is quite lovely in the morning.   Will definitely come back here again for sure!"}
{"text":"Place is a little cramped but food is pretty good. I ordered the house special sandwich and it was really filling and the peanut butter sauce went really well with the sandwich. Also ordered hot milk tea but it was really mediocre. Was expecting \"teh tarik\" that you find in Malaysia. However, I would definitely visit this place again to try the different dishes.  EDIT:  Visited this place again and tried the laksa and tasted the bak kut teh. Very authentic and delicious. This is a great spot for brunch."}
{"text":"I didnt really like this place for the first two times. However, there are not very many chinese breakfast place in sauga and I was craving for it so I decided to give it try again....  Its funny that I actually enjoyed my taiwanese sausage sandwich this time and my husband enjoyed his house special pork sandwich.   I guess we will come back again! And hopefully we will have great experience every single time."}
{"text":"I would say if you would like to change the menu for your breakfast or brunch from these typical Timmy, McDonalds or Cora, this restaurant is absolutely a good choice.   As a small boutique break and brunch restaurant, it has its own footprint in Mississauga. The items on the menu are special. If I remember correctly, they change their menu once a while which is great for people who would like to try something new often.   I don't have any critque for this place since it's very unique in terms of its offering. The only area that I think can be stretched is its pricing compared to its quantity for each item. This place is categorized as a one-money sign. It is right to a degree that each item is fairly cheap. However, in order to have an 80% full breakfast for an individual, it may require having a two-money sign order to accomplish. (Or maybe it is just me that eat too much for brunch.)"}
{"text":"I have been in the complex many times but never found this restaurant. First time here, we were happy to see the food not expensive at all. So we ordered 2 sandwiches, 1 rice,1 noodles, 1toast and 2 milk tea.  Taiwanese sausage sandwich was my favourite. The bread was crispy, the sauce was so tasty and it made super delicious combination with the veggies and meat. I was like \"wow, so good\" when I took the first bite.   But then when I had the Malaysian street style sandwich , which most people said yummy, I fell disappointed. Not sure if it was the first sandwich tasted too good or what, not much flavour even though you could see the big slice meat in it.  Malaysian curry chicken with rice, Emm... it's all right. It's not big portion, 8 dollars you get a few potatoes and 3 pieces of chicken soaking in the extra watery curry. And some rice covered with a fried egg. I should say it's a good price. But I won't reorder it.  Bah kut teh noodles..noodles were soft without much flavour. The soup, sorry, I had better in Singapore and in Malaysia. I had too much expectation before I tried this, because so many reviews say it was good. I would like to say, it was good, but not that good. And it tasted the same as the packed bah kut teh my friend gave me.   I highly recommend Signature milk tea and sandwiches.. this place is more like hk style. I was wrong to think it was Malaysian. And I was wrong to order the peanut butter toast.   But I will definitely come here again, for the sandwiches and milk tea."}
{"text":"Wonderful SE/E Asian style sandwich/breakfast shop with its Malay owner's DNA baked in. She's mostly nailed the street food/hawker center interpretations of the western sandwich (WTF sandwiches as we used to refer to them in Korea). The only disappointment was the kaya toast. It didn't seem to have the familiar pandan flavor you'll find in Singaporean kaya joints like Ya Kun. So, yeah, alas, if you're looking for Singaporean style kaya toast, you won't find it here. But you will find other good stuff.  It's not a big place, seems to be constantly hopping, but these are not meals people linger over. Eat and get out. Wait probably won't be long."}
{"text":"Best Father's Day breakfast ever! Had a Hongkong tea coffee to start and an amazing laksa soup. Wow! Knocked my cold right back to last week. Definitely going to be a monthly visit place."}
{"text":"I'm mustering up the courage to write this review doubled over in bed in fetal position. Because of the positive reviews and determination to find THE Asian breakfast location to feed my fond food memories growing up in Asia, I couldn't wait to try this place when it came onto my radar.   Excited, jovial, and anxious, I arrived at the restaurant like a puppy that just heard the meal bell ring. The place was jiving and most of the tables were filled, less one or two. Pumped, I was excited for what's next. Man, was my mom and I in for a wild ride.  For starters, I ordered hot milk tea. It was very chalky which is surprising considering milk tea is usually silky and smooth. Then came the \"clay pot Bah-Kut-Teh\" and signature sandwich. I'll admit, the clay pot broth was light, soothing, and well made. It's the saving grace to this review because that portion of the meal was enjoyable. The meat was tangy probably because it was used to create the broth, and there were rare sightings of other vegetables swimming within. Best part is we ordered extra enoki mushrooms for $2. What was delivered was a tiny bundle that measured half an inch in diameter. This place sure knows cost control.   Then I present to you... Signature Sandwich. I re-read many reviews about how filling this sandwich was. And it's true, the sandwich was filling but not for the reasons you may think. It was tasty for the first few bites, but the bread was lathered in butter, peanut butter, and grease from the pork. That's three oil sources in one sandwich. The shine off the meat did trigger the thought of breaking out into Mulan's Reflection song given how greasy it was, but because I was so nauseous after consuming half of it, silence was my best remedy.   Quickly I came to realize that would be my only meal of the day because I haven't had anything since given the oil taste lingering in my mouth and the horrendous stomach ache that followed. So here I am writing this review in my fetus position at 2 AM. Oh, and service wasn't on point considering I had to stand up and go to the counter twice to ask for water and service on separate occasions. (No the restaurant wasn't at capacity then.)   So yes the food was tasty enough, but for the experience both during and after, I have to give it some time before my next visit. Relatively tasty at a cost is all I can fathom at this point."}
{"text":"This is a Chinese Restaurant , they did have eggs and ham that was good. Mostly real Chinese dishes. All in all  it was very good, just don't expect Canadian food."}
{"text":"Oh so good! This place is just the perfect the breakfast place. Really light and tasty sandwiches, sweet drinks, and they serve a meaaaaan roti canai! I really need to come back and try their laksa because it looked super good.   On top of everything, the wait staff was just super friendly and pleasant. They constantly had a warm smile on their faces and they were eager to help. It really contributed to the happy atmosphere that just envelops the place, and I totally feel like it makes the food taste that much better.  Just a side note for visitors: only debit and cash are accepted! There's a nearby CIBC if that helps.  Roti Canai (5/5) - Best I've had in Sauga House Special SW (3.75/5) Malay Spice SW (4/5) Chinese Sausage SW (3.5/5)"}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast today and was pretty impressed! The restaurant is narrow with lots of chairs for big groups, the place is nice and clean. They sat us right away when we entered and they gave a us a menu but they failed to tell us that we had a dry erase marker in the corner of the table which you use to write on their laminated menu, nonetheless they did it for us and i thought that was pretty cool, saves paper= saves the environment =)  We ordered the 'create your own' crepe roll and i added a fritter, the Malaysian chicken curry with roti, house special sandwich, potatoes croquette, and a hot signature milk tea. I got warm water because they charge extra for cold beverages....even cold water, I did not like that. We got the crepe roll and that was really good but slightly oily. the signature hot milk tea was amazing but we had to add sweeter and it was perfect. The croquette was ok, nothing special. Just your typical croquette, crispy on the outside and mushy on the inside. The sandwich was my boyfriend's favourite! and i must say it was worth it! it has your coleslaw in it, meat, peanut butter....yeah PB! I think thats what stood out to me every time i took a bite!  I really enjoyed the Malaysian curry, not spicy at all, not salty either just the right amount of spice and the roti was super crispy. It hits the spot! This place intrigues me because its not your typical eggs, toast, pancakes and sausage type of breakfast, although it incorporates those things in a different way..It's still different and out of the ordinary!   The service was fast and very pleasant. I would come here again for breakfast since i live close by. Everything came up to 26.00 flat with tax and tip included, now thats a cheap breakfast!"}
{"text":"Breakfast ING is the best new resto I have been to in the past few years. I  just LOVE LOVE ING. I didnt even want to post this review because Im scared they will get extra busy and I wont be able to get a table :( The breakfast crepes are amazing. I could easily eat 2 or 3 in a sitting and still have room for their sandwich. Its just that good. I like the bacon and egg crepe. The outside is soft yet crunchy. The inside is so hot and the ingredients just shine. I could eat here everyday if I could. The laksa curry is also apparently really really good. Easily 5 star resto here. This is what food is about. *****"}
{"text":"Went there for Malaysian style breakfast. Never knew they offered roti canai in Mississauga. Place was clean. Food was good. Only wish they put egg in it like they do in Malaysia. But ocean loved it."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast twice in a row as the food here is diverse and pretty different from the standard egg and bacon I get in America. The price is decent for the food and it's freshly made. The staffs here are really nice and their milk tea here is comparable to a good cafe in Hong Kong.  The only downside is their debit or cash only payment which limits me, as a traveler to have to withdraw cash anytime I want to eat here. It's an inconvenience but something I'm willing to put up with because of the food.   Their special sandwich is very filling and contains unexpected ingredients such as peanut butter and pork chop. It's worth a try! Their egg roll is delicious egg rolled up and pan fried in oil. It is crispy and savory and a perfect snack to accompany my sandwich."}
{"text":"The place was really good! Went with a couple of friends for Sunday brunch and even though we expected a long wait at 11am, we got lucky as it was kinda empty. Ordered the seafood laksa, the potato croquettes, the Malaysian chicken curry with roti, and the crepes with spring onions and egg. Also ordered warm and cold milk teas. Everything was yummy and a great value for the money! I will surely go back for the laksa, cold milk tea and the crepes. Note: They don't take credit - only cash or debit. The staff is really nice and friendly. Will definitely come back again.."}
{"text":"Something different to try for breakfast. While I can make these sandwiches in the comfort of our home, it was good to come out early in the morning and be adventurous.  Service was good. The sandwiches were okay. Milk tea was the same as any other HK style cafe would make it."}
{"text":"long and narrow space gleaming, lively ambiance of wood, white, orange  soups and sandwiches of the southeast asian sort good sight in sauga  house special sandwich marinated pork, egg, veg, and... peanut butter?  weird, whimsical mix which worked well when together i would recommend  malay street sammy bread, egg, beef, egg, bread, veg, bread stacked in that order  subtle malay spice with some sweet and spicy sauce in chewy milk toast  there is laksa too it's a little oily, but, loaded with flavour  excellent roti equal parts soft and crispy new food that's nifty  fantastic new spot with a variety of asian twist items"}
{"text":"3.5 stars. Went here for brunch recently with my fiancé. Upon our arrival we were seated at a table that was still dirty but our server cleaned it and had apologized.   We ordered a few items: the clay pot \"bah-kut-teh\" with rice, house special sandwich, shrimp burger and French toast with kaya (Malaysian coconut jam) spread. My fiancé absolutely loved the bah-kut-teh which was essentially their take on a pork bone soup, hearty and flavourful. The house special sandwich was good as it was a combination of pork loin, tomato, egg, cabbage and peanut butter. The pork was soft and the peanut butter went well with everything. The shrimp burger was one of my favorites as it consisted of a shrimp patty, potato salad, cabbage and tomatoes. I've never had potato salad in a burger before but it added a nice creaminess to it. Finally, we had their french toast with kaya spread. This was our first time trying kaya and it tasted like a sweet coconut honey spread but not too sweet.   The food here is good and I would definitely come back but the service is spotty. Aside from the dirty table, our server did not ask us if we wanted any drinks and did not even serve us water until we flagged her down. She also brought out our food without any utensils until we asked her as well."}
{"text":"Decent food. Good for breakfast/brunch. Noodles were a bit bland, could have made it with the ingredients I have at home. Sandwiches we're pretty good and the crepe was unique (I had the cheese and corn)..overall nice little restaurant."}
{"text":"This was my second time to Breakfast ING, and I am still not sure if I understand the food or the menu but their food is really good so it doesn't matter. This time I went with my girlfriend for brunch, I order the vermicelli with rice noodles and a roti chanai and my girlfriend got the taiwanese sausage sandwich. The vermicelli waste every tasteful as the broth was one of the better ones I have had the ground beef and vegetables where fresh and cooked well. The roti chanai was good but didn't come with any dipping sauce so I used the jam that was on the table and it was really good. I find that the restaurant gets really busy after noon so if you can get there before then you will not be waiting as long."}
{"text":"Glad I went with a small party, because wait-ING for more than four would have been tough... and now I stop with the restaurant puns. Great menu. The house special sandwich was delicious; the peanut butter was the perfect touch to the pork loin and reminded me of Filipino kare-kare. The meat-floss crepe was great; you really can't go wrong with meat floss if you like saltiness and textures, but the addition of corn was a fresh touch.  The noodle soup was mediocre and needed a stronger broth, but that might have been because I had tried two flavorful dishes prior to. Great milk tea on the side. I wish the staff had been a bit sweeter and in less of a rush. Com-ING back."}
{"text":"If you want to have a hearty ramen soup with eggs for breakfast; this is the place for you. They also make delicious hot sandwiches. Most items on the menu contain some meat or broth so that isn't the best place for vegans. It is a delicious experience, it reminded me of the breakfasts I used to have when I was traveling in Asia. Start your day with lunch; why not? ;)"}
{"text":"Food here is really good! Especially if you are craving a Hong Kong/Malaysian style breakfast/lunch. I've tried their curry laksa with udon noodles which is really heavy but delicious! And I order it with a side of roti canai to dip into the soup. I also get a drink, usually a milk tea or honey lemon juice. Both are good hot or cold.   I have never had an issue with their service untill recently when my friends and I came, got seated and then was not seen again. We sat there for 20 minutes waiting for a server to come back and take our order. We tried to get the attention of one of the kitchen staff/cashiers but everyone was too busy, so we just went up ourselves to give in our order to the cashier."}
{"text":"Wonderful breakfast place for a spur of the moment decision. Highly recommend the house special sandwich. I never thought peanut butter had a place in a sandwich like this, but i was definitely proven wrong. It Seems weird at first but it's definitely addicting with each bite! Their lasksa and pancake crepe dishes are quite good as well. While prices are fair, also do include a cheaper breakfast menu as well."}
{"text":"went here on a whim because we were in the area and hungry, it was delicious! Ended up buying the special sandwich with pork, cabbage, egg, tomato, lettuce, and peanut butter on YUMMY egg toast. I will be back, the flavours were great together and the price was gooooood (5ish dollars) also got sweet milk tea, which was basically just tea with mil"}
{"text":"The sandwiches are quite tasty and the hot tea was delicious. Wish there was more space to sit but other than that it was an interesting stop. I'd go again. ;)"}
{"text":"Ordered the malaysian curry with rice. When the food came, the potatoes were hot on the outside but cold on the inside. I had to ask them to microwave it for me. Giving it three stars cuz the egg crepe roll was okay."}
{"text":"The place needs a good clean. Floors and baseboards are filthy. Service is lousy. Girls are young with absolutely no training in the service industry"}
{"text":"This has become my favourite Malaysian restaurant! Simple and delicious! Love the roti canai and laksa !"}
{"text":"Meat floss and corn egg crepe ($4.20) This was really tasty. The egg crepe was nice and crispy, fully stuffed with ingredients to the point where it was hard to eat it in its form without anything falling out.  House special sandwich ($5.99) Pork loin marinated with house special sauce, tomato, fried egg, cabbage and peanut butter. I asked for no peanut butter since I am allergic, but even without the peanut butter the sandwich was really tasty already. The pork loin was charcoal grilled which made it really good.   Malaysian street style sandwich ($5.99) 4oz ground beef with a taste of Malaysian spice, tomato, fried egg, lettuce, and sweet and spicy sauce. The meat essentially tastes like a sausage, with spice. I liked the house special sandwich more. The sweet and spicy sauce didn't go too well with the sandwich in my opinion.   I really liked the food here! Service was good, food was good and cheap! Perfect lunch spot. I'll definitely come back for lunch if i'm in the area."}
{"text":"Best sandwiches ever! I get their Taiwanese sausage sandwich. The sandwiches are slightly towards the sweeter side but I love it. Their house special is one of my other favourites!"}
{"text":"The milk teas are great, both cold and hot! I had the shrimp burger, Malaysia's bone soup noodle, and sandwiches, they all taste pretty good. The soup base is very close to what I had in Malaysia before, but the herbal taste is not very strong, still give it a like!"}
{"text":"This little hidden place in a strip mall has Asian style breakfast which is quite reasonable. I'm sort of reminded more of the Hong Kong style food here.  Dad had the original egg crepe roll combo. It is delicious but quite heavy on the oil.  We both had the milk tea and it was nice and strong!  We both want to come back here for the Malaysian curry and the roti canai.  Service is excellent. The waiter came to the table right away and asked if it was our first time here and assisted with making a selection. Great service, good food and a clean restaurant."}
{"text":"Quick Breakfast with Reasonable Price  My favorite when I go here is Taiwanese Sausage Sandwich. The sandwich looks very typical, with egg, tomato, sausage, lettuce and sauce but somehow everything goes so well together. Their Milk Tea is also very good too but will be abit on sweet side. If you are on the go, call in to ask for pick up. Their breakfast is amazing to start your day!"}
{"text":"This is a nice change from the usual Western breakfast.  Mostly serve Hong Kong style diner type breakfast foods but they also have some Malaysian food.  We came here shortly after opening hours and there were already people eating.  We ordered their special sandwich, Malaysian sandwich, potato croquettes, laksa and cold peanut noodles.  Everything tasted fine, nothing super amazing in flavor but I'd consider coming back again.  Decent prices and ok portions.  If you're allergic to peanuts don't get their special sandwich.  It contained peanut butter."}
{"text":"Breakfast ING is a great spot to go to if you're looking for an adventure. With Taiwanese and Malaysian influences running through their menu, you're sure to come across a dish you may have never tried. They put a unique twist on some commonly known dishes like the Crepe and French toast. My personal favourites are the egg crepe, Taiwanese breakfast sandwich, and the Malaysian chicken curry. Breakfast ING offers quick comfort food, from sandwiches to noodle soups to milk teas. Their menu is one that offers an assortment of foods to satisfy your cravings.  Things to keep in mind before visiting: restaurant hours and seating availability."}
{"text":"So I've gone back a few times since my last review and the only thing I get is the curry laksa. IT IS SO GOOD. You have a choice between vermicelli noodles and noodles which is basically udon. I personally don't like vermicelli so I always get udon. The only thing that I'm a little picky about is that the noodles aren't that chewy.. and I think it should be a little. Regardless it's still good my favourite part is the soup and the bean curd thing in it. The soup base is so creamy and it's packed with a lot of flavour. The bean curd just tastes good after the soup seeps into it haha. Portions are pretty big for this bowl and it's $9.50 I think - not including any drinks. All drinks are separate.  This laksa comes with 2 pieces of shrimp, and I don't like seafood so I usually give them away to my boyfriend :). There isn't a seafood smell to it either so that's a huge plus for me.   When I came on a Sunday I saw a new menu.. think they're starting to serve toast now! That's something I'd like to try next time."}
{"text":"Came here several times already. This is my husband and I's all-time favorite breakfast/lunch place to go! The price was super reasonable! Less than 20 dollars but can fill up our tummies like  balloons! Simple menu but unique dishes. Our favorites were their house special sandwiches!"}
{"text":"Great value meals for sure! Had the Malaysian chicken curry with roti ($6.5) and Laksa Vermicelli ($8.5) and it was super satisfying! The roti was a bit too oily for my preference but the crispness of it makes up for it (you can blot the oil with tissue). The laksa isn't that spicy as they have an option to make it extra spicy but definitely the best of the two! I'll be back to try what they're known for - the sandwiches!"}
{"text":"Well we tried a non dim sum asian breakfast...but wont be coming back.   Service was fantastic...seriously a cheap asian joint with good service...am I in a twilight zone?  Food was not great. I did not like the cheese crepe nor the noodle soup. The soup was not flavorful. My husbands malaysian sandwich was decent. The milk tea...it was so bad we went for milk tea at republic next door right after."}
{"text":"The House Special sandwich is great. The peanut butter adds a nice touch to the flavour of the pork loin. I also had cold milk tea which I loved. My sister had the potato croquette sandwich which she didn't like as much.  The service was Ok but the restaurant was really busy so I understand the staff may have been a bit overwhelmed.  The restaurant is small, brightly lit and lively.  Overall, I had a good experience and I will definitely be back."}
