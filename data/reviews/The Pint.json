{"text":"Stephanie is the main reason I come here! I sit down and she already knows my drink and has it ready within seconds! She makes sure I'm taken care of always along with anyone I bring with me! I recommend the pint and Stephanie to anyone looking for a gold place with great service and atmosphere!"}
{"text":"I don't normally like big sports bars like this that cater to this crowd but we came here after work for their wing night on Wednesday and was pleasantly surprised.   The wing special is $4.00/pound of wings with 40 sauces/dry rubs to choose from. Wings were juicy and sauces were pretty good. I think there was also $2 off pints between 3-6pm. Beer selection isn't great but with the price I can deal with it!  I think because they just opened, they are still getting the hang of operations but that will come along I'm sure. Service wasn't great but not the worst the two times I've been."}
{"text":"Love the Pint! I've been here a few times and each time has been pretty good.  They have a pretty good Happy Hour (although the times aren't necessarily posted) and the food is actually quite good for bar food.  The staff is what sets the Pint apart from other sports bars in the Summerlin area.  They genuinely seem to love working at the Pint.  They are continuously welcoming, helpful, and eager to assist in any way they can (ALL staff; servers, bartenders, etc).  This is a great little get away from the generic sports bars that are available within the area."}
{"text":"Where to begin... I stopped by here two days after my 25th birthday. My id expired on the 15th (my birthday) I explained the situation, my new id is in the mail. I was with my father, my girlfriend, and three of my best friends all of which are over 21. After they denied my id, they decided to tell me I needed to leave their establishment even though my girlfriend(who was never carded) was aloud to stay. This might possibly be the worst bar in Las Vegas. Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"WOW!  so we're up on the patio this evening.  we had called and gotten a table for a big birthday.   no such table was saved for us.  so we just made due with what we could find.   about 10 mins in our server is bringing over the water which she proceeded to spill on our table and the one behind us. and she just ran away and we dealt with it ourselves. Charming.   then she was very snippy and rude and no accommodating at all .  it was like she was doing us a favour for serving us.     so she kept not wanting to take anything but drink orders but finally we got our food orders in . and everyone sfood comes.   I personally am a vegetarian so i ordered the fajita.  chicken on the side and one of the girls was going to eat it with her food.    So it comes with the chicken on the side AND IN THE WRAP ! WHY WHY ! so im irritated. she didn't come ONCE to check on us see how our food is and if we need anything.   Finally she comes around when everyone else is done. and im like hey and explain whats going on . so she tells me im wrong and my friend has mine.  NO.  she looks like she has mine cause i passed her the chicken. but hers was made with meat . AND SO WAS MINE.  and it wasnt supposed to be so she snatches my plate and heads off to the kitchen about 10 mins later she comes around again. We're ready to go so i tell her to cancel it i dont want it anymore we dont have time. and she rudely storms off again .   She's back with bills and my food ? but wrapped up and she said management took care of the bill so i said thanks.   THANKS MANAGMENT ! :)   so she got everyones bills wrong and was tryin to tell them whats what. when we're sober and clearly know what we ate and drank (you should be writting down stuff AND CONNECTING PEOPLE AS NUMBERS. i know ima server / bartender)   so finally everything is cleared up . i pay in cash. and she doesn't offer to bring me back my change. and now i wish i hadn't tipped her at all     there were so many other things wrong with this and we were there for 2 hours.  Seriously i don't know how this girl got and is keeping her job.   also we don't want to see your boobs while we're eating. if we did wed go to hooters to see some nice ones !  I will honestly never come back"}
{"text":"I really enjoy the point for all of the great beers they offer and the amazing service that comes along with it! And the bartender So, who took care of me was beyond helpful and friendly. I would come back just for her!"}
{"text":"I went to the pint today with my boyfriend & ordered a couple drinks, I ordered a beer which I ended up asking her to take back because it tasted disgusting, we also needed a re-fill on dips, & tried to get our severs attention, but she was too busy gossiping with the other ladies at the bar, when we finally got her attention, I explained how I didn't like the way the beer tasted, she then went to talk to her manager leaving the poor tasting beer on the table !! we were sitting right by the bar & the manager & server explained about the re make of beer to the bartender, she asked what was wrong with the beer & the server told her & she rolled her eyes right infront of us. good food but really poor customer service !!! will not be coming up on the deck next time to listen to gossip."}
{"text":"Awesome service, great place for Sunday football. Michelle is the best!   Best part about this bar, is that it's not smokey."}
{"text":"I would give no stars if I could.. I never EVER write reviews but I could not pass this one up-horrible horrible is all I can say!!! I am a HUGE player and I was playing at the bar for about 7 hours . I go all over Vegas and play. Michelle the bartender is nice and accommodating, however the guy swing shift bartender is the absolutely rudest person I have ever encountered (apparently his mother is the owner of the Establishment) so I'm guessing he acts how he wants to act to his discretion. Came in had a awful attitude my sister told him I had gambled over $1300 and heard there was free play he immediately mumbled she did not play that much !! He then said I'm tired I don't have time for this I need to go get a Starbucks. I've been a bartender in this town for years, it's simple you just check to see how much the player spent or won. That's how they comp food cigarettes etc. regardless if you have a players card or not. It's really unfortunate when your family owns a place and the child or family member works there they automatically think they can treat customers however and that's very very sad. I sure hope his mother reads this review and sees the seriousness of this."}
{"text":"Great bar nice environment. STUPID EXPENSIVE.... 30 bucks for 4 beers, 14 for two shots?!?!? Crazy......Go anywhere else nearby for a similar vibe and cheaper prices"}
{"text":"I would like to say thank u to Michelle the bartender, for her attentiveness and great knowledges of specialty drinks....  Chef was great, and i highly recommend it.   Once again thank you Michelle, ur not just a pretty face u actually know ur stuff"}
{"text":"Wow!!!! We were so anxious to go Check it out. A few people playing pool wouldn't release their slot machines at the bar do we can sit drink eat and play. Really????????? I couldn't believe how the bartender didn't even step up and say something. I guess we are not even going to try it out. You just lost our business."}
{"text":"Took over 15 min for my server to get her pen and note pad, the place was practically empty. Even though I had stated I was on a time crunch. Then took over 20 min to get a plate of raw veggies that were not even washed, and cold fries and chicken strips. Bad service and rude servers."}
{"text":"The Pint has pulled up its socks recently. My initial review was negative but I've been back twice since. I must admit that they seem to be turning things around. Staff are more friendly, the orders are filled quickly, and the service is overall consistent. I look forward to seeing this place develop because we need a great bar on the west end of 17th."}
{"text":"So this was my first visit, and as a self described 'wing addict' I figured that 40 cent wing night was a sure thing. Was I ever wrong!  This visit made me start a yelp account!  The 10 wings for $4 is an ok deal (you really donget what you pay for), but don't expect much. The wings arrive quickly, but they are lukewarm at best. They're also somewhat soggy. They obviously cook them ahead of time and keep them in a warmer or (way worse) sitting in the window waiting to be dressed. The sauces (contrary to their best assertions) register as hot as your local bar's medium. Also don't expect any help from your server!  My server had no clue about any of the menus. She was completely ignorant about the beer selection. When I asked about the wing sauces she was like a deer in headlights. Obviously no effort went into the selection or training of this individual.  The most offensive part of my experience was when I asked her for change, and she had the audacity to ask \"how much\" change I wanted back. I told her \"all of it and I will decide what I will leave.\"  Needless to say she stood there waiting...  I have never been so insulted after such an awful meal. I would not reccommend this place to anyone. There are so many fine places for wings and pub food across this city, this one is not worth your time."}
{"text":"My new favorite local pub. Love the changes! If you go during the day make sure to visit with Jenny, she is a Hoooot!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love, love this place!! Living in Summerlin for 3 years we have been looking for a neighborhood bar & this is definitely it! I have been here many times since it opened & I've had a great experience every single time. I love that they support local businesses by having some beers from a brewery in Henderson, which is what I always drink. I always see the owner behind the bar & you can tell he's very invested in making your experience a great one. The music is great & the food is better than any other bar food I've had. Try the Grown up Grilled Cheese sandwich,  it's amazing!"}
{"text":"Food was okay. Waitress was terrible though, seemed really miserable. I tipped her well, thinking she was just having a bad night, but she wasn't thankful at all. She just took the money without a word and walked away. Not going again."}
{"text":"Great beer selection including cider and the cobb salad is out of this world. I didn't get as big as I am eating salads but that sumbitch is awesome!"}
{"text":"I love this bar DD and Corey are a great team ! They are always attentive and welcome you by your first name . I feel like family here . The machines are hot and so is DD . Lexi the waitress barback is the bomb she is sweet as pie"}
{"text":"Love it here. The bacon wrapped dates are fantastic. The employees are always helpful and attentive."}
{"text":"Went to \"The Pint\" sat night for a birthday party.  First time in the doors and it will be the last.  Over crowded, the noise level was absolutely ridiculous. If you turned down the TV's to a level where people did not have to scream sitting next to each other it would be much more appealing.  Drink menu is VERY limited, they did not have the ingredients to make a rather simple drink. If you are looking to have beers with a bunch of drunk, loud 18-25 year olds, then this is your place.  There are so many other nice places on 17th."}
{"text":"First time visitor. Great service. Great beers on tap. Great food. Not a single thing to complain about. Will be a return customer."}
{"text":"Came in for the first time today and have been anticipating their open. We were out of town for Nevada Day weekend or would have stopped on by. Very warm atmosphere from the staff. They are eager to help and serve. The food is amazing! Happy hour is Mon-Sat from 3-6 and Midnight-4am. 1/2 off of flatbreads with many to choose from. 3.00 well drinks, beer of the week, house wine, pbr, bud and miller light. 5 dollar jaeger and fireball shots. Pretzel bites and shredded beef flautas for 4 bucks! Great selection for whatever your looking for. Defnitley a must try out for the area!"}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. Never even got to try anything. Walked in at 5:30 for happy hour and only 7 people in the place. Sat down at a table and saw 3 bartenders behind the bar. Waited for 15 minutes without ever being offered even a drink. Finally asked a bartender if you have to order from the bar?  He said no I'll be there in one minute. He stood there and we finally walked out because he never even attempted to take our order.  Bummer because I was really looking forward to trying their food and drinks that got such great reviews.  Their competitors will get my business instead."}
{"text":"Went to the Pint last night for a pub night with some friends and we definitely wished we gone elsewhere ...   Food was not good at all, sloppy and mediocre tasting. Server was a dud and not really on the ball. Won't be going back as there are so many other places more worthy of our $$ ..."}
{"text":"The Pint has a distinctly passive-aggressive management style. Worst pub Ive been to in Calgary. Our waitress didnt come to our table for 45 minutes. When I asked the bar staff for a manager he said they didnt want to serve one of the people at my table but offered me and my friend a last drink. I have talked to at least 2 other people with a similar experience. I will never return  to this authoritarian pub again."}
{"text":"Great drinks, great atmosphere, and great service. Ronnell was our bartender for a party of 3 with a bar that was half full and he still made sure that we were well accommodated and entertained. This was our first visit here but we will definitely be back in the future."}
{"text":"I've had three separate experiences at The Pint, which I will now attempt to combine in one review. In general the pub is okay, but I would still never pick this place to come to even though it's the closest to where I live. Mostly this is because of their usual crowd, lack of craft beers and general atmosphere - the food and service has generally been fairly good.  The first time we went there for wings and a drink on a casual weekday night. The clientele was pretty much all guys sitting around the bar watching sport on the tvs, and appeared to be very much the 'tradie' crowd. To the point that as a blonde girl walking past I felt their eyes on me and as a group of two guys and two girls, felt a bit out of place. The waitresses here wear so much makeup, but the service was really good and I really enjoyed whichever of the spicy wings I had. And the blue cheese dipping sauce it came with. Having said that, I'm a big craft beer lover and there is no beer on their menu (tap or bottled) that I would pick to drink, which seems ironic at a place called 'The Pint'. I do enjoy their Caesars as a result, and the fact that they come in a boot shaped glass. While I did enjoy the wings, I probably wouldn't pick this place for wings over any other as I didn't really enjoy the vibe/atmosphere.  The second time I stopped by with a few friends on a Saturday night for a late night drink (around midnight from memory). Our ID was scanned on the way in (a first to happen to me in Calgary), and as soon as we walked in I wanted to leave. The place was packed out, but it was full of what I can only try and describe as a tacky, drunk 18 year old dance club crowd. Sadly, I think everyone was well over 18. We poked our heads up the stairs and it was exactly the same. We then tried to use the bathroom but there was a big drunken queue. We quickly left.  The third time, I came here as part of a bigger group on a Tuesday around 3/4pm only a week ago and the place was pretty much completely empty. The table service was pretty good again, and again I had Caesars given the beer menu. This time we tried food off their full menu, and I had the beefshires - beef Yorkshire puddings. I really liked them! It could have come with more of the horseradish sauce but I still really enjoyed them."}
{"text":"New to the area!! Never liked summerlin that's why in the 8 yrs I've lived here!! I never made the effort to come out to summerlin!!  Terrible service.. Got off work and met my boyfriend here to have a few drinks after a stressful day at work.. There was 3 bartenders and wasn't that busy.. The bartenders walked pasted me about 2 times and did not acknowledge me.. Finally one bartender asked if i have been helped.. I said no and he said I'm sorry I walked passed you twice and didn't ask you.. I said its ok.. I had my beer(2) and a shot of Jameson and I was gambling... My boyfriend and I went to cash out and they didn't comp my drinks for gambling and I lost $30... And i said to my bf.. I lost 30 dollars im not gonna pay for my drinks they charged me... They lady heard it and said I'm sorry I didn't know you were gambling.. So she comped my drinks.. But I wouldn't be writing this.. If she wasn't talking shit about me to her regulars.. And the only reason I know that.. Is because the people that were sitting sitting semi close to us she was hunch over talking to them and they kept looking at me and my bf.. I would of left her a bigger tip.. But I guess people in summerlin thinks their shits don't stink and they are better than others!! Only if I didn't have to move to be closer to work!! I wouldn't have and I would of stayed in Henderson!!!"}
{"text":"It is unfortunate with such a big lovely space, the service and food is so bad.  I understand it is still new and trying to find it's groove but seeing as the opening was delayed a month, that time should have been used to properly train staff.  Waitresses are not knowledgeable about their menu or drinks, everything needs to be asked for (waters, utensils, extra sharing plates etc.....), and food runners come out to the wrong tables every time.  I think the size may be working against them as the food may have been somewhat pleasing if it was hot and not coming out cold and stale.  I did go back two more times just to make sure I wasn't jumping to conclusions as I do work very close by and love to find new lunch places, but each time, same conclusions."}
{"text":"RED MILE EXPERIENCE- We came here last night for Game 2 of Round 1 Flames playoffs and it is very clear this pub is lacking in many areas. Two out of three Tvs in the front window room continually flickered out and when brought to the servers attention she said it was the wiring and nothing was going to be done. Although our server had a fantastic personality and was very attentive, she made many mistakes on bills resulting in over charging. The worst part of the night was when the pub RAN OUT beer in the 3rd period! Saturday night game 2 Red Mile and no one made a back up Keg order? Working in the industry for many years I have to say its clear they are unorganized and unprepared for playoffs. Hopefully they take this feedback and put it toward improvement. Until then give your business to someone who shows they want it!"}
{"text":"Me and my husband always drive by and finally decided to stop in last week and so glad we did!!!!AS soon as we walked in the bartender introduced himself his name was dan very nice !! I like going to a locals establishment and feel welcome !! The draft selection was great! Happy hour great! I have many experiences with bad customer service and I just have to stress the fact when you go into a establishment and get treated great it needs to be heard !! Also the owner happen to be there ( not sure if he always is in there ) but knew a lot of the patrons by name and introduced himself to us as well and asked how everything is going !! Very professional and welcoming !  If I could give the pint 5 more stars I would !! We will definitely be returning !!!!"}
{"text":"Used a groupon for here. The veggie burger I had just didn't taste very good. The nachos also weren't hot."}
{"text":"The waitress was great, a bit loud inside. An appetizer was enough. Dry chicken fingers and salty poutine. The gravy is water, brown colouring then add salt till it thickens to resemble a gravy. Short beer list and I guess being after the weekend the beer I ordered came back as being out. The location is OK found parking nearby. The rooftop is OK if you could get one of the few seats beside the wall."}
{"text":"I actually really like this place!! I've seen a bunch of negative reviews on this place which is unfortunate. I went there for my birthday this month and I had a great time! I have never had a problem with the food and our drinks were brought promptly after we ordered (The ones we DID order). However, the service wasn't great. Our waitress brought us drinks we didn't order, that we had to pay for, she would disappear for 30-45 minute increments, she didn't separate our bills, etc. I will definitely be back though because the last time I was there, the service was awesome. I think it all depends on who serves you. That's the one place they could really step it up.  Overall, it's a great sports bar with good music and good food."}
{"text":"Good music, great beer and food, cool bartender!"}
{"text":"The Pint is great for everyone and anyone. Whether you're looking to enjoy some food, grab a few drinks at the bar or in the mood to dance the night away on industry night - The Pint is the place to go!  First off - THE FOOD. The wings are some of the best wings I have ever had and there are 40 flavours to choose from along with awesome dipping sauce choices! On Wing Wednesday a pound of wings comes to around $4.40 which is an absolute steal.  Secondly - THE DRINKS. There are 40 beers on tap (and yes, I counted). They include staples like Budweiser, Goose Island and Rolling Rock BUT carry local brews like Bandit Brewery's Hoppleganger. Not much of a beee person? Well the cocktails are awesome. The Pint knows how to go caesars. The peppered peach cocktail is also delicious.   Not to also mention that on Thursdays all beers on tap are $4.40 for a mug. (!!!!!!!!!!)  Looking for a place that has a bit of a night life vibe? Look no further. Tuesday nights at The Pint are bumpin' with two dance floors and an awesome DJ. Friday and Saturday nights are lots of fun also!!!   The staff are also very friendly and look like they're having fun which is great to see.  Such an awesome place!"}
{"text":"Hands down to the chef! Not ur typical bar food. Everything came out hot & made fresh. Onion rings,zucchini fries & sweet potatoe fries hit the spot! Big fat meaty fish & chips not covered in oil or just batter. Burger so big & juicy could only finish 1/2. Tons of beers to sample. 4 arcade games, a pool table, couches, a fire place. It's so much fun here! Thanks to a great waiter, Austin, too!"}
{"text":"The inside of this place is decorated like a college bro's dorm room, minus the crunchy socks.  The place is filled with mostly post-college looking bro's wearing sports caps and looming over their pints or table kegs.  It's an average kind of bar, with an average crowd and average drinks on tap.  The boot shaped glassware and table kegs are a fun option, especially for a group night out; and the volume is on the higher side so I wouldn't feel bad about getting a bit rowdy watching a sporting event. Our waitress Zoë was a sweetheart and attentive without hovering and the bathroom was clean."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were spending our last day in Toronto at the observation deck at the CN Tower and a trip to the Ripley's Aquarium. In between the two, we thought we'd grab a quick bite to hold us over until dinner, which is what brought us to The Pint. It is located right by the CN Tower, and they were offering Taco Tuesday specials... YES!  I didn't do any Yelp research on this spot before walking in, but it only took seconds for me to realize it was a sports bar. Lots of bar space, super casual vibe, TVs every which way you turned, and almost all of the customers had beers in hand - yep, typical sports bar scene if you ask me! We didn't mind at all, so we helped ourselves to a table as the hostess suggested.   The Taco Tuesday special included $4 tacos (three to an order). No way we were turning this awesome deal down so we decided to get the beef tacos. I had also been dying to try the much talked about poutine, and since we were nearing the end of our trip, we decided to get an order of that.   First, the tacos... oh no. Presentation was fine, but the tacos itself were a huge disappointment. They were boring and cold! I suppose \"boring\" is what you get for $4 tacos, but the cold meat makes me think they weren't fresh. :( Since we were pretty hungry and our waitress never came back to check on us, we just forced the tacos down.   The poutine however was pretty good! This was my first time having poutine so I have nothing to compare it to, but the one thing I can say is that I definitely would not be opposed to getting it again! Besides, anything was an upgrade after those tacos...  On a more positive note, I do believe The Pint would make for a good place to enjoy a game and have a few beers. Just don't get your hopes up for some good eats because it appears that isn't their main focus."}
{"text":"Nick and the bar staff are awesome friendly and professional if you live close check this spot out!"}
{"text":"First off, I want to say that it pains me to give this place 1 star. They have SO much potential. Unfortunately, based on my experiences here, I can't do that. I personally don't recommend this bar due to the poor customer service.   Folks, I gave it more than enough tries before writing this review. I've been here about 6 times and only had somewhat decent service once.   My most recent visit was last weekend. The place was pretty empty. My boyfriend and I sat down at the bar and waited.... waited.... and waited! Talk about feeling unwelcome. Unless they were blind, there was NO way they didn't see us. There  were 2 female bartenders, behind the bar, who seemed more interested in discussing their friend Michelle's party, that was happening later, than attending to customers. After about 15 min I asked for a drink menu. The bartender gave us the menu and then seemed to have forgotten about us. She was counting receipts and checking the dishwasher looking everywhere but at us. Finally the other bartender made eye contact with me so I said \"We are patiently waiting for one of you to take our order.\"  She responded with \"Oh, I figured she took your order.\" (Side Rant: Any normal person with even an ounce of customer service would and should have enough attention to detail to notice that 2 customers were sitting at the bar for an awful long time with no food or drink in front of them. How do you not at least check with the other bartender and ask if she took the order?!? If you don't have even a fraction of that kind of attention to detail, then you shouldn't have a customer service job!) she quickly poured our drinks and when our drinks got low, neither bartender acknowledged it. Neither bartender was making drinks. One was just standing around  and the other  had very tweekish behavior. There was no excuse for the lack of customer service we received. Had they been a tad more friendly, we would have drank more and probably ordered food, even though it's just mediocre. Instead, we had one drink and left.   I most likely won't go here again. If I do, it's against my will. It's insulting to go to an establishment and be treated like you're intruding.   Another reviewer stated that they saw a bartender get off their shift and start gambling. We saw the same thing happen when we were there. No wonder why she didn't want to take our order. Her shift was ending and was eager to hit those machines.   I dunno what's going on with this place but I predict that if they don't change their attitude toward customers, they'll be outta business in no time. It's really a shame because they have so much potential.   If you dont mind being treated rudely then by all means go here. They actually have decent craft beer selection."}
{"text":"Staff/management are all really cool and down to earth. Great food and drink specials for games. The pint has become my go to spot for a good time!"}
{"text":"It's big and good to go to for sporting events. Came here on a Saturday night to watch UFC. They didn't charge cover. They have two floors. The first floor is suppose to turn into a dancefloor with dj on weekends. Menu serves regular pub food and on Wednesdays they have 40 cent wing nights. Alcohol prices seems very regular for a bar in this area."}
{"text":"This place is 5 mins away from my house and it's such a great neighborhood spot. I'm really not a beer girl, and luckily they have a great selection of other drinks as well.  Parking is super easy, it's on the side of the Smith's building, and you can actually turn left onto Town Center when leaving there!  Staff is super nice and Nick, the owner is awesome!  Definitely go check it out!"}
{"text":"Really good beer on tap lots of choices.  Food is ok I like the bacon wrapped dates would like a better food selection. Staff is really attentive and friendly.  Pool table,  good music,  cig machine,  karaoke and full bar. There is a beautiful park with lots of trails next to it."}
{"text":"Ok, I didn't order food, so am reviewing service. Not happy...but since I'm the only female at the bar surrounded by guys, and not a regular...I've been ignored since I came in. OH...and now at shift change, the new female bartender just asked the guy next to me if he needed anything..completely ignoring me.     I have worked in food/drink service for 8yrs and customer service for 20+.  This place has a great atmosphere, but if you want to draw in new clientele in addition to your regulars, your bartenders need to get OFF their cell phones and pay attention to everyone at the bar. Btw....women actually tip better :)"}
{"text":"Love this place! Excellent service, never disappointed. Just minutes away from me & i always have to order my favorite, sweet Sriracha wings. Zucchini fries are also good as well!"}
{"text":"Great service, great food and live music. Love this place. Will definitely be back. Not sure aboit that punching bag video game in corner though. They should look into getting rid of that. Can be kind of annoying."}
{"text":"Formerly Baton Rouge... and before that Planet Hollywood (who remembers that?) The Pint definitely is a much better fit for the neighbourhood (and the city) than either of it's predecessors.   I was here AFTER a Jays game for bite to eat and a beer with my SO, we wanted to sit on the patio but it appeared to be full and the staff weren't exactly helpful with their \"seat yourself\" approach. Not wanting to wander the patio aimlessly we went inside to find seating. There was plenty to be found but the restaurant is a labyrinth inside so we were unsure where to seat ourselves to ensure a server knew we were there.  After sitting down and connecting with a server we perused the menu and ordered drinks. They've got a fair selection of beer (as they should with a name like the Pint) with fair distribution between large and small breweries/companies. I had the Lasershow from Leftfield brewery in Toronto - kinda hoppy but crushable with a good citrus finish.  Food was where things kinda hit a wall. My SO is vegetarian and if you are Vegan or Vegetarian this is not the place for you, everything on the menu (and I mean everything) has bacon, beef, pork, or all three on each one. Not a problem for me I ordered the beef dip sandwich with fries but the only option was the veggie burger for her. She ordered and OOPS - they were out! She then had to resort to fish and chips.  We got our food after what seemed like FOR-EV-ER (literally the long side of 45 minutes) and it was terrible. Her fish was small, undercooked and soggy. My beef was overcooked, dry and required every ounce of au jus, horse radish sauce, and ketchup to make it palatable.  We would have returned it but after the food was dropped off we didn't see a server again for 20 minutes (and I went looking).  Conclusion. Good spot for a beer (not drinks... a beer) - eat elsewhere (anywhere else)  Eatcrest Out"}
{"text":"This used to be the beyond fabulously rustic Outside Inn, and if you were ever spoiled enough to get in there, you'll be sad at the lack of adornments here, but that's not what I'm basing my review on.   While it's hard to cast aside my longing for the previous occupants, let us press on with pros and cons: Pros Good food for bar fare; not amazing, but good Great menu variety Local beers on tap scores a big win for me here, they have Bad Beat It does look clean/streamlined  Vendors pop in, setup shop, give free samples and discounted stuff (we got a free taster) Cons So it is streamlined, but damn, so much open space makes me agoraphobic; fill it in a little Smokey-as-hell...I know, I know. \"It's a bar!\" Pff. Kinda pricey I don't see an advertised happy hour; HH is one of the things that MAKES me come back  I've been here twice, just because it's close, as in stumbling distance, should I get too sloppy.  It is still a sports bar, and on that note, if PT's was closer, or in the same distance, I'd probably alternate; they're about equal, except PT's has \"THE GILROY\" pizza and a reliable HH."}
{"text":"I LOVE THE PINT!!! Their food and drinks are to die for! If you're ever in there say hello to Miss Lexie (bright blonde hair and beautiful blue eyes!) she is the best server ever and so fun to hang out with. The owner is a really awesome guy who's got plenty of energy so being in the Pint is always fun. My favorite food is the Mac n cheese and my favorite drink has to be the orange creamsicle tasting one. :)))   They also had/have karaoke every Thursday which is freaking awesome!!!"}
{"text":"This review is solely based on our experience with drinks as we did not try the food here. We were walking by after a Blue Jays game on a Thursday night and the girls were handing out papers for a free beer explaining that they were a new bar and it was completely free. We walked in and the bar downstairs was packed so a waitress mentioned that there was another one upstairs. We headed upstairs where it seemed to be a younger crowd and we fit right in. The bartenders were great very fast with taking our orders. The first one was completely free but we did fall into the trap and buy a few more. It wasn't too bad though because it was $4.50 beer night. There was lots of seating and a patio outside that looked really nice as well! We took a peek at the menu and it looked pretty good- I would go back for another drink and try out one of the appetizers!"}
{"text":"This place is a nice change from redrock where we spend a lot of time living in summerlin.  Being a beer drinker i like yardhouse for it variety but its always busy and trying to go on a weekend is a nightmare. Well thanks for the pint, they have a cool atmosphere with good beer choices, sports on and you can even play some pool or some videogames while you have a drink. Try this place out if redrock is too busy youll be glad you did."}
{"text":"I came here to watch the hockey game, and was served by 2 guys named Jake and Cory! They were absolutely fantastic hospitable and diligent during the hectic game! I had a great time! I will be returning for more games!"}
{"text":"Stopped by to check out The Pint. We were faithful customers when it was the old Outside Inn. We mentioned that when we ordered our drinks. We tried to engage the bartender, but he was busy chumming it up with his buddies. We were basically ignored. Got a very cold reception. A heafty tip was left as there always was, but we won't be back. We don't need the \"nose in the air\" treatment. Good luck guys."}
{"text":"Great place to go and see drunk bartenders gambling and harassing customers. Another fun thing is the bartenders asking customers to lend them money to cover their gambling debts, or telling you how they don't have rent money . The owners walk around with pissy faces and only want people losing  . I had to call police on a bartender who took out a knife in The Pint while drunk and belligerent. Other than that its great lmao."}
{"text":"Wednesdays here are particularly awesome - you get a basket of wings for only $4 with the purchase of a drink! They have other specials throughout the week too on both food and beverages. I hope they never change their prices.  To be honest I can't say that I've eaten anything here other than their wings but they are very good. The Pint offers 40 different flavours of wings so there's definitely something for everyone. My personal favourites at the moment are the Momofuku and the Electric Honey. One of these days I will get around to trying all 40 of them - still working my way through their selection.  They have several beers, wines, and cocktails to choose from. Pretty basic stuff.  I would highly recommend coming here to grab a bite with friends. It's a sports bar so you'll get your fix of TV as you dig into those delicious wings!"}
{"text":"I freakin adore this place!!! If your in the summerlin area late night I would highly suggest coming to see Bobby, one of the best bartenders I've met. He always accommodates my needs and makes sure the vibes match the customers. I'm vegan so I have a hard time ordering something healthy at bars around these hours. Thanks to Bobby for suggesting the veggie flat bread, minus the cruelty and the creative chef James for putting together something extra yummy for me I'm able to eat!!!! Come check this place out, always vibin here"}
{"text":"You can be sitting for more than 10 minutes with the bar almost empty and the bartenders rather ignore you to keep talking with their friends before they pour you a drink."}
{"text":"Fabulous looking place!! Great selection of beers...incredible food (try the insanity chicken wings...but don't touch your eyes when you're eating them)...outstanding, friendly service.  I was blown away!!!!!"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times now because a friend lives just down the street and although the good is decent (standard pub fare) the service is where they have completely lost me.   My second last visit is the only time we've have good service and the waitress went out of her way to have fun, tell some jokes and make it enjoyable when there were other factors out of her control. I would go go back if I knew she would be my server everytime but that never happens.   The last visit it took me over 10 minutes to get a water that was supposed to have no ice and a menu. Actually had to ask twice for a menu. Also had to order my food twice cause they forgot what I wanted (only had 3 ingredients to remember...) and then only came back once to fill up my water when I had to get another waitress to fill it in the meantime.   Now I know, you're probably sitting there like this guys high maintenance blah blah, I was at the bar in front of a pop gun and only ordered 3 things, water, coffee, omelette. It took over an hour to get food and most of that was me waiting for buddy to come back around. It was busy, but not to the point where anyone was slammed.   Gave them more than enough opportunities to win me over."}
{"text":"Great place for wings! We came on a Wednesday night for the $5 for 10 wings special, with purchase of a drink.  The staff are quite friendly and made some great recommendations. However, the service here (after you order) is practically non-existent. It was hard to find someone to get a water refill or even the bill at the end. One of the wings we ordered never came. We had to ask for it and it turns out they had actually forgotten about it. We got it pretty quickly and they also didn't charge us for it!  The place is also dark as hell--pretty sure we were seeing purely based on the light of the TV screens. We played \"guess the flavour\" most of the time, since we couldn't see colours or sometimes even whether it was dry or sauced. It wasn't necessarily a bad thing but just know you won't be seeing much if you're coming after the sun sets.   We got the Montreal spiced, Guinness BBQ, mango chipotle, Kansas City BBQ, maple, and honey Siracha.  The wings were all amazing! Very nice and crispy with a perfect balance of spice or sauce. The dry rubs were my favourite, mostly because of the extra crunch. The mango chipotle was a pleasant surprise with a very subtle mellow mango flavour as an after taste. The maple was also not overly sweet as most places make them. The sauced wings weren't overwhelming in sauciness and the flavours were really smooth.  I would definitely come back for the wings, this is my new favourite wings place! I feel like you can't go wrong with any of the flavours, they were all amazing!"}
{"text":"I was hoping for more from this place. It came up as one of the top pubs in the area, but I was disappointed. The staff seemed a little bit rude, and the patrons were few and far between. I managed to find one of my favorite beers on tap however, which definitely helped. I didn't have any of the food from the menu, so I can't comment on that. There are plenty of TVs, So you can watch whatever sporting event you'd like. The location is at the far end in a strip mall, so there is plenty of parking available. I will probably give this place another chance, so let's hope it's better next time!"}
{"text":"Came here for a visit pretty much immediately after it was featured on blogto. We ordered the full pint platter and chose wings, ribs and prime rib sliders. It came with fries, nachos, veggies and dips. The platter was nicely set up and we enjoyed pretty much everything. The only con would be that the sliders were a bit dry. Other than that, we really enjoyed our meal while catching up and watching the jays in action."}
{"text":"I walk here frequently. I love this place! Excellent pub to watch the Golden Knights! Great food, awesome people! GO HERE!"}
{"text":"When you walk into this bar, the entryway is designed to look like a bar's walk-in freezer, complete with kegs. It's a cool touch, and the service is pretty laid-back and cool, too. HH runs daily from 3-6PM, with $3 drink specials and $4 food specials, plus half-price flatbreads. Food is decent, beer selection is large.  PRETZEL BITES ($4, HH): Decent portion, served with a whole-grain mustard and canned cheese for dipping. Not bad, good for a snack. BEEF FLAUTAS ($4, HH): four or five rolled tacos, seemed to be baked instead of fried, with a soft exterior rather than the hard, crunchy version. Filling was decent, and the order was served with a drizzle of sour cream and a scoop of pico de gallo.  FLATBREADS (half off during HH): These range from $10-13 regularly, and are a steal during HH. Large portion is 8 pieces, flatbread is nicely crisp and topped with a thin layer of meats, cheeses, and sauce. I prefer the buffalo chicken version (includes celery and lots of bleu cheese) to the barbecue chicken (didn't care for the sauce). CHILI CUP: This was not on HH but caught my eye on the menu, made using ground chuck, black, and pinto beans, recipe seemed similar to how I make this dish at home. The cup was cheap (under $4), but the flavors just didn't do it for me, didn't finish this and wouldn't get it again.  DRINKS: HH drink prices are awesome, $3 for the featured beer, all house wines, and all well drinks. The house cab is actually really good, and the featured beer is made locally by Bad Beat- the Pint Pilsner, and it's delicious!  This is a great spot to catch a game, as they have the NFL and MLB package, as well as regional sports channels, and several TVs. Interior also includes a pool table, built-in gaming, and a few arcade games (Galaga?). Will be back in the fall when NFL season kicks up again.  NOTE: Join their text club (\"Pint\" to 71441) to receive discounts and event notices, like live music on Sunday nights and random texts redeemable for a free drink!"}
{"text":"It's a pub. Good food, good beer, good service, good music. It's a good pub!  The DogFish Head Lupu Luau IPA was surprisingly tasty! DFH always does a great job of making a delicious libation out of stuff (like coconut) that should not be in a beer that I like - yet I do like it!"}
{"text":"One of the Best local bars in Summerlin!!  I'm here at least once per week and always look forward to spending an hour or two after work with friends.  Upon my first visit I was pleasantly surprised by the food quality and menu variety...they've got anything you're in the mood for -- my friends and I polish off a basket of fries upon arrival (trust...they're addictive).   We (our little \"Pint Crew\") just love Alexis!!  She is an absolute ray of sunshine and she always picks up our chats right where we left off from our last visit.  Great Food.  Great Atmosphere. Great People!!  I look forward to enjoying their Midnight Happy Hour soon!"}
{"text":"Love this place for a burger and beer enough to give it 5 stars.  I'm deducting one star because of the diners who smoke in the restaurant."}
{"text":"Came here for some late night food. Was disappointed in our visit. The food really wasn't that great, and the service was bad. We paid cash and ended up getting the wrong change back as well. I ordered the Maple Chipotle Chicken tacos since I thought that sounded really good but I was let down with the flavours. The restaurant was quite busy that night since there was a late Jays game, so possibly that may have been the reason for the lack of attention at our table, but for the food? I'm not sure about that. The restaurant was so loud and so dark. I probably won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Love this place.. friendly staff, great ownership. Corey rocks, and So and steph behind the bar are always a fun time..  grilled chicken dinner is amazing"}
{"text":"I don't know why this has bad reviews, every time I've been the service is decent, food is good. Nothing off the charts, but not bad, either."}
{"text":"The worst service I have received in my life. I waited over 20 mins for my first drink and then the server questioned my bachelors and masters degrees. I have never been so embarrassed nor ashamed by the inadequacies of service. This is the worst pub w the worst service."}
{"text":"Sometimes my sweetheart and I stop in here for a few drinks since it's close by.  Stiff drinks and friendly enough service. The food is barfood and I wouldn't say it's stellar. ...it's just good enough.   Not in love with this place but happy enough to stop by from time to time."}
{"text":"Ok only complaint.......NOT enough memorabilia photos on the wall. Another 100 more framed pictures or so would have been perfect! Ok all jokes aside this place is awesome. I tipped my male bartender 25 percent......ya the staff is that good. Made us feel wanted and appreciated there. Went on a Wednesday night......and BONUS...free pound of wings! We will be going back weekly! Great work guys!"}
{"text":"HUUUUGE Place I can't possibly see it being completely full. Great place to watch a game as there's TV's and cool sports memorabilia everywhere. It's also right out front of the Rogers Centre so a great place to meet before or after a Jays game. I watched a few NBA and NHL playoff games here and will continue to do so!"}
{"text":"This [place it pretty cool. They have more Jameson bottles than I have ever seen. The appetizers are amazing and decently priced. The drinks are a tad on the pricey side but the pour is generous.  The staff was friendly, courteous, and professional. The craft beer selection changes with the season. But the selection overall is pretty robust.  The seating space is pretty unique as well. The have high tables and of course...the bar. But they also have a section that has couches and lounge chairs and a fireplace. And about the fireplace...a framed picture of 'The Most Interesting Man In the World'. Gret touch.  They also have boxing game where you can test how hard you hit and they have one pool table which seemed to have a steady rotation.  All in all we will be back!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Perfect spot to watch the game. Big HDTVs very well-sized for the space - this is not always the case, so it's worth mentioning. Reasonably-priced, good beer selections (including local brews) and super friendly staff.  The strong ventilation system was much appreciated as there were a few smokers at the bar. We left smelling like roses (Go Blue!)  I didn't have food, but I spied on others' and it did look tasty.   Funny-as-shit men's bathroom mural, too. I won't spoil it.  Parking is not easily visible from the bar, so leave your classic (or Ferrari) at home. Yes, I always consider the parking situation ;)"}
{"text":"WELCOME to the neighborhood THE PINT!! Great spot for Great Gaming...Good Food..Awesome Service..Fun Atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Great beer selection. Friendly staff. Jenny was our bartender and couldn't have been nicer or more attentive. Will def be back."}
{"text":"The best....Great Nevada beer!! Just ok.. Wings... the cook needs to go back to school!! The bar staff...talking and texting more than asking if you want a beer...but thats the norm now...in all very nice"}
{"text":"The pint has a great patio on their third floor. Not much for a view unless you get some prime seats in the side. There is only 1 TV up there so stay inside if your hoping to catch a game.   Service has always been meh.  Sit at a table instead of at the bar. I have had a few bartenders basically forget about me while being in their care.   Wednesdays get busy because if 1/2 wings and $29 table kegs.   Until they can train / get better bartenders and servers they will never peak over 3 stars."}
{"text":"Kind of weird. The first time I went in the server told me how tired she was as she was working a double shift since \"most of the staff walked out\"...interesting first impression. Service was, expectedly terrible.   Atmosphere is not warm or inviting. Almost like a cafeteria meets a bar. Went in a second time, ordered off the happy hour menu, during happy hour, but was charged full price. The server complained about having to fix it, but did. We had to wait approximately 10 minutes but not a big deal. The Pint has some of the FLUFFIEST pretzel bites I have ever had and some decent local beer. The cold atmosphere and lack luster service keeps me from going back unless I'm with my one friend who likes the local heff she likes."}
{"text":"4 1/2! What a cute place with an unusual twist on food. We stopped in for breakfast/brunch and enjoyed a classic (2eggs/sausage/hash browns) and their zucchini sticks-both great! Not the twisted food I'm referring to but I reviewed the menu and was very enticed by the hot dog wrapped in bacon and fried pickles etc. Only small issue was that a very large party came in and pretty much swallowed the waitresses time. A couple times I got up to get jelly, and then extra ranch-really not that much of a problem-and because I did Nick the manager felt the need (without being asked) to discount cuz of the inconvenience. We will be back and encourage you to stop in here for Sunday brunch instead of waiting forever to get into the Cracked Egg. Doesn't hurt that the NFL games are on or that the Manager likes Horse racing!"}
{"text":"When we were deciding where to eat in the Front Street vicinity, I was more than happy to see The Pint Public House metres away from us.  A quick look at their menu outside their door and we were in.  I wanted some comfort food!  (By the way, the prices on their outside menu were different from the actual menu when we dined in; the staff probably haven't updated it.)  There were no hosts at the hostess table so we walked further into the restaurant where we got the attention of some servers who then informed us that we could pick any seat we wanted.  The Pint Public House is a bar and grill restaurant, dimly lit, perfect for watching games on the flat-screen TVs over food and drinks.  After ordering our food with the server (whom we had to flag down because they didn't seem to arrive quickly enough for us to place our orders at first), the food came quickly.  We started off with the Beefshires, six 'Pint-sized' yorkies stuffed with roast beef, smothered in Pint gravy, and served with mustard and horseradish aioli.  Mmm, the Beefshires was the best!  The yorkies were puff pastries that were perfectly flaky and soft.  The roast beef was nestled inside the centre of the pastry and smothered with delicious gravy.  It was the definition of comfort food in the form of small bites!  I finished my share of this appetizer dish quickly.  The dollops of mustard and horseradish aioli were perfect complements too.  For my main, I ordered the Mac n' Cheese.  This was a house-made creamy cheese sauce with macaroni, bacon, and jalapeños, and baked with their three cheese blend.  It was served with two slices of 12 grain artisan garlic bread.  I downed this like no tomorrow and this comfort food dish fit the bill.  I loved how creamy it was!!  It was a really good mac n' cheese surprisingly (and fortunately).  The little bits of bacon were such a smart idea as well as the slight heat and spice from the jalapeños that didn't overpower the cheesiness of the dish at all.  It was a marvelous cheese mac.  I was fully satisfied.  That said, I wasn't a huge fan of the 12 grain artisan garlic bread though.  I didn't find that there was enough garlic on it -- I'm used to just plain bread toasted with garlic on it.  K ordered the 40-Way Ribs which included pork baby back ribs done in their signature \"40 Ways sauce\" -- Electric Honey sauce -- and served with Pint fries and house-made coleslaw.  These ribs were very dry and thus there was a lack of tender meat on the actual ribs.  The sauce was good though.  It was tangy.  The fries were good too."}
{"text":"Great selection of Beer BUT every server I watched didn't know how to pour a draft.Keep the Dispenser Faucet out of the Beer! Dunking the faucet of the tap into the beer as it fills is severely frowned upon. This is a major taboo since the mouth of the faucet could be carrying yeast or bacteria on the outside or underside of the metal faucet, and dunking this faucet into beer is unsanitary. Not only that; it's unprofessional. They never introduced themselves, so I wouldn't call this place friendly either."}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere here! Everything was neat and the bartenders quickly acknowledge you when you come through the doors.  Each bartender we have came across took the time to at least introduce themselves and when they aren't busy with a large crowd they actually try to conversate with you and get to know you a bit more. They all have been super polite and funny- great conversations.   The food is amazing here! I love their bacon wrapped dates and my spouse enjoyed their fish and chips. We've ordered a few different plates from them and everything has been super delicious.   It's one of our go-to spots when we have a night out"}
{"text":"Just ok. It's a nice place is clean and has a young vibe but the food was bland the habanero wings had no flavor but burned your face off while you waited for a refill which was exciting. The Bartender told us he took a round off the tab since my girlfriend gambled $20 and he didnt. They have good local brews from Henderson which was cool. Overall not impressed but you can make your own decision. I'm sure some people love it."}
{"text":"Late dinner as adults! We wanted to try something new! There was an awesome show/ one man band. We ordered the 12 piece buffalo wings. We realized half way through that we receive only 11 out of the 12. We didn't really say anything considering there wasn't much presence until we had to close out. There was only five guests in the bar and the bartenders just pretty much congregated amongst themselves in between guests. No wonder why this place is dead. There was what seemed to be a cashier bc she took our food order and the bartender took our order and poured our beer. Then she came back cashed us out but not even a word of farewell. I'm not sure about a second visit!"}
{"text":"Cool place to bee.  Chill vibes.  Good karaoke music and expensive for what taste like alcoholic water.  Worst screwdriver ever.   Pregame next time."}
{"text":"NOT Recommended. Still here waiting for my food taking time to post this poor review on this location. Extremely slow service. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Fun place to go to if you bring the right party with you. They do karaoke which I did for the first time in my life. The dj for this will work with you on your music selection. Bar keepers are decent, worth checking out. Cool location, love the front door look."}
{"text":"BOOOOOOOO!!!Went for breakfast, and we were met with the rudest bartender.  Great way to start the day lady!  She almost seemed angry we came in, mind you there was no other patrons.  She threw the coasters at us asked us what we wanted so of coarse I said coffee and water and my boyfriend ordered a Cosmo.  Worst Cosmo ever, so he asked if could get something else.  She was not happy! I gotta say I'm surprised with the service! We went the other night and had dinner, it was great food and great service! So note to self don't go for breakfast at the pint!!"}
{"text":"Hit or miss on food quality. The best thing about the place is the fast and friendly service. Interesting place but tight. Small selection on menu with what you expect from pubs."}
{"text":"Waited over 10 minutes and graveyard bartender didn't even ask if we wanted a drink."}
{"text":"Table of five - all agreed the food and the service was terrible. Waited 30 minutes for drinks, another 30 minutes before our order was taken.  When food arrived, it was all overcooked and thrown together without any pride whatsoever."}
{"text":"Fun spot!  Went bar hopping on a Tuesday night and glad we stopped in. Very nice atmosphere, and quite a few customers in there gambling, drinking, eating and just having a good time!  Didn't get a chance to check out the food but it looked good. Nice, clean bar and friendly bartenders.  Wish I could remember the bartenders name but I know she said she is extra board for the bar.  She was super nice. Will be back."}
{"text":"Initially, I was elated to find out this pub had a range of gluten free sauces and rubs available for the chicken wings. Considerably, less enthused when the waitress told me that all the wings available were breaded. Never again, was not that impressed with the nachos and limp carrot sticks either."}
{"text":"Ever since this place has gone under new management & service this place has gone way down hill, the service is as slow as can be & the new female \"not to be sexist\" bartenders have started it seems as if they try way to hard to get there tips & the general servers are as slow as could be, tonight it took over 30 mins to to get two orders of wings & too add it all up when the wings got to us they where mediocre at best it's far to this place has gone to the bottom of the barrel at best."}
{"text":"When you enter, you feel like you're briefly waking through the cold storage and beer keg refrigeration room:  definitely sets a cool vibe.  Inside is a high-ceiling, very open room, low and high tables, and booths around the outer walls, and an island bar in the middle.  TVs ring the establishment.  What makes it cool is how simple it all is.  First visit was for lunch during the week.  The place was quiet, service was friendly and frequent, and the food was definitely on the better side of pub food.  I had the Southwest Burger and my wife had the 5 Bs Burger.  The iced tea tasted very fresh!  Close parking can be tight.  This isn't unique to The Pint though.  It's just that side/end of the shopping center where The Pint is located.  The nearest parking is a narrow area squeezed between the building and Hualapai Way.  Not to worry though, you can always park just around the corner in the front of the shopping center.  It's not far at all.  During our second visit, the food was just as good but the service lacked a little.  The place wasn't busy at all but it seemed to take our server longer than necessary to make it back to our table for refills and to check up on us.  We finally had to go to the bar to ask for our check because our server disappeared.  Even so, it wasn't a bad experience but the Pint (for now) lands a solid 3-stars due to above average, then below average service.  Give it a shot and see what you think--it's definitely convenient if you live near Charleston and Hualapai."}
{"text":"Went here for brunch & it was laughably terrible. The quality was just so poor. I honestly wish they wouldn't have attempted to make breakfast food here. I got the veggie eggs Benedict & the guacamole was clearly from a package. Not sure what the hollandaise sauce was made from, but it tasted awful. The tater tots were the best part of the meal... And that's saying a lot. Honestly, I felt bad for the waitress. She was perfectly nice. She gave us free refills on our coffee, which she didn't have to. Note: they only have Keurig coffee... I'd love to say we only walked away with a funny story. But my friend is currently in the bathroom :/  I'd stick to another joint for brunch if I were you."}
{"text":"Went to watch a Basketball game, food was good, beer was cold.  Really enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Ouuu, the Pint appears to be at a rough spot on Yelp. Why so? My previous experiences here have been ok that I'll throw it's name out whenever me and my friends deliberate on where we want to loiter and drink at on 17th ave.  While I don't have the attention span to identify The Pint's beer selection in comparison to the other beer houses and pubs in the area, I'll say this. Wednesday nights....IS WING NIGHT, all of this man's four stars are solely invested in The Pint's bourbon rub chicken wing. GET IT. GET 20 or 30 of it. Then call me because I'll be there in an instant to help you kill that pile of bourbon-y goodness."}
{"text":"I've come here a few times. I like the staff a lot, good happy hour prices and very nice beer selection. If you enjoy watching the games they seem to have great tv's for that (but that area is not my expertise). I was hoping, deep down that this place would have stellar air / smoke ventilation but alas they don't. I have to put this is category with pt's but the close proximity to my house will mean I'll be back on occasion."}
{"text":"Fun local bar with a great atmosphere and a friendly vibe. They have plenty of TV's for watching the games and often have live music later in the night. The drinks are good and they don't skimp on the alcohol. The service is always top notch. The owner is accommodating and the bartenders are extremely friendly. Ask for So she's the best!!!"}
{"text":"We had a waitress on March 23rd at 9pm named Sarah. We went for my friends birthday hoping to celebrate and have a great time. Sarah told us she was hungover from the night before and her service clearly showed it. I was extremely appalled by her attitude and her level of respect. I've been a bartender and server for many years and never have I had such a disrespectful person serve me in a restaurant. We apparently didn't tip her enough (we tipped her 18%) and she thought she deserved more. I've been a loyal customer of the Pint for many years, but never have experienced such awful customer service."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere! Took my girl there for a drink & the bartender \"So\" was amazing! Very sweet & accommodating :)  Will def come back when she's there"}
{"text":"Nothing to complain about or to celebrate. Good enough selection and the Sunday evening I went in, it was packed but the rounds were coming quick. the female bartender was absolutely lovely and quick with my waters (I was driving) and asking if we needed anything else. The two men who came in behind the bar a cuple hours after we got there though seemed really irate about how rowdy everyone was being (in a bar, heavens could you imagine?) even though it really wasn't that wild in there. Was a group of singing irishmen in the corner but no one seemed to mind that, the tables adjacent to them had joined it lol! Haven't seen the patio nor tried the food, but I'd deifnitely be back. great location and nice enough staff."}
{"text":"Beer selection is limited.  I ordered a Newcastle which seemed around 8 oz - definitely less than a \"pint.\"  Food was OK, but not great.  Service was spotty and not very welcoming.    Will try again in a few months to see if things have improved."}
{"text":"Came here pre-Blue Jays game, when you walk in it's seat yourself - which we're not a huge fan of. You'll see 2 people seated at a table meant for 6 people or more. It's really disorganized and made us leave. While leaving we saw a table open up on the patio area and was able to get the seats. We ended up sharing our table with 3 others but it wasn't uncomfortable.   We were given drink menus and they have a good selection of drinks. Also, different deals at certain times too.  Ended up ordering a Caesar and a pint of beer. Also ordered the big platter. The platter is huge! Too much for 2 people but filling indeed. I love their fries and their creamy dill sauce! It looks different and tastes even better! We chose, hot dogs, chicken strips, and nachos. The nachos could use some more ingredients on it. Sour Cream on the side would also be good too. They charged $1.00 extra when I asked for extra creamy dill sauce, would've appreciated if the waiter had mentioned it to me beforehand instead of just sticking it onto the bill- Be aware and check your bill.  Overall, service was good and food was good. Would come back - but probably not for awhile."}
{"text":"Let me start my review with a caveat that I was there on a busy night with the Mayweather fight and a Stamps game. The place was packed and we were lucky to get a spot on the rooftop patio. The rooftop patio is an awesome spot!  Here's where the Pint fell short: - We told our server that we were there for a bachelorette party (a group of 8 girls). No acknowledgement, or even shot sent over to the bride. Nothing. The bride was barely even drunk when we left. - It took ages for us to even get our first round of drinks ordered and then get more drinks. I'm talking an hour to get one round. The server would ask one person if they wanted a drink, and then run away before anyone else could order. Even simple things like refilling water was a challenge. - They ran out of platters??? Yet had all of the foods required to make said platters??? I'm still baffled by this. - Once we did get our food, it took 2 hours for it all to arrive. - With all of these errors, there was no offer for a discount or anything to make up for the overall poor service. - I had a Yelp coupon for 50% off one item and the server had no idea how to apply it, couldn't find someone to help her, and asked if I wanted to use it next time. I'd already activated it on my phone, so it was due to expire. Regardless of that, I told her there wouldn't be a next time.  I understand that they were busy with the fight, but the fight was well-promoted and they had plenty of time to prepare and staff up. And if they were under-staffed/overwhelmed, they could have taken steps to provide better customer service. I will say that the food was good once it arrived. But the limited drink selection on the patio plus a zero for customer service equalled an overall poor experience. I would not go back."}
{"text":"Great place!  Many many beers on tap that i had not seen or heard of before and I know a LOT of beers.  If i lived in LV, this would be my 2nd home!"}
{"text":"This spot is the epitome of \"where everybody knows your name\".  The owner Nick does such an amazing job of working the room and making everyone feel special. It's a lost art in this city. Almost forgot to mention the food. Nick went to culinary school so you know the food has to be on point... And it is. Personal favs are the Hangover Burger, salmon and butter mashed potatoes and fish and chips. Continued success people!!"}
{"text":"One of the popular pubs near Rogers Centre, we came here for their pint o'clock specials and their wings specials as well. They have over 40 flavours for wings. I choose a saucy and dry rub one. Both were delicious. Each 1 lbs do not come with fries but it's still a very good for only $4. The wings are on the smaller size but the wings flavours are amazing! The Pint O'Clock features a few beers, wines and cocktails for only $5 which is a good deal. We ordered a few drinks along with a basket of fries to share. After we got our bill, what a price for 2 lbs of drinks and a drink. You can't that kind of deal in the downtown core so this is a place to be during game nights!!! Our server was super friendly and the staff here are great and working hard to making sure we have a positive dining experience. Overall, a great place to get your wings fix and to get cheap drinks. Would definitely keeping coming back to try their own specials and menu items! Definitely make reservations on some their game days and wings special days as this 2 storey pub gets packed!!"}
{"text":"This is solely my review of the place and I wasn't impressed one bit. For a place being called the \"Pint\" the beer selection is better than the average bar but not nearly what I thought it would/should be. The place was dead, our server/waitress kept checking on us and was very attentive so A+ for her.  The biggest complaint I have was the haze of smoke the floated the air like a fog machine. I know I know it's a bar and people smoke in bars... Well I don't smoke and I don't want to go into a bar leaving and feeling like a smoked a carton."}
{"text":"Came here for one of their trivia nights and it was great! Admission was under $10 with a ticket bought online. It was a really well organized trivia night, the questions weren't that hard but I love that they displayed the questions on tv screens all around and it started right on time and did not lag like other trivia nights I've been to, they also had great prizes The music was at an audible level for conversations and was spacious.  Service was a bit slow that night but understandable since it was a themed night. Between 3 people we split the appetizer platter for $34 which is about $12 per person split 3 ways and it was A LOT of food for 3 girls. It came with sliders, wings, chicken fingers, nachos and a huge pile of the best fries ever! It was great guilt food. The chicken sliders and nachos were slightly dry but the wings were good and the chicken fingers felt freshly fried. It was a lot of food and we didn't end up finishing everything so for $12 it was a good value especially for a tourist location.   Probably not a place I'd pick just to eat in the area but would definetly return for more of the themed trivia nights!"}
{"text":"I love this place.  The Adult Grilled Cheese completely hits the spot although sometimes it's not \"grilled\" enough for my taste.  However, I've never had anything in the menu that I didn't care for.  They do a good a job in the kitchen. The service is always friendly and it's nice to be remembered."}
{"text":"I have not found a better local hangout to soothe my professional woes as the Pint.  Having previous experience in the hospitality industry, I am happy to say that this local bar is a great escape from my professional tedium at least twice a week.  Cory, Dan, and Stephanie make me feel welcome every time that i come in to relax.  Although it is a rarity that I actually walk from Keno as a winner, I know that i will be treated well and respected for my Patronage each time I come in. It is my \"cheers\" and I feel at home there.  Highly recommend if you're a down to earth human who just needs the occasional escape from the harsh reality of life."}
{"text":"Pretty good beer selection with 8 rotating selections.  Solid HH offerings, especially with some local, strong IPAs for only $3.  Plenty of TVs with full sports package.  They overcharged us on 1 beer, but I won't hold it against them as I tried a few beers from the draft list before ordering to taste taste, so I'll happily add that into my bill cost.  Still has that divey nature to it with smoke and poker play at the bar, but I like it as a local spot to grab a fairly priced brew and watch a game."}
{"text":"Zucchini fries are bomb.com. Caesar wrap was ok. Pabstrami burger is fan-fuckin-tastic. Swiss shroom burger is a four out of ten. Buffalo wrap wasn't good. Fish n chips sucks. Nice lady bartender."}
{"text":"Recently stopped in at the pint for a drink with a girlfriend and it was a great experience . The staff is amazing and very friendly . Nick was very sweet and attentive . Corey was a awesome bartender and very funny. I love coming here now and so happy I stopped in because now it's my go to spot . If you're hungry I would recommend the zucchini fries and pretzel bites ! ."}
{"text":"Love The Pint! This is our new spot (when were not at The Martini) to grab drinks at in Summerlin. With a HUGE assortment of beers both on tap and by the bottle you will certainly find something you will love. From the San Franciscan beer Anchor Steam to our favorite Irish Stout Guiness this bar will keep us coming back for more. Nick is such a great manager and really knows how to keep his guests happy. You can tell the employees truly love working here and they are so nice and knowledgeable. The Pint is a HUGE upgrade from the former Outside Inn.  Oh btw if your in the mood for food try the Fish and Chips. AMAZING!"}
{"text":"To be completely honest, you're only going to want to come to The Pint for their specials.  On Wednesdays, they have 40 cent wings. That means that you can get a pound of wings for just $4.00. That, in tandem with the fact that they have a pretty great variety of flavours, means that you can have virtually All-You-Can-Eat chicken wings for a laughably low price. The wings are pretty good too. Just make sure to come early for dinner on Wednesdays, as there can be a substantial line-up after 6:00ish!  Also, the Pint has a ton of TV screens and the staff is pretty accommodating to the different games that people might want to watch, which makes this place optimal for the big game."}
{"text":"I just recently found this place and I LOVE IT! Their food is absolutely delicious and I come for the Strongbow on tap  Their zucchini fries are gigantic! Their mashed potato is amazing! Their steak is cooked perfectly to however you like! Their Super Mac is absolutely divine! The atmosphere is also very chill. I've seen people drunk off their butts walk out of there, i've seen older guests having dinner with a couple glasses of wine, i've even seen people bring their dogs after a walk from the trail nearby! They have an outside area where the dog and his owners stayed. Their service is amazing and the workers are very very nice! This will be a normal spot from now on!"}
{"text":"Awesome bar! The only thing the food lacks behind, is the amazing staff! Can't go wrong swinging by this bar!"}
{"text":"Great place for a few brews with friends.  Great seating and bar area and they even have a beer pong area for those looking to reminisce in that great ol' fraternity past time.  Reasonably priced and a good atmosphere, not too smokey or loud. Could possibly become a regular spot for me and my friends."}
{"text":"The Pint has become our new hang out spot. The space is welcoming. The food is good and the staff is personable and attentive. Nick the manager goes out of his way to get to know his guests. All the staff there seem to have longevity in tenure which is special when you can find it. Corey is our usual bartender & she treats us like we are her only guests. They've recently added karaoke 7-11pm on Thursdays which we are totally stoked about. THANKS NICK!"}
{"text":"This is simply a great local spot to have a good selection of beers at a reasonable price, as well as a tasty burger. The place is clean, open, and comfortable with plenty of seating and TVs. They also have a good happy hour at midnight (as well as a regular happy hour) that offers $3 bites and $3 beers.  I really enjoyed their Mushroom Swiss burger - it was a moist burger with great flavor from the Mushroom and cheese. My friends also opted to grab 3 different flatbreads. The flatbreads were kind of mediocre to good, but were also half off during happy hour. We agreed that the flatbreads were probably only worth it during happy hour. The veggie was pretty good, but largely due to the contrast in saltiness and sweet with balsamic vinegar. The buffalo had a TON of celery on it and was drenched in buffalo sauce, which just looked okay overall.  Service was good and prompt here, though our food came out at all different times which is always a bit awkward."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great food! Great beer selection and most importantly Great people! Family owned, where they treat you like family."}
{"text":"Was out for a girl's night and desperately needed drinks on a patio.  Having been to this place before knowing it can get fairly busy for games we thought the roof top would be perfect! It's a nice night no TV's outside, we don't need to watch the game and we could get some decent food. Wrong!   The patio was completely neglected by the staff. It also seemed as if they were unable to keep up with demands, under staffed and unprepared for the weekend.   Our event time line is as fallowed Arrival: 7:00  Drinks ordered 7:20 Drink reorder 7:25 was out of the advertised drinks  Drinks served 7:35 Food ordered 7:35 Re order food 7:45 our other order was unavailable (party plate)  Second round of drinks ordered 8:15 4 Drinks received 8:25  2 more Drinks received 8:45 2 Drinks received 8:50- still missing 2 that had been ordered.  The 2 waitresses were too busy flirting with friends at the next table.  We could not order additional drinks because they were occupied...  Finally food! 9pm we received one order of nachos... I took over an hour to get nachos??? We were 9 girls to the table left drinking water. Last of the food slowly arrived, by 10pm bills arrived with a wing order that had been forgotten and had to get adjusted. That's right 2 hours for wings.  The manager would not provide a discount for the incontinence or accept the yelp check in coupon.  I was so hungry I could not even tell you if the food was good.  If you head here don't go on a busy night you won't get service"}
{"text":"This used to be Baton Rouge. The Pint, I gather, is a chain from Alberta. I'm not really sure why anyone would want to franchise this by-the-numbers cookie cutter pub with a forgettable menu and forgettable interior. 40 beers on tap but a really dull selection of beers. Food portions are small, but at least they don't over charge, as is the custom these days in Downtown Toronto.  Service is pleasant and friendly and location near Skydome will probably ensure filled seats."}
{"text":"Food are great, and bartenders are fantastic and are catering to players, but Karaoke every Thursday night is not good. Karaoke DJ caters to her own personal friends that are going there and not giving the audience and players the good time and chance to sing and have fun. Boring Karaoke than anywhere else. Will not recommend."}
{"text":"Cori and Double D were very attentive and friendly bartenders!  Food was great with excellent variety of draft beers. We'll definitely be going back when we can!"}
{"text":"I was here a couple on Sundays ago as I thought it would be a good place to watch football. Yes, they have a LOT of TVs, and a good beer list, but those were the only \"good\" parts. The atmosphere was DEAD...there were at most 6 other people in the place, which should have told me something. I would have thought there would have been a good crowd for Sunday afternoon football, especially since there were no other teams playing in town. The food was terrible and overpriced (had the mushroom burger with bacon, which was $20, and had some brown \"secret sauce\" which was just plain bad, not to mention the bun was stale) and the service was abhorrent. The staff, because it was so slow, spent most of the time huddled together around the bar talking to each other. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Went on Wing night Wednesday with a Co worker, the wings were mediocre, not a lot of chicken more bone and the sauces I got were subpar. I guess you get what you pay for with a 4$ per pound deal. The restaurant was really busy but the wings came out reasonably fast."}
{"text":"I was in there the other day for wing night. Now I realize that this is a pub, and I should expect pub quality food, but this was way below average. It seems to me that they aren't even trying. Calling some of your flavours 'dry rubs' and using popcorn seasoning is a bit of a cheat. And not putting enough seasoning on to even add flavour to the wings? My friends & I ordered 5 different wings and they were all pretty much plain. To top everything off, the service was really slow. What's the point if, as a business, you don't even try?"}
{"text":"When we couldn't decide on what to have for dinner, this place \"won\" by default. I ordered a veggie burger with fries. The burger was pretty decent. It was VERY LOUD though. So we were basically yelling back and forth at one another. It was also super dark inside. I'm all for ambiance, but not to the point that I cannot see the menu or my meal. I would recommend this as a good a place to check out a game."}
{"text":"Great fries!!! Husband ordered the  Pastrami burger & I got the classic burger - both with regular fries. Husband really liked his- said the Pastrami was tasty!  Both of us liked the fries and thumbs up to the ranch dressing. We also had the pretzel bites w/ cheese and mustard. Also good.  I would  give 3.5 if possible. Service was prompt and the server was attentive.  He even offered to put the game on the screen closest to us.  Has basic industrial  look to it- smells like smoke upon entering but not overwhelmingly so.  Wouldn't go out of our way to come back but it's a solid neighborhood place."}
{"text":"Food was mediocre for bar food. Layout is also a bit weird with a lot of different seating room. Service was okay. May give them another try if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Alright food, good beer selections, a little pricey for what you get.  Food was good but not great."}
{"text":"I came here on a Wednesday night (Oct 11) with a couple of other people for their Wednesday wings special (roughly $4 a pound of wings) and they did not disappoint.  I ended up splitting 16 pounds thus 16 flavours between 5 people.   Staff was very friendly and we were well-attended  The standout flavours were \"Mongolian BBQ\" and \"Hotiyaki\".   The \"Momofuku\" flavour was peculiar as it was very reminiscent of instant noodle seasoning which makes some sense since Momofuku is a noodle restaurant nearby  My only complaint would be that the wings weren't tossed well enough so the sauce coating wasn't evenly spread out."}
{"text":"Not bad of a place, friendly staff, laid back. They have a pool table and ok beers and food to choose from."}
{"text":"I came in the other night. loved the atmosphere and the food was amazing. got the hangover burger and was not disappointed. if you're looking for good food, good beer, and good service definitely stop by the pint. I also have to give a huge shout out to our server Alexis she was so kind and attentive. it's not too often you get genuine waitresses like that. we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Tried this place out yesterday for the first time. The service was great. Fries were delicious. Friendly atmosphere. Clean. I would stop in again."}
{"text":"Poor service here. We sat ourselves and waited awhile before being approached. On a Saturday afternoon, I'm surprised by the lack of service here and it was just disappointing.   The beer selection was decent but when my boyfriend received his \"Rolling Rock\" it was flat and had to get that changed. Our server was nowhere in sight so my boyfriend walked up to the bar instead. The bartender was more friendly than our server.   As for food, we ordered the mozzarella cheese sticks to snack on. It was average at best but nothing worth mentioning. The rating is based on the horrible and lack of service received. I don't think I'll be coming back here either."}
{"text":"I can't really review this bar because I was not allowed entry. The bouncer told me he wasn't going to let me in because he could tell I had been drinking at a previous bar. Is that criteria for not allowing entry? I know it's the establishments right to refuse entry but it's a bar. A sports bar. A place where people come to drink. I was absolutely coherent and not rude or disrespectful in any way. He said I \"swayed\". I guess that's enough to be turned away. All the best \"The Pint\". I guess it's a fancy place for sober people."}
{"text":"This gaming pub's main focus are the local LV beers, but they do have drafts and bottles from around the world. There are a bunch of seasonals, too.  Easy parking, clean restrooms, immaculate kitchen and even a small outdoor seating area. To nit-pick, it smells smokey and air felt stuffy. Lots of tv's. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"Favorite sports bar in Summerlin! Super cool industrial environment, Great happy hour and great service!! Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Current review:  OMG I never thought I would get kicked out of my seat! Who does that?  I only give this place 3 stars because the previous bartender really deserves 5 stars but the fact that I was told to move out of my seat and I was asked if I wanted a to go box should have been a sign that I was getting kicked out. IVE NEVER BEEN TOLD TO MOVE!!! I'm appalled!!!  It's so sad how everything can change in one visit. I will NOT be coming back!! I decided to leave the premises.   If you ever come to this place and don't want to be moved. Don't settle your bill. Better yet, find a different sports bar!  Previous review: This place is great during lunch hour and dinner time. The games are awesome and I look forward to seeing more games at this bar. The staff is friendly and the crowd is pretty cool. It's my second time here and all I see are people who treat each other like family. At only 4.5 miles from home. This is better than a local bar. Definitely worth the drive."}
{"text":"I usually stop in this place once a week to grab a cold one and get some food. Although I pass 5 other taverns on the way home I come here not only because of the great food, but also because of the friendly & great customer service I get from Corey.  She remembers me by name and also my better half. She knows our drinks and as we get seated they already on the bar waiting for us. It's really hard to find service like this now days. I rather drive an extra few minutes and get customer loyalty service, other then just go somewhere we I get average. Please give Corey kudos!!! You need employees like this to ensure security for the future of your establishment."}
{"text":"Don't go here. I've been here multiple times, and it consistently takes over an hour to get your food. The latest visit was especially offending. Let me relegate my story.  We got there at 6:45 on Taco Tuesday, and immediately ordered our beer and tacos. The beer came. The tacos didn't. So we ordered another beer, and they came. Again, no tacos. After an hour, we excitedly see our tacos come out, only to go straight to another table that came half an hour after us. We tried to cancel our food and leave, but nobody could even find our bill. Turns out our waitress left without telling us, or putting another server on our table!   We left and went to home & away across the street and it was amazing!"}
{"text":"one of the worst places in Toronto to go! I ordered Taco Tuesdays. Plain Horrible and tasted like paper and cold. Menu says $4 and bill came out to $12 + tax. False Advertisement. Waitress was kind enough. Don't ever go!"}
{"text":"Ordered a side of fries, but got a cup of ice. Finally got my fries only to be burned by the spiciness they claimed to not have added (even my entire party's lips and mouth were burning) aka they messed with our food . The server, Sontauna, also failed to remind us that the tip was already included so she left with a really good tip she did not serve."}
{"text":"I was very pleased to see a nice and clean sports bar here in summerlin. The pint has about 11 Tvs, a pool table, golf machine and  even a pretty modern junk box. There are also several slot machines throughout out the bar.  What I enjoyed the most was the large selection of beers and mix drinks. The snake bite and the Michelada beer were great! We ordered the da brat and the bacon wrapped dates, which were better than your normal bar.  We had the opportunity to talk to Nick who is the guy in charge. He was very friendly and attentive! He and his team tried to provide us great customer service by checking on us on a regular basis! If you are looking for a clean and laid back sports bar, this is definitely the place to go The only bad part is that the bar was too smokey!"}
{"text":"6 friends and I came here on a Wednesday to watch an NBA game.  Food: (4 stars) The wings are pretty small, so 10 wings for $5 is a decent price.  Note that the wings do NOT come with fries, veggies, dipping sauces... However they are very flavourful.   Lemon and pepper (4 stars) - very strong flavour of lemon, if you do not like sour, do not get this.   Guinness BBQ (4 stars) - good quality.  At the end, 20 wings and a beer came to $23.00 .  Service: (2 stars) We came at 8:40 in order to watch the game from 9.  When we ordered wings, we were informed that you need a drink as well (this was not anywhere in the promotion).  We were informed that PBR is on special for $5.  So we ordered that.   When the bill came, we were charged $7.50 for the beer, when confronted the waitress she said that it must have been rung after 9 at which the special ends.  She did not try to apologize or anything, pretty much said it was not her fault.  (-1 star from the whole review) She also added tip of 18% for the whole group (even though the menu states it is only done for groups of 8 or more, we had 7).  (-0.5 star of the whole review). The only reason the service gets 2 stars, is that they did switch the channel for our table to NBA.  Ambiance (5 stars): The place is very large, with lots of TVs.  Perfect for a game and wings special.     Special Note: Cannot make reservations during the BlueJays games. The other reviews mention $4 for wings, and a drink purchase is necessary on Wednesday. it is now $5.  They also do have a special that you get 1 order of wings for free with a purchase of a drink, after your initial time being there.   (They give you a card for this).  I will come back here on Wednesday for the special with the card."}
{"text":"I do like the Pint, this location just opened in Calgary and  I must say it's incredibly busy! I love the layout, having three floors with a rooftop patio is awesome! I know there is a lot of negativity associated with this place, but I'm not sure why. The food is average, however people need to remember it's pub food, you can't expect a three-course dinning experience. There is a huge line up to get in if you go after about 10 but this is true of a lot of other trendy places in Calgary. Overall I had a pretty good time, it was busy, but we found a table, ordered a table keg and enjoyed the evening!"}
{"text":"After the Blue Jays game, Gord and I had supper at The Pint, which is next to the Rogers Centre.  They opened less than a month ago.  I haven't been to this site since it was Planet Hollywood many years ago.  It was jammed downstairs.  We grabbed a table upstairs.  Gord and I split an order of Berkshires.  I liked them, though Gord wasn't crazy about them.  They could have been hotter (they were barely warm).  We both ordered wings.  Gord got his lightly dusted with Cajun spice.  I got mine with Honey Garlic sauce.  We both liked the wings and would get them again.  There was a bit of a crisp to them.  Michelle was our server.  She was friendly and took good care of us.  I'd go back.  The food was good and there was a fun vibe."}
{"text":"I like the transformation they've done here. It's much more upscale than the prior bar. They have a decent beer selection. We were very pleased to see Anchor Steam on tap. There are a few different video poker options including triple play. I've been here a few times and they seem understaffed. It does take a bit to get your drink."}
{"text":"As a gaming bartender I understand you're more personable with regulars, but how do you get regulars? By being nice and paying attention to customers you dont know yet, especially when they are gambling. Stopped in today for lunch and to try my luck because I love the pint and usually come on Monday nights for match point Mondays. Was coldly greeted by a blonde bartender, ordered my drinks and food and then had to flag her down for refills when she was stopping to check in on people to my left and right. 350 dollars later I ask if I owe anything. I receive a bill for my food and proceed to ask what the slot comp policy was. 300 gets you free food, when I asked her to check my coin in she tells me its hard to keep track of coin in when I dont have a card, as my card is sitting in the machine, and besides that you can check the bill history for the last 24 hours on jet gaming machines. Still left a more than fair tip even though she ran away. Maybe I should just stick to my Monday nights"}
{"text":"Best fish and chips I have ever had! We came here around 10pm on a Saturday night and the place was full! Very loud music, people were dancing, having a great time here! Self seating but the waitress came in a timely manner. We had a couple of drinks before ordering food. We sat a bit away from the dance floor so actually be able to hear each other haha. My husband ordered the chicken tenders and I got the fish and chips. It was truly the best fish and chips I have ever had. They were very hot. Perfectly fried. The batter flavor was amazing. PERFECTION! I highly recommend. We walked here from the CN tower and they are open late for night time fun. Come here!!!!"}
{"text":"Wow! Just walked into this place, wanted to check it out since I moved here. Bartender didn't care whether I had a seat or not, lots of folks in there, not playng. She just let me walk out. Too bad, I got plenty of money, I'll spend it elsewhere.  Not welcome at Pints. Sure is nice inside, really disappointed."}
{"text":"Don't know why this place has so many rough reviews. It's a pretty good place for what it is, really just a really big sports bar that kinda turns into a club on weekend nights. Usually grab drinks from the bar when we're drinking and watching sports or dancing and I've had nothing but good service from the bartenders! Have been there a handful of times for dinner when we want to watch UFC events we don't get at home, food is good for bar food, service is never like anything to brag about, but definitely nothing to complain about either! Burgers and wings are both really good, have heard great things about the mac and cheese too! Sometimes there's cool DJs on weekend nights, overall a fun place with a good location."}
{"text":"Love the people and the atmosphere!  Good food, excellent customer service, and great gaming. Definitely my favorite hang out :)"}
{"text":"Went there for Thursday evening and I really loved their loaded nacho. Added beef and guac on it and it was just perfect with cheese and jalapenos. Would not really recommend their berry mojito tho...."}
{"text":"It's important to me to walk into somewhere and have a friendly, attentive staff. The Pint has this. I always feel like it's an upbeat place and serves good drinks and food. The plus is that the staff is great. If you live nearby and like a local spot to be comfortable,  this is it!"}
{"text":"I came here once and the service and food on the patio was amazing.  Everytime since then I've tried to eat here, the servers have ignored me for 30 minutes before finally bringing me a menu. And then ignored again.  No drink order...no food order.  Asian waitress tonight stood by the bar chatting up flirting with a customer and ignoring us.  Never returning..."}
{"text":"Good food and who would complain about beer? The waitress we had could of been a lot better as it wasn't that busy at the time."}
{"text":"We used to frequent The Pint on Sundays fairly often.  However, this past weekend marked the third weekend that the \"entertainment\" decided not to show up.  Either it is time to book a new singer or stop advertising live entertainment on Sundays."}
{"text":"Just recently started coming here. It's down the street from my house, which is perfect. I work in another bar across town, and prefer to unwind from work closer to home. Josh has been wonderful to me. Super friendly and great service, of course. A fellow graveyarder, it's usually pretty quiet when I'm there, but the other folks I have met, barstaff, guests, etc... have all been cool, nice, and chill. And there's always a drink to match my mood- be it a more subtle cider or a generous shot- and sometimes a snack for the late-night munchies. This is definitely my new choice neighborhood bar :)"}
{"text":"First experience: Super Bowl Sunday 2015  we were overcharged by 200$ without any compensation and our server knee. The place is very clean All of the bartenders and servers are very friendly and attentive. Their food options are incredible and very unique (not your traditional bar food.) beer is very affordable  Second experience: we sat at the table for  20 minutes with no one attending to us. I walked up to the bar and the bartender literally snapped at me saying uh someone will be with you and pointed to my booth. Our server was really nice but all he had said is \"sorry hope you weren't here too long\" and didn't check on us after at all except once to ask if we wanted more drinks. The place wasn't even empty. I just wanted a beer.... Then when the check came we waited for 10 minutes and I had to go up to the bar ...."}
{"text":"Not a bad choice for a casual meal or drink right downtown.   Came here on a Tuesday night and had a decent time. I didn't feel particularly blown away but there was also nothing awful about this experience.  The location is prime, although it's somehow also awkwardly situated up some stairs on a corner right in front of the aquarium/rogers centre, etc... It's a long narrow space with a patio, I liked that they had outdoor tvs to watch the Jays games but they also had really loud music which usually i'm ok with but I wanted to have a conversation with my friend and felt weird yelling especially because the place was quite empty.   We ordered a couple of drinks and the nachos to share. The nachos are massive, I'd say share this with a group of 4. Guac and all those accoutrements are extra as expected. We had asked for no onion but unfortunately still received them. No big deal, my friend just doesn't like onions but if it had been an allergy issue, that would have been a problem. The nachos were thoroughly covered in cheese and the usual nacho toppings and there was plenty of sour cream and salsa. It looks like there are lots of drink specials, we had some $5 pints of bluemoon, If I can remember correctly, which is a great deal considering its location.   Service was not bad, waitress mostly stayed out of our way, once we were seated she came over and started talking to us but was then called away by another customer and she just kind of left while we were trying to ask her a question, it was a bit off-putting but she was ok the rest of the night, not particularly nice but not rude or anything. As for the actual restaurant it's pretty nice. I would say it looks like a typical sports bar type of place. If you dropped me in here without seeing the name of the restaurant, I could easily mistake this for a Kelseys or Jack Astor's, in terms of the interior, food and even the service. Again, prices are pretty on par with what's in the area with the exception of their specials which are good.   I can see tons of people coming by after or before a Jays game, it's the perfect spot to be wearing a baseball cap, super casual and relaxed atmosphere, plus it's steps from the Rogers Centre. Personally, I'm not sure if i'd go out of my way to return or recommend this place to friends as there are tons of great, unique spots in the area that I would just rather go to. If I ended up back here though, I certainly wouldn't complain!"}
{"text":"If I could give this place less than one star I would.  Hair in mac and cheese.  Burger had a bun that was stale and the meat tastes like chemicals.  The guacamole wrap had barely any guacamole despite that being part of the name.   The waitress clearly wished she took up another career as she said two words to us.  They have one desert which is a flight of three types of cupcakes but when we went to order they only had one type left.  This place is AWFUL. Definitely set up as a tourist trap with overpriced awful food with awful service.  Do not waste your time."}
{"text":"This is a great place to go if you love a great sports bars. They have lots of t.v's so you can basically see the game from almost anywhere you are sitting, a great selection and choice of sizes of various beers, and a very extensive selection of chicken wings. It's a new hip with a cool decor and two levels. I have been here twice and have been very happy with the food, drinks and service and I really loved the wings here as well."}
{"text":"This a great place. I have been here twice. The first time I was there during happy hour on a Friday and noticed that the place got busier after happy hour was over. Even when it was busy I never felt crowded or cramped. The second visit was on a Sunday afternoon (before football). The place was pretty quite. Both times the service was exceptional. I will be coming back to The Pint."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, friendly bar staff, great food and all the drinks! Karaoke is on point."}
{"text":"Excellent service. Love that 100% of the bar isn't covered by poker machines. Food was good and beer selection was good at reasonable prices."}
{"text":"I would give 5 stars because I love this place but, I have a couple of requests to make this bar 5 stars. The first would be to expand the menu a touch. Maybe a couple more on the healthy option. The second would be that they expand the jukebox selection. I love touch tunes jukes but this bar has it too limited. You can here country or top 40 and very little more. I love indie music and touch tunes has an amazing catalog but not here."}
{"text":"They left the shitty machine in from the old place.  The bar does look better. I have to agree with others about the smoking."}
{"text":"So this is a decent bar with decent drinks at decent prices. That's not a wining endorsement, I know, but I can't think of another way to describe it. To be honest, the place doesn't stand out in my mind in any way. The clientele are the usual bar-going crowd, the waiters and waitresses wear very tight clothing in black, and the drinks could be stronger for the price. It seems like every other bar of that style on 17th or around.   Granted, that doesn't mean I didn't enjoy it. The drinks come in boots and the space (especially the patio) is nice and comfortable. On the second floor on the weekends there is a DJ and some space to dance so not a bad time.   I'm just saying that you shouldn't expect to be wowed by this place, and I wouldn't travel to go here. However, if you're in the area and need a spot to get a drink, this isn't a bad place to go. Sometimes, it's ok to be average."}
{"text":"Overall I enjoyed it and would probably go back, maybe on a less busy night of the week.   Pros: food was good...we both had burgers reasonably priced  nice atmosphere, clean once we ordered the food didn't take long to come out they do have some happy hour specials I'd like to go back and try  Cons: Music was a little loud for my taste took a bit for a waitress to come over and take our order (it was a Friday night and I get that,Mao I would try a different day of the week next time) smokey, my biggest complaint for sure"}
{"text":"I dig this place. Good beers, great zucchini fries and flat breads! Also, a pretty decent beer selection! I also love the fact that they have happy hour on Saturdays"}
{"text":"A variety of circumstances led my wife and I here for a late lunch on Christmas day.   The place has a good ambiance, both inside and out. Over in the corner is a group of couches, which looked like a comfy place to sit and watch some TV while enjoying a beverage.   We sat at the bar, and the bartendress, Jordan, was super friendly. As the name would imply, they had a large selection of beers on draft, which made me happy. Unfortunately for my wife, who is a wine drinker, they only had three red wines to choose from, and the one she settled on -- Cabernet Sauvignon -- was not very good.   We ordered the martini flatbread, which was edible, but not much else. It was a little under-cooked, and the onions were overpowering.  I had two beers, and would have had a third if my wife had been able to find a wine she enjoyed; instead, we left, and the only chance of me returning would be lunch by myself, or with a beer-drinking friend."}
{"text":"Came in with a friend a few nights ago to tie a few on after work. We ordered zucchini fries and a few other apps. Zucchinis were fried perfectly, came with delicious sauce and all of our food came out fast!  Corey and Dan were super friendly and accommodating, and made us the tastiest, zestiest Bloody Mary's I've ever had. The Pint was great, would definitely recommend to other friends!"}
{"text":"I used to love coming here when it was the Outside Inn. Pretty old school I know. I was sad when they changed hands and never went back.   Desperate for breakfast and my normal go to spot was really busy, we decided to go in. It was pretty empty but that's ok for me. The waitress was awesome and got our drinks right away.   We ordered the breakfast burrito with avocado and the steak and eggs. It took a while to come out, I think that may have been a trick to get us to order more beers but we were fine with that.   The food came out and it was hot. The steak was cooked perfectly and the bf enjoyed that. My avocado came on the side which was weird and the burrito seemed to be grilled.  It did not say that on the menu and I would have preferred it not to be grilled. I like a soft fluffy tortilla. But it was still really good.   I liked how friendly everyone was and how many locals were in here eating. It felt like the Outside Inn. Good times. I will definitely be back and this will probably be my new breakfast spot. Prices were also very reasonable. Get in your rockets and go check it out."}
{"text":"We made reservations through their online form and got a friendly quick response from the manager.  Unfortunately we were late.  Some of the guests arrive and informed me when they got there they weren't treated very well.  They were told our table was given away (understandable) ... they waited but were ignored the whole time.  We decided to go somewhere else.  Not sure if I'd be willing to give them another chance because of this.  --Update--  A few months after my initial review (April 14th, 2014) I received a message from the manager of the establishment.  He proceeded to apologize and let me know there would be an event to try and win us over.  I have yet to hear back (over a year later) and so my review still remains, 1-star.  Probably forever."}
{"text":"I dunno where to start. Josh and DD are jus cool Regular dudes. Flat breads are awesome. Local beers. Homemade bbq sauce. Happy hours sweet. Stop in."}
{"text":"Nice ambience... The food is ok for a bar... The music was good, and the service friendly... The drinks were not bad.. I would go back as I liked the ambience and the music.."}
{"text":"I can tell why this place has the rating it does. But sometimes proximity is what matters, like I thought it did to me. Nope, I'd avoid this place if possible. Just look at the so called \"soup\" I ordered (and uploaded a picture of). The waitress herself fully admitted that most people send it back the way it's pictured: virtually untouched!  Despite the place being near empty, service was mind-numbingly slow. The waitress didn't seem to know the menu and wasn't able to make food OR drink recommendations. None of the tacos, burgers, or wraps we ordered were anything special.  However, the sharing platter was pretty good which saves them a star. So there's that."}
{"text":"The Pint looks to be a promising venue in the Summerlin area. While its name may be simple, they have a fairly good selection of craft beers. There are not a lot of stellar options or anything new, but it gets the job done. Most of them are from local breweries which I think is great. The decor is quite plain and nothing unique. I like a bar where I feel like I can be there for a few hours. I didn't quite get that vibe from here but I'm willing to give them another shot and get food next time too."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have wanted to try this place for a while and we just did recently. We stopped in for a late dinner and for some drinks.  Unfortunately, we are always too late for the mid day happy hour and too early for the late night one,  however,  the deals seem to be pretty good--they offer 3$ beer of the day.   We were greeted immediately and took seats at the bar. The bartender gave us menus and some time to look over them.they have a number of items that sound delicious and making a decision was hard. I decided on the mac and cheese with jalapeno creme sauce and chicken---so delicious!   My boyfriend also ready enjoyed his burger and had the best sweet potato fries that we have had recently --he eats them A LOT.   The drink selection is great and they have some awesome local beer as well!  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Nice place and gracious owner.  Came in with some friends had a really great experience and a patron says your in for something VERY special !"}
{"text":"Cool local Gaming bar in Summerlin. Food is good service is solid. Jenny the bartender was slammed and still touched everyone and kept the ball moving. Well done Pint it's our 5th visit and we will be back."}
{"text":"Was trying to find a local place close to my new condo. Found them on Yelp. The place is newer and really nice. Has one pool table, doesn't smell smokey like a lot of 24 places do. I had the salmon and it was just ok. Needed seasoning badly. But the pretzel bites were really good! I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"I attended an event with a local beer group and this was my first time at The Pint.  First of all - this place is REALLY far from me. I probably won't ever be back, unless I happen to be in the very near area.   Overall, it was a good experience. It's a typical bar, but they happen to have an excellent beer selection and quite a few local beers. I ordered the zucchini fries and they were AMAZING! It was a huge order and I wasn't able to come close to finishing them. They were really yummy.  The service was only OK. I don't really have any complaints, but they weren't fantastic either. But it wasn't anything that would keep me from going back. Only the distance would do that - ha!"}
{"text":"I came here by myself for the first time a few months ago in the middle of the week at lunchtime, so it was dead. I decided to sit on the balcony and that was just okay. There wasn't much to look at and the decor is dated and tacky. However, with that being said...Maybe I was just super hungry but their wings? Their wings guys?? Hands down the best I have come across in the city so far. Lots of delicious meat to chew on, cooked perfectly, tons of fantastic sauces and rubs to choose from and the wings were drenched in sauce, which is 100% my style. So good. Plus I loved the huge basket of waffle fries! Yum. Yum. Yum. For pub food I was super impressed. Also the bartender was friendly and attentive. But more than anything, my rating is for their wings."}
{"text":"I really like the atmosphere and the service has always been decent but the lack of drink specials and menu prices is the downfall. I don't go here anymore because there's way better options a little further down 17th."}
{"text":"Reading the reviews below which coincide with my experiences. Unsurprisingly, I'm told this business has shut down."}
{"text":"For the bar and grill genre, this place is pretty good. I got full eating part of the chicken strips and pretzels and cheese appetizers. Both were delicious and perfectly cooked at the same time. My parents went on to get a burger. They said it was pretty good. They aren't big burger people so that says a lot. I'm definitely going back to try it out.  The atmosphere is like any bar in Las Vegas. You can smell the smoke but it wasn't too overwhelming. They have a decent beer menu. I tried the bad beat heff and it was good. Honestly for a place called \"the pint I expected a bigger selection of beers. They do have a full bar with gaming at it.  Service was a little slow for a Tuesday evening, but the food came out quick, hot, and right. Whether your looming for a drink and a snack, or something more substantial I'd give this place a try."}
{"text":"Not a place we plan on returning to. Only real cool thing about the decor where the door to enter the place looked like a freezer cooler. Once you are in the place it is a big room with a bar in the middle of it with tables only on the edges of the room. It stunk of stale cigarette smoke. The service was slow. Very friendly staff just under staffed. Happy menu only had three items for food and three deserts. We ordered the pretzel bites and edamame. You got about 20 bites and two different sauces. Warm and soft. The cod and shoe string fries were nothing more than frozen food heated. Thankfully the fish wasn't over fried and the fries where cooked just right. About $5.00 overpriced. The pastrami burger and sweet potato fries where spot on. Two employees were working. The female stayed at the bar glued to one 20 something young man while the other 8 people watched on. The only other worker took care of the rest of the customers. He was very good and attentive.  Apparently happy hour doesn't start at 3pm as advertised as we sat down at 4 pm and paid full price for our drinks. Cost the nice young man a larger tip. I can see people enjoy this place only as a place to drink as long as you are not planning a nice meal."}
{"text":"My bf and I came here to eat here and we ordered burgers, and they were RAW. The chef said that medium rare is practically raw and I was like ummmmm... not true. He still decided to keep arguing that medium rare was raw so we just decided to leave."}
{"text":"DO NOT GO!!  Unless you enjoy being taken advantage of. I would of rated this establishment -2 but i can't. I am here now, service was terrible. When I finally received my order and the bill came, I found out that they over charged. When this was brought to the attention of a manager, the manager conducted themselves in a very hostile manner. This place is a disaster. Please do yourself a favour and do not go."}
{"text":"This is probably a decent sports bar, but as a restaurant they fail incredibly. Just a very hungry tourist and we walked into the nearest place serving food utterly confused whether to seat ourselves or if someone on the waitstaff would show us a table. I even made eye contact with a waitress and she just went back to flirting with the bartender before we approached her to see if we should seat ourselves or not.   We then sat down pretty close to the entrance and watched as several groups came in just as confused as us and with no one approaching them, they just all left.   The food? We ordered a steak sandwich which was so incredibly tiny and measly. What kind of sandwich is just a small steak with two pieces of tough bread?! It was so unoriginal and difficult to eat. We tried their poutine which was fine. Not spectacular. Their Mac n cheese was real skimpy. Tasted good but it came out cold since it seemed they wanted to serve all the food at once and cheese is cheap. So why wasn't all the pasta covered with it?   Overall, terrible place to stop in as a visiting tourist. Food OK but not worth it for the price. So-so customer service.   P.S. Unimpressive beer offerings"}
{"text":"Unlike many people, we miss the old Outside Inn, so we zipped down Hualapai to try out its replacement.  The big space seems a little bigger now, but maybe because it's a bit more industrial-looking.  It's strictly seat-yourself, with a small smoking section of tables set further from the bar than than the non-smoking ones.  Makes no sense at all, since the non-smoking ones are closer to the smoking-okay bar.  But for you fumiphobes out there, they do have a powerful ventilation system, and we didn't smell anything other than food and beer.  When in a pub, I usually order cider instead of wine.  Why?  1. More drink for the dollar.  2.  It's usually on tap.  3.  Since I'm so little, I can get a buzz from anything.  Call me un-American, but I just don't like beer.  At first I was disappointed that the only cider they had was Strongbow, since I thought it was one that was too dry for my taste.  But after our server, Jen, brought me some to sample, I realized that I was thinking of some other brand.  This was just the kind I like.  Hubby had a pilsner, which he enjoyed.  I threw diet to the winds (so what else is new?) and ordered a California Reuben, which is made with cole slaw, rather than sauerkraut.  Herb went even more whole hog, and got the pastrami burger.  We both agree that this is the best pastrami we've had since we moved to Vegas - tender, lean, and delicious.  Not as smoky as New York pastrami, but that'll never happen here.  Still, The Pint's pastrami is #1 West of the Rockies in our book, and we know from pastrami.    The burger was freshly made, and on a roll that looked incredibly shiny and wonderful, though I forgot to taste it; I was too busy inhaling my own sammich.  He loved it, and it didn't turn into a soggy mess.  He also ordered a side salad ($3 upcharge), and it was a big bowl of greens, with some carrots, and cucumber and tomato dice as garnish.  His burger came with a choice of slaw, fries, or sweet potato fries (no upcharge!), and he was able to get a mix of the regular and s.p. fries.  The regular ones were just ordinary, but the sweet potato fries were outstanding, and I don't usually like them!  What I like about The Pint is that, although the menu isn't all that large (e.g., there are only 5 dinner entrees offered), almost all of the food is freshly made.  And that includes the burgers, buns and, I think, the s.p. fries, too, which is why they tasted like real sweet potatoes.  Our waitress, Jen, was excellent and professional, though she pissed me off a bit when she carded a group of eight, but not us.  (That is a joke, but if I have to explain...).  We'll be back, but it'll be hard to try anything else, because I know we'll be jonesin' for that pastrami!"}
{"text":"My girl and I came here a couple days after opening. It looked way better than the bar before it and the food was much better as well. They have a bunch of really cool options like an \"adult\" grilled cheese sandwich and a twist on bacon wrapped dates.   The bartenders were extremely attentive and the place had a super happy vibe. Our bartender, Jordan, was on top of it and even helped us out when an order came out wrong, which tends to happen when a place is only a couple days old.   The only critique I would make is that I would like to see crazier beers here (sour beer and more Belgian stuff.)  All in all, it was a really cool bar close to my house and I will be back soon."}
{"text":"Omg the fish and chips get it !!!!!  Fucking love this place everyone is so nice and service is on point"}
{"text":"Excellent beer selection on tap. Summer shandy and magic hat #9. Food is also super good. BLT+avocado is a must try. Friendly staff and it looks like the machines pay out pretty well."}
