{"text":"Great authentic Cambodian food .... Portions could be slightly bigger but still pretty decent"}
{"text":"This is definitely a hole in the wall with amazing food story.  The menu is quite extensive and all made from scratch. It seems to have a very devoted local following as it's almost full every time I go there.

This place has THE very best won ton soup in Montreal. The broth and dumplings are both exceptional.   Don't expect traditional Chinese food however. They offer Cambodian, Vietnamese and Laosian fair.

I've tried about half a dozen of the over hundred dishes that Asie Moderne offers. I was delighted with every one of them.  The portions are good, the price is right and service is friendly."}
{"text":"One of the most authentic cambodian food in Montreal. The service and the food is really good. The price is also affordable.  Durian smoothie is the BEST."}
{"text":"I went to Asie Moderne to try one particular dish.

I ordered their sour soup with tripe and beef.
 
I was very happy! I grew up eating Cambodian dishes and the soup taste just like my mom used to make it."}
{"text":"This is a somewhat informal, low-key restaurant in an unassuming commercial area of Montreal.

The restaurant was empty as we arrived before dinner time.

We ordered the Cambodian soup, fried tofu, chinese broccoli with oyster sauce, imperial rolls, vegetable fried rice, and two soursop juices.

The soup was very good, somerhing like a tom yum soup.  It had lemongrass, tomato, celery, and straw mushroom.  The fried rice was also good, especially with the pickled hot peppers that are furnished on every table.

For some reason,we did not receive our broccoli or drinks, and the owner/waiter did not check on us or ask us if we needed anything or advise us that the chinese broccoli is unavailable.

Also, a complaint we have about this and other similar restaurants is that they are \"vegetably challenged\".   They tend to use minimal vegetables of the lowest grade such as celery and carrots, and do not include other asian vegetables such as greens, bamboo, baby corn, mushroom etc, which add variety and flavor.

In this case, there were at least five vegetable dishes on the menu, and the owner/waiter told us three of them were available, yet apparently none of them were available.  It may be that nobody ever orders these and that's fine, but if it's on the menu they should keep it in stock.

This restaurant has been in business 30 years and I guess they do not need our business, but it's unfortunate, as the service,food and experience could be a lot better, and good southeast asian restaurants are sorely needed in Montreal."}
{"text":"One of the hidden gems of Saint-Laurent. This is genuine authentic cambodian food! The service is very kind and friendly and very fast as well! I ordered the ginger chicken and it was delicious, would definitely order again. For the price, it was for sure worth the money. If you guys really want really good and authentic cambodian food this is really the place to come."}
{"text":"Coming to this restaurant for almost 20 years! Always delighted by the quality and taste of their cuisine."}
{"text":"The chicken pad thai is really good.  Portions are large and service is quick.  Try the lolak and the imperial rolls.  For desert, try the jackfruit smoothie.  Prices are cheap. Cash only."}
{"text":"Food is ok and service is fast but it's cheap. So I guess it's not bad. Though the waiter sucks couldn't keep his eyes off TV screen. I still go back just because it's close to my place"}
{"text":"So I decided to go to this place with my fam jam after looking at the reviews. I have been looking for a good place that serves delicious pad thai and I was glad I came here :)
The chicken fried rice was not too oily and it was quite flavorful. We also took the spicy chicken stir-fry. We knew it was freshly made as the veggies were super crunchy. 
For dessert, we tried the Jackfruit smoothie. Not too sweet and filling, the size of the smoothie was large (we regretted not splitting it between 2 people).
In all, this would possibly my go-to place from now on for authentic Cambodian food!
The service was pretty good too."}
{"text":"I'm wondering whether this restaurant changed ownership, since my experience does not at all match the positive reviews from 2009.

I ordered Singapore noodles. The noodles were dyed yellow, but tasteless; boiled rather than stir fried. The ratio of noodles to protein/vegetables was 97/3... I picked through the tasteless mess for any signs of protein or vitamins, then tossed the rest.

The woman working there didn't show any facial expression.

Not worth the money at any price."}
{"text":"Must try dishes and drinks:

Fried dumplings 
Papaya salad
Cambodian Classic Meat soup 
Beef noodle dish
Durian smoothie


Asie Moderne is diamond in the ruff for so many reasons.
Like most authentic Asian restaurants it's decor or external facade won't win it any design awards; it's cooking on the other hand... Wow.

 I've been coming here for many years and I think the reason I love it so much is because it's different. They specialize in Cambodia cuisine which isn't something many Montr√©al restaurants offer. The cuisine is like a mix of Korean BBQ and the richness of Chinese Szechwan. They also offer other Asian dishes, the classic pad Thai, general Tao etc... If you want a truly memorable meal ask the waiter for the signature Cambodian dishes. 

If you like trying new things and aren't picky I would suggest trying the Cambodian soup, a very unique citrus lemon grass broth with some veggies and a lot of delicious beef. 

I would also recommend the Papaya salad, which is kind of like a refreshing coleslaw taste to it, but with a spicy kick. 

Lastly try the Durian smoothie. It might not be for everyone, as the waiter told us it's a hit or miss kind of drink and our table proved his point. Me and my girlfriend loved it, while our two other friends hated the taste."}
{"text":"Cheap and good ! Had the Singapore noodles and the three colour rice and they were both awesome"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by this nice little restaurant. The food was fresh and full of flavor. Order the Thai soup with catfish, just delicious. If you are in this area, come out and meet the host Long. He speaks 5 languages French, English, Cambodian, Vietnamese and Chinese."}
