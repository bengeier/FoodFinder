{"text":"I've been to this hidden gem  twice, after walking by the location dozens of times without realizing that there's such a large cozy space hiding behind the front doors. They have a good selection of home-style baked goods from wheat-free brownies, shortbread, walnut-banana bread to deep dish caramel apple pie. I asked for an almond milk latte and there was probably a half inch of delicious crema sitting on top of my cup. The space is cozy, ideal for a hang-out or study session that feels like sitting in someone's living room. The service is excellent and the baristas are some of the friendliest in the city (no snobbery!). Definitely coming back to play some board games & to catch them singing along to Andrea Bocelli (apparently most of the staff can sing!). Do yourself a favour and pay these guys a visit"}

First off, it's good to note that this cafe is subset of the church. The church is located at the back and the cafe is at the front. I believe they play church songs. Even if you're not a believer in their faith, I don't think this should deter you - at the end of the day, you are supporting a group that needs a bit of assistance in your community. 

Back to the more important review for you yelpers :) Central Coffee is very dim with no natural lighting. I prefer to have natural lighting when I work so this was a con for me. It is quiet which is good because you can work in peace and there is free WiFi. There is a lot of seating so if you're a big group, you won't have trouble finding a seat. I had their coffee and it was nothing special."}
