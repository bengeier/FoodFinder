{"text":"If I could give 10 stars I would!! Que Sazon is the best!!! We recently used them for our wedding and they were amazing from start to finish. We went to a food truck festival last year in search for who we wanted to cater our back yard wedding. We were there all day and found a few trucks we liked, and then stubbled upon Que Sazon and thought we'd give them a try. They were the absolute best there! Their food and service were the talk of the evening at our wedding, people are still talking about how amazing the food was! Julie, the owner, and her family were so friendly and easy to work with through out the whole process. I would recommend them to ANYONE looking for delicious food and impeccable service."}
{"text":"We caught these guys at Sloan Park for a preseason game--what a wonderful surprise!  All of the food was excellent and the family running the truck was very nice.  A great bargain for ballpark food as well."}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of eating these tacos last night at the KUPD Brufest. There were many other tacos to choose from (and I tried several other vendors tacos) but these tacos are simply and deliciously made. It is now. E morning after and I am still wanting more. Not to mention the family running the truck was very nice and on top of getting food out the window!  Great tacos!"}
{"text":"Looking for something healthier than the bread and cheese and fried choices you normally have at a food truck and was happy to see grilled chicken and rice however they give you alot of rice and not really enough chicken or other toppings to offset that much rice. So basically $9 for a lot of rice a little chicken a little beans banana slices and sauce. What wasn't rice tasted really good though"}
{"text":"Amazing! We had loaded fries with chicken at the art festival that were super delicious. Not only was the food great but the family who owns the truck are so kind and inviting. It was raining so we were offered their chair so we could sit under their awning with our baby and eat. We were so gateful for the hospitality. Definitely would recommend!"}
{"text":"It took a 360 degree trip around the Cubs' Sloan Park stadium for me to settle on lunch.  An authentic Chicago dog (green sauce and all) was calling but the rice bowls at Que Sazon won out.  If you're looking to eat only one meal today, get yourself to Que Sazon as these rice bowls (about $10) contain enough protein and calories to sustain you until tomorrow.    While waiting for two rice bowls (El Duro Original and Pollito Asado) I watched a customer walk off with his shoebox-sized order of fries.  Que Sazon doesn't skimp on portion size.    The El Duro Original is a behemoth of a meal:  slow-roasted marinated pork, chimichurri, BBQ sauce, black beans, plantains, white rice, cojita cheese, sriracha, and chipotle aioli.  The Pollito Asado bowl was equally goodie-laden and similar in size.    Lots of competing flavors vie for attention in these rice bowls and the whole messy creation is good enough for ballpark or food truck fare.  I'd certainly stick my fork in it if someone else bought it but I might only spring for it again were 1 or 2 others agreeing to share it with me.    Why, you wonder?  2 reasons:  1) The overall flavor profile grew a bit tiring after a while and 2) more room for the Chicago dog.    Consume one of these rice bowls on your own and any vision of a Chicago dog will remain a dream for another day."}
{"text":"Another day at work and another great experience with a local food truck stopping by! I like how the cuisine is tailored to South American cuisine which close to my heart being from Ecuador . The pollo asado meal is simply the chicken chunks, white rice, black beans, plantain chips with chipotle dressing on top all in a box ! I was definitely full when I devoured this meal. Hope to see you again at the workplace soon!"}
{"text":"First time at the Que Sazon truck the other day and let me tell you take their advice when they tell you what is the tastiest most popular items on the menu are. I do t think I ever would of tried an El Duro Rice Bowl on my own. So much flavor in such a small package and so filling. I couldn't even eat dinner later that night. I also tried my very first empanadas. The way they present it is just as beautiful. I can't believe I went 30+ years without trying something so yummy! Live a little people. Try something new. If it's from the Que Sazon you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"The food is authentic and delicious!  Good people who work hard and make amazing dishes!  I would recommend you getting this truck to your business.  If not, find out where they are located next for some amazing Columbian grub!  Yum yum!"}
{"text":"I thought i had tried this before guess not, wanted to do the rice & chicken. You get a lot for $8 but overall I just wasn't impressed with the flavor? Tasted like Rice-A-Roni flavoring with shredded chicken and lots of onion bits. I think they added too much oil or cooking oil my food, i could taste it."}
{"text":"This is one of my absolute favorite food trucks! They came to my work a couple weeks ago and I have been dreaming about their food ever since. I got one of their bowls and all the flavors.... just wow. It was a little sweet and a little spicy. My favorite part was the crispy plantains with the different sauces on top of the bowl. I can't wait for them to come back to Gainey Suites!!"}
{"text":"OMG! I eat out a lot and I this is one of the best food truck I have tasted! Yummy! Please come back to Centene ASAP! The El Duro rice bowl and empanada is legit!"}
{"text":"Excellent food truck with incredibly tasty Colombian food. Food is prepared freshly made to order with quality ingredients with a little something special. If you like South Central American food you have to check this truck out. On top of it the owners and workers really are there to assist and help you make good choices on their delicious food. I had a shredded chicken taco which definitely was one of the best ones I've ever tasted. And I also had an empanada. Which was very tasty as well. Excellent homemade sauces really sets it apart from other spots."}
