{"text":"More of a biker bar then anything else. If your going to be on 25th there are so many cooler places to go. I tried their jalepeno poppers and burger -- terrible. Not to mention they only give you like 4 fries with your burger. If your looking for a nice night on 25th go anywhere but Garage Bar and if your looking for a god burger and fries ABC Tavern is your spot. . . They do have a good beer selection though, I'll at least give them that."}
{"text":"I didn't think it would be my kind of bar. But put enough roller girls in a room, and suddenly it starts looking so rosy.   Staff is amazingly friendly considering the crowds they deal with. It really makes a difference."}
{"text":"this place can go from completely empty to stacked full of people in a heart beat. motorcycle friendly. people friendly. beer friendly. and awesome people watching times.  though when i asked to open a tab, she gave me my card back and i couldn't hear what she said.  apparently the tab was still open, but you hold onto your card so you don't forget to leave without it.  i find this odd.  and it's a good thing i asked before i left if i had to do anything else, because they still had to close out the check. odd. drunk people must really not know what to do with tabs."}
{"text":"I'm pretty sure I love this place, except for the fact that it's so far away from me...well not TOO far, but when you're drinking, things get further away, you know?   Since my first review, I've been back a few times and each one of them was an improvement on the last. The most surprising for me was The Blue Ribbon Bluegrass Band. I guess I misjudged (shouldn't have judged in the first place) the types of music that would be featured here. The band was really good and the crowd was lots of fun.   Everyone I've met here is super and friendly and that especially makes this bar fun for me. The outdoor patio seems to be where I always end up, which is nice because I hate to be stuck in crowded areas inside. Little bit of claustrophobia kicks in and I immediately hate everyone around me, so perhaps the patio has saved potential friendships here. The bartenders are nice and quick on their feet, which is nice as well. Don't expect too fancy of a beer selection, though they do have a pretty extensive list. This bar just makes you want to drink a cheap simple beer though--it's less about the beer and more about the times you are having there."}
{"text":"Only experienced the outdoor patio...and only drinks.  Cool atmosphere.  Motorcycle friendly.  And be ready to flash your tats!  I hear 80s night on Friday is a great night to be there."}
{"text":"The Garage Bar is a fairly new live music venue in Ohio City, and conveniently located for bar-hoppers.  I had the burger and fries plate (very good) but haven't tried any of the other food selections.  There are a wide variety of draught and bottled beers, as well as a unique menu of shots (all with sexually provacative names), which you can mark off on their own Shot Club card as you finish them, and receive free Garage Bar gear after the shot club card is complete.  I've seen my co-worker's band and another rockabilly band there a few times, and the sound system was pretty good.  The walls are covered in colorful metal filling station signs, with vintage motorcycles and gas pumps placed in strategic places to add to the atmosphere.  There is also designated motorcycle parking outside, and a patio seating area for those wanting to avoid the crowds watching the bands."}
{"text":"So just how bad do you need to get out and find a lover?  THE UP-SIDE:  A fun and lively place with a mostly pleasant staff.  On Fridays, they also play a great mix of 80's music that doesn't dwell on the starndard 80's hits.  None the less, this place is best if you are experiencing one of the following scenarios:  A) Your same-sex friends wanna get out to a meat-market type atmosphere and cut loose.  B) You have just broken up with your significant other, are completely devastated, and need to suck-face with a random stranger, quick.  THE DOWN-SIDE:  This place may be fun, but it sure ain't classy.      THE SUM-IT-UP:  This place is a glorified meat-market."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time with no thoughts good or bad. Actually, not many people have told me they have been here. Damn glad I went!!! What a cool dive bar. Small, cozy, intamite, and throw in live music, some good people watching and you have a success in my book.   And to top it off, good beer prices that didn't want me to throw myself from the top of the terminal tower. I will be going back to enjoy another few hours of enjoyment listening to some music."}
{"text":"We ride our sportbikes to the Garage every now and again when the weather is nice around here and I gotta say that if you are in the right frame of mind...  Things happen...  *wink wink*  They play old 80's (did I just say \"old 80's\"??) music which the cougars just love!!! The dance floor isn't huge but thats a good thing 'cause who doesn't like bumping around with hot chicks while dancing??  Oh yeah Ursula...POC baby...(Pride of Cleveland)"}
{"text":"The patio was pretty chill. Laid back people, friendly staff, and a dog here and there.   I was a little disappointed, the Mojito happy hour (or whatever they call it) on Fridays -- the drink was really fantastic. But it was not happy hour priced. $6 a drink in my book is full price."}
{"text":"The Garage Bar quickly became one of my favorite places to hang at.  I joined Roller Derby with Ursula, owner of the Bar, and it is now the main sponsor of the Burning River Roller Girls.  Their official afterparty is there and is quite a sight to see.  But I have since retired and I still love going there.  Yes, Ursula is fantastic!  But it is more than a meat market (though yes, admittedly at times it can be). It is quite eclectic and I love people watching.  From Bikers to Rockabillies to Rollergirls, to Corporates, to Gays, they all have the Garage Bar as its stomping ground.  Patio is amazing and try their tots."}
{"text":"I'm hipper than you...oh wait, I'm a total dork. But they let me in anyway. It's really like a garage on the inside! They open too late on weekends though, I mean, if you're shopping WestSide Market you need a beer in the afternoon. C'mon"}
{"text":"Stop in a couple of weeks ago. Service was good and the food was good. Liked the patio and the decor was pretty cool."}
{"text":"decent dive bar close to the Westside market. Went in here to kill somr time in the afternoon and spent a long time playing skeeball and drinking cheap beer.  cheap prices and a good place to get a buzz."}
