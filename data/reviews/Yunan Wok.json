{"text":"This used to be our favorite, however,  they recently changed their name  to China Wok and their new recipes are a huge disappointment. The fried rice was dark and heavy,  the Broccoli beef had a strange taste,  and the love in was also dark and odd tasting. We will never order from here again."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why the bad reviews. Tried takeout today for the first time after receiving the chopsticks and menu at our doorstep. I thought it was a cute idea. The guy I spoke to on the phone was super nice.hubby went to pick it u and he said the same for the gentleman working. I love the fact that they have combo meals, as I'm from the Midwest and all Chinese places there do but very few here do. Hubby said place was very clean and had an A rating grade from the health dept. I ordered general Tao and he ordered house chicken. The chicken was really all white meat. It came with fried rice and a crab angel and a spring roll for about $8.50. The portion size was perfect for me. Food was served in plastic containers making it easier to eat out of than the usual styrofoam. The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because the fried rice was meh. It didn't have any egg or really any flavor. We will definitely be back though! Everything else was great including the price!"}
{"text":"This place is now called China Wok. They put a menu on our door and we went to check it out the next day (today). If you are from NY or NJ you will love this place! Delicious food! We had a shrimp egg roll, order of fried wontons, cashew chicken and shrimp in garlic sauce. There are no leftovers, only planning for what we'll order on our next trip!  The egg roll and wontons were light and fresh - not greasy at all! The main courses had super fresh veggies, light and flavorful sauces and they automatically include soy sauce and hot mustard packets with fortune cookies on your order. Three years out here for us and we've finally found a place that is as good as Jersey chinese!  We had take out but they also do delivery and they have old school tables with built-in seating. You know the kind, made of formica and found in any Chinese or pizza place back east. Definitely a keeper! China Wok, same address as this place here."}
{"text":"I was disappointed.  The food was adequate, although the delivery was fast, there was sauce spilled throughout the bag of food."}
{"text":"The food is good but I have only had a few dishes.  It's great for those nights that you don't feel like cooking.  The delivery was fast and the food was hot when it got here."}
{"text":"Last night my wife asked me if I wanted anything when she was going out shopping, I said, \"sure get me some egg foo young/\" We'll she brought me home some of the worst egg foo young I have ever eaten anywhere from Yunan Wok. She has been begging me to stop there for weeks since she got a flyer in our house door. I checked it out on Yelp and it confirmed much of what I had already thought, too expensive and even worse the food reports were awful.   We'll now I can concur. My egg foo young had to be premade frozen patties. They do not put the meat in the omelet mix, rather serve it with the sauce. I can say there was an ample portion of barbecue pork in my order but it could not make up for the awful patties. The texture was grainy. No sign of fresh bamboo shoots, bean sprouts or anything else that provided texture. My wife's chicken and broccoli was nothing to write home about either. We are used to getting a container of the main course with a separate container for rice. This was served in a typical to go lunch container, which in itself wouldn't be that bad, but the portion was small, and I mean small.  My wife will not shop there again for sure."}
{"text":"This place is just ordinary, there is nothing really great about it except that they deliver.  the best item I had on their menu was the shrimp in lobster sauce, the sweet and sour and orange chicken tasted like it was previously frozen and similar to something you can buy at costco in the freezer isles. They are a bit overpriced, but I think most of the asian food in Arizona is overpriced and lacking in authenticity."}
{"text":"Been ordering from these dudes for a long time and usually wait until my wife is on out of town and I'm not in the mood to cook. Ha!  The inside of this restaurant is a little scary and pretty dark. I've never really seen anyone eating in here. They do have a little fish tank with some big fish swimming around in circles and looking for attention. I get hungry just watching them.  Most of their menu is your typical American style Chinese and nothing that would be considered authentic or what they really eat overseas. It is hard to find the real stuff and when you do they end up closing.  Always order the Volcano Beef and have them make it extra spicy. The House Lo Mein is also very good and my wife seems to enjoy that one the best. Usually upgrade to some Fried Rice to take things up to the next level.  This place is probably best for a night of heavy drinking and getting it delivered to the house. The food is ok but the prices are higher than other places with a similar menu. The delivery times can also vary depending the crew that is working that night.  More or less this place is a Meh experience with slight touches of A-OK. The best part is you will have some tasty leftovers the next day to work off any type of party residuals. BEER ME!  2.5 STARS"}
{"text":"BUUUUUMMMMERR!!!! We ordered \"dinner\" from here tonight and were seriously disappointed.  Let's start with the egg rolls- I could have bought something similar at the grocery store and heated it up in my oven; I'm not even sure the \"crab angels\" had anything more than cream cheese inside of it.  Furthermore, I had ordered Shrimp with Lobster Sauce was pretty clearly the shrimp with vegetables.  And they don't have beef chop suey on the menu.  Seriously?  Really?  REALLY!!! I would have called to complain but after reading the other person's review realized it simply wasn't worth my time . . . We'll never order from here again."}
{"text":"This isn't a review of their food - but rather of their means of advertising.  STOP DROPPING YOUR CHOPSTICKS IN MY FRONT YARD!  If you want my business, get better reviews (i.e. better food/service).  I had to dislodge your chopsticks from my tire yesterday!!  Annoying....."}
{"text":"Now called China Wok. No idea why these guys don't have at least 4 stars!  Gotten take out at least 3 times now for dinner and each time it has been great!  Reasonable prices and great food!  We ordered chicken Lo mein, orange chicken, and broccoli beef to share and it was very tasty!  Large portions so we have left overs and they even have a lunch special for cheap!  Will be back as usual!"}
{"text":"Tried it for the first time and the last time....over priced icky mushy food with extremely small portions. I called to inform them and got a very slight sorry"}
{"text":"I have not tried many dishes on the menu here, but what I have tasted-keeps me calling once a week for delivery. The food is a little overpriced based on the portion size but it's worth it. The Mongolian beef is the best I've ever eaten! The flavor is a tad on the spicy side, and I normally don't like spicy food but I will crave this particular dish and only from here. I've tried many other place but nothing compares. The beef fried rice is different to look out bit taste wonderful, even better as next day left overs. Egg drop soup is a little plain, but a great comfort food."}
{"text":"I ordered them last night for the first time and it was pretty bad.  I actually thought they were the Chinese place on Tatum and Bell, turns out I was wrong.    I ordered Chicken Fried Rice and it was seriously an embarrassment to the Chinese culture.  Probably all Americanized Chinese food is an embarrassment, but you get my point.    My rule of thumb is that if you are going to eat at an \"ethnic\" food place, the people working/cooking there should be of whatever decent the food that is being served is, that wasn't the case here.    Major thumbs down."}
{"text":"This was my first time in this place..my aunt and I were skeptical at first as the parking lot was empty.  We walk in and no one is there except the owner.  We order moo goo gai pan, chicken with green beans and wor ton soup.  We really enjoyed the moo goo pan...very tasty.  Not too many drink specials and the ice tea was not too our standard we thought it was regular ice tea but he brought us green tea in a bottle.  I would try it for delivery as it's near my house."}
{"text":"Oh this place is really really bad!  Such a waste of money, and it's rather pricey too for take out.  The egg rolls were worse than the frozen supermarket ones, they were totally mushy on the inside and no flavor.  The pot stickers also tasteless as well as greasy.  Shrimp Lo Mien, VERY greasy, no flavor and the poor little shrimp were so overcooked they were also completely tasteless and very chewy!  Over $40 for this and it pretty much went straight into the trash.  I rarely will throw food away but this was not edible.  I do not expect take out to be gourmet quality food, I do expect it to be edible!!!"}
{"text":"Holy PooPoo Platter Batman!  This place really sucks!  After waiting 2.5 hours for my food (and several calls to the establishment asking where it is) it finally arrived.  It was crushed, leaking out of the containers and was so mixed up I wasn't even sure if it was what I really ordered.  Half of the order was already cold.  Trying to make the best of the situation I sampled something that looked like the closest thing to what I ordered.  YECH!  It was either F.U.B.A.R. when it left the kitchen or became contaminated by something else in the bag en route.  That food was Naz-TEE!  My family is now starving and we have been told by the restaurant that in order to receive credit for the food, the driver has to come back out and pick it up. Peachy by me...  My trashcan is too good for this crap.  We looked at the food and would rather go hungry anyway.  I just hope they don't \"re-gift\" that little gem into someone else's order.  Hell, for all I know that's what they did to us.  Poor food quality. Poor service. Poor delivery. And a little pricey for all of that.  Yunan needs to take a long walk off a short pier. NEVER GOING BACK!"}
{"text":"Been eating here for a long time. The previous owners retired and the new ones are just getting on their feet. No problem with the quality or delivery times so far, will continue ordering from here!"}
{"text":"Before I talk about the food I must say that this place is crazy expensive.  We tried this place because it was close and got tired of driving down to 7th Street for Pei Wei or Flamingo Palace. The pork fried rice was decent,  the house chicken was not at all good and the chicken lo mein was simply terrible  And for this less-than-mediocre food you pay more than Pei Wei and approaching P.F. Changs.  Next time I want typical chinese fair, I'll drive the extra few miles to Flamingo."}
{"text":"Great tasting Chinese food!  Barbecue ribs are amazing"}
{"text":"Wow... This place is sooo bad.   Lo mein looked good but the box probably had more flavor.  Apparantly 10 packs of duck sauce is all the seasoning this food gets.   Overpriced, very, very bland.  We love Chinese food (especially delivered) but I'm finishing this review on the toilet :("}
{"text":"Ordered sweet and sour chicken and pork fried rice.  Neither was good, we threw it out.  My husband did like the egg drop soup."}
{"text":"1 star is too many. We were hoping to have some good Asian food delivered and this was not the place. The delivery time was good, they got here in about 30 minutes, but it went down hill from there. We ordered for a family of 5 and it was about $70 (including tip). Everything we had was border line uneatable. The white rice was fine, but seriously, you can't screw up white rice.  The chicken was horrible, the mushu Pork (one of the favorite meals) was horrid and only came with 4 pancakes. Even the hot & sour soup was just huge chunks of tofu in some horrible broth. After the chicken and pork being so bad, figured I'd try the Mongolian beef. It was not good."}
{"text":"Pretty decent Chinese food- and they deliver! Perfect for those nights when only an egg roll will do, but you refuse to leave your house to get it!  I find them to be a tad overpriced though. I mean, this aint no fancy Chinese joint, yet they charge up to $15 for some dishes.  I think you can get mongolian beef cheaper at PF Chang's even.  Come on now Yunan, don't you think $15 is a little steep?  They do have good lunch specials though.  They give you a choice of about 12 dishes, beef, chicken and shrimp (no veggie dishes tho) and they come with an egg roll, fried rice and a crab puff I believe- all for $6.50.    I really like their mu shu vegetable crepe- they're pretty tasty. But if you're not looking to spend a lot, stick to their lunch specials and you'll be just fine."}
{"text":"I used to live on this side of town and this place was one of only 2 or 3 that delivered in the area. It was some of the worst chinese food ever. I wouldn't even call it chinese food. Some fond memories I have of this place, are waiting for an hour or more for our food to arrive, once almost two hours. I remember once opening the packaging and where we had ordered fried wontons were not fried wontons, but what was apparently tortilla chips. I remember once I took a bite of some chicken and mushroom dish, can't remember what it was called- and tasting dirt- literally, it tasted like dirt. As if whatever type of mushroom they used they had not even bothered to wash the dirt off of before making the food, and like there was grains of dirt or sand mixed in with the food. Some of the most bland, gross food ever. Seriously I would not have been surprised to have learned of health code violations at this place. I've never been inside of it, only driven paast, and the only reason I ever tried it was again because they were the only ones who delivered to my area around there. After ordering twice, I never ordered again. I've posted multiple reviews about how bad the food is and encouraged nobody to eat or order food here, but they are removed consistently, so I think the only way this place stays in business is by paying yelp to remove them."}
{"text":"[UPDATE July 2014] Please ignore everything below this update. I left my original review that I posted despite the fact that Yunan Wok had otherwise dismal reviews. I have left it in place to show you and the owners that a \"good\" review is not cast in gold and permanent forever. I've taken my review down from 4-stars to 0-stars (ok, one-star because you can't rate any lower). My experience with takeout tonight was a nightmare. Delivery was late, the order was wrong, it was delivered by someone I would be scared to open the door for at high noon let alone late at night. The \"food\" was crap and mostly rice. Everything I liked about Yunan Wok was gone. The bill was outrageous and NOT ITEMIZED, so the only thing you see is the bottom line. It was at least twice the price we have ever paid for a similar order and the amount of real food (other than rice) was about $1.00's worth. And what should taste hot and spicy tasted like the Chinese stuff you get in a can at the supermarket. Too bad Yunan Wok, you are screwing yourself and lost a long time customer. No one likes your food and no one will put up with being charged your ridiculous prices.  [Do NOT judge this place by the obsolete review below, it was just left there to show you how far down hill a place can go. Yunan Wok: NOT RECOMMENDED!!!]  Yunan Wok is not a \"gourmet\" Chinese dining restaurant, in fact it is barely a restaurant at all, the bulk of their business is delivery and take-out.  To eat in would probably not be much of a treat (although it is extremely authentic to restaurants I dined at in China).  We discovered it about 5 years ago and have had regular deliveries an average of once a month and it has always been decent value for the price ... very friendly service, prompt delivery, food delivered hot, etc.  Sometimes the containers were not as strong as they could have been and have leaked in transit.  Fast forward to February 2012.  What a difference!  The prices have gone up very slightly on some of the menu items (about 50 cents) but the quality has gone through the roof.  The hot and sour soup, which was always good, could be a meal by itself. It rates as one of the best I've had (and I've had it in hundreds of places).  The potstickers were greatly improved as well, plump, tasty and perfectly cooked.  The third item was sweet and sour chicken, a menu item that I try to avoid because most restaurants use fatty chicken, too much veggies and a sauce that's far sweeter than sour.  This, like everything we ordered last night, was an entirely new recipe.  The rice was improved, now being a blend of white and saffron rice, the veggies were crisp and tasty, there was far more lean, white-meat chicken and the sauce was excellent.  And ... for those who had issues with the delivery containers ... they are all of a new design.  The soup container is squat cardboard rather than tall foam, it's heavier duty, and now has a secure lid.  The entre container is plastic rather than foam, and also has a secure clear lid.  Kudos to Yunan Wok for listening!  I have not talked to anyone at the restaurant yet but it is obvious that they must either have new owners, a new (and very talented) chef, or that they just sat down one day and decided to make a full-on change to everything.  Given the choice I will pick a mom & pop single location restaurant over a chain any time.  We have to realize that such small restaurants won't have the consistency of a big chain and there may be nights when they miss the mark.  Since I am still going to Yunan Wok after 5 years I can't agree with some of the negative reviews here.  Small Chinese restaurants may offer tastes and flavors that are unfamiliar to those whose primary experience with Chinese food is large chain \"concept\" restaurants. At least give them another try before saying they are terrible.  It also seems unfair to compare a tiny mom & pop to PF Chang's ... they are simply not in the same business.  One final thought on the subject of Yunan Wok not having beef chop suey ... virtually all small Chinese restaurants serve regional foods from their local province.  Chop suey has been Americanized to the point that it's the first thing some people think of when they think of canned Chinese food on the grocery shelf.  Rather than criticize one place that doesn't serve it, when the urge for chop suey hits, there are probably a dozen other places nearby to find it."}
{"text":"Took an hour and 30+ minutes when quoted 50 minutes. Charged two credit cards. Soggy spring rolls. Crab in the cheese puffs when specifically asked if there were just cheese ones (food allergy) when we called the 2nd time they quoted us 10 minutes when it took 30... Very frustrating with very mediocre food"}
{"text":"Good thing they deliver because this is the only reason we have ordered from them. We had pork eggrolls that lacked flavor and was kind of mushy on texture. Chicken lomein was not at all good. The lemon chicken had a chemically taste. The fried rice wasn't horrible, but not that great."}
{"text":"Literally the worst Chinese food I have ever eaten  ! THE WORST.  Worse than day old Chinese grocery store buffet.  DRY RICE.  Sesame chicken pieces that we the size of large raisins.  Absolutely positive terrible. I would give zero stars if that was an option."}
