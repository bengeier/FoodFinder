{"text":"If you haven't been here you MUST try.  This place has the best appetizers and happy hour specials I have found in Pittsburgh.  The beans and greens with shrimp or sausage are to die for and also the mussels are OMG! Beyond delicious and a great deal."}
{"text":"Couldn't of had a better meal.  So good in fact I have been back 4 more times, each as good or better than the last.  My wife and I have brought my parents, our neighbors, as well as my sister and her husband, and sister-in-law and her husband.  Everybody loved the food and the atmosphere.  I have tried a different dish each time I have went, and like I said I couldn't have asked for a better meal.  From the seafood to the pasta, and to the steaks, everything has been phenomenal.  I love blue cheese mussels, by the way.   Service was great at the bar and at the table, we even got the chance to meet the chef and owner, who also offered some suggestions on different bars and lounges around town to have a couple birthday drinks for my sister.  Oh and the tiramisu and rum cake were awesome as well.  For the quality of food and service the price is spot on, I plan on going back as often as possible."}
{"text":"Perhaps they are still working out the kinks, the place has potential.  

For dinner we ordered mussels, two pasta dishes and a bottle of wine for $100.  Overall the food was good, nothing spectacular.  We went on a Friday evening and with a full house, the place was pretty noisy such that my fiance felt like he was shouting at me.  We are really excited to have them in the neighborhood and hope they get everything worked out soon.

So first, our orders were messed up, we got the wrong mussels (Horseradish instead of bacon blue cheese) and as it turns out, the Horseradish mussels were not good. I'm known to protect mussel broth from being cleared until every last bit is sopped up into crusty french bread, and this recipe allowed the bread to stay put in the basket.  When we asked about it because we tasted no bacon, the waiter said, \"oh yes, that's right you did order the bacon ones.  Do you want that taken off your bill?\"  Awkward....

Second,   we ordered pasta dishes and the waiter made a point of recommending linguine, which was fine because pasta shapes weren't listed on the menu and we never would have thought of requesting a particular one.  What made this strange was that when we asked him about it when both our dishes came out wrong, he told us the kitchen was serving whatever pasta they could put out quickest and was that okay with us.  Oh, you linguine tease, you!

So, to wrap up, nothing that can't be fixed and the place will be a great addition to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Wonderful Italian food, great steaks and my favorite stuffed banana peppers......young chef formerly of  Sarafino's restaurant, opening his own place in Lawrenceville. Prices are reasonable and they have a good selection of wine and beer, full service bar. My husband and I anxiously awaited Matt's new restaurant as we loved his dishes, and it did not disappoint. The restaurant is classy and very well done, the staff very attentive. My husband is very fussy about his steak and he said it melted in his mouth.....we will make the trip across town to Matteo's. It is a bit hard to spot on Butler Street- 3600 block, across from an old school, in the middle of the block. Parking was not too hard, just keep your eyes open after you start up Butler Street coming from downtown..."}
{"text":"I live in Chicago, which many consider a foodie destination. I grew up around Pittsburgh, and much of my family lives there, so when I planned a visit for the end of April, I reserved Saturday night for dinner with my cousins. Matteo's is a neighborhood spot for one of the ladies, so we met there around 8:15 p.m. 

The space is cozy, and the large doors were open for the warm night, which gave us a nice al fresco experience. In Chi-town, people will eat in the middle of a freeway just to dine outside, so Butler Street (with its Art After Dark crowds) was a total upgrade.

The noise was noticeable when we first sat down, but it was a packed house, after all. Our server told us noise absorbing panels had already been ordered for installation so I don't expect this challenge to continue.

The wine list is great, with good variety and price points. One of my dining companions is dairy free and our server went to great lengths to ensure her entree of choice would meet her needs. I ordered an appetizer as an entree and he brought it out alongside my cousin's meals. You would be surprised how many servers screw that up. Our service was impeccable. My \"beans 'n' greens\" was literally the best I have ever had. Portions are generous which means another delicious meal tomorrow. Who's complaining?! 

I will be adding Matteo's to my list of Pittsburgh must-haves. Matteo's is in good company with La Tavola, the Shiloh Grill, and Primanti's. 

Buona Fortuna, Matteo's!"}
{"text":"Go!! You wont be disappointed.  You must try the beans and greens and the bruschetta.   AMAZING!  The atmosphere is casual yet classy.  My husband and I have gone twice now and both experiences were great.  He is hooked on the White Scoglio pasta.  The first time we went, I tried the crab cakes, which were delicious!  Tonight I had the special which was salmon with a lemon dill sauce.  It was also fabulous!  This restaurant is a perfect addition to Lawrenceville.  It is our new favorite!"}
{"text":"Go hungry! Everything was fantastic. From the bread and dipping oil to the 1/2 off appetizers at happy hour. The grapefruit basil drink is awesome also. My main course was shrimp Alfredo. Yum, can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"A fantastic new restaurant. We love it! Mussels and Black and Blue Steak are fabulous!!!"}
{"text":"On rare occasions when eating out, I'll try something and be surprised...The beans and greens are incredibly fresh and VERY good; surprisingly so. This is a nice place, good atmosphere and the food was delicious, definitely could tell that they go the extra mile to make sure everything is fresh, proper temperature, etc."}
{"text":"We had dinner twice and the Chicken Romano was excellent.  So good, I had it the second visit.  The rice and veggies that accompany the chicken were just as good.  Our group of four shared mussels and the greens and beans and both were outstanding. Love it!"}
{"text":"Went to Matteo's on Saturday night (Memorial Day weekend) and it was quite pleasant! It wasn't crowded at all, in fact, we were one of 2 tables so it was nice to not feel packed in since the place is small! The food was excellent. the waitress was nice. Based on reviews, I was skeptical but overall my experience was good. I would recommend it!"}
{"text":"Awesome Italian food.  The chef was previously at Serafina's in Crafton - so if you liked that food - you will LOVE this place.  I try something different every time I go and have enjoyed all of it.  The grilled chicken salad, crabcake sandwich, pizza, and sausage lasagna (it was a special) are some of my many favorites!!!!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place.  I love Lawrenceville, and my uncle used to work in the building before they opened Matteo's.  Unfortunately, my husband and I probably will not dine here again.

We made a reservation for a Saturday evening.  When we arrived, there was no hostess stand next to the door.  We thought that was odd, so we checked in with the bartender.  We then realized the hostess stand was a tiny stand in the middle of the restaurant, with no one standing there.  I didn't want to stand there waiting for someone right next to other diners at their tables. We got a drink at the bar (which took about 20 minutes), and then sat at our table after we flagged a hostess down. The whole process seemed disorganized, and the bartender made it clear that there was no front of the house management because the chef is the owner.  Huh?   

I ordered the anti pasta salad for an appetizer and it was good. We both ordered pasta, and they were both just ok. Not worth the price paid.  The waitress was sub par.  I also thought the menu was typical and didn't offer anything unique. 

The restaurant itself is attractive.  However, I highly doubt I will return."}
{"text":"I really like the atmosphere here and thought the service was very pleasant.  However, my meal was tasteless.  I ordered the chicken parm which looked absolutely wonderful, but it was so bland and disppointing.  It honestly tasted like...nothing.  Nothing!  For the price of the meal, I would expect a little more.  My recommendation is to skip this place all together."}
{"text":"Had the pleasure of dining at Matteo's for a private event. Atmosphere was cozy and inviting. The apps were wonderful. Beans and greens as well as the salads were full of flavor! However. My main course.... Was to die for! The pumpkin tortellini. Let me just say I have never had anything like it! We ended the evening with delicious Pettit fours. After meeting the chef and enjoying his wonderful creations this place instantly became a favorite!"}
{"text":"I've never been to Matteo's because I called about 18 times this week (during business hours / after 4pm) trying to get a reservation for Saturday and no one has ever answered the phone.  I've left messages and sent an email through their website and still no response... How do they expect to do well if they don't answer their phone?  Are they possibly on vacation or closed?!  Ridiculous."}
{"text":"Went on a Thursday night during Restaurant week. I was with a table of 8. Each of us got the 3 course special menu for Restaurant week. For a Thursday night the place was rather full. Our sever was very nice. 

I had a couple of problems with my experience there. First was the lack of quality control. My first course was mussels with chorizo sausage. The flavors were great, but they somehow shattered a mussel in the bowl.  That meant I had little pieces of shell all throughout the dish that I had to find and discard or else is chip a tooth.  

My wife's first course was calamari in a sweet chili sauce. Another person at the table got the same dish. One had the right amount of sauce, the other one was swimming in it.

My second issue was how boring the food was past the first course. 

The salad course was okay but uninspired. 

The mains were disappointing. I got lamb ragu, which on the menu sounded fabulous, but the description was misleading. What came out was ground lamb in tomato sauce. The dish didn't take advantage of the lamb, and could have been any protein. 

Overall the food was not great, and the quality control was lacking. For what you pay to sit down there, you're better off going down the street to Piccolo Forno."}
{"text":"We had to wait for a table so we decided to have drinks at the bar. The bartender seemed annoyed that we were sitting there drinking. When we got our table the waitress didn't seem to know anything about the menu or the specials. When she was taking our order she kept having to go back and ask the chef what they still had and what things were. She didn't even seem to know what some of the different types of pasta were. Got the bruschetta which was really good. The fried calamari appetizer was very disappointing. It had no flavor. I actually asked the waitress for some balsamic and parm to pour on it which helped a little with flavor. The chicken parm was a big portion and I enjoyed it. The service was okay. The waitress was nice. The restaurant itself is nice. About 10 tables with a small bar. The one big problem is it is so loud. The restaurant was full, but I couldn't hear anything the waitress was saying. I could barely hear what the people I was eating with were saying. I know this place is new so it is still getting everything together. I would rather go down the street and eat at Piccolo Forno especially because it would be a little cheaper and taste a lot better. For the amount of money I spent and the amount of time I was there it wasn't worth it."}
{"text":"After hearing rave reviews from a number of friends about Matteo's I was very excited to go this past Saturday on a date night with my girlfriend to experience the menu that was put together for Restaurant Week. Instead sharing yet another wonderful experience in Pittsburgh's burgeoning culinary scene we left the Lawrenceville eatery with an experience that left much to be desired. 

The food was very good witha few outliers. I started with the Greens and Beans(fantastic), had the Salmon Special(delicious), and finished with the Toasted Almond Torte(solid). My girlfriend ordered an arugula salad with pears, the Lamb Ragu (very good yet lacked Parmesan cheese) and finished with the cheese plate. Our two critiques of the food include that the pears were far from special and frankly tasteless with the salad. The cheese plate (which was a dessert option) features cheese that were anything but dessert. Brie was the only of the three cheeses I'd expect to be served with fruit while the others were better served before an entree.

The service however, was deplorable. Our waiter was awkward, inconsiderate and frankly, not the brightest crayon in the box. My girlfriend ordered the wine pairing to accompany her meal and twice she had to send a glass back because our esteemed helper brought the wrong item. It was almost if he just poured a glass thinking we were too incompetent to know what we ordered. It was insulting. Oh yea, it took 45 minutes to get our first glasses of wine, appetizers and bread to share. This all with zero explanation. Luckily, our service was no where near the disaster that the table next to us went through. I'm not sure one of the patrons ever received the Veal Marsala and wine pairing he ordered. 

As we concluded our meal we were told that restaurant week has thrown off the entire meal experience and we should \"come back when it's not Restaurant Week.\" If participating is such an issue, then my advice to the restaurant is to just sit out the next time until a winning formula is produced and can be executed. 

By the end of the date, after the shoddy service and meltdown that seemed to be going on in the kitchen and among the wait staff, I half expected the folks from Candid Camera to pop out from behind the bar saying we had been spoofed.

Whether or not we return is to be determined."}
{"text":"I had been to Matteo's before and had no complaints, however my last trip was a disappointment. The waitress, Kelly, was incredibly rude and condescending. She made disparaging facial expressions at both wait staff and guests. When asked for bread, she sharply stated that it was in the oven. She didn't even refresh our waters for the first time until she brought us our check. 

The experience was a complete letdown. I'll be sure to ask for another waiter or waitress if there is a visit to Matteo's. For the restaurant's sake, I hope that Kelly changes her attitude.

{"text":"The WORST RESTAURANT EXPERIENCE EVER!!!! My wife and I had dinner reservations at Matteo's on Saturday, March 25th at 7:30 PM. We arrived at 7:10 and stood inside the door for 5 minutes before someone acknowledged our presence. We were eventually seated at a small table for two in the far rear of the restaurant. After 10 minutes had passed, a young woman bussing tables stopped at a our table and advised us that our waitress would be with us shortly. Finally, after 10 more minutes, a waitress arrived, handed us menus, and asked us if we'd like a drink. We ordered drinks ...And waited....10 more minutes and our drinks arrived.  We placed our dinner orders and our waitress asked if we would like bread. We replied that we would. Shortly thereafter our waitress arrived with dipping oil but NO bread... The bread arrived 10 minutes later!!! Our salads followed 10 minutes later....And the wait was on!!!! We never saw OUR waitress again!!! At 8:50 PM we interrupted another waitress happening past our table and asked if she could check on our meals. She proceeded to tell us that they couldn't seem to FIND our waitress, who mysteriously disappeared. She asked us what we had ordered as it was NOT placed into the computer system. As it was now approaching 9:00 PM, and we had a 70 minute ride home, we advised the waitress that we were leaving!!! She proceeded? to apologize profusely, told us that they would make up for the fiasco,  she asked me to leave my name and cellphone number and assured me that the owner would call me...Etc...WELL,  I got NO call by Wednesday?, March 29, so \"I\" called Matteo's on Wednesday afternoon and spoke with one of the chefs.  I explained the situation, of which HE WAS AWARE!!!! He too assured me that the owner, Mr. Cavanaugh, would call me the next day, as he was not in. I AM STILL WAITING FOR YOUR CALL MR. CAVANAUGH!!!  I am surprised that being in a highly competitive Pittsburgh restaurant market that you have the audacity to treat a first time patron as you have chosen to treat my wife and I. Shame on YOU sir! If you keep this up, I'm sure you'll be back where you began your restaurant career.... BUSSING TABLES AND WASHING DISHES!!!!"}
{"text":"So I've actually never taken the time to review anything on yelp but feel the urge to do so deeply tonight. 

We had reservations for 7 for an engagement party's the waitress didn't even ask our drink orders til 730. She didn't ask for our food order until 8. One hour of our lives down the tubes. While waiting for our food we ordered another round of drinks (mostly beer) which didn't arrive until 830. Keep in mind the average ratio of customers to waiters was 2 customers per waiter so not over busy. We are currently sitting in the restaurant and didn't get our VERY average food until 9:10.

THENNNN the owner was bar tending....one of the customers with our party ordered a drink which tasted like straight sugar syrup. When she asked to have it swapped out, the owner goes \"what's wrong now???\" So she just skipped getting a new drink and just wasted $10. 

NEVER AGAIN."}
{"text":"Amazing food and a great atmosphere. It tasted like real Italian food. The grilled calamari was perfectly cooked, and the appetizers were all very well done.

Oh, and their dipping sauce for the bread is amazing. Definitely recommended!"}
{"text":"The only thing that we were served well and on time was disappointment. Food was 3/5, service was poor, drinks came in late... it was a mess. It is also rather expensive. There are many restaurants in the area that are much better, would recommend looking at other options!"}
{"text":"We stopped in for bloody mary's this afternoon, which were great and ended up sharing a margarita pizza that had a nice thin crust, good cheese consistency, and was very tasty."}
{"text":"Decided to try Matteo's after work today. It was a mistake. There was a birthday gathering going on near the bar area and it was so loud in there you couldn't hear yourself think. Since we were hungry we stayed even after seeing many people leave because of the noise. We were unable to carry on any conversation during dinner at all. As far as the food goes...another mistake. I ordered the mushroom ravioli and they were almost too spicy to eat. Didn't think mushroom ravioli would be spicy at all. My husbands dinner was just okay. A bit to spicy for his taste as well. No apologies from anyone on staff. I don't think I will go back here."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant as part of a Hoover Dam tour package. The tour company dropped us off at this place to have lunch. I chose this place because I got a coupon for a free lunch from the tour company, so I thought, why not?

Big mistake.

When I got seated, I was one of three groups eating there. The restaurant was practically empty. I ordered my cheeseburger and fries with a Coke. Minutes later, another tour group started pouring into the restaurant and the servers took their orders as well. I was unpleasantly surprised to see that the group who ordered later actually got their food FIRST, and here I was being one of the first to order and still with no food.

Several minutes later (after the group who got their order first finally left), I FINALLY got my food. Turns out that the tour group who got their food first phoned their order in, which is why their food was served more quickly. Well damnit, had I known that, I would've phoned my order in too!

Nonetheless, I was first to order, so naturally I should get my food first, right? Not at this place. Needless to say, I truly got a free meal thanks to the coupon and by not leaving a tip on the table. (The first time I've never left a tip for my server.)"}
{"text":"I went here for restaurant week, and between a table of 4 people, we sampled everything on the restaurant week menu. (4 apps, 4 salads, and 4 entrees) Everything was a hit,  and they were generous with bringing out fresh, hot bread too. Our waiter was down to earth, yet still very knowledgeable.  And the best part was, despite being very busy, they had out table ready on time so we could sit down upon arrival.

Bottom line: Excellent food & helpful/friendly service. Definite recommendation!"}
{"text":"Probably the best place to go for happy hour food in Pittsburgh (half off of all appetizers). We ordered one of everything and we were really impressed with the quality (please don't be like every other restaurant in Pittsburgh and start slipping on quality!). The stuffed portobellos and mussels are especially good. We went back a second time and ordered takeout but they forgot to include an entree... We don't even care.. we will definitely go back again."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Italian restaurants! We went there Saturday night before Mother's day and sat outside. The beans and greens with shrimp was excellent., the seafood pizza was great and the mushroom ravioli on the specials list is to die for. So many mushrooms and lots of garlic. I hope they add this to their regular menu. The best part is that the portions are large and filling you can continue to enjoy your meal for a few more days because there will be plenty to bring home."}
{"text":"Went for dinner last night. Pretty good start - apps of bruschetta and beans and greens were excellent. The chicken BLT pasta dinner special was very good. Unfortunately, my husband's lamb ragu, while the taste was ok, he found a large metal shaving in his dish.  He informed our waitress who apologized for it but did not offer to do anything about it. We also noticed they didn't even discount the meal which doesn't seem like they really cared that much.  Water glass of friend we were with was cracked too.  Will, unfortunately, probably never go back - this behavior left a bad taste in our mouths."}
{"text":"have been here twice for lunch and could not be more pleased.  food is sensational.  service was friendly. love the decor and atmosphere."}
{"text":"I can't whole heartedly share the enthusiasm of my fellow yelpers for this place, and, once again, it's execution of the menu that fell a little flat for me. I arrived solo during happy hour, so made myself comfy at the bar and ordered an appetizer. A handful of the appetizers are half price during happy hour. I had the beans and greens, which is one of my favorite Italian dishes. They offer theirs with a choice of shrimp or sausage, and I opted for shrimp. This dish is large enough to eat as an entree or share with a friend. The white beans were good, and the onions nicely caramelized, but the shrimp were tough and overcooked, and had been so egregiously covered with black pepper that it was all I tasted. They use banana peppers in this dish, and these were spicy enough to be bothersome, as the heat overpowered the other flavors in the dish. Not great. Some elements of this dish were very tasty, and it wasn't a complete failure, hence the three stars. It could be much better with some simple tweaks and a more practiced hand.

A friend showed up while I was waiting for my food and bought me a glass of wine, which was nice. When I asked the bartender what they had for reds, she could only tell me varietals, and really had no idea what they were pouring. They push the specialties drink menu during happy hour, which is fine, but the staff here needs to study the wine list. Management, are you listening? Staff education time."}
{"text":"The company was stellar.  And after 2 hours and 15 minutes of 'meh' everything else, I was still smiling. So, kudos to my fellow diners!  In hindsight, I'm surprised we were only there for 2 hours and 15 minutes, because it felt much longer.  What's tough about the layout of Matteo's is that there is NOwhere to go if your table isn't ready. There's no real host stand to speak of; and the rest of the restaurant is full of tables and a lovely bar with little room for anything or anyone else. When the weather outside is frightful, as it was this evening, you're screwed and have to spend however many minutes dodging servers and other patrons as you wait.  But moving on.  

We were seated by a friendly hostess who opened with a list of accolades that Matteo's had recently received.  An odd opening, in my opinion, but after her illustrious description I figured we were in for a real treat.  A few minutes later our server arrived to take our drink orders.  A few more minutes later she arrived with waters.  A few more minutes later she returned with wine.  Lots of minutes involved here.  Then we ordered.  Our visit was during Restaurant Week, and I have taken that under careful consideration - I promise.  The 3-course menu looked delightful, and from it I selected Mussels Marinara, House Salad and Cod.  As we waited the restaurant filled quickly and the singular aisle became congested since there was simply nowhere to stand.  Some people left, some stayed.  That's neither here nor there.  

We remained focused on anxiously awaiting our bread which, arrived several minutes later.  It was clearly right out of the oven, so the wait for that was understandable.  Many, many minutes later we received our first course.  The mussels - straight outta the Morgantown river - if there is such a river.  I adore mussels and I'm used to their texture, taste, etc.  These were BAD.  So fishy due to the lack of quality sauce, which was a can of tomato paste/sauce/whatever, if I were to guess.  Another \"many minutes later\" we received our second course; a passable house salad. Nothing fancy; nothing bad - no complaints here.  Our third course arrived sometime after the place mostly cleared out and both myself and one of my companions who ordered the same dish (cod) found it inedible.  Such a shame to such a brave fish.  Those cod; they just have Long John Silver's written all over'em. But, when done right, they can be the king of fish.  Not this cod.  This cod obviously had a rough life sitting under a pound of the aforementioned \"sauce\" for much too long and arrived tableside as pure mush.  I'll be honest - I thought I might just suck it up and say nothing.  It was getting late and I just wasn't in the mood to explain or ask for something else.  But one of our other dinner companions encouraged us to express our displeasure and she was right to do so.  Granted, this meal was a cool 20 bucks - a STEAL for a night out - but I'm pretty sure we overpaid by about $19, and so something had to be said.  The server offered something in its place, but the entree portion of the Restaurant Week menu was limited (understandable) and the other two options didn't appeal to me.  So, I took one of them home for my lucky man, who I'm sure will be THRILLED to throw it down once he reads this review. Actually, I took a bite and it was the best thing I'd had all night.  

All things considered, I didn't feel much concern from the server about our collectively poor experience, but I was just happy to leave.  We were in such a rush to leave that I left my scarf and my friend left her phone. The server did walk the phone outside, which was a very nice thing to do.  Thank you.  In other news - there are far too many awesome place in L'Ville and beyond to waste my time returning to Matteo's."}
{"text":"Took me a looong time to try this place, I go past twice a day and finally tried it about 2 months ago when we could not get to another restaurant because of a road closure. We've been back twice since! So with 3 experiences I can say the service is excellent; the chef is accommodating to dietary needs and will modify dishes, then checks to make sure all is well.
The servers were excellent, drinks very good, and the portions are quite large. I am a big fan of the red sauce pasta dishes here, they taste fresh and are loaded with \"stuff\" - you know, large pieces of mushroom and onion, chunks of tomato, olives when needed, etc. A chunky great tasting sauce, with enough for lunch tomorrow too! My SO loves their seafood -  just tried their scoglio and loved it! The dinner salad is big also, and is loaded with lots more than lettuce!
I can't tell you about the desserts - other than they look great and people rave about them. One day...... I'm going to START with dessert. Doesn't everybody say that to themselves? 
Well, I know I will always be too full after dinner here to enjoy a dessert - so some day......."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped for lunch last Saturday, we were the only people in the whole place.  The waiter was so friendly. The bread and dip was amazing. We both ordered the chicken bacon sandwich with tortellini salad they was fantastic. The tortellini salad is such a nice change for a side option.  The lunch prices and sizes were perfect.  We felt perfectly full but not weighed down.  It would have been 5 stars if only they had a better outside area."}
{"text":"I agree with Chris F. Is there a way to give 0 stars or take away stars?! This place was terrible. Bad service, average food at best.  If your in the area dont go here, or if you did the package we did you will be disappointed if you go here! We will never ever go here again. The only tip that should be given at this establishment is how to provide better customer service!"}
{"text":"I really like this place - the 2 times ive been here it hasn't disappointed. There are very large portions so sharing with a loved one is definitely and option!"}
{"text":"My friends and I are sitting at the bar. I realise it is Saturday night, but we were pretty much ignored by Tony, who took his time taking our orders and brought our wine pairings before our food was brought out. We had to flag down another server to see if she could take our order. Then Tony finally took our orders, placed our bread next to the bar rag, and almost gave me a dirty plate."}
{"text":"A good friend suggested Matteo's so, we headed there on a recent weekend. As usual, hubs and I were a few minutes behind so our dinning companions went ahead and ordered an appetizer while they waited. When I arrived, I was very surprised by the decor- trendy yet classy. Modern and open. I loved it. There were very few tables and a decent sized bar in the very back. Seemed a bit odd to have to walk past all of the diners to get a drink at the bar. This type/size of restaurant seems more suited for BYOB, in my opinion. Now onto the food.

The greens and beans app arrived just as we joined the table. We gave it a try and were immediately impressed. As I enjoyed the complimentary flavors of the sausage, beans and spinach, I looked over the menu as well as the specials written on the chalk board at the back of the room. They had me at vodka sauce. Penne, vodka and prosciutto. I sipped on a glass of wine while anxiously waiting. 

If vodka sauce is on the menu, there's about 100% chance I will be trying it. That said, I've tried a number of vodka sauces all over the city. In all of my vodka experiences, I can confidently say this was one of my favorites. In addition to a bright, tangy and well balanced sauce, there were large chunks of prosciutto. It wasn't topped with small slices (or as I say, flakes) of prosciutto. No, no. There were thick, chunks mixed throughout. However, I still craved more meaty goodness so, I asked for a side of sausage. A few minutes later I was presented with sliced sausage on a bed of greens. The sausage seemed a bit spicier than what was in the greens and beans app but, ultimately very delicious.

Overall, my experience at Matteo's was phenomenal . . . so far. Then it came time for the check. We asked for separate checks by couple (2 couples). There were a couple issues with the checks and it ended up taking us over half an hour to pay! Services had been a little slow all night but this was ridiculous. However, the food will definitely bring me back for round two. Hopefully the service improves before then."}
{"text":"I went here with a large group of friends and I have to say that the service was the worst experience I've had! The server was extremely rude to our party, impatient, and unprofessional. We laughed about it, of course, but shared it with the manager because otherwise we enjoyed the food. Because of this, it's unlikely that I'll visit the restaurant again. Hopefully their service has improved so they do well!"}
{"text":"We were here on a quiet Wednesday, but Kelly made us feel at home, with all the attention she paid to us. The kitchen is top-notch, with everything of uniformly excellent quality, and surprising quantity! The stuffed shrimp and the chicken Diavola were the mains tonight, and filled us to the breaking point. An excellent choice for  home-style Italian in a neighbourhood atmosphere."}
{"text":"It's a great place to relax and enjoy a wonderful meal. You must try the mussels and beans and greens. Great service and Chef Matt always makes his way out to say hello."}
{"text":"Really bummed.  

I love Lawrenceville for it's up and coming restaurant variety however Matteo's did not deliver on that promise.  It will be hard to go back with Piccolo Forno and Cure right down the street.  The location is prime however Matteo needs to add some special touch to his restaurant and menu that will keep the people coming back.  

First, the menu.  It is hard to read and understand, not to mention not very impressive.  It is broken down into appetizers, pasta and meats.  The pasta choices are not even on the menu and they do not offer a whole wheat variety.  Warning - if you are looking for someplace healthy to eat, it is not here.  Very comfort food related.  

We started with the grilled polenta in a creme sauce which was delicious.  We then each ordered one pasta dish and meat dish to split.  We ordered the linguine with white clam sauce and the veal saltimbocca.  The linguine was much better than the veal.  

Granted this place has only been open for a month but I would really like to see an improvement made by the staff to make this place more marketable."}
{"text":"I went to Matteo's during restaurant week this year and had a great time!

We ate on a Thursday night and there was a good crowd. We made a reservation a couple days in advance since it was restaurant week- not sure if it is normally this crowded. I would definitely call ahead during the week and make a reservation for weekends.

We ate of the RW menu. We made the mistake of looking at the regular menu-everything sounded so good! We split a margarita pizza. For 2 people it is a good appetizer size. It is thin and crispy!!

For my first course, I had the greens and beans with sausage. The sauce it was sauteed in was delicious. Everything melted in my mouth.

I order the orange bourbon glazed salmon and my boyfriend had the lamb ragu. They were both very tasty and just as delicious the next day! Between the pizza, bread, and first course, we had little room left for our meal and dessert (We knew we were gonna be full with the amount of food we ordered).

I highly recommend the almond torte for dessert! 

The entire staff was super friendly! If our waiter was busy, another one would gladly refill our drinks. The atmosphere is very cozy and lovely decor. We are looking forward to going back and trying more of the menu!"}
{"text":"Thanks for pointing out the age of those reviews Christine H! That place has been a hidden gem for quite some time now. My favorite is breakfast, but they have a great lunch menu too. Classy historic hotel, upscale atmosphere (They even have cloth napkins!) and great food for a reasonable price. Definitely a locals favorite!"}
{"text":"Deplorable service and a 50/50 food experience make this a one star for me.  Our party of 4 went for Restaurant Week on a Thursday night.  I get that restaurant week is a busy time, but it's not like they haven't done this several times before, so I am not sure why they weren't staffed appropriately for it, but they definitely weren't.   And the staff they did have was not up to the task.

For starters, let me say that we were there for 2.5 hours for a 3 course weeknight prix fix meal.  That's just plain ridiculous, especially given that we ordered our whole meal less than 5 minutes after sitting down.  And even more ridiculous because we all ordered from the prix fix menu, something that is typically designed to turn over tables.  I'm not saying I like to be rushed; but in the first hour, the only thing we ate was some bread, an appetizer, and a thimble of wine.   

And let's talk about that thimble of wine.  Two of us opted for the wine pairings after being told that you select three \"glasses\" from the menu - one for each course.  She neglected to mention that these were sample glasses - maybe a 2 ounce pour each.   I attempted to order an additional full glass of my first sample since I finished it before getting to the appetizer, but she didn't get it and just brought me my second sample (which I also finished before getting the appetizer).  These samples and our other bar drinks took 20+ minutes each to get without exception.  Seriously, every single drink we ordered took 20 minutes or more and we had empty drinks and water glasses for more time than we had drinks.  And to top it off, the \"pairings\" weren't actually paired with anything because we had to ask repeatedly to have wine and food on the table at the same time.  We'd probably have had three bottles over 2.5 hours; but instead, we each had the equivalent of one glass of wine.  

Next comes the food.  The bread starter was good, but wasn't served with nearly enough dipping oil.  Two pieces of the bread made quick work of the little oil dish and we were left with dry bread after that.  The appetizer course was also actually pretty good.  The summer berry salads were packed with fresh berries and the beans and greens were huge and flavorful - could easily have been a meal.  In retrospect, we probably should have stopped there.   For the entrée, I had pasta with vodka sauce and chicken.  The portion was healthy and included quite a lot of a chicken breast that was so rubbery that I ate maybe four bites (testing to find a non-rubbery piece).  I pushed all of it off to the side and ate the pasta, which was decent.  Two orders of the cod with rice and spinach were overcooked and overall pretty bland.   A chicken and pepper pasta dish was the winner if you like spicy food.  Dessert took another 100 years to get.  You'd think it would have thawed a bit in that time, but each of our dishes (two lemoncello/mascarpone cakes and two cheesecakes) were partially frozen in the middle.  I will say that the lemoncello cake would have been very good if served slightly chilled.  

Throughout the entire meal, I couldn't help but wonder where the manager was in all of this.   Did he/she not notice the tables full of antsy people with empty drinks and dirty plates?  Every time I looked around, I saw all kinds of easy flags that a decent manager would respond to.  Nothing.  Did he/she not see the huge pile of uneaten chicken on my entrée plate that sat there forever after I finished it?  I clearly had eaten around that item, but our server nor a manager noticed or said anything.  Did he/she not notice that not one server in the entire place smiled or looked happy to be there in a full restaurant?  Lots of missed opportunities and service issues all around and I'm not sure anyone even noticed (except all the diners).  

My final comment also goes back to management and is a tough one for me because I hate to make comments about the way people look; but I have to say that our server didn't really look the part for the image the restaurant was trying to present.  I know not everyone can afford good dental care and I hate to sound snobby; but when I am out having a nice dinner, the last thing I want is a server whose teeth are literally rotting out of her mouth.  I feel for her, but you couldn't not notice it - she was missing several teeth and the ones that were left weren't in good shape.  If she'd been exceptional as a server, it might not have bothered me so; but she was oblivious instead of exceptional, so it just contributed to the overall poor experience."}
{"text":"Such a great spot in Lawrenceville. They have a great salad and bread for starters and their pasta portions are huge. Limited outdoor seating."}
{"text":"The food at Matteo's is wonderful - especially the pierogi appetizer. SO delicious! The drinks are also very good. If you want a great Italian meal with some extras you wouldn't expect to find at an Italian restaurant, you've got to try it!"}
{"text":"My partner and I were invited to dine with our friends at Matteo's, they eat here frequently. We sat at the bar, and we're very impressed with the unique and fun specialty drinks. The bartender was well versed and attentive. When we were ready to sit for dinner, we couldn't decide what to choose with the many and varied choices. Appetizers-mussels/excellent! Greens and beans/a must have! Crab ravioli/outstanding! Plenty of each to share with 4 people. Bread/warm and soft! House salad/large and very good. Each of us had different entree-Veal Marsala with linguini/large bowl of tender and tasty veal. Shrimp dinner/a must eat. Salmon-blacken (specialty) no comments from the eater, other than ahs and grunts of pleasure. Too full for desserts. It was crowded but I noticed the waiters kept the service orderly, and most of the people were return customers. We will definitely return and I will order the salmon, greens and beans and save room for the tiramisu..Matteo's is worth the visit!"}
{"text":"I'm a fan of nearly every restaurant in Lawrenceville. All I can say is: if you're going to open an Italian restaurant a few blocks from Piccolo Forno, it better be damn good. Sorry Matteo's, but you're not going to cut it.

My boyfriend and I wandered in on a Tuesday night a few weeks ago, after wanting to go to Smoke but realizing it was closed on Tuesdays. The restaurant was very empty, so we were promptly seated. The bread is delicious, I'll give them that. It's fresh from the oven and piping hot. I would've eaten more if I knew what was ahead! I then had some wedding soup. It was decent wedding soup - nothing to write home about, but still yummy. My boyfriend opted to go without an app.

For entrees, I had one of the specials that was a mushroom marsala pasta. My boyfriend opted for the vegetable primavera with aglio olio (they also offer an alfredo option for the primavera). Both dishes just entirely lacked seasoning. Is the chef on a no salt diet and wants the rest of us to suffer with him? I'm not sure, but the lack of seasoning was almost unbearable. I salted it myself, but there is a difference in taste between cooking the salt in the dish and dumping it on tableside. I took much of my dish to-go simply because I didn't enjoy it and knew my garbage disposal of a boyfriend (I say that with love) would take it for lunch the next day. He was pleased with the amount of veggies in his primavera, but again, no seasoning whatsoever made it incredibly bland and not an enjoyable dining experience at all. 

Matteo's has potential. It's decorated adorably, the location is great, and the menu is full of classics, which is common and often sought after at Italian restaurants. But I encourage the owners/managers to start tasting what is coming out of the kitchen. Bland food makes for a bad dining experience, and with an incredible Italian place up the street, you need to seriously up your game to get my business back."}
{"text":"The food was good but the service has a lot to be desired. First they squeezed 6 of us into a table only fit for 4 people.  There was no room to move or eat comfortably. It took an ungodly amount of time to get 3 drinks. One of our 6 dinners was misread in the kitchen and came out after the other five meals were brought out and already eaten. There were shells inside the mussels and one of us had to spit out the whole bite. The waitress tried hard but things were basically a disaster. Probably wouldn't go back anytime soon unless the service improves."}
{"text":"Matt Cavanaugh is an incredible chef. Hands down. He's innovative,  bold and fresh. Ingredients are traditional to creative Italian dishes that break out the difference between a good Italian restaurant vs a faux paus. 

Dining for groups or intimacy is good here. Outdoor dining weather approved.  

Specialities nightly and seasonally.  

Good wine list for all vino lovers. 

Wine tastings on Thursdays - check their website for details. 

There's no reason why anyone shouldn't pass up this restaurant for lunch or dinner. Price point is  reasonable."}
{"text":"My only real complaint was the rush-hour noise being let in, which spoiled the intimacy a bit. Other than that, I liked my Crab Campanelle. The Tripe With Toast Points was an interesting appetizer, something I'd never had before. The excellent sauce made it really good. The bread was wonderful as was the service. I don't remember having dessert. lol. I was too stuffed."}
{"text":"I feel like I just finished a food marathon but not in a good way but in the way where you want to curl up in bed and forget about the whole experience.  A few friends and I spent 2 1/2 hours mostly waiting for a 3-course Pittsburgh Restaurant Week meal.  People, this is one portion of the 3 part meal every 50 minutes.  It was excruciating to say the least and while in the beginning (oh the first 1 1/2 hours) we attributed the extended wait times to the crowd coming for Restaurant week there seemed to be bigger issues at play, like for example the actual taste of the food or the general demeanor of our waitress (I think she hated us).

It should not take so long to cook sub-par food and in a customer driven environment you probably should be somewhat apologetic about the extended wait time...or maybe even preface the meal by saying, \"we're really busy tonight due to Restaurant week, we appreciate your patience as we prepare and bring out the food\" or even a \"hey, your food's going to take a long ass time, hope you didn't come in hungry\"...I don't know just say SOMETHING, ignoring the issue doesn't make it go away.

I ordered the blackened tuna, caesar salad and porcini pasta off the Restaurant Week menu.  The only way to describe the blackened tuna was stiff...it didn't seemed overcooked but it was just like these crostini type pieces with little flavor...the gorgonzola cheese and sun-dried tomatoes helped but couldn't save this dish from itself.  I was ok with the caesar salad although my friends informed me that caesar salad shouldn't have tomatoes or olives both of which this salad had, including the token anchovy atop romaine lettuce.  The porcini pasta was decent...I wasn't blown away but felt that it could have used a little something something.  It had a creamy marsala sauce that was a bit sweet and tangy and the the pasta was cooked well as in al dente...it just wasn't doing anything for me.  But at this point in the meal (2 hours later) I'm not sure if there was any food dish that could've redeemed the whole experience.   

Why the generous 2 star rating you ask...I guess I'm hoping that the lackluster meal and service had more to do with Restaurant Week and that their regular menu on regular service days are much more pleasing."}
{"text":"Wow, I am glad I did not review Yelp before going to Matteos because I may not have gone. My first time I was taken by a friend years ago for my birthday. I my bruchetta and enjoyed my Bolognese to no end. I have continued to enjoy the food continually, desserts included. I highly recommend the chicken BLT. Some of the specials are to die for! From time to time, staff can be spacey, but I have run into that all along Butler Street. My husband just had the Tiramisu and it was excellent!"}
{"text":"I stopped by here this past Tuesday while on a food tour.  I have been by this place many times before and never really noticed it.  Blink and you are by it.  I would later find out from the owner Matt that the restaurant only opened in February of this year.  The inside of the restaurant probably seats about 40 people, has a chalkboard menu,  has a brick wall with exposed duct-work on one side and a nice bar on the other.

Matt started us all off with some bruschetta. The bread was topped with a layer of goat cheese and then covered with tomatoes and a balsamic reduction. It was good and I enjoyed the reduction with the slight tartness of the cheese.  Next up was a penne dish that I believe was penne alla vodka.  The sauce was a nice pinkish-orange color and creamy and then had what I believe was pancetta in it.  It was soo good that I could not stop eating it and kept on taking a few spoonfuls whenever I noticed that no one else was eating.  Finally the last dish that we were served here was a dish that had sausage, white beans and peppers.  It was also terrific as the sausage had a nice spice to it and also was moist and juicy.

The bottom line for me is that I will definitely be heading back here in the future.  I loved both the ambiance of the space as well as all of the food that was served to us.  Due to that I can't wait to go back in and order off the menu for myself."}
{"text":"I moved here from Chicago and - despite the copious persons of Italian descent here in the 'Burgh, I had always been disappointed in the Italian food (with the exception of Stagioni). 

Matteo's has changed this for me.

Sweet merciful crap. Everything about my experience here was lovely. The cocktail - the Cherry Lime Rickey - was sweet and tart and refreshing. My husband had the sangria (which he found enjoyable enough to have 2 glasses). The bread was crusty and soft and  - whoops, we ate the whole damn loaf. 

We started with the beans and greens with sausage. This appetizer is enormous - easily big enough for four people to share or to be someone's entree. We brought home the leftovers. 

I had the meatball stew and my husband had a (very large) salad. I was getting the feeling that I was going to be unable to eat a bite of my entree so I brought half of my soup home. It was savory and rich, with a lovely beefy flavor to the broth. 

The entrees arrived  - lamb ragu for my husband, BLT chicken pasta for me. My dish was bacon, chicken and spinach in a tomato cream sauce while my husband had a thick, tomato-based sauce made with lamb. Both were complex and delicious. Mine had a good smokiness from the bacon and the sauce was creamy without being heavy. The husband's was rich, but not in that 3-bites-and-I'm-done way. 

Fantastic server. Knowledgeable, pleasant, efficient.
Bartender seemed friendly from our brief interaction.
Lovely space.

Watch out, Piccolo Forno....there's a new(ish) kid on the block who is doing it better than you....."}
{"text":"Great spot for dinner.  Good wine and seafood.  Casual yet intimate.  Very nice."}
{"text":"Delicious!! Was really nervous to come here because of the hit or miss reviews but it was amazing! 
I came here for restaurant week, and made a reservation by phone. I ordered the beet salad. The combination of beet, nuts, greens, and cheese was great. I dislike when places give so much cheese. There were more nuts and beet, enough cheese to complement. Very delicious.
Then got the lamb ragú. Also delicious!!! The sauce was so tasty. The lamb in the sauce gives it a delicious savory flavor that I like better than a meat marinara sauce. Warm and delicious, they use Rosemary and parsley as the herbs. 
The chocolate fudge cake was so good too. It was so rich. It was very warm and came with fruit. 
Even the bread they serve before you get your food is so tasty. It is a warm soft loaf of bread, easy to tear with oil & tomato. 
Not to mention, the service was very good. This is an amazing Italian place with delicious food and good service !"}
{"text":"Excellent .  Don't let the negative reviews sway you. The food was great.  We had 3 delicious specials  and great service.  Go there, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Although I am giving Matteo's three stars, this was much more of a 2.5 star experience. After viewing the restaurant week menu, which on paper looked delicious, I decided to make reservations for this past Friday night for myself and my boyfriend. Our reservations were for 7:45 and we arrived on time to a packed dining room. In fact, our table was the only one open at that time. It took quite some time for someone to come up to the door to greet us, but once he did we were sat quickly. Our server, Erica, was excellent. She was one of the highlights of the entire dining experience. After explaining the restaurant week menu, she brought over bread and oil, both of which were tasty and much welcomed due to the fact both my dining companion and I were starving. My dining companion and I both chose to do the restaurant week menu with the $15 wine pairing with each course. 

For appetizers, I chose the chorizo mussels (chorizo sausage, fresh tomatoes, and Chablis) which was paired with Krems Gruner Veltiner. This was a drier white wine and really complimented the spicier flavor of the chorizo. The flavor of the dish was great, however, throughout the dish were broken shell pieces. It seemed with every bite of the sauce, I was biting into a broken shell and then having to pull pieces of it out of my mouth. This really ruined this dish for me and did not leave a good taste in my mouth, no pun intended. My boyfriend chose the grilled chili calamari (grilled and tossed in a sweet chili sauce) which was paired with Rothburg Riesling. My boyfriend said it best when he said this was the worst calamari he has eaten in his life. It was chewy, rubbery, and overlooked. The wine was sweet and would have complimented the sweet chili sauce if the calamari had been edible, which it really was not. 

Since the first course left much to be desired, expectations were low for the second course. My boyfriend chose the house salad (mixed greens, onion, cucumber, olives, pepperoncini, and tomato) paired with Blue Quail Chardonnay. There isn't much to say about his salad except it was a decent size and he enjoyed the balsamic dressing. I chose the beet salad ( beet, bacon, tomatoes, goat cheese, and romaine with balsamic reduction) paired with Dreambird Pinot Grigio. For my dining experience , this was the highlight of the meal (minus dessert which I'll get to later). The salad was large and filled with beets and bacon (because bacon makes everything better!) and I loved the reduction and how it complimented the goat cheese without being overwhelmingly vinegary. 

For entrees I was torn between ordering the lamb ragu or the Gorgonzola crusted tilapia. I saw the tilapia go out to another table and it looked delicious  and it was paired with a white wine which is my preference over red so I ended up going with the fish. When the entree arrived, the Gorgonzola was very dominant on one side of the fish and the other side had none at all and was very flavorless. It was served with asparagus (no seasoning at all) and paired with Chateau Lamothe, a drier white wine. The dish was huge and I ended up taking half home but I was pretty disappointed in the mostly flavorless meal. My boyfriend had the chicken piccata ( lemon, capers, white wine, mushrooms) which was served with a side of vodka pasta and paired with Tutela Pinot Grigio. His meal was very tasty, particularly the vodka pasta sauce. The lemon flavor was present throughout the dish and complimented the salty capers nicely. He really enjoyed his meal and dud not have any leftovers to take although portions were huge. 

The absolute highlight of the meal, which was not a restaurant week menu course, was the tiramisu. It was so tasty I did not want to share after my disappointing entree, but I still gave my boyfriend a few bites. 

Service was excellent from Erica. Our entrees took an excruciatingly long time and while waiting for them, she brought over complimentary wine (a chianti for him and a red cab for me) so we had something in front of us during the painstakingly long wait. That was such a nice touch that I'd be willing to return to Matteo's despite the mostly lackluster food. Great service can go a long way! Overall I will not be rushing to return and I'm thankful this meal was at a discounted price because it was a mostly disappointing experience, minus the beet salad, the tiramisu, and the excellent service."}
{"text":"I can't remember how or why Matteo's was on my Pittsburgh bucket list since Italian food is not a favorite of mine but I am determined to knock every item off. I had the opportunity to cross Matteo's off last week with a friend & her boyfriend. 

The three of us sat at the bar and the bartender was immediately responsive. Based on the food we ordered, the bartender paired the perfect wine. He also served fresh, warm bread with seasoned olive oil dipping sauce.

We started with the beans & greens- shrimp (can be ordered with spicy sausage instead!) spinach, cream sauce & white northern beans. The spinach was perfect, a hard task to accomplish. Usually, restaurants over cook it & it's mush. I would order this dish again. The shrimp were large & full of flavor from marinating in the cream sauce. 

Next up: house salad. Simple yet quality ingredients. Mixed greens (no cheap iceberg here) and cucumber, onion, tomato, olives, & balsamic dressing on the side. A bowl of blue cheese crumbles was also served on the side. 

Main dishes: we shared the black and blue salmon with roasted vegetables, barrel aged coffee crusted steak, and penne with bacon vodka sauce. The black and blue salmom was amazing. Delicate blue cheese melted on blackened salmon with roasted zucchini & squash. Roasted & crunchy, the way they should be! I am not a big pasta or red meat fan but I tasted both. The coffee crust was an excellent compliment to the steak. Not overpowering & ground enough that it wasn't grainy. No grounds in my teeth, bonus! The penne sauce was just the right amount of creamy and the bacon bits were plentiful. If my bank account let me, I'd go back every night for the salmon!

The chef dropped in to check on us a few times and I felt like he genuinely cared about each and every item his kitchen prepared. I watched him check in and interact with most of the patrons, too. I can't speak for the waitstaff since the bartender served our food.

Another great part of my experience was the portion sizes! I had leftovers for two days & yes, I did manage to save some salmon for the next day. 

Matteo's is now a permanent fixture on my foodie list & I will be back!"}
{"text":"First - Let's just clarify that my review is more of a 3.5 than a 4.  It wasn't bad.  Wasn't great.  It was just... dinner.

Another night out with our Foodie Crew, but with a 60+ minute wait on a WEDNESDAY at Piccolo Forno, we were too hungry to wait.  So we searched Yelp for other options.  Matteo's seemed like a good choice for Italian food within walking distance.

Walking in the place was ... strange.  The hostess station was in the middle of the room, between tables.  It made no sense.  No one was there to greet us.  We just kinda stood there.  The staff were too busy watching TV and talking to notice customers (they weren't busy with customers, obviously).  When we were sat, our waitress we over attentive.  You know, the kind that hands you the menu, walks away for a minute, and the returns to ask if you're ready?  It just wasn't as relaxing as we would have liked.  We felt rushed. 

For apps, we ordered Stuffed Portobello $14 - stuffed with crab and Gorgonzola.  Though tasty, for ONE Portobello mushroom cap, I felt this was a bit pricey... I guess the crab made it more expensive?  Our friends ordered the Bruschetta $9 which has a decent portion size and great flavor.  For apps, they won for price and portion.

Next were our salads.  HOLY PORTIONS!  I mean WOW!!  Our house and Caesar salads ($7) were HUGE!!  I think they need to reevaluate these.  Seriously...

Entrees were selected - I chose Chicken Parmesan $22 over penne which was HUGE.  I couldn't finish it.  I had 5 - not one, two, three, or even, four... FIVE PIECES OF CHICKEN on my plate.  Obviously I had leftovers.

BF chose Chicken Marsala $22 which was as hot as LAVA!  Actually kind of flavorless, as well.  Very underwhelming, but huge.

Veal Parmesan $22 was selected by Jake - aka Baby Cow Eater.  Poor Poor Baby Cow :(

And the final entree selection was Pumpkin Tortellini (evening special) which was surprisingly a normal portion size and looked quite tasty.

Though we didn't have much room left, our sweet tooth got the best of us.  We opted to split a Tiramisu and a Pumpkin Torte.  The tiramisu was okay.  The lady fingers needed to be soaked a bit more... it was a bit dry.  The torte was sweet, but not overly so.  It also needed moisture.

The bill was a bit more than I expected.  I honestly would rather them cut the portion size down and trim the tab a bit.  I mean... the ONLY items I can say were reasonably portioned were the appetizers.  Everything else was just a bit ridiculous.  

In the end, the food was okay.  Was it better than I can make at home (aka - does it warrant going out to dinner)?  Yes.  Would I return?  Probably not.  I just wasn't that impressed.  There was nothing to draw me in.  If it hadn't been for Piccolo Forno's 60+ minute wait, we probably would never ventured to Matteo's."}
{"text":"Given that Piccolo Forno is just down the street, I would expect better, much better.

The food is OK.  Huge portions that are reminiscent of Bravo.  Nothing particularly interesting that stood out aside from the greens & beans which I loved. 

The food and portions are OK enough that I would have returned if I was craving chain-like food not at a chain, had it not been for the service.  We had made reservations for 7 of us for a friends birthday.  A few major downfalls:

1. We brought a cake which the waitress just sat on a random chair when we told her at the beginning.  When it was time for us to sing, we removed it ourselves and had to track the waitress down to ask for plates and a knife to cut it.  They then charged us $10 for their \"service\".  Every other restaurant I have brought a cake to has immediately taken the cake to the kitchen to refrigerate it, brought it out with a candle on and cut/served the cake to us.  

2. They were out of Pinot Grigio by the bottle??  They offered zero alternative options and instead we had to all have individual glasses of pinot grigio... out of a bottle.  It was just confusing, like if you are out of your \"bottled option\" give us another \"bottled option\"!  There were seven of us ready to drink bottles upon bottles and instead we had to go by the glass.  It honestly seemed like they were scamming us.

3. Our waitress was nonexistent.  We waited over 20 minutes for her to take our orders, she rarely filled our water unless asked, and overall all was extremely rude.

4. The guest of honor's lovely boyfriend had called in advance to surprise her and us with 2 bottles of champagne.  They gave the bottles to another table and did nothing to rectify the situation."}
{"text":"Four of us went to Matteo's on a Saturday night and they squeezed us in- really over the top of them considering how packed it was. We really enjoyed our dinner- the wine and beer selections were perfect for the restaurant and the food was great.

Greens & beans were a must have.  I highly recommend trying them!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and great service! I recommend the greens and beans. We will definitely return."}
{"text":"The mussels were awesome! Seriously some of the best in the burgh. Perfectly spiced and tasted very fresh. Went out for happy hour and there was a beer tasting. They also had all of their drinks on special and they were giving away bruschetta and meatballs. I'll be back! Yum."}
{"text":"I have two words....
Piccolo Forno.... Just down the street.
They need to send their evening servers over to piccolo for lessons in service. Also, their wine list is horrible. Good luck."}
{"text":"The food was really good. The service did not meet my expectations. I made reservations for my husband and his family because they were in town visiting. It took a half an hour for our waiter to bring our initial drink order. He brought the entrees out one at a time with a 10 minute wait in between each entree. We gave him the benefit of the doubt because perhaps he was new and overwhelmed. I would give it a second chance because the other waitresses were able to help him out. I would try it again but the party I was with was unhappy."}
{"text":"I got to give it to you real for this one. We tried this place for Pittsburgh Restaurant Week and were highly disappointed.  The waitress seemed irritated that the restaurant was busy--weird since she works for tips.  Another table sent back a glass of wine that had lipstick on it.  Instead of getting a fresh glass, she dumped the wine into a water glass and used her shirt to wipe the glass off.  Then she return the wine back into the even dirtier glass--YUCK!!  Our food was cold and not very good, but we were afraid after seeing what happened with the wine to send anything back."}
{"text":"Went on an apparently quiet night (Wednesday) with my wife. She got the Cappelletti and thought it was delicious. I got the Paesana, and while it was good, it wasn't awesome. 

The prices are a bit high and the menu is underwhelming. Staff was friendly, but then again there wasn't really anyone there. Good to try, but the other Italian place down the road is more bang for your buck."}
{"text":"I went here on a Wednesday night last week during restaurant week. Although I was very appreciative that they were able to fit us in the day I made reservations, the upcoming experience was disappointing. My friend and I both weren't very excited about any of our courses.

For one, they took quite a bit of time to bring out the bread and the olive oil--at least this part was delicious, but it would be embarrassing if a restaurant messed up something so simple. For the appetizer, I got the grilled calamari with sweet chili sauce which was ok. The flavors went well together but I wasn't craving bite after bite of it. For the second course I got the beet salad which was probably the worst salad I've ever gotten in a restaurant. It was just romaine lettuce with tiny bits of beets smaller than dimes. Some tomatoes and cheese were thrown in an an effort to make it better, but wow--beet salad is usually primarily beets with some sort of legume, maybe onions, and cheese. The beets should be the star. The beets in this salad were essentially a garnish. The main course wasn't much better--garlic crusted tilapia served with asparagus. The tilapia was sort of soggy and you couldn't even taste the fish (or garlic for that matter) because all you could taste was the gorgonzola that they put on it. My friend got the same thing and didn't finish hers because she found it unappetizing.

I wish I could have had a better experience at Matteo's but it seems that their food does not measure up to the prices that they charge. Luckily, there are many other better restaurants on Butler to have dinner at."}
{"text":"I'm going to try and keep this review brief and to the point.

It seems like Friday night may have been a bad night for a few people based upon the reviews here, not just myself and company.

Rather than go into high-detail (as this has already been covered by a few other people and I agree 100%), I'll just start by saying the service was hands down the worst service at a restaurant that I have ever experienced. The server had zero personality, was snarky and seemed inconvenienced the entire time...not to mention, not a single person apologized for ANYTHING, even though we arrived at 8PM and left at almost 11PM. 

The saving grace for this place that night was that the food was actually phenomenal. It's a shame that the service (or lack thereof) overshadowed how delicious it was.

I understand it was Restaurant Week in Pittsburgh and all the tables were full...busy, no doubt. But, if you can't support having all of your seats filled at one time, with most people ordering off of a fixed menu, then some back of house changes need to be made.

For anyone who hasn't tried this place, I would not write it off because the food is spectacular. Maybe try it during the week when it's less busy. I'm undecided if I'll be back but it certainly will not be on a Friday or Saturday night"}
{"text":"We should have known that no wait at 8pm on Friday night in Lawrenceville was a clue.  Great location, nice causal atmosphere, good drink selection, and a fairy tale menu.  Yep, the descriptions on a the menu are more of a fairy tale than reality.  The bread, although \"fresh from the oven\" was warn, but certainly not fresh.  My wife had the special gnocchi that was doughy and unremarkable.  I opted for the seafood pizza, which according to the menu was \"garlic, extra virgin olive oil, scallops, shrimp, and jumbo lump crap meat.\"  I got a flat saltine-like crust, smothered in cheese, with small fishy tasting scallops and shrimp.  If there was crab there, it wasn't jumbo lump.  Not terrible, but not at all worth $16.  At some point, the food has to live up to the rest of the place to thrive."}
{"text":"This was our first time at Matteo's.  I started with the beet salad and was dismayed to find that they used canned beets in their salad.  Who does that?  

However, the pasta entrees were very good.  The portions were huge and the food was of good quality.  

We will be back, but I will stay far away from the horrible beet salad!"}
{"text":"So begins a tale of two Italian restaurants. One is rather new and exists in the vibrant East End. The other has been around for decades and serves the more modest and idle South Hills. Both are magnificent but mildly flawed, one more mildly than the other. Chronologically, Matteo's wins the coin flip and thus shall be addressed first. 

On a recent Friday night, Kay picked me up from work with hunger in her abdomen. She didn't not want to drive or walk far, leaving the Kaymobile in Rite-Aid's parking lot. I instantly remembered that a new Italian eatery had opened just blocks away, so after a lovely stroll down rush-hour distressed Butler Street, we found Matteo's, a restaurant that sans a \"t,\" shares its name with another, unrelated, far more subdued (and already reviewed 2-3 years back) Italian restaurant in my beloved former domain of Brookline. 

Matteo's wood-paneled floor, marble-countered bar, and brick-laden walls made us feel as we'd been invited to a lively dinner party in a pricey warehouse loft apartment. With the doors left wide open, all of the noise from Butler Street's traffic invaded the stylish space. Appreciatively, Matteo's food was superlative enough for us to endure the truck horns and blaring car stereos. 

A warm-up to our meal consisted of a comely rope of freshly toasted Breadworks bread that resembled a pretzel on the outside, yet recalled Porch's cottony Farm Bread on the inside. It was only when I asked our terrific (no 'kinks' for me to report), table crumb-employing (a very nice touch I'd never seen before in any area restaurant) server about its origins that I discovered the bread wasn't made in-house. I have my doubts (and foolishly forgot to ask) about my dessert, however, but that bridge will be crossed soon enough. 

Second in line was the Tripe with Toast Points. Not ever having had tripe before and having perused the menu online prior to our arrival, I became afflicted with tunnel vision in regards to ordering appetizers, finding glory in the slightly gummy but sausage-like offal and the snack's supplemental ruby-red sea of robust, dense, pleasingly unrefined marinara sauce that hovered near the top spot for the greatest I've ever sampled. The toast went well with everything (as did the remainder of our bread loaf), and had a properly poached egg been included, this dish would unapologetically destroy the entire Sunday breakfast menu of Beechview's Davio by itself (look up my scalding review for yourselves).

Next up was a generous version of the classic Caesar Salad made memorable by its crisp, fresh lettuce, an egregiously velvety dressing, sharp parmesan shards, and briny strips of anchovy. 

A Seafood Pizza, presented in sauceless \"white\" fashion, headlined my meal, and unlike the Post-Gazette's Melissa McCart, I found the generous amounts of shrimp and scallops anything but \"lackuster\" as she put it. In fact, the naked prawns and mollusks were not only prodigious in size, they were plump, succulent, and burst like micro-balloons of sea water when I bit into them. I do concur with her assessment of the achievement of textural excellence that was the highwire-balancing act of the crunchy/chewy crust, however. Overall, it served as an honorable, gourmet example of this kind of pie. 

Dessert was a cube of tiramisu that was nicely garnished with a fanned, perfectly ripened strawberry. As I alluded to earlier, I suspected this came in frozen from an outside vendor (I shoulda asked) and was subsequently thawed for my pleasure, and pleasurable enough it was despite its composition that approached the overly mushy, but still, it satisfied, the coffee dust making the creamed confection shine, albeit dimly. 

Coming in at around $80, I felt my wallet yelp (heh) a little as I paid our tab, the gentrification of Lawrenceville slapping me upside my bald head with the unsettling socioeconomic reality that old LoLans are indirectly becoming increasingly unwelcome in these parts. So yeah, I respect and resent Matteo's simultaneously, the 'Teo being too on-target when it comes to Italian fare for me to dismiss as merely another trendy, superficial yuppie haven in a neighborhood no bohemian would catch themselves in 25 years ago."}
{"text":"Mediocre food and difficult service.
My significant other and I went to dinner at Matteo's on the Friday of Halloween weekend. We came without reservation and we were promptly seated.
The first bottle of wine we ordered was unavailable. We thus placed an order for a second choice. Our waiter came back and told us that this option was also unavailable. We were offered a third choice not of our choosing for the same price as the second.
I had the mushroom ravioli which were decent. I did not feel like the sauce truly complimented the ravioli which left me a little unsatisfied. Thus I asked our waiter for some olive oil. After a few minutes, the waiter returned with what seemed to be canola oil, definitely not olive oil. Apart from the fact I do not understand how an Italian restaurant does not have olive oil in the kitchen but I especially did not appreciate being lied to. Last but not least, there was an extremely large and noisy party. I could barely hear my significant other who was sitting right in front of me. We felt a little disappointed that the management did not ask the party to slightly lower the volume as a courtesy to other guests.
I do not recommend this restaurant, especially when Piccolo Forno is few blocks away."}
{"text":"Please don't go here. Service and food were both bad. Completely overpriced.

The service was horrible, the waitress brought out people's multiple courses in such a way that one person from our party had to eat alone at the end of the meal. She was also condescending.

The restaurant advertised happy hour but we weren't informed until after ordering multiple drink and apps that only people sitting at the bar were 'eligible', felt like we were being tricked.

Finally, the food was not tasty or consistent. Two people at the table order beans and greens and it might as well been two different dishes. One under seasoned and bland, the other so spicy it was inedible."}
{"text":"I would agree with the other reviewers that they are still working out the kinks on the front of the house. The place is a little noisy, but I was sitting next to my wife and I felt like the noise loud enough that others couldn't hear our conversation but not so loud that we couldn't talk to each other. There is a daily menu on the back wall and it offered lots of choices besides what is on the printed menu. What I really liked was that each course came out after we were finished with the previous course. It gave us enough time to enjoy the meal.
But the important stuff is top notch. The food here is awesome. We started with BBQ Ribs and they had a nice char, sweet and spicy sauce and tons of meat. I used to go to La Cucina any time I was craving Vodka Rigatoni. This place is by far the best Vodka Rigatoni that I have ever tasted. The sauce is just a little bit spicy and it really separates this place from all others. The pancetta in the sauce was also nice and crispy even though it was soaked in vodka sauce. My wife had a daily special Cajun Crab Pasta which was also really good. I wish that I could say more about her dish, but I was too busy mopping up the vodka sauce with my bread. We will definitely be back. I might try something besides vodka rigatoni, but I doubt it. The vodka rigatoni is just that good.
I really hope this place stays around for a long time because the food is awesome, the prices are reasonable, the wine selection and prices are good. If you want a dinner spot with a menu that leans towards Italian but still offers some Steak, Asian or Cajun dishes, has a nice wine list, brings out the courses with enough time to enjoy each course and still lets you walk out the door with most of your money, this is the place is for you."}
{"text":"A lenten Friday with a lot of fish entrees on the chalk board.  

Four for dinner last night.  First time for the two of us as we joined another couple for their return trip.

First off, get the Greens and Beans with Shrimp.  One word - awesome.  The four of us shared the large bowl and I could have had another.

Four people - four different entrees:
Crab ravioli - served with several crab claws on top.
Mahi Mahi - jerk style
Red Snapper - lemon capers with asparagus and red potatoes
Crab stuffed Shrimp - with asparagus and red potatoes.

All us loved what we ordered.  We'd go again."}
{"text":"This was only so so, but for the price I was expecting amazing....

The good; drinks are delicious and the have great bread (always a plus).

We ordered the Brussels sprouts and to say they were over done is an understatement...burnt to a crisp, and blacked unrecognizable crisp. The entrees were all underwhelming (not well flavored and just blah)

Nothing was terrible, but I won't be back at those prices."}
{"text":"The food was great, Sat outside, sever was slow and forgetful"}
{"text":"Small cozy restaurant.  The bathroom floor was filthy when we were there but that was also after a snow/rain day. 

The food was tasty!  If you don't like garlic, you might want to tell the server.  The server was prompt in the beginning until the bar got busy then she barely came around, but she apologized, was nice and made good recommendations.

I had the scoglio with red sauce and penne (this is prob more like a linguine/spaghetti type sauce, but I just think penne was easier to eat).  sauce was delish and garlicky.  It was disappointing that for the price, they used mini scallops like the size of mini marshmallows, and it looked like someone tried to open the mussels that did not open themselves (meaning they are dead and should not be eaten).

My hubby had the lamb chops, and he loved them. It came with one side I think (he got asparagus).  He also got an extra side of penne in garlic oil because he felt like he needed the starch for the lamb chop's sauce.  It was swimming in sauce.  Lamb chops were cooked perfectly.

The highlight of my meal was the chocolate mousse cake.  Server said the chef's wife makes them (along with the rum cake abd tiramisu).  It was perfect consistency and sweetness (not too sweet).  The place is pricey,  but I would recommend it for date night.  My hubby's makers mark and diet coke were $10 ea, but that's up and coming Lawrenceville for ya.  Overall, would go back but not a weekly thing."}
{"text":"I was surprised to see that the other reviews for Matteo's are so low--and then I realized that they are 5+ years old and both based on the fact that a tour bus was served before the reviewers because the bus driver called their orders in ahead of time. I've never experienced anything like that, and the tour packages don't stop there anymore, so problem solved.  Now on to the food, service, etc...

I came here with my mom for breakfast on Sunday morning, and we had a lovely time.  There are a few tables on the front patio, and we snagged one, which offered a nice view of old town and the historic hotel where the restaurant is based.  My corned beef hash was delicious--definitely homemade--and when I order it without eggs (I'm allergic), they knocked several dollars off the price without my asking. Our server was nice and prompt, and we both enjoyed our meals.

If you are looking for a nice breakfast in a pleasant environment (you can also wander the little shops inside the hotel and a couple of nearby blocks), Matteo's is a good bet.  It's also one of the few places in town that has pleasant outdoor seating and allows (well-behaved) dogs on the patio.  I cannot personally vouch for lunch, but I have heard positive things about that menu as well.

Also, many people have given glowing reviews of this restaurant on the Yelp page for the Boulder Dam Hotel: http://www.yelp.com/biz/boulder-dam-hotel-boulder-city.  If you factor those in, Matteo's gets much better reviews than this page shows.  I would definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"Went here today for a late lunch date with my hubby. 

There were a few tables occupied, but it was not slammed. When I walked in I noticed a specials board outside that mentioned crab ravioli with a saffron cream sauce. It sounded so delicious, that nothing else was going to come up to scratch. 

When we asked the waitress about the dish she continued the description by mentioning that it would be topped with a Jonah Crab Claw which sold me on it. Though it was the most expensive dish on the lunch menu ($28) it was worth every penny. The ravioli was stuffed full of crab and no other filler, and the sauce was heavenly and we took advantage of the bread to soak it up. The crab claw, ended up being 4 big crab claws. It was amazing! 

My husband decided to go with the linguine primavera in alfredo sauce with chicken. This dish was delicious, and the pasta was perfectly cooked. The chicken was also perfectly cooked and a large portion for an add on. The one thing I will say is that the alfredo sauce wasn't the cheesiest, but I think the lightness of the sauce enhanced the dish. 

We don't eat carbs that often, and when we were leaving we said that this \"cheat\" was worth it!

We will definitely be back when we are ready for some serious carb heaven!"}
{"text":"I want to write this very carefully. I came in for restaurant week, so I expected it to be bustling. From a previous experience I also expected it to be good, but it was not. 

We came on Friday and it was packed. I felt like our server and the kitchen seemed overwhelmed. We waited a good amount of time between our wine, receiving bread and our courses. Not that I mind staggering things, but especially the wine and bread should have been out quicker. The bread was fresh and piping hot, so that settled the rumbling stomachs once we got it.

I ordered the special of mussels in tomato sauce, Ceasar salad and polenta crusted cod. The mussels were okay. I wasn't thrilled with the sauce, as it seemed a bit bland. The salad was totally fine. But the cod, inedible. 

Now I will say, I felt very badly about saying something, but I wasn't going to eat it. It was mushy and the tomato sauce also seemed to not be seasoned. I took one bite and was done. The server didn't seem to concerned, but did exchange my meal for the tortellini. While that was much better, the experience had already been ruined. 

I must admit, I was surprised that a manager didn't pop in to ask if everything was okay. Especially since two of our four meals had been sent back. I also saw the chef pop out twice and he also never said a word to us. I just thought it was strange. Was it my responsibility to tell the manager? Or was it the server? I don't know, but I felt awkward about the whole experience."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I order from Matteo's very often. Nice, quiet, good food. Different from a lot of the bars in the area. We've never tried anything we didn't like, and the specials are always very fun and thoughtful. Yesterday we ordered Cajun tuna alfredo and hot sausage ravioli. Some of the prices are a bit high, but good food and you'll always go home with leftovers :)"}
{"text":"Cozy place but disappointing service. Took 30 mins to  get my drink. Can safely assume food will take an hour."}
{"text":"A group of friends (8) and I went to Matteo's on Friday a little after 7pm. They were very accommodating and put two tables together for us. The main reason I gave this location 4 stars instead of 5 is because of how long we had to wait for bread and our entrees. The service was very slow and we waited at least 20 minutes for bread and then at least an additional 15 minutes for our entrees. Their bread and dipping oil/sauce was delicious and their entrees were generously sized, reasonably priced, and very delicious! Overall, I'd definitely recommend coming here, but not if you are in a rush or super hungry!"}
{"text":"I wish I could have liked the food.  The appetizer of grilled calamari was okay, it everything else that we had was just bland or didn't meet our expectations.  The decor of the plan was cute and the server was great but the food fell really short."}
{"text":"Where's my dipping sauce?

The service was horrendous. Came with a party of 10 and they shouldn't offer to accommodate parties if they can't handle the request. We waited 30-40 minutes for drinks. The server ignored us for nearly an hour. Our reservation was for 7, we didn't order our food until 8:15. Food came around 8:45, so it obviously wasn't the cooks fault for the poor service. The wait staff was awful. A friend ordered a drink and waited 40 minutes and the waitress' excuse as, \"I ran out of hands.\" We are sitting right beside the bar and clearly see the drink order was never put in.  Another member in our group asked for a  cocktail and not a difficult request. The \"owner\" was bartending and messed up her drink not once but twice. She said she no longer wanted it and the owner at the bar directly behind us said \"what's wrong with it now?!\" Not a very professional owner if you ask me. 

Food was delicious, but the service took away from the experience. 

I wouldn't come here again."}
