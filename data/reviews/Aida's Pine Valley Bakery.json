{"text":"Didn't really think much of this place.   Tried a few of the cookies, as well as some pastry with nutella. Tasted like something you can get from a can in a grocery store."}
{"text":"I was tempted to try all the baked goods if I didn't have to fit into a wedding gown in a few months.   I ended up getting a half off chocolate mocha mousse cake for my friend's birthday.   Very moist and flavourful.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Super cute little place:) best staff& very traditional italian pasteries and sweets!!! the sfolgia cake is extremely popular because its the best. Everything is made in house."}
{"text":"Their cakes are absolutely delicious and they are made fresh every time. A nice little gem of a bakery and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Found this small BAKERY slash Retail Shop that has a variety of Baked Goods such as Breads, Biscottis, Cannolis, Cakes, Cookies.  The rest of the shop is stacked top-to-bottom with Italian items such as Branded Pastas, Coffee Beans, Olive Oils, etc...  There's also a noticeable Porchetta seating on the top of the counter with other FOCACCIA's and there's an industrial Gaggia machine for your Espresso pleasures.  I got a MIXED bag of 6 various types of 2-Bite Biscotti's which are by far BETTER than anything you've ever had from franchised-type Cafes.    The Cannoli's were CRISP outer shell while having a well-balanced and not overly-sweeten cream inside.  There are 3 creams to select from such as Regular, Almond, Mocha and all were EXCELLENT without feeling the fat from the cream linger like other cream pastries.  It was an OPEN KITCHEN area where I saw around 4 other elder ladies work their magic while another 2 took care of the front area.  These ladies were BUSY as I went in during a weekday afternoon only noticing the single patrons come in and out.  Friendly service as the younger lady didn't even mind my STUPID questions as I attempted to buy EMPTY Cannoli shells at a dozen for $4.00 but what can I say when I've actually have to ADMIT I've never had a Cannoli before!  She even threw in an EXTRA Cannoli for me!  :-)"}
{"text":"$26.00 for a tiramisu cake that we were told was fresh but was stale and tasteless. It was so disappointing as we used it for a birthday celebration and everyone who tasted it left their entire piece on their plates, which tells you how bad it was."}
{"text":"We planned to go to the bakery next door based on Yelp reviews and the fact they had churros, which my kid can usually eat. My kid was totally bummed when they gave us the blanket \"everything has eggs\" even though we were clear that we were not worried about traces. I get it, some places are highly risk averse.  So I was surprised when my kid was up for trying the bakery next door, Aida's. Boy, was she rewarded. This small bakery was hopping, full of smiling patrons and warm, helpful employees. When I mentioned what we were looking for, multiple employees talked about it and immediately named something my kid could have. It was a layered pastry and cream affair with a fresh raspberry on top. Not only could my kid have it, but she said she would want it again as it was great. I had a two bite chocolate cannoli which was perfect. We took home a massive tomato focaccia which was delicious. Most of the foccaccia is now in my freezer. :)  We will definitely make the drive to Aida's again and wish them much success."}
{"text":"A fantastic place for all your fresh baked cakes, cookies, pizzas, loafs......incredible! Is my GO TO place!!!....Always fresh!  Thank you Aida and staff for all your wonderfully baked goods over the years!!! Loyal customer and returning customer for 5 past years!!"}
{"text":"One of my Medical Reps brings me my fix every time she comes in.  2-bite biscotti with nutella filling.    Enough said :)"}
{"text":"I recently bought trays of cookies for a Baby Shower I was hosting.  I was recommended by a coworker and was so happy that I went there.  The bakery itself is very small in an industrial area.  The counters were full of a great assortment of cookies. All delicious. When I told the  girl what it was for she helped me put together the assortment.  My only disappointment was I should have bought more.  As soon as I served them they were gone in a blink of an eye. Sad part I only got to eat one.  They bake fresh breads and pizzas and their cakes look great too.  Definitely going back there."}
{"text":"Aida's is my favorite bakery in Vaughan, if you are looking for the best cookies, Italian home style pizza, panini and more. This is the place for you :) but you have to arrive early before lunch time. BTW the Espresso is the highlight of this place."}
{"text":"EXCELLENT EXCEPTIONAL FOOD AND SERVICE!   It's located a plaza and is a very small and unassuming little place. But I loved it the moment I walked in. Got birthday cake from here and was nervous about the cake and the design. They did a wonderful job with the design and the cake was DELICIOUS!!! I have to say that the guests actually took second, 3rd and even 4th helping of the cake! They couldn't get over the fact how moist, perfectly sweet and delicious the cake was. The design was gorgeous. Little different from what I had asked for but it was so pretty that I don't even want to think about it! Also, the cake maker called 2 days before and suggested a great design edit which was a great demonstration of really good customer service. Loved the design edit and loved the cake. Will ALWAYS get my cakes from here from now on!"}
{"text":"probably one of my favorite bakery spots by my work place, super friendly location where you can definitely tell everything here is made with not only the best/freshest ingredients but with love!(the best ingredient of all) this location is a bit hidden inside this complex, but is almost like a best kept secret situation. everything about this bakery is awesome, makes me first this location could be my home bakery when i want to pick up treats.  would go out of my way to come here!"}
