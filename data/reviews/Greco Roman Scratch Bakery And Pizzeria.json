{"text":"Need better signage and a website. Loved the lasagna pizza and caramelized onion pizza. The crust was very good on both. I was trying to find menu online and could only find picture on this yelp page. Will definitely go back when in Twinsburg again."}
{"text":"I was feeling generous and decided to try this place for lunch even though they don't have a website (usually a deal breaker for me).  Thanks to the other Yelpers who posted pics of the menu - I never would have even considered it without that.  The food is good enough.  I got a Greco salad, a sausage-hot peppers-caramelized onions specialty pizza, an apple pie square, a caramel chocolate square, and an apple fritter.  The salad was fresh and had a good combination of toppings.  Although like most pizza shop salads, it had way too much cheese.  One negative was they did not put onions on the salad even though they're listed in the description.  It was a perfectly fine salad without onions, but food not matching the written description is a huge pet peeve of mine.  They did this twice actually, since the pizza description says \"saut√©ed hot yellow banana peppers\" and the peppers on the pizza were not banana peppers at all and were not yellow.  They were genuinely hot at least.  Maybe this is not a huge deal for other people, but to me it just screams \"sloppily run business.\"    They had many pastries, cookies, pies, and donuts on display, which all looked good and at good prices.  The apple fritters are cheap at $1.  The biggest negative for the bakery items was that the woman put my goopy apple pie square in a paper bag, and both the bag and the pie promptly fell apart.  I'm not sure this item will survive until tonight for my husband to try it.  No question these should always be put in boxes.  This place is presented as a single business, but operates as two separate businesses - one for food and one for bakery.  As a customer, this is inconvenient and annoying.  The man who brought my pizza out refused to get my bakery items from the case, and the woman who got my bakery items could not tell me if they had forks for the to-go food.  If they want to keep the books separate, fine, but they need to do a better job on the customer service end.    Overall the reason I'm only giving two stars is the service - the food itself would have been at least a 3.  They did not in fact have any forks for the to-go food.  I think this is required if you do a take out business.  And the pizza shop guy was less than friendly.  I won't be back."}

{"text":"We have lived a mile from this place for a year and just discovered it last night. A true hidden gem in Twinsburg! The Greco salad was amazing and the pizza couldn't have been better. I highly recommend caramelized onions on the pizza. A family owned place with the friendliest owners. We will become frequent customers now that we know how tasty everything is!"}
{"text":"A hidden gem everything is HOMEMADE  the best donuts  check out there specials good customer service"}
{"text":"I was back home visiting family, and we were looking for pizza. A quick visit to Yelp turned up this local option. We ordered the Greco salad and the lasagna pizza. I asked for Greek dressing on the Greco salad, and they made it up for me from scratch! The pizza was absolutely fantastic, I've never had anything like it. The crust is perfection, and the flavors amazing.   If I had one criticism, I would have preferred the pizza be ever so slightly additionally baked, but that's just nitpicking on my part. I also picked up two of their Chinese cookies for dessert, and those too were amazing. My family didn't know about this place, but will definitely be back. I know I will whenever I'm in the area.  Highly, highly recommended. Support a great local family business and check this place out!"}
{"text":"Best meatball sub around! Bread is fresh and meatballs are fantastic! Bakery is also very good, homemade quality."}
{"text":"Wonderful pizza and bakery items. One of my new favorite pizza places on the East Side. We recently discovered this hidden gem. They have two businesses under the same roof.  First there is a bakery business, with pies, bear claws, italian pastries, bread, doughnuts, cakes, cannoli's and many types of cookies. So far we have only tried the cookies, but they were very good. They have whole cakes to take out and  am really excited to try those next.  Secondly, there is the pizza! We first tried the deep dish lasagna pizza, which features ricotta cheese, sauce, mozzarella, and sausage. We weren't sure what to expect, and it definitely wasn't that much deeper than a regular pizza, but it was delicious! A great combination- how did I not realize that ricotta cheese is lovely on pizza? The deep dish pizza comes in one size and is about 14\" across, good for 3-4 people or 2 people with leftovers the next day.  On another visit we tried the sausage and caramelized onion pizza. This was my favorite option. The spicy peppers, sweet onions, and sliced sausage were a great combination. The crust was a medium thickness (like most Cleveland area pizza shops) and the pizza sauce itself was zesty and slightly sweet (like perfectly ripe tomatoes), just the way I like it.  I  would also recommend the greco salad, fresh dark greens with lots of toppings, feta cheese, roasted red peppers and artichokes among them. So good!  This restaurant does have a few small tables. We haven't been there at lunch time, but you could order a slice to eat in, and they also have subs and wraps to order which I am looking forward to trying in the future. Most of their business seems to be takeout or catering. Probably the hardest part about coming here is the drive home, waiting to eat that wonderful pie."}
{"text":"Great tasting pizza and a full line of bakery under one roof. It is my new favorite spot for Pizza. I love the sauce and the crust."}
{"text":"If you like really good pizza, want it in Twinsburg and can deal with a few quirks, then this is the place.  The pizza was straight up delicious.  By far the best independent in Twinsburg, right ahead of Antonio's overall.  Dough was cooked and tender, good thickness, good cheese, sauce, and toppings.  The garlic bread was a loaf of bread with garlic, and cheese, and deliciousness.  The Greco salad was good size and fresh.  Big fan.  So the quirks.  They close at 7pm on Fridays, though they were nice enough to accommodate my 6:45 order.  The girl on the phone may know more about the bakery side than the pizza side, since she didn't know if they were open or not, didn't know what kind of banana peppers they had (hot or mild), and didn't know the dressings available.  Speaking of, the Greco salad sounds pretty greek, since by definition the Greco Roman is relating to the ancient Greeks and Romans, but they don't have Greek dressing.  Italian is Rome, so that was my choice.  They apparently offer an eclectic dinner menu with burgers and other specials, but I couldn't figure out how, where, why or when.  You'll have to use the menu in the Yelp pictures, but make sure it's the second one since the first is out of date, and I couldn't find a takeout menu, or anything that looked like a take out menu in the store.  But regardless, the food was great and the bakery side of the business looked amazing too."}
{"text":"First time visit for pizza. We just did the basic pepperoni mushroom but next time I'll get a specialty pizza. We got the regular crust which was a medium thickness and not too dense but not too light either. The menu says they have a New York thin crust too. The way I would describe the sauce taste is \"fresh\".  I love cold pizza so I had to wait until this morning to try that. Very good!  I would recommend this place."}
