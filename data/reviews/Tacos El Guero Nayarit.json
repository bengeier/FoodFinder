{"text":"Pretty good, ive only tried the shrimp tacos so far but they were worth coming back for. They do not accept debit/credit... dont forget your cash. If its after dark either dont go alone, or eat in your car!"}
{"text":"they have ceviche and all kind of mariscos(seafood). Tacos as well (duh). We got asada and tripe tacos...yum!!!"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying how much I love this place. I don't know how many of y'all have gone to Nayarit and had real authentic mariscos, but this place legit meets all that and more. Tejuino! Aguachile! Empanadas de camaron! Oh man, they have it all. The tacos: made with fresh masa tortillas to the order. Can't get a better burrito in Las Vegas then right here. I constantly take spontaneous drives out here all the way from Los Angeles! Worth it every time. 10/10 5 stars."}
