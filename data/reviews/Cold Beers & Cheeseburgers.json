{"text":"Service was great. For lunch I had the Prime Dip sandwich, too chewy for 14 bucks. Probably won't go back."}
{"text":"The burgers are AMAZING and the fries are nice and crispy. The only thing that could use some work is some of the attitudes of some of the employees (both servers and hostess'). Tonight is my second experience and 1 star to hostess but 4.5 to the server. Last time I would have rated the server 2 just for attitude but today she was nice and friendly regardless of it being a busy night. The hostess seems like she doesn't want to be there, which just kills the awesome vibe of great burgers."}
{"text":"I will not eat here again.  I cannot believe that not only were the fries cold but my cheeseburger came out with the wrong bun. In addition to that it took forever to even order it because the one person came up to the table and said your servers busy right now with the large party and will be here when They can. I cannot even tell you if our actual server took our order.  They were very apologetic about the fries and the bun  on the burger but did not care to make our experience better by saying let me take something off the menu. Needless to say the music was horrible fries are cold and I won't be going back here to spend a dollar.  Never did a manager come over either to say hey I'm really sorry about what's going on. Everyone wanted to go home and that was obvious. Waitstaff negative -0"}
{"text":"3rd visit and it waste worst visit. A Wednesday night big crowd for pre 6 o'clock and they were overwhelmed at the bar. Wrong orders , no drinks and generally slow service. And this is during the slow summer , hate to see the winter snow bird season"}
{"text":"We tried this place for the first time the other day !! The atmosphere is great and a lot of televisions for sports which is nice and a million beers on tap which is another plus. But the burgers we had were just ok which I was kinda disappointed about. I didn't love the buns and the meat was not that flavorful. I will come back tho to try maybe something besides the burgers."}
{"text":"Was excited to try a really good burger, but was sadly dissappointed! There were only around 6 customers and it took for ever to take our order, for the burgers to be served and to give us our check. The slowest service I have ever experienced, anywhere. The burgers had absolutely no flavor whatsoever! The buns were dry. We all ordered our burgers medium well, but only one was actually medium well, the others well done. They were the worst burgers I have ever tasted. Would rather have had a Five Guys, or an In and Out!"}
{"text":"This Shea location is a million times better than the Grayhawk location at 20831 N Scottsdale Rd #117, Scottsdale, AZ 85255.  We weren't judged when we walked in the door and were not given unwarranted attitude like the other location.  The people are friendly, helpful, funny, and polite.  Service is amazing compared to the Grayhawk location.  We can make it through an enjoyable meal without someone wrongfully trying to say we are cut off, even though only two drinks had been ordered and we didn't plan on ordering any more.  The food is fantastic.  I went for the third time in one month last night and had the grilled cheese with chili, very tasteful.  I've also had the pretzel, hummus, burgers, parmesan fries, and hot dog on previous occasions and have tasted the mac and cheese which I will make sure to get the next time I go back.  All of it is delicious.  I highly recommend the Shea location over the Grayhawk location, the managers won't give you an awful experience."}
{"text":"Went here after work one night for dinner and a beer. Mistake...should have gone to Oregano's where at least I know my food will be good. First problem: our waitress, I'm pretty sure it was her first time ever waiting tables and as far as I could tell she only had the 3 tables in the very back corner by the bar and was completely frazzled. Lack of training?? Not sure really. Second problem: the food. I ordered a Juicy Lucy and was expecting the eruption of cheese from the middle of he burger. What I got was a hunk of cheddar that was barely even melted. I'm not a cook, but logic tells you that a half inch or so thick hunk of cheddar is not going to melt...how about using shredded cheese in the middle so it will melt??? Also the hamburger had no flavor and had probably sat for a few minutes (or longer since it took forever to get our food) as it was just luke warm when it came out. We did order the pretzels and they were good. 

This place was packed, but I just don't see the draw. Lots of TV's (covering every inch of wall space practically) so if you just want to go watch a game and drink beer it would be ok I guess. Probably won't be back to eat, maybe for a beer after work, but I do hope the service would be much improved. Oh...and how about sporting some of Az sports team banners...Go Cards!"}
{"text":"Been coming here a few times a week always great food and awesome service busy packed or just chill evening. The bar staff,, Tessa, Nessa, Dani, Jeff, Jerome, Stacey, Taylor, Cinnamon  and all the rest rock 100."}
{"text":"Service was poor, food did not come as requested- burgers over cooked and items asked to be on the side were not, really overpriced. If you want fries with your burger instead of their boring chips plan on spending $15 and up for a burger. We won't be going back."}
{"text":"Great new location! Will definitely be the new happy hour stop on the way home. BETTY was a terrific server! Not only did she bring our beer and food promptly, she even asked if we wanted dessert! Woweeeee!"}
{"text":"This is an extremely average restaurant. I got the Arizona burger(?) I think. It had guacamole, pickles, sour cream, and jalape√±os. It was pretty much what I would expect from any chain burger place. Nothing super special. My meat was a little dry and not medium well at all. I got it on a pretzel bun which was pretty hecking awesome! Couldn't tell you if it was freshly made or not. Either way it was warm and really good. 

I really don't like the chips they give you. They were fried fresh and that's for sure. But they had no seasoning on them. I couldn't find any salt on the table for them. I really would have preferred fries. The chips just don't go with the burgers at all. 

But the kicker was the service. Carly was great. Dude with the bandaid on his face was horrible. He brought out my food and literally dropped it in front of me. Then walked away angrily. Like sorry for eating here I guess??? 

Also, do you really need every inch of wall covered in TVs that are all of the same chanel? Could we hang them higher than 6 feet off the ground? I hit my head on like 4 of them"}
{"text":"Tried this place out with the family, the food was great but the beer is overpriced for the size of the glass that you get. The pretzel was awesome, the fries crispy and hot and our burgers cooked to perfection. The music was also really loud, felt like I had to yell, could be turned down a notch."}
{"text":"I had mixed feelings about this place. My wife walked and it was packed, but we were seated right away. We noticed right away that it was really warm. Apparently the A/C was out which I know does happen so not totally knocking them on that. But we trying to escape the heat, so made it much more uncomfortable. I had a beer which was fine. My wife on the other hand tried a couple of their mixed drinks and they were awful. You couldn't taste any of the alcohol which made them super weak. For a $10 drink I would expect them to be much better. She tried two drinks and they were both disappointing. 

However, the food was really good. We tried the buffalo egg rolls and they were delicious. The dressing it came with was really tasty. We both tried different burgers and they were also good. The meat was perfectly cooked, but just too much bun. I ate half the burger and then just the other half without the bun. I am not a big guy, but I can usually grub. There was nothing wrong with the bun at all, but just be prepared for it. I probably would have been ok if we didn't have the appetizers, but I would take the egg rolls over the bun any day.

For an $80 meal with drinks I thought it was just ok. Cooler tempature would have made the experience much more enjoyable. The right thing to do would have been to offer their customers some type of discount since we technically pay for the A/C and we didn't get any of it. However, we will never order any of their mixed drinks again. They seriously need to step that up.

Overall this place looks like a cool place to watch a game."}
{"text":"All these reviews are the reason why small businesses are opening and garbage chains keep popping up.. would've five star but I don't drink beer hah continue what you're doing 

Everyone complains to complains especially every since yelp self absorbed people that don't understand how business works - everyone's entitled but don't ruin other people's livelihood"}
{"text":"First off---we waited almost 15 minutes before someone came over to take our order.--mind you, they only came over because we finally got out of our seats and asked for service at the table!  Second we waited almost 45 minutes for the food to come to the table---keep in mind we have 3 children with us all under the age of 8 so patience is gone by now.  Third, no refills on drinks and Lastly----we wanted to leave and pay the bill and once again our server was not helping us so I had to physically take the bill up myself to pay.  What a complete waste of time.  If you are looking for a good beer and WAY better service, do yourself a favor and go to Red Robin.  The service is much better and so is the food.  What a joke.  Never again."}
{"text":"We had to wait an hour for mediocre food. The manager comped our drinks, but should've comped our whole meal. Won't be coming back here anytime soon. It's too bad because this was not our first time here."}
{"text":"From the first visit I felt this place was a bit sleazy. That visit the manager stood up on the bar in his street shoes and hung up the liquor license without wiping off the bar. Today I went in for a couple of drinks at lunch, laid my credit card on the bar and bartender stuffed my credit card in her bar and served other clients till she was ready to process my tab. Sleazy place, won't be back."}
{"text":"I really want to like this place. Have been there 5 times since it opened ( its very close to where we live) and the service has been horrible EVERY time. Bartenders add drinks to your tab that you don't have ( never in my life have I ordered a jack and coke, yet there it is on my tab). Servers are slow and pretty apathetic to what customer wants ( simple things like extra napkins).   Smokers smoke right outside the rail of the patio, supposed to be at least 15 feet away.  I know they are busy, so they probably don't care, but there are still other options in our area."}
{"text":"Slow service at the bar. Forgot to enter our appetizer order. My build your own burger did not have what I ordered on it. I asked for medium and it was definitely rare. This was a second chance for this location and I am disappointed again. Just trying to leave and I can't even get my tab. Just asked for the second time. Finally got it. Bye bye. Never again"}
{"text":"Bomb burgers can't wait to go back and try another one!!!  the beer was pretty tasty too!!"}
{"text":"First time here and it was AMAZING! Sierra was our server and was so fun and personable. I was going to be boring and just get the All American Burger, but went with the AZ Burger instead. Great choice and just the right amount of spice for me! Also ordered the highly recommended Original Tot Chos as an appetizer and YUM! Especially loved the beers which were, indeed, COLD!"}
{"text":"Hostess was short, cold and did not look happy. Bottom line this place is a bar. Food is average at best and the lack of any decent appetizer makes it more below average. Go for a beer, nothing more."}
{"text":"First of all, let's talk about the food handling here. It's not mandatory for the chefs to wear gloves and that is completely understandable. What is not ok for the expo/food runners to not wash there hands more than once on a 5-8 hour shift. They touch there hair, clothes, floor and then stick there bare hands all over your French fry products onto your plate and put bare hands all over your burger. 
Water refills? Oh boy they hardly ever wash those glass water bottles and they're all filled from the faucet. Gross. 
Let's now talk about management.  Swears at them, flirts openly, and one of them is dating a server which they are all about favoritism if your new. 
I wouldn't eat here if I were you. Might get sick or some disease with the careless food handling and lack of good management!!
It's also funny they have there employee Adam g harassing me via messages by mistaking me for someone that they use to have work there. Alias' people...alias'. I can also assure all of you that half these reviews on yelp were staged with its employees friends and employees. Believe in this review people. What I say is true. I've seen crazy things in there by barely just watching and befriending employees that tell me everything and complain about everything!!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were in Scottsdale and passed this place. We went in primarily because of the name and we were very impressed! First off, I enjoyed the laid-back atmosphere. I was surprised it was so relaxed given the part of town it's located in. However, I was pleasantly surprised that this CB&CB lacked the pompous attitude often found in Scottsdale. Our server was absolutely amazing as well! She was attentive, friendly, and timely. Having served myself, I was genuinely impressed at her skills. In addition to a great atmosphere and fantastic service the food was downright amazing. My husband and I got burgers and we were both extremely impressed. In fact, that was one of the best burgers I have ever had. My fries weren't bad either, and my husbands buffalo wing chips were delicious. Overall, I can't say enough good things about this place and I definitely recommend giving it a try."}
{"text":"It's OK. Note the have very few low tables, so if you have kids you will have to wait. They should invest in a few tall highchairs to make this easier for families. The food is in no way healthy, but I guess that is what you expect from a sports bar. The cost was high for what we got, but that's to be expected int he neighbor hood it is in. And for some reason the kid's food came out blazing hot and the adults had lukewarm food. Next time try it the other way around."}
{"text":"The food here was alright. I ordered the veggie burger and it fell apart onto my plate. My side of fries (which were an extra $2) were very overly salted. The service was poor and lazy. I didn't get a refill of water the entire time I was there. Only reason I'm giving 3 stars is for the TVs and the sauce on the burger."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere!  Excellent service.  Vanessa took care of us all night and was on top of her game!  Thanks!"}
{"text":"Jessica is by far the worst server I have had in a long time. I get far better service at Chicfila. Wasn't asked once how the food was once we got it! Never got drink refills. We ordered a pretzel and it tasted like it had been sitting out all day. Dry dry dry. Took one bite and wasn't even offered a refund. Then took twenty minutes to get our bill paid as she is bussing tables and refilling others drinks. There were plenty of other employees standing around to get the job done. Came on a Sunday night and it was extremely busy. Not quite sure why as I would never come back or recommend anybody to come here! But I hope everybody has had better experiences with CB and CB than we did. 

 All I can say is thank god for the five dollar coupon for checking in on yelp!!!! So thank you for that!"}
{"text":"Best burger place so far in Scottsdale area. Also, decent selection of beer, 20ish beers I'd say. I like the Space Dust IPA best!"}
{"text":"Love this place!! Yummy burgers, truffles fries are so good and great list of beers on tap."}
{"text":"Great selection of beers, our bartender was very accommodating and knowledgable about the beverages. We ate there a different evening and were not disappointed in the hangover burger with turkey party and the buffalo sliders. A nice social atmosphere."}
{"text":"We came in late on a Thursday. There must have been some kind of trivia contest going on, so it was a little loud. We asked to be seated on the patio. It was a perfect April evening. We ordered a Rocky Point and Bacon PB&J. Both were awesome. Just the hamburger and bun alone tasted really good so it really wouldn't matter what you put on it. Chips were good too! I already know what I'm going to order next time! Service was good too."}
{"text":"Okay, I'm back tonight.... second night in a row, since last night was so good, I decided to come back and it was really good. We had buffalo tatter tots, very good, but our server Gabby was so good and very fun. Her service was incredible! She was very fun and we ate and drank. She was so attentive! Ask for Gabby if you want great service..."}
{"text":"As an Arcadia Tavern patron,thought we would give this sister spot a try....so glad we did! Amazing burgers....very creative!  Tons of flat screens for game watching....parking galore as well! Scottsdale Grayhawk locale which is great for us too. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The past two times I went here were bad. Last time my burger came out cold and over cooked. My fries were rock hard and over salted. 
Tonight my burger came out well done when I asked for medium. The serving of fries was small, way over cooked and over salted. My buddy's burger came out alright and his girlfriends Mac n cheese was not bad but the noodles were undercooked. 
The Maker's and coke he got was weak, and he knows it was weak because he's a bartender and knows how it's supposed to taste. 
Our server was pretty lousy. She didn't check on us after we started eating; she only checked to see if the food runner ran out the correct food. She also didn't refill our water because she was completely absent from the floor after our food was delivered. She was also too busy talking to a girl when she finally got back on the floor that she almost didn't notice our plates were cleared and we were waiting for our checks. 
I'm a server and it astounds me how poor quality the service was. The only reason why I gave two stars instead of one is because my roommate and his girlfriend's food was decent."}
{"text":"First and last time to go there. Horrible service. the burger was ok but the bartender was rude and had not customer service skills. This was my first time go8ng somewhere and giving $0 tip. It was horrible and I will never go back there bit recommend that place."}
{"text":"Awesome mac n cheese burger!  Service was good and everything we ordered was on point!"}
{"text":"Amazing. I beer selection is amazing and the food is delicious. I recommend having them cook your burger medium well to get the best taste. I wish I lived closer. Must try. The patio seating is awesome."}
{"text":"Have gone a few times since they have become busy, and the food suffers horribly. They can get very busy and push the bar business, don't care about the food being done right. Really, we're talking about not being able to cook a hamburger. It's a hamburger after all, not that difficult to do a decent job at it if you want to."}
{"text":"above average burger in a sports bar theme. The bar is unique that is both inside and outside and almost an L shape

Burger uses good meat, preparation seems inconsistent probably due to kitchen staff. Sometimes it is perfect and then you come again it is over-cooked and killed. Tough place to figure out. I see this as more of a restaurant than a sports bar where people hang out and watch the game

My personal favorite is the Pittsburgher or the Ring of Fire - but there is something for everyone. In my humble opinion the appetizers are not well connected to being a burger joint and well over-priced.

I wish they would be more consistent!"}
{"text":"Busy friday. Typical. Was able to get 2 seats at the bar.  Brittany. Fabulous and friendly . We ate buffalo chicken dip. Good. But spicy. But the cb cb burger. Perfect. I asked Brittany for beer suggestion. She was spot on with the red hook brewery. Cheers. Keep up. The good work."}
{"text":"Love the beer selection, love the booze selection but holy s**t the service needs some work. Was never asked if food was good, if I needed another beer, no water. Now in fairness the burger was good the tots we're disgusting and inedible. 

Second visit. I tried to order beer listed on the menu, and they're out. Tried to order second beer from menu and they're out. Finally third beer they had. Bartenders did check on us a couple times but overall subpar service."}
{"text":"Had a great night! Awesome place, but our waitress, Hannah was the best part of the night, loved the food and atmosphere but the service will bring me back.

{"text":"Im actually pretty disappointed in this place. Came here on a Saturday for lunch. It was pretty busy,  but I figured they would be on their game. Took 45 minutes to get our food. I just about ate my arm off!!  They brought my daughter's mac and cheese 30 min before we got our food. Service was poor, food was just ok. The other time I was there was in the bar area, I swear I had to waive my hands over my head to get the servers attention.  There were some employees talking off to the side, ignoring everyone who had a empty drink. I cant remember exactly what they were talking about,  but something about how wasted they got the night before. I'm pretty sure I wont be back. The mexican food next door is much better and they serve beer and margaritas.  Dont waste your money or time, cuz its pretty pricey too."}
{"text":"Have been here numerous times... Never had an issue with service.  Until today.  Waitress was upset because we had her come back when she was ready to take our order  with that said when we were ready.  She ignored us. All the while her boyfriend came in to chat after I let her know we were ready to order she proceeded to walk outside with him and made out with him.  
Needless to say.  I had the hostess grab her to take our order. She was clearly upset.  She had to come back to take our order.
Very unprofessional. . 
And horrible service.  There is a time and day for that.  Just not on my lunch break."}
{"text":"First time here was a for a happy hour.  Despite being packed the service was excellent.  Every drink, appetizer, and meal was delivered promptly.  For me if the service sucks nothing else matters.  Since service was great let's talk about the food.  I tried their Hell Fire Chips as an appetizer.  The name says it all.  Very spicy but good.  I ordered a regular burger for the main course and it was delicious.  Juicy and cooked perfectly.  Now for the beer.  I like amber and brown beers and their selection is fantastic.

If there was one negative it would have to be the parking.  I went during happy hour on a Friday so I expected it to be busy but parking was a pain for my group.  I was able to find a spot in the strip mall parking lot but other people in my group needed to park down the road.  I don't consider this a big enough negative to take a star away.  I highly recommend Cold Beers and Cheeseburgers."}
{"text":"Their new steakhouse truffle burger has to be one of the top burgers I've ever had!  The meat was cooked precisely as ordered.  The seasoning and toppings were balanced to near perfection.  

My wife and I weren't very hungry, and she isn't a fan of burgers, so we split the it. This amazing burger left us both wanting more. 

We'll definitely stop in the next time we're in town!"}
{"text":"The only things that save this place is Caitlyn, the beer, and the food. Our server, as well as all other servers and a manager, walked by us 4 times without even acknowledging us. We had to ask a server to just get water. Caitlyn wasn't our server but she took time to make sure we got our food and drinks. Everyone had an unhappy face and looked like they hated their life. I'd order the food to go. Save yourself the frustration."}
{"text":"Killer Good Burgers! Cold Clear SunBru's 
Amanda was our awesome server also they have a Monday through Friday happy hour from 3 to 6 I'll be back I love this place!"}
{"text":"I love the burger and beer selection here. Definitely great for a lazy Sunday spent watching sports on one of their many tv's."}
{"text":"THE WORST SERVICE. We started out with a quick 35 minute wait for a party of six--no big deal for a Friday night in Central Phoenix. But then we got GABBY. And I hope that you don't too. She declined us the opportunity to place our order three times--\"Let me get your water\" then \"let me grab your drinks\" then \"I'll be right back.\" But then she never came back, and 45 minutes after sitting down we hadn't ordered. Then my friend went to the bar to get a beer because he declared that it would be faster than waiting for Gabby. We all protested his actions at first, but then realized that he was right--Gabby never came. When Gabby finally rolled around (long after my friend retrieved a beer from the bar), we told her we were going to venture elsewhere where they would actually take our order (and noted that she served our apps to the table next to us). She proclaimed \"this has never happened before,\" which we could only assume meant that she had never waited a table ever, because otherwise we were sure it must happen often given her performance. And then we left because there are a lot of good places in Central Phoenix with delicious burgers. Why waste your time here? We wandered over to the Parlor and were happily served delicious pasta and pizza. Now we're hoping this terrible cheeseburger place closes and makes space for something deserving of our beloved neighborhood."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar. They had beer. That's the positive. The bar was out of several beers on tap, sorry. It's Monday Night Football and you're out of beer. 

Our food came, and my wife's burger was rare. Excuse me, she asked for well done. We sent it back, and the bar back said he'd get another burger to her right away. 

The re-fire on the fly took 30 minutes. It was medium rare, and when my wife said so, the manager asked her how she likes her steak. WTF. 

So I ate alone, and my wife didn't eat at all. The manager took the burger, which we didn't want, off the bill. Well, yeah - she didn't order a medium rare burger 

So we'll be sharing the customer service (lol) and our experience with everyone we can.

 Needless to say, Zipps (with lower prices and a kitchen that can manage to cook a well-done burger) will be getting our patronage."}
{"text":"The burgers are AMAZING! I built my own and hubby had the steakhouse truffle burger. Both were great. Only complaint is service is just OK... Got seated by the hostess at a table made for 4 but we had 5 in our party she was supposed to get us another chair but we waited until our waitress got there and she finally got us a chair. We didn't get enough silverware or appetizer plates even after getting appetizers so we ended up taking them off the table next to us... My son ordered a Sprite and she brought all the adults at the table our margaritas and never brought my sons drink. It was busy though so I get things can get chaotic. Food is a bit pricey but really good, I just really don't think fries should be a $2 up charge... Burgers typically come with fries... Get the chips that come with it instead they were actually much better than the fries. If I didn't love my burger so much I may never go back but I would say we will return at least for happy hour."}
{"text":"Was there last weekend... The food was good not great and service could be improved.  I ordered the pit burger which is pretty much a BBQ bacon cheeseburger. The burger was served with a knife in it and it felt like they added an extra helping of BBQ sauce where the knife was stuck. So when I actually cut the burger in half, that area including the bread was drenched in BBQ sauce. The rest of the burger was not soaked like that which is why I think they added extra BBQ sauce where the knife was stuck into the burger. I was not impressed with my burger being served that way. The waitress got my friend's order wrong bringing her the wrong burger so we had to wait another 10 mins for her food to come out. This could have been prevented had she wrote down the order. Overall, they're ok. Will probably give them another try and see if next time is any better."}
{"text":"Great location.  Extensive beer list.

Menu a little pricey.  Sandwiches come with chips and to sub fries it's $2.  I ordered the all American cheeseburger med/well,  it was still quite pink inside.  

The waitress was very nice.  We talked with the manager about what events they will be having and the extension of the beer garden.  We are hoping to visit here often,  but mostly for drinks."}
{"text":"We went for lunch using a groupon.  Great service, good burgers, plenty of food for left-overs, but quite expensive..  I'd only go back if I had a 1/2 off coupon."}
{"text":"Normally love coming here but not tonight. Waited over 40 minutes for our food and it came out cold. Sent it back & still cold. Hubby & I love the pb & jelly burger & the pastrami burger. Should have gotten one of those but decided to try the Mac & cheese burger. BLAND!!! Should be called Mac burger with watered down cream color liquid. No cheese flavor at all. It tasted like plain pasta. 

What a disappointing visit. Drove 30 minutes for a big let down."}
{"text":"First time here. Really good first impression. Went on a Saturday night around 5pm and had to wait 15-20 minutes which seemed reasonable considering the place was full. If I could think of anything negative it would be that the hostess's seemed a little immature (3 of them standing around being silly) and way off on their \"wait time\" to customers, they have the \"No Wait\" app and when we walked in there wasn't supposed to be a wait, there was a bigger table open that they ended up giving to a party of 6 that came in 15 minutes after everyone else was waiting (with no reservations). We had an awesome server, food didn't take long to come out at all and the temperature on the burgers were perfect. Personally I thought the beer prices were high but they had a modest selection of different drafts which was nice. Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"great place for burgers and a cold one... there so many TV's you can watch every game from all the sports. The staff is friendly and and eager to help. I recommend the steak house truffle burger."}
{"text":"Wow, finally opened! Great burgers and drinks. The beer selection is amazing! The large screen TV's will be great come football season! There is a great selection of dogs as well! Over 100 beers too chose from! This place has a lot to offer! Welcome to the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"If I could take away stars, I would. 
I went with a girlfriend on Saturday for lunch, thinking it was still Uncle Bears. Thought we'd check it out anyway. 

It was 15 minutes before a waitress even acknowledged us. We tried to order a long island and a crown and coke. Our waitress told us that the bar would only make the drinks on their list of cocktails. Really? Umm no. We then just ordered a beer each and jager bomb....25 minutes later, she still hadn't brought our drinks. We asked her to scratch the beers and just bring the jager. Literally seconds before walking out, she brought \"jager bombs\" and both of our beers. Beers were both wrong and jager bombs weren't jager bombs...we don't know wth they were. We paid the full ticket with out drinking our incorrect drinks and went to San Tan instead, where they served us a long island and a crown and coke and amazing food (As always). Sorry but never again."}
{"text":"Great place! Cold beer, great cheeseburgers and wings. Our bartenders name was Steve. Very knowleagable. The tv's in this place would make it great for football. I'll be back no complaints here."}
{"text":"Had a great time at this establishment . Food was good and our waitress was very helpful. I asked for a suggestion on what to order. She said I should have the PB&J burger. Now I thought this was crazy. It was the wildest burger I've had , and good to boot.  Thanks Hanna!!!! Along with the the food choice we always had beer readily available. I enjoyed my time here and I will definitely be back, and hopefully at my new favorite waitress's table."}
{"text":"Burger are great

Mac and cheese is nice. 

A few interesting appetizers


Wednesday night is you are the boss burger night.  All the toppings you want on your burger for like 12 dollars.  Unlimited.  Your connotations can be incredible 


I come in on a Saturday afternoon to watch the open and some nfl preseason football.  Nfl network not on any tv in the joint... no preseason football


Good food.  Not much of a sports bar. Sucks they will not put on preseason football but showed some exhibit baseball game from under armor.   Who cares about exhibition baseball when preseason football is on.... what is wrong with this place.  Not football friendly..!!!!!"}
{"text":"Completely overpriced.  Too long of a wait for lunch.  Open tables with dozens of people waiting.  Full menu not available..  $70 for a family to have burgers for lunch.  5 of us and two of the kids shared.  Never received the beer I ordered.  Never received my iced tea.  Just a bunch of TVs.l, just like every other restaurant."}
{"text":"I came to Cold Beers and Cheeseburgers with my mother, grandmother, and friend while on vacation.  This place is located right across the street from my mothers home.  We came during the NBA Finals so it was packed and wait time was 30-50 minutes.  We came right in and went to the patio.  Once we ordered and received our drinks it's was a pretty cool atmosphere.   I had a bug in my drink so the bar replaced it no questions asked. ( since I was outside I figured it fell probably from the tree or something because it wasn't there when I got the drink). The service was great and our waitress Hannah was awesome.  She made sure we were taken care of and I really felt like the customer service was number one.   Definitely will come back food was great and my drink was good as well."}
{"text":"Just left this location because NCCA March Madness on but had to ask to put games on while TMZ was on a TV. REALLY! so much for \"watch every NCAA tournament game\" not interested in go my back"}
{"text":"the best thing about our meal was the ice water. Truly it was beautiful ice water. Tall class full of crushed ice and a lemon wedge. Other than that? Meh. Too many good places to ever return here. Waited too long for our order to be taken. Ordered two cheeseburgers (build your own) and a pretzel appetizer. And a blue moon, which they dont have anymore so i got a shock top, and an iced tea.  Both cheeseburgers were ordered medium- mine was medium rare inside, with red juice soaking the bottom(untoasted) bun, hubbies was well done. When i pointed out the bloody inside of my burger to our waitress she said \"yep, thats medium, warm and pink inside!\" Then she offered to get the manager, without offering to bring me a properly cooked burger. No thanks. Did i forget to mention the pretzel? No, because they didnt bring it until after our burgers. Grrr. And it was burned on the bottom. At least they had the self awareness to remove it from our bill. And they never refilled the iced tea. Do yourself a favor and walk over to pei wei."}
{"text":"So, I didn't think it was possible for the reviews to actually be accurate.  They were not, it was completely worse :-(  Hubby ordered a burger medium....came out raw.  Everytime one of us ordered a beer something completely different came out.  A friend ordered the Breckenridge beer...... a side of ranch came out....wtf?!?!  Management: you need to train your staff better.  The girl that served us was straight out of training.  WHY would you have a brand new server start on a college football Saturday.  Maybe a Tues or Wed during the day would be less intimadating.  With all the options on 7th St Cold beers and cheeseburgers, you need to up your game."}
{"text":"Cold beers and cheeseburgers is my kinda place, with the lovely staff and the great food this is a family resturaunt. The burgers are fantastic and the service is great- recommend the 1000 island burger with French fries. Also the tots were very good as well, cold beer was just the answer to a lovely dinner!"}
{"text":"We always enjoy coming here to watch sports.  Bartenders are great!  Love the Buffalo Chicken egg rolls and Buffalo Chicken Totchos."}
{"text":"We ordered a cheeseburger and it was ok. Not amazing and not awful, just an over salted cheeseburger. They had a football game on and it was way to loud. We had to yell over the commercials and I left with a slight headache. The location is good, service was acceptable and there is plenty of parking. I don't think I would go back though."}
{"text":"Quality of Service
It was little below average.  The waitress didn't know the menu - foods or drinks.  What we received vaguely resembled our order.  She didn't care enough to put forth the slightest effort. 

Quality of Food
It was terrible.  The tots were burned.  The fries weren't seasoned.  The burgers were overcooked and flavorless.  Some ingredients from standard menu items were missing."}
{"text":"We went when they were slammed. The service was great and the food was delicious. One burger was overlooked but still good. They are new so minor kinks are expected."}
{"text":"Went there on a Friday early evening. The place was crowded and as a result it was very hard to get waited on. The food was ok."}
{"text":"My family loves this place - the food is always great.  I've had burgers, wings, sandwiches, so a pretty thorough sampling of the menu.  Definitely on the pricy side, but I'm willing to pay for flavor and consistency.  Don't forget about the 10% off Yelp coupons!"}
{"text":"Waited patiently for 25 min to receive my food and when it finally arrived, wasn't what I ordered.  I again waited patiently for the server to finally come over and apologize for the mistake. I asked how much longer and her response without checking said about 5 minutes. Manager came over to apologize.  I asked him where my order was and was going to check.  Next time a manager comes over after messing up an order they should already come with the answer. I wouldn't even give this place one star!   I will NEVER come here again.  Not worth my time or money."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed. The food is not worth the price or the wait to get it. The waitress was inattentive and our order and bill was messed up twice without real resolution. I could only eat 2 bites of my sandwich and then they failed to make it right with the bill. In addition, I asked which drinks were included with the kids menu only to be charged $3 when the bill arrived.  Overall terrible service and only ok food...."}
{"text":"On Saturday and Sundays they serve breakfast! Starting at 9am until 11am. Great prices too! Touchdown!!"}
{"text":"I stopped in here to pick up a burger to go. The hostess recommended the open pit with the Bbq sauce and bacon. Glad she did because it was delicious. I hung out at the bar while I waited on my food and I was a little envious of the folks day drinking on the patio. This spot is nice for the area, you don't see many casual day drinking spots. I'll have to come another time so I can drink some Purple Haze on their tap."}
{"text":"It was unfortunate what happen to us. All we wanted was a good meal and a few drinks! What we received was a empty stomach and complete negligence to our presence to this establishment. 
First we walked in and after standing at the \"Please wait to be seated\" sign for more then five minutes we had to walk through the restaurant to find help. A man came over and said \"ops looks like she forgot to turn the sign\" we were sat and rough menus then sat another 5 min with out any acknowledgment from anyone. Servers were walking around, busses and bartenders. We sat there with our whole order in mind but no one to take it. After about 8 min we got up and left. We came to a local spot down the road \"Zips\" and received excellent attentive service."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went to try this place out to watch some pretty big UFC card fights, we've never been to this establishment before. First impressions, the place is set up well, we were happy to be put on the patio because there was a TV directly in front of us. We started our meal with their buffalo chicken egg rolls, they were surprisingly awesome so we were pretty excited to continue our night there since we would be there for a few hours. Everything was going great until we asked for the patio TV to be changed to the fights, not a soul was on the patio except us, it was oddly slow. They said ok they'll see what they can do.. so 10 min go by, no waitress, no TV change. I saw a busboy and flagged him down and asked about the TV and he said he'll see what he can do... nothing... 10 min later we realized we haven't seen any waitress or anyone and we were sitting there with out menus ready to order our main entrees. So 5+ min go by and here comes our waitress again and we asked about the TV and she said, a manager was supposed to come over. We ordered our food at this time. No manager showed up so I went and found one, he told me the TV could be changed but they couldn't put on the volume because it would change the entire restaurants sound... so eventually our food came out, I ordered the Juicy Lucy cooked to medium. My burger was genuinely cold to the touch... the cheese in the middle was solid... I took a bite in to the burger and it was rare... I'm talking dead rare. I went and found the manager AGAIN... by the way the waitress never came back to our table... he apologized about the under cooked meat, didn't offer to correct it, didn't offer to comp it, didn't offer anything. It was very unprofessional the way the whole night went. I wont be back, my money and time is to be spent in a place where they want my cash. Plus you would think a place with burger in their name they would be able to make a burger. Working in customer service means you service customers... tell the manger and waitress that for me."}
{"text":"Went to this place the first time, ordered my burger medium and got a well done burger. Boo! Thought I'd give it a second chance and went a second time. Ordered my burger medium rare and got it medium. My husband ordered his medium and got well done. My mother in law ordered the sliders and they were burnt. Look, if you're going to have a restaurant that specializes in burgers then know how to cook your burgers!! Really disappointing. Will never go again and will be sure to tell everyone I know not to go."}
{"text":"I met a large group (10) of girls here at 4:45 on Friday. Took 20 minutes to get a table for our party, but the restaurant was packed! Took a while to get the first drink and we were worried about our food taking a long time to cook since it was packed so we put our order in as soon as we got our drink. The food came out pretty quick! I ordered the happy hour All American burger with their house made chips. Both were excellent and cooked perfect. Friend got the tatter tots with her burger and they were extremely salty she couldn't finish them.  The waitress wasn't really around when we wanted to checkout, we had to flag her down several times. None of us ordered a second drink since she didn't come around much and we figured it would take a while to get one. She didn't offer any other drinks or dessert and wasn't very warm. We felt rushed out. So other than service, everything else was good. It's a new busy restaurant with a Scottsdale price. If you go for happy hour the price is decent. Happy hour ends at 6:00."}
{"text":"Abundance of craft beers to consume. Food is just ok and can be a wait to get it. Original uncle bears was way better."}
{"text":"Cold Beers & Cheesburgers -  My family dined at this restaurant more than ten times, making it a regular choice mainly because the food is very tasty. The location is convenient with easy parking, and the outdoor seating is confortable and dog friendly.  Be aware that service is typically slow and the indoor seating can feel cramped. 

I will no longer dine at this restaurant because there was a dead inset (like a dragonfly) in my salad on my last visit.  I don't know if this is a one-time problem so please refer to other reviews in making your decision."}
{"text":"Went directly to the patio as I had my dog with me (5pm). Despite another table (eating) & several people at the bar, I sat for 20 minutes w/o being noticed. No menu, no server, nothing. After flagging down a bartender, it took another 10 minutes for the server to bring a menu - but no beer list (5:33pm). I'm a HUGE fan/supporter of this chain, and this was my first visit to *this* location - but it's hard to think of an excuse for such bad service despite so many staff. Unfortunate.

UPDATE: Ordered food to go & the check. Huge mistake. Waitress took my order, brought check. Food came after reasonable wait. Waitress never returned to take check (upright w card). After another 15 MINS (that is, 15 mins after food arrived), had to give it to the bartender. Livid. What a total service failure."}
{"text":"Terrible  service. \"Ran out of all white wine but Chardonnay\". All party ate but 1 of 5. Reordered after everyone else ate. No drink refills. Used to come here as a regular. Now moving on. Service has steadily declined. Last few encounters here similar.."}
{"text":"We had heard some stories about the slow start here. But Today seating was fast, server was friendly and attentive, food came out hot and delicious and beer was cold as advertised. This all occurred in a packed house."}
{"text":"Having gone to this location several times now, gotta say we are pleasantly surprised at the consistent service and atmosphere. We have gone at both busy and slow times, our food consistently good, service at the Bar very quick and bartender Tayler,( usually there) so refreshing!! Our favorites are totchos, truffle fries, buffalo chicken egg rolls, and their veggie burger w/ wheat bun is awesome! Haven't had a burger yet that hasn't been great!! Keep up the good work and expand that patio, we will be visiting regularly!!"}
{"text":"Great service, friendly staff the food was delicious. Tot Choos, Mac & cheese burger and fries."}
{"text":"Waited close to an hour for our meals and really not that busy at 5PM, Asked for a pinot Grigio and was told they were out... But I really could have done without the black hair in my cheesbuger and all the server had to say was \"i'm so sorry\". Won't be back."}
{"text":"Burgers are very good, servers are friendly, but would not recommend if you are in a hurry over a working lunch hour."}
{"text":"I wish the office was back.  Ok for starters the staff don't know table numbers, how to be attentive to a table, and most of all the menu!!!  How do you not know the menu?  The floor is slippery and your chair is like drunk girl at a frat house.  Food was nothing special wouldn't go just to eat again (for a joint with burgers in the name I felt a sense of shame for them), like the bar setup though...  A+ on that and they have Two Hearted which arguably is one of the best beers out there."}
{"text":"We have been to this location 4 or 5 times.  The hostesses are always very nice and friendly. But I don't think we have ever had a waitress who even pretended to like what she was doing or was happy to be there waiting on people.  She was rather unfriendly, verging on rude.  We felt very rushed to place our order.  We ordered sliders.  Three of the tiniest sliders on the planet.  Mine was prime rib slider...soggy on the bottom.  I visited the restroom while there...two of the three toilets in the ladies' room were clogged. The parking, don't get me started.  Overall, aside from relatively high prices when compared to other sports bars, the place seems to be suffering from lack of attention by management."}
{"text":"This place was horrible not only were we ignored but  the service was terrible. Don't come here."}
{"text":"This place is not child friendly. When we arrived, we were told that the wait was 15 to 20 minutes. As there were people waiting, it seemed to make sense. However, my 19 month old child wanted to walk around while we waited. I could see at least 10 open tables that were cleared and waiting for customers. I told the hostess that there were plenty of open tables and she merely said that they were \"working\" on seating people and that there were many people ahead of us. I'm not clear what she was doing as nothing needed to be done other than seat the customers. After 10 minutes, we were finally seated at a raised booth. My friend also had a toddler. The hostess sat us without bringing or offering to bring high chairs or booster seats. I had to get them. The booth was so high that the kids could not sit in the high chairs and eat off the table. After struggling with them in booster seats, I found a booth that was slightly lower. The restaurant does not have any regular tables inside and only a handful outside. A busboy was kind enough to relocate us but it was still difficult to feed the kids sitting a foot below table level. One of the high chairs did not have a working strap. We ordered off the child menu for the kids. In comparison to other restaurants, the food portion was small. Our food was fine except my friend ordered a hamburger with no cheese or bacon but asked for tomatoes. They brought it with cheese and bacon and no tomatoes. It took 15 minutes before anyone asked us about our meal and it wasn't our waitress."}
{"text":"Went out for dinner at this new location with family.  It's always busy, so having to wait wasn't a problem, waited 40 minutes for a table for 8.

Ordered appetizers and drinks, No Dr Pepper!?  Who drinks Mr Pibb??  Micheladas made with Bloody Mary mix, not Clamato??

Everything was good, except for the long....wait, and wait, for our food.  The problem was a backed up kitchen, to many orders!!  The waitress was good and attentive, but embarrassed, as several of her tables had been waiting awhile for their food as we had.  We did stop a manager who apologized and offered a comped appetizer and said our prefer would be out in 7 minutes, which was really another 25 minutes.  Finally after 65 minutes, our dinner came and we finally ate.  Food was good, but didn't enjoy much, after the long wait.  After a total time of 2 hours, didn't enjoy much.  No Dr Pepper, Micheladas made with BM mix not Clamato, and a long wait.  I'll come back again for a second try, hope it's a better experience!!"}
{"text":"The food is decent, glad they've expanded the menu.  Love the Old Town location, but this Shea location is always disappointing.  It's a sports bar close to home, so we continue to try it...wanting to like it, but don't.  The service is horrendous, every single time.  The waitresses disappear for long periods of time, almost all are rude and make you feel like you're bothering them.  We were in for a final four game and there were 5 of us...in the amount of time it took her to bring our beers, they could have easily sold us two rounds.  I'd be happy to not return."}
{"text":"They do indeed have a large selection of beers and burgers. Now on to everything else about this black hole, no soul, rather eat at home, copy cat crap hole.

The room is large and any wall space not dedicated to city code allotment for light and proper exits, is dedicated to the mighty poor resolution flat screen TVs. Let's just say there are 30 TV's, that means you get to see a nice variety of watchable events, right? Nope, you get to see 30 of the same game. Yet somehow I had to sit in a cantilevered fashion to see a tv at the right distance so that the images weren't distorted? and pixilated.

Then there is the issue of general volume. The sea of flat screens stacked corner to corner provide perfectly flat sound reflecting surfaces to frame the irritating audible assault of what is an obnoxious mixture of mostly crowd noise from tvs competing the hysterical scream/laughs of the youthful and bubbly staff, who all seem to enjoy working with each other... so much so that after getting one drink, I was not asked nor responded to by our waitress Alyssa for the rest of the night. Until bringing? us the check. That said, she was very nice and competent when we had her attention, as she wasn't even the worst or most blatantly apathetic. Attempted outsourcing to various other staff with repeated head nods, finger raises, smiles with a slight motion of an elementary style hand raising to politely ask: \"May I have another please?\" 

The menu looks on par with the other trendy burger places in up scale central Phoenix, similar to Joe Midnight Run, Zinburger, Hopdoddy... Prices ranging from 10 -18 bucks for burgers and the standard sides. All my gleaning tells me that they are following he blueprint for those aformentioned trailblazing institutions, but doing it well and with large portions.

And finally, the joys of valet parking. I understand the need for valet at certain locations, especially when self parking is difficult. Go Green Valet, with their throw back outfits of white knit polos with pleated khaki shorts looked cute mimicking the buns inside the restaurant with their cool hair style. I likely would have been able to wipe the gel off the cars moon roof, had they not closed the valet drive. And by closing the valet, I don't mean physically by putting signs or cones up to discourage incoming 7th Street traffic. I mean just with the words \"we are full.\" The lot does not have another obvious exit, so the shock and obvious irritation of the valet that we going to have to pull forward to turn around was a little, not cute. It was an unfortunate pairing of circumstances, to drive down the street to Bashas and walk a block back and then only get a single glass if water, and a 12 oz bottle of 5 dollar woodchuck. This seems to be what a useful valet service would do for you, but instead they block out almost all on site parking, then don't have the staff to keep the place flowing.

The first visit is likely my last visit, fortunately the lack of service saved my about 30 dollars in food and drink orders, so that is a win on a certain level. Can't wait to see what this space will become next!"}
{"text":"Just opened, and it's exactly what I hoped it would be. It's smaller than some of the other CBCB, but it makes up for it with the TV's! And a huge bar. The food was great, the service was outstanding, manager stopped by several times to check on us. The parking lot is an issue, but thankfully we walked. They have valet during busy times but this little shopping center is HOPPING so parking is probably going to continue to be an issue. We will be back many, many times. Welcome to the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"came here with my 3 boys for lunch on a sunday. it was busy but not crazy and ended up waiting at least 20-30 minutes for  my burger and 3 kids meals which felt like forever!!! i was on a time crunch and was almost ready to leave but since i had 3 hungry boys it was probably not the best idea. menu was really pricey for the selection and disliked how they charge you $2 extra on top of your $12 burger to get anything other than chips. food was just ok..my thousand island burger didn't have much flavor yet i felt like everything else was too salty. kids meals were just ok as well. i have visited the chandler location before and wasn't really impressed but thought i would give new location a try. well i was disappointed once again mainly because of service and i rather not pay high prices for sub par food"}
{"text":"Place was a pleasant surprise. Lots of tvs. Bacon Bleu burger and buffalo chicken totchos were excellent. Hannah was a great server."}
{"text":"I loved it here. I work right around the corner and I wish i had stopped here for lunch sooner. Great atmosphere. Love that they allow dogs in the patio. And the food wasn't bad at all. I will continue to stop by here in the future. Two out of three staff members that interacted with me were great so that's good! They truly need to be reminded monthly or so about good customer service. If they get that down they will go far"}
{"text":"If it hadn't of happened I wouldn't have believed it.

We walked in approximately 7:30 on a Sunday to a half full restaurant only to be met by a young hostess who told us that it was a min of a 10min wait for a table... As I looked at at least a dozen open tables I asked her why we could not sit.  She tells us \"I am trying to give my servers a break, we got busy...\" Again, we look around a half full restaurant with a half full bar (with an obvious bored bartender) and with a little surprise say \"Excuse me?, there are many tables available\".  She says with a huff that \"its really busy and we'd have to wait at least 10min, maybe longer...\" More than surprised I ask if we can order to go and she says ( I kid you not), \"no, its still too busy for me and my servers, you can wait outside if you like...\"

Manager/Owner:  Fire her.  Not only did she turn away multiple tables, she was so clueless as to her duties and role that she didnt even offer to sit us with a short wait... where we and others would have ordered a few drinks and waited for the staff to catch up...  If this is the way you run your place you will go out of business.  Maybe its years of working in restaurants, maybe its just me, but this was the epitome of horrible service and represents the exact type of person NOT to have working in any customer facing / service business. 

We will never return.  And why would we when there are several great places within a mile.  In fact we had a great meal served with a smile and kindness at Local Bistro just down the street.

TL:DR = moronic young hostess turns away multiple tables and customer because she doesnt know how to work or how to employ any semblance of customer service.  Yes, the cliches about millennials are true for a reason."}
{"text":"Great new restaurant in our local area.... FINALLY!  They are usually extremely busy so be prepared for that!   The food is worth waiting for though.... great menu, extensive beer selection and atmosphere is perfect for games or any televised event.   Service was great as well!"}
{"text":"Good food, good service!  Gotta love a place where a pretzel bun is one of your choices.  They have lots of TVs so it's a good place to watch a game."}
{"text":"Yummy!!! Even though the place was packed the service was fantastic and the food came out quick!  The burgers where great and loved the sweet potato tots. All I needed was maple syrup to dip those in."}
{"text":"The burgers and sandwiches are delicious and service is really good but almost $20 for a chicken sandwich with 3 topping is way too much"}
{"text":"Service good. Food good. But need to do something about the smokers. They smoke all around outside the patio and it is terrible for the patrons who do not like cigarette amoke"}
{"text":"Really a 2.5 but not a 3
Decent burgers; ok beer
20 (yes 20!) TVs blaring while I am trying to eat a decent burger is not the place for me.  YOu can't sit inside and not escape the TVs."}
{"text":"Way too pricey for average food.  Ordered a BYOB (Build your own burger) that had no price on menu for options.  Figured it would be about $10.  Surprised when bill came and $9 for plain burger, add $2 for one slice of cheese, add $2 for one avocado slice, add $2 for one slice of bacon, add $5 for substitute small side salad instead if chips.  $20 for an average burger.  I won't be eating here again.  

Surely I will have happy hour beer, with no food.  FYI, large beer is maybe an once or two larger than regular so save $1.5O and get regular.  Feel like everything is an up charge and hate being \"nickeled\" and \"dimed\".  

Atmosphere was fun, lively and a welcomed addition to the area."}
{"text":"We've found our new favorite burger place!  Great build-your-own burgers for both of us - one of the best medium rare cooks that we've had!  Onion rings are awesome!  Also really impressed with the Four Peaks CBC IPA- even hubby loved it who isn't really fond of IPAs, and those are my go-to!"}
{"text":"Oh CB&C I hate to do this to you, but I'm afraid you earned it. And it's not about the food. I am a regular visitor to this place probably coming 2 to 3 times a month to have the buffalo chicken dip, which I highly enjoy with a side of ranch. Last night we popped in at 9pm after a movie. Closing time was 10. Sat at the bar to grab a bite, but we couldn't even get the bartender's attention for a menu. I mean all the way down to shouting \"excuse me, excuse me\". Here's the catch, the bar was not busy, there were perhaps 5 patrons there. The guy tending bar was far more concerned with closing out for the night and talking football with some other customers to even look our way. A waitress did finally get his attention for us, and we ordered beer and asked for menus. You know what? After several minutes still no beer and the bartender was back to closing out his register. At that point we decided to leave. There is no need to beg for service and too many places to grab a meal to be ignored. CB&C, I hope you read your yelp reviews and fix this soon. I like your location, I like your food, but if I can't even order it, you've got a problem."}
{"text":"I ordered a BYOB (build your own burger) in which you write down everything in your order on a slip of paper. My order consisted of a burger with cheese, lettuce, mushroom and avocado. The Avocado came out brown and plastic feeling and there was no mushrooms. I find it hard to mess up a BYOB when the ingredients have already been written down for you. Needless to say I was very unsatisfied with my order and will not be returning to this location."}
{"text":"A group of us tried to go into this joint and we were turned away because we weren't \"friends and family\". I get it, it was the opening party, but why would they turn away customers willing to pay?!? They lost a \"friend\" in all of us..."}
{"text":"Very disappointed . Went here with a group of friends and their kids on a Tuesday night last week and the service was horrible. Our server forgot my husband's beer twice and we had to keep asking the busboy to find her to order. We don't even know the girls name she never was around. The food took forever and our appetizers came out five minutes before our food. We couldn't even enjoy our time out. I felt like we were being rushed . This is the second time I've been here and both times were the same , we just thought we'd give it a second try . Heard so many good things about this place and was not anything it was hyped up to be ."}
{"text":"This is just your avarage sports bar, I was really hoping for better when they opened by my place. I have now been there three times and not once have I received great service or even \"good\" for that matter. Food is mediocre and servers don't remember everything....something is always forgotten or food comes out wrong. I will not become a regular at this place."}
{"text":"The burgers are amazing! Drinks are good.. we came in on a Wednesday, not a lot going on because there weren't any sporting events but it was still a nice atmosphere. Jenna and Paige behind the bar were wonderful and personable. I can't wait for football season here!"}
{"text":"Called in and ordered 2 burgers and a appetizer of asparagus spears. When we got home, we discovered only 4 spears in our container. I called to see if there was an error with our order and was told in fact we were charged the $7 for the 4 spears as they were the appetizer. There was no apology, no 'let me take that off your bill' just a confirmation that we in fact paid $7 for the 4 spears we got (which were terrible on top of it.) The burgers were average at best,  way over priced and the service was terrible. Will never eat there again."}
{"text":"Absolutely love their buffalo chicken egg rolls and cheeseburger sliders!! Great beer selection, friendly staff and always something good to watch on their wide selection of big screens."}
{"text":"Went here on 5/24.

The good: Tot chos (nachos with tater tots instead of chips). i would order these again. Cold beer with lots of choices. Menu with lots of stuff that looks appealing. Sliders were very good.

Not so good: The au jus was super salty. Had the french dip and couldn't use much of the au jus. Ordered the brownie sundae and it came in a beer mug. Wasn't good and eating it out of a beer mug was weird. Our server asked us how we liked our food and I told him that the dessert wasn't very good. He said, \"I know, it's not very good\". They still let us order it and charged us for it.

I think there are a lot of good things about this place but steer clear of anything that has au jus and skip the dessert."}
{"text":"My friend celebrated her 29th birthday last night at this place. I met the Manager before hand and gave him a credit card for the group of 18. They ate and drank and had a great time. From the excellent manager, all the the way down this is a great place. They said the food and hospitality was fantastic. Thanks again for taking care of our friends. We will to continue to recommend your wonderful place to all our fiends. Cheers !!!!!!"}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to trying this place as it was so highly recommended. But our service was so bad. We saw our server to get our order, to bring our food and to drop off/pick up the check. When I told her my bun was stale or had been left in air and that my fries were literally cold (I ate like two) she brushed it off. I'm a very fair person and very understanding but this is so unacceptable especially for how much we spent."}
{"text":"I've been to this location several times and I've never been disappointed. The burgers are outstanding and the service is just as good. Keep up the good work and I will keep coming back!!!"}
{"text":"This is the worst restaurant ever for service. We have been there a few times and each time they do not disappoint in horrible service. I have had to ask for a waiter/waitress,  go to the bar for my own beers,  and had to fry and go find my own check when I was ready to leave.   If you have a few hours to kill waiting for someone to help you,  this is your place."}
{"text":"Everything about this place is amazing! Drink options are many and food is delicious. Even their veggie burgers are made in house and are excellent. HIGHLY RECOMMEND"}
{"text":"I have been here on several occasions and it is always \"just ok\".  On most visits my food has taken a really long time and when it finally came, it was cold and/or wrong. The most recent visit, my husband swapped out the provolone cheese for Swiss on his burger and was charged a $1.00. We can afford the charge but it seems petty given the burger came with cheese in the first place. They have a great atmosphere and good beer selection. The staff has also been very nice.  This restaurant has some major kitchen issues and is the primary reasons my company stopped taking clients to the Scottsdale location.  Seems the kitchen issues have trickled to the chandler location as well."}
{"text":"We arrived at 5:15 pm and sat on the patio. The server approached the table 15 minutes after we sat down and said \"these hostesses are awful, I just found out I have this table.\" She took our order and honestly we did not see her again until we asked another server if we could get our check. As for the food it was ok but overpriced. I can eat a medium rare burger even though I ordered it medium well."}
{"text":"Good food, good service. Crowded for a reason. A little pricey, but worth it!"}
{"text":"My Hubby & I used to go to Uncle Bear's frequently when it was open so we were happy to see another bar/burger place return. I had heard good things about the Scottsdale location so we wanted to give it a try. Our server was nice but very slow; it took 15mins to get our water & beer. Our appetizer took another 20+mins, it was hummus & pita bread; it was very good but it shouldn't take that long. When I finished my beer I ended up w/ glass in my mouth!!!! I got the mac& cheese burger & it was ok; way too much bun. We were there about 90mins, w/ a toddler, way too long. When we got home I ended up throwing up everything; it didn't sit right. Needless to say, we won't be returning...so disappointed."}
{"text":"Wow what an experience! Cold beer cheeseburgers double! CB&C is not joking around they are as advertised!! Kim was great"}
{"text":"We spent Sunday at this location of Cold Beers and Cheeseburgers to watch the Bronco game.  Our server's name was Haley (sp?) It was the BEST service we have ever had.  She was amazing and never skipped a beat.  We never had to ask for anything.  It was there before we could think to ask.  The food was great and even Todd the Manager came over to see if we were happy and enjoying ourselves.  We had a fun day and I felt it was important to acknowledge the GREAT service provided by Haley.  Thanks Haley We will see you again soon."}
{"text":"Good burgers!

Have eaten there and also gotten to go.  Both were good, although eating there is obviously better.  The burger is big, juicy, and cooked to a perfect medium rare (even when taken to go).  The tater tots are good and crispy.  The sweet tots are good, unfortunately not crispy at all.  The chips are good too, they're the homemade kind.  The burgers are priced well (you don't feel like you got ripped off).  All in all, a good burger and good service at a fair price."}
{"text":"Suggestion: Offer a lunch menu! Portions and prices too large for lunch.  Don't charge extra to sub French fries for chips.  

My sandwich was good my husbands burger was average and the chips were over cooked giving them a burnt taste.  

Understaffed although like other popular restaurants they had 3 girls seating people but only three waitresses for the entire restaurant and they were busy!! 

Great location and I agree with other comments that this area needs a restaurant here."}
{"text":"Stopped in after a movie. First impressions...busy, no tables open at 6:35 PM on a Saturday night, noisy, wait folks just doing there job... Not very friendly. FOOD, I ordered a build your own burger. Did not time the wait, felt we had to wait a little to long for a medium cooked burger. Tasty, but for my taste bun was to buttery. If I'm looking for a good burger near to where I live I'd go here rather than Blue Burger, but it's a look calmer In Blue Burger."}
{"text":"We've been here three times and at least one part of the order has been messed up and *every* time we've been overcharged and had to get the bill fixed. Each time, they didn't do the \"does this look correct\" part before taking our card, but we have asked after the first time. The service has also been lackadaisical at best. \"Oh, you want more iced tea?\"-- after flagging a server down and pointing to a long-empty glass. On the food: the chili on the Cincinnati hot dog was so incredibly spicy as to be inedible."}
{"text":"Love the Ring of Fire burger and don't forget to get the tot cho's (Garvey and bacon tots) Yum!!!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and staff!!! Chris the manager is super helpful and we had a fantastic time. We'll be back soon...probably tomorrow."}
{"text":"This place is always hit or miss for me.  Sometimes I have a great experience from the service to the food to the drinks and sometimes it's just a big mess.

I come back b/c it's pretty close to me and they do have a good beer selection.

Often times there are huge parties with a lot of kids so sometimes that can be a little overwhelming.

I wouldn't go as often if it wasn't nearby."}
{"text":"My friend and I ate at the pub tonight and everything was excellent. The server, Rachel told us about the \"build your own burger\" special and it was great.  She was friendly and personable yet efficient and professional.  She provided just the right kind of help, not too much and not annoying but just when you want something she was there, only too happy to give extra and above customer service..  It is only the second time I have eaten there, and I can say with all honesty, it is constantly good.  This was a great treat for both of us."}
{"text":"Terrible, Horrible, Bad Service.  Went tonight with the wife and 2 kids.  Were there for 2 hours and never got to try a burger.

The wait for food was soooooooooo bad!  No words to explain.  

All we got was cold chicken wings with blue cheese and we ordered ranch.

After 2 HOURS at this jip joint and we had to leave and feed the kids Taco Bell.

What A Disgrace!

Stay AWAY from Cold Beer and NO Cheeseburgers!!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time and mmm it was \"ok\"...not terribly memorable and of course as soon as we walked out we were approached by a gentleman asking us for money!!! Not a good feeling so don't know if we will be back...."}
{"text":"Lots of TVs, 100+ beers available (split between Tap, Bottles, and Cans), and good food.  Come here weekly and can't wait to enjoy during football season.

Wait staff and bartenders are top notch and have never really had a problem.  Only negative is their liquor drinks.  What is considered well at other bars is treated as top shelf here.  Be cautious...  A Crown & Coke is the same $7 that a Canadian Club & Coke is.

Other than that, beer of the month is always a good choice and well priced.  Only negative would say is I'd like to have seen larger \"Mugs\" of beer.  They offer Pints (16oz), and for $1.50 more you can get a Mug (19.5oz).  I'd prefer to see the larger sizes that Zipps down the street offers, but for now it'll do."}
{"text":"This location does not ooze the same vibe as the one in Scottsdale.  

The servers are rather slow - we were seated with no utensils - we requested some soon as we got our order and we were halfway done with food before we got them.

The beer on tap tasted stale. 

The buffalo sliders that I tried were soaked and mushy at the bottom! Yuck!

My kids enjoyed their Hangover burger - though the onion rings were more batter than onions. 

Overall, not a good experience. :(

We probay wont return for a while."}
{"text":"We returned to this fun place recently. My GF and I both got food poisoning from the cole slaw (the only thing we shared) and GF ended up in the Emergency Room for a day and left with over $1,000 in medical bills. She called to let them know what happened (this should NEVER happen to a restaurant patron) and they acted concerned, took her name and number, and promised she would be hearing from their General Manager. That was a week ago, no call back. Bad food prep practices, bad food safety habits, and bad customer retention efforts. We will not  be back."}
{"text":"Great place. Luv the atmosphere. Diappointed  ordered an appetizer and wasnt what we thought it would be asked for something else and was charged for botheven know didnt touch the one that we didnt want. Little thing but beware. Also asked for a happy hour draft $3.00 and was upcharged $5.00. Was told that a mug was $5.00 even though didnt ask for it asked for the $3.00 happy hour glass. Beware.."}
{"text":"Not as bad as the location in old town, but still not worth it. 

Pretty simple order took over half an hour to be brought to table. Had the prime dip with chips. Meat was good, role was good, cheese was plastic tasting. 

Seasoning always seems to be way off here: had the chips that were pretty much oil and thin potato....absolutely no salt on it. However, au jus for sandwich was beyond salty, almost to the point of inedible. 

If you were forced to eat here like I was, check in to get a 5 dollar coupon. Will make it a little easier to deal with."}
{"text":"We have been here twice and the service has been inconsistent...but the food has been great.  The burger is custom made to your order and comes out hot.  The ambiance is nice, especially when the weather is cooler and you can eat outside.  Both times we went on a Sunday afternoon and it had a great vibe.  Hoping the service can be more consistent."}
{"text":"I went to the chandler location last night food and service were great.  The parking was not the best.  I order the $11 burger and the bill came back at $16 because the waitress had me fill out a form.  I did not complain because they had a 15 cent drafts for Tax day and I made up for the difference in COLDBEERS!!!!"}
{"text":"Went last night and the service was terrible. Food was pretty good, but couldn't even get our drinks filled. Had to ask the bartender for our check because the server never came back. But, probably the most disappointing part of the night was the managers. No manager ever came through our section. One of our orders didn't even come out and the manager never came by to see if he could do anything for us. The server was horrible, but the manager should have seen what was going on. The funniest part was that as we were leaving two ladies were complaining about the exact same service that they had received."}
{"text":"Came in on Sunday night with 2 other people. Sat at the bar due to the long wait to get a table. After 10 minutes a bartender finally took our drink order. Unless you order a beer or wine the bartender was clueless to other drinks (unless the drink tells him what to make). One of the people in our group is a bartender and he was shocked the guy at this place didn't know his drinks. He had to tell him what to put in the drink (haha). Needless to say the drinks weren't very good. Onto our order, he came back we ordered (two of us had cheeseburgers and one had their make your own macaroni and cheese). Can't say how they were as we left after 45 minutes. Service here is terrible."}
{"text":"Today was my first time here since Uncle Bear's closed.  I came alone after a day of moving into a new home, was hungry and thirsty and this place is nearby.  I sat at the bar, and ordered a beer and a plain old hot dog and fries.  Just one order for just one me.  The beer was great, and the beer was all I had for about 30 mins, and the bartender was MIA.  A server appeared and brought me not one but two  orders of hot dogs that had stuff on them I did not request and wouldn't request.  I explained to her what my order was for, and she repeated it all as if I just changed my order.  She went away, and a few mins later the bartender resurfaced, noticed I had no food but didn't say a word; she went to the kitchen, came back and said they will fix my order, and confirmed that I really wanted a plain dog with fries.  When I added \"they brought me two, I just need one\", I didn't get much of a response.  I quickly received my original order, and the server seemed very perturbed to have to be doing that.  (Sorry my not wanting the wrong order has irritated you?)  The bartender didn't utter a word to me the rest of my visit, and left at the end of her shift without letting me know someone else would be helping me.  (I figured that part out as I watched her grab her purse and leave, then noticed a Ninja bartender guy looking my way and asked him for my check; thanks bartender guy!)  The food was great.  The service was horrible (except the bartender guy).  Maybe I just came in on a bad day.  (And I was polite the entire time, so no, I wasn't one of those nasty customers lol!)"}
{"text":"Pricey but the burgers are awesome.  It's worth the cost here and there for sure.  One of the only places that cooks a burger to order right (I go rare)."}
{"text":"This place has the worst service. It takes over  an hour to get a burger. Waiting for a drink and the bill takes awhile as well.  If you have an extra 2-3 hours the food is good. The wait for a table is only long 
because it takes 2-3 hours to order, get food, and eat.  This place definitely needs new management."}
{"text":"No one can go wrong with CBCB. Whether it's the beers, burgers, sandwiches or apps you're in the right place. Cannot wait until football rolls around so I can enjoy the games on their many tvs. Great atmosphere and friendly staff.

My go to is the peanut butter and jelly burger that comes with chipotle sauce and bacon. Their sweet tots are perfect with this burger as well."}
{"text":"This restaurant is much better than that you would typically find in a bar. I typically orderthe veggie burger. it has way too much soy sauce, both as an ingredient in the patty and more soy slathered on top. At least its homemade and not something you could buy in the grocery store.
The salads have very fresh ingredients and i would highly recommend 
The biggest issue is the lack of proper staffing. The vast majority of the waitresses are positive and helpful but they are typically stretched too thin. 

I would also recommend changes to the appetizer menu. Chips and salsa and other types of food options that Can be shared. Love the pretzels! Ask for the Macand cheese sauce with it."}
{"text":"This is a great place to go hang out with a group of your friends or whenever you're in the mood for burgers. Last time we were here, Jenna was our server and she was so polite and kind. She was amazing!!! She had a outstanding attitude and fun to talk to while we were waiting on our food. I just love this place and our amazing server :)"}
{"text":"Great food. Great selection of beers. Service can be slow, and bartenders are always over loaded, maybe add a bartender when they're really busy."}
{"text":"Wow, this place is a mess. Whose running this place? 40 minutes for 1 burger & 45 minutes for 1 appetizer? Told waitress we were ready to order & she told us to \"wait a minute'. Watched her serve drinks, retrieve meals and take orders from 2 tables who sat 5-10 minutes AFTER us (and ate before us). My burger came 40 minutes LATER, very overcooked and bland. Waited ANOTHER 5 minutes for the 2nd meal (AN APPETIZER of $7 for a few asparagus spears). We had a salon appointment to make (right next door), and literally never got to take one bite. The second our food was put on the table we immediatly asked for \"to go\" boxes. And being away from a fridge for several hours, our food went right into the trash anyway (and we were hungry). $40 of my hard earned money gone, what a great Mother's Day for 2 hardworking moms."}
{"text":"Pretty good place. Huge assortment of beers, and both times I've visited the food was great. This location is like a month old and we went the first week they opened and service was slow, but we just went back and service was pretty normal, so i think they just a bunch of new ppl geting into the hang of things. Parking sucks, you will probably have to park in the dirt lot next to the restarant.  You won't regret eating here though."}
{"text":"Always out of the good beer! Just sat and of course out if 1st choice. Might not come back!"}
{"text":"My daughter and I (along with my 11 month old granddaughter) decided to have Mother's Day lunch at our neighborhood Cold Beers and Cheeseburgers. We were seated at once and the highchair was brought immediately. The hostess  was welcoming and nice. As we studied the menu for something delicious,  our server, who was very sweet and personable, announced that our food would be free in honor of Mother's Day!  What a lovely Mother's Day gift and sweet surprise! My daughter ordered the Club and I ordered the Juicy Lucy. The Club was stacked high with meat and was delicious. My Juicy Lucy was cooked perfectly and was juicy indeed, and scrumptious! We have enjoyed eating there before. This was a special treat!"}
{"text":"Better to walk across the parking lot to Chipotle. 

Waited over an hour for my food and never got my order correct. Nor asked what my correct order really was.

They wouldn't comp the meal! 

Don't waste your time and money."}
{"text":"Went to opening on Thursday service was great, but, went back Sept 20 at 11:23 am and the service was non existant ! We asked to sit outside and the hostess had a server take us out and seat us.  After sitting outside for 10 minutes I had to go inside and ask the hostess if someone was going to take our order, her response \" oh yeah, sure \" several minutes later our waitress came and took our order, 39 minutes later our food arrived,  we finished our lunch and waited again but no waitress, so I had to go inside again and ask hostess \" can we get our bill and get a to go box \"  her response \"sure\".  No apologies by the waitress or hostess for the Lack  Service.   Not impressed with this place at all.  If you want a $13.50 burger I suggest going somewhere where the service warrants the price ! Also all the outside trash containers were over flowing with trash, you would think they would have had this dumped and new bags placed before opening, they were still jammed full when we left and we were there for over an hour."}
{"text":"Our server Vanessa was great!  She was very personable, knowledgeable, and most of all, made our experience a fun one with her outgoing personality. Hire more servers like her!"}
{"text":"Great burgers, with so many options.  It can get pricy if you're on a budget,  but it's worth it.  Fun atmosphere and the server was sweet."}
{"text":"Went with my wife and kids. Everyone loved their food. The burgers were some of the best I've ever had"}
{"text":"Delicious start to finish!  Loved the apps,loved the beer, loved the burger, service was fantastic!  Kids loved it too!  It was a win all around! We will be back again and again!"}
{"text":"Just happened in after grocery shopping
Pleasant experience.... cheeseburgers and dogs were excellent...  staff was cordial and beer was cold....
 great place!!!"}
{"text":"Burgers are bomb and can't be passed up for a happy hour price of $7.  Service has been good every time I've come.  They are my regular meet when I catch up with friends on this side of town.  Oh... and did I mention chili tatertots.  Oh yeah!!"}
{"text":"The drinks & food where great. The service and surrounding company was very poor. As a first time goer, it was very uncomfortable for me to sit at the bar, surrounded by guys, making fun of gay people and saying the most horrific things. I was going to speak to my bartender but then he decided to join in their conversation and encourage the behavior. At that point I knew this was not the place for me. If this is the type of place where I can't feel safe in while having a good time then I'll leave it to the yo yo's that go their and the ignorant workers."}
{"text":"This place has the best burgers!!!! It's a smaller place so it's a bit loud when it's crowded but the food is worth it"}
{"text":"This place is the best!! The burgers are absolutely amazing, and if you love tots as much as I do then you will be extremely happy!  Not only is the food amazing, but the service is great too.  A great place to go and hang out with friends!!"}
{"text":"We have visited Cold Bees and Cheeseburgers before. Never had an issue. Great food. We visited Friday 28th. Got in pretty quick. Server took a little while to serve. Was only checked on once in our hour there. Once she brought the check it took her almost 30 minutes to pick up my card to pay. In addition I had a gift certificate that expired August 1st which she did not take off the tab. Was too tired of waiting to argue it"}
{"text":"A bit frustrated as I do enjoy this place and the food is exactly what you expect...sports food. Burgers,chicken and beer. What seems to be the weakest link at times is the service. As I sit here and there is a handful of customers and just as many staff and still takes around 10min before I get a refill. Service needs to be on point, quit gathering around the bar and hit the floor!"}
{"text":"The whole family loved it! Hard to get in, find seating, or really get around at all but that is because of the good food, fun atmosphere. Go in knowing that and you will be very pleased. Can't wait to go again."}
{"text":"I see that Cold beers and cheeseburgers has the \"A\" team behind the bar today ! Thanks Vanessa, Dani, and  Taylor !"}
{"text":"8/12/12
Will never go back...
Straight to zero. I refuse to go to any more restaurants where I can see my server talking/texting on her cell phone while she/he is running my goddam credit card. When are you owners going to take control???!!!??? Sure, they may not be ripping ME off, but when I HAVE BEEN ripped off, this is how it happens... Take your head out of the sand and make policy... no cell phones at the POS machine... DUH - you own a restaurant. Straight to zero goes CB and CB... do not go here if if you hate risk

O"}
{"text":"Great food, fantastic beer...bad manager service. Manager on Friday night is NOT a people person and mot accommodating at all. He flexed his \"manager\" muscles simply because he had the title. Seeing as it is Friday and the grand opening was Wednesday, being this rude to new customers is not the way to go. Very disappointing. Makes miss the old Uncle Bears."}
{"text":"Should be called cold beers and cold cheeseburger. You would think that the b.y.o.b. checklist that they have you fill out would help with the order accuracy...built my own mushroom swiss burger and when it came to the table I gave it an odd look and the waitress asked \"what are you looking for? \" I said I think my burger is missing the mushrooms.  When she came back,  I also noticed that my mushroom swiss burger was missing the swiss cheese.  Instead of taking the burger back into the kitchen to melt the cheese on she brings me a slice of swiss cheese straight from the fridge.  I actually paused and thought to myself 'wtf'. She then proceeds to ask if I wanted it melted. I said \"yes please\" to which her response was \"all you had to do was ask\". Horrible."}
{"text":"This is a very reasonable place to come for lunch - IF you have time to wait. The food is decent, although nothing to rave about. Grab a burger and a brew, and enjoy, but if you're coming here and are the impatient type, or have somewhere to be, you've chosen the wrong place."}
{"text":"Great establishment to meet for lunch, watch sports, or chill after work!  Great football Sundays!

The management and staff are terrific. Super friendly. They go overboard to make you feel welcome, and want to shake your hand and get to know you personally.

GM Charles - Bartenders Gary, Kimberly, Leeandra, Nina and Chris - have all gone out of their way to make my experience exceptional. 

Kudos Guys!"}
{"text":"Let's just say they had me at \"Cold Beers\"  The name may not do this place justice and some may think it's just another run of the mill burger joint.  We have eaten here a number of times and each time surpasses our expectations.  The staff has always been wonderful the beer cold and the cheeseburgers are second to none. The Kobe burgers at some of the high end steakhouses around Scottsdale have nothing over one of these.  Don't forget to have the tots, there are none better.  Can't wait till next time."}
{"text":"Don't know why everyone is bitching about the complimentary valet parking, it was the best part of the entire experience. Middle of the road burger with bad service. Extra star for beer selection.

Alecia - specifically it shouldn't take 40 minutes at 2 pm on a weekday to get a mediocre burger. During our meal, our waitress came by our table three times - first to take order, 2nd to drop off our drink order and a third time to deliver the bill. No refills on our drinks, no \"how's your meal?\" or \"anything else?\". A different server walked around with our food and attempted to deliver it to two different tables before figuring out it was our order. We had more interaction with the parking lot valets."}
{"text":"I am so glad they CBCB chose my neighborhood to open the newest location.    The wife and boys went for the pre opening today.  Allison thanks so much for your great service.   I look forward to many more visits.    BTY the buffalo chicken tots \"outstanding\".   All the food was cooked perfect.     I especially liked the giant pretzel and cheese sauce.    It was not a beer cheese dip so it was way better.  I think the beer cheese tastes to bitter.  
Keep it coming CBCB fan for life."}
{"text":"Our Friday night visit had is waiting less than 10 minutes even though the restaurant was packed.  All three of us ordered burgers and mine was especially good.  It is much better than it sounds...the Bacon PB&J cheeseburger was as good as it was messy.  Our waitress, Hannah, was very friendly and one of the more attentive waitresses we have had in a while.  Our drinks were always tended to before being emptied and she also anticipates my sloppiness with extra napkins and a moist towelettes to cleanup.  Loved it!  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Good food and environment ... great service ... burgers tasty as well as salads... lots of beer selections... trivia Thursday night is fun"}
{"text":"The wait staff is very slow. Never came back to see if the food was good, or if I needed anything.  The food was terrible.  Cheese sticks were hard. The kids hated the mac and cheese. The grilled tomatoes were cold and disgusting.  We were out of r area and all the other restaurants were packed. I should of waited to eat. Macdonald's would have been better and I'm not a fan of their food."}
{"text":"We went there on a Friday at around 6:00 and although very crowded, got right in.  The food was good but the service could use improvement.  I'm giving it three stars for the beer selection and food.  I found a very good local beer to try.  It took forever to get our food and when it did come, they got the order wrong.  I had a Veggie Burger and ordered the sweet tots.  They brought the regular tater tots.  My husband ordered a burger with aioli on the side, but it came on the burger also...the people sitting next to us had similar issues with wrong orders arriving or not arriving at all.  The server never did put in the order for our 2nd beer and we had to ask where it was.  He didn't seem very friendly and appeared to care less.  Portions were good for the price and there was so much food that I ended up taking 1/2 home.  The happy hour prices were good also.  I'd probably go there again and try and sit with another server to see if they just had an off night or if the service is always bad..."}
{"text":"In case you can't tell from my last two reviews, my wife has her father in town from Chicago.  Because of this we have been pretty busy eating and having fun.

This is one of my wife and I's new loves.  The food is great and of the highest quality.  I know some reviews mention poor service and I would agree with that if we are talking 2 months ago.  Recently everything has been spot on and very well run.

I ordered the BYOB yesterday and I have to say it was one of if not the best burger I have ever eaten.  The cook nailed the temperature and the flavors and seasonings where perfect.

The Tator Tots they serve here are sinful.  I don't think I have had any better in my life.  My father in law ordered the Sweet Tots and said they were out of this world.

Give this place a shot, you will not be upset."}
{"text":"Food was really good. Serves not so good. Waiters was rude and seemed very bothered. My burger took over 40 minutes."}
{"text":"They have a good amount of entertainment... however, I have been here a couple times and have been very underwhelmed. My last visit, I got the cheese paper in my French dip.  I still paid for it.... I will not be going back."}
{"text":"I was so looking forward to trying this new place in central Phoenix. I finally had the opportunity this past Saturday. Man, I was highly disappointed! I ordered the BLT. When I first picked it up, my bread literally disintegrated and fell apart. The crusts came off and where my thumb barely held the bread, that spot came apart too. It was as if I punctured my thumb through the bread intentionally. The bread was stale, dry and old...hence why it fell apart. I will say the bacon tasted great though. So I proceeded to have my bacon and tomato instead of a true BLT sandwich that I had ordered. When the waitress finally came back to check on us, I showed her the sandwich. She didn't apologize at all. She said she'd call a manager over. A manager came over a few minutes later and looked miserable as can be, like he didn't want to be there. No smile, no apology, nothing. I showed him what was left of my wannabe sandwich and he said he'd give me a slight discount on my bill. Pathetic resolution. For as many restaurants as there are on 7th Street and Central Phoenix, you would think he would want to keep my business and have me come back again. He proceeded to give me $5 off my bill. Whohoo. The BLT was I believe $11 plus the onion rings I ordered were another few bucks added on. So I basically paid way too much for 3 slices of tomato and about 5 strips of bacon. Try the BLT at The Garage down the street - you won't be disappointed. Furthermore, they serve what looks like homemade chips with their high cost plates. The chips that we received had no flavor, only the top chip had any seasoning salt on it and they tasted burnt. Nasty. If you order any other side, you're going to pay extra. We could have gone to many other burger places in the area and spent half as much as we did here and had a better meal. This place is not worth the hype. High costing food, drinks and the staff clearly doesn't care about their customers or retention. Save your money and go elsewhere. There are tons of restaurants in the area that are much better and the staff is more attentive and smiling."}
{"text":"The one star is because of the food being awesome, assuming you can get served and that they haven't run out of staples like fries, tater tots, and onion rings. I'm not making this up! After waiting 46 minutes for our beers (which were never brought to our table), we decided to leave. We told the waitress why we were leaving and there was no apology given, no sorry, no nothing. Clearly, they are lacking management. Sad. The food is great but the service was non-existent. Can't believe they spent all that money remodeling, only to lose our party of 8. Wonder how many others left. As we were leaving, another table said they had been there an hour without much progress either. We went to Chipotle across the parking lot and ate without effort or hassle. Yea Chipotle!!"}
{"text":"Second time at this location and still no improvement. The wait staff is clueless and unobservant!  My lunch was $17 which was ridiculous.  The server never mentioned their house made chips in either visit and didn't inform there was an upcharge to substitute tots for fries.  Nonetheless - the CB burger texture was bad, tough like chewing.  The artisan bun - don't bother its awful.  The build your own burger get's a C at best.

Won't go to the Greyhawk location ever again.  

Too bad!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch.  Beers are cold which is nice on hot days.  I almost didn't stop because I don't eat meat but I saw they had a veggie burger that they make in house   I am told they are made fresh daily. It was good, much better than frozen Boca burgers etc.   tots were good as well.  Service was great."}
{"text":"Obviously, doing cheeseburgers well is an art form. This place always is the best and yes, the beer is cold and servers are without fail friendly and competent. I had the Thousand Island Burger and my wife had the Chicken Hawaiian Sandwich. Fries, Onion Rings and a pretzel!  And BEER!  Great place."}
{"text":"Excellent burgers tots and service. Would have grabbed a beer but I'll be sleepy enough as it is."}
{"text":"First time here, and everything was great! Huge shout out to Steve for letting us know about the mimosa deal on Saturdays and Sundays."}
{"text":"The food was not too bad, when I actually had time to eat it between swatting flies away. They have a serious problem with them, both inside and out. I understand the bar is open to the outside, but they've got to do something to deter them. Oh, and the hostess you had on staff today was completely dense. I pretty much had to do her job for her. We had a total of four in our party. There was one table open with a booth on one side and chairs on the other. We were told we'd have to wait because one of the chairs was missing. After mentioning she could just grab one from another table that is not being used, she responded \"oh yea, I could do that.\" DUH!"}
{"text":"Poor service. Server \"had never heard of dogfish head 60min\" sat at host station for 5mins never got acknowledged even though there were 2 there talking, so i sat myself. Good food."}
{"text":"Started off good, loved the grilled wings, not sure what they are now.. baked, under fried?"}
{"text":"Love pimp your burger day. Great deal, great food, great place to watch sporting events."}
{"text":"Hostess station wasn't very friendly but we like the food here so we decided to stay to eat.  Don't really understand the reason behind holding the high top tables in the bar for parties of 5 or more on game nights if you have a customer and there are tables available seat them at what is available.

Our server Andrea was very personable and definitely made up for the poor service we received from the hostess station.  The only reason for the high star recommendation is definitely because of Andrea."}
{"text":"Great place to go and hang out with friends or for a work lunch.  Once you come in a few times they get to know your orders and names fast.  So it's like cheers but fun with nice specials."}
{"text":"So many other burger joints.  I had the lineman, not bad but I wouldn't order again.  The waitress didn't explain it very well either, which didn't help."}
{"text":"Great Atmosphere , ordered the turkey burger  which unfourtanely had a  mushy texture, with an odd flavor profile. Fries are  decent, nothing to write home about. Lots of bread on that bun.  I so wanted this to be my new favorite place. Great Service though!!!!"}
{"text":"We had dinner there for the first time last night, and it was just OK.  Better its predecessor Uncle Bear's, though.  We were there at 5:00 but it still took a while to be seated.  The service was good, no complaints.   We decided to order the signature dishes, cheeseburgers and beer.  The cheeseburgers were large but not spectacular, but good enough.  The beer list was good, and we ordered some local favorites, but surprisingly they were not all that cold.  The bill was a little more than I expected, too. 

It looked like most of the patrons at the time were there with coworkers to have some beers and sandwich and watch a game, and if that's your only requirement, then CB&CB is a good place for it."}
{"text":"Bummer, we were psyched to have a new burger hang-out.  Don't bother- we waited an hour and a half (with a 7 month old to entertain) and found out that our waiter \"never turned in our order\"- Uh, what?  We won't be back.  The patio is too small and the staff is incompetent.  No go!"}
{"text":"Dani is hands down the best bartender there!!! She is not only super friendly and awesome, but she always remembers what you drink and is always on top of it regardless of how busy it is. :)"}
{"text":"My husband and I had lunch here today for the first time. We went at lunch time on a Saturday and were sat right away. The menu is full of options and we can't wait to go back to try other items. 
My husband loves spicy food and ordered the Ring of Fire burger - it did not disappoint. 
Not many items for healthy eating, but let's remember it is called Cold Beer & Cheeseburgers... 
Not an inexpensive place, but the portions are large (plenty to take home) and the food we ordered was quality. 
We enjoyed the ample TVs to watch the various college football games.
The service wasn't much to write home about, but I also can't say it was bad."}
{"text":"My favorite burger place in the world. The burger is a 5/5 hands down. They offer great customization and have a lot of unique burgers. The service however leaves a little to be desired. I often don't mind an inattentive server, I don't like to be in a rush when I eat, but they push that boundary even for me. I was also extremely dissapointed when they started adding an extra charge for French fries. IMO if you pay 12+ dollars for a burger the fries should always be included."}
{"text":"I have to update and say that after my previous review of poor service, I was contacted by their Manager Mandi who appologized and committed to send us a gift card to come back - their treat.  Today we received our $30 gift card, and will gladly come back and give CB&C another try.  

Thanks Mandi for being one of the few business managers who actually follow up.  Seems to be rare these days.  Well done. :)"}
{"text":"I've been here twice, and both times the food was great and the service... not so much.

The first time I came here was during happy hour (they have great happy hour deals), and I sat at the bar. I waited and twiddled my thumbs for a few minutes until my neighbor gave me his menu. He then started making recommendations. This gentleman should have been working there. He did a much better job than any of the three bartenders there. When I finally was able to get a bartenders attention, after being in the bar for ten minutes, I ordered a beer and an appetizer. My beer came quickly, and as should have been expected, it was the wrong beer. I tried to flag down the bartender, but that was not fruitful, so I drank it anyway. It was not very good (an oatmeal stout when I ordered a Hefeweizen). Following this mistake, my food took an exceedingly long time to come out, and having not seen the bartender in quite some time, I asked a waitress, and she informed me that there was no order in. She did this in a very quick manner which was great, even though the report was less than desirable. I told her that I did not want to order anything else, and that I was just going to finish my beer and leave. She got the manager (without my request+++), and he apologized and paid for me to get a replacement appetizer. The food was excellent, and half of the staff were excellent.

The second time I came here, I sat at a table. It took me 5+ minutes/three passes of the waitress at our dirty table before I had to raise my voice to get her attention. She apologized and came back with a towel and to take our orders. The service was very slow and the food was very good. I did not see any of the same people behind the bar as last time, and I recognized one of the new bartenders from Mill Ave. This raised my hopes for their future success, because he was a great bartender there. 

They still haven't worked out their growing pains in the front yet, but their kitchen has yet to disappoint."}
{"text":"The Pros:
Great location in north Glendale! We needed a great bar up here like this! Great selection of beers with about 30+ on tap and another 50+ in can and bottle. Service was fantastic and our waitress was very attentive. Food is awesome, try your burger with tots! 

The Cons:
Extremely noisy inside and very difficult to hear the people at your table. They were out of quite a few items on their menu, such as onion rings! Our wait was about 45 min, found out their system for notifying our table was ready didn't send our text message. Make sure you double check if you're waiting for a table!"}
{"text":"Soooo disappointed!!!! First, waited forever ( around 50 to 1 hour) for my burger. Second, mess up the orders ( how could they ever forgot couple topics for 2 burgers). Third, asked for a container took them ten minutes to bring it out. Never going to come back here ever again"}
{"text":"Man I like this place. GREAT burgers. I would never mind if one of my friends told me to meet here to watch a game. Just be ready to eat because these aren't your little sister's size burgers. These things are BIG! I will be back, and next time I won't be asking for a to go box."}
{"text":"This is a good place to have a drink if you are in the area. I've had the burgers and gourmet hot dogs and they are above average. Solid selection of draught beer and bottles, but you've likely had the majority of them already. It's a clean, well lit place, with a small patio. I'm down the street from so I'll likely hit it up here and there, but not really worth going out of your way for."}
{"text":"Amazing food
Great service
Nice environment
Variety of different sports to watch
Not messy
Would recommend over all"}
{"text":"So once again here we are at Cold Beers and Cheeseburgers.  Usually I come in with a couple of business friends for lunch and we always like it.  This evening I came here with a buddy for Buddies night out.   When we walked in we were greeted immediately by the friendly hostess and told we could choose anywhere we liked.  Within seconds of sitting down our waitress, Kim, stopped by to take a drink order and give us menus. We each ordered a beer and they were delivered promptly.  Then we each ordered a burger and fries and they came in a timely fashion.  Kim made an effort to check up often and make sure all was well.  Of the many times I have been here I must say that Kim gave us the best service ever.  I'll make sure the next time I come in that I have Kim again for a waitress.  She is the reason for the 5 stars."}
{"text":"I love this place!  Especially the manager Derek, Austin and Amanda!  My server was Kim and she is phenomenal!  I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a good neighborhood spot to hangout.   Everyone is wonderful!!"}
{"text":"Awwww and thanks for nothing Alecia! The bar is still over priced and the food (again) is waaaay sub par. Probably have a chat with your, dare I say laughably, chef. Seriously ha ha. But servers are still nice though. It could've been just a one time fluke, but then, no. Just overpriced crap being shoveled to the next....ugh I can't even go on.
Do society a favor and don't even go here people. There are waaay better places to get your drink on. Did I mention the servers are kinda nice? Lol."}
{"text":"I met a friend here to watch football. I was a little worried based on the service reviews but our experience was excellent! Our waitress was friendly and kept our beers coming. The food was great and there were TVs everywhere. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Service was a bit rushing and not very professional.   Our waiter was training someone and was a bit pushy and rushed us.  We would have purchased more but customer service is so in need here.  It doesn't hurt to every now and then have a refresher in customer service."}
{"text":"This place has either gotten rid of old management or had a come to jesus moment because its done a complete flip from previous experience.  Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"Wow... Bad.. Have been here several times and the only thing that is consistent is the beer (hard to mess that up). Food has come out under cooked, soggy, quality is poor and the kitchen service terrible. Go spend your money else where if you plan on eating."}
{"text":"Wanted to try this place for a long time now and didn't know this location existed. Didn't want to drive to Scottsdale and deal with parking and traffic. 
Great location complimentary valet!
Huge bar inside lots of seating and large patio area also. 
I have been there 2 times now and it's good every time. The burgers are delicious and they have a huge selection of beers.
You can BYOB and choose from a variety of toppings. 
Great place, great food, and great service!"}
{"text":"I like the concept but the food is just ok.  

The soft pretzel appetizer was a sad sight.  A big doughy odd colored mess brushed with butter and what seemed to be regular table salt.  Cheese dipping sauce?  Ok if you say that's what that was I'll believe you.

Tried the truffle burger, the truffle flavor is off and it becomes almost sickening by the end.  Bacon blue cheese burger was better than the truffle but not much (kind of greasy).  I thought the meat was a little cheap too, tough and chewy in spots.  Tater tots were delicious.

A true 2.5 but I'll give them a .5 for crispy tots and for the concept in general.  Just get better CBC and become a solid go to spot for those of us that live up in this area."}
{"text":"** Should I be surprised that no one from this establishment responded to my review?! No!\"  Our first visit today and a huge disappointment. I realize we went there from the Arizona Cardinals game but the Manager should have been prepared for the crowd. After we placed our order and 35 minutes went by, we asked our servicing bartender what the status of our order was and she said they were backed up in the kitchen 45 mins. So I nicely said to her I understand it is not your fault for the order back-up but as a courtesy to your customers you should have come to let us know why it was taking so long. She cut me off and said \"I've been a bartender for 10yrs and I know how to treat my customers\". She then never went to check on our order. Instead she went to her Manager, pointed at us, gave us a disgusted look and the Manager Scott came over. He apologized and said \"their cooks were like a ballet and had to learn how to dance with each other\". He said he would go check our order and he did not come back, I had to flag him down again and he said I'm comping your entire meal and said it would still be another 15mins. The original bartender completely avoided us, no eye contact and started talking to the other bartenders about us and pointing at us. I had to flag Scott down again and asked him \"so if our original bartender will not service us can you please refill my husband's Diet Coke and I will have another soda water. And who will be our bartender\"? He said I'll get someone else to service you. No one ever came. It took an hour and 15 minutes to get a regular hamburger and Mac n Cheese. There were other customers that came in well after us who received their food before us. There was even another couple who received a duplicate order before we received ours!  There was another couple who we noticed were treated poorly by the same bartender and they went nearly through the same experience as us. I realize we're just \"simple people\" to this establishment but word of mouth can dangerous. It was apparent the Manager Scott was way over his head and they are not prepared to handle big crowds. They get a big F in customer service. I will be writing a letter to Four Peaks as well."}
{"text":"Bartender Kristen knows her beers, awesome food and great place to catch a game. No reason this place should be below 4 stars. Great service, friendly staff!! Awesome beer selection."}
{"text":"Place is very loud... Too loud. Cannot hold conversation with anyone at your table. On Monday there was a special Suns event with 2 guys having an interview that was so loud you could not understand 1 word. It was awful."}
{"text":"Just our second time in, we decided to go during happy hour.  When we sat down the hostess gave us menus. We didn't see any mention of happy hour items so we asked our waitress if it was happy hour. She said yes and went to get us a different menu. Seems we shouldn't of had to ask.  I'm sure plenty of people didn't even know it was happy hour.  When our server took our order I ordered the All American Burger ($8) on the happy hour menu. She then asked me what side I wanted and listed off the choices. I got a salad. My husband ordered the same thing.  The food came out fast and really no complaints here.  The burger was good. When the bill came we were a bit miffed that the salads were additional $2.  Seems she could have said the burger comes with chips but we could sub another side for an additional $2. We had no problem paying the extra $4 for the salads it's just the way she casually asked what side we wanted totally insinuating that the burger comes with any of the sides she mentioned for the advertised price.  Certainly not a deal breaker, we didn't complain, it was just annoying.  I don't like to go to dinner and leave annoyed..."}
{"text":"No idea that the day before Thanksgiving would be busy???  You sent out marketing material to come out on Thanksgiving Eve...  3 waitresses, half full restaurant (inside and out) 45 minute wait.  No thanks."}
{"text":"Several local brews on tap.
Great people.
You need to try the peanut butter and jelly burger.
Just try it and thank me later."}
{"text":"Finally a place that ensures Uncle Bears is a place to be forgotten. 

So we start with forgiving the owner for the giant Red and White flag in the front. It is sort of like wearing the UT color and horns as well...it is like a big old badge of \"too dumb to know any better\". But roots are roots...look at Baltimore. Roots sets society back more than 100 years.  Forgive and forget, right?

Let's start with greeting by the beautiful hostesses. Been to this place 4 times now...the place is always busy but we have never had to wait for a table. Really like that!!!

Burgers are phenomenal. Beer selection is even better. Waitresses are at the top of their game...oh and you can catch any game there from any angle. Watch out for the side of sweet potato tots...for a couple of bucks they would happily satisfy a table of 4 to 6. 

This is my favorite place to get a burger...it should be yours too!!!!"}
{"text":"Been wanting to try this place for a while so I decided to stop in.  Right away I notice all the tv's and games on.  Already loving it.  Took my seat and was greeted by a gal named Kim.  Wow!!  She was a looker!  This place is getting better.  Kim went over all the beer offerings and answered all my menu questions.  I went with the Juicy Lucy and fries.

Kim had my order out in no time and the burger did not disappoint.   And the fries were some of the best I have had.  Kim delivered a second beer to round out the meal.

Overall great experience.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"Great choice of Beer...wish they had more porters and stouts. Had the sliders...very good."}
{"text":"I have been to the Scottsdale location many times and this Gilbert location does not measure up.  FLIES FLIES FLIES!  This is South Gilbert you can't open up half the wall.  There were flies everywhere it was disgusting.  The waitress even mentioned how much of a problem it is.  Food took forever and did not taste the same as the Scottsdale location.  I will not be going back to this one."}
{"text":"Always very nice and fast service. Food is great and comes out hot in huge portions. Make two meals out of the Mac and cheese or split. Also try the sweet tots. We go here all the time and have never left disappointed."}
{"text":"We're not big beer drinkers so I can't attest to the beer selection. If you are looking for beer reviews . . . this isn't the one for you.

The restaurant came as quite a surprise to me . . . upscale North Scottsdale and the name \"Cold Beers & Cheeseburgers\" didn't seem to fit the area. Nevertheless, Hubby and I had read about the Make Your Own Mac & Cheese and were instantly intrigued.  I personally have been a fan of all mac & cheese, even the Kraft box cheese, since I was a kid, but now with all the gourmet versions available, I've become quite a mac & cheese snob. CB2's mac & cheese didn't cut it for me or my hubby. It is a nice sized portion to share, even as just a side.  It was creamy, but bland . . . made with what appeared to be wide egg noodles instead of actual pasta noodles. The base cheese is very mild pepperjack and provolone, so we added some swiss and gruyere.  Still not flavorful enough. So we packed it up and brought it home, doctored it up and ate it the next day for lunch.

My husband had the Bacon Blue Burger.  It was good, but he has had much better, even at BluBurger Grill. Because the burger is so tall, they bring it with a steak knife . . . you really do have to cut it to eat it. I had a grilled cheese sandwich . . . it was pretty decent, although if they messed something like this up, they would have received one star.

Both our main courses came with a side . . . we chose the sweet tots. They were good, but not as delicious as the sweet tots from Tryst Cafe. If you love those, these will surely disappoint. 

The gentleman who took our order and ran our food was delightful and helpful, as were the other food runners in the restaurant. The restaurant is clean, fast and provides plenty of entertainment with a dozen plasma screens running mostly sports. The clientele ran the gamut, from older couples to families with kids."}
{"text":"Burgers weren't good for the following reasons:

Bread wasn't fresh, burger was over Cooked and my boyfriends was cold. For the price, definitely wasn't worth it. Is rather go to 5 guys. Was dissapointed ."}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to give them a try and I figured they'd been open long enough to work out the kinks so this experience should be good. It was Saturday night and a 1 hr wait but we were lucky (or unlucky) to get two seats at the bar. That was the best part of the evening. It all went down hill from there:(

First, the service was horrible. The bartenders couldn't go out of their way to ignore you any more if they tried. It took almost 20 minutes to order a drink and they really didn't seem that busy. My beer was fine but the glass of wine my wife ordered was sour and she asked for a different kind. That in itself took another 15 minutes. We were so hungry by this point we decided to skip any appetizers and just order. My wife did the BYOB with a side of The Staple Mac & Cheese and I ordered the 1000 Island Burger with a slide of Parmesan Truffle Fries. 

45 minutes later when the food arrived both burgers were cold and though we ordered them medium-well they were both rare. Like ice-cold in the center rare. Disgusting! The Mac & Cheese tasted like over cooked egg noodles in flavorless cheese water. What a joke! My 1000 Island burger came with NO 100 Island. It's in the name of the burger...how do you forget to put on that key ingredient. Finally, the Truffle Fries tasted like cheep frozen supermarket fries and we ate only a small portion of them. 

We looked for someone to complain too and since our bartender was ignoring us we turned to another one who then forwarded the complaint to the other bartender who then turned to the manager to discuss it. This all took about 20 minutes while we sat watching this soap opera play out. It actually became extremely comical. The manager (didn't catch his name since he didn't introduce himself but he's the short, portly guy with a scruffy beard and glasses) acted clueless when he reluctantly had to approach us and asked \"so how is everything\" and made us explain it all again. He made us feel like idiots. Like we were just a huge pain in his @ss. He asked \"so what do you want me to do?\" We said take the food off our bill since we didn't eat it and we don't want anymore. I'll pay for the alcohol but that's it. He said OK and stormed off. 

After another summit with the bartenders and 10 more minutes we received the bill that still had the skunked glass of wine on it. After waiting patiently for the bartender to return she had the manager take that glass of wine off and we could finally get out of there.

The service is the worst you'll ever have. The food is poor quality and won't be prepared to your liking. They'll simply ignore parts of your order and when you complain your poor service will only get worse. The manager we dealt with has absolutely no customer service skills and no idea on how to remedy a bad experience. He only made things worse and not only will we never be back but I will tell everyone and anyone who will listen to avoid this place. There are way too many places in the area to get a better burger and a far better experience."}
{"text":"by far my favorite restaurant ever!!! i always look forward to coming here and have never once had a bad experience(: my favorite personally is the juicy lucy, trust me once you get it there is no turning back! they are also opening a bunch more locations which i am so stocked about! customer service is off the charts, waiters are educated, always a clean environment. once i took my little cousin who has peanut allergies and my aunt asked the waiter to double check which oil they use in the fryer and he was more than happy to double check.. turns out she couldn't have fries so she ordered the mac and cheese. at the end of our meal the manager came out and shook my 10 year old cousins hand and introduced herself and was calling my cousin by her full name then proceeded to give her a coupon, due to feeling bad about the allergy.. if that doesn't tell you what kind of restaurant this is, i don't know what will!"}
{"text":"Food was good.  Service okay.  Hangover burger was nice.  Beer could be s little cheaper."}
{"text":"If you love burgers come here! You can't go wrong with any of the burgers on the menu but my favorite is the blue cheese burger! The reason I'm giving five stars is for the amazing service I got from the bartender Tayler. She was so attentive and made great small talk. I'm definitely coming back just to sit at her bar she was awesome."}
{"text":"This is my family's favorite hamburger place. Not only are the burgers flavorfull and large, the wait staff is friendly.  Although the parking lot is often very full, it is worth your time hunting for a space."}
{"text":"Was on our way to BLD when we thought we'd try here instead. Had to wait a few minutes for them to open (arrived right before 11am), and took a patio table. Location is good and the set up for sports is amazing - TVs visible from everywhere. The only drink special was Mimosas (first one for $10, each refill for $1), which was disappointing given their extensive draft beer collection. Service was slow, but decent. Prices were higher than I thought they'd be, especially for what you get (both the burger and the portion). Shared some totchos, had a burger, had a beer. Simple as that. Happy we tried it out, but not eager to return."}
{"text":"Disappointed and mildly disgusted - we were so excited to try this place out seeing as though we can walk there from our home. The burgers my husband and I ordered were tough and mediocre at best. The WORST part - when we were finished with our meal our server came over and asked if she could take a plate off our table and give it to the table next to ours because they needed one. We were so tempted to call the health department! I've been in the restaurant business and know that whenever ANYTHING touches a table it's considered \"dead\" and should not be used. We will not be going back."}
{"text":"I contemplated not writing this, but it's actually a pretty good way to influence the quality of an establishment (IMO).

First off, this review is purely reflective of one order of food and not the staff (which was great) or ambiance (also pretty cool).  It is unfortunately about one of the most expensive burgers...The Prime Rib Burger ~$20.  I ordered it medium rare in the hopes to get at most medium or an almost tolerable medium well.  I got the worst...flavorless cardboard with plastic cheese and sandpaper dry prime rib.  It was inedible.  So much so that for the first time ever I actually refused to pay for it.  The sides were fine (tots and fries) and even my girlfriend's well done (per her request) chicken sandwich was between meh and ok.

The staff was very accommodating and offered a new burger or coupons...both which were refused.  Hell no I'm not asking a chef that already messed up for another burger...ha!  I used to work in a kitchen...I'm aware of the special sauces on second orders...no thank you.

I genuinely hope that this place improves it's flagship products so there's more sports bars that are worth going to in the area.  Cold Beers and Cheeseburgers...how do you mess up a cheeseburger!

Note...the burger had two bites and was torn in half to show the waitress how it was over cooked all the way through.

Good luck CBCB"}
{"text":"Great service at the bar.  Friendly and fast.  Great place to watch a game and have a couple!!!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately CB&C is not ready for the rush. Wait for tables is long, but will probably get better.  Sensory overload.  TV, Loud, more like a bar than a restaurant.  Not a place for a fantasy draft. Too loud to talk.  Beer selection is average for similar restaurants.   Was out of a few when we ate.  Wait food for food is way too long (over an hour).  They need to let customers know the ticket times (may increase sales per ticket with apps and booze) so you can avoid the wait.  Will probably get better as they gain experience.  As for beer, was not cold.  Food. Burgers are ok, but not a $12 burger. Other options in the area have more burger options and generally less expensive.  Chips are decent.  Tots and fries are add-ons/up charges.  They are Average, Not bad, but average when considering cost.  May go back, but competition in the area provides options."}
{"text":"Live 5 minutes walk  finally made it here, shoulda waited longer
Sat for twenty minutes, waiter was friendly when she took order, food for 3( burgers medium rare) took 45 minutes to get to table, all three were wrong, undercooked , over cooked, incorrect, missing items

Mangers response, I don't know why those two guys are in the kitchen alone!! He doesn't know, well that sucks

This is a place that has an item on the menu for you to order a beer for the kitchen after their shift, maybe you should be able to order them a recipe book

Skip this place at all costs"}
{"text":"Always have a great time here. As advertised, beer is ice cold and the cheeseburgers are great. Our server, Vanessa, was awesome! !  She was very attentive without being over bearing, great job. We come here a few Fridays a month and will be back."}
{"text":"The end of an era for me.  I have been to the CB&CB in Scottsdale and this one in Chandler, dozens and dozens of times.  This is the first time I have ever had an issue.  I was trying to set up a large party of people and simply arrange for moving two or three tables together.  I had done this many times in the past, and the staff was always respectful and helpful.  On weekends, one cannot make reservations, so I arrived an hour and a half early, and told everyone what was happening.  As my party began to arrive, we asked how we could move tables together.  We were told by our waitress, and by a manager named Derek, that there was a party getting ready to leave behind an already empty table, and we could just then grab that one, and move the two together.  So we moved to the empty table, and waited for the people there to leave.  More of our party was arriving, and having to stand and order drinks, and food, while we waited for the table to clear.  When it did, some of our party moved to the table, but we did not clear it or move the tables ourselves, as we had been instructed that the staff would do that.  In short, it never happened.  All the tables were filled, and no staff ever came and most of my party spent the time standing and expecting something to happen, that was never going to happen.  I finally talked to a manager, who explained to me as though I was an infant, that the tables could not be reserved.  When I told him we were doing what we were instructed to do, he offered to throw me out.  The gathering ended up being 20 persons or so, and CB&CB made some pretty good money.  In all fairness, the place was full, and people were parked illegally all over the parking lot.  They do a big business, and my little problem was just a distraction for the staff.  I, however, will never set foot in any of the chain's locations ever again.  They will miss me, or anyone who asks me for my opinion of the place very little, since they obviously don't need the business."}
{"text":"Been here a few times, trying to like it more than I do, but it's just so so. Burgers are good, some rather creative choices like the Mac 'n Cheese Burger and the Juicy Lucy, and they're keeping up with what seems to be a more and more popular trend of Tater Tots or Sweet Potatoe Tots or \"Sweet Tots\" as they like to call theirs.  Everything I have had has been good.  Maybe it's the fact that it seems to take too much time, and I have to listen to one staff members hang over stories to another and what bar are they going to tonight after work.  Maybe it was during each of the 3 times they came by to ask me how my meal was, my mouth was completely full, but somehow I got the point across that it was fine.  Not that the meal changed in the next few minutes or so, but they still wanted to know if it was still fine, and again.  I finally pointed to my full mouth until he needed his head that he understood.  Pet Peeve of mine, Over Service is just as bad as Under Service.  Good Food, Great Beer Selection, and Lots of TV's for such a small place."}
{"text":"We were referred to this establishment by an associate, and I now owe him a huge thank you! We were greeted as soon as we walked in the door, and we elected to sit at the bar, which is quite huge. When I say huge, I'm speaking a rectangular shaped bar with very long sides. The back side of the bar is actually outside, so the patrons on that side have their backs to the covered patio, which is also quite spacious. There are numerous TV's throughout  the venue, which is great for sports programs.

Once seated, we were immediately greeted by the bartender, who informed us of both the daily and happy hour specials, and had our drinks in front of us in no time. My wife and I both decided to get burgers and share a side of mac n cheese as an appetizer. The menu actually has several options for Mac n cheese.  I can tell you that the \"small\" portion we chose to share for $5 was actually quite generous, and very, very yummy!

The burgers were prepared perfectly to our request for medium well, and the 1/2 lb patties were quite large. Our bartender, Vanessa, was spot on, and checked back with us frequently. Her service was top notch, so kudos to her!

We will most certainly be back to Cold Beer and Cheeseburgers soon, as our first impression couldn't have been any more positive. 

Also, FYI, if you check in on your Yelp app, you will receive a 10% discount promotion for your first check in!"}
{"text":"So I've been to this location a couple of times and never really been to satisfied. I continue to go here because it's close to my house and I can walk there and walk home. I liked this place a lot better when it was an Uncle Bears. Lately I've been craving a good black and tan drink, for some reason no body at this location can make one. Alright I get it your bartenders are not that experienced, I will give you the benefit of the doubt, but don't come up to me and hand me a dark beer with no tan with a smirk saying \"better luck next time this will have to do\". At least have the kindness to say \"hey we cannot do that would you like something else\" Now I still payed for the drink and drank it, but sadly it's not what I wanted. I mean don't tell me \"okay black and tan coming right up\" and bring me something other than a black and tan.
        That's not the only reason why I'm upset about this place, my wife and I came here on St. Paddy's day about an hour before close (10pm is when they close), we got seated immediately, awesome right. My wife ordered the Rib dip with Coleslaw, we did not get that order, and she ordered a Margarita......never showed up. We left with neither of our desires. We payed we left, we've been to this location countless number of times and never has been as good as uncle bears or nearly close. Food wise and beer wise their good, don't expect much more."}
{"text":"Ok...I was a bit nervous about buying a Local Dines coupon to go to this place because of the inconsistent (mostly bad) reviews...but I bit the bullet because my husband likes burgers and I like date night with my husband.
Before we got thru the door, one of the employees greeted us with enthusiasm.  We picked a table with good view of the sports events on the t.v's.  (This date night was all about my hubby).  They have his favorite beer on tap (Blue Moon)  They have a good selection of other beers for me to choose from (I chose Modus Hopirandi based on the servers suggestion and a small taster).
Our server was Fabulous.....she knows the menu, she knows the beers, she's enthusiastic about the product. Where whas she in the previous reviews that state bad service?  I don't know but I'm glad that she's there now.  
My husband ordered his burger Medium Rare due to other reviews talking about overcooking...it was medium rare. Just Right.
I had the buffalo chicken sandwich with the sweet potato tater tots.  Exactly as described and Yummy.  (I hate it when the food doesn't match the description on the menu).
Okay, the bun was a bit dry and tasteless...there are much better buns available out there...but the contents were well cooked and presented as described.
We also ordered the Buddah mac and cheese and it is delish.  More to have for tomorrow's lunch.
Thank you CBSquared for not not dissapointing us on our first date night to your burger spot....we'll be back...good service, good value, food as described, no surprises and really Good Beer List."}
{"text":"Amazing burgers and honestly a solid menu outside of the meat and bread. Really cold beer and a decent selection. I'll be back here again!"}
{"text":"Check any and all to go orders before you leave.
Ordered Mac and cheese burger w/ bacon.
Got home; drum roll please.......NO bacon.
Will pass on this place, can't get their sh&t in one sock."}
{"text":"We met friends there last night. The drinks were great, the happy hour prices made them even greater. Food was on point. Fresh.  Our waitress was awesome."}
{"text":"The worst servce of any restaurant in the area. We have given it several chances knowing that it is new but nothing has changed in the past 3 weeks. Food is OK, but it takes a while for it to arrive, not worth the wait. We will not be returning...ever! Nosh is much better when it comes to service and food quality."}
{"text":"Used Groupon for our first visit. We were impressed with the burgers. Cooked perfectly, good bun and tots. Will be back."}
{"text":"My husband & I decided to go to Cold Beer & Cheeseburger tonight. It was awhile since we have been here. We had good experiences in the past. Unfortunately tonight was just ok. Our daughter got the Mac & cheese and it was delicious. Our thousand island burger however was super salty and they used a poor excuse of 1000 Island sauce. They dabbed s little flavoring to mayo and pass√©d it off as the dressing. Shame on the chef. Wasn't too happy about the quality tonight. Probably won't be back for a long while."}
{"text":"Second review this month.  A friend who considers himself a burger expert called this morning to try this new restaurant in Chandler.  I told him we tried it a few weeks back and it wasn't all that good...but he insisted, so we went.  Having already tried a burger, I decided to try the french dip this time.  The french dip was really good, very flavorful and easy to eat...however my burger-expert friend was as disappointed with his cheeseburger as we were back on 3/1...saying the bun was way too thick and the meat was flavorless...not a good combination for a restaurant with the word BURGER in it's name.  The place is still attracting good traffic, so we hope they read these reviews and improve their burgers to justify their high price ($12 - $16)."}
{"text":"The food is always good and tasty, but with a name like cold beer and cheeseburgers, I expected the 'cold' beer selection to be a little better.  The first two I ordered were not in stock and the bartender told me they don't have a lot of what is on their menu.  He also mentioned to me how much $ they spent on their menu sign which I thought was a little unorthodox.  

I finally got the Pilsner draft and was very shocked to see that less than a pint was $6.  Now, I am no expert, but that just seems unreasonable to me.  It came in a little circle glass and I know it wasn't a full glass like you would get at any other establishment.  It has been a while since I have been and I don't remember the drinks being so much $ or them not having what they list on their menu, however, the food is incredible and I try a different burger each time I go.  I will definitely be back for the food, but if you are going to have a drink, my suggestion is to get your booze somewhere else.  

Cold Beers and Cheeseburgers, at least for now, gets half of that equation right.  I will be back to try another one of their succulent creations."}
{"text":"Good food and cold beer! Wait times are too long, food isn't that great to wait so long. Good place to catch the football game though, lots of tv's."}
{"text":"One of the best cheeseburgers around. I had the American cheeseburger and oh my gosh, so good. Juicy and Messy!! The horseradish is the bomb. Great with fries. The service has been really good -  I can't complain. Even though the burgers are fresh and tasty,  I would have given 5 stars but I do believe they are a bit pricey to go out and grab a burger, Yes I know Gourmet  Burger, but still..."}
{"text":"The food was good but the service... good god it's so fricken slow. Our server Andi was terrible and left us sitting at our table waiting for the check for over 20 minutes. Also be sure to bring cash if you want to tip the free valet because the ATM costs $3.50. I would haven given more stars if it weren't for the amazingly slow waitress."}
{"text":"We moved to the neighborhood a while ago and have been wanting to try it. We finally went last night because of a coupon in the local mailer. 

I really had higher hopes for this place, especially because it was so busy (a 30 minute wait on Friday night), but my husband and I were just disappointed. 

Both of our burgers were over cooked and under seasoned. The avocado I paid extra for was just in a clump that fell off the burger, not sliced and distributed across the burger. And if you wanted any side other than chips, it was a $2 up-charge over the already $12-$15 burger. $38 (pre tip) for two burgers (one with fries and one with onion rings) and two waters, thank goodness for our coupon! 

Service was also super slow. I understand it's Friday night and you are busy, but they seemed under staffed. If we had been there with kids and had somewhere else to get to, it would have been much more frustrating than date night and spending the time with my husband. 

For burgers, I would have been happier to have a date night at In N Out, or for a local place, Blue32. 

But, we didn't drink last night. If we ever go back, it would be to share an app and try some local beers with friends, since we live close enough to Uber over...but not for the cheeseburgers ever again."}
{"text":"The burgers were juicy and good. The service by Hannah was excellent.  The restaurant  and bathroom were clean. Overall very good experience."}
{"text":"Started off with valet on a Tuesday night.  It irks me that they make you valet when a parking lot is empty.  The hostess has no personality whatsoever, like she couldn't be bothered to do her job.  I'm miserable many days of my life at my job, but still, I have to show up and appear to give some sort of interest.  Ordered the tot chos, two burgers medium, and two sodas.   The waitress took our orders, delivered our drinks, and that was the last we saw her until she dropped off the check.   No \"how's your meal\", no refills on the drinks.   The wait staff just walked by staring at our empty cups and kept on walking if you tried to stop them.  The tater tots were cold and old, but at least the chili sauce and cheese sauce were warm.  The burgers were meh.  One was well done, the other was raw.  Not rare, but brown on the outside, red, white and stringy raw on the inside.  The bun was stale as well.  The best part of the meal was the potato chips (fortunately I did not spend the extra $3. for a side of fries as a substitute).  For the $50. we spent on dinner, was definitely not worth it.  If you want sub par service or  mediocre cafeteria food, this is your place.  Definitely won't come back, especially with all the other edible options in close proximity."}
{"text":"Great food at not such a bad price. Love the beef chili mmmmac n cheese. Add a small portion of buffalo chicken to it and its amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Waitress was very nice, food was very average, atmosphere was slightly nicer than a Buffalo Wild Wings.  Paid $2 extra for fries as my side with my French Dip, they forgot to bring them to the table with the meal. I was done with my meal by the time I was able to alert the waitress. She apologized, but only delivered a half order of fries, saying they didn't have enough but could bring the rest out later. I said no, but was charged for the fries anyway. It's a small courtesy to not charge in such a situation that most restaurants get right, but this one did not."}
{"text":"I have been twice ... I want to like this place but it has some flaws..   the first outing was good but the service was spotty...  burgers were tasty and the wings were good.  The Mac and cheese was forgettable.  Second trip felt like a different place....  the wings were completely  different than both the previous visit and the Scottsdale location...   inattentive service and lack of caring when we pointed oit out tthe inconsistencies in the wings.    To make matters worse there is a sewer smell.on the back patio !   Tees with \"Show me your tips\" not original or clever. My girlfriend has barred me from returning."}
{"text":"Just tried this place for the first time.   The food was excellent.   So if you're solely going for the food I would suggest this place.  The service, ehhh.   We sat down a few minutes before 7., and since the menu is limited to burgers we ordered at about 7:00  We got our food at 8:10.   This is usually a deal breaker for me.  Great food, disappointing how long it took.  But i'd give it another try, they can't be that slow all the  time."}
{"text":"I love very spicy food, and cheeseburgers. So whenever I see a spicy cheeseburger, I am all over it. Despite this, I have never had what I would call a spicy burger. The fat in the meat and cheese diffuses the heat. 

Finally had a really spicy burger, and - yes - love it. The Ring of Fire was truly hot, but not painful, with bright flavors from the lightly grilled jalape√±os and buffalo-style sauce blending well with the smooth notes from the good quality beef. Was delicious

Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Have been here 3 times since they opened.  Every time it's a bit of a wait but the food has been delicious  every single time.  We've tried the majority of the burgers and they are all really good.  The service has also been great.  We will continue to visit this place.  Im so glad they opened up so close to home!!"}
{"text":"We really like the other location in Chandler, but this location in Gilbert was a huge disappointment.   The food is just not right - felt nauseous after.  I heard similar results from others who went on different occasions.  Might be poor food handling (spoilage), bad management, or they may get poor quality food from other suppliers...not sure which it is, but something is very wrong.  I hope they can figure it out, but I won't be back."}
{"text":"Great food, worst service, took 50 minutes to get food, everyone around has there food already that came in after us. Food came out and the order was wrong......$5 off my meal,...... never recommending someone to this place for simply their service or lack there of 

Hire servers who care....:/"}
{"text":"Great Burger and Ice Cold Beer.  Service has improved greatly since initial opening but prices are still a bit too high without  specials"}
{"text":"Good burgers, nice selection of beer. Not a fancy place and the service is so-so, but if you live close by, it's worth it."}
{"text":"The name says it all. Ring of Fire burger is everything it is cut out to be. Sweet Tota were cooked perfectly, crispy on the outside and yummy in the middle. Zack is the man when tending bar. Makes you feel like it was pleasure for him to serve you."}
{"text":"I enjoy the atmosphere  and fun vibe.  Service was amazing.... however, I am very discouraged  in beer sizes.  We were asked if we want a large in the beer size and of course we said YES.   I had a friend order a \"regular \" size and she did pour that liquid into one of them empty large size glasses....and guess what?!! Same amount of liquid from the large to the small.  Scam of $1.00 buck!. We were told there was a 3.5 oz difference in beer.. clearly there was not.  Not cool!"}
{"text":"I tried this place with a friend and was overall pretty happy.  I saw a few areas to improve on, and will address those too.
I had their house made veggie burger.  It was excellent.  Only suggestion on that is the bun.  It was a high quality white bun, but I'd love to have the option of a wheat bun as well (they only offer 1 kind of bun. but with so many burgers choices it only seems natural to have at least another bun option).  It came with a tasty side item, and I picked the sweet potato tots.  Very good!  
The prices are a bit steep, for a place where you wait in line to order (especially at lunch, where it is over $14 for a burger with the included side item, plus a soda , with tax).  
You'd never know a side item is included from the menu board, so maybe they can add that so the sticker shock seems more manageable when you realize you do get that bonus side item (or how about lowering the prices by $2-3 and letting me add a side item for $2-3 with purchase of a entree, but only IF I'd like to add it)?
My friend had the BYOB (build your own burger) with a basic beef patty and said it was very good.  He too thought the price was a bit steep, especially for lunch).
I'd consider going back, but I think I'd save this place for a casual dinner so my pocketbook handle it.
Place is inviting and relaxing.  Lots of TV's too (13 I think, which is amazing as it's not a very large dining space).  Only other advice is on the soda station.  Why the crushed ice?  It's small and flows too fast, filling up your cup with ice and making it hard to drink soda without a straw.  And speaking of straws, it silly how they are all gathered in a oversized cup, unwrapped, as you grab one.  Kinda gross as you end up touching other unwrapped straws to get yours.  Wrappers would be nice!"}
{"text":"We just recently tried this place and it is so good. The burgers are great and so is the mac and cheese. We will be returning for sure. The only reason this place isn't getting 5 stars is for a place by the name of \"cold beers\" I expected my beer to be COLD not some what cold, other than that we absolutely loved this place."}
{"text":"Yum!!! My husband was craving a burger after a hike today. He ordered the ring of fire (?) or something like that I had the American burger with bacon. Great burgers!! Sammy was our server and she was friendly and attentive. Love this location- perfect spot to sit outside while he weather is nice, multiple TV's on the patio too :)"}
{"text":"So it is finally official.  I have been here three (3) times, and on all occasions, the food has been overcooked, burned or just has no flavor.  In addition, several of their beers on tap (I.e. Kilt Lifter, Stella, etc.) are unbelievably stale. 
I've been to two (2) other CB&C locations and they did not fare much better.
Oh well.  I love my sports bars and this WILL NOT be one a go to in the valley."}
{"text":"Got a BYOB cheeseburger that was awesome. We sat at the outside bar and realized the place was swarming with flies. I mean they were everywhere!! Place was busy but hopelessly understaffed. All the staff were great but having only one bartender who also was running food just made no sense. Food was great but flies were disgusting."}
{"text":"Huge portions and decent prices. Definitely a place to stop if you're craving a hearty American meal."}
{"text":"Macy saved the day!  We tried to go to brunch somewhere prior to coming here and that was a disaster.   Macy was in top of everything, she was very accomodating. This was our first experience at CB&CB and she made it so delightful, we will definitely be back.  Thanks, Macy!"}
{"text":"Love the food ... burgers are super fresh and huge 
great service staff 
plenty of TVs to view your sports pics 
Great atmosphere great place to take kids family and friends any time of the day or night this is my new go to spot"}
{"text":"I'm done with this place.  We went here last year and 2 days later I got a call from my CC company that my number was compromised and I was able to narrow it down to this place.  We tried to go here last Friday but gave up after having to listen to the manager and bartender argue with a customer about his takout order.  I can't stand restaurants that argue with customers.  There are far too many burger spots popping up around town to deal with these guys."}
{"text":"Great food, cold beer and excellent service. My wife and I came here after being treated like absolute sh*t at a nearby burger joint. We were greeted promptly and had an overall fantastic experience. I recommend the TOT-chos!! And beer, of course! We will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Ambience: Walking into this establishment, its very open. You can see every part of the restaurant from wherever you are seated. I liked it. It was lunch time but I can see it being pretty cool at night. 1 star

Customer Service: Our waitress was very attentive and the food came out pretty quickly. Once again, it was middle of the afternoon so it wasn't too busy. I'd be interested to try them at night. 1 star

Food: Unfortunately, it was just ok. We ordered the truffle fries to start and those were the best part of the meal. I had the prime dip. Was kind of dry and they forgot the horseradish. Also, any of the sauces we got tasted like they came out of a jug and didn't taste homemade. I didn't like this at all. My friend got one of the burgers and he seemed to enjoy it. I won't be giving them a star for food. 

Drinks: It's a bar and they have a pretty decent selection of drinks. 1 star 

Restrooms: Here's an area I wish more establishments paid attention to. Although it's just a bathroom, they should put just as much thought and care here as they do front of house. It's your normal bar bathroom. Nothing amazing. No star."}
{"text":"Went on a Sunday night and got right in. Parking was a challenge. We both ordered pretty basic burgers and an order of wings.  The wings were good. The burgers took a long time to come out. They were cold and dry. Thought the meal was extremely overpriced for what we got. The quality was good but poorly prepared. My husband ordered the juicy Lucy and that was dry too. For 2 our bill was $60. Ouch!"}
{"text":"Great food, better service. 

If you sit at the bar, ask for Chris. Super nice guy, very accommodating. 

If you'd prefer a table, Caitlin is your girl. Spitfire who knows her stuff. 

I suggest the BYOB so you get exactly what you want. My roommate loves the PBJ Burger, he's weird."}
{"text":"I used to go to the Scottsdale location but I'm so happy they opened up a location in Phoenix! Great place to watch the game with my boyfriend and enjoy a delicious burger and beer!!"}
{"text":"Great food, service and atmosphere to enjoy a game!  Please open one in Pleasanton, CA:)"}
{"text":"Waited over an hour to get food after ordering it. Witnessed multiple parties complain and leave because the cooks took so long to cook the food. In addition the appetizer was not good at all. Unfortunately this is the second time we have been there and we won't be going back."}
{"text":"Burgers were good but not for the price. Plus we were the only family there besides maybe two or three other and we waited a very long time to get our orders in, get our food, the check, etc. The staff was nice and but there was a lot of them laughing and joking around near the bar area and it was hard to get their attention when we needed something."}
{"text":"Meh...is really all I can say about this place. I was excited to try it because I heard the one in Scottsdale was good. We ordered the buffalo dip for an appetizer and I didn't read it came with potato chips instead of regular chips, so that was different. The buffalo dip was good, definitely had a kick to it but I think it would be better with regular tortilla chips.  
I ordered the Ring of fire (I think is what it's called) burger and that was definitely spicy but was just okay. The patty was hard and overlooked. My boyfriend ordered the Hangover burger and he also said it was just okay. The burgers come with the house potato chips and if you want fries it's $2 more...ummm $2 more for fries? When this is a burger place?! Yeah that makes no sense in life....and the fries weren't even worth it. They were way too hard and salty. The prices for burgers are also super expensive and range from about $15-$18...then if you add fries you're paying over $20 for a burger and fries. Mediocre burger and fries at that. Save your money and go to The Habit. 
Any who our service was pretty good because we got there early and it was slow. 
It's a nice bar, tons of TVs but it is super loud and hard to hear people at your table. 
Overall, I was disappointed the food wasn't very satisfying and I barley made a dent in it because I didn't like it. Also the burgers are huge and I even took the top bun off and so didn't finish half the burger."}
{"text":"Was not good, because I wanted food, drinks and service. 

Arrived at 7:05. By 7:12 no one had greeted us, taken a drink order... nothing. Asked a hostess to send a server. Five minutes later... still no service. 

Left at 7:18 with no service. No drinks. No food. 

The horrific parking lot situation makes it even worse. Avoid, avoid, avoid."}
{"text":"Brought some friends from out of town here for drinks and dinner and it was fantastic! Great service and all the games were on."}
{"text":"Great food and love the atmosphere. TV's everywhere! Perfect for sports fans or families too. We got the hummus appetizer which was really good! Then all of us got a different specialty burger. My husband got the Peanut butter and Jelly bacon burger! My son loved the Juicy Lucy! It was stuffed with cheese.  I really enjoyed the American but I usually go pretty basic on my burgers.  We also loved the tots and fries. We will be back again soon for sure!"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times. The byo mac & cheese is delicious and my server June has always been a delight.. I make it a point to sit in her area."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere with all of the tv's and laid back environment. Just stopped by after they opened this location to have some beers and tried the mozzarella sticks and wings and they were pretty good with an okay sized portions. Downside is everything is overpriced from the food-beers/cocktails and my waitress didn't seem to pay much but attention to us, I had to flag her down for another beer or to order, etc."}
{"text":"We love the back fireplace and chilling here on a date or with friends.  We had high hopes when cold beers took over this location from Uncle Bears, but honestly we were super disappointed and actually prefer uncle bears food.  :(. 

The cheeseburgers meat doesn't taste that quality to me and the fries were mediocre.  If this is what a restaurant builds its name on, I'd think it would be much more quality!  I found it to be a step up from fast food burgers unfortunately.

Also, the wait times are too long for seating and the servers aren't that great."}
{"text":"Love this place, great food and cold beer!! Friendly staff and nice atmosphere!!  Favorite is grilled sandwich with sweet potato tots!! The best!!"}
{"text":"Glad I stumbled upon this place. Great place to grab a beer & cheeseburger and catch a game. Lots of TVs with all games playing. Staff is always friendly and accommodating. Place is normally quite busy with a variety of people. Only down fall for me is they don't deliver."}
{"text":"This is a great place if you you enjoy overlooked or raw undercooked burgers. Out of 4 burgers order 2 came out well done and 1 came out raw.  Over priced and over rated."}
{"text":"Saturday afternoon (yesterday)... not very busy... party of 3.  The girl behind the host station said one word to us (the word \"three,\" as in \"party of 3?\").  The \"hostess\" then grabbed menus and took off without even looking at us.  She didn't ask if we had any preference, such as indoor/outdoor or table/booth.  We followed, she put the menus in a booth and walked away.  Not a great opening impression, but we were hungry.

I wasn't timing it, but it felt like a good 10 minutes before we finally had to flag down a random employee to say that we hadn't been helped yet.  A few minutes later, our server comes to take drink orders, and, since we had plenty of time to memorize the menu, we asked her to take our food orders, too.  The drinks and food arrived in a reasonable amount of time.  After our food was delivered and everyone had left, though, we realized that there were no napkins or silverware on our table.  Again, we had to find a random employee to flag down and bring us some.

We all got burgers, and we were all satisfied, if not impressed, with the quality of the burgers.  In fact, the burgers are the only reason I added a 2nd star.  The only complaint I have about the food was the inedible amount of salt on the fries.  I love fries, but couldn't eat more than a few of these.  You can always add salt.  You can't remove it.

I live very close by, and am a fan of this franchise, so I want it to stick around.  These are easy problems to fix with a little training and accountability, so I hope they close the gaps."}
{"text":"I've been to this location twice now and honestly don't know what all the hype is about. The food is mediocre, nothing to write home about. I went once for dinner and was there for over two hours not by choice... the hostesses forgot about me and the other person I was with so that tacked on some time to our visit. In addition, we both ordered burgers and waited over an hour for them. I'm not sure if this is just to be expected as it's a busy location or what. The second time I went was early in the day for a football game and I didn't have the same problem."}
{"text":"We got our beer fast, so far that is the only good thing about this place. We have been waiting for over 30 mins for an appetizer, people who where seated long after us have received food. Poor service, was going to give this place 1 star but the food is good."}
{"text":"Really nice burger sports bar joint. There are TVs everywhere!!! 
I came today for dinner with a friend, he said this place is AMAZING! The ordering process is very easy, they have this sheets you can fill out to make your own burger. We filled them out and then they came to take our order sheets.
It took a while to get the food, but I assume that is because the food is made to order. My friend's burger was right, while mine was the completely wrong. I was missing 2of the 3 toppings I requested and my meat was medium not medium well. Had way too much pink. Needless to say I sent my burger out. 
The manager came out to defend that the burger wasn't completely wrong, it was just missing 2 items and was medium. Hmmm okay. 
By the time the right burger came out my friend was done with his dinner and I was full from the sides I ate. So I sent the second one back also. 

The manager made no attempt to make it right. In fact he tried to defend giving me a $10 discount when the burger was $12. It took 3 trips to our table to explain simple math to him. 

I wish o could comment on how the burger taste, but I can't. I know the service is terrible and I will not be back."}
{"text":"Burgers are good, food in general was pretty good. However, it wasn't amazing, and the prices are a bit high for what it was, in that type of atmosphere. And the TV's were turned up so loud we were practically yelling to talk with each other."}
{"text":"Service was ok.  Good selections of beer. But poor hosting. Food is over priced.  Food was terrible.  Bland appetizers."}
{"text":"We tried this place 3 times. The first time the burger was overcooked the second time the burger was overcooked and the other had a hair. The third time cheese sticks dry and nasty waitress super snotty. We waited over 45 minutes. We will not be back."}
{"text":"We love to go here for happy hour for Coronitas! They have a gluten free menu too.  It's a great place to watch sports with friends and eat great food. Customer service is excellent !"}
{"text":"Screwed up our order for one of our family members, had to wait for them to remake it to go, didn't take it off the bill.  Hint for future - if a family of 5 comes in to eat dinner together and one of them doesn't get to eat their meal because of your screw up it should be taken off of the bill...it's just good customer service!  Back to Blue 32"}
{"text":"The food here is excellent. It is pricey but so worth it. My kids favorite is their Mc and cheese and i love their rocky point burger. We never have to wait too long for our food and the service is always great. As a family we enjoy coming to this restaurant. Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Hmmm... Been here a couple of times since they opened. Jury is still out. Great menu and beer list! However, depending on which server you get that day, will determine what you are charged. After 5 visits, we always substitute cheese on menu yet now we are charged a fee for substituting the stated cheese. Really?? Then also bring me the cheese I paid for!

There is a drink special on Sat and Sun for mimosas with a $1 refill. Again, depending on which server you get you will either be charged $7 or $10 for your drink. ???? What??? 

Finally, the burgers.  Oh, the burgers. Out of a table of 6, FIVE of our burgers came out wrong!!! Yet we returned to give the local place another chance. Skip the chips, they are overlooked and burned most of the time. 

Wait, can't forget management... Hmmm... Bring up an issue and one manager will shrug it off and another will comp you meal!! Ask for a specific game to be on the TV facing you and while you can clearly see the guys responsible for the remote chatting it up with the staff, and have asked your waitress 3X, twenty-five minutes later they will finally get around to stop chatting and accommodate you. Not the server's fault. 

Conclusion: They need to work on training. BIG Time!!! They are definitely succeeding on location than out of service or quality of food. Unfortunately the \"newness\" of the place will wear out soon and the food and drinks will have to speak for themselves!

And in closing: Always place bar napkins when serving a wet dripping glass!!!!"}
{"text":"Good food, excellent and fast service. However, very loud! I figure it would be great if you were into sports and were in a partying mood.... but this guy is not a sports person. However, if you are in the mood for the ultimate Sports Bar, you found it. 
Televisions everywhere and a sound system to go with it. Parking is limited to a few hundred spaces and get there early because this place gets packed. 
Like I said... service is excellent and well worth checking out at least once.
Final thoughts.... don't eat the house potato chips. They are God awful and will ruin the taste of your meal. Charging $2 to split a plate because you ordered too much... unforgivable. Will I be back? Probably not....."}
{"text":"We went as a group of five and a baby. The staff was not that friendly when we arrived. It almost seemed as if we were inconveniencing them by showing up for lunch on Mother's Day. They told us about a 20 minute wait, it took about five. So that was nice. 
Our waitress was nice but didn't have great customer service either. We ordered Buffalo Chicken Tot Chos to start. They were decent, could have used more sauce as they were a bit dry.  Looking at the menu, it's not a cheap place and two things that they charge for that we thought were ridiculous were 1) you have to pay $2 to substitute the chips that come with the entrees for other sides, even though the other sides are equal or lesser value when you buy them on their own and 2) it's $2 to split an entree. Just kind of makes the place seem cheap.
The entrees that we ordered were the Steakhouse Truffle Burger, Denver Burger, Bacon PB&J Burger, Bacon Bleu Burger, and BLT sandwich, along with a kids Mac and Cheese with Fries.  The burgers were good sized. The chips were so hard and lacked flavor. For those of us that got the chips, we ate one then left the rest. It looks like that's what every other table was doing too. Seems pretty wasteful to even serve them since most people don't even want to eat the garbage. The kids Mac and Cheese was good and the fries that we ordered with that were great. 
Overall most of us liked our burgers. The Truffle burger didn't have the slightest hint of truffle flavor. Huge disappointment that it's called a truffle burger and yet there wasn't no smell or taste that read truffle. 
The good thing about going on Mother's Day was that they offered free entrees for Moms. So two of our burgers were free which saved us $28. Our meal still came to $70+ pre tip. Which is loco for five burgers, a sandwich, and kid's meal.
Will we return? Eh, maybe if they run another special. Would I recommend? Eh, I think there are other burger places I'd recommend instead."}
{"text":"I know I said this to one of the bartenders but if you sit at the bar and put your arms on the bar where the metal is and touch a laptop after a few seconds you will feel a vibrating electirical pulse or zap. Something is not grounded and it's annoying."}
{"text":"Nothing spectacular. Bar atmosphere with some outdoor seating as well. The bar has seating inside along with seating outside which looked nice.

We ordered the Buffalo dip which came with house made chips (potato chips not French fries). It was a little spicy for me but my husband and son liked it. The chips were very good though.

I ordered the stadium dog. It was tasty but I prefer the hot dogs at the actual stadium . This too came with chips and if I'd known the dip came with chips I would have substituted tator tots.

The others ordered burgers and said they were good but nothing to write home about. Those also came with chips but Nothing spectacular. Bar atmosphere with some outdoor seating as well. The bar has seating inside along with seating outside which looked nice.

Waitress was ok but didn't check in quite as often as I would have liked for drink refills.

The Michelob ultra was very cold so the \"cold beers\" in their name is accurate.

Parking was full but luckily we got a front space. It didn't seem like the restaurant was all that busy so maybe the parking lot was full of people using it for the other businesses nearby.

A little on the pricey side especially since it wasn't anything special.  We probably won't be back only because we have other places we prefer for hamburgers."}
{"text":"I think the food is really good here! I'm surprised at the less than stellar reviews. It almost seems like people are being overly picky. This place is new and had a few kinks to work out but I've been more than a few times since they have opened and they improve their service and quality every time. They have a lot of options and their burgers are amazing. People need to learn to sit back, relax, and enjoy the atmosphere (even if it is loud, like, really!?! It's a cold beers and cheeseburgers type of place with a lot of sports fans. Chill out, losers.) I'll keep coming back for more. I'm sick of the bland chains that keep popping up in the area. I'm glad we got somewhere worth going to!!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! It's mine and my wife's favorite Wednesday date night location. With a $12 unlimited toppings build your own burger we are in heaven. Not to mention the staff is always so kind and attentive."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the sports bar atmosphere, still better and less quiet than your typical Buffalo Wild Wings. I have been here twice now and they have a great selection of food and beers.

The burgers are a bit pricy (average $14) but they are big and come with potato chips or you can sub for fries.

Their table s'mores are fun, again a bit pricey at $10 when you can buy these ingredients at the store for much cheaper, but it is a fun idea to split with friends or on a date."}
{"text":"My wife and I visited here last night for the second time. The first time was on my birthday last month. So far, they are 2 for 2! The staff are super fast, very friendly, accurate, attentive and fun! The food is always delicious and very well seasoned. It's also always cooked just right, which is important. It's a very clean, very open, very awesome location. Prices are great as well. I highly recommend taking a trip and checking it out!"}
{"text":"First time here. Great location, nice vibe in the place. Great selection of beer and food. 
Food was very good, but someone has a heavy hand with salt.  Drinks great. 
Music was pretty good when we got here, but went way down the urban trail. Like, I'm not coming back here urban. Then it got better. Unless they want to scare away anyone over 30, playlist needs tweaking.  
Service was A+."}
{"text":"I had lunch here today with my daughter and husband. At her prompting, I am writing a review.  The place was crowded, the music was way to loud, it is definitely a sports bar with wall to wall  TV's. The service was not bad, but not good enough to say it was good either. The food was good, the onion rings were very tasty and my husbands burger was pretty good, my chicken salad was pretty good, and my daughters chicken sandwich was pretty good. I thought the food was a bit pricey for being just another sports bar with burgers. There really isn't anything here to give it a claim to fame. It's new, and clean but in my opinion, for the price, it needs a little wow factor."}
{"text":"Great wait staff. Helpful and friendly. Excellent burger. Cooked medium rare. Toppings were very good.  Artisan bun perfect. We shared a Cobb salad. Fresh ingredients. Did not have beer. Would come back for burgers and beer.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"It's a nice sports bar, food is decent and service is good. Definitely a good spot to watch a game but plan ahead, there's usually a wait for a table!"}
{"text":"I think it's the only restaurant on this side of town that worth going to because there's always a wait but it's well worth it, the food is always cook to the perfect temp."}
{"text":"It's too bad their service is so bad because their burgers are so good! This used to be my favorite burger restaurant. We've been here several times and it gets worse every time. It takes 15 minutes to get a drink and usually over an hour for a burger. Not to mention the staff is rude. We won't be coming anymore."}
{"text":"Had a coupon to use. Presented it to the server to ensure it was applicable and what restrictions apply. 
Needless to say, even though I asked the server to take the coupon prior to ordering, and their refusal to take the coupon, we ordered.
Coupon turned out to be restrictive as to time of service.
Friends we took to take advantage of the coupon didn't work out for us
Similar thing happened earlier in the week
That will be our last visit

Update: I did send an email as requested. Guess what? No response!!
Good bye then

Updated update

Once again asked for my email , sent, no response
Don't fall for it!"}
{"text":"Great burgers and home made chips but why are the buns always stale?
I've been to Gilbert location twice and voiced my stale bread issue to the waitress the second time. 
No luck, stale again. 
Maybe I'll bring my buns next time"}
{"text":"Me and my husband decided to try this out for his birthday on a friday night, and we LOVED IT. The atmosphere was loud and energetic and the burgers were incredible. I got the bacon bleu and he got the steakhouse truffle! Its a little steep in price, but that's to be expected because the burgers are gigantic and have so much on them! Hands down best burger I've ever had. Also should mention our waitress was super nice. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Second visit it was fantastic! I typically will pass on burger joint and opt for just about anything else. But after my first visit I was very impressed loved the quality and taste of the food so I had to come back and try it again. They have an awesome deal on Wednesday for a build your own burger with unlimited toppings, it is a great deal! Amber was our server today and see was excellent very friendly and accommodating, thank you for the great experience."}
{"text":"This place was packed. Was quoted a 30-35 minute wait, but ended up being sat within 10 minutes. Service was okay, not exceptional. Location is prime though. Especially a great place to have a patio with outdoor seating AND big screen TVs for watching sports! All in all, I am very happy to have a new sports bar in this area."}
{"text":"They have a large selection of burgers, but their main ingredient seems to be salt. Also the service was very slow even though we were seated right away. Our waitress seemed to be running to a lot of tables but it took almost an hour to get our food. But the food was pretty good and I'd probably go back due to geographic convenience to my house."}
{"text":"Pretty good burger! Good beer selection & happy hour prices. We shared the Juicy Lucy - it was cooked just right and had nice gooey, melty cheese inside that oozed out when we cut into it. We had the tater tots which were really good. Love when they are cooked just right and come out perfectly golden brown and hot and crispy all around. While the quality seemed ok it lacked a bit of flavor. Had to season it pretty good with salt and pepper - but that can go both ways. I do like to season my own food so that wasn't a deal breaker for me. If or when we are back in the area we'd stop in again."}
{"text":"Great place to grab a couple of beers, decent food. It gets pretty crowded on weekends, especially on Sundays so there's likely to be a wait. Nice patio, wish they had a smoking section."}
{"text":"They took away the dog patio that uncle bears had but the blue cheese burger I had their the other day put this place back on the map. Delicious!"}
{"text":"Very happening sports bar... the prime rib dip sandwich was great. The burgers below average. We had the buffalo chips and loved them. But the buffalo chicken egg rolls were our fav!"}
{"text":"Have had good and bad experiences there. The hotdogs are great. The burgers tend to come out undercooked. Last time I was there the burger was actually raw in the middle. They also use pickled jalepenos instead of fresh cut which is not my preference. Still a good place to drink some very cold beer."}
{"text":"The service and atmosphere was wonderful and the food was very good but two of our orders came out completely wrong. There was 5 in our group and two people had ordered the BYOB-build your own burger. They both came out with only lettuce and tomato and missed all of the toppings that were ordered. The waitress was very nice and brought all of the toppings separately. Other than that I'd definitely recommend coming here! Portions were very nice sizes. Next time we visit Phoenix I'm sure we will be stopping back."}
{"text":"Great Beer, Food and Service.  TV set up is Elite for any place!   Always a Repeat!  Kimberly is a terrific bartender!"}
{"text":"Staff was very good but the food was terrible.  My wife and I both had hamburgers.  The hamburger was below average and the bun was downright pathetic.  Ordered onion rings and they left a lot to be desired.  It is disappointing because the bar and location have a great layout.  Hopefully they improve the quality of the food."}
{"text":"Everything is great here.  Love the cobb salads, burgers, and chilimac dog!  Wednesdays are great where you can load on as many toppings as you want to your burger for $12!  When we want a great burger, we come to CBC!"}
{"text":"Ugggg....where to start. This is the second time we have tried this restaurant. Both times, same issues! Ordered food as a group, but that plates were brought out individually, from first plate for last plate was a difference of 20 minutes. Notified waitress as well as bar staff, got comped one meal but would have preferred to eat all together. Seems like things haven't changed. Disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"Recently went here again (adults only this time) and it was a little better experience. I can't put my finger on it but there's something about this place that just doesn't sit right.. out food was okay, the sweet potato tots were as usual the best part. I shared the pb and j burger and the Buddha Mac n cheese and both were okay but not mind blowing. This place is always busy and can be hard sometimes to grab your waiters attention. But having a drink this time I like that the have the deep eddy brand of vodka and recommend it to anyone looking for a delicious cocktail."}
{"text":"Actually really impressed with this place! Cheeseburger sliders were great and more than enough food even came with fries! Ordered the truffle fries which were very nicely done.. Not too Greasy and a sizable portion. My husband ordered the Mac and cheese burger which looked fantastic.

Services was ok. Bit slow. They actually ran out of the beer we wanted which seems a bit ironic.

But we will be back for sure! Want to try the happy hour during the week which goes till 7!"}
{"text":"Yum! Cold Beer & Cheeseburgers is good for exactly the title. They have a build-your-own hamburger option which was excellent for me as I'm a pretty picky eater. We were sat quite fast and the service was good. The Scottsdale location is awesome as well. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Food...just ok.  Many burger options but quality of cuisine left me wanting more. House chips were ok but under-seasoned.  Appetizer adoptions...fried, fried, and more fried.

Beer...great selection including the best local brews.  Two thumbs up here.

Atmosphere...typical sports bar.  Plenty of room and tvs.

Service...overall mediocre.  Started good but quickly declined as our waitress had more tables added to her.  Probably jot her fault but we barely saw her throughout the meal and we waited an additional 20 min just to pay."}
{"text":"Really good and juicy burgers! We weren't really a fan of the chips so we would recommend upgrading to fries. Sad that there is a $2 upgrade for fries. Fries and burgers just go together. We got the Juicy Lucy and the Peanut Butter and Jelly one. Both were great but my husband preferred the peanut butter & jelly one better from Rehab Burger due to the Siracha sauce."}
{"text":"I don't normally write reviews on \"bar and grill\" type restaurants due to the fact that they're usually the same from one to the next. But the reason I gave your restaurant a 5 star rating and let alone a review to begin with was due to one of your servers. Vanessa was our server for our visit yesterday  (1/17) and her customer service skills deserve the highest praise available. We were seated after a short wait due to the football games going on. And as we were being seated, our server, Vanessa was heading to another one of her tables with drinks still stopped by, introduced herself very quickly and said she would be right back to get our drink order.  I found this pleasant because usually servers don't acknowledge customers until they come to their table to take orders. Upon returning Vanessa gave us the run down of the menu and drink options. Vanessa knew the menu inside and out and was able to describe the meals to perfection. We ended up ordering the tots, and a burger to share. The accuracy in which she described the taste of the two items before we even tasted them was incredible. She was polite, courteous and prompt when we would request another drink or napkins, etc. My gf and I aren't exactly the easiest customers to serve but she handled our orders and needs with ease and professionalism. This was our first visit to your restaurant and due to the wonderful service that Vanessa showed us, we will definitely be back. She deserves some sort of acknowledgement and praise for her customer service skills. Thank you Vanessa"}
{"text":"We had a late dinner on a Thursday with our 12 year old daughter.  It was really noisy inside, so we opted for the patio -- which was equally noisy.  I guess we should have anticipated that given it's a sports bar.  The patio wasn't that busy and our waitress came promptly to take drink orders and an appetizer.  We ordered the soft pretzel and dipping sauce. 
 When she returned with two beers and a root beer, she accidentally spilled beer in front of our daughter.  It splashed onto the appetizer plates and our silverware, so she took the silverware to replace it with fresh.  She never returned to wipe up the beer at our daughter's seat.  We ended up cleaning it up ourselves.  The appetizer pretzel was delicious, but it didn't come to the table until just moments before the entrees were served, so a lot of it went to waste.  I had the California Reuben with pastrami on sourdough because I wasn't feeling much like a burger and because....pastrami!!!!  The sandwich was just ok.  There was plenty of meat, but the bottom slice of bread was soggy which means it sat for some period of time before being served.  I ended up taking the meat off and just eating it separately.  My husband had the Ring of Fire burger which he enjoyed - spicy but not over the top.  The beer menu is extensive, so a lot to sample.  We'll definitely go back and try it again."}
{"text":"Our server June was friendly and very helpful with the menu.  The food was served hot and fresh and everything was excellent. The drinks came out quickly and tasted great too. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Damn was so hoping this place was going to be great but unfortunately it was not by looking at the menu they had a burger called prime rib Burger sounded awesome and delicious unfortunately it wasn't it was just a regular beef patty I ordered medium rare  but was still kind of dry weird with some tough dried-out sliced roast beef move that me the Burger all dry don't know two was hoping for a ground prime rib into a patty which was had the Caesar salad dressing was a little sour didn't care for that either bartender was friendly need the menu pretty well overall probably won't go back very expensive"}
{"text":"Great burgers, beers. On the weekends there is a long wait and it can be loud inside. I've never eaten on the patio but it looks great with a fireplace. Ton's of tv's everywhere."}
{"text":"We've probably eaten here 1/2 a dozen times and the food is GREAT! BUT, bring ur patience, it is slow and every time we've been here they have messed something up with our order. The servers always seem to be slammed and forgetful. If u have the time and a smaller party, it's worth it tho."}
{"text":"Way overweight rated. Should be called beer and cold cheeseburgers. Service is terrible, cheeseburgers just very average."}
{"text":"Meh. Don't get the hype over his place. Turkey burger had a weird texture and the ambience was just ok imho. Waitstaff was cool and friendly but you don't go there for the company."}
{"text":"Steak house truffle burger was the BOMB! Recommend this place if going out straight from work or just a chill night with your boo. Awesome!"}
{"text":"I have eaten at the location a few times and although the service leaves something to be desired the food had been pretty consistently a 4 out of 5. My daughter decides to take me yo lunch on Father's Day. There was a promotion father eat free so it was a great excuse to go out. The building was packed when we arrived. After about 15 minutes we were seated but it was at an outside table. Took another 15 minutes to get our drinks. Took 15 more minutes to place our food order. Took 75 minutes to get out food. We spend over two hour trying to have some burgers for lunch. When the food finally came the burger was burnt and I received the wrong side dish with my order. Let me be very clear this was poor management. They were way under staffed. To the point the ones who were working we hiding because everyone was upset. Some people left after an hour without food. It was a disaster. This was a great opportunity to build business and instead It destroyed it. I will NEVER spend my money here again. Far to many restaurant to have to waste time at this one."}
{"text":"This is such a cool place and they have the best make your own Bloody Mary bar I have ever seen. Great food and I  HIGHLY recommend it"}
{"text":"So I've been here about half a dozen times since moving to AZ and there's always something wrong with our food order. Either they forgot to put it, the order got lost, etc...The one thing consistent though are the apologetic waitresses who tell us they forgot to put our order in and are more then nice about it but then again that's 30 minutes later after the fact. This place is a nice and clean location but as far as food, I've had several burgers here and the burgers are just okay nothing to seek out when there are a ton of choices in AZ. One of the only food items I enjoy here are the Truffle fries. If you just want a carb filler, this is a perfect order, just ask them to make sure to spread the truffle oil nicely on the portion so it's spread evenly."}
{"text":"It can get loud and crazy during games, but it is a sports bar, so it's what you have to expect.  What I didn't expect was the food to be so dang good!  Skip the pretzel, but save room for the tableside s'mores!  It's hard to do though because the burgers are huge, and wow are they tasty!  Two thumbs up."}
{"text":"Great burgers, friendly service and a big selection of beer.  Chicago dogs.  What else is there?"}
{"text":"We live right down the street and were excited to try a new restaurant! We went for the first time on date night, come to find out $60 later after two beers, and two burgers we weren't very happy. We waited for about 45 minutes for two cheeseburgers that weren't complicated what so ever & when they came out the bottom of our buns were so soggy grease was dripping off..we also got two small beers which we loved. Once we got the check we were shocked at the price. We went again with our moms a few days ago & tried some appetizers which were great, got another burger, some salads, and a sand which. The burger was yet again soaked in grease to the point where we didn't eat it, the tater tots are wonderful, and sand which was okay. We most likely won't be there again unless it's pay day on a big game day."}
{"text":"Let's just start by saying they serve Old Milwaukee Beer.  That should be your first indication as to the overall quality.  I get the fun of retro beers, as they have PBR cans too, but focus on the good.  Plus, throw an Old Style in the mix.  That is the next big retro beer (CUBS fans already know), but I I digress.

I went here with work colleagues, and we all got different burgers to test the variety of the burgers & sides.  It should also be noted I paid very close attention to ladies next to us, as they ordered the Mac & Cheese (which looked good, but neither of them finished).

The burgers start at $10 and were blah.  One was over-cooked, the other under-cooked.  The meat was rather plain too, and seemed devoid of proper spicing.  The veggie patty was actually really tasty, but it easily fell a part looking like a rice bowl.  The bun seemed no different than the cheap white bun you can buy in bulk at Costco.  For a gourmet burger, the bun needs to be able to hold it's own.

The sides were much better.  The tater tots had a nice spice sprinkled on them.  A good tater tot is like a high-five in your mouth, so kudos.  The onion rings were delish & seemed hand-battered, but the fries were average & tasted like they came from a freezer bag.

The beer list (other than the Old Mil) was pretty nice.  I'd be happy to just sit here and toss a few back.

Service seemed slow & not 100%, but this place just opened.  It'll get better...

All in all, the folks at Arcadia Tavern know what they are doing (this is their joint too), but for the price & quality, I think there are better upscale burger joints out there."}
{"text":"New place just opened a few months back.  A standard sports bar with an extensive beer list (draft/bottle) and a number of draft beers on tap. Menu is as the name describes burgers, sandwiches, Mac & cheese and some salads. Wine list very limited and lower end. Burger was very good filling. Great sports spot as TV are 360.  The but .....it's another sports bar pub, very good but do not expect more.  Overall a 3.5 clean, good food, attentive staff great for group to watch a game. ...patio in works !"}
{"text":"This was my first time at one of these restaurants. We went before happy hour and during the week. Ordered a custom burger and it didn't disappoints. It was a mile high so had to eat it with a fork but it was tasty and looked like a work of art when it was delivered. It was large enough to split with my husband. Tip: If you ARE going to share it, just ask for it cut in 1/2 and with an extra plate. Splitting it in the kitching costs extra!

Lots of craft beers on tap to choose from and a ton more of the bottled to fit your taste.

The beer was not cheap but it is was still cheaper than craft beer is in Wisconsin, the Beer Capital of the country so that was a bonus. Go during Wednesday happy hour to get the best deal on burgers and beer. Our burger and 1 larger beer came to $22 when it wasn't happy hour.

Loads of TV's to watch and the location is just a block from home so it can't be beat. We'll be back."}
{"text":"This place is terrible. First time I went, it took over 30 minutes to get our appetizer, just to be told part of it fell on the ground so we needed to wait even longer for the rest of it. Food we did get was mediocre at best. Second time, my boyfriend goes on a Tuesday night, so there wasn't very many people there and he waits an hour for their food and it comes out cold. Don't expect much from this place if you go"}
{"text":"The burgers are alright.The vibe of the place is good. It's actually really nice inside and is decorated tight. I would recommend this place for \" cold one with the boys \"."}
{"text":"Went here with from friends yesterday, and the service and food were horrible. We all ordered at the same time, about 13 of us, and it took over an hour for everybody to get their food. The burgers were coming out 3 at a time, they were warm, not HOT, we asked to speak to the manager, and you could tell by his body language that he didn't care, our original waitress abandoned us (she wasn't that good) and the backup waitress was awesome. IT was a huge disappointment, to say the least. Not too sure if I'll give this place a try again."}
{"text":"The slowest service I have experienced in my life. Took 20 minutes to get greeted by our server & an additional 20 to get the drinks we ordered. Then it takes 30 minutes after we completed our meal to see our waitress to ask for the check. If you're training staff members cool, just make sure they're ready by the time you put them out on the floor.

I will say that the food is bomb though, hence the two stars ;)"}
{"text":"This is my 2nd favorite place for a burger.  Cool place great selection of beer.  Have your medium just perfect"}
{"text":"The dirty pelican is finally dead and gone.  Very excited to see a sports bar open up.  They completely gutted the place and it has definitely paid off - love the new look.  However, the food is so overpriced for what u get.  I mean seriously, if I'm getting a burger or sandwich between 12-15 bucks then it better blow my flipping mind and it better come with fries.  No such luck, those cost 2 bucks extra instead u get chips!   With fries, I'm approaching 14-17 bucks, come on, I might as well go to a fine dine restaurant and get a steak for 20 something.  This is a sports bar for the love of god.  Btw the sliders are tiny and cost 10 bucks also they didn't drop on the blue cheese as the menu specified.  And for happy hour no discounts on craft beer, how sad!  Please god, one day I want to see a nice brew pub with reasonable priced food at this location before I die."}
{"text":"Trying it again, remodeled.  Awesome wait service and drinks.  Nice selection of ciders and stout beers.
I ordered a couple of hot dogs with tots and salad.  Specifically the Chicago dog and LA dog...BAD BAD BAD idea to toast the bun.  Come on now has any of the owners/managers tried the dogs with the toasted buns?  Hard as a rock both of them, reminded me of stale bread that I would feed to birds.
Try this owners and experiment, go to Bashas next door, buy some Aunt Hatties hot dog buns and make the Chicago & LA dog without toasting the bun.
I am guessing this is what happened, the first bite was a nice soft bun with the snap of the hot dog and the flavors of each specific hot dog.
I will have to wait another 3 years to try you'all again.
You have to admit I did try you again....Good Luck or let me know when you switch to Aunt Hattie buns..."}
{"text":"We started coming here for HH since we live nearby.  It's busy, bursting with activity, and over-all a fun place to come.  Everything is clean since it is a brand new place.  The last time we went my wife tried the Mac-n-cheese and just didn't like it.  She didn't make a big deal of it but our waitress noticed and visited with her, saying she was sorry.  Within minutes the manager appeared and genuinely wanted to know what she did and did not like about it.  He then asked if he could interest her something different and she took him up on his offer of a large warm pretzel and cheese dip.  That was a hit.  It was nice to see the staff and management cared, even while very busy with others.  And yes - the beer is COLD!  Prices are good too."}
{"text":"First time here. Had a turkey burger.  Terrible.  Goopy, gloppy, and tasteless.  Whole wheat bun...white bread. Lettuce tomato and onion a mess.  Burger is dog food in my opinion. As others have said:  Expensive.  Try a turkey burger at Hopdoddy; world of difference.  Wasted my money and time."}
{"text":"First time here yesterday. Dined with my daughter. I had the 1000 Island and my daughter had the Roadhouse along with the sweet tots. Everything was very good. Waitress was helpful and attentive."}
{"text":"$47 for 2 burgers and 2 beers and burger was dry, and my pretzel bun was stale. Didn't feel like complaining so I'm taking my frustrations out here."}
{"text":"We come here often because my partner's parents love this place.  Overall, I think the concept is fun but the experience and food are mediocre at best.

The food is all pretty pricey in general.  There is an upcharge for everything, including extra sauce (ranch dressing, buffalo, etc) which gets old pretty quick.  The food is good, but there is an overall smell in the restaurant of stinky feet which really interferes with even trying to enjoy your food.  If you sit outside, be prepared to deal with flies all over the place.  

The service is meh.  If a server isn't trying to prematurely take your food away from you so they can turn the table, then they are ignoring you altogether.  This has been my experience every time I've been here.  Which is even more annoying when the server forgets your $.50 extra buffalo sauce, and you cannot get their attention so that you can even start to eat your meal before it gets cold.  

Inside and outside, the tables are jam-packed and it's nearly impossible to avoid bumping into anyone or to avoid having someone's rear end bounce against your table as youre trying ot eat.  For the price they charge, I would expect a much more enjoyable experience.

Overall, I wouldn't continue to come here were it not for my partner's parents, and In the 10 times about that we have come here, I've yet to have a \"good\" experience."}
{"text":"UPDATE: Todd the GM comped a decent portion... was  apologetic and concerned... Thank you Todd

Holy cow fire everyone working tonight.

I have been to cold beers 4 days this week. Today was literally the worst dining experience of my life.

We waited 40 mins for pretzels..... we asked the manager Scott what he would do about it and he said he'd take them off the tab.. turned his back and walked away.

Scott needs to be fired... there is absolutely no excuse for his behavior and tone.

Since complaining about my service I've been staring at my empty plate for 36 mins... my daughter is disgusted.. 

I complained to Todd (other manager)... he seemed helpful and concerned but the service has not improved and nothing has been comped. 

I understand tonight looks like a staffing issue.. but this day has been an absolute nightmare and I'm truly disgusted"}
{"text":"Beers, patio, cold beer, great special tonight, and plenty of TV's with sports.  No need to go anywhere else."}
{"text":"Service is terrible. Sometimes is better at the bar than the tables, though.  I don't know if the servers are just clueless or if they just don't care.  Have visited several times, hoping it would be better the next, as the food is halfway decent.  But am kind of over having to wait 20 minutes for someone to acknowledge us, having to ask repeatedly for another beer (even though my glass has been sitting empty for 10 minutes), and the blatant ignoring of customers that it appears every person working there is a pro at.
The only thing that will keep them open is the multiple sports t.v.'s-- A good place to watch a game, if you don't mind waiting forever for drinks and food, albeit having to ask for both yourself."}
{"text":"I really like this place. It's noisy, so if you're looking for somewhere to talk, this is not it. There's a plethora of beers to choose from as well as burgers, or you can build your own. The buffalo chicken totchos are amazing and a very sizable portion - a lot to share. It's tater tots with shaved grilled chicken and buffalo sauce. My fav is the Juicy Lucy, which has melted cheese inside the burger. The only thing I'm not crazy about is the Mac and cheese. It's kind of bland even when you build your own. 

Make sure to reserve a table through Yelp as it is usually very busy. When you check in at the time specified, they are usually prompt about seating you. Much appreciated!"}
{"text":"Typically when you have above-average menu prices, you expect at least average food with above-average service but that was not the case.

The service was the bare minimum, \"What can I get for you?\" and \"here's your check\", and the menu prices are suggest the ability to substitute but when you do substitute you get charged.  For instance, I ordered the Buffalo Chicken sandwich and asked for ranch dressing instead of bleu cheese.  Yep, I got charged for that.  I am not a big fan of chips and wanted fries.  That will be $2.  

If you are interested in mediocre food and service with above average menu prices where you get nickel and dimed on everything, then this is your place.  For me, I will be taking my business to either Oregano's or The Ivy.

One last note, I am surprised the restaurant hasn't started charging its customers for parking."}
{"text":"Very slow service. Had to ask twice for water. Food was good but very slow.  Server disappeared."}
{"text":"Nothing special. There are countless better places to go for food, but the beer selection and TV options were great. I'd come back for a football game."}
{"text":"Our family has been looking forward to this restaurant opening for months. I think we waited as long for our food as we did for it to open! The initial wait was an hour, expected that since its new. The wait for food was also an hour. The layout was not well thought out. They have no spot for the large amount of people waiting for tables, the hostess is right by the front door which clearly gets over crowded, and the bathrooms have major crowding too. The volume inside is so loud we had to ask for outdoor seating otherwise you can't talk to the person sitting right next to you. Luckily they have great misters out there. Being so new, I would have expected more interactions from the managers. But I couldn't even tell if there was a manager present. I really hope this location can get it together, would love to see this restaurant succeed."}
{"text":"Nice staff, they make it personal by greeting you and shaking hand. Amazing burgers too!

Ordered one of the spicy burgers and it was a bit spicy but not too much. Fries are pretty bomb too. 

Must stop by here if you're in town or haven't yet. Good food and vibes there."}
{"text":"If you like a place with music so loud you can't hear the person next to you with slow service, bad service, cold fries, below average burgers at $13 each then you have found your new place.  Had to flag the waitress down for everything and she was nowhere to be found most of the time. What a huge disappointment!!!  I give it 6 months at most unless they revamp everything.  Don't waste your time or money."}
{"text":"Both locations are great. Open concept, TONS of flatscreens, cute wait staff...COLD beer and cheeseburgers, hot dogs and Mac...what could be better, right?! Being the only female in my house, I am outnumbered when my guys want to go out to eat. They'd choose this place every damn time if I let 'em :)"}
{"text":"Pretty solid burger joint and atmosphere. I make a point to stop in here from time to time."}
{"text":"The food was bleh. It is very loud. I am not a beer person, so it may be great if you're into beer. Lots of families, so not just a bar kind of atmosphere, but our son ended up waiting outside because we were seated near the bar and it was just too loud for him."}
{"text":"Came here on Sunday for dinner. Place was packed! Loud inside but it's a sports bar! 3 of us had burgers and the 4th the club sand which. The food came out fairly quick for being really busy and it was one of the best burgers I've had in awhile! Gruyere cheese, carmelized onions, with baby greens, avocado, with homemade mayo on the standard bun for me was amazing to the last bite with fries chips or some other sides."}
{"text":"This place is soooooooooo.... average it hurts. The staff has no personality and doesn't understand three could be a difference between a beer the day trip and triple IPA. Burgers are just burgers and homemade potato chips should be served warm with no exceptions."}
{"text":"CBCB is an awesome Sports Pub - the staff is phenomenal and the food is fantastic.   They have one of the largest beer menu that I've ever seen.  Both Lance, Tim & Kaitlyn behind the bar are wonderful - they treat you very well and remember you every time you come back.  Keep in mind that this is just a burger & beer place - so if you want something more fancy - then this is NOT your place.  But if you looking for a great place with a fun and casual atmosphere where \"everybody knows your name\" ... then you will love it !!"}
{"text":"Best burger place in Scottsdale.  Love the build your own burger and the tots! Great Mac n Cheese too!  If you're reviewing this place and haven't had a burger or a beer, then GTFO seriously."}
{"text":"This was my first visit at this burger joint and I'm pleasantly surprised. Overall a great atmosphere, with good music and lots of huge TVs to watch. We were quoted about a half hour but we got sat within 10 mins. Hostesses seem to be a bit lost, but the other staff was great. Our server Venessa was super bubbly and seemed to enjoy her job. The wait time for the food was a bit long but was worth the wait. Try the Pb&J and burger, you won't regret it! My husband and I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I'm sad to report that Cold Beers & Cheeseburgers is the only thing that this restaurant serves. The food was acceptable, however perhaps they should consider adding \"Service\" and \"Friendliness\" and \"Great Prices\" to the name, making it a little more true and holding their staff accountable.

There is a nice little outdoor seating area, however since you are in Arizona, if it is below 70 degrees, they'll put the heater on. So don't sit outside in those conditions if you are from any non-Arizona state or not from the planet Mercury. 

There are better places for cold beers and cheeseburgers, so make sure you give them a try before entering this below average establishment."}
{"text":"To sum it up, very bad. 

Unfortunately my family and I's experience here was well below my expectation. Not only did our waitress fail to complete a single request, (not bringing sauces or cheeses for apps) at no point during the night did she fill up any of our drinks once. We did that ourselves at the bar, our orders were also incorrect upon arrival to the table. I would say $60 dollars for sub par food and pathetic service is well overpriced. Also $2 for fries is unamerican."}
{"text":"Had great food and great service for lunch yesterday. Had the Juicy-Lucy- fer. Good spice and messy."}
{"text":"This place is a perfect addition to the neighborhood.  Exactly what we needed. A family burger-hot dog-mac n cheese- slider and beer joint.  Lot's of televisions for whatever game is on.  We ordered the grilled asparagus for starters and it was very nice.  Very well seasoned in olive oil and cheese.  We got two burgers and they were fantastic. First off they are HUGE 1/2 lb. burgers.  We couldn't finish them.  They were very nicely seasoned, quite juicy and the bun was great.  These burgers are some of the best in this part of town. The onion rings are well battered and a huge portion.  The french fries were just okay and next time we'll try the tots.  Those looked great.  I also had the chopped salad which was just okay, but a nice healthy portion of veggies if you don't want to go for the big burgers.  The menu is a total winner.  Custom mac-n-cheese, a variety of sliders, a variety of hot dogs, lots of sandwiches.  The French Dip looked really good.  Finally, I must mention the beer selection.  It was impressive.  One more thing, I though the service was great.  We ordered at the front and they brought out our food very hot and lickedy split.  Our table had napkins and silver ware ready for us.  The person who gave one star should try this place again, especially if they like a big juicy burger."}
{"text":"We checked this place out after a nice hike on Sunday. We sat outside on the back patio and watched the Diamondbacks game on the huge TV's at the bar. 

We all got Bloody Mary's and they were delicious. Option to get it normal or you can spice it up!!

We started with the buffalo chicken tater tots. WoooWEE did they have a kick to them, but they were absolutely delicious. 

We are foodies and celebrate any and every food holiday. It was National PB & J Day so naturally we got the Bacon PB & J burger. Sounds interesting, and definitely wouldn't have been our first choice but dang was it good. The bacon really made the burger!! 

This place is such a great spot to meet up with friends for a drink and to watch sports while enjoying a delicious meal!!

xoxo @blondeswhoeat"}
{"text":"It's exactly as the name states. It's a great place to watch sports since it has TVs in every available inch of wall. The only gripe I would have is the Parking situation, I don't mind valeting but it gets full quickly.  I had the sliders and my favorite drink was a Gentlemen's Mule, it's a perfect drink on a warm day. The service was friendly but definitely learning the ropes as I believe that some are pretty new to the hospitality business.  It's close, which I love."}
{"text":"There was no wait which was good and plenty of tables...So why on Earth when we walked up the 3 hostesses that were standing behind the podium completely ignores us all looking down at something. We had to interrupt them to get their attention. Then we got seated and waited 15 minutes with no one stoping to even get a drink order. Finally a hostess dropped off water and left. We then had to flag down another hostess to ask? for a server...5 minutes later...Still no one. So we left and went next door to BLD...Fast service and fantastic food."}
{"text":"The place was hoppin' on St. Patty's day when we decided to give it a try.  Though it was busy, we didn't have to wait for a table.  We didn't seat ourselves, unlike other reviews, so it wasn't confusing or unlike any other seating experience.  Our waitress greeted us quickly and she was super nice and helpful.  She suggested I get their orange blossom beer, which was such a good suggestion.  I loved it... especially because our beers were served green for St. Patty's Day.

The Hubs and I shared a burger, which took a while for us to get.  Apparently the order was messed up, but our waitress caught it and had them make another one.  We did wait awhile, but she was so nice about it we really didn't mind.  They split the burger for us and also gave us a mix of sweet potato and regular tatter tots.  Having been to it's sister restaurant, Arcadia Tavern, we knew the tots are a home run.  The burger was very good- cooked well and had a lot of flavor.

The atmosphere in the place is similar to Arcadia Tavern with lots of TVs for watching games.  Our waitress was nice enough to give us $5 off for our messed up burger, so we were really appreciative of that.  We are so happy to have a U of A bar close to home now!  We will for sure be back to watch some games and have some good food."}
{"text":"Yo yo peeps this Glendale spit is a must try . Great neighborhood restaurant with tons of big screen tv to catch your favorite team playing . Grab your buds, studs and babes and head out to Cold Beets & Cheeseburgers and order your favorite beer . Their burgers are delicious ! I recommend sharing but you be the judge. If you go let me know what you think Enjoy"}
{"text":"First of all I rarely do negative reviews as I have a high tolerance for slow or bad service when the food is good. But I feel I have to and only hope that the service will improve at the Shea location. I have not been to the other locations so I can't comment on the service at those locations. 

Food I rate a 4, service 0 stars. 

Service is hit or miss. More miss than anything. Used to come here once a week but we are going to wait until service improves. Food is good when made as ordered, however the last several times I ordered build your own burger it was missing one or two things I had on the list, like mayo or saut√©ed onions. If you are missing something like a condiment don't expect to ever get it or plan on asking someone else.  From my experience make sure to order when someone is in front of you or you will have a long wait.  I really hope service improves so I can go back.

Update.   

Since opening they have really improved.  Food has been more consistent and the service has improved as well.  

Food still 4 and service is now a 4.  Great burgers and tons of beer options."}
{"text":"Delicious, Fast, and friendly. I loved the variety of beer they have. Will definitely be coming back with more people."}
{"text":"Fun sports bar with tons of TVs and can get extremely busy. Also food is a little better than you would expect at your typical bar. 

Watched game 1 of the finals there with an out of town friend. Wait was crazy for a table (hour and a half). But found space to stand at the bar until a few spots opened up. Both had a few beer and burgers which were really solid. 

Maybe a few more bucks than your average sports bar but due to the quality of the food and space I think it is well worth it."}
{"text":"Tried this place at lunch with my friend from work. It was new and I do love a good cheeseburger. 

Came in and was greeted like we were interrupting something important. Sorry. Just wanted to try your cheeseburgers. They reluctantly seated us. Our server was very awesome though. Very friendly and patient. We had a lot of questions about the menu. Rather pricey for a lunch time cheeseburger. But, if it was good, it would be worth it. If....

Waitress comes and gets our drinks. We both order iced tea. Simple enough. But it was BAD. Like have not changed the filter since they opened hard chemical taste bad. Changed up to diet sodas. Then we both ordered extremely weird orders. Replace this with that. Put that on the side. Add extra this. Our server was on it. She got it all and was very happy to see we got what we requested. So far so semi-good (other than the greeting & tea).

Food comes out. Its this young kid from the kitchen. He comes out going to all the tables with younger and pretty girls sitting at them asking them if this is their order. Skips every table with a large person, all guys or older people sitting there. So we tried to get his attention but he was totally concentrating on something else entirely. So we watch as our food is walking around with this kid getting nice and cold. He goes back to the kitchen with it. Shortly after our waitress comes out with it. Colder than I like it.

I replaced my order's fries with coleslaw. Big mistake. One, the slaw was a $2 up-charge. And two, it had the nastiest seasonings in it. It was uneatable. How can you ruin cole slaw?! My burger was ok. The burger itself, the meat part, perfection. Perfectly cooked and amazing flavor and juiciness. Cool. Everything else. Slop. I wanted the blue cheese burger, It had maybe 5 crumbs of blue cheese. So the you could not taste it. No avocado at all and very sparing on the rest of the toppers. A little birdie kept flying over the kitchen yelling \"cheep cheep cheep\"! They snubbed me on a great burger experience so they could make as much money on me as possible.

To summarize. Bad welcome. Awesome server. Bad rest of staff. Bad tea. Ok burger. EXTREMELY overpriced. Over $20 for my hamburger that was supposed to be a cheeseburger, disgusting coleslaw and crap drinks. Felt like I was screwed to the highest with this lunch.

Then as we left (out the FRONT door) one of the staff had a pile of trash that he ran into us with and spilled boxes on the floor. He got mad and started kicking them out the door. We tried being nice and help the door open for him, but he was mad. I thought trash is supposed to go out the back somewhere. Not the front where people are literally being kicked out with it.

Never returning. Ever."}
{"text":"A great place for \"cold beer and burgers\"!! Great food and service. The burgers are what they do best, however you must try the  mac and cheese as well!!  Yum!!"}
{"text":"This place is gross. The hamburgers are predone and just put on the grill to heat up. Reason I know is because the cheese wasn't even melted and the chips were stale. Never going back."}
{"text":"Ordered the PITTSBURGHER.  If this is supposed to be an imitation of a Primanti Brothers sandwich, it's a very lame excuse.  Burger was very average, the bun is overwhelming, there was minimal Cole slaw and NO FRIES on the sandwich.  Your fired!  Won't be back.  Also, if you expect fans to come here to watch football you need to do something about the volume on the sets rather than muting all of the announcer commentary.  All American Bar in Fountain Hills has individual speakers at each table."}
{"text":"The beer selection is awesome. Alot of great beers on draft and in bottles. I really liked not seeing the usual domestics on draft. The menu has a lot of great items. The only thing that wasn't great was the service. We were there for almost two hours, and sat for 10 min before we even had our drink order taken. there was also other tables around us that had not recieved service. Would probably return though hoping the service gets better."}
{"text":"Tried this place after I had enough of another sports bar that I frequented. CB & CB, didn't wow me, its just a new corporate owned place. The burger was good. Fries and Tots are frozen store bought stuff. It does take an overly long time to get your food, which is a known issue. 

I sat at the bar and I believe my hands went numb from the metal edging they have around the bar, you can't get comfortable. I wasn't too fond of the tattoo'd bartenders that looked like they were fresh off the lake. It is overly loud inside with a football game playing, even the bartenders were having issue hearing your order. Burger and couple drinks will set you back close to $30. Good place to go once a month right now, maybe more often when the newness wears off and the staff has it all under control."}
{"text":"Second time here and both visits were the same. Great food, good service, relaxed atmosphere. I had the juicy Lucy and onion rings this last visit and they were excellent.

Third and fourth visit service sucked but food was still very good. Service can be hit or miss but food is usually on point."}
{"text":"Good food, lousy service. My waitress was too busy flirting with the guys to pay me any attention. I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"I love coming here!! Their burgers are always on point and the tot-chos are to die for!!! It's a great atmosphere and I will be coming back. The manager Casey stopped by the table and he was very pleasant and professional. All in all an awesome experience."}
{"text":"My friend and I went here for dinner last night after having a great day shopping at Kierland Commons.  Our server was great but out of nowhere walks up a woman and tells us we are cut off!  Both my friend and I had two drinks and were not even ordering another one.  She was very rude so I asked to talk to her manager.  He came up to our table with his hand on his hip and a very bad attitude and I introduce myself and he didn't want to hear anything I had to say.  I told him then to pick up our tab and we would leave and he said ok.  So we were leaving and he set the bill on our table but we just left.  My friend did go back and pay the bill because our server was awesome.  I was so embarrassed since I had been telling my friend for a long time how good the food was here.  It was a horrible end to a great day and I do not recommend anyone to go here.  When my friend went back to pay the bill the woman that initially approached our table rudely stated \"I don't know why your friend was so mad\",  Well it was very embarrassing and unwarranted.  I guess she said she had been watching us.....weird and again...we were just enjoying a chat and eating.  Totally confused why she decided to make a problem when there was no problem."}
{"text":"Food  has always been good at this place. I have been here at least 5 times. The only problem is our server.  This is the second time we get her and for some reason she is not in a good mood. We are good customers and tip well.  Yes. I will be back to this place. But if I get the same server I will ask for another table."}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't already reviewed CBCB; it's definitely a delicious part of my regular rotation. Their beer list is MASSIVE! They currently have Alpine Duet on tap, which is one of my favorite IPAs in the world. We normally come here for Mmmac Daddy Mondays - unlimited toppings for $12, such a smokin deal! The portion sizes are gigantic; I usually need up taking more than half my bowl home and making two more meals out of it. The burgers are consistently delicious, and they actually cook your patty to your desired temperature. 

Probably the most life changing thing that I've only discovered at CBCB... Totchos. Yep, tots + nachos. Mind BLOWN. If you have a cheat day coming up and you're looking for some artery clogging goodness, this is your winner right here. The original totchos with chili, cheese, sour cream, and guac is amazing; as is the buffalo chicken variety. The serving size can easily feed 2-3 people, though you might not want to share!

This is a great place to watch sports, as there are massive TVs on every wall so you always have a good view of the game you're looking for. The service here is pretty hit or miss, though Sierra was our server this time and she was excellent!"}
{"text":"Shouldn't the hangover burger have a runny egg?  I got a completely done fried egg.  Buns were soggy..everything was overpriced.   Four peaks is no longer da bomb.  Won't be back.  Service also sucked."}
{"text":"Awesome location in the restaurant row of 7th Street. Happy hour is really good with beer specials and mixed drinks. Jessi was our server and was on point the whole time refilling drinks before we even had to ask. Will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"Tasty burgers and good service, lot's of tv's to view."}
{"text":"Great 1/2 lb burger selection. The PB&J burger was interesting to say the least. Be warned, if you share it with your munchkin, it's spicy (even with the delicious chipotle sauce on the side.) A choice of sides includes sweet potato tater tots! To top it off, you can roast s'mores at your dinner table (always a hit with the kids!) But, the price point is a tad high.

Dinner for 3, including dessert & a couple drinks, will run up to $$$ pretty quick!"}
{"text":"Hannah is very nice as a server. This place's food is amazing. My family had a wonderful time. GO TAT CHOS!!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and our friends visited CB&CB last night for the first time! We had a few different appetizers and drinks. Our server Sydney recommended the Buffalo Chicken egg rolls and the totchos. Both were so great! The egg rolls were my favorite. The best part of our experience was our server Sydney. She was so kind, attentive, and provided amazing service to us. We will be back because of Sydney. CB&CB is lucky to have you as an employee."}
{"text":"Worst service I've ever Had. 15 minutes later after being sat I was able to hunt down a server who was then able to find another server to take our order. No hello or apology whatsoever. Went on to take our order before walking away without saying a word. Was very short and rude with every encounter. Then waited 20 minutes for our check before searching the restaurant for our waitress. Her name is LO and I wish the best of luck to anyone that gets stuck with her. I hope she finds the clue she looking for."}
{"text":"Always looking for a good burger so decided to give this place a shot during happy hour. It was very busy with many families and small children there. It's a local Grayhawk hangout, nice little joint with many beers and TV's all over the place. I ordered some new burger they had called the French Onion for $13 (a little pricey IMHO). I think I misread the description because I was somehow thinking I was getting a french onion soup type of dipping bowl or something. It was a big burger with an onion ring on it and some french dip sauce. Although it was different than what I had envisioned it was still very tasty and the fries were pretty good too. Huge portions. They had 16 oz beers in cool grenade style mugs for $3. Many other beers to chose from. I had good service and even though it was packed the food came out in a timely manner.  I would go here again, I will try the shake next time with my burger."}
{"text":"Food was good but not worth the terrible service. My family and I got seated and our waitress didn't show up for over 15 minutes to get drinks started. I'm not sure if this is an occasional matter but enough to keep us away. Customer service should be a priority."}
{"text":"We ordered from door dash or uber eats or something... The burgers were good,  fries were good...
Wee will definitely be ordering again.  It wasn't amazing or unique but worth it for some decent food at a decent price."}
{"text":"So consistently good experience. Brand new building and relocated from Grayhawk which was their original location. Lots of tv's. Lots of taps, tater tots, and burgers. 

All that said, please don't go here so I can get a seat during football season with all their TVs."}
{"text":"Good neighborhood sports bar. Array of cheeseburgers and lots of TV's. Nice indoor/outdoor bar with outside sitting area. This is much smaller than the Old Town location. Bartenders always seem attentive. 

My only con on this place is not a lot of beers on tap. Wish they had a little more selection. But generally people can find something that fits their tastes."}
{"text":"Had an amazing experience here at Cold Beers! It's brand new, they have great games, fantastic food and staff! Lindsay was a spectacular waitress who was very knowledgeable. Will of course be coming back."}
{"text":"They have a great crew of people there.  Went to have a cocktail and check it out and the staff was friendly and very attentive.  

Love the 1000s of TVs the place seems to have!  You have like 15 TVs to choose from at every seat in the house.   

Great addition to the neighborhood. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Excellent~! Madison was our server, she attends ASU and works here, GREAT Service, Madison~!! And the other server gave my husband fresh fries plus the chips.... We love this neighborhood Gem~!!"}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place out! I got a hamburger which was great but not mind blowing. I also ordered the buffalo tots and I have been incredibly excited to try it out because I absolutely love anything buffalo sauce. It wasn't as good as I hoped. The dish itself was incredibly salt, so salty, I could barely eat it. The burgers were overpriced, not sure that it was worth it. Fries were okay. I am giving this place a 3 star because the beer option is great and I love that its not dark in there. Many bars tend to be dark, not this place. Great music was playing and the crowd was a good one. Our waitress was okay, she seemed bored and was very talkative with some other waitress, I am pretty sure we heard how the party went last weekend and a lot of gossip. Which is fine but maybe not do that loudly right by our table."}
{"text":"For good food and beer, this is the place. Awesome waitress Dana took care of us today! Really enjoyed our burgers and the special mayo sauce. Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Slow, slow service. Waited 25 minutes for someone to take our drink order and then waited 15 minutes for food that was barely warm. Had the Juicy Lucy and my husband had the regular All American Burger. Orders only come with chips if you want fries $2 extra. When burgers are upwards of $11.50 and up one would think they could include fries and not potato chips. Really?? Habit Burger is much better and can get 3 double Char burgers for about the same price and even better taste. Will definitely not be going back there. Way overpriced for what you get!"}
{"text":"Went here for my BD dinner with the Mrs.  Wait staff was very friendly and prompt. I ordered the Juicy Lucy (last one of those I had was over 45 years ago at the 5-8 Club in Minneapolis). Was REALLY good! Love that molten cheese that erupts out of the patty when you bite into it. The burgers are large, as are the side of fries that come with it. We were very impressed with the food and the service, will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Always a good time and good food!  Staff is helpful. 

Celebrated Father's Day at CB&C - it was crowded but they kept it moving and the wait wasn't bad at all."}
{"text":"Waited about ten to fifteen minutes with no waiter or waitress in site. The location was busy but not busy enough to not be acknowledged. I am sitting at Red Robin right now enjoying my burger and fries. I eat out quite a bit and I will never go back to this location. Short version: service sucks!"}
{"text":"Have to say I love cold beer & cheeseburgers. Good food n good atmosphere! However the location in Gilbert is the same as tailgaters. (Last failed bar in its location) ...bad service.... the service is not good. Hence 2 stars. I usually go to chandler, Sorry to say I'm disappointed at the Gilbert location. We were sat at a table n sat n sat until I had to go ask for a server... I would advise to pick up service or communication between host staff n servers... there's no reason to sit for more then a few minutes to wait for someone to tend to you. Gosh..it's so convenient having it close n hope our next visit is better. best of luck to the Gilbert location. I really hope you pick it up...."}
{"text":"The beer selection was extensive,  but I wish there were more options on tap. My burger was delicious. You definitely have to a eat these with a fork - there was no chance of eating it as a burger. Service was decent,  not great."}
{"text":"The best burgers ever! Great atmosphere!! We definitely need more places like this in the west valley!"}
{"text":"Good food, great patio, and great beers on available. Can't really ask for much more then that. Also, there are a lot of TVs. I recommend the AZ burger and the buffalo chicken dip!"}
{"text":"Nice new addition to the bar and restaurant scene in the area. 

Hosting a pretty impressive beer list- both bottles and draught it's a big open spot to stop in for some drinks. The food menu is chalk full of burgers and starters like buffalo wings, sliders, mozzarella sticks and more. 

On my visit the food was pretty good and well presented, coupled with super friendly service. Would be a great spot to watch a game as lots of TVs."}
{"text":"We go to Oreganos very often but we all ways wondered about this place. Not a big fan of the valet parking in such a small parking lot. The food was less than average and the service wasn't much better. I'm pretty sure that my girlfriend and I won't be returning anytime soon with all the other great places to go."}
{"text":"This was our first time here.  Surprisingly there was no wait.  Usually on weekends, it's usually a long line every time we have tried to eat here.

First off, the waitress and manager were awesome. (Notice I bring up the manager before anything else?)  When I saw the menu, the prices, they charge to split a plate, the build your own burger (Reminded me of Zinburger and Ruth Chris steakhouse.)...I wasnt sure a burger joint would live up to the expectations.  I took the plunge.

I ordered the Steakburger.  Medium rare.  Do I want homemade potato chips or a premium side ( extra charge.)  The waitress reads off the sides.  Do you have onion straws? (No) mashed potatos?(no)  what kind of fries? (Thin-cut, steak,)  i settled for the Sweet tator tots at her recomendation. My husband placed his order.  We wait about 20 minutes and the food comes out.

My burger comes out to me medium well. (GROSS)   It did take a minute for the waitress to check on us but she was so nice and quick to fix it. The tator tots were so delicious that I ate half before my correct temp burger came out. I did like the sweetness of the bun mixed with the tangyness of the salad mix but the burger meat tasted funky.  Like I could taste the gas used for the flames or charcoal/lighter fluid-taste.  I'm not sure what it was.   I ate the \"salad\" part of the burger and bacon. (Think BLT).  She told the manager (i didnt even ask her to) who took $5.00 off the bill.  Nice touch.  But never the less, by that time, i just took the majority of my burger home.

Here is where I left Cold Brews.  Although the prices were high- like others mentioned, the food did not leave me with a great enough impression that I would want to spend $20.00 a person on it again-truly a bad first impression. (Even the \"medium rare\" burger I finally received.) I have been to way more expensive places and because the food was outstanding in every way, the price wasn't an object.  I cant say this about the food we order.  No better, no worse, nothing that made it stand out (or worthy) more than any other burger joint.  The best thing about my burger was the spring salad under my burger and the sweet tator tots.The tator tots were so delicious that I ate half before my correct temp burger came out. 

This is a good place to go if I have a group of friends who want to watch every type of sports and have an order of tots but we really were not impressed with their burgers."}
{"text":"I have to start out by saying the food was ok. I don't like having to write a bad Yelp review nor do I do so very often, but in a case where a place really is that bad I feel like I need to let other people know about my experience. First off, my dad who is a Scottsdale native has been here, after his first (and last) time eating at this establishment I believe his words of wisdom to me were \"never fu@king eat here, ever!\" I don't get over to Scottsdale much but a special occasion had me in the area, my girlfriend and her family were in the mood for hotdogs and burgers so, I agreed to go even though what my dad had told me was lingering in the back of my mind. I really did go in to it with an open mind, I wanted to give it a chance.... They sat us in a corner booth and basically forgot about us, I had to physically get up after waiting for our waitress for 15 minutes and ask if they could send her to our table, the AC felt like it was off as it was 82 degrees outside and 90 in the building. Finally, we were able to get our order in, waited a good 30 minutes for our food and they brought out 3 of the 5 plates about 5 minutes before the other two plates. There was no silverware or napkins at the table, so yet again, we had to get up and go ask the receptionist for help. To top it all off it was overpriced. 

In a nutshell, the service is HORRIBLE, the employees working that night were clueless (except maybe the chef) food is ok but over priced, the beer wasn't even that \"cold\" 

Dad- you were right."}
{"text":"Read about the restaurant in Chandler magazine. Outrageous picture of a hamburger stacked 3 high.  Since it's close to my office I decided to take my staff to lunch there at noon. We were seated quickly even though it was busy. We were greeted by a friendly waitress and she tended to our drinks quickly. We had to wait about 15 minutes for our food but it was very hot and delicious. The hamburgers were cooked to our order, tasty in every way. The French fries were hot and crispy throughout the meal. I ordered the mac and cheese too. That was hot, creamy and the cheese actually tasted like, well....cheese. This was a wonderful meal. I can't wait to return and try the cold beer part of the meal. Really enjoyed it."}
{"text":"I used to serve for 4 years so I understand that it can get busy and the kitchen can run behind sometimes. But last night had to have been the worst experience eating at a restaurant. Our waitress was absolutely terrible. Just to take our order on drinks took a long time. Now we got those quick. But she literally took 20 mins to come back and take our orders. And for our food to come out took another 30 mins, and because i worked in the industry, i know it shouldn't take that long. And if you know it's going to be.. you advice your table at least.. and she didn't even do that. Everyone liked the food at the table which was great, but my cheeseburger sliders were so small that my 2 year old niece can eat that and still not be full. Even my friends said that's way too small to be sliders. 
Of course it took forever for us to get our check. So my friend went up to another server and asked if we could get our bill because the service is slow and just terrible and the guy just said \"k\", he didn't even apologize when he dropped the check off, didn't even look at us. 
We're always one to tip over 20% and i always give everyone the benefit of the doubt.. but I didn't even feel like i shouldve given $5. 
Our server was super nice. But whoever the manager is at this place needs to learn how to train their employees a lot better in general. 
Definitely not coming back to this location. The one in Chandler has better service."}
{"text":"I love a good burger! And by good I mean a messy, juicy burger and this place had it down and all the sports on t.v makes me want to move in! The onion rings are killer! Can't wait to try the Mac and cheese....and every burger on the menu!"}
{"text":"Went last week Sat for dinner. Regular margarita on the rocks tasted like a glass of sour salt water.  Burger itself wasn't seasoned at all....but the cheese and bun was delicious. Onion rings were tasty. Myself and boyfriend were very dissatisfied."}
{"text":"One of the best sportsbars in Scottsdale. Loads of large HD screens and some of the best burgers around. I had the Steakhouse Truffle Burger, really good. My only gripe is that the burgers are served with potato chips which means you have to pay extra for fries. By the time you do this, the cost of a burger & fries can get close to $20. A little pricey. But apart from that I really liked the place."}
{"text":"First time here and really enjoyed. I had the Jucy Lucy ordered \"barely\" medium and it was cooked perfect. Mother in law and daughter ordered the American burger well done. It was cooked perfectly. My wife had the Hot N Smoky Mac N Cheese and it was really good. I didnt care for the chips but I love when places have tater tots so I called an audible and ordered tater tots mid meal and they came super fast and hot. Yummy! 
Sydney was our server and was fantastic. Very friendly, always had a smile, attentive and felt like we were her only table even though she had a handful of them. Thanks Sydney and sorry we ran you around for togo boxes at the end! We will be back at some point."}
{"text":"Note: Great Burgers and Drinks

My recent experience with like this:

I came here expecting to find difficulty seating our party of 8. But I was wrong the hostess immediately took us to a table and sat us. We were immediately greeted by our waitress. Things were looking up. But then we had to wait 15 minutes to order. My drink came to the table only partially made. The waitress was pleasant and immediately took care of correcting my drink. But then it took 45 minutes to get our food. We had 3 young girls ages ranging between 6 and 10, who became very agitated as they were hungry. But then the food arrived and two of us got the wrong orders. It was tasty just executed poorly. I probably will come back as I hope this was just an enigma of events. And I will be more than happy to change my review because I have high hopes for this place."}
{"text":"I really want this place to work out since there have been a handful of failed restaurants that  have come and gone in that location and I really would love to see a local business succeed.  We've been here three times and the burgers are always really good however the service is always painfully slow.   Skip the other non-burger stuff because they're just ok - stick with their specialty burgers and you'll always have a great meal. Besides being very slow, the wait staff can have a bit of an attitude too - they're not rude but you can tell they're just not happy to be there.  If service was better, we'd come here more often as it is just two blocks from our house."}
{"text":"I have to say that I really like the new location cross from where I work. I Went there for lunch today with couple of my friends and we all enjoyed it. 
The food was fantastic and our waitress was very kind. No much wait wait the food was prepared on time.

{"text":"Just tried this place for the first time this past Sunday. It was a great place to watch football, not to mention awesome food and very attentive service. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I tried the Cold beers @ cheeseburger in Arcadia and wasn't too impressed, burger was ok but not juicy , I should have tried the Stand."}
{"text":"Decent food, a great beer selection, but there were flies everywhere.

Complimentary valet parking is nice because this lot has always been crowded. We got a variety of food including appetizers, burgers and mac and cheese. Very standard restaurant fare - nothing amazing, but nothing terrible.

The flies and other bugs were the most annoying thing."}
{"text":"We tried cbc for lunch on Sunday. Pretty busy. We were seated immediately. Waitress  came quickly for our drink order. 2 ultra lights drafts. I ordered prime rib dip and upcharge 2$ for onion rings, my husband the cheeseburger sliders. Food came at reasonable time. We both enjoyed our food. Onion rings delicious and crisp, good season. Just not enough of them especially for an additional 2$. My entree was 17$, my husbands 11$, 3 sliders no side. 4$ a beer, we had 2 each. 47$ total. I think this a bit pricey. Outback has cheaper prime rib sandwich. Waitress was pleasant. The have a lot of tv's, no matter where you sit. I guess that's what we're paying for."}
{"text":"Been here twice so far. The first time I was with a group of six. Our food took over an hour and was cold when served. All of us agreed our stomach hurt after. 

I gave it a second shot tonight and it was worse. My burger came out with a bunch of mayo and thousand island ALL OVER. I couldn't believe they actually served it to me that way. The server had to take it back and get new buns for the burger. Mac n cheese was very dry. 

Over all both experiences were not impressive. Food isn't good and also over priced. My stomach hurt both times after eating. It's an extremely loud environment even if there aren't any games on. My friends and I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Not great but not horrible either. Too expensive for the food they serve. Service is hit or miss. They play country music after 10."}
{"text":"Meh. Just meh. Good ambience but below average food. Don't go here if you're looking for rich, tasty burgers. They're kinda plain. Had the mac n cheese burger and had hoped it was gonna taste amazing.  It was boring. Cooked perfectly but I had to add green chiles, onions, and hot sauce to make it halfway decent. Otherwise it wouldn't have been worth eating. Not for $14 for 1 burger. If you want GREAT burgers, there are better spots."}
{"text":"This was my second visit to a CB & CB and my first to the Gilbert location.  Both experiences were the same - the menu sounds awesome but they fail to execute on that awesomeness...leaving you disappointed with nothing more than an average burger (and hotdog from this visit). Also, be aware that all entrees come with chips and it's a $2 up charge to get fries, onion rings, etc. I tried the tater tots...which were hot and crispy but entirely too salty. Otherwise, a great spot to catch a game as they have an abundance of TVs throughout and a good beer/cocktail list."}
{"text":"I normally enjoy here, except today was miserable.. The fly problem was out of control .. I couldn't even finish my meal.. I was to busy shoeing the flies away from our table. I couldn't wait to leave.."}
{"text":"Been to this place a few times and each time the drinks and food was very good. Just went a week ago on a Saturday and had another fun great experience. Jesse our bartender was awesome and looking forward to the upcoming football season. Will be the place to watch all the games."}
{"text":"Our food took about an hour which was unacceptable. One of the burgers that was ordered MW came out WWWW and we had another burger that was ordered with a slice of raw onion. It came with two little pieces of onion. The manager (Todd) came by and asked how our food was. We told him and he was very accommodating. He brought out some onion and offered to replace the over cooked burger but we declined as we didn't want to wait any longer. A little bit later he brought out a bowl of mac n cheese because he felt bad that my girlfriend didn't eat very much. Todd made our bad experience positive. He went above and beyond and I hope that he gets recognition for it. If I owned a restaurant I would definitely hire him as a GM! On a side note, our server was very busy but she was friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"I love the food at this place! The burgers are on par with rehab burger in Tempe but have different offerings. The beer selection is great but a bit pricy. I think the location drives up the cost of the food there but then the great taste and atmosphere makes it worth it. Also, the waitresses know the menu and beer selection well from my experience. While the cholesterol from the food slows down your heart the waitresses will keep your heart rate going ... with their looks ... it ain't that kind of place...."}
{"text":"I've always really liked this place and it always comes up whenever someone talks about getting a beer someplace to hang out... good food (burgers and hot dogs are pretty killer - get the tots), service is attentive and friendly, and the value is there... my only complaint is that it's a bit off the beaten track for me, though I can totally see it being a regular place for me if I lived in the immediate area. 

Recommend sitting at the bar or on the patio, if you go..."}
{"text":"In all my past visits the service and food have always been top notch. I have to say I was disappointed this trip. Service was mediocre and the Cobb salad that I always order had some very dark brown rotten pieces in it. I passive aggressively picked them out and laid them on a clean appetizer plate for the server to acknowledge.... but she didn't notice, even though we were her only table. Guess it just depends on the day...."}

SKIP. Up-charge for fries. That's hilarious."}
{"text":"This is a bells and whistles place. Unfortunately I do not prescribe to their obvious attempt to extract every cent they can conjure up from business school out of your wallet and into the hands of people who know that if they create an environment conducive to feeling great, it doesn't matter that they charge you extra for fries. Since I can remember, burgers come with fries.  Strategy has worked and business is good.  Scottsdale is in the house everyone. 

Environment 4 Food 3.5 Value .5
Skip this and avoid or love it.  You love this place if somebody else is paying. You scratch your head when it's on the block. 

I'm here for game 7 of the World Series. If you like this place then good for you. Overpriced, mediocre burgers and this is #5. If you like this place, I don't like you."}
{"text":"After getting off to a rocky start with seating we have enjoyed our meal here. My husband had the blue bacon burger and the sweet potato tots. He thought the burger was one of the best he's ever had and will come back again for the tots.

Trying to do weight watchers I chose the veggie burger and salad with the hummas add on. Both were excellent. I used the hummas on the burger so no extra points.

Their beer selection is extensive if you are ok with cans and bottles. But pretty good selection on tap too. The wine is actually better than your usual beer place. The liberty cab was $10. Not horrible.

Sports bar feel with large TVs everywhere.

I give them points for service recovery after we made our concerns known. Many young people will just avoid you. The manager and server were both apologetic and came by the table several times to check on us.  But not too much."}
{"text":"16 people. Birthday celebration. No reservation. The staff at CBCB made it work, in very little time, and with a smile. It was trivia night, to boot! I love this place; customer service counts in the service industry, and the team working here know it, and it shows. 

And, they have my favorite beer, College Street's Big Blue Van!"}

{"text":"Decor is same as the previous Bar \"Tailgaters\" but has more TV's. Food is just ok but way overpriced. We ordered a burger, chicken sliders and 2 drinks and out the door for $50. We were not impressed and probably will not return."}
{"text":"Chintzy Overcooked Burgers is a better name for this place. Quality has declined and it's sad because they used to be really good. Great TVs just don't expect a great burger."}
{"text":"I kept hearing wonderful things about this place, and popped in on a Monday night. It looked pretty crowded so we sat at the bar thinking we would have quicker service, but it took 40 minutes to get our food from the time we ordered and when our food made its way to us it wasn't hot. In my opinion the burgers are overpriced for what you get, and the service is sub par. Needless to say, I won't be coming here again."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch. Only bad thing was parking. Lots of businesses around so for all businesses in this area parking is bad. I had the juicy Lucy. Cooked to order - a perfect medium. No need for condiments. Each element made it a very good burger. Also best tater tots. Next time I try the totchos."}
{"text":"Will not be back.

Had a coupon from a school coupon booklet. Came in for the first time last week. Coupon said a free appetizer (up to $8)... there is only ONE appetizer for under $8 here. This seems extremely overpriced for a bar and for the area... Most meals, including burgers were $12+. Upcharge for anything other than chips with your meal. Many, many employees yet very slow service. Burger was overcooked and dry (asked for medium), pretzel was no better than that at a snack shack. Cheese to dip pretzel is was very thick and overall disgusting. Can you tell I'm not impressed?? Happy hour prices even were expensive ($8 burgers, $6.50 pretzels)

Overall, would not recommend for any reason. Two stars for being a clean restaurant and for volunteering to be on the school card."}
{"text":"The wait staff is excellent, friendly, clear concise and very active.    Great TV set up, large, clear and plenty of them.  The patio is clean and has good space to lounge even when the place is full with a waiting line. 

The issue I had was paying $12 for a Par-Cooked burger, I ordered my burger med rare and by the time it was reheated I had a medium and the center was cold.  I expected a fresh ground, cooked to order burger..  On a good note, the salad is fresh and the fries were freshly cooked."}
{"text":"I have been eagerly awaiting the opening of this location for many months. Being extremely excited I went with my wife to sit at the bar late (about 10:30) Saturday night. While the place was busy, it was by no means packed. We easily found a couple seats at the bar and at the bar we sat for 10-15 minutes before we were greeted and a drink order taken. My wife's drink came quickly but mine (a diet coke) took another 20 minutes and 3 times asking to receive. I asked for a menu. Although I got the menu quickly, it was another 30 minutes before the bartender came back to take the order. The sliders we ordered came out fairly quickly and were fairly good but getting a second drink order and the bill took actually getting up from my seat and chasing down the inattentive bartender. 

Unfortunately our second trip on Sunday afternoon with our kids was no better. When we arrived we were told that there was a 20 minute wait even though there were 5-6 tables that were visibly empty. We waited over 20 minutes and when we asked about the wait we were told that they were having trouble getting tables bussed. After another 25 minutes and more inquiry were finally seated at a patio table that had been empty since our arrival 45 minutes prior. After being seated we waited another 20 minutes with no contact from a server. Finally after going to the bar and asking for some service we got someone to take our drink order. She explained that she was not our waitress but could get us drinks while we waited for our server. After receiving our drinks we told the \"temporary\" waitress that we could wait no longer and asked her to please take our food order. After that our service improved somewhat but all burgers, although ordered medium rare and medium, were delivered well done. Not wanting to turn this 2 and a half hour lunch into an even longer excursion, we didn't complain, paid our bill and left.

My feeling is that they are dreadfully understaffed and not yet well trained. At least that is my hope. I  live half a mile from this location and want it to be a regular stop. Sadly with Zipps and Tailgaters both within a reasonable distance and both being less expensive, just as delicious and having better service I think this location has a lot of improvement to make if they expect continued success after the novelty of the grand opening has worn off."}
{"text":"Who doesn't love a great burger and a cold brew, right??  First off, the mozzarella sticks tasted like they were freezer burned and very bland.  The burger I ordered was supposed to be medium-well, but was SO over cooked and dry. The outside of the burger was charred pretty badly too. I've had a great experience at the Scottsdale location, but this location was a total let down. Very bummed considering I live pretty close and was hoping for another great restaurant on 7th street.  The reason I'm giving 2 stars instead of 1 is because the server was attentive and the draft beer was great. Otherwise, a very underwhelming experience. Hopefully they improve the quality of the food or I'm betting this place will be closed within a year."}

I will never go back to this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Went here for the grilled drumettes, well find out that they're not really grilled. They are put in the fryer to start and then finished on the grill. HELLO, that's not grilled, just because you place something on a grill for two minutes doesn't make it grilled, they are fried wings, extremely misleading on the menu. The waitress didn't really know for sure how the wings were cooked. The manager decides to come over and make things worse, by talking to us like we are dumb. He couldn't say anything except well they are put on a grill and said you can't expect us to grill them completely it would take over 30 minutes. Well saying your own menu says they are grilled, yes I do expect them to be grilled. Do you deep fat fry your grilled chicken sandwich? You need to change the description or actually start grilling the wings."}
{"text":"This place is always busy.  But when u want a burger and shake this is a place to go.  We ordered:
1) Buffalo chicken sliders - very good but a little spicy for our 9 year old.  So we also ordered a kids corn dog meal.  
2) Beef Dip - very good.  
3) cheddar burger - medium well came out medium and they offered to redo the burger.   If came well done, still not bad!  Artisan bun was a good choice.
A few snags with service but corrected quickly and manager took good care of us.  1 star down for service issues.  Waiting 10 minutes for silverware and napkins food got cold is all."}
{"text":"Great Food. Great Atmosphere. Enjoyable time. I had a build your own chicken sandwich on a GF bun and tots. It was great. Husband had an American Burger, no burger remained on his plate. Thursday's are kids eat free. So, our kids had Mac and Cheese and a grilled cheese. Also, enjoyed the amazing Brownie Sunday. All for $60 and we enjoyed a COLD BEER (or two) as well."}

{"text":"This review is being written while my food and drink are literally being swarmed with flies. I've never seen anything like it. Yes, the weather is beautiful and yes they have all their doors and windows open. But the sheer number of flies buzzing around inside is ridiculous. And there appears to be no effort made to help alleviate the problem. The food is decent enough. The beer selection is good. But no person should ever have to dine with this many flies landing in their food, straws and on every surface at the table."}
{"text":"Came with a large party for a birthday on a Tuesday .  Starter with an Order of the mozzarella stix bc I have been craving them! They were good-I'm talking when you rip them in half the cheese follows good!  

Main dish was the hot and smokey Mac and cheese! It was yummy- larger pasta noodles then the typical and the cheese sauce wasn't too runny where it was watery! Nice flavor from the spicy jalape√±o! BF got the French dip- he said it was juicy and tender but I found it a bit salty with the au jus sauce.  Friend ordered the PB AND J burger and said it was delish! 

Only down fall was service felt it was a bit slow for our server come back and check on us! I get it we're a big party but it wasn't very crowded. Server dos honor the 10% off help check in which was nice!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere definitely needed something like this place in the area. Good food and beer and a great patio"}
{"text":"Good service, clean and a nice place to watch a game. They have an excellent beer menu and a wide variety of burgers. I just wish their food wasn't so salty."}
{"text":"Ok just finished a little dinner with the wife. Had to come see what the hype was about. Very very good.. server Katelyn did a amazing job on answering the menu and helping my wife out. Very good will be back for sure"}
{"text":"We finally came to try this place out.  Our waitress was great and we were very happy with service. The managers were walking around, greeting people and serving food which was nice to see.  The wings were so good, we ordered a second round. Great place, we will come back soon!"}
{"text":"The food was absolutely AMAZING!! However, once the lunch rush came in, the service was a bit slow. I chose to make my own burger. This allowed me to add everything I wanted, while leaving out the things I didn't. The restaurant has a good amount of outside seating that is cooled by misters.
I plan to go back and enjoy a juicy burger again!"}
{"text":"Happy Hour is a good time to go to Cold Beer and Cheeseburgers with the family. The atmosphere is lively enough that if you have a baby or toddler with you that is feeling a little fussy, it won't be noticed by the other patrons, but it's NOT so lively that it feels like a party atmosphere... at least not during happy hour. I have seen the place in the evenings and it does look pretty crowded.

The burgers are very good and many of them are on the creative side.... AND yes, the beer is cold . They have a decent selection of craft beers . I prefer to go with the Four Peaks variety."}
{"text":"Took several minutes before our server arrived. She took our drink and appetizer order. A little slow in arriving. Then she took our dinner order and after 5 minutes or so came back to our table and asked us to read her writing on her order pad!  We reminded her what we ordered. We eventually received our order. The French dip sandwich was horrible - the meat was chewy and the bread was hard. My chili dog was awful and over cooked. The tater tots and sodas were good though."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. The cheap dopes out there that are complaining about the price all seem to have ordered custom burgers with expensive ingredients. This place is excellent. It has a great selection of beers, it had excellent Mac and cheese, incredible burgers, great appetizers, and the tots are really good. My kids had fries and chicken tenders. The food has always come out hot and well prepared. They have a great wait staff and this place is definitely worth any wait you may have."}
{"text":"I was very excited to see that a CBCB was opening in Glendale, but my first experience was pretty disappointing. They were busy, but not nearly busy enough to make up for the long waits and lack of service."}
{"text":"This is definitely not my favorite location! I frequently go to the location off of Deer valley. I always end up choosing the Juicy Lucifer. That burger is delicious! However, not at this location! We ordered the burger to be medium it came well done and tasted burnt! This burger is supposed to be stuffed with cheese; however, the cheese was extremely watery and hardly stuffed! No one likes watery cheese! We let our waitress know and she seemed not to really care and said oh maybe they overcooked it... thank you captain obvious! I will not go back to this location!"}
{"text":"Was greeted by friendly hosts, offered a drink right as I sat down, and checked on by 3 bartenders! Great service as always"}
{"text":"Not impressed. Burger was dry, tater tots were cold, onion rings so salty could barely eat them. It tasted like it was made at lunch hour and left under a heat lamp until dinner time."}
{"text":"Great family restaurant! The buffalo chicken tot chos are AMAZING! Since I'm not a red meat person, i get the turkey burger and it is pretty impressive. The chips they make they are really good too. Glad to have this place in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Really great place awesome menu lots of choices burgers are excellent fast service served with a friendly smile a for sure deal!"}
{"text":"The food and service was good.  The chips with the sandwiches rock.   But I tend to agree with some of the other reviews that for lunch, it's a bit overpriced.  Although, it did taste very fresh, so I don't mind paying a bit more for quality.  But the meat isn't 100% organic grass fed, which is what I would expect at this price point."}
{"text":"Newest opening of this chain in central Phoenix.  Parking not the easiest, but the valet does work.  Clean, bright, plenty of TVs, nice bar, and good burgers.  However beware the side order add-on.  When asked what side we'd like with our burgers, our group selected either fries or tater tots believing they \"came with.\"  They don't.  Customers should know this up front.  Tab for a single and yes, cold beer, one soda, two waters, 4 burgers was north of $80.  Bring your wallet."}
{"text":"As my Yelp reviews will illustrate I rarely review restaurant chains. There are a few exceptions but not many.    

However, CB&C always has great food and great service.  And if you enjoy sports they must have 50 HD Tvs! However, tonight it was 55 minutes between my order and the arrival of my meal!  Nothing special (a double turkey burger and slaw).  In fairness they were very busy. My complaint is that it took so long to recognize the oversight. 

Also, in fairness they offered to cover my drinks which I declined.  Not fair to punish the server because the kitchen messes up. Also, I have a say my bartender/server was great.  How do you not like a nice lady named Liberty!

I'll be back soon but I've come to expect much better overall service."}
{"text":"Always amazing. This is a great spot for drinks, food, and sports."}
{"text":"Hate to vent on here, but just had one of the worst customer service experiences at Cold Beer and Cheeseburgers in Gilbert, AZ.

First and VERY LAST time we will visit Cold Beers & Cheeseburgers in Gilbert, AZ.   Waited 1.5 hours for our waitress to even come back to check on us. She never even filled up water or let us know there was a delay. We were there with a 2 year old, so already on a time crunch.   Finally told her we needed to go and box it up.
#terriblecustomerservice #trainyourstaff"}
{"text":"New hot-spot in the area. The food and service was awesome. I understand that it's new so a lot of people are coming to check it out. TVs are large and everywhere. Perfect for sports games or happy hour!"}
{"text":"Hence the name it's a given that the beers are cold... and they definitely are colder than your average bar. Every time I go here I ask myself the same damn question... why can't all bars have beer this cold?? Great beer selection, great burgers, lots of games on and great atmosphere."}
{"text":"I had the Bleu cheese burger and chips. It was a good burger and very fresh bun. It got a little messy and harder to eat as I progressed. We sat out on the patio to escape the noise inside. It would have been hard to carry on a conversation inside with the tall industrial ceilings. It was a beautiful evening and our server was very personable. Overall, it was a fun place to eat for a meal and they had no problem with us hanging out longer after our meal with friends was done."}
{"text":"I did not have high expectations of this place. The big winner was the food. They have a creative selection burgers that are huge and well made. Cooked to order. Fries and tots were also delicious.

The decor is typical sports bar. Lots of TVs to watch the games. Service was fair, at best. Beer selection was OK. A bit more that Bud & Coors. Not an expansive selection, but decent."}
{"text":"We had a networking mixer at this location on 9/6/17. We had about 30 attendees on the patio. We had great service by all the staff including management. I was exceptionally impressed with our cocktail server who said she was new, ticket says Betty? I asked a couple different questions during the night and whenever she didn't have an answer she said \"I will find out and be back\". She did come back with answer. 
The Happy Hour food was good and well presented. All of my attendees were also happy which is rare... We will be back next month for another mixer. I will definitely recommend this location."}
{"text":"What a great new place! My husband and I went in for lunch today and the food was so fresh and yummy. The atmosphere is right up our alley! We'll be coming often!"}
{"text":"BEWARE!  Just graced this place with my presence and WOW!  Don't let the name fool you. Cold Beer & Cheeseburgers, Gilbert, is just a chain restaurant riding the craft beer and craft burger wave. That's right, just another Applebees or Chili's with a \"somewhat\" better beer selection at RIDICULOUS prices. Don't get me wrong...I wasn't first looking at prices and the burger was good. Beer selection was kind of disappointing, with subpar-craft brands that you can pick up at any local grocery store. If you're looking to spend $70 on an OK burger and (3) subpar beers, have your limo driver pull into Cold Beer & Cheeseburgers, because they will be more than happy to steal your money."}
{"text":"Massively huge selection of burgers done anyway you like it including hollowed out ones with cheese and sauces. Great freshly made fries, tots, and onion rings.  These burgers are very filling and the the food pairs well with a huge beer and liquor list plus a lot of young beautiful people."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner Friday night. Waitress was alright but it took forever to get our food. We asked the manager about our food and he quoted our wait time from when the waitress entered our order without any concern for when we actually gave her our order. When the food finally came my burger was overdone, dry, and without flavor. I ate a quarter of the burger and left the rest. Even after I told the waitress it was overdone the manager never came to the table, even though he passed our table multiple times doing his rounds. He  preferred to credit us for two burgers and send us on our way to never return. Free burgers don't make up for poor service from the manager and lack of concern."}
{"text":"I've been here three times and the service is always slow and the food is average. In the most recent visit, the kitchen made an error on my entree and failed to correct it... twice. I wont be back."}
{"text":"Really really bad service. Sunday evening, not a lot of people and I have been waiting for 20 minutes for the waiter. Food was good though. I'd go back."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere.   Dog friendly and fun.  Tater tots are amazing and crunchy.  Burgers are big and juicy. And when you're not that hungry they have great salads and asparagus.   Oh and awesome Bloody Mary bar !!"}
{"text":"Rude hostesses and waitresses. Food looked pretty tasty. Too bad from the moment we walked in we got attitude from the hostess and then the wait staff, so bad I will not return."}
{"text":"Fantastic service, food, and beverage. Always have a great time when I come in. Liberty the bartender was great."}
{"text":"I called this place at 12:15 am to ask what time the kitchen stopped serving. The person who answered put me on hold and said she would find out. She said the stop at 12:45am. We got there at 12:25. As we were sitting, a staff member walked by. I have her eye contact twice while she was talking to a close by table. By 12:29, someone finally came to us and said that last call for food was at 12:30. Then the bartender yells \"last call.\"  My gripe is that after I was told on the phone that kitchen closed at 12:45 & we would get served if we got there before then. We were ignored until 12:30 in a very slow place. The server offered to ask her manager if they can serve us. Too late! I want to give this place a chance but they didn't give us a chance."}
{"text":"My response to the owners comments---
Comment from Alecia S. of Cold Beers & Cheeseburgers  
 Business Owner 
 12/14/2017 * 
 Matt,
We're so sorry your experience at Cold Beers & Cheeseburgers wasn't stellar. We do happy hour from 3-6 PM Monday through Friday if you wanted to come get Domestic Bottles for $4! We hope you give us another chance soon. Cheers. 
Alecia S.- every review says the same thing so let me summarize for EVERYONE. It's too LOUD, food take too LONG (often cold), and you are OVERPRICED. Also, in all of your replies you never acknowledge any complaints; simply saying \"sorry for your experience (sic)\" tells me you read to respond but not to react. As the owner you should listen to the people that spend the time to give you free and direct feedback to improve your business, create a plan, and act.

{"text":"The place is good but the fly infestation was disgusting ... dozens on the windows ... dive bombing food and people"}
{"text":"My Fist impression was not good, I sat at the bar for ten minutes waiting to be served or at least asked how can I help you. Literally about 8 people at the bar and that's including outside bar and the bartenders wasn't making any drinks or anything. I ordered a buffalo chicken sandwich which I'm waiting on now. The three stars is for the third bartender who came behind the bar and finally asked what did I want to order."}
{"text":"Delicious burger and fries. We ordered the Citrus teriyaki wings too.... they were awesome!! We went during game time so the wait was a little longer, but the service was good. Thank you Alexis.... I'll definitely be coming back again."}
{"text":"Great burgers and super original styles. Very chill neighborhood joint. Perfect for watching a game, hang with friends, or a quick bite with the family.  The service is also a big plus. Big smiles and on top of their game."}
{"text":"Food was okay. Beer menu was mediocre and organized poorly. The service was great. Our server was helpful and knowledgable. The bar tender explained they could not salt the rim of my draft dos Equis because the salt would make the beer foam over--like it's not possible to half a salted rim on a dos Equis--so brought my salt on the side. Not is possible. Surprised me to know a bartender did not know that. Place isn't kid friendly--burgers weren't awesome (pretty messy and the bbq sauce was sweet in bad ways). Nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"The food is iffy and the service was not the best. It is also not family friendly so if you come here with a ton of kids that is a bad idea. It is also loud so if you come here for a meeting then you won't be able to hear anything anyone is saying. The food took forever to come and was not the best. Also my dad got a beer and they were out of five of the beers.Also the chefs were six tickets behind and our waitress said that they didn't know what was on the burgers. Also we had to wait 45 minutes to get seated. We didn't get our food and we have already been waiting for like  an hour. The kitchen has a grill that could hold like 32 hamburgers and it's like they are only making like 5 at a time.  But then our food finally came out after 1 hour and 15 minutes and it was ok. My experience was not the best"}
{"text":"I walked in the door and a guy walked up to the register with a Coldbeer logo tshirt that I assumed meant he worked there and he looked right at me turned around and sauntered back into the kitchen.  I guess greeting customers was not in his job scope.  I had ordered a to go sandwich and just wanted to pay for it but there was no one at the entrance so I waited a couple of minutes when a girl who looked less than professional in a tank top and shorts and messy appearance came up to the register and honestly said nothing.  I had to ask her if she worked there and got a curt yes.  I asked if the bag in front of me was my to go order, obviously she was not going to offer any assistance.  By the look on her face she was not happy to be there.  I then told her it took me over 40 minutes to place my order because the line was busy.  She told me it was an issue with my phone and that they had been getting calls.  Hard to believe.  I thanked her for being rude and paid my bill.  $19. for a mediocre French dip and poor service as well. I don't understand how any owner would allow this behavior not if they want return customers. You have a lot of competition in uptown and that's where I will be."}
{"text":"Relaxed, come-as-you-are atmosphere, great burgers, and huge beer list. This place is a local favorite. They're doing so well new ones keep poppin' up in the Valley (the newest location is on Shea and 116th St.)

We got the mozzarella sticks because they're great and they're made in the traditional manner, which is what I want when I eat mozzarella  sticks (nothin overly fancy or deconstructed). For those that read my reviews, I 
am gf but go off the wagon on occasion bc a) I'm human and b) sometimes a wheat product is just worth the headache and internal damage. These mozzarella sticks are worth it to me!

Tonight I got the ring of fire burger- it was cooked perfectly and was incredibly flavorful. My son's salad with chicken was fresh. I think they make their own potato chips here and they're wonderful. Crunchy, slightly thick- yum!

The service can be a little slow at times but they are always friendly and helpful. The patio is my favorite as the inside makes me feel a little claustrophobic unless I'm at the bar.

All around great American comfort food in our neighborhood - can't get better than that!"}
{"text":"This place is so much more then a burger joint.  Great selection of beers, wonderful place to watch sports and the macaroni and cheese is too die for!"}
{"text":"Nice beer selection, good cocktails, and good burgers. The build your own Mac and Cheese is a great idea and tastes great. Good local place to watch football as well. 

Our server Justin was really nice and attentive. The service was excellent. I've come a few times for late drinks and it's been a good time."}
{"text":"We were here on Wednesday evening for happy hour. This was the 1st time we have been here and the service was great, the food was great. We started with the hell fire chips which were spicy just as the name implies. Then we had the build your own burgers with unlimited toppings and these were fantastic. We had a great experience and will be back soon!"}
{"text":"We convinced some friends to join us, as we tried for a 3rd time for a decent experience.  I doubt they will ever come back, and after 3 strikes, not sure we will either.  What a shame.  Horrible, rude service.  A less-than customer service oriented manager, and par food for a high price.  No thanks."}
{"text":"I've been here for almost 2 hours- the waitress has only been to our table about three times and the check has been sitting here for 30 minutes. I have somewhere to be and asked for her to take it awhile ago. Disappointed 3/10 don't recommend"}
{"text":"Missed opportunity:  Cold Fries and Cheeseburgers is much more accurate.

Chain burger joint.  Feels like Buffalo Wild Wings.  Lots of TVs.  Overpriced bar food.  Slow service.

Came in and had a bite.  Ordered all american burger with cold fries.  The burger was good.  The fries were cold.  Also ordered overcooked chicken tenders with more cold fries.  The chicken was overcooked and the fries were cold.  

Ordered a Dont worry about making it Oreo shake.  The shake was forgotten about perfectly.

Four Peaks seems to be a big sponsor of this place.  #Sellouts #fakecraft

Highly doubt I would be back.  Unless I am in the mood for slow service, cold fries, overcooked chicken strips, overpriced bar food, fake craft beer, and forgotten shakes.  

You never know."}
{"text":"Well stopped in and tired this place out was very impressed with the food and the wait staff.. Ashley was are server she was very helpful with the question we had. So if your ever in the neighborhood and want a good burger stop by.."}
{"text":"Really like the changes made to the place since prior place. More than enough TV's. Service is typically good. The hostess team always seem a bit arrogant. Our last couple of visits we had a couple of burgers delivered rare when we ordered them med well. Seems to be over priced for burgers."}
{"text":"Checked out CBCB on a Saturday evening. Luckily we beat the rush and got a table immediately. Plenty of TVs to watch sports. Menu was full of what seemed like appetizing dishes. I chose the Ring of Fire burger and my wife got the BLT. My boys got the kids burger and hot dog, but there was nothing to keep them entertained like coloring pages. My burger was good and spicy just as advertised. Our waitress, Bree, was awesome. Very cheerful and stopped frequently to make sure we had what we needed. I would go back to this place."}
{"text":"Good food, and our server HANNAH at the chandler location was great. Thanks girl.
Noah liked you a lot too. Nice tits."}
{"text":"We are frequent visitors, burgers always good. But management should know that being greeted by cleaning rags at the hostess counter is yucky and having to wait to be greeted when its not that busy is annoying. The rags were still there when we left. Come on Hector, you know better."}
{"text":"Tried pretty much every burger on the menu and come here at least once a week. Recommend juicy Lucy or there newer one the juicy Lucy-fee. Also the original tot-chos! They are AWESOME!!!!"}
{"text":"\"I would like a cold beer (Bud Light) in one of your coffee mug beer glass things and a cheeseburger (as rare as possible because I'm a man)\" - Train

\"that will be $60.00\" - Waitress

\"I'll see myself out\" - Train"}
{"text":"Stopped in here to eat while we are here. And I have to say the food is good but I didn't like the service there the girls were not very nice to us and didn't come check on us as much as we would have liked. Our drinks only got filled once while we were here we left and went across the street to chick-fil-a and got drinks."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, sports bar like. Food is pricey but it is good.  I was here for the first time about 2 months ago. It was off to a bad start it was very busy. We had to wait 10 minutes to get greeted by server, so manager had to flag her down. I suspect she wasn't happy with us I sensed her being very sarcastic with us but then calmed down and everything was great after that."}
{"text":"Shout out to my girl Hannah first it was her smile when she introduced herself then her personality just threw it all together it was my first experience at this restaurant and the service was fantastic equal to their food I will definitely be returning thank you Hannah"}
{"text":"Ordered the steakhouse truffle burger with onion rings. Amazing. Hubby got the wings he was happy but burger was way better Staff was also amazing.  Seated immediately and waitress Gabby was over almost immediately to take drink orders.  Once she knew we were checking it out because they were opening an Arrowhead location, Gabby sent over Todd to talk to us.  super nice.  Can't wait for the Arrowhead location to open in Sept."}
{"text":"I came here for my birthday 2 years in a row. Andrea was my server. Food was great but the service was phenomenal. Everyone from the hostess to the other girls working were so friendly and accommodating. I love this place!"}
{"text":"Wow, this place is a disaster. I can't decide if the service or the food itself is the worst part of this restaurant. I gave it one star because it has an excellent choice of beers on tap. If you're going to come here, just drink and plan on packing a lunch."}
{"text":"Cold beers and Cheeseburgers is amongst the brand spanking new buildings on Chauncey road and North Scottsdale Road. The design of the restaurant has the atmosphere of a classy bar with lots of good natural light. 

We came here for the grand opening celebration where they served 500 free cheeseburgers. Even at that volume, they provided with a high quality burger. The meat was well marinate and it was obvious. The staff was kind and the manger had introduced himself. They also gave out $5 gift cards that caused me to leave only in smiles."}
{"text":"Danggggg. Arizona has some burger game. This is up there with zinburger and hopdoddy. 

I went to cold beer & cheese burger on a Friday night and the place was packed. There was no wait for us though. The servers were kind enough to not rush us. There is a parking garage within walking distance. 

Their burgers are unique. I got the bacon bleu with an egg. If you haven't had an egg on your burger before, try it before you doubt it. From the very first bite, you can tell the meat is well seasoned. The burger is big and I actually took half of it home. Great as leftover too! Though I didn't drink, I saw that they have a great beer selection as well."}
{"text":"This has been my 5th visit since it opened, it will be my final. The only reason it gets 2 stars is because of the great beer selection and Tv's. However the food, horrible. Worst turkey burger I have ever had. Service is hit or miss, usually a miss. I find it frustrating to see servers on their phones when customers have not been helped. Parmesan fries  were hard as a rock. Burger was taken off check but not offered anything else. I promptly requested my bill and left.  Big fail food  wise."}
{"text":"So the food was an upgrade from Tailgators, but the decorations ( not much changed ) are the same except for a few more TV's. Also allows e-cigarettes at the outside portion of the bar which is wrong but the bartender's didn't seem to care. Note much better than Tailgators so don't know how long it will last!"}
{"text":"Went there last Saturday. Did not feel like they had only been open for a day. The ambiance was fun. The buffalo potato chips were bomb and so were the mozzarella cheese sticks. The hot wings were a good size and the prices were reasonable. The rest of the food looked amazing, my fiend ordered the cheeseburger pictured. They have soo many beers on tap. Been craving to go back all week! Hope that the wait won't be too long but with how great they are doing I think it'll still be an hour or so."}
{"text":"Went here with my girlfriends who were craving burgers after a long hike... and it did not disappoint!

Everyone ordered something different and ALL were raving about their meal. I had the turkey burger, trying to be a little healthier, and it was just as good as the beef. 

Will definitely be going back with my family!"}
{"text":"Pretty decent burgers, good ingredients, I like the fried egg option on a burger...very good.

My only beef (sorry) with this place is the price, it's a little steep for a burger...but then again most places these days overcharge. 13 bucks for a burger is nuts. For two people to eat with tip and tax it's like 40-50 bucks. You can decide if that price is worth it for fast casual burger joint food.

I like how the servers and staff are not forced to wear flair and corporate junk, they have tats and colored hair, and I like that! It's definitely not a corporate boring chain, they have a small business kind of atmosphere, but corporate prices...that's life.

Decent place to get a burger and a drink, just know it's not gonna be super cheap. Overall an okay option."}
{"text":"Awesome to have a place like this on the Northwest side. Food was good for being the second day open and they have many beers available. Kinda pricey for non domestic beers though, I mean $7.50 for a Hoogarden"}
{"text":"Five dollar off coupons are all over the place - your yelp offer, also in magazines and newspapers and since the manager admitted that the home office screwed up, you can use these coupons at Happy Hour. So, the $7.50 all-american burger at HH becomes a real bargain at that point. It is a very solid burger as well, this one has no bells and whistles, just cheese and lettuce, etc. It would only be at the $10 price point when they start to get fancier and more creative. The buns here are quite fresh, the burger is a pretty good size at 1/2 pound and they cooked it right on the first try. I ordered the chips and those were crunchy and several were double-folded, which is a good thing. This location became 100% dead at 8pm and i had the bar to myself. The outside part of the bar though was poorly designed to watch TV as you can see all the screens on the far wall, but they are kinda far awy to concentrate on the games. Sit at inside bar to enjoy games. Friendly service and manager and quick service were also appreciated. I think I have tried tried half the stuff on this menu, mostly in Old Town, and they always get things right and tasty."}
{"text":"Truthfully we were so excited for this restaurant to come in to our neighborhood. However after visiting a few times we learned slow service and inaccurate orders is the expectations. We move food and agree extremely patient but this place pushes the boundaries for what we think is the majority of patience levels. Recommend if planning to watch a game that's is prime time and you plan to eAt at half time."}
{"text":"Friends brought me here. 

Cons: No pitchers of beer. Only buckets, and that's no deal. 
A big oil can of Fosters was $7.00 no shrimp with that mate!
PBR was the best value at $4.00. Thank you Sir, may I have another?
Dos XX comes in at 6.50 for draft. 
You can see how this all adds up right? 
They had a \"special\" going on Sunday afternoon; Jack Daniels lemonade and while it was a good pour it was $9.00 hardly a special in my broke ass book!  
My Pastrami burger came in at $15.50 and I upgraded with Onion Rings for $2.00 extra making that $17.50!! Chicken Fingers were a good value at $9.50 and the Staple Mac n Cheese rang in at $10.50 and was just ok. 

Natalie was our server and was somewhat indifferent and forgot the ranch dressing even though we reminded her twice. I guess when management decides to add 18% for a tip for 6 peeps the server just thinks, \"I got this one in the bag\" and STOPS trying right? Right! I would have tipped you more Natalie had you tried a little harder to smile and engage the customers. I guess familiarity breeds contempt when the table is filled with \"regulars\" sometimes.   

The food was just ok for $15.50 for my pastrami burger I was expecting to get hooked up but they fell short on my expectation.

All the food was salty and I do mean salty, the onions rings, the sweet tater tots. I know it's done to encourage thirst and consumption of more beer. 

Pros:
The patio and \"many, many\" TV Screens to watch sports. As someone in the Oval Office would say. 

 So bottom line this place is just OK."}
{"text":"First time there.   Burger was great, fries were cold, the server she didn't miss a beat. Scooped them up and replaced ASAP.  Turn a potential problem into a great save."}
{"text":"This location is slowly going downhill.

I have been coming here regularly since they opened, at least 15 occasions, and this last visit will be my last. The trouble seems to be in how quickly the kitchen can get out orders. This past Saturday was busy, but not so busy there was a wait for a table. We grabbed a seat at the bar since a cold beer was the first order of business. We ordered two burgers using the check box \"build you own\" form and we waited. 

And waited. For 80 min.  No kidding. 

The bar tender was doing her best to avoid eye contact with anyone at the bar who had ordered food. She clearly knew the kitchen was in the weeds (it happens), but never once gave us an update or an apology for the wait.  Did come by to pour another round, but dashed off as soon as the glass hit the counter. 

She really missed an opportunity when a guy next to us had his onion rings finally come out, only to have the plate bumped during the handoff from the runner to the bar tender.  Several big rings hit the floor and she simply went on to deliver the remaining, much smaller, portion. No offer to fire another order.  The poor guy turned to me and said what was all that?  We'd both seen the whole thing happen. Turned out to be his first time there too.  Likely his last. 

Burgers were fine. Beer was cold. Fortunately, there are better options in the area. 

80 min. wait for a simple order is a pretty good sign the B Team was running the show that Saturday...

Bummer."}
{"text":"If I could give a review for their unique burger combos and the Tot-chos only, it would be a satisfactory four-star rating. But, since we are rating the establishment, the service and the overall experience it's a flat out two. 

Order the Tot-chos, half-portion, and that's all. Not because there isn't anything else on the menu exceptionally good, but that's all you'll need to satisfy you saturated fat craving. They are fantastic. So good, I'm ripping off their idea and make it at home for myself, because I probably won't come back again. 

Service as at a one star level and that is when the place is empty, I can't image what it is like if it's ever busy. Water tastes like it's reclaimed, have to ask for plates (twice), inattentive wait staff, waiters literally throwing menus on the table and what really boils my blood...having to wait over 10 minutes for my beer...bottled beer. 

This could be a really cool place if the owner paid a little attention to his business, lowered the prices a bit (it's on the high side for a beer and burgers place) and greatly improved their service. 

Pei Wei is right across their front door - it's healthier, cheaper and I've never wanted to punch one their waiters in the jaw. I'll keep it Asian."}
{"text":"Came here Monday night service was attentive and pours were amazing. So we came back tonight. First drink was served quickly. Then the wait came .... waiting .. waiting.. gave our order... its build your own burger night. We didn't have burgers. We just got caught up in the chaotic mess. Our food took way to long and wasn't a good temperature. Last round of drinks on them... to make up for the wait. Can't say we will be back."}
{"text":"Burgers were really tasty but the service was pretty substandard. We joined the waitlist from yelp (which you can only do once you are within a mile of the restaurant) and checked in when we got there. They told us it'd be about 25 minutes. After waiting 25 minutes, we checked back with the stand because they seemed to be seating people who arrived after us. They were like \"oh, we can seat you now.\" Once we were seated we waited another 20 minutes before finally being able to flag down a manager to get us water. She informed us she would get us a server. We waited even longer and then the manager came back to take our order. After that we got a server. It took us almost 2 hours before we were served water and burgers. We are really hoping this was just a badly organized night because the burgers were good. The tots were really tasty also. Fries were cold and not very crispy though."}
{"text":"So I came here for lunch after a long day and I was super excited because this was our first time here, everyone's burger at our party was pretty good. However I am doing the low-carb thing and my burger came out with nothing inside of it I had ordered the stuffed Burger the juicy Lucy. So I'm just disappointed and I tell my waitress So she. Says no problem and I'll get you a new one it's not supposed to be like that. It took another 30 minutes for that burger to come back out. My entire party was finish eating, so I didn't really even want it at that point. My waitress took offense to this and she reluctantly removed it from my bill. Now mind you have the service been good the whole time, I probably wouldn't have complained at all, but it was slow all afternoon everyone was complaining....so three stars for the four people at our table that we really like their food. -2 for the slow service and the unstuffed Burchet :("}
{"text":"This is a great spot! They have a great selection of beer and burgers. I've also had some other sandwich items and they've always been great. Our experience with service has always been friendly and we probably come once a week since we live so close! I would defiantly recommend. Looking to try something new? Try the Bacon PB &J burger. ;) yum!"}
{"text":"Nice selection of beer and the Rocky Point burger was delicious (but messy so be prepared)! And plenty of parking- we weren't required to valet;That's definitely a plus! The only reason it didn't get 5 stars is because the waitress messed up on my husbands order. But all in all, we would definitely come back."}
{"text":"We've tried this place a handful of times. The food is average, the service is awful, and they don't take reservations on Saturdays.  I'll probably still stop in occasionally, but it won't be my first choice."}
{"text":"Done.  Not going back.  4 of us.  Food was decent..service too...nothing special.  But if you want to talk.. fagettaboutit....this place is way, way, way, TOO LOUD....even outside.  There are many other choices.  Skip this joint unless all you want to do is eat and look at a TV or your phone and take EAR PLUGS.....I SAID EAR PLUGS if you can't hear me."}
{"text":"I was disappointed after waiting to try this location.  We ordered a burger which we asked for it to be med-med well, it was so rare we couldn't even eat it. Meanwhile another person with us ordered a medium burger and hers was well done.  There was no consistency.  I was so excited about the tater tots but the amount of salt made them tough to enjoy.  I really wanted it to be good and try again, maybe once the novelty wears off and it isn't so super packed.  The beer was cold, so I'll go with 3 stars."}
{"text":"Came here to meet some friends for \"Trivia Night\".  My wife and I decided to come early to eat dinners and have a few drinks.  We ordered the buffalo chicken egg rolls to start, which were amazing.  We then split the Pittsburgh Burger and the Mac and Cheese with gouda, broccoli, and chicken.  

The burger was ok.  The tomato added nothing to the burger and detracted from the taste.  I think it would have been better with just fries and coleslaw, but you could tell the patty was great and seasoned and cooked well.  I would like to try the standard burger next time, as I'm sure it is delicious.  The mac and cheese was the star of the show.  We ate all of that while the other food was left on our plate.  World class mac and cheese, and I know my way around a good bowl of mac an cheese.

We ended up staying for a while and playing trivia with several other couples.  Had a great time and the beers were ICE COLD!  Overall this place deserves every bit of 5 stars and we will be back!"}
{"text":"I'm a wineburger guy so 15$ cheeseburgers and 7 dollar beers add up quick.Its a good burger but at 15$ it's something you have to think about especially with 3 or 4 beers it makes a expensive lunch"}
{"text":"I'd just like to give an update and another 5 stars. We went on an insane Friday night last week. The place was packed, no tables except the patio (which was where we wanted to sit). Drunken middle aged hilarity everywhere. We picked a table outside and waited. A few servers stopped by to tell us our server would be right with us, grab us water, etc. 

We were finally approached by a tiny blonde named Jessie who was awesome. She was slammed with other tables and was patient with my boyfriend who couldn't pick a beer. We ordered and waited. His burger (Juicy Lucy) came out medium rare instead of well done. He took a few bites, but looked sick (loves his burgers charred). I called her over and explained what happened. She handled it like a pro, made sure he kept his chips to snack on and whisked it away to get it remade. She showed up no more than 10 minutes later with a fresh burger, an explanation of what happened in the kitchen, another apology and bought him a beer on top of it- which was not necessary. 

We are so seriously impressed with not only the food and drink, but the service. Please give Jessie (sp?) our regards as she is a great server."}
{"text":"The name says it all, it is cold beers and burgers and a half dful of other items. Good beer selection and all types of burgers, the meat actually is well flavored. The reason for 2 stars is for the service, while our waitress was great, the other waitress who brought our food out- literally dropped off our food in a hurry and immediately turned around to chat and dance for a group of guys at the table next to us. The plate she dropped off was on the edge of our table, she didn't tell us it was  his hand. The food somewhat made up for the service.  We won't write this place off, I'll try it again and update the post if it's better."}
{"text":"This place is great for watching a variety of sports and food is outstanding"}
{"text":"I won a $25 gift certificate at a baby shower, and decided to use it, the food at the baby shower was delicious! I think their catering is probably a great deal, but eating at CB & C reminded me that it's called Cold Beer & Cheeseburgers for a reason- don't order the Mac and Cheese... I've eaten a lot of great mac and cheese, and was not happy with the buddha (I think that is what it's called) cheese, because the chicken felt under cooked and the timing was off, the chicken was cold and the mac was hot. The cheese flavor wasn't the best, and I thought overall it was kind of bland. If they would have put more breadcrumbs and popped the entire concoction- including chicken in the oven for about 7 minutes it might have been amazing, more melty. It was more like a cheesy pasta w/ chicken. It was missing cheddar maybe, too.

I think their burgers are way better, my bf got a burger and it was really good, it had fries on it, and coleslaw and the onion rings were yummy too- but I think theres a reason why I should have ordered a burger since 80% of the menu is unique burgers...

Green salad is good
Ranch and Blue Cheese is homemade

{"text":"Favorite new addition to the Upper West Side. Love the CBCB burger. Good patio and great place to hang out and watch a game. It's packed all the time."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with a place that has a million TV's to get your football on! My friend got the sliders and he loved them, but I tried the vegetarian bean burger.  It was huge and done to perfection (gluten free bun as well).  I pretty much only watch football here after that first visit. It's a terrific place."}
{"text":"Really great place to watch any type of sporting event. There is plenty of room and over 30 50\" screen tvs. The food is better than any other sports bar I've been to and they now offer brunch on the weekends.  This place normally fills up pretty quickly on game day so get there early. No need to worry about parking as the restaurant provides complimentary valet parking."}
{"text":"Finally got around to trying this spot after seeing the crowds that were there on previous drive by!  Could not have been more disappointed!! We started with the drummies as an appetizer, would love to comment on them but since they never came until 40 minutes later that would not be a good idea, the waitress tried to do her best , once telling us (after 25 minutes) would be out in a few minutes and then 10 minutes later telling us the manager would be bringing them right out, which did not  happen!  Our burgers then came and still no drummies? The Runner who brought the sandwiches got an earful ( I know she was not responsible) and then went to get the manager who showed up and had no clue why he was asked to come to our table? Final result they took the wings off the bill and also discounted the bill , but they seemed to miss the point that their service was horrible and it does not matter what else happens , we will not be back because the experience was horrible and I would definitely not recommend this place even though it looked like a new hot spot. It was not a good experience."}
{"text":"I love the location on Germann and Dobson. I have issues every time i visit this location. From wayyyy undercooked burgers to BLT's served without tomatoes, there's always something.

Late night service can be pretty slow, especially when the order gets messed up. Everyone is done with their meal while one person is always waiting for their food to be redone."}
{"text":"The average rating was due to experience at check-in. I used Yelp app for wait list before meeting family here for dinner. When family arrived before me (they gave hostess my phone number to look up check-in on their wait list). One of hostess was rude when it came to her explanation of seating another party with same check-in time and same name. When asked how long wait time, she says- \"I don't know, but you're checked in & there is 5 other parties waiting ahead of you. we'll call your name when your table is ready\". I spoke to manager on duty (upon arrival), he had us seated within 10 minute window as promised. Thank you Kyle.. 
Caitlin, our server, was friendly and everyone enjoyed their food order. Overall - our experience was good after the check-in \"issue\". This place IS a sports bar/burger/ restaurant (very LOUD - had to \"yell\" to hear any conversation at own table)."}
{"text":"Decent place with OK service and a nice environment for a place to watch a game.

First time dining here. Great location on the end cap but a smaller footprint than I would have expected for a burgers/sports bar type of restaurant.

Ordered a couple of BYO burgers. One with fries and the other with tater tots. 

The burgers were pretty good with a very nice 'artisan bun'. Excellent job cooking each to order!

The fries and tater tots were common frozen product with the tater tots very underwhelming.

TV's were of the same size mounted across the three sides of the restaurant and under the bar. No consistency in what games are being shown on which walls, so there  was lot of head turning!

While the video set up was not as good as Zipps, the food quality was far superior (Zipps is downright awful IMO).

Overall, a decent, local, non-chain place but one that has other competition and doesn't provide anything uniquely different to set itself apart."}
{"text":"The food is good, the staff is super nice, and the bonus is they let the Girl Scouts sell cookies during the \"cookie\" season."}
{"text":"We've been coming to this location since it opened and we've noticed the music is getting worse and worse! When we asked the girls behind the bar if it could be changed we were told that only classic rock was supposed to be played and they weren't supposed to touch it. It's 2017 when we go out for a nice meal the environment plays a huge role in that and should fit the demographic and area you're in. Gilbert is primarily younger families and the classic rock/snooze music doesn't fit. Is there any way you could play something a little more up beat and with the times? Country, pop, anything that came from this decade??? Love the food love the bartenders but the music is awful!!!"}
{"text":"Have eaten here before but on Sat night service was extremely poor. Waitress completely forgot our appetizer and failed to bring an extra plate as we shared a dish. Additionally, didn't get refills until meal was done. Disappointed"}
{"text":"Wasn't impressed, service was ok, it was a Saturday afternoon, place wasn't super busy, we ordered a French dip sandwhich, a Mac and cheese, and a kids sliders plate, not any drinks  and the bill was still over forty dollars.....a table of 2 and a table of 6 ordered after us,  all burgers and they got their food five to ten minutes before us.... that was slightly irritating, my kids sliders barely felt warm...
Finally - not a big deal  but they have a military discount for only active duty service members.... it's not any better of an experience when the server says are you active duty ? sorry it's only for active duty, I'm sorry.... just saying it feels like hey your service in the war In Iraq doesn't mean anything, or better yet a Nam Vets service doesn't matter....but someone who is currently \"active duty\" and hasn't done anything or sacrificed blood, sweat and friends in actual wars gets it....just saying.....it comes off as unappreciative."}
{"text":"Just had my favorite: Bacon PB &J, my wife had the Grilled cheese and tomato, youngest daughter a cheeseburger slider, my oldest daughter had the Hot dog & fries, and my son in law had the Hangover huger.

Everything got a thumbs up except the Hangover burger : he rethought having an egg on a burger after a few bites.

I'm getting a free dessert shake for my birthday.

#WeLoveColdBeers - great place and atmosphere!"}
{"text":"From the moment we walked in, the hostess was really ditzy. After asking a few questions, she became really rude. She was snotty in the way you see teenagers smart off to adults. Shortly after that, she started chatting with another hostess & they both were behind the hostess desk glancing over at our party while they were talking. 

It is unnerving how terrible their customer service was. After that incident, the meal was ruined & an utter waste of money. I will NEVER be back. Too bad too, since my friends have all been talking about trying it. After our experience, I'm pretty sure they will skip this place. There is so much competition, that bad service just gets you banned."}
{"text":"Really nice place. Lots of TVs. Very busy when we went and caused the service to be slow,
but everyone was friendly. Little pricey compared to similar places."}
{"text":"We were big fans and went to eat on a regular basis. Always took people there when visiting, referred people often and had a few large gatherings. But not ever again........Mother's  Day dinner was a bust.  
And just like I told people to go...now I tell them NOT to go."}
{"text":"First off the food was good. This review is about the service. This was the second time I had been in to dine here. The first time our server was rude, forgot about us and took 25 min to get our food, when we did it was cold. Last night we thought we would try again. The staff seemed preoccupied with other things they were not very attentive to our needs."}
{"text":"Sad to experience the new additional $2 charge for French fries or any other side The food is excellent however a chicken sandwich is already $12.  I won't be coming in much anymore.  Just raise the prices and include fries or cole slaw."}
{"text":"Thee WORST service of all time. I am sitting here at my table as I write this because it's taking THAT long to get our food! To the point where we just asked for it to-go, which is now taking another 20 minutes (on top of the 40) to receive the order. Two cheeseburgers. The two simplest items on the menu. We're just sitting here. No acknowledgement from our server that it's taking fooorrreeeverrr to receive. I can't comprehend what's going on in here. It's not that busy! Oh and the hostess/every server here all seem like they partied way too hard last night and are completely tuned out to their jobs. We're so disappointed in this place. When we walked in (for the first time) we thought \"what a cool place to take out of town guests\" ....sadly, we have revoked that idea completely. With the hundreds of restaurants in the area, this is probably the worst we've experienced and won't be returning. Too bad. Cool concept, didn't execute."}
{"text":"Overall good but they never gave us our leftovers and our daughter barely touched her meal."}
{"text":"We had to wait to get a table but that is usually a good sign. And well worth the wait because the food was melt in your mouth good!! I cannot wait to go back for more. The environment was fun, the service was good and the food was the best in town, hands down! Wait it out...it's sooo worth it."}
{"text":"Great looking burger place. Very loud !!! Good cold beer and large selection of burgers. Burgers were overdone but flavorful. Sides were good. Overall we will go again and order burgers medium"}
{"text":"First of all..I love this place!! But when I decided to have it delivered from post mates and waited 45 min for soggy uncooked fries, undercooked burger with a missing ingredient and rice charged $28!! Not to mention a person would think a burger automatically comes with fries no....it comes with disgusting chips and you have to buy fries extra, weird????I'm not very happy. The fact that it took this long for a burger, fries to only have it be wrong and uncooked, I'm confused.. and be charged for bacon but didn't get it. Not happy. Won't be ordering Here anymore. I paid $28 for something I could gotten at five guys. That's sad."}
{"text":"Really good burger tons of topping choices for the make-your-own, and really good set ones. First time there got a massive over the top(ping) burger was so good got a french dip burger after it. Great place can make a burger to match any taste"}
{"text":"My experience here was average. However, be warned! Both my boyfriend and I left a 20% tip and when we checked our bank statements the next day we were both charged double what we tipped. Check your account after!!! I called the manager about this and they were nice enough and refunded me the extra amount I was charged but offered no real explanation for the overcharge. More should have been done over this. It seems like the waitress tried to claim more than we tipped. Soo shady!!!"}
{"text":"Servers are turtles. Have been coming to this place for past couple years. Have always had extremely slow service but this time it was way too slow. Place wasn't busy and no matter what time you go the service will be slow. Food is OK, not the best you will ever have and not the worst. I would rate the staff 1 star and food 3 stars, value 3 stars."}
{"text":"I have nothing but good things to say about this place! 

The atmosphere and service and great and the burgers? Even better. 

I had the 1000 island burger that comes with cheese, lettuce, 1000 island dressing, and pickles. SUPER tasty! 

My friend had the bacon blue burger that came with bacon, blue cheese, avocado, and caramelized onions! It was huuuuge and looked really good as well. 

The menu is pricey, but these patties are really big and well worth it! 

Only con: all burgers come with chips and it costs two dollars to sub another side such as fries, even though they're the same price.....

Ps- lots of gluten free options!"}
{"text":"My favorite location with the best service and amazing food. Couldn't have asked for a better spot to grab a drink and food on a Friday after work. I look forward to many more visits here. So happy they put a CBCB in Arcadia! Lauren is the best server anyone could ever ask for"}
{"text":"SOOOO GOOD!!!!!! I love this place so much. I forgot the name of the burger I ordered but it had jalape√±os and guac and pico on it and I loved every bite!!!!"}
{"text":"One of our absolute favorite places to go for dinner. The atmosphere is fun and loud. They have tons of TVs on the wall. The drink selection is great and we haven't been dissapointed by the food. We love the sweet potato tots. :) Staff is always friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Great service, food was perfect and drinks were definitely cold! Good beer selection. Thanks CBCB! We will be back! 

If possible though, I'd love it if they got a sour beer on tap or available in bottle/can.... I know some AZ breweries have some delicious ones."}
{"text":"Decided to check this place out for dinner.  This was our second attempt after a failed first attempt due to horrible parking (which forced us to make the choice to go somewhere else).  Initially, the vibe of the place put us on edge.  Not entirely sure why, we were just never that comfortable.  It's very dark, and waiters and waitresses are hustling everywhere.  I shouldn't complain too much, my burger was cooked the way I ordered.  That's about it though.  I had the 1000 island burger.  There was a minuscule amount of 1000 island dressing, most likely due to the gargantuan, dry bun sucking up every last drop of it.  It's one of those buns that the top is about 2\" thick and the burger is 3/4\".  If you are a burger person, this is not the place to go.  The prices are pretty high and the quality just isn't there (tater tots an additional $2 or else you get chips).  This is a definite \"one-and-done\" for us.

Was contacted by owner (as seen below) offering to make it right.  I appreciated that, and messaged her back.  Unfortunately, we aren't going back."}
{"text":"I have not been super impressed with this place every time I go so I'm not sure why it's always so packed, must be because it's the new kid I the block.  The first time I went we sat at the bar and had to flag a bartender down in order to get service.   THe food was mediocre... We had the buffalo chicken dip and it was rather acidic.  The 2nd time I went food was good... We had the cheeseburgers on the happy hour menu for $7.50.  I was disappointed in the beer because they advertised dos xx lager as on special and they were outso I had a domestic.  Don't order the large beer as its a rip off.  They say it's 19 oz but it's closer to 16 oz which is the same as a pint    We asked for no lemons in our water and it came w lemons, then our server brought out another beer and when she set it down she spilled it on my phone.  None of these things are major blunders, but they just make the place so so."}
{"text":"This place is incredible. Not only do they have tons of TVs but they also have a party bus that will take you to every Cardinals home games. It's just $25 and you can have all the beer on the bus you want. The food here is really good too. The wings were really big and the Buffalo sauce was spicy but still flavorful."}
{"text":"Looking for a good burger on yelp this place hosted 4 stars. Thought we would check it out. Very disappointed! My husband and I both ordered the American burger, mine with tater tots and his with coleslaw. The coleslaw was very boring. No flavor. I ordered my burger med, and my husband ordered well. They were both well, and very dry. Not much flavor. I believe most reviews are based on the atmosphere and beer menu. If you drink enough anything tastes good. For me not a good burger! Five guys is way better and cheaper!"}
{"text":"Sat down at 6:30. By 6:55 still hadn't been helped. Waiter kept walking by us like we didn't exist. Wouldnt know about the food as we got up and left. With service like this, I will never spend a dime here."}
{"text":"Good burgers and bar food.  Dont expect a 5 star restaraunt.  Sports, food and beer.  If thats what you want, this place has it.  Staff is always friendly."}
{"text":"I do really want to support local businesses near home, but this place is just all wrong. Prices are high relative to the quality of food, service is poor, the interior is dark, and MY BEER WAS FLAT. Seeing as how beer is in the name of the place, to serve flat beer and then the inane response of 'it's a light beer, it's supposed to taste that way' I got from our server when I asked for a different one. I know what a Coors Light is supposed to taste like and my draft beer was definitely very flat. Never happened to me before in my life and now twice in Arizona.

The food is sub par and seems really over priced for being sub par. I had the $10 chopped veggie salad which was a small bowl (I thought they accidentally brought me a side salad) of  the Costco kind of white iceberg lettuce with carrot shavings. It was supposed to come with cheese and avocado however mine didn't arrive with it. It took a good number of minutes to get a server's attention to fix it. The burgers are okay sized. My fiance had the BBQ burger and again, wherever they are sourcing their ingredients from sucks. The BBQ sauce was sickly sweet and ketchup tasting as opposed to a good bold smokey flavor.

I won't be returning here nor would I recommend it to anyone else. It was so bad we left at half time during the game we came to watch to find a different sports bar."}
{"text":"Good burger very good flavor in the meat, there big no skimp on the overall portions.  Gigantic menu of burgers it's hard to make a decision .. I went old school basic I wanted to see what the basic cheese burger was like first.  I like the option to get chips or French fries , both are even better.. I'm coming  back again for sure. Service was great at the Gilbert location everyone was really helpful."}
{"text":"I get so excited when my husband says he wants to go to Cold Beer and Cheeseburgers!

CB&CB definitely lives up to their name.  Their drink and burger menu is pretty extensive.  I haven't tried everything yet, but we're getting pretty far down on menu.  We have not found anything on the menu that we haven't loved. 

Check it out! You will NOT be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I was excited when my friend wanted to meet me at Cold Beer & Cheeseburgers! Usually I visit the location in Chandler, so I knew I'd have a good time at the Scottsdale location.

I've said it before but I love that CB&CB has an pretty big burger menu and a fat drink/beer menu.  I still haven't tried the PB&J burger.  My absolute favorite are the Tot-chos!  

Check it out, you'll be glad you did!"}
{"text":"First time here.  We heard some bad reviews from friends but we don't see it.  Burger us great and beer us cold...huge selection too!  Lots of local craft beer plus all the standards."}
{"text":"Great place to watch sports as there are plenty of tv's, a great beer selection, but wished the food was better. It is not that the food is bad it is just so heavy and rich. If you eat an entire burger, you will be full for 2 days... Usually end up making what we call the \" hell fire nachos\" which is basically their hell fire chips covered with the buffalo chicken spread."}
{"text":"Great selection of beer and staff is always friendly and accommodating!! Their wings and burgers are delicious! Great sports bar to hang out with friends!"}
{"text":"The burgers are amazing, the  bartender very friendly the servers or as well. The burgers are big we could have shared one and yes the beer is always good."}
{"text":"First time here and was not impressed. The staff is not very detail oriented and got 3/4 orders wrong. Sometimes that happens, however, they messed up one of the orders they were giving a second time. Not coming back for a second visit."}
{"text":"I decided to try this place despite the mediocre reviews. Big mistake. We were seated and given our first round of beers quickly, but that's where the good service stops. We ordered appetizers that were brought out 30 minutes later by a different server. They were fine, but how do you mess up a soft pretzel and tater tots. Our server never once stopped by to see how they were. Once we were done with the apps, we asked a manager to send our server over so we could order entrees. She cane over and took our order, but then we didn't see her again until we paid. After waiting with empty beers and no food for an hour, we went up to the bar to order another round and check on our food. 30 minutes later (an hour and a half total after we had ordered) our food came out. We got the steakhouse truffle burger ($15) which was tiny, undercooked and served on a soggy bun. The chips that came as the side had absolutely no seasoning on them and were too hard to even eat. The hot and smokey mac and cheese ($12) was ok, but basically tasted like microwaved velveeta. The manager stopped by to make a joke about us \"finally getting food!\" But never offered any apology or compensation for our wait. It took another 35 minutes after we were done eating for anyone to come clear our plates. We asked for the check, paid and ran. Being a server myself, it takes a lot for my patience to run out at a restaurant, but this was inexcusable."}
{"text":"45 minutes to get a burger at the bar while everyone else around me got there food 10 mins after they walked in. Kept asking about it and was told it's coming. Finally got up to leave and they bring out a burger that has obviously been sitting in the back for 20 plus minutes and graciously say it's on them. No thanks, I don't want your free cold food."}
{"text":"I just wanted to say how amazing my waitress was. Came in having a lame day and met my waitress Liz. She turned my day around and I left much happier than I came in. Even if I didn't like the obviously delicious food, I'd come back just for the service she provided!"}
{"text":"Out here from Cali visiting the folks, and found CB&CB on Yelp (of course they have already been here).  After checking out the pics, how could we not start with a half order of Totchos with extra queso.  Holy crap!  They were outstanding.  I would definitely recommend this not only as a starter, but possibly even as a meal.  Very filling.  

I was sad to hear they stopped carrying San Tan Mr. Pineapple, but no biggie... Mr. Coke was right there waiting.  I got the Open Pit burger, and it didn't disappoint.  Probably could have used a bit more BBQ sauce.  Housemade chips were also good.  The folks got the All-American burger which is a bargain at $8 from the HH menu, how could you go wrong.  

All in all, a great food experience.  Plenty (and I mean plenty) of TVs to watch.  When I'm back in Chandler, I'll be back at CB&CB!"}
{"text":"Great burger!  Dedicated fryer for gluten free!!!  Helpful staff and quick service.  Would definitely go again."}
{"text":"Great place l. I love the bowl of tater tots. Love the cheeseburger with pastrami was great tasting. Love the place"}
{"text":"This was our first visit to this restaurant chain. We were pleased with the service and impressed with the food...mostly. The beer list is long and has good choices on it.  One of my choices was unavailable but there were plenty of alternatives.  My wife had a \"Mule\" and enjoyed it.  Our friend liked the \"huli huli\" chicken sandwich. He ordered a fruit side to be healthy. I had a pastrami burger with sweet tots and enjoyed it. My wife had the truffle burger with sweet tots and was happy about it.  Tots were heavily salted which was not a good thing.  Burger I had was hard to handle as it was very large. Wife and friends had Oreo sundaes at end. I had an adult milkshake.  There was a substantial delay for dessert.  Our waitress was attentive and kept track of us.  Sundaes were comped due to delay. We will return."}
{"text":"NO SERVICE. 
6 cute girls leaning on the bar sporting their super cute tank tops and their faces perfectly contoured yet not a single one offers us a menu or asks what we would like to drink. i even grabbed a kids coloring page and some crayons to kill the time before getting some service... never happened. my boyfriend got up and picked up a menu himself- still nothing. they all kept giggling and \"like ummm talking about something soooo \"LIT\"...\" GEEZ! i will take one Shrek server that actually works over a half dozen cuties that are there to just take up space. we finally left. who runs this establishment? can u fire your crew and have me interview some people for you? this is sad! you pay them to stand around?! how is this good for business???? if i could give ZERO stars i would...but alas- one will have to do!"}
{"text":"Good burgers.  Been to the restaurant several times and have no complaints about the food.  My issue is that they recently changed their menu and started charging $2 extra for tots or onion rings instead of fries or chips.  Wish that they had made this a little clearer or instructed their servers to point it out.  Seemed ridiculous paying $2 extra per order even for kids portions.  Nice way to pad the bill.  Was there on a busy night and had to get our own silverware, plates, etc since we couldn't get anyone's attention."}
{"text":"What caught my attention to this place was obviously the name. What made me ultimately want to try it was their kids menu. My kids are picky but CBnCB has enough variety for children to make them happy. My wife was also very happy with this choice as she is a connoisseur of onion rings and this restaurant has some of the best rings ever. The menu features some great variations of burgers and sandwiches as well as a large variety of beers on tap and in the bottle.Service was great and the prices are reasonable. I will definitely give it a thumbs up for sure and will be back!"}
{"text":"Highly overrated place. Not sure what all the hype is about. Went there for the first time on Friday night. Started off with a poor greeting by the hostess who appeared to have crawled out of bed and showed up to work in her pj's. 
We were told 20 minutes and waited almost an hour. Once seated, the table was very awkward for 4. It was a horseshoe shape and we all seemed to be looking at the bar instead of each other. 
The beer was in fact cold!! But the cheeseburgers were not good at all. To start, we requested medium and they came out rare. And they just were not delicious as you would expect. The bun was less than average and I ended up eating my burger with a fork after discarding the bun. The side salad was awful. The lettuce was old and I'm disappointed it was actually served to a customer. The tots were pretty good but a bit salty. 
There are too many good places to eat in Phoenix. We will not return to this one. 
One more note, nothing to do with age, but this place was too loud. The music was ridiculous as we could not even hear each other talking. :-(((("}
{"text":"This is a pic of my meal. First, service was slow, but friendly. Started with onion rings to share and they are awesome. 2 of 8 of us had did a special order burger. They both came out wrong, okay, that happens. I was told by the server they will refire the meals. After waiting awhile the burgers came back out. The exact same burgers over cooked. That is against the restaurant's policy I am told. It is complete incompetence to do that. They simply lied and thought they could get away with it and we busted them on it. I can't recommend this location as a result of this and what must be poor management oversight. I will give some cudos to the manager for apologizing and sis say that what happened was wrong and she did comp a round of beers.  Those who did get their burgers as ordered were happy."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING!! So, please indulge a lil story... several months back I was at Chase Bank next to the defunct Rusty Pelican on 67th Ave north of Deer Valley. Apparently, it's location has seen its share of bankruptcies. Anyway, this building was being gutted and I saw a couple official lookin' dudes with clipboards and pencils. \"What's this place gonna be next?\" I asked. \"Cold beers and cheeseburgers,\" came the reply. \"GREAT! What's the name??\" - \"COLD BEERS AND CHEESEBURGERS.\"  He may've thought he was gonna have to spell it out for me. \"That's a stupid name,\" I thought, may have even said it. The other guy said, \"you should go check it out in Scottsdale. I did. WE DID, my wife and I LOVED IT!  I had a PB&J Burger. Sounds gross, Right?! WOW!! It was the sloppy BOMB!! We got on the e-mail list, checked out other #SquareOneConcepts and won a trip to San Diego. (Thanks CB&C!). Now this place is finally open and it's surpassing all expectations. Can't wait to write more later, but for now, my beers getting warm and my cheeseburgers gettin' cold. Check it out for yourself!!!! #NoLeftovers"}
{"text":"Came in for my brothers birthday and the service and food was great! The manager bought us all a round of shots for free! The tater tot nachos were awesome! so close to home! Def will be coming back! Esp for football season!!"}
{"text":"Great new spot on the 7th street strip! Of all the new places that have recently opened, this is the only neighborhood sportsbar/cheers in walking distance. Great food and happy hour too! So far I've gotten to know one of the bartenders, Jenna. And a manager- Mark.  They have been fantastic and have gone out of  their way to make sure I was happy every time I came in.  This is definitely one of my new neighborhood favorites!"}
{"text":"Disappointed when my family and I walked in and were not greeted by 6 employees standing behind the desk. We said hello twice, with no response. Service declined from there. Food was the only good experience. We will not consider going back."}
{"text":"Really good food. Crazy price. If you want a couple beers and a burger for lunch prepare to spend about 35$ per person."}
{"text":"Really good hotdogs that's all I've had there the San Francisco and the San Diego dog really good, good atmosphere. The service could be  little better waited a little for refills on our beers everytime we've been here. So managers work on you customer service. Servers are always standing around the front door. But other than that food will defenetly continue going."}
{"text":"Wanted to love it. Was super excited when the sign went up. Can't love it. Can't even like it. The same as Tailgaters except a new look. 

Wrong appetizer. Difficult to get beer refills. Long wait for food. Overcooked burger that had clearly been sitting waiting to be served.  Lukewarm tots. Server spilled my son's burger and chips on him. Poor follow up when issues raised to managers. Two $5 coupons to use for \"next time\" and an apology for the hiccups. 

Let's be honest here. These are not hiccups. These are systemic service delivery issues. Your name is Cold Beer and Cheeseburgers. You didn't even live up to your name. How about Cold Burgers and Beer If You Ask Enough Times, or Cold Burgers and Beer If You're Lucky, or Cold Burgers and When We Get Around to Helping You. 

Point made. Step up your game to at least match the restaurant you replaced."}
{"text":"If your looking for a unique tasty burger then this is the place. Burgers are huge but they should be considering the price and upcharge to add a side other than chips. You definitely will not leave hungry.  Highly recommend to anyone that enjoys a great burger with a twist."}
{"text":"Carly was our server, Amazing customer service! Food was fantastic, couldn't have came to a better place to watch the Cards!"}
{"text":"I've met friends at this location after work for happy hour a number of times. The food is good and so is the service. I would recommend to friends."}
{"text":"I've been here several times now and I can't stress this enough: they very, very, VERY much over serve people here!! The amount of drunken situations I've witnessed here is baffling! From walking up to the establishment in the early afternoon and being cat-called (while holding my child's hand!), to witnessing people thinking they're in battle in the parking lot and yelling at customers on the patio...you would expect this behavior at a night club downtown but in Peoria?! Bartenders should KNOW when to cut people off, who clearly have had too much to drink. I noticed they've partnered with Lyft now - so maybe they over serve in order to get more Lyft appts made. I'm confident I'll never return here, this environment just isn't my style."}
{"text":"This place is still delicious and I continue to go there and eat and drink way too much.  

Over the weekend my husband said, \"Hey!  I was at CB & CB on Friday after work and you need to check out the misters on their patio.  They are fantastic and it feels at least 20 degrees cooler and you don't get soaking wet sitting under them.\"  What?!?!  Really?  Well, let's go.  We can just run in and out, no need to spend the 50 plus bucks we usually drop there.

Four drinks, 2 rounds of onion dip, and $50 later, we had to waddle home again and take a big nap.  The Tennessee Palmer is a perfect summer beverage, and the onion dip is amazing.  I can't believe we haven't tried that before.  Dani took great care of us at the bar and she was fun to talk to.  OH, and I think the misters were pretty cool, but I better make a return visit to make sure."}
{"text":"The service was terrible and the burgers were average. We had to ask for napkins, utensils and the check. If you do go, spend a little more for a pretzel bun. The regular bun crumbled and we had to use a knife and fork to finish it."}
{"text":"Good selection of burgers. Mine was very good and the onion rings were the best I've ever had. The breading was nicely seasoned.

Tons of TVs, I could see myself coming back here often when football season rolls around."}
{"text":"I really do enjoy this place from time-to-time and normally the service is good.  However, I sat on the patio side of the bar and my service sucked.  The bartender, Kim, walked passed me a few times and didn't even acknowledge I was sitting there.  I have on a bright pink sweatshirt AND the sun is still out.  Finally, the bus boy went to get her.  Finally she came over, took my drink order and then disappeared again.   When she walks by, I had to flag her down to take my order.  Someone brought my order to me, not my server, and I didn't see her again until I had to waive her down for the check.  Now - I know how important it is to tip at least 20% when your server meets your expectations and go up (or down) from there.  This is a perfect example of the rare time I will be giving less than 20%.  I'm certain I will have to waive her down to have her run my card for the bill.  Oh - she is not the only server behind the bar...there are at least two others back there."}
{"text":"Well, I would love to give this place more than 3 stars because the food was absolutely fabulous! So here is where things fell slightly short - it came down to the wait time for our food. 

Once seated at our table and putting in our orders it took almost an hour for our food to come. I still say it deserves another shot because it is a holiday and it was lunch time. 

We will be back to try this place again and hope that the food comes out faster from the kitchen."}
{"text":"Friendly, attentive service. Mozzarella sticks were hot and cheesy. The burger was cooked perfectly, and was huge, so we're glad we shared. And lastly, the beer was ice cold. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Decided to stop in for a burger and a beer based on the excellent service and food we received at the Scottsdale location.  I ordered the sliders (3 to an order).  My husband ordered the Reuben sandwich.  After approximately 1/2 hr. our food arrived.  I got 2 sliders that looked like hockey pucks on stale bread.  I sent them back.  I finally got my order (after my husband was done), and the sliders were terrible!  My husband's Reuben was cold, like it came straight out of the fridge.  I sent my order back and asked them to remove the charge from the tab.  The manager did come over and asked what the issue was, we explained our experience and all he offered was an apology.  This location has a long way to go before we will EVER go back."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been here a few times and have never been disappointed with food, drinks, or services. The only reason I'm not giving them 5 stars is because I feel they need games (shuffle board, darts, etc). It's a sports type of bar and it only makes sense to have entertainment other than TVs."}
{"text":"I will start by saying I have come to learn that people in AZ complain about prices being too high every where. I didn't think that but when I go out to eat I expect  that you will pay more because you're paying for someone  else to prepare it and  serve you  We got seated right away. Ordered sodas and got them right away and ordered when our server brought our drinks back. Let me say this review only has two stars because the food we did eat was great. We ordered buffalo chicken egg rolls as an appetizer and then Prime rib rip with tots and Mac and cheese. Our meal came out quickly before the appetizer. The girl who ran it went to check on it and said dinner came out faster because it's quicker to make. We weren't there to rush so that was frustrating. That same girl brought is the egg rolls and I waited to ask for plain ranch from our server. After ten minutes of waiting I walked to the host stand and asked one of the managers standing there. She went and got is ranch and when I went to eat them was when I found a long hair in them. The server was still no where to be found. Hair in the food, empty sodas. So staring at the manager who had helped she picked up on my dissatisfaction. I told her when she came over and I explained I haven't seen the waitress once since she took our order. She literally chuckled and said she would take care of our check. I told her she didn't need to do that and that the food we ate was great. She went to get us a box and THEN our server showed up to tell us she heard we had a hair in our food. We told her the manager was taking care of it. She came back with the box and said she took care of the meal and yet no apology. It felt as though they just thought we were looking for something which isn't the case at all. We work in the industry and understand things can happen by accident from the kitchen but there is no excuse for the horrible service. We will actually give this place another chance at some point because like I said the food we ate was good."}
{"text":"This place was fun, good atmosphere... I wish they had one or 2 vegan options on their menu though. It's tough for vegans to eat out, hopefully restaurants will become more vegan friendly! I will be back I'll just make sure I eat first."}
{"text":"The hostess who seated us was very rude and acted like we were putting her out when we asked for a table of six.  Food was pretty good and waitress was friendly.  All in all, ok experience except i can choose from about 100 different restaurants in Phoenix where i am not made to feel like the hostess is doing me a favor."}
{"text":"Food was good, service was a bit slow. Two of our four meals were served incorrectly, had to be returned. We were credited for one of them. Sweet tots are delicious!"}
{"text":"So I swear in between games in basketball is a bad thing and I've been told I'm not welcome even though I have been there for 4 years and now not welcome"}
{"text":"I went for lunch on Friday with friends service was great and the burger was awesome!  So on Saturday I went there with my family!  The server was angry and obviously not wanting to be there and after 45 min waiting for a medium burger... It came out rare.   Sent back to the kitchen with the server saying it would be redone right away.  About 30 min later it came back exactly the same.  They of course took it off the bill and that burger was 18$$ wt..... Over priced!   Ask to speak to the manager and the server stated I already told her!!  

Disappointed for a long awaited fun place!   Hope they can get it together!"}
{"text":"This place has really come along nicely since opening. The food is fantastic and consistent. The bar staff is exceptional! They have a great patio area, and they always have all of the games on. It's a great place to eat and watch a game. They have a great selection of beers on tap, and there's always a monthly special. Good stuff!!"}
{"text":"Fabulous hamburgers/chicken burgers.  Plus great french fries.  Middle of the road margaritas, but the food makes up for it.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Popular spot for sure. If you're going for dinner be prepared to wait at least 45 minutes to an hour. It's good but not 5 stars good. Service was just ok."}
{"text":"I just had an amazing experience here! My Chicago dog was excellent and the service was awesome. Our server Vanessa was great. Very nice and friendly. I will definitely be back"}
{"text":"We popped in here to watch Sunday football with friends over the weekend and this is a great bar to watch sports + grab some greasy bar eats. We ordered our first round of drinks at the bar and I ordered the build-your-own Bloody Mary. Ohhhh my goodness, their Bloody Mary bar definitely has all of the fixins and did not disappoint this BM-loving-gal! My husband and I also split the Hangover Cheeseburger and it was OH so tasty! Their homemade chips are also delicious, a great change from French Fries! We just thought it was a little weird that it came packaged to-go when we had no intentions of leaving but hey, they were busy and things happen. 

That said, the food is tasty here and the ambiance is GREAT for watching football. I know we'll be back because CB&C is a popular spot amongst our friends."}
{"text":"North Scottsdale really needs more restaurants like this. As the name says, this place is all about beers and burgers. The service is great, and the burgers are consistently delicious. I really like their decor, even though they have a gazillion TVs. Definitely great atmosphere for watching a game. The outdoor patio is dog-friendly. They even have a water dish for pups!

They used to have it set up so you walked up and ordered your food then seated yourself. This system created a huge line of people, despite the numerous open tables. Since they have switched to standard table service, we have gotten our orders in right away and been served our food much quicker.

The best part about Cold Beers and Cheeseburgers is the happy hour, which runs from 3 to 7. Yes, $10+ dollars is a lot for a burger and a side. But during happy hour, you can get the CB&CB burger (essentially a cheeseburger with garlic aioli sauce) with fries for $6. All drafts are $4, and by drafts I mean 19.5 OUNCES! It's by far the best drink special north of the 101. They offer several beers from Four Peaks, Papago, and Santan, as well as the ole' standards. Dos Equis is $4.50 all day!

The sweet potato tots are to die for, but you can't substitute them for the fries during happy hour. We figured out it's cheaper to order a side of sweet tots (it's large!) and split it between the three of us while still each getting the CB&CB burger with fries.

During AZ Beer Week they had beer tasting on the patio. For $10, you got 8 generous samples and a 19.5 ounce draft of your choosing. I hope they do this again next year!"}
{"text":"Yelp shows this restaurant as being dog friendly on the patio.  We took our dog there and we were turned away. The waitress said that they don't have the permit to allow dogs on the patio. Is there even such a thing? I miss Uncle Bears. I wish they had never left that location!"}
{"text":"At the entrance, were two less- than- thrilled hosts', \"Chel-say\", and her male coworker. Neither seemed perky for being at the front door. We had never been here, so this   unpleasant greeting was not cool. 

Luckily, we were seated at one of Sierra's tables and she was a gem. She was knowledgeable about the menu and beers. 

Prime rib sliders and chips for me. Build your own burger for son. Good but no blue ribbon.

Game arcade a hit ...adult size PacMan and Atari....Duck Dynasty....

Will probably try again since prices were decent and 40 big t.v.'s...."}
{"text":"I'm not much of a cold beer guy but I do enjoy a great cheeseburger and they're getting harder and harder to find. ¬†Ok, a little easier now that I've found this gem (and it's close to work).

Four of us guys from the office on the day before Christmas Eve decided we needed a hearty lunch and headed North East from the office. ¬†We originally settled on a quasi-fast food place but one of the guys suggested CB & CB in the same shopping center, game on!

These guys hang their hats on killer burgers, terrific Mac & Cheese, over 150 beers and some of the best tots this side of Napolean Dynamite. ¬†I love it when a burger lives up to it's name and there are a few on the menu worth trying if your Momma didn't raise a sissy. ¬†

The Ring of Fire Burger. ¬†Spicy onion ring, the requiste jalapenos, pepper jack, spicy mayo, and buffalo sauce. ¬†1/2 lb of hand formed beef on a light and airy bun-brioche I think but I'm not a baker, just an eater. ¬†I paid the extra $1 for the sweet potato tots and they were incredible (and generous-I couldn't eat them all and I usually clean my plate, ok, maybe lick it too.) ¬†One of my buddies ordered the regular tots and as much as I enjoyed my sweet potato tots, I actually had tot envy over his. ¬†They were absolutely perfectly cooked, little nuggets of Idaho perfection.

I'll definitely be back, the menu is for real, the service was good, and it's close to work. North Scottsdale, you're in luck-now all I need is for one in the NW Valley."}
{"text":"Pretty typical sports bar/restaurant type. Family friendly; actually pretty good and filling food. During popular games it can fill up quick and there can be a wait since the restaurant isn't huge."}
{"text":"Good service,clean joint ,food was good,however prices are way out of line. For goodness sake,it's only a hamburger,and then they have the nerve to change extra for fries. FYI---this is not Scottsdale."}
{"text":"The beer is cold, the location is good and once the food gets to your table, it is good.  Don't go starving....  we ordered Tot-chos which were really good with chili, cheese, sour cream and guacamole.  We also ordered a burger medium to split. It arrived medium rare. I skipped my half of the burger. My better half said the burger was very good, the fries were hot and my tot-chos were yummy. It took 40 min to get our food. Beer was quick. It was Sunday and we could see all the football games. Great spot. Just have a snack before you go!"}
{"text":"Great place to take the family and friends. Specials almost everyday with tons to chose from. We will return again!!!!

Only issue would be during big games or ufc fights here. Very hard to get in because people stay forever."}
{"text":"Stopped in after work for a quick bite on the way home. The quick bite lasted a couple hours because of the awesome bartenders. Jenna was awesome! Megan came in during shift change and didn't miss a beat. Thanks for giving me another reason to stop by again on the way home."}
{"text":"We tried this place last week-unfortunately, we forgot it was a game night so the place was packed.  We waited for a half hour before we got a table. We tried the citrus teriyaki wings- AMAZING! I ordered the bacon blue burger with onion rings. I thought it was a little odd they serve it with avocado on it and I ended up taking it off. Also, the burger was overcooked and too charred for my liking. I ordered it medium and it was more well done. The onion rings were delicious though. They had a panko breading and were rather large. Overall it was an okay burger. Service was a little slow though. It took quite some time after we ordered for our food to arrive."}
{"text":"We have come here off/on for the past several months - mostly because it is semi close to us. The first experience was positive and we felt we had found a good option for our family. Things have rarely been good since that first time. We get our orders to go and it usually has issues. The biggest issue being that the food is burnt. Sweet potato tots - black around the edges. Hot dogs - ends are charcoal black. Wings - so burnt they taste like I'm licking a piece of charcoal. They also never provide the kids drink (which is included in the meal) and we have to ask for it which gets them pretty upset. Another issue is - the order is usually wrong. Order onion rings? Well, you get fries (there is a $2 up charge to get onion rings). Order no tomatoes? Well, surprise! One time we even got someone else's order mixed in with ours.  I think this place gets too busy for its own good. 

So why not 1 star? Because when the food is good - it's pretty good. We keep coming back hoping that we will hit the take out lottery and have everything work out. Why 2 stars? Because it rarely works out."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now and I have to say I'm a fan! My go to would be the PB&J burger. What is not to love?! You have that perfect mix of savory and sweet, it was surprisingly addicting. There are tons of TV's for all your sports watching needs, the bar is huge with lots of bar, patio, and dinning area. We have had good experience with service. They also have a very decent selection of beers and their mimosas are served in large glasses and are more like Champagne with a splash of OJ and only 5 bucks. Love that. Glad to have a new sports bar in our part of the hood."}
{"text":"Had burgers and fries at this new store.  Always wonder how the service is going to be on a new opening.  We were immediately greeted and seated.  Our server \"Alexia\" was at the booth in less than a minute to take our drink order.  She gave us plenty of time to review the sizable menu and answered questions.  Very friendly, makes you want to come back. It is obvious that customer service is at the top of this chains list of priorities. The burgers were delicious and perfectly cooked the sides appetizing.  The place is bright with TVs everywhere.  Can't wait to go for a game or NASCAR.  The bar was full.  The outside section is going to be great now that the weather is cooling off.

Alexia told us the weekend breakfest specials are great, planning on trying it this weekend.   Welcome addition to Arrowhead Ranch area!"}
{"text":"Despite the explosion of Cold Beers & Cheeseburgers (aka CBC) locations throughout the valley and elsewhere, I actually had yet to set foot in a CBC location until today.  Scottsdale-based Square One Concepts (proprietors of other valley restaurants such as Wasted Grain and Bourbon & Bones) is the brainchild behind this growing chain of burger joints (10 strong as of when I write this) which have received mixed reviews from those I've spoken to.  My Dad wanted a good burger for lunch on Memorial Day and it just so happened that CBC's central Phoenix location was open nearby so off we went to satisfy our curiosity (and hopefully a burger craving).

The central Phoenix location sits along 7th Street between Missouri and Bethany Home Road, alongside a large and growing list of new restaurants lining this stretch of the valley.  Burger joints are a pretty easy find in CenPho so one would think CBC would need to offer something unique to survive in this saturated market.  CBC's answer?  Variety.  Both the food and beverage menus are impressively extensive with about two dozen burger options (including the ability to build your own), plus upwards of 100 beers to choose from.  And that doesn't even account for the lengthy wine and cocktail options.  Or the hot dog, sandwich, or appetizer options.  Seriously, reading through this long menu is tantamount to reading those long binder menus at the Cheesecake Factory.  And while it may seem a bit overwhelming, CBC doesn't veer too far from the types of items you would likely expect to see at a sports bar setup.  There's just a lot more of them to choose from than say a Zipp's or a Twin Peaks.

Anyhow, I started off with a Scottsdale Blonde Ale for my beer (one of about 20 AZ produced microbrews on the menu).  After looking up and down at the burger menu, my eyes stopped and transfixed on one burger in particular.  The Pastrami Burger.  Pastami, swiss cheese, coleslaw, and thousand island dressing atop a 1/2 pound burger patty and sandwiched between a toasted artisan bun.  Came with a side of twice cooked lightly seasoned potato chips.  Total cost for the food, beer, tax and tip came to about $28.  I was actually really pleased with the bun they used as it held together just fine despite the inevitable mess a piled high burger like this can make.  The burger was also delicious, though as a point of comparison, I would give valley favorite Rocket Burger the edge in the Pastrami Burger pecking order.  Rocket's version has more meat and tastes just as good for a cheaper price.  Still, I'd give CBC's version pretty high marks for their version.

I've seen some Yelpers state that this location has bad servers.  We experienced nothing of the sort as our server was friendly, attentive, and efficient.  I won't disagree that the prices for the food here are pretty steep compared to most sports bars and thus why I can't give this place a 5 star rating.  But taken as a whole, I was impressed with the food I had, the variety of options to choose from, the stellar sports bar setup with plenty of TVs for big game days, and with the staff that took care of us.  You can find plenty of other cheaper sports bar options in CenPho and around the valley.  But during happy hour and on game days, CBC might very well become one of my go to's."}
{"text":"Ordered a Juicy Lucy cooked medium and got charred on the outside and raw hamburger meat on the inside. I normally love this place, was shocked at how bad my experience was this time, couldn't send it back cuz I got the order to go"}
{"text":"I've been here a handful of time. Food is good but the service is sloooooow! Even when we asked the waitress if we could place an order she said she had to get a pen and took another 15-20 mins to get back to us. We waited about 30 minutes for our appetizer and when our burgers came out, the medium we ordered came out well done. We sent it back and it came out well done again. The manager did take it off the bill but we would rather have had a burger cooked the way it was ordered. I think it will be awhile before we try it again. Location is great and the concept is good, just need to work on customer service, server personalities, and food prep times."}
{"text":"This is a great place to watch sports!
my service was good and the food was a little better than most bar food ( tots are too salty, food wasn't hot). Overall a good experience though."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite burger restaurant. I've tried a few different burgers on the menu but I usually stick to the build your own. The tot-chos are awesome too! My absolute favorite item from the menu is the Irish cream desert. It has vanilla vodka so you really don't taste the alcohol. It tastes like a cookies and cream milkshake, but the adult version"}
{"text":"Had this for lunch today. My chicken was disgusting. Was WAY undercooked. Really disappointed as i do love the Mac and cheese.."}
{"text":"We have been to this location 3 times now. The service stinks and you wait forever for drinks and food  but its a fun atmosphere so we continued to go back until this past weekend. 
We had been there long enough to have a burger and a few drinks while we mingled with friends that happened to be there. Now mind you we were on the patio outdoors when a friend and I stepped out of the patio area where we were told she could smoke, we were still close enough to our friends to still have a conversation when another customer 2 tables away started yelling and cussing at us for her smoking. After several words were exchanged the manager GLEN came out to the patio and screamed at us, ripped our drinks off the table and told us to leave or he would call the police. This was done in front of everyone on the patio where there were other smokers that had done what they asked and when on the other side of the railing as we did. Probably the most UN PROFESSIONAL behavior I have ever seen from a Manager. I guarantee that if my husband or any other man was with us he would never have embarrassed us or behaved in that manner!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place, desperately wanting an alternative to Zipps...so, let's start with the fact that I was pleasantly surprised to see asparagus on the starter menu...until I got in the car and saw the order I just paid $7 for -- 6 spears of asparagus for seven dollars...really? Even at Mastros, a $12 side of asparagus would at least be more than enough to feed two, and have some leftover...I give my reviews based on value...so you're gonna charge me $15 for a mediocre burger made with low-grade ingredients, then charge me an additional $2 to get tots instead of fries?! The only reason this place gets two stars, and not one, is because they have a great beer selection, awesome tvs, atmosphere, and very good waitstaff/bartenders...the one interaction I witnessed between management and a hostess, makes me realize, in retrospect, why this place is a big miss. This guy completely degraded the very nice hostess, because there was a very understandable misunderstanding between her and me.  I will be at Zipps, or any other sports bar in town when I want a beer and some bar food...Cold Beer and Cheeseburgers makes you feel like a bigger sucker than any casino or strip club!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend, best friend and I came in here for the first time about a week ago. It's safe to say we won't be back. The food was nothing more than mediocre. I believe they use their extensive toppings and odd concoctions to distract from a purely average hamburger. It was not the worst food I've ever eaten, but nothing fantastic. With a name like this, you really should perfect the very food you're named after. It's quite pricey, and any substitution is upward of two or three dollars. 

As far as the service went, again, nothing to write home about. I presume they were quite busy due to patrons going to watch a fight. This is fine, and expected on a Saturday night; however, there were plenty of open tables and booths. Still, we were crammed between a door and large opening to the patio. It was extremely uncomfortable and highly unnecessary. The food and drinks took quite a while to be dropped off, and nothing was very hot.

All in all, I'd save yourself the time and money. You can get better food, better service and a cheaper bill elsewhere."}
{"text":"This place is great if you're invisible or really don't care for service. We sat at our table on a Wednesday evening  for 10 mins with practically every server looking right through us (I checked the mirror on the way out of the house and we looked fine !) ... Add to that the fact the the tables to our left and right had no problem seemingly being visible to the wait staff ! We live in Austin,TX and were considering moving to Phoenix but I have to say .. These guys have a huge amount to learn from Austin when it comes to service !! Not going back .. For that kinda money id rather be at Hopdoddys !"}
{"text":"Trish was an exceptional server. Her recommendations were awesome and her service was on point! I will definitely recommend this restaurant to all my friends!!"}
{"text":"We went to Cold Beers Cheeseburgers when they had their original location in Gray Hawk. We went the weekend they open and had a great experience. I'm so excited they relocated to a location that is three times the size of their original location. We always receive great service."}
{"text":"The food was barely OK. The service was horrible. Waited for over an hour to get our hamburgers, waitress never came back to fill glasses etc."}
{"text":"I agree with previous post that service at tables are a hit or miss, usually a miss, depending on your server. Table servers are slow and seem to disappear for extended periods of time.

Never had a problem sitting at the bar as the bartenders seem to have the most energy and best attitude. They engage their customers.

Food is good and prices are fair. Like the atmosphere.

*Update.... 34 televisions and only one set for Dolphin's game. It was on a screen partially hidden behind a wall at the bar. I was the only person sitting at the bar and asked if I could have the game moved to a television directly in front of me. It took an act of congress and threat to leave to effect change. Sadly, customer service has depreciated over time."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place 5 stars.  The environment is great, the service was great (considering a party of 10) but the flavor in the food lacked.  As well described as the menu items were, the flavor just wasn't there.  Our waitress and the staff was on top of everything.  I'd say if you're going to watch a game, it's a decent place. There's a variety of beer and tons of televisions surrounding you."}
{"text":"I love this place!! The food, the atmosphere, location.  It's just a really great place to hang out after work or on the weekends. The cute little s'mores desert is particularly fun.  The mac and cheese options seem never ending.  If my waistline would allow it, I'd eat here at least twice a week."}
{"text":"First time here.  It was pretty busy due to the ASU game but the service was still pretty good.  Food came out in a reasonable time.  Got the prime rib sliders which had good flavor.  Our only complaint was that the au jus was cold.  Also there are only 3 of them per order!   For the price,  there should be at least four.  Overall pretty good.. seems like a great place to watch sports.  Will come back to try other stuff from menu."}
{"text":"Great place. Were told it would be 35-40 minutes for our table and it took 6 minutes!  Had the Jucy Lucy and it was the bomb. Will head back here again."}
{"text":"Attended the opening..Their burgers and fries are delicious. I also sampled  Mac and Cheese.  The service was great and friendly.  The evening topped off with S'Mores...Best place on 7th St..."}
{"text":"What did the hamburger say to the pickle?

You're dill-icious!

And so are you burger!

We came in for the last game of the NBA finals (sweep sweep sweep) but were told that the wait was over an hour. No surprise, but we were more than happy to take a couple of seats at the bar.  There were TVs everywhere and the bar staff was super friendly (shout out to Auston), even joking around with us as we took photos for Yelp.  When the sun started to set and get a little too bright one of the bar backs even put up a menu to block the glare (TY Latimore!)

The burgers were very delicious and although priced on the high-end, very much worth it. Hell, even my little Caesar side salad was really delicious.  Our favorite though is the Papago Orange Blossom on draft; just an incredible beer.  We didn't get them this time but I can tell you from experience that the s'mores they offer up are perfect end to a meal.

Definitely one of my favorite burger spots in the valley."}
{"text":"The service was good for a busy day. My husband felt that there was too much bun and it obscured the burger flavor. He said the meat was fresh. My chicken was good but they forgot some of the ingredients. Once I pointed it out, they removed $ from my bill. There was a pretzel/queso cheese appetizer. Not bad but would be so much better with beer cheese. The water is not filtered which is a personal pet peeve. Drinking liquid minerals and dirt is flat out nasty. Price is pretty steep  for a sports bar atmosphere. We might come again but wouldn't crave it."}
{"text":"I frequent this place often and I have never had anything but a great experience! The friendliest staff, the BIGGEST BEER SELECTION in this part of Chandler, and the tastiest cheeseburgers around make this place a winner! There are large TV's, a beautiful patio and did I mention the BEER SELECTION? So many on draught and in bottles and cans, too! There are all kinds of patrons here and the Juicy Lucy cheeseburger is to die for! You can also get the biggest bowl of sweet potato tots I have ever seen! My number one reason for coming here is my FAVORITE bartender, DANIELLE!!! She ALWAYS takes care of me and makes me feel like I'm the only person at her bar! Beautiful girl and great to talk to! Go here TODAY and tell Dani I said hi!!! You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I've been to another cold beer and cheeseburgers in Scottsdale and it was a far better experience.  I was looking forward to this location since it's right around the corner from us.  We decided to stop on since it wasn't too over packed.  We arrived at 5:40pm and was told the wait for a table if 3 was 20 minutes.....great!  7 minutes later they called us up.  This short wait time is probably the ONLY reason I gave two stars.
We sat.....we waited.....finally we placed a drink order and an appetizer.  Once the drinks were brought we then placed our food order.  Again, we waited.....and waited.......and waited.  Our server occasionally stopped by letting us know our food was coming right up it should be ready now and that she was going to go grab it.  We heard her say that four different times.  
We watched the table in front of us be seated, order food, get their food served and leave all during our waiting period.
We finally got our food and it was subpar at most.  Not hot, not ice cold, but maybe like warm if that.  We asked for boxes and our bill which took another 20 minutes.  I can honestly say we wasted 2 hours and 13 minutes here which is absolutely ridiculous.  
I could understand if they were extremely busy, but they weren't.  They started getting busy towards the end of our visit here.
I've now tried this location and I don't think I will be back again."}
{"text":"I was at Cold Beers & Cheeseburgers on 67th & Deer Valley last weekend with a group of friends and had AMAZING service. Both Kayla & Allyson were our servers and they tended to us without hesitation. We all had appetizers: soft pretzel, loaded tots, hummus, chicken fingers, and the food was quite good."}
{"text":"Very good service with great tasty and creative burgers! Will come back again. There are a lot of TV's everywhere making it a great spot for sports fans."}
{"text":"Don't let the prices scare you. The menu may look expensive compared to some burger joints, but, you will definitely get a good value for those extra dollars spent. I had the burger, which is 1/2 pound of meat. It was fresh and it was juicy.  They make their own chips and they were a perfect addition to a great burger. With 200 beers available and 40 on tap there is something that will spark your interest.  
The wife had the Asian salad. It was large and heavy with chicken. Also on the menu are various Mac & Cheese items. They looked good and that will be my fare next time in. 
Plenty of TV's for sports and a very nice bar area. Just the place for a football or baseball game. 
Check out the specials each day to find your favorites."}
{"text":"Food is tasty, by overpriced. Our waitress forgot to put in our appetizer, so we never got it. She was running around like she had way too many tables. Very disappointing. 
Beer list is extensive and burgers are massive and tasty."}
{"text":"We love CB&C other locations. This one is right by our house and we were so excited.  Opening week, understandable. Second time, terrible again.  Tonight we waited 40 minutes in nearly an empty restaurant.  Got our food, it was cold. All the meat was salty. So disappointed...we were stoked to have something close by. Please get it together even though I don't think we will roll the dice again, we will go to Alma School."}
{"text":"I love cold beers and I also love cheeseburgers so how could you possibly go wrong right? This place really does offer some great food, excellent burgers and apps,  excellent beer selection both on draft and bottled, and good service. Only downfall is this place is a tad bit pricey for what you get. But overall a pretty solid spot for happy hour and lunch."}
{"text":"Burgers are dry and lack flavor.  The staff is friendly and the setup is good for watching games."}
{"text":"Build your own burger..with a good beer- fantastic! Just what i was in the mood for. The wait after ordering was a bit excruciating, as I felt like my stomach was eating itself. I am now officially Fat and Happy. In addition to that, football games on every screen..didn't miss any matchup. Happy Sunday!"}
{"text":"My man loves cheeseburgers. We decided to give this place a go after hearing about it from a co worker. We met another couple and deliberated at our table about what to order. We got split up in the ordering line and because the people who got between us were really slow to order, we got our food as our friends were finishing theirs. That's annoying! They need a better system. The ice machine was out of order but a nice guy got us cups of ice for our drinks. Watching our friends eat was torturous, especially because they offered no insight to the taste of their meals. I ordered a chicken sandwich but the other 3 in our party had cheeseburgers. We finally got our appetiser (2 pretzels so we could share with the other couple, you can just get one if you want) and our sandwiches at the same time. My chicken sandwich was monsterous! Two chicken breasts plus all the junk I had added: lettuce, tomato, pickles, grilled onions, avocado and terriyaki sauce! I ended up taking both chickens off and just eating the buns with all my additions and took the chicken home. It was a tasty sandwich all around. The other 3 cheeseburger eaters agreed that their burgers were solidly good. However, we were all equally turned off by the amount of salt on all of the sides. Our pretzels? Twisted salt licks that came with a nacho cheese dipping sauce. We couldnt eat them even after I tried wiping the salt off. Around the table we had onion rings, fries, tater tots and sweet potato fries and every single batch was over salted. By ALOT. I love onion rings but couldnt stomach more than three and I couldnt give them away. It was really bad. When I reported this to the co worker who told me about this place he said he'd heard the same thing from other people. Hopefully they get the message and do something about it. If not they may not be there for long. I would not go back, but my man wants to just to try their build your own mac and cheese, his other love."}
{"text":"Great local beer and burger joint. Good selection on beers and lots of tvs for the various sporting events. Good vibe from waitress and staff. Had the Ring of Fire burger and it was excellent, on spicy side which was great. Wife got Trufflehouse steak burger. She said it was middle of road good."}
{"text":"Love love love this place. Came here today after getting kicked out of BLD for grabbing my own drink from the bar. Great service and even better food"}
{"text":"Placed a to go pick up order. Went to pick up. Got a half cooked burger (asked for medium well) overcooked cold fries, no drink. (Menu says that food comes with a drink) even if you order in, it should be the same both ways??? Total bill 15.00! with no drink if you order to go. Manager told me. Thats the prices the company put on the menu, if I don't like it go somewhere else. Almost threw my food at him! Since he speaks and represents the company, then I guess this is the way you tell your managers and employees to handle business! Sad because I live in the area and this was my first time coming here. What a bad first impression..."}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible!!! 

We were there for 45 minutes and never got our food. Finally we were sick of waiting so we said we wanted it to go. Thankfully they didn't charge us for our food, but when we got home to FINALLY eat our burgers were not only cold but RARE. I mean so rare it was bright red. Disgusting! 

We will never go back."}
{"text":"We end up here a lot because it's close. The food is decent, but always slow. Service is hit or miss too- either really horrible or decent but never consistently good. I also wish they had icy cold glasses for the beer- every time I go the glasses
are room temp and often times
sticky."}
{"text":"What's better than a cold beer and burger on a beautiful spring day in Az? Better service would have helped. I've had good experiences at the old town location. Here, the bartender was putting away glasses instead of paying attention to hungry and thirsty patrons. We waited 10 minutes for her to take a drink order, and waited 30 minutes for food. We ordered the egg roll appetizer and it all came together and they were cold. My Chicago hot dog wasn't bad and her mac and cheese was pretty tasty, whats with the poor service? It's so easy! Sigh. Good location and high hopes but not there yet."}
{"text":"I have been going to the old location in Greyhawk for years & was always a big fan. Very disappointed in this new location. Waited an hour for a burger & buffalo sliders. Finally get the burger I ordered medium & it was burnt. Never given any refills & sat with our drinks empty for quite a while. There are plenty of great burger places in Scottsdale & I think it's time to try a few. I won't be returning to this location."}
{"text":"The food was good. The service was absolutely horrible. My brother, fianc√© and myself decided to try this branch because the other ones we had ate at previously were great all the way around. 
When we first walked in, there was 3 young girls (hostesses) huddled together at their booth. They didn't welcome us or offer seating. We had to ask if we could sit at the bar. Once we sat at the bar we waited about 5 minutes, the bartenders never even acknowledged us. At this point, my brother walked up to the hostess booth, and asked if we could be seated outside, once seated we sat for another 10 minutes. Again we weren't acknowledged, our waitress walked passed us about 5 times, and finally we decided to start timing how long it would take to be noticed. 10 minutes.. so, that's 20 minutes outside, waiting. My fianc√© finally got back up and walked to the hostess booth again and asked if we could be served, at that point we were promptly attended too. But, I am assuming that is only because a manager was standing there as well. I had even asked a couple sitting next to us how long they had waited to be acknowledged, and they said that they also had to get up and ask to be served. It's safe to say that we will never come back to this location again. And clearly, this location needs to focus on hiring more capable staff, or maybe even focus on more efficient training."}
{"text":"Booked the bus to the Cardinals game and that was a huge mistake. The bus is overcrowded and way too loud not to mention I would have gotten there quicker driving myself.
All that aside, the burgers are over priced and mediocre. They come with chips but if you want fries it is $2 more. We paid $45 for two burgers and two beers for lunch. The service was very attentive though.  I won't dine here again."}
{"text":"How simple can it be to review a place called Cold Beer and Cheeseburgers?

Well, pretty easy because they do a great job with cold beer and cheeseburgers!  LOL

We've been here a few times and have enjoy the buzz and food. Unlike some of the brew type places in the valley trying to serve pub grub, this place figured out that serving interesting good tasting food is what makes us keep coming back.  Wow, how simple can that be?

The pretzels are warm and tasty. The shredded Buffalo Chicken dip (photo) has some kick and hits the stop. The Sirlon Sliders are really very, very good.  They may not be as good as Gordon Ramsey's BurGR place, but we'll keep coming back here again and again for the Sliders. 

What's that's saying about giving people what they want...  simple right?

Happy Hour runs until 7 pm and there's a monthly beer special. At the moment it's Dos Equis. They also have a $5.00 Off Yelp Checkin deal (photo), so don't forget to checkin. Expect to pay $20+ each depending how thirsty your group is. LOL

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Stopped here after working all day. First things first. Parking here is a real problem.  Twenty minutes on a Tuesday night.. Lots of restaurants in the same complex.  So we finally got seated and met our waitress who did a good job.  The menu was large.  We ordered and waited, and waited, and waited.  Burgers were cooked to order. My husband's said his was okay, but he was expecting more.  I ordered the Hawaiian  burger. I was dreaming of the same burger I had in Hawaii. Dream no, more of a nightmare . Burger not medium rare but medium and where was the pineapple? Tiny  canned pineapple with no taste. Yuck.  
Would we go back nope."}
{"text":"This place is a top choice out here, came here on game 2 of the World Series, pretty busy. The bartenders were great! Misty is very attentive and nice. I had the chicken tenders with fries and they were delicious. Had a couple of beers which are always tasty. Definitely excited to try more of their food, I have my eyes on some burgers, and some more beers off of their pretty large selection."}
{"text":"OK 4.5, it's more of a bar than Resturant 
Service was veto good 
Food was way better than expected and I am going to be a patron while we live nearby.

Buffalo chicken sliders were very good. As were the prime rib  sliders.

Chicken wings are Grilled!  Flights of beer!  
What a patio!"}
{"text":"Cozy spot for lunch. Ro and I stopped in for appetizers and drink - Wings and Fries were tasty. We sat at the bar and service was awesome. I love the atmosphere here --- perfect for College Football watching in the Fall. I love that this is Centrally located as well. Cheers***"}
{"text":"Excited to have a new sports bar in our area. Rode bikes here today to eat and watch football. Great layout with views of tvs from every table. Fast, friendly service even when very busy. Like that the manager came over just to say hi and see how we were doing. Big portions and very good food with many menu items to choose from. Chili Mac dog with house made chips was amazing as was the turkey rueben with sweet potato tots! We would come back for sure!"}
{"text":"I'm not quite sure how to rate this place as there are two distinct things I loved about it and two distinct things I hated about it.

Let's start off with the good news:
The food here is great. Giant, juicy, stacked, mega burgers, insane Mac&Cheese combos and good sides. The other great thing is the beer selection (I know it's a krappy beer, but I love it when I stumble into a place that carries the Little Yella Pils, sorry). Lots of good local beers to choose from.

Ok, now for the bad parts. 
Our server could not stop putting her hands on my boyfriend. Now don't misread this as me being even remotely territorial, but there are boundaries. A hand on the shoulder once or twice I would have simply written off, and especially at a place like Hooters or Tilted Kilt where part of their job is to be flirty with customers, but on around the 4th or 5th pass it was getting eerie, especially on the one where she ran her hand across the top of his back as she walked by us, without even stopping at our table as a result. This isn't that type of a restaurant, first of all.
And secondly, we go out to eat with each other ALL THE TIME, almost every day and I have never, ever seen a server touch any customer the way she was getting on him. I used to wait tables myself and I sort of shudder at the thought of touching anyone like that, even if I thought it would get me a bigger tip.
The 2nd bad thing was that this isn't the first time we've been here, the first time our food (it's just burgers, come on) took well over 40 minutes or so to come out. We had to get it to go because we were getting pretty crunched for time at that point.

So: food is good, but insanely slow; drinks are good, but our server was overly handsy, and it was a very one-sided affair (ie: she barely even acknowledged my existence)."}
{"text":"Came in after a graduation and was deeply appalled. The young man in charge of valet was extremely rude because we parked in the valet section. When we offered to move without hesitation, he condescendingly assured us that it was fine. I understand the frustration of dealing with costumers who park in the section but I was willing to move. There was no need for him to be \"nice\" about it."}
{"text":"The service was TERRIBLE !  We sat at the bar and were given a food menu.  After 25 minutes, we had to flag down the bartender so we could order.  She never asked us if we wanted to order.  It took so long I didn't even eat.  I have no idea if the food is good.  I wouldn't go back with such awful service.  There are many other places to go and eat.  Forget the hype."}
{"text":"Good food, burgers especially are wonderful and creative! Although a sports bar feeling, still really family friendly. Awesome patio with TV's and misters!"}
{"text":"First time at a Cold Beers & Cheeseburgers: I was impressed by the very friendly staff.  One of my favorite servers is here awwwww awesome!!  Jordan takes care of me with the sweetest smile!!  Elaine was great as well. I received some great recommendations for today & future visits by Justin, GM. 

Tried a few samples & decided on Golden Road Get Up Offa That Brown (Brown Ale): very smooth. 

Arizona Burger: 1/2lb burger served w chips(sub a side $2), pepper jack, tomatillo salsa, pico de Gallo, green Chile w sub sweet tots (sweet potato). Delicious, juicy & perfectly cooked the way I wanted. Sweet tots was delish too (kind of like a warm dessert to my mouth). 

Will try the Jucy Lucy-fer Burger next as recommended on the Pretzel Bun (highly recommended for extra juicy burger like this one to be on Pretzel buns). 

Great atmosphere with lots & lots of TVs for sport buffs!!  Great specials available for different days & can be locational as well. Tuesday is $3 cantastic all cans & wine down 1/2 bottles of wine.  Great happy hour Weekdays 3-6pm specials. Weekend breakfast until noon. 

All first responders & active military receive 10% off your total bill (must show valid ID, not to be combined w any other offer, discount, promotion or happy hour as a THANK YOU. 

Just check the little stand on your table for specials (also attached pics)."}
{"text":"This place was clean, friendly staff and amazingly fusion of burgers done right.  PPJ w sweet potato tots.  
Vanilla porter -:) drop the mic"}
{"text":"Food is over priced and average to say the least. I used to love coming to Cold Beer & Cheeseburgers. The hostesses at this location were rude. I was hoping for a better experience at this location after having a poor experience at the Scottsdale location. Still can't say I'm impressed :( things have definitely gone downhill within the last two years."}
{"text":"We have been here three times and every time we came there was some sort of issue and we left unhappy. 

The first time we went there was a billing mix up and we were overcharged for two things. I almost didn't notice but in the end I did. They fixed it but no apology. 

The second time I was there alone with my three children. It took a long time to get our food and the toddler was cranky and then my burger came out well done (ordered it medium). It took the longest time for the second one to come out, I swear they forgot to place the second order. I had to walk my toddler around the perimeter of the building many times, starving, waiting. That time the manager did apologize and they took it off the bill, which I appreciated. But it was still a stressful situation and not enjoyable for me at all. 

After this last time I don't think we will come back again ever. It was sort of crowded, a Sunday, I walked into the rest room and saw a tall man standing in a stall, peeing with the stall door wide open. Panicked and ran out thinking I went into the wrong rest room. I didn't! So I told management. They told me \"it happens all the time\"...oh really?! These are probably the same people who bitch about transgenders using bathrooms. Transgenders do not want to molest your daughters. But sloppy drunk jerks do. THIS is what you should be fearful of, people! \"It happens all the time\"? Well then DO something about it! Make that sign bigger. Put it directly ON THE DOOR SO DRUNKS CAN SEE IT!!! At least act concerned! At least tell me you are going to fix it! Absolutely no concern about drunk men walking into the women's bathroom exposing themselves \"all the time\". Wow wow wow. 

Then my daughter ordered a grilled chicken sandwich. The chicken was awful, rubbery, had vein and cartilage throughout the whole thing. They did remove it from the bill. My son ordered the philly chicken sandwich. This thing is $16.50. He didn't get anything on it that it actually comes with (no jalape√±os, onions, peppers, etc...). Just cheese. He asked for ranch dressing to put on it. They charged us for the ranch!!!! On a sandwich that costs $16.50 after he saved them all that money by passing on the extra stuff it comes with. Unbelievable. Truly! 

The burgers are just \"ok\"- the bun is too sweet and was sort of stale and the fries and tots have MSG in the seasoning. Massive headache. Oh and we had to pay extra for the fries/tots...burgers come with chips."}
{"text":"Yummy drinks and good burgers..my friends kid had a hotdog all beef and it was yummy as well..very cool atmosphere as well very live for a Sunday.."}
{"text":"Stopped in to watch MNF and check out the new North Scottsdale location as I was a regular at Grayhawk (sucks they moved) but I was very surprised.  They did an outstanding job with the layout - bar, patio, booths, tv's and even the restrooms.  I sat at the bar, Kim and Nina were awesome.  I had a blast talking and joking around with them and other customers.  CBCB is proof that a fun, casual, neighborhood sports bar can grow and find big success but still be fun and inviting.  I will be back for sure, especially for games!"}
{"text":"4 of us ate here and our bill was $120 (plus tip). We each had a burger and 3 beers were ordered...since when does a burger cost $20 bucks? WAY OVER PRICED!!! Service was very slow, not returning. There are plenty of other places much tastier and less expensive in the area."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place, but let me say...if you don't like a \"sports bar atmosphere\", you may not like it. Luckily I do! First, it's setup with TVs everywhere with every sporting event you can imagine playing. Next, huge bar with an enormous beer selection - a must have if \"beer\" is in your title. Then several unique appetizers, we had the buffalo chicken tot-chos (like nachos) and our friends got the regular tot-chos = both unique and tasty! The burgers selection was vast, but the also have sandwiches and a mac & cheese section on the menu! I got the CB & CB burger, grilled onion gruyere cheese - it was gooey and delicious. I really enjoyed it! Plus they have the biggest pacman in the world - so fun to play!"}
{"text":"We find this sports bar to be just okay. It is usually packed with patrons, which is good for them, but makes for slow service. Because it is a sports bar, it is very loud, almost headache loud. We find the food average bar food, a little on the pricey side.
They have a huge beer selection. It is great to have a new sports bar up in this part of town."}
{"text":"Everything was delicious.  They have the best Mac n cheese in town!!  The only complaint I would have is that I substituted a side of Mac n cheese for my chips.  I was told it was a $5 up charge which i had no problem paying.  After I thought about it.  A side of Mac n cheese by itself is $5.  I should have just gotten the side that came with my burger and ordered an additional side  because it would have been the same price.  Yeah that price system right there is a little jacked. But all in all it was a good experience."}
{"text":"We came on a Friday night so the place was packed, but they still gave service with a smile. Service was admittedly slow, but you didn't see anyone standing around...everyone was on the move!

That being said, drink refills were a little slow and if you don't make up your mind relatively soon, you may have to wait for them to get back to you. The husband said the Mac n cheese was delish (I thought it was okay but I'm not a Mac n cheese girl) and the prime rib sliders were great! Before ordering I asked how the Cesar salad was and they responded ...\"it's good, I mean.. it's a salad\" in a tone that sounded dubious of how good a salad can be. Well, I engulfed the whole thing.  It was YUMMY and will be ordered again."}
{"text":"Food is fine, neither good or bad. The service however is consistently slow. It's not just the food, which does take forever to come out. But everything is slow. Drinks, extra napkins, getting the check. 1 1/2 hours later we are still here still waiting for the check..."}
{"text":"Burgers couldn't have been any dryer than being left out in the heat in the summertime. And that was for medium rare. Atrocious. 
Way Overpriced."}
{"text":"I've only been here twice... and am still trying to convince myself its worth returning. I'd love to have more good local bar/restaurants in the Grayhawk/Pinnacle area... and hope this place improves. The burgers are barely OK.. not really tasty. I've had much better in the same price range at places that don't advertise 'Cheeseburgers' in their name. The service seems really sketchy... the bar & kitchen can't seem coordinate with the servers... not impressed! For now, I often end up grabbing Pei Wei takeout across the lot... even when I'm in the mood for a burger/steak (frequently).

For what it's worth, a $30 gift card wouldn't be an enticement... reading on here that some kitchen reality show had stopped by and saved this place would be great!"}
{"text":"Brought my girl, Came in on a Friday night not too many people as I imagine they were going to be closing soon, we got seated and we were so excited to try some of their delicious sounding hamburgers, but as we're talking about what we'd get, we began to notice, no one was coming to take our order, we waited, no joke 15 minutes, meanwhile the table next to us got serviced 3 times in that span.  

TL:DR Waited 15 minutes, Never got serviced, so couldn't eat. 

Would I go back? I don't know....really angry about it since my girl was expecting a nice experience and the restaurant made me look bad and worse she was hangry!"}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times.  I've really liked the food, but the service is terrible.  After being seated I had to get up and ask if we had a server as we sat there for over 15 minutes without being acknowledged.  After we ordered we waited over 45 minutes for veggie burgers and a salad.  Rediculous!  Didn't plan on being there for an hour and a half!  Another group was seated at 7:45 pm and by 8:10pm they were eating.  

Constancy is really lacking.  It wasn't very busy.  Also, not sure why all these girls just hang around the host area.  Looks terrible!!!  Especially if people are waiting to be served!!  Like I said the food is good, but not worth the service!  especially for the prices that are charged!  Very disappointed!!  

We need a place like this in our area, but the newness will wear out and people will start looking for somewhere else to go. Get it together management!!!"}
{"text":"Beer was good. Sweet Potato Tots were great! Burger was cooked well :) I'm impressed."}
{"text":"My wife and I went here for lunch on Saturday afternoon.  The place was pretty crowded but we didn't have to wait for a table.  Our waitress was very nice but I think she had too many tables to tend to and/or was new because she was a clusterfuk.  Our visit didn't exactly run smoothly but it was ok because we weren't in a hurry and weren't expecting much because of the reviews on here.  We only really came here because I like trying new burger places and I had a 50% off certificate from Local Dines ( http://bit.ly/dfR4eQ ).

Pros:
* decent beer selection with several local brews
* good tots
* tasty burger
* 50% off Local Dines certificates ( http://bit.ly/dfR4eQ )
* good selection of interesting burgers
* reasonably priced

Cons:
* food takes forever to come out
* my \"iced\" tea arrived with no ice nor sweetener 
* my wife ordered her burger with no bun and it came with a bun
* I ordered a side of tots which didn't come out until I asked about them
* medium and medium rare burgers are somehow cooked the same
* at least one beer on the menu is printed incorrectly.  For example, one beer on there is labeled as an IPA and it clearly isn't after looking the beer's label.
* they were out of several beers
* homemade thousand island is just blah.  it was almost all mayo.

I wouldn't rush back here but I guess this place does serve up a solid burger.  It just wasn't anything special to go out of my way for."}
{"text":"I came in with my mom and my husband. My husband and I got a vegan burger, and it was nothing outstanding. It was coated in a sauce, and it overpowered the whole thing. My main complaint is when my mom asked if she could have her tomato diced up, and the waitress said no... they wouldn't do a \"custom\" request like that. Her only offer was to bring my mom a plate, a tomato and a knife, so she could do it herself. Seriously, what kind of place can't take 10 seconds to chop up a tomato? The mediocre food and the lack of proper service are enough to make us not come back."}
{"text":"Burgers were yummy and there is a fairly large beer selection.  Single use plastic items should be issued upon request (straws/ skewers) and plastic Togo containers done away with. it's pretty disheartening to see how behind Phx restaurants are in comparison to other cities."}
{"text":"Such good food! Their burgers are to die for. Sometimes you have to be a tad pushy about making sure they're cooked to your liking if you're crazy about it being medium well like I am but even so they're so good! Also, I think hot dogs are disgusting USUALLY but get a Sonoran dog. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"I give so much of my money and time to this specific location. I have never had a problem here, management is always great to me, my friends or family. They recently got a new manager, Dustin. Dustin was extremely unprofessional. First, after sitting at the table for 10 minutes we finally asked for a server. Kylie came over, she was the most amazing server and always is awesome to us. We order the buffalo chicken dip, which came out like soup, not dip. We never got silverware.. then our food  came out, Mac and cheese was cold, fries were soggy and cold, and one person at my table didn't get his food until 15 minutes later. When the MANAGER DUSTIN, brought out the dinner he said all the Mac and cheese is pre-portioned as I received a kids size Mac and cheese. He knew the fries and food were cold and didn't do anything. He walked away from the problem and left the problem on our server. At this point it was his problem as a manager to deal with it. After asking 2 DIFFERENT servers for him to come out, he finally came out 25 minutes later with \"hot fries\" and everyone was done with their food. He said he'll take the 3$ fries off and the chicken dip. 

Our server was great to us and always is. I love Kylie and will only come back for her. 

She brought our check out and it was 44$, we explained to her again what transpired and she said she'll talk to him. He never once came out and apologized, he left it all for Kylie to deal with. He never even mentioned he was a manager when he brought our food out. Poor management and the owners and general manager who are awesome should be embarrassed they hired a \"manager\" like this. 
BUT KYLIE IS AMAZING!"}
{"text":"Yes, they are expensive. But they are so good! The BEST mozzarella sticks I've ever had! My husband loves their PB&J burger, I'm not brave enough to try that! I had their Grayhawk sandwich and I loved it. It was big enough to have two days worth of dinner!"}
{"text":"Brought my parents from Palm Springs to visit my sister and her family. Stopped here for lunch with seven of us, at my sisters suggestion. Greeted immediately with smiles and given three options to sit. We came in three waves and waitress was great with getting drinks and then our order. I ordered the hangover medium rare. Burger came out PERFECTLY done. Had tots as side as suggested by my brother in law and wasn't disappointed. As the manager started bringing out meals I mentioned \"what happened to our appetizers?\" He said he'd find out. Waitress came out and took full responsibility for us not getting appetizers. We said we'd take them anyway. Management made adjustment to bill for late appetizers. Most of us had burgers, all different and we all loved them. I will definitely be back when in town."}
{"text":"Foodie Friday called for burgers today. So more like fat ass foodie Friday. So worth it! My friend got the Juicy Lucy burger and I got the Rocky Point burger. Burgers were delish! We ordered totchos which I highly recommend! Tater tot nachos were friggin' delicious!! I do not recommend getting the Papago Orange Blossom beer. Yuck!! Not Your Father's Root Beer is good. Too sweet for me though. The Pilsner Urquell was alright!"}
{"text":"By far the best hamburgers in town. Each and everytime we eat at CB&CB we are never disappointed. Cheese sticks, mustard wings and a hamburgers (we shared.) Our service was awesome and when you check-in through yelp you will save 10% off your bill so don't forget to use the check-in feature to save a little moola."}
{"text":"Second time visiting here. I'm surprised at the other reviews. Both times we've had great service (Priscilla) each time was on point. The manager was always out and about making sure things were taken care of. I can't wait until football season starts as TVs are everywhere."}
{"text":"Went with a work group and had below par service. I took into consideration that it was a Friday night but a long wait 20+ minutes for our first drink order and she also brought out a shot \"on the rocks\" and no one asked for it that way. The food on the otherhand was out of this world. We ordered a Hangover burger but got the patty stuffed like their Juicy Lucy for $15. We were very impressed at the taste and presentation of the food. Parking was terrible too, we had to actually park at the CVS and walk across the street to get there as the entire lot was full!"}
{"text":"Great cheap appetizers... we had the sweet potato tots and buffalo blue cheese chips.  Both were good and only around $5 each.  We did find better buffalo chips at a nearby restaurant, and the beers at Cold Beers were kind of pricey.  Definitely try one of the shakes with booze, though... well worth the $9!"}
{"text":"Delicious burgers!  Probably the best in Scottsdale!  They have a fantastic gluten free menu and accommodate dairy free too!  Such a cool option to BYOB (build your own Burger)!!  If you want to watch a game they have a tv in every inch of this place!  Service was quick and very attentive.  The only thing I would change is I don't think it's necessary for the girl servers to walk around in half tank tops with their boobs and bellies hanging out and short shorts!  This isn't Hooters ... They should respect themselves more!"}
{"text":"This place absolutely sucks.
Slow service 
The food looked terrible 
The lettuce was wilted and the tomatoes were gross 
Will not be back."}
{"text":"Remember that Outkast song from 15 years ago where they sing \"What's cooler than being cold? ICE COLD!!\" well, in 2018, Cold Beers and Cheeseburgers finally answers the question of what's colder than ice cold -- the center of their Jucy Lucy Cheeseburgers!

For a place whose name is literally 50% Cheeseburgers, they sure are bad at cooking them! My Jucy Lucy was ordered Medium Rare and I was served a frozen unpalatable mess that was still bleeding.  Jucy Lucys are a great burger invention where the cheese is INSIDE the patty! When you take a bite gooey melty cheese comes pouring out. Well, that's not the case here. Mine was still frozen and inedible.

Their menu is extensive and everything ~sounds~ pretty delicious - however, if they can't cook things properly, what's the point? Props to the manager for taking our bloody beefcube off the bill. The service was nice and the beer was, indeed, cold.  

It just boggles my mind that a place with \"Cheeseburgers\" in the name has no idea how to cook a cheeseburger. A more apt name would be Cold Beers and Coldburgers."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch w a coworker. Food was great.  It took a little longer than my hour but it was amazing.   I will be back for happy hour I think."}
{"text":"Great casual atmosphere for dinner with some longtime friends. Our server was awesome."}
{"text":"Great service, and great food. Everyone that works there is friendly, and their Teamwork makes The Dream Work. Good Job People."}
{"text":"Cold tater tots. Kids grilled cheese was inedible, full of burnt black pieces. Burgers were over cooked & very dry. Disappointing experience. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Came here for a friends birthday. Great atmosphere and the food was well worth the money. I would recommend this spot for anyone wanting premium burgers and a good time."}
{"text":"Love the California Reuben and sweet tots. My husband loves the Cincinnati char dog. Really nice wait staff."}
{"text":"This may sound strange and a small thing, but their homemade ranch was why my friends & I all went there. It tasted AMAZING. It complimented any and all dishes. Then some moron decided to replace their homemade ranch with Hidden Valley. Pure Stupidity. How could anyone think that was a good idea. None of us go there anymore. We moved to Zipps where the food & ranch are better."}
{"text":"Servers are rude, unattentive and seemed not to care. Ordered food to go. Buffalo Chicken Sandwich was horrible. The chicken was a 1/2 inch thick and was so over cooked I could hardly chew it. Pass on this place."}
{"text":"Really disappointed in this place. Thought it was a cool local place with yummy burgers but really just a health scare with very poor service (unless you sit at the bar - the bartenders are always great service). The table servers we've had were slow, unapologetic and surly. And the food was just not worth it. I like a spot of grease when I'm craving it, but the food was overly greasy-fried, and the burger buns were dry. Not very tasty. If you want to have a junk food splurge, I can think of dozens of places where I'd line up first. Each time I've eaten there, I've left feeling nauseated. I've given Cold Beer & Cheeseburgers a 2nd and even 3rd chance because it's right near my house and my hubby seems to like it, but today broke me: they just posted something on Facebook that involved not only one of their greasy little burgers but topped with bacon and egg... with a side of doughnut. I kid you not! There's a photo!"}
{"text":"I had the the Deep South dog. Was excellent. Those tator tots though! Ashley was my server and she rocked. Will for sure be back."}
{"text":"My 2nd time here.. vibe was fun and service was good. The kitchen didn't get my order quite right.. beer was good, great selection.. burger was pretty good"}
{"text":"This was our first time here. We ride on our motorcycle with our dog and sat on the patio. We had the best burger we've had in a long time and the beers were cold. The waitress was fantastic and when we asked her name when we were paying. Her name is Bri. We just about fell off our chairs because our dog we lost last year was named Bree. It was meant to be! I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I always enjoy trying new places. The burgers were good and the menu includes a wide variety of burger options. Good beer selection as well. Service was a little slow, but we arrived at the same time as a large group that took up half the restaurant. I will definitely go back because the burger was tasty and I enjoyed the meal."}
{"text":"Great place for happy hour! Patio seating and the build your own burger option is fun. Wide selection of beers on the menu, I spotted my favorite, hard to find  Hefeweizen, Franziskaner Weissbier on the menu! Yay Me!!
Your typical Happy Hour selection of snacks: soft pretzels, chips, fried this & thats."}
{"text":"Yes mister! This place is off the chain. The food came out hot and the wait staff was attentive... The service was excellent. Had the OLine Burger with my sweet potato tots definitely worth another trip. For a appetizers we had the buffalo chicken egg rolls, this is a must have awesome. Dobson and Germann we will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Waitress shattered a 20 oz full beer in my lap. She did not even say sorry or offer to comp any of my drinks. Management did not say anything to our table as they watched the whole thing go down."}
{"text":"Great beer selection, solid cocktails, and tasty food. I really enjoyed the atmosphere. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"We went to Cold Beers and Cheeseburgers on a Friday night. We actually went to the one in Scottsdale. At the time, it was the only one. I am kinda anxious to try the one in Chandler. The atmosphere is cool and the beers are really good. The burgers are cooked very well. Finding a good burger place that doesn't kill the meat or offer you a toy with your meal is hard to find. It's a cool hangout spot with friends. I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"About 23 days ago I wrote a message on Yelp about this restaurant got a call about three days later from Zack which is in charge of customer service for this establishment explained to him the situation that taken place AND the reason I wrote what I wrote on yelp. Three days later to my surprise I received a gift card for $50 to this establishment just wanted to write back and say thank God there are still people out there that Understands  the customers come first may God bless your restaurant and may you continue to be a man of character in running your customer service department THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU"}
{"text":"The food was good.. our family tried the prime sandwich, pretzel , the Denver burger, and the 1000 burger. All were delicious... burgers are a bit messy. 
Waitresses we're very nice."}
{"text":"We tried the new location of cold beers and cheeseburgers on scottsdale Road and we're not impressed. The sprawling new location is extremely noisy and though the service was efficient and prompt, the food quality was just not there. 
What ever you do don't stray from the burger fare! My wife decided to go with the turkey burger... Big mistake, tasted more like dog food, no really!
They need to take that off the menu immediately! If you actually wanna taste a real turkey burger stick with Zin burger. 
Too bad, we liked the old place at Greyhawk, but this one is off our list."}
{"text":"Food is fantastic - service is AWFUL. My family and I have been to this location three times now over the past 2 weeks and the service each time was so slow and forgetful. Servers are a bit immature and you have to ask for everything 3-4 times. Don't expect a quick trip! You'll be waiting a while for everything."}
{"text":"I've driven by here many times and have heard many great things about this place. The rumours are true, this place has excellent burgers and food. There are so many options when it comes to burgers (around 15) along with many other dishes and sides. The service was a bit slow, but the food made up in a big way. I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"So glad they opened up this location near me! The drink choices are overwhelming however that's better than vice versa... I ordered a chicken sandwich.. can't remember the name. Basically it had bacon, pepper jack, and mayo. It was delicious and came out fully cooked and quickly. Definitely will be back and definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Lindsay was super quick and very attentive! Burgers were so yummy and my fianc√© was a little overly excited to play the PAC-MAN, Thank you !!"}
{"text":"We had a wonderful happy hour. Our truffle fries were great like last time. Tried the pretzels. Wow. They were fantastic and the frankenstein char dog and a beer. Our waitress Carlee was very nice. She gave us great service. Gotta return for the burger."}
{"text":"I love the food here. The truffle fries and burgers were delicious. The beer was cold. The wait staff. Friendly and the manager was very nice. It's great to bring picky teenagers and grandmother like me that love gourmet fries and sides."}
{"text":"Everything it's supposed to be. Great service cold beer and a TV for every sporting venue on the planet."}
{"text":"Love the lively atmosphere. Burgers are great - unless you get them to go. Twice we have tried and twice have waited for longer than the estimated pick up time and twice had something missing / wrong with order. 
In house - yes! 
Order pick up - no."}
{"text":"Very over rated.
And why is Yelp telling me this is a \"hot new business near me.\"
This location has been open for two years!"}
{"text":"Burger was ok not amazing. Service was just ok. She seemed nice but had a I don't give a crap attitude which was fine. One star because for 2 adults and one kid it cost 80 bucks before tip. You're $%=&ING joking. My god I had a burger and fries one beer 80 damn bucks. What a rip off. My burger was ok kinda bland nothing amazing. Fries are frozen. For 80 bucks it better be the best burger in the world also if you want fries it's 2 bucks extra. Didn't find that out till we got the bill."}
{"text":"Nice people, good food and  a great beer selection.

The waitress was great, and we really all enjoyed our sandwiches.  

But then again,  I had damn well better enjoy them at $13 each!! If you \"upgrade\" your side, you've got a $15 burger.  

AND, after I ordered (during happy hour BTW) I found out our beers were SEVEN DOLLARS EACH.

$22 for a meal consisting of a cheeseburger and a beer?   

Think about it -- 4 people could walk out dropping $100 for cheeseburgers, after tax and tip.  

That's just crazy.

Yes, the food was good but value is part of the equation and on that, CBCB fails."}
{"text":"I took my daughter and 9 year old granddaughter here Sunday night 03/04/2018.  Granddaughter was very dissapointed because they changed out the Giant Pac Man game for a Golf Game.  That was the main reason why we come here.  Yes the food is good and drinks are what you would expect in a sports bar.  But now we are looking for another place with a Giant Pac Man game that will allow 9 year old Princess Granddaughters."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic experience! Our server, Macy, was incredibly attentive to the adults and the kids (5 and 1) in our group. Our drinks stayed filled and she was quick to fulfill every request. The food was also fantastic. The burgers were cooked the perfection, the onions rings were crispy, and the prime dip (which I personally had) was the best I've ever had. We highly recommend."}
{"text":"Service started off a little slow but after my burger came I ate myself into a coma and forgot about the slow service.

I got a Pittsburgh burger, coleslaw and fries on the burger and it was huge. Delicious!!!

My wife got a pastrami burger and the pastrami was packed high with a half pound burger and I loved it.

Daughter got a pb and J burger with a hot mayo spread and it was amazing. The sweet and spicy jelled well together and when I return I will be ordering this burger for myself.

It is a great place, granted it was 2 pm on a Sunday a semi crowded and had a juke box playing I assume and the noise level was perfect. I could talk to the wife and kids without screaming across the table. I assume Friday night would be a different story though.

I will RETURN."}
{"text":"Was so stoked when this location opened. This area really lacked something like this.. Super convenient and the staff is always top notch. Friendly, helpful, knowledgable of menu. Service is fast and always correct. Get a lot of To Go orders and never disappointed."}
{"text":"Horrible! 
Asked for Medium Well and received a very rare burger. The staff (Iesha) ignores you so good luck sending it back. No apologies for the error or offer to remake it. Highly disappointed.  Cold Burgers and Beers would be a more suited name."}
{"text":"Solid place for a burger. They have a build your own that is my fave because you make it however you want it. Their beer is SO COLD which makes me very happy and they have a lot of great beers to choose from. My daughter is obsessed with their Mac n cheese. Weekends they have a well stocked build your own Bloody Mary Bar and mimosas. Tons of TVs so you can always watch whatever game you are interested in. Oh and they have tots for a side!  And who doesn't love tots?!?!"}
{"text":"Came 2 days in a row. Thursday great service, today, rude rude rude.   Doesn't even matter about the food when you feel like you're bothering the staff."}
{"text":"My family and have been looking forward to eating at this place since it opened. We loved the restaurant, the food, and the cleanliness! Unfortunately, we won't be returning due to the service we received today. The hostess and waitress were less than friendly. Additionally, our food took over 30 minutes (two burgers and a salad). We would understand these circumstances if the restaurant would have been packed, yet there were multiple empty tables there today. I would hate to see the kind of service on a busy night."}
{"text":"A buddy and I were out trying the new bars in our area. We were headed back to our usual on Indian School (IndSchool) Rd. but as we were sitting at the corner of 40th and IndSchool I noticed all of the TVs visible from the street. I had heard of Cold Beers... so we headed in.

Small parking lot. I don't like valet parking (just me) so we took a spot just opening up. We used the rear entrance.

We were greeted warmly and when we asked to sit at the bar our host found some seats for us at a nearly crowded bar. Bartender acknowledged us right away. I like that.

How many TVs? I don't know, but they were pleasingly everywhere. We sat on the edge of the patio at the bar on a beautiful January evening enjoying the ambiance and the people.

What a great selection of beers! Also, the menu had lots of choices of my favorite bar foods. I wanted a burger and may get one next time but I thought the price was high. Please note that I am frugal (cheap) so take my price objections with a grain of salt.

We ordered the Drumettes, classic buffalo style. The menu said 1-1/2 pounds so I, helped by my hunger, determined that the price was reasonable. They arrived in a normal amount of time, very hot, and looking tasty. We chose the ranch and the order came with two bowls (not tiny plastic cups). That was thoughtful! (and unusual) so we did not have to share. We got some celery and carrots too. 

I cannot tell you how much I enjoyed these! I will be back for more. I have eaten wings in 25 or 30 different places in the Phoenix area and I had never tasted such great wings. My buddy agreed! Very large, well cooked, great crisp, and a dry(ish) crust of the tastiest wings ever!

You should go there!

TL:DR parking is limited, nice sports bar, great wings (named drumettes), I will return!"}
{"text":"Was SO excited to try this place out now that they have a location close to me. Sad part is was inside for approximately 15 minutes and only the hostess provided my fianc√© and I water after seating us promptly. We looked over the menu and decided on a B.Y.O.M.C and a Hangover burger. We waited patiently for a waitress to great us, after about 5 minutes we started to get irritated. We decided we would wait about another 5 minutes and in this time frame multiple waitresses had walked by chitchatting but never stopped at our table or greeted us. Others where seated by the hostess as well and a waitress came right to them and greeted them. The total time spent inside was about 15 minutes and we decided that was enough and left. On the way out the manager happened to be by the door and I told him what had happened, he did offer to have something made to go but my fianc√© and I where tired of waiting already (we do appreciate the kind gesture). I hope when we return the issue is fixed, until then I will be leaving Cold Beers and Cheeseburgers one star."}
{"text":"Burgers were good. Nice to actually get a medium rare burger these days. Tater tots good too, but $2 additional for sweet tots. Kind of in line with everything else though, expensive! We were there for happy hour and they did have the American burger with fries for $8, no tots. Happy hour card on table indicated $4 drafts. Apparently that only applied to select varieties and nowhere did it say which brews. Bud Light? All our beers were $7 for a pint! That's not happy hour. Decent neighborhood sports bar but probably won't go back."}
{"text":"Pretty straight forward set up. The space is pretty much a square with TVs along every wall, a bar along one side and booths all around, with high tables in the middle. We had to go around the back to get in. The door on Indian School road off what will be the patio, was locked. At first thought they were having a soft opening or something. Service was great. Happy hour pretty average. They have a good craft beer selection, but only Four Peaks beer on special for $4 a pint. 5 or 6 appetizers for $5.50 and a burger for $8.50. We had the pretzels. 2 large pretzels with an excellent dipping mustard/cheese sauce. They were very good. Will try a burger next visit."}
{"text":"We heard this was a great place , so we thought we'd give it try. How was the food? I wouldn't know. We sat at our table for 25 minutes and never had a server come to our table.  After the server at the table next to us continually glanced our way, but never came by, we decided to leave. Will we go back? NO!"}
{"text":"Saturday night, be ready to have trouble parking. The developers of the complex didn't think that through.

I tried the PB&J burger, not terrible...but the truffle fries were way too garlicy. They have a great selection of local (and non-local) beers, and service was good!

Nice patio with heaters and a good mix of high and low top tables. They also had a fire with some patio furniture around it. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Mac and cheese was awesome!!!  The Garden Mules were delicious. The burgers were very good. Highly recommend this place. Loved how you could view on Yelp on wait time!!"}
{"text":"The staff here are nice and the service was good. However, the food was lacking.  My partner had a cheese burger, the food that is its namesake. It was  just ok. I had grilled cheese and it came out cold. We were really disappointed. 
However if you like to watch sports and drink beer, there are loads of tvs and beer on tap. Unfortunately, this place just wasn't for us."}
{"text":"Who would think a PB&J cheeseburger would knock your socks off? It did as well as the Arizona dog (sliced prime rib on a frank with a sauce that is delicious
beer was cold and service above average. The Frankenstein special, a dog and beer for $3 was a great value.
One suggestion....lower the TV's at the bar, my neck is sore from watching a game"}
{"text":"We have gone both for a Bloody Mary and brunch as well as dinner and drinks! Have had a few different burgers as well as chicken sandwiches and they're all amazing. The bar is super nice and they will turn on whatever game you want. The staff has been so nice and provided a great experience!!"}
{"text":"Amazing burgers!!!  I had the steak burger and my hubby had the Juicy Lucy.  The burgers were flavorful and delicious.  Unfortunately the wait staff was friendly, but busy and a bit slow.  Not enough to prevent us from coming back and bringing the kiddos.  Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Ordered burger \"med. well\" for take out even had the girl repeat back my order & made sure it will be med. well only slightly pink she said. Well when I got home with it...it was pretty much RARE TO MEDIUM RARE !!! Will NOT be ordering food there anymore. Too many other places that will get your order correct. The chips were good though. The order was ready on time."}
{"text":"Service was slow, drinks and food were expensive. A well whisky and diet with the glass fully packed with ice in a short glass was weak and cost $7. It took us 15 minutes to place an order, a bartender walked by us not doing anything but swinging a towel in his hands like 6 times, another bartender looked at us twice and never came over and finally another bartender who was working at the far other end of the bar noticed us and served us (she was nice). The patio is large and has misters so that helps during the hot months. Lots of TV's if you want to watch a game. Unfortunately, I probably wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"This place reminds me of the frat boy dive bars I frequented many years ago. 

Out of six burger orders: two had the wrong sides & two were ordered medium rare - but came out well done. 

Finished first round of beers on a late Sunday afternoon ... waitress disappeared after serving. We had to flag another server. 

Same thing after second round ... and the place was only half full.  

Sweet potato tater tots - very good. 

MAC & cheese - very good. 

TV's - excellent."}
{"text":"Waiting waiting waiting...we get food, food is cold, send it back, they just threw food back in the fryer so now it's extra greasy AND cold.


Too bad, since we now live right across the street."}
{"text":"I came for the soft opening, that had free All American Burgers. The burger was big and juicy! I can't wait for the restaurant opening.  

The restaurant was still being constructed inside. The grand opening is set for 2/25/15. There looks to be plenty of TV's and lots of beers to choose from!

The service was great and the menu looks excellent. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Way way way way way way way way way Overpriced. ...and flies ugh. We were blown away how much this bar food costs. Cool selections of beers but major sticker shock with the food bill. The food is better that typical bar food but no bar burger is worth $15.00! Cray crazy. We don't buy the food anymore."}
{"text":"Good food and atmosphere. Was charged for 2 appetizers when we ordered 1 but they of course took it off the bill. Good neighborhood hangout. 

Have been back a couple times since my last review. Had the hot and smokey mac and cheese and chicken wings. Both were surprisingly good."}
{"text":"I would give this place 5 stars if the cost weren't so high. These burgers are delicious, but I don't know about $15 good. I've had quite a few varieties of their burgers between this location and the old one in grayhawk - all tasty. The vibe in this location is very sports bar. It's quite loud, and difficult to hear the person sitting next to you, not to mention the bartender. This applies EVERY night of the week - even a Wednesday, which says a lot. The parking feels limited, but I never seem to not have a place to park. OH- there are TONS of beer choices! So beer lovers rejoice and have a burger too!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed on our first visit. As service was slow and lacking. Took for ever to place our drink order and even longer to place our meal. When our appetizer came out they were barley warm. Cheese sticks and truffle fries. My prime dip was very chewy and was ordered WITH OUT onions and came out with them on it. Was sent back and all they did was take them off and added more cheese. I found a small piece as I was eating it. That was a scan I hate onion and thought I was going to throw up  lol. My wife's burger was good but was over cooked. Very disappointing because I of the good reviews and wanted to find a place to celebrate mine and my wife's birthday. Not until February. We may try them again just not sure."}
{"text":"Food was decent...but slow. Wait staff does not seem at all happy to be there. They weren't necessarily rude, but did the absolute minimum. We'll try it again...hopefully it will be better"}
{"text":"I loved the food, service, and atmosphere. It's also kid friendly! I didn't like the fact that I was forced to valet my vehicle especially since it was empty."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I have been here a few times. The food is delicious. However, no matter the time of day, this place is busy. There is no waiting area inside. You're either standing outside in the heat or cold. There is also no way to call ahead and save a table. Due to those reasons, we don't visit often."}
{"text":"The food was delicious! I ordered the truffle steakhouse burger with parmesan truffle fries and was very happy. Service was prompt and attentive. Even the kids hot dog looked better than your average kids meal hot dog. Only downside was it was a little pricey for a burger and fries. My burger and fries totaled $20! I would still go again but not often."}
{"text":"Great location, awesome food. Veggie burger in the pretzel bun is amazing. But my favorite item is the buffalo chicken dip....SO good!"}
{"text":"Great burgers  service was ok. Would go back and bring friends/business associates."}
{"text":"Tons of TV's, great game day atmosphere, huge list of beers from all over, great menu. I'd live in the back if they let me."}
{"text":"I only cone here during UFC or Football. A bit high maintenance with my seating and view of the tv's, but the staff is always so accommodating to sit me in front of the perfect tele and change the channel if needed."}
{"text":"If you're in the mood for a burger, go to Cold Beers & Cheeseburgers!  The place makes excellent burgers and service is always excellent there. It's a sports bar so numerous TV screens on all the time. I'm not a sports fan and I don't find the TVs or the noise distracting."}
{"text":"Good grub, poor service. Most things on the menu are really good. They have a huge beer selection... beers come out really cold. A million tv's help make sure you don't miss your favorite team. The Yelp \"check in\" feature is awesome! The service however... wait staff seem to be focused on something other than guests, and out of 4 visits, our food has never arrived inside of 40 minutes (I've timed it). Great potential."}
{"text":"No matter the dish, no matter the time of day, no matter the flow of business in the restaurant, this location seems to ALWAYS manage to mess something up along the way.  

Forgetting food items, delivering hot food items to the table cold, entering incorrect food items into the computer, and simply providing an unprofessional, attitude-ridden experience time and time again are just a sample of reasons my wife and I will gladly drive to Old Town Scottsdale, or even Greyhawk, to avoid the Chandler CBCB."}
{"text":"This place is exactly as advertised--a sports bar with cheeseburgers and beer
I have been here several times now
The staff have always been great
The burgers have always been excellent as were their appetizers 
The selection of beer is very respectable 
Never had to wait too long even on busy days/nights. 
Will definitely be coming back"}
{"text":"The food was pretty good I had a burger. They up charge on a lot of stuff which is kind of ridic. I also tried the buffalo chicken dip, wasn't a fan. For a beer place I do think they should have frosted mugs. The Orange blossom was my fav beer! I'd come back for a drink or so."}
{"text":"We usually go to the grey hawk location but they are in transition to a new location. We love the roasted pepper cheese sauce that comes with the pretzels, it's one of a kind! And the option to customize your meal is great! Even though it's a bar we don't feel scrutinized to bring in our one year old, family friendly!"}
{"text":"The burgers were awesome. I would prefer the price to include frys or tots and not potatoe chips.
Good selection of beer and the staff was friendly."}
{"text":"Great burgers. Cant wait to go back and try the build your own mac and cheese. Got right in on a saturday night, but it got crowded quick. Will definotely come back."}
{"text":"Never had a bad meal.  I don't understand the negative reviews.  I have brought multiple people with me as well with nothing but great comments.  They even accommodated a larger party for Blackhawks game. If you love burgers,  highly recommend."}
{"text":"Well the burgers and beer were great! It was a happy vibe. Pretty sure they are always busy. The wait was not bad, however. Great place. Oh and they honor the 10% discount for checking in so that was nice too!!!"}
{"text":"Great place. Chauncey is great. Burgers are fabulistic! Don't spend the extra 2 bucks for fries. The potato chips are friggin awesome. There is a wide variety of beers and wines.  It's nice to be in 100 degree temps with the garage doors open with misters.  This is our 1st time here to get out and about to stay cool... we will be back."}
{"text":"If there is any sporting event on, this place is very crowded and loud. It's definitely a step up from the office, which was there before. Very open and lots of room, totally gutted and renovated. Huge beer tap selection and tvs on every wall. Food was good and service was great as well. It's around the corner from my house and I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"My husband and I were hesitant to go there from some of the past reviews... We only had an hour for lunch today. We were seated right away, the waitress took our order in a timely manner and the food came out exactly as we ordered it. Hot and Fresh! The food was very good and the service was excellent. The manager came over to talk with us and he was as friendly as could be. The prices are on the high side, but the menu is on line and you can check it out before you arrive so you know what your bill should be at the end with no surprises.  We would definitely go there again!!"}
{"text":"Food is great, service is great, and great place to watch sports! I recommend going to this restaurant."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and have been really  disappointed. I thought that a place with cheeseburgers in the name would be able to make a great one, but not here. The burgers are overpriced and nothing special. 

The French fries are the worst I've ever had at a restaurant. They are the frozen kind you can find at any grocery store except somehow worse than if you were to make them yourself. 

The tap water tastes like sewer water. 

The only positive about this place is the amount of TVs and beers they have. I would only recommend going here if you are not expecting to eat any food."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place, I had bookmarked it a while back and when the dinner opportunity came up I was super stoked. It's not too far from my house, and the prices didn't look to bad. Plus, they had a happy hour. Score!

When we got there, it wasn't too busy, which is good. There must've been a memo I didn't get about screaming children though. I'm all for family restaurants, but this restaurant is actually pretty tiny, and the tables are smooshed together. We had the lucky opportunity to sit next to the loudest of the kids, so the first half of our visit was not great. 

Our waitress, that's another review all on its own. I don't know why, but I have an issue with restaurant dress codes. I don't need to see a girl wearing shorts so short that the bottom of her bum is sticking out. This was pretty much all of the female staff. She greeted us right away, which was good, but then it took about 10 minutes for ice water . . . then she only took one alcohol order. I had said I wasn't sure what I wanted, but she didn't come back for another fifteen or so minutes. That was annoying. She was pretty absent from then on. refills were sporadic, so we had to hold on to what we had. Not sure when the next refill would come.

When we finally got to ordering (I'll admit it took us awhile because we are pretty chatty) I was famished. I ordered mac n cheese (duh) and everyone else ordered a burger. The mac n cheese I ordered had broccoli and chicken in it, my favorite combination. However, when the mean came out, for some reason there was no chicken in it . . . and the cheese had hardened on the top, which makes me think it had been sitting for a while before being brought out. The waitress noticed I had no chicken, so she brought me out a piece on grilled chicken on a side plate. This was the tiniest, thinnest, piece of 'chicken' i've ever seen.

The food was tasty however, so no complaints (minus no chicken and cold mac n cheese).

All in all, probably would come again, but not for beer, it was very expensive, (between 4 of us, we had bout 12 beers and it was $90 during happy hour?). I also would probably not recommend it unless you are prepared for the unwatched screaming children and over priced beer."}
{"text":"Second time coming to this location and once again the food was so so. I've been to the one in old town and it's one of my favorites. That staff here is awesome and so is the management. My drink was never empty the whole time I was there. I got the 1000 island burger and I was not amazed and not cooked to my liking. The atmosphere is great, tons of TV's to watch the big game and a great patio. Again, service is great but I know the food could be much better. I'm not giving up on this place just won't be back for a while."}
{"text":"Not sure what all the hype on this place is about... The ambiance is decent, I'll give them that. But the food was not good at all. Maybe we just got the wrong things? When I asked for recommendations from our server she gave us short, uneducated answers and had a bit of an attitude. Chicken fingers were about the same quality as the frozen ones at the grocery store.. I asked for ranch to hide the taste a bit and waited ten minutes for someone (not even our server) to bring it. Only to find out later that we were charged for it! We also got a French dip with au jus. Both the sandwich and dip were WAAAYYY to salty to eat. Disgusting. 

Atmosphere: 4/5. Decent patio, new building. 

Service: 1/5. Server did the bare minimum. Also should have warned us that they charge for ranch/extra sauce.. I've always been warned by servers at places that do that. 

Food: 1/5. Chicken strips were edible but barely, French dip was beyond disgusting. 

I might go again to try the burgers that everyone loves so much and give the place another shot, given that it's so close to my place, but my first experience was not good at all."}
{"text":"Tried to go there last night and it was a 45 minutes wait. Went back today for lunch. The inside is small and was very noisy at lunch time, so we sat outside. My daughter ordered a hot dog with cheese slices on it. When it was brought to the table the cheese was burnt black. We sent it back. When the next hot dog arrived it was burnt. She ate about 4 bites because she was hungry. My wife ordered the wings. They were rubbery and tasted fair. I tried two of them and was not impressed. My son had a plain hamburger and we ordered it cooked medium. It came out medium well. I had one of their specialty burgers and it was ok.  It was a little over cooked too. When my kids needed refills on their drinks I went inside and had to refill them myself. Twice we asked the waitress for extra napkins. She never brought them. Had to get them myself. I talked with the manager about the wings and hot dog not being right. He did take those items off the bill. We will never go here again."}
{"text":"If you like great burgers and onion rings and wall to wall TVs with every sports events you can think of you found your heaven.
Huge juicy burgers and onion rings to perfection.
To say I will be back is a huge under statement."}
{"text":"So I have been here 3 times now.  With it being open, I wanted to give it a few chances due to it being so new.  However, it got a bit worse each time.  So here we go!

The Good 4-5 Star
Food is good and well cooked, usually.  My last visit, the burger was overdone, but it was being cooked for almost an hour!  More on that later.  The Chili Tater Tots are delicious!

The Bad 2-3 star
Service is slow, and wait times on food are ridiculous.  The last time we went in, we waited over 45 minutes for our food once we ordered.  Burgers and Fries.....that is a long time!  I would say that our server did a good job, but she was swamped and we just got passed over a bit too often.  Also if you want basic fries, it is $2 more.  This is a burger place!

The Ugly - 1 star
No one in the place seems to have experience serving or hosting.  We were seating in a soaking we booth, that i had to ask to be dried and then continue to dry with my butt after.  out of the 3 girls at the hostess stand, 2 looked pissed or indifferent to be there. Especially the short, brunette one.  She is RUDE!!

All in all, i may come again later, but for now, the price is 50% higher than Zipp's and the food isn't good enough to warrant that with the service being off."}
{"text":"Such great food! I love building my own burger! You can never go wrong with ordering anything off their menu!!! You should definitely try the buffalo dip!!! Also, sit at the bar because we find that they have faster service at there. Sometimes it takes a while to get your food, but overall nice people work there and are happy to help you."}
{"text":"One of my pet peeves is places that nickel and dime and this is one of them. The surcharges on things add up-from taters in a kids meal vs getting chips was extra. Then b/c my son ordered a root beer as his soda (which I did see beverages come with kids meals) we were charged 3.00. The server was pleasant enough until I brought these things to her attention when the bill came in a non confrontational way and she kinda ditched her attention toward us afterwards. My other sons hot dog bun was stale. I saw a manager on the way out and asked about the extras - he explained rootbeers are extra b/c they are bottled and taters are indeed extra. All these extraneous items add up and make for one expensive \"burger meal\". He said he would speak with the waitstaff so they are more informative upon ordering and was apologetic which I appreciated."}
{"text":"I can't rate the food. I can only rate the greeting. The hello was good, but the time estimate was deterring. \"It could take anywhere from 20-40 minutes or maybe more for a table to open up based on when people leave from the first game.\" It doesn't encourage a person to stay. Sounds like seating is possible, but not guaranteed. We didn't wait. Went to one of the other delicious restaurants in the parking lot that was able to give us a wait time, and seated is within that time. 
A little more training might be needed for the hostess desk. Uncertainty is not the signal you want to send at the entry."}
{"text":"Service is not the greatest, but this place is great for watching any kind of sports and enjoying a great selection of beer! The food is really good as well. Lots of burger options and the typical bar food. I love that they offer tater tots as a side!

**Update** I appreciate the manager's acknowledgement of the service. By no means is the service horrible, but it can be slow and may take the waitresses longer than usual to get to your table depending on how busy it is. Understanding when they have lots of customers to help, but at time when you're on a time crunch it's not very convenient. Overall I still love this place!"}
{"text":"I don't get the low reviews for this place. I come here for snacks and beer every Monday evening with my basketball group and always have a good time. I can't say that I have fully explored the menu but I can say I have a few favorites.

1. Killer hot wings. Some night super spicy, some nights not so much. Always delicious. I think they throw them on the grill after they sauce them which adds awesome flavor. One of my favorite wing spots in town.

2. Cheese burger sliders. Sooooo good. Little bit of cheese and saut√©ed onions with some salty au jus. I could eat a half dozen, but I wouldn't feel good about it.

3. Beer. Ya ya ya lots of place have beer. This place has a great selection and they always have my favorite lagunitas IPA on tap. 

The staff is always friendly and doesn't mind a bunch of sweaty and stinky dudes rolling in late on a Monday night. 

Will be back next Monday, and all Mondays in the foreseeable future."}
{"text":"I came here with a group and they were super accommodating with us. They let us stay and wait for almost 2 hours because we were waiting on other people.

The menu has a wide variety of items to choose from. They have a build your own Mac and Cheese option or build your own burger. The best times to go are during their happy hours because it's unlimited toppings. I built my own Mac and Cheese which was very delicious. Everyone else had cheese burgers which looked really good. Definitely a lot of food.

Our waitress was very patient and fast with us. I know having a large group like ours could be overwhelming but she handled us very well. Our drinks were always filled and our food came out promptly.

This place was pretty fun. They have a ton of TVs around with different channels and a giant Pac Man arcade machine. This would be a great place to catch a game and hang out with friends. I would probably come here during happy hour, though. All in all, I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"So I'm giving a 2-star opposed to one the service wasn't that bad. Especially since it was a Friday at happy hour. He had a decent size group login and had a table at about 5 ish clock. She did not know happy hour specials for preferred not tell us because had I known that there were many specials like craft beer and appetizers I would have gotten food. Unfortunately I was not informed of any of this and just got a beer. Then I was not informed that happy hour ends at 6 p.m. opposed to 7 p.m. like some places and being 5 minutes late after happy hour I was still informed that it ended she did not check on us beforehand to see if we wanted anything before happy hour ended. So I can't tell you how the food on happy hour taste for how the craft beers on happy hour were because I was not informed and then not even allowed to get a regular beer after happy hour. Not a good experience will not be back"}
{"text":"Food was good, The service not so much from my point of view. I went there with a group of other 6 girls to have our weekly get together. The waitress threw our checks in the middle of the meal while we were still having wine and drinks. We weren't asked if we wanted something else like a refill or another glass of wine. She took the cards and close our tabs pretty fast and I was Ok with that because I thought she would come back but she didn't even though we were still there for like another hour. I was there sitting and drinking my melted ice and waiting ANY of the waitress to come back or make eye contact so I could order dessert and another drink on a different tab, but none of them ever came even though we waved our arms and the thing is the girls weren't that busy. One was just talking and giggling with a group of guys at the bar, another was just taking care of 2 older guys in another table which I usually wouldn't mind if I could only had a chance to order what I wanted."}
{"text":"Why CB&CB? Why do you constantly disappoint? I love your Scottsdale location and your food is so good! The Chandler location always has the worst service. I live right next door to this location and they are 1 for 5 so far. Today my husband and I sat at the bar for 15 minutes and left after being passed up by the bartenders multiple times. We sit at the bar because generally you receive faster when right infront of the bartender - this is the exception. If you would like to be completely ignored - have a seat at the bar. Want your order wrong? Sit at a table. Want a good experience? Don't come here. Visit the Scottsdale location."}
{"text":"Fun place with lots of good burger food. Hopping atmosphere.  Loved the huge choice in burgers and my vegetarian friend highly approved the veggie burger. Service was quick and friendly. (Had frequented the place prior to its new owner/remodel. The improvement in light, decor and crowd seating was a ten. )"}
{"text":"Tip: Order the tots extra crispy! CB2 is an awesome neighborhood spot. We come here after league, to watch football, or have lunch on Saturday like now. It can get a little nuts for NFL games but that's half the fun."}
{"text":"Just to keep this review as simple as possible. 

Took 15 minutes for my Gram to get her Gin&Tonic after ordering. Waited 35 minutes to get our food.
My brothers fries were disgusting; stale and chewy (normally they're delicious). Cooks forgot to add grilled tomatoes to my Grams veggie burger entree. I asked THREE times for a water (from the point of service up until roughly 15 minutes after getting our food delivered to the table) to which I got up to get it myself as the waitress turned the corner to give me one. The grilled wings are normally amazing, but I didn't finish mine because a couple of the wings on my plate tasted old (thick, chewy). Extremely sub par. 

I was about to give 2/5 stars before posting because of how much I love the Old Town Scottsdale location, but now I'm irritated again. 1/5 stars it is. You can do much, MUCH better CB&C- such a let down. Don't know if I'd ever go back to this location now; bummer."}
{"text":"Good food, good beer. I had the Rocky Point burger, which was awesome. But, I'm knocking it down a star because the prices are a bit steep for the amount of food you get."}
{"text":"Great Place! Food was good and beers were good. They even had a special for Fathers day. Dads eat free!! Taylor our waitress was sweet and made our dinner there nice."}
{"text":"Meh. Claims to be \"award winning\" but it was honestly just another burger in my opinion. Our waitress seemed a little air headed as she didn't hear my girlfriends burger order and only brought out her side."}
{"text":"I ate here with my girlfriends tonight and we were very disappointed. Not sure if they were having an off night but one of the orders with 'chicken' in the name was missing the chicken. I sent back to the kitchen and then they left off another key ingredient the second time around. My girlfriends meal had a hair in the food and she was immediately done! The manager came around to make things right promising to comp those two meals. I assured him I didn't need that but he insisted. I was very impressed by his tenacity to make things right, but sure enough the bill comes around and all of our food is on there. He did nothing to relay the message apparently. It just puts a bad taste in my mouth with the manager promising one thing but not actually going through with it. The location in old town Scottsdale is 10 times busier but also gets my order right every time."}
{"text":"This is someone with a lot of free time and money to burn pipe dream of a resturaunt and it shows. It's a concept joint that was created in a corporate office somewhere without regard for food quality is my best guess. I am amazed at the sheep that flock here in droves. The main ingredient and star of the show is supposed to be the Hamburger. It's a tasteless puck and low quality without any sizzle, literally. Adding PB and J to it does not make it any better along with all the other \"special\" burgers and ingredients they offer. Sorry, but I am sticking with In and Out, Freddie's , Five Guys or will grind my own at home and staying away. You could go buy Prime steaks at Costco and throw in some Crab legs for good measure and still not spend what you would here for 3 or 4 people."}
{"text":"I usually wait to review some place until I have been there a few times to get an overall sense of the establishment but I just cannot stop thinking about my experience here the other day. 

It was awesome, food was delicious, atmosphere was inviting and the wait staff was really on point. Of course we had a cheeseburger but we also ordered wings and the hot dog my daughter was served off of the kids menu was amazing! 

I am beyond excited that one is opening down the street from me, we will be in often!"}
{"text":"Cold Beers & Cheeseburgers is a good place to grab a burger and watch the game.

The food is decent and you can create your own burger - which I love. 

I give them 3-stars because the beer list isn't exactly what I was expecting from a place with \"cold beers\" in the name. I wasn't blown away by the selection and my beer came out a bit foamy and not exactly \"cold.\"

Overall, a solid choice for sports fans and I would be willing to give the brews another shot."}
{"text":"This was our 1st visit and our friend's 3rd time around. Our waitress was polite and checked in w/us while we waited for them. Our burgers were good and messy and our beers hit the spot. We will be back"}
{"text":"All I can say is prime rib sliders and sweet tots! Great new addition to the neighborhood!! Third time to visit and as always busy , good service and yummy food."}
{"text":"A good place to go to see watch the game on Sundays. They do have a veggie burger that's vegan, but none of the buns are vegan so I have to get it on lettuce. Healthier, which is nice but sometimes I just want bread haha. They have a few good ciders, which has been my drink of choice lately. Plus the fries are bomb. The service is usually decent. Sometimes I feel like the servers check up on you too much, except for when you need them haha but overall I like this place."}
{"text":"We came here and got a burger asked for it med and let's just say it was very cold and raw in the middle (so raw ,raw ,raw) told our bar tender Austin to please show the cook .we made a ball with the raw meat  and told him I hope we don't get sick and to please show the cook so he knows . (Yes we ate most of it )He said he would as he put our plate in his tub and continued to serve other people.sorry but this is heath hazard and Truly not ok...Only reason I gave it a two stars was because it's clean and nice and had good flavor even for a raw burger.. ohhh yeah homemade chips were horrible and I usually love all home made chips these tasted like old grease  and nothing else"}
{"text":"Ok so don't buy the larger beer for $1.50 it's the exact size as the small  we checked it out as well as the guy behind us .so all your paying for is the handle on the mug.. very deceptive and not cool!!!
The foods all right  service isn't bad,but when you try to pull a fast one on your customers your darn right dirty dog."}
{"text":"Bring your appetite!  Food is delish and BIG.      Nice patio with lots of shade.  Great place to watch a game."}
{"text":"OK.....really enjoy this place....very good food, usually good service and ok prices. A nice local place for a reasonable time out. Didn't give it more stars as your server will continually offer side options without clarifying that what they are suggesting costs extra."}
{"text":"The burgers are good, don't get me wrong. But I'm not quite sure they are worth the price. It doesn't come with fries, they are an extra $2. Also, I understand its a bar, but does the music really need to be so loud, at 11am on a Saturday? I was practically yelling across the table to talk."}
{"text":"Yummmmm!!!! We came here on a Thursday at about 5 and there was no wait. We ordered the pb&j bacon burger and the blue cheese and bacon burger and OMG they were good. They were super messy to eat which was a good thing!! The peanut butter and jelly paired with the bacon was surprisingly good. It had all the flavors- sweet jelly, salty peanut butter and bacon, sour pickles (on the side), a super soft yummy bun, and the burger was cooked perfectly medium. My husband blue cheese burger was also cooked perfectly and delicious. We ordered the kids Mac and cheese for our daughter and it was so good also. The pasta was not macaroni but some twisty noodles that were fun. Very cheesy but not overly cheesy. Everyone was very friendly and helpful and making sure our table was taken care of. So happy to have one in the west valley!"}
{"text":"Great experience! 

Had the CB&CB...so good! 

We've been a few times, but this was the best experience so far! Had a great waitress, Allison. Drinks never ran out, order was perfect, and just the right amount of follow-up. Going to ask for her each time!

Definitely a place to check out!"}
{"text":"we sat at the bar and service was fine but both our meals were a bit on the salty side . I think me not drinking alcoholic beverages was a nuisance since we sat at the bar but it was UFC night and the seating was packed."}
{"text":"Ugh!! Right now upset with CB&CB. Was here week ago and service/food not as good as Scottsdale location. Now tonight kitchen closes way before full closure, tried calling before coming over and no answer. Right now just like and other restaurant, nothing special."}
{"text":"I'm not to fond of the environment.. It seems.. Not dingy, but divey.. I think if they made this place a bit more modern it could be awesome! Anyways, the cutest little thing named Tara was our server and she was super sweet and attentive regardless of the many tables she seemed to be tending to. The burgers were delicious of course, but the shakes were even better!!! Definitely recommend and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Burger was good not great, and it's over priced. Was there on a Saturday night with my kids, they had a great time.  David's Original Hamburgers down the street in scottsdale are much better for half the price, but no ambiance at all.  Beer was good and cold, I'd go back."}
{"text":"Came here with my husband and in laws. First time.

The service was okay. It was pretty slow for a place that had no one in it, on a weekday, at lunch time. 

There were FLYS EVERYWHERE!!!! Seriously! The whole meal, we were swatting flies away from our faces, our table, our meals, our drinks. It was really obnoxious. They has these big doors open to the patio area, with no one even out on the patio area. If you're gonna have the doors open, find a solution for the flies please. That is just gross. 

For a place with cheeseburger in the name, the burger was downright bad. First of all, it came out cooked wrong. Supposed to be well done, came out not rare but RAW. Yuck. 
The food took forever and I had the food that should have taken the longest. How did you manage to undercook it this bad???
By the time my burger came back, the rest of the family was done eating. No manager ever stopped by or touched our table.
When the burger did make it's way out, it had clearly been squashed over the hottest area of the grill. It tasted burned and was HARD. The first bite was not that good but after it came back it was REALLY NOT GOOD. All in all, a HARD PASS ON THE BURGER PATTY. 

As far as the dressings of the burger, it was the \"Mac n' Cheese burger (something like that). It was a gross patty on a plain bun, with their \"Homemade mac n' cheese\". The pasta was just that... pasta! It was dry, bordering on being crunchy. There was no cheese flavor, no cheese color. It didn't even smell like cheese. There was no additional slice of cheese on the burger... It was just plain sad. Some Kraft mac n' cheese would have done the trick but these guys tried to get fancy and it did not work out. I couldn't believe there was not a single condiment or dressing on this bun besides this pasta. Really poorly done. 

The fries were passable. I wouldn't go back there for them but I had the regular and they were a 6/10. My husband had the sweet potato tater tots. Those were delicious. Definitely the brightest spot in this whole meal. 
My mother in law had a salad that she really enjoyed and I wish I had gotten (I was in the mood for a cheeseburger!). My father in law had a club sandwich that also looked tasty. 
I do think they have some decent food here but you have BURGER in your name... I wanted a BURGER!!! I feel like if you have the balls to put \"Cheeseburgers\" right in your name, you had better make a damn good one!!!!!! 

Really disappointed!"}
{"text":"I had the sexy macaroni and cheese burger. It was dripping with cheese and large pasta noodles. The onion rings are large and seasoned, so crispy! The burger is so thick, I got it medium. It was nice and juicy and made a pool of juice in the bottom bun so I couldn't eat the whole bun. The Mac n cheese was so good and it was my first time having a Mac n cheese burger. It had tomatoes and bacon but the bacon was lost in the sandwich. 
The wings were also good and a decent size! They were nice and saucy like I like them! Juicy wings of perfection! They played a lot of 80s retro music including dancing queen and the YMCA song from the village people. It's like I'm at a gay bar! I like the placemats that you can color...wait were those for kids? My bad!!!"}
{"text":"AMAZE BALLS!!!! Service 5 stars! COLD BEER 5 stars!! Food 6 stars!!!! Waitress was great at recommendations! Recommended a great beer and even better burger!! Had the PB&J cheese burger. Hands down the best burger I have ever ate!!!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately, I have to modify my review of this location.  I have been going to this location for a number of years, and my most recent experience was absolutely horrible.  The staff is still super friendly and attentive, but the quality of the product was bad.  I went in on Wednesday for Build Your Own Burger night, and me arriving was the only thing that went right.  I ordered a beer while waiting, and it was a bit flat.  My burger was delivered after 20 minutes.  Some of the toppings were cold and there were a number of items missing that I had requested.  My burger was also so salty that I could not eat it.  The staff had a new one made, and when it was delivered, it was still overly salted.  I was extremely disappointed with the quality of the food and beer.  Hopefully this issue is addressed as I really enjoy going to this location."}
{"text":"My parents are in from out of town and after we trekked our way up and back Pinnacle Peak, we decided to reward ourselves with burgers.  Having taken them to Indulge Burger the last time they were here, Cold Beer and Cheeseburgers had something to live up to.  

They definitely came through for us.  We had the grilled asparagus appetizer along with the soft pretzel (what?  We just got done hiking and you can eat anything after you work out, FYI)  and both were VERY good.  The asparagus was cooked perfectly and well seasoned.  The pretzel was soft, hot and salted well, but not too much.  

I had the Juicy Lucy burger, which was medium rare just like I requested.  Melty cheese in the middle with a side of tots (they even offer tot-chos, the decadant tater tot/nachos which was one thing we actually didnt try), it was amazing.  My mom had a veggie burger which had great flavor, and the sweet tots which are sweet potato tots, which I had never had and were quite good.  My dad's burger was also cooked to his liking, with lots of luscious onion rings on the side.  

They have a selection of hot dogs also, and a build your own macaroni and cheese option also.  YUM.  There was also something about homemade chips with buffalo sauce and blue cheese that I'll try after my next mountain.  

Staff was friendly and prompt.  Great bottled beer selection including my favorite: Bell's Two Hearted Ale and of course, Sierra Nevada."}
{"text":"Awesome burgers!  I ordered it medium well, and it was perfectly done.  I'd heard that these folks used to own Arcadia Tavern in Phoenix, and they also were known for burger excellence."}
{"text":"The onion dip is the best I have ever had! The beer is cold with a good selections and the bacon blue cheese burger was delicious and I really liked the house chips. The service was excellent. I say give it a try!"}
{"text":"Food and service was amazing (thank you \"Sam\"). Sat outside on a beautiful evening and watched our favorite football team - love all the TVs. Delicious food.

{"text":"This place is waaay too noisy.  The sound system was just blasting when we were there and combined with everyone trying to shout over it we left with our ears literally ringing. The people next to us got up and left due to the noise level. The food was ok but if I get a sore throat from having to scream conversation at my dinner companion it isn't enjoyable or worth the price."}
{"text":"It was our first time at the establishment! We met friends there before we went to a movie. The outside area nice and the inside was in keeping with a Sports Bar atmosphere. They had a expansive beer selection and the menu had something for everyone! We enjoyed our server who was attentive and made helpful suggestions for us! My husband had the veggie burger which looked good, Mine was the Blue Burger and that was very flavorful as well! It was a good time and a wonderful meal- we will come back again...Thank
Update-
Second visit was just a pleasant as the first! Great burgers and fries! Nice beer selection as well!!"}
{"text":"The Good: 
-The burgers are good for the most part. I ordered the Arizona burger and was pretty happy with it, and they have many other unique choices that I would like to try.
-Solid beer selection
-There are plenty of TVs, so it's a good place to watch a game if you don't care about hearing the commentary

The Bad:
-Long wait time for service
-Although the burger tasted good, the bottom bun disintegrated quickly and so I had to eat the second half of the burger with a knife and fork
-Complimentary valet is unnecessary and leaves people feeling guilty about not tipping, or going out of their way to take out cash (since no one carries cash anymore) or download an app. I suppose it's nice that Phoenix businesses are trying to create jobs that way...ha
-A little expensive compared to other, similar options

I would go back for sure, but CB&C is not a place that you absolutely must visit."}
{"text":"Overall I would rate CBCB 3.5 stars, but since that is not an option I will round up and give them the benefit of the doubt ;)

First: THE BURGERS

Are delicious and you can tell that they use high quality beef - my fav item to order is the cheeseburger sliders w/ au jus to dip them in - simply YUMMY!!

Second: THE BEERS

Are awesome, plus they have a fairly extensive beer list for it's size - my fav beer is an orange blossom flavored Hefeweizen.  

Third: THE PRICE

Is moderate - I wouldn't say that it's cheap here, but I also wouldn't say it's overly expense ... You have to keep in my this is N Scottsdale and the rents/overheard are high up here ... But with that being said I would eat here more frequently of the price was slightly more reasonable.

Last but not least: THE SERVICE

Is okay/mediocre - I have eaten here several times since it first opened, and the service is inconsistent - sometimes you may have to wait 20+ min. and other times it's about 10min... Sometimes the server is good and remembers your order, and other times it's a nightmare.  

The reason I would rate it a 3.5 specifically has to do with the moderately high prices and average service - if the service was better & they dropped the price points a few dollars I would absolutely rate this establishment a 5"}
{"text":"Met my friends for lunch on Saturday & was tended to right away. The staff here are very nice & really helpful. Bought a gift card for one of the friends I was meeting up with for lunch...his Christmas present from me...& got that taken care of before each friend arrived. 

Many tvs featuring different sports/games, music playing in the place. Not loud & overbearing like some sports bars are. Perfect ambience overall. 

Waitress kept me hydrated with drink refills as I was waiting for my friends & she was just as awesome & efficient when my friends arrived.  

Two of us ordered the Bacon Bleu (me being one of them), one got the Pit, & the fourth got the Reuben. 3 of us got the chips with our order, & the fourth got tater tots. Our food arrived in a timely manner & was very, very delicious! 

I will say the food is a little pricey for my liking but very well worth it! I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant to get a good cheeseburger and beer. I haven't had a burger quite as good as this in a long time. They had a lot of different beers on tap and in bottles. For a hamburger, I chose something I was familiar with, the Juicy Lucy invented in Minneapolis. They had a variation of it that was hot with buffalo sauce called a Juicy Luci'fer. If you like hot, try it. I cut mine in quarters so no sauce spilled out. I was completely pleased with the experience. It's hard to get into sometimes. I went for lunch and sat on the patio."}
{"text":"Cheese burgers, beers and...... a DISGUSTING dirty bar.... eat up folks..... good food, unhealthy dead bugs and rotting old food..... BIG DISAPPOINTMENT FOR THE HIGH PRICE for just a few beers and a snack too.... and we mentioned it to the bartenders and they just shrugged their shoulders and asked us if we wanted another. They are OK, but REALLY need to clean their act up and get this place in shape!!!"}
{"text":"Fun place... but maybe the loudest restaurant I have ever been in.   Very tough to have a conversation.  
GREAT ring of fire burger!!!!
But bland French dip sandwich and tasteless Cole slaw. 
So sad you have to pay $2 extra to get French fries with your $13 burger (instead of the standard potato chips - which are not that good)...
I'll go back... but bummed about the above issues, which could be easily addressed by management."}
{"text":"Been here 3 times so far.  The staff has treated me and my family well, the food I got tasted very good, and the beers have been good as well.  I'm not sure where these bad reviews came from because I've never had the issues people are complaining about."}
{"text":"I live around the corner, so naturally I find myself in here a lot. Okay service. Food comes out in a decent amount of time. Beers are way better than the burgers. Truffle fries are way too salty, but that could be just personal taste. All in all, an ok joint that I'm thankful to live across the street from. Wish they had a cool happy hour or something."}
{"text":"Great beer selection and okay food from my first experience. I ordered sliders and they were presented pretty poorly for a cheeseburger restaurant lol See picture) service was bad in the sense the bartenders didn't seem to want to be there and made zero effort to make conversation or
 build rapport. Nothing was said to us beside \"another one?\" Or \"you guys good?\" Disappointed but will give it another shot"}
{"text":"Awesome place. Great menu. Atmosphere and food excellent. Must drop by and try for yourself 

Service friendly and first class"}
{"text":"Although the location was fairly busy because it was a Friday night, our bartender and server took great care of us tonight! The bar top was packed with people so I thought it would be a while till I was able to order drinks, but once Keli acknowledged me she immediately took my order and was super quick. Then my server, Kaytlan, provided great recommendations for our meals and was able to order my boyfriend 'The O-Lineman' when though it wasn't on the menu! Great service, great food, and great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Went with my college age kids on the recommendation of a neighbor. Decent burger joint. Nothing special about the burgers, temps tends to be a little under what you ask for, service is slow and it was loud. The Hellfire Chip appetizer is very good. I'll have to try them out for happy hour some time."}
{"text":"The food we actually GOT was okay. 

We asked for recommendations on appetizers and the server recommended some kind of buffalo chicken eggrolls...said they were her favorite. We took her suggestion and ordered those and one other appetizer. 

We then put in our order for food. 

Appetizers never came. 

Then the food came out...well...3 of the 4 meals came out. 
Haha. The 4th was a few minutes later which was super awkward for the 3 of us who got our food. 

Mine was a burger and the burger was good...cooked as ordered, etc... but I ordered sweet potato tots and got regular. When the 4th meal finally came out, we asked about the tots. They brought a bowl of sweet potato tots out. Thank goodness they left me the regular ones because the sweet ones were cold, soggy, and pretty gross. 

The server never noticed that she didn't bring our appetizers. Of course, she didn't come back very often, so maybe that was why. Luckily they weren't on the bill, so we didn't have to argue about that. It took long enough to get the check and get it back that any additional delay would have been torture.  

OH! And the parking was AWFUL. It was Wednesday so I can't even IMAGINE what it must be like on a weekend! We had to drive around the entire shopping center three times and finally ended up parking at another restaurant (BLD) and walk through some kind of smelly drainage area to get to the restaurant. 

In the end, even though this place was close to my house, I don't think I'll go back unless someone else reeeeeeally wants to go."}
{"text":"I visited again today and Brittany, Raylin and Lizzie were exceptional.
As always the food and atmosphere were extraordinary"}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped by to grab a bite to eat last Friday night.  The place was packed!  I was pleasantly surprised by the great customer service and how fast the food came out.  The only reason I'm not going to give them 5 stars is because the food was not amazing.  It was good, but not great and I do not give 5 starts to restaurants that do not have great food."}
{"text":"This place was pretty good.  I am a big burger person. We brought the little guy and he loved it.   Service was good.   It's kind of dive bearish, and the first high chair we picked was broken, but overall food good service good so no complaints here.   I would def go back"}
{"text":"Great food, friendly and fast service. Have gone here multiple times and will go back many more. No matter how weird the bacon PB&J burger cheeseburger sound, it's really good! I thought it sounded gross the first time I saw it on the menu but the server said it was the staff's favorite and now I get it every time."}
{"text":"The name is bomb. The atmosphere is great! Especially during a football game, and there is something to be said about their beer selection.  I was so incredibly bummed with my dinner though...

I ordered the french dip...I think - some type of beef loaded hoagie. Anywho, the beef was simply awful. I felt like I was eating cold cardboard. It was literally stiff and flavorless.  I was so disappointed.  I took a few bites, put it down, and started munching on my husbands wings.  Those were good!

I would certainly recommend this place for sports and beer, but I'm holding off on returning for food...given the name, I'm sure the cheeseburgers are excellent!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in while working in town, friendly staff and great atmosphere. Tons of TVs, great place to watch an games."}
{"text":"I was worried about this douchie chain coming to our neighborhood BUT I am now a fan. I don't really like sports bars but this place is way better than Zipps. Also, Jenna the bartender is awesome. So friendly and easy to talk to. THATS what Arcadia bars are about and that's why you get five stars. Let her know please  We will be back."}
{"text":"(l don't understand the overall low ratings, but I'm here to review differently!) 

Excellent choice dining here with fellow Yelpers and a farewell, scratch that...see you later event! Super cool place. It's social, comfortable, the staff is great.  I enjoyed checking out the burger challenge board and having it explained. NUTSO that someone actually ate 14 burger patty in only 75 minutes?!!!!! We dined out at the patio, everyone including outside our party of 8 was having a good time also. Cool vibes, packed and well worth us enjoying dinner here. We made it in time for HH specials and were honored the special checkin discount. We all ordered the HH \"American Burger\" and it came with your choice of side: fries or chips, if you'd like a different side replacement: onion rings, sweet potato fries or tots and or side salad, just an additional $2.

The burger was coupled perfectly to order, I requested medium rare, quality beef, juicy and favorable.

A Special Thank You to their amazing server (Nadine)!!!! She is super sweet, works hard and does a great job that was noticed and appreciated!!!! :)

We'll all return!!!!"}
{"text":"Bad service last night. Samie is a horrible server. Had to flag down the hostess twice, once to a second beverage to sip while eating my burger. The host told the server, then she brought me a different bee than what i was drinking, I told her, she laughed it off and said do you still want this? At this point I'm thirsty, the burger was spicy and I took it. Soon after, My guest finishes his beer, and again we need to flag the host over to our table to get him a second beer. Mind you  he ate his entire meal while waiting for his second beer. The icing on the cake is she then comes over to tell us she is leaving and wants us to cash out with her. Unacceptable. No reason to go back there."}
{"text":"This is an update to my former (negative) review. I have yet to go back, but in the meantime I was sent a gift card in the mail from \"McKenzie\" per the request of \"Alecia\" who I believe is an owner. It was a kind gesture and I certainly wasn't wanting anything like this. In fact, as kind as it was, maybe another valuable way to use gift cards is to make an employee incentive program that rewards exemplary standards, initiative and/or positive reviews. Anyway, thank you for addressing my concerns and I wish you all the best."}
{"text":"My partner and I were getting ready to start our Sunday Funday drinking at BS West on 7/28/13 and we decided it might be a good idea to eat first seeing as we haven't eaten all day.  CBCB is within walking distance from the club so we decided we'd check it out. We were greeted at the door and were taken to a booth. There were many different sporting events on the televisions. I was pleased to see that they were showing the soccer game, with a lot of soccer fans in attendance at CBCB. It was USA vs. Portugal, which we won 1-0, WOOT WOOT! But the server was nice and brought us waters right away. Every person that was working there looked to be in good moods and they were an attractive bunch of guys and gals! The menu tells you everything you need to know about the food and prices, including any extra charges for substitutions. I ordered the mac and cheese burger and my partner ordered the glazed doughnut burger.  It was REAL mac and cheese too, not that crap from a box with the powdered cheese. When the food arrived, which was pretty quick, one bite into the hamburger and my life was changed. There's a reason why the burgers are a little on the pricy side; you're paying for quality. It was AMAZING! My partner couldn't even talk as his brain was on another planet after eating his hamburger. The tots and fries were good too.  CBCB saved our lives as we didn't get too trashed when we went back to the club as we were stuffed the rest of the day. Thanks CBCB, we will definitely be returning with others from the bar. Keep up the great work and the great food."}
{"text":"It is bar food.  Not bad if you are hungry and just want something that is close.  Staff is amazing and if you are their to watch any sports games you are good to go!  No worries they will have your game for you to watch guaranteed!

{"text":"Cold Beers & Hairy Cheeseburgers. .. I like the one in old town scottsdale but the restaurant  in north scottsdale is horrible.  Ive been to the NS location 3 times and each experience topped the last. I was here earlier today (3rd experience ) and found a pubic hair in my sliders, DISGUSTING!!!! My server went to get the manager an get this...haha wow...this is what he told me \"This is one of the mishaps of eating out\". WTF??!!! How bout I call the health inspectors. I assumed part of being a manager is making sur your kitchen is clean. Yeah you may not be able to catch everything but what your comment was unacceptable. 

Tips...new management, better and more servers so we dont have to wait 30 min for service and clean your freaking tables. Ugh! Never Again."}

{"text":"Ended up here on a whim one night with family. It was decent, but in all honesty you can get a tastier burger at Burger King. Don't laugh. On the other hand, the fries were pretty good? Oh, and charging $12 for a burger is, ummmm, whats the word for it? Oh yeah, rape. I don't think Ill be back."}

{"text":"Nice selection of beer and the environment is so fun! Sitting at the bar, watching a game, and trying several different beers was great. Nothing to write home about when it comes to food though. I'd love to have a fantastic burger joint right by my house but their burger is just fine. But again the environment is great and bartenders are quick and friendly. We had a good time."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere with plenty of TVs to watch the games. We sat outside, they had overhead heaters that did a great job. Ordered wings for the table $13 for 10 jumbo wings. Taste was good but overpriced. I had the burger stuffed with Cheddar and upgraded to sweet tots. $14. To pricy for a burger and fries. Son had grill cheese came with chips, others had Chinese salad, was ok. Overall prices way to high what you get. Beer selection is good. Great marketing is what is making this place. Worth a try once, but won't be back."}
{"text":"Yes, service is a little slow at times but food is very good, hot & smokey mac & cheese is awesome, and the patio is dog friendly. A much needed addition to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"We moved to Power Ranch about 9 months ago, and discovered that CB&C on Higley was the closest restaurant to our house. We've been a few times, but I've never taken the time to write a review. However, after last nights experience I think it's time someone finally said it- THEY DO NOT serve Cold Beer at Cold Beer & Cheeseburgers! Crazy right?

As for the food, I'm not going to complain much on the food, every burger I've had has been good. Not great, but good. Two quick points to explain what I mean; first, the price and presentation. The Bacon Blue Burger is $14.50, it comes with chips. The same type of burger at Red Robin is $14.99 and comes with all you can eat fries. If you want fries instead of chips, it's $2 more. However, a side of chips costs $5. A side of fries also costs $5. If a side of chips costs the same as a side of fries, why in the heck are fries $2 more than chips, with your burger? So to compare, this is a $16.50 burger with fries, $14.99 at Red Robin with all you can eat fries. Does the CB&C burger taste better? Nope. I'd say they are pretty even, with a slight edge going to Red Robin. In fact, here's a tip: if you put avocado on a burger (which is great) you have to slice it. They basically put a chunk, like a quarter of an avocado right on top. You take one bite, and the lump of slippery avocado slips right out and onto your plate. Very weird. Also, the bacon is undercooked. Again, still not a bad burger, but should be better if your charging more than the

UPDATE!!!! After this review, CB&C informed me that they had an issue with the glycol lines and that was causing the warmer than usual beer temp. I was skeptical, but happy to report that on a follow up visit last night, the beer was nice and cold! Hooray! I still feel like the food is overpriced, but generally tasty- so I'm bumping this up to 3 stars. It's nice to see management paying attention and addressing issues!"}
{"text":"We were a table of 9. The service was seriously
HORRIBLE, even the food runners clearly didn't care. Came, dropped off the appetizer, said \"enjoy your meal\" as they walked away. No silverware, no plates, no napkins, nothing. We asked for water about 4 times before we got it and my husband then after we waited for 15 minutes after eating went and got the check... Which had a THIRTY PERCENT GRATUITY. I was in food service for many years so I get charging gratuity but 30% for horrendous service is absolutely unacceptable. First and last time at this place for sure. Oh and obviously I'm not going to give a business 1 star just for service. The menu was pretty expensive for cheeseburgers which were solved cold and were quite lackluster. The bathroom was dirty and we had to drive around for 10 minutes just for a parking spot on the other side of the strip mall."}
{"text":"We went last night and the place was packed. The beer selection is great and it's cold however our burgers were over cooked and really not worth the money. Not sure if we would go back."}

{"text":"Here are all the reasons for a 5-star rating
- great food, amazing flavor, and lots of cheese
- waitress was great, friendly, bused dirty dishes in a timely manner, and was personable 
- great beer choices and variety 
- location is easy to get to and to get out from
- tons of TVs to watch a game or two... or three
The only detracting aspect is the prices... but, I believe that if the food brings it don't complain, so I won't. My advise is to be aware going in and enjoy the food and drinks."}
{"text":"It's a sports bar through and through - so make sure your expectations are in line. TVs and comfort food abound. That being said they still need to work on their service. Servers and bartenders are pretty young inexperienced and but that should hopefully improve. Where they really fall short is the food. Who knew the 'cold' also applied to all of their appetizers and entrees. The Arcadia location could do with some of the Old Town staff coming over to help out and set some standards."}
{"text":"This is a smaller location from the Old Town one, but it's a perfect place to grab some drinks, some hearty All American food and watch sports! Be warned that it does get crowded on the weekends. 

I'm a big fan of the food and drinks here. The name says it all in terms of the type of food they specialize in...burgers! They have a wide-variety of burgers to choose from, including sliders. You can also build your own burger. In addition, I'm a huge fan of their buffalo chicken and I encourage you to order their buffalo chicken dip or buffalo chicken egg rolls. 

For drinks, they offer great specialty cocktails as well as a wide selection of beer. If you can't decided what to get, you can also order the beer and a shot combo where they pair a shot that tastes good with the beer you order."}
{"text":"This was such a fun environment! Our server was amazing and very attentive. Games on in every direction. (Husband was Happy) No wait to be seated, and sweet little girl scouts out front selling cookies! Love this place and the energy it has. I had the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich, it was amazing!"}
{"text":"Stopped here last night to catch the NCAA basketball final.  Great sports bar atmosphere with TVs everywhere.  Waitress was excellent!  Super friendly, attentive and accommodating to our special request that was not on their menu.  Beer was cold with a huge beer selection, appetizer was good and the burger was fantastic.  Great time with a fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"Service was worst I've ever had.  I took my family to eat there upon the recommendation of a friend.  It took over 15 minutes to get our order taken, then more than 30 minutes after placing our order to get our food.  I had to flag down the manager who had passed us several times (we were seated by the kitchen) and asked if it was normal to wait so long.  But the sweet tots were AMAZING!  The sliders needed special sauce as they were a little dry.  The wings were ok, but I think I will try something else if we go back.  The music was really LOUD, but I guess you have to expect that at a bar - so don't expect to have any dinner conversation."}
{"text":"We love going to Cold Beer & Cheeseburgers. It has become a family tradition for birthday dinners. Every time we go we have a large group and they are always accommodating! 
 
The food is great!  The kids love the pretzels with cheese for a starter. There is something for everyone, even for my gluten free sister-in-law. Tonight we had two $12 beer buckets (6 beers /bartender's choice). Great deal! 

My wife got the veggie burger off of their new healthy choice menu.  It was delicious! The chicken burgers and hamburgers are always fabulous. 

Our server tonight, Andrea, went above and beyond to make sure our youngest son had a great b-day dinner.  
Fast and friendly service tonight. 

The s'mores are always a fun way to end the meal. We will be back in a month for the next bday."}
{"text":"This is my third time here and it's been good until now. Went in for lunch, 40 minutes to receive cold food. My bacon would have been more cooked if I would had walked up to a live pig and just bit a chunk out of his ass. Service was horrible, never offered a refill. Asked why the food took so long and bartender says \"I don't know\". Clearly she could care less."}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to finally try Cold Beers and Cheeseburgers on a Saturday at 3:30. Ok, why does a burger joint/bar have valet parking, really?!  This creates limited parking for the patrons. It was funny seeing two dudes waiting for their car while valet ran 15 feet to get the vehicle! Well I digress. Upon entering, we were pleasantly greeted and seated. First thing I noticed was the awesome wrap around the bar of huge TVs! A TV mecca for any sports fan! We ordered a large beer which came in a small mug (not a pint). The draft and bottled beer menu was extensive! 
I ordered the ring of fire burger, which was awesome and spicy but not worth $12. It did include fries or chips. My wife ordered the all American burger which she liked. The onion rings were awesome. The service was great as well. I would return to eat and drink, and recommend his restaurant to others!"}
{"text":"This place is fun but never that busy. Location is odd, but I like it bc it's in my neighborhood. Gaston (our server) is great, always! He remembers your choice of drink & never lets be empty. He is able to handle rude drunks in a professional manner (thanks by the way) I ways enjoy a drink (or few) here."}
{"text":"Lots of beer choices, picked a local favorite and it was cold. Service was ok as we were on the very loud patio on a weekday lunch date. No big sport event was on but they continued to keep the tv volume high. Had to ask twice to have it turned down. Surprised the others on the busy patio didn't care. We had dinner plans so we wanted a light lunch, split a cheeseburger and had sweet potato tots. The kitchen split both the burger and tots which was nice. Tots were hot. Burger was a huge disappointment. Just a fancy named mess of a burger. Nothing special. The over all experience was disappointing. And I almost forgot, the 2 beers and the one split cheeseburger with tots was almost $40 with tip. We won't be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"I Wasn't all that impressed with cold beers and cheeseburgers, our waitress only came to our table 2 times and wasn't very friendly.Everything you order comes with these awful chips, so it's extra $ if you want fries. 
Although on a positive note there adult dessert menu is really tasty And unique, so I'm sure I'll be back for that."}
{"text":"Good burgers. I don't drink beer. Why would anyone want a cold cheeseburger though? Shouldn't it be Cold Beers and Hot Cheeseburgers???"}
{"text":"I love the 1000 island burger and my husband loves the open-pit burger! Mozzarella sticks are amazinggggg"}
{"text":"If the name of your restaurant has Cheeseburgers as part of the title. One would automatically assume they would have some really good Cheeseburgers. Never assume something people because you'll be disappointed! I visited the location near my house on Indian School Road & 40th St. in the Arcadia area of Phoenix, AZ. After looking at the menu I decided to keep it simple and selected the \"All American Burger\". I'm just going to call it what it is folks. There is nothing special about this restaurants Burgers. They should really change their name to \"Cold Beers & We Serve OK Cheeseburgers\". Not sure where they source their beef from or what the meat mixture contains. My Burger was ordered medium well and came out as dry as a saltine cracker. Very little flavor and not juicy at alI! I had an order of Sweet Potato Tots which were good actually to go along as a side. That was a $2 up charge because this places serves House-made chips with the order. My biggest complaint is paying $15 for a burger that is not delicious. I could think of a few fast food spots serving better tasting burgers for half the price. If I go back it will be just to drink a beer that will hopefully be served cold."}
{"text":"Good place, with excellent beer selection and great bartenders, Danni's the best, funny and sharp witted, makes the place!"}
{"text":"I'm not into sports but this is a great place. Service is wonderful, burgers and chips are delicious and greeter remembers me!"}
{"text":"Wow amazing burgers and they sure don't skimp on the kids plates. Kids eat free every Thursday.  The fresh kettle chips are the bomb!!  Ask for a little Chipotle mayo to dip them in."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been here a few times.  The food is really good!  They also have a good set up of tvs and a large selection of beer.

However, if you drink mixed drinks be prepared to pay for an overpriced WEAK drink.  This place does the \"corporate pour\", so the drinks are really weak.

My husband and I were talking about how weak my margarita was, and a bartender blurted out \"We put a whole shot in it\".  REALLY?  a whole shot?  Wow.  Then she said she would have to charge us extra if we wanted it stronger.  Meanwhile the margarita was already overpriced for the tiny amount of tequila in it.   If you want a REAL mixed drink, go to a family owned bar where the bartenders are allowed to make their drinks the way the want to and the way they should.  You can get a better made margarita at a cheaper price elsewhere."}
{"text":"This joint looks good on paper, but on execution leaves one wanting.  Four of us came for dinner and none of us liked our food - not one - and we all got something different.  Suggestions for this new establishment:

--Let people order 2 and 4 oz beer samples (and charge for those), like half glasses of wine.
--Offer make your own flights.
--Put items on the plate that the menu says will be there
--Offer better sides
--Advertise your lettuce wrapped sandwiches better, put it right on the menu
--Educate your wait staff better
--Chuck the disgusting brown rice and black bean veggie burger, which are just punishment to vegetarians.  No vegetarian wants a starch patty served on a bun (starch on starch).
--Offer more sauces at the table.

Our server was a bit clueless.  She didn't know the difference between black and green tea.  She offered no alternative when someone in our group wanted to try some beer but didn't want a full pint, even though the restaurant offers flights.

My sandwich had almost none of the advertised sauce on it and was dry and inedible.  My sisters' veggie burger was smothered in a sweet terriyaki sauce that she said was gross (so the sandwich was sweet rice and beans terriyaki on a bun).

No one came by to offer drink refills until after our check came.  The joint has cement-like floors and is very very loud.  You have to shout to hear each other... just too many minuses to come back.

Glad you're crowded and doing well, but we won't be coming back and chance a repeat on the food or service."}
{"text":"SHAME ON YOU!

They charge a $1.50 more for what they call a big beer vs the standard 16 ounce pint!  So dishonest and deceitful!  We should all hang up and put this place out of business.  I am pretty sure they will be closed by the end of the year.  The place was less than 1/2 full on a Saturday.  All they really serve are $12+ burgers that are average at best.

 SHAME ON YOU FOR RIPPING OFF YOUR CUSTOMERS."}
{"text":"This might be my new favorite spot for comfort/pub food!  I normally get the grilled cheese sandwich even though I know how to make those at home... it's just that good here!  And we can never pass up the tater tots appetizer even though we end up with too much food to finish.  I tried the brownie sundae last time and while I think it would be better if the brownies could be heated up, it was definitely good enough to get again!  Shout-out to our waitress Hannah who kept our drinks refilled and was super nice."}
{"text":"Me and my husband went here to check it out because we had heard great things about this place. The food was over priced for what we got. We felt as if we should have just went to The Habit where we would have gotten more for cheaper. My husband got the Juicy Lucy and wanted it medium well the waitress came back to our table and told us he had no option it had to be medium because of the cheese melting and what not well his burger was burnt. I got the steakhouse and the best thing was the sweet potato tots. If your looking for a really good burger don't waste your time or money here."}
{"text":"In a town full of mediocrity, this restaurant is subpar. #poorservice

They gave our apps to another table, served flat beer, and refused to take out order thrice. I pray that this place goes out of business as so a better restaurant can replace it. Send this place back to Old Town."}
{"text":"Everything about the atmosphere is great, it should be a five star review....here's the problem....Really slow and Really bad service, seems consistent with other reviews. I will be back , I hope it gets better, It should be an easy fix for management."}
{"text":"I have now been here 3 times and each time I have had good food, cold beer with average to above average service. This place is so much better than Uncle Bears, that it replaced. I like that they have unique burgers and dogs with lots of good beer selection both in the bottle and on tap. There are lots of Televisions so it's loud but not obnoxious. I would say its kid friendly as long as you are in the dining room. As long as the food quality stays the same I'll keep coming back."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Food is great. I recommend the Mac n Cheese burger! Great location for sports, but it's always super busy! Definitely our new favorite spot to watch games and grab a drink!"}
{"text":"Well I would love to post pictures of my food but it never came. Had a great time last night but it was very frustrating as well. I went with some friends from work and all was going good. Love the ambience, big TV's everywhere and clean. They weren't too busy but the waitress never brought me my food. Everyone else got there's and I thought mine would be coming but never did. The waitress was hard to find, would bring beer and then disappear. I finally caught her by standing in the middle of the isle and asked for my bill and advised her I never got my food. Not very apologetic and finally got my bill for my 2 beers. Waited for her to come back to pay and finally just went to the front and asked if I could just pay there. VERY FRUSTRATED!! The food did look AMAZING maybe next time I will get to try it?!?!"}
{"text":"Burger was great, fries weren't too great.  

Lemonade was tasty.

The waitress seemed annoyed that I existed.

Too bad because it's only a bike ride away from my home.

I'll stick with the Mexican joint next door."}
{"text":"Cold beer fresh burgers and service was ok.  Good place to have a couple of cold ones and a good burger.  No wait on a Saturday night which was nice. Second time here so food and service are consistent. Parking sucks. Valet is available but takes up most of the parking for the whole shopping area."}
{"text":"Live in neighborhood and excited to have new restaurant as last 4 in that spot were worthless.  Really clean new sportsbar w top of the line tv's. Was expecting a superior hamburger. Well its their name. Ok. Not memorable. Ordered medium. Was done well. Bun was dry. Burger was good. Onion rings were excellent!  Really hope wings are good. Will find out and let you know!!  Overall happy to have in neighborhood!  My nephew visiting from Wisconsin thought it was good.take that for what its worth."}
{"text":"Always busy and for a good reason. The food is awesome and reasonably priced . The service is spot on and the employees seam to actually know the menu . I have heard some complaints about the price and having to pay extra for fries but honestly it will cost you about double McDonald's which considering at McDonald's there is no guarantee it's even beef it's worth it ."}
{"text":"IF you have not had their sweet potato tots, you are missing out. This bar is fantastic for socially hanging out with friends and always to watch sports! Great quality food and I have never had an issue with the service here."}
{"text":"My expectations on the food front in a place like this are pretty minimal, so it was a real shock to have a bad experience. 

First, I'll say the place looks great for sports events - screens everywhere ... big screens! I assume they'll carry every game you could hope for. 

My issue was mainly with the bun.  My burger's bun was dry / crumbly, such that when I picked up my burger, the bread broke. I can only imagine my particular bun was on the stale side, which for a place specializing in burgers seems to be a bit of a sin. But even had the bun been more moist, it seemed bland. I've had buns in many other places that just really 'pop'. 

Also, the bread and the cheese had 'fused' on the top bun, so even though I ordered the garnish on the side (lettuce/tomato), I could not add it to the burger. It arrived at the table this way, suggesting it had maybe sat in the kitchen for some time before being delivered. 

Also, since it was lunchtime, I asked for a (non-alcoholic) Ginger Ale or Ginger Beer. What I got was typical 'fountain' type drink, which was pretty undrinkable.  With so many wonderful 'craft' ginger drinks available today, it's a surprise they only had the fountain junk.  But I guess this place wants everyone to drink beer. 

With Burger joints being so commonplace, I expected more."}
{"text":"Great place, great food, great atmosphere! Vanessa the server is the best and ask to be seated in her section. She is awesome!"}
{"text":"Mac and cheeseburger was absolutely delicious!!! probably the best version of that burger I've had!  Also enjoyed the pretzels and cheese!! Good beer selection, although I was pregnant while visiting, so only my husband got to enjoy this! Definitely will be back!!"}
{"text":"What can I say, first of all rude waitstaff!  Not only that but even with the renovation, this place still feels like eating in a cafeteria with everyone right on top of one another and in your business.  Not a place to go relax and unwind with a beer and a burger (as the restaurant name refers to).  The ambiance is awful, too crowded and the wait staff is inattentive and rude.  I'm not even going to comment on the food since there are way too many other good burger restaurants in Scottsdale to go to.  The food here doesn't even matter since you can't get beyond the attitudes and the overall feel of the place.  A big YUCK from me.  If you want to experience the burger version of going to a Peter Piper Pizza, then this is your kind of place!"}
{"text":"We had called in the day before letting them know we had a group of 12 people coming in. They said they do not take reservations for Friday but took my information down anyways. The table was set up pretty quick, but the service was slow and bad. It took us an hour and 15 minutes to get our food. 

We had called the manager over, instead of apologizing for the delay, he told us that we should understand that they're packed up and have two large groups. We were told like small kids to understand and not treated like paying customers.

Given that we had provided sufficient notice that we were coming the day before, they should have been prepared.

Most of the food was cold and not cooked the way we had wanted it. Most of our food came out medium rare. They took the one burger off the check, but because we were hungry, most of the folks ended up eating just half of our food.

We are utterly disappointed and will never return."}
{"text":"I love aioli and truffle oil and they have both!  Plus juicy burgers.  Service has never been spectacular however, hence the missing star.  Pricing isn't too bad."}
{"text":"Just found this place recently and we love it! Start off with Hell Fire Chips. If you want hot buffalo wings with out the chicken, do it! So many beers to choose from so that part can be challenging and honesty they have a vast food menu for a sports bar type place. I would say the food is upscale from what you may expect. Really good burgers, veggie burger and gluten free bun option. Tater tots are better than the fries but maybe that's just me. Terrific atmosphere as well we always have had great service as we always been lucky enough to get Tiffani as our server. Becoming a go to place for us."}
{"text":"In the age of the breastaurant, Cold Beers & Cheeseburgers joins the rest of the bars with average food, high prices, and young, attractive staff wearing t-shirts and yoga pants.

This place is loud, it's busy and it's expensive. Plan to pay $2.95 for a Coke, $5.50 for a pretzel with a salsa/cheese queso, which I found disgusting. The burgers are good, the chicken tenders and fries and onion rings all are made from frozen. Nothing really fresh here so far as I can tell. Lots and lots of beers to choose from and that really seems to be what this place is about. What a shame. I was hoping for a restaurant, not a bar. It's an over-priced 'fad' restaurant and those typically don't stay in style for more than a few years.  Maybe years from now Arby's will buy them out as they did Buffalo Wild Wings and bring in fresh food and fair prices. Until then, I have little reason to ever go back for so-so food and high-high prices in loud-noisy atmosphere and a struggle to find a parking spot."}
{"text":"Steve is an amazing bartender and our drinks never go dry!!! Amazing suggestions about food! I would recommend for everyone who hasn't come in here to give it a try, you will NOT be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Wouldn't return! We were so excited to have a new, fun, and unique restaurant in the West Valley. CBCB had a great environment...fun music, people enjoying themselves, and a nice-sized bar. We ordered from the menu and were impressed by all of the options and fun food items. The burgers were average; service was terrible, and the young girls at the hostess desk were oblivious and in their own world. I had to ask for a gluten free menu twice before any of them knew there was one. My husband loved the buffalo chicken totchos, but we won't be back."}
{"text":"Service here has been going down hill every time I go here.  We went to this restaurant yesterday evening and during a game being played a small group was acting out of control screaming as loud as they could in every occurrence possible.  We finally had enough of it and asked the group to quiet down and all hell broke out.  The manager came over to our table and tried to understand how we felt and the table next to us agreed with us and felt the same way.  The manager said she was going to kick them out and she never did.  She simply went over to their table standing next to them talking to them.  About 15 minutes past and we realized the manager did not kick them out and if she tried to kick them out she has no ability to enforce it.    You'll find that when you go to this place the management attempts to understand you however they're not willing to make things right."}
{"text":"Very good burgers, great crispy fries. Server was very attentive. Definitely share a burger if you don't eat much. Room temperature was a little cool."}
{"text":"I'm giving the place 5 stars because of the food, the service, and the ambience; HOWEVER, I would give this establishment only ONE star if I was grading solely on the amount of women that hit on me while I was there - NOT ONE! I mean, I was playin' it cool, eating my chicken cordon bleu sandwich and sippin' on my margarita all while attempting appear fixated on the baseball game playing on the TV overhead; I don't actually know a thing about baseball. I occasionally fiddled with my phone to make it look like I was responding to a text, thus implying that, although I was dining alone, there were people who were trying to contact me - although there weren't. Maybe I think of myself as a \"swipe right\" guy while women look at me as a \"swipe left.\" 

Oh well. My wife would've been mad if I picked up a lady anyway. Probably for the best."}
{"text":"A great selection of craft beer, awesome burgers and tots. Major recommendation is the staple mac n cheese!"}
{"text":"This was our first time here and I am sad to say probably our last. We sat on the patio and it took several minutes for anyone to show up and brake a drink order and then it took several more minutes to get my wife's drink while a sample I asked for never showed up. I flagged down a waitress who seemed irritated that I asked her for anything and she got my sample. A few more minutes later( now we are around 20 minutes) and the original waitress comes out and says she will be taking care of and something about changing tables. She took our order and got me a beer. My wife ordered wings which were undercooked a little and not at all like bar wings should be. She was not happy. I ordered the Juicy Lucy and found the burger tasteless and had too much stale bun and lettuce. The \"chips\" that come with the burger were over cooked and tasteless also. Lastly, the TV's were way to loud and they need to be about half as loud for a dining area. The only reason I am not giving a one star is because the Manager came over and took care of putting the shade down when we asked and the waitress was nice although she could use more training.
I was really bummed about the whole experience."}
{"text":"Have no idea why this place has been given a bad rap.  This is my new favorite place!  Brittany B  and Luis are the bomb !  The food rocked and the $10 beer flight special was awesome!   
Two dinners a flight of 8 tastings 2 12 o and two black velvety for 48 bucks is a fricken steal !!!'
 Enjoy!  We will be back
I only wish they cooked with canola oil as the vegetable oil contains soy."}
{"text":"I really anticipated this place but was left a little eh. No real seasoning on the burger, the bacon had no flavor, and even the thousand island dressing was unnoticeable. The chips were OK and at least the fries were hot but the prices are a little inflated for nearly no flavor and a little cup of fries.
I give a star because of all the TV's and an extra Star because, what can you expect from a sports bar?
But then I have to remove a star because when my wife went to cut her burger in half, there was a dried up, chewed piece of gum on the handle. The waitress acted concerned but no apologies from a manager. I guess quality control is not a concern here."}
{"text":"Had a great time and we completly enjoyed the food
There lots odd people on a busy day and didn't expect a table but we barely had to wait 10 mind. Sat on patio in perfect position to see the multiple games on the television in any direction you sit.
We all did Burgers but didn't find"}
{"text":"Really good burgers cooked just the way I asked plus good beer selection.  The cheeseburger definitely delivered and the beer was surely cold, this location lived up to it's factual name.  The waitress had a great attitude and was a pleasure to talk with.  We had a great time eating in the patio enjoying the breeze and shade at sunset.  It's the first place I think of when I want a good burger."}
{"text":"I wanted so bad to like this place. How can you not like gourmet burgers and beer? First of all the service is questionable. Although my first impression wasn't great I gave it another try with the same results. On my first visit we ordered the salted pretzel, Ring of Fire burger and bacon Mac n cheese. The pretzel was good. The burger was ok but not exceptional. I was expecting a flavor explosion with the description of the toppings for the burger, however, it wasn't as flavorful as I'd hoped. The bun to meat ratio is definitely off. Way too much bun! The Mac n cheese was barely edible. It was like eating over cooked noodles in a soupy Alfredo sauce. Flavorless and bland. I also was not a fan of the sweet potato tater tots.

My next visit was about the same. It was lunch and wasn't very busy but our waitress was horrible. We did a build your own burger and they literally forgot over half of the toppings we requested. We kept having to ask for them on the side. That was frustrating since our waitress was MIA most of the time our lunch took nearly two hours! The onion rings were fantastic! We definitely enjoyed those! On a positive note we did talk to the manager who was extremely nice and apologized got our experience and removed our burger from the bill. We didn't expect that and it was a pleasant surprise. I know the restaurant just recently opened and is going to have some growing pains but in not giving up and will return again! I think the potential is there and I want to see it succeed."}
{"text":"Pimp your burger day...what can I say. Stuffed. Staff pleasant and plenty of tvs. Would definitely come back during football season."}
{"text":"Good burgers, fairly quick service. There was a wait when we got there but it went by fast. The space they have is small however and therefore it is always very crowded and that needs to be worked on. About 5 kids bumped into my chair while I was eating and didn't even say sorry! How rude! Other than that, all was good."}
{"text":"This is a great place for the best burger and a great selection of draft beers. Use the NoWait App for quick seating. Our server Rylee D was the best. Very attentive and fun. All of it made my Father's Day a hit. Thanks Cold Beers and Cheeseburgers. You rock!!"}
{"text":"Between 2.5-3 Stars.

We arrived right when they opened so were seated and served right away. Honestly, it was decent service, nice atmosphere with plenty of TVs for sports, and even tasty, fresh food, but it's the price for lunch that makes us think twice about returning. We ordered two burger meals and two soft drinks. Our bill, including tax and tip, was just over $40. Over $40 for a burger and chips lunch for two with an iced tea and a soda. No beer or alcohol. We didn't even upgrade our side dish to fries, which would have been an extra $2 per meal. Granted this area has the clientele able and willing to pay those menu prices, so they're in the right area, but I think many would have some sticker shock.

I will note that they have a kids menu so are relatively family friendly. Also, worth noting is that they offer a burger with peanut butter, so anyone with peanut allergies should be aware that it's served in the restaurant.

Bottom line: Good food and decent service, but expensive for what it is. Will probably be back, but not often."}
{"text":"Dog friendly patio! 

Dude, seriously brah, I love taking my dog Riley here to chill on the patio with a beer and a burger. The beer list is extensive with local beers and imports. The burger list is huge! So many choices, or a build your own option. They're served with your choice of tots, sweet potato tots or fries. 

I've eaten here twice and both times were great. The patio is a little on the small side, so I try to come during an off time so my dog isn't bothering anyone, she's just way too friendly and nosey. She'd be all up in some lady's tots like \"gimme one of your tots!\". 

If you arent a burger person, although why wouldn't you be?!, they have chicken sandwiches, salads and wings too. 

Check it out, and look for me and Riley on the patio!"}
{"text":"The BYO Mac n Cheese is the best of my life!! But all those extra add ons get pricey and start to add up. All in all, this place is good and a fun environment."}
{"text":"I've been to this establishment on 2 different occasions and have no complaints.  Yes, the place resembles a neighborhood sports bar, if you want fancy and white glove service go to Lush or somewhere.

The food my wife and ate (Juicy Lucy/Mac n cheese) were of very good quality and tasted good, along with the sweet potato tots!

Establishment has ample supply of big screens to allow you to watch all your sports venues from which ever wall you are facing."}
{"text":"SO MANY TVs! A great place to watch a UFC fight or game. I have tried many of the burgers and have not had a bad one yet. Ate there twice in 1 week. Hummus plate isn't bad either. Lots of unique beers. A great place to meet up with friends."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I come her almost every Thursday night for Trivia! Even when it's really busy, we have amazing service and we come so often, the waitress knows my boyfriend's order- I like variety and do a different burger every week. My favorites are the Juicy Lucy-fur, Rocky Point and the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich. It's an extra $2 to substitute chips with French fries, so I wish the French fries portion was a little larger, but the food always tastes amazing! Never had issues with my burgers being over or under cooked! Definitely recommend going on a Thursday night at 8:30 for trivia- it makes a great date night and you can win a gift card if you win!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars. 

Came in on weekend lunch, they didn't seem that crowded but it seems under staffed the day I came in.

I ordered Jucy Lucy for my lunch. I had one at the originally invented location in Minneapolis several years ago and I though here tasted better. Perhaps difference in meat quality? Very large meat, about a half was all I could finish.

My friend ordered veggie burger. Patti was so consistent couldn't tell it was a veggie burger. I also got to taste it and surprisingly it was so juicy, one of better veggie burger I had.

I would rate 2 stars for service. I told the server as soon as I sat down that we were short on time. I don't think she did anything to help us expedite. When we asked for a check, she didn't have it ready and we had to wait. Whenever we needed something, she was nowhere to be found.

Nice ambiance with lots of TV. This place is designed for those who want to enjoy cold beer while watching TV. Not for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"People swear by this spot... and its okay.  Burgers are decent.  Beer is cold.  Otherwise I can't say I am blown away, but the tot-chos are a pretty cool appetizer!  The staff is nice and there is a great outdoor area that is loaded with televisions and direct bar access.  I just can't get too blown away by a so so burger and decent beer."}
{"text":"We eat here every few weeks it seems. They make a good burger and actually have a very good house made vegetarian burger. The service is quick and be happy hour food prices are very good."}
{"text":"Great good awesome service can't wait to go back. Try the steakhouse lots of layers of flavors burger cooked perfectly."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, good beer and excellent service. 

My husband and I decided to try this place out tonight for the first time.  It is pretty close to home and the menu online looked interesting. We went around 6pm on a Friday night.  The place was packed but we only waited for about 15 minutes.  It is a small space but has a nice friendly vibe.  We had decided on our order while we waited so we were ready when we got to the table.  Our server, Taryn was very friendly but most importantly she was quick and efficient.  (We were there with our 2 month old and 3 year old).

My husband had the CB+CB Burger with fries, I had the sliders and onion rings and we both had a beer.  Our daughter shared with us. Overall everything was fresh and delicious. The onion rings were crisp, the burgers juicy and I was very excited they had one of my favorite beers on tap. Before tip our bill was only $29! 

We will for sure be back."}
{"text":"Went for lunch burger was good, can't wait to go back when it's colder!! Great job with the redo from the Pelican!!"}
{"text":"I am a recent patron of your Chandler establishment. I had driven by the restaurant several times but always at inopportune moments. A few weeks ago that all changed when I found myself with a few extra hours on my hands. As I walked through the doors I was immediately greeted with a warm and inviting smile from who I later learned to be Vanessa. She just so happened to be walking by the front door bringing drinks to another guest and cheerfully said \"someone will be with you in just a moment\". The stars must have truly been aligned that night because as I was seated I was promptly greeted again by.. You guessed it; Vanessa. I have to say that I am one of those foodies that goes to a restaurant with a specific dish in mind to satisfy the current craving. Looking over the menu I was somewhat overwhelmed so enlisted the help of my waitress. She immediately rattled off something about peanut butter and jelly when I said \"say no more, I'll take it\". The burger was better than imagined and and if I'm being honest, has invaded my dreams on more than one occasion. I'll be back; but only if Vanessa is working."}
{"text":"Delicious! We love their burgers! We tried the tot-chos this time around and they were amazing!"}
{"text":"Came to the Glendale location and the hype was not what it was worth. Not only was the service bad (it wasn't even that busy) but the girls at the front were too busy talking to guys to come and take our order. The food was very mediocre; the burgers and buns dry. I had much higher expectations... I'm sure if you came for drinks and to watch a game it would be much better but for the food itself I will have to say 2 stars."}
{"text":"My husband and I had been to the location in Scottsdale, and were so excited when we saw they were opening one in our neighborhood! The food is great, you can't go wrong. We love the burgers, aps, salads, the mac & cheese is amazing, and we recently tried the hot dogs which were excellent as well. They have a great selection of beer, wine and cocktails. I especially like their Moscow Mule. They have the food/drink/ambiance thing down (love me an open air restaurant), however, being a new location there are noticeably issues with the service. We have been a few times already, and each time the servers themselves are pleasant, however, the service is very slow. Really in every sense, and the kitchen is extra slow.  Also, having been in the business for many years, it irks me when servers do not pick dirty plates before they bring the check, and that has happened each time we have been there. Its not hard--everything off the table that's not being used, offer dessert and/ more drinks, then check. Not here is you check but let me know if you need anything else, and have fun sitting with dirty plates. Hopefully they can get the kinks worked out soon because this is not an issue in Scottsdale, so you know they know how to do it right. I have faith!"}
{"text":"This place was great!  We went here the other day for dinner and had a really good experience.  The place itself is smaller than I thought it would be but has a very nice outside area, there is plenty of bar access and the inside has many a TV to watch the game on.  

A lot of other people seem to dock them for service but we were served perfectly.  They seemed to be around whenever we needed them while not hawking over our shoulders the whole time.  Everything was spot on as ordered and nothing was forgotten.  

The beer list is grand as it should be if you have cold beers in the name.  I tried the Maui brewed coconut porter, it was fantastic.  

The food was good as well.  I only gave 4 stars instead of 5 since it wasn't the freshest ingredients but it's fried and greasy so it doesn't really need to be.  It all tasted very well.  We had the buffalo tot chos and a couple burgers.  Everything was hot and as advertised."}
{"text":"Went here last night for a quick meal. I got the cheeseburger sliders and some French fries. I must say one of the best burgers I've had. Well seasoned! The fries were delicious. It was really good. And the service was excellent too. I'll be back!!!!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant just opened and the place is always crowded. Young pretty girls as servers, a huge tap beer selection and the menu has a wide variety of menu items to satisfy everyone's taste buds.
The outdoor seating is great and many large screen TV's to watch your favorite sporting event."}
{"text":"I really like the casual, loud, and fun atmosphere here. Bartenders are great. The bar is HUGE. On both visits, tried different sandwiches (and Mac & Cheese).
Food and service have been on point both times. A new favorite for casual meal. 

Bar drinks are excellent!"}
{"text":"Got the open pit and I loved it. The service was on point and the burger was legit. They had the patio open and it was nice. The TVs has all the games so I was happy!"}
{"text":"Came here for a business lunch with my boss a few weeks back and wasn't looking forward to seeing that I don't eat cheeseburgers and we couldn't drink. I was wrong though. Their menu is huge - I got a turkey burger and it was delicious. I loved it. Their drink selection is huge and had everything imaginable on it. The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because it is a bit small, love outside seating but this place doesn't offer a ton of it."}
{"text":"Sometimes you just gotta have a burger.  I was in the Scottsdale Rd/Grayhawk area and noticed this place where Nick's used to be.  I tasted their burger at the Scottsdale Culinary Festival's Burger Battle and thought it was really good.

The CB&CB burger with tater tots really hit the spot for lunch.  The burger and carmelized onions worked together really well.  The tater tots were delicious.

Overall it was a satisfying meal and I'll be back soon."}
{"text":"Pretty similar to all their other locations.  Large selection of burgers and beer on tap.  I went with their Open Pit 1/2 pound burger.  It comes with cheddar and pepper jack cheese, bacon and an onion ring.  It would be nice if fries were included but those are extra although they do give you chips.

Tons of TVs and a large patio area teaming with kids.

Ask them for their chipotle ketchup which they keep behind the bar."}
{"text":"Originally went to this location by trying to go to BLD for brunch. The wait was far too long for my grumbling stomach. Beers and a burger sounded like a great alternative way to start a Sunday. 

Our server, Vanessa, was lovely and helpful wuth recommendations. I ended up ordering the Bacon PB&J burger with a Goose Island 312 from a solid list of craft beers. PB&J burger, although extremely messy, was delicious and perfectly balanced."}
{"text":"Came here when they first opened and although the food was good, the service was seriously lacking. Figured it was just growing pains and gave it another shot some time later but got more of the same slow and spotty service. It seemed like the wait staff was more interested in chatting with their friends than tending to potentially loyal customers."}
{"text":"We usually eat at the Scottsdale location and recently moved back to the south Chandler area. So excited to see one of our favorite burger joints so close by! The juicy Lucy burger slams - so good! The hell fire fries are amazing (I skip the blue cheese and go for ranch). This one seems a little busier but that's because it's great food! Worth the wait if you go during lunch or dinner rush. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Great TV'S and service. Definitely the best sports bar in north Scottsdale. Thumbs up to Charles the GM and Bar Crew.  Kimberly, Nina, Gary, Christopher

MMAC Mondays!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I recently relocated to Chandler,AZ and our first experience was at the Scottsdale location. Our experience there was good and we enjoyed sitting on the patio.  I decided that I wanted to keep it low key for my birthday dinner this year with us being new to area and not really knowing anyone so we decided to give the Chandler location a shot. I LOVE smores and they have that on their dessert menu so it seemed like a good fit. Well... it wasn't. The entire staff ,except for the manager and the sweet food runner,  looked like they hated their jobs. RBF everywhere.. We were seated inside bc there wasn't any seating outside which wasn't a problem. Once sat, our server didn't come to get our drink orders for at least nine minutes. We just sat there ignored. When are server did come up she asked what we wanted to drink abruptly and walked off... I tried to give her the benefit of the doubt that maybe she was rushing and overwhelmed.. no.. her entire interaction with us was rude and abrupt.. I tried to ask her a question.. she said what's up? When we did get our food, my sandwich was on white instead of whole wheat.. when we could finally flag her down to let her know the sandwich sat on the table for another five minutes before they came to get it to switch it out. My husband ordered small beers, they continued to bring him large beers.  All in all it was a bad experience. The food was okay but the service made it much worse. By the end of it I didn't even get my smores bc I was so sick of the bad service that I just wanted to leave."}
{"text":"I have to say that my experience was less than satisfying purely due to the service.  For the prices they charge, I was shocked they don't offer table service.  It felt more like a Golden Corral, order 1st then sit down.  Then I had too wait far longer than necessary for my beer.  There was more than enough staff to handle the service but their system just wasn't efficient.

The food was decent but not justifiable for the price."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place and the staff is amazing! I went there on a Friday night for happy hour and our server Vanessa was fantastic!!!! The Mac N Cheese burger was the best thing I ever had and who doesn't love ice cold beer. I would recommend going to this place if you happen to be in Chandler and ask for Vanessa, I know I will!"}
{"text":"Have not stopped thinking of my cheeseburger since I left a few nights ago.  Being a huge Pittsburgh fan I had to order the Pittsburger with sweet tots.  Cole Slaw and fries on the burger might not sound good but it is amazing.  The tots were amazing also, great beer selection on top and in the bottle.  All 4 of us loved our dinner and have talked about how fast we can go back.  We ordered the Tot-Chos, messy but tasted great, the full order was the perfect size for the 4 of us to share.  The rest of my party got the Mac-m-cheesburger, juicy lucy and Hangover burger.  Great service, kid friendly and tons of tvs to watch sports.  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Had a really fun time. Good service, nice atmosphere, great drink selection & tasty burgers. We will be back soon. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Dani, was very helpful, good service and great food . 5 stars given Wed build your own burger only $11. This was my first time here and I plan on coming back."}
{"text":"Awesome burgers and atmosphere.  Make sure if you order the juicy Lucy or Lucifer to get it med rare or there will be no cheese in the middle."}
{"text":"I want to say that i am very critical of most places. I gave this place a chance first impression not so great but they had lost staff. Hunter the manager goes above and beyond. Stephanie is a very awesome bar tender she is the one with the rose on her shoulder. This place is best when busy. Burgers are excellent and beer is ice cold. No matter what you want you will be satisfied and your dollar will be well spent. I dont give 5 stars lightly so go it will be a great experience."}
{"text":"Great service. Great seating. Great menu. A great place to watch all different sporting events on TV. Indoor and Outdoor seating available which is a nice option. Thank you for a great lunch."}
{"text":"Great bar I'll say that again a great bar but not a great restaurant. My wife ordered the sliders with a side of onion rings and I ordered a build your own hamburger with fries. I got shredded lettuce for my hamburger and I wished I had a leaf lettuce. I ordered everything on the side with my hamburger including the meat patty off to the side so that I could degrease it with a napkin. I wished I would have had white onions instead they only have red onions. I got Thousand Island on the side but not quite enough.
The sliders three of them were thinly sliced what we thought was supposed to be prime rib but it was very much overdone not very tasty, salty and  regretful.
The fries were great they were crunchy very tasty.  The onion rings were salty ok not great. The service was fantastic the waitress was wonderful the beer was cold and tasty we got everything on time. Thank them for their service. I just probably wouldn't eat there again."}
{"text":"Stopped in for HH... Sucks. Won't be back. I feel bad being so harsh but everything from start to finish just bad bad bad. Server was stretched way too thin... Super nice girl but took forever to get drinks and bill.

I expected an awesome cheeseburger but it was just average. 

They couldn't even figure out how to calculate the check in discount correctly. Nuff said."}
{"text":"Finally The Office has been replaced with a decent burger/beer joint! And with plenty of room and lots on tap and completely remodeled, it's our new favorite go to neighhood casual hangout!"}
{"text":"This place is just mediocre. I'm honestly surprised they are popping up all over the valley. I would rather go to Zipps. Myself and my father ordered the hangover burger which is supposed to have bacon and an egg plus the other boring toppings. My dad finished his entire burger before realizing he did not have the bacon and I on the other hand still had half left. Our server never stopped by to ask how our food was and instead a busser noticed I hadn't touched my burger and asked if I wanted a box. The server finally comes by and we let her know that we both didn't have bacon. Her response was strange. She really didn't say anything and just said I'll be back or something like that. She also mentioned how they just opened and maybe the kitchen doesn't know. I've been in the service industry for 10 years, and that's not how you respond, especially to something that is so easily fixed. We didn't want anything taken off of our bill or were we looking for free stuff. Going to the kitchen and grabbing me some bacon to put on the other half of my burger that I was taking home would have sufficed. This also wasn't the first toppings were missing. Maybe if I'm coming to watch sports and grab a drink this could be my place but I came for a good burger and that's not what I got."}
{"text":"Warm beer and cold-burnt cheeseburger in my first experience.  Good for watching sports, service was as great! But, the food was not good. Ordered a burger and one side was burnt (see picture) and the food was cold. The beer was warm, be nice to have a frozen mug when electing a mug. We were bummed since one of these restaurants is opening by our house. No chance we will go to that. Back to twin peaks."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time yesterday after driving by numerous times. I really liked the atmosphere. It's a great place to catch a game while drinking a cold beer. The food was okay. We had the buffalo chicken dip which was IMO way too spicy to enjoy. For dinner I tried the Mac and cheese burger which I asked to be cooked medium, and a side of onion rings. The burger came out too dry for my liking and quite honestly the taste was bland. I've had better Mac and cheese burgers at the Cheesecake Factory. My BF had the Steakhouse burger which he said was decent but really rich. He got a side of the sweet potato tots which were tasty. The best part was ordering the table side smores. They bring out a plate of graham crackers, chocolate and marshmallows and you are able to roast the marshmallows right at your table... Pretty neat! We'd probably go back again for beers and a game but the food was meh."}
{"text":"Solid place very friendly service smart local beer list. I would say the food is decent and priced for what you get. I would go back but probably just for drinks."}
{"text":"We love this place. The burgers are so good. We like to go with friends for the UFC fight. It's a great place to hang out with friends and family. They have a great outdoor seating area to"}
{"text":"Manager sent an apology and a gift card for our next visit. I appreciate good customer service."}
{"text":"Waited 8 months to try this place out again after our initial visit. Sadly, I can tell you they're still awful! Took 15 minutes for our drink order to be taken, then another 15 to get it out to us. It was kinda busy and we weren't in a hurry so we apprehensively looked past that. Ordered a couple apps and a hot dog. Y'all, the pic below is what $12.50 will buy you, a nuthin'-special-dog and salad. 
Nope Nope Nopitty Nope."}
{"text":"If you want a beer and cheeseburger sports bar this is your spot. Great food, impressive beer selection, tons of tv's and friendly service."}
{"text":"I'm not a vegetarian, but I try to limit red meat as much as possible. The veggie burger here is to die for! Half the burger and a few tots is a full meal, and then you still have the other half and plenty of tots left over for the next day! So yummy!!!"}
{"text":"Was excited to try out this place. First impression not good. My husband had to clean off his bench as it was full of food. 

Our waitress was on her \"first\" day. Although there were many associates around, especially the girls at the hostess table, don't ask them for help. They acted as it was an inconvenience to try to find out waitress as she took all orders but one. 

After ordering we did not see out waitress for a long time. We had to ask for our check and that again took time. 

To spend over $100 on beer and burgers. Not a fan and won't be rushing back."}
{"text":"Terrible service and food too. Sent food back and didn't come back to table until we were done with the kids dinners. We packed it up to go. Over priced for what it was."}
{"text":"This spot has great hamburgers and and beer as the name suggests. The cbcb burger is my favorite. I've ordered from here 4 times and all have been exactly what I wanted. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"My family loves this sportsbar and restaurant. They have fabulous menu and everything we've eaten has been excellent everytime. The waitstaff ( cutie girls with tight leggings) were very nice and efficient with great attitudes. There were about 4 different sporting events on numerous TVs and tons of different beers. Worth the drive and the money! They also have nightly specials that are fun."}
{"text":"I used to go to the cold beer and cheeseburgers up in old town Scottsdale quite a bit. I can say that the Scottsdale location I have never had anything but 5 stars from there. So when the one at 7th street opened up I got excited because it was closer to my house. Not only does it have valet only but the service was so bad that it will make me never go there again. It took forever for us to get in our appetizer order but the waitress didn't seem knowledgeable about the menu. When we got our food they didn't substitute my side (which is a $2 up charge for fries), they over cooked my burger and we didn't even make a manager touch the table. Then we didn't see our server for about a half hour to the point that the water the my wife drank was empty and the water I had that she took because she was thirsty was empty. We had placed both of them at the edge of the table to make sure that the server could see this but she didn't fill them when she finally dropped the check off. Then to put icing on the cake after an hour of waiting so I could pay we finally brought the check to the bartender. Come to find out that she couldn't run it and went searching for the manager. Finally about 20ish minutes later the server came back looking for the check to run the card. Again the manager didn't not come to check on this/us or comp the meal that they messed up completely. I should also state that the restaurant was maybe 30% full while this was all going on so an excuse of them being extremely busy can't even be considered. I will never go back to this place and probably won't go to the one in Scottsdale either because of this."}
{"text":"First, the menu sounds great. But the prices, OUCH! I ordered a turkey burger with a side salad cuz I'm on a diet but still want to enjoy my time out. The burger  was really good. So was the salad, but little did I know that they charged $2 extra for the side salad instead of fries or tots. Not cool! I also ordered the grilled wings (hey they're grilled) they are good but at $1 each? Come on! So my bill with a $4 beer was $31 and change! Never again. 
I was there with a group of 12. I ordered early and received my food promptly. But others in my party took over 30 min and half were either wrong or burnt buns. Not OK. Again, never again."}
{"text":"We went to this place last week just to eat, but we found out that every Thursday they have trivia after football is over.  We decided to stay and partake in the trivia, and we had a blast.  We came back this week for a second time this week.  This is our new Thursday night hangout. Not only is the food great, but the atmosphere is awesome. The trivia is both fun and challenging, and my fiancee and I love the game. The Juicy Lucyfer burger is amazing, and so is the Ring of Fire burger if you like hot. They have many different beers on tap and many local brews.  If you like sports, good atmosphere, and a great time then visit a location near you. I write this review for the Glendale location, but there are many throughout the valley! So go enjoy yourself some Cold Beers and Cheeseburgers!"}
{"text":"Not likely to go back - only good thing about the parking is that there is not enough of it to create a wait at any of the restaurants in the complex - so annoying that we had to drive around til a spot even opened up.
Cheeseburgers were lukewarm and chips were tasteless and worst iced tea I've had in a very long time."}
{"text":"We had sweet tots, Awesome!!! The buffalo chicken dip and chips,  bacon and bleu burger,   Pitts burger and drinks. Great prices and Samantha and staff was great!!! Gilbert location"}
{"text":"Best burgers in town, definitely worth the wait (they're super busy around dinnertime)!"}
{"text":"I had higher expectations of this place. Service was absolutely terrible. We waited for at least 15 minutes before being acknowledged to order a drink. We ordered mmmmac&cheese burgers...disgusting...they were cold, mac&cheese was bland with zero creaminess, the bun was cold and hard, fries were cold. Had to yell to get silverware. Wont come back."}
{"text":"Do not waste your money if you like your burger anything other than well done. Menu says med rare warm red center, med pink center. Two visits four burgers later all well done. Manager notifies ed each time and nothing. It also took 15 minutes to get a beer, which was sitting at the bar and someone else brought it to us. All while watching managers and staff chatting amongst themselves and watching videos on their phones. For a corporate chain this place needs to revisit quality and time standards."}
{"text":"First time eating here. Frys are fresh out of the freezer.  Cheese sticks are fresh out the freezer.  Onion rings are fresh out of the freezer.  Burgers appear to be made fresh. The burgers are average at best. Nothing special here,  it appears a lot of the sides are not fresh and just frozen food. The service is ok. ZIPPS put this place to shame!!!"}
{"text":"We go here for lunch from work quite a bit.
The food is slow to come out when they're busy, but it's always good.
The drumstick wings are great and so are their burgers. The burger order tickets are annoying though....lose them please!!!!
Almost a 5 star ;)"}
{"text":"Tried this place three times now. First time was soon after they opened. Wife and I ate on the patio near the bar. Food was decent but a little overpriced. Second try was a few weeks ago. We were sat immediately. Waited about twenty minutes and no one ever came to take our order. We were right by the door to the kitchen so every server walked right by us and not one ever asked if we needed help. Got up and told the hostess and her response was \"oh\" so we gave up and left. Tried takeout today and they got 2/3rds of the order wrong. One would think that for a $17 burger and fries that the service would be on point but that's clearly not the case. Service is just as bad as the restaurant they replaced!"}
{"text":"Meh, it's ok.  Some of the food was really impressive, some disappointing.  But the price is ridiculous.

The great...  We started with truffle-parmesan fries and buffalo potato chips.  Both were really really good.  The buffalo chips come with blue cheese sprinkled, but only an extremely tiny amount.  I'd say maybe a heaping tablespoon at most.  They were great, and would be even better with more cheese.  The truffle fries were excellent, just perfect.  Great blend of flavors and nicely crisp on out outside.

I had the Ring of Fire burger ($12.50) which was excellent, and cooked just as ordered, medium rare.  I do appreciate a place that doesn't overcook the burgers.  They did, however, overcook the house chips that it comes with.  They were fully brown, not tan, and had a slight burnt taste.  Edible, not great.

The beer was indeed cold, with a very good and wide selection of taps, bottles, and cans.  And also on the expensive side.

The not so good...  It is LOUD LOUD LOUD in here.  Annoyingly so.  Not just because of the people talking, but loud junk playing too, which they could turn down.  And the prices are just ridiculous.  We spent $98 before tip for a burger, two sandwiches, two appetizers, and two beers.  Everything on the menu is a few dollars more than anywhere else with similar items.  I was shocked at the total bill.  And the server forgot our 10% Yelp coupon so that wasn't deducted either, but I didn't notice until after we had left.  The others in my party had sandwiches that were just OK at best, according to them.  I didn't try them.

We can't imagine we'd go back.  If it were priced right, it would be worth an occasional visit, but the value is really poor here."}
{"text":"First time at this one... second time to the franchise.  Solid burgers.  Good beer.  
We both went with a juicy Lucy-fer.   
The waitress was happy and helpful.  Kept us taken are of. 
This is a crappy review but it was a good experience."}
{"text":"While they have an extensive food and drink menu, I wasn't blown away by anything in particular. For starters, we had the buffalo chicken dip and the pretzels which were good but felt like I could get the same thing at any chain restaurant. The highlight of the appetizers was definitely the crispy, perfectly salted homemade chips (which are DELICIOUS) - but I could've done without the dip and pretzels. In terms of main dishes, I got the Hangover Burger which was just fine. The patty wasn't crazy flavorful and I thought the eggs and onions were surprisingly muted based on similar burgers I've had in the last. I got the Tater Tots as my side for the burger and again, they were just fine. I wish they were a bit more crispy and seasoned, which would have elevated them a bit. I likely won't be back if I'm in the area, unless I'm really craving one of their admittedly great drink specials."}
{"text":"Love it! Great atmosphere and even better food. Fun and inviting place!

Always a good crowd and the servers are on top of everything. I would definitely recommend for a good time."}
{"text":"First time here. Been hearing alot about this place. They're your typical burger joint with a sports bar flare. 

Lots of TVs inside, they do small events too, like corn hole tournements and raffles and stuff. That was kind of cool. 

I'm a burger and fry guy. All my people know that! This place just didn't do it for me like I thought it would. 

The burgers are about $11-12 and DON'T COME WITH FRIES!!! Come on!?? They come with home made potato chips. Which were not great. It's $2 extra for the smallest thing of fries. 

I got the Open Pit burger. It's your typical bbq bacon burger with onion ring. It was decent. The burger patty was generous. It didn't have too much flavor in the meat though. It wasn't a bad burger by any means, just no where near $12, no where. 

The fries were pretty good. No complaint except for the portion and cost. 

Overall I'd say it's just average. If I wanted to over pay for a burger I'd go to Zin Burger."}
{"text":"Decent food.  Server needed to pay more attention to her customers.  Didn't get my drink (iced tea) for 20 minutes but my friends received their drinks (beer)."}
{"text":"Four of us came here on Monday night.  Nothing special going on sports wise on the TVs.  Restaurant was less than half full.  Ordered beers, selection is decent, although, four peaks draws were on special and they only had three to choose from.  Ordered the o-line, bleu burger, pbj burger and build your own mac and cheese.  All were well executed and tasty.  Service was prompt, food came out in reasonable time.  Really, I would have given the place five stars, except for their failure to honor the 10% check-in discount.  Jax was the server and her lack of interest in pursuing getting us the discount is an unforgivable act.  Unfortunately I had already paid the bill before this was brought to my attention.  Too many other places to be screwed over here and return."}
{"text":"Today I got introduced to my newest love...Tot-chos! Tots, sour cream, guac and warm chili. These aren't Napolean's tots. I like to think these are a little piece of heaven in case I don't make it there."}
{"text":"Great food, fun atmosphere but very disappointed that their most popular appetizer has been taken off the menu...spinach dip with warm pita triangles. It was the best spinach dip I have eaten, would have loved it with tortilla chips as well : ("}
{"text":"I call it fly burger. There were tons of flies u had to put a napkin on ur plate and shoo flies while eating. Took one bite of greasy burger and asked for the Manager   He knew there was a problem.  Shut the windows and turn the fans on high and get blowers to keep the flies out. Not good today!"}
{"text":"My brother and I had lunch yesterday at Cold Beer and Cheese Burgers. The food was very good, the beer was very cold and the service was excellent. Kristi is a great server and I will ask for her from now on when I go there."}
{"text":"This was my first time eating at CB&CB. Food was amazing, great environment, excellent service, our waitress Bri was very pleasant! Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Had a great time here on Memorial Day!  I had just opened the bar I work at in the morning and was excited to spend a rare evening off with the hubby and was not disappointed !  I haven't been to a cold beer location in many moons and decided to give it a whirl.  My cocktails were great... I particularly enjoyed the CBCB spritz? (which is what I think it is called- a twist on an aperol spritz) that was effen cucumber vodka, aperol, bubbles, and club soda which was awesome!  I had the veggie burger no bun with both chips and slaw.  The slaw was traditional but maybe had some dill in it to make the slaw flavor memorable.   I loved the veggie burger!  We also had Mac and cheese to which I just ate the veggies out of but my husband got so full he didn't even order a main!  Service was good.  Props to the bartenders who made it happen with almost all of the bar-top full!  Thanks!"}
{"text":"We went in for lunch. The staff was super friendly! Granted they were unaware of the weekend Bloody Mary bar they advertise on the tables, but I couldn't make my own Bloody Mary to save my life. The $1 refills on mimosas was nice as well, although for $10 a piece I should have had a few more. There were 3 of us (one child) and the bill was $80 so it was a bit steep for a quick lunch.

I do love when the veggie burgers are made in house. This one definitely was. Black beans, rice, oats a few other things and honey. The honey was more prominent than I was expecting but it was still a decent veggie burger. I noticed it came out with cheese, so not vegan with the cheese and honey. The kid enjoyed his hotdog and the man enjoyed his prime dip. Although, he did order the tots for the $2 extra and ended up with fries. I enjoyed the chips with mine.

I would be willing to go back again, so long as I knew I wasn't going to be ordering drinks or that I would order enough to get my money's worth."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the environment of this place both indoor and outdoor. We went on a Friday nigh and it was very busy. 

Hamburger - I got the \"bleu\" burger and enjoyed the taste of it. The reason I gave this place 2 stars is because I asked for my burger to be cooked rare and came out well-done. When I informed the staff, they didn't do anything to rectify the situation."}
{"text":"Pretty decent burger place. Staff was friendly and service was quick. I tried the onion dip and pit burger. Dip was good on flavor, but the rough chop of green onions were not my favorite. Burger was pretty good. I asked for medium rare and received a true medium rare. It needed some heat (spice wise) but the tables come stocked with Tabasco.  The Tabasco added to the burger took it up a notch. Not a drinker, so I couldn't comment on the beer part. Food was very good though."}
{"text":"We went last night, the second night of opening. Business was booming which could be good or bad as far as food goes, but I was hoping for good food, and that despite the busyness they would have great food. Let me say that the place looks great inside and out, a bit cleaner look than when it was Uncle Bears. The reason for my one star is simple. I specifically asked for \"extra extra extra well done\" on my burger. It came out very pink, maybe a medium cooked burger. This was not her fault. I sent it back, and she apologized. All was well. My family continued to eat while I waited for mine to be cooked longer. After some time a manager appears. I didn't get his name, but he was a light haired, short man who came to say he heard my burger was not cooked to my liking. I said y"}
{"text":"Holy tater tots! We all ordered sides of sweet potato tots, but they accidentally brought us regular tots out. They let us keep both and  saw just how amazing both tots tasted. Surprisingly I liked their regular tots more than the sweet potato ones!

I had the C&C burger which is fancier take on your basic cheeseburger. They even had a gluten free bun for gluten free me. The entire thing was tasty and certainly was a good cure after a late night of drinking.

There's TVs all around it makes it a great place to watch sporting events! I'd certainly come back here during a future visit."}
{"text":"Recently opened in Glendale and is always busy. Has a pretty good variety of food. Even though this is considered a sports bar, it is good for family. Good variety of beers for those that are interested in that. The tachos are very good."}
{"text":"Been to other Cold B & C , but this one just open about a month ago ,love the way place is designed and they have more TV then Best Buy. Service was awesome , waitress was friendly made  you feel welcomed , always checked on us if we needed anything , she always kept our water filled and made sure she asked if we wanted more cocktails or beer , ( waitress name was Sophie like to see people get credit for there hard work 
 Food was awesome I had Marconi and cheese and husband had stark slider. Wow. Awesome.       Will be going back."}
{"text":"Very disappointed tonight. I placed a to-go order for my family, and other than the chicken tenders for the kids, the rest of the food was nearly inedible. My wife's burger was raw in the middle, not even rare, raw. We ordered Medium well, and the middle was still cold. My burger was rare at best and i also ordered medium well. Also, I had added bacon to my burger, however, it was missing. My mother ordered the prime dip, and though the flavor was good, the meat was tough and chewy. Overall, not worth the $70.05 tab. It's a shame, we are fans of the oldtown Scottsdale location but this one is just down the street from our house. I did call to inform them of the mistake, and Casey, the manager was very friendly and apologetic. He offered a $25 gift card, but when the whole order was wrong, i don't think that's enough."}
{"text":"I had heard of this place and was excited to try it...on trivia night no less.  They had an endless list of beers to try, I settled on a Stella.  For dinner I had one of their hotdogs and a caesar salad as a side.  The food was decent.  The trivia was really fun!  Nice atmosphere, great place to hang out with friends!"}
{"text":"I have been going to this place because it's close to my home and they are pet friendly. That's the only reason. Every time I go there I have to wait at least 10-15 minutes before someone even acknowledges me, or I have to go inside (I always sit outside on the patio) and ask someone if I can get a server. Even after that, it's usually a few minutes before a server comes out to take my drink order and bring me a menu. This place has such a high turn over of servers, I don't think I have ever seen the same server there more than twice. The food isn't bad, but it's not that great, and it's not that cheap. The drinks are good though I will say that. Although the servers are nice when you do get one, it just takes forever to get anything. I always have to hunt down the server to get the bill, then it's another 10 minutes to get it, and then another 10-15 minutes to get the change or get the credit card slip. On my last visit, the other day, the table we were sitting at wasn't wiped down and there was spilled drinks dried on the table. I had forgotten to ask our server to wipe it down when she brought our drinks, and when the food came out, she walked away so I stopped another server walking by and said \"excuse me\" and the girl stopped and said \"what's up\"? I'm older than these girls, but I'm not old fashioned by any means, but I don't think I have ever had a waitress/waiter say to me \"what's up\"!? I was kinda shocked and I said \"what's up\"? kinda laughing like in disbelief of what I heard. I asked her if she could get our server to wipe down our table. That girl came back and wiped it right away, which was good, but I was left thinking, we are not at the \"club\" and I am not her \"girl\", and it was just weird to me that a waitress/server would talk like that to a customer. I think management needs to train the servers better, or maybe management needs better training? I don't know but I just wish there was a place in this area, besides The Blue Adobe (which I do like a lot) in this area that had good food and good staff."}
{"text":"This is a great local spot for great food, drinks, and good service! Elaine was a great server. Very friendly and helpful!! If you want to watch a game and drink a cold beer this is the place to be!"}
{"text":"Alecia's response should be further warning to those of you considering spending less than a couple of hours here for a burger and a drink when 57.17% of the tables are occupied. 

Instead of owning it or offering to try to make it right, she made more excuses. I can only wonder where her managers got the idea that it's ok to lie to patrons and ignore their concerns."}
{"text":"First full day opened for business and it runs so well here you'd think they've been around for years!!! 
Not one hiccup to be had, and besides the waitress asking us if everything was good about 3 other mgr looking gentlemen stopped to chat with us ask us if everything was good to go! Very pleased with service!
Now on to the food, the burger was juicy and couldn't have been cooked any better! The onion rings were the same golden brown and crispy. 
We have never tried teriyaki wings before but I will be back specifically for these wings! They didn't even need a dipping sauce, they were so good! Happy hour wine for $5 and COLD beer for $3..... can't beat that!!! 
DESSERT- we tried the s'mores, cool way to end our impromptu getaway from the kiddos!
It's beer:30 you're right on time!
P.S. Shout to Tracy Frazier Director of operations who went above and beyond to make sure we were having a great date night!"}
{"text":"Big flavorless burgers. Best thing here is the grilled chicken drumettes. Period. End of story."}
{"text":"This is a great place to get some beers and a good burger.  Our sever Kayla Dye was amazing.  She had tons of great energy, very prompt and very friendly.  We all just loved her!  My friends and I will defiantly be back for more.  Thanks Kayla for making it a great experience!!"}
{"text":"Favorite go-to spot to watch any big game! Watched the Super Bowl here and a few other games since then. Their outdoor patio is awesome, with tons of TVs in every direction you look! Great food and service too. Shout out to Brittany for friendly, prompt, and great service! Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"A great place. It's a little pricey but considering what's around it, it's not out of line. They have a ton of beers to choose from and a wide selection of food. Amy is always a great server and if you can't get her, the rest of the staff seem to be great as well. They carry UFC fights so that's why I go plus their food and beer selection is great."}
{"text":"Been here a few times now.  Being a vegetarian the first time I just had the hummus appetizer which I was not a fan of.  It was really thick and dry which made scooping it up on the veggies and pita extremely difficult.  Not very flavorful either, but I guess hummus isn't what they're trying to win over customers with.  The other two times I got the veggie burger which was really, really good!  It's made in house, which automatically makes it better then any frozen burger out there.  It has a sweet soy glaze on it too which tastes amazing.  It held together pretty well also.  I do think this place is overpriced....particularly because of the $2 upcharge for fries instead of chips.  Really?  When you're paying $11-$18 for a burger or sandwich, lets throw in the fries people.  And their water tastes like dirt which I always forget and then they bring out this monster sized cup of it, which after one sip I can't drink and then feel bad about wasting it."}
{"text":"Loved it.  Great service. Great good. Chef came out personally and brought my wife fresh chicken.  Amber was awesome!"}
{"text":"This place is so close to our house, we want to love it.  We've been a few times now.  Sometimes with kids, and sometimes just parents.  Food has always been good.  Service, meh. Right now for a non-important game, it's so loud (even outside) that none of us can hear each other.  Kind of a bummer.  We didn't go out for a \"silent\" meal."}
{"text":"I tried this place for the first time awhile ago and the PB&J sandwich that others were hesitant to try was awesome. 

Although I am typically a PBR and Tequila guy I was happy to see the Leinenkugel's sign since being from Wisconsin and my fiance went to school with the owners.  I was disappointed they only had only one choice of it. 

Oh well, other than that the service was good but a bit busier than I like. ( i prefer a quieter setting)  All in all I give it a thumbs up and will try again sometime. I do prefer Wimpy's in downtown Chandler though."}
{"text":"I was expecting better burgers since that's what they specialize in. Step up from Red Robin. Way to busy and over rated for the line."}
{"text":"Great addition to the 7th street district. Great atmosphere for casual dining and watching the game. Lots of great taps!!"}
{"text":"Food is good, atmosphere is nice, but OMG the prices!! Family of 4 and our meal came to $50 (2 Kids meals and 2 adult meals, no drinks or alcohol)! Crazy expensive! Wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Sweet redemption! Thank you Cold Beers & Cheeseburgers

We returned with our gift card and would like to report that the device and the food was excellent. Abbie was amazing! 

We ordered the Hangover and the Bacon PB&J with onion rings and tater tots. OMG to my surprise the bacon pb&j was unbelievable!

Thank you again.  Great job!"}
{"text":"The name says it all. Whether it's a place to watch the game or chill with friends I can always see myself coming back for more. Great Apps and burgers that will make you wanna eat out."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! I know that I'll get my burger cooked the way I like it every time. They have good deals on Wednesday nights too!"}
{"text":"Been to many burger places and so far this one is BEST BANG FOR YOUR $$$. 

Thick burgers and wide variety of toppings. 

Service is quick. 

Check out my pics."}
{"text":"Honestly...the food isn't horrible. The real problem is the pricing. There's no way you're getting out of this place for less than $20 per person. Everything is an up-charge and for a place that you just want a cold beer and cheeseburger you're going to end up paying steak-house prices. 

The food is okay. I've tried a few different burgers and the chicken sliders. I'll say I think they have great buffalo sauce BUT I find the the chicken to be very strange. I think they use deli-sliced chicken or something which is just not what you expect when you order a chicken entree from a restaurant. 

On one hand I'm happy to see new businesses move into the area. On the other hand....I wish it was a different restaurant because this one is blah. 

I LOVE to dine out but if a cold beer and cheeseburger is what you're after: go to the grocery store and grill some
Burgers and get a 6 pack for 1/4 of the price (and probably better too)."}
{"text":"Great Tater tots. 

Okay burgers. 

Way overpriced. 

We came for lunch and started off with the buffalo chicken tater tots. They were great and we really enjoyed them. 

Then we got our burgers. They were meh.....
My main problem was that the bun was wayyyy to big and the bread was kind of stale. I ordered my burger medium rare, and it was a bit over cooked and under seasoned. 

For $62 we had 3 burgers, no drinks and an appetizer for 3 people. 

Probably won't be back...."}
{"text":"So i gave this place a second try because my boyfriend likes it...and well it is disgusting. I ordered a hot dog last night and the bun was toasted but i could tell that it was a stale bun. I took the hot dog right out of it and ate it with a fork and knife. Even if the bun was not stale it was enormous so the hot dog to bun ratio would have made it hard to eat anyway. The tap water there is disgusting. We had to order a sub par milkshake to counteract the nasty water.My bf got the prime rib sandwich. We both agreed the meat was dry and overcooked. 
I will most likely never dine here again. Sorry honey..there are way too many other good burger joints to waste our money here. 
one positive note- the tater tots were good but it doesn't make up for the overall experience especially because a 5 year old can cook tater tots :)
service- mehhh"}
{"text":"I was excited to try this restaurant but that quickly turned to want to get my food and go home! The hostess was very unorganized and several tables were open and when asked about them the hostess had no idea they were open. We were finally seated at a table and the waitress was very sub par and took ten minutes to take our drink order. Then we ordered an appetizer and asked about an item on the kids menu. The appetizer arrived and also did my daughter's food that was not even ordered. We ordered our burgers and after a 35 minutes wait they finally arrived. I ordered medium on my burger and it was clearly well done!! The tots were cold and soggy and I could have done better at home in the oven. Save your money and go somewhere else!"}
{"text":"WAY TOO LOUD. Server could not hear our orders. She agreed that it was too loud, but her manager controls the volume. Also, ordered a thousand island burger, and It arrived without thousand island. Not impressed. 

Someone needs to discuss this with the Thursday night manager."}
{"text":"Walked in, got seated quickly, then waited for 10 min for someone, anyone, to  acknowledge our presence. When we finally asked a waitress if she could help us, she replied,\"Uh, I guess, yah.\"  Needless to say, we walked out. Is there a way to give a \"no-star\" review on Yelp?"}
{"text":"I'll start with the good: The food was pretty tasty - we got a burger and a side of hummus. Now the not so good: we waited quite some time for our drink order to arrive, the waitress was super nice but just took a long time. After she brought our food she let us know one item was going to come out separately because it wasn't ready quite yet (nbd). 20 min later the other part of the order came out. The waitress said she would take it off the price of the meal since it took so long (thank you for that!) when she brought the bill out she had removed that charge but then I noticed a $2 \"SPLIT CHARGE\". I asked her what that was for and she said the manager requires them to bill that whenever the customer requests a burger be cut in half (to share or even just to eat a little easier). That is honestly so insane to me. The burger was $10!! That is 1/5 if the price of the burger haha. 
Even though the food was good, we unfortunately will pick a different local spot to eat at."}
{"text":"Ordered Happy Hour Burger, Turkey Burger and Onion Rings 5/03/18.  All just barely warm, burger way over cook and turkey burger I never knew turkey could taste that bad, words cannot desribe the taste of that thing and it was just $12.50.  We pad and left, lesson learned."}
{"text":"The burgers are really delicious! Perfectly cooked and lots of good options for toppings. Also liked the options for turkey burgers and salads for the non-red meat eater in our group. The beer list is long and really, the cold Sam Adams and cheeseburger hit the spot! The prices are high and the service was not the best. Those are the reasons for the 3 stars instead of 4. We waited at the hostess stand behind another party and with a party behind us for about 15 minutes before the hostess even spoke to us. She was there the whole time but ignored everyone. She also had difficulty figuring out who to seat where. The food took a while but it was a crowded Saturday night and because it was so good it ended up no mattering."}
{"text":"Great location, great set up with the TV's playing all the games, and good burgers. Only thing that could make this place any better would be the service. Waitress only stopped by maybe twice in the hour I was here with friends and family. Once to take a drink order and food, and the second to ask if \"the food was ok?\" Had to flag down the waitress a few times with an incorrect order, water refills, and finally the check. For as large as this place is you would think they would staff plenty of waitresses. Correction. Waitresses found. They prefer to hang at the hostess stand vs. make their rounds. Managers also are pretty sparse. Looks like they prefer the patio drinking sugar free Red Bull. To be honest. Most of the staff look unhappy to be there."}
{"text":"I've never had anything on their menu that wasn't delicious! Just make sure to communicate well with your server, once I ordered an appetizer from someone who was not our server and we never got it, but it was okay because we definitely had enough food!"}
{"text":"Definitely a great spot to watch a game, tv's galore. The burgers are overpriced and you have to pay $2 to trade out fries for something else. The service was a little on the slow side when we went on a week day but overall a good place to check out for some high end bar food."}
{"text":"We went for dinner.  I thought, ' who orders Chinese chicken salad?' It's not 1985.  So I went for the French dip.  The sauce was very thick. It may have been 90 % A-1 with a little water added.  I ate half. Went home hungry.  Had an 80.00 check.   ( when the food is no good at least you want a buzzzzzz). My husband was equally disappointed. 

Please managers, Taste Your Food.  Taste it often. Fix it often.  Don't run your business out the door.  

Also, the hamburger buns are too big.  Not everyone wants to eat that many carbs so  consider offering a smaller bun.  

BTW. I did not complain so much as pointed out to the manager the horrid sandwich but he had that glazed eye look about him.....I don't think he cares...if he doesn't care why should I return?"}
{"text":"This place is always nice for happy hour. TONS of beer to choose from - on tap, in a bottle, or in a can! I love the sweet potato tater tots, and have enjoyed every burger that I've eaten here. This location is close to my work and on my way home - and I feel like I should stop in more often. It's a sports bar feel, with a patio - yet I think it's family oriented. I hear they are moving, but not too far. I will follow them when they do!"}
{"text":"Awesome food. Awesome service. I thought it was a little strange that they had a valet service but whatever. Great sports bar with a great selection of draught."}
{"text":"Man oh man. This place is bomb!!! $4 Kiltlifter during happy hour? Burgers with truffles??? Yes. Yes. Yes. Oh gosh YESS!!! I love how creative their burgers are. I love that you can get the meat cooked to order. I love this place. Worth the wait."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. Best place in Glendale. Beer is ice cold and food is on point."}
{"text":"Great food, great beers, great place to watch a game. Could not have really done a better job upgrading the old uncle bears."}
{"text":"Terrible service and staff. The manager Tod Rademacher was extremely rude to my family and myself."}
{"text":"We ordered the the buffalo chicken egg rolls and it was amazing! We finished before we thought to take a picture. I ordered the blue cheese burger and it was BIG! It was decent, but I wasn't impressed. I also ordered a Bloody Mary and that was really good. The atmosphere was okay, we sat on the patio and it was a nice day, but with the patio facing the street it kind of ruins things. The service was eh, could be better. I don't think I'll be back because I don't like to eat that much meat and it just felt unimpressive."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this establishment! The food and service is great. I love the variety of the menu too. This restaurant will not disappoint."}
{"text":"Should be called 1/2 lb hockey pucks and cold-fries. All of the food was so dry I drank two beers too try and choke down half the burger, and a few fries. The service was horrible , yet plenty of staff doing very little. $13.50 for a burger and upcharge to get cold fries $2. If the food is great along with the service you can justify $15.50 for a burger & fries."}
{"text":"Ok, this is why some restaurants thrive, and some just do \"so-so\". The hamburger was very good, however, you are forced to get a side of overcooked potato chips, or pay more for any other side. $13+ the side. My husband ordered a side of french fries. I had a few. I felt like they were basically salt sticks, with a little potato. I mean, the level of salt was at an unhealthy level for even a normally healthy individual...and I actually like some salt. I had the chips, which had a sort of bitter after taste because they were simply over cooked. And I ordered a side of coleslaw, which had no flavor and was basically a small bowl of raw cabbage. But at least it wasn't inedible because of salt. Notice to restaurant cooks: THEY PUT SALT ON THE TABLE...BUT WE CAN'T TAKE IT OFF IF YOU INUNDATE THE FOOD WITH IT! Anyway, the manager asked us how our meal was, and we told him about the salt, but he said next time to order it without it...not sure he cared if we come back...because if he did, he would have taken it off the bill. How much can a handful of fries cost...a lot less for him than it did us. And last but not least, the number of televisions in the place made it perfect for people who no longer have anything to say to each other...especially if you have a headache from sitting there with twenty huge screens burning your fricking retinas out. Service was just \"ok\". Burger was good, but not enough to bring me back. And while we're on the subject of nickel and diming people...10 parking spaces available...but huge parking place in the back are valet parking only.....complimentary? Riiiiight."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant! Great food and atmosphere.  Christina provided great service and menu suggestions. She knew we loved buffalo sauce and brought a side to dip with our house made kettle chips.  Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Went there last night with friends. The food was ok, service ok, but the biggest complaint was price. My wife and I had 4 mugs of beer, a burger meal each and an appetizer and we spent over $80. The Appetizer was hummus, which consisted of about a tablespoon of hummus, a couple table spoons of some guacamole with carrots, celery and toasted pita. Understand it was happy hour too. I'll have to look at the receipt, but either we got ripped off by the waitress or the restaurant. Either way, I could have gone to the Parkview Tap House for half that and had a better meal and beer."}
{"text":"Decided to have dinner at this place after a hard work out...We went on a Wednesday which the special for the night was Build Your Own Burger with Unlimited Toppings for $12.00.  It was a great deal.  
The restaurant is nice and our server was great at her job.  The food was good, a little on the salty side, but overall we had a good experience."}
{"text":"As with any new place it has to work out the kinks. I hope ownership reads the yelp reviews in time to do something about the little things peolle tend to complain about the most. New people, new restaurant of this size takes time to function flawlessly. 

The fire chips were excelent. The burgers and hot dog came out cold but had potential. It was only a Monday. I would be worried coming here on a friday or saturday in the early stage.

So after dinner i stayed to wait for a co-worker an have a couple more beers. .....

Natalie.  how refreshing. Great bartender"}
{"text":"Bad food. BAD service.

I ordered Cheeseburger Sliders and Tots. The sliders were a joke and the tots tasted like they were fried in very old oil. 

While I was chatting with my friends and waiting for the food, our server came over and slammed my plate down in front of me, which actually scared me and made me jump. Later on, I asked for hot sauce, and when she brought it over, she of course walked by quickly (without any eye contact) and also slammed it on the table. Everything she said to us was lazy, slurred, and unclear. On multiple occasions, we would have to ask each other \"What did she say?\". It was clear that she didn't want to be there. There is no reason for that bad attitude, especially since we did nothing that could have annoyed her.

Trust the negative reviews! Don't go here!"}
{"text":"Thursday evening and the place was pretty busy. Short  wait for a table and server came by after several minutes to take our drink orders. Some time to bring the drinks and then the server disappeared. She finally came back to take our order of 2 burgers, mac and cheese and a kids grilled cheese. After an hour of waiting, still no food and after telling the server we were leaving and would pay for our drinks, the food suddenly appears. The manager seems a little annoyed that we do not want the food and says we can have it to go, which we decline. Manager comments that he bought our food so we should take it, we didn't.  Seems like many of the reviews from the Scottsdale location are carried over to this location. They lost a customer."}
{"text":"This was my first time at this location. Pretty disappointed. I really wanted to like this place since hearing some friends talk about it. 
They missed 2 toppings on my burger and missed 1 topping on another in our party. One burger came out cold, so they took it back to put it back on the grill. It came back out as the rest of the group was either done with their meals or close to it. Lastly, all 5 burgers we're ordered medium rare, and all came out medium well. (Almost no pink at all).
After the food was brought out, our waitress walked by 3 times without checking on us. She finally saw us waving her down and she came over to correct our meals, bring out missing items, etc.
The manager did comp the meal that had to be reheated. Overall, I would go back again (maybe another location), but probably not on my own accord."}
{"text":"First time visiting on our anniversary lunch date. Ordered the pastrami burger. They forgot to put any toppings on and served it anyway. We let the server know there were no toppings.  She didn't apologize and brought the toppings out on a side plate and said \"I guess they forgot
\" Not impressed paying $20.50 for a burger and fries served this way."}
{"text":"Pains me to go 3 STARS here. I love this place. It's totally recoverable though. Let me explain.

Strong burger game here, damn near unparalleled. Great Atmo. Awesome service. Darcie and I sat at the bar and met Eric, our Bartender/Server. He was friendly, knowledgeable (esp on the 20 new beers on tap), dude was sporting a 1%-body-fat V-shape that should have had the ladies lined up out to Higley. Yeah, Darcie had NO issue sitting at the bar. But really, dude can't compete with my 52-year-old dad bod and beautiful bald head. Sometimes I just feel sorry for these handsome, young 2nd-placers. Yeeeeeeeee! ;)

Anyway. Adonis, er ah... Eric was awesome.

So, what went wrong? Thanks for getting me back on track.

#1 - The Pretzel Dip. The pretzels themselves are top shelf. They come out perfectly prepared, hot like the Sun, with texture to die for. {Needle rips across record} But DAMN! The dipping sauce is nasty. NazTAY! One try, and I was like: \"Eric, gonna need a To-Go box for these two tasty pretzels.\" 

I admit, I should have told him why. I should have said that I would be enjoying those pretzels a later time with a vastly superior dipping option called (Dun dun DA!) Tostitos Salsa Con Queso. But friends and neighbors, I had sat at the bar and started with a Space Dust. And you know damn well that cognition rapidly ebbs away as one of those disappears.

I think CB&C starts on the right path with their dip. It's got Nacho Cheese in it. Core success ingredient for sure. But then they add ASS. And things go horribly wrong. I would have been equally upset had I gotten some of it on the bottom of my shoe. Really, I was there about 6 hours ago and just typing this review has my lip curled, nose scrunched, and stomach somersaulting. Yikes! I'll add a sauce alternative at the end of the review... if anything, just to show I love ya and want to help.

#2 - The Side of Fries Jack. I would def prefer to exhaustively extoll the virtues of perhaps the best burger I have had in years, but the fry situation eclipsed said burger and pulled me down from cloud 9... and rivetted me in place. I could not stop thinking about the fact that I had paid $2 bucks for 27 fries. OK, typing that, it seems petty, but there were so few fries on my plate that it was easy to count them... and I could not stop myself from doing so. By easy, I mean, I did not have to move the burger or the onion rings on the plate and I did not have to whip out my finger and point while counting. 27. Nor were these fries huge. They were all less than 2\" inches in length with most over 1.25\". Sup Wit Dat? Did I tell my big homie Eric? No. Again. Space Dust. And I had moved on to a Coffee K√∂lsch (Oh my sweet Lord it was good).

So how do we restore the 5 STAR rating?

Let's start easy. Jump back in the kitchen and let the crew know they are executing in near top-notch form. Following the well-earned praise and encouragement, set the record straight that fries are not Bitcoin and should not be rationed as if they are. I really think this fry sitch was an oversite, but someone should really have noticed that quality/value deficiency. You guys get enough heat for being a bit pricey. Customer goodwill builds that return business and word-of-mouth.

OK, the pretzel dip. You can go so many far better ways. Here're a few:

a: Just go with regular Nacho Cheese. If this is already an option you should clearly state it. If it's not, please make it one for the love of God. Then retrain: \"OK, with the pretzel order do you want your dip regular or nasty?\" Actually, just completely get rid of that other dip atrocity. 

b: Go premium with Tow Truck Todd's Queso - 
-1 pack of Jimmy Dean Hot Sausage
-1 block of Velveeta 
-1 can of RO-TEL
-1 or 2 diced Jalapenos
In a medium pan or large skillet. Brown the sausage on medium heat. Pour off most of the fat. Return to heat. Thrown in the jalapenos. Cook 1-2 minutes. Begin adding the Velveeta in chunks to speed melting. Add the RO-TEL. Stir until fully melted and mixed. Drop heat to low and enjoy. 

Todd's my buddy. He showed me the recipe, it's awesome, I'm a fan. And you will be too.

Guys, if I was running the show, I'd kill your current dip and go Regular Nacho Cheese and offer Todd's as a $1 upgrade. 

Best of luck. I'll be back later, carrying a few extra STARS and high hopes.

Via Con Queso. :)"}
{"text":"I've dined at their Old Town location before, but this was my first time in their North Scottsdale location.  We dropped by for lunch on a Sunday around 11 am.  It was starting to get busy with people showing up to watch football games.  There's plenty of TV's throughout the bar, dining room, and patio areas....perfect for watching football.

After browsing the menu, we ordered:

Kiddo had the O-Lineman Burger, which was massive!  He's a growing boy though and easily man-handled it.  He loved it.

I had the Open Pit Burger...it had a lot of flavor.  The BBQ Sauce complimented the Burger well.

Mom had the Prime Rib Sliders....she really enjoyed them too.

We all split a side of Hot & Smokey Mac n Cheese....the diced Jalape√±os that were mixed into it gave it a nice spicy bite....yum!  It's a healthy portion that can easily be shared between 2 or 3 people.

Service here was so/so....I had to flag down the server to refill my Beer glass....food came out hot and fast and our orders were taken right after we sat down....it was the refills that were problematic.

Overall, I like this location.  It's more laid back than the Old Town location, which is more of a party atmosphere.

{"text":"I love their Juicy Lucy burger, but at this location they seem to struggle to get the temperature right. I order my burgers medium well. The last two times I have been here, half my burger is perfect and the other half is very undercooked. I'm not a fan of their chips. And I think it's a little ridiculous that they have a $3 charge for substituting a side (for example, if you would rather have french fries instead of chips). They also have an extra charge to add a sauce to your burger. It ends up become a pricy meal for a burger!"}
{"text":"Good concept but REALLY expensive! Burger was good  but not worth $13. Service was slow and the place was kinda dead but have been there when super busy and service was slow then too.  Don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"Great beer and burgers! Would highly recommend this place! The atmosphere was exactly what youd expect from a high end restaurant. Will definitly be back!"}
{"text":"We are disappointed every time we come. The servers and bartenders are rude, the service is slow. We were one of 3 tables in the whole restaurant and wanted to watch a soccer game. One time they couldn't get the game after waiting 20 minutes for the owner. The second time they got the game but refused to put the sound on unless it was football. We were one of three tables in the whole restaurant at 11am Monday morning. The bathroom toilets leak and are rusting, there are holes in the bathroom walls. It's not worth paying $14 for a burger, $10 for fries. Last time we will come back."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. Son and I stopped there for dinner. Burgers were average, and $35 for 2 burgers, 1 side of fries, and 2 glasses of water seemed on the high side for the area. And I'm a native. Service poor. Our waitress spent most of the evening flirting with a guy in a booth a few over, and kept having others take care of our table. When we wanted to leave I finally had to flag a busboy over and ask him for the check. He wanted to know who our waitress was, and we didn't know, as we'd only seen her when she took our order and since then had been sitting with the guy in the other booth. Finally a different waitress brought out the bill and we paid it and left. Average food, higher than average prices, and poor service. We will not be back."}
{"text":"Food is good... service is absolutely horrible. Got sat and waited ten minutes for our waitress to come and take drink orders. Then, it took her 30 minutes to come back to take food order. Awful. 
Finally, I ordered a salad that came with the wrong dressing, and when I asked for the right dressing they charged me for it. 
Spent 2 hours at this restaurant."}
{"text":"Since moving a little bit more south into a new custom space, the service and food have only IMPROVED!!!  In the past, a strong negative was the service (spotty) and bland milkshakes.  It was routinely understaffed and molasses slow to the check.  All fixed!!!!  Well done.

Apps continue to come out hot and the burgers are delicious from top to bottom of the menu selections.  I personally love the Pittsburger,  a patty with slaw, fries and a grilled tomato.  To make it authentic like in Pittsburgh (I used to live there), you should pay the extra $2 to put a soft fried egg inside and ditch the tomato.

The fries are the bistro type that still have the skins on them.  Ask the staff when you order for some ketchupino.  The spicy ketchup is great with the fries, rings and tots and for some odd reason, CBCB doesn't promote it.  Even better with the ketchup into are the onion rings.  Crispy and evenly battered, they pair well with everything.

The beer list is expansive.  Lots of craft beers and commons all priced right.  My favorite on the list is the vanilla porter and Huss Coffee Kolsch when they have it.

To top it all off, it's a great scene to catch any live sporting event.  

I doubt my previous reviews at their old location made any impact but I am thrilled they got the message somehow and made the fine tweaks.  CBCB is one of my favorite burger bars in a big sea of Phoenix burger bars.  Keep up the good work!!!"}
{"text":"Only negative is the service (spotty) and bland milkshakes.  It is routinely understaffed and slow to the check.

But the goods so very much outweigh the few bads.  Apps are always hot and the burgers are delicious from top to bottom of the menu selections.  I personally love the Pittsburger.

{"text":"Is a great place to hang out with friends during happy hour during the week. I plan to go back often and advise other family members and friends."}
{"text":"Oh my talk about down to earth great service. Our server, Hannah just made our day. We went in when they first opened and were not crowded,  told Hannah that we were going to hang a round finishing our beers because they weren't busy yet, 2 hours later she still made us feel that we were at home and even though it had gotten extremely busy, it was ok that we were still there. We need more servers like Hannah. Thank you. I rarely give 5 stars, but Hannah earned all 5."}
{"text":"The soft pretzel app was delicious. I wasn't impressed by my Ring of Fire burger. I found it a bit bland. Basically a burger with a lot of jalape√±o.  It was a bit too loud in there to have any real conversation. The red sangria was delicious. I may go back for the sangria and pretzel"}
{"text":"Last Friday got carry out from here as it's super close to my nail salon. I didn't get a burger, crazy right?! But I got the buffalo chicken egg rolls & was pleasantly surprised. They were very good & had a great taste & the chicken wasn't dry. I also got a Caesar salad which was good but that really can't be messed up. 
While waiting on the food the atmosphere was very chill & had a great look.  

Would definitely go back to dine in & get a burger!"}
{"text":"Had to go check out the vibe and burgers. The food was good and the beer was cold. I was slightly disappointed in the size of the burgers, but the fries were really good. Our server was jusy okay."}
{"text":"I was sad when Uncle Bears left this location.  Went to CBCB for their Grand Opening yesterday.  Hamburgers and crinkle cut fries were delicious.  Also had the pretzels for appetizers which were very good too.  Service was awesome.  Everyone was so friendly!  We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"They were playing a Patriots game that was only available via live stream so they scored huge points in my book. The ambiance was nice and our server was pleasant. I'd give a higher rating but I didn't really try their food, just the drinks, save for some onion rings which were  good. Come here, it's an awesome bar, nice people, plus they have a pool table, dart board, and old school pac man machine."}
{"text":"The burger was so good and there are so many TV's to watch the game on. My server was super helpful and very attentive. The only downside is I didn't see bar games at this one, as other cbcb I've been to have them."}
{"text":"Second & last time here. Really wanted to like it. Service was fair. Girl was friendly, just not real great. Had hot dog & was very disappointed in the bun. It was not toasted, just so dry you couldnt eat it. Peppers that were to be sweet were very hot. Tomatoes tasteless. French fries were not great but were above average. Hamburgers were average, not bad. Thought cost was lots higher than food warrented."}
{"text":"The service is terrible. The waitress cant even remember your beer order. She delivers your beer and never comes back for your food order. I ordered a 2nd beer and it never came. Some one else had to come take the food order."}
{"text":"Place is quite awesome ! I built my own burger, was really good! Huge craft beer selection. Good sports bar vibes"}
{"text":"This place was just alright with me. We went on a Friday night and we got sat right away. The environment is pretty cool, there was good music and a lot of TV on all different channels for everyone to watch. Waitress was very friendly as well. The only compliant I really had was the food wasn't great for the price. I honestly think they are way overpriced for the food. I had the Cincinnati (which is a hotdog with beef chili, cheese, and onions), it was good but I just wish there was a lot more chili and the cheese on top actually melted. The hot dog itself was good though. The fries are really yummy but I hate that I had to pay an extra 2 dollars to get fries... especially from a place that has burgers (fries should be standard but that's just me). The bill was about 45 dollars (before tax) and that's for 1 burger, 1 hotdog, and 2 beers. I probably won't come again for the food, but might for the beer."}
{"text":"My husband and I were really in the mood for a hamburger. We decided to give this place a try. While we liked the bar patio and atmosphere in general the food was underwhelming. Hamburgers were dry and not hot. The beers were not cold but room temperature. The server did not mention there was an up charge for the sides we got. So before tip, 2 people both had burgers and a beer.... $51. Was not worth it. Bummer!"}
{"text":"Not overly impressed!! Most of the food at our table was good. But hubby ordered a phx cheesesteak and it was poorly lacking in meat.  He did send it back with very little improvement!  The waitress seemed annoyed when we asked for a water refill.   The manager took about 15 minutes to come over after hubby complained about his food,  was very unprofessional.   We won't be back!"}
{"text":"If the slow service doesn't turn you off, then the bad food will.  Four of us sat at the bar, where you think the service would be on point - especially when there were only 8 other people at the large bar.  We ordered food and viola 45 minutes later our burgers arrived cold and next to lifeless fries.  The cheese on the burger had that glaze and consistency of a plate that had sat in the service window way too long.  There is nothing that could bring me back to this chain.  Given the mediocre reviews of them all, I'm surprised they are still expanding.  I hear the time clock ticking away as they run out of new people willing to take a chance and finally have to improve or close."}
{"text":"Well we love it service burgers wings drinks beer are da bomb. Love the tots food is always hot and fresh"}
{"text":"I keep trying to give this place a chance but I guess third time isn't the charm. Everytime we have gone here the food has been messed up, and their response everytime is \"mistakes happen\"... well we called in our order and once again they screwed up and gave our food to someone else. So after waiting 45 minutes for a pick up order, we received the right food. It's really a shame because the food is good when you get the order right, but they take no accountability for their actions. Should have stuck with BJS brewery."}
{"text":"Way over priced.  $2 extra for fries  To replace the chips.  Seriously!     In & out/Red Robin have better burgers.  I was excited to to go here .  My girlfriend and I have been waiting for it to slow down so we could try it out.      Had to ask for second beer.     Huge disappointment.   Way over priced.   $15 for a burger without fries .  Wtf!   I was expecting it to be really good for that price.    I will not be back unless they make some common sense changes.  Nickel and dimming customs in my opinion will eventually shut the doors."}
{"text":"Horrible. We used to love coming here, and every time I go with my mom the service and everything is great! Now I'm not one to complain about service or anything, And I barely ever leave something as bad as a yelp review, However, I've been here twice with my roommates (we're all 20-21 and three of us are servers) and both times we have had absolutely horrible service. It's hard for me to say that because I am a server so I understand how hard it can be, but both times we have gone it has been completely slow. The first time our server never came back until she started pushing us to pay, and the second was even worse. First our server, Carley, took a while to bring us menus and greet us, which is no big deal, but once our order was placed she completely disappeared. One of us wanted to order a drink but Carley never came back. We ended up having to wait until our food came out and asked the runner for it, and she said she would get our server. She still never came until the manager came to ask us how our food was, and we asked him to order the drink. Right after, she came and asked what we wanted. My boyfriends burger was way overcooked (he asked for rare and it was well done) and he barely touched it. The drink took forever to come out and by the time it did we were all done with our meal. And, to top it, she ended up adding auto-gratuity to a party of 6. I have never EVER heard of this happening before in my years as a server and consumer, it has always been a bill over $200 or a party of 8 or more. I've also never been auto grated for any size party at that location, so it was very strange. We love this burger joint and it's unfortunate that this is the closest to our home. We won't be returning to this location."}
{"text":"Talk about classy burgers. The O-linebackers is a family fave, two grilled cheese sandwiches hugging a yummy half pound burger. Next to a mountain of tater tots, you definitely get as much food as you pay for! It's not the quickest restaurant ever, but the food is always hot and delish and there are plenty of tvs around to catch up on whatever your favorite sporting event is."}
{"text":"Just stopped by to celebrate my sons birthday & had a wonderful night.  Over 40 beers on tap and the menu is awesome. My boy failed the burger challenge but was lucky enough to receive a shirt anyway!  Great food, great service, great beer... it doesn't get much better."}
{"text":"although the restaurant was busy the wait was short and worth it. I got the Mac and Cheese Burger was best burger i've had in a while. this restaurant has amazing food and service, definitely coming back and definitely recommend for anyone ."}
{"text":"One of our favorite Neighborhood restaurants! Excellent Service, Delicious Food, highly recommend for a reliable great eat!"}
{"text":"This my my go to local spot & just moving from Chicago it gives me a taste of home. GREAT can't wait till it get a little cooler and I can enjoy it!"}
{"text":"So, cool new place in the old Tailgators spot. Here's the thing though, for two burgers, two beers and a cider it was $52!!! I was a little shocked at the price when we got our bill so I refrained from writing a review for a few days. 

Service, our waitress was adorable, sweet girl, very attentive, I believe her name was Callie/Kaley. She's great. Now there was a girl at the hostess stand that held a menu up to block as to what she was saying right in front of us to another hostess - lesson here ladies - if it's not appropriate to say in front of a customer, it can wait. Secrets don't make friends, and non friend feels make for a non returning customer. 

Overall, I was pleased with the gluten free bun option, that's a big reason I scored a 4 star and our waitress. I'm going to have to give it another go before I'll choose this place over another burger place. 

The hubs thought it was great though, and he likes his burgers spicy!!"}
{"text":"Great food- prices are definitely steep. Just beware of prices before you order apps drinks food etc- adds up real quick. $75 before tip for 2 peoples lunches? Come on."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this place, the tap beer was ice cold and good selection so that was a plus the food prices seemed high but if the food was great then worth it.
Well, here is my dilemma, burgers are 12 to 20 bucks, that's pricey for a burger in my opinion when it comes with chips! fries or tots you pay 2 bucks more for. In my opinion that getting steep. 
Then the food came out and it was cold, not Luke warm but cold. 
That aside the flavor seemed good but the burger was cold to the point the cheese was firm again. Then they forgot my 2 dollar tots but when they came out they were hot and good.
So I am hoping we just had a bad experience as far as food temp. but I paid 20 bucks for a burger and tots and was not satisfied this time. we now jokingly call it \"cold beer and cold cheeseburgers\"."}
{"text":"Nice sports bar with a large selection of thick 1/2 lb. burgers. 1st time there and the juicy lucy was good and cooked properly and the homemade chips and service were good. My only issue was the cost $16.48 for burger, chips, and ice tea plus tip was too much for lunch."}
{"text":"If you're looking for some good bar food and lots of TVs, this place is your place. I'm not super into that scene but went here with family because it was close. They have a toooooooonnnnnnn of TVs so if your team isn't on one of them, I don't know what to tell you!

The menu is pretty extensive and they do have a \"Make Your Own Burger\" menu which is pretty cool. The burgers are enormous as well so be sure that you're very VERY hungry when you go. I've heard that the mac & cheese is great as well but didn't have a chance to try it. Overall, pretty good for bar food.

The service was pretty good as well. Nothing to crazy or over the top but we were well served throughout dinner. 

Overall, I'd say this place is pretty good for a sports bar and I'd probably come again for a big game day!"}
{"text":"Great burgers with a variety to choose from! The brews are frosty ice cold! My beer was so cold there were ice bits that had formed! Love that there are tons of tv's!"}
{"text":"The burgers are awesome!!!! It's so big I usually can split it between 2 meals. The wife and I always get the pretzels and cheese to start the meal off as well. Make sure to get your burger on a pretzel bun, they are my favorite."}
{"text":"I love this places food! Initially customer service want so great but they are getting much better! There are still a few wait staff that I dread if they walk up to the table but all in all much better.  Way to turn things around!"}
{"text":"I have been here twice now with two very different experiences. 1- Slow bar service, cold food, and no follow up. 2- Great burgers and an attentive bar tender. 

I always give a place (especially a newly opened place) a couple of chances before I write them off. So, I will go again to watch a game or grab happy hour."}
{"text":"Dani is the bestest! She is the only reason why I come to CBC! Thank you lord for blessing us with an amazing bartender!"}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant on a Thursday night and it was packed, food was awesome, staff was awesome, and TVs in the beer were ridiculously awesome! Definitely the best bar around to watch any sporting event at."}
{"text":"By far the best burger I've ever had!! Will be back here many many times! Wait staff was very friendly. Awesome vibes and a good place to watch the games."}
{"text":"We are regulars here. This location has become a huge disappointment lately. Very nice people work there, but the ladies room is not very nice.  The door locks don't work, the faucet has been broken for over a year. They have all this $$$$ to build new locations, but don't update or even maintain the original locations. Come on CB!"}
{"text":"Food is pretty good, service was decent, but the cost of the food is too high.  Decent choice but definitely not a go to."}
{"text":"Last couple times there, attacked by multiple flies.  They should keep the doors closed.  Food is okay and priced too high."}
{"text":"By far one of my favorite places to go for a cold beer and a burger. This location has been quite exceptional with the service and I cannot say enough about our server Trish. She was very accommodating and very upbeat. She also shared some options on the menu that we had no idea about after having visited this location several times. The food is always tasty and fresh, service is excellent, and the atmosphere is entertaining. Two thumbs way up!"}
{"text":"Just moved out here. The this place is literally within walking distance of me. I am most excited about that part! I lease apartments in the area and hear nothing but good things about this place. I think they changed their name once before.

Anyhow, I gave them a shot and then I was hooked. I've tried this place twice already. They have a great menu! So many burgers to choose from, and an insane amount of different beer! Service can get a little crazy. So definitely \"get in line\" with their sweet phone app to save you some time. They have a crazy amount of the, so it's great for playoffs! They also advertise a mobile app to where you can hear the tv of you're choice from you're phone, which is a great idea. I couldn't get it to work, but hopefully that pulls through. 

Service can get a little slow, but all the girls and staff seem great. The price isn't that crazy for the items I their menu too. So...if price, food quality, and service are great....that's enough to keep a customer coming. 

If you like cold beer, and cheeseburgers (hence the name), you should definitely this place a shot. 

Rylee, is the best server btw!"}
{"text":"Not Impressed. Cold food, no refills and lackluster service. 
Waited over an hour (after ordering)to be served cold burgers with coagulated cheese on stale buns. Yuck!! Waitress never offered refills and was preoccupied with others. 
Drinks were decent tasting and would have been nice to have another- that's all they have going for em."}
{"text":"Burger great. Fries ok. Ice water gross. Probably wont ever come out of out way to eat here."}
{"text":"Food was pretty lackluster and service was even worse. Our server was very uninterested with us, not mean or rude, just didn't give a f*%k. We went for Mother's Day. Perhaps it was because they feel all us cheap moms are trying to get a free meal, but it was definitely not worth 50 bucks. I'll pass. No thanks."}
{"text":"My first time to this location(9/19). ¬†I got the Philly Cheese Steak, with jalapenos and peppers, it comes with them. ¬†They forgot the jalapenos and peppers. ¬†I couldn't find a waitress and went to the front, to get a menu, to confirm it came with them. ¬†It does! ¬†When I asked if I could get some jalapenos and peppers, I was told they would have to make another sandwich because everything was mixed in a pot together. Then a manager, not knowing my irritation asked how everything was. ¬†I told him to tell the kids in the kitchen to stir the pot once in awhile. ¬†He gave me another excuse and said it was not pre-mixed. ¬†He gave me $5 off of a $68 bill. ¬†It is a $15 sandwich that I have still never received, they should have made another sandwich. ¬†I could care less about $5. ¬†It did seem like it was a standardized response, probably because they make a lot of mistakes. I will give them one more shot, in case this was an odd day. ¬†I have a strong feeling it is just how they operate.

Returned today to give them a second chance. We got there at 11, place is empty.  The young girl, sat us in the back corner (far SE, worst spot in the house).  I told her we'll take a high top.  Then we sat there for 15 minutes, nobody came to take an order.  Got up and walked across the street to the Culinary Drop Out.  They were great.  We walked by the CB&C manager, he said, \"By\", in a dopey way.  The owner needs to visit this location.  It really is horrible and can't compare to the one on Scottsdale Rd."}
{"text":"Whoever was in charge of remodeling this place Knocked it out of the park and its about time..  very busy when we go but deservedly so, awesome place to eat drink and watch games lots of TV's."}
{"text":"My son introduced me to this place and I loved it from the start. Service is great and so is the food!!"}
{"text":"And I didn't wanna go....OMG this is my new favorite restaurant!!!!! I am SO impressed with the selection and the alternatives they have for those of us (ME!!!) that stay away from red meat and pork! OMG!! A grilled turkey burger served on lettuce (sans bun) and the side of asparagus and roasted tomatoes was INCREDIBLE!!!! The 'Juicy Lucy' was also ordered and it was DRIPPING with cheesy goodness!!!! Literally dripping!!! The selection of beers, wines, cocktails was fantastic!! Service was top notch too! I'm impressed and can't wait to come back!!! Yummy!"}
{"text":"I love this place! The Bacon Blue burger is out of this world, and they have TVs for the sports games everywhere! The complimentary valet parking is quick and easy."}
{"text":"Probably the best burger I have ever had! Finally a great burger in Phoenix! The homemade chips were delicious as well!"}
{"text":"The food and the atmosphere are really great here, just a little pricey for a burger place. They have one of the best mac n cheese in town as well as fabulous onion rings, the burgers have always been cooked perfectly!"}
{"text":"Excellent Food! The variety or Burgers, Sandwiches and other choices are Amazing! Seems like there are as many side choices as there are burger choices. The Sweet Tots were Very Very Good. It was the 2nd night of this location being open. They were packed. Great Service by the Team. Even Aaron the GM was doing whatever it took to make our party have a great time. Thanks for making it so special for us all. I can't wait to try out more of the food!"}
{"text":"Great beer and atmosphere. Food is hit and miss...some plates, like the hot dog and tots, are just dumped with chili and cheese. Salads are very good. Hostess and waitress were not that friendly after getting there from a few hours driving."}
{"text":"This is ok food with a good atmosphere. However the kitchen is ridiculously slow and the staff/servers are definitely more miss than hit. As well prices are high for what you get, burgers don't seem too bad at first but after you get tots instead of chips(chips?) your paying 15-20. I've been five times. I was trying to give it a chance, but cannot honestly keep going back. There are better places to go. Maybe for just a beer I'll go back."}
{"text":"Great new place to come on 7th street. Been to the one in Scottsdale and glad they built one near me."}
{"text":"Thanks for the $5 off yelp check in. That was great. The burgers we ordered were HUGE!!! The service was okay. It was nice to sit outside in AZ and kind of feel a chill in the air in early March! There is a large selection of beer and burgers (duh!). A must try place if you are in this area."}
{"text":"Redeemed by the peanut butter and jelly burger, beer flight and delish onion rings (and once again Christina's great service!). Work out the management issues and you'll have a perfect restaurant."}
{"text":"Super impressed with their burgers and selection of food! Happy hour wasnt too impressive nor was the waitress as she took a long time. Great atmosphere and food though and good spot to come to regularly."}
{"text":"Sweet joint! I was here with my parents and my kids (3 generations!) and it was perfect. We needed some good pub food. Kids had grown up burgers because the sliders were too small, but otherwise everything was great. Burgers tasted good. Wings were good. Mac and cheese was great!

Fun and chill. Check it out! PS-Gerry says hi!"}
{"text":"We've been to other locations so we know the food is good and we were excited to see this location open up just down the street from home. Walked in this evening a little after 6pm and was told it would be a 45 minutes wait. Didn't see anyone waiting for a table and 3 were open. When I asked if we could be seated at one of the open tables we were told by the hostess, no. She then went on to tell me how packed they've been since opening. Smug attitude by a hostess will not earn my business.  Guess we'll continue to be locals at the Blue 32 down the street where we're always treated with respect, regardless of how \"busy\" they are."}
{"text":"Love the new location!! Looks great. Awesome atmosphere, Gilbert needed this bar. And Aaron the GM, made sure to stop by and introduce himself. What a gentleman. Our server was very knowledgeable, she suggested a great burger for my boyfriend and I to split."}
{"text":"I probably won't come back here. I usually don't give 2 stars unless I was completely dissatisfied. 
I went with my coworker during my hours of security. The name completely drew us in, the experience is another store. Read on. 


Food: I had a custom chicken patty burger that was 90% wrong. The reason I didn't go back, was because the grilled patty just wasn't worth getting it redone and having it again regardless of the condiments. No flavor to the chicken at all. 

Service and Wait: The price was absolutely WAY to high for the quality. I had fruit to go along with my meal and that was as mediocre as can be. Selection of random fruit mostly consisted of melon and grapes. Their is a UPcharge for every little thing, and I felt milked. 
The wait was rather long and we did not go at peak hours this was 11:30am. I did really like the atmosphere. The music and seating wasn't bad and they offer patio seating that is gated. Sprinklers are outside for those sweaty days. Servers consist of big breasted women similar to Hooters. Service was ok, we didn't get any recommendations as we told them this was our first time here. 


My partner who chose a custom beef patty burger was also dissatisfied. The conclusion was to not go back to this place. If I were it would have to just be beer."}
{"text":"This Place just opened up next to the salon I work in. AMAZING! They hit the ground running, 

It's a deli style, where you order at the counter and they bring you the food. I had the Grayhawk Turkey Club and the turkey was great! No packaged crap here. It was thick sliced and probably rotisserie. For the side I had sweet potato tater tots. DELISH! The have regular fries, sweet fries, tater tots, onion rings, etc. 

Great looking salads, Chicago-style dogs, gourmet burgers and yummy sounding mac and cheese. 

The only thing keeping it from 5 stars is the price. It's great for dinner, but a little steep for a work day lunch."}
{"text":"Omg! I had the prime rib burger and about lost my mind!!! It was amazing!! I added bacon to my burger and it was over the moon good!! I would have given it 5 stars but $16 for a burger is a tad steep, but I guess it was worth it! Our server was wonderful too!! Just a good place for a burger and beer!!"}
{"text":"First time at this restaurant chain and the food was average at best.  Fries and onion rings too salty.  Service was poor.  Up charged for everything.   Four people with no alcohol  $65 bucks."}
{"text":"SO, I feel like this was due, given all the REALLY bad reviews. In short- it's definitely not as good as the Old Town location, but not the catastrophe people are saying. In all fairness, does anyone expect a 5-Star dining experience for a sports bar?! Reset your standards, people. Service was totally fine, food was great. A little cooler than I'd like and took a little longer to come out, but not a problem as we were there to watch the game. I'm confident that as the location matures, these small nuances will go away. Great location, though. 
**the wait list option time is not correct. The hostess told me its 'something Yelp does on their own, they don't control the time'. We checked in (online) with what yelp said was a 5 min wait, but waited 20. Again not a problem, just something worth noting.**"}
{"text":"Always consistent  I matter what location you go to. Love making my own burger master piece. Kid friendly too with crayon and coloring pages"}
{"text":"The thousand island burger and sweet potato tots= delicious!  Points lost for the clientele,  or lack there of. There's never anyone in there (at least when I've gone which I'd after 7pm). I hear their happy hour is hopping!"}
{"text":"I loved this place and was glad I saw it on yelp. The burgers are awesome and huge. I had the burger with Mac and cheese and we all split a truffle fries with garlic and parmesan which u you should not  miss out on trying. This place had so many beer choices to make a beer lover stumped with so many options. I opted for the local craft beer  lumberjack ipa from a brewery from flagstaff. If your a burger and beer fan this is a sure hit."}
{"text":"I am a frequent diner and I travel all over the country , it's always nice for me to find an establishment that tries to exceed my expectations , but reality of preparing food , and getting it right every time is just not realistic .. Too many variables , etc ,, my experience at this location was great , the service was amazing , the atmosphere is great , I will say there was a problem with the preparation of an entree which was served undercooked , then a replacement was also served up undercooked ,, the mgmt took full responsibility and was empathetic and made it as okay as it could have been ..  I still recommend it .  Try it !"}
{"text":"Seriously-the best looking Chicago dog I have ever had....and the best tasting.  Staff is great-chili is the best I have had at a restaurant.  Can't go wrong here.  Beer selection is phenomenal--so yes it deserves every one of the 5 stars.  $9 for a large size dog and homemade chips.."}
{"text":"Burgers are quite good, service was OK the first time and bad tonight.  Arrived about 9 PM just after Cubs win in game 1 of NLCS, so was able to get a table. Ordered a Stella and Ring of Fire burger, both were good and the burger had the advertised kick to it.  As for the service...my waitress went MIA right after she dropped it off (without silverware or napkins initially); when my beer finished I really needed a lemonade to quench the fire associated with the burger, but she never came by to see how I was doing.  All of a sudden a guy in a white shirt and trendy tie starts walking down the aisle....aha, the manager, he will ask how things are and I can tell him I need a lemonade.  But no, with his eyes glued straight ahead, he walks back in the kitchen. Finally the hostess walks by and gets me my lemonade.  Basically most of the waitresses seemed more intent on socializing with each other than catering to their customers.  At least they didn't charge me for the lemonade.

I can just see this place going down in a couple of years due to the nonchalant service and don't-give-a-hoot management, and the higher-ups of the chain scratching their head saying \"all the studies show people really like our product\"...

Others have noted the parking fiasco here, my first attempt to dine here led to me giving up and going elsewhere.  Fortunately I can walk from my house to the place so that is the only way I'll do it from now on."}
{"text":"Hate to echo what I read \"after\" I started eating here. It took about 30 mins to get the majority of our meal. Chicago dog bun was dry, brittle and fell apart on me after the first bite. I will say that there wings and ham sandwich were pretty good but all-in-all not too impressed with the place. Ambiance is open and sporty with plenty of TVs and they definitely have lots of good beers on tap. Not a place to have a great meal though based on my experience. We were excited for our first experience as we noticed it was always packed but realized its probably because its new so everyone is checking it out. Recommend they change a few things if they want to sustain a crowd. I'm reluctant to return. Too many other options."}
{"text":"Even though Yelp says otherwise, this location is NOT DOG FRIENDLY. Do not bring your dog!

Also, even though Yelp says no wait you will most certainly find a wait to get a parking spot!"}
{"text":"Food is regular bar food nothing spectacular owner needs to manage the quality control. I think it fits with the rest of Phoenix as a Food and Sports Bar. If you want upbeat bar scene with good choice of beer it's a great place with average food you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Cold beers and cheese burgers is one of the best restaurant in Gilbert. The service is always great, the food is always fresh. Our server Shelby was very friendly and attentive. I usually have a burger, tonight I switched it up and had a salad. The portion was huge and our wings were hot. Someone constantly checked on us to see if we needed anything else. It makes it easy to come back."}
{"text":"Way too overpriced! Food is below average, burger had to be sent back 3 times, and they still did not offer to take it off the bill.  Food is served cold, the place is understaffed, the chips are too salty, and must pay for fries!  Think I will stick to Blue 32!  Blue 32 serves decent priced bar food, and hot food at that.  Blue 32 has better service and prices also.  Too bad this new bar cannot get it together! Cute bar, but too expensive, cannot cook, and is too understaffed!  The girls at the front desk are rude, and what kind of bar is not self seating?!  The girls at the front stop everyone that walks in and makes them wait to be seated!  Never been to a bar where one cannot seat themselves. Courtney is rude, she rolls her eyes, talks poorly about other staff members, is a busy body, and is not a good fit!"}
{"text":"Good local burger place. Burgers tend to be under cooked so order well done and it should come out medium. Wish you could order the queso that comes with pretzel with Tortilla chips as it's awesome."}
{"text":"Recently stopped at cold beer and cheeseburgers, thought I would try one of their sandwiches, the atmosphere was nice the service was good and the burger ,I'd give it a 8 out of 10. I did find it it was a little pricey for this type of establishment. But all in all if you're looking for a good place to eat ,good food ,good service, give it a try !"}
{"text":"The name speaks for itself that they are known for the cold beer and burgers. Coors light I got came out as cold as it gets before it was frozen, which is always a good start. You can build your own burger and they have a wide range of different add on's. I'd avoid the gluten free bun because it falls apart easily but the second time I went I tried the pretzel bun and it was phenomenal. Different variety of sides you can choose from fries, to salad, to mac n cheese etc. Definitely a great spot to watch games if your a sports fan. Loved the experience overall."}
{"text":"Angus beef burger w/gruyere and caramelized onions. Better than your average burger!

The turkey burger, just plain was even more flavorful.

Mac and cheese, let's just say AMAZING.

Service Hmmm, how do you say \"SLOW for no apparent reason,\" nicely? 

Anywho, was lunch for three worth $69 bucks, not sure. Perhaps if my glass of iced tea was kept full without asking!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here yesterday and am SOLD! Had the Rocky Pt burger and it was all that I hoped it would be and more. Love the fact that they serve their burgers w/a huge steak knife impaled in your burger. Nice touch. Fries were fat and mealy - very filling. They did get the wrong burger out to me, but did make up for it by correcting it quickly (ordered mine rare).

Also tried 2 of their Bloody Mary's and they def served as my \"hair of the dog\" and chased my headache away nicely.

I wld like to try the Old Town location though. The one in N. Scottsdale/Phx is a bit tame, but that's okay as I wanted to visit w/my friends. 

Sit on the patio - good for ppl watching and you can still see the football games on. :)"}
{"text":"Perfect sports bar! T.V's everywhere, great draft and bottled beer selection! The menus has something for everyone. Nice to have a good sports bar walking distance from home! They have a good happy hour and I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Have since gone back for Happy Hour a few times and was quite satisfied with the food and pricing.  We always sit at the bar and everytime it's taken the bartender a few minutes to acknowledge us but once they did it was great the rest of the visits.  We will continue HH visits."}
{"text":"Dustin and his staff were so sweet to my dog Louie and I! I'm an Air Force veteran and i felt right at home at this delicious restaurant! I love the atmosphere and hospitality. I love the s'mores outside on the patio and the endless beer!!"}
{"text":"Great food average service... the black bean burger was amazing! Great drinks. Everyone was satisfied with their food.. we had a nice time. A lot of Tv's good looking clean place."}
{"text":"Cool place with great food! Rachel at the bar was amazing and makes one of the best micheladas I've ever had  I'll definitely be returning!!"}
{"text":"Believe all the reviews about slow and terrible service. A buddy and I went here for lunch with a little over 2 hours before a golf tee time at a course right down the street from here. Sat at the bar and our drink order was taken right away, good start. We ordered food about 5 minutes into the visit. We then proceeded to watch about half the people around us get the wrong food delivered the them. So it was no surprise that about an hour after we ordered food it was brought to the wrong people. My burger was dropped in the trash and my buddies was fondled heavily by the man they brought it to before he corrected the bar tender it was not his burger. Pretending nothing happened the bar tender gives the burger to my friend and says absolutely nothing about why my burger is not there other than \"yours will be out soon\" (soon? As in another hour??). 
The manager was apologetic about the wait and the poor service with my buddy getting a burger with another patrons finger and thumb marks all over the bun and gave us each a $5 gift card. While I have not been back since I feel an hour wait for a burger is just too long, my buddy has been back 3 more times. The next 2 times were the exact same story, he waited an hour the first time back and had to leave before his food was ready. His 2nd time back he waited only 45 minutes but then his food went to the wrong person again, they got their hands all over it and sent it back. His 3rd time back after our visit it was a 45 minute wait and this time he got the food he ordered without it passing through the hands of another patron. He says the food was good, but his favorite part was that he had accrued enough gift cards from his first 3 failed trips to cover his burger and 2 beers.
Tap list is good, I cant comment on food, and the reason for 2 stars instead of one is that the manager appears to take accountability for the service issues by apologizing, refunding you by way of gift cards.
This place is always packed so despite all the bad reviews I am interested in giving it another chance once it slows down a little bit. They must be doing something right"}
{"text":"Great place to to grab a burger and enjoy a cold one! Enjoyed the environment an vibe this place puts off. Will be returning soon!"}
{"text":"Our favorite burgers in Scottsdale.  Love the juicy lucy and all of the different mac & cheese options.  Servers are friendly but it is often quite busy.  Outdoor patio dining is fabulous in the winter months."}
{"text":"The buffalo wings were great - not very spicy but tasty. 
The turkey burger was overseasoned and salty - more like sausage than a turkey burger - and overpowered the flavor of all toppings.
We were one of the few people in the restaurant but our server was awful. She never came to our table and wasn't ever in the room. The rest of the servers also ignored us, I got up 3 times to get someone's attention (there was a group of 4 servers talking at the empty bar) and the 3rd time when the woman came by she apologized and said she didn't know where our server was. We didn't know either. 

Has to be better burgers somewhere."}
{"text":"Good food.  Apps (fire chips especially) and the burgers are amazing.  Coke hungry or plan to take second dinner home with you.  We finished up with S'mores at the table.   Make your own S'mores!!!!"}
{"text":"I've been here several times. Beer is cold. Food is great. My biggest complaint has been the service. Never has the service been even average. Until tonight...OMG. we actually got the normal bartender Dani as a server and holy shit!! This girl rocks it out!! Best service I've received not only here, but pretty much at any bar/restaurant in the Chandler area. Whatever Dani is getting paid she needs a raise because she's f'n awesome!!"}
{"text":"We have eaten here several times and the experience has been great - they have a good selection of burgers (you can get a grilled chicken breast instead).  They also have a good beer menu with rotating taps.  It is a bit loud but it is a great location to bring the kids."}
{"text":"We were seated quickly but Me and my girlfriend puked from the food, my burger smelled like chlorine, The tables were still sticky from the last people who used it, Our server barely payed attention to us, and we had to wait 25 minutes for a burger and a small bowl of Mac & cheese. Never eating there again"}
{"text":"This is great Alecia \"wants to make it right\" after my feedback.  LOL she is a robat same responses to others who have a bad meal here. Ms. Robat has NOT made it right nor responded to my private email.  Well sports fans, that sums it all up, and after being in the restaurant biz for 25 years, trust me you will get played here with the food and customer service."}
{"text":"It was \"fine\". The beer was cold, the food was hot. $40 for 2 beers and 2 burgers for lunch was a little much. We sat outside. Nice  patio. Our server was nice, but not super attentive. Will probably opt for trying another place next time- nothing to crave and it was as little far for us. Glad we tried it though."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place more stars as a go to Burger joint is much needed in the area. The ambiance here is awesome, lots of TVs and seating. The downside is that the Burgers are not amazing. Generally too big and messy to enjoy. Also have tried the chicken sandwich and sadly the same thing is true. The one thing I do love is the french fries. I'll have to come back to try the salads. Wish they could follow Hop Doddy's burger style..."}
{"text":"Zach is great..staff is fantastic..great food...good happy hr..nice outside area....loads of tvs for sports"}
{"text":"I checked Yelp says closes at midnight. Walked in at 11:11 pm. They tell me kitchen is closed after I drove 20 min to get there thinking the kitchen is still open because it says so on Yelp!!! Update your Yelp account to let people know kitchen closes at 11:00 pm !!!! Not cool!!! 
I was hungry not thirsty !!!"}
{"text":"Are you guys kidding me ?  What more could you ask for?  Best sports TVs in all of Arcadia.    Best cold beer selection.   The food was awesome. We had  burgers and sliders and the mozzarella sticks were amazing. And, the wings were the best. The service was great too. I just want to say that it seems some yelpers are biased for one reason or another, usually some small town mentality reason.  This place is way better than any dive bar spot in Arcadia"}
{"text":"Excellent food and really friendly staff. The patio seating was great and the heaters made it so comfortable. 
Had the club sandwich and it was amazing."}
{"text":"Have gone to a few other of their locations. This one has a little bit more of a local neighborhood feel. Great service, nice tv set up for games. Good food for a sports bar. Will definitely make it a regular go too..."}
{"text":"Not many healthy options, but dang sure some delicious burgers.  I always go around lunch time during the week so it's never busy."}
{"text":"Over rated and service sucks. Been a couple times and it's amazing how long everything takes. Presentation is good but just is not as good as it looks or sounds on the menu. Loud and not impressed. Went multiple times hoping because it was new things would change. Really needed a good place in our area but it's just mediocre"}
{"text":"Went at 4:30 and you could get a seat without wait, the pretzel appetizer was excellent, we did the salad as the side for the burger and the salad was also good. Definitely get there early as it can fill up fast after 5."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times now and I've LOVED the food, staff, atmosphere, and selection of beers. Their steakhouse burger is to die for and the s'mores dessert is delicious and so much fun for kids. Our server, Daniella, was very attentive and took great care of us. We'll definitely be back and will bring friends."}
{"text":"We went early on a Saturday evening. They were busy, but not packed- maybe 75% full. We asked the hostess who seated us for a baby sling which never came so I had to go up front and get it myself. Our server came over in a timely manner, however she never smiled, never welcomed us in, never asked if we had been in before, etc.  And when I say never smiled, I mean it.  She seemed very bitter at life.

As far as the food goes....eh.  I \"built my own\" burger which basically amounted to a bacon cheeseburger on a pretzel bun with fries and it was $18. The burger was ok, but overcooked. My wife and I both ordered our burgers medium and we got them at least medium well. The fries were fine.  Their beer selection is good.  I ordered one beer which was ok.

Would I go back? Probably not. We had three burgers (my BC burger, my son had a burger with absolutely nothing on it and my wife had a burger with a couple of toppings-- all with fries which are $2 extra each), one beer, no appetizers and no desert and it was almost $70 w/tip. The food was ok at best and the service, while prompt, was not friendly at all.  They do have a lot of TVs and a good beer selection so if I wanted to hang out with some friends to have a beer and watch a game, maybe I would stop in.  But there are a million places to get a decent burger in and around Gilbert so if I want to eat, I would go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Awesome spot, awesome burgers awesome beer slection and family friendly.... we love this place!"}
{"text":"Never been here before but decided to plan a surprise party for my husbands Birthday here.  About 15 of our friends came.  I reserved with the manager before the party and told him what I was planning and he was all on board.  Reserved a table and he said that he would make sure that everything would be great for our group.  The group arrived and my husband and I arrived about 15 mintues later.  About half of us ordered drinks and appetizers.    All of us were having a great time and visiting and chatting, no one was yelling or drunk.  Within 30 minutes the owner told us that we were being too loud and had to leave.  WHAT???  The last I checked, your building in no way had any signs on the outside that stated that everyone must whisper inside. Absolute craziness!!  Luckily we were able to call another business that reserved a table for us last minute and told us to come on over as they welcomed our business.  Ended up with better prices and BETTER food!!  If you plan on talking to a group of people while visiting this place, go elsewhere."}
{"text":"If you find yourself here you have to try the Sweet Potatoe Tots!!!   The Cheese Burgers are great too.  Nice place to watch NFL games."}
{"text":"Opening night....and you'd never know. Great service and it was packed. We're not usually sports bar types, but this place is pretty awesome. We shared the CB&CB burger with tots and a couple beers. The burger was perfect, tots were crispy and the beers were cold as advertised. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Every time I go here either the waitress sucks or the kitchen screws up my burger.  I don't love the burgers but they are not bad.  I just think if you are going to charge the prices over $10 it better be awesome.  
My girlfriend has gotten the wings a few times and I generally don't like wings but they do a good job.
I guess the 2 star really reflects the idea of a sports bar charging over $10 for cheese burger.  I know inflation and maybe I'm old school.  I just don't see the value in the quality or the taste.  And especially the lacking service.
The valet thing bothers me too. So I have to park and walk because valet but is holding all the spots.  This is not beverly hills I'm not parking valet to go to a strip mall to get a cheese burger and watch sports."}
{"text":"1. Pro- I love the tater tot nachos. If you need some carbs, look no further.

2. Pro- Burgers are big and messy just like they should be.

3. Con- I've eaten here about 20 times. They have gotten my order wrong 5 times. Also, burgers are consistently cooked less than I wanted. If I said \"medium\" it came rare. If I said \"medium well\" it came \"medium\". I'd hate to see what \"rare\" looks like."}
{"text":"Descent place.  The servers were friendly and the atmosphere was fun (NFL Sunday!). 

I had a chicken sandwich with chips and it was good.  The beer mugs are pretty small though but probably a good thing in the long run!

The only thing I didn't like seeing was an Ohio State flag on the wall.  I can only think of one thing that would of look worse than that on the wall, and that would be black mold(barely)!"}
{"text":"When this first opened the food was really good and the service was great  A friend of mine Brian was the manager and the place was awesome unfortunately it has gone downhill I do not frequent this bar any longer the last time I was there  I sat at the bar and ordered a turkey burger it took quite a while to come and did not have what I asked for on it the bartender  I will not mention his name but he acted  like he was doing me a favor I can only say he was more interested in talking about his motorcycle  and ordering parts for it from a man sitting at the bar  he then went on to talk about other personal things  and matters other than food to customers  and acted like it was an inconvenience serving people A friend of mine also told me he no longer goes in there because the bartender actually insulted him rather than take it up with the management he just left"}
{"text":"Okay, was hoping for a great experience, 1) burger was good and cooked as ordered, 2) not real fast from order to serve (2 burgers) - 20 mins NOT REAL BUSY ! 3) Believe I saw the manager at a couple table and walked by several times - no table interaction (well one table really had her attention). Three stars only because burger was good! Fries okay for frozen Kringle cut! Lots of tvs and lots of ways to get your beer fix! Would I try again - yes and hope for a little better experience!"}
{"text":"When I jumped on this restaurants page to drop a review I was extremely surprised that this place has only a 3 star rating! The beer selection is phenomenal which immediately makes it a hit in my book, and it has a TON of TV's that are playing the sports I like. It's always very clean and the service has been good every time we have eaten here. Being that it is essentially a sports bar, I was pretty sure my fiancee wouldn't be a fan. The food however, is enough for her to tolerate my beer guzzling and sports watching ways. We go on Wednesday's for dinner where they have a Build Your Own burger with unlimited toppings off the sheet. Hook that burger up! The parmesan fries are really good, so are the buffalo chicken egg rolls and the buffalo chicken nachos are a huge plate and are very good. We are fans of Cold Beer and Cheeseburgers."}
{"text":"Most of the taps are down so no draft beer and they over cook the the burgers. Not once but twice. They don't know what medium or medium rare is.  They do know well done.


Follow up. The manager and waitress did do good service recovery.  They took ownership did above and beyond what they needed to do for the situation."}
{"text":"We waited 20 minutes for someone to take our drink order then it was another 30 till we got them (not even water) then once we got them we had to ask them for menus? Then my mom got a cheeseburger way after we got our food and it was not cooked at all. Then the cherry on top was we had to send back the checks 3 times. It was messy."}
{"text":"Seriously their sanitary practices are the worst.  We sat by the bar and watched the game and regrettably we witness some truly disgusting sanitary habits by the wait staff and bartenders.  I snapped a photo of one of these gross habits where on virtually every beer they put the order receipt literally in your beer.  I thought it was a accident but when you watch, over and over, the bartenders press their finger and the receipt into your beer.

What I didn't see ... them washing their hands."}
{"text":"I've drank here before and, don't get me wrong, I did again.  But I also ate this go around.  I had a burger and was very pleased.  It was a good size, had a good bun, had nice toppings and tasted great.  The chips were also very good.

On the beverage side we had a bucket of beer special that was $1 off each which is a great deal for it being a Saturday night.  

If the parking wasn't such a nightmare here it'd be even better but overall I enjoy it quite a bit."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to watch the Cardinals game last evening at Cold Beer and Cheeseburgers. We had the pleasure of having Danni as our server. My husband is a huge beer lover and Danni knew her beers! She suggest one that he loves and will probably be ordering in the future. The food was great! And the service was so refreshing. Thanks to Danni!"}
{"text":"I'm sorry, I can't bring myself to give more than 1 star.  From first walking in the door, to paying the bill - BAD BAD BAD.  They tried to sit us on the patio directly in the sun; when we got a table we had to ask for someone to wait on us.  The food took forever - it seemed as though they had more girls standing at the hostess stand than servers.  The food was not the worst, but would not rave about any of it.  I had to send my burger back because it was overlooked, and when I got the new one it was pretty much the same... they may need to learn the different temperatures to cook meat.. not sure, buy my medium was the same as my Dad's well done. The meat had no flavor and had to actually check to see if the blue cheese was on my burger, because I couldn't taste it.  I will for sure never go back to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Greeted as soon as we entered and headed for the bar.  4 for the bar space,  selection of beers,  and overall appeal.  3 for food. We had chicken Monterey and cordon bleu. Chicken was just okay, not great. None of the bar staff introduced themselves, which is a pet peeve of mine. Very nice young ladies but not over-the-top in customer service.  This is the hospitality industry, and we enjoy interacting with bar staff and talking about beers.  Yep, we're beer snobs and need to sample a few before spending $7.50.  Just didn't know to whom we were talking.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"I live across the street and saw this place being built. I went in a few nights ago with my mom. I was surprised to see it was a sports bar, not what I was expecting but that's not a bad thing. I had a BYOB (build your own burger) and it was good. Good quality meat. I was skeptical to get the chips because usually homemade chips aren't good, especially made by a restaurant, but to my surprise I loved the chips! It was a little pricey for a burger though, $14! I would come again but maybe for happy hour."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time two weeks ago with some friends for Saturday lunch. Their beer list has a great variety for all of us that have different tastes in local and imported beers. Sadly they were out of Not Your Father's Root Beer (but who isn't?). They even had a deal for buying a bucket of beers. We all did the build your own burger, which had plenty of options. Fries and sweet potato tots were both well-seasoned and tasty. Burgers were really good as well, but maybe just a tad pinker than I usually like. I will just go medium well next time. I definitely plan to return."}
{"text":"So me and my buddy get here about 9 pm. A couple people at the bar. The bartender Ashley is talking up a storm with certain people besides us. Keep in kind people coming and going. But she gravitates to certain individuals with or shes on her cell phone. Definitely been to hole in the walls with better customer service. This place is already expensive, small crowd, good food but will definitely not be back. This place was awesome when it used to be \"Tailgators\". Bartenders were better."}
{"text":"I was apprehensive of trying this place due to all the poor reviews. However, we were in the neighborhood and I was craving a cold beer and a (veggie) cheeseburger. 

We came on a Wednesday night. They had a build-your-own special that night for $11. This is a great deal! I mean, it can get a bit out of control. I wanted to try the mac and cheese but I really wanted a veggie burger. I wasn't going to order both. Soooo guess what I did? I ordered it as one of my toppings! Yes, mac and cheese is an optional topping for the burgers! I loaded up on other good stuff too. Avocado, green chilis, sauteed mushrooms, and a side of tots. Hubby ordered his medium rare burger with lots of goodies too, side of fries.

So of course, my burger was a mess when it came out. That is my own damn fault! A delicious, indulgent mess. I ate the mac and cheese out of it. It was delicious and I noted to myself that I need to come back for build your own mac night. I happily used a fork for the rest of my delicious mess. Their handmade veggie patty was great! And the tots were perfect. Piping hot and well seasoned.

My hubby was pleased his burger was perfectly cooked. He enjoyed his food as much as I did.

The service was great. Absolutely no complaints there. Super friendly. We will be back!"}
{"text":"The food was great, our waitress was absolutely awful. My mother and stepdad were in town and I love the food here, so I wanted to share the experience with them. After we were done we went outside and we're talking in front of the restaurant. Our waitress came out a bit later and asked \"did you mean to not tip me?\" All of us had, so my girlfriend went inside to find out if someone had stolen our cash tip from the table. Come to find out she just felt that we hadn't tipped her ENOUGH. After that I went inside and talked to the manager. He said that it was unacceptable. I said at this point i want my whole tip back. He said he would refund the whole check, but now that I think about it we had it broken up into 4, two of which were paid in cash so who knows if that will actually happen."}
{"text":"Came in on a very slow night, service and food were just okay! Got the Mac and cheese burger was too much bun and the patty was pretty dry."}
{"text":"Whoa! Food poisoning, my husband and I both.  And we each had different items except we each had burgers.  Mine hit me as soon as I got home.  The day after I still feel horrible and left work early.  If I could give it zero stars I would.  Their menus are sticky and gross as well."}
{"text":"Sad right?!?! BLD was awesome and they are right next door. 
Cold Beers had a valet service set up but everything said do not enter, the valet was too busy on his phone to park anyone, the hostess sat us without menus and told us she'd bring us some but never did so we had to ask a food runner, the server was so slammed that she wouldn't even take the time to finish what she was saying before she walked away from her tables, I was grossed out by the fact that not one single server or food runner had their hair restrained, the mac and cheese was soggy and tasted like Velveeta, and the burger was dry, even after it slowed down the server was providing drive by service rather than stopping to provide service. The best part of my overpriced meal was the fries. I would have complained to the restaurant but when you can't get anyone to actually pause for 60 seconds at your table, what's the use?"}
{"text":"Was told it would be a 20 minute wait, when we received the text message that our table was ready, they told us to wait another moment. 5 minutes later, they gave away our table with barely an apology. After another 15 minutes, they finally seated us and offered no further apology or discount. Our server wasn't friendly. They did a poor job of updating the TVs with the current football games- we politely asked a few times, and each time we received a rude short answer of \"they're working on it.\" Well over a half hour post start time, they put the game on the TV. The food was fine and came out relatively quickly, and the mimosa special of $10 for the first one, and $1 for refills was great. But it was clear the servers were disappointed and took their time bringing the cheap refills out."}
{"text":"I've been driving by this burger joint and it was always packed,  just finished our first (and last visit). Waaay overpriced very average burger, I had the Juicy Lucy my wife had the All 
-American. Both burgers had stale buns, a big no-no for me,  it's the cheapest component the the burger and when it's  stale the burger is ruined, I can get a burger with a stale bun for $1.00, @ McDonald's. our tab for 2 huggers Ann's 2 beers with a tip $50.00! My wife liked the fresh potato chips so I'll add one more star. If you want an outstanding gourmet menu with amazing burgers and craft beers go to Dubina's on 67th & Bell...5 stars! http://www.dubinabrewing.com/"}
{"text":"Are you kidding me?? First day of fantasy football and no wifi and one TV is broken. Way to prepare."}
{"text":"A bit on the expensive side, but I do like their burgers...burgers run around $13-$15, and expect an up charge of $2 if you decide you would like something other than chips. A mug of beer was $7.50, but they do have a great selection. Staff was polite and my kids love all of the TV."}
{"text":"Same as any CBCB, except we had a very poor experience during weekly trivia.

It's well known there are no phones during trivia. Our team had their answer written down and paper in the air to have the MC pick up. I opened my messaging app to answer a friend (who was meeting us), the manager came by and aggressively said 'Don't use your phone, I ain't paying a winner who is on their phone.' 

Overall, it was very embarrassing and totally uncalled for. Regardless of what he 'thought' we were doing, his approach was tacky."}
{"text":"If it wasn't overpriced, I would be less critical, but....... my $9 CB Margarita was just lame,watery. Burger toppings were tasty. House made chips were bland. Not really a $14 burger and chip experience. Very average, expensive sports bar like place. Meh."}
{"text":"Walked in and was greeted by a waitress and after being seated for like 25 minutes, the waitress did not even bother coming by to finally take our order until i called her over filling in another guests order! The food was great and the place was really appealing, but the service is just horrendous! Still debating if i should come back here again... EDIT: Thanks Alecia, judging by multiple reviews stating the service, hopefully you'll tell them this time lol"}
{"text":"Wife and I went here with friends to watch some sports and have good food/service. We were severely disappointed in service and food. 
Service- the server was awful, had no personality, never told us her name, walked past us many times and if we asked her for help she either ignored us or did the eye roll. Well I can tell you that she didn't get a good tip. Saw a couple of managers and they didn't even look at tables or say hi. I wasn't asking for a 10 minute conversation but just a hi and ask how things were. Nada nothing 
Food- overpriced and really nothing much to say. It took forever to come out. 30 minutes for appetizer ( mozzarella sticks, wings and a pretzel) and then 45 minutes for 2 burgers to be delivered. Food was blah tasting
Drinks- way overpriced compared to other bars, and again the server ignored us or she would have padded the ticket had she just asked. The drinks we did get were beer, and Bacardi rum, gummy bear shots, and a skull crusher. Watered down drinks and again not worth the price
Overall I would say this was our experience and it just didn't hold up to a bill that was over $150.00 for the 6 of us. Maybe it was a bad night but we will probably not go back"}
{"text":"For me, what gets me excited to go to this place is their loaded tots. Highly recommended! It is a large portion, though. Four of us share each time, and it's a healthy portion for each. I also do their veggie burger, which is good, along with their fries."}
{"text":"Great service, a thousand TVs, hard rock blasting but not so loud you can't converse, good lighting...this restaurant has a properly trashy atmosphere and it's AWESOME.

But truly, the food earns this place it's five stars.

It's pretty much all junk food. Don't come here for a salad, there aren't any on the menu. But seriously: Mac & cheese for adults, charbroiled hot dogs, and the real treat: buffalo chicken toy chos (which are nachos with tater tots instead of chips). This menu is sheer bliss, and a rock and roll rocket over my tongue.

Bonus: stellar beer menu, including a can of Old Style for only $3.

Well done, Chandler, Arizona. Well done."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to a cold beer and cheeseburger but I must have not have been approachable since the bar tender ignored me for the entire 15 minutes that I sat. She passed me served everyone around me but never even asked. I walked out. I guess this place won't be a favorite after all. Service is half the experience and if you can't offer good service the food won't taste as good."}
{"text":"Nice concept but service was very slow. Waite staff was more concerned with their cell phones than their customers. Ordered a \"build your own\" burger and it came out wrong but gave up on trying to correct it because again staff was focused on their phones not their customers! Probably will never return and defiantly will not recommend to friends."}
{"text":"I don't Yelp a lot, but I have to give a thank you shout out to the crew at Cold Beer and Cheeseburgers. Went there to watch the Final Four and they were packed. I was lucky that there isn't a bad seat in he house due to the fact that they seem to have one TV for every third patron. Anyway, they were swamped at the bar, but my glass was always full and everything, including my amazing prime rib sliders (watch out for the horseradish, it's hot) was served with a smile. I'll be back for sure. Hope they broadcast UFC."}
{"text":"Just down the street from our house, we were of course fascinated by the name and Yelp said it was good. The interestingly named Cinnamon Smith was our personable waitress and did a good job and did not live up to her stripper name!  So we decided to do beer flights of their local brews and to pimp our burgers.  My wife chose the lite flight, which consisted of Abita Purple Haze, Goose Island 312, Four Peaks Sunburn and Coronado Orange Wit.  I chose as always the local flight, which included Four Peaks Hop Not, Sleepy Dog Red Rover, San Tan Devils Ale and the best of all, Sonoran white chocolate ale (Yummmm!). For my burger I chose the Angus burger on an artisan roll, with all of my favorites, bleu cheese crumbles, bacon, jalape√±os and barbecue sauce, accompanied by the most delicious sweet tater tots I had ever tasted.  My wife as always went the healthier route with a turkey burger with no bun, with guacamole, grilled Anaheim peppers, 
Saut√©ed onions, tomato, lettuce, grilled chiles, mushrooms and Gruyere cheese, accompanied by her favorite, onion rings.  Lots of TVs all around and an extensive menu means we will be back!"}
{"text":"Popped into Cold Beers & Cheeseburgers since they just recently opened, and I have to say that I was rather impressed with their service!!  Usually when a restaurant just opens there are some kinks to work out in the service department, but everything ran like a well-oiled machine here.  Our server was very attentive, and the manager even popped by twice to be sure everything was in order.  We felt very well taken care of the whole night :)

The restaurant itself is very clean and spacious. There are also an insane amount of TV's everywhere, so this is definitely going to be a hot spot to watch some football, basketball.....they had it all!

And to top it off, the food itself was pretty darn good!!  I had the Steakhouse Truffle burger (gruyere cheese, bacon, garlic aioli, oh my!) which was awesome, and my boyfriend had the Hangover burger (jack cheese, bacon and egg) which was good, but nowhere near as good as mine.  We also had a side of tots which were decent and a side of coleslaw which was also good. The only thing I didn't like was the ranch sauce that I asked for with the tots. Pretty sure it's something pre-made from a bottle and not fresh, so I say skip the ranch and try a different sauce instead.

**Side note: they have daily specials, so be on the lookout for those! We went on a Tuesday night, so indulged in the $3 beer cans, and 1/2 off bottles of wine all night long. Having those options were glorious!**

If you like burgers, sports and beer, then definitely come and check this place out!!"}
{"text":"Let's start by saying this place is awesome!!! Great set up, cool outdoor \"open to the bar\" patio, tons of tv's, nice decor!!! OK - this stuff doesn't come cheap! Burgers are pricey - Beers are pricey. Me & My Wife had: (2) Cheesburgers at $13 each, $4 extra if you want frys (ridiculous), (2) Beers each - $52 + Tip. I mean jeeez; I could of had a nice sit down pork chop or steak dinner with sides at Texas Roadhouse or Black Angus for that $$$$$$. By all means I'm not a cheap skate BUT that's my opinion. It's a BAR & understand that this IS BAR FOOD. Also CBCB anywhere is packed so expect long waits on EVERYTHING. We went on a Monday @ 12:30pm and we WAITED 15 mins for our beer and finished that - ordered 2nd round 1/2 gone with that and food came......$60 Later OUCH"}
{"text":"I've been here 4 times.  I've had Juicy Lucy twice, 1000 Islands, & Speedy Gonzalez.

The service is really spotty, when its good its real good and when its bad, its among the worst.

The really bad service makes for the loss of one star - that is how over the top good the kitchen/grill is.  I've had a million good burgers - these are the best.  Not just the great menu combinations but the perfect cook.  I plan on making my way through the entire burger list.

If you go for just a beer and apps - try the \"Totcho's\"  Tater tots done up as nacho's - not bad at all.  Also, their onion rings are addictive."}
{"text":"Good burger, not great. Sat at the bar for too long waiting to be served initially and for a second beer. And what's up with the gaggle of teenage hostesses at the front door?!?  Way more interested in their own chit chat than customers."}
{"text":"Deeeelicious! We were newbies and we weren't disappointed!  We started with the buffalo chicken tots and couldn't stop eating them. Nice and spicy! I ordered the Rocky Point burger medium.. it was perfectly cooked to order!  The home made chips were amazing as well! The Bloody Mary I ordered was ok.. service was great"}
{"text":"Excellent food, excellent service. The Busser even took away our dirty appetizer plates before our meal came."}
{"text":"I liked this place , didn't try any of the beers on tap , but I will say the Juicy Lucy Burger and the fries were pretty pretty PHAT , like juicy is a great name for that burger . 
Cost : Juicy Lucy + All America Burger + Beer + Tip runs you about 40 dollars if you are good tipper , if not about 30 dollars . 
All Burgers , cost around 11 to 15 and a 18 burger is on the list which is monster. 
Chips are the standard side, so if you want fries or totes it will cost an extra 2 dollars onto your burger .

The servicers if you get a lady are pretty and polite. When our order came in , they got one of our sides wrong, but they corrected it and gave us a full order to go no charge . So thank you. 

The food is good for a good ole burger done however you prefer and it seems like a good place to watch a game and they do ufc fights also so bonus . 

Great place"}
{"text":"Cold beers has always been a great restaurant, and the new location on 7th street is killer. Great staff, amazing atmosphere and of course, great burgers. I've had Sierra as my server on multiple occasions and she is part of the reason I go back so often, knew everything about the menu and truly cares about her tables / customers. She's going places in life and I highly recommend sitting in her section while at this location. Thank you always Cold Beers , and Sierra :)"}
{"text":"Had a taste for a burger, but now I recall why we have not returned here for a while. Food was good, but service not so good.  Had to wait at least 5 minutes before someone greeted us at the hostess station. There was not even a \"hello, someone will be right with you. \" The server did not check in with us either after we placed our order or after the food arrived and the food took a long time.  We will not be returning. I do not usually write restaurant reviews, but was so displeased with the service."}
{"text":"My sister and I decided to try Cold Beers & Cheeseburgers for lunch on Saturday.  We sat outside on the patio and the atmosphere outside the restaurant was enjoyable.  Unfortunately our experience turned awful. I ordered the Prime Rib Sliders for $12.00, which only includes the sliders, if you want fries or salad add an additional $5.00. Ok, so I ordered the salad also and a beer.  My sister and I waited and waited, finally I asked another waitress walking by, where was the beer we ordered.  The waitress went back inside and brought out our beer.  Well, I took a sip and it was lukewarm beer and was not even cold.  My sister complained and they brought her another beer which was chilled.  I did not want to make a fuss and drank my warm beer.  Then comes the food.  I had 3 biscuit size rolls with meat stuff inside for the Prime Rib Sliders; I thought, \"Geeze I spent $12.00  for this! My sister and I both ordered salads, which never came.  I told the waitress when she finally came over to cancel the salads because we did not receive them.  I took a few bites out of the sandwich and couldn't even chew the meat; it was fatty grizzle. I spit out onto my napkin.  My sister noticed something in my dish and told me I had a hair in my food. I proceed to pull out a long brown hair in the sandwich.  Ok, that was it for me! I called over the waitress and told her I can not eat this food and to take it back.  I advised I do not want to pay for this dish.  The waitress stated she would get the manager over, well we sat and waited, however no manager ever showed to our table.  The waitress very rudely puts down the bill and they had deducted the Prime Rib Slider as requested.  I paid for my beer and left... I will never ever return to that place.  The service was awful; the food terrible!! In addition, the staff is unfriendly, rude, and worst customer service skills I have ever encountered.  Boy do I miss Uncle Bears!!! I will travel to one off Ray Rd to enjoy a COLD beer and GOOD food.  This restaurant will not last long as I see others have had similar experiences..."}
{"text":"Ordered Monterrey Chicken and tots, bread was stale, chicken was dry and bacon tasted like it's been cooked and sitting for a while. For the price of this place not worth it at all. Service was good but food quality not up to par."}
{"text":"Would say 2 1/2 stars.  I will update after they have been open longer.

We have been to the one in Old Town and have had terrible service every time.  Hoping this would be different.....umm,  maybe only slightly better.

Told a 15 min. wait by the hostess so we headed to the bar to order a beer.  It took another gentleman at the bar flagging down a bartender after a 10 minute wait for us to get served, which is exactly what we have experienced at the other location.

Seated 10 mins. later and our waitress was attentive.  Ordered my burger medium and it came out medium rare, and husband ordered medium
Rare and got medium.  We picked at it vs. sending back.

I think they have some kinks to work out and am confident they will.  I applaud them for putting one out here and hope they realize the clientele is not Old Town but is instead NoPo/Glendale with families who tip well, aren't drunk aholes, and will become regulars if they get it right."}
{"text":"I love that I found a place that has a bazillion TV's so from that perspective it is a great spot to catch a game but from there we went downhill.  We ordered the Original Tot-Chos and while the idea is good the execution was poor.  There are just gobs of toppers and they didn't really go together, it just felt like lack luster and without a true theme.  We then received our burgers: Bacon PB&J and the Ring of Fire.  My husband said that the Ring of Fire was good but tasted exactly like the BBQ burger at Burger King.  The PB&J was once again a good idea but fell short.  There was too much peanut beer and too much jelly and it took over the entire taste of the burger.  We left full but were completely unsatisfied. The prices just weren't worth the flavors.  We can find better executed food elsewhere."}
{"text":"I schlepped way up north to go here and it's pretty good.  The sweet potato tots are outstanding and they do have a great beer selection. the burgers are huge and I coould only eat half.  I got the truffle burger but tasted absolutely no truffle at all.  However it was a good burger, I just wanted to taste some truffles.  I'd go again when they open in Old Town."}
{"text":"I just want to thank Cold Beer and Cheeseburgers for taking the time to make such a fantastic veggie burger. Most restaurants like this just throw some terrible frozen POS that taste like cardboard on a bun and serve it up. To my delight this place makes a great non-meat patty in house that actually provides the experience of eating a big greasy burger. Yes, it's true that just because someone doesn't eat meat that they don't ever want the joy of eating some unhealthy grease bomb and washing it down with a few cold pints. 

So thanks again Cold Beer and Cheeseburgers!  I will absolutely be back for another one of those veggie burgers."}
{"text":"Slow server who was in training but clearly did not want to be there. Burgers were just okay this time, which is odd for CB & C. Usually everything is to die for. Well, hoping the kinks will be worked out and this location will get better with time."}
{"text":"First time here. When we arrived we were both hesitant, because it looked like a typical bar and bar food is ...well, not easy on the 'ole stomach. 
We went in, were seated immediately, ordered drinks and the truffle garlic fries (OMG, yum!). My husband ordered a BYOB (Build your own burger) with onion rings and I ordered the pastrami burger with coleslaw. We both agreed that this was one of the juiciest, tastiest burgers that we had ever eaten. The coleslaw was delicious and the onion rings had that fantastic panko-ey crunch.
Portions are huge, so bring a hearty appetite!"}
{"text":"So my wife and I stopped by for a late dinner. It wasnt busy in the resturaunt or bar yet it was still noisy. Odd. Our server was adequate and made frequent visits. The burger took a while and I imagine it's because I ordered everything including the kitchen sink on my burger:  i.e. 1/2 lb angus beef with saut√©ed onions, peppers, mushrooms; pickles, lettuce, jalape√±os, onions, tomatoes, bacon, pineapple, fried egg, cheeses: cheddar, provolone, jack, Gruyere, and Swiss; bbq sauce on an artisan bun. My wife played it smart and ordered a few items on her burger. She subbed in fries instead of homemade chips for a couple of $$. 
Overall, the meal was rather ordinary, my burger as well. I would rate it 2.5 out of 5 stars. My wife's burger bun ripped at first bite and the tangy chipotle sauce was more like bbq sauce. It seems like a glorified sports bar that charges more $$$ for their food. 
Fortunately, I already have one of those that I like. 

Tip:  Wednesday's are Create your own burger night with any/all toppings for $12."}
{"text":"Grandma loves the sliders and French fries. She was full after 1. Great food!  And great service. My husband loves this place too. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Great work from the kitchen, but EPIC FAIL by front of house... If only that great food hadn't died on the pass! (6-8 minutes waiting!!) Beer arrived \"cool\" and FLAT. (how long had IT been sitting there?!) Goddamit!

[It looks like yelpers Zachary V. and Dan P. got it right before me. Poor service since at least a few months ago!]

The FRENCH ONION BURGER was well-conceived and the ingredients were great!
--perfectly-cooked medium-rare burger
--gruyere on top. great choice, perfect flavor, but already hardening and cold
--grilled onions were juicy and not too salty
--even the bun was buttery and delicious
--tater-tots perfectly cooked
### Too bad it all arrived lukewarm and DEAD.

You know (or perhaps you don't) what \"dead\" food tastes like. If you don't know what that means, think \"taking home a to-go bucket of fried chicken with a side bucket of french fries\". When you arrive home, it's just faded! The fried chicken may still be kind of crispy and slightly warm and the fries may be tasty, but they've lost their life. They're DEAD! You go (or you should be going) to a restaurant to taste well-prepared food, from fresh, high-quality ingredients, presented just moments after cooking.

Here's the timeline:
# arrived, patio table filthy from previous diners. Where's the support staff? (nowhere)
# host didn't even notice how dirty our table was and take action to clean it
# nor did our server when she arrived to ask us if we wanted waters. I had to ask her for a towel to clean it up. Oh, was this supposed to be a sawdust-bar?
# +12 first service (to take drink orders) 12 minutes.
# +19 minutes orders taken
## +22 minutes beer arrives. For a place called \"cold beer\" and cheeseburgers, I want to be *drinking* a draught beer no more than 6 minutes after I sit down.
### the beer is FLAT and \"cool\". At +22 minutes, I was going to drink it anyway. goddamit! I am so mad at you right now!
+35 minutes, the table next to us, having arrived after us, receives part of their order (2 plates) before us
+43 minutes, the table next to us receives their other 2 mains.
## +45 minutes, our food arrives, DEAD
+50 minutes, i sent it back saying I don't have time now to wait another 20 minutes for more food.
+55 minutes my colleagues sitting at a nearby table get their food, having arrived a few minutes after we did
# +75 minutes, i have to flag down another server to get our check

Other suggestions:
* Redesign your menus. Beer and Alcohol menu reads like an index card i'm using as a cheat-sheet for a lecture.
* As you present the regular menu, explain it to me. Tell me that the apps and features are on the front, and the Burgers (!) are on the back. Talk to me about it, and get me excited for what i'm about to eat. Don't just drop me and run.
* it's *&@#$'n October in Phoenix. The weather is fantastic. You gotta know that folks are going to want to find a place to sit and have a great lunch (beer and a burger) on a great patio. How can you not properly staff for a mildly busy lunch service?!
* where are the busers, runners and support staff? (read: nowhere!) Offload some of this work from the servers to let them do their jobs properly.


Note: there may be a problem with my phone, but when I went to check in here and my GPS put me ON TOP OF the restaurant, it fell to 24th on the list of \"nearby restaurants\". :/"}
{"text":"Love the patio at the Arcadia location. Televisions everywhere with all kinds of sports! Great service too!
The Home Run Margarita is a great combination of sweet, salty and spicy with the Chile salt rim.
DEFINITELY order the Parmesan Truffle fries to start. They take them VERY seriously! 
I really wanted to create my own burger, so I ordered pastrami, provolone and fried egg on a pretzel bun. DELICIOUS!!!!
I went again about a week later to the North Scottsdale location. I felt like all the great additions on my burger took away from the flavor of the meat. This time I just ordered the American. A simple burger with the bare minimum trimmings. 
The patty was REALLY thick, and on BOTH visits, was cooked to medium perfection.  And I was right. The meat alone was delicious and should be appreciated on its own.
Burgers are also BIG, so go hungry or order a couple and share with each other."}
{"text":"Despite living within walking distance and enjoying the food, nearly every time we have chosen to eat here it has been met with disappointment. We chose tonight because it was close and while it is during the D-Backs' playoff game, the service left loads to be desired.

We waited a good 10 minutes before the waitress came to our table to get our drink order. It took at least another 10 minutes just to get an iced tea and a glass of water. Had we been drinking beers or cocktails, perhaps the service would have been more promt? Guess we won't know since it'll be a LONG time before we try again, if we return at all.

Since it's busy, the food took a while. Fine. No issue there. Once the food got dropped off, our waitress pulled a straight David Copperfield and *poof!*... she vanished. She never returned to our table once to check on us. That's utterly ridiculous as we've been to busier places and had better attention. 

When she finally reappeared and noticed both the irritated look on my face and the empty plate that had been sitting there at the end of the table for at least 20 minutes, she FINALLY came to ask if we were done. I asked for a to-go box and a refill of my drink. I got the box but not the drink even though she came out twice more to give refills to the family of three across from us. With my cup clearly empty and at the edge of the table and with a similar look to before, she still didn't get that I wanted another drink.

So, given the lackluster service, she got tipped accordingly. She's lucky I left anything at all, to be honest. I genuinely hope that the management reads and takes action with reviews because this kind of service isn't acceptable.


*edit* So I've seen the same canned reply from management in several posts. It's so nice that they are taking the time to personalize their responses to what seem to be a host of issues despite repeated promises to fix them."}
{"text":"It wasn't awful, but certainly can find better burgers for cheaper. Order 1 or 2 temperatures below was you want, since they seem to overcook. Actually, I'm not sure they really have a lower temp than well-done. $13 for a burger that just comes with chips seems a little pricey. The party doesn't even fill the bun, so there's that. Still filling with decent flavor, but needs to be more well rounded for more than 3 stars."}
{"text":"First time at cold beers and it was amazing. I sat at the bar and was served by Dani, it was super busy but she was attentive and kind! She kept my drinks full and was even able to fill them before I asked. The food and environment matched her excellent service. I will absolutely be back! Thanks Dani, and cold beers and cheeseburgers!"}

{"text":"The burgers are amazing. I want to stop there but Yelp keeps making me write more than 4 words.  Good meat quality, really good! Great portions and very reasonable prices."}
{"text":"I'd like to say my experience today wasn't as good as my previous review. Food is still good , plenty of TV's, waitress was decent. However, my friend ordered off the kids menu (she asked, they obliged), and she said \"I'd like my drink to be an iced tea\" the waitress brought over a large cup of iced tea. We received our bill and they charged my friend for the large tea. We brought it to the waitresses attention, she was very obviously irritated, and a guy came over to our table, my assumption was he was the manager. He didn't introduce himself, or state is role, but when on to say \"if you order off the kids menu, you get a kids drink, not a regular sized drink\" my friend was nice and said Ok. He then went on to say \"next time you'll have to ask or clarify with your server\"

So, my issue is this, the waitress should have said \"did you want to kids size or regular size\" or she could have said \"that will be an extra charge for the larger size\" I'm of the opinion that it's the server's responsibility to know their job, and it's the manager's responsibility to train them in this area. Therefore, because of lack of training, and poor communication I will not return to this location. There are plenty of other restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"After a few return trips, Cold Beers & Cheesburgers really started to grow on me.  I tried more of its burgers, beers, and sides, and I really started to enjoy what CB & CB has to offer.  But, when I ate there last week, everything went down when I picked up the menu.

The prices have been jacked up.  And not only is it more expensive in general, but there is now an up charge for sides other than chips and fries.  Part of what made CB & CB stick out from countless amount of burger joints in the valley was all the side options.  Now, the meal that cost about $10 or $11 a month ago, is around $12 to $15.   The happy hour and daily specials are also not what they used to be.

So to sum it up.  The food is good, but worth the price.  The good news is that CB & CB is still on local dines (http://www.localdines.com/phoenix?ref=19485).  You're now really going to want to use the $30 for $15 gift certificate so you don't feel overcharged."}
{"text":"Came in to get a quick bite to eat, but based on the customer service and service from my server(woman server in her 30's with a bun in her hair); I will not be coming back here ever again. I asked for some crackers or bread for my one year old son, and my server seemed annoyed by me asking. I also asked for a quick run-down of the beers on tap, and she quickly answered they are on the menu. I asked this question, because sometimes seasonal beers are not listed on beer list. This server was not only unwelcoming but rude; I understand people have bad days, but when you work in the service industry, you need have your game face on at all times. She also didn't offer if I would like some water for a good 10 minutes. Terrible, terrible service. I will make sure to let everyone I know not to ever eat here."}
{"text":"Great burgers, cold beers! Awesome staff! Cool environment to chill and enjoy an awesome burger. Definitely try to work this place into your weekly schedule, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"No healthy choices.  It's OK for the adults we know what we're doing, but for children there's zero healthy choices. Only sides even with macaroni and cheese is french fries or potato chips. And if you want to substitute it's two dollars more. When I ask Jason Hulsey the manager he said, \"that is what corporate dictates and that's the price point\".
What ever happened to customer service? I guess when the other restaurants that share the same parking lot all have 30-45 minuets wait times and this place doesn't should of told me something.

If I could leave negative stars I would. 

After not only pissing my wife off. They also made my kid cry.  BTW the kids Mac and cheese is spicy and there is no warning.  

The manager followed me out to the parking lot to yell at me. And by this time my kid was hysterical. 

What the f$$k."}
{"text":"The steakhouse truffle is the best burger I've ever had. This place is great and my waitress the last 2 times was Rylee and she was AMAZING! I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Service was below average. Wait staff seemed to get every table's order mixed up with another when serving food. 

Random items ended up on our bill. Thankfully the removed it once I said something.

Custom made a burger and Mac N' Cheese. Half of what I ordered was missing.

In all, it was a slightly below average burger joint."}
{"text":"Good burgers...split MacChz and Bleu...they need to do fre3sh cut fries tho and for 2 $43 with 2 beers is a bit hi for lunch...but, great beer selection and a min of 4 stars for any restaurant with PilsnerUrquel on tap!"}
{"text":"Great place to chill have a beer enjoy scenery and environment. Amber and Tayler are super awesome remember my drinks and food and beers are cold."}
{"text":"First time at cold beer and cheeseburgers on seventh Street, super excited to check out the local neighborhood place! Until we discovered that it's NOT dog friendly and we're denied access... How do you open up a restaurant in an up-and-coming Urban neighborhood that promotes walking, biking and dogs and not have a dog friendly patio? Come on cold beer and cheeseburger! There are 20 restaurants within walking distance... Don't blackball yourselves! We now do not choose you!"}
{"text":"The servers are friendly, the food delicious!! I always have to get the Jumbo pretzels & prime dip... I could eat here everyday"}
{"text":"Amazing burgers and food. 

The service can be hit or miss. The staff of friendly and the prices are comparable to other restaurants in the area. 

It can be really loud so probably not good for infants."}
{"text":"My wife and I thought we would try this place because it sounded cool. Well, just because something sounds cool doesn't mean it is. The food was very expensive and was not worth the price. The sweet potato tater tots sounded good but they were eh. I don't recommend eating here unless you want to pay premium prices for food that is far from premium.

The ambiance of the restaurant is okay. It is a nice place."}
{"text":"The food was excellent and the staff pretty attentive. 
Hands down best burger I've had in a while. 
The prices are up there a bit, however worth the flavor."}
{"text":"I'm a bit conflicted about cold beers & cheese... On one hand, it's nice having a legit sports bar nearby.. On the other, the cheeseburgers are so-so, and considering that their name is cold beers & cheeseburgers, it's disappointing. We will keep giving it opportunities to improve, but Lucky Lou's is a better product and closer to home."}
{"text":"Great new location.   Had been to their location in Grayhawk.  However, the amazing tv viewing for sporting events while eating fantastic burgers couldn't be denied!   Love the CB and CB burger, Mac and cheese burger!  We all up graded our sides... best Parmesan and truffle fries, sweet potato tots, and onion rings!   Definitely will return when visiting family in Scottsdale"}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times and have been negligent in updating Yelp and fillin' y'all in.... whoops.
Went the latest time for lunch on Friday with my hubby. We ordered burgers suggested on the menu because we remembered the last time we wanted a create-your-own type and had to fill out some stupid form.
Filling out a form to request your toppings on a burger or in Mac and cheese? :/ Um, why have waitresses at all?

The burgers are fine. Nothing to get excited about and no reason to make a special trip. They do offer quite a few burger recipes/suggestions on their menu, which is nice. Especially of you don't want to have to fill out the card and do the waitresses job for her.

Staff-They're always polite. And, again, fine. The times I've been they've been young and just need some guidance to help develop their customer service skills... like bring extra napkins when you're serving a burger or food that requires eating with your hands, checking on you after the food item is delivered to make sure it was cooked properly, tastes good and the general \"can I bring you anything else\" (I may want Mayo or may have used all of the ketchup provided at the table).

Music-We were there at lunch on a weekday. Not only did it seem a little loud, but it had way too much bass. I felt like they were going for the nightclub feel. At lunch. In a sports bar. On a weekday. 
Maybe I'm just old. (shrugging)

Are their potato chips home made? They sure we're tasty. Tater tots are okay, too. To me it's always good to have tater tots as an option."}
{"text":"Good food. I had a great chicken sandwich and the french fries were on point but they keep the TV's far too loud. The place was almost full at dinner time and the TV's were so loud I had to yell back and forth with the waitress and lean over the table to even try and talk to my wife. But the crowd there is mostly going to watch the game not have a conversation so it's understandable I guess, just not my thing."}
{"text":"Don't bother with this place! Burgers are awful! My avocado was brown and hard. Bacon was old and cold. Bun was stale. This place replaced the other crappy joint, Uncle Bears. Apparently they kept the same management as no one even care that my food sucks. Never again. Just to add...the French fries are fried in old oil and nasty. This place is over priced and blows!!"}
{"text":"Mac N' Cheese, char dogs, burgers, and tater tots, lots of tater tots.  Not to mention buffalo chicken eggrolls, parmesan truffle fries, and hell fire chips.  This is bar food, and it is so good!  You'll need to throw your diet out the window when you dine at Cold Beers & Cheeseburgers, but you'll be so happy you did.  Since you decided to use your cheat day at this fine establishment, you may also choose from nearly 100 beers, nearly half on tap.  The beer list covers the full spectrum, with many local selections highlighted.

They were packed on the Friday evening I stopped in with some coworkers, but we got seated pretty quick.  Service was in quite a hurry the whole night, but our waitress was very friendly and she was managing a lot of tables.  She did well and our food and drinks came out without mistakes.  I had the Chicago char dog and it was just perfect.

If you're craving cold beer and (insert guilty bar food here), this is your place."}
{"text":"Their drink prices aren't bad and servo was good. Food is WAY overpriced for what you get.  I paid $7 for 5 sprigs of asparagus.  Seriously?!! Also they have trivia on Thursdays and it's VERY loud and  the host is totally obnoxious. It was so bad my friend and left. We couldn't even hear one another talk... Won t be going back."}
{"text":"This place has the best cheeseburgers I've ever had! I've tried the juicy lucy and the cb&cb. Both were equally delicious in their own way. They have lots of beer on tap and my favorite red ale. This is easily one of my favorite restaurants. The waitresses are sweet and attentive. I never had to ask for a refill. There are tons of tvs to keep the husband entertained too"}
{"text":"5 stars for food. Knocked one off for sour puss server. Would it kill you to smile? 
We got the sleepy dog red rover irish ale and kilt lifter beers. Both were so good and chilled to perfection. The mac and cheese burger was calling our name which we answered with a pretzel bun, of course. The best burger I've ever had,  no joke. We will be back and hopefully we won't get the same debby downer server."}
{"text":"Vanessa is the best server ever! I love her. If you're in the area and love good food and good service go to this place and ask for janessa!"}
{"text":"Sat for over 10 minutes before a supervisor or manager came over to ask if we had been helped. I watched as 5 servers walked by our table and helped the other tables. 5 minutes for water and the beer and cocktail that was ordered came out 7 minutes after ordered. The waitress was disinterested and unattentive. However, I will say that the food was really good. My husband and I both ordered the same burger. I can't even remember what it was but it was cooked perfect. Most of the time when I order medium it comes out well, but it actually came out medium. I don't live in AZ, but my family does and so do my in-laws. Will I come back? Eh only out of convenience. However, the fact that my burger was cooked how I wanted it is a definite plus in my book. We came on a Thursday, it was trivia night. Cool and I would usually be in on that but having just gotten off a 4 hour flight I wasn't in the mood for it."}
{"text":"Great burger, great service!  They have a bunch of TV's which is awesome! The bathroom was super not clean."}
{"text":"The service was great! Our waitress Sydney was on top of it the whole time & was very attentive. She was so friendly and really did what she could to make our visit the absolute best! We will definitely be back and ask for her!"}
{"text":"Great spot to go for any occasion especially for sporting events.  Service is always on point and never an issue with the food.  Come on a Monday for the unlimited topping Mac N Cheese Special! Servers are friendly and stay on top of checking on you which seems to be rare this day and age.  A+++ and will constantly return, a million times better then Zipps which is nowhere near competition to CBCB anymore.  PS ask for Sammy to be your server, she is phenomenal!"}
{"text":"I read all of the reviews of this place before we went last Saturday night and I must say we were pretty nervous given remarks of the very poor service etc.

We had a large party and it was very busy!  The hostess accommodated us in a timely manner and found 2 booths right next to each other so we didn't have a long wait.  Our service was timely and none of us felt that the drinks/food took too long.  I had the 1000 Island burger which was delicious. Both the regular and sweet potato tots were awesome!!  Everyone loved their meal and we didn't think that it was overpriced.

Two things they should consider: 1) They planted a large cacti right next to where bike parking is...definitely not the best planning as 2 people in our party stuck themselves with the thorns.  Need more areas to lock up bikes as well. 2)7th street is a really busy street!  I hope that the bars/restaurants in that area consider spear heading an effort to get a lighted crosswalk for people trying to run/bike back and forth to the different businesses!"}
{"text":"Went there this past Friday night.  We have decided as a family that we will place restaurants in a jar, and randomly pick them.  The one rule is that we cannot wine about the selection.    I have been here in the past, and I wasn't too excited when this was picked out of \"the jar of Friday eats\".  I did follow the rules and didn't wine, until after dinner.

Get there around 7ish.  Totally surprised cause there was no line on a Friday night at peak dinner hour.  I was still told that it would be a 15-20 min wait.  It took about 20 mins to get seated so that was a plus.  We get seated and told that our waitress would be right there.  About 15 mins later, our waitress shows up and takes our drink order.  2 beers and 2 ice teas.  20 hungry mins later, the ice teas come.  \"I will be right back with the beers, and will take your order.\"  Here's the thing, I am in a bar and it is taking this long to get a couple of beers?  Well, it felt like forever and the beers came and we give our order.

Food came in a timely manner.  2 hangover burgers, a kids slider, and buffalo chicken sliders.  The burgers were fine, cooked to order so the kids were happy.  Buffalo chicken sliders were too spicy to finish and the tots were blah.  Onion rings were good though.

This probably be the last time we go to this location as our previous visits were kind of the same.  Really, the beers shouldn't take that long to be served, especially in a bar.  Prices seem high and the service wasn't the greatest but it seemed she was serving 12 tables by herself."}
{"text":"I'm a bit baffled why this place has such low reviews. The only downside I can think of is that their portion sizes are massive, so I would suggest sharing. I had the thousand island burger. I love patty melts, and this is kind of like a burger melt. Living up to their name, it was cheesy and delicious. Super messy, but worth it. I got it with onion rings, but their tots are where it's at! They are so crunchy and salty and awesome. Fun tip: they have mimosas with $1 refills so you can have a nice brunch and watch the game."}
{"text":"lance is the friendliest bartender I have ever met! great atmosphere and amazing food"}
{"text":"Giving 2 stars only because the food is good.

We arrived at 4:45p as we were anticipating a crowd due to college football and the World Series being on.  When they initially sat us, we were given the corner table, in the back of the restaurant where one other family was seated.   They had the speakers on full blast for the game, we couldn't hear ourselves converse (and no, I'm of the older population) I asked to be moved to a table not directly under the speaker, and they were happy to do so for us.

We had a very nice waitress, however, must have been new as she told my father in law his beer was around $2-$3 (bottles bud) when the price was really $5.  She dropped off our beverages and came back to take our order.  50, yes 5-0, minutes later, our food came out.  I ordered the cb & cb burger cooked medium and it came out a perfect medium rare( because the reviews here showed their burgers were undercooked to order).  There was no caramelized onions and was heavy on what tastes like 1000 not garlic aoli (pretty sure I was given the wrong burger) The sides are chips- which were burnt salt licks, but for $2 more I can have what would be a standard side at any other establishment (French fries, tots, onion rings etc)

Once we were done eating, we were finally asked if we would like another drink.  Another 20min later, we asked for our check since no one came back to see if we were ready for it.   Since we had been sitting here for now close to 2 hours, my 2year old was growing restless and we asked the hostess to run our tab so we could leave.  They said they were not able to do it, and deferred to our waitress.  Mind you, the whole night there was a group of girls who huddled around the waitress podium while, I'm assuming the manager, stood behind them.  On a busy night, I would think they would want all hands on deck, and the manager would maybe interact with the patrons and ask how their meal was.
 
My husband ended up talking to a manager as we left, but it was a little too late on our part, $90 later for some of the worst service any of us have ever had.  Even though the food was good, this is a place we will not be visiting again especially for the price- I could have gone to flemings and had a prime burger and a beer for half the price."}
{"text":"Well, I think this will be my last visit. What a bad experience! We were sat quickly during happy hour, just a few minutes before it ended. A waitress came over to take our drink order but told us she couldn't take an order for any alcohol (yes, at a place with beer in the name) because she was underage. Our waitress came over and we placed our order. The first girl brought a round of waters, then our waitress brought another tray of water and started to put them down. I told her we were good and didn't need 8 waters for the table, completely oblivious. My husband and I built our own veggie burgers, he added tots and I got a side salad, boy $2 up-charges. Our friends ordered and built their own turkey burgers with up-charged sides as well. It took over 20 minutes for our order to come, my side salad was two days past it's prime and very limp. My husband had ordered jalape√±os and Bbq sauce, it was missing both. The veggie burgers immediately fell apart and I found the patty to be disgusting in texture and flavor, despite what we piled on it to disguise it. I eat a lot of veggie burgers and ended up just eating the bun it was so bad. I the party of the half I ate and the other half on my plate, she asked if I wanted a box and I said no, no question about whether we liked our meal. Our friends both had missing add ons and had to wait over 10 minutes to get them. I'm not sure if our waitress (Stephanie) was oblivious or just didn't care but she pretty much sealed the decision not to return to spend $15 on a nasty meal and bad service."}
{"text":"I have always been a fan of the food at Cold Beer and Cheeseburgers especially their chicken wings but I did have one bad service experience on a take out order where my wait time was almost 1.5 hours after the stated ready time.  

I originally moved this rating down to a one star due to service and to see if I received a response from corporate leadership since the local manager was of no help.  Within one day of posting my note on Yelp the ownership of the organization reached out to me and apologized for the situation and asked if they could try and make it up to me.  It took a few weeks to get around to going back into the restaurant but I went on a Saturday morning and sat at the bar.  The bartender was super friendly, the service was top notch, and the food was excellent. I have since back on three other occasions and the food and service did not disappoint on any of those occasions.  

Mistakes happen, and when leadership steps up to the plate to make things right, then you know you are dealing with a good company.  


Update:"}
{"text":"Always a great time at this place! Lauren was a great help and patient with all of our questions and ordering. Thanks again for the great food and drinks! BTW, Build Your Own Mac N' Cheese is kid and adult approved!"}
{"text":"I really like the food, beer and atmosphere but the wait for food is just to long. Paying extra to sub chips for fries sucks but I can deal with it. Waiting 40min for food really sucks. I get appetizers fast but then having to wait after that for food is bad. Been here 3 times. All are 90+ min trips. Go to the location on Bethany home road. Much faster service A+."}
{"text":"Burgers are good but the luster has faded for me since my first visit. Most good burger restaurants that charge $14 for a burger serve fries with it. Here you get chips and have to upgrade if you want fries. Not a good practice in my opinion. Does not make me want to rush back. BTW, the upgraded fries  come in a fancy small bucket. Insulting way to provide a small portion."}
{"text":"Hamburgers were really good. There was a lot of choices for hamburgers. They had fries, cheese fries, tots, and red onion rings. 

Service on the other hand was lacking. Total wait time to order was about fifteen mintutes and it wasn't even busy.

This place had a bar feel, on the loud side not really kid friendly."}
{"text":"Come for the beer. Don't stay for the food. 
A few things about the food here, most of the dishes are super bland, their chicken is majorly weird tasting and the Mac n Cheese? I'd rather it out of a box than what they serve. 
What did we have? Here's a list:
Buffalo tater tots - friendly note, the chicken tastes like it was boiled or something and then shredded. It was kind of chewy. You know what I mean, that chewy chicken taste? Not good at all 
Veggie burger - ok so points because it's homemade but points taken away because it was super tasteless. 
Fries, tots: these are extra and don't come with your meal like our serve led us to believe. Sneaky on CBCB part if you ask me. So maybe you fix your ways of doing things? Talking to you management. 
Chicken wings: seriously no flavor. None. And they were sooooooo dry. 
Burger: the bun was stale, beyond stale, and the burger (I was told) didn't have much flavor to it. 
Dip sandwich: they don't serve it with ANY aus jus. NONE?! Seriously?!? We had to ask for a side of it. Positive and the bread was fresh. Negative and the sandwich was tasteless. 

See a theme here with their foods?

Note: fries DO NOT come with your burger and the servers DO NOT make that clear so it's an extra charge if you want fries with your sandwiches. 
The chicken wings are dry AF. Seriously. No joking around. So sad. 

Positives (and there aren't many): the beer selection is pretty decent and they do a rotating monthly beer special that is decent. 

So again, I repeat...
Come for the beer. Eat somewhere else for the food."}
{"text":"Went here last night after some suggestions from friends and family.  Very cool place.  It was a bit loud when we got there because the Women's soccer team just won the World Cup. Makes sense lol.  

Sat in a nice booth near the back and drinks were ready within a few minutes.  I got their Juicy Lucy, which is a cheddar burger that has the cheese melting on the inside.  I got fries on the side.  

The burger wasn't a large burger, but definitely had the charred grilled thing goin and personally I love that.  I probably could have done without the tomato and lettuce as it seem to make it a little hard to eat.  The fries were good, but nothing super innovated.  

We enjoyed and I look forward to trying something else next time."}
{"text":"Not too busy on a Sunday evening...ordered a build your own burger with tomato, pickle, onion, pepper jack and a fried egg.  Got the tomato onion and pickle but swiss cheese, lettuce and no egg.  Still not a bad burger for something I didn't order."}
{"text":"It's was a Friday during the lunch hour. Wasn't terribly busy and we sat in the bar area immediately. Service was prompt and courteous. Burger that I ordered was cooked to my request and the food was tasty and delicious. Prices for draft beer are average, burgers are around $12 but quality justifies the price. We will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"Don't order the mozzarella sticks! Burgers are always great, beer is always nice and cold and the service is pretty decent. Went after the open so it was a little crowded but not too bad. No complaints."}
{"text":"This CBCB is ok. Unfortunately we had a waitress with a bit of an attitude so I didn't really care for this location. I usually go to the ones in Old Town or NScottsdale and have never had any issues, everyone is usually super friendly. The food was great as expected but the attitude having waitress didn't mention that the French fries were an extra cost.. you don't want to know what her face looked like when I asked her to double check my tab. I didn't make a big deal about the couple dollar difference but it would've been nice to know and maybe I would've stuck with the chips had I known. I think this place can use a little staff development but other than that it's is very nice and the food is still great.  Another item to mention is the Valet.. you have to valet here so just beware."}
{"text":"Went for the first time with my family.  I was really surprised how small it was but it was very comfortable.  The sever was very nice and everyone liked the food.  Will go back"}
{"text":"My hubby and I stumbled in here after attending the inaugural Friday Food Truck event for Chandler which was just down the road (they have now moved to Alma School and Queen Creek). Even though we had already eaten, I wanted a beer and this place did not disappoint. Cold Beers & Cheeseburgers has a really great beer selection. There was plenty of craft beer of all styles on tap, much of it local. Our bartender was great; both knowledgeable and friendly. We checked out the menu and agreed that we have to come back for dinner sometime."}
{"text":"Horrible service!!! Seriously, don't come here if you're in a hurry or expect typical service because you won't be happy. Here on a Wednesday night and there are 4 open tables and yet they won't seat anyone. Their reason is so the wait staff and kitchen can \"catch up\". Guess they don't want to sell beer while we wait. They would just rather have us stand by the door and wait for the crappy wait staff and kitchen. MISERABLE EXCUSE for a restaurant to do business."}
{"text":"Excellent burgers. Amazing sweet potato tots. Love the Pittsburg burger. Great beers on draft. Milkshakes are tasty. Everyone I bring to CB&CB love the burgers and tots. 
Buns are so-so and have changed a few times but I go bun-less
Great buffalo chicken dip and chips
Hot dogs are good 
Great happy hour and buy one app get one free for game days!
Don't get the prim beef sandwich
Turkey burger is okay
Chicken sandwich is good but not their signature dish
Service can be slow but staff is personable 

Only complaint is its not healthy enough to eat regularly"}
{"text":"WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON HERE?? It took 15 minutes just to have someone aknowledge us. 45 minutes for 2 burgers and side salads.... it's still not here.  Everyone seems clueless.  All the girls are conrigating at the hostess stand.  Nobody's doing anything!!  Manager just walks around.  Totally oblivious.  This is such a stupid restaurant.  Who owns this chain? Hire skilled workers not just pretty faces.  It's now over an hour. No food.  Finally arrived. No apology.  Sorry...I won't be back, which is a shame since the food is actually quite good.  Damn...

Btw... the overpriced drinks and food and the non existent service may work in Old Town Scottsdale, but this crap won't cut it in Suburbia.  

And please...No canned responses.  It's actually insulting."}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and get the San Francisco hot dog if you like spicy food. Bacon wrapped hot dog with jalape√±os. Yumm. My friend got the burger and was disappointed. The waitress never checked on us and never refilled my iced tea when it was empty even though she stood around and talked to her friends."}
{"text":"Our server Kaytlan was polite informative personal and very pleasant! She was very attentive to the entire party at the table. 

If you love sports this is the place to come. Food was made to order so on a busy night it can take extra time but it is so worth it!

Great atmosphere
Easy parking
Text alerts when your table is ready"}
{"text":"Good food good service! Burgers and beers are as advertised. The music was awesome for the middle aged rockers like me and games all around. What more do you need?"}
{"text":"The hubs and I came in after a bout of Christmas shopping and were greeted with Cheer and kindness.  They serve Coca-Cola products, so that is a plus.  The hubs likes the TVs. I don't care about those either way.  We decided to try the buffalo egg rolls for an appetizer .  Yum.  The hubs got the American Bunger with bacon.  I got the turkey sandwich on sourdough.  It was huge!  I substituted sweet tots for the chips and that was a fantastic choice. We are taking lots of leftovers home."}
{"text":"We went there on a Wednesday two weeks ago and then ordered out the following week. Great place for casual night out with kids.  The ring o fire was spicy but good. , burgers are big beer was cold!   I would will definitely go again."}
{"text":"Hostess staff was great, waitress was amazing. Selection of beer was great. Food was worth 3 stars. A bit overpriced for what it is but the burger I had was good enough. Very loud so be prepared for not a lot of conversation. Lots of tv's for sports viewing."}
{"text":"I personally love this place!! Good food and good vibes. Thank you so much for making my experiences good there!"}
{"text":"Always have a positive experience when we come! Service is great and we've never tried anything bad. I would suggest starting with the Buffalo Chicken Totchos, they are amazing!"}
{"text":"Consistent. GOOD. Great service, great place to watch a game. Decent price. Silly name, though. I want cold beers and hot cheeseburgers, thanks all the same.

If you're from out of town and have kids, it's a great safe choice. Try the sweet potato tots."}
{"text":"Amazing food! The loaded tots are to die for. It's cool if you wanna go and watch a game or fight. TVS are literally covering every square inch of the walls. It is pretty loud in there, at least when we went. I know, i know its a sports bar. But it was super loud even with that considered. My bf and I had to yell to hear each other because the TVs were epically loud. Other than that though, the place was tasty and fun!"}
{"text":"Good times and great food. Bartender Lance is always fun and takes care of you! Loved the atmosphere and the music was pleasant!"}
{"text":"The food and drink was fantastic. Problem is, I feel like I was teased. Server very helpful in recommending unique burger and IPA but then freaking disappeared. Like seriously, a ghost after that. No follow up, no more beer. Very disappointed in service and may not return despite a very solid burger/ beer combination."}
{"text":"This place is all about convenience.  
The parking is horrendous!!! 
But the beer and the food is usually pretty good--- the salads leave something to be desired. But of course the burgers are good, as is the asparagus (appetizer) and the mozzarella sticks. Love their wide selection of beers, so there's always something new to try.
Just don't try to go on a Thurs, Fri or Sat evening---unless you wanna walk.
They finally did away with the valet parking too, so now things are even worse in that dept."}
{"text":"I think this place is great! They have a decent beer selection to choose from, their burgers are really good, and they have the best Cobb salad I've had! They are a little bit on the pricey side (up charging for fries if you're not a fan of chips), but I think the portions are fairly large and it is delicious so every once in a while worth it. The parking lot SUCKS but that's not their fault. I hate going to the area simply because it's very difficult to find parking...but if you can get past that frustration, definitely give this place a try. I've had friends try the hot dogs and Mac n cheese, they've said those are good too so if you're not in the mood for a burger I think it's safe to say most everything on the menu will be good."}
{"text":"I have found my favorite new burger. The Bacon PB&J burger here is amazing. I'm not a fan of spicy so I have them hold the chipotle sauce. But I've come in once a week for the past two weeks cause this burger is so amazing. Only reason I gave 4 stars is that for the prices you pay the burger should come with fries instead of chips. Both times we have come in the staff has been super attentive and fast."}
{"text":"This is one of the first restaurants I went to since moving here based on a recommendation. I love a good burger, and this place has it! You know it is a good burger place with good quality meat when they ask you how you would like it cooked. 

My hubby and I ordered some stuff and split it. We started with their buffalo wings, they are either baked off or grilled, either way, they are tasty! We also split the Juicy Lucy and it was amazing!  I will do the all-American burger next time to get a pure taste of their burger. We also got their fries and sweet potato tots. I have no idea what seasoning they use, but it is great! Both the fries and tots were crisp and cooked to perfection. The seasoning made them some of the best tots I have ever had! I wanted to order the mac and cheese as the table ordered it next to us and it looked amazing. I will have to save that for my next trip. 

I'm new to the neighborhood and I fully expect this place to be me and my husbands go to spot to watch games. They have too many big screen TV's to count. In fact, the host sat us at the table the Cubs game was on without knowing we are originally from Chicago. She had my husband hooked (he's a Cubbies fan).  Great vibe and great service!"}
{"text":"I live close, so I have tried this place on many different occasions. I like to come here for a late night drink, but the food is less than awesome. They have the most expensive, sub-par burgers I have ever seen. Needless to say I haven't eaten there in awhile. I would rather go to In and Out or Freddy's for a good burger."}
{"text":"Burgers were delicious, loved the tots. Service was great! Had the prime burger and Rocky Point, they were seasoned nicely. Looks like they have tons of drink choices and good happy hour. Definitely recommend and will return."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to the Mac and cheese,but our experience didn't start off so well. First, my beer was served in a pint glass with a chip in it so that had to go back. Next the build your own Mac and cheese that I love so much arrived with a hair on the side of the bowl. A pretty obvious hair that should not have left the kitchen. Gross. And it was the kind of hair that you can't get out of your mind. Disgusting. We should have left then, but we were so hungry. They made a new dish and it was tasty, but again hard to get the hair image out of my mind. They did comp it off our bill though. Won't be back to this location."}
{"text":"I love this place! I went to the Scottsdale location a couple times and was so excited when this location opened up closer to me! I had the hangover burger without a bun and it was amazing! My husband had the peanut butter and jelly, which surprisingly works and was also amazing. I would get both of those burgers again. The time before I got the o'lineman burger which is insane- 2 grilled cheese sandwiches as the buns on that bad boy. The only thing I'm not a fan of are the chips they make. To me they taste burned. So I would suggest the French fries instead. 
It is a loud, bar atmosphere and if you go later (we were there at 9:30) and they passed out trivia that the whole restaurant plays! We never did that at the Scottsdale location but we went around 6pm those times. Cold beer and cheeseburgers is the only place to go and fulfill my burger craving!"}
{"text":"Was in recently and enjoyed both the food and atmosphere. Great place to watch the game! Whatever game that may be. 

The food is awesome. And came surprisingly quick as the place was packed.

I don't usually mention a server by name, but Andi was particularly pleasant and gave us great service. She made us believers in the place! 

We'll definitely be back!

Thanks Andi, and huge shout to the kitchen staff."}
{"text":"It was pretty good and the menu had plenty of things on it that I would like to try.  The service was great and there is no doubt that the family and I will be back."}
{"text":"Looking forward to giving this place a second chance.

was really upset with this place because the service was really bad and frankly disappointing. But after the manager contacted me I've decided to give it another chance because my experience was for a togo order maybe a dine in experience will be a lot better."}
{"text":"Five stars Auto yes this is a five-star place they had Mastered hamburgers I saw on the menu a peanut butter and jelly bacon cheeseburger I asked the waitress how is it you'll be surprised I ordered it tried it I loved it. I can't stop thinking about this cheeseburger it was so good so filling and I had to take half of it home Happy Hour Friday we're going to be there."}
{"text":"Been there 3 times in 8 days... LOVE IT!  Finally a place with awesome Macaroni and Cheese!  Love the toasted panko on top!  Staff is top notch and food is terrific.  Plus a FULL bar!  Seating can be a challenge at peak times, super to see a new business thriving.  I hope to see another CBsquared soon - maybe over at Norterra...hint hint....."}
{"text":"Great beer list, nice service.  I had the Juicy Lucy.  Coming from MN, and having the original Juicy Lucy where the molten hot cheese that oozes out, and having to wait a few minutes for it to cool off before destroying it, the Juicy Lucy here was a let down.  The flavor was good, which is why I ate it, however,  the burger....was luke warm, to say the best.  The cheese that came out of the burger in a clump was cold.  Like.  Cold.  The price they charge for a burger here, that they serve with chips ($2 extra if you want fries or tots), is almost not worth coming back.  The tots were good.  They were at least hot."}
{"text":"Food is always on point, used to go to zipps but this food is superior. Better beer selection and the customer service is better. What else needs to be said? Will be coming back!"}
{"text":"We live pretty close to this location, and so we go there every so often for dinner or for happy hour. We went a couple weeks ago for happy hour and I had to write a review because I've had nothing but good experiences here!

The staff is always super great and we've never had any issues with service. The restaurant itself has a fun atmosphere and a nice big patio for days when it's nice out. We've also been able to watch several baseball and football games there, they have plenty of tvs and usually have several different games going. 

True to their name, amazing cheeseburgers and always a huge craft beer selection. Their happy hour deals are awesome, and they usually have additional drink specials going on (when we went a couple of weeks ago on a Thursday they had $4 select Four Peak brews). 

Like I said, I've never had anything but good experiences here! My fianc√© and I will continue to frequent this location and will continue to recommend it to everyone!"}
{"text":"Best burger I ever had. So many unique choices.  Service is slow. It gets really crowded on game nights. Patio is really fun"}
{"text":"Great, original burgers, but awkwardly overpriced."}
{"text":"Cold beer and Cheeseburgers has the potential to be a great sports bar. They have good craft beer on tap, bottles and cans. They have specials almost every night of the week, and a select craft beer of the month.

We started our meal with a couple of cold beers. Since it was Tuesday, all of the cans were $3, even Ballast Point Sculpin! We ordered a couple appetizers. First up was the Spicy Chicken Wing dip. It was served with house made chips and it was surprisingly spicy! Most places take it easy with their Buffalo Sauce, not here! Flavor was good, but it said it was mixed with Bleu Cheese, but it wasn't discernable. The chips we're good, thick cut, light salt a little tan and not very greasy. We also got the Happy Hour pretzel with cheese. Two big pretzels with a slightly crunchy exterior and a soft crumb inside. It was a  a little too buttery and the cheese was a little overwhelming. The cheese had a kick  as it was blended with jalapenos.

As their name implies they have cheeseburgers, and lots of them. I went with the staple American Burger, comes with American cheese, lettuce, tomato, pickles on a brioche bun. IMHO this is a good American standard that allows the burger to be front and center. As this was my first time, I wanted a good baseline. I ordered it medium and it came out perfect, slight char on the outside light pink on the inside and not too greasy. The flavor was amazing. Definitely a good cheeseburger. I also ordered it with the sweet potato tots. They were definitely sweet! However, they lacked the crunch you expect from tots, hard to do with sweet potatoes. As always we had our picky little food critic with us. He's 8 so he ordered a grilled cheese and fries. It was good, made with three cheeses, American, Swiss and Cheddar. He devoured the fries, we didn't even have a chance to try them, but there just fries.

We were stuffed so we skipped dessert. There is a third thing that CB&CB have, that might appeal to the more masculine crowd, attractive young waitresses in tight yoga pants. Definitely easy on the eyes. Even my wife raised her eyebrows a couple times. What the servers made up for in looks they lacked in actual serving ability. The hostess offered our son a coloring activity and a kids menu, but didn't get us either. Our waitress was not very attentive, didn't say her name when she came to the table, never smiled, and never really checked up on us. We had to get her attention or she would just walk right past. She was more concerned with playing with her hair then anything else. I also didn't see the Manager rounding the tables to check on people. I'm assuming that they had two managers staffed that night, because there were two guys wearing polos standing at the front counter. We were there for an hour and a half and usually they round every hour or so.

I would give this place a second try, but they need to work on the staff. When you go out to eat you expect good customer service."}
{"text":"The food wasn't bad, but it isn't a place to take a family. My sons and I (3 of us) have been here several times, but the prices are too steep for a family. Each time it was at least a $65 bill for lunch! That's my only real complaint. Not like we were ordering drinks and deserts, we weren't. 

The sliders are great, big points on those. The burgers were a bit greasy, but what can one expect...I think the chef ought to try Umami burgers in L.A. 

Fries were fine. 

Too noisy though.  But it is s sports bar. I think the open bay concept simply help amplify the noise."}
{"text":"Had do go here when I read on yelp they serve a \"juicy lucy\" which is a burger with the cheese inside.  The burger was a good half pound with a nice char on it. Overall not that different from just a cheeseburger, but glad I tried it. Saw alot of other burgers on the menu to try next time."}
{"text":"Great turkey burger! Fun sports watching environment! Try one of their specialty drinks. Want to come again and try their adult dessert."}
{"text":"My first time at this location. Service was below par, first of all, I didn't get silverware. I ordered the Hot & Smokey Mac N Cheese minus the bacon.  Everyone else at the table ordered burgers and all of their food arrived except my meal. I patiently wait and half way through their meal the waitress comes back and states that my plate will be out shortly due to the cook accidentally adding bacon and had to start all over. At this time I also asked for silverware, did not get it. My friends have now  finished  their meals and still no Mac n Cheese. At this point I walked to the counter and asked for my order to be canceled, despite being famished. I decided I'd eat at home. Suddenly the waitress brings out the Mac N Cheese and asked if I still wanted it in a to go box. I hesitated but it looked so tasty that I couldn't resist, told her I was so hungry I'd stay and eat it there.  She states she'd take care of it. I ate half my plate and was immediately satisfied. I had to eat with a spoon because I never did get a fork (No napkin to wipe the excess cheese). The bill took forever to arrive and after I was told that I wouldn't be charged, which is ok, I did eat most of it, I was charged half price. It was not that busy at all. I go to the Scottsdale location frequently and have never had bad service"}
{"text":"LOVE IT! My mouth is watering just thinking about these burgers. The homemade chips are also killer. Fun atmosphere, friendly service and of course great food. I'm so grateful a friend showed me this joint and I will continue bringing my friends here."}
{"text":"Great food, amazing service and one hell of a beer list..... much needed in Ocotillo!"}
{"text":"Louis, the manager, made up for my unfortunate 1st visit. He remebered me & my negative Yelp review, & he more than made up for it, by telling me, before i ordered, that whatever i wanted was on the house. I wasnt too greedy, i just ordered a burger & a beer, but the burger was one of the best ive ever had, the huge, delicious prine rib burger. which i believe was $16 & worth every penny. The name of the beer escapes me, but it was awesome, & $9. So even though a beer and burger woyldve ran me over $30 with tip, they were one of the best beers & one of the best burgers, that ive ever had. The fact that it was all on the house, has made me give them a 5 star review, & Ill let everyone who care to hear, that this pkace is indeed the best pkace for a cold beer & a cheeseburger."}
{"text":"I've had my eye on this spot since they opened and had the pleasure to eat there last night. I really like the restaurant, huge tv's at the bar so got to watch Olympics, bartender was friendly and helpful. The food was delicious only reason I didn't give a 5 star is because it's a little pricey but it's a fun place to stop in for a drink and  fabulous hamburger"}
{"text":"This is a really fun sports bar especially when there are big games going on. It's in a perfect location on N Scottsdale Rd with a free public parking garage right behind it, which you cannot beat! It's close to Tempe as well as Phoenix area so it gets pretty busy during big games. They have great food and a good beer selection as well and the waitstaff is friendly and good too! TV's in the bathroom is a plus too so you don't miss any action!"}
{"text":"Fixed the service issues, great staff, very friendly fun.  Food is really good, the hot dogs are killer, nice beer selection, ice cold!!!! Also have decent wine which is unusual for sports bar"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, good food, and a wide selection of drinks made this a great place to go with friends.  I was intrigued by the peanut butter and jelly burger and I was not disappointed, it was very delicious!  The staff was very friendly especially our server Vanessa!  I would love to come back once it cools down a little more and hang out on the patio."}
{"text":"Good beers and burgers. The pretzel appetizer was delicious. The food was good. We are looking forward to watching sports at this bar."}
{"text":"Great place to grab a burger and a beer.  The service is great.   It was very similar to a Hooters. But we had fun nonetheless."}
{"text":"Took my friend Mike here since he has not been able to get himself in since it opened. He's raving about how much this is now his new place to go to for a burger. Loved the extensive beer list too."}
{"text":"Went to CBCB on Father's Day.  Restaurant was packed but check in via yelp helped get a table very fast.  The fathers eat free was a great bonus too.  Food was good.  Kitchen was a bit slow, but understandable given the promotion and the wait.  Would definitely go back again.  Service was good otherwise."}
{"text":"Went to Cold Beer and Cheeseburgers last night to have some food and brews with my buddy. Walked in around 11pm, the place was dead maybe two people at the bar and two other tables. Nobody greeted us so we sat at the bar. Female bartender didn't seem to like us much, quick short service and amiss attitude, she was also excessively on her phone texting and on social media, I was directly ignored twice lol \"hey can I get a menu....nope\". Had to ask for a food menu twice and the build your own burger form as well.  The beer was excellent, tho my Duvel Belgian Ale was poured too quickly (lots of foam)  and in a standard glass when it should have been poured in a slow manner and served in a tulip shaped glass.  The fries were excellent, warm, crisp and seasoned just right.  However the meals ticket time was rather lengthy at 26 minutes especially since they weren't busy at all. Both of our burgers my build your own and my buddy's Bacon Bleu came out lukewarm.  We took a bite each and asked for them to be reheated and thrown back on the grill. They came out 5 minutes later and to our dissatisfaction we both looked at each other and said \"I mean they are warmer now but they could still be much warmer\" the cheese wasn't even cheesy lol. Needless to say we still ate all of our food, good flavor just cooking temperate way off par for a big juicy cheeseburger.  The service was pretty bad, my buddy and I both got the feeling that the bartender didn't like us.. maybe she was having a bad night or some life drama since she was on her phone all night lol.   Thanks CB&CB won't be back and I live right across the street. Still tipped $20 so you can't even say I'm a hater but please get better staff, friendlier bartenders and teach the cook how to properly serve a well heated burger!"}
{"text":"After having been here more then a few times I have to drop it a star. Not sure what's going on, but like other reviews on here the service is either a hit or miss. Either it's good or it's really bad.  The food so far remains pretty consistent but that's about it."}
{"text":"My husband and I dined recently at the new Cold Beers and Cheeseburgers.  They were very busy, which was understandable, however, after an extremely long wait, I noticed the group next to us, who had come much later, had received their order. It seems they received our order,and needless to say, we chose not to accept it after that was discovered.  We asked to see the manager, who did not offer a drink or dessert for the inconvenience (and extremely long wait), merely said if we had 15 minutes he'd have food to us.  The burgers finally came, at this point we were annoyed,and opted to take the food home.  And the cheeseburgers were not that great for all the aggravation!  Many places in Phoenix to get a burger, we will not be going back."}
{"text":"My burger was good, and huge, our server was friendly. We were in and out for a last minute dinner. The valet went above and beyond though, I completely forget his name but as I pulled up (in my new jeep, with the top down) I reminded my daughter to bring her shopping bag in with her because i havent figured out how to put the top back up. The valet guy overheard me and offered to try to put it up for me. (mind its also hot as balls out)by the time we came out from dinner it was up. Seriously, so nice! Now Ill need him to put it back down again for me LOL"}
{"text":"Wow this place has gone down hill! $7 Bloody Mary's. Outrageous. And not that good. 

All the food is INCREDIBLY expensive."}
{"text":"Whoever manages this location should be fired. All of the TVs are unwatchable and there is 100? a problem with the receivers. Even the servers agreed there was a problem  with all TVs. Not good."}
{"text":"Brought my dog to their dog friendly patio and had dinner. The food was fresh and the onion ring batter tastes like hush-puppies! Sprang for the pretzel bun and was not disappointed, the service was fast and the server was personable. I will definitely go back and try their happy hour specials next time, it was also great that they offer a discount fir checking in to their restaurant on Yelp."}
{"text":"I dined here for the first time during the NBA Final. I like that this was a nice sports bar without needing to go to a dive bar. It is in a great location. They have a lot of TVs so it was great to go watch the game there. The place was packed! The service was a bit slow but it was busy so I understand.
My friends and I ordered a few things. The buffalo chicken tots were awesome (craving them as I write this)! They were flavorful, right amount of greasy without feeling gross and a great spicy kick! The turkey burger were just eh. I mean the bun tastes nice and soft. Also had the basic mac n cheese with chicken. It tasted basic but I liked that again the food didn't taste heavy and it was still pretty good.
We shared the smores. Menu shows serves 4. We each had about one smore each. There were more graham crackers and chocolate than marshmallows.
 
Overall, I would like to go back and try out some more food and give you another update! (Oh and get some more buffalo chicken tots!)."}
{"text":"I can get cold beer & cheeseburgers anywhere. I come here for the tots.  The cheeseburger sliders are amazing! And SO many beers on tap. They have Shock Top which is my fav. Such a great place!"}
{"text":"Came here to eat, waitress took our order fast forward 27 mins and we ask where our food was she says \"oh they lost your order\"...she then asks us what we got and had to retake our order, no apology at all. We then flag the manager who tells us \"oh she never said that, your order is coming right out\" complete lie. Not to mention the waitress never came back to tell us it was \"coming out\". Bad customer service and the fact that they lied and acted like nothing was wrong was just insulting. No wonder this pace is close to 2 stars. Go to the one in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Ok. So there are quite the variety of reviews on here, so I almost decided not to go. 

But I am glad I did.

I have had some prior experience with CB&CB, in Dayton Ohio.
That location was terrible, as far as food goes. And, no surprise, it eventually went out of business.

So I was hesitant to try this one.

They insect(flies) situation wasn't as bad as others have posted, when I was there. I did notice quite a few of them buzzing around..but I never had to swat at any of them for getting too close.

The hostess was nice. And so was my server, Brittany.

I ordered the CB& CB burger; Burger with carmelized onions, and a garlic aioli.
I asked for it med/well. I think it came out closer to medium..but it wasn't cold and raw..so I could deal with it.  That was the only complaint I had for the burger. 
Otherwise, it was big and tasty.
I got the regular tater tots as my side.  YUMMM!  They were crispy, hot, and seasoned great!  Kinda lame that they charge you an extra 2 bucks for those.

They have a huge selection of beers as well.

I will be back."}
{"text":"Burgers were delicious. Sides were not. Too much dressing on the salad. Chips were cut too thick. Music was way too loud inside and even on the patio. The prices are a bit too high. Poor service and the servers hair was everywhere."}
{"text":"I love that they put a Cold Beer and Cheeseburgers location in central Phoenix. The food is phenomenal as well as the customer service. Our server was amazing. I believe her name was Tina-Anne according to our receipt. She gave us great recommendations and helped us order exactly what we wanted. The food came out in perfect timing and it was good and warm. The food tasted amazing. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Tried to eat dinner with a friend on Thursday. They had the hockey game on so loud it hurt your ears. We had to shout at the waitress to order a beer and even she couldn't hear. We asked for them to turn it down and they refused. Other diners were also complaining ( we could hear them shouting to staff too). Never thought a restaurant would be louder than a Metallica concert. We gave up and walked out without even finishing our beers and went to dinner at a nice Mexican place down the street (which also had the hockey game on) but you could actually talk with people at your table."}
{"text":"Burgers were awesome and our waitress Nicole was super!

Place of full of big screen tv's great for watching all kinds of sports!"}
{"text":"Came in excited to eat here because we were very hungry and ready to eat \"award winning\" burgers. We came in and yes our server was very nice but our wait time was stupid long. There isn't anyone here and yet our order took more than an hour to come out. Then on top of that our food was cold. I get sometimes food can take forever but never this long. I can just imagine how it is on their busy nights. Never again coming here. Also the manger was very rude when we talked to her about the issue. As a manger you need better customer service."}
{"text":"This is the best place to watch a game and have a few beers!!! Throughout the entire football season, my fantasy football team and I would meet here. The jalape√±o and bacon Mac n cheese is amazing!!!!
The atmosphere is fun, engaging and the perfect place to just unwind. 
Not to mention the Bloody Mary bar is flipping amazing!!!!"}
{"text":"For the second time service was very poor. I had to go ask where our server was. Then she said they very busy,not my problem, then the food took a while again she says they were backed up again not my problem. They obviously don't have enough help. Food was good but they need to fix the service problem"}
{"text":"If your name is cold beer and cheeseburgers, then you better do a great job with cold beers and cheese burgers. 

The beer was cold but the cheeseburger was so disappointing. Came out burnt with no flavor and the bun was twice the size.

There are so many awesome burger shops around I doubt I will be back."}
{"text":"People seem to be hatin' on this place.  I came here with my team from work and we had a wonderful experience. We came in at about 2:00 on a Tuesday, so well after the lunch crowd was gone. We basically had the place to ourselves, and the server was very attentive.  The prices were in line with what you will pay at other gourmet burger joints, but the beer was a little steeply priced. $5 for a can of Moose Drool seems a little excessive. But overall we had a great time and I would come back here with my husband anytime."}
{"text":"We got a pretzel, the chicken tender appetizer, grilled cheese and 3 16oz beers totaling $57 with 20% tip - not sure how that happened. Mediocre at best. You can easily find a better spot."}
{"text":"this is one of the best sports bars i have eaten at, great burgers and mac and cheese are primary entrees0"}
{"text":"SO HAPPY YOU'RE in our neighborhood!! We love your atmosphere and menu, and your prices are in-line. BUT, we went this past Sunday, and the waitress was sweet, but we waited a LONG time for our food. Mine was great, but my son's burger was ordered medium-rare, and came out so raw he couldn't eat it. Given your name, not getting that right would be a deal-breaker. more kitchen help? More practice on burger temperatures?? We're rooting for you!"}
{"text":"Confused at cold beer and cheeseburgers.  the menu is very confusing.  We are not beer drinkers at all. had a coupon but the coupon was only for one person, so I let me friend have the 1/3 pd burger, onion rings and root beer for $10. I chose the healthy option since I do not like to eat big burger buns this is where it gets weird.  The menu is very hard to understand and even the waitress agrees.  On the Healthy menu they have a 1/2 pound burgers wrapped in lettuce with two sides which the menu states but they wrote it down incorrectly.  I was expecting to get two sides with my burger like the menu stated but they said no their interpretation was two sides or a side salad.  But it did not read like that, also the menu should have read plain burger no fixing's with lettuce on top.  But it did not, be careful when ordering from this company confusing menu, mgr who not really good mgr as I never received what I originally ordered.  After two times I stopped asking, We will not be back, the burgers were good but with all the confusion and both the waitress and the mgr not really knowing what to do or giving us the correct burger, it is not worth the hassle to return.  Not a fan - There are tons of better burger joints around with less than 26 TV's.  Also not a real fan of wasting a/c they had their a/c full blast and their doors wide opened.  Not a fan.   Also if you are a health nut avoid the shakes as they do NOT use real ice cream but rather the ice cream is made from chemicals as please be careful when ordering the shakes."}
{"text":"Tried CB&C for the first time and really enjoyed!  Read reviews that recommended the PBJ Bacon Cheeseburger so gave it a try - wow!  This is the most unusual burger ever and SOOOOO good!  The sweet and nutty are excellent and the bacon, who doesn't like bacon!  Great combination!  Tried the sweet potato tots and really liked them, as well.  They have weekday happy hour, too, from 3-6pm so we'll have to try another great menu item.  Good food for the $."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere.  We went to the downtown Scottsdale location and have been there no less than 5 times in 60 days.  The tater-tot appetizer is off the charts.  Lots of food to choose from but my go to is the Grayhawk Club.  Lots of TV's and open window seating! Service is awesome and lots of special treatment!"}
{"text":"Stopped in recently to try one of their burgers. Ordered the Juicy Lucy and WOW was it Delicious! And huge! I could only finish about half of it though I did give it a good try. Fries were delicious as well. Maybe I should have cut back on the Papago Orange Blossoms and I would have had more room in my belly! Thanks for the great service Ciera! We'll be back! Hopefully the WIFI will be working by then...hint! Hint!"}
{"text":"Great burgers and all dads get their burger FREE today in honor of Father's Day!!
Onion rings were fantastic too!!"}
{"text":"Was so excited to finally try this location and I'm nothing but disappointed and sick to my stomach. There was an actual black fly in my Iced Tea! I was so disgusted I couldn't even finish my food that I had just gotten. I get that oh maybe he was on the rim of the glass n fell in but No! It had a missing wing and legs so he had been stirred and poured before! When I brought it to the waitresses attention she was like oh sorry this happens a lot. They couldn't even take the damn Iced Tea off my bill or the 16 dollar sandwich that I didn't want to eat because who knows what else was flying or crawling around in that place. If anyone else has ever found a bug or hair in your food and that sudden rush of disgust comes over you and you just want absolutely nothing else, that's what happened. I will never go back to this place again"}
{"text":"We have been coming to Cold Beers & Cheeseburgers for years before this one opened and were super excited that it is so close to our neighborhood. However, I have never had luck with service at this location. The biggest turn off is the servers and hostesses attitudes, not welcoming. Also was turned away after drinks and food had already been ordered and waited for because we brought our dog on the patio which must be a me rule because we have brought him every time we've come to CBCB. Poor management. Why did we get as far as ordering before we were kicked out?"}
{"text":"Usually a really good choice but today (Weds) was build your own burger day. I ordered one with golden mustard and it seemed as though it was barbecue sauce on It instead. I brought that to the attention of the bartender and was told that the red substance that tasted just like barbecue sauce was golden mustard! She explained that often the cook will mix it with buffalo sauce to spice it up. (Didn't ask for that either!) No offer to remedy the fact I was unhappy with the meal. I paid and left. Sad!!!"}
{"text":"I expected a lot more from this place. The service was good, I can't complain about that. But the food was just average. They tout having award winning burgers, but I don't think there was anything spectacular about the food. We tried four different burgers between us, only one of which I would consider going back for. We tried the Open Pit Burger: Barely any BBQ sauce on this one, which left it dry and a little bland. Also tried the Rocky Point Burger: pretty good, I'm still not sure how I feel about sour cream on a burger but it kinda worked on this one. The Hawaiian: small piece of canned pineapple for a big burger, the proportions just didn't really work for me and the flavor was lacking (could have at least grilled the pineapple...). The only one that I did enjoy more than the others was the Steakhouse Truffle: The flavors went well together and the burger was juicy. All of their burgers are served with (burnt) chips and you have to pay $2 additional to upgrade to another side, including fries. The fries were very good, I will say I enjoyed those much better than the chips that originally came with the meal. Otherwise for price and quality you might as well go to Red Robin or any other burger chain."}
{"text":"I had a beer that was not frosted nor cold.big let down. Seems 2b a up scale please with private parking. 

I had wing they were basic. My friends liked there burger. Homemade chips were burnt. Fries ok.they have games there but
Didn't seem like a family setting place. The best part was the men's bathroom was cool and clean and had TV z in it.the bill
Was 80 bucks. Not happy time."}
{"text":"Best selection of craft beers in North Scottsdale! The bartenders are incredible as is the wait staff and managers. It's a pleasure to have found a great sports bar in North Scottsdale."}
{"text":"They provide exactly what they say, cold beer and cheeseburgers. The variety of cheeseburgers is refreshing and a nice chage from the same ol' same ol'. I had the o-lineman which is a cheese stuffed patty sandwiched between 2 grilled cheese sandwiches. Despite the threat of a sever colon backup, I went ahead and ate that beast and it was glorious. The burger itself aside, the grilled cheese was fantastic on its own. What prevents them from getting that 5th star is that the patty itself was a little tough and wasn't as flavorful as I would have expected a sit down cheeseburger place to have, but don't let that deter you. Good ambience, good food. Go for it. Last point: tots are insanely delicious here. Get them. Hey. You. Get the tots."}
{"text":"Update:  You've asked me to update my review so I will.  It's been almost 9 months of not setting foot in this establishment and it won't change.  You are overpriced, mediocre and clearly don't give much care to your guests as you repeatedly respond to people though this platform but chose to ignore mine.  Ignoring a customer is potentially the worst possible infraction in business and I will continue to take mine elsewhere and encourage others to do the same.  I hope you enjoy the slow death which is your business.

Never again.  $15 for a bacon cheeseburger with fries (on build your own burger day for $11?).  I can get a steak for $15?!  $2 to add terrible, frozen French fries?!  I've tried several times to like this place as the beer list is good and the location is great.  But between the parking nightmare outside, the dreadful service and outrageously priced bad food; we are done."}
{"text":"Props to the Drunk Genius that invented the Totchos here. Brilliant. 

Service was up to par for a slightly busy lunch service. 

Our only two recommendations are:
1) Add a little spice/flavor to the hummus plate.
2) Open a location in Gilbert."}
{"text":"Went in yesterday for dinner we both had the HH all American burger it was awesome and huge, (took half home just ate it for breakfast yum yum). The fries and chips were also great and fresh but the best part was our server Ashley she was on the ball, very nice and attentive made the whole experience amazing, we will definitely be back!! Lots of TV's to enjoy all sports too!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely the BEST hamburger I have ever eaten. They have unsweetened blackberry ice tea too.  The service was superb. We'll worth the 40 minute wait for our food. We split the burger. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great menu items and good overall prices. Good spot to catch the UFC fights or the seasonal ball games.  Friendly staff amd they are very attentive to needs during busy times."}
{"text":"Start with the good.  Lots of big screens everywhere, great place to see your favorite team from anywhere in the place.  Excellent draft beer selection.  Burgers were pretty good.  Service is where this place fell flat.  It took our waitress over 20+mins to come get our drink order, food order was equally slow, and needed to be repeatedly flagged down to reload drinks for the kids or beers for the adults.  I get that is Sunday afternoon opening weekend of the NFL, but what really chapped me was watching her chatting it up with the hostess on our way out.  Has the components to be better than average, but also has some work to do."}
{"text":"Good food, fast service and attentive staff. Came in with a group of 6 friends for dinner, and were seated right away. I like that they have several flat screen TVs that are visible from no matter where you sit. They have a lot of burgers to choose from, made it kind of difficult to choose but I went with the AZ Burger. The meat was cooked to order and was delicious, it was a good 1/2 lb patty. Also tried their truffle fries and loved them. I will definitely come and visit again."}
{"text":"I love Cold Beers and Cheeseburgers!! Especially this location!! Maddie was a GREAT waitress who was helpful, kind and quick. They also have an awesome vegetarian patty that you can swap for any special burger. Highly recommend the Rocky Point with a veggie patty!"}
{"text":"This is a great establishment. Great food and drinks at a good price. The bartenders are especially great. Lance makes the best martini I have had in town, and I have tried a lot of places. Jesse is always great and they take care of their regulars. Everything on the menu is great. You seriously cant go wrong coming here, especially this location."}
{"text":"Never disappointed by this place!  Starting with walking in the door it's a fun uplifting experience.  If your with your buds or your kids anyone is welcome.  They have a wide variety of beers on tap and ice cold mugs!  The menu has WAY more than just cheeseburgers but the cheeseburgers are out of this world!  I love the create your own because the pretzel bun is spot on!  I also am mildly obsessed with the huli chicken sandwich phenom!!! If you haven't been time to go and be sure to check out the daily specials...great value!"}
{"text":"We went here for the first time on a Sunday.  It was packed and they have lots of tvs which is great for the tons of sports fans in the restaurant.  We aren't big football fans but felt totally comfortable being there.  The food is SO GREAT!  We had a really bad waitress.  We waiting 15 minutes after being seated to be served and our waitress who served us had walked by us about 5 times which was pretty annoying.  We placed our food order and again couldn't get her to stop and refill/order new drinks.  I stopped the hostess to see if she could help and she saved the day!  She got our drinks refilled immediately and a manager brought my beer over.  He apologized and said to flag him down from that point on.  I will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Love this place...the burgers are great and you get plenty of food for the $$.  Mac and Cheese Burger was legit!  I've been here 5 or 6 different times and I have never left unsatisfied.  The chicken wings were great too!  It is a new place so you have to be patient but I had no problem with the service.  I would say though if your name is Cold Beers and Cheeseburgers the beer could be colder.  With a name like that I expect ice to build up from a super cold beer and frozen mug.  Anyhow, everything I've had has been great!  Don't let me forget..they have a Sh!t load of TV's too.  Great for sports. Super glad they came in and took over that spot!"}
{"text":"The food here and service is really nice. Only thing is that the water doesn't taste very good. Has a weird after taste. I went to Poke spot next door to get water. But besides that, love the food."}
{"text":"Good as far as bar food goes. Staff is friendly enough.  Nice selection of burgers and beer as well. If you like sweeter beers I would check out the white chocolate beer and as far as burgers go the PB&J burger is pretty good."}
{"text":"This is a great place to go to to hang out with friends or to watch sports. I especially love coming here on Mondays because of their Mac and cheese promotion. For $12 you get unlimited toppings. They have a preset menu that you check off what toppings you want which includes all different kinds of vegetables, cheeses and meats. The portions are big enough that you definitely have enough left over for a second meal. Other things on the menu that are good are their tot chos which are nachos made with tots instead of chips. Delicious and not nutritious. You can also make your own s'mores. They bring what looks like a Bunsen burner and you roast your marshmallows over it. This location also has a fireplace outside for the winter time."}
{"text":"Went to another restaurant on Cinco de Mayo but dim since the Kentucky Derby was showing we couldn't get in.  Second choice was Cold Beers & Cheeseburgers. I've never been here but we took our daughter as a reward for earning her orange belt in karate.   Anyhow we couldn't not have been more pleased with the service, food quality and value. I ordered the club sandwich with turkey on wheat toast.  It had avocado, bacon and may have been the best club sandwich I've ever had!!  My daughters got mmmmmmac & cheeseburger and loved it!!   There's tv on the every wall and it was clean.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I love it so far. Sort of....I had the buffalo chicken dip on a quick stop in and I told the manager it was drunk people food. I'll need to down some whiskey before I can enjoy it. He laughed as the whole order was in my take out box to eat later or probably throw away.  If I was as the GM I would have done more then laughed it off! Ya know Phoenix Brew pub is a block away without valet and has great beer and burgers!"}
{"text":"They have fixed their stuff over there. I have actually been back a lot and everything has been solid. My second to last time in I had an issue with a burger (they served it with a dirty knife sticking out of it). I showed the server, he got the managed, and they made a new one. Simple enough. The food has been consistently good, and if you have kids they eat free on Tuesdays as long as you order a meal for yourself. I know that was kind of a run on sentence, but I don't care. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Great food super busy but worth the wait at their 67 ave location

I don't know why this place get such bad reviews it is popular and there's a small weight but the atmosphere is great and the manager super helpful"}
{"text":"Great new location. My burger was delicious and fries were good as well. They have an amazing selection of beer and they even have my favorite on draft - Hoegaarden! Piper was a great server as well!"}
{"text":"Not much to say besides this place has horrible service and the food is typical burger and fries. There is nothing special about the food- the cheese sauce that you get with pretzels is disgusting. The only good item is the specialty chips. I wouldn't waste money here."}
{"text":"I like this place a lot. But just had a bad experience ordering take out. Appears they forgot order and then received cold cheeseburgers and French fries but hot onion rings (which were great).  10-15 minutes became 35-40. I'll think twice before next to go order."}
{"text":"I've passed this place a couple times as I eat at the pizza place across the way so I finally decided to give it a try. They have an assortment of Burgers, Dogs, Salads, and Sandwiches. I had a cheeseburger and it was phenomenal. The meat was juicy and all the veggies were fresh. The bun was warm and super soft. They serve it with a knife stuck in the top so you can immediacy cut into it and see the nice pink center ( I like mine med well ). You can get it with chips or fries. I got it with fries and this is the reason I only give it 4 stars. All of the pictures I saw on yelp show crinkle cut fries but I got regular plan non crinkle cut fries. I'm a sucker for crinkle cut so this really disappoint me. The fries they have now aren't good. BRING BACK THE CRINKLE CUT PLEASE .

As for the service, waitresses were great and super accommodating. It was hard to find them at times but they were very social able. I could tell there were a lot of regulars as I overheard the conversations with others customers around me. The manger was always walking the floor to make sure there was no shenanigans going on. Lots of TVs and great music playing. Will definitely be coming back to try other things on the menu."}
{"text":"Service was OK ... food was meh ... price was OMG! This place won't last long.  Started by ordering a Smithwicks (on all the menus) oh sorry we don't have that anymore. Good I really didn't want to pay $6 for a beer.  Had the honey mustard wings to start they where just so so the blue chesse dressing was nice and chunky that was a plus.  My hangover burger was nothing special I've had better burgers at Denny's.  Over all it was just a disappointment I don't think it will get a second chance."}
{"text":"Bartender took our order from across the noisy bar.  I ordered a chili cheese dog.  When the food arrived 20 minutes later it had chili mac and cheese on it.  When I told the person who delivered it I didn't order mac and cheese on it.  She argued with me that this is how they serve chilli cheese dog.  The other bartender came up and asked what was wrong when I explained I didn't want mac and cheese I just wanted a chili dog,  she said no problem I'll get it fixed I'm sorry.  Fast forward 25 minutes and I receive a lukewarm lunch.  Bartender came by one time as it was being served to me asked if that was what I wanted.  I said yes and was never checked on again.  Original bartender kept walking by ignoring us, no apology, just a snooty look on her face.  We were there for 1 &1/2 hours for lukewarm food that was definitely over priced for what you get and mediocre service.  And management please don't give me the generic response you have given to all the bad reviews.  This is obviously an ongoing problem that has yet to be fixed.   We won't be returning."}
{"text":"We had a gift card for this place, we got the gc for buying Coyotes hockey tickets, turned out to be a great deal.. because this place is a bit pricey for burgers and fries.. 

We were seated right away, the place was busy, lots of tv's playing sports (and the Barrett Jackson car auction) .. it was chilly today so the outside patio was empty..

Our waitress brought us drinks and asked if it was our first time in.. she then made recommendations and gave us a couple minutes to decide.. 

I had the hangover burger with chips.. this was a huge burger with bacon, caramelized onions, grilled tomato & a fried egg (i passed on the jack cheese).. the meat was juicy and seasoned (yes!) flavors worked well together .. the house made kettle chips were great with the burger (there's a $2 upcharge for fries ) 

My bf had the ring of fire.. huge burger with buffalo sauce, jalape√±o rings, an onion ring and covered in melted pepper jack cheese with chips.. he liked the flavors .. 

We enjoyed the passion fruit hard cider also .. saw it in a pic on Yelp (yay!) the drink menu is huge!!

Our waitress was friendly and checked on us several times.. we will be back!! They have s'mores on the dessert menu.. I need that in my life!"}
{"text":"Went there today for lunch and was very pleased.  It was a little after 1pm but they were still pretty crowded so that was a good sign.  Our server was very friendly and our burgers were great.  I really like the buns.  We both had the juicy lucy (or something like that) with the cheese cooked inside the meet.  Good stuff.  We also had onion rings and home made chips, both were great but the onion rings won the challenge.

Looks like a great place to grab a beer and watch a game  too, the place is wallpapered with tvs, and has a nice selection of beer.  They have outside seating and televisions mounted out there as well.  Definitely worth checking out.  Prices were reasonable our burger and $10 each.  Yum."}
{"text":"Listen, yes it was crowded, and we did wait a little bit for our food but that was acknowledged. Our bartender gave us a free beer and we sat at the bar so we didn't even wait to get a seat. The turkey burger was 10 out of 10 the coleslaw was good and we were here for mac & cheese Monday with unlimited toppings which was totally bomb as well. I'm just glad to have a couple of good things over here on the west side of the valley. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Probably the best burger in Scottsdale!

Be sure to visit at lunch on Wednesday when their Build-Your-Own-Burger is the special. Never had a bad burger on any of my 3-4 visits. Never too busy. Only complaint is that food can take longer than it should, but it won't stop me from coming back."}
{"text":"Average bar food in and average setting. The waitresses could care less about quality service. If you go for lunch, expect it to be a two hour lunch since they must have a one armed special needs hire working the grill. If they screw up your order, don't even expect them to acknowledge it. I eat at a lot of places for lunch, it's my favorite meal of the day, today is the last day for this place. Go there at your own risk."}
{"text":"Ever week customer, stopped by today, was told they were all out of any white wine on happy hour at 5pm, bartender said there was no other option unless you wanted to pay more...really...what is wrong with the management of this place."}
{"text":"Brand new sports bar in the area. We came in here for happy hour and lived the burgers and the beer. The prices were really reasonable and they have free valet parking which was a nice plus. If you are looking for a good happy hour or just a spot to watch the game this place fits the bill. Would have given them five stars, but the service is a little slow, but not horrendous."}
{"text":"Burgers are very good. Lots of options. A little expensive in my opinion. Great Caesar chicken salad. Cold beer, great value at happy hour. The only reason for the 4 stars is the layout sucks. If you're stuck having to sit inside at a table you feel like people are crawling all over you. Very uncomfortable to be able to relax. Sitting at the bar is awesome and sitting out side is awesome."}
{"text":"They definitely need to work on some things! Service is slow. Food is coming out subpar...I had the Asian Chicken Salad. It was sliced deli meat and SO much of it I felt like I was eating sandwich meat with Asian dressing. Gross! Our Mac n cheese and tater tots were barely warm. We sent some things back and they tried to correct it which was appreciated but at that point we needed our check. This also seemed very confusing for our server to spilt.. With Blue 32 down the street they are going to have to step it up. The food and service has to be better or they will lose the momentum of this new crowd. Hopefully they will work out their kinks."}
{"text":"I SHOULD HAVE READ THE REVIEWS. Overpriced, undercooked and an up charge of $2 for fries. What surprised me was how busy they were. With so many places far superior to spend your hard earned money at..... Really people. Stop the madness or demand better."}
{"text":"Great food great place staff was AWSOME!!...really not much I could say..just said it simple and quick..we will see you guys again soon!!..thanks!!!.."}
{"text":"I have visited Cold Beer & Cheeseburgers on four separate occasions at 3 different locations, but they all left me feeling the same...underwhelmed. They do have a decent beer selection and that's nice, but the food is nothing special. The burgers I have tried (The Jucy Lucy-Fer, CB & CB, and Arizona) have been just okay. I could have had any one of the burgers made at home and would have tasted just as good, so it isn't worth 12+ to me. Last time I was there, I tried some different items including the hell fire chips, the wings and the prime rib sandwich. The chips were soggy and really just tasted like franks red hot, eh. The sandwich was okay, didn't have much flavor and it was a small amount of meat, especially for the price. I would say that Cold Beer and Cheeseburgers is an okay place to hangout and have a beer because it does have a lively atmosphere, but for me personally, I would not go there for the food."}
{"text":"Excellent food, excellent service. We loved the buffalo chicken tots and the PB&J burger!!"}
{"text":"Very nice place for lunch. The atmosphere is cool and loud! I like that there are so many TV's, perfect for watching a game or just enjoying the shows / sports on. The only thing I think could have been better was the bun on the burger. It was yellow and tasted dry, but I blame myself for not asking the waitress about the bun before I ordered. Fun place! Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"The name says it all. The burgers are massive and their Mac and cheese options are amazing.

Great food, place is always busy."}
{"text":"OVERPRICED & BAD SERVICE/POOR MANAGEMENT 

On my visit, the first 10 minutes was excellent service. The waitress then stated \"food ticket is up in line and will be out shortly.\" After this, did not see waitress for 32 minutes, then food arrived. By the way, the restaurant at this point was nearly empty. 

Wasn't till my table asked a new waitress what's the status, then as the new waitress proceeded to the back, she came out with the food. As if the food had been just sitting there... 

When our food arrived, deliberately asked for NO cheese and add onion (as waitress repeated when taking order/wrote down). When she took plate to the kitchen and brought plate back, it had no cheese, but was STILL missing onions. 

The waitress to say the least was not attentive. When speaking with the manager, he could only really defend the bad service which put my family and I unease. 

Will not return."}
{"text":"Great place, 1st time at this location but just as good as the 1st place I tried in Scottsdale"}
{"text":"Im not a big fan of this place, but my husband and kid loves it.... so, I ordered a healthy choice meal... chicken and asparagus was passable... but the \"roma\" tomatoes were questionable... those 2 slices on my plate were def not roma tomatoes. The waitress was Jordan who was very pleasant and professional--- but back to the roma tomatoes ... when I asked why I had 2 meagre slices of generic blah tomatoes I was brought back a plate of grilled mushy and as seen in the pics, again was not roma tomatoes.
For god sake restaurants provide what you advertise ."}
{"text":"food tasted delish... until the long blonde hair found in the food... The manager pulled and twisted it in his fingers to see if it was indeed hair and said \"we have no blonde staff\"... I guess he didn't account for our server with the long blonde hair"}
{"text":"This place is aptly named. You can get cold beers and cheeseburgers here. However, they should have named it \"Phenomenal Beers and Cheeseburgers\". 

So, I greatly enjoyed this place. I had the Cincinnati Dog (I know...I didn't order a cheeseburger at a place with cheeseburger in its name...) but it was really good! It had chili, diced onions, and aged white cheddar (!!!). We shared that, and then we also shared the MMMac and Cheeseburger. Yes, this is a burger with mac & cheese on it. It was equally as sublime as the dog. Also, we had beers that we chose from their selection of 100. 

Just delightful....delightfully freaking good!"}
{"text":"Best ever comfort food I've had!!! The Chili MAC & Cheese was to die for & so we're the sweet potato tots!! I'll definitely be wrecking my diet here again... the calories were well worth it!!!"}
{"text":"The food was excellent.  However the service was TERRIBLE!!! The waitress (Ashley) was too tired to even stand at the table to take out order and had to squat down on the ground.  She was yawning while taking our order and was not friendly at all. The person who brought our food to the table (not sure of her name) asked me to grab my plate out of her hands and set it on the table for her.  I made a comment that it was hot and I had never been asked to do that before and she didn't seem to care and just repeated herself, asking me to take the plate from her.  The waitress seemed very distracted and was less than helpful. This was disappointing because the atmosphere was great and so was the food but the service was not satisfactory."}
{"text":"The people here are actually pretty nice and helpful. The burger wasn't that great but what I really liked were the tot-chos. YOU HAVE TO GET THESE. AMAZING!!! really unhealthy but so delicious. They have some great flatscreen's too and they offer coke products which is nice because I love orange fanta. Definitely check this place out."}
{"text":"Pretty good burger.  Service was friendly and attentive and I really love those brioche buns.  
I will say, the whole food challenge thing, while not for me (the last thing I need is a bunch of people gathering around to watch me eat)  creates quite the hoopla.  The hungry bear of a man attempting it while I was there attracted quite the crowd.  Good times."}
{"text":"Uneducated staff and Cooks. Should be called cold burgers. Entire order was wrong, sent back all came back cold."}
{"text":"Meh pretty much describes my experience here.  Came in on a Sunday afternoon for a family birthday dinner.  Things started out great as we were quickly seated at a large table in the noisy patio area.  We like sitting outside, but this is where the joy ended at CB&C.

There is an extensive list of draft/canned/bottled beers and a large menu of appetizers, salads, Mac and Cheese, dogs and, of course, burgers.  You can get one of their designer burgers, or build your own.  I can't get past the price of a standard hot dog, nearly $10 with potato chips, but whatever.  I didn't order one.  I did have a tasty Kiltlifter though.

We all ordered burgers, I personally had the Jucy Lucy-fer as did the FSIL.  Everyone else in my group is vegetarian, so they had the veggie burger, mac and cheese or whatever meatless thing they could find.  We ordered some Onion Rings for an appetizer.

The rings arrived first, by a dour server, who just dropped off the bowl in the middle of the table.  Not a word was said as he quickly disappeared, Leaving nothing but a bowl of dry onion rings.  Sauces were not delivered or offered, not that we had a chance to ask.  Who eats onion rings dry?  Seems like maybe catsup, or my favorite, Ranch Dressing could accompany this dish.  About ten minutes later, the burgers and other stuff arrives.  My medrare arrived medwell, as did the FSIL's.  Nobody checked back.  Even being over-cooked, the burger was juicy and flavorful, with a decent hint of hotness, but nothing to be afraid of, despite the dire warnings on the menu.  Others had tater tots which came out nice and crispy.

Eventually, the check arrived.  Service was....well, unexceptional to the point of mundane.  Taking your order, dropping off food and check, and pretty much nothing else.  The patio and dining room are surrounded by televisions all tuned to various sporting events and some raucous music.  The patio table we sat at was directly under this fan thing with a mister embedded, the fan speed was such that it felt like we were sitting under a waterfall - but it was really good at cooling our food off fast.

So, I was curious about this location in my neighborhood and I'm glad that I gave them a chance, but disappointed that it was so mediocre.

No.  I won't be back.  I can think of a few places in my neighborhood that can do burgers way better and cheaper.  Some of them are fast-food places, which I only go to under duress, but when you got to, you got to."}
{"text":"Well, we were excited about a local spot, living less than a mile away... Disappointing though...

Why can't restaurants offer good food at a reasonable price with good service anymore?

It's a just a darn burger.... Too expensive for just a burger no matter how you dress it up...

3 of us thought the food was OK.. Nothing to write home to mom about.... Until my wife pulled an 8\" long strand of hair out of her sandwich!!!  Nasty... We all stopped eating, paid and left...

We then noticed how many servers have large heads of great hair, long and flowing all over the place.  

How about a new house rule to pull your hair back so it's not in the food?

Will go back for drinks, but not for food..."}
{"text":"The best thing about this place is the service. The food was great as well, but I felt like I always had what I needed because of the service. Would come back because of the hospitality!! Shannon is the best staff member here. Ask for her."}
{"text":"Great 1st time experience. Jen was so helpful and the service was great. Sonoran White Chocolate Beer on draft was awesome. Food was great. Thank you Jen!"}
{"text":"Had dinner here on Fathers Day. With that said, it was fairly busy! We had about a 45 minute wait to be seated. 
All started off fine. We were a party of 5.
Ordered the appetizer Buffalo Chicken Tots. The chicken had a great flavor, the Tots were crispy. A ranch dressing was drizzled on top! They were really good however, we thought the dish was on the salty side?!
We ALL ordered burgers for our main meal. 2 CBCB Burgers, 2 Steakhouse Truffle Burgers & the Denver Burger. You will have the choice of a side. At an additional fee you can order Onion Rings which I did. Everyone else had the fries. Burgers were cooked just as we requested and the presentation was great. The disappointment was ALL the food was so salty; we couldn't get through the meal. It was EVERYTHING we bit into. My caramelized onions were uneatable saltier than the sea. All of our meals were ruined by the over abundance of salt including all the sides.
We made our server aware and the manger took care of the problem. Didn't visit our table, just made an adjustment to our bill. We were told that \"other complaints\" were made as well. Also were told the cooks were new. With being new, they should know how to measure & not sabotage a business. 
I would give this place another shot if they train their cooks to lessen the seasoning, so you can experience that natural juicy taste of the meal. Service was good, staff ok. Appreciated  management making it right, and will be back again."}
{"text":"Excellent. Great service, great tasting food. Positive and upbeat atmosphere. I can't wait to come again. The name says it all.!"}
{"text":"Food was great, but I didn't enjoy how noisy it was without being full. Yes it was during a football game, but it wasn't even half full. The Buffalo Tatchos are fantastic!!! Highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"10/10 would recommend this restaurant! Employees have good energy & the food is fantanstic! Tv's wrap around the whole joint so every spot is a good one!!"}
{"text":"The food was pretty good. But I am giving them one star because I could not believe how unbelievably rude all of the wait staff was. The hostess was very unwelcoming and got annoyed when we waited at the bar. We got seated and were immediately questioned by the waitstaff if we were allowed to be seated there. On the bright side our bartender, Gary, was super awesome and very friendly!!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with family and friends food was good service was not as good. We were on the patio and had a party of 8 and the waitress refused to leave the side of the table and go to the side farthest from her. She took all orders from the point and only serviced that end of the table. That  end of the table was cleared drinks refilled while the other end was thirsty and we still had our entree and appetizer plates sitting there. Not until we passed it down to the end of the table would she even touch them. Been here a few times and have never had issues, she wasn't that busy she just seemed like she didn't want to bother with the other side of the table. We will be back for the delicious food but hopefully not the same waitress!"}
{"text":"LOVE this place! Its the sister to Arcadia Tavern and while it is no AT, you get the same neighborhood bar feel.

Plus, they have superb tots!

YUM!"}
{"text":"Favorite Chandler bar hands down. Burgers are great, staff is great, and they have a large selection of craft beers. If you like IPAs, there is always a few to choose from."}
{"text":"Went to this place for a date night!! The food is amazing!! We had the tot-chos first and then mac n' cheese and a burger! Seriously delicious! Such an amazing vibe we'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I got carry out from here. It was tasty. I got the PB&J Burger. I know it doesn't sound good but it was pretty amazing. I also got onion rings with a side of honey mustard. The hostess was nice and helped to get my order quickly."}
{"text":"Yes!!!!! Please. Went today for dinner with my family. The tv screens had my boys (ages 10&12) in a sports game frenzy. They literally didn't know where to focus. We had an amazing waitress who was patient with us because we needed time figuring out which delicious burgers to get. We got wings and mozzarella sticks for appetizers. I ordered a bacon PB&J burger which I've never had in my life....amazing. Just unbelievably yummy which I hoped for and didn't expect to enjoy as much as I did! My son got the Arizona burger he said he loved but couldn't finish...these burgers are big! I will recommend this place and will go back."}
{"text":"Have now eaten at several of their locations: food is pretty consistent every visit. Can be very (very) loud when there is a game on but it is a sports bar so if you're looking for quiet this is not the place. Buffalo chicken egg rolls are excellent, great burgers. Can be hard to get into on a Friday night so go early. Nice to see a local place doing so well, they have new locations popping up everywhere."}
{"text":"Their service is terrible. Our waitresses both times was inattentive. We had to go to the bar multiple times or ask other people for our food and check. My husband had a business lunch there and he had the same service. Their food is mediocre."}
{"text":"Huge and tasty burgers! Service can be a little slow but it's worth the wait. I tried the O'Lineman burger with my wife..definitely split it or bring an extremely empty stomach because this bad boy will fill you up."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere for watching sports. Fun staff and a large beer selection. Burgers aren't the best and are over priced, however, the atmosphere is worth it."}
{"text":"Wtf is with the parking? The scottsdale one is worth the drive still... The burgers are good yet over priced. Typical chandler atmosphere..."}
{"text":"Burgers look good ... Was not hot.. Ordered it med. well.. It was very pink .. Salad was great ... Service very very slow..... Drinks very iffy... Would not recommend ... Beer is great ... But I'm not a beer drinker ... They ran of a liquor ... And they add 18 percent gratuity to bill ! I tip according to service .. Got another drink after my group left... And they charged another 18 percent on a group of seven!"}
{"text":"Waited 20 minutes to even see a waitress it was not busy at all . Then waited an hour  for food . Left without receiving our food . Complained to the manager . Will not be coming back again."}
{"text":"Oddly enough I've never been here but we have it catered at my work all the time. It's just down the street from me and I'm tempted to go in sometime. The sliders and the Mac & cheese are absolutely out of this world and I have to say for never having actually visited the restaurant I'm compelled to recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"Not good. Can't say anything about the food since we were never served. Left after 20 min of waiting. One server said she'd try to find someone to help us. Never mind...good bye."}
{"text":"I REALLY want to give this place 5 stars because the food is awesome. The burgers are great (Arizona burger is a personal fav); Buffalo Chicken Egg Rolls? Say no more, ah-ma-zing! Great bar food and the portion sizes are huge. The only reason I am giving this place a 3 stars is cause the service at this location seriously LACKS. I was so excited when this place opened since I no longer had to travel to Old Town when craving a burger. But I had not been to this location in awhile, and visited on Valentines day, and the hostess were not friendly or personable at ALL. How come every time i visit I get a waitress that could care less about checking in on our table? Its not like I want to be bugged every 5 minutes asking how things are, but I would like to be checked in for re-fills or extra napkins. Our waitress seemed like it was a huge task to bring us more water. Other than the lack of personable workers, or sucky service you cannot go wrong with the food. If you wanted good service along with the food, I would suggest going to the Old Town Location. I have never had trouble with service there!"}
{"text":"This is a fantastic restaurant! And I don't review restaurants very often. The food was awesome, the service was great, and they were very accommodating when it actually got cold here. They moved us under a heater and there was 12 of us. 
Great job!"}
{"text":"We come here all the time, it took a while to get through their cheeseburger list! Well worth it! Amazing food always, great staff! 
I will say we came here once for dinner, they were very busy. It was great, however there was a long wait for everything. So we stick to lunches on Sunday's! 
It's a popular place, keep in mind these servers actually have a conversation with you, as well as the other customers. So there may be a time where you wait for a minute! Always worth it!
This place should have 5 stars! 
I'd give my review more but 5 is the limit!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty darn good. The service was good, the food came out quickly, and was very good. They have a huge beer list and a pretty decent happy hour menu."}
{"text":"Friday night Oct. 24-14 some friends and myself decided to head out for drinks and a meal. We ended up at Cold Beers and Cheeseburgers at Gray Hawk in Scottsdale. The place was slammed so we sat at the bar until we could grab a table. I didn't think that that we would have such awesome service due to the fact that they were so busy but to my surprise we did. The bartender a tall dude was right on our order. We never had to wait for a refill on our drinks. I think his name was Todd if memory serves me. I appreciate good service with a smile,  due to the fact they were slammed or anytime  We were seated in 30 mins. Our waitress I think her name was Kendall was great. Again being slammed  she was right on our order with a smile.I had the cheeseburger called Hangover it was delicious and the caramelized onions on the burger was the perfect touch. I need to mention we had an orange type of draft beer. The bartender highly recommend it. It was very good. I'll have that beer again for sure ! There were 5 of us and yes we all would go back to Cold beers. We all had an awesome time and the service was top notch. I  need to mention they have TV's so if any are wanting to watch a Football game of choice they have it playing. Great place to gather, wonderful food , drinks, and service."}
{"text":"So my friend and I decided to check out this place, it's right near her house and we wanted a nice cold beer and some appetizers...when we walked in the place was packed, which is to be expected on a Friday night. We were seated quickly outside (which we wanted) when we sat down we noticed a large group of drunk out of state golfers... a bit noisy but we understood, plus the view was nice :) our waitress cameover, two of them actually  (one was in training) asked us if we wanted to start off with drinks, I ordered the Papago Orange Bloosom as did my friend, it was delicious! After looking over the menu I decided to order the soft pretzel, and my friend got the mozzarella sticks. After about 15 min our food was brought over by I believe the busboy? Maybe he was the food runner, who knows. We didn't have any napkins or silverware so I had to flag someone down as our servers were nowhere to be found. The food was decent, I had asked for ranch though bc i didn't like the sauce that came with the pretzel, I was half way done by the time the ranch came, waitress was apologizing consider \"she forgot\" by this time the crowd had died down and it was a ghost town... the topper of this experience was after we had our apps my friend wanted dessert so she ordered the s'mores, waitress put it in her order, after 20min of waiting she came back to tell us that unfortunately they had no chocolate. Uh ok....so we decided to order the brownie sundae instead, after waiting another 15 min she came back to tell us that their ice cream was \"runny\" n was unable to make us our sundae either. At this point we were over having dessert and wanted to leave. Our server was very sweet and apologetic, offered to take care of our apps and one beer, she then said that her manager refused to come talk to us, and told her to tell us the bad news. I've worked in many bars and restaurants and I'm sorry but the first thing a manager should is come out and apologize themselves for this, what the hell is the manager doing that's so important then making sure their guests are ok. That's what management is there for. I was fine with the hiccups on the napkin and silverware and the dessert issue I was more disgusted at how the management there is anything but up to par. I don't think we will be back, and I plan to share this with people I know."}
{"text":"Service was great and food came out fairly quickly and cooked the way we like. The fries however were hot but not crispy. The burger was juicy and cooked perfectly to medium. I enjoyed the PB&J Burger, the jam with the peanut butter sauce with the cheddar cheese and hickory smoked bacon was pretty amazing. Music was at a great level for a bar with plenty of sporting options on the myriad of tvs throughout the restaurant."}
{"text":"So insanely expensive for a burger that doesn't even come with fries! What??? You pay $15 for a burger with chips??? I've literally never heard of any restaurant serving a burger and chips. What the actual hell are they thinking??? There are so many better and less expensive places within 1-2 miles- Zipps, Zinburger, Phoenix Ale, Sierra Bonita just to name a few. You may be able to swindle the wealthy in Scottsdale with these prices but no thanks from  this CenPho family. We won't be back."}
{"text":"We did return last week for the first time in about a year.  This time we arrived early and didn't have to hike the parking lot.  However the service this time really was sub-par.  Twice I had to wave my arms to flag my waitress down to get her to visit the table, refill drinks, etc.  

Aside from the service, here's the thing that drops my rating to two stars:  I ordered onion rings with my burger.  When my food arrived, there was no ranch, bbq sauce or other condiment to dip my rings in.  I asked for some dressing.  When I got the bill I found I was charged for a couple ounces of dressing.  Now, when you charge between $11 and $18 for a burger and chips, do you REALLY need to tack on another 50 cents for a small condiment serving.  It's not the amount, it's that you have to nickel and dime your customers when your prices are already premium.  I could buy a pizza and feed a family of four for what you charge for a cheeseburger and chips.  Do you really need to add that extra .50??

This time, in order to keep the tab in the two figure range, we skipped the beers.  It was \"Cold Water and Cheeseburgers\", LOL!!  I was genuinely surprised the water was free.

Again, just to balance the review, the food was, as always, amazing.  The host staff at the front door was friendly and we were welcomed and seated quickly.  We will probably be back.  Unlike other restaurants in the area, CBCB is not one that we will visit with any regularity.

Edit: One last thing.  If you get the \"Juicy Lucy\" burger (my first time), don't cut it in half.  There is a hunk of melted cheese in the center that liquifies as it cooks and will squirt all over your clean shirt and shorts the minute you plunge a knife into the burger, thus ending the \"Juicy\" part of \"Lucy\" and leaving you with a dried out burger and a laundry pre-soak job.  Careful biting into it also."}
{"text":"Food was good. Service was good. Great beer selection. Awesome patio. Just a bit high in price on some items."}
{"text":"The menu is not revolutionary but it's well executed and very tasty. CBCB is a great place to watch a game. Great views of the monitors fork all locations. The staff at this location is FANTASTIC!!! They can't do enough to make you happy. Tonight our server Sammy went way above and beyond. The manager Charles was also wonderful and very attentive. This is where you want to come to watch a game."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great food every time, as well as a great selection of beers & yummy cocktails. The Draft Paloma is awesome. Love that they have healthy options as well. The service here is always pretty great too- something I could not  say about most places I visit. Cold Beers will continue to be my go-to neighborhood spot!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this neighborhood joint!  The happy hour is great-buy one get one free appetizers,$5.00 drafts. (Yes, please!) I love the tot-chos, tator-tots done like nachos, so good. I have had the burgers, the signature one, the blue cheese one and the chili cheese one. All were cooked perfectly and they are hugely delicious. I have always found the service to be great and the staff to be very friendly. The atmosphere is expected for a burger/sports place. TV's placed everywhere for optimal sports watching views, I do wish they had buzz-time trivia but that's just a personal preference.  I would highly recommend this place for anyone looking for a great beer selection, great food and a great neighborhood experience."}
{"text":"I was very much looking forward to what I thought would be a great experience.  Sorry to say I was very much disappointed;  I ordered a pastrami burger for over 15.00 dollars, let's just say what came was a tasteless burger topped with pastrami strips that left the taste of cheap balony.  We asked for a extra slice of pickle but what came were four pickle slices. Potatoes chips also came but were cold and greasy.
Our first clue should have been we arrived at the height of lunch hour and the place was virtually empty.  
What a shame, my suggestion they might have given more thought to the food and not so much the over kill of TV's

{"text":"We have been to this location many times because we really like the food (even if it is pricey) We will not be going back after we have continually received terrible service. They seat us right away and then forget about us. We have had to flag someone down almost every time. We try to place our food order with our drink order because when they leave they take forever to return. We end up with a grumpy 3 year old every time we go there because it takes about an hour to get our food from the time we sit down. There really is no excuse for this type of service."}
{"text":"Nasty burgers, super greasy, just gross food. Bad service, the wait staff and even the host didn't seems to care much about customer service. We got the wrong order, then we were ignored for about 20 min then we both left to use the restroom and our table was cleared!!! What a joke. Never again."}
{"text":"Some really great food, but the service was subpar on our first visit. Granted, it was quite busy, but I still expected better service than what we received. I look forward to going back to see if it is any better."}
{"text":"Second visit to this chain.  Cold beer yes, Cheeseburgers yes.  Great, not so much.  Onion rings were good but burger was so so...went with the Kobi special?  Nothing special....bar tender shared TMI.  Probably not coming back to this location as my favorite bar and food is just down the street...name withheld to protect my seat at the bar."}
{"text":"Not a typical place I frequent due to being vegetarian, vegan, or raw depending on what day it is. 
Met up with a group of friends for a special occasion. They do not take reservations so we decided to wait it out at the bar. 
(Lots of beers to choose from)
Was seated within a very reasonable amount of time. Attentive & friendly staff. 

Thankfully they had a veggie burger so I wasn't stuck just eating sides.
(They also have a gluten free menu)
Had it Rocky Point style without the sour cream and cheese. (guacamole, pico de gallo, & jalape√±o's).
Got a spicy Michelada to go with.
What a great combo! Very tasty!
All in all a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"Where do I start... want a good hangout place? Or a place to watch games? Come here!!!! Good food, great service, good environment. The burgers are so fresh and the appetizers are so yummy.. beer selections are on point. Definitely one of my spots. Come here to watch football games. The people here are awesome"}
{"text":"I told Sally she had to do dinner and she chose Cold beer and cheeseburgers. 
Excelent choice, great burgers and service.
Will be back many times!!!!"}
{"text":"Can someone please explain to me why fries and tots cost the same amount when you order them as sides, yet you have to pay an extra $2 to get tots instead of fries on the side of a meal...? I don't understand the logic. 

Onion dip is good, the grilled cheese was boring and dry. Lacked the creamy factor you usually find in a good grilled cheese. 

Only giving it three stars because I haven't tried any of the stuff you normally would get there like the burgers and mac and cheese."}
{"text":"Overpriced mediocre food. 

Mac and cheese night was a bust with the wrong order delivered then in attempt to make it right undercooked mac and cheese delivered. It was a bowl of watery pasta with our choice of toppings. It was soup really. So gross. I couldn't even eat it. 

Fries and onion rings ordered were good. That got two stars.

Our waitress was fine when we finally had someone come by the table. My boyfriend started at the bar and when i got there we moved to a table. after 15 minutes at a table I had to go to the hostess and ask for a server on the patio.

The manager did come over and offer gift cards to make up for the Mac and cheese but sadly this wasn't our first non-stellar service here so we probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Some of these reviewers are people I would not want to have a conversation with in real life. This place is great and you should definitely check it out. Definitely a \"foodie\" type joint, with a great selection of craft beer as well on tap. I wish they were open later, but that is grayhawk for you."}
{"text":"Not impressed with the service. We came here to watch the Redskins game and grab some lunch. All the servers and hostesses were rude. After 20 minutes they told us our table was ready, but they gave it away to someone else on accident and we had to wait another 20 minutes for a table. They didn't apologize or offer any complimentary or discounted items for our inconvenience. The flat screens had designated games they were supposed to play, but we missed the first part of the game because they didn't know how to work the TVs. Overall horrible experience and wouldn't recommend this place if you're looking for a good time and friendly service."}
{"text":"Everything we had was awesome, juicy burgers and the jumbo pretzel were over the top."}
{"text":"Just stopped in here tonight to have some dinner and drinks with some co-workers. Hannah was our server and she was great. I asked her about the PB &J burger and she said it was her favorite so I gave it a try and it was re di cu lous!!!!  I told her I needed some more napkins and I swear she cut down a tree and brought me a hundred napkins. Best service ever."}
{"text":"We came to the Cold Beers and Cheeseburgers  on 7st we sat at the bar and was greeted by a great bartender Sean!  Spoke to us and asked first of all on a 106 degree day to get us some water!  Yes!!Then a couple of drinks,  after that he kept coming back asking what we needed if anything! We ordered wings extra crispy they were fantastic!! 
Ordered a side of ranch and got wing sauce. 
Then ordered a burger and split it called the Denver,  it was off the charts! Got to do an egg on it! 
Nothing but great things to say about Cold Beers & Cheeseburgers on 7st. And bartender Sean! 
Great job!"}
{"text":"This place is REALLY good! Loved the burger and the sweet potato nuggets are great! Definitely recommend them if you like sweet potato. I would suggest maybe a dipping sauce for them as ketchup kills it for me. Can't wait to go back and see if they still live up to the great first experience!"}
{"text":"The Build Your Own Burger is the best deal in town! Well, when it's served to you by Vanessa, it is.
Love this place!


Disclaimer:
Vanessa, the bartender, not the server, though I'm sure the server is nice, too."}
{"text":"I'm a big burger fan, I tried nearly every burger in NYC when I lived there. Listen \"foodies\" let's understand that this is a chain, so if you're crying about your experience, spend more than $10 on a burger or be quiet. This burger is good, not great, and not horrible. I didn't come into this place expecting a Minetta Tavern burger and that's why I wasn't disappointed."}
{"text":"Went here early this week for lunch. Restaurant was clean. Got seated right away... got our drinks fast....but 1 burger and 1 sandwich took over an hour to get! We actually ordered a to go order 30 minutes after we ordered our original order and it came out before our original order. When our food finally came I questioned the long wait and order of our food. The manager said they came from separate parts of the kitchen and gave us a $5 off our next visit card.  Our bill for lunch for 3 (including 2 beers) was $67 + tip...  Burger was okay, but not worth the price in my opinion. This place always looks to be packed... maybe I just unlucky.... maybe the building is cursed (since no place has made it there)."}
{"text":"Was so excited to see something replace The Dirty Pelican. Attempted to go in on opening week, but, the music was so loud, turned around and left.

Waited another couple of weeks and tried again. Music was turned down a bit more and sat at the bar. I agree with other reviews that the service staff seemed very inexperienced and we had to \"get their attention\" to get second round of drinks. The food was just so-so, burger was very rare instead of medium well. The bar top was so uncomfortable on my forearms. There is a raised metal ridge along the entire top making it impossible to rest your arms. The lack of eye contact from the service staff shows their lack of experience. The prices are too high for the quality of food (burgers) and for drinks. Why would I pay $8-10 for a mixed drink when I can get same for $5.00 at Tailgaters and the food is just as good and cheaper.

Maybe they will rethink there prices as that keeps me away the most."}
{"text":"Jenna is awesome! She remembered ours names and that's no easy task! The burgers she recommend were pleasing to the soul!!!
Tons of beer and burger options!"}
{"text":"Good burger. Too loud for me. Took a while to pay my bill and I was at the bar. Only came with chips. Fries I think are extra."}
{"text":"My sister's bragged about this place. I was anticipating it to be out of this world. It was ok. Nothing special. Asked for a medium well burger and it was dry. Had the steak truffle burger. The buffalo chicken egg rolls were good. Red Robins tastes way better and cheaper. Our server was nice. Got 10% off for checking in."}
{"text":"Good food, but kinda pricy. Service is hit and miss. Can get very busy, to the point of being uncomfortable. Of course all the burgers are good, but the Grayhawk Club is awesome. Oh, and the beers are super cold."}
{"text":"Terrific black-and-blue Burger and service at outside bar was a pleasure...Looking forward to my next  burger and brew....."}
{"text":"This is a great new restaurant in the Grayhawk area!  This restaurant is owned by the same people that own Arcadia Tavern in Phoenix. 

The burger was fantastic; they have a large selection of burgers on the menu but I had the Ring of Fire without the jalapeno with fries; it was only $10.  They also have a huge selection of beers at this place and several TV's to watch football or sportscenter. 

I will be back very soon..."}
{"text":"The service was outstanding. I love the food and the overall set up of the place. We will be moving close by very soon and will become regulars, for sure."}
{"text":"I came here with a few friends on St. Patrick's Day. It was still early and we thought we'd grab a bite while we waited for another friend to get off work.  The bar wasnt busy yet so we were surprised when the waitress told us that it would take a half hour to cook any burger we may order. That's a really long time for a burger in an empty restaurant but, we decided we'd order anyway. We all decided to build our own burgers and when the burgers came out, 2 of our burgers had the ingredients mixed up. Instead of being apologetic, the waitress tried to argue that the mistake was ours. We had to physically compare the burgers we received, to the burgers on the byob slip, before she'd admit they'd made a mistake. The horrible service,  partnered with the fact that they were out of two different beers, we tried to order, on their own beer menu, made for a horrible start to the evening. MY burger was made correctly and was delicious, so I'll give them that, but I will not be returning to this establishment."}
{"text":"Extremely underwhelmed and we were so excited about trying it out!  We were bummed because a restaurant with the word cheeseburgers in it s name should be serving awesome burgers. Even though we ordered our burgers medium rare, they weren't juicy at all. Frozen fries and tator tots were average. 
Bright spots were a delightful server and our daughter s Bloody Mary.  Not enough reason to return.  Zinburger, Vintage 95, and Pitta Souvli all have outstanding burgers!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time.  We both had drinks. He ordered a build your own burger, I had the grilled cheese since I'm a vegetarian.  We also got a pretzel. We ate everything.  It was great.  Will go back.  Would have given 5 stars if we didn't have to wait for drinks and the waitresses to figure out who's section we were in."}
{"text":"A great place to get a custom burger. Today was my first time eating at this place. I went there at 7 p.m. on Saturday, July 1st. The place was very loud at first, but I got used to the noice after a while. I ordered a custom burger which immediately became my favorite. I will definitely be back soon. Also, I would like to add that our waitress was fantastic. Friendly, informative and very attentive. I highly recommend this place! 

P.S. 
A couple of tables from us there was a family with a young 11ish boy eating a burger, therefore, even though this place has a bar and serves alcohol, I saw a child eating a burger.

Also, I would like to mention that we did not have any alcoholic beverages, therefore, I cannot comment on the beer quality."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. My favorite burger is the Bacon PB & J. It may sound different, but you have to give it a try!  The bloody mary bar on Saturday's and Sunday's is delicious too! The service is always on point and the management is just as awesome. They are very accommodating to the tv changes too. If you haven't been, you should give it a try!"}
{"text":"This is my second visit to this location. The first visit was 4 days after it opened. It did not go well. I never review a new spot until my second visit. The venue is awesome for riding your bike and watching the game. There are lots of TVs and the brand new patio is great. The food is slightly above average. The buffalo cheese dip is really good. The Mac and Cheese is good, but the Buddha version was a bit watery. The service is super friendly and above average for a sports bar.  If watching a game in the Arcadia area is your plan, this spot is legit. I would say it is slightly better than Arcadia Tavern - based on layout and TV placement. Food is similar in quality. FYI I would give them 3.5 stars, if that option was available."}
{"text":"My favorite sports bar! Great addition to the neighbors and food ain't bad either. Waaaaay better option than twin peaks. Oh AND you can check in through help if there's a wait."}
{"text":"Best cold beer I've had in a while--plus the ladies are smokin'. The motz sticks are bomb and I highly recommend them. Great and timely service. 


I need more words so I can get 10% off, thank you."}
{"text":"I came in last night. I am a restaurant manager myself. The food and my server were amazing. Only two stars because of the lack of help from the staff towards the manager. This kid was working hard. Another deduction came from the server that was talking down about her manager. Amy was my derby and did great. I asked her who a certain server was and she said her name was Alex. Nothing wrong with her service other than standing around behind your host stand a lot. Her talking crap about the manager that was doing more than anyone else in the restaurant is NOT ok in my book. Hope this is seen by the right person because I would honestly fire her if she worked for me."}
{"text":"So, Cold Beer and Cheeseburgers used to be my favorite place to go for burgers, mac and cheese, appetizers and salad.  However, they made a change to something that really not a good change in my opinion.  Instead of serving fresh made salad dressings as they have since they opened, they decided to change to a bottled brand.  I know most people wouldn't think that is a big deal, but it is.  When you serve ranch dressing with appetizers, and one of your best burgers features a salad dressing, the freshness of homemade salad dressings makes a big difference.  We still love their burgers, mac and cheese and appetizers, but in my mind they took a big step backwards when they decided to settle for a bottled dressing instead of fresh."}
{"text":"We came here on a Friday night Several
Weeks ago.  We waited 45 minutes for a table. Not that big of a deal. We ordered our food and it took almost 35 minutes for 2 burgers. When they came out, both were wrong. My husband ordered a plain cheeseburger and they obviously had made it wrong in the kitchen and tried to (unsuccessfully) scrape all the stuff off the burger. When he asked for a new one, he was told it would be another 20 minutes because the kitchen was too busy. This was by the manager. He was not very professional and just walked away in the middle if the conversation. Our server was really nice and was able to go to the kitchen and have them get a new one out in 5 minutes. The new one was mediocre at best. My burger was completely cold and missing ingredients. Probably won't go back again."}
{"text":"We're happy that this opened in central Phoenix. Another place to go watch sport. The area bar is big and they have floor to ceiling windows for natural light. The burger is a hit or miss. If it's dead, the burger comes out a perfect medium. If it's busy, your medium will come out well done so I now know to order it medium rare when it's busy. My partner like the cobb salad. We both can't complain about the service because Jenna is great."}
{"text":"I wanted to give the restaurant a try after having a burger at the Good Guys show.  Plenty of tvs to watch sporting events.  Did a check in with Yelp, but another waitress looked at the check in , then another server finished with us, I guess no communication.  Burger was not the same as I had at the event.  Disappointed in the server, was training another girl, but thought she was a little to good to serve us.  Delayed getting check as I asked for check, then after she waited on 3 tables I almost walked out.  Manager took $5.00 off the bill."}
{"text":"This was my husband and my First time here and probably our last.  Let's start with a waitress who clearly didn't want to be at work today.  After placing our orders our waitress was never seen again.  Service was extremely slow for us, we observed several other tables that where open when we where seated but where filed and received their food before us.  When we finally received our burgers I ordered mine medium and it arrived medium, my husband ordered his medium rare and is was well done (as shown in photo). After waiting several minutes for our waitress to come check on us she never did.  I had to ask the hostess of she could locate our waitress.  After several more minutes passed she finally arrived we showed her the burgers, she did offer to have a new one made but by this time my husband had already eaten half of it and we where not in the mood to wait any longer.  She also apologied and I assume notified the manager because he came to the table and offered to bring a new burger once again but by this time I'd already given my husband the rest of my burger to eat.  The manager did remove my husband's burger from the bill.  All in all a very disappointing experience!"}
{"text":"Eh, nothing special. Service is a little rough. Food isn't that good. But there arnt a lot of places in that area."}
{"text":"Bad service, long wait, and after you order your food, you still have to wait. It took them an hour to make the food, manager only said let me go check then food was on the table. If you have two hours t kill, this is your place for garbage food."}
{"text":"Burgers were huge - we should have shared one instead of wasting more than half of one meal. I ordered the PBJB burger - tasty with all of the different sweet and savory ingredients. Hubby ordered the steakhouse burger - i had one bite of this and deemed it overly salty. I mean really, really salty. We both agreed. Not something we need to try again. Also, the char on the burger adds a nice taste, but the meat still isn't the best I've had in a burger. 

Service was good, and it was nice to go somewhere else for a change, but we have our fav burger place that is on point every time."}
{"text":"Stopped in tonight to grab some food and a beer after work. I was able to get one beer and then couldn't get another one. Two bartenders ( Terrible ) that never scanned the bar top.  Walked across the Valet to Mora Italian and that will be the last time I do the Cheeseburger bar ever.  Having Mora Italian next to this place is like having a Taco Bell next door to Mastros"}
{"text":"The cheeseburger and hot dog were delicious!!  The only reason I did not give 5 stars was because of our server.  I won't give her name but I definitely would not let her wait on us again.  The place was not very busy and we had to wait a long time for anything we asked for.  We downloaded the app which gave us a free appetizer and when the bill came the app was not discounted on the bill.  We asked for our server and had to wait 10 minutes before she came back to our table.  Overall though, we loved the place and will be back!"}
{"text":"What a good burger.. Hangover burger...caramelized onions bacon and egg!!!!!  So good and the Mac and cheese is to die for prob the best Mac I've ever had. For sure will be back"}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday afternoon.  It was busy but we were seated right away.  Took forever for my wife's ice tea to be delivered.  My order was incorrect but I didn't want to wait for a replacement so I ate it.  The food was very good.  I got a veggie burger on a bun, even though I wanted it wrapped in lettuce.  My wife got a burger with fries and our kid got sliders with chips.  For an appetizer we got hummus with veggies.  We enjoyed the food but thought it was pricey and speed of service could be better.  This sports bar has 20+ tv's."}
{"text":"We ordered buffalo sliders and this is what we got... bad food, bad environment, not our thing."}
{"text":"Has plenty of tvs to watch just about any event. You can build your own mac and cheese or your own burger. The menu had a lot of options and they have a good sized gluten fee menu"}
{"text":"We went here on Wednesday night where it was build your own cheeseburger night. It was $12 and a really great deal, they give you a list to choose from and you just mark off what you want. My burger was absolutely fantastic and I would love to go back for another Wednesday night build your own Burger"}
{"text":"They offer several great nightly specials (Wednesday's unlimited burger toppings for $12, build your own Mac n cheese for $10etc) It seems as though they make their own sauces so they taste just a little different each time, but always very good. The stuffed burgers I have ordered are always undercooked (red not pink), but they always remake it and the manager hand delivers with apologies, excellent customer service. The hell fire chips are a must order, even our 5 year old loves them. Kids eat free on Tuesdays at this location!"}
{"text":"Me second visit to Cold beers and cheeseburgers was as good as the first. I love that it's full of big screen TVs. Literally you can do a 360 in your seat and see all tv. Cool concept. The food is great too. This particular time I wanted to try something different and went with the Chicago style hot dog with a side of onion rings. Yes they not only have specialty hamburgers but specialty hot dogs as well. The dog was delicious with the classic bright green relish, tomatoes, mustard, and Serrano peppers. The onion rings were cooked perfect and to wash it down I had their beer of the day called Something Easy. It was good but a little bitter for my taste. If you're looking for good food, great atmosphere, excellent service and  reasonably prices, this is the place for you."}
{"text":"The totchos are everything this pregnant lady could have asked for! The mmmac and cheeseburger was delicious too!"}
{"text":"Have driven by several times and the place has been packed. Decided to come in the middle of the week, which was great because we were seated right away.  However, ALL dishes were dirty, like they hadn't even been through the dishwasher. Pretty gross!
Food was mediocre at best, been there definitely won't be back, wouldn't waste my money again. It's a Shame we were excited for another restaurant in the hood."}
{"text":"My brother took me to this new Scottsdale hangout on a Friday night.  Food and service was excellent.  Best burger I've had in a long time.

Don't let the \"sports bar\" moniker fool you this establishment, is firmly aimed at the family crowd with build your own mac n cheese and adores you make at your table. 

I will be back!  Give them a try you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Great ambience. Waitress was kind but took too long to refill our drinks and took longer than a waiter normally does to check in. I ordered the Denver burger with no bell peppers and it was ok. Burger bun was less than average.  I tasted the AZ burger and it was way better than the Denver burger in my opinion. Tater tots and mozzarella sticks were ok. Might come back to have the AZ burger. I was disappointed because I expected more."}
{"text":"Burgers were just ok. Nothing special. Pretzels were delicious. But I agree with a lot of others that this place is way over priced. For what you pay for your food here you can get a lot better. Namely directly across the street at culinary dropout."}
{"text":"Came here for a suns event. 
I like the bar that services inside and out, and always enjoy events at any cold beer location. 

My favorite thing about CBCB is the rotating monthly tap. 

Extra shouts to the valet David who treated me extra right and is killing it out there, being cash people!!"}
{"text":"A legit sports bar on this drag of restaurants, surely gonna keep me out of zips. I am not sure why they would adaptive reuse this building for such a \"simple\" concept but whatever , glad it is not a new build monstrosity.

good drink prices going to keep all the other restaurants on their toes on 7th st


I expected my visit to be seamless sense this is one of many locations for this restaurant and management and staff probably dial in  like clockwork and I was right. Valet is a bit different for a sports bar, but that seventh Street, there's no parking and the neighbors aren't having their driveways and yards get destroyed, see across the street (culinary dropout) so that's  not a deal a breaker what so ever"}
{"text":"Oh my god...Wednesday nights for $12 get as many toppings as you want on your burger..sit at the bar and have Kristin pour you a cold one...the service and the food are fantastic!"}
{"text":"CB&C = I think I've found my local watering hole for sports! 
My family had heard that this place was a \"Chicago\" place and we wanted to watch the Colts/Bears preseason game, thinking that NFL Network would carry it. That wasn't the case sadly, and we weren't informed so until we'd been sat and ordered a beer. Kind of disappointing that the channel didn't have it live, but we carried on. Even before finding out the game wasn't carried live, the staff changed 2 TV's for us.
Their beer list absolutely rocks! The place has a great variety of local & regional brews, and the standard fares [Bud, PBR, Michelob, etc]. The drink list looks pretty fab too - next time might have to try one of their beer & shot combos, hah.
The food menu is fairly simple and straightforward American fare. All of us went with burgers and fries. The fries had too much salt & seasoning which I had to wipe off in order to enjoy. My fried egg/bacon burger was great, but also a little to salty, unfortunately not something I was able to wipe away. Next time I'll definitely try something else on the menu and another local beer. Be sure to check in via facebook or twitter to receive 10% off your bill [max $10 off]!"}
{"text":"Was there for Saturday afternoon lunch 6/18/16.  It was very clean with friendly people and great service by our waitress Hannah !!! The management are on top of things. Food was great. Will come again.
Thank You Hannah !"}
{"text":"New place and it's packed but luckily we checked in on yelp and saved some time. We waiting about 20 minutes. We did wait some time for the food and I can tell the food also waited because my burger bottom bun came out soggy but the All America burger was still good. I asked for pickles on the side and there were still 2 pickles on the burger. Fries were decent and regular tots were good. We definitely did not have empty beer glass so this should be a 3.5 star rating."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite all time places in the valley for burgers.  This was my first time at their new location and I was very impressed.  Plenty of TVs, so if you are a sports fan I would definitely recommend this place.  I came with a group and we got a big table and our server was very nice.  This time I ordered the Bacon PB&J Burger and it was amazing!  Plenty of peanut butter!  It can get a little messy, but don't let that stop you from ordering it. The bacon, cheese and jelly on the burger were great too. I got the Mac and Cheese as my side and it was pretty good, could've had been more creamier.  I'll try the Chili Mmmac next time. I have had the O-Lineman Burger before and it was incredible! The people in my group had a great time and so did I. I will definitely be back to try another burger or the hot dogs, those looked good too!"}
{"text":"Went there yesterday to take advantage of the free meal for Veterans.  There were 5 in our party (only one Veteran) and we were seated quickly.  Our server was very attentive and our meals were delivered with no issues.  Drinks were refilled frequently.  We all ordered different items and all of us were very pleased.  The burgers were cooked as ordered and the sides were great as well.  We will be going back!!!!!"}
{"text":"Got the open pit... it was SO good!!! They accidentally Beaufort me a rare burger but got me a medium in like 5 minutes and it was perfect!"}
{"text":"Always consistent food that is delicious, I try a different burger every time. I'm am almost through the menu and won't complain about how good they all taste. One concern is with the staff, sometimes slow to seat while standing around (this has happened twice), then our waitress never checked drinks until food came. We had an appetizer and she never gave us silverware and napkins until food arrived. I'm sure we all have bad days and she seemed upset and apologized."}
{"text":"It's ok.  A little overpriced for a hamburger and not enough fries.  Service was not good.  They seemed to be talking to each other more than taking care of the customer.  Maybe, we'll give it another try."}
{"text":"We come on Tuesdays and have the best time. Kristen and Melanie are the best bartender. Always super attentive and pleasant. Has made Tuesday here our date night spot. 

We have now been her several Tuesdays and the service is just the best!"}
{"text":"Came out to get dinner and received the worse service ever. We sat for 34 min and never was approached with menus, drinks or greeted. As we sat the waitress were to busy talking with each other and flirting with a group of young guys at a table and watching the football game Was very disappointed!!!!!!"}
{"text":"In our rotation for quick meals for the family.  Beer selection is clearly the selling point for me.  Lots on tap and good bottle/can selection as well.  Service has always been friendly while the food has been average.  I'm still searching for the item (or items) that I will order and recommend.  So far, all decent (burgers and sandwiches) but not memorable.   Tuesday is kids eat free with adult entree AND it's $3 can night (and Ballast Point Sculpin is $3! / can!).  Can't beat that!"}
{"text":"I have to say I was terribly disappointed today. I think the cook must be hungover or something I asked for a med rare burger well its not burnt but no pink to be found. Everything fried we ordered was burnt to a crisp. Even my Margarita was terrible. I think the bartender may only be good at pouring beer. Another place I had hi hopes for I will never return to. Red Robin is dissapointing this may actually be worse than that. I wish I had a better report for you. Sorry."}
{"text":"Went on a Friday evening about 930, got seated right away out on the patio. It was a bit busy, but not as busy as usual. We waited for at least 15 minutes and were never served. No one came to offer us water or even take our drink order. We had been raving about the beer list and food menu to family members, who were joining us for their first time there. It was embarrassing! We left out of frustration, and probably won't be back. Bad service is not acceptable when you are in a city, with lots of other restaurants around!"}
{"text":"Though they were out of my first two beer choices, their selection is not bad but not the best.   There's something for everyone be it draft, can, or bottle.   Their three star rating for me ties directly to their claim to fame, their burger.    Good recipes but their bun kills it entirely.   Too thick and too dry on both our burgers it was just not enjoyable.    Positives: super friendly staff."}
{"text":"Make your own Mac and Cheese, with Bacon and Gruyere, quite possibly the best Mac and Cheese I have ever had."}
{"text":"Slow or service!

Managers told us they did not know how to make it right. Did they not get manager training?"}
{"text":"This review has been a long time coming, I've been here a few times. Service at the bar was excellent, quick and always serving with a smile.

The beer selection is great any thing from a watered down ultra light to a citrus tasting amber kilt lifter and a dark roasted milk stout that's scrumptious and tasty. 

I had the left hand brew milk stout and it was delicious as ever.

For dinner I had the pb&j burger. Bun was good, the burger bacon pb&j just amazing taste together .  Fries on the side. 

Only thing I could complain about is I had to get off my chair to go get the ketchup and tobacco. 

Great place and great ambiance.

Parking sucks tho"}
{"text":"So, at last I had the opportunity to try Cold Beers & Cheeseburger. Decided to check it out on a Saturday night! You can feel the energy when your walk into the building! Probably one of the better sports bars I've been to in awhile! Televisions everywhere, enough to keep you hanging out for awhile to watch your favorite game! I decided to try a cheeseburger and needless to say, you get your money's worth. Probably the biggest cheese burger patty I've had in a very long time. Puts Red Robin to shame! Food was cooked to my liking and served in a timely fashion. Chips were a little over cooked, but still good enough to eat. Waitress were friendly and responsive. Overall a very fun sports bar experience! Would recommend if you are trying to catch a game with a group of friends on the weekend!"}
{"text":"Love going to this place to watch SNF & MNF for last few years but when politics are played along with Pro Football, we are going to find another place to watch games"}
{"text":"Great place to watch a game. I tried the Hummus plate, it was good with a nice assortment of veggies with it. I then ordered the Steakhouse Truffle hamburger. It was amazing! The sweet Potato tots where very good as well. Add their Mimosia special, $10 for your first one and $1 for everyone after that, and it was an excellent visit. If they are consistent, they might be a five star rating."}
{"text":"Went there on a Sunday night with my hubs and my baby. Got a nice booth that was kind of exclusive so it was nice in case our little one acted up. We didn't want to disturb anyone. Beer was good and the crowd of people were football watchers and our baby seemed to like the chaos and the noise so it was a win for us. Service was good and well as the food!"}
{"text":"I was hesitant to try this restaurant due to the mixed ratings here on Yelp but decided to give it a try since the couple we were with wanted \"American food\". We arrived at about 6:15 on a Saturday evening. Parking is a challenge, they do offer complimentary valet but after one pass through the parking lot we found a self-park spot at the far end of the lot. Our group of four was greeted promptly and found that it would be about a 15 minute wait for an inside table or we could be seated outside right away. We opted for outside on the patio. It is smoke-free and shaded plus the misters were doing a great job at cooling, it was very comfortable outside. Multiple TVs all around showing a good variety of football games. Each of us ordered a different type of burger and everyone was happy with their orders - the Juicy Lucy, the Hangover, the Bacon Bleu and the All-American, each was cooked perfectly and the even medium-well was still nice and juicy. I recommend trying the sweet potato tots for your side. Yes, it is generally between $11 and $14 for a burger ($18 for a double!) - not cheap but beer was cold and burgers were flavorful. Our server was friendly and attentive but did not rush us as we enjoyed a couple of beers before placing our order. Next time we will skip dessert, the brownie sundae was pretty basic and not really worth the $6.  All in all a nice night out and we will be back."}
{"text":"Peanut butter and jelly burger is awesome! I dream about that burger! Great service too!"}
{"text":"Stopped by on a wednesday for a happy hour beer and burger.  The lovely Laura(?) was tending the bar....friendly, attentive, helpful....did I mention lovely?.....ordered a krombacher pils in a bottle and she helped me decide on the juicy lucy.  The beer was the perfect temperature.   Atmosphere was fine....lots of TVs...although Laura had my attention.    
The burger arrived and was decent size...tasted fine...but nothing that blew me away....I might have been expecting something a little more for $10.    Looks like I experienced a shift change....some large guy was replacing my favorite bartender.   He was trying hard to be nice but was having either listening or memory issues.  He took the guys order right next to me....I clearly heard \"medium well\"...but by the time he turned around to punch in the order, he had already forgotten how the burger was to be cooked.   He asked me if I'd like another beer.....I asked for another Krombacher.....he brought me a draft of some kind of fruity beer that clearly was not another Krombacher and draught to boot.   He also proceeded to mix drinks in front of me and splashed stuff all over.....How I miss Laura.

Regardless.....I like the place.....the burgers are okay, but for the price, should be tastier.....I'll return to give it another shot."}
{"text":"After seeing some of the reviews about the service, I was a bit concerned that some friends were meeting there...... But I figured we were all off that day, so what's the difference. 
SO, we had unbelievably good service!! Our drinks were checked on often, without being obtrusive. 
As for the burgers, not only was it $11 Wednesday for building your own burger, but they were REALLY good..........  
Beer looked cold, but 3 of 4 of us were not drinking at lunch!! LOL!!"}
{"text":"Not all burgers are created equal and CB & CB proves it. Their signature burger is a solid, tasty and nicely garnished burger served with a numbers of different sides, my personal favorite being the sweet potato tots. Since I can't run to Moody's Pub or Goldy Burgers in Chicago this is my favorite place for burgers in Scottsdale.
Service all depends on the time of day and I'd never go back on a Friday or Saturday evening but any other time it's been great."}
{"text":"Wish I could leave no stars. What a disappointment. Bar staff was rude and untrained. Can't say about food , we left!!!"}
{"text":"Just got takeout from there so I can't rate service but just wanted to comment on the food.  Salted pretzel was good.  Buffalo chicken dip was thicker than the thickest chili.  Didn't quite understand.  Mac and cheese excellent.  Prime rib sandwich better than most.  Hot dog next time I will go with the burger is all I will say about that.   They do have lots of tv's and cool bar atmosphere."}
{"text":"Thrilled that this place is so good and so close to my office. We needed a fun, friendly, and shockingly gourmet burger joint nearby! Throw a fried egg on top of any burger and be sure to order the tater tots. Get the Frankensteiner (beer and a stadium hotdog) for $7.  If you order the fire chips, get the sauce on the side to keep them from getting soggy at the end. Great atmosphere and exceptional sports bar food!"}
{"text":"It's a good thing I come to this bar for the TVs and the food because the service is horrible. It never fails that on my visit here the servers  are usually attentive in the beginning but as the night goes on the service gets worse, but this visit may have taken the cake. We've been waiting for our server for 30min to stop by to see how you're doing, to refill our water and drinks. Def not cool. Well, cheers to the games and the food but this location def needs to work on their customer service."}
{"text":"First night and we returned 2 nights latter. The burgers and beer selection are incredible.  The sweet potatoe tots are very good.  I drank 4 different stouts at one location...    PC  some one else drove"}
{"text":"So good as always! Best burgers and cold beer! I love it. Friendly staff. games on tv"}
{"text":"First time at this location, looks like I'll be the first person to write a comment! 

Always love this place, started going to the old town location first and now that there is one so close to my house? I'm thrilled. Great food, plenty of beers to choose from, amazing amount of tvs surrounding the entire dining area! Sports fans, hold on to those hats because this place is the place to be for any game!"}
{"text":"Great local burger..variety of burgers and you can't go wrong. The sweat potato tots are money and check out the peanut butter and jelly burger..it's the bomb!"}
{"text":"I went here for lunch with my husband and left a little unsatisfied with the overall food. This was a great place to watch a game on the tvs and just have some drinks with friends. The staff was friendly and very attentive. 

For food we ordered the mozzarella sticks for appetizer and the cheese was not melted. When you order mozzarella sticks, you expect the cheese to be oozing out when you take a bite. They still might be trying to figure out their cook times since they just opened. My husband ordered the Juicy Lucy burger with fries, which was in fact was not a not so juicy burger patty. I did like the seasoning on his fries though. I ordered the California Ruben Sandwich (added bacon) with sweet tots. The bread had way too much butter on the sandwich, I felt like it left a coating in my mouth, so I didn't finish it. If you order bacon, ask them to make it crispy because my bacon was very limpy. 

I don't think I will be returning for lunch or dinner, but I will be back for drinks and watching sports on the amazing selection of tvs they have."}
{"text":"Good service and food! First time at this location and it was nice! Still not happy that you don't get fries automatically at a cheeseburger joint. They up charge you for that and give chips as the side (that's like giving tacos without the tortilla). The moment they make a change for fries without charging you more I'll give better ratings here."}
{"text":"Good food but here's my problem. You would figure when ordering a burger you would get fries as the side.  It in fact you have to pay more for fries. $2 more otherwise you get chips. What the hell is that chips?! Seriously?! 

Another issue, if you want to share a meal, they charge a fee of $2. Come on seriously you're charging $2 more for a plate?! I guess I can just order one meal and just use the appetizer plate instead. Lol. 

Let's not forget their crazy high prices for burgers. $15-$18+ prices for a burger, then get fries and you're over $20+ for a burger and fries. Absolutely freaking crazy. 

This place has gone down the tube because of them nickel and diming the crap out of customers. 

Not coming here again until they stop taking advantage of customers. What a nickel and dime restaurant. What a shame."}
{"text":"This was my first time here and Steve, the Bartender was awesome!! Great service great food! Also has great specials diring the week! Can't go wrong with tbis place!"}
{"text":"Live this place for any type of sports game! It always has a good crowd for games and the service is great! The food is awesome from any app or burger it's all great. Monterey sandwich with a side of the chips is something I could eat everyday!"}
{"text":"I've been waiting for a long time to try this place after the rave reviews my east valley friends gave it.  It hurts me but I'm giving it one star and that is for the beer menu and because I can't give it no stars.  Our server was fine, not the worst I've had, far from the best.  I also tried to keep in mind that they just opened 5 days ago.  We started off with the pretzel and cheese, it was very plain and the cheese was cold. Ok, so I won't get that again, no big deal, we came for burgers anyway.  

We ordered 3 burgers. 2 were med/well and one was med, we got two rare and one well done which was pretty much the opposite of what we ordered.  Besides being cooked wrong two were what we expected.  I did the unthinkable I guess, I asked to add cheese, minus the tomato and I wanted mayo on the side.  She asked if we wanted fries instead of chips, yes please.  

Now my burger...I ordered a bacon cheeseburger which is about as simple as it gets. I got the wrong cheese, 2 slices of tomato and no mayo and my medium/well burger was so raw I could hear it moo.  My husband did have to go to flag our waitress down so I could tell her this was nothing that I ordered.  She came and offered to take mine back but because I was now over this place I just asked for the mayo so we could move on with our night.  Whatever, just a place we wouldn't come back to.  No big deal, there are plenty of restaurants in North Central to choose from.  

Then the bill comes...we were all charged an additional $2 for the fries. I guess it does say this on the menu but if the server is asking if we want something INSTEAD then she should also mention it will cost you.  The thing that put me over the edge was the 50 cent charge for mayo.  Seriously?  That is a pretty common thing to put on a burger.  So let me get this right...You served me the entirely wrong burger and you add 50 cents for the one correct thing you didn't put on my plate until I asked again, after you knew you gave me the wrong food?  

I'm disappointed that this place was not all that my friends have told me about. We won't be back and that makes me sad."}
{"text":"The cheeseburger I had was good but cold.  Sat by some really loud fans, but that is what you get at a sports bar.  Would go back again to try for a warm burger."}
{"text":"Went here to watch the NBA finals, great atmosphere and excellent customer service. 
Our server was super attentive and the manager Shannon made sure our night was more than enjoyable ! 

Would recommend this restaurant any time for anyone who wants delicious food and a good time ."}
{"text":"Stopped by here a couple months ago, and didnt see my review ? oh well,, been there 3 times now,, 

Always great service, Burgers have been cooked to order, and tasty, Wife usually gets the Coney dog, or something like that, which is pretty good, just not a hot dog fan... 

GREAT selection of beverages.. AMEN... 
Great place to stop after a morning of golf, 
Plenty of TVs to catch sports, not too loud, and has outdoor seating for the smokers, or peeps with pets.."}
{"text":"Went there on a Saturday evening about 7:30pm.  Had to wait about 30 minutes for a table (not bad).  It was extremely loud and hearing people was a problem, even when sitting right across from them.  The prices are somewhat steep - and you have to pay extra to get fries.  The menu is pretty extensive with lots of really good choices.  Lots of TVs around the place make it a nightmare for someone with ADHD.  Service was pretty slow.  Food was really good."}
{"text":"The food was amazing! Huge selection of beers including a lot of local favorites. They make their own potato chips! And they're bomb! I had the Hangover burger and it was everything a breakfast burger should be. Perfect cook on the huge patty, egg was just runny enough to get into eveything, but wasn't a mess. Definitely order the truffle fries!! AMAZING! The staff was great, very attentive, and there when we needed. I'm not huge on the sports bar thing, but the food here is the star."}
{"text":"We have been waiting to try this place since they opened and we finally got the chance. Sadly, I was less than impressed. For starters, we checked in on Yelp so we would have a minimal wait. When we got there, they hardly have any parking and my husband actually dropped me off at the door to check in & he went and parked, all the way in front of Sprouts which is behind the restaurant. And this wasn't because they were so slammed, they just don't have much parking. 

Once I checked in, I quickly realized that they have zero space inside or outside to wait for your table. The front door is approximately 8 inches from the door to the patio that people are constantly going in and out of so unless you can squeeze in that room you will either be in the way of the patio door or the front door. And they don't have benches outside so even if you wait outside, you will be blocking the door. 

We didn't have to wait an insane amount it time, maybe 10-15 minutes. When we were seated, they sat us at a table right by the other patio door. When I mean right by the door, I mean my husband could have held to door open for them from his chair. This meant that every single time someone opened that door, which felt like was about every 20 seconds, a huge gust of 108 degree air got blown all over us. It felt like a flame thrower was lightly toasting us. When the waitress came to get our drink order, my husband asked if we could move tables. She said yes and moved us to a table across the hall, about three feet away from the original table. We still got a gust of hot air every time that damn door opened, slightly less hot than before, but still warm. Guys, I never got cooler than lightly sweating. Even my bean pole of a daughter complained multiple times that it was hot.

Moving onto the food/drinks. I ordered the Cherry Squirt cocktail, it was alright, nothing special. My husband ordered a beer by Sun Up called White Russian. When he ordered he purposely said 'White Russian by Sun Up.' The waitress brought him an actual White Russian cocktail. When my husband told her that he wanted the beer, she clearly had no idea what he was talking about. 

My daughter and I both got Mac & cheese, it was okay. About one third of the way through it I couldn't eat anymore. My daughters was the same way, she didn't care for it. I won't put to much stock in that because even though she is definitely a Mac & cheese loving kid, this was definitely creamier than she usually likes so I can't say I'm surprised she wasn't a fan. My husband got the Mac & cheese burger, he said the burger patty and bun were decent but he didn't think the mac & cheese was flavorful enough to add anything."}
{"text":"I love the new place!  It's busy and the guests are very nice and patient when it comes to service. Every new restaurant has to work out kinks,  but this place is great. The staff is friendly and I really feel at home when I go in on a slower time of night. The food is excellent, I haven't had one thing I haven't liked,  and the management is prompt and professional when in a stressful enviornment... Expect a little bit of a wait because it's busy,  but it's so worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Excellent service and very tasty burgers. Service was friendly, prompt and efficient. Had the bacon blu cheese burger which was awesome. Eating on the patio in this heat was bearable with the misters on. I was impressed with the great variety of burgers on the menu as well as the ability to get a Mac and cheese dish if you're in the mood for that!"}
{"text":"Very tasty...My friend and I arrived a half hour before closing  on a Sunday night. I had heard positive reviews about CBAC and had been driving by it a number of times...

Other than the server who looked exhausted after working a double shift, and nonetheless who was very nice and accommodating....the juicy Lucy  burger I ordered was very tasty and came infused with a variety of cheeses...possibly one of the best burgers I had ever had...The burgers come with choices of sides (fries, tater tots, or salad) but you do pay $ 2.00 extra for them, just a forewarning as the server may ask you what you want as a side not assuming that you don't know it's not already included...Not a big deal in itself but it would be nice if it would be made clear as it's not necessarily obvious...until I really paid attention to the top of the menu's finer print.

My burger was wonderful and cooked to perfection...I was just alarmed at the mountain of tater tots that were served alongside it versus a handful or should I say a normal portioned size...I disagree that the tater tots are awesome as stated in other reviews...If you want the bomb tater tots, you need to drive south to Rehab Burger Therapy in Old Town and you'll get a guaranteed climax...enough said...

Tasty burgers, good service...no big deal about the side dishes...I do like the place even better than LUSH...as it's more casual and not  pretentious....other than the interior is really nothing special, and could be a little bit more inviting in my humble opinion....

Last but not least, I counted at least thirteen TV screens which I assume should be plenty to entertain you while you feast on your burger concoction."}
{"text":"Come here all the time with the guys. Christy is awesome and service and beers are great and cold... Keep em coming!"}
{"text":"I was so excited to find out that a new casual beer bar was coming to the neighborhood. I looked past some of the recent negative Yelp reviews and hoped that my experience would be better. Unfortunately, at the end of the day Cold Beers & Cheeseburgers just did not deliver. 

As for the beer selection, it is fairly decent, including one of my favorite beers (Bell's Two Hearted). 

With a beer bar, I would expect that the servers have a minimum requisite amount of background in the beers they are serving. Alas, the bartender was more of a Miller kind of drinker and an off-shift server (who was a loud bar patron) demonstrated an even lower familiarity with the beers being served. 

Being that it is a newer establishment, I can look past the fact that the servers didn't know their product. That left my end opinion significantly reliant on what kind of burger was delivered. 

I had a $12 Bacon Bleu burger with onion rings. If I'm going to have a burger that costs more than $10 I expect a ton of quality and a lot of flavor, neither of which was provided. The burger fell apart on what I thought was a cheap quality bun and the meat tasted as though it was sourced from the discount pile at Bashas in the same plaza. 

If you are looking for a quality beer experience in the area, save your money and go to Four Peaks."}
{"text":"Never had an issue with this place. Service has been excellent for me. Servers have always been polite. Great Burgers."}
{"text":"Been here three times.   The service can be slow, and the beer is overpriced, but the burgers are worth it."}
{"text":"Ok,  I love how cold the beer is.  Been here over 19 times since they have opened and trust me their draft beer is absolutely refreshing and seriously served cold.  Food.... as good as it is. I have NOT had a clean plate/silverware yet. So as good as my burger may be, how dirty is it. If the dishes are continuously dirty, can the food be safe to eat???"}
{"text":"Honestly, the food and service was good. It's what I would expect from a restaurant. 

They have interesting burgers like PB&J which is cool but besides that it's your typical burger/sports bar spot."}
{"text":"We love this place. Can be loud at times but, they try to be a sports bar with all the TVs. Burgers & variety are excellent though. Manager walks around to ask about your experience. I like that a lot. Patio atmosphere is great. Everyone is friendly. If you're hungry and want to take friends to a place you can settle into and be casual-comfortable, Cold Beers & Cheeseburgers is at the top of the list."}
{"text":"The food was great and the beers were great, but be prepared to wait a long time for your food.  We waited 50 minutes for 2 burgers, a kids chicken strips, and kids sliders.  Good thing the kids had something to color.  Our server was great.  I would definitely go back, but hoping after the week they have been open they figure out how to expedite their food service.  I'll review again after we return.  Yes, I'll go back, so that tells you something."}
{"text":"Walked in to Bye Bye Bye playing. This is my new favorite sports bar in Arcadia nay America!"}
{"text":"I was here for the first time , was very dissappointed specially becuase we've heard so many good things. A group of us sat outside , we joined two of our friends. Our server took our order, brought our beers out. We asked for a cold glass for one of the beers that came in a can, 15 min passed she finally came back but instead of bringing one, she brought us the check for us to pay proceeding to tell us she was going home that someone would check on at us. Nobody did check on us , SO WE HAD NO CHOICE but to leave.  I'm a server so I know and expect good service. This was not it. This one star was based of service, the restaurant itself is very chill , they have a huge selection of beers, food looks great."}
{"text":"It's nice to have a new place to eat around, I love all of the TVs for sporting events.  Service has gotten better since opening.  Most of the burgers are just ok, is rather order other items on the menu.  Half the time my entree comes out cold.  Overall good food, but way over priced.  I went for lunch and it was $28!  Also, every time I have been in, the temperature of the restaurant is to warm.  I would recommend the Bacon PB&J burger.  Not all their fault, but the parking lot is horrible."}
{"text":"Great food and drinks.  We have tried the burgers, fries and salads, and everything has been flavorful and satisfying.  The portions are plentiful and keep us coming back for more.   The staff is fun and we enjoy the ambiance.  Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Okay... although I enjoyed my chicken sandwich there was nothing very notable about it, it could have been cooked more as it had that slight rubbery feel, however maybe my expectations were too high! I was surprised that the kids meals were so small as well, my 6 year old ended up eating my food as his meal consisted of just 2 chicken strips + 10 fries (he counted them lol). Kids meals are more suitable for kids maybe 4 and under. Any older than that, especially a boy, expect to share your food."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to their opening.  How can you miss with a name like that!  Well they did by having Valet only parking at 3:30 pm!  Are you kidding me?!  This is a sports bar that serves burgers and beer!!  What are they thinking?!  I am getting extremely annoyed over this disturbing trend in the area.  There is no purpose for Valet when the parking lot surrounds the restaurant.  Valet is for when parking is off site.  Why would the owners choose to make parking such a hassle?  I do not know anybody who prefers Valet.  Who wants to wait in line to park your car and then again to pick up your car.  I can only come to the conclusion that the owners care more about profit than making their customers happy.  That's a shame.  If more people would complain and refuse to do business at places that only have Valet maybe they would get the message."}
{"text":"Don't expect personal service or even to get what you ordered.  I ordered a medium rare burger that came out looking like it had been on the grill since yesterday... over cooked and dried out.  The place is way busy so maybe that was it?   I'll try them again another time but this was not a good first impression."}
{"text":"Typically great service but on Father's Day after waiting for two hours (after ordering) we still had no food. After the manager said it would be at least another 15 minutes were decided to leave. Odd thing was nobody in the restaurant seemed to be eating."}
{"text":"4 of us ended up here on Sunday evening. Place was 80-90% full and getting busier. Our server (Kennedi) had at least 7 full tables and was very busy. Yet....she managed to get our orders and take care of us in as timely and professional manner as I consider possible. Food was good to very good. Drinks just ok. The wine \"pours\" are very small and I would suggest ordering an extra couple to stay hydrated. Also they were out of Modello Especial. Settled for my Coors Light back up. 

Always sorry when I can't rate 5 stars. However, this could have easily been 3 instead of 4. Rate the extra star to server Kennedi. She really was amazing. Next time will request her station."}
{"text":"This place is a one and done for me.  Hamburgers were just OK.  For the high price you would think they would use good beef but they don't.  Plus the burger was much too salty.  The chips that come with the burger were burnt and AWFUL.  The fries were tiny and over seasoned.  The staff was good but the place is very noisy since everyone has to holler over the exceptionally loud music.   Can't understand why anyone would give this place a good review, it was expensive and the food was very bland.  There are dozens of better burger places in the area."}
{"text":"Not fun to watch a waitress let a dog lick her hands and face and then deliver food and water without washing."}
{"text":"This could be an a good place for lunch but the service is very slow. They are not setup for the lunch crowd.  Hamburgers were very good."}
{"text":"The food was great. The service, not so much. We were seated for a good 15 minutes before anyone even came and provided us with waters. Take another 15 for our order to be taken and another 20 to receive the check. The server was very apologetic at first but didn't seem to care after that!"}
{"text":"This location food and drinks are pretty disappointing. Had the prime dip for $16 like I always get. It was (bone dry) the mix drinks were  watered down. The wife's burger had no seasoning. I was excited to see a location near me. I've been to the Dobson/Germann location numerous times. Food quality is a lot better. This review would have been 1 star but the service was good. Hopefully they get the quality up I'll give it a couple months before I go back to this location and try again."}
{"text":"The worst feeling to have in a restaurant is to not be acknowledged. We had to wait to be greeted then waited to be seated then once we were seated we were still invisible. So we left!"}
{"text":"I took a few friends this weekend, however, there were several dirty tables and children running around the restaurant and coming to your table.  The parents and management didn't appear to be concerned.  The food was not very good and the waitresses were not on their game.  We had to keep asking for things, such as forks and knives, napkins..  With the prices you would think that they would be on top of things.  The sandwiches didn't have much meat and after looking at the pictures on the screen you are surprised when you get your plate......

The ladies restroom needed soap and cleaning..
There are many burger/beer joints in Scottsdale"}
{"text":"We live nearby and we bike down from the neighborhood on Friday nights to visit either Oregano's, The Ivy, Nando's, or CB & C.  The reason we don't go to CB & C as often as Oregano's or the Ivy is because there are not many healthy food options.  It would be great if there were more options for the health conscious.  I keep getting the Greyhawk Club, which is good, but with any good thing, too much of it . . . 

The atmosphere is great though, so we definitely keep it in our rotation."}
{"text":"2nd chance visit tonight. What a difference!

1st, thank you - very nice Yelp check-in offer.
2nd, the $12 build your own burger is a great deal!
3rd, Betty did a fantastic job as did the kitchen.

What I've learned: I think this place does a great job of \"playing to their crowd\" and the types of promotions and deals they offer play to different types of crowds on different nights. 1st visit was on a UFC fight night - I'll be sure to not return on one of those nights. No judgement, but not my thing at all. I believe the servers, probably very intelligently, play to that crowd by being a bit more loose (sorry for the term) in terms of dress and attitude. 2nd visit was around the beginning of March Madness. The servers were much more conservative and the crowd, despite the ASU game, more mellow. Add to that what I already shared about the burger deal and I've found the night I'll likely return.

Oh, and as a follow up: the server I was unhappy with for having hovered over me with her tablet come tip time, was observed tonight at a different table. She stayed at the table but didn't stare down the person paying the tab as I felt she had with me. If the management addressed this, then good on her for the improvement. Betty did even better. She set me up with the tablet and literally walked away all together.

At this point, without doubt, worthy of another visit. Thank you."}
{"text":"Way overpriced for what you get $16.20 for a chicken Philly with hardly any chicken and a stale roll. This place belongs in Scottsdale definitely not in Glendale if you try to call them because you left a credit card there it goes to voicemail 3 times when you drive up there bunch of people standing around this place should not last here and hopefully it will not last pretty bad food for the price without a doubt just my little opinion. Way way overpriced for average service at best average food at best Village Inn has a Reuben that is better then what you guys serve shame on you stay in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped here after golf hungry for a good middle of he day meal. We ordered beer and burgers just like the name suggests. Both were great. The server was top notch especially after my husband spilled his beer and the server replaced it at no charge. She was so obliging and kind.  We live in Goodyear and sure wish you would open one of your restaurants there. Lots of opportunity between there and Verrado. Maybe next to the new Harkins theater. Lots of room for growth. Looking forward to going to the 7th street location."}
{"text":". Seriously for a quick cocktail and almost fast food menu it's really really good!  The prime dip and taters/sweet tarts were excellent no fat very lean not too salty and the skinny margarita perfection!  In and out, close to home..... what more could a girl ask for when looking to just order it, do it and go?"}
{"text":"If you like cold beer, you've come to the right place. If you want attentive service, it's great for beer refills. When you order a \"build your own burger\" by filling out a form, please explain how it can be botched three times. So not only is a burger returned, you don't get fresh sides. My husband ordered a burger medium, it was raw inside. Further, when you can't eat, and management assures they'll handle it, one should expect the food item(s) removed from the bill.  I've seen some great reviews. It wasn't our experience."}
{"text":"We love this place for a good casual hang out for dinner. Great burgers and beer choices - hence the name. Their remodel really did wonders to open it up and gives a great atmosphere. The patio allows dogs, which is a bonus. And there's lots of TVs. We love the ring of fire burger, and I add the sweet tots with ketchapeno (a mildly spicy ketchup they also sell by the bottle)!!  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place.  My first visit I enjoyed the atmosphere - the TVs helped make up for the slow service, and the burger was better than average.  But, the bun was stale- and both the house chips and fries were greasy and tasted like they bathed in the same old burnt grease.

With that experience just weeks ago, I decided to give them another shot on the Fourth of July.  It took 5 minutes to get seated, and 10 more  to get water . . . and they weren't even busy . . . I ordered the Chicago dog and decided to try the tater tots (bad memories of the fries and chips steered me in that direction to be honest).   It took forever to get the food - and in hindsight, I wish it had  never come at all.   The bun was stale (again), the hot dog was cold and tasted like grease and salt.  But worst of all - the tots were barely edible.  Absolutely disgusting - like burnt, tired grease from that same shameful fryer  - I had 3 or 4 and felt horrible.   

Then I waited forever for the bill and even longer for them to collect it.  (Again, they weren't that busy and numerous employees were gathered at the hostess stand)  An overall horrible dining and customer service experience.  Like I said, I wanted to like this place - but TVs and cold beer alone won't bring me back.  Service, and good food would . . ."}
{"text":"We arrived at about 6:30 on a Saturday and expected to wait for a table.  They told us it would be about 20 minutes but we were actually seated in about 10 minutes which was nice.  We sat down but then waited for about 10 minutes before our server came to greet us.  We placed our drink orders and food orders right away.  This was at about 6:40.  At 7:10 we were still waiting for our food (not a complicated order- just a burger and a hot dog).  The server finally came up to apologize for the wait and promised us it was coming right up.  We finally were served about 5 minutes later.  The food was decent.  The onion rings were just the way I like them except they weren't hot..but not totally cold so I let it go.  The burger and the hot dog were good...typical bar fare.. nothing spectacular but ok.  At that point we were then approached several times by some guys who were probably management apologizing for the wait and asking if we needed anything.  The server also came over to tell us they were going to take $5 off our bill since we waited for so long.  I thought that was nice.  Overall, it wasn't a great dining experience but I think under different circumstances it would be better.  The football game had just come on and I think they got slammed.  The prices were ok...maybe a little bit more than I would have thought is reasonable..
I will most likely return but probably not during such a busy time of day."}
{"text":"It absolutely amazes me how a business that started in Grey Hawk with amazing employees and management has so quickly forgotten where they came from with the continued expansion. Yes, I was there and support the original location until the recent move further down Scottsdale road. This new location lacks the company profile and vision I once supported and the employees just simply don't care. The Management is overwhelmed and the server and kitchen staff have no clue as to the quality of food that the original location and even the old town location produce. The staff is rude, the service is terrible and the management is a joke. Look if you don't like your job or can't handle the stress, leave to someone else. Your manager title does not exclude you from busing tables or helping customers, you are a local bar and should appreciate the customers. With all the money and work the family has put into all the bar and restaurants that has made them a success in AZ and beyond you would think you would have pride in this location. A \"we are new\" mentality is a joke. If the growth and expansion has led you away from the values, customer service and food of your original location, I no longer want to support it. Its an unfortunate situation when a local company we all helped grow forgets where they came from."}
{"text":"Last night was our first visit. I had downloaded the app in hopes of making this a regular eating and drinking spot. However our waitress had no clue about the app or the loyalty card."}
{"text":"Great food, atmosphere and drinks! Lance the Bartender makes simply the best martinis in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Such a Dope location and love the open atmosphere along with the sliding garage like doors to let the fresh air in.  Was really disappointed that they didn't have the Bloody Mary bar, and the one we ordered was not good at all.  Then we ordered the half and half Tachos and apparently they don't do that in the Arcadia location either. So by the time they let us know and asked if we could just have 2 sides, which was totally fine, they bring it with our meal. Our table was filled with our appetizer, app plates and our burgers. Would have loved to have started with an app and unfortunately we didn't even really eat it, what a waste. On top of that, they didn't have the burger right. Pretty disappointing and never had a manager come by to apologize.  Server was super sweet and attentive and the burger was fabulous as always.  Not planning on going back to that location!"}
{"text":"For a busy Father's Day!  Wait to be seated was shorter than told! Service was awesome,  all our food was very tasty!  Wish my salad was a little more chilled! overall a pleasant experience ! I will return for another tasty meal!"}
{"text":"I came to north Scottsdale for thanksgiving weekend with my family and relatives. Just when I thought the hangover was setting in on Saturday after binge drinking in Old Town I came across this gem. \"Cold beers and Cheeseburgers\" is what I spot in the distance on my ride up Scottsdale road. Like seriously? Sign me the eff up! 

My cousin and I opted to order the \"tot chos\" aka nachos with tater tots.  When our food arrived we were greeted by a voice in the distance saying \"who threw up on that!\" Just to clarify.. F that guy.. They were dank as sh**. I instantly began to realize I was far from hungover but actually pretty drunk sitting at the bar watching college football and writing this review. Yes. I am at the facility right now. Our bartender picked all of our beers as we are not picky and she nailed it... Sorry I just took a little break from writing as the manager just greeted us with two free IPA's... Yes. Two free beers. At this point this is getting ridiculous. I might just sleep here tonight. 

Nonetheless, this place is epic and I highly suggest making your way for some cold beers and cheeseburgers. 

-Sincerely. Rory's favorite cousin Elliot...

Ps. Do yourself a favor and sit at the bar :)"}
{"text":"Very disappointed with service. Treated very poorly by the bartender, who I will not name. She clearly was not in the mood to connect with new customers in the bar; therefore, food was late and she didn't care to acknowledge the horrible service we were receiving. In addition, shared concern with one of the Managers, who did not care to follow up about our food taking so long. As someone who has been in the service industry, I was extremely livid. I was embarrassed not leave an at least 15% tip, so I did. We are very respectful and always are patient with service, especially since we realize people need to do side work and get ready for turn over. Unfortunately, I will never go to this location again. Thank you for the other Manager who listened to my complaint and was very apologetic."}
{"text":"We stopped  in for the first time the other night.  For a while now we have gone by and seen that CBCB is generally crowded and we were looking forward to trying it out.

We were not disappointed at all.  

We sat at the bar and had drinks and burgers.  The service was great as were the burgers.  It happened to Wednesday when they have a burger special to load up the burger.

We will return"}
{"text":"FINALLY! Exactly what I would consider a good neighborhood  sports bar! Might not see the inside of Zipps ever again. Great food/drink selection/well trained staff. 

Only issue I see is parking- valet right now but can't stand that hassle!"}
{"text":"So ASU is playing Oregon and every other TV has some Trivia advertisement..??  Is there no one at wheel here??!!"}
{"text":"I like CB&C and come here a lot. Great food and beer selection. 4 stars because they always seem to mess my order up. I'm not picky. I asked for the Philly add mushrooms. Came out no mushrooms. Here for the Monday Mac and cheese special. It came out incorrect. Not sure which end is messing it up but it happens. Otherwise a great place to watch the game!"}
{"text":"Sports, brews and food - what more do you need? Walked in here on a college football day and sat right at the bar. It was very busy because the ASU game was just about to start but the service was still amazing! My husband and I just got done eating lunch at a nearby restaurant but left because the service was so poor. We are so sad we didn't visit this place first! 

Right as we sat down we were greeted quickly and waited on consistently! We only had one beer each because we were so full from lunch but the bartenders were so kind and attentive. The food looked amazing, great beer selection and as busy as it was the service was still incredible and that's why I'm rating this place so high! I only got one drink here but I can't wait to come back and visit again!"}
{"text":"We like this local spot. They have great happy hour selection as well. Excellent burger and fries. Great selection of beer and pretzel bread."}
{"text":"Great setup but service is horrible.  No professionalism with the servers whatsoever.  Very disorganized.  Whoever hires and trains needs to lose their job.  Like the food and atmosphere but service is very bad and very unprofessional."}
{"text":"Typical bar food, nothing special. Small TVs which came as surprise given it's reputation as a place to watch games."}
{"text":"Great service this evening. Dinner rush had the whole place packed so we decided to sit outside. This place is pet friendly. We had a four legged friend with us and he was accomodated as well as we were. The sun shade was down so that was no bother. The atmosphere was great, beers were cold, service was prompt and everything came out to order! Outstanding for a restaurant during dinner rush! Our server Rachel was awesome. Kept the beers coming right on time. Always checked in and made sure we were comfortable. The PB&J Burger was super delicious. Do not let the name steer you away. It was a combination of delicous flavors. I will be returning very soon."}
{"text":"What a change since this location was The Dirty Pelican.  Tons of HD Tv's and a  great mix of music.  Lots of draft beer offerings.  I had the cocktail John Daly. (Think Arnold Palmer with deep eddy tea). Dangerously good.  We were a large group and the server did her job with ease. It's a loud place so this isn't someplace you go for deep in depth conversations.  Perfect for watching a good game. 
All the food was well prepared and very good.  I'd recommend the onion dip with housemade chips. 
Happy to see more great places here in the northwest!"}
{"text":"We wanted to find a spot to watch the basketball game and this place was suggested. We arrived, got sat out side pretty quickly, which we asked for. Then we waited for at least 10 minutes and no one greeted us. We had to hunt down some type of manager who clearly didn't know we had been sitting for some time, no apology. Just asked for our drinks as the server then arrived. 

It was the same girl who had been outside multiple times with out acknowledging us and all i was looking for is a table touch so we know you see us, that never happened. She never gave an apology or asked how we're doing.. which was super rude. I asked about a food option, while i was trying to order and she answered it and walked off ... ?

All in all the food came out on time, and she managed to keep our drinks full while at the same time not giving a hoot about us. The server got super rude when someone at the table tried to order another drink.

The server was friendly to the tables next to us for some odd reason. And then we waited for at least 20 minutes to pay our bill. I then had to get up and go find her , gave her card and waited for  it to get dropped off which it did and she immediately walked off, no \"thank you\" or \"have a good night, thanks for coming in\" , \"see ya next time\" 

Her money was clearly coming from another table and not us tonight. 

The receipt said Lo was her name.. best of luck if you get her."}
{"text":"Had our first cold brew and cheeseburger on our first full day of living in Arizona! We enjoyed the atmosphere, service and the burgers! We will be back to try the mac and cheese!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been back several more times since my last review.  I don't know if you changed something up with your fries, but the last two times we've been here they have been really good.

Service as well has been really good.  Even when busy on Football Sundays."}
{"text":"We went Saturday afternoon tables and bar seats available, we sat at the bar. I must say the service sucks to say the least. The young ladies are cute to look at but there bubbly smiles, chests and obvious first attempt at customer service didn't fit the bill. For $15.00 you can get a great burger and remember to make it a $17.00 burger if you want fries with that.  I would highly recommend the turkey club because it's a cold sandwich being it took 40 minutes to get it after we had to remind our server we ordered it. Go decide for yourself."}
{"text":"Watch your bills here. Two out of three visits they have over-charged.  Tonight they brought drinks that were not ordered. Took them off my bill but added to a friend's.  Complete scam."}
{"text":"if your business is focused on cheeseburgers, I'd try making them exceptional. These were average and overcooked. Beer choices were good."}
{"text":"This was our first time here last night. I've heard pretty good things about this place, so we decided to check it out. The service was pretty fast, we got seated right away. The drinks were amazing and we ordered the buffalo chicken egg rolls--also great! When the food came, one of the busboys (I assume) took our appetizer plate when we weren't even done. That was kind of strange. We got our burgers and only ate half. Unfortunately, the turkey burgers did not taste good at all. There was no flavor and they did not taste right (they ended up making us both feel sick the remainder of the night). Overall, it seems a bit over priced for the quality of the food. Not sure if we will be rushing back. Kind of disappointed."}
{"text":"Awesome! We've lived in the area for over 15 years and have seen restaurants in this location come and go. I use a rule of thumb to disregard any review starting with \"We went on opening day\" or \"I went the first week they were open...\" Any business needs some time to get on their feet. I've been three times now and have had great service each time. We had a complaint the first time but the manager came and double checked on us after to make sure everything was how we wanted. Which is exactly how it should work at a restaurant. There will be complaints, what's important to me is how they handle them! The food is great and the beer is, as you can tell by the name, cold! Couldn't ask for much more. So happy to see a good restaurant in here that I think will last!"}
{"text":"Long live cold beer and cheeseburgers!  Ideal sports bar with a better layout than the north Scottsdale location.  I am rooting for this place to be successful. Staff was still working through some kinks, but you can tell they had great management oversight and attention to detail was there.  Glad to see them getting super busy after we arrived for an early Sunday lunch."}
{"text":"How this place isn't above 5 stars amazes me!  Not one have I had to chase to get my beer filled.  They also do the UFC fights with over 30 TVs with NO Cover charge folks!  That just doesn't happen.  Great food and indoor outdoor bar make this place amazing.  Now the best for last... If you have the pleasure of being served by Anna your night is complete.  She's all smiles, lively, and doesn't forget the little things like lime in your Dos Equis; not to mention she's easy on the eyes!  Thank you Anna!"}
{"text":"My wife and I are huge fans. We've been to both the Chandler and Gilbert locations. Both are equal in quality but we patronize the Gilbert location as the parking is a little easier. It can be dodgy parking on a Friday or Saturday night at the Chandler site. 

The food is incredible. I'm a real burger gourmand. . The \"Juicy Lucy\" is an incredible indulgence. The server even educated us a bit suggesting I order mine medium as opposed to medium rare to better hold the concoction together. An amazing sandwich. I love the mac and cheese and their hot dogs. 

Only nit:  I have a thing about being nickel and dimed. I really wish the fries were an equal priced option to the delicious potato chips. Charging extra for tots is probably reasonable."}
{"text":"This is just a fun place to go - the beer is cold, the burgers are great (enormous) and the service and atmosphere is great!  Great place to meet friends, watch a game or just a date night - love the outdoor seating!"}
{"text":"I have been here 3 times and always leave disappointed in one way or another. The music is VERY loud. If you have any intentions of actually talking with people at your table this is not the place to go for dinner. The wait staff is always friendly, always slow and hard to find once you have received your food. The menu looks amazing and the burgers/sandwiches mediocre at best. It seems like the cook staff has a problem with timing a table foods to be ready all at the same time. Cold and undercooked and other meals hot to burnt. Wrong burger delivered and it took at least another 10 minutes to get the correct burger(in the meantime the rest of us have eaten) and the new burger was close to raw. The tv's are great if you don't care to hear anything and there is a large selection of rather standard beers(but they are cold). I probably will not go back because like I said that was my 3rd disappointing visit. There are many great burger places in Phoenix and this is not one of them."}
{"text":"I went here about a week ago with a few friends since we never has been. I got the ring of fire burger which was amazing tasting. it was almost too spicy for me and i love spicy food. The environment is great as well. We went on a Wednesday night and the place was packed, but we were seated right away which was nice. Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"This place is great!!! Portions are huge and food is awesome. If you like cold beer and cheese burgers why would you go anywhere else."}
{"text":"Love this place but the parking situation is so bad we rarely go.  When it gets warm, we'll bike there."}
{"text":"Newly remodeled and looks great. Great outside patio and great beer selection. Ordered a spicy burger and my son got sliders. Both were awesome!  They are allergy conscious (son has nut allergy) and have gluten free buns and cook with soy oil. Server was fast and friendly.  I just found our new family bar and grill!!"}
{"text":"Best Burger Ever!     Today we got to enjoy the beautiful weather and sit outside on the patio watching multiple college football games!
We started off with the pretzel appetizer which was served warm with an awesome cheese sauce.   
On a previous visit I had a Build Your Own Bacon Cheeseburger with caramelized onions which was awesome! Today we decided to try the Hangover burger and a PB&J burger (Who would've thought that combination could be quite tasty) and we also had the Turkey burger.  The burgers are huge and full of flavor.   The burgers are all served with their chips which are nice and crunchy!   
This service is consistently good and the Manager even comes around to check to see how your meal is.
Great burger at any time of the day!"}
{"text":"I went to this place the first time and was disappointed but I decided to give it another chance, it was still mediocre. The burgers were overpriced and the service was horrible. I ordered 3 beers that were listed on the menu that they did not have, and the waitress was very inattentive. My burger was over cooked and had ingredients on it that were not listed on the menu. Will not be wasting my money here anymore."}
{"text":"I've been to this location a couple of times and sit at the bar. I consistently receive amazing service and charisma from Dani! She is the epitome of what any bar needs! Will definitely be back and hopefully have her!"}
{"text":"3.5 to be fair..

Came here late for the fights and paid dearly as I had to sit on the outside bar area and fight off the blazing sun. I wish they had those misters around the bar area as well to cool off the bar goers. I may have ordered a drink or two more had that happened. But instead I was fighting off heatstroke so the liquor came to an abrupt halt. 

The totchos were cool but I wish it had more cheese and toppings, towards the end all I got was less than crispy tots.. the arizona dog was a highlight but I was only able to finish half.. will have to give it a fair review on its own one day.

Ultimately if it weren't for thr fights I don't know if I'd venture out here again, but luckily they do and no one closer does, so they will get a future chance at redemption 

Side note: the guy next to me was served half cooked chicken fingers, like still pink/red in the middle.. definitely check your meat before biting in to be safe... salmonella is no joke...."}
{"text":"Good burgers here.  Lots of variety to choose from so there should be something for everyone.  Lots of beverage choices as well.   There are also a lot of TVs, and where we sat we were able to watch several games at a time.  Service was decent too.  Prices are a little high but I think that's par for the north Scottsdale course.  Gets busy so you may have to wait for a table. Building is a tad on the small side."}
{"text":"It's always exciting when a new restaurant opens in your 'hood. I've had CB&C before, so I had an idea what to expect. I went with the husband on the build your own burger night (all the toppings you want for one price). The issue is, the toppings just don't taste that great.... and I tried a lot of them (ha!). The burgers are not as good as I would expect given their popularity and price."}
{"text":"Gloria was our server and was on top of all of our needs. The food was delicious as always and came out faster than expected. There are a ton of tvs and has a good atmosphere. I will definitely be coming back soon. Thanks Gloria for the great customer service."}
{"text":"Food is always good, but watch out they \"accidentally\" add extra money to your card for tips. Not pleased with that at all! Managers response was terrible and unprofessional."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times.  Food is always good and service is adequate.  Good burger!"}
{"text":"I have been to this location a handful of times, and they just can't be consistent!! Tonight, I had the cb & cb burger with a Caesar salad, just like I normally get, medium, on a pretzel bun. The burger was medium well, very dry, and the pretzel bun was somewhat hard. I didn't return it because we were in a hurry, but I keep hoping they get the temp of the burger right, AND THEY RARELY DO. If a place is going to specialize in burgers, the temp better be right all the time!!
The consistency here is soooo poor, sometimes good and juicy, sometimes dry and well done. I keep hoping it is going to be good, but it never is. I'm so disappointed  
The service is super slow, especially behind the bar. 
I really wish this place would get it together, but sadly they still haven't...."}
{"text":"After speaking with many restaurant owners and servers since Saturday when this happened I was told I should write a review. Now I never leave negative reviews bc they aren't needed in today's world but the service my wife and I had on Saturday was horrific and the way the manager handled it was even worse. We come to CBCB almost every Saturday for lunch and we will never be back. 

Long story short the service was awful but when I approached the manager with these exact words 
\"sir can I have the check for that table bc this was the worst \"freakin\" service we have had in a long time\".

He then proceeded to tell me to leave bc I cursed at him which I did not (he was mistaken) and explained numerous times that I didn't and I offered to pay my bill but again was so rude and told me he would take care of it and to leave. He didn't even ask what happened or care about a customer let alone a loyal customer. We have never been treated like this at any restaurant and will never recommend this establishment to anyone we know as long as we live in Az. Being a business owner  myself we always go above and beyond for any customer we deal with no matter the issue."}
{"text":"Staff was awesome, food was great buy pricey.  appetizer, 2 burgers and 5 beers and tip, $90."}
{"text":"Be careful here.  We recently were served an uncooked hotdog covered with sauce.  When we pointed it out to the waiter, he said sorry, the kitchen forgot to cook it,  Urggggg"}
{"text":"Having been to the one in Scottsdale and waited 30 minutes for a burger, I warned my friends that this place may take a while. I had even less hope while trying to get a parking space for lunch (I ended up parking behind the Karate place). Pro tip: Make your own parking spot along the little road that goes through the shopping center, if you know how to parallel park.

Coming in sweaty and last among my group, I was led outside to the back patio. 

Woot. More sweat.

But it actually wasn't bad. The misters did their job in the shade, and we were all quite comfortable. The service was 10 times better than the Scottsdale location. When I couldn't decide between fries and sweet tots, I ordered the fries, but they brought me out a tiny thing of sweet tots to try. They were, of course, delicious (I mean, they are sweet potato tots). So I got an order of them as well, adding on to the Open Pit Burger and fries (I shared).

The place is a bit spendy, with no real lunch menu to speak of. It was about 20 bucks with tip, more than I usually spend for lunch (but that did include the tots). The burgers are large, but the flavor is average. Nothing really pops.

But they know what to do with a potato, and their beer selection is on point (I was there for work, but I perused). That, coupled with great service, made this a pretty good experience. I'll probably go back. On payday."}
{"text":"While they do have a good amount of beer to choose from they're pretty pricey if you're not here during happy hour. The appetizers were pretty good and I enjoyed the buffalo chip dip the best they too were pretty pricey. Overall if your willing to spend some cash to enjoy yourself then this is your place. They have a good amount of TVs and they were  playing hockey so that was a huge plus."}
{"text":"The food here is AMAZING!!! I'm getting hungry just thinking abut it! Their tot-chos are to die for! The service was not so hot, but I was too consumed in deliciousness to pay attention."}
{"text":"Good fun restaurant with good food.  Just watch out for the manager Dan - He's impatient, rude, and arrogant."}
{"text":"Uggg.   I was so excited for this place to open a location in the East Valley because I had been hearing about their fabulous mac and cheese.  I ordered the Budda's Delight mac and cheese and told the waitress to have chef make it al dente and she said no problem.  When my dish arrived, not only was the mac and cheese OVER COOKED, but it was swimming in a tasteless cheese sauce that looked like cheese whiz.  I ordered some truffle oil to see if that would help and it didn't.  Next time I want mac and cheese, I will get the Annie's brand in the box."}
{"text":"Every burger I've tried has been super tasty! Fun place to hang with friends but it can be really loud sometimes."}
{"text":"I wanted to like Cold Beers & Cheeseburgers and I did, but I wouldn't go back. My husband and I came here for dinner on Tuesday night and I enjoyed some of my meal but not all of it. It's a super bright sports bar which I'm not used to, lol, usually there tend to be a little dark inside but not CB&CB, the fluorescents were on 100 that night. My husband ordered the All American burger which is a standard cheese burger with lettuce, tomato, and pickle. It's an extra $2 to sub a different side if you don't want their house chips which my husband did and ordered fries. I ordered the Steakhouse Truffle burger because I felt fancy. It had gruyere, bacon, garlic aioli, white truffle oil, herb butter, baby greens, caramelized onion, and thyme roasted tomatoes. I don't know WHY when reading that it didn't register that that's A LOT on one burger, I just thought it sounded decadent. Well, it was A LOT. The aioli, the butter, and then the truffle oil, it all weighed down the burger tremendously and made it way too soggy and salty. Also, it smelled, lol. I mean it definitely smelled because of the garlic aioli but it was definitely an off-putting smell. I ate half my burger and tossed the rest. The house chips were really good but they were all cooked to different degrees of crispiness and they were all different temperatures as if they had given me some from a previous batch mixed in with a fresh one. My husband liked his burger but he's easy so there's that. Overall, I think it was definitely overpriced and just okay. The burgers were on par with Red Robin but slightly more expensive. Our waitress was super friendly and the service was attentive, it was also pretty packed for a Tuesday night so clearly other people love it but it's a polite yet firm \"no, thank you\" from me."}
{"text":"Ok let me start by saying love the sports bar venue. They had on a good variety of events and UFC for sure so that's a yes. We had great service from Tiara we met two managers both very nice. We had two appetizers they were tasty liked those. The husband had a PB and J burger which he really liked. I had a burger that was supposed to have truffles and yummy cheese bacon etc... it was less than satisfying and when it comes with a price tag close to 16 bucks it should be like mind blowing good.  They took the cost of the burger off without saying a word very nice.  They had only one bottle of the beer I was drinking a bit odd for a Saturday. I would come back for beer and appetizers especially if there was a good event on. The burgers meh!!"}
{"text":"It was a less than overwhelming experience, barely satisfactory. The made-to-order burger was missing the requested sliced onion; the chips served with it were either stale or not very good; and the mac and cheese entree was served at closer to room temperature instead of hot. But there are lots of beers to choose from and lots of televisions with sporting events. Service was also kind of less than attentive for a Saturday night post-dinner time."}
{"text":"Over priced burgers and non attentive service. Owner didn't seem to mind the snail pace."}
{"text":"The best thing about my dinner here was the service.....Sara was awesome!  The food was average though..not as good as I had hoped.  The sweet potato tarot tots were cold...the burger was not made as requested. Seems like an easy thing when I filled out a form. Oh well. The beer was cold"}
{"text":"We have been going to this location since it was Uncle Bears and have been 3 times since the change over to CB&C. First time was great. Sadly enough we will never return after our last adventure. On a not so busy night our food took far too long to arrive. After ordering my burger on the well side of medium, taking my second bite I thought to myself I didn't order guacamole or any other item \"cold, slimy, pasty\" on my burger.  I was right, I didn't! What I was feeling was 100% uncooked, raw meat. I never and I mean never send food back. I did this time as it was disgusting at best. They cooked me a new burger, that I choked down. No manager apology, no break on the bill. And fun is just to begin. It hits me ten minutes after getting home. I will spare you the details. COLD BEERS & CHEESEBURGERS & FOOD POISINING!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"No reason why this should be three stars. Food was great, Lindsay was great. We were a party of 6 and we're out in under an hour. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"TWO WORDS- BUFFLAO TACHOS!!! Holly mama they are good. Beer is great as well and service is usually pretty speedy."}
{"text":"Well let me just start by saying make sure u know how much a double shot of Titos vodk√§ is because I'm pretty damn sure it's not 17 dollars!! Total rip off I asked the waitress and she said she had no idea of anything about alcohol. Food is great and always use to look forward to coming here I am really sad I will never go back here because someone tried to get one over on me because they didn't want to bother telling me what the prices when I asked for it. 
Just compare the prices for a double vodk√§ to that of a club in old Town or even Vegas. Come on guys, it's cold beers and cheeseburgers in Chandler! Not Cosmo or Aria in Vegas!!"}
{"text":"The place is amazing the food is so good I can't explain it. We lost this place and we are so happy to find it again. However the waitress was really busy and was tu I g around. Our beer order took about 20 minutes to get once we spoke to the manager her was amazing and took care of the first round for us. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"It's a good enough burger and the server was very friendly just a little slow. The place was about 20% full maybe less and it took about 40 minutes for our food to come out. We where there for literally an hour and a half for lunch because everything took so long but my grandma had a coupon so we got two drinks and two burgers for $15 bucks. Probably wouldn't go back and pay full price, I guess let's see if grandma gets another coupon!"}
{"text":"Always a great experience here. Been to several locations, north Scottsdale , old town Scottsdale, 7th street and PV. My go to on Sunday afternoons for sure. Truffle burger is the buisness, juicy Lucy if you wanna get wild. Love this place, oh and the buffalo dip will send you to the moon."}
{"text":"I would like to preface this by saying this is the only review I have ever written, but I felt compelled to after my buddies recently went there.  I read some reviews about how expensive it was and the poor service before hand.  I decided to take my buddies there anyway because it was right down the road and gourmet burgers sounded good. 
Anyways like most of the other reviews said the service was horrible. Our waitress took our order and then ignored us for the next 30 minutes, which is how long it took me to flag her down to even ask about our burgers. She told us they were plating them and would be out in a minute. She did not apologize or give an excuse as to why it took so long, she simply ignored us until it was time to give us our checks. The food probably came out 10 minutes after that. 40 minutes to make 3 burgers is far too long to wait.  At this point we are starving and excited to eat these burgers. We all ordered our burgers cooked medium and they were all cooked differently. The taste of the burger was ok, neither bad or good.  So for a beer and a burger I think our tab was $24, which is obviously far too much for a so-so burger and the worst service I have experienced.
Don't be like us and read the reviews and try it anyway. This is somewhere to avoid."}
{"text":"There's so many places better than here. The service was terrible, outdated drink menu, food was decent but nothing to brag about. All in all, not a good experience. The hostess was not very good. The server took forever to get our drink order, and even longer to get a food order. When told \"I'll be right back\", she meant \"I'll see you in 15-20 minutes.\" Just don't go here. Seriously, don't. Chips as a main side? Is this Subway?! Also, there was a fly in my beer. Definitely not coming back again."}
{"text":"What a great find...and of all places, next to our gym. Lol! 

We went for a late workout and was starving after our workout. We walked into the restaurant and there were lots of people but not too busy. Tons of tv's around the whole restaurant and I'm sure it would be perfect to catch a game there. 

I'll start by saying that the portions are big so don't over order like we did. We started with the tot chou (nacho tater tots), I ordered one of the burgers suggested by our server (believe it was called the hangover), my husband ordered a burger and my girls got chicken fingers and corned dog. All our meals came with homemade chips which were delicious. The tots were out of this world good and so bad for my belly. At least we went for a workout before this so healthy meal right after. Haha! Our burgers were good and we still had half of it left. Yes, we over ordered but we were hungry.

Did I mention that kids eat free on Tuesday's? Yes, they eat free if their under the age of 12. Score! I think I'll start a blog of all the places that offer a free kids meal because this is the second place we've found recently. 

We can't wait for football season because we want to catch a game."}
{"text":"This is a sport's bar-but our grandsons love it!  Loud, TVs, French fries and lots of kid friendly food and servers.  We love going on create your own burger night.  service was very thoughtful and helped out wherever they could to get our toddler grandson his food asap!"}
{"text":"Sierra was extremely kind, attentive and gave great beer suggestions! Had an awesome experience, thanks CB Squared!"}
{"text":"Okay been here to meet some of my friends in the East Valley and let me say this place rocks! Every one knows I am a fan of these guys and what they do and this may be the best Cold Beers and Cheeseburgers yet, sorry old town.

There are 42 TV's in this place so watching the big game won't be a problem. Their beer list seems to get even better as time marches on. The service was spot on and the bartender Jerome is amazing.

I know they just opened and like anything I am sure there was some hiccups along the way, but not on my visit.

So if you are looking for a solid place to dine that isn't your usual cookie cutter corporate  place, give this place a try, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Okay, I have had a chance to be back in a couple of times now since our boys are now playing baseball for SCR and most practices and games are in North Scottsdale. I have to admit I have read some other reviews and I just don't get it, every time I go with the boys we have a good meal at a great price and enjoy our selves.

With that said, we went just a coupe of nights ago and I was totally impressed they have remolded and made this corner spot In Greyhawk a must see. They now have a much bigger bar that opens up to the out side and have expanded their patio and added some booths, and yes they even added more TV's

So take what you want from the reviews, but if you want a good burger in a casual neighborhood setting, give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Great neighborhood hang out. Massive amounts of TV's and over 125 beers on draught, bottles & cans.   Happy hour ranges from 3-6pm Monday thru Friday with a great discount on Four Peaks Products. There are plenty of seating options with a ton of booths. Patio is set to open mid January which will be a nice addition. So whether your hanging with the guys for a Game or out with the family, Cold Beers & Cheeseburgers has you covered. PS try the PBJ Burger it is sooooo good!"}
{"text":"We know CBCB is growing and they now have 7 or 8 locations and I have been to probably every one. However, this just may be the best CBCB yet. First the building itself is pretty amazing. It sits in the heart of the Central Corridor on 7th street between Missouri and Bethanyhome. The exterior wood, the metal and patio are very inviting.

Interior: From the time you walk in and see the big window on the keg cooler directly behind the host stand to the pure awesomeness of all the TV's inside you can't help but be in awe!

Food: I went out of the norm and went with the PBJ burger which our server suggested and it was out of this world. I know it doesn't seem like Bacon, Peanut Butter, Jelly and Chipotle should ever be combined together, let alone on a burger....but it was amazing!

Beer: Over 150 selections between Draughts, Cans or Bottles, enough said. I went with the house CBCB IPA that Four Peaks made for these guys. It was surprising light and refreshing, more in line with a sessions IPA than a traditional hoppy IPA. 

Service: Good, very personable and was able to answer all our questions. This is a busy store but wouldn't think it just opened in late March. Seems like these guys have the magic touch and can't wait to see where they open next.

Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"well after reading the reviews I thought I would give it a try as i was in the area.....I was expecting less but got more....good beer at a good price...for some reason they are on special on the weekend...not sure where it says that but the bartender did...$4 for a 19 ounce four peaks...burger was at bit spendy at $12 but the truffle and Gruyere was great...I will definitely pick up some local dines coupons when they come out and be back.. they it will be good value....also the fries were not hot but when mentioned fresh super hot ones arrived...the Chipotle ketchup was great too"}
{"text":"Went for both Mothers Day and Fathers Day.  Had wonderful time.  Everyone was great.  Looking forward to returning.  I recommend the Prime Burger!"}
{"text":"Bad, bad customer service. 2pm we walked in; sign says wait to be seated. Three employees saw us yet none even acknowledged us. One female by bar, another female wrapping silverware, and male came out of kitchen - they need customer service training. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere, but if you're placing a take out order, be sure to double check your order before you leave. We've now ordered 3 times and so far they're 0 for 3 on getting it right. Fortunately, we've learned from this so we now get it fixed before we leave, but we're perplexed on why they can't just get it right the first time."}
{"text":"The burger was ok, the tater tots so so but it was terribly loud. Took forever to get the check. Too long a drive for so so."}
{"text":"We went around 5:45 on a Friday night, there was a 45 minute wait for a table for two. Luckily, we were able to secure two seats at the bar within about 15 minutes.

My husband and I have a theory that the best servers are promoted to bartenders, so bartenders are a reflection of the quality of service at a restaurant. I felt like we had to beg for attention every time we needed something (to order a beer or a glass of water or meal, get napkins, close out our tab, get a to go box). There were 4 bartenders plus a bar back on duty, even though they seemed busy they still had time to chat with regulars (after one week of being open? More like friends).

The highlight of our meal was the $5 pretzels with cheese dip (happy hour price). The mustard drummettes were good but not $11 good. Our two burgers with what seemed like unseasoned frozen crinkle cut french fries added up to $30, not worth the price whatsoever. My hubby had the prime burger, and the prime rib on top was meh and seemed like it was previously frozen as well.

We may go back for beer and appetizers someday when we are nearby and desperately thirsty, but that is about it."}
{"text":"We come here often. The food is decent pub fare. We were here Sunday morning with puppy to sit on outdoor patio. NO DOGS ALLOWED ON OUTSIDE PATIO. Virtually every outdoor patio in Phx allows dogs. Plus service is slow. If they allowed dogs 4 stars because macaroni and cheese is the bomb."}
{"text":"Good food,  service unexceptional. Several servers/hosts standing around talking and looking confused."}
{"text":"Great food and Hannah was great waitress the atmosphere is great also. Had hotdogs for the first time today and they were great.  Chips. Are the best!"}
{"text":"Not much has changed.  This place still pretty much stinks.  The only things I like here are the sweet potato tots and the Diet Coke.  THE SERVICE IS TERRIBLE EVERY SINGLE TIME WITHOUT FAIL!!!! DO NOT EXPECT ANY ATTENTION TO BE PAID TO YOU. YOU WILL NOT FEEL THE SLIGHTEST BIT IMPORTANT.  YOUR ORDER WILL LIKELY BE WRONG!!!  

My husband asked for a turkey burger with no garlic whatever sauce on it.  Of course, it came with it on it. They apologized.  Then instead of just making him a new burger, they told us they were just going to throw it back on the grill and that sauce would melt right back off.  ?????  They said it would take about 10 minutes.  WHAT?!?!?  Wouldn't you think the meat would be too tough after 10 extra minutes on the grill?

To make things worse while we were waiting, some dude (likely the manager) came up to our table and asked if either of us drove a Ford truck.  \"NO, I DRIVE A 7SERIES BMW.  DO I LOOK LIKE A DRIVE A FORD TRUCK?  WHY?\"  He walked away without answering.  It was because a Ford truck was parked in their 15 minute only to go parking spot we figured out.  

So I had already finished my chicken Caesar salad, no turkey burger for my husband yet. I'm still hungry because my salad was pathetically small for an entree salad and he's starving because he still has no food.  I look back behind me several times trying to spot the waitress to get her attention.  Finally I have to get up and walk to the frick'n hostess stand to order my 1/2 sweet tots 1/2 french fry because she's just standing there talking to the guy who had nothing better to to 10 minutes ago than walk around asking people if they owned Ford trucks. 

Anyway, the whole lunch experience took about 2 hours.  TOO LONG.  TOO ANNOYING. WILL NOT BE BACK."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here to watch the game and oh boy was it hype! The atmosphere was great. This place has so many big screens that there isn't a bad seat in the house. The wait staff was pleasant but my meal (buffalo chicken sliders) was not good. Fortunately, my companion enjoyed his cheeseburger sliders very much! I highly recommend this place but not the buffalo sliders. They were messy and too salty and the buffalo sauce was too tangy."}
{"text":"The booths are too small. While the food was decent  the booth tables are very small and the seats are so close together i could barely fit betwee the seat and the table. It made things way too crowded and actually unpleasant. Service was slower than treacle. I think it will take a lot to get me back there."}
{"text":"The food was amazing! We had the Arizona burger, Veggie burger, 1000 island burger, the ring of fire, chili Mac dog, and the kids Mac n cheese. The burgers were made perfect and the tator tots and onion rings were so crispy! Jen was our server and did an amazing job with our large group! We will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"What is there to say about this place-  comfort food at its finest.  Their buffalo tachos are amazing.    Service is always great no matter how busy they get.   I wish they would offer some of their specialty burgers in sliders-  would love to try some of the edgier burgers but don't want to commit to the whole thing haha  There is alot of bun- but they are so filled with ingredients i usuallly end up eating them with a fork any way.    Best place for a first date so you can REALLY see who they are :)"}
{"text":"Went tonight with my children visiting from out of state... my husband and I stated that we would be splitting a burger and fries....  we got our food and ate...we waited quite a while to get our bill... when it arrived we were charged $4 to split the burger and fries even though the waitress never told us we would be charged for it ... which is something that should be mentioned to let people know they will be charged ... we never would have a greed to it as all we would have done is cut it in half... they wouldn't take the charge off . Complete nonsense!"}
{"text":"Service was very poor, had to be ask to be waited on at the bar,no one acknowledged us for more than 5 minutes. Bartender then took 10 minutes to get our order. Food took about 15 minutes and was cold when it arrived."}
{"text":"Their newest location. They close the one up north and Grayhawk to open up this location and I think they did well. It's two or three times the size plus much better layout crowd staff food and beer. Definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"I'm not into beer so I've been putting off going here. That was a mistake because the burgers are great and make the place. I had the Bacon Bleu burger and it was excellent. They didn't overdo the cheese and the burger was cooked just right. They give you a ton of french fries. You won't go hungry here!"}
{"text":"Be prepared for disappointment if you choose to BYOB \"build your own burger\" as the kitchen got all 3 of our orders incorrect. From cooking temperature (med-well came out med-rare) to additional add-ons (cheese, avocado, etc) will be missing. Server went to fix with no problem and the manager Derek B. came by to ,I can only assume confirm mistakes, which he then asked \"what's wrong with the order?\" as we repeated the mistakes he proceeded to ask us to \"check our attitude\" as if answering his question was rude?! He then went on to say WE made the server uncomfortable, we repeated she was perfect, our disappointment was with him and his lack of decorum. He then yelled across the dining room \"yes our servers are perfect, apparently just like all of you!\". What. A. Professional?! 
Find a Cold beer and Cheeseburger LITERALLY anywhere else."}
{"text":"Not impressed.  We had looked at the menu before, but could not justify $15-$20 burgers from a strip mall sports bar, but we received a buy-one-get-one-free coupon, so we thought we'd see what made a burger $$.  The menu clearly stated their definitions for rare, medium rare, etc, and we ordered accordingly.  Both burgers were over-cooked by one to two levels.  The pattties looked like pre-formed frozen patties from Costco.  You know the look...round, but perfectly flat and a squared off edge that only occurs in a factory.  The service was also really slow.  We ordered 2 burgers, and drank water and the bill, before coupon, came to $35.  The coupon did cut it in half, so before tip we paid $17.50.  Aside from the meat being over-cooked, they did taste good, but not $17 burger good, maybe $9 burger good.  

All-in-all, my low rating can be summed up this way: 

Over-priced, Over-cooked, and Under-served."}
{"text":"This place was awesome! The only gripe is that the parking situation is terrible!! The lot is too small and fills up quickly. The food was great and the waitress was awesome!! Even in a packed house we had great service!! Definitely recommend!!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place more then I did. The food was super delicious and the smores dessert was fun but the service was pretty bad.  The smores kit didn't even come out to make an even amount of smores. I believe it said it served 4, however there were not enough graham crackers to have a complete smore and there  was just a random amount of chocolate and marshmallows. I would expect 8 crackers, 4 marshmallows, 4 chocolates, I mean those aren't high quantities to count to, so should be pretty simple.  We also waited long amounts of time before a server would come to our table, therefore drink refills were few and far between.

The food was excellent! I thoroughly enjoyed my burger and wing chips."}
{"text":"My first time here and I've decided that this will be my friendly neighborhood sports bar.  We both ordered the build-your-own mac and cheese which is the Monday special (any topping selections for $12.). I was extremely impressed!  For what looks like a little sports bar from the outside, the kitchen is stellar.  The cocktails were good and fairly priced.  And the Oreo sundae was to die for.  I'm pretty sure I reached my full calorie intake in one meal, but it was well worth it.  In addition to the great food/menu, the friendly staff and over 30 TVs ( and no that is not a typo), I really love this place. I can even overlook the country music to come here.  This will be a date night place again soon."}
{"text":"With a name like Cold Beers & Cheeseburgers, how could this place not be great?  I've had this place bookmarked for years since one of my galfriends use worked here.  It's about time we gave them a try!

We decided to swing by for dinner before punishing our livers at a Halloween party.  The four of us ordered two orders of chicken strips, a bowl of onion rings, half an order of Original Tot Chos, and a Buddha's Delight Mmmac & Cheese to share.  The chicken strips and onion rings were basic but the Original Tot Chos and Buddha's Delight Mmmac & Cheese were BLISS!  Anything with a copious amount of cheese is more than okay with me.  If I didn't had such a filling lunch, I would have loved to try one of their \"award-winning cheeseburgers.\"  Guess I have to be back!

Despite two of us looking like zombies, service was excellent on this busy Saturday night.  They were friendly and attentive and the place was clean.  The boys let us know that there are televisions in the men's restroom so you never have to miss a moment of whatever game you were watching.  Nice."}
{"text":"Not impressed. I got the CB&CB burger, which sound promising, with thw sweet potato tots. Burger was cooked right but it was bland. My boyfriend got the standard char dog and, being from Chicago, he didnt find it to be very good either. They also char over a gas grill, not a charcoal like expected.
This place is also a sport's bar, so it was very loud which makes sense. There were families eating here, so I assume it's kid friendly. The bathroom was a mess and smelled like sewage.
I suppose there could be worse places, but I'll never be coming back here."}
{"text":"YUM!!!!!  In the mood for a great burger? better stop here. I recommend the bar area or the patio, if you sit inside you're going to be asked every few minutes \"how is everything.\" the Bartenders are on it, make suggestions on drinks and food. Oh and don't forget to try the homemade onion dip with crispy homemade chips!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Have been here twice before and really liked it. Good burgers, and can do gluten free burgers and fries are also gluten free (no cross contamination) which is really rare and a huge bonus.

This time was terrible and we may not come back. We sat at our table for over an hour with no food (and a two year old). They eventually brought out the kids sliders about 45 minutes in. We never did get our food at the table...a bit over an hour in and food finally comes, to the table next to us who had arrived after us. I actually feel worse for the people on the other side who had been waiting even longer than us. 

We finally got them to just pack it up for us to go. Apparently was an issue for everything coming out of the kitchen and had been that way for three hours. Yikes. 

Still two stars cause of really good gluten-free non  gluten contaminated French fries."}
{"text":"We always enjoy the burgers and sandwiches here. The beer selection is great. Staff are friendly. Great outdoor seating too."}
{"text":"Why did it take 40 minutes to get my burger?
How does a cook make a burger topped with BBQ sauce, Bacon and Onion Rings that is completely absent of flavor? 
How is it possible for a side of chips to come out slightly below room temperature? 
Why did I just pay $35 for two mediocre burgers and a beer? 
These are questions no customer should have to ask themselves on a Monday evening."}
{"text":"Seen a few of these around the Phoenix area - I mean, I like both those things sooooo...

Really it should be named \"Cold Beers, Cheeseburgers, and a bunch of TVs\". Every wall and window has a TV the size of your dining room table, no joke, at least 30 TVs. 

The beer selection is great, lots of local stuff in bottles and cans and some on tap. We went on a Tuesday night, 1/2 of wine bottles and $3 cans of beer. 

We had mozzarella sticks (meh), a BLT, and the O-line burger (grilled cheese buns & a Juicy Lucy (cheese stuffed) beef patty). The burger was a bit much, I'd order something smaller next time. It turns out the 4 slices of bread from the grilled cheese don't quite balance out with the rest of the burger, especially the crusts. A bun would have been better.

The tots and fries were good, the chips too dry. Chips aren't my thing, but they seemed right on the brink of being burnt. 

Service was good, but nothing wowed me burger-wise - I'd prefer a couple other chain places that I won't name here.  Overall, acceptable, but not a standout. I'll probably be back for sports-watching."}
{"text":"This is a great spot to watch a sporting event! Large screens on EVERY wall inside and out. The food was above average for a sports bar. However, they could add a few more healthy appetizers. We ordered the Asparagus & Tomatoes, which was the \"healthiest\" app on the menu. It was delicious, but a bit too oily. My hamburger was cooked to perfection. I like being able to order to my specifications - toppings, wellness, etc. My boyfriend ordered the Mac & Cheese with grilled chicken and broccoli. Delicious! I thought he was going to lick the bowl! Drinks were good and cold. We sat at the bar and the service by Megan was excellent. Her shift ended before we were finished and unfortunately, the other bartender pissed me off with her flirtations towards my boyfriend. Totally uncool!!!"}
{"text":"Decent burger, but over priced. $18 plus a tip for a burger, chips and a soft drink. It did however include a soggy bun. Add a $3 side to avoid the charcoal chips... Service was great!!"}
{"text":"Super full! Came here on a drop of a dine, had the misters going, games on, beer flowing and burgers grillin! Great place to chow down for lunch or dinner. I had the juicy Lucy with cheese in the burger, made me stuffed. A little spicy which I like. 

J had the Monterey Chicken sandwich and loved it. Neither of us could finish our tots. Got some cold beer while we were at it. She has strongbow cherry blossom and I had a XX. 

Good vibes, our waitress was super cool and honest about the menu!"}
{"text":"It's a great night at Cold Beer and cheeseburgers, Brilliant food, lovely bartenders in Kimmy and Meghan, Gary kicks butt behind the bar as well,  wicked good burgers too! pop in for a football game, the Tvs and atmosphere are awesome!
Cheers!"}
{"text":"Bloody Mary's were weak. Tasted like v8 with a tiny splash of vodka. The worst part about this place though is how slow the service is. Although the food is good and this place has a nice setup for watching the games I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Worst sports bar I have ever been too. Service was terrible and the food was overrated. The fries we ordered were cold and the burger that we got was under cooked with blood coming out if it and when I tried to take it back the waitress gave me such a hard time about it. Don't waste your money here!"}
{"text":"Dani and Vanessa are the best bartenders around! Make sure to sit at the bar to get the best service!"}
{"text":"This is now my second visit to this location my first visit was on their grand opening week.  First experience was below average and considerably poor, from service to the food. After several months I decided to try it out one last time and had the exact same experience."}
{"text":"Crazy fast service, accurate Nowait status, and great food. Highly recommend! Had the Mmmac burger, tots, and a couple beers. I'll be going back for sure."}
{"text":"Since I was in the mood for s burger, decided to look for someplace nearby that I have not tried yet and came across Cold Beers & Cheeseburgers which is located off Shea but was hidden away in a small retail center.

Upon arriving, found that they have a great bar setup with patio seating (including at the bar with the wall open) as well as the usual selection of tables and booths inside.

Was promptly welcomed and seated by the staff.

The drink menu is pretty extensive especially for beer drinkers, so take your time and check out both the draught list as well as bottled selection.

Yes, they carry a lot of the mass market beers (you know who they are) as well as many of the craft labels they have acquired, fortunately there is a decent selection from both local and other independent craft brewers available as well.

Burgers? Another area that offers a wide selection of options including a B.Y.O.B. (build your own burger, no bring your own booze).

Tried their Prime Rib Burger which was AWESOME!!!

Heaping of sliced prime rib on top of a nice thick burger patty, cooked exactly as I had requested (can't image how difficult that actually is).

Another thing that helped me decide to try CBC was the sweet (potato) tots on their menu since I can not eat regular potatoes anymore.

Want to jazz it up? Ask for a side of their buffalo sauce (guessing homemade), just be warned that when dipping hot tots into the sauce, you could inhale vinegar & pepper fumes combined with the spicy heat can make you cough on the first mouthful.

Anyways, I think I have found another place to to add to my top 5 favorite burger and beer joints here in Scottsdale!!"}
{"text":"Really nothing to get excited about & don't understand the big deal; just another sports bar, burgers below ave & beers so, so...the attic runs circles around this place. Btw no pkg--the new norm...thank lgNo! Ps patio cover looks like a gas station! Psps the manager did reach out which is appreciated & will give another go..."}
{"text":"The food is decent. Good selection of beers and happy hour prices... But for those who get duped into buying a Groupon, buyer beware... If you use a Groupon, you will NOT get happy hour prices. This is the ONLY restaurant that has ever pulled this crap. I basically had to pay full price for my family tonight. Was totally pointless on using the Groupon. Shame on you CBCB, for deceiving customers like this. I will be hard pressed to recommend this place now to any friends and colleagues."}
{"text":"Well, if you have \"Cheeseburgers\" in your business' name, one would think your kitchen staff was trained to cook a burger...medium rare = dead as a door nail...We emphasized MR when we ordered but when the burgers arrived it was so overcooked, it was gasping for air!

The bartender was very attentive and very apologetic (she comp'd the \"cheeseburger\" but did so saying said she was scared to question the kitchen staff).

The place was packed and this was our first time so I'll cut some slack and may return if I'm thirsty for a cold beer but I'm not sure I'd waste my money on their cheeseburgers."}
{"text":"Second time in a row they screwed up my burger.  This time when asked to correct they scraped off blue cheese (ordered provolone) and just put cheese on old burger and added the bacon they forgot!  Waitress when asked said no she saw them make it (hard to do as she was in the restaurant area not kitchen).  Avoid this place!"}
{"text":"Strip mall location, on the corner at the north end.  Draft selection was unimpressive, with quite a few taps dedicated to faux craft like Blue Moon and overtly labeled Coors/Miller/Bud, thought they did have a few local crafts and macro imports.  Bottle selection offered more variety, but for going out it's draft I'm looking for.

Food was above average, and certainly better than BluBurger that was nearby with a similar theme.  Side of chips was skimpy and out of ratio for a burger that size.   Bartender, Matilda, was painfully slow and mostly attentive to the three ladies that seemed to be her friends.  Having an empty beer mug while laughter and casual chat take place can be frustrating to say the least.

Edit/update: after several visits the service is worse each time, and the errors on the orders are very common.  And it's not just the wrong menu item the first time, but then the corrected item comes out wrong again too.  Food takes far too long.  At first I thought it was just because it seemed busy, but even when it's dead it takes just as long."}
{"text":"I went here tonight for dinner with my family. The beer selection was great! I've been to other locations and was excited to have a delicious burger but was extremely let down. I ordered the Juicy Lucy which was supposed to be stuffed with cheddar-Jack cheese. Not sure where the cheese or the Juicy part of the burger was. The bun was an oversized stale roll that was not even edible. My dad ordered the chili Mac hotdog and it was nothing more than a hotdog covered in hamburger helper. Eeek!!

As if the food wasn't bad enough the server was completely clueless on what the daily specials were and she probably could use some more training. 

I will admit this is a much better restaurant than Uncle Bears was. They have a great beer selections and the new TVs they installed will be great for football season. 

I'll try this location again and hopefully they will have worked out the kinks."}
{"text":"Ugh...do yourself a favor and try any of the other awesome places on 7th street. Slow service, generic chainy type food. This place is fine if you're not expecting high quality food. There are too many great options for me to go back and eat at this basic place. 2 stars because at least the beer selection was good."}
{"text":"First I want to start off by saying that the atmosphere and beer selection at this place is great. That's where it ends though.

I sat at the bar, and the bartenders all look as if they don't wanna be there. Not friendly and at one point became argumentative about starting a tab. I pointed out that I thought I had started one so it was just a miscommunication, but to argue with me about it? Seriously? The bartenders were just rude, not attentive at all and barely spoke a word.

This review is purely on service, I'll return in the future to try their food. I'm not gonna give up on this place just yet."}
{"text":"First time here. It was Sunday football day. We got there early for food only. First impression was good. Lots of room. Lots of big screen TV's. The hostess sat us at a good table and gave us menus. The sever came over and asked if we wanted anything other than. Ayer to drink. We both said no, she turned around and walked away without saying anything. We wanted to order a appetizer. It she walked away. She came back with 2 waters sat them on the table and walked away again without saying a word. When she cam back we both ordered a cheeseburger the same. Ay so we did not make her mad or confuse the server.  After a while she brought our food too us. I asked for the check which she promptly brought to the table without a word. Later the Manger \"Mark\" came by the table to ask how were we doing. I told him I like the restaurant if I would make a comment on yelp about the server we had. Very poor service"}
{"text":"Awesome if you want 87 TVs and to be surrounded by Bros and Arcadia types. Good news the burger was decent. Very corporate vibe."}
{"text":"Hooter-esque type place with lots of big screens with various games on them and pretty waitresses with very small tops. My husband greatly enjoyed his humongous burger.  Said the beer was good too. I'm on a keto diet and thought I was safe ordering a bunless turkey burger, but took one bite and it was very obvious that a good portion of it is breading. I was prepared to just eat my side salad and take the turkey home to my son, but the waitress had the manager come out. Totally unexpected since I just asked about the breading and asked for a box to go. He was very nice and semi twisted my arm until I ordered a chicken breast, lol. It was tasty and juicy and I left stuffed and happy. Very nice and relaxing meal before our comedy show date. We'd definitely go back."}
{"text":"Bacon PB & J burger was amazing!  Also had two kids under 10 in our party for lunch and the waitresses were great with them."}
{"text":"We have come to really enjoy this place for a family of 5! Prices are fair, portions are big, service is good and the beer selection is super!"}
{"text":"To keep it simple: the food is great, but the service is completely unacceptable. The severs pick and choose who they want to check on and ignore the rest. I've been to this location 4 times now, and whether they're slammed or empty, it always takes at least 45 minutes to get our food! At least one thing always comes out wrong, and you have to ask for refills, boxes, and the check. They have music playing ridiculously loud, so everyone has to yell which makes it very noisy both inside and out. And probably the one of the most irritating; they charge you extra if you want any side besides chips! (Even though fries and chips are the same price on the menu). Don't come here expecting fast, friendly service. The food is literally the only thing this place has going for it."}
{"text":"Needed a burger and a beer so thought I'd check this place out. 

Sat at the bar and the service was pretty good (got a beer quickly but then had to ask for a menu). 

As mentioned the tap selection is ok but nothing to write home about. Bottle selection is decent. If it was my place I'd have more on tap and have bigger west coast beers (especially with \"beer\" in the name) but I'm a Seattle/Portland beer snob kinda guy. I'd give beer selection 3 stars. 

Place gets one star as I bit into my burger only to find out that it was basically raw (not a little pink but blood red). If you are selling burgers they should always be cooked through unless the customer asks for it to be cooked differently. If I want e-coli then I'll ask for it. Ate my tots (which tasted as they had a grease filling)... Server notice my barely touched burger and asked if it was ok. Told him it was raw to which he replied he liked it that way. Yeah, I don't care how you like it. And there was no offer to \"fix\" it... Hence one star. I want to like this place but really can't recommend it at this time."}
{"text":"This review solely concerns chicken wings, please know this. 2 Stars means exactly what it says \" I've experienced better\" and yes, I surely have .  The wings, which are actually drumettes, no flats , came in three flavors and I decided to get the classic buffalo which ended up not being hot at all, despite what the waitress had told me.  To my disapproval the wings also arrived at room temp.  Wings (used to ) generally come with celery which to me is strange because at some point in history we changed our standard and have lost carrots and celery as the standard pairing item.  The menu stated that the wings came with veggies, which is great because again, that is rare, but the veggies did not show when the wings were dropped off .  When I asked where the veggies were, the waitress said \" You have to ask for those, we do not just give them to you.\" Weird... the menu says it comes with veggies but you must ask.  Anyway, she brought them, and there were both carrots and celery, woo.  Why am I focusing so much on the veggies?! Because the veggies ended up being better than the wings...I have had way better wings.  I probably will not return, but give it a shot yourself and check it out.  The staff was friendly, which I think should be the norm and not considered anything out of the ordinary, but then again we ARE living in strange times..."}
{"text":"My Party and I went here for the Superbowl and Hunter ran such a tight shift. the whole night was so much fun the staff was on it and Hunter made the whole night amazing. thank for that. I will continue to visit and have a great time with this place. part 2 we went back the day after Valentines and got treated like Kings & Queens.. Hunter Keep up the good work. you are the reason we will return with friends."}
{"text":"Great food, amazing happy hour and an awesome environment.  Went once for a work get-together and just had to go back! LOVE the tot-chos (buffalo chicken ones are amazing!) and I was very impressed to find my FAVORITE beer (from Coronado Island Brewery) on TAP! Woohoo, we love this place!!"}
{"text":"I have a high tolerance but this was a little crazy. Went there today at 4 with my son. It took forever to get served. I counted over 16 on the floor plus 3 behind the bar. Restaurant was busy but not packed and for the amount of staff on this shouldn't have been a problem. Order an app and a burger. Long story short. Burger came out so dry and app apparently got lost and so was our server the majority of the time. After eating the burger we said that we no longer wanted the app. Again after waiting for our bill the server said \"I didn't charge you for the app.\"  Lol. We never got it. One male in the place, must have been a manager but never touched tables. Although great Tvs."}
{"text":"Packed for Warriors/Thunder game 7.  Food still came out super fast. Steak house burger was amazing!"}
{"text":"Built my own masterpiece burger with mushrooms, cheese, bacon all was cooked perfectly. Beautiful sports athmosphe. Excited to watch some games there soon. Bar area was comfortable and pleasant."}
{"text":"First, the burger (bacon cheese burger) was good.  Beer was not really that cold.  However, and this is the key part...one aforementioned burger, beer and tip really (and I mean really) wasn't worth the $24 it cost me.  Price to value just isn't there.  Too many places I can get the same meal for similar or better quality for far less.

Most likely a 3.5 for food.  Downgrade for cost.  If you're cool with the cost factor, then I recommend."}
{"text":"We were there Sunday for lunch. They were fairly busy but we were seated right away and our server showed up within a minute. My burger was very tasty and was cooked just as I ordered it. They have a nice selection of beers. Overall I was pleased, much better than the first time I was at this location when they first opened. I'll be back."}
{"text":"To start off I have to say our service was great. Our waters, sodas and teas were never empty. Our waitress came back several times to ask if we needed anything and hostess that sat us was happy and smiling.

It was a good visit but nothing really stood out. Food came out quick and hot but for the price point and hype I guess I expected way more. 

The place is hip and trendy with the upscale sports bar feel, lots of TV's with any kind of sport imaginable on.

The food although picture perfect was just average. We ordered several appetizers to share, a buffalo totchos and a CB onion dip. One BYO burger. The tots fried perfectly and the buffalo sauce and blue cheese was flavorful but there wasn't enough of either and the thin sliced chicken had no taste and didn't really add anything to the dish. The onion dip and homemade chips were good too but again just average. The BYO burger was ordered with onion, pickles, bacon and lettuce. Patty was thick, maybe a little too thick, cooked well but honestly tasted like any other burger place in town with a little more from my pocket.

We opted to not have alcohol but the beer list is lengthy and they have something for everyone.

We will return, everything was good it just didn't blow us away. It's a casual, centrally located joint with a upbeat vibe."}
{"text":"This is a Drive for me to get to this location, but I keep doing it because it has proven itself better than some of their other locations.  Lots of food for the money, friendly service, lots of game action on the televisions, and a huge amount of beer selections.  We drive 45 minutes to get here, and it's worth it!"}
{"text":"First time going.  While the food was ok it wasn't great like another burger joint in downtown Gilbert.  We had the Buffalo chicken egg rolls as an app and enjoyed that much better then our burgers.  Prices are high enough as is but then they start nickel and diming you for any extras.  Also not sure what the deal was with the flies but they were all over the place .  Other then the app the burgers wouldn't bring me back"}
{"text":"Cold Beers and Cheeseburgers

First time at this location, very newly opened restauant and very nice fill with TV monitors everywhere.

Had the Pastrami Burger with Tater Tots. Tots come in a metal cup were nice and crisp, but the burger is the star of this place. Nice burger Patty cook as requested medium rare piled with pastrami which complimented each other nicely.

Jordyn our server was spot on with taking care of us making sure we had everything we needed and our drinks were always filled."}
{"text":"I really want to like this place, but it always falls short every time we stop by. Tonight it was a toss up between CBCB and Culinary Dropout and we decided to grab some burgers. I ordered the BBQ bacon burger and asked for it to be cooked medium rare, with a side of tots. My tots were warm, but not hot, and my burger was burnt and dry. The manager offered to remake my food for free, but by the time he had come, everyone at my table had finished eating. In the end, I sent my food back and our check was comped. Our server was sincere about apologizing for the mishap. I appreciate the FOH staff trying to make things right, but we've given this place so many opportunities. They just don't execute well with the food. It seems that every time we've visited either our food is overcooked, something is missing, or the service is amiss. We all decided that we're not going to frequent this location any longer. Try stopping at the one in Old Town Scottsdale or Gilbert if you really want to come here."}

{"text":"Meh....
Food was good.  Service was adequate. Nice place.  Management was awesome....
Buuut if you are a girl forget it.  They only pay attention to men....tips and all....you know it goes.

My experience..my husband commented that the waitress mad him uncomfortable because she only spoke to him and ignored me.

...also..we had two people try to help us.  When we said we were already being serviced the waitress rolled her eyes.......tip territory drama anyone?

So yeah....and overalll meh....  I certainly will not come back by myself or with my girlfriends...because the waitresses are sexist."}
{"text":"The truffle burger, onion rings, and sweet potato tots are absolutely the best we have ever had! The burger is unbelievable! It's our favorite restaurant now."}
{"text":"Great service and great food. We ended up playing trivia too and it was so much fun! Highly recommend for anyone looking for a fun evening out."}
{"text":"We live in the neighborhood and my kids watched this place be built from the ground up as we pass it multiple times a day driving to and from school etc. they have been begging to go! Had heard mixed reviews from neighbors but finally gave in to the children begging.  The TVs were SO loud it was deafening...took the server 30 minutes just to ask what we wanted to drink and then 40 min after sitting down I finally had water and later after THAT a cocktail too which was so sickly sweet I couldn't even drink it and I never send stuff Back!!"}
{"text":"I drove by this place many many times and I think today is a great day to try their burgers. 

They have a huge selections from appetizers, burgers and other items that you might like. Happy hour is between 4-6pm which includes different types of beer. For my main entree, I ordered a Arizona Burger with hummus as an appetizer. Both dishes were absolutely delicious. Our waitress was attentive, friendly and checked up on us very often. The entire restaurant is surrounded by many tv , but yet it was quiet enough for you to chat with your guests. If you show them your yelp coupon, they will honor the 10% discount. 

There are several dessert that I wanted to try on my next visit. I'll definitely come back here again."}
{"text":"The name says  it all.  Good food, good drinks, good atmosphere at a decent price.  Busy even on a Sunday evening.  The sweet potato  tots are great!"}
{"text":"Great food. It's been a while since I've found a place that can cook a burger medium rare, but these guys can. The service is average, seem to be ignored unless you're a regular. But worth the visit for the burgers"}
{"text":"Coming from Vegas and the variety of burger places we have, this restaurant ranks on my top 5 burger places! We started with shareables, Original Tot Chots and an order of drummettes(sweet citrus teriyaki & classic buffalo). The tots were golden crispy, generous amount of guac & sour cream and loved that the drummettes were grilled but still juicy! Since it was a burger joint, we could not leave without trying one of their burgers. We decided to go with The Juicy Lucy-fer. MOUTHWATERING in every bite. The picture I took did not do it any justice. Juicy, cheesy, thick patty... All I have to say haha 
Btw, the beer of the month- Four Peaks Golden Lager paired well with our food choices. 
Our server, which I hope her name was Daniella, was great and constantly checked up on us. 
Stop by if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"WELCOME TO ARROWHEAD!!! What a great Sports Grill!! More Big Screen TV's than I have seen anywhere! The food is EXCELLENT! Specialty Burgers! I eat out every night. In their first 13 days open, I have eaten there 12 times!! I love the FOOD!! I love the SERVICE!! I love the LOCATION!! Even with a HUGE BAR, they have tons of tables and booths inside and out on a large patio for Family and Group dinners and get togethers! Of course they have been SLAMMED with business as this area has been starving for a great place like this for a long time!! BE PATIENT! Of course there are a few problems staying up with the HUGE DEMAND but Management is addressing each and every one! It's a GREAT PLACE with GREAT FOOD and GREAT PEOPLE!!!
Relax and ENJOY!"}
