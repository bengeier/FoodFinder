{"text":"I want to like this place, I really do, but it always disappoints me. It's just not a reasonable facsimile of a Philly Cheesesteak. I ordered a \"whiz wit\" (cheese whiz and onions in the Philly parlance) not thinking I wasn't at Geno's or Pat's in South Philly and was met with a blank stare by the cashier who had to go ask what that was. I'm not going to fault him for asking that, but even after a co-worker's explanation and me repeating I wanted onions, I did not get onions on my sandwich. I ordered takeout and realized this back at work, so I wasn't able to get this corrected, and the rest of the sandwich didn't do anything to make up for the lack of onions. I will say that the bread, alleged to be the venerable Amoroso's from Philly, is fantastic. But, the rest of the sandwich falls way short.

I've noticed on every visit that the cheese sauce is very, very, very watery and flavorless. On this visit, however, it occurred to me that the meat was the most disappointing part. It was spongy and quite frankly tasted extremely processed. I've had Steak-Umms that tasted more authentic. 

Maybe I'm in the minority, but I just expect better steaks from a place called Southside Steaks. If you're in the area, Campus Deli in Oakland serves up a much more authentic \"whiz wit.\" The bread itself earns this joint an extra star."}

{"text":"If I were drunk right now I would probably be in heaven, alas I am stone cold sober. I ordered the lunch special. The fresh cut fries are delicious, but I wish I hadn't asked for cheese on them. The cheese, which I also asked for on my sandwich, is possibly the worst \"cheese wiz\" I have ever had. It is so bland it's almost pointless for it to be there. Ketchup would have been better, but there is only vinegar and some unlabeled BBQ sauce on the \"condiment bar.\" The floor is so sticky that my feet are shoes stick to the floor. When my food was handed to me the basket had a sticky gooey red substance on the bottom which subsequently got stuck to my hand. Gross. Again, if I were drunk this place would probably get a five star rating."}
{"text":"I love hot sauce, I love cheesesteaks, ergo the Satan Steak. Every single time. Nothing else matters."}
{"text":"A great place for a cheesesteak and fries! I've gone here numerous times and the only disappointment was the messy condiment containers, but it was the end of the day.  Love the Nathan's hot dogs and Mexican coca-cola :).  Awesome fresh cut fries too!"}
{"text":"One word, solid.  The place isn't much to look at but the food was surprisingly good.  Everything was fresh and the Cajun fries were hot and tasty.  Large portion as well.  I also got the Italian cheeses teak which was tasty and substantial in size.  When I'm in the southside I usually go to fatheads but that place gets crazy busy and is not worth waiting an hour.  Southside steaks is a decent alternative for food if you are not looking to drink alchohol."}
{"text":"Food is good, when it's made correctly that is. I live a block away from this place so I had been going at least once a week and loving it, but lately they always seem to screw up my order in one way, shape, or form. Forgetting toppings, wrong substitutions, wrong cheese...the employees are often more interested in their own conversations and jokes and comments about people walking down the street than they are getting the order correct. I've even had the manager/owner lady hand me someone else's sandwich because she wasn't paying attention to what she was doing. The problem clearly starts at the top, which makes it unlikely things will change. 

I've also had an experience with an extremely rude cashier there who was unfamiliar with the cash register and the menu, had no idea how to ring in the original cheesesteak (I'm assuming their most popular sandwich), and then had the nerve to get smart with the guy in front of me in line for not leaving a tip. Um, a tip is a reward for good service...being rude and inept at your job does not warrant a tip, I'm sorry! 

So to sum up, good food, but bad service and unprofessional staff. Good drunk food, but I've stopped going there for regular lunch/dinner because I'm often on a tight schedule and am sick of having to ask for things remade or having to eat something I didn't order."}
{"text":"Great cheese steaks here, Satan Steak is a slam dunk every time- just make sure you buy a bottle of water to put out the fire!"}
{"text":"I'm from Chicago, and I know that Philly is usually synonymous with cheesesteaks, but when we saw this place on a recent visit to Pittsburgh we HAD to try it. For someone who comes from a city that tries to make \"authentic\" cheesesteaks I was excited to finally get the real deal.

We came in a little before lunchtime on a Firday. I ordered the standard cheesesteak WITH the house cheese whiz. After all, that's how I've heard they're traditionally made. The food came out quick and they even brought it to our table! We didn't have to pick it up from a window or anything.

The sandwich was incredible. The meat was well seasoned, and there was a perfect amount of cheese. Just enough so that it didn't make the bread soggy. The fries weren't exceptional, but they complimented the sandwich pretty well.

I would definitely stop in again next time I'm in town. It's a great spot to grab some regional grub!"}
{"text":"Went there last week for a cheese steak last week. Haven't been in a few years.  Man it has gone downhill!  The floor and floor mats were sticky.  The tables were sticky.  The men's room had no paper towels and the women's room did not have toilet paper.  

The womens room did have a roll of paper towels on the handicapped rail...  and a sign saying not to flush paper towels down the toilet.  Ugh."}
{"text":"I really only write reviews on here when I am really pleased about a place, or the rare occasion something is so bad I feel I have to share. Unfortunately, this is one of those instances that was not positive. The only other negative review I've ever written was when there was a maggot in my Chinese. 

Southside Steaks was the worst service experience I've ever had in a restaurant. The staff was so rude as soon as we walked in the door. I ran in there from the pouring rain with a small group of friends while on my bday bar crawl. We were immediately warned by the cashier to shut up for being too loud while we waited in the order line. Nobody was screaming or anything so we were a little surprised. Then as we sat there dumbfounded for how he spoke to us we laughed about something and were again warned to \"shut up or get the f*ck out\" by the female worker. Literally I promise you nobody was being obnoxious or above average loud. We were as loud as any other small group would be having a good night in the southside. As more of our group started to arrive that's just what we did was get out, and we went across the street to smokin joes with our group to eat instead. Nobody swore at us there and the food was better. You lost 40 potential customers spending 10-15 bucks a piece, and none of us will come back again."}
{"text":"I would not recommend this place. The steak was dry and gross. Lacking  cheese on the fries. I couldn't believe our total was $50 for 3 cheesesteaks and 2 fries. Never again"}
{"text":"Service was quick and food was blistering hot, two things I always look for. Fast casual atmosphere. The food was delicious, onions and peppers cooked properly, melted cheesy goodness, and steak on point. I was very pleased with the quality especially after my husband explained he had cheese whiz on his Philly the last time he was in town. We're from NC, so our Philly expertise may not be outstanding but we were very happy. If I'm ever back in Pittsburgh, I'll be back, no doubt. 

Note, considering all of the bars along this stretch you would expect beer but they do not serve it."}
{"text":"Yesterday was my first time coming to this place and i looked up who had the best cheesesteaks and this place came up we were starving after the game so we went without reading reviews first. almost 20 min wait to order food because cashier had to help cook prep food and take food to guests at tables, but she was very pleasant and remained professional under pressure. The cook who said he was the manager on the other hand (blonde hair ponytail ) was very unprofessional  and rude, every word out his mouth was a curse word and he snapped at patrons when they were talking to him or  cashier about their orders. I just never seen anything like that before, also was a half an hour till we received our food, my sub bun was coved in ketchup on the outside and no ketchup inside or any other toppings i asked for either,fries were burnt i was disappointed at the presentation. it did taste good when i added my own ketchup and mayo but wish what i ordered was on the sub. We had a very long drive home and because i saw the  cook/manager curse and run off other customers i did not want to waste my time having my order re made because i had a long way to go and had already been there over an hour waiting for everything. I understand everyone has bad days but that guy was very very rude and its sad but my next trip to pittsburgh i will not waste my time returning to this establishment it was very unpleasant experience and i watched a lot of people leave because of how they were treated, luckily my boyfriend and i did not have interactions with the cook/manager but if my food was not already ordered and paid for i would have left too. All i can do is smh i could not believe what i saw today such unprofessionalism, and from a manager!!!!

***i had to change to a one because after seeing responses from the owner that were so off-putting and disrespectful i will make sure everyone knows that this place is just not worth stopping at especially because even the owner does not apologize for the unprofessional staff he as well seems unprofessional and uncouth, being a business owner myself i would never ever condone ignorance of my staff let alone assume from video footage as he stated with no sound what exactly was going on in his establishment! I would have apologized to customers regardless of my personal thoughts of the situation and had a meeting with my staff in no way shape or form should ignorance be excused in business!**"}
{"text":"Disappointing rendition of this classic sandwich. I opted for a straight up Steak with wiz, fried onions & hot peppers (not toasted, please) and the chips. The meat was rubbery and flavorless. No complaints about the bread or the chips. If you're looking for a cheese steak in Pittsburgh, you can do better."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what's wrong with the people who work here, but they seem to think it's funny to give you the opposite of what you order. I USED to be a somewhat regular customer, but not after my experience today. I typically get a \"mushroom steak\" and am always asked if I want onions. Today, like all the previous ones, I specified \"no onions.\" Seems like a simple request?

The girl smiling behind the grill chimes out, \"So you want an onion sandwich with a side of mushrooms, huh?\" To which I play along and laugh.

I pay and notice my receipt clearly says \"no onions.\" I get my order to go, take it home, and bit into a sandwich COVERED with onions!!!

I'm usually forgiving and give folks another chance if a mistake is made or I have one bad experience. However, there's absolutely nothing funny or cute about a \"restaurant\" deliberately messing with somebody's food order. I assume the cook mistook me for somebody else she has an issue with, but I'm certain I've done nothing to warrant such passive-aggressive behavior.

Since you clearly can't trust the people who prepare the food, I will never eat here again and would encourage others to stay away too."}
{"text":"Greasy cheesesteaks and fresh cut fries. It's delicious and a no frills atmosphere. If you're looking for a decadent cheesesteak, this is your joint. It was great for lunch, but I can't wait to stumble back late night."}
{"text":"I am from Philadelphia originally so I can make this statement-this is as close to a Philly cheesesteak as you will get in Pittsburgh!  Perfect for a snack after late night drinking but also tasty for dinner.  They recently had a Groupon which you could only use before 10pm so we went for dinner.  I normally get a chicken cheesesteak with provolone (also recommend the cheese wiz) with grilled onions and sometimes peppers. My boyfriend gets the same think but with steak. This is the true Philly way and please do not order with tomatoes, lettuce or mayo!!  The rolls are perfect and fresh!  A small or medium fry is enough for sharing and lots of topping options from cheese and bacon to old bay.  My past visit I tried something new and got the buffalo chicken sandwich with blue cheese dressing. It was very tasty! They got new seats and the place is looking good."}
{"text":"Honestly, I would not feed this food to my dog. I also think the place is dirty. The cook did apoligize. Said something like it was pre cut. In any case, I truely do not think that it is real chicken."}
{"text":"Best cheesesteak in PA? That's why we went there. The sub could be best defined as sub par. Unfortunately a $17 \"best cheesesteak in PA\" would not be from this restaurant. Sorry, not sorry, your voting system is rigged. Okay, I'm being critical, but honestly, it wasn't very good. Very average sub. 

Steak was dry, peppers and onions were chopped up way too small and therefore couldn't taste them. French fries were undercooked and tasted like old grease."}
{"text":"It was okay. Not good enough to come back. If they ask you if you want lettuce and tomato make sure you really want it because it's extra. The fries were good. The staff was friendly but the place looks very dirty. I wanted to try it and I did. Bottles of soda pop and plastic baskets. For $10 it was okay."}
{"text":"So good you have to pull the hair back and go to town!! The place is supper nostalgic and the staff is awesome."}
{"text":"Never have I seen a place go from a favorite of mine in the city to some place I'll never go again so fast. 

I started going to Southside Steaks shortly after it opened. I thought the steak sandwiches were amazing and rivaled the best Philly had to offer. I'd sing their praises to anyone who was remotely interested in eating cheesesteaks. Not only was the food great, but the design of the restaurant was funky and fit perfectly in the busy Carson Street neighborhood of the South Side. They did cheesesteaks and great fries and not a whole lot else.

Over the years, things pretty much remained the same. Every now and then a special new sandwich would be introduced to the menu. Maybe it would stick around, maybe it was just their briefly. All was good and well. Unfortunately, I had to move away from beloved Pittsburgh for a few years (to Philly of all places, which gave me an even better barometer of what to expect from a cheesesteak after exploring numerous outlets in that city), but upon my return I was pleased to see Southside Steaks was still up and running and just as good as I had remembered, albeit with a couple menu changes like chicken wings being prominently pushed.

SInce my return, I haven't been as much as a regular as I once was, so I wasn't aware of the whole rebranding to \"The Groove\" until I saw a recent post on Facebook mentioning it. So I decided to stop in last week and see what was what. I shouldn't have bothered. The menu is a godawful mess now, with everything being sold in combos, which you can either choose by a preselected list of sandwiches or a build your own deal. Sorry, but even in my dark days in Philly I was never once asked if I wanted my sandwich toasted. You don't toast cheesesteaks. But that was the first option displayed when picking out a combo.

Then there was the place on the list asking what sort of seasoning you want on your sandwich. What do you mean, what kind of seasoning do I want on my cheesesteak? None! Who does this? No one else, to my knowledge. Not even the crappiest cheesesteak joints (and there are plenty in Philly) ask you what kind of seasoning you want on your sandwich. It was just weird.

So the combos are listed at $9.75 and come with chips (this for the build your own deal). For an extra dollar, you can get fries included. Gimme a break. There was absolutely nothing wrong with the old method here. An affordable and tasty cheesesteak and a huge order of fries if you wanted em separately, with either cheese whiz or gravy for a little extra. But I added the fries because they used to be great. Now, it seems like they're trying to mimic Wingstop's fries with the seasoning. At Wingstop, that's fine. This is how their fries have always been and it's part of *their* menu. Southside Steak's fries used to be awesome, but in this case they had so much fry seasoning dumped on them it was ridiculous. Not even Wingstop dumps that much on. Blech. What a disappointment.

I just got a basic Philly cheesesteak as usual with whiz and grilled onions. Nothing fancy. The meat, which was once really juicy and tasty before was now dry and dull. The roll it was on was chewy and tasteless. What the hell happened? You don't take once worked so completely well and upend it all in one fell swoop and change everything. It absolutely sucks. We asked if the place had changed owners and were told by the cashier that it hadn't and the new menu reflected the \"better quality of the food.\" OK, so going from pretty damn great in my opinion to absolute Sucktown doesn't seem to bear that statement out in the least.

And the interior. What the hell? Southside Steaks had its own slightly gritty, personal charm. Now it looks like an effing tube sock came in and exploded all over the walls with a stupid stripe pattern. The high tables are gone, being replaced with generic mall food court type tables and chairs. And all the stupid '80s crap. Hey, I lived and liked the '80s, but it makes absolutely no sense. And \"The Groove\" is an absolutely stupid name. What about that suggests cheesesteaks, other than it has \"Cheesesteak Co.\" tagged onto the end of it? Terrible name.

I wouldn't be surprised to see The Groove become a Carson Street casualty in a short amount of time. Nothing was wrong with Southside Steaks. Everything is wrong with The Groove. The prices are crap, the menu is terrible, the food is subpar, and the decor is just dumb. I haven't been this disappointed in an eatery in quite a while. Why did you guys screw this up so incredibly bad? I'm never going back, and I suggest you stay away as well."}
{"text":"Checking in here because I missed checking in last night while I was there.  First off- they're changing their name & theme of the restaurant.  

The server told me it's going to be something closer aligned to their food & location but WTF???  How much more aligned can you get than the current name???  She said they're going to introduce 6 new sandwiches and 4 new apps.  Come on!  They already have everything from gyros to steak to chicken sandwiches...  Sounds to me like someone's changing the name to avoid paying a past due gas/water/electric bill...  

Anyway...  I ordered a steak with onions & banana peppers- I didn't want any green peppers...  And I ordered fries- the server told me that in order for me to use a $10 groupon- I had to order more than $10 worth of food.  Really?  I wasn't expecting change back...  

The sandwich wasn't bad but the fries... Are u serious...? She pulled out some semi-cooked freckles fries, threw them onto the steak griddle, squirted some some of oil juice on them and swirled them around like they were sautéed onions..!  The fries are awful!  It's like chewing a mouth full of grease...!

2 stars for a decent steak sandwich, -3 stars for a pathetic attempt at fries...

You know- on second thought- maybe they should change their name...  Good luck with that.."}
{"text":"Southside steaks = heaven. Every trip up to the Southside were sure to bring 6 or 7 Philly cheese steaks home. The ribeye steak is seasoned and juicy with delicious wiz drizzled all over the meat and bread extravaganza. I'm a huge fan of extremely hot food and the ghost pepper Philly cheesesteak is bar none the best I have ever had. Crisp peppers loads of cheese and even more meat. True authentic Philly steaks with a nice Pittsburgh twist. Reasonable prices, delicious food, and dive atmosphere."}
{"text":"Cheap, quick, and greasy....perfect for preparing for a night out drinking I suppose....it did the job."}
{"text":"Since I grew up in Philadelphia, I have a special place in my heart for a good cheesesteak. Having lived in Pittsburgh for the last 6 years, I have not been able to get anything that was even close to resembling a Philly cheesesteak until I came across The Groove. This place is the best I have had in pittsburgh, hands down. While not mind blowing, it is definitely satisfying. Get the cheesesteak with fried onions and american or wiz .. UNTOASTED."}
{"text":"Not terrible, but if you want a cheese steak in Pittsburgh, go to Peppi's.  Southside Steaks is open late though, which can come in handy when you're drunk and in the South Side.  But even then, there's way better (and cheaper) places for late night eats on East Carson like Sal's Pizza or Mike & Tony's Gyros."}
{"text":"Just moved back to South Side after 2 year away. This place sucks now. What happened? Dry cheesesteaks and the prices are absurd. Stay away."}
{"text":"Disappointed. Most times I'm here it's not a bad experience. Tonight I brought a date in and when I asked the staff member where a portion of the order we placed was, we were met with an attitude, as if we were disturbing him. The food is good, but the attitude is unwarranted at the very least. It will be some time before I think about coming back"}
{"text":"Im not quite sure that all the bad reviews are justified, unless youre from Philly and grew up on cheesesteaks. I thoroughly enjoyed my mushroom and pepper cheesesteak. The bread was very soft which i don't find often in a hoagie. The cajun fries were more heavily seasoned than i prefer, and i think they should come with your choice of sauce. The two guys running the place were very welcoming. All in all, it was a positive experience and i will most likely visit again to try other varieties of subs and fries"}
{"text":"So I live right down the street from this place and have always wanted to try it, upon entering i was pleased with the atmosphere everything was Southside. My boyfriend and i bought a Buffalo Chicken sandwich and fresh cut fries with gravy. When i went to get my retrieve my food the sandwich was tiny and weak looking and the fries looked killer! Polar opposites! Both the food tasted like they looked, but three bites in my boyfriend tells me I should stop we can get food else where. Their kitchen is on the other side of a wall of windows so I'm surprised we didn't notice sooner but the walls and stoves and everything on their side was CAKED in grease. Not the type of grease you see on a busy day, the type of grease that has just been layering. Turned my stomach. After seeing all that i couldn't even eat another fry because think about it, its probably a month supply of gravy they just keep skimming off the top. Then to top it off the cook was sitting there eating a sandwich right where he was preparing mine, stopped to cook another sandwich, then went back to eating. Just in that order, no washing hands in-between anything.  After all was said and done  my boyfriend had a messed up stomach the rest of the night and we didn't get a dinner lol. Oh well I'm glad we spotted it."}
{"text":"Best cheesesteak in pa? What a freaking joke. Probably isn't even the best cheesesteak on Carson. I got a steak here with just steak and whiz. As someone who lived in Philly for a bit, literally every cheesesteak I had out there was exponentially better than this one."}
{"text":"Solid late-night after-clubbing fare - big portions, meat, cheese, nothing too fancy. The staff are friendly. Expect long lines and a long wait after 2am but if you want a big hoagie/sandwich and aren't too picky, it'll do well in a pinch.

(I don't really think this place should be classified as a steakhouse but meh, that's ok)."}
{"text":"The person behind the counter couldn't handle a group of 40. And was very rude to the birthday girl. So we took our people and crossed the street to Smokein Joes. Much better food anyway"}
{"text":"Sub par, should of read the reviews first. I've had better cheesesteaks at Eat n Park...seriously.  The Philly was really average, small portion and plain grocery store roll. Did i mention it was way overpriced at $10?"}
{"text":"One of my go to spots. 
These cheesesteaks, in my opinion, are better than the ones i've had in Philly (Geno's, Pats, and Lee's). 

My cheesesteak of choice - Satan's steak whiz wit - great taste with a really nice kick

not a fan of the fries. 

cajun steak is also good."}
{"text":"Have you ever been to one of those places late at night, probably a Friday or Saturday, after many, many, many...uh, many drinks? You know, you stumble in, try to form a sentence to the person behind the counter so that they can prepare a heaping pile of grease for you. Those nights in particular you don't really care what you eat so long as it's amazingly high in calories, knocks a few days off your total life span, and basically soaks up the toxins you just imbibed at the various locations on Carson Street.

Well, here you have it! Your golden oasis of grease, your spiritual Mecca of fatty calories, your nirvana of late night food...Southside Steaks. What is it about this place then sends a shiver down my spine? It stands as a brightly lit, shining beacon right on the corner of Carson and 20th late into the night. Doesn't matter where you are, Southside Steaks calls to you as soon as the ugly lights come on in your bar of choice. You'd be best to heed the call. Go, enjoy. Be one with the cheesy goodness.

Now all that being said, let's just say you go here for dinner. You're sober, you have many choices in the Southside, yet for some odd reason you pick here. Strange, you seem to vaguely remember this place from that super drunk weekend you had. But somehow it seems different. Oh yes, somehow the big chewy bun, the cheese whiz, the gristly steak doesn't seem quite as appealing when all slapped together and presented to you on a wooden board. Nevertheless, this is about as close as you're going to get to a real Philly steak 300 miles west of Philly. Try to enjoy it sober but do yourself a favor, limit this place to 2:15am and later."}
{"text":"Worst service ever.  20 minutes for a steak sandwich and a rude cashier. Felt like a rip off and the guy told us... \"It is what it is\". I will never return to this place and hope that others feel the same way."}
{"text":"Always a good late night experience.  Had a mushroom steak and cheese fries, Good late night grubbing for sure.  Again, some people may be more particular than me, but for a Cheesesteak place in Pittsburgh, it's pretty good."}
{"text":"As I work in the South Side, this place will end up causing me to have cardiac problems earlier on in life.  Am a big fan of the sandwiches here.  If you really want the Philly experience make sure to get it wit whiz.  Ample amounts of special sandwiches and there are even salads.  The fries are great and the options for toppings are too.  

Sign up for their frequent eater card.  Every 5 sandwiches you get a free one and every 10 you get a free sandwich, fries, and drink.  After 10 it resets and you start over again.  This is what's helping me to the prior mentioned cardiac probs. They recently introduced a combo meal in which you get half a sandwich, fries, and a drink.   

Definitely a worthwhile visit if you're looking for a good cheese steak."}
{"text":"Came here sober...awesome! Came here drunk...even more awesome! I like how its open til 3am, perfect after partying all night on Carson Street."}
{"text":"Food, not so great. It's always cold in there. And the owner is a half wit. In my opinion, it was way better when it was southside cheesesteak."}
{"text":"There is rarely anyone in this joint when I go which is kind of sad considering whenever you go to the O in oakland it packed. Might not have the same prestige as a pats or genos in phillu but the southside wouldn't be a place without some hardy cheese steaks. 

The decor is cool. You'll find doors on the ceiling, fans with their tshirt in different countries, old electronics on display in the back and they have tvs and music to keep you entertained. 

The food itself is okay. The steak is tender. I got the Satan steak sandwich with siracha sauce and hot peppers. The bread is tender and the sauce is good. My mouth was on fire so this isn't for the the people with heartburn problems. I had to refill my drink three times. The fries are warm and crispy. Boardwalk style. The cheesesauce and gravy is delish. 

Overall your typical dive fast food establishment. But I think as the crowd evolves with new places like wood fired pizza circolo, urban tap, local, and the flats it's going to be very hard to attract people from the more upscale dining. If the southside steaks cleaned up or renovated they might be able to drum up some more business. Also if they cooked their steak fresh rather than reheat the meat that sits in a big pot might also help. 

As for the aftermath, well this is a greasy dinner. Do not attempt to go out to the bar after. You're gonna have a bad time. Prepare your colon cause this is a cleanser."}
{"text":"Stopped in the place because my son said he wanted wings and saw they had some on the window. I had the Pittsburgh cheesesteak on the cashiers recommendation and I have to say it was delicious! My son also said his wings were good. But apart from the food the customer service was superb. The young man who attended us and recommended the cheesesteak made sure we were taken care of. That's what really made me like this place. I highly recommend it. I haven't been to philly so don't know how it compares to their cheesesteaks but it was pretty damn good"}
{"text":"I used to come to this place a lot when it was \"south side steaks.\"    It has really gone downhill.   Service is so slow!   I was the only one there and it took forever just to be waited on, let alone have my food made.   And for what I got, it was seriously over priced.   I doubt I'll come back much.   What a shame.  It used to be a really good place to eat."}
{"text":"If you are in the mood for stick to your ribs food, you know the kind that has grease through the bun?  This is it then.  The food is hot, and the price is reasonable.  Generally, I must be REALLY craving something like this, but overall I would recommend it for those moments that we aren't worrying about our arteries"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a late night visit around 1:50AM on a Saturday (or Sunday as the case may be).  I was vising Pittsburgh and wanted some \"drunk food\" when I saw Southside Steaks, so I jumped at the chance.  Its greasy with dim lighting and sticky floors, just the way I want my cheese steak to be.  Read the menu board while waiting in line and decided on a steak with extra American cheese and friend onions and an order of bacon cheddar fries.  Placed my order without issue and went to the pickup window to receive it.  Handed my to-go order and walked out in a matter of a half hour.  Steak was perfect and toppings were plentiful.  The cheese was mixed throughout the steak and was very gooey, exactly like it should be.

Would I go during the day? Maybe, but not to eat in.  Would I stop by again for some late night action?  Absolutely."}
{"text":"Two words: processed chicken. Bleck.
Sorry but is it me, or when you go to a cheesesteak place, aren't you expecting fresh chicken to get cooked right on the grill? Nope, processed prefab. The sandwich otherwise was fresh and delicious, and I'd order other things again, just hope they either take that chicken off the menu, warn somebody, or provide the real thing.... Also preferred the previous table setup, had a more friendly  ambience"}
{"text":"I remember loving Southside Steaks back in 2005 or so, and now that I work a block away, I was looking forward to trying it again. Some of the reviews elsewhere scared me, but I decided to rely on my memory instead and pay another visit. I'm glad I did, because it's pretty much exactly the same as I remembered.

I called ahead at lunchtime because I didn't have long and needed to grab and go. The gentleman who answered the phone was polite, made conversation with me, and said my order would be ready in ten minutes. And indeed it was -- it's a big downer when places give inaccurate times. (Downtown, Fadz has great sandwiches but always add at least 10 minutes to the time they quote you.) I waited behind the folks placing orders there -- I didn't look to see if there was a separate pickup area, but I don't think there is -- but that only took a couple minutes.

I got a mushroom steak with Cheez Whiz (duh) and an order of gravy fries. I like gravy on my fries, OK?  The bread they use is perfect for cheesesteaks; it's a little chewy but not hard. The meat itself is good quality, not all gristly and gross. The veggies are a bit meh. I suspect the mushrooms of being canned, and I wish the grilled onions had been a little more plentiful and tender. I'll just ask for more next time. 

The fries are good, of the hand cut variety and cooked just a bit brown. There's enough salt to make them tasty. For my personal taste, I wish they were a little soggier, but that's just me. If you like your fries on the crispy side, they're perfect. The gravy came on the side (much easier for taking back to your desk and eating) and is, you know, brown gravy that you put on fries.

I'd classify my lunch as good, but not great, overall. However, the fact that I REALLY wanted a cheesesteak bumped my enjoyment level up considerably. Southside Steaks makes good sandwiches.

Since this was my first visit in a long time, I can't speak to their other menu options, but I can say I'll definitely be going back. Prices feel reasonable to me; $10 puts it out of my everyday lunch options but keeps it within range for things I deem special occasions (e.g. Thursdays). They do have a $10 minimum for credit cards."}
{"text":"\"We don't make halves but you can eat my whole!\" -- This appears to be Southside Steaks motto.  They are open late and they have fairly nice people working behind the counter.  For our inception into this local sandwich shop, we ordered the following items:

Original Steak with provolone and onion
Fries with gravy
Pepsi

We were easily able to split this meal between two people; it was that large.  The sandwich was okay.  It was a little salty and the onions and cheese tasted average.  Just nothing memorable.  The fries and gravy could have been a bit better.  The gravy was chunky and had an off flavor that I personally couldn't handle.  I was satisfied with my half-cheese steak and Pepsi.  Time to move on."}
{"text":"Being a Yelper I've started to covet the groupons, google offers, etc for restaurants I've never been to before. It makes for a great opportunity to try new places. Since I spend a fair amount of time in the South Side this was perfect.

One night after work the boyfriend and I stopped down there with my phone in hand. It was early on a Tuesday night which meant that the place was pleasantly quiet. The two women working were incredibly friendly and we were able to get two steak subs (mine was plain steak and cheeses the boyfriend getting a mushroom steak)' fries with cheese, and a small drink which exactly used up the google offer. Using it without a print out was super easy too. 

We got our food to go so we walked to the far end of the space to wait. Stickiest. Floors. Ever. It was like the stereotypical movie theater floor. Every single step my shoes stuck. The decor was interesting though, if you look up when you're standing inside there are doors hanging from the ceiling. I loved the dimension it added.

While waiting near the condiment stand I started to notice a bleachy smell. I have an incredibly sensitive sense of smell so it's not surprising that I noticed. I turned around to find a dump sink from a laundry room or mud room filled with incredibly strong bleach water. Good lord. Why? Why this there and filled during business hours. I couldn't eat in there with that smell to save my life. At least they want it to be clean, right?

Now the food: plain steak and cheese sub. I found myself surprisingly underwhelmed. It wasn't bad at all, just not outstanding. For the price I wouldn't order it again as I feel it's a little on the pricey side eateries on Carson St. The boyfriend, on the other hand, was a doubter when we walked in, loved his mushroom steak sub. The fries were good but a little soggy from the wait to get home. I'm sure they would have been a lot better if we had eaten them immediately

The short and long of it: I don't know if I'd go back, not because of the food or the service but because the only time I'm willing to pay that price for steak subs or to eat a steak sub at all is when all the drunks want to and I'm not into crowds of drunks."}
{"text":"Called an order in at noon. At 1:15 my food still wasn't done. I had to get my money back and leave with no sandwiches. I'll never know what a cheesesteak from here tastes like cause I'll never order here again"}
{"text":"It's a pretty good cheese steak, but they are hit or miss.  I have been here at least 10 times in the past five years, and it is a little bit different every time.  Sometimes really good, other times not so great.  But the bun is always spot on for authentic Philly Cheese Steak style."}
{"text":"Good cheesesteak. Good value for your money. Fries are huge and very good. If this is what you are in the mood for you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"This is the place to good for huge gooey sandwiches. It is what it is. As another reviewer said, you may like it more when you're drunk... At lunchtime, bring an appetite or split one for two people."}
{"text":"The cheesesteak was okay but it is certainly not the best cheesesteak in Pennsylvania. I've had a lot of hoagies from the Philly area and this doesn't match up. I've also had better cheesesteaks from other places within the state. It wasn't bad - just not #1 or close to it."}
{"text":"Sorry I'm so late to post my review to my fellow Yelpers!, but, I went to my most Fave cheesesteak spot on St Patty's Day, and had theeeee most exciting time of my life being in Pittsburgh. I had my Dream CheeseSteak that I would usually buy on my lunchbreak, at like MIdnight, and it was just as great, on an extremely busy day, in which I would think is their busiest day of the year. (Not to say the least)...But  as a True Philly girl, this place makes me feel like im right at home, with a twist of greatness that would make me question whether Philly created this Sandwich called a cheeseSteak! Cudos to the owner Marc who makes Everyone welcome, near and far, and has a t-shirt giving a huge shot out to us Philly Natives stating that \"NOT EVERYTHING FROM PHILIDELPHIA SUCKS!\""}
{"text":"I'll keep this brief: I'm a displaced Philadelphian, and after almost two years of searching, this is the only cheesesteak I will eat in Allegheny County.

It's not the best cheesesteak I've ever had--not by a long shot.  But by an even wider margin than that, it's the best cheesesteak I've had in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Being from Philadelphia, I have had a lot of good cheesesteaks. The Philly cheesesteaks here were pretty good.  Definitely not the best I have ever had but not the worst either! The people were very nice and if you like fresh cut fries, the fries her were great!"}
{"text":"Great cheesesteaks and sticky floors. That about sums it up.  Simple, to the point food.  Yummy"}
{"text":"In the mood for a good Cheesesteak?  This is your place. It's one of the few longstanding restaurants in the Southside. It's been there over 15 maybe even 20 years if not longer. They now have wings in addition to cheesesteaks. They have outdoor seating which is nice. Southside is a great place to people watch. 
We ordered two cheesesteaks and an order of fries. Then we went to sit outside. 
Our food came and it looked really good. I ordered mine with lettuce and mayo. The bread was fresh, the cheese melty, and the steak was flavorful. You can also get grilled onions and mushrooms. If you want a true cheesesteak they will add Cheez Whiz. The French fries were made fresh. YUM!
The great food is what keeps people coming back."}
{"text":"What?? I've been coming here forever, it's usually around $8 for a cheesesteak. Today, and apparently they \"changed\" just a few days ago, lucky me and all of us, now it's $14 for the same cheesesteak I've always gotten for $8ish.. Wow! This is pretty ridiculous and it's not even like 5-star grass fed beef or anything, why would they raise the prices so much?? For just a basic base cheesesteak it's $10 plus tax now. Whyy?"}
{"text":"As a vegetarian, I will say that this is the best vegetable sandwich I've had from a sandwich shop. Usually sandwich places will make a veggie sandwich with as many veggies as they would put on top of meat, so it's a disappointment. NOT HERE! This was fulfilling & delicious. They add the perfect amount of jalepeno that creates enough heat without over doing it. The lettuce & tomato were fresh and crispy & the mushrooms don't come out of a can, which is basically all I require to satisfy my needs when it comes to a take out sandwich. I will definitely order from here in the future."}
{"text":"Used to be my go to spot for cheesesteaks...I will shamelessly admit i would go up to 3 times a week, but I will never go again. The phones never work and on Superbowl Sunday with the PHILADELPHIA eagles playing, the phones did not work prior to game time. I tried calling for over 20 mins. The owner is also a very petty and rude person who could use a lesson in customer service. He replied to a private message and showed me receipts showing a customer every two minutes or so, sometimes with 5 minute gaps between orders. I wouldn't call that so busy that you ignore the phones. And maybe he could use the real time statistics he showed me to realize peak times and hire accordingly. Terrible business."}
{"text":"Just walked in, open sign on and everything, looking to order food to go. Said hi as we walked in and they were about to close in 5 minutes. Asks if we could still order and said, well we close in five minutes and were about to clean the grill. Not too much motivation to serve customers it seems. Such a bummer cause we were looking for some grub! Terrible service edicate."}
{"text":"I don't have much to add on top of what others have said; it's a decent place if you're looking for this kind of quick, messy food. I like how you can get sandwiches with chicken instead of beef."}
{"text":"Great Philly Cheese Steaks. Mushroom pepper steak will run you $7.13. They also have chicken, gyros, and salads. i will be back here."}
{"text":"I always ate here sober, despite the recommendations I received. Though I've never eaten a cheesesteak in Philly, I assume this comes pretty damn close. Delicious!"}
{"text":"80s tweens and teens will appreciate the decor!
If you're looking for a cheesesteak customized to your liking, this is the place.

Ty mgr Steve for making me a new cheesesteak (at no cost) because the jerk seasoning (which I ordered) was too spicy for my liking.

I highly recommend this south side spot!"}
{"text":"The sandwiches were good...not great and could be greatly approved. I have a hard time paying $14 for a cheesesteak that is subpar and the Italian was overall good as well. Not any where on a scale of \"best in the city\".  I'm sure any given bar on Carson will have a better cheesesteak than here. I wouldn't recommend this place but if you are hungry and don't want a wait....this place is suitable."}
{"text":"First time trying them out. I ordered pick-up about 20 minutes before closing. They let me order as long as I would make it there in 10 minutes, which I did. I ordered 2 cheese steaks, 1 with old bay fries & the other with bacon cheddar fries. The cheese steak was alright, but not like a real Philly cheese steak. They almost forgot to give me my bacon & cheddar for my fries, but they realized their mistake & ran it out to my car. Eating the bacon cheddar fries was not satisfying, there was not much flavor, the bacon had a lot of grease on it, & the cheese was just regular melted cheese. I wasn't too impressed, but I would give them another try."}
{"text":"First time here since moving from Central PA to PGH. I was looking forward to a reasonable representation of a good cheesesteak from Philadelphia (my favorite is Jim's). Unfortunately, this isn't quite it.

I ordered a provolone wit', and the cashier (who may have been new, though) only kind of half got what I said and had to confirm that I wanted an \"original\", with provolone cheese, and that I did want the fried onions.

It was when he asked if I wanted lettuce and tomato that I knew I was probably in for something less than perfect.

The sandwich I got was passable but was far from something \"straight outta Philly.\" The meat that was being cooked on the grill looked more like a big flat slice of processed meat, not good ribeye. It was also very light on the meat (compared to Jim's) and a bit dry as well. The flavor was also a bit bland.

That said, it wasn't a *bad* sandwich, just not up to par with ones in the cheesesteak's native land. I guess that's to be expected--though I've actually had quite excellent representations of cheesesteaks in such far flung places as Paso Robles, CA, and I was hoping that one a bit closer to home would be even better.

I'll give them another try, but color me a bit disappointed--I had my hopes up that they'd satisfy my Flufya food craving, and it didn't meet that bar."}
{"text":"I have gone to this place twice, and both times, I was less than satisfied. The first time, I ordered a philly cheese steak, and it was very sloppy and soggy - literally, the kaiser roll was soggy and soft (eww!) - if you could move past the soggy roll, the sandwich itself was just average. I decided to go again, against my better judgement, and this time I ordered a hot sausage with jalapeno pepper fries. Once again, the kaiser roll was soggy, the marina sauce was mediocre - as was the sausage - it was just not good. The fries, oh my god, it was literally a brown bag filled w/ regular (salty) fries with 2 containers. Inside one container was regular cheese, and in another container, was miniature green peppers. I. Kid. You. Not. This will be the LAST time I ever visit this place. I don't know how this place has gotten such high marks because the food over priced and is not good at all. Overall, my hot sausage sandwich and \"jalapeno pepper fries\" were $14 all together. A complete waste of money."}
{"text":"Well, this place has sure gone downhill.  The last time I was there will be my last.  
We showed up at 1:45am, the usual time for such a place.  The line was less than 10 people deep, and it took 15 minutes to order.  We wanted to order chicken but they were out.  They have steak and chicken subs; how are you out of 50% of your MAIN ingredient?

After we placed our order, it took another 30 minutes for our food to finish up (two subs.)  A total of 45 minutes for two subs.  The subs were tasty as always, but they're not remotely worth the wait.  If you see any line at all, don't waste your time; the speed & lack of ingredients is shameful."}
{"text":"The service was actually pretty good, and the atmosphere was pretty sweet as well. The food, however, was sub-par. I got a cheese-steak with the works and it was pretty blah. The steak was dried out and there really was not much flavor to it. I asked for hot sauce, and that was actually pretty good. The buffalo fries were also just okay. I expected more from a place that is supposed to specialize in cheese-steaks."}
