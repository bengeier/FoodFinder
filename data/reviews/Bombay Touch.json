{"text":"Nice cozy little place. Found out that they have only been open for a few months n that had several great reviews so I had to give it a shot. We have a cpl chicken n vegetable samosas very big n extremely tasty especially the chicken. Went on to the butter chicken which was very good but not the biggest portion n chicken biryani which was also very good n was a huge portion. Have not been to many Indian restaurants so not sure if butter chicken should be like that but regardless it was really good n so was everything else I tried n would go back"}
{"text":"Great indian food! Friendly professional service. 2nd time here with friends. The more we try the food, the better it gets!"}
{"text":"This was our first visit and we enjoyed it. Staff was knowledgeable and service was great. Very clean and food was delicious. Prices were very reasonable. We will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Thanks to other good reviews, I came to this little gem in Thornhill. I love Indian food in general. Almost any type of Indian food I have tried so far attracted me. I tried South Indian crepe for the first time at Bombay Touch and it was surprisingly tasty!  I often travel to Brampton for good Indian food, but I do not have to go far anymore when I crave for good Indian dishes."}
{"text":"First time there, we over ordered..with Cheetah beer.   Food came mild, try with hot sauce Great in combo w bread.."}
{"text":"The best Indian food I've tried in Norh York so far. Ordered Palak Paneer, butter chicken and tandoori shrimp with butter naan. Thier naan is the best I've had so far. Also enjoyed freshly made curries. The staff were very friendly and I would definitely come back to try more!"}
{"text":"This was such a surprisingly great find! Tucked away in the Promenade, and full of charm and the most delicious vegetarian samosa I've ever had. Our other chicken and vegetarian dishes were served hot with fresh and tasty sauces. Top it off with a generous portion of warm naan, what more could you want? It's places and service like Bombay Touch that remind me to go out and try new foods :D"}
{"text":"We had a wonderful experience. The restaurant is small and comfortable. The atmosphere is calming and welcoming. Service was pleasant.  We had the appetizer platter, which included 2 pieces each of five different appetizers. They were delicious and filling.  Our main courses were Rogan Josh (lamb) and Fish Tikka. Both were delicious and plentiful. All of the items were very reasonably priced.  We will be back for more meals in the future!"}
{"text":"Bombay Touch was a delightful place to eat. I had the vegetable samosa, jumbo tandoori prawn, naan and mango lassi. The flavors all complimented one another. Everyone at my table also enjoyed their meals. The service was great as our server was very helpful. If I lived in Toronto, I'd be back in a heartbeat!"}
{"text":"Indian food was always my favourite, this place made me love it even more, since I don't eat meat cooked with yogurt, I tried the vegetarian dishes and my eyes got wide open after the first bite.  Very authentic, very clean and most importantly, very very tasty."}
{"text":"Service: Slow. Restaurant was basically empty but they placed us in the corner. They didn't check in on us. We had to wait a long time and flag down someone to even bring water. They seem to discriminate against younger clients. There was a table that came after us, middle aged. They were seated near the front. They received water and also their papadum well before us. The clientele looked middle aged or older and they all received attention from the waiter/ress. The middle of the restaurant had empty seats which they could have placed us at. But they didn't and completely ignored us.   Food: BLAND or SALTY. We got the appetizer platter... the only decent item was the alootikki. Chicken pakora was dry. The samosas were salty.  For the mains, the biryani was really bland. Most places I've been to the meat is cut in bite size pieces. Their meat is in huge chunks.  The butter chicken was really salty. How do you screw up butter chicken, really??"}
{"text":"Lunch specials are available for $10.99 from 11 am-3pm.  Had the butter chicken and lamb curry with rice and garlic naan (upgrade from plain naan). Huge portions, even for lunch. The sauces were really thick and flavourful."}
{"text":"We were a group of five that went to dinner yesterday at this hidden gem. From service to food everything was fantastic. We sampled a few different dishes and all of them were fantastic. Butter chicken is a must at this place as well as Tandoori chicken.. Naan bread was also very tasty as well as the rice. Highly recommended and extremely nice owners and staff. Sorry that there are no pictures to show but if I could give them 10 stars I would have. A must try. Can't wait to go back again."}
{"text":"An authentic Indian cuisine experience for sure. Great service and even better food. Definitely coming back and letting our friends know. A hidden gem"}
{"text":"Excellent food, nice presentation! Ordered on meal delivery service so can't comment on restaurant."}
{"text":"Finally a good Indian restaurant in Thornhill.  It came highly recommended by friends. The atmosphere is pleasant and comfortable.  The owners are fantastic and took great pride in providing us a great meal and experience.   They have an extensive menue with many good choices.  I started with a chicken samosa which was delicious.  We then had a chicken vindaloo and a biriyani which were exceptionally good.   This restaurant will certainly be a regular for me and my family."}
{"text":"Everything we have tried is absolutely delicious.  The butter chicken and lamb korma are to die for. Top it with the mango lassi and indulge your taste buds.  We have also tried all the kinds of bread they have - real pleasure."}
{"text":"Great food and great service. It's lovely to see a new Indian restaurant in this neighbourhood very high-quality food in a relaxing atmosphere with excellent service.  The homemade ice cream will knock you off your feet."}
{"text":"I went there on 06 March 2018.  A friend who I haven't seen in over 40 years, decided to meet here.  He is a regular, and we started off with some Samosa starters.  They were delicious.  My long lost school mate, then ordered some chili beef with sauce and vegetables and some tasty and delicious bread with cheese.   His order wasn't quite on the menu, but a combination of items, and it was overall perfect.  The place is quiet, and the service was exceptional.  I will definitely go back. I hope it will be sooner than later, so I can order the same thing that my school mate requested."}
{"text":"Upon walking in we were greeted pleasantly and the staff was attentive.  The aromas weren't necessarily as inviting as they could have been however we wanted to try this place out due to such great reviews.  Started by ordering the tandoori platter and chicken samosas.  Found the samosas to not really be authentic -  they almost had a beef patty type crust and were fairly hard.  While we were waiting for platter- table next to us ordered some type of sizzler that had a really odd smell.  I mean even at the most basic places when you smell sizzle going by it usually makes you crave it.  Not in this case- smelled like burnt ghee.    By this point we were like let's see how the tandoori platter is and go from there.  It was a very generous portion ($28) but it just missed the mark all around.  We have eaten in the best Indian places in many cities and again are shocked by how off ppl are with the reviews.  It just wasn't flavourful.  I mean there is only so much bland meat you can eat.   So we ended up calling it a night after that.  Didn't order any mains as we didn't want to be further disappointed. This is a classic case of trying a place due to great reviews and it not living up.  Would have rather it been given a 3/5 and then we wouldn't have expected much."}
{"text":"Tried Bombay Touch tonight. New Indian restaurant in Thornhill. Drove by several times the interior looked inviting. We decided to try there tali  dishes so we could sample a Variety of food.  We a were very pleased with our dishes flavoring was just right. Chicken curry was perfect, grilled cauliflower had great flavor and texture. Very pleased with  the service we will be back."}
{"text":"Went here with my family for the first time and I have to say... They earned their 5 stars. We were greeted very warmly, given water and appetizers. The owner personally came to greet us and welcome us. When we mentioned we're not so familiar with Indian Cuisine, he recommended some menu items on the mild side in terms of spiciness and was very friendly. Food was served warm and fresh, you could tell the Naan was baked very recently and it was warm and melted in our mouths! There was so much flavour in the foods and they were absolutely delicious! Looking around the restaurant everything was clean and orderly and they seemed to have a decent bar in the corner from where we were sitting. All in all, this restaurant is family friendly, warm and welcoming, and absolutely delicious. Would highly recommend giving this place a try, we were truly impressed!"}
{"text":"Excellent!! I've had the tandoori and butter chicken, both are tender and flavorful. Garlic naan is a must. My go-to Indian spot for sure."}
{"text":"After seeing other positive Yelp review;  I thought I would try the place out.   Pros:  Lots of parking Pleasant setting/decor Nice and clean Friendly waitress  Food: Ordered the vegetable Thali, Samosa and Tandori chicken with naan and popodom.  All the food was just okay. Average all around. I personally prefer my Indian food to be more flavourful. I found everything bland.   With so many options in the area, I don't feel a need to return anytime soon."}
{"text":"This is hands down the best indian food I've had in Canada. I've personally tried The Host and other similar restaurants in the area, and this downright crushes them.   I had the chicken tika masala with naan, and both were amazing (the naan in particular was the best I've had).   Great service and overall amazing place."}
{"text":"Bombay Touch is a recent and welcome addition to the Thornhill dining scene.  While not located in one the GTA's South Asian population centres it can confidently compete in terms of its wide-ranging menu, authentic taste and value. Note that they feature both Punjabi and South Indian menus. But alas the latter is only offered on weekdays. As our server explained that the kitchen only has one tava, fry pan like cookware for making traditional flatbreads such as chapatis and dosas, which would make for a long wait on weekends.  As you enter their dining room what first sets Bombay Touch apart from many other Indian restos is pleasing decor, minimal noise and subdued lighting. All contributing to a relaxing dining experience.  We start with the fish pakora ($9.99) set on a dish with five pieces of perfectly executed greaseless fritters. We thoroughly enjoyed their Papri Chaat ($5.99) consisting of round puffed-up crunchy chips with chickpeas, potatoes, yoghurt & tamarind chutney. As we hemmed and hawed over whether to order Samosas or not, our hostess suggested the Samosa Chaat ($5.99). An \"all dressed\" version with two Vegetarian Samosas, channa, yoghurt and a vibrant green mint sauce substituted for tamarind. The yoghurt softens the samosas but doesn't quite do away with their crisp, which makes for an enhanced taste appeal. One of the younger diners not fond of any sauces opted for the chicken samosa ($1.99) and proceeded to devour it. Ordering another in the latter part of our meal was a sure indication of his approval.  Their rendition of Mango Lassi ($3.99) was a generous serving of a very pleasing, well blended and sweet refresher. I wasn't as enthusiastic about their coriander infused Salty Lassi ($3.99) which was very flavorful but lacked the viscosity I am used to. More yoghurt or less water would make for an easy fix.  Service between courses really lagged.  Our wait was rewarded with the main courses arriving in rapid succession. A sizzling iron dish of Lamb Tikka ($17.99) is always a pleasing sight to behold. Properly cooked chunks of tender lamb resting between pieces of sweet peppers and onions, decorated with fresh coriander. A puree of spinach with cubes of fresh white cheese, their Palak Paneer ($10.99) was delicate, creamy without a hint of bitterness occasionally detected in this dish at other establishments. Their Baingan Bharta ($11.99) is outstanding. Consisting of baked mashed eggplant cooked with green peas, fresh tomatoes, onions & spices. By far the most appealing rendition I've tasted to date.  The Chicken Tikka Masala ($16.99 ) a sauté of chicken tikka with onions, peppers and contained fresh ginger is yet another winning dish. Several very large pieces of Naan and a generous serving of basmati rice are included with the main courses.  Is there room for dessert one fellow diner asks? A rhetorical question to be sure since I consider it a culinary crime to have an Indian meal without one. What a welcome sight it was to see miniature brown milk jugs filled with their mixed nut kulfi ($4.50). Somewhat thicker than most versions I've tasted, it was rich, creamy and absolutely delicious down to the last teaspoon full. Their Kheer ($2.99), India's traditional rice pudding was also nice and rich. We would have appreciated sipping our tea with dessert but it arrived just as we were finishing it.   A terrific, high-quality multi-dish father's day repast enjoyed by our family of five for $150 inclusive of tax and tip.  We look forward to returning to sample a couple of dosas and/or uppatham from their South Indian menu."}
{"text":"Excellent Food and Excellent service. I really enjoy their lunch specials which are very reasonably priced. I would come here every day! I usually get the butter chicken / chili chicken lunch specials, or the chana masala with naan. Pretty much every dish I have tried here tastes great."}
{"text":"Indian food is one of my favourite hearty meals to eat.    Pros:   - Great lighting for sitting in a restaurant. Well appreciated because I personally don't like low lighted restaurants  - Very modern which is great! Makes you feel like the owners really care about the layout and presentation of the store  - Service was great! The server whom I got explained to me which items are very popular and recommend which meat goes well with the selected dish. Very well appreciated and she was right!  - Food tastes so good! - There was tons of parking around. Never waiting around to get into the restaurant    Will be coming back. Love the food, decor and service!"}
{"text":"Very good Indian food and service. We had a mixed Tandoori platter Chicken/Fish/Meat which was very tasty Will be back !!"}
{"text":"While looking for a new restaurant in a familiar area, I found Bombay Touch.  The restaurant has been open for about a year now.  The place was very clean, and the staff very knowledgeable and polite.  The menu had a lot of great options on it, both veg and meat.  They had foods clearly spelled out which were gluten free.  The gluten free options rate about half of the menu.  I had a Lamb Roganjosh, and had a dish of eggplant and a gluten free Naan.  The person with me had the butter chicken and a normal Naan.  The food was exceptional.  The lamb was flavourful and tender and perfectly spiced.  The eggplant was in a nice thick yellow curry and was served with fresh ginger grated across the top.  The gluten free Naan was very interesting: it was gluten free and yeast free, but tore like a normal gluten flat bread.  It was also delicious.  My friend also enjoyed his butter chicken and Naan.  We both agreed that this was to become one of our regulars.  I highly recommend this place.  Must go to if you love great Indian food."}
{"text":"Was the best indian food in uptown  Super clean friendly staff  Amazing bread and nice ambient"}
{"text":"Food was amazing. Very hot & fresh. Naan bread is massive and portions are good size. Chicken tikka masala is not white meat but a mixture. Was very tender but in used to it being all white meat. Service a bit slow but overall worth the wait."}
{"text":"A first time visit while staying with family in Thornhill. Beef Korma and Aloo Gobi delicious, naan and basmati rice delightful and fluffy. Lovely hosts. Will come again when we are back in Thornhill."}
{"text":"I got some takeout chicken seekh kebabs, and i found they were overly spiced but they were definitely a good portion.   I probably wouldnt get that again but would try other things on the menu.   The restaurant itself is nice."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing menu. Very flavorful. Great service. Hidden jem of Thornhill. Reasonable price, large portions."}
{"text":"We had a nice dinner here. The food was pretty good - we got some masala and some tandoori. The tandoori lamb was a bit saucier than I expected it to be. Their drink menu is also a little lacking. But everything else was very good - especially the samosas. Service and ambiance were also quite nice. Overall a good Indian restaurant in the area."}
{"text":"SERVICE: Exceptionally friendly and helpful.  FOOD: I really liked the taste of Mattar Paneer, but my wife thought it was lacking in taste. The naan was bland IMO. I've tried much better naans at other Indian restaurants. It was passable, but not great. I also tried their tandoori chicken tikka. I ordered dark meat as opposed to white meat. It was still dry for some reason. Next time, I'll be getting only veg options. I'd like to try Aloo Gobi and Karahi Paneer.  There are no good Indian restaurants in this part of town, so this is a reasonable option if you're craving Indian. You'd have to venture out to Brampton for some truly good Indian food. My only gripe with them is that their portions are small. I wonder if the takeout containers are just as small. I'd expect more food for the money.  Also, the prices on their website are outdated. They are all $1-$3 lower than what they actually are in the menu once you get there. You can refer to the photos I took of the most recent menu as of July 2017 for more recent pricing."}
{"text":"The area I live in has almost everything, EXCEPT Indian food. I had seen a number of food establishments come and go in this particular location, more so, because they were serving either the same old cuisine or substandard quality/service. When I noticed a few months ago that yet another restaurant was rolling the dice and trying their luck, my curiosity peaked further, when I noticed that it was Indian. I made a mental note to check it out when they were a bit more established. This is actually the second time I've been there, but preferred to write a review at this time, to make sure there was consistency, both with the food and service. As on the first occasion, we arrived a group of 6. As it was fairly empty, we were seated immediately. The restaurant has a nice ambiance, with Indian music playing in the background. The service is very quick, friendly and our waitress, was very helpful, suggesting a variety of dishes, answering all questions we had.  The food was very good. We had ordered an array of dishes, so that we all could taste and share the different dishes from the menu. We all enjoyed the meal. My only concern, due to the location, will be that not enough people will try this hidden gem and it too will disappear"}
{"text":"Visited Toronto and came across this gem. Amazing food and outstanding service. By far the best Indian food I've found in North America."}
{"text":"Very tasty food!! It was a delivery and the bread arrived very warm! I ordered Paneer and butter chicken and I cannot say which one was better. Very strong food, be careful if you have stomach problems, but very tasty anyways."}
{"text":"I think this is the best Indian restaurant in Toronto and Thornhill. I have been to some nice ones in Mississauga but they are a bit far for me.   Outside of the restaurant you can hardly notice this, you would even doubt if they are open it is that unnoticeable. But as soon as you walk in, the décor is so cozy and comfortable. You would certainly want to stay as long as possible.   The food we like the korma (chicken in cashnut sauce). The nann is so fresh, not greasy,  big and not burned. That's probably the best compare to other indian restaurants.  I also love the samosa (both chicken and veggies), they are huge and only cost 1 or 2 dollars. Masala chai is also my favourite. The regular lassi (sweet milky one) is nice, I like it better than the mango lassi.   Tips: don't order too much if you don't have enough ppl to share. As the first time I went I ordered too much and we had to go to the park for a walk after in order to help digesting. There aren't always such an option in winter time when it is minus 30 degrees outside.. but there is always Walmart if you need to walk around after."}
{"text":"Our meal was delicious. Everything was tasty, fresh, and enjoyable. Will definitely be back. So glad to finally have a great Indian restaurant in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Great food and service. The food is not too spice and the naan is freshly baked. The chicken tikka masala and the vegetarian combo were amazing."}
