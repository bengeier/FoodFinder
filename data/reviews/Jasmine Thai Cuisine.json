{"text":"As newbies to Phoenix, we have been looking for a great Thai restaurant for dine in and take out. After eating at Jasmine Thai we are confident that this will be our spot!   The restaurant is clean, service was speedy and the staff very friendly."}
{"text":"GO HERE. They are so kind and the food is so good! Finally a good Thai Spot in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Everything that I have had here has been wonderful. Their Pad see ew is my favorite, their cashew nut is awesome, and the hawaiian fried rice is amazing. The staff is real nice and the food takes no time with phone orders. This is one of 2 restaurants that are in my favorites in my phone."}
{"text":"Placed an order through Postmates for lunch delivery: chicken pad thai, spring rolls and shrimp rolls.  The food  quality and taste was okay but overall lackluster, I felt it lacked the authentic flavors of Thai cuisine. The spring rolls were little more than an average grocery store pre-bagged shredded salad mix (iceberg lettuce and purple cabbage) wrapped in rice paper with peanut sauce that tasted like it came from a jar. Honestly, the thai spring rolls  available at Cheesecake factory of all places are far superior in both taste and quality. The Pad Thai which I specifically requested mild was much spicier than anticipated... I wasn't able to eat it which was disappointing as otherwise it looked rather promising. Not fantastic, but edible and relatively inexpensive.  Unfortunately, there is a district lack of affordable, consistently tasty and authentic Thai cuisine in Phoenix... I had hopes for this place based off the number of positive reviews but I find myself once again hungry and reaching for a snack after my $30 lunch."}
{"text":"I'll cut to the chase, the food here is a solid B+ we've never had an issue with the quality of the food, our big issue is that we've been going here honestly about every 2 weeks for about 2 years, and the portions have gotten consistently smaller while prices have also creeped up. As an example, our to go container has slowly gone from being filled to the top, to barely being 2/3 full. We'd written it off as someone not paying attention but this has happened every time! I enjoy the food but I can't help feel like Im being cheated."}
{"text":"When nothing but Thai food will satisfy - this is the place!  We ordered Pad Thai and Pad Kaprow with Crab Puff appetizers and Thai tea. The food was great, the atmosphere was relaxing and the service was attentive.  Reasonable prices Too. Get there while you can this may soon be a neighborhood favorite and one of those see and be seen restaurant spots near downtown favored by young foodies"}
{"text":"I hate to write negative reviews but this place deserves less than one star. All their food tastes like they just microwaved it, bought from a grocery store. Their fried rice was not fried and too soggy, their barbecue chicken is not barbecue, no flavor and they give you more bones than chicken. Their crab puffs taste old and their \"Thai tea\" tastes like it was made from a carton with water, not fresh or even from the night before. VERY DISAPPOINTED! I forgot that they're even a \"Thai\" restaurant. Gross and waste of $40, wish I could get my money back, I wouldn't even give this food to a homeless person."}
{"text":"My sister-n-law and I ordered from here for a late lunch/early dinner. We called to see if they did delivery and were informed that the delivery guy had left for the day already. It wasn't a huge deal because the place is so close, so I biked to pick it up. They said it would be ready to go in around 15-20 min.   First thing that made me nervous when I got there was I didn't see a bike rack, sign, pole, anything to lock my bike to, so I had to leave it sitting right outside the store for the world to walk off with. Otherwise, the place looked nice and clean, the lady had my order ready and was polite and quick with processing my payment.   After I got home I was excited to see the food. I had ordered Chicken Spicy Noodles  (med. spicy) with an added side of sticky rice and my sis had ordered Pad Thai Chicken.  Both main dishes looked delicious (a little sloshed due to the ride back) but delicious. The only 'ugh' thing was the side of sticky rice, it looked horrible. It was packaged in a little fold over sandwich bag and seemed very stiff. ((I'm not the best cook but the only time my sticky rice looked like that was when I had overcooked or reheated it wrong)). Once I took it out of the bag I feared the rice was a lost cause, I had to pry a chunk off just to try. Needless to say I was hoping that it tasted better but I was wrong there too. I ended up tossing it.  The flavors of the main dishes made the loss of rice bearable. My dish was extremely good and had a very delicious heat, my sis's dish was also very tasty with a nice crunch. I would say this is definitely a good place to stop if you're nearby and craving Thai. The prices were decent and I will most likely eat here again when I've got a craving and not wanting to go out; though I doubt I'll ever get the sticky rice again - better just make my own."}
{"text":"If I could give it no stars I would. Food was bland and oily for no reason. I tried to give it a chance but once I tasted it, the food spoke for itself. I ordered beef pad see-ew. My friend ordered green curry chicken and His response was the same. And we had not even compared notes yet. I can't understand why it's so bad with all these fabulous reviews on here. I can tell u perhaps these people don't know what good thai food tastes like. This isn't it. The portion was also ridiculously small for the money you are paying. Cutting corners will NOT keep u in business. Don't waste your money or your lunch break here."}
{"text":"Ordered from here tonight and the food was ok. I googled them and found they had good reviews. I ordered and when I received my food I noticed they use canned baby corn in their curry and cheap Styrofoam containers. It's time for them to step up their food game. I really want a local Thai restaurant focused on fresh and local ingredients."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good, not my favorite Thai restaurant. I ordered takeout and it took them over 45 minutes to prepare it. A couple came in, ordered after us and left with time to spare before we got our food. There were also no deliveries and not a single person in the restaurant. I was skeptical until the woman came up to us. I expected her to say, Sorry for the wait\" but instead she said that the couple that just left were regulars and that's why they got their food first. I liked the fried rice I ordered but that comment left a bad taste in my mouth. I refuse to have different service because I'm not a regular. Check out the other 5 Thai restaurants in the area before you come here."}
{"text":"This place isn't authentic.  The pad Thai had like 5 pieces of chicken :-(  The noodles were good but all you get is noodles with a few pieces Of chicken."}
{"text":"Ordered takeout- yellow curry is really good with chicken. Fianc√© enjoyed the shrimpwonton soup- will be back again!"}
{"text":"Duck noodle soup is amazing.  Very high quality at a great price.  Service exceptional."}
{"text":"Delicious Thai food! Incredibly fast, friendly service. We enjoyed the lunch specials of pad Thai and pad see ew."}
{"text":"I tried this place it was cute and clean looking inside. The staff was friendly, I ordered take out and my food was packaged neatly. When I got back to my room the food was still nice and hot. I had the sweet n sour chicken and I expected it to have a little spice, esp with it being thai, but it didn't. I actually felt like it was a tad bit too sweet... I also had their sweet Thai tea, which I didn't really like the flavor, but that was just me, maybe...But it was good overall and good prices."}
{"text":"In town for business & I ordered the beef panang w rice & received my order in relatively good time. My panang was loaded w veggies: zucchini, carrots, broccoli, green beans & a good amount of beef. Got a complimentary upgrade to my very tasty strawberry lemonade, which I recommend as well!"}
{"text":"One if the best Thai restaurants in the area. When some one  asks for a  Thai restaurant recommendation, I'll  send them here.  Their curries are great, not too sweet, which is the hallmark of a quality Thai place. They have an  menu that leaves everyone happy. I will definitely be back to try more. Service is fast and very friendly."}
{"text":"I've been here twice - - came back to get the Duck Noodle Soup again.  Andy G. is absolutely right.  It is fabulous!  If you ask, you can get dishes truly spicy (try the green curry with chicken).  Super friendly staff, too."}
{"text":"Very good Pad Thai! Friendly service and a comfy cozy ambiance. I'll definitely come back to try more off of their menu."}
{"text":"We frequent here for take out. The price is much better than neighboring thaiger. Food is really good here and also the wontons are bomb.... I think they are house made? Anyway good food :)"}
{"text":"Very pleased with the pad Thai!! Very convenient location across from St Joseph's hospital. Quaint, clean, great food, good prices, good friendly service....what more can u ask for???!!!"}
{"text":"Tried this place due to the overall high reviews...the chow mein plate was tasty but once I got through half of the plate I found a piece of metal scrub brush in my mouth and almost choked trying to get it out... Although I didn't have to pay for the plate I expected a better reaction to try to save future business but was surprised that I was charged for my soda and the other plate at the table....i'm not the type to try to get stuff for free or find extras when a mistake happens but a little effort into keeping me coming back might have worked....won't be back here- cleanliness is very important part to trusting a restaurant!"}
{"text":"Well... it wasn't baaaad but it mostly wasn't good. The fresh veggie spring rolls were alright but the sauce tasted funky. It wasn't peanut sauce that came with it; more like teriyaki sauce with peanuts added. The fried tofu was just okay. The Pad Thai we literally tossed after 2 bites. In fact, I spit mine out as something went horribly wrong with it. The Pad Se Ew was edible but incredibly bland. The veggies weren't over cooked but could've been a little crisper for my taste but still NOT over done. We'll probably try again after awhile. The service was very pleasant. She was courteous and helpful."}
{"text":"Farewell Jasmine Thai, I will not be returning. We gave this place a 2nd try and they let us down. They were out of BBQ Chicken, so I got the BBQ Pork, should have gotten pad thai... The pork was dry, tough, gray and cold. The Orange Chicken was sweet but it didnt taste like oranges. Each entree came with rice, the rice was mushy. What I will miss is your customer service and coffee. Thanks."}
{"text":"When I'm downtown this is my go to place for lunch. The staff are always  very friendly and helpfull. If you want spicy you can get it. If spicy isn't you think they can tone it down upon request."}
{"text":"This is my most resent visit. Went here for lunch on Tuesday. It  was the sugguestion of my roommate, since we had eaten here about 2weeks prior and the lunch was very good. Thiis time around. Not so good. My firend orderedmixed vegetables with beef and i ordered red curry with vegetables (no tofu). The waiter asked me if i wanted lunch portion or dinner portion and i decieded to go with dinner portion. My firends said his food tasted great, but the portiion was laughable. Now i know lunch portions are generally sized down a bit from the dinner ones but this was much less then that. Their was half of the plate empty. My curry i requested hot, was not aany thing at all hot and their were barley any vegetables to speak of. Mmm i think 2 broccoli, a few cabbage and the remained were corrrots a few green beans and bamboo shoots. The curry sauce was in abundance and it was lacking flavour. And not only that, what few vegges their were were all over cooked. The last 2xs i ate here the portions were better and the flavour was better. Dont understand why they are not consistent. I will be back as all of my previous visits were pretty good. But if it stays like this. Dont think ill return."}
{"text":"I will never go here again. Ordered yellow curry and it wasnt spicy like I asked. I order the spicy noodles and asked for medium and it was SUPER hot I could barely eat it. The portions are super small and you do not get your money's worth. The pot stickers were the only thing that tasted okay. For 40 bucks and the three orders of food I had, I had higher expectations."}
{"text":"Got takeout from them Saturday night ... I stood at the counter waiting to pay for my order (and being ignored) for at least 10 minutes while the phone rang off the hook.  Half the tables had no food, with people waiting.  Finally, the manager/waitress answered the phone, and took that call, with me still waiting.  Finally, I got to pay for and pick up my order ... I got no apology, no \"thank you\" or even any acknowledgement more than a grunt.  Food was just OK, but nothing special ...  These guys need to get their act together ... Will not be back any time soon."}
{"text":"Great place with good food. Very cozy and prompt service.  I was in the mood for Pad Thai so I stopped by on a whim, everything checked out very good and the food was delish!"}
{"text":"Was surprised to walk in and find a redecorated restaurant with a similar name but obviously under different management and with a different menu.  Was not impressed with the service or the food. I miss the old place, the old food not to mention their were more choices on the menu.  Now it appears to cater to the hipsters.  One star."}
{"text":"I normally don't do this but I'm writing this review while at the table. Must say that this place has very authentic food. Also, the service is great."}
{"text":"I went this Thai place after school. The food was probably worst Thai food I have ever had. The pad Thai is very sweet and chicken sticks are no flavor and it was quite expensive too. I will not coming back even its only a mile away from the school."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, and extremely delicious food. It's a hole in the wall spot, definitely worth the drive"}
{"text":"Great Thai cuisine! The spicy noodles with beef were delectable. The Pad Thai with garlic sauce is also a good choice. The staff was friendly and welcoming. We will be back to try other menu items."}
{"text":"Good, inexpensive Thai cuisine, well presented and no corners cut even as they keep their prices down. The service is friendly and the place is cozy and conveniently located. While parking in front of this commercial strip facing St. Joe's hospital is very limited, there is ample parking behind - as is known by those who frequent the popular 5th Avenue Cafe which happens to be their neighbor."}
{"text":"I'm only giving this place a one star only cause it put food in my stomach.. 1st. this restaurant smells like a port-a-potty 2nd the service was EXTREMELY BAD the waitress was very rude and when it came time to pay this Woman the waitress demanded a tip and and not only did she demand a tip but also gave the amount she desired \" GIVE ME A $5.00 TIP \"was what she said in an aggressive manner...... NEVER again"}
{"text":"What a great and clean restaurant at a perfect price.  This is my second time visiting this restaurant and continue to love it. The food is great, really great. The staff is very friendly and polite.  The food comes out super fast. The highest quality of service!  Love it!"}
{"text":"Just discovered this Thai place after driving by it with a friend. Some of the best Thai/Asian food I've had in the Valley. Highly recommend the Pad Thai and the Pineapple Fried Rice is amazing. A small restaurant that deserves the praise it's been getting."}
{"text":"Yum...so excited that a tasty Thai place just opened in Central Phoenix!  Nice atmosphere, attentive and friendly staff, and delicious food.  We tried the shrimp rolls, steamed potstickers, pad see ew and rad na.  Everything was fresh, flavorful and quite tasty!  This will certainly be our go to Thai place in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Food was great but service was poor. I was extremely disappointed with their service. The grouchy grumpy red/blk/burgundy headed mature lady did not come back once to check on us. We literally had to get out of our chair to ask for a refill on our drinks, and not to mention when we got our tab, we paid it at the front counter after we paid our bill the grumpy lady asked \"where's my tip?\" We normally leave the tip on the table but OMG!! Lady demanded we tip her $5 lol this lady has no shame! Beware grumpy old lady alert!"}
{"text":"Came right at open. Place is very clean. Menu is large great pictures. Ordered the Thai iced coffee which was good my companion ordered soda. We order our meals I had pad-see-ew and he had spicy noodles. Food was promptly served and was delicious. I would like to come again to try other items."}
{"text":"Cen Pho is a thai hotspot, I can ramble off at least 5 places with in two miles, so if you are going to jump in to that game, you should be at the top of the game.  Jasmine tahi is not quite up to the challange. My drunken noodles were a bit too soft are not really spicy, the spring roll was crisp but greasy. The odd music and empty tables made this for an akward trip. Also I was dismayed when I went by the kitchen and heard a microwave in use, this may explain the general limpness of my food.  The PadSeEw did not have the wake` char one would exptect."}
{"text":"This has everything I want in a Thai spot. Nice quiet ambience, Midtown location and the of course the food is great. I'm not a Thai expert, but my go to is Green Curry and Pad Thai and they've delivered on those."}
{"text":"Good!! Home style cooking! Whatever we ordered tasted fresh and clean!! Definitely recommend it!!!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I went here 3 times in that last week. The food is sooo good and the servers are nice and patience"}
{"text":"Loved this place! The tom kha gai and chicken panang curry were WONDERFUL! Thai restaurants tend to vary in flavors and ingredients on any given dish and Jasmine hit all the marks for my personal preferences. I only wish they offered their soups in cups and/or bowls as opposed to the giant hot pots. The tom kha gai was outstanding but I couldn't finish that in addition to the panang which was equally DELICIOUS. Nor could I choose between the two as they are my favorites. still even if I couldn't come close to eating it all it was very well priced! Please eat here so it will be around if I pass through Phoenix again."}
{"text":"I told my boyfriend I was craving Thai food and about a mile later we payed this little place. It was exactly what I wanted! :)  I got the classic pad thai-- I ordered a mild spice, wish I got a little spicer. He ordered the orange chicken like usual. I couldn't help myself to not order shrimp tempura, The portion size was so worth the price.  The service was good, The booths and tables were clean. I loved how small the place was. Definitely authentic Thai food.  We will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"From cautious foodies. This place was slow and my wife and I where kinda skeptical cause it was empty. We said let's try it, and it was the best decision ever. Very clean restaurant amazing service with a smile. The food blew us out of the water, by far the best Thai we have ever eaten. The chef cam out and told us about our meal. Bottom line, this should be a stop for anyone who likes Thai. Diamond in the ruff"}
{"text":"Finally!  A Thai restaurant that doesn't disappoint.  Curries and soups that feel more home made than restaurant.  They have kinks to work out - but the food is a much needed addition to downtown PHX."}
{"text":"just picked up a to-go lunch order from here.. paid $13.00 for pineapple fried rice w/tofu verses $9.95 which was stated on their online menu. i was instantly annoyed at that. i got back to work to realize there is no cilantro or egg (as again, stated on their online menu) and there were craisins (which i hate & was NOT on the description on their menu), the rice was soggy and the tofu was dry and hard. the whole meal was flavorless and disgusting. i'll definitely never go back here."}
{"text":"I've never dined in here before, but I order delivery through postmates at least once a week so while I can't speak for the service or atmosphere, I can say that this is my go-to Asian food delivery. I work at an amazing Asian restaurant so my standards are high, and most other Asian food I order really disappoints me. I usually order the grilled pot stickers, and then typically a spicy dish. I like their pad thai and the spicy yellow curry. I also enjoy the satay chicken. My only complaint is that I ordered the spicy fried rice once and it was not spicy or flavorful at all. I had to add my own peppers and soy sauce to make it edible. Other than that everything has always been great!"}
{"text":"Krap√≥w Chicken and Pad Thai Chicken Goodness.  The Pad Thai was a solid 4.5 stars of goodness! I feel like I want to order more for later before I leave right now!  Chicken Krap√≥w was a sold happy 3.9 stars!  The Thai coffee had a delicious wood roasted flavoring combined with a refreshingly smooth iced goodness....  The service was good and all was. Stop by for a good feeding.....  Across from the hospital."}
{"text":"First time customer here and I was trying to call in my order when I made sure they should be open and they never answered their phone. I tried 2 times and It just kept ringing. Definitely going somewhere else."}
{"text":"How do you mess up pad thai?  Very disappointing. I was a regular and usually order curry here. The pad thai tasted horrible; bad tasting sauce, did not taste like pad thai and drenched in sauce. I order pad thai at many, many thai places: pad see eq was ehhhh and had a weird taste. I think I will stop coming since Thai Basil is so close just on the other side of the hospital."}
{"text":"Some of the best curry in town! Delicious food, excellent portion sizes and very clean inside. We had both the panang curry and pineapple curry which made it an excellent decision to get some refreshing Thai ice tea!"}
{"text":"Very good Thai food and service! Brand new and very clean interior. The Thai tea was at the perfect sweetness, the Tom Kom Kai (coconut soup) was unique and very pleasing."}
{"text":"After a very disappointing lunch at Noodle Bar in downtown Phoenix, the family decided to check out Jasmine for dinner.  What a way to end our first day of holiday in Phoenix.  Outstanding.  When we arrived, I wasn't sure the place was open -- there were only a few cars in the large parking lot, but we went in (a little after 5:00 pm) and people started filing in later.  The first thing we noticed was the great array of sushi and sushi rolls -- unagi (eel), tobiko(flying fish roe), and the standard sake and maguro (salmon & tuna), and about eight different types of rolls.  I lived in Japan for 17 years, so it's hard to impress me with sushi, but this was decent -- fresh and not bad at all.  After a plate of sushi, I tried some of the hot dishes, and they ranged from good to very good.  There was a huge variety of dishes, so I never made it to the carving station or seafood area (so I didn't try the prime rib, oysters or crab they had out), but I did get a couple of kalbi ribs and a Chinese-style bbq rib that were both very good.  The biggest surprise:  we were there during happy hour, and I got a sake bomb -- a large bottle of Sapporo Beer and a small serving of sake on the side.  For only $5!    Service was friendly and prompt, the place was clean, and I thought the price ($22 for adults, kids price based on age) was very reasonable for the quality of the food."}
{"text":"I ordered this chow mein via Postmates and chose this place because it had a decent rating on here.. how? It was a soppy mess and I asked for it to be extra spicy and I guess that means extra bland because there was no spice, not even a whisper of spice! Will not try again."}
{"text":"Just stopped in for lunch today. Had the crab puffs, satay and pad thai.   Crab puffs were not good. The wontons were way too thick and chewy and were almost flat. Crab puffs should be light and airy. These were heavy and greasy. Crab stuffing was almost nil and too creamy.  Everything else was good. Service was attentive and the place was very clean and tidy.  A solid 3 star choice when you have a hankering for Thai food"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying, this place isn't bad. However, this is my second and last time that I've left... less than satisfied. I can't vouch for the take-out but the dine-in offers a HUGE portion. I've only been here for lunch, with the lunch menu you're served a bowl of wonton soup and small spring roll. Soda is like another $2  For a $12 LUNCH plate, I can't afford to come back. My favorite Asian place in Tempe charges $6 for the same, if not more food.  The food comes out REALLY quickly though, I was in and out in less than 40-minutes or so.  In regards to food, it's really just bland. I'm not sure if that's how Thai food is supposed to be, as I've mostly eaten Japanese or Chinese food, neither plates I've tried have been \"flavorful\" in my opinion.   The chicken pad thai was really yellow, and had more egg than it did chicken (just not what I'm used to). I might have gagged a little bit from the combination of smell/taste/texture. The sweet and sour chicken was better, but I prefer my vegetable cooked all the way through and these were not. The chicken was VERY thin, and I'm thinking I was chewing on mostly batter.   Overall....so-so. Considering the area, I guess they can get away with their pricey menu."}
{"text":"Tasty food, quick service, and a great location!   I'm partial to this location, since I just live down the street!   This is a quiet little spot near St. Joe's hospital off Thomas.  We were the only ones in the restaurant at the time we visited.   The waitress was attentive but not super friendly.   The food: excellent, hot, and well-spiced (well, except the vegetable rolls).    The spring vegetable rolls were crisp and tasty, along with some delicious peanut sauce.  I had a history of these with friends who made them homemade in the 1990s, and these were a close recipe!   I ordered a vegetable stir-fry. The waitress said I could specify vegetables to be removed from the dish.  They were out of sticky rice (sadness) but I love jasmine rice.   My friend ordered the curry and loved it.   We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Thai rice is delicious because of the heavy use of several onions. I don't think I saw one onion in my dish. Very little flavor at all. Won't be returning."}
{"text":"I decided to try this place out because it is right next to work. The d√©cor was cute, clean and cozy. Our waitress was great in servicing us. I ordered the Thai iced tea which was a tad bit too sweet for me. I had to put more ice in my glass to water it down a little bit.  We ordered the beef pad se ew and the chicken red curry. The red curry was pretty good. I had to ask for more rice in which my server had no problems bringing me some. The pad se ew tasted sweet. I usually like mine hot, tangy and spicy.  Overall, I would definitely come back! The restaurant isn't too busy so you wouldn't be waiting for a table, which is a plus. There is plenty of parking in the back of the building so if you get annoyed with the lack of spaces at the front, just go to the back."}
{"text":"This place was just meh. Nothing stood out. We were the only customers in the entire restaurant and the waitress just seemed really bored and over us being there. Pretty disappointed."}
{"text":"What a great find. The service is fantastic, the restaurant is clean & everything we ordered was delicious. The tom yam is some of the best I've had in many years. The broth is rich & flavorful; there are lots of noodles & the portion was generous."}
{"text":"I love this place! Great flavor, good prices and everyone is super friendly! I like the green curry, yellow curry, pad thai, and sesame chicken!"}
{"text":"This thai place was just okay. Nothing special. I considered leaving only two stars for this restaurant because the food was very overpriced and it was literally the most uneventful dining experience I have ever had. But I decided to be generous because the food was not terrible and the restaurant had a nice, clean interior.  The main things that irked me about this place were the prices and the fact that they don't offer cups of soup, only bowls. I absolutely adore tom-yum soup, and enjoy starting my meal off with a cup, but this place only offers $10 bowls of soup. When I asked the waitress about this, she told me it was no big deal and that I should just order my entree and a bowl of soup... uh, me thinks not. Really, how hard is it to offer a cup of soup?  Anyways, I won't be returning; there are TONS of better places for less money."}
{"text":"This is the best Thai food in Phoenix and Arizona so far. I have been to dozens Thai restaurants in the past and never had good one.  Try the papaya salad with sticky rice, it's really good and remind us of the street food in Thailand.  The red curry on lunch menu is delicious as well, come with small bowl of cabbage soup and a fried egg roll for $8.95, the best deal in town."}
{"text":"I eat here about twice a month. Food is always consistently good. Walked in today and to my surprise the place was renovated! Looks beautiful and clean! Food was amazing as well! New owners I was told. Definitely will keep going for lunch. Chicken fried rice Thai hot is everything!!"}
{"text":"I loved this Thai food restaurant! The food was super fresh and tasted amazing I had the fried wontons and veggie spring rolls for an appetizer and the Thai bbq chicken for my entree was not disappointed at all would definitely come back again"}
{"text":"Favorite Thai in Phoenix!! It's definitely our go-to spot. It's rather hidden but those tend to be the best spots! The service is always on point and friendly, we bring our little 7 month old when we go and the staff is so sweet toward her. The Pad Thai is just amazing...I feel guilty because I can almost eat it all. The Duck Curry is by far the best I've ever had, it's the perfect mix of creamy and spicy. Everything we've tried there has exceeded our expectations, and we came from NYC so we've had just about every style of Thai food! We'll definitely be going back very soon :)"}
{"text":"Everything was pretty bland. The pineapple fried rice was made with white rice, not jasmine.   No tumeric. No tomatoes. No raisins.   White onions, not scallions. Tasted more like Pei Wei than Thai food.  Very dissapointed."}
{"text":"Excellent food.  Extremely clean.  The staff is friendly and efficient.  Really good atmosphere."}
{"text":"I work across the street from this little strip mall so I was SOOOO excited to see this restaurant open because I love Thai food. I picked up food for lunch and tried the pad cee ew and silver noodles. The taste was delicious but portions were smaller than I'm used to for a Thai restaurant. I guess it kind of makes sense because they're guard toward the lunching sort of customer, but even the Thai teas were on the smaller side, albeit every bit as delicious as I'm used to. They have a bif comfy couch to sit on while you wait,  which is awesome. The staff is extremely welcoming and friendly. Will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"What a cute and delicious little place! People here are very friendly. The restaurant is clean and inviting. We started with the shrimp spring rolls and potstickers and the Yellow curry is yummy! You can't beat the price! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Probably my favorite Thai food in the valley. Fresh ingredients, great flavors and very authentic. We got ours to go and it still was perfection. I got the spicy noodles with chicken and egg roles. Perfect amount of heat. The egg rolls were crunchy heaven. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I received an apology call the following day. She stated that they are understaffed at the moment and was willing to do whatever to make it right. In my opinion, your customer should never feel that there is an issue, or have to assume that the restaurant is under some type of distress. However, I did appreciate the call and the apology as the woman seemed very sincere."}
{"text":"Tried out Jasmine Thai today with a friend. Friendly staff, nice place. But the food was not to great.  I had beef pad thai- Weak taste, didn't eat the beef. I ordered the fresh shrimp rolls because of pic on yelp. I did NOT receive what was show. I ended up pulling out most of the lettuce and it filled 2 white plates- What the heck? I should have taken a pic. It could have made a large salad. nothing but lettuce and shrimp. Didn't finish eating because one of the shrimp looked greyish and suspect.  My friend ordered veggie chow mien, It smelled great and she liked it."}
{"text":"Excellent food and well-mannered staff. However they confuse peoples' orders a lot. It might be the language barrier."}
{"text":"Me and my mom came here cause we unfortunately were across the street at the hospital, went to grab a bite to eat and it was within walking distance because I did not want to lose my parking. We had no idea what to order but I read reviews and ordered the pad Thai and my mom got the orange chicken. Wow the orange chicken was light and crispy with a great flavor. The pad Thai was good never had it before. I'd come back if I was in the area oh and I am not sure if she was the owner but what a sweetheart."}
{"text":"I love Thai food, unfortunately and surprisingly in downtown Phoenix the options for good Thai food are slim. Most places in the area charge a lot for small portions. My go to is Panang curry and almost every Thai place gives me a tiny cup of rice with a big portions of sauce. Jasmine Thai does this. I recently got the vegetarian Panang, with veggie egg roles and Thai iced tea. I thought the portions were too small, including the iced tea. The veggies were predominantly cabbage(no thanks). With all the disappointing Thai places in my neighborhood it makes more sense for me to just get a Thai inspired dish from Pei Wei. It's not authentic and I'd rather support a local business, but at east with Pei Wei the portions are good and the taste is consistent."}
{"text":"The flavor of every dish is very distinct and flavorful. It's absolutely delicious.  Best Thai in the valley.  You won't find a better selection and incredible curry flavors anywhere else in the the city.  The chef and owners are from Vietnam and the food reflects it perfectly!"}
{"text":"I miss good, cheap Thai food! I used to travel to LA pretty frequently, and I got spoiled in having a nearby restaurant that was good and cheap.  Jasmine Thai is good, but the prices are on the high side. The spicy shrimp coconut soup was tasty, but a similar dish would have been $3-4 cheaper in La. The chicken larb was very good, but it, too was a buck or two more than I thought reasonable. The papaya salad was the best dish; it was at an OK price.  We ordered the food \"medium spicy\" -- always a good idea at a new restaurant. It came out with just the right degree of heat: my tongue stinged (strang?), but there was no  alcohol taste that sometimes accompanies overly spiced foods.  My beloved and I decided that this would be a once-in-awhile addition to our restaurant rotation, only because of the prices. Somehow, the food just doesn't seem to taste as good if you feel that you've been overcharged."}
{"text":"I ordered the Red Curry w/ Chicken, to go. The serving size made me laugh - it measured out to 8oz...same size as those cute stubby bottles of water you see but never buy. 3 Dixie cups is more than 8oz. 8oz is the size of a measuring cup. $11/cup isn't something I'm okay paying for at a Thai restaurant. Food tasted fine so there's hope that they stop rationing their portions as if there's an epidemic"}
{"text":"Not bad, not great. The fresh rolls did disappoint. I don't like the plastic wrap deal and I prefer mine with peanut sauce. The pad see ew was okay, they didn't add tofu like I asked. Good assortment of vegetables. This would be fine if it was cheaper, but for the price I won't be back."}
{"text":"Jasmine Thai is surely recommended by my husband and me. We ordered hot and sour vegetable soup (vegetarian version), egg rolls and noodle soup with pork. Everything that we ordered was very tasty. The restaurant was very clean in comparison to many Thai and non Thai restaurants in Phoenix. The service was also nice. Overall experience was very good."}
{"text":"Went to Jasmine Thai yesterday for lunch, server was so nice, restaurant is clean. i didnt get the chance to use their restroom so i couldnt tell whether its clean or not... we ordered the  Cashew Chicken and Pineapple Chicken Fried rice. food taste was alright. It wasn't all that compared to the other Thai Resto's I've been to.  The food portion was so little. I thought it was their lunch special but it was not :( also tried their honeycomb cookies and cashew cookies - they were yummy too. overall - it was okay. i give it 3 stars, not bad but not great."}
{"text":"Spicy fried rice was fireeeeeee... literally lol I got level 4 out of 5... but still very tasty! The dumplings were also equally as good buttttt the tempora shrimp was not good.... the only reason they are missing a start from me ."}
{"text":"Amazing Thai for the price. I will be back soon!  I had the Duck Noodle Soup and it was fabulous. Our service was wonderful, the spice station is as advertised... HOT!   Also enjoyed the Shrimp Rolls to appetize my pallet before the duck rodeo. The menu is what you would expect from Thai but also included some Chinese items such as orange chicken.  Overall, this place excelled. I give it 5 stars for consistency and quality. I've been here over a dozen times and every entree Thai item is spot on."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! Service was good and the restaurant was clean. I am tempted to rate their pa-nang as the best in town. It had just the right amount of spice and left us wanting more. We also tried potstickers and were pleasantly surprised. The dumpling was cooked perfectly and was very flavorful. We can't wait to be back & try more dishes."}
{"text":"The food was fresh, flavorful and very affordable.  The staff and service were friendly and accommodating.  I loved everything about my dining experience!"}
{"text":"Mediocre Thai food--not too impressed.  I had the mixed vegetables with chicken in a mild spicy sauce.  Dish was salty and the spice they use are flakes."}
{"text":"Very clean restaurant, extensive menu, and the takeout we got was delicious.  Spicy noodles, red curry, tom kha soup and shrimp spring rolls were all memorable.  The rolls were incredibly fresh.  There are whole kaffir lime leaves in the soup, which is a good sign that the chef cares.  Let's see, what else.. I love that they packed our takeout order with cardboard at the bottom of the plastic bag to keep items from tipping.  Attention to detail!  Prices are reasonable.  Give this place a try, for sure."}
{"text":"I would like to say that I enjoyed my soup but alas, no. I ordered #29 beef soup. Garlic was featured. But it was fried garlic! Nooooo. Just chop a clove man. The \"meat\" balls were those little rubber balls that bounce from here to kingdom come. Not to worry; there's only 2 of those little babies in there. Don't know about the other dishes but I would specify, \"no garlic\" unless you want to smell like Lipton Onion Soup for the next couple days. Service was friendly. The waitress bent over backwards to make me happy and that's why they get 3. Count Em. 3 whole stars.   No chop sticks! Come on man. You guys can do better. Heard someone say \" this was good. I'd definitely come back\". So... There were satisfied customers."}
{"text":"I haven't had pad Thai in a long time! I decided to give it a try..  I asked for medium spice, the pad Thai had lots of flavor.. It was a bit spicier than medium but that was fine with me since I can handle it. But might be a different story for others.  The iced code had a smoky taste to it. Different but good.   Great place for some delicious Thai food!"}
{"text":"Just left. Only served water. Apparently they are more interested in serving to go orders than those in the restaurant.  We were the only occupied table in the restaurant and they never took our order. Several take out orders were served, but we were ignored. Go to Sa Bai Thai. They are awesome."}
{"text":"Officially a regular at this spot, I have tried multiple dishes by now. It's pretty authentic and delicious! The lunch specials are great you end up getting a lot of food for like 9 bucks ! Everything I've tried is good and the service is also really friendly and as efficient as they can be in a tiny place like this."}
{"text":"We don't like to comment on new restaurants, especially specialty ones like Thai, until we've tried them a few times. Well we typically have eaten Thai a couple of times a month. We've been motivated to.dine at Jasmine a half dozen times in the past month, ordered about a third of the menu and we're sure. This is now our \"go to,\" Thai. Sorry quirky Thai Hut, and inconsistent Thai Tygher, even nearby Sochu are not even close. In fact the Tempura Shrimp, may be the best in the City. Our tempura standard has been Yamato and New Otami in LA and these measure up well. Tom Ga and yellow curry are memorable. Pad see ew was also enjoyable. Management cares about its customers and are eager to provide recommendations."}
{"text":"A friend and I went here this weekend after reading the great reviews (and since it is in my 'hood). I was so excited to try it! Unfortunately, it didn't exactly live up to the glowing reviews. The space is nice, very quiet and relaxing, and the service was attentive. I ordered the spicy noodles and my friend had the pad see ew. Although both dishes seemed fresh, with fresh veggies and juicy chicken, the flavor was lacking. Hers was almost completely flavorless. Mine, ordered 'hot' was also fairly bland... more of a medium spicy and lacking seasoning. I would like to and probably will try this place again, as it is close to my house, and hope that other items (such as curries and soups) are more flavorful."}
{"text":"Not bad, but not great. Stopped in for dinner one night. There's lots of parking right behind the building, so don't stress yourself in the tiny lot out front.  Restaurant is small, cute, and the staff are super nice. Started out with the chicken satay, which was good. Flavor was nice, chicken was juicy, and the peanut sauce was fine. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't outstanding.  Entrees were pad thai with chicken and red curry with tofu. I thought the pad thai was a bit too sweet, and it almost had a touch of ketchup flavor. I'm not sure how it was seasoned, but it wasn't my favorite pad thai. Red curry was fine - again, nothing extraordinary.  If I wanted a quick bite, I wouldn't mind stopping in. I think it's a great spot for those at St. Joes wanting to get out of the hospital system and grab lunch. Same goes for anyone else working nearby. I wouldn't make a special trip of visiting, but overall it was fine."}
{"text":"We ordered out here because it's close to home and I was ready to give a new Thai place a try. We ordered spring rolls, chicken pad Thai, and yellow curry chicken. The spring rolls had the taste of old deep fryer oil and the amount of rice served with the curry was only enough for half the serving of curry. The curry itself was good and the pad Thai was alright. We will probably try ordering out from somewhere else next time."}
