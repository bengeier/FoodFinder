{"text":"This was the worst experience ever. NEVER go here. The wings are so small and over priced. You should just go to wild wings on whites road with better service, better food and a better price.   I've been to other all star Wings like the ones in Vaughan and Scarborough but this by far has to be the worst experience I've had. I still can't believe how tiny the wings were and how cold they were when we got them. It did not have a fresh taste to them at all. I'm definitely not coming back here."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I've been to many all star wings locations. I live in Durham and used to trek out and wait for a seat at the Vaughan location, as it was my favorite.  Life's changed... the Pickering location has definitely won me over. From friendly smiles, low wait times and fresh food to the table this location definitely has great service down.  For the first time I've had crispy fresh Greek Fries. The Hawian burger was fabulous and the loaded potato was better than most. But the baked potato is not worth the $3 substitution cost.  The wings weren't as big as other locations but the advantage is less batter and more flavour and room for more Greek Fries.  Definitely the new go to spot in Durham."}
{"text":"Wings flavours are same as other all stars locations but wings ARE INCREDIBLY SMALL. Will never go here again. Save your money"}
{"text":"I've been to All-Star Wings a few times before,  but I  don't think I'll be going back.  The menu doesn't describe the many wing flavours, the wings are tiny, and for fried food on a not busy night, the food took a long time. Adding to the fact that their fries, both regular and sweet potato, are not good at all and are served with very unappealing sauces, this location only has one flavour of daiquiris, strawberry.   Ugh.  While the have a bunch of beers, not much in the way of cocktails for non-beer drinkers.  I can get bigger better wings and fries elsewhere.   Oh yeah, kids meals are expensive and don't include a drink or dessert."}
{"text":"In my personal experience, I don't think this place deserves two stars. The food was good, I came on a Tuesday so I got the half rack of ribs, a pound of wings and upgraded the fries to greek fries combo. If you come to All Stars, greek fries are a must. It is expensive but it's All Stars - don't expect it to be a cheap eat if you want to be full. The food did take way longer than I expected but they accommodated the best they could so they deserve credit for their customer service. Also, it was empty when I went which I liked."}
{"text":"Came here last night. Though the food was good the service was so crappy. Our waitress got our orders the first time, and right before she left repeated the order and messed up so we corrected her. Then she came back again and asked to make sure my friends orders were right. Then she came back a third time to make sure again. At this point we were convinced we would get something wrong. There were three of us there, and my friend ordered 3 different wings. The waitress brought out all his food at once, instead of bringing anything for me or my friend. Then at least 3 minutes later she comes out with our food and says \"I forgot I didn't bring out your food\". All in all, the place was pretty empty and you'd think the service would be good because of that. But it was definitely not."}
{"text":"The wings were small but the portion size was a good size. I do wish the menu has description of each flavour rather asking the waitress what is in it and they need to refer to a cheat sheet. We ordered two singles and Greek fries for two people which was more than enough. The Greek fries are to die for, delicious and creamy and must upgrade to beer battered fries for the extra crunchiness. Definitely would come back!"}
{"text":"I was kinda disappointed with this place. I have been twice. The ribs are really good. Get those. The wings however aren't that great. They are tiny for one. And second, though it sounds like a good at first, there are like 200 different wing sauces. And they don't tell you whats in them. You are expected to ask the server, and they will tell you whats in it from memory. Or at least that's how it's supposed to work. Like I am for choice, but I think in this case there are too many. So the flavours i did choose weren't great. The beer selection was also pretty weak."}
{"text":"The amount of wing flavours are ridiculous. On top of that, you'd have to ask your server who carried a cheat sheet of what the wing flavours were - this was tedious as you'd spend a long time figuring flavours out (especially if you're in a large group). See... their wings flavours are made up of combinations of your standard wing flavours (i.e. Hot, Medium, Cajun, etc...). I believe I tried a combination of greek and suicide which turned out to be pretty tasty. Overall, wings were good and the server was very kind."}
{"text":"For a place called all star wings, this place does not really make good wings. They were small and very dry... Leaves little to be desired.   Luckily they have other menu options like a whole page of grilled cheese sandwiches to choose from! We had the Pork It which had bbq pulled pork, caramelized onions, brie and bacon. It was pretty good and well presented.  My favorite part of the visit would be the deep fried pickle spears from the app menu. The dill sauce is a bit watery but otherwise it was a nice start to the meal :) maybe I'll be back just for the appetizer next time  Staff are nice and the booths are clean with their own little TV. They checked up on us fairly regularly so we didn't have trouble getting water refilled or anything."}
{"text":"This was the absolute worst service I've ever had. Waited for 20 mins to get a drink, 15 more mins to get a menu, after an hour wait,ordered the bill instead of the food. Stay away."}
{"text":"Please Avoid at all cost, go anywhere but here, There is nothing here what potrace in menu and picture are misleading , great job of photos,interior and exterior inviting ,but Moment I walked in I got sense this place was empty not a single sole at Bar and Only 2 table occupied we the 3 rd.  But how bad wings and mozzarella sticks can be Believe me this is the worst food I ever tasted poor Quality over priced , it is over priced even it was FREE,I feel sorry for franchisee who hit suckered in this Mess, I am from Texas this would close in 6 months tops.   As u see to attached receipt we order 4 appetizers and 3 dinner I opt out moment I saw  Appetizers, ican go on tear this place apart but get the message .  And staff attitude ,service, is on the bottom they were never trained to serve human beings they she should work in Toronto zoo,where no body would write a review. If corporate has balls they would contact me to save their investments and issue a full refund case I had to drink 2 Perrier at cost of 6.20 in Mall to settle my stomach and I can eat any thing this crap served fried to death ,my mistake I apologize but I was guest ."}
{"text":"worst place ever. I would no recommend it to anyone! I went last on a weekday evening the service was terrible to say the least. out waitress was too busy doing other things to tend to her table. the looks from the staff were rude. when I apologized and went to ask the waitress for something she responded with what? in the most rude manner. I went to the washroom after dinner only to hear the other waitress talk about how fucked up they had gotten there the night before. moreover when they saw me they just continued their conversation. the Greek fries were really good but the wings were subpar. I would never return to this location and probably deter anyone I know from going back. I also went on the website to file a formal complaint but couldn't because there was no option and the website is horribly maintained. you would assume this is a local mom and pop shop not a multi billion dollar industry. #allstarwings"}
{"text":"overpriced food  horrible service...  our waitress forgot our food multiple times and most of woman just want to serve the men for extra tips  the food was not even good and the wings were blah"}
{"text":"Came to this all-stars location for a lunch break with my coworkers. I usually go to the Scarborough location by Scarborough Town centre but was in pickering for some training.  I was left disappointed. We arrived around 3:30pm and the place was pretty empty. Our hostess Kayleigh seated us promptly and even gave us a look at her ingredient book so that we can have a better look at the sauces!  My partner and I shared a pound of Vesuvius wings and Greek fries as well. The portion of the fries and the Greek sauce was bigger than the Scarborough location which was great considering how hungry we were. The problem? Our food took 30mins to come and I had a hair in my Greek fries!! I noticed it when we almost finished our basket so I didn't feel like it was worth telling the manager, especially since our server wasn't really attentive (on a dead day!!) as our water glasses were empty most of the time. She was nice though so that was okay."}
{"text":"Been here a handful of times, I usually get the same order.. food is fine (just fine). Pro about this location is that it is very clean & never busy so you never have to wait for a table!  Each time I get a different server, only one has ever introduced herself by name.. Alicia? She wasn't necessarily enthusiastic but we got everything we needed in a timely manner.  Another visit, I was seated in the lounge/bar area so I was able to watch my server make my drink. I ordered a mojito and it tasted awful. I'm pretty sure the server put Absolut vodka instead of rum. But I was able to get it replaced (played it safe and got a beer)"}
