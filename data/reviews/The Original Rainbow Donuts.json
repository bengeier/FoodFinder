{"text":"I was craving donuts being 5 months pregnant. It's a once a month treat. My fiancé and I drove over for a change of scenery. You can smell the freshness of the donuts as you walk into the store. Variety was definitely there. The maple bacon donut-OMG!! THE BEST MAPLE BACON DONUT I'VE EVER HAD HANDS DOWN!! We got there around 8:15am and it wasn't too busy. Check out their Instagram page- _rainbowdonuts to get a free donut! Super friendly staff. I would definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"The donuts are at a whole new level (in the vacinity off heaven) than your regular donut shops. I had no idea donuts could be this good. Go early to get the best."}
{"text":"Rainbow Donuts your, donuts are good. Nothing to special to say about your spot. It's pretty straight forward. I like the modern feel to it, especially the signage. Doesn't seem like your typucal donut shops. Thanks guys, had your Apple Fritter it was good."}
{"text":"I haven't met a donut I didn't like here at Rainbow Donuts.  The old-fashioned donuts, chocolate bars, and french crullers are my favorites.  They even make croissant breakfast sandwiches, which also hit the spot on the mornings that we come here.  Don't bother with Dunkin Donuts if you want authentic donuts at great prices.  The service has always been great and the young lady who works here is always smiling.  :)"}
{"text":"Boo, we went here for a cronut today, but we must've come too late (they close at 2 on Sundays-not 4!) and we were stuck with a raspberry filled cronut. It was waaaaaayyy too sweet, and just a little \"old\". Same goes for the chocolate croissant. I've yet to eat the cinnamon roll or maple donut, but I'm sure it's the same. I just need to get there bright and early!"}
{"text":"After tasting these donuts, I realized that not all Rainbow Donuts are created equal. These are the best I've had in the Valley.  Worth braving those early Sunday mornings to get my fix."}
{"text":"Try getting a tasty treat and a good sized iced tea across the parking lot in that ridiculous looking building for $2.10..  Watch how fast you get thrown out of that line you were waiting in for the last 26 minutes. I am so glad I came by, this is exactly the type of place we should all be supporting! I can't wait to come back, perfect spot to walk/bike to in the morning.  PS It certainly seems like that 1 negative review should be considered for removal.."}
{"text":"So....my husband decided to bring me a half a dozen donuts while I was taking a nap today. He got a variety box with some classics and something that looked like a chocolate cake doughnut but turned out to be the most delightful blueberry doughnut I've ever tasted. All the doughnuts were crispy and wonderful on the outside and soft and fluffy on the inside. Absolute perfection; I'm in love."}
{"text":"The best glazed donuts ever? I will go nowhere else. Used to be a Dunkin' Donuts fan... Not anymore!"}
{"text":"It's a donut shop, and the donuts here are GREAT. That's all you need to know. Go get you some donuts. And get there early because they do run out of things."}
{"text":"Came on a Saturday morning and it was packed! You gotta come early for good selection and I'm not talking 8 AM early I mean actually early. I got the fruity pebble and Berry and cream donut which were both fantastic!"}
{"text":"Best donuts in town, the only problem is they run out early!!"}
{"text":"Good prices. Drive thru ... But always Fun sitting with the old folks on a Saturday morning.   Recently discontinued the Smoothies - the boy was disappointed. Fresh donuts!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. You can tell the donuts are made fresh daily. They have a great selection, they're open pretty late if you're in the mood for a late night snack, and most importantly I've never got a donut from here that wasn't great!"}
{"text":"OMG! Best donuts ever! Have the Samoa. It is to die for!! They are light and delicious. And the staff is so friendly. Do not pass this place up."}
{"text":"I'm not impressed.  These are average donuts, not worth driving 13 miles. You can get just as good if not better at your local supermarket or Dunkin'. I went today at noon.  The counter help was surly and refused to identify which flavors were which.  When I asked for a specific donut,  I was told, \"This is all we have.\" with a wave gesture at the case.  I found the flavor on my own.  I wasn't thanked.  As a first time customer, I can  say I'll never be back."}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of donuts, but their donuts changed my life! OH EM GEE! So good! These donuts were looking so delicious and the racks were full of beautiful goodies, I couldn't help myself! I initially came in for a cup of coffee but left the shop with 2 dozen donuts. MAPLE BAR, BOMB.COM!"}
{"text":"We went this morning!! The service was fast and efficient! Out donuts were very fresh!! We took our kids with us, and they were very friendly and welcoming to them. We will be going back!"}
{"text":"Delicious donuts and great service! One Saturday a month my 8 year old son and I have a special Donut date and we recently went to The Original Rainbow Donuts shop. What a great find! Everything we ordered was soft and fresh not hard and old like some spots we have tried. Parking is easy and even though they were a bit on the crowded side, we know Saturdays can be that way as donuts in the AM are the best!"}
{"text":"Tried it while visiting the area a couple weeks back.  I'd definitely go back but they have a little room for improvement on the cooking of each donut and the ratios here and there.  Good service and fair prices."}
{"text":"I've been going here since I was 5 years old, they have never disappointed. From donut holes to a cinnamon twist, all their donuts are the best. Flavor overload in every bite! Their glazed and chocolate long johns are AMAZING!"}
{"text":"These donuts are the best donuts I've ever had!  I can't believe how good they are!  Better than local donut!"}
{"text":"Good donuts. Great selection. Workers are always cheery. My kids love this place. Me too!"}
{"text":"Just as yummy as the Cave Creek location And a wide selection on a late Sunday morning!"}
{"text":"This donut place is the best kept secret. I can only assume it's a secret because the couple times I have went it is never busy. The employees are not very pleasant and neither is the decor but that is not why I go. The doughnuts are simply amazing. Some of them are mediocre but more often than not they are fantastic. Personally I love the Fruity Pebbles one and the cinnamon glazed one. But they have so many more that are just as awesome."}
{"text":"Tom: I've heard great things about this place and it is always busy when I drive by so I decided to surprise some co-workers and grab some donuts for them for breakfast.  The donuts were pretty stale.  Although they looked like they make their own donuts the display box for the donuts were running low so I could tell that I wasn't getting fresh ones which was disappointing.  I saw a sandwich called a Egg/Ham/Cheese/Bacon and had a choice of bagel or croisant and I got the croisant.  Wow.  This was just a mushy soaked thing.  Don't really know how to call it.  Just awful.  Also, what kind of soda choices are these?  RC Cola?  REALLY?  I had to get a Sunkist Orange which is ok but come on.  Pepsi or Coke.  Won't go back..."}
{"text":"there bacon,ham,egg cheese sandwich !!!!!! there donuts are soft,warm,and fresh., simply delicious"}
{"text":"Ever since we moved into our place a few years back this has been our favorite and only place to go for donuts.  A very popular and renowned donut shop has since been opened in our area, but Rainbow Donuts can't be beat!  After going to the new one once or twice we realized how much better Rainbow Donuts is.  They're always friendly, always delicious, and always a very wide variety of all the flavors you'd expect.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Been here twice in the last week. Their donuts are SO. GOOD.  The girls who work here are friendly and helpful. I'll keep coming back because man. I can't stop thinking about these donuts."}
{"text":"If you know of a better donut joint, please let me in on it. This place simply can't be beat."}
{"text":"Since my relocation from California, I have been in search of a GOOD donut shop. I thought I would forever be left with the wimpy and oily donuts from Dunkin Donuts and the major grocery stores, that was until I found a Rainbow Donuts. The donuts are fresh, big, light, and DELICIOUS! The maple bar is huge and the flavor is perfect. They have a huge selection from your classics to fruity pebble topped donuts. My son and I fought over the last bite of the red velvet crumb donut. I will definitely be returning to Rainbow Donuts."}
{"text":"I love donuts. It's so hard to find a good donut these days. Luckily, I decided to \"Yelp\" donuts and what do you know - Yelp comes through once again. We split a gigantic cherry fritter type donut and we still didn't finish it, mainly due to the fact we just had to try a buttermilk donut. But I did manage to scarf down the remaining piece of cherry donut later on and I enjoyed every bite. Crispy brown on the outside and moist and delicious on the inside. It's definitely something one would get a craving for every now and then. Decadent!"}
{"text":"I didn't even get a chance to take pics of the delicious looking doughnuts. First off they are open super early!! Bonus points there. And then they were fantastic. I got a cream filled chocolate glaze, Apple fritter, and a toasted coconut. Each one was exactly what I was craving. Thank you for the great service and wonderful breakfast!!"}
{"text":"With the addition of the cronuts and new flavors, I have to rave about the new variety but same old taste. What can I say? Being the duke adds responsibility of ensuring this place gets the credit for best donut shop in Phoenix!  Now, what makes a good donut? It has to be light and fluffy. Not light as in fat free, but light and fluffy, as you take a bite, your teeth sink right through the icing and dough. It leaves a moist chew in your mouth while allowing you to savor the flavor. Rainbow delivers this with every single donut! You got that right, I just dropped some donut knowledge up in here.  I have heard many great things about cronuts. I mean I love croissants, but mixed with a donut? Oh yea, I am feeling the jive now. We tried the glazed and cinnamon. It wasn't light and fluffy, but definitely a soft crunch that packs the same old Rainbow flavor that this location only offers. Does this beat out my maple bar infatuation? Please don't make me choose! However, I will have to be so bold to say that this place keeps getting better. The family is great, the service is top notch, and it makes this Yelper proud to be Duke! Lastly, they mix the cronuts with fresh fruit if you so choose. That is definitely next on my list! Do I even need to say I will see you again Rainbow? Oh yea, probably next Sunday!"}
{"text":"I've been to two locations and both are fantastic! We love to take our grandkids when they visit and its almost a tradition. You've got to try out the maple bar with bacon. It is good:)"}
{"text":"These are the best donuts in North Phoenix by far! I have yet to find another shop that even comes close. Anyone that eats at DD has no clue what they are missing out on.   A couple times per month I will wake up early on a Saturday and treat the family to these delicious gems of heaven. Everything that I have tried is amazing but I particularly enjoy the whip cream filled long johns or the apple fritters. I feel that I can only eat a maximum of two donuts before I enter a sugar coma.   From what I have read, this place is family owned which I would much rather support than a chain of donut shops."}
{"text":"Found this place a few years back and have continued to come when I need breakfast for the kids when in town and if the office needs donuts. It is a real old fashioned donut shop where everything is made in house each day. The place is clean the staff are friendly and if you don't arrive early enough the may have run out of your favorite kinds due to the donuts been so good. It is not a surprise to hear people calling in orders for 5 to 7 dozen donuts for pick up the next day. Lots of place to choose to get donuts from but this is one of the best in the valley."}
{"text":"Every time I've come they don't have the donuts they are advertising, and I've come on the morning as well and they still don't have them. Never coming back!"}
{"text":"I came here because of all the great Yelp reviews on a weekend early afternoon. They still had a decent variety of donuts at that time and they appeared to be fresh.  Overall I'd say these donuts are slightly better than average (average being the donuts you buy from the bakery at the grocery store.  Their a little too sweet because of the icing/toppings they use, and the dough itself isn't as light and airy as I would imagine a good donut to be.  The actual doughnut itself (minus the icing/sprinkles) was dense and not sweet/flavorful on its own- maybe some vanilla extract would help give it better flavor.    Slightly above average donuts but I would rather go to Bosa donuts."}
{"text":"A classic American donut shop.  Their glazed donuts are a sublime expression of the baker's art.     Every now and then I  buy two dozen and take them to work.   I have always heard expressions from my coworkers on how truly good Rainbow donuts products are."}
{"text":"This place is like crack, be careful. One bite of that mouth watering delicious blueberry cake doughnut and you will have glorified taste buds leaping for joy and excitement. The jelly glazed melts in your mouth like crispy creme and the middle is filled more than Santa's sack on Christmas Eve. Yea they might be unsocial, they're up slaving their tail feather over hot stoves at 4am while your nuzzled up in your snuggy. This place is stellar. Huge long choc/vanilla twists oh my lanta"}
{"text":"I came here with my family the other morning to get a bunch of donuts and we had a pretty nice experience.   It's a decent-sized shop and the staff are friendly. They have a nice selection of donuts and we got over a dozen.   The prices are very reasonable and the donuts tasted very good!  I would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Every pregnant woman's dream (and her husbands that she drags along ) enjoyed every bite!"}
{"text":"GREAT doughnuts! I stop by on my way home once a week to pick up a bakers dozen (14) from Rainbow.. They are always so nice! Sometimes if you get there too early the selection is minimal although there's never been a bad one. The maple long johns are great and the croissants are hand made and AMAZING!"}
{"text":"My sister and her guy let me tag along with them to get donuts after they completed a hike. For a donut shop, being open until 6 in the evening is strange and I was worried that there would be very little options left when we went  about an hour before they closed. But I was happily wrong, there were plenty of choices. The woman working was super friendly and patient as the 3 of us made our decisions and gawked at the delicious looking choices. I got a half dozen to bring back to our hotel to share with the parents. My favorite of the ones I took were the red velvet  ones. I did not share any of those ones ( I think I had 2 of them), good for breakfast, dessert, or just a midday snack. So good, so good, so good. The Original Rainbow donuts will stay near the top of my list, if or when I get back tot the area."}
{"text":"No really - if this place goes anywhere Phoenix;  AZ for that matter will have lost something monumental.  I am not over exagerrating when I say, at the top of my voice.....THESE ARE THE BEST DAMN DONUTS YOU WILL EVERY EAT.  They are light and big, the long john with the cream down the middle is unlike anything you've tasted.  The cream isn't super disgusting sweet so it goes so well with the chocolate or maple frosting.  It is owned and operated daily by the same people.  You won't see anyone different every time you go there.  I have one drug.  Coffee.  Second drug every 2 months.  Rainbow Donuts on Cave Creek and Greenway, not all the same this is the best in the west.  Bar none.  Try it you'll see why.    Try not to cry when you go there."}
{"text":"If you are a cake donut lover, hurry over and try some from The Original Rainbow Donut ASAP! The cake donut I tried had a lightly-fried-crisped outside and a soft-not-too sugar forward inside, which in my opinion makes a cake donut top notch. Each donut we tried was great, but it was the cake donut that prompted me to write this review. I also appreciated the neat and tidy atmosphere. And how fun is their donut van?!  In summary: go treat yourself to one of their cake donuts!"}
{"text":"I went here yesterday for national donut day. I love the variety of donuts that they have. The donuts were delicious and fresh. They were even moist. No dry donut here."}
{"text":"Donuts are yummy! The staff are very welcoming and amazing. No complaints! Thank you for providing wonderful service!"}
{"text":"We were on vacation and decided one morning to get some donuts.  We were not disappointed.   Not only are they very inexpensive they were great tasting.   We even made a second trip to Get more a day later."}
{"text":"Generous, fresh and well balanced donuts!  Love this place.  The creme filled do not have overly sweet creme--delicious."}
{"text":"Ordered some cinnamon twists with chocolate milk. I found these very good. I will continue to try others donuts from this location."}
{"text":"I am not really sure what the hype is about. We went by in the afternoon and the place was cleaned out. We managed to get a few of what was left plus donut holes (my fave!). The donuts tasted fine - nothing spectacular and nothing I would drive out here for. We were pretty underwhelmed *sigh*"}
{"text":"This is a good donut place... with the awesome cake donuts that they lack at all the friggin Dunkin Donuts that they have in Phoenix.  I'm glad that I found this place and that it's relatively close to home- the generic chain donut places just don't do it for me like the little ma & pop run places."}
{"text":"Well, this is a very good option when I don't want to drive over 25 miles for a donut.  My kids ask to have donuts every so often so when this place opened up, it was great news for my family.  They have you typical donuts, although I would love to see a maple donut instead of just maple long johns, one can only dream.  My little boy can gobble up a couple of donuts with chocolate glaze, while my girl will have a glazed donut and a maple long john.  Service is friendly and prompt.  We will be visiting often."}
{"text":"My daughter's favorite Bubble Tea place with lots of choices. We got ourselves a Ice Thai Tea with Boba, Ice Thai Coffee and my wife favorite Taro!"}
{"text":"Their donuts were the best I'd had in a long time. The 2x Chocolate and Blueberry had a crunchy exterior, and a very moist interior: perfect! Also have a nice selection of \"crazy\" donuts with gooey frosting and topped with gummy worms that my youngest enjoyed very much."}
{"text":"Great donuts! Forget Krispy Kreme. This is where you go for great donuts. So many varieties. Try the long johns with the strawberries! So awesome"}
{"text":"Perfect, homemade, local donut shop. They have so many different types and flavors. The croissants are the best I have ever had, someone in the back is an expert baker. Really nothing but perfection. They have a drive through if your interested in getting donuts in your pjs."}
{"text":"This is the best donut shop that I have ever been to!  It is a family run business and  the owner, Gina,  is always there.  Every person that works there is extremely pleasant!!  Unfortunately, this place is on my way to work, and my families house... so I am tempted EVERYDAY!  :)  The last time I drove by my sister talked me into stopping but I didn't want to go in because the line was so long.   I gave in and we stood in line...but they were so dang quick that we didn't wait more than 5 minutes.   I must say, the young man behind the counter is very VERY patient.  A customer ahead of us was being rude and annoying.  The young man just smiled and took it in stride.  Yay for him!     I almost forgot.....their donuts are fantastic!! Bakers dozen is 14 instead of 13."}
{"text":"Loved the traditional donuts. They were just undercooked but that is better than over cooked and dry. I would for sure go back."}
{"text":"Kind of similar to another popular donut shop in the Phoenix metro area, but with much better service and no sticky notes for customers posted around the shop. This shop is located in a bit of a hodge podge area, not too far from some great hiking areas. I was impressed with the cleanliness of the building's exterior and interior. They offered most of the usual donut fixes, plus a few extra creative concoctions. The service was excellent and prices were very reasonable. Definitely, worth stopping by if you are in the area."}
{"text":"There is no better place to go for fresh delicious donuts. If you get there early, the selection is amazing. I've been late in the day where there is not much left but went ahead and tried what they had left and that was still amazing.  You will never get donuts anywhere else if you go here. They are definitely worth it."}
{"text":"I thought this place was related to Rainbow Donuts, but is not. It's a completely different concept. The donuts to begin with are more creative. Lots of different looking donuts, lots of sugar. Looots! I had a terrible case of sugar rush when I got out of there but you didn't hear me complaining. None of the donuts look the same. Some of them have chunks of peanuts or more velvet cream than the others, but that's what made them original. I actually liked the service. There was always a smile and in my own experience it was easy and fast to order. I wished they had more breakfast itemu like rainbow donuts, but they may in the future  as they grow. And by that I also mean the locale. The place is tiny, but you can put that down as another reason why they look so original."}
{"text":"Delicious donuts and amazing customer service. I asked about their Thai iced coffee and the woman working behind the counter poured me a sample bigger than some Starbucks drinks I've had! Hidden gem."}
{"text":"This doughnut shop is seriously amazing. If you want something special though you better come in early!  You walk in and it looks like your typical doughnut shop, the interior is a little outdated and you can tell they've had their tables for a long time. It's ok because I don't come here for the atmosphere! Their doughnuts are all so delicious and very reasonably priced.   My absolute favorite here is their cherry fritter! Can't wait for my next visit."}
{"text":"Donuts are always a simple treat to put smiles on faces. Whether it is dropping them off to an office, treat for a friend or to help crave the sugar craving in your appetite. Rainbow donuts is the perfect place to stop in to dig in.   There are donuts for every craving person's taste bud's desire. I found a sprinkled donut with fruit loops on it. Or even the Oreo Cookie topped chocolate donuts. To the plain twisted glazed donuts I promise you will be in love.  I won't stop there besides buy a dozen or two of your favorite treats grab a refreshing drink to wash it down. From coffee to juice and much more."}
{"text":"Oh donut, how I love thee.  Rainbow donuts has the best donuts (I've had thus far). I really like how they offer the classic donuts, but they also have new flavors all the time.  My favorite is the cherry fritter, and they are very generous on the size!   Their prices are good also, not too pricey, but more expensive than the grocery store. However, quality counts here!  I would recommend this place to anyone who loves donuts or whoever wants to try a new place."}
{"text":"Went there early Saturday morning and there were well over 20 varieties of donuts & 4 different kinds of donut holes. Donuts range from $.79-$.89 cents.  The cinnamon donut & blueberry donut were really good. The crumb donut wasn't spectacular. Overall it tasted fresh, soft, and sugary.  I would visit again if I'm in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Wonderful family owned business! So happy it opened right around the corner. The doughnuts are fresh and delicious and the prices are great. Stop here for your morning coffee!"}
{"text":"We love doughnuts and had to stop when we read the reviews. Super soft doughnuts and so many flavors to pick from.  It was hard to decide"}
{"text":"best donuts in the world. everything one could imagine has been created in donut form. open 4 am to 4 PM. mouth watering as I type"}
{"text":"Start of my morning for the last 20 years because of the family settling and fresh atmosphere keep it up giys"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying the product is stupendous. Really. Delicious beyond belief. The raised glazed donut with cinnamon in the center is life-changing. But, I am literally out from now, at 1pm, and am staring at an \"Open\" sign with locked doors. Locked. Doors.   My level of disappointment has driven me to write my first Yelp review. I'm an AZ native who lives out-of-state, and this was my one shot to get my favorite donuts.   Ugh! Thanks a bunch...   :-("}
{"text":"The place is clean and the donuts are very fresh. I am a fan of their muffins. They use plenty of walnuts on the banana nut muffins! I bought a batch for the offcie and I was the hero of the day... just that day (Lol). From my observation though, they are pretty busy so you better get there early if you want to have a good selection. Nice staff too!"}
{"text":"Best doughnuts in the Valley! Just wish the staff would crack a smile once in a while. Highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"Always my go to donut shop. The amazing aroma of donuts in the morning fills your lungs with absolute goodness and joy. These donuts are extremely delicious and tasty, they melt in your mouth. Once you have that first bite they taste like heavenly all to the very last bite. It's a nice and light dough not at all greasy. I have to be honest I can't just eat one. They are made in that very location and made fresh daily,  and I also heard they donate them at the end of the day to a church that feed the homeless. Bless them.  P.S. A must try!"}
{"text":"First time visit, won't be the last. Great selection. Donuts were fresh and very tasty.  Staff friendly and great service."}
{"text":"BEST. DONUTS. EVER.  Seriously, these are the best donuts I've ever eaten. I love donuts and I am ecstatic that I have found this place. We moved to Phoenix less than a month ago and this is a sign that we've moved to the right place.  I've had a number of different types of donuts here and all have been great. While they seem simple, the glazed raised donuts are delicious. Cinnamon crumb = yum. The buttermilk bars are killer. The donuts holes are also really great. I haven't had any of what they consider \"fancy donuts\", but they look amazing. I also can't wait to try the croissants after reading the reviews here.  You can't even compare Rainbow Donuts to Dunkin' Donuts. They are in a completely different class altogether. The donuts here are so light, it's dangerous. I could eat way too many. The baker's dozen is 14 donuts, but I haven't gotten that many yet. These don't keep long, which is a great sign that they aren't full of preservatives or unnecessary ingredients. The two college-aged kids that work here are super friendly, even after they've been asked a million times what each donut is.   Unfortunately (or maybe fortunately for my waistline), they run out early in the day. If this place was open for a late night donut run, I would be in trouble!"}
{"text":"First of all, I consider myself to be a donut aficianado, and would consider Dunkin Donuts chocolate glazed to be the penultimate donut around.  With that being said, I still give Rainbow donuts 5 stars because the donuts, including the chocolate glazed, are fantastic and fresh.  They have an extensive selection and are sure to make everyone in your sugar-crazed party happy.  Perfect for the after church crowd, and us sinners alike, Rainbow Donuts makes the best donuts in the valley!"}
{"text":"Maple bacon only made on weekends! Worth waiting all week for! Oh this place is the end of my waistline! Yikes.  Fresh donuts, need I say more? Oh yes, you can ALWAYS say BACON!!!! Friendly service, reasonable prices and fresh warm donuts. YUM.  This place is my go-to spot for donuts when I'm in the Phx/Scottsdale area.  HIGHLY recommended. And trust me, I've eaten a TON of donuts."}
{"text":"BEST DONUTS!!! I have had donuts all over the country and in Europe and I still think these are the best.   The blueberry cake donut has been my absolute flavor for a few years now and every time it's so delicious! I love that they have new unique flavors now like fruity pebbles and red velvet cake. The donuts are nice and fluffy; not too sweet.  Today, a lady, whom I assume is one of the owners was so sweet. She gave us the last creme brûlée donut to try (for free!).   Bonus: they've extended their hours till 5pm and have wifi!"}
{"text":"Not really much for me say hear...fresh doughnuts....great prices....you can get 6 doughnuts of your choice for under 5 bucks....WOW. Pretty good service....indoor and outdoor seating to enjoy your dougnuts...but they are only open from 4am to 3pm so if you want the best doughnuts get there early or before 2pm or they will be generally out of what you want....because I don't believe they make any more fresh doughnuts after 2pm. No doubt these are the best Doughnuts in the valley...maybe in the entire state of Arizona.  Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends!!! This is review number 200 for me...I am so happy....wohoo!!!"}
{"text":"Best donuts in the world. Been coming here since I was like 4. And to tell you the truth, ill never stop coming back."}
{"text":"Cool donut shop!! Although we got there at 10 on Saturday and all of the donuts we wanted to try (all of the specialty ones only served on the weekends) were already gone! Idk for a place that stays open until 5 pm you'd think they'd make more donuts to last the day.  There was still a pretty good selection though! Donuts are light and fluffy. My sister got an old fashioned one and a Samoa one. I got a long john eclair type thing with fresh strawberries on it. It was so delicious! The strawberries tasted super fresh. The red velvet donuts looked good too. Very yummy stuff here!"}
{"text":"You have to get here early and careful they close when they run out of donuts. This is a great spot for freshly made donuts. The prices are great and the breakfast sandwiches are good also.   I was a regular at D.D. in FL until they shrunk the portion sizes... Like we wouldn't notice Mr.Dunkin? Anyhow a huge tiger tail aka. Bow Tie or a giant Bear Claw for only $1.69, you can't beat it.    I've been a regular here for about a month, the only down side is if you go around noon your selection shrinks considerably. And don't expect them to be open by three. Enjoy your donuts, but if you start going to often you may have to renew your gym membership!"}
{"text":"This place makes my favorite maple bar in the Valley. Also, the apple fritter is huge! I like their coffee and the service is friendly. If you're looking for a delicious donut, I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Really good donuts! Came in late morning on a weekend and their stock was a little low, but I chose a few basics that my family really enjoyed."}
{"text":"Nobody, and I mean nobody makes chocolate covered longjohns like this place!  Thank God they're not too close to my house or I'd be as big as a house!  And nice people running the place, too."}
{"text":"Once in a while, I reward myself with just one donuts, just one, oh I could eat more than one but I know not to do that. Yesterday morning was the day I told myself when I woke up, today is the day!   After my annual physical exam, I searched for donuts on Yelp and this place came up on my search. As soon as I walked in, I smelled nice donuts. Oh that smell alone made me so happy.   I told the staff I can only have one she recommended bacon donuts. That will be the ultimate pleasure, bacon and donuts! I opted not to but I bet that will be heavenly good. I tried another big piece one, whip cream with strawberries. I took it back to my office and it was gone in a second.   They have boba drinks here and tried their iced milk tea with boba. Rare to see boba on this side of town, I was really happy to see one here.  So close to my office, I won't be a regular here but I know where to come next time I need to reward myself again."}
{"text":"Reminds me of the donuts of my childhood, so good. The first time I went was this past Saturday and they had two trays left at 2pm and I thought that was limited but I got a glazed to try them out. Wow was all I could say.  OK so I went today 6/24/10 and they had only 1 tray left and it was mostly donut holes at 10am and this was it no more to be made today; I was bummed.  But I got a dozen of those little gems and left to eat and sulk about the whole matter at home.  So the moral of this story is get your butt to Rainbow Donuts early if you want a good selection. Otherwise don't say I did not warn you. They are open from 4am to 3pm 7 days a week."}
{"text":"I love their donuts. It is hard to find a good cake donut that doesn't have a weird taste.  These donuts are always so fresh and soft.  I prefer the cake donuts while my son loves the glazed.  I even enjoy their croissants. I am so glad it is right down the street because every time I crave a donut I don't have to go far.  The employees are always very friendly   It is best to go earlier because sometimes later in the day they run out of certain types of donuts"}
{"text":"3.5 stars.  i agree that the donuts here are tasty, but i dunno if I can differentiate them between any other mom and pop type donut shop in the valley. i got an old-fashioned donut, by which I judge all donuts. It was good, but come on. Deep fried dough covered in sugar water? What is not to like?  my husband likes the iced coffee here because you get to add your own flavored syrups - i think it's too watered down for my personal taste (but I really like extra strong iced coffee like vietnamese coffee)."}
{"text":"My wife thinks the donuts here are too sweet.  She may be right, but she also ate a donut covered in Oreo cookies.  Go figure.  Regular glazed were very soft and fluffy - a perfect donut texture and a notch above Dunkin in my opinion. The red velvet was different, but in a good way.  Only real complaint I had was that the maple-bacon didn't really have much maple flavor.  Make sure you go into the store early.  I arrived just after 10 AM on Sunday and they were nearly cleaned out.  A steady stream of people kept coming in, filling up boxes and not just a couple donuts at a time."}
{"text":"By far, hands down best donuts in the valley. I started going here 15 years ago with my dad on the way in to school/work in the morning. Now I'm bringing my kids in on the way to school and work. I've always been an original maple long John guy, but everything is good. The cronut (croissant/donut) is spectacular! And the ladies working are always so sweet and helpful."}
{"text":"So glad I got to stop today customer service is great donuts were amazing so many to choose from. Definitely new donut stop!"}
{"text":"Excellent doughnuts. They are baked fresh every morning and the staff is very helpful and friendly. They have reasonable prices. I have been in the drive thru and walked inside. Fast , friendly service and clean establishment. I highly recommend this business."}
{"text":"Love these Donuts Always fresh and always good. This place has consistently great Donuts and good prices. This place is in my top 2 best places to get donuts in phoenix!"}
{"text":"Best donuts ever. Huge selection. Huge donuts. Try the cinnamon twist, amazing. They also have a drive through."}
{"text":"Sooo good! The donuts are always incredibly fresh and delicious. My favorite is the Old Fashioned. Craggy, crispy outside, soft inside. Oh my goodness. These are among the best I've had. The coffee is pretty tasty, too, especially compared to what I expected. It's robust and flavorful. The staff is friendly and efficient and of course, who can beat the price of $5 or less for breakfast? Try it! You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Good 'ol simple donut shop. They have a good assortment of donuts. They were very fresh too!"}
{"text":"Oh golly where do I start! This is my go to for doughnuts so light and flavorful! The coffee here is fantastic. The staff is so friendly. I will always be going here!"}
{"text":"When I saw that they were opening a rainbow donuts at 64th St. and Bell Rd, II was so excited and couldn't wait for them to open. This is hands-down the best donut place ever. I have to bring donuts in to the office for meetings and always use Dunkin' Donuts or another donut shop close to the office in Tempe. One morning I stopped at rainbow donuts and ordered a dozen for the meeting. I must've had a comment from every single person saying how amazing the donuts were and asked me where I went this time to get them. Go try them out for yourselves you will not be disappointed. The owner and staff are so friendly too."}
{"text":"Oh good, I'm a regular at a donut shop. I'm a pair of sweat pants, a NASCAR Snuggie and 11 cats away from spinsterhood.  Anyway, these are some pretty awesome donuts. If you're looking for doughnuts, you can take your extra consonants and vowel somewhere else, my friend. If you bring these to work, you may get a raise.  Apple fritters, cake donuts, glazed, jelly-filled... good stuff. But get there early because they're only open until 3pm during the week and on Saturday and 2pm on Sundays. Some weekdays, they are closed a bit earlier than 3pm (as I have had the misfortune of learning first hand)."}
{"text":"Okay I have just started this yelp thing and found rainbow donuts because of other yelpsters.  This place is awesome.  Delicious light donuts melts in your mouth.  They gave me a warm foot long twist to welcome me.  Worth the journey!"}
{"text":"Delicious donuts. Great variety. You must get there early in the morning to be able to choose from all their varieties. They just melt in your mouth."}
{"text":"I became such a regular here  that once, upon ordering at the drive-thru window and discovering I had forgotten my wallet, the woman who works the window told me to just pay her the next time I came there (we visited every Saturday). Yes, the people who run the place are really that nice."}
{"text":"Good donuts, definitely not the best donuts around. They hit the spot in the morning for sure!  stay away from the coffee, it's wack"}
{"text":"Phenomenal!!!!! And doesn't leave that filmy later on your tongue. I would highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"The best maple bacon donut anyone in the world could ask for. Even when they're out sometimes he'll go make you one. It is so good! People are always super nice and everything is fresh"}
{"text":"Such delicious donuts!!! Not extremely impressed with the staff or drinks though! Maybe stick to regular coffee!"}
{"text":"Great selection of original flavors.  Lemon Raspberry was being sampled...we bought one. Delicious."}
{"text":"Thursday, 5:45am.  If it is a weekday and you are looking for that special donut, then skip this place. Nothing special about it. They had your regular not fancy donuts.   I went to Original Rainbow to get three breakfast sandwiches before I headed out of town. When I asked for them...you would of thought I asked for three gold bars. They had nothing.   So I ended up walking out with nothing, took the 5 minute drive to the Rainbow Donut and Cafe and they were able to help me.   Very disappointed. I really wanted to give them my $$ and my business."}
{"text":"This is a nice little donut shop. The owner was really nice, and took time out to answer my questions. I came in around 4pm, most of the deluxe donuts were gone so I just got a glazed donut. The true test. If they can make a good glazed donut, they can make a good donut. Verdict? It passed!!! Very fluffy and moist. Still tasted fresh. I will definitely come back to try more donuts."}
{"text":"Holy smokes these donuts are amazing the cronut was amazing. They have so many choices here that you can find one you will love.  Thai iced tea was really good also. They also have a drive thru if you really want to be a fat ass and not be seen."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to stop by after a long day of work. Great variety of donuts to choose from. Also, I like their coffe and friendly employees. They're the best!"}
{"text":"Would have given 5 stars if the review was based on the donuts. However, we arrived at the shop at 3:45am and then waited until 4:15am for the first cashier to arrive and open the door. Granted she was nice and she apologized but time is money and a discount or a coupon for a future visit would have been nice."}
{"text":"OMG!  Who knew I would find the best croissant I've had in town in this little joint in sketchville I've driven past a hundred times?  To die for ham and cheese croissants!  They make good old fashioned buttermilk bars too which are great...and awesome cherry fritters.  They also have a take out window. They have bottles of different Torani syrups where the napkins and cream are so you can flavor your latte yourself. But get there early on the weekend.  They sell out fast!  and their baker's dozens have 14 donuts in them.  These donuts put Dunkin's to shame..."}
{"text":"We recently moved from Southern California to Scottsdale and one of the things we missed was the local donut shop. This place helps replace that! Everything was fresh and fluffy. They had some unique fancy donuts with special toppings along with the donut shop staples. Also, boba! We will be back."}
{"text":"I was nervous about going to this place because of how it looks from outside. After reading the review I decided to go and I am glad I did because the donuts were SO good I will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"This is the real deal for donuts and pastries. Made fresh daily and served warm early in the morning. If you get a craving for a donut at night you'll be able to satisfy it with Rainbow Donuts because they stay open until 9 PM.   Their staff is super friendly and always serves you a fresh doughnut and a cup of coffee with a smile.  The franchise chains maybe more well known, but this place proves there is a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow and it's filled with donuts."}
{"text":"They melt in your mouth, not in your hand!! OMGSH  these donuts are sooooooo delicious, I don't really care for sweets but OH brother! This place is trouble for me, the dough they make they donuts with is so good, I don't know what they are putting in it, but man, it's addicting! The Thai tea is always really good, I like it because it's not too sweet! Friday's they do special donuts if you make it in the morning!!!! Try this place out if you like donuts, or even if you don't, they might change your mind!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Finally have a donut shop close to us!! We used to live by their original location and that's how we knew about them. We ended up moving and would drive out there to get donuts some times. They have some pretty crazy donuts with strawberries and cream. Pretty much a meal!   Great small family owned business with good service. It won't be long until this place becomes known in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"A couple months ago I added some cronuts to a box on the way to work.  Everyone freaked out over the cronuts but I never got one.  (Honestly, the place cleared out and everyone was gathered together in a corner gulping down huge bites of cronut and loudly commenting how good they were in between bites.)  Got another box with cronuts a couple weeks later and was everyone's best friend again...but none for me (sniff).  Bought my own cronut last week, and found out why everyone freaked out!    So go to Rainbow Donuts, get yourself a cronut (they only cost a little extra), and I recommend a red velvet donut, too!"}
{"text":"Oh my gosh. Best donuts!!!! I tried Bosa donuts and those were terrible. Krispy Kreme has been my main donut. But forget Krispy! Rainbow donuts is my new main donut place. So many flavors. SO CHEAP. The guy even gave me extra donuts for free. UH YES?!?!   I will be back. To bad they close so early."}
{"text":"Came here with my husband. We LOVE donuts. The buttermilk donut was just okay, I've had better. It was a little too crunchy for me. The center was nice and moist, but the edges seemed dry to me. The maple bar was to die for. Tasted really fresh like it had just been made. The icing was nice and sweet but not too sweet. I would come back again, but mainly for the maple bar."}
{"text":"I have read the reviews on this place a few times and driven by a few times. Unfortunately the diet/lifestyle i follow really limits as to when/what/where I can eat. Their hours don't really work with my weekly planned cheat meals and I refuse to get takeout and put it in my fridge and possible ruin a perfect *insert random food here.*  Well Christmas morning I decided that today was the day that I was going to allow myself some room to grow ;)  I woke up and hiked squaw peak.. drooling and thinking about the donut I was going to get afterward. I was smart enough to ensure they would be open. They were open Christmas day from 4am-2pm which is worthy of an extra star right there.  I walked in and knew right away I had entered a happy place. The display cases were filled with amazing looking treats. I was literally SLAPPED in the face with that fresh baked donut smell.  I picked out the following: glazed blueberry buttermilk glazed buttermilk old fashion maple bar that had been sliced down the middle and filled with some of the richest whipped cream I have ever had.  I cut them all into 3's and sadly had to discard the extra. There is a line between treating yourself and killing yourself.  THEY WERE STILL WARM! they were amazing.. they, unlike most things that I drool over for months then finally get, lived up to what my brain expected.  The girl behind the counter was so very nice. She put up with me asking what everything was and being very indecisive. After finding out that anything left over is trashed at the end of the day I had to ask what time they get there to make them fresh. I guess they have a bigger selection on weekends and the crew comes in at 10pm to open at 4am to give us these amazing treats. On the weekdays they get in at midnight.  Next time you feel like treating yourself to a sugar rush this place is worth the visit. Always support the local guys when you can!  I should have taken pictures and noted prices but I was so excited I couldn't help myself. I'll try and do better on my next review :)  PS.. Please start making a blueberry buttermilk bar :)"}
{"text":"This place has the best donuts in the valley. I grew in Southern Cali and there are an abundance of locally owned shops there. It is a struggle to find a good quality donut shop around here. They are few and far between. I don't like DD and KK is played out. I was heading in that direction and decided to give it a try. These are the best donuts I have found in the valley. The prices are great as is the selection. I like that they have a drive thru, which make it very convenient and fast. The Apple Fritter was crispy and delicious. The maple bar is soft and the maple icing is soooo good. You can tell these are fresh donuts as they are soft and fresh. These are so good that I would get up early on the weekend just to go there and get the best selection before the rush came and obliterated them. Love it!!!"}
{"text":"I used to come here all the time when I went to high school, I actually went to school w the owners daughter! But anyways, before my dad passed away, THIS WAS ALWAYS THE SPOT WE'D BE AT. Lol, late for school? Oh well, let's go to Rainbow and get donuts since you're late anyways. No school? Oh let's go to Rainbow! My dad always took me here when he had the chance. Their donuts are so fresh! They make them on the daily, no disappointment whatsoever!! Such a sweet staff (: I love it here, 1 of these days I'll go back in.. I miss having these donuts"}
{"text":"I'M OBSESSED WITH  THESE DONUTS. I want to shout it over rooftops! :) They are the best damn doughnuts that I have ever had in my entire life. Enough said."}
{"text":"Update. Just tried them again a couple of the doubts still not done all the way.    Quick friendly service but when we got home found that a. Few of our donuts were still raw dough in the middle.   I'll write this off to them being brand new location and try then next weekend.  The donuts that were done were very good"}
{"text":"Why donut shops in KY haven't learned the appropriate hours to stay open is beyond me. This shop stays open until 6 PM. There's none of that closing mid-day when everyone is at work nonsense here!  Since we were only in ABQ for a day or two, I didn't get to thoroughly enjoy Rebel Donuts this time around. It wasn't until one of the last days in Phoenix that a light bulb came on telling me to check for nearby donut shops.   I love donuts but I'm not going to travel way out of the way to obtain them. Luckily this shop was less than half a mile away! When I checked their Yelp page and saw a long donut with chocolate, whipped cream, and strawberries on top.. that settled it. I had to visit!  Could I have ordered the only strawberry donut they had left and been satisfied? Well... I could've but I needed more! I ended up ordering a dozen. I wanted a few of them but I also wanted to get some for the rest of the group back at the hotel.   People like different donuts so I couldn't just ask for 4 of these and 4 of those. I went through the selection in front of me, \"I need two of those. Two of those. Two of those.\" I'm so appreciative that the lady taking my order was patient with me. It also helped that the lady that came in behind us was friendly too. While I was in donut heaven, Kathy started talking to that lady behind us(As Kathys do).   If you need to fill your donut craving, visit this shop. Even visiting with around one hour until closing time, they still had a decent selection. All the donuts I tried were fresh and tasty."}
{"text":"I took my boys here after they closed our local Dunkin Donuts and had high expectations due to all the positive reviews, and they lived up to them! We've had the creme brûlée (my favorite), Oreo, cinnamon sugar, glazed cronut, marshmallow glazed gummy bear (my 11 yr old loved it), maple bacon, and strawberries and cream long john - and they were all delicious and well worth the slightly higher cost than your standard donut chain. This is now a weekly treat and I'd recommend them to anyone."}
{"text":"Excellent quality, friendly staff, and reasonable pricing. Will certainly be back."}
{"text":"On vacation in Phoenix one evening, the fella had a hankering for some donuts before our vacation ended. After a Yelp search, we found the Original Rainbow Donuts AND discovered that it was only about a mile from our hotel! Perfect!  So we made plans to visit the next day. After a longer-than-expected hike in the early afternoon, we stopped in at ORD about an hour and a half before they closed. They are open rather late for a donut shop, which I am supremely pleased about! I was a little worried that pickings would be slim and perhaps not the freshest, so late in the day. But you know what....we were not disappointed by the selection!  Late in the afternoon, there was still a good variety of different options to choose from. We each got a several, and the fella actually got a full dozen for variety's sake, as well as to provide us breakfast the next morning and have donuts to share with the rest of our group back at the hotel. And even though we were there around 4:30pm, the donuts still tasted pretty fresh. They were just as tasty the next morning, too!  The space isn't fancy, and it is a get-it-and-go kind of place. The woman working when we were there was very patient with us as we made all our VIDDs (you know, Very Important Donut Decisions) and the lady who came in behind us and had to wait for us to finish up was also friendly and patient.   If I am ever back in Phoenix, I will absolutely make it back here for a delicious treat!"}
{"text":"The word is out - you gotta go to Rainbow on Bell if you want the BEST donut in town. Stopped by on Sunday morning and the line was out the door. The store is tiny and needs a little more room.  Great variety of donuts - with all the classics and many unique specialty donuts available. Good service.  We will be by regularly. If you try one, you'll be back for many!"}
{"text":"They are the best in Arizona. These donuts are done right, fluffy, and not too sweet. Rainbow is only 2 or so miles from my current residency and so I went in, ordered a dozen, a mean cup of coffee and left. I sat in my car and ate 1 chocolate with sprinkles donut [a classic] and enjoyed it with that wonderful cup of coffee. They will most definitely be seeing me again within my last couple of weeks here in Phoenix."}
{"text":"My son and I just stopped in today for the first time and we will defiantly be back! The best donuts we have had and the service was very friendly!"}
{"text":"I love Rainbow Donuts!  Been coming in here for donuts for the last couple years and always have a wonderful experience and the iced coffee is really yummy too! :)"}
{"text":"Pros - Good donuts, gave me extra donuts  Cons - Closed before the time indicated in the store hours posting, employee/owner made me order from the drive through window, only had glazed donuts left  It was really odd to have to walk up to the drive up window in order to buy donuts.  The only reason why I'd go back is because it's closer than the nearest Dunkin' Donuts."}
{"text":"best donughts in az. bosa aint got nuthin on these guys. theyve also got pretty good breakfast burritos too. Service is always top notch and the ladies behind the counter really are the best. always so happy and upbeat even at 530a"}
{"text":"Freshly made!  Yes-the original.  If I am on a sugar binge- I satisfy my fix with their yeasty, filling donuts.  I don't have a fave- I just cruise the case and let my tummy do the picking!"}
{"text":"OMG, the best and certainly a better value than at those big chain shops!  I drove a couple miles out of my way to try these...I would do it again, and again !!!"}
{"text":"The BEST donuts EVER!! They are so fresh, fluffy and a vast assortment. The staff is wonderful!"}
{"text":"Yum...great selection. Ordered 1/2 dozen, self control, and so far two were terrific. Surprising selection of red velvet donuts, I counted at least three but there could have been more...and I'm not complaining.  Was empty when I went in but getting busy when I left (9:30a on a Sunday) I'll be back"}
{"text":"I had a hankering for donuts and decided to trek over to the original rainbow donuts to satiate this craving. I was not disappointed. This was a good old fashioned donut shop that definitely had some fun flavors going on. We got a huge sampling of donuts to feed our family and everything was delicious, there wasn't anything that people did not love. What is best of all is it was all very reasonable too. I wish I had a place like this near me."}
{"text":"One of the best donut shops in the valley. I live very close and have been here many times. The quality is always consistent. Prices are great. The selection definitely diminishes as the day goes by...but of all the times I've been here, there has never been a line. Maybe one or two patrons sitting down. My favorites are the maple bars and the cake donuts are amazing too (and I never used to like these much!) I've heard ravings about the croissants but I haven't tried these...yet.  Update: Went back for a croissant on a Sunday to try it for the first time. They were OUT before 9am AND there was a line. If you go on Sundays, just beware they will likely be out of your favorite items."}
{"text":"My daughter and her friend walked up to get some donuts this morning and were not disappointed.  The donut selection was great, the prices were good and the taste was amazing!!!   Great addition to the neighborhood!!!"}
