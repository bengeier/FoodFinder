{"text":"We stumbled upon this place when the brewery we came for was completely packed. What a great find! The menu is mostly sandwiches, but they have a large variety and a lot of interesting options. I had the Philly cheesesteak and it was one of the best I had ever had. They put their house-made beer cheese on it and it was just amazing. The fries were great too. Good beer selection and lots of TVs with different sports events on. Service was a little slow, but good other than that (and in fairness to them, it was pretty busy). I recommend a visit if you're in that part of Charlotte!"}
{"text":"\"Consistently good bar food.\"  That seems to be the theme of most reviews here, and I agree.  I am hardly a NoDa regular, but this is what I would expect -- no, what I would *hope* -- to find in NoDa.  The interior matches the exterior and the neighborhood -- a little run-down, maybe even shabby, but totally okay with who/what it is."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place in noda. Cheap food and the best cheese fries."}
{"text":"Love this place!!  It kinda makes you feel like you're back home in your small town that you grew up in."}
{"text":"The new manager sucks even worst than the previous one! This idiot rather listen to commercials of his stupid game than music paid for on their boom box!!! not even offered a refund!!!
Not coming back until this idiot no longer works here!!!"}
{"text":"Been here twice, ordered wings the first time and they were undercooked so ordered another dozen. So we ordered a new dozen and just thought maybe it was a bad batch or the cook made an error. Went last night and order wings again thinking they were going to be just like the second dozen from the last week but i was wrong. This time the wings were as small as my pinky. Spoke to the manager and he said thats all we got. No apologize at all. Explained my experience the week before and really didnt care and stated i wanted to argue just to argue. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Ok - after making the mistake of having lunch at Revolution - see earlier review about small portions, we walked across the street and entered beer heaven - also order zucchini appetizer - large portion and wonderful ranch dipping sauce.  Beer cold and never empty - outside deck a definite go to place for warmer days."}
{"text":"I love this place any time I get to come here when I visit charlotte its the highlight of my trip. 

However, todays visit was pretty sad when compared to any other time I've come here. 

My setup of three ordered food and waited for over an hour with almost no visits from out waitress to check if we needed anything or even explain when our food should be out. My blackened chicken wrap came out so cold I honestly believe it was sitting the fridge waiting for my fries to be made. 

What a pathetic experience on all accounts. 

I don't forsee myself recommending solstice anymore or even visiting."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time and I was pleased with the fast service. The patio area was nice and spacious. My chicken wrap was flavorful and I was impressed with their mac-n-cheese. I would go again."}
{"text":"My favorite spot in Charlotre. Love to stop here after work on Friday and sit at the bar on the back patio for dinner and some drinks. They have great comfort foods and you can have a healthy meal too."}
{"text":"Crap! Worst Sunday brunch experience! Waited an hour for food that never made it to the table before paying for our drinks and walking out. Never done this at a restaurant before, but working at a restaurant, I know it doesn't take that long to make eggs! Never had a bad experience here before but I know I'll never return for brunch again..."}
{"text":"This place is as amazing a tavern as you will find in Charlotte. A variety of people in the crowd from young professionals, to college students, to the older crowd; and all of the dynamics mesh wonderfully.  The servers are on point and the beer selection is enough to keep it fresh but not so much as to be overwhelming.  While the food is hit and miss, it still gets 5 stars for it's amazing atmosphere and superb customer service.  Also, trivia with Carlos on Wednesday nights is an absolute blast!"}
{"text":"Love this place, love the staff. Food is good, GREAT Jack on the rocks. My girlfriend and I go there fairly often usually in the afternoon when there aren't many people there but the staff is entertaining and usually the couple people that are there are friendly."}
{"text":"Honestly, I went here solely for the Big Buck Hunter video game. Im pretty sure its one of the only bars in Charlotte that has Buck Hunter. It makes sense, being its the only Packers bar, it would have the only midwest game in town.
I tried to come here before but it was packed, but if there was even an open table id sit there. The back patio is awesome and there's another bar back there too.
Food is cheap and delicious. Our bartender was nice and fast, and the tables were well staffed.

My only complaint is the creepy transients from the bus stop come in getting change for the bus. It distracts the employees and the bar is obviously not making any money on the transaction. They need to not do this, its really yucky having a skeezy meth head breathing down your back as he takes literally two minutes of the only bartenders time trying to, then failing to explain how he needed his bus change. Gross gross gross."}
{"text":"I desperately wish I could give this place zero stars. My boyfriend and I just came from lunch here, and it was the worst restaurant experience we've ever had. We came at 12:00 (Tuesday), had our drink orders quickly taken and were handed menus. Shortly after, my boyfriend ordered the buffalo chicken wrap after spying a fresh looking photo of it on the menu and I ordered the caprese flatbread. There were five other tables, one waitress, the owner, and what seemed to be one cook. We waited for no less than an hour for our food.

As the two staffers flew around the restaurant, they occasionally waved in our direction and said \"sorry for the wait,\" but never stopped to apologize or offer any earnest words. We never received a refill, and we noted that the ketchup bottle was empty even though it was only 12:00 when we sat down, and there's no way someone used all the ketchup before 12. When the food finally came, it was... what to say... completely bland. My boyfriend's wrap looked nothing like the photo, and he said it had no taste other than overwhelming blue cheese. My flatbread was equally bland.

We set down payment early, knowing it could be a long time until we got to pay. We were never asked if we wanted a box (we didn't), whether we enjoyed our food, no effort to comp anything for our wait (we in no way expected anything to be comped, but some sort of apology would have been much appreciated). Needless to say, we'll never return and will caution others in the future."}
{"text":"The food's nothing special, but the game's always on and the beer's always cold. In short, everything a sports bar needs to be."}
{"text":"Service was horrible for such a slow Tuesday night. I've been to Solstice only a couple of times since my group of coworkers like the place so I haven't really complained. But the last time I went with my coworkers was probably the last time I will ever go! Our server Casey R was not attentive. I've been a server for over 10 years so I understand the industry/life. The only reason I knew her name was because it was on the receipt. I spent over $50 at this place to have a good time and enjoy the company of my friends. I had to go up to the bar to get drinks for my friends and I since she never came back to the table to check on us after we got our first round of drinks. I'm assuming what was a manager came over to talk to us and let us know that she might have been busy outside, that he was sorry. I went outside to smoke a cigarette and nothing was going on outside. Max of 3 tables outside and we were the only party table inside alongside people at the bar and another 2 top. To top off the experience, she applied auto-gratuity to all of out checks because we were considered a party table. I was not happy about that. I paid my bill and immediately left."}
{"text":"This is a bar, there is no disguising the fact that it isn't one. They don't try to claim to be anything other than a bar, but if they did they'd fail. 

The prices per drink are cheap [$4 for a pint of Fat Tire] and the bar service is prompt. 

The atmosphere: I really liked the outdoor area, despite the empty bar area in the back. Indoors, on a Friday night its crowded, and its loud. I couldn't get a good read on the people about how social it was. 

The feeling I got from this bar was that it didn't have a lot of life to it, nor did it encourage each other to be hostile to each other. This is not necessarily a bad thing. 
It is what it is. From appearances, the clients look as if they could either pass as rednecks or hipsters. [But without the attitude of either] 

Overall: Has potential to be a lot more social with a different layout, and the clients aren't horrible."}
{"text":"This place really disappointed me.  I ordered a wrap, with no tomato, and they gave it to me with no tomato but with also no wrap! It came like a salad.  The server did try to fix it but I was starving, I wanted to eat, we had already waited 30 min for the food.  I did ask for extra dressing, that never came.  Mashed potatoes were my side and they tasted like they had been reheated and served everyday this week. So gross, I am so turned off by this place. My salad/wrap was not good either and I left most my food on plate.  The server took it away and did nothing.  It was clear that I was disappointed, very clear.  I ended up paying for it and leaving.  I will never recommend this place and go out of my way to let other people know."}
{"text":"The Solstice Tavern is by far my all-time favorite spot in NoDa.  You get lots of eclectic, intelligent people as far as who is in the crowd and the servers are always friendly.  I have yet to have a bad experience here.  The bartenders are always responsive and they have some good bar grub.  I love just a plain ole Grilled Cheese and some pasta salad.  Good bar food no doubt!  This place is a winner and I will always come back."}
{"text":"I've been here several times. For a venue, it's pretty decent overall, fun to chill at and the bartenders are pretty damn good at their job.

This rating is for one thing in particular, and that is their French dip sandwiches.  I'm no food critic of any kind, but whatever went into their aux jus was the most gag inducing thing I have ever tried.  It has honestly been on my mind the past three days I had to write my first review just for how bad it was. I cannot emphasize how easy it is to make aux jus, but it was like somebody went on a spree adding Dead Sea water to the mix.  

On a positive note, their Philly cheesesteak flat bread and fried pickles are damn good."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place because I've heard a lot of good things. I ordered the soup of the day, which was chicken noodle.  It tasted like overly salted beef broth with some tough noodles and a shred of chicken thrown in.  Blah.  I know this is more of a bar food type of place, but it was so gross. The commercial radio was also really obnoxious, and the bloody UFC match playing on every television was really unappetizing.  Pros: Service was friendly and fast."}
{"text":"Went here with friends after walking around Noda.  It took 2 hours to get our food. If you're in for mediocre bar food and a long wait, this place is for you! Will not be going back."}
{"text":"I don't know how I went five years in Charlotte without going here but it may be my new true love! The inside area smelled like stale beer, frat boys and broken dreams but once I strutted through there onto the patio area, I was in seventh heaven. I've never heard anything about them having a patio area so it was a pleasant surprise to find they have a huge area complete with a numerous amount of tables, corn hole and a variety of people, not just your standard NoDa crowd. I will be back fo sho!"}
{"text":"I'd heard many good things about this bar so I decided to check it out. The staff is decent, nothing great about them, but nothing bad either. It's the patrons who make this place unpleasant. I would give 1-star for the atmosphere and 3 for the service because the bartender was chill. Solstice is your average little dive bar. The reason I am giving such a low rating is because my date and I were harassed by two older patrons. We are young- 21 and 22, but are both young professionals and mature for our ages. But still, I guess the babyface still showed. First, a pretentious 30-something year old greaseball artist-type came up to us and said \"I'm much older but blah blah blah,\" then proceeded to tell me I look 12. When my date kindly asked him to leave us alone, he took offense and started whining to us about how WE offended him. The last straw was when a similarly pretentious lady around the same age came up to us and insulted my date. The bartender turned a blind eye (but I didn't expect him to do anything.) We then left and ended up at NoDa Brewing Company down the street and had a positive experience there.

Just heed caution if you're not a regular. The yuppies will eat you alive."}
{"text":"First time here and the service definitely needs improvement. The only reason I can give it one star is soley based on the wings and drinks alone. What I didn't know is that I would be charged an extra dollar for a mixer in my shot. It took us more than an hr to get 6 wings for each person (there were only three of us). Needless to say we won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Decent sports bar with a solid BLT. Be careful with the pasta salad- it'll give you serious onion breath. They have a wide variety of wraps, burgers and sammiches. I went for lunch and was trying to be respectable so
I didn't sample a beer but I may in the future, since other reviewers seem to have been impressed by their selection. The place was pretty chill, I guess its not a big lunch spot (though a troop of firemen from down the street came in to eat, yowza!) Service was considerate without being smothery. I'll have to avoid football time though. Noooot a packers fan."}
{"text":"I ordered 2 dozen wings after reading all these good reviews on their food. We were sooooooo disappointed once we got them. The wings weren't crispy at all like I asked and it was under seasoned as well as lacking sauce. It was like eating plain chicken, it was so disgusting that my husband shortly threw it up. Not to mention, the woman who answered the phone hung up on me TWICE because SHE couldn't hear me over their loud background. The owners really should rethink the whole phone ordering idea because I had to yell my order and she still messed it up. Fuck this place, never again."}
{"text":"The sides could have been home made or hand cut. Burger was good. The buns could be improved."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere.  Friendly and attentive service.  Good food and menu.  I have only been for lunch but it was great.  I can imagine it is good for night life as well.  Great area.  Nice patio and outdoor seating/bar.  Apparently, pets are allowed on the patio.  Pretty cool."}
{"text":"I got there around 3:30 pm a lot people were just drinking hanging out enjoying the weather.. I ordered wings and tater tots To go, simple right? I don't understand why I waited almost 45 minutes for food.. Service was so slow and there was maybe only 2 other tables eating.. Also the staff wasn't the friendliest.. The wings and tots itself was ok.. Nothing i would rave about"}
{"text":"Had the Italian Sandwich with tots! Incredible, great place for lunch, and by the looks of it, great place for drinks at night. I'll definitely come back here next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"I always love making Solstice a stop at the end of the night when crawling around the Noda area. The inside is comfortable and not too much slanted towards sports bar or restaurant. Just a nice blend of everything. The outside patio is spacious and a great place to chill out, weather permitting. I just wish they hadn't gotten rid of the foosball table but I guess it was kind of in the way. Anyways, the food here has alway been decent type bar food but I don't know what they have done in the past few months but it has really taken a step up. The apps we had (Mini corndogs and Solstice Sundials) were amazing. The prices on all of their menu items are very affordable so it can be a pretty cheap night out as well. I also had a buffalo chicken sandwich and it was cooked to perfection. I'm not sure what they did with the bun but it was extra flavorful this go round. I hope they keep up all the good work as the food is really a great value."}
{"text":"Pretty solid digs here! 

I went after work with my very lovely co-workers for some beer, gossip and a bite to eat.

Lucky for us, they have tons of beer specials! Always a good thing. 

Listen....they have some of the best pumpkin beer I've ever had! And I'm normally not a fan if pumpkin beer! But they dip the rim with cinnamon and sugar and it just tastes like YUMMY in your mouth! If they have it on tap I definitely recommend getting it. 

Wednesday night's special was a chimichanga with beef coated in cheese with salsa. I added a side of tater tots for good measure and it made for a great meal. Nothing fancy, but it definitely did the job! 

If your out and about in NoDa...drop in and grab a beer...if you don't sit in the huge patio there's an excellent booth by the door with a huge window! (Makes for some very good people watching)"}
{"text":"Cool spot, chill neighborhood, but nothing special.  Decent food."}
{"text":"My favorite spot in Charlotte! The best chicken tenders ever! Fries aren't the best though, get the tator tots.... the fries all over Charlotte seem to be like cardboard with \"Cajun\" seasoned salt... very friendly staff and welcoming environment. Full bar, multiple tvs with different games/events on at all times and daily specials..... they also have a late night menu... the outside area has a seperate bar and lighting theme, i definitely recommend stopping in if you are in Charlotte/NoDA area.."}
{"text":"A pretty cool sports bar in the NoDa neighborhood. The food was typical bar food. But it was good and I dont have any complaints. We sat and watched some football on a football Sunday. The patio was open so we decided to take a seat outside. 

Outside there are lots of tv's so we had our pick of tv to watch which ever football game that we wanted to. You have a pooch? He's welcome here!. There were a couple little furry companions outside on the patio soaking up the sun as well. 

They have some good weekly specials that I saw on the menu."}
{"text":"As a weekend tourist in Charlotte, in the twenty minutes I was standing outside waiting for a bus back downtown I saw eight or ten young, hip looking people going in here and they were playing decent music, probably from a juke box.  Through the hexagonal porthole windows you can also see a foosball table.  The next time I'm in town I'll take time to check out more of this interesting looking neighborhood bar than just the sidewalk."}
{"text":"The only good things I can say about this bar are: Big Buck Hunter and $4 tall boy PBRs. 

The lighting is poor; it's way too bright for a bar. And the music was way too loud, since people there seemed to just want to sit and talk. The combination of bright lighting and loud music is a confusing signal to send. I think they were just broadcasting a local radio station, too. Whaaaat?? Invest in Spotify premium as a business or at the very least have the bartenders bring in an iTunes playlist. I don't want to hear radio advertisements in a bar. 

It was evident from the start that our server did not want to be there. 

I will not be going back unless, for some reason, I end up black out drunk and have the strongest urge to shoot things with a plastic orange shot gun."}
{"text":"This was our last stop on our Noda pub crawl of 6/30/12.  We sat at a table since a few people in our group were in the mood for a late night snack.  Generic beer selection at best, so I went with my fail safe Newcastle.  Food that was ordered by other people looked ok at best and the worst service of the evening by far.  It was getting late in the evening and maybe the staff was slowing down at the end of the night.  Solstice would not be my first choice for hanging out in NoDa, but I would consider giving them another try in the future."}
{"text":"Good selection of beers, very chil atmosphere, and great food. I've had dreams about their quasadilla, and it's definitely something I'd go back for. The service is slow, but friendly. If you are in the mood to just hang out with some friends, and enjoy and nice casual place, this is your digs. Food is better then the neer selection, better places to go for drinks. But food is great, and atmosphere is fun."}
{"text":"Looking for a casual, laid back place to drink or have a bite to eat? Solstice in No Da has your back.

Like the other reviewers, the prize jewel is their outdoor patio. I like coming here on Spring days or Summer nights to enjoy people watching & having a bite to eat.

Yes, they serve your typical bar food, but their pride is their sandwiches...so many to choose from.  I normally go with the Brevard BLT with tater tots. The tater tots are always cooked crispy & brown. Yum."}
{"text":"I think the service could have been better and a little friendlier. I didn't really like my nachos, but my husband enjoyed his turkey sandwich, which I thought was good too. The patio was a nice lunch spot and we brought our dog."}
{"text":"Never! Never! Took 40mins for apps to come out and manager was so rude!"}
{"text":"Had a chance to go to this local watering-hole in the heart of NODA this past Friday night to celebrate a friend's upcoming birthday...

Patio:  The spacious outdoor patio area is awesome.  They had a full bar out there with a very efficient and friendly bar-tender slinging drinks throughout the night.  They had plenty of beer, shot and liquor specials to choose from as well.  They also have plenty of screens outside, so if you're looking to catch a game and have a few cocktails outside - Solstice has all your bases covered.  

Music:  There was a DJ playing a wide variety of music.  But I note the DJ bc not only was he playing all the Prince you could ask for (RIP Purple One), but he was also taking requests from patrons for whatever they wanted to hear.  

Parking:  If you are familiar with the NODA area then you already know parking is limited.  In fact I don't believe there is any parking designated solely for Solstice's patrons.  Figure it out - Uber, taxi, (and eventually light-rail) are your best options. 

Service:  Service is super chill, and friendly - exactly what you would expect from a spot in NODA.  

No complaints what-so-ever and  I'm sure I'll be back soon."}
{"text":"Had the fried chicken club, plus tater tots with bacon/cheese.  Very good, excellent prices, will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Right in the heart of Noda, Solstice is a great place to watch a game, have a drink, or just hang with some friends.  This place has a pretty sizable seating area inside, a a very large fenced in outdoor dining/drinking area, with a covered bar outside as well.  The mood was fun and energetic last night (Thurs night), with the crowd getting busier and busier as the night went on, and the local concerts let out.  My friends and I had a variety of beers and mixed drinks, which I thought were reasonably priced, and the mixed drinks were definitely more liquor than mix, so that was a huge plus in my book!  Overall, a nice place to have a casual drink with some friends when you are in the Noda area :)"}
{"text":"One of my favorite bars in Noda. Decent beer selection, and the food is pretty good but my waitress was better. Hailey was attentive, sweet, and gorgeous. I recommend sitting in her section and tipping her well."}
{"text":"We didn't get any food here, but this was a great choice for a place to watch the game while we were walking around Noda. If I'm back up that way we will definitely check it out."}
{"text":"$2 pints of Guinness is pretty awesome. I hopped in on a Saturday evening to grab a quick bite to eat but stayed for a couple beers.

As a northern-born, non-college guy, it was kind of eye-opening. A group of three brothers (couldn't tell if they were fraternity brothers or genetic brothers) got into a heated argument right next to me. They were talking about honor and stuff. I thought they were actually going to get physical. They were flanked by a gaggle of college girls, complete with tight jeans, high heels, half shirts, and lower back tattoos. A middle aged woman reeking of strong ganja sat on the other side.

The veggie quesadilla was decent but way too greasy."}
{"text":"I decided to treat myself while my wife was out of town. Had dinner here over the weekend. 
Lets start with the good... the beer is cold and priced well, the back porch is fantastic & the staff is friendly. 

The last time I ate here was about 8 months ago and I had one of the best fish sandwiches Ive ever had outside of Seattle. Blackened grouper on a french loaf. It was amazing. I returned because I was craving a good fish sandwich. My waitress advised me the menu had changed (menu changes are not listed on yelp, its more expensive). I found out they no longer have a grouper sandwich, only a 'catfish filet' on texas toast. I decided to chance it and ordered a round of chips and salsa for an appetizer.

The chips were good. the salsa was tasty but was more like pico... just diced tomatoes with a little onion and pepper. it was ok. 

Then there was the sandwich. first, it took forever to make it out of the kitchen... seriously... nearly 45 minutes. When it arrived, the texas toast was a thick'ish cut un-buttered piece of white bread barely crisped. It was cut in half and each side had a wilted piece of lettuce a slice of tomato and literally a two inch square piece of mushy, watery, grey catfish that obviously started its morning in a freezer. It was bland and squishy with almost no taste except for the aioli (spiced mayo) dripping off the bread. It took about three bites to eat half a sandwich. It was accompanied by about a dozen crinkle cut fries coated in seasoned salt.

Im a patient person, but I got there at 6 and didnt get this masterpiece of a sandwich until almost 7:15. I was starving so I sucked it up and ate the sandwich. I mentioned the issue to the waitress who made no offer to do anything but thanked me for my feedback and agreed it was nowhere near the quality they used to have. she said they had been cutting costs and changing the menu. 

My bill came & I was frustrated and in a hurry to get out so I didnt even look at it, I just handed her a card. Mistake. 
The fish sandwich cost $9.75.
The chips and salsa was $5.25
Add in two beers and tip and I paid over $30.00 and took two hours of my evening to be served about four ounces of mushy catfish on white bread. Some treat ehe?"}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong Solstice is first a Tavern then a pub so maybe food is not the main reason to go there. However, if your looking for a great neighborhood vibe with a large outdoor patio and affordable drinks then Solstice is your place.  

A descent selection of local beers but I would say they sell more Bud Light and Miller Light than Jam Session. A broad menu with Apps, Wraps, Sandwiches & Burgers, Solstice' menu has something for everyone. If you torn you cant go wrong with anything fried and they have a lot of fried stuff! We had the Fried Fungus, Fried Squash, and the Pretzel with a cheese dip.  Forget the diet here, the pretzel would have been better with a spicy mustard but the fried squash was pretty good, particularly with a spicy Bloody Mary and Sunday football.

{"text":"Great place in Noda. I recently went to a friend's get together and we eventually ended up here. Large outdoor space with lots of tables. The bartender served the liquor generously and the environment was casual yet young and fun without making me feel like I was the oldest one there, which I probably was. Great place for summer drinks with good company."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere ! Lindsay is a great bartender ! Always a good experience !"}
{"text":"I'm really glad that our Charlotte friends live in NoDa so that we can just walk up the street to all the neighborhood bars.  We've been to Solstice a couple of times now, and it's always been nice enough to enjoy the porch, so I'm not sure what the inside really feels like.  I love the back porch/patio area.  We were able to sit and enjoy the twinkle lights while the others played Cornhole.

There seems to be a good selection of beer, being that they have High Life and Magic Hat No. 9, which is enough to keep me happy, though I wish the High Life was on draft.

Also, their bathroom is decent.  Always a plus for a girl who's stopping at all the bars in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Solstice is just solstice. It's that neighborhood bar that you can always count on to be comfortable and no fuss no muss. The food is good, tator tots are one of my favs. The drinks are great and on my recent visit (a Sunday afternoon) they had mimosas on special $5 for a double $3 for a regular. They were very tasty, and not overdone on the OJ. Nothing worse than paying $5 for a mimosa only to have it be 3/4 orange juice and no champers to be tasted!!

The back deck/patio is really the winner for this place. It's big, has a bar with tv's for games, some outdoor games, and a great place to hang out on any given warm day. It's a very chill spot, as are most places in NoDa. However Solstice has always been on our list any time we go to NoDa. It's our meeting place and where we tend to start when visiting the area for a night out!! Sometimes we start here and forget to move on haha. It's that kind of place!"}
{"text":"We were in with a big group at high top table in the back on a Wednesday after Christmas. These ladies worked their tails off for us and even though the kitchen was slow it was delicious. I would only recommend that the wings be crispier and more well done. We ordered 7 appetizers for the table and drank our fannies off. One server was responsible for the entire room and we were a 7top -she had others with 4,6, and 7 and managed to still make us feel special! The awesome bartender came around and helped too delivering shots and warm greetings! Cheers to the team there for making our post Christmas reunion fun and successful at Solstice. We moved on to karaoke but Solstice warmed our engines. We made sure to take good care of the server and bartender and plan to return soon! Thanks again!"}
{"text":"Great place in noda, went Halloween weekend and had a blast. The service is great even outside and when it was crowded. We shared a couple of appetizers and was impressed with the quality of food. Lets be honest bar food isn't always the greatest. They do have beer specials, which is helpful if you plan on drinking for awhile. My only complaint is the smokers are always outside, even though there is a no smoking sign at the bar."}
{"text":"I like Solstice, but it isn't a standout in an area where there are some FANTASTIC places to eat and drink. It is good in the spring/summer/fall for a drink when you can stand on the patio, otherwise I'd choose Revolution, Dolce or Growlers for a place to drink with friends."}
{"text":"Loved the food, loved the service, the atmosphere was just OK. Why go to a bar if we don't drink? For the food of course! My Wife and Daughter and I try to visit a new place every Saturday for lunch. We try not to repeat some place we have been before. Perusing Yelp for a NoDa location close to a 2 PM apt that we had, I found Solstice Tavern. Reviews looked great, so we gave it a try. Boy are we glad we did. We were a little turned off by the crowd gathered at noon on a Saturday, but we were intruding on their environs, so we adapted. 

We started with Chicken Nacho Grande, and I can honestly say that they were the best nachos I've had in years. The chicken was juicy, the chili was spicy, the cheese wasn't all clumpy, and the chips were crunchy. Why can't every place get these this right? 

My lunch was a Buffalo Chicken Wrap with fries. After the chowfest on the nachos, I had to choose between finishing my wrap or facing hours of excruciating pain dealing with eating way too much. YOLO, so I finished my lunch. The fries were crispy and seasoned well. The wrap was a nice blend of cold cole slaw, spicy chicken, pico de gallo and other fillings. Crunchylicious. My Daughters Sunshine wrap and my Wife's Pub Burger were both equally good. 

As for drinks, my Diet Coke was very good, I didn't ask my girls how their waters tasted. One sure sign of good service? When a new glass of your beverage is brought to you before you finish the original one. Mission accomplished. Lunch with the appetizer was $44 for 3, not too shabby."}
{"text":"As you walk into the bar off of North Davidson Street, your line of vision will give you a straight shot down the inside bar, out the backdoor past the patio bar, and across the sprawling deck fence that is covered in beer signs to the cornhole boards.

The inside is just as dark during the day as it is at night, so you have to adjust your eyes accordingly if you are coming back into the light of day after a few beers.

This is another NoDa bar that has flourished with the no smoking law in North Cackilacky.  It is so much nicer to walk in and not have to coat yourself in Febreze after the fact.

The menu is stereotypical bar fair.  Sandwiches named after local streets, huge piles of nachos, a variety of burgers, cheesesteaks (I refuse to call it a Philly cheesesteak unless I am at least north of the Mason-Dixon Line), and tater tots.  The glorious thing is that the kitchen is open pretty much as long as the bar is open.  So a late night basket of tots can be just the thing to finish out a night of drinking in the hood.

There are close to a dozen television in  the bar, both indoors and out, making it the closest thing to a sports bar in the arts district.  For you gamers, they have a Playstation 3 at the end of the bar so drunk dudes can ooo and ahh as you pop caps in other dudes online playing Modern Warfare.

Your standard internet jukebox cranks out Pandora until someone puts in some tunes.  Its over in the corner with the ATM and requisite Golden Tee and Buck Hunter games.

All this makes it your run of the mill bar.  No frills, nothing mindblowing off the menu, no legendary drink that you can only get there, no over the top theme.  Just a bar.  But every now and again, that is all you need.  A whole lot of not bad..."}
{"text":"I stopped in here for a drink while out with friends and the place was packed. We ended up having to stand which was fine. The atmosphere is just that of a regular bar but they had a great outdoor seating area that looked like it would be great in the summer, it also had another bar out there. It has a lot of tv's and it seemed like a lot of people were watching sports but it wasn't the kind of place that you had to. Hopefully next time we give it a try we can get a table!"}
{"text":"First time customers last night and loved both our server, Jessie (sp?) and the atmosphere. Went with my daughter and her boyfriend. We started with the pretzel and beer cheese, a great choice. I got the Solstice wrap and it was great, 2 local beers and I was happy. My daughter and her bf both got burgers, however, and they were heavily laden with oregano and garlic, to the extent that they tasted like meatballs rather than burgers. So then you have a meatball tasting meat, add in blue cheese and buffalo, and it's an odd combo, and not a pleasing one. Not sure if there was a different chef in the kitchen or if this was the standard, but gotta say I think a burger should taste like a burger and not what these tasted like. So beware the burger choices unless this sounds good to you. Again, other than this, the experience was great and the evening was fun."}
{"text":"So slow. Don't come here if you have any plans for the rest of the night. Been waiting over 30 minutes with no food."}
{"text":"Solstice is just around the corner from me so it's a good place to stop for a quick beer or takeout.  Unfortunately, smoking is allowed inside, so I won't stay very long.  The back patio is nice during the summer.

Food is average, servers are friendly, and the beer is cold. Plenty of TVs to watch the game.

Take out is available.

For a better restaurant, try Crepe Cellar, just down the street."}
{"text":"Ah Solstice you are always a brief stop during bar crawls. But I finally did a full stop one day for lunch here.

I gotta say your outdoor patio is banging. On bar crawl nights, you're a bit too crowded for me to be comfortable, but that's not your fault. Your food is alright, standard sandwiches and stuff. The best part were the tots that came with them, hot and yummy just the way I like them! The sandwich? Oh I forgot about it, maybe next time I'll just order those tots and have at it.

They have the benefit of being one of the few places in NoDa open for lunch, slim pickings around here I tell you what! But instead of slacking they delivered a pretty decent lunch at a pretty decent price. So for that cheers to you Solstice!"}
{"text":"Yesterday a few girls from work ordered from here. A neighborhood staple, we thought ordering 3 wraps would be pretty simple to handle. Unfortunately the girl who picked up our food for us was not the one who ordered it, so she wasn't aware there should have only been 3 orders, so when she got there she paid for the 4 that they had given us. As it was not her money, and the order was wrong, we called the restaurant to see what they could do in order to remedy the situation and it was handled so unprofessionally. Never have I ever experienced a manager who yells at a customer on the phone AND in the restaurant about a simple refund for an order that should never have been placed. 
He stated that we should have been more clear on the phone, although I'm not sure on what planet asking for an opinion between two items is the same as ordering the two items. \"Which one do you think is better\" is not the same thing as ordering both. 
Anyhow, he also stated that by asking for the situation to be fixed, and asking for a refund for the item that should have not been ordered by the server (which we also brought back to the restaurant, as no one had touched it because no one ordered it) that we were trying to \"take advantage of a small business.\"  I know, from being in the industry for 10 years, that they could not resell said item, however, it's always been my experience that the customer is always right (even if they're not) but in the case the mistake was not made on the consumers end. 
I've never experienced such poor customer service, or ill treatment for a simple mistake made on THEIR part, in my life. 
I will not be returning. Fortunately, there are several other great places in the neighborhood to eat and spend my money at."}
{"text":"I really enjoy Solstice.  I always thought it was the kind of place I wouldn't fit in because its in NoDa and I already felt I wasn't \"artsy\" enough to live in NoDa, but that couldn't be further from the truth.

Its a great little bar that now that I like sooo much better with the no smoking law.  It just used to get really smokey and gross in there.  The outdoor area is such a surprise, I wouldn't have imagined that much space back there.  

The food is good, actually I'd say really good.  Grilled cheese cooked to perfection (people mess them up more often than not), tots are always good, wraps, reubens, sundials, all really good bar food.  They have good drink specials, and even if not everything else is definitely priced right."}
{"text":"What can I say about Soltice?

Well... If you've been to our village of NODA, then you've seen this little tavern.  Furthermore, if you've cruised down Davidson on a Friday or Saturday night, then you've had to notice the crowd pouring onto the street.  This is a true testament to the reaction that Solstice is able to elicit from the rest of those in its neighborhood.

My wife and I used live right up the street and absolutely love the quaint atmosphere on a weeknight as well as the potential It possesses for a great social experience on weekends.  The bartenders are personable, tolerant of the sometimes \"eclectic crowd\" which leaks-over from the neighborhood theater, and they're truthful when asked for recommendations.  As someone from Los Angeles, this demeanor is breath of fresh air!  - which is also what you'll find on their spacious patio in the back.  If NC happens to band smoking, at least we'll know that there remains sanctuary behind this colorful watering hole.

Soltice during the day - not too busy unless it's around a meal time.  If you find yourself there during one of these aforementioned times, try the food.  Although they offer most of the traditional stand-by's that any tavern should carry, their menu transcends conventionality in pub fare.  They offer some great wraps, decent salads and a portobello mushroom quesadilla which remains a closet \"vice\" for my wife."}
{"text":"Love coming to Solstice because their outside patio rocks!  They have a fully stocked bar outside with a couple TV's and...cornhole.  Oh, yes.  This bar is located in the heart of NoDa so the crowd is laid back and diverse.  I will say that I'm disappointed that they removed the foosball table.  I, of course, had to get the scoop and apparently people just weren't using it.  Booo.  Drinks are decent and my usual drink of choice (Bacardi and Diet) is the standard price of 6ish dollars.  What I enjoy the most is the chill environment.  What's also nice about this bar is that if you aren't having a great time you can walk right outside and you have plenty of other choices.  Haven't tried the food here - just the booze ;)

Good location, good times!"}
{"text":"I give Solstice Tavern Four Stars...

They got a star as a bump up because on three occasions when I had groups meet me, they came through and accommodated us without any issue and did it with smiles and grace.

The lunch is pretty decently priced.  I have found the food to be consistent.  All sorts of things go on in the backyard, and I have not really ventured out there to figure out what those people are doing.  My brother loves this place.  Being from New York, I don't find the neighborhood to be as amazing and trendy as my local family members, but when I am in NODA, Solstice is a pretty safe and consistent sports bar."}
{"text":"Cute spot for a group of friends just wanting to hang out and have a good tine.  Right in the art district of Charlotte.   In door and out door bar, great service, tv's on the inside and outside.  The back porch is covered, and not too hot."}
{"text":"Worst. Service. Ever. Went in last night to try and get some food, which is usually pretty decent. Waited at the table for over 20 minutes before a server gave us menus. Then, about another 20 minutes went bye and the server still had not returned. Finally, someone flagged down a person who appeared to be the manager and asked him to please get us a server. A few minutes later, a different server returns, apologizes and says there was a mix up, and finally takes our drink/food order at the same time. The food came out one plate at a time about 30-45 minutes later, with about 20 minutes in between the first plate and the last plate, the app came out after the meals, and not once did the server check to see how the food was (multiple orders had been messed up...fries instead of tots, no onion ring on the burger that was supposed to have one, etc.), weren't able to order any other drinks, would have also been nice to have a water as well. After we finished our food, which wasn't that great...we had to track the server down to get our checks, and she happened to have completely lost our order and had to make tell her exactly what we had again. I ended up getting charged for an extra beer as well, but didn't notice until after I had already paid. I didn't feel like confusing the poor girl any further and honestly just wanted to get the hell out of there. I had already noticed a table sitting across that looked as if they walked out after being too upset by the terrible service. It ended up taking over 2 hours to get a wrap and 1 beer. Pretty terrible if you ask me"}
{"text":"Great place! I took my sister here for dinner for her birthday and we both loved it. I got the Solstice Wrap that had FRIED GREEN BEANS in it. That's all I needed to hear before I made my decision. It was so good! There are plenty of beers on tap and a big selection of local beers. 
The place is pretty dark inside which is fine for later in the night, but around dinnertime I wish it was a little brighter. Parking in that area is a huge pain too, so plan ahead :)"}
{"text":"Consistently good bar food with a decent selection of \"granola\"-veggie options for the missus. The patio's pretty awesome, and the beer selection is pretty great, too. I love coming here, especially on Sunday afternoons. Note that there are several TVs showing sports events, so don't go there and expect a quiet evening.

My few complaints: the service is pretty good generally, but you'll occasionally get a clueless server who seems to not come often enough and take far too long when she does. Also, they seem to have a couple dozen beers but no beer list, so you have to ask the server to read you the giant list every time.

UPDATE: Since my original post, Solstice has added a \"German Burger\", and it's one of the most underrated in the city: a burger topped with bacon, sauerkraut and homemade beer cheese on a pretzel bun... YUM! Unfortunately, the service is still very much hit or miss. The owner also has some kind of odd vendetta against vaping (in a bar? Really?). I still like Solstice, but between the spotty service, the awful parking situation in NoDa, and being the only bar in Charlotte that's ever hassled me about vaping, I don't go here nearly as much as I used to."}
{"text":"Great area and clean restaurant.  The tots are delicious. My fave is the appetizers. Fried green beans, hummus prepared fresh..yum! Love the outside patio area. Great drink specials on the weekends. You can also bring pets to the patio any time! Love this place:)"}
{"text":"Sat outside service was super slow. I don't feel like it was the waitresses fault, she had like 9 tables at the same time. Had to cancel the food orders after an hour. Went somewhere else. The food we did get was good. Just feel like the the service ruined it. Should have more waitresses and bartenders for a Saturday night. I won't be returning unfortunately."}
{"text":"Waited over an hour for our food. Once it came the food was wrong. They took my food back but left my boyfriends. He tried to wait but his food got cold. The waitress was extremely nice and understanding. Starving we went next door to get food due to terribly slow service and not receiving food at all."}
{"text":"Yep.  It's the patio.  It'll steal your heart.

Outdoor bar. Friendly people.  Bar specials. Dog friendly.  And FANS outside!  Charlotte is hot y'all!  I love this deck.  I didn't get any food, but I'll definitely be back and keep you updated.  

Bypass the weird, unfriendly facade from the street.  I was a little hesitant, but suck it up and go inside.  Awesome.

Oh!  And they have Big Buck Hunter, the shooting game!!  Win!"}
{"text":"One star because 0 isn't an option. The 4 p.m. bartenders need to be spoken to regarding their discriminatory behavior. The customers are their reason for being at this job, yet they treated my friends and I (who all just arrived from out of town) as an unfortunate obligation. I will absolutely never come back to this bar. Pat McCrory probably frequents this bar. To the ladies who just treated my friends and I like we were garbage, I hope you find some peace because you're clearly miserable."}
{"text":"I really like Solstice. I typically eat here during the week at lunchtime with my husband. Our food is always good. I have had the BLT which is always perfectly done to my taste. They don't skimp on the bacon. I usually share a couple of pieces with my husband. The tater tots are always hot and wonderful. I have enjoyed a blackened chicken sandwich here as well. It was perfectly cooked when I had it here once; not too thick and not dry as grilled chicken breasts tend to be.  My husband enjoys eating wraps here.  Our waitresses have always been friendly and attentive. A really nice spot for a later weekday lunch for us....comfortable, convenient and satisfying.  I have no reasons not to return in the future."}
{"text":"Solid spot.  Good for lunch or late night drinking.  A cornerstone of NODA.  Food is very good, and they serve late night.  Atmosphere is great.  Lots of TVs so it can be a good spot for watching games. It's NODA so obviously hipsters are all over the place.  Wide drink selection- from Busch light to fancy drinks.  The food is very good as well.  I come here often and will continue to do so."}
{"text":"This place totally wins on location, seating availability for groups, and its kickass patio. The food isn't the highlight, but it's serviceable American fare. Beer specials are good value and if you check in on another popular app, they're running a 20% off food purchases deal that makes their food a downright bargain. It's not the fanciest, but it's a good choice for casually hanging out with a group."}
{"text":"We waited an hour for our food but we understood at first because it was Saint Patrick's Day. However, our veggie burger was low key a hockey puck, our Cobb salad only had tomatoes and chicken on it, and the grilled cheese tasted like it was microwaved. The waitress was very apologetic but this was not a good experience at all."}
{"text":"Come on the right weekday night and they'll have $2 drink specials, although $3 wells ain't too bad either. And $1.50 PBR is always great. The bella quesadilla is packed with yummy veggies and is quite delicious. A great place to hang out with a group of people and watch whatever game you're looking to catch, because there are tons of tvs around. They have a few arcade games (Buck Hunter, some golf game) and a foosball table, and service is awesome. Definitely the place to hang out on a weekday night or a place to start off with on a weeknight.

Update: Tuesday night trivia = lots of beer to be won. Also, bartenders know me now, don't know if that's a good thing or not.."}
{"text":"I really want to love this place, I just can't. I love the back patio, and love that it's dog-friendly. The staff is friendly, kind, and competent. They have good beer specials. I just can't endorse the food. Their burgers are not meaty and juicy, they are more like a meat loaf- a lot of bread and spices. The result is a drier, heavier, breadier patty. This almost broke my heart, because I wanted to love the Bavarian Burger. I've also tried the philly cheese steak. Not much cheese. Not much steak. Plenty of bread."}
{"text":"Mini-corn dog me baby!!!  How did I live without these for so long???  I love all of the bar food here but the mini-corn dogs are my passion.  Excellent place to watch the game since there are huge big screen tvs inside.  The deck has a fun bar and great seating that will be plenty for all of your friends.  Perfect Friday night spot to chill - great juke box and fun games to play.  Love you Solstice!!"}
{"text":"We popped over on a Tuesday around noon because Sabor was packed. They weren't busy, so I figured we'd be in and out quickly. Boy was I wrong.  Our food took more than an hour!

I ordered a buffalo wrap, but I think they forgot the buffalo sauce, or spice, or anything that would add flavor. The wrap was so bland and everything inside sort of blended together. The chicken tenders inside were small and were not crispy... so it's basically a soggy slaw burrito with a hint of funky foot flavor from the blue cheese crumbles. The frozen tater tots were excellent. If I had to guess, the ingredients that were inside the wrap were mixed together around the time we ordered, but sat in a bowl for 45 minutes until the cook got around to filling the tortilla.  

My girlfriend ordered a flat bread that was also flavorless and soggy. My food actually arrived first and the waitress told her, \"yours will be out as soon as the cheese melts.\" So we're an hour into waiting on our food and that's the hold up? Maybe the oven was broken... maybe someone called in sick... we would never know because no one tried to apologize or explain the wait.  

The food was so bad, most stayed on the plate. I noticed the other patrons having a similar experience. Three men sat down minutes before us and got their food around the same time we did. Two had burgers and scarfed them down. One man who also ordered a buffalo wrap seemed to enjoy it as much as I enjoyed mine, because he barely touched it. 

A table of three ladies who waited too long for their salads and likely needed to return to work also left with out eating much. 

The waitress and a man who appeared to be the owner were busy rushing around, but they didn't seem to be doing much. 

I bet Solstice is a great place to grab a shot or a beer late night, but if you want a bite to eat... there are better options."}
{"text":"My go to spot in NoDa.  I live not far from there so it works out excellent for me.  They have a great beer selection and the staff is super friendly.  My wife gets carried away on the jukebox since you can buy songs directly from your phone.  Don't play \"What Does The Fox Say\" or they will cut it off and not reimburse you.  I am still waiting on that dollar.  I wish I still had Sunday's off since they have an incredible amount of TVs for football.  PACKER'S COUNTRY!!!!!!  It would be a lot better if those friggin Bear's fans would stay out.  Just kidding, I like a good laugh.  Plenty of room for everyone and if it's very crowded then they have a huge patio area."}
{"text":"When we entered the tavern smells of cinnamon and cigarette smoke entered our nostrils.  Metalwork suns and moons hung from the walls keeping with the solstice theme.  The afternoon bar crowd is an eclectic mix of fun people of all ages.  The servers are young and attractive, but not all that personable.  They were friendly, but just not on the level with their customers.  

The menu was filled with hilarious entrée and appetizer names, my favorite was John's Fried Fungus.  We were in the mood for a little snack and we went with the Salvador Chips and Salsa.  The vegetables in the dip were fresh and crunchy, but the salsa was kind of bland.  

I wouldn't really go for the music, luckily I came with another great conversationalist; otherwise I really couldn't stand the pop rock radio blaring throughout the bar.  They did play Blur, which was a plus, but I like to hear satellite radio in bars.  

We weren't able to leave after our beers, because our waitress walked across the street.  I do love this area, but I don't think I will visit Solstice again."}
{"text":"Winter, spring, summer or fall, any season is a good time to visit Solstice.  I was particularly impressed with the abundance of menu choices.  I was surprised to see that because my impression was that there would be more focus on the \"Tavern\" part but not at all, this place  has a great menu full of interesting wraps, burgers and traditional bar food as well (mini corn dogs----wha-what!!!).

I love the outdoor patio and could see myself spending hours on end there with friends and some good spirits.  

This restaurant is located in NoDa which is a neighborhood after my own heart.  If you get tired of the uptown crowd and need a break, unbutton that collar and take a ride north of town.  You'll be glad you did :)"}
{"text":"We had our fantasy draft here the other day and it was perfect.  They had free wifi we could use so that we all brought out laptops to draft and we sat outside on the patio.  The patio was huge and they had large picnic tables so we could all fit.  The waiter was great and very understanding since we all were pretty busy with our draft he still made sure to Come check on us often and made sure we always had beer.  It is dog friendly and my dog loved the patio.  I had the veggie burger and it was delicious and the fries were good too.  We went on a Monday night and they had great beer specials.  I really enjoyed it"}
{"text":"Freshly new to the Charlotte area, and the Noda area is defiantly becoming a fan favorite. I attended to go to a different restaurant, but the wait was little long for my preference. But nevertheless, my girlfriend told me about this spot, and how we could eat outside. And to my amazement I was pleasantly surprised. You just walk in and seat yourself, wherever your heart desires. It's dog friendly on the patio (from my observation) so if you want to bring your pooch your more then welcome too. It's a great place to come out with your significant other or a group of friends."}
{"text":"The burgers are consistently decent and the tater tots are always hot. The iced tea was fine as well. The service was good, no complaints there. The place was a bit loud, unlike other times I have been, but then again it was a Saturday night. 

Solstice Tavern is a place I enjoy when I go, but not a place I crave. Been there a few times and will return in the future."}
{"text":"Nice spot to hangout with friends during the weekend or on a weeknight. Food is good, service is okay, and the atmosphere is fun...especially outside! Can't visit NODA without making a trip to Solstice!"}
{"text":"Very cute little tavern in a quant little area. Service was great! If you are just coming to grab a brew and a small snack I highly recommend the pretzel. It's fresh and delicious!"}
{"text":"This chilled out bar is informal...to say the least.

With beer buckets or cornhole on the deck, this is is a place to be laid back and get your buzz on.

The patio is the real jewel in this establishment, but I'd recommend trying it out in the cooler months too."}
{"text":"The food isn't bad (bar food/ sandwiches) and the location is great, but I have had terrible service every time I've been in there. I ended up leaving during my most recent trip, after waiting 30 minutes for a beer! When I told the waitress that she didn't even have to worry about getting it because I was leaving... she didn't even apologize! I really WANT to like this place, I do. Basic customer service people."}
{"text":"Sostice is a nice place to go if you want to kick back outside and enjoy a decent beer. I got dragged into this place the by the Charlotte Roller Girls after practice one night.

The atmosphere is nice, during the week it isn't packed at all, and they have Magic Hat No. 9 on draft.

Solstice also has food but I only snagged a couple tater tots off of my friends' plate.Tots are tots but they were still good."}
{"text":"Solstice tavern is definitely one of the cooler spots I've been to in Charlotte. I loooove the back deck. It's huge, has a bar, and the paintings of dogs all over the walls is a plus! 

The tavern has a little bit of everything for everyone. Bar atmosphere with tvs if your looking to watch a game, huge deck to enjoy the beautiful weather, great drinks, and a huge menu suitable for any tastebuds. Drink prices are reasonable as long as the food. Last time we went I got a Caesar salad and split it with my friend who got the buffalo chicken wrap. Caesar salad was good, no complaints. The buffalo chicken wrap was pretty good also, different than I've had as it had coleslaw and cilantro( i love cilantro so so happy when it's added to new dishes) but I would definitely have it again! The Mac and cheese was deeelicious, I couldn't get enough! It had those fun spiral noodles in it too! 

I can't wait to venture out to NoDa again and stop at solstice for some drinks, food, and a great time!"}
{"text":"This place was OK.  The crowd was all regulars and they kind of took over the bar area so, for a non-regular, it can be overwhelming. The food was good though and the drinks weren't too expensive. I went on a Sunday and was surprised to find the bar/restaurant basically empty except for the few regulars milling around.  It's a causal dive bar with OK food so, if that's what you're going for then I suggest Solstice."}
{"text":"My brother loves this place for NFL games, so he took me here one weekday afternoon to get a bite to eat. Located in NoDa, this place fits right in with the taste & feel of a NoDa bar.

We were there in the middle of the day, in the middle of the week, so there weren't many people here. We had probably just missed the lunch crowd so we grabbed a seat at the bar. It was a nice, dark little place, hence the tavern name, but it still gave off a friendly, welcoming vibe. The bartender was nice & friendly, but it probably helps that he knew my brother. I could see this place being a nice hangout to watch a game or to cozy up to the bar & relax one evening.

I wasn't expecting much from the menu, but when I took a look at it, I was really surprised. They have quite a selection, from burgers to wraps to sandwiches. Yeah yeah, most places have these options, but they had some unique choices mingled in. I ordered a buffalo chicken wrap & while I think it's tough to screw it up, it was really pretty good. Better than the bar food I thought I was going to get. Apparently this place has really good burgers as well but I'll have to head back for one of those.

I can see Solstice Tavern being a jumping atmosphere during the late hours, so I can't judge the lack of people there on my limited experience. But I will say the food was much better than I expected & I could see myself hanging out here for a relaxing night during the week, watching a game."}
{"text":"Really? Just an average sports bar in a trendy neighbborhood.

What makes this place awesome? This is where Packer fans in Charlotte unite. This is where they meet on Sundays and Mondays during football season. This is where they drink cheap beer and talk about making their own brats. This is where they reminisce about harsh winters and Bret Farve.

I am not a Packers fan. I am married to one. I like this place because the crowd is tame and the back area is nice. I like the fried zuchini and squash. I like the cheap beer in buckets. I like that it is in a good location. That is all that I really expect from a sports bar."}
{"text":"Didn't have any food but we all got drinks. Cool environment with lots of TVs and they have some board games around for you to play."}
{"text":"I came in here for lunch today with a friend and we were just roaming around looking for a place to grab lunch at an inexpensive price and a pleasant atmosphere so we stopped in Solstice Tavern. I ordered 'The Muse' which is a turkey, roast beef and swiss sandwich placed on a croissant with horseradish sauce; it was pretty good. My friend ordered an 'Apple Cinnamon' wrap with chicken. She mentioned that it was like eating a chicken caesar wrap but with a surprise of apple and cinnamon, which turned out to be a great melody of flavors. The prices were not that expensive; atmosphere was dark, as a tavern should be, and screens all around for a sports bar type of feel. Staff was friendly, food was great, prices were reasonable and they have daily specials! Not bad."}
{"text":"I have stood in front of this place twice a week, waiting for the bus, every other week, since February.  It took a thunderstorm to get me into this place.  Wow this is a great restaurant / bar.

There are TV's everywhere and they are tuned to just about everything you might want to watch.  They had baseball, basketball, and America's got talent all over the bar.  Food was excellent with specials that make dinner very reasonable.  The night I was there, it was raining so their large patio had to clear out, but that looked really awesome.

I'll be back !"}
{"text":"I stopped in to try the reuben to continue my adventure around Charlotte to find the best reuben the Queen City had to offer. The reuben was pretty average, but the side of mac and cheese was fantastic and worth stopping in for.

The corned beef was pretty decent, although one half of my sandwich barely had any on it. The kraut was OK and the bread was pretty standard marbled rye, but the cheese was flavorful and plentiful. The reuben really didn't stand out and I don't think I'd order it again, but I would be happy to head back to Solstice Tavern to see if something else paired up better with the delicious mac and cheese."}
{"text":"Pretty cool bar.  The drinks are good.  Some local beers on tap which is awesome a plus for me.  The food was good although I was disappointed they didn't have fried green tomatoes on the menu anymore.  The veggie burger was tasty though."}
{"text":"From the outside, Solstice is not impressive in any way.  In fact, it may seem downright scary unless you have been riding with SAMCRO recently.  But take a gamble and you will probably be pleasantly surprsied.  The real gem is not the building, it is on the other side, since Solstice has an incredible patio out back.

In fact, it just might be larger than the entire rest of the building, and like one of those secret gardens in Old South cities like Charleston or Savannah, you would probably never know it existed if you did not see it with your own eyes.

Now I do not try to compare the Solstice patio with something you might  find in Charleston by any means - but when you look upon the patch of dirt out in front of the P-Stone, it is like night and day."}
{"text":"Would have loved to be able to rate this place higher but I sat at the bar for 5-10 minutes and got to witness 3 bartenders socializing and hanging out, and despite making eye contact with them, i never received any service. Boo. On the other hand, when I walked into Jack Beagles by mistake, thinking it was this place, the bartender greeted me right away, gave me a menu, and when we figured out I was in the wrong bar she gave me some water to go. If that's how lost strangers get treated, I'm sure their customers get treated even better! Therefore, I will not be back to this place, but I will definitely be back to give Jack Beagles a try."}
{"text":"Two words: GERMAN BURGER.

Okay, I like a lot of things about this place. The awesome patio and outdoor bar area. The tvs. The people. But ya'll.... the GERMAN BURGER.

I'll stop with the all caps. I lived in this neighborhood for a year and never knew about this delicious menu item. My friend good friend JoJo introduced me to it during our Noda brewery and bar crawl over the weekend. Pretzel bun, burger, sauerkraut, beer cheese and bacon. That was a tasty burger. The Sunrise Burger was also hit at our table. Personally, I'm a big fan of anything with an egg on it. Over easy for me, please. I like the Solstice Sundials, too.

I don't consider this a sports bar, but I do think it's a great place to watch a game. 24 flatscreens... inside and outside. Nothing like being able to watch football and play a few rounds of cornhole. It's also dog friendly. Woof. 

Solstice, I always make it a point to stop by when I'm in NoDa. You never disappoint."}
{"text":"I'll start with the positives.. I really enjoy the vibes of the area outback. Unfortunately, that's where the positives end.

The food here just wasn't good. I had a buffalo chicken wrap and it was sad. Maybe this is a good place to come and grab a drink, but you can just tell they don't care about the quality of their food here. Especially for the NoDa area. 

Don't eat here"}
{"text":"Never been a huge fan of this place, but had nothing bad to say either.

However, last visit, we witnessed some pretty shady business practices. Management seems to think their job is a joke. And after seeing them take advantage of some tipsy customers, we've decided we won't return to Solstice."}
{"text":"I called Solstice in advance of going there on a Saturday to make sure dogs were allowed on the patio all evening.  We walked across town to be yelled at when we entered & told how we should have read the sign that says no dogs.  I wasn't looking for a sign since I called... Considering food and service is average, we probably had a better evening when we went across the parking lot to Jack Beagles anyway."}
{"text":"Always my late night go to! It's within walking distance, always fast and friendly. The food is good and hits the spot after an evening out. My favorite are the wings extra crispy, pretzel & German burger!! There is no parking, so you have to find something on the street, which can be a hassle at times."}
{"text":"Huh. This place kind of surprised me. At first glance, it looks like Budweiserville - TVs everywhere, chotchkeys and neon, tiny shorts on all the waitresses. But they have good beers on tap (with nary a Bud or PBR to be seen) and a large selection of veg friendly food. Awesome.

Menu reminds me a bit of P-stone's, wraps and burgers, all kinds of fried apps. Had the zucchini chips - like a combination of the Stone's  zucchini sticks and the Penguin's pickle chips, pretty damn good. Veg wrap was ok, the burger large and pretty standard. 7 bucks is a steal, tho, if you're craving perfectly fried tater tots (which I always am).

You know that brewery on 85, to your right as you drive north, just passed Greensboro? Their beers on on tap here, and are both good, if not very challenging. 4.25 per. Back porch is comfy and somewhat TV-less. I don't get the quaint feel, nor the dive thing, but I could see drinking beverages and eating decent, cheap bar food here when the mood strikes. It's not their fault I hate sports bars."}
{"text":"A staple of Noda, Solstice Tavern is a very casual place to connect with friends. There's a large patio during the summer time that seats large groups or you can come alone and sit at the bar and meet new friends. The bar tenders are knowledgeable and personable. My last visit here was to catch up with a friend who was returning from out of town after previously living in Charlotte. The waitress, who gave us a disclaimer that this was her first day, did a great job. It's not that she knew all of the answers to questions. It's that the effort was there and she was attentive to a large group. So kudos to her. I recall ordering their fried zucchini/squash. The cook was able to accommodate my request for aioli sauce. These came out piping hot and were very tasty once they cooled down. One thing that was noteable is that the bathroom is odd with the entrance door being up against the sink when open. Just a bit cramped when busy. Great place for hanging out and having a bite of bar food with a drink."}
{"text":"Decent place but drinks are overpriced and the older brunette bartender was EXTREMELY rude. Will not be going back due to her horrible attitude."}
{"text":"I usually only go here for the drinks and the back patio.  Warning, there is a lot of trees in the back and they often drop things into your drink.  I don't mind it but other people might.  Their food is alright, definitely not the best.  When I do have to eat there, I always get the chicken wrap.  The fries are pretty good too!  Back patio is nice with cornhole and is dog friendly! They have an outside bar but it wasn't opened this past weekend.  Always look forward to sunny days at this place.  Alcohol is expensive, especially the local craft.  Service was also lacking. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I love this bar! The patio is great, plenty of seating out there and whatnot but I really prefer to sit at the bar. Always great service from the staff and you can several channels without having to look around the room.

The chili cheese fries rock my world. 

We accidentally went on trivia night  and had a blast! Reasonable pricing and nightly specials mean I'll probably be back. Again. Soon."}
{"text":"A relatively young crowd and a hot spot in the trendy NoDa section of Charlotte. It has a selection of about 20 beers on tap and several more in the bottle. The menu is standard pub fare of sandwiches and greasy heaven, perfect for a few drinks with friends. TV's abound with whatever the hottest games are at the moment. 

The food excellent. I ordered a hokie croissant which consists of turkey, bacon, and swiss with lettuce, tomato, and mayo. All of the ingredients fresh and the tater tots fried to perfection. 

The bartenders are quite attentive and check to ensure your satisfaction."}
{"text":"Drinks came out quickly and great.  Food took over an hour for a party of 5.  And it's not even crowded.
No good excuse when inquired.  Mgmt unconcerned.  
Will go elsewhere for food next time.

UPDATE;  we paid for our drinks and left.
Over an hour w/no food."}
{"text":"New to the NoDa area so making it a point to try out all the local bars & restaurants and so far enjoying everything.

Solstice was a random visit after walking around in need of some bar food & drinks. Stopped in and just so happen the locals were having a Bar Crawl which I wished I knew about with Solstice being one of the many spots. 

The menu is pretty creative with the play on the different Solstice events. Decided to order the BBQ wings & the Breakfast Burger. The wings got good reviews from my bf but I was a little turned off by the burger. I ordered my burger medium, without bacon with a scrambled egg. A pet peeve of mine is a waiter/waitress who don't write down an order and when it comes out wrong you automatically think it's their fault which could be true or false. My burger came out with bacon (haven't eaten pork in over 20 years) so they took that back and it came back out well done but I didn't want to send back since it took a while for our original order to come back.

As a former bartender, I have an issue with a bartender being on their cellphone when customers are around. One of the bartenders was on her phone and we wanted another round. We eventually got her attention. 

Overall, a 2.5 star experience for me but saw 2 ladies walk out unsatisfied because they waited a while and had reservations else where. After talking with them briefly before they left, the wait was a problem with getting a cocktail. I'll definitely come back again since I think the girls were a bit overwhelmed but being on the cellphone is unprofessional."}
{"text":"Found this restaurant when in noda looking for a place to eat. Not as packed on a Friday evening as everywhere else, but the place was amazing. Great food, cool patio, cheap drinks, kind staff. Got great recommendations from or server on what to order and it didn't disappoint. Was able to catch a basketball game out on the patio bar as well. Great atmosphere, great people. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I visited the Solstice several times while I was in Charlotte for work. Now I go back every time I'm in town. The atmosphere is very comfortable- it's usually a nice mix of people and they're usually friendly. I was pleased that they were showing the Indians ballgame on TV- as a displaced Clevelander, I felt right at home!

Service is excellent and prices are a good value.  I love the trivia night they do, we always have a great time. It's a competitive bunch, but everyone is really fun about it.

My favorite part is obviously the food. I've had a couple things there- wraps are good, salads are put together well, but the thing I CRAVE is their German burger. Sauerkraut, bacon and beer cheese on a patty and a pretzel bun. I almost lost my damn mind. We splurged and also had fried pickles and the tater tots. I seriously think of this burger all the time. Perhaps it's time to plan my next trip to Charlotte....."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch date with hubby.  Atmosphere on their large deck helped with the addition of fans.  Ugly painted dog wall with one token un-named feline face in the support of political correctness.  Our waitress assumed the air of an impatient school marm initially, but warmed up toward the end (tip time, you think?)  I had the bella quesadillas which are consistently good.  Hub had a burger which made him purr with pleasure and a side of cucumber salad which he eyed fearly at first but settled into.  It seems Solstice keeps changing the recipe on the cucumber salad; it was a tad sweet for me this time.  Or perhaps that is what happens when one decreases the amount of sugar in one's diet.  All in all, it is a place that I will keep returning for food and drink."}
{"text":"Went to Solstice Tavern last night, and had an overall good experience.

The best part of the night was the service. I am mad at myself for not getting the waitresses name for this review, she was one of the best waitresses I have ever had. She is a tiny woman with dreadlocks, and although she was the only waitress working the floor on a Saturday night, she was spot on for every single table of the packed restaurant.

The food was good, although we had our hearts set on the mushroom/swiss/bacon burger advertised on the chalkboard outside, and when we ordered found out they were on the late night menu (which is basically only food that is deep-fried.) We ended up getting chicken fingers and fries which were good. Chicken tenders are always a scary order for me, there is always a 50% shot that they will be dry and bland and these were not.

Price was very reasonable. The atmosphere is comfortable. Only complaint is that they were only playing college basketball on half the tvs and the larger tvs were playing some NBC crime show, which I found odd.

Patio is great for smokers as well and features a full service bar."}
{"text":"This place is horribly disgusting. They are a self-seating bar with multiple televisions around the place. There was also some type of game off in the corner. The women's bathroom was clean, just had a weird layout. 

We ordered the fried pickles for the appetizer. The coating was seasoned very well but the pickles were sliced so thin that they fried through and we thought we were eating pickle flavored chips. 

My burger was burnt and without seasoning. Obviously frozen or premade because it was also dry. The crinkle cut fries weren't good either. No seasoning and on the soggy side. Boyfriend got the cheesesteak and provided subpar reviews. 

Two stars for the good beer selection but there are much better places in NoDa."}
{"text":"Food was good and enjoyed the neighborhood that this bar is located. The service was also good."}
{"text":"I love this place! Great drink specials, spacious, great patio, good food :) I would recommend it to my friends and family in a heartbeat"}
{"text":"What a great spot in Noda especially for game day! I'll start with the patio which I loved, a lot of TV choices for games and the staff was just wonderful. The manager or owner not sure was very accommodating to get the right game in the right TV for fans wanting to watch. Loved the crowd eclectic and exciting, regarding the food ordered nachos, these were a disappointment as way too much pepper which was weird I wouldn't recommend these then ordered wings and fries which were very good. 

Plenty of beer choices and would for sure come back and loved the Packer Fans that were in the house! Go PAC!"}
{"text":"My husband and I live in NoDa and frequently eat out. We have been here a few times and every time it gets worse... The first time we ordered food, my husbands order of wings came out after about 40 minutes of waiting on a very slow day (less than 15 people in the place and half of them were at the bar). My food didn't come out for another half hour and the chicken tenders they gave me were a joke. Three of them were the size of my fingers. I'm not exaggerating. One of them was the size of my pinky... Only in this scenario it is unfortunate that I don't have fat pinkies... We weren't impressed but decided to give it another try on a \"busier\" day (less than 30 people) and had to wait over 45 minutes for one order of wings. We wanted to like this place. We really did. We even spaced out our visits to give them new chances. The last time we went there (which will continue to be our last time) we waited an hour for one order of wings. Our waitress did not fill our drinks yet found the time to fill up the tables near us. We eventually had to ask another waitress to see if the food was coming out, she then grabbed our waitress to ask her and our waitress didn't even look in our direction and spoke only to her coworker. We were right there, so we heard her say \"oh ok\"... And that was it. She never checked on us again and we waited about 10 more minutes before we left. We walked right past her and she still said nothing. Hopefully someday they get replaced with an actual restaurant that has decent service and gives you the food you order. :)"}
{"text":"Love the back porch. Food is standard bar fare. Lots of fried stuff."}
