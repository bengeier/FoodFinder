{"text":"Being from California, I can say that this place has decent Mexican food. The only reason this place got a three star rating is because the pitcher of Margarita tasted as if there was no liquor in it. My husband and I split a pitcher and I didn't even catch a buzz (and we are very light weight when it comes to drinking) so we basically bought a $20 pitcher of juice."}
{"text":"Food and service is great! The restaurant is cute and has a good set up. Drinks were very well made (ordered a mojito). A tip: the shrimp diablo is extremely spicy. I love spicy food, but even this put me to the test. The waiter though was very nice and brought extra sour cream for me. It did bring tears to me eyes from being so spicy- they do not mess around! Good flavor though. My fiance ordered a large burrito and he loved it."}
{"text":"I ordered food from this restaurant thru SkipTheDishes, I specified my food allergies i.e. no cheese and corn tortillas.  I received my order, but to my surprise cheese was layered all over it and there were FLOUR tortillas like I specifically asked not to deliver! I called the restaurant and spoke to a manager whom didn't really seem to care that the order was wrong. I asked if he could correct the order and re-deliver it, he told me to take it up with SkipTheDishes and hung up on me!!!! I would NEVER RECOMMEND THIS RESTAURANT DUE TO THE I don't care attitude and on the grounds that they just don't care aboutCUSTOMER SATISFACTION and QUALITY!  SkipTheDishes called the restaurant and the manager had the nerve to offer $1.25 off my order!  How about READING THE SPECIFICATIONS IN THE FIRST PLACE AND GETTING IT RIGHT! Don't even waste your time with this restaurant."}
{"text":"Great.  Upscale Mexican food.  Great flavors.    Enchiladas Verde chicken had a great flavor.  Steak tacos very tasty and good steak.  Great guacamole.    Our new favorite."}
{"text":"Love this place, by far one of the best Mexican restaurant in Cleveland."}
{"text":"So amazing.  Great food, awesome staff and amazing drinks.  Love this place !!!! Been here twice and each time has been amazing.  Ill be back...like tommorow ...."}
{"text":"Second time and just as good as the first!   Service was fast and friendly,  margaritas were fantastic,  and the chicken chimichangas are delicious.  If you want great,  authentic,  inexpensive Mexican food in Cleveland; you should stop in!"}
{"text":"Great food, a little heavy on the onion, but overall very good customer service, cute quaint location, kinda looks like a club on the outside, but it's not, so no worries. We will be back!"}
{"text":"oh no  of course they do!  that's exactly what we are looking for.  ate there on Saturday and it was very good, will for sure go again soon . service. food. drinks . all very well done. give this business a chance . looks like they are putting everything into it"}
{"text":"On the pricy side!  Food is okay! The salt that is used to rim the margaritas have red pepper flakes mixed in it! I'm not a fan of it and they would not just give me just salt and there was a box of salt behind the bar.  That constitutes poor customer service and that is why it only gets 3 stars!"}
{"text":"The food here is Delicious. I'm truthfully wondering if I should say how amazing it is because I don't want long waits when I come but I have to rave about how good the restaurant is because it deserves it. The food taste as if it was made by your mother or grandmother. Super Fresh and they Have Horchata which is Amazing. One of the Owners Omar was really kind talk to us for a while made us feel at home."}
{"text":"We enjoyed everything!  The mofungitos appetizer (Fried Plantains shaped into a small bowl and filled with our choice of meat)  We chose chorizo and it was spectacular. A lot of unique items and will be be back for them! Salsa and traditional Guacamole were both very fresh. We filled up on snacks and just shared the enchilada verde, which was just enough to cap off the night.  Margarita was solid, but the tequila selection was limited for anything aged. Also served Horchata!"}
{"text":"Some of the best Mexican food I have ever had! Great presentation and atmosphere while being friendly to those of us on a tight budget. Nice job! The only thing I would recommend is to play iHeartRadio instead of pandora because of the commercials."}
{"text":"Contemporary feel. Food authentically spiced. Fresh ingredients. I ordered the mango guac and fajitas. Big portions. Variety of margarita flavors. Prices are a little higher than the competitor down the road. However, don't mind paying a little more for quality ingredients and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great food bit pricy on the booze! $9.00 for a well margarita with little well tequila is insane! Glass filled with ice and little liquid!"}
{"text":"This was the 1st time being here and I must say it was great. The fajita are just as pictured. The frozen mango margarita was the bomb. Great wait staff. Very helpful explain the menu. And the bartender was very friendly and patient explaining the different drinks."}
{"text":"A pleasant surprise! The food is so fresh and prepared with flavorful combinations. The prices are good and the service was friendly with a warm atmosphere."}
{"text":"This place had good food, but when my wife and I went to use our groupon that we got for a birthday present, we were rejected.  The 'General manager' gave us no options with a crappy attitude.  We went on a date night that was long awaited and our night was ruined by some of the worst service by management I've ever experienced!"}
{"text":"This place blew us away. The two dinners we had were outstanding. The Lime Chicken and Chipotle Chicken were very flavorful and portions were very generous. They came w/ cilantro lime rice and charro beans, again both very good especially, the charro beans. Even the margherita was good as was the complimentary chips and salsa. Oh yeah, and service was great although it wasn't crowded when we went. Don't have a negative thing to say and definitely recommend. Parking is limited so park in the Aldi's lot (it's a short walk)."}
{"text":"This place is amazing !! Great twist on classic Mexican fare and awesome service not to mention the lavish decore! I can't wait to come back !!!"}
{"text":"I had a michelada wich it was delicious, tacos, guacamole, everything was good, (food and service) definitely coming back! Keep it like that!! You guys are doing great!"}
{"text":"Diverse selection of tex-mex, central and south american cuisine representing several different countries. Think burritos and arepas. Very affordable prices. Comfortable and modern design inside. Awesome bar. Very delicious food and very big portions aside from the chicken wing appetizer. They are NOT \"jumbo\". Sadly they are very puny. Which was weird considering their burritos were freaking HUGE."}
{"text":"My husband and I stumbled upon this hidden gem and were very pleasantly surprised. El Torito Taquiera easily excels and surpasses any competition in the area near and far. They have the total trifecta - aesthetics and presentation of food, excellent service and reasonable price. They propel Mexican food to a whole new level by incorporating South American and Columbian dishes for the perfect amount of spice and ingenuity. I can't say enough positive things about it. Pineapple margarita served in a pineapple is a must try (neat!). Appetizer must have: Chorizo Fireballs. Favorite dish: Chipolte Chicken. Love, love, love! My new favorite restaurant by far."}
{"text":"Stopped here after visiting the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame with my wife based on it's Yelp rating. Yelp came through. The food was excellent, reasonably priced and our waiter was very friendly. I ordered the seafood chimichanga and my wife had the shrimp tacos. No skimping on the seafood, cooked well and well seasoned. Wish this joint was closer to Dublin."}
{"text":"This places delivers on the flavor and the service!  One of the best Mexican food places I have been to, the enchiladas Jalisco were fantastic with the pork on top was a great compliment. Full of flavor with an obvious home made touch this dish is worth trying every time.   I also recommend the Chorizo Fireballs. You are sometimes concerned that cream cheese would drown out the other flavor a but the chorizo really holds its own.   Overall, excellent service with great flavors, don't let the outside of the restaurant fool you, this place is a diamond in the rough."}
{"text":"You guys, I LEGITIMATELY have an El Torito addiction. Seriously. I get it once, then IT'S ALL I WANT TO EAT FOREVER AND EVER. It is absolutely, the freshest, most delicious food, most bangin' margs, and friendliest staff. Go there and get ANYTHING, and I promise you won't be disappointed. I'm absolutely addicted to the chorizo fireballs, any/all of the mofongitos, the shrimp tacos, the enchiladas, the cilantro lime rice, the guacamole, the salsa - EVERYTHING I HAVE HAD. So GOOD. The best part? If you're feeling lazy, order their goodies on Uber Eats - it arrives SO FRESH AND HOT AND AMAZING. I'm in love with them. Did you catch that? El Torito, I love you. Never change or go away."}
{"text":"We started going here when it first opened... we loved it! This is our third trip and unfortunately our last. The party is over! If you can't deliver superior service on taco Tuesday at 8pm, we have a problem!  The chips and salsa always arrive on point at the joint. But everything else falls short for the price point.  Most meals are $13- $15 I would like a check back after meal delivery... didn't happen.  One of our meals was completely wrong and my fiancé had to go on and adventure to get it replaced.  I can say the margarita are on point and a great value (if you order a pitcher)  I think the passion is gone and management is none existent!  Perhaps they can get back on track... but to late for this girl!"}
{"text":"Thank you yelpers for writing reviews about this place! My boyfriend and I recently came here because we have heard such great things and we had a fantastic meal, great service and a great time!  We started the night with the Pineapple Margarita as well as the Mango Margarita! I had to put the pineapple one on a plate because it was leaking through but this margarita is much more delicious than I was expecting. I loved the touch of hot sauce on the pineapple rings. For an appetizer we ordered the Mofonguitos! Best decision ever! They are so delicious and you can mix and match the type of meat you want. The shrimp is what you dream of shrimp tasting like! They were perfectly cooked and oh so fresh. They were so good that I made sure to order shrimp in my main entree. Just a note- believe the reviews you can probably share an entree if you get an appetizer because the portions are huge.   For my main entree I ordered the Seafood Chimichanga while my boyfriend ordered the Camarones de Pacifico (jumbo shrimp wrapped in bacon). We filled up so much on the delicious house salsa that both of us needed to go boxes after only a few bites of our entrees (ha ha). Our waiter was extremely friendly and had good suggestions for us- I always appreciate when servers know the menu well. After we paid our bill we were surprised with 2 free shots of tequila! What a nice gesture. We will for sure come back (not just because of the shots)!  *The parking lot is interesting and will test your maneuverability skills.*"}
{"text":"Amazing food (try chipotle chicken and/or chimichanga) and amazing drinks!   Service is very friendly and very fast.   Interior is very very nice - great atmosphere for groups!"}
{"text":"Definitely one our new favorites.   Soups are amazing, tilapia was delicious, perfectly  seasoned and spicy.  Margaritas are made fresh and served in a BIG glass."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and drinks! Had different taco plates and their chorizo queso was out of the world.  It was our first time going and can definitely say we will be back very soon."}
{"text":"Well....it was food.  There was thankfully alcohol.  However I think the flavors were lacking sorely.  Consequently I would not recommend this place.  The food was muted in flavor.  Maybe it would be better if I was very drunk."}
{"text":"Fresh, great portions, high quality ingredients.  My new favorite Mexican restaurant on the westside. Ordered seafood fajita and got huge shrimp and diver scallops for 14.99.  Unreal.  Charo beans are the best beans I've ever had.  Smokey and balcony.  Staff is sweet and helpful."}
{"text":"Used a Groupon here but still managed to spend $85 for 6 people.   Really good food,  I would consider Mexican cuisine.  Large servings.  Ordered the monfogitos (shrimp tastes the best) and fajitas. The refried beans could be tastier. Was disappointed that I couldn't order the sliders because they didn't have the bread?? Not sure what that is about.  They also didn't have a kid's menu but you can ask them to make your kid a taco.  The queso also shouldn't be labeled as jalapeño because I couldn't taste it (which is not a bad thing but jalapeño may put people off and not order).  Queso was drippy but my kid devoured it.  Would return."}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican restaurant in NEO.   Inside is a typical casual place and a little noisy given the tile floors.  The food and drinks are amazing.  My teenage daughter loves the chicken and pineapple that is served on a tree.  The steak and shrimp is great.   I really enjoy the seafood with cheese that is served in its own sizzling pot.  The pineapple Margarita is huge and fun.  And the staff is some of the nicest and most attentive at any restaurant."}
{"text":"Came to El Torito Taqueria Bar for dinner with family on a Tuesday night. Was very impressed! Quick, friendly service. Very expansive menu. Food was very good. Margaritas were excellent, as well. Casual, laid back atmosphere that you would expect at a Mexican restaurant. They had several TVs to watch the various games on. Would definitely go back and recommend to others!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant Jr.and girls Lily all the staff so wonderful Please tell them Marco sent you"}
{"text":"In all honesty I was a bit skeptical of this place when I saw it was going to be a Spanish restaurant. We have quite a few (really) good Spanish restaurants on the west side and wasn't sure it would find enough of a niche to stand out. Well Yelpers, I was wrong. This place is flat out delicious. I've had a jalapeño margarita (really good) and the shredded beef arepa (they call it an arepita) which is absolutely fantastic. The restaurant probably only sits about 60-70 people including the bar. I've been a couple times now and they seem to always have atleast 3 people working the floor which was plenty. The servers are very personable and quick. Take it from me, a former skeptic, try this place out."}
{"text":"The margaritas here are some of the best I've ever had. The jalapeño marg and the cucumber margarita were on point. The bartender was super friendly"}
{"text":"We came here on a whim after a Groupon popped up that we couldn't resist, and man, were we glad.   El Torito is on 117th and looks unassuming from the street. Within, they have a really tasty list of Mexican fare that is great in taste and presentation. We both got the taco combos that came with salads and rice, all of which was well dressed, flavorful and enjoyable (if not a bit messy, but I like to eat tacos with my hands, so...ask for extra napkins:)   We didn't get drinks, but the margarita's I saw were quite...huge, and the diners were enjoying them quite a bit.   The staff was friendly and helpful, and the experience for us both was a good one. So, if you're looking for food with class, style and comfortable surroundings, I think El Torito has what you're looking for."}
{"text":"Words don't do justice to how great El Torito is, but I will give this a shot. This is without a doubt the best Mexican food I have ever eaten. I am someone who eats Mexican food on a weekly, and sometimes daily basis, and there is just no comparison anywhere near the Cleveland area or in Ohio in my opinion. My girlfriend and I went here the first or second week it opened, and I have to admit I was skeptical. However, after having their unbelievable authentic tacos,  fried plantains, and homemade hot sauce (you have to ask for it), I have been back almost once a week since.   Their tacos are incredible, authentic Mexican tacos that you cannot find anywhere else in Cleveland. They are kind of buried on their appetizer/drink menu, but anyone who comes here has to try. My favorite is the Barbacoa taco, but everything is incredible (al pastor, chicken, steak, carnitas, you name it). All of their meat options are beyond juicy and ridiculously flavorful, and when topped off with their wonderful cilantro onion mix and served in two grilled corn tortillas, nobody can beat this high-quality taco made with quality ingredients. Oh, and you have to ask for some of their homemade hot sauce too if you looked spicy. It is quite hot, but has the most amazing flavor that perfectly compliments every taco, and is never exactly the same twice.   The plantains are a must try also. I grew up with a grandma that made fried plantains constantly, and I have to admit these are better. They are beat down into flat wedges, fried, seasoned, and then served with an incredible garlic/cheese sauce for dipping. They are only 3.99 and are simply listed as \"plantains\" under sides on their menu.   Just incredible. I recommend anyone in this area to stop by, particularly if you have never had true, authentic Mexican tacos. This is my first Yelp review, and will likely be my last--unless I come across a place that compels me to feel the need to tell the world how amazing it is, like El Torito has."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place through Yelp. Apparently opened 1 month ago. Passing by not sure if I would have stopped given the area, but glad we did. Super clean, nice atmosphere, and packed with people. Had chorizo balls for app - very good, but heavy on the cream cheese just FYI. Then had tacos which were authentic and well seasoned - not super excited about the tongue but others were on spot. Finally the star of the night...the sirloin steak. Our expectations were moderate, our actual dinner plate was amazing. We we both happily satisfied with the flavor and perfection of medium-rare cooking. The beans - charro, you must get charro - by my husband's standards who makes incredible beans (Dallas Tex mex style) were \"the best he's every had\" - of course aside from his. We can't wait to come back and try more. Ps try the campirina - despite being a Mexican bar it was legit."}
{"text":"This food is amazing good prices !!! I love atmosphere and my waiter was really nice, it actually taste like Spanish food."}
{"text":"OMG.  So glad we saw this on Yelp and then had a discount.  What a find!  Started with the Jalapeno margarita.  Perfect. I managed to be talked into a second one.  :)_  My husband had a salad, and it looked scrumptious.  I had the shrimp tacos, with lime rice.  The side salad was beautiful; perfectly fresh, and tasty.  The tacos were jammed with yummy stuff, and the shrimp was delicious and not over cooked.  Although I was stuffed to the gills, I could not stand leaving anything behind.  I did not take photos, as there are a ton on the site of this place.  All are completely correct and helpful.    The décor is simple, clean, and neat.  The staff members were all friendly, and the service was excellent.  The restaurant was busy, but not packed for a Sunday night.  Parking is behind the building, and seems sufficient for the size of the place.  It probably runs tight on really busy nights.    We WILL be back.  It was amazing."}
{"text":"Had dinner there last night. Food was great.  Steak tacos were very good. Tortillas were fresh and guacamole was excellent.  I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"Excelente!  We really enjoyed this place. The food is amazing. . . . Like a typical Mexican restaurant but with some unique options. The beans are so good and ask for the spicier salsa option. It's Smokey and oh so good!  The service is great too.  A shout out to our server, Leo, who was friendly and smiley and went above and beyond to make sure we had a perfect evening. Thanks!"}
{"text":"We visited this restaurant for the first time late afternoon on a Friday.  I ordered the smallest size strawberry margarita.  It was huge and delicious!  Our two dinners were presented nicely.  My burrito was absolutely huge but the other dinner consisting of three or four enchiladas was a smaller portion.  In fact, my friend helped eat some of mine.  Everything tasted very good but the food was only lukewarm whereas at other Mexican restaurants it's normally piping hot.  The service was fast and friendly.  We will come back."}
{"text":"This is, quite possibly, the best Mexican restaurant in which I've had the pleasure of eating.  The service is fast and friendly too, which helps!  I can't say enough good things about the place.  Really.  Please note that, from the outside, it doesn't look like much, but the interior is nice, and food great.  Also, their parking lot is small, and even if it's full, there are generally tables inside.  They tell me that they have permission to use KFC's parking lot (next door), so don't be shy.  It's worth the hassle of finding a spot!"}
{"text":"Wonderful food, great service, and terrific margaritas!We will definitely go back!! This is a place that is definitely worth the visit!"}
{"text":"One of my good friends, her sister from back home in California told me about this place... We always pass by this business, but never noticed this place. Authentic Mexican is what we always seem to crave. It is hard finding that here in Ohio. I am born and raised in California and you would think to find it in other states. Barrio's is a great place but definitely wouldn't call it authentic Mexican by all means... I am so glad Mari suggested this place to us. We walked in an were seated immediately with fresh chips and salsa. We ordered from Ana the standard carne asada and enchiladas verde. It was really good standing next to El Carnicero!! They make the Best Michelada. No one in Ohio knows what that is... Friendly staff!! So happy I found a restaurant that speaks the same language when it comes to food!!"}
{"text":"The first time my family and I went here I was concerned because the outside of the building looked like a bar but I read so many good reviews so we decided to try it anyway. I'm so glad we did!!! Its a beautiful restaurant inside. The food is fantastic. You can tell everything is made fresh there every day (no generic mexican rice or queso!). I've been back three times since."}
{"text":"Can't get enough of this place...the food never disappoints.  We always get takeout and it carries well.  Best Mexican spot on the Westside hands down"}
{"text":"This is definitely my favorite Mexican restaurant in the area. El jalapeños (the closest place to eat by me) is no comparison. It's so much better than any Mexican place I have encountered since being in this area. It can be a little pricy in the evenings, but they offer great prices on their lunch menu. $5 lunch specials have been offered here. The staff there are also super nice!"}
{"text":"Went here with my daughter and son in law.  Service was friendly and very efficient.  We never felt rushed.  We had two appetizers, both of which were very good.  The taco plates were excellent, plenty of food and even some leftover!  I have been looking for a new go to Mexican restaurant, this is it.  Definitely worth the drive, and they have a parking lot behind the restaurant."}
{"text":"Solid five stars here. Closest you can get to authentic tacos in Cle. I dig the carne asada tacos. Served on 2 corn tortillas. The service is great! The tacos a a bit pricey but you get what you pay for. Add some of the complimentary salsa that comes with the chips too! Side note, you enter through the back where the parking lot is. Not the front door. My favorite taco spot and had to drop in for Cinco de Mayo! Check it out and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Not your traditional TexMex place. Not completely off the ranch but some refreshing variation on the theme. This is not an order by number place or an \"I'll have the combo\" place.   Very good and nicely priced food and margaritas. The enchilada supreme plate is very good. Fast and efficient service.   Try it. Experiment. You'll be happy you did."}
{"text":"The staff was very nice and attentive. They were great about pre-bussing tables, even a server that wasn't my own came by and grabbed an empty dish from the edge of the table, that was nice. We had a pitcher of margaritas and both of us liked them. We ordered chicken nachos as an appetizer and they were just okay. There was a generous amount of chicken but MAJORLY lacked cheese, that was the most disappointing part for me. We split an order of steak fajitas for our meal and they were also just okay. The flavor was definitely there, my main complaints are the meat to veggie ratio (too many veggies) and the steak being a little tough. The fajitas came with a side plate including guac, sour cream, rice and beans. The beans were pasty and just blah and the rice was extremely over cooked. We both agreed we were happy that we stopped in to check it out, but probably wouldn't return. The bill was over $50, pricey compared to our usual Mexican choice. The ladies room was very unkempt. Both toilets were clogged, one stall was out of tp, and there was tp all over the floor. The rest of the place looked very clean though."}
{"text":"Fantastic first meal at El torito. Went on Sunday afternoon and the staff was welcoming and friendly. Slightly disorganized as one would expect at a fresh opening. I'm confident they will soon hit their stride and be a community favorite."}
{"text":"You this place is the best I love the people and the workers here they know how to make you feel at home and boy! Let me tell you about the food oh my God it feels like the Mayan gods them selves made the food enjoy"}
{"text":"Newly opened Mexican restaurant on w117th street. Next to KFC. Dont go by the outside looks. It's definitely a club converted to a restaurant. Parking is on the back of the restaurant and is limited.The interior is typical with comfortable seating. Exhaust is non existent. The service was efficient.  The Jalapeños margarita is a lime margarita with a little kick. For $20 it's a good deal for 3 or 4person. The habenero wings were super spicy but so tasty. I did miss a little tangy taste to it.  The chicken tacos were tasty. The tilapia tacos were tasty but could use a little kick. The chipotle chicken had the smoky fresh chipotle chillies and the chicken was succulent and flavorful.  The pepper lime chicken was tasty and spicy after I asked them to make it spicy and I didn't regret it. The mucho burros was tasty for a vegetarian dish.  Overall a decent outing, fairly priced and worth a repeat."}
{"text":"Torn between a 3 and a 4.  Drinks were good, and food was kind of hit or miss.    Some opinions:  Mexican rice was much better than cilantro lime rice, and the chicken was a bit dry."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend craving guacamole.  We ended up getting a huge bowl of guac made spicy with crabmeat!! SO good and cheap! We also got the tacos also very good and cheap! Def coming back!"}
{"text":"While Noël Teel, Mogan and I were on our day trip to Cleveland we opted to eat dinner at El Torito Taqueria Bar & Grill in Lakewood area. It was a little hard to find at first and slightly small. The parking lot is in the rear and I found it to be a little tight. At least there is a rear entrance, which was convenient.  We arrived around 7 pm on a Saturday night and thank goodness no reservations were required. They were busy but able to get us a table about midway in. The music was extremely loud, so with all the talk, it was definitely  extremely loud in there. We went for a shared appetizer of chips with queso cheese and something that they call Spicy Balls...waitress said it was there number uno appetizer. It was spicy and good. Definitely a great choice because we all enjoyed them. I went with a Taqueria platter of one each of chicken, steak and pork...very good. The girls chose the same thing, a platter of tacos with chips and cheese on the side...with sodas for everyone...I would eat here again and again..."}
{"text":"Great restaurant. Great food. Great service.   Was not expecting to eat such different Mexican food. I'm so used to the burritos, tacos, quesadillas, that I get at every other Mexican restaurant.  This was the first place I've been to that was different and good!  The prices are a little higher than what you would pay at any other Mexican place but it's well worth it. The bathrooms were very clean and well maintained. The only thing I would say they change is to add a kids menu.  The waiter was very nice, and got us everything we needed.  We live in Cuyahoga falls and will definitely be driving the 45 minutes to go back for more!"}
{"text":"One of the best places in CLE to get Mexican! Hands down (and up as I surrendered to the great food!)! Friendly, warm welcoming front of the house staff....back of the house had great vibes as well!!! Evident in the food they sent out! It was delicious!"}
{"text":"Good margaritas, but chicken was dry. The salsa was good but not up to the standards of Luchitas or El Jalapenos. Wait time for service was a bit much for a place that was mostly empty. We might go again at some point."}
{"text":"Best Mexican Columbian South American food in Cleveland!  No \"mexican - restaurant slop\" here.  True cuisine yet all the friendliness and excellent service you would hope for.  Reasonable pricing and nice bar fast service.  Have been there twice and both times the experience was identically pleasing."}
{"text":"Great food, great atmosphere... The people are nice and the prices are reasonable... For Game Seven this is where I chose to watch and they were terrific.. Great Cleveland Sports Vibe!!!!"}
{"text":"The server was amazing and attentive. I was worried we would have to wait but the restaurant was very busy and the staff hustled to make sure El Torito had the BEST service. It was outstanding and I will bring family and friends here more."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. So first best server ever ask for that cutie Bianca B. She will take care of everything. Best food ever and let's talk about those margaritas. Get a monster it will last you all night. Thanks again Bianca you need a raise your the best!!!!"}
{"text":"First time visitor and was definitely impressed. Pretty authentic menu with plenty of options and specials.   Started with Margaritas. We were a little apprehensive about the jalapeño but our server recommended adding a little peach and it was awesome. Not too spicy. For lunch my friend and I each ordered two tacos and sides of guac. The meat was excellent and simply came with cilantro and onion.    Will definitely be coming back :)"}
{"text":"Brought the whole family here for dinner a couple nights ago because I had a Groupon for 4 people. And, I've heard the place is excellent. We all loved it, everyone ordered something different and the presentation of each dish was very nice. It was a little fancier than your typical Mexican food. Although the atmosphere wasn't fancy, the food was great. The prices are a few dollars higher than most Mexican places, but I felt that it was all worth the price, as the portions were huge. The chips and salsa were great. There's a small parking lot behind the building, so unless it is packed parking shouldn't be a problem. And our waiter was super nice, along with everyone else who greeted us."}
{"text":"Awful. The Carnitas was 50% fat. The food was cold. The well done steak came out medium rare at best. The flavors are lousy. The waitress never shows up so you can't get your food fixed or give any feedback. The most disgusting Mexican food I've ever had. Really."}
{"text":"Very nice place and really friendly staff. I got the Fajita Tijuana and the wife got the seafood house special and both were outstanding! Chips and salsa are good as well, also tried the crab guacamole which the wife loved but I thought it was a bit bland. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Drinks are great, the chips and salsa are delicious, the tacos are 5/10 - Not bad, but not that great. It was a nice experience, great staff although we were the only table in there at the time. Will not return but overall a ice experience"}
{"text":"I've been here twice now, tried 5 different taco meats and a handful of other stuff, and I have to say, everything I've tried was good.  Took a large party here, they were very accommodating. A friend got fried plantains topped with chorizo and that was excellent. I got three tacos, lengua, carne asada, and al pastor. Al pastor is usually my favorite kind of taco, but of the three it was my least favorite. Not enough to knock it down a star, though. The lengua was perfect. Just absolutely fantastic.  On a second trip, I just got three tacos to go. Barbacoa was excellent, as was the carnitas. Had to get another lengua.  Prices are reasonable, but not cheap, but this is Cleveland, not Bakersfield, so I don't expect to find Mexican food of this quality for less pretty much anywhere.  Absolutely refreshing to have a taste of home right around the block from me."}
{"text":"Stopped by on a Wednesday night, the place was dead which always worries me.  But the food was good.  I got the shrimp fajitas, which were good.  I liked the shrimp were good sized and there were a ton of veggies.  I felt like it was worth what I paid for.  It also came out supper fast.  I would returns."}
{"text":"This place continually surprises me. While the service can be spotty as far as promptness goes, the staff is always friendly. The monfongitos are so unique and not served anywhere else in the area that I'm aware of. Their meat in each of the three dishes I've tried is excellent and fresh."}
{"text":"My first Uber Eats experience was with El Torito - and it was fantastic.  I ordered the 3 steak tacos and everything was great.  Tons of pico de gallo and white cilantro rice on the side or for topping the tacos.  I really enjoyed the fresh chips and salsa too.  Great flavors and freshness.  Can't wait to dine in here."}
{"text":"Been here twice. The seafood chimichangas are very good. Real shrimp, fake crab, cheesy and authentic flavors. Love their Mexican rice! My qualm, as with all other mexican restaurants I've been to all sides of CLE is, dry, overcooked steak For el Torito, I'm referring to their steak taco. Is overcooked steak a prerequisite for mexi restaurants, or is it just that they cook it up ahead of time in the morning so as to push it out quickly when ordered? Not sure, but if I could find a mexican restaurant that serves up great tasting steak however prepared - fajiitas, burrito, tacos etc.), we'd be there several times monthly.  their atmosphere and service are good. chips/salsa excellent - mild but they have 3 hot sauces on the tables to heat things up."}
{"text":"Great food, friendly staff. Specials are good during the week. Jalapeño margs were fire!!!"}
{"text":"Service took almost an hour to come and when it did, the fajitas were just warm, no sizzle to be appreciated. The enchiladas supremas were ok in taste but nothing spectacular. The cilantro lime rice was the best part of that meal. The plantains I've never seen prepared like they were here, it resembled more of a tortilla made out of plantains. Too thick to be a chip but not thick enough to be tostones. The accompanying garlic sauce also lacked flavor and salt. The best part of the meal was the passion fruit ice cream that they made complimentary for our wait. It was just the right amount of sweetness with a slight tang from the passionfruit. This place left much to be desired."}
{"text":"This is honestly the best mexican food i have tasted in my life so far, super authentic, not cookie cutter and amazing service! They have many different types of margaritas! My boyfriend and I had the 1/2 pitcher of jalepeno margaritas which sounded a little intimidating but they were PERFECTLY mixed! SO GOOD, i would highly suggest it thid restaraunt (:"}
{"text":"As if Lakewood needed another taco place!  No, we really didn't, but we're certainly glad that this place has come along! While I am still an ardent fan of Villa y Zapata, El Torito adds a few more things to the mix here. El Torito serves some really incredible and authentic Mexican street food. I mean, there aren't many places that offer cabeza or lingua on the menu and while those things do not appeal to me, my friend, who is a trained chef was certainly all over these items.  All of the offerings were fresh and flavourful without being the least bit overdone. The staff was friendly and really added to the vibe of the place. I will definitely be back soon.  Do yourselves a favour and add this place to the list (and please stop going to Cozumel and El Jalapeno)!!!"}
{"text":"Four stars because 'nothing is perfect.' El Torito is a wonderful Mexican restaurant, in Cleveland of all places. Not bad food for Middle America.  This is coming from a Californian. The only major complaints were by our baby mommas who were not happy that there was no changing station in the bathrooms.  Oh, the AC was struggling, too, so our complaints were more pertinent to the ambiance and facilities. The food was tasty. Huge portions. Good Margaritas, michelada, and horchatas. Very good horchatas here. The salsa is good. And Ana was a wonderful server."}
{"text":"Nice lil spot with a deceiving appearance out side. Clean and open, good food and a good selection of liquors! Anna was great!"}
{"text":"The presentation of the food was great. Unfortunately the taste didn't live up to the expectations that were set. The chips tasted like plastic. Upon seeing the sign advertising margaritas for 8.99 and second one for .99 my dinner companion and I ordered 2 each. When we received our bill we were charged full price. I brought it the servers attention only to be told that since we ordered strawberry they didn't qualify. Apparently the special was only for lime. Although the sign didn't specify. We will not be dining here again. Cozumel is where it's at for me."}
{"text":"Excellent food and tremendous mojitos... would def visit this place again! I had the fish tacos which were amazing, we had the guacamole and a chicken creme dish. After eating all of my tacos I started eating my boyfriends food!!! Definitely will go back and look forward to it!"}
{"text":"The chorizo fireballs were really good!  Almost too rich, but delicious enough that we couldn't stop eating them.  Had the seafood chimichangas (actual real, fresh crab and shrimp), and the calamari tacos... which were decent but slightly overcooked... and missing something almost?  Overall had a great time and I will certainly be back... The food was very modestly priced for the quantity and quality, but the highlight has to be the charro beans... those damned delicious beans are like bacon heaven, those alone made it all worthwhile!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place. The menu is diverse and the dishes are pretty inventive, at times.  We ordered a margarita pitcher and watched the Cavs game over dinner. They served chips and salsa to start. The salsa was delicious and semi spicy.  As an appetizer, we ordered the chorizo bomb bites. The combo of cream cheese and spicy chorizo were heaven in my mouth. My entree was the paella. It was a huge portion at a decent price. Other than being a little salty, it was quite good. I mixed my leftovers with rice at home and that solved the salty problem. The dish included clams, scallops, shrimp and other seafood.   My bf got the chipotle chicken and enjoyed the spiciness and rich flavors.  We both had the flan for dessert and it was wonderful!  Definitely gonna check this place out again soon!"}
{"text":"Wow I was slightly disappointed. DISCLAIMER - I love the tex-mex kinda style (like Barrio) Mexican food. So this may be very authentic Mexican and I could just not like it.   FOOD: With that said, I ordered 3 tacos...Each with three different kinds of meat (beef, pork, and some other one I can't remember). Very dry, bland, nothing on the taco. That was a huge surprise, a plain taco? Plus it was a corn tortilla. I didn't see the option to choose flour, but if I had known it would be corn, I definitely would have chosen flour.   DRINKS: The drinks are what brought this up from a 2 star review. I don't know where else you can get a pineapple drink in a pineapple, but man that was pretty cool. A little pricey, but a huge drink.   PS - parking was packed in the back, so heads up, carpool or look across the street maybe?  Overall, I don't think I would give this a second try. Just not my kind of Mexican."}
{"text":"Move over barrios! This place is ten times better. Came here twice to try the tacos. They're as good as the authentic tacos in cities like LA or San Fran. Beautiful presentation too. Dark, cool atmosphere and the waiters are really friendly and chill. Great for a date. Prices good. Taco Tuesday specials. Check it out! Ample parking too."}
{"text":"This place is quickly becoming a favorite of mine recently!  The food is very good and they have a very good drink menu.  Pricing is reasonable compared to the competition around. The staff is very friendly and they have done a great job renovating the staff. It's a nice new alternative to the Latin food options in the area."}
{"text":"Have been here a few times, doesn't disappoint. The service is great! The staff is extra hospitable and the food is amazing. The drinks are delicious."}
{"text":"Overall, El Torito was OK. Hit and miss on the food. Monfongitos appetizer - chorizo and shrimp were tasty, beef was dried out salty and tasted as if the beef had been cooked repeatedly over the last day or two. Torito sampler platter was passable. A ton of OK nachos, fried and cheese stuffed food - hard to mess up too bad. Also had the seafood chimichanga. Pretty decent overall, but were not crispy as a chimichanga should be and more like a soggy burrito. Flavor-wise it was good, and I actually ate more than I expected to. And that's even with the imitation crab that was a surprise in there. Charro beans and cilantro lime rice were some of the freshest tasting Mexican fare we've had in town. Margaritas were excellent. Service was lacking at times."}
{"text":"Meat lovers, rejoice! What a great addition to the neighborhood. The service was excellent,  our waters were always kept full and our server was very friendly. I had the Gringas and I would suggest you get it too. For $4.50 the thing was huge! Almost too much el pastor, but who am I kidding? My boyfriend got plantains with chorizo he was planning on taking half home but ended up eating the rest of it out of the to go box after he had already packed it up. So what does THAT tell you? I certainly plan on coming back, and getting one of their margaritas... that they serve to you inside a whole pineapple!"}
{"text":"Was in the area, decided to try it. Excellent! 5 in our party, had a wide variety of stuff. Everyone loved their choice. Portion sizes are bigger than your head. Ok not really, but you will need to be rolled out of here because they are really big. They dont skimp on the meat. All meals 10 to 15 dollars ish."}
{"text":"****update... Went in 3/19. Food was lacking flavor and something made me horribly sick all night! Never again!! **************************In a word, amazing! As a long time Tex Mex. fan if heard this was a step up from most and that, is an understatement. Starts out typical with chips and salsa but that is where typical stops. I had the pomegranate mojito and it was perfect! Moved on too the traditional guac. It was served with lime which when squeezed on the guac makes it beyond sublime. My meal was the lunch burrito bowl with spinach. The presentation was impressive but the flavors were magnificent !! All in all a dynamite place not too be missed!!"}
{"text":"my wife and I came here and shared the chicken fajitas which were very flavorful, very plentiful  with lots of peppers and onions as well as the condiments that it came with. the refried beans had a good flavor as well as the flavored rice. the atmosphere in the restaurant was clan modern decor.the staff was very friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"So delicious and staff is always so friendly!  Thursday night = buy one lime margarita get one for $.99...hello!!!  Can't beat that."}
{"text":"A perfect experience! The staff was very nice and the food was amazing!  The power went out half way through out meal. There was a storm and I'm sure the whole neighborhood went out. They have great back up lights though!  Our server was quick to replace the many trays of chips and salsa that we devoured. I forget the name of the dish but I ordered a large fajita dish. It came out sizzling in a huge pig rock bowl. Superb presentation with enough food to feed 3 people. Or one me . And it wasn't 90% vegetables 10% meat like other places in the area to to pawn off. I had flan for desert and it tasted just as amazing as it looked. Easily my favorite Mexican place in lakewood."}
{"text":"One of my new go to spots in cleveland. The prices are beyond reasonable considering how fresh flaborful and authentic this place is! I got the plantains with shredded chicken...and i was blown away by the combination of savory spicy and citrusy. Everything down to the lettuce and guac on the plate was crispy and fresh. I love how the guac had ton of lime and cilantro...the way guac should be made! Also they have incredible margaritas that must be house made...because they arent too sweet and they taste very natural. Also..they have happy hour on weekend evenings! I cant wait to go back here..I'd like to try the tongue tacos. Only downside is the menu doesnt have many vegetarian options."}
{"text":"Easily the best Mexican restaurant in the area now! The food is fantastic and the portions are HUGE. Good luck leaving without taking some of your meal home. The restaurant does not look like much from the outside, but the inside is very well done and updated. They also have a full bar with awesome drinks. We'll definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"We went in for dinner with a weekly mailer coupon, ordered the chalkboard appetizer special, drinks and two dinners. The server charged us full price for the appetizer because we had the weekly mailer coupon. Way to make new customers not return.I don't see this place lasting"}
{"text":"I don't like to write reviews that aren't all about how wonderful a restaurant is...but my husband and I have had dinner at El Torito many times and our experience recently was a disappointment.  I hope they make some changes to go back the way it used to be.  For starters...our waitress was very pleasant and attentive.  It seems that they have new staff?  The handsome man that always took care of us before wasn't there.  And we didn't recognize the bartender either.  Not that any of that matters, but if the restaurant is under new management or ownership...they have some things to work on.  Our margaritas were not as good as they used to be which was such a bummer...we loved their margaritas.  They were too sweet.  So much so that I barely drank mine - shame as 2 drinks came to almost $18.00.  Our appetizer was brought to the table and immediately the entrees arrived as well.  This was a first for us.  We barely touched the appetizer so that our entrees wouldn't get cold.    Our order was Monfongitos - we chose beef but you can have shrimp or chorizo.  The flavor was ok, but you could barely cut through it.  We each had a little bite and then set it aside to eat our dinner entrees.  I had the Chimichangas which is my favorite, but it wasn't as fresh as it used to be. The beef filling was different, and the quacamole looked a bit \"old\" .  My husband had the Enchiladas and again not as fresh and looked really \"flat\" the presentation was kind of sad to be honest.  Our first batch of salsa that came with the chips had no flavor although we at it because we were so hungry.  The 2nd round of salsa was a little better...weird.  This restaurant was one of our favs that we would often recommend to others.  We hope they can work out the kinks."}
{"text":"The margaritas are huge!  I ordered the strawberry jalapeño margarita it was delicious. Everything on the menu looked really good. I would have given this place 5 stars if they had more options for vegetations. My husband who is a vegetation could only order one thing with out meat. (Vegetable burrito) And we also had to wait 30 mins for our food that I thought was odd for a Mexican restaurant that wasn't very busy at 230 in the afternoon."}
{"text":"Finally, a good Mexican place in Ctown!!!  The husband and I went for lunch on Saturday and left impressed.  Their chips are great and their salsa is fantastic.  Usually when we go to a Mexican place in the area, the salsa is mediocre at best.  Not here, I'm happy to report!  I had a jalepeno margarita which was delicious, and the husband had a reposado marg, also delicious.  For my entree I had the only vegetarian thing on the menu, the burrito with grilled veggies and it was gigantic and fantastic.  The husband had the shrimp diablo which he raved about.  I tried the sauce and literally couldn't stop eating it.  It was that good.  It was spicy and tasty and just amazing.  Next time I go I will ask if I can get a side of that sauce.  Service was friendly and quick.  Do yourself a favor and eat here.  Now."}
{"text":"It was ok i had the steak tacos with a strawberry margarita.  Tacos nothing special they came with avocado and a side of side salad and steam rice( it tasted just like the one you get when u get chinese) i dont see the connection between the tacos, steam rice and a side salad with reduced balsamic just a weird mix between chinese, mexican and italian.  I'd be back only to get drinks not for food!!"}
{"text":"If you were driving down the street you would most likely go right past this place....and that may be okay!  The best part about our experience this evening was the music.    The food was average, and slightly overpriced for what it was.  But the service, the service was terrible!  There were a total of 6 guests, 2 servers, and a bartender.  Our server had 2 tables which was apparently too much for her to handle.  Not sure there will be a next time, but we may just try the drinks."}
{"text":"What an amazing spot!  My fiance and I found ourselves scurrying into this spot for a quick bite after grocery shopping and I'm so glad we did!  The help is super friendly and attentive. The interior is well kept and fun. The frozen margaritas are amazing and they have several different flavors!  I ordered the enchiladas verdes and my dude ordered the chimichangas. Both were phenomenal and we can't wait to go back for more. The pricing is affordable and the amount of food and quality explains itself."}
{"text":"El Torito Taqueria Bar my favorite Mexican Restaurant. Super friendly staff, Food is absolutely delicious. Margarita's are out of this world. Reasonably priced. Parking is limited so get here early enough for a spot."}
{"text":"So i took my hottie out for a bite last night at El Torito, and once again that place didn't disappoint!! Much different menus than Cozumel, Nuevo Acapulco and other Mexican restaurants that seem to share the same menu...  For starters, we had Mofonguitos, basically a fried plantain cup filled with butter sauteed shrimp, cilantro and cheese served on a bed of Avocado - FUCKIN YUM!!! (Devoured them! No photo)   I had the Carne Asada w/cilantro lime rice, avocado and salad w/tortillas and she had Bacon Wrapped shrimp on a bad of grilled peppers with cilantro lime rice, avocado and pico de gallo beans as well. delicious,  i HIGHLY  recommend this place - I added photos to this location"}
{"text":"The food was delicious. We had appetizers and the portions were very generous. Our service was outstanding. I seriously want to eat here every day."}
{"text":"Authentic and uniquely different than the traditional Mexican joint.  Everything on the menu has a slight twist on the standard counterpart so it's a refreshing mix from the usual.  Very reasonably priced with a friendly staff.  Only complaint is a poor selection of hot sauces at the table.  Been back and will be again."}
{"text":"Saw a lot of great reviews.   This place did not disappoint.   Chimichangas were excellent."}
{"text":"Food was delicious.  Came out very quickly.  Service was great. Very friendly. Margaritas were extremely tasty.  Will definitely be back very soon!!"}
{"text":"Service is wonderful. They're on top of your drinks and very kind. Food is delicious. Authentic Mexican food. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great! Best Mexican food in Cleveland by far!!! I had the Mar Y Tierra. Superb flavors! The salad was dressed in balsamic vinegar & honey...Just wished I had more!!! Highly recommend this place! They have happy hour specials too!"}
{"text":"It's more like 3.5 stars. The complimentary chips and salsa was good! We had the harbenaro chicken wings, which was HOT but good if you can handle the heat. The fajita and mucho burro was okay. Portions are huge. Customer service is great too."}
{"text":"Wow, this was really delicious.  If you are looking for straight up Mexican food, this is your place.  I had the enchiladas verde and they were great.  The shredded chicken inside was seasoned so well.  My favorite part was the charro beans.  They were so good, cooked perfectly with bacon.  I also had a spicy mango margaita.  This was about your standard Mexican restaurant marg.  It came in a large glass and was made feom a mix.  My husband got the pineapple margarita and it came in a pineapple, which was cool.   Also, the service was outstanding.  I would definitely visit again."}
{"text":"As a self proclaimed Mexican food/taco expert, I have to give this place 5 stars. My first experience here started off a little rocky, but have been so impressed with everything that this has easily become one of my absolute favorite spots for some authentic Mexican food. I first tried this place on my birthday this past March. They had just recently opened and were getting into the swing of things. I called about a week in advance to make a reservation as we had 14 people, which they said they could accommodate. When we arrived, they seemed to have no knowledge of a reservation,  it quickly scrambled to find us a spot. The place was packed, but they were able to give us two tables near each other. Once seated, I ordered a margarita that was served inside a pineapple! It was awesome. Our food took quite a while to arrive, but we were given a bunch of free appetizers as an apology. The chorizo fireballs are to die for, so I was happy. The food overall is excellent.       After the few hiccups we experienced here on the first try, I decided to come back again a few months later. This time, the place was crowded, but not packed. We were seated right away and ordered a pitcher of margaritas to share. The margaritas are good in my book. Our service was great, food was amazing, and this place was solidified as a regular option for me. Definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"This place is a real hidden gem. Everything here was so good. I had tacos, guacamole, some kind of cheese dip something, some other appetizers, and the Margarita inside of a pineapple. Everything was so delicious like I don't think that you could be disappointed anything you order it on the menu. The staff is so hard-working and friendly. I definitely will be going back in the future."}
{"text":"I had ordered 2 bowls of chicken soup for delivery off of uber eats and what I received was 2 giant containers of soup not barely full... One has a very little amount and one is over half filled... I also made a note to give me 2 of the biggest sizes when I placed the order... So receiving this really bummed me out... $20 including delivery for this ????? Save your money.."}
{"text":"My girlfriend lives in Lakewood and we decided to give this place a shot. Got the fajitas which were good but nothing about this place really stood out to us. If you live in the area, nice place to grab a quick Mexican dinner but not life changing."}
{"text":"I was really surprised and impressed by El Torito. We live on the east side of Lakewood so we were able to walk here, so you can guarantee that I will be back.  When you first see the outside of the building, you may feel kind of skeptical about the place.  I know I did, but do not let the exterior fool you from coming in.   After we came in through the back door, we saw that the place was clean and looked like a modern Mexican restaurant with a really nice bar area.  We sat at a table and ordered the infamous pineapple margarita.  It came in a fresh pineapple and has fresh limes and lemons in it.  There were 5-6 big, fresh pineapple slices on top and the rim was seasoned with sea salt and a cayenne pepper.  It was amazing, but not cheap so we only got one.   Food wise, I highly recommend the chorizo fireballs and the plantains.  This was all I ordered cause I got so full on chips and salsa.  The chorizo fireballs were fried balls of cream cheese with chorizo and jalapenos served with a cilantro mayo drizzled on the side.  They were breaded and fried perfectly and I loved the sauce served with it.  The side of plantains were amazing and so worth the $4.  You get 3 or 4 large plantains and is served with a queso sauce that had some melted butter on top.  I did not even know this queso dip was served with it, but it was delicious.   The service was great and everyone was very friendly and attentive.  SO glad we tried this place."}
{"text":"Great drinks. Fairly authentic tacos. Get the chorizo fireballs or mofungitos and thank me later."}
{"text":"Ordered on Uber eats. Super fast delivery. We ordered the chicken chimichangas and the chicken was absolutely delicious. Habanero wings were interesting and had a good after kick. Great spot and good prices."}
{"text":"Didn't feel like waiting 45 minutes on a Friday night to eat at a Mexican place in Ohio city and after comparing menus my boyfriend was craving fajitas which the other hipster Mexican place didn't have. There was no wait, he loved his fajitas and still had enough to take home. I loved my tacqueria plater (3 tacos). I was very happy I could order soft corn tortillas because my body doesn't always agree with  flour tortillas. I ordered a froZen margarita for 8.99 and it was THE BIGGEST margarita I have ever had and it was delicious (like flavor). Great spot with good food, great service, and no worries of the Ohio city/Tremont/downtown craziness unless you are in the mood for that which is fine. We were just too hungry to care about the \"scene\"."}
{"text":"Without question this was one of the best Mexican meals I've ever had. Don't be fooled by the bland exterior of El Torito from the interior atmosphere to the quick, friendly service to the amazing food my family and I loved our visit.  With a recommendation from our server we started with the Chorizo fire balls. They were a must try, crispy on the outside and a creamy, cheesy center with the perfect amount of fire they were worth the trip all by themselves.  As is standard for any Mexican restaurant they brought us chips and salsa to the table and it was hard not to fill up. The chips were warm and perfectly crispy and we had to order 3 bowls of their salsa.  The habanero wings are great but pack A LOT of heat so for those of you with delicate palletes you've been warned. It also comes with a Margarita shot that will make you want to order a pitcher  The shrimp tacos were delicious with Pico de gayo and perfectly cooked and seasoned shrimp along side a fantastic little salad.  I ordered the Chorizo mucho burro which was packed with flavor, came with Pineapple which seemed weird before I tried it but gave a wonderful savory/sweet flavor, and was covered in a white cheese sauce, but none of that is not it's main feature... the thing was the size of my forearm! It ended up making for two very sizable, and delicious, meals.  El Torito is now my family's go to Mexican restaurant (even though we're on the other side of town) and I look forward to talking out of town guests there to show them one of the best tastes of Cleveland!"}
{"text":"Finally! A good authentic Mexican place in Cleveland. If you're looking for real Mexican, not the frilly mod Mex - this is your spot.   I wish they could figure out how to make the frozen margaritas less sweet, but it's hard to find a place who can figure that out."}
{"text":"Ordered a house Margarita. It came out and was so spicy that I couldn't even drink it. I asked my waitress if it was indeed a house margarita because it was so spicy. Needless to say I spent $10 on a drink I took one sip on. What got me is she asked if we had even been there before; I would think she would have informed me that their house margarita had jalapeño in it after stating that we've never been there. Food we decent; nothing to write home about. Waitress got an attitude after I asked about the margarita like I was putting her out."}
{"text":"I'm gonna be THAT person and admit I've only had their food delivered. So I can't speak to the inside of the restaurant at all.  But MY GOD those chicarrones are amazing.  Like, I consider myself something of a pork rind expert. And these are definitely vying for the top title.   The carne asada and shrimp tacos are both also really great -- perfect pico de gallo and seasoning. They come with homemade guacamole on the side, that I promise won't stay on the side very long! :)  I think they have Groupons often and I definitely recommend giving the place a shot (if you find it intimidating, order from Uber!)"}
{"text":"I ran across this restaurant because i was really craving good mexican food. I went here on a wednesday night they had food and drink specials. $5 off any steak or chicken fajitas only and $10 for a whole pitcher of their lime margarita. It was pretty steady for a wednesday night and we got seated immediately. Soon as we were seated the server came with chips and salsa and asked us for drinks. I got the pitcher deal. The pitcher itself wasn't large but it wasn't very small. It felt as though the drink was little bit on the lighter side. You couldn't taste the alcohol and it didn't have a tasty flavor to it. It was just alright. The chips was very good and came out warm, but as for the salsa it was pretty plain. I did order their side of their hottest sauce and I preferred that to dip it as salsa because it was flavorful and spicy.  For appetizer I got the chorizo fireballs. I personally did not like this appetizer because I am not fan of cream cheese but my partner seemed to enjoy it! For dinner I ordered the steak fajitas and it came with rice, lettuce, tortillas and refried beans. The steak fajitas came out warm in a sizzler. It was delicious. Overall the service is very nice, the food are better than other mexican restaurants, and they have food and drink specials. I will come back and try other items in the menu."}
{"text":"I visited this restaurant on a Saturday after 6pm. My friends and I were seated right away. I ordered seafood chimichangas...yum yum give me some MORE! It was damn good and the drinks were strong. Will visit again."}
{"text":"I have to admit I was a skeptic walking into a restaurant on W117th St. I don't think I've ever done that before. I was sure it wouldn't be good, but I was happily proven wrong.   The interior is much nicer than the exterior. It takes on a homey feel, not owing to warm decor, but because the furnishings don't scream commercial. It felt like someone went to Home Depot and did a weekend DIY project of remodeling the restaurant. But it was clean and new and everything was in good condition so no complaints.   There is a big margarita menu. We got a pitcher of the jalapeño margarita which we were told is basically a lime margarita with jalapeño in it. The waitress we had told us the pitcher gets an entire pepper put in it, cut into slices and dropped into the liquid, where an individual glass gets one ring. When I first tasted the drink I didn't get any heat out of it. As the meal progressed though and the peppers soaked in the drink, the flavor became more noticeable - always enjoyable, never too hot.   I started my meal with an \"arepitas.\" The base was a grilled white corn arepa, topped with cheese, cilantro and your choice of meat and mayo. We chose the cilantro lime mayo over the pink mayo (ketchup + mayo) and got chorizo. The arepa comes in two halves, which makes it slightly hard to share, but the flavor was really wonderful and I would most certainly order this again. Since most of the meals are quite larger, the portion size of the appetizer was appropriately smaller.   For my meal I got the Enchilada Supremas which comes with 4 enchiladas: cheese, chicken, beef and bean. The waitress allowed me to swap out the cheese for another chicken. The chicken ended up being my favorite followed by the beef so I was glad I made the swap. The cheese enchilada appeared to be stuffed with the same cheese that was drizzled over the entire plate, so you're not missing much if you skip it. I was also pleasantly surprised with the dish's presentation. The enchiladas were not drowned in sauces as so often is the case. This entree came with a choice of rice (Mexican rice or cilantro lime) and beans (refried beans or charro beans). I got to try both rices as what I initially ordered wasn't sent out from the kitchen. I have to say the Mexican was my favorite. The cilantro lime was also good, maybe rivaling Chipotle. The refried beans were basic as you'd get anywhere - the charro beans are the specialty ones cooked with corn and bacon to give a smoky flavor.   The service was really attentive, perhaps too attentive. The server checked back to see how everything was several times before our food came out when there was really nothing to check on. However, she did a lot of good things too, which again for this restaurant surprised me. She initially filled our three marg glasses instead of just dropping off the pitcher and she stopped back at the table a couple more times to top up the glasses. She was super friendly, able to explain the menu items and offered up what her personal favorites were.  When it comes down to it the food is the most important thing. So while there are a few things this restaurant could work on, the food, out of all the Mexican places that I have eaten recently, stands out as the best.   That said, one thing I think this restaurant could work on in addition to what's said above is the payment process. Guests' paying with a chip card are required to come up to the host stand to complete the transaction because they don't have a portable POS system."}
