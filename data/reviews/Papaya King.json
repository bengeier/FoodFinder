{"text":"Had to stop by and try it for Kramer! 9 remember seeing this in an episode of Seinfeld and always wanted to try it. $1 hotdogs!!! Can't beat that, it was definitely worth the couple dollars. If I'm ever walking near and have a couple dollars to spare I'll make a quick stop."}

Nice guys...also work out a bathroom key system so that production doesn't come to a halt when customers need to get in the bathroom.  
The hula hula is the best!!"}

4 people was almost 80.00 and so not worth it. They got our entire order wrong several times., our kinish  wasnt ready  till we were basically walking out).
But the worst offense...the buns were awful and stale, on every hotdog...

So disappointing as I love the one in NYC..
Will not go back..."}

{"text":"Dined here yesterday, pretty scary, smell of stale cooking oil through out. Server was wearing rubber gloves  handling money then handled the hot dog rolls. When made mention of this other staff shrugged shoulders, server changed gloves. Hot dogs were cold and over done and probably sitting for a long time. Bacon and fried onion toppings were not pleasant. Rolls were fresh. Soda fountain was sticking from syrup. 
Hope this helps everyone!"}

Helping me cure my home sick feelings only thing I need now is a real fresh bialy plain and on the bone prosciutto and I'd be set...well can you throw in Jones Beach and South Street Seaport with a touch of the garment district street vendors?OK I'll wake up in in Vegas but until I go back to NYC I can taste it here and you should too."}
{"text":"My first time to try this place and am totally disappointed.  The hotdog was mediocre at best but CUSTOMER SERVICE WAS HORRIBLE!  This establishment does not even provide water, so I was trying to change my order to get the meal with the drink,  but they wanted me to pay for both because they already punched it in... Before I'm even done ordering!  They may be big in New York but this kind of service won't go far in this town where there's plenty of other better choices!"}

{"text":"My wife and I stepped in and ordered a couple of drinks 3 dogs and a fry.  We entered just as the only other person in the store was picking up her food. In the intervening several minutes 4 or 5 people walked in and received their food. 
Being curious I walked up to the girl who took my order asking if my order had been forgotten. She said what order???? After explaing my order to the group that had gathered behind the counter I asked how an order entered into a POS system could just be lost? 
At this point another guy appears from the back and said they just get lost sometimes. When I asked for further explanation he just yelled they were helping to the best of their ability.
Long story short don't waste your time. There is Dog Haus across the street and Steamie Weenie in Green Valley."}
{"text":"If you're homesick for a NYC dog with NY style onions in sauce then this is the place to get your fix. I think they are best with mustard onion and sauerkraut. Top it all off with one of their delicious papaya drinks and you're back in midtown."}
{"text":"I personally like the veggie dogs from here. They are probably the same as from the grocery store. They are small. Snack size. Good if I'm starving after work or b4 the gym. Not good for a meal unless you eat several. I ordered one like the picture and of course it barely had a topping. (Toppings are .75 extra) The coconut drink I had was good but tasted like 100% sugar. I wouldn't go out of my way for this. It's not like Pinks. Then again.. Pinks is usually $25 a meal and this place is about $6."}
{"text":"This place was horrible.  The employee was super sweet but the chili cheese dog was the worst I have ever had. My chili had the consistency and taste of refried beans and my weiner was beyond cooked. It was old, hard and has the consistency of cardboard. $8 wasted."}

{"text":"Was very excited to try this place for a long time. Walked in said hi to the cashier and he did not say a thing. Got a chili dog and a smoothie. The chili was cold, it was weird. Only took two bites and stopped. My smoothie was room temperature juice. Was disappointed for sure but I gave them a pass because it is a new business...until the next day. Woke up with violent diarrhea and was not able to go to work. NEVER AGAIN! 

P.S. The customer in front of us was a New Yorker and he spit his dog out of his mouth. And said \"They are suppose to snap when you bite into them, this is not like PapyaKing in NYC\""}
{"text":"The buns were extremely dry...
Need a method to keep the buns soft and fresh.
Really an important point-must correct that immediately..."}
{"text":"Who doesn't love a cheap, Strip-adjacent meal?! And it's another hotdog chain to add to the list including Dog Haus and Dirt Dog. Also add it to the list of business moving here from NYC with Halal Guys and Shake Shack. I have no previous experience with this chain, but I wasn't really impressed. Seems like it would be a hit after a night of drinking, though.

All specialty dogs are $4. I guess that's not ridiculous, like White Castle's Strip price markup, but note that NY locations price the dogs lower and it varies by dog, which makes sense given the variety of ingredients. Plus this location isn't even on the Strip, so...?

Their slogan is, \"It's all about the snap!\" and mine didn't have much. The Pig in Da Blanket, with cheese, bacon, and grilled peppers, was okay, but not something I'd go out of my way for.  Surprisingly, I enjoyed my tropical drink (Coconut Champagne) more, would try others. Note that their cocktail menu is currently not available yet!"}
{"text":"I was so excited to see that Papaya King was coming to Las Vegas! When I was living in New York there was nothing like a red onion slathered hotdog with some sauerkraut and some fresh coconut pineapple juice made fresh every day! And this place did not disappoint. It's not a watered down version of what you find in New York City it's the real deal! I'm so excited that they're here now and I'll be eating there every month religiously!"}
{"text":"The Best Hot Dog and Curly Fries in Las Vegas.
Fast service reasonable prices.
Very clean.
Friendly staff.
It's a Vegas MUST VISIT."}
{"text":"Not worth the price and presentation was not appealing. The place was empty even though there was events going on in the area. Good Reputation is what will get you by & this one doesn't have it yet. I didn't even get offered Bogo on onion rings on a Friday. Quite disappointing to find out on a huge lighted sign near the side walk by the street lights after you've ordered. That special should have been said right off the bat before they even take your order. 2 Thumbs down. Bypass the smoothies, mine wasn't even cold. Waste of your hard earned money."}
{"text":"They ran out of \"yard cups\" so the guy making drinks gave me a large cup plus a little side car for $10. Not a bad deal, especially because they use real fruit. It tasted a little light on the alcohol, so we added some of our own after. But I really did like that it was a real fruit smoothie with tequila. 

Papaya King is located next to the Marco Polo, in the \"Hawaiian marketplace\". I find the name a little offensive as nothing resembles hawaii. I'm 100% sure papaya king doesn't use Hawaiian papaya if they use papaya at all in their drinks. 

The guy making drinks was nice enough and it's nice that it's a little bar where you can sit to enjoy your cocktail. You can also watch them blend up your cocktail right there at the bar, which is different from all the other fake tasting dispenser slushee places on the strip. 

I'd come back to try other concoctions! And it's very centrally located!"}
{"text":"Dry small hotdogs. Fries are good. Place was empty. Not going back to this place. I was dissapointed. I dont understand the hype of my newyorker friends about this. I dont know if its just this place. But with the hotdog that tiny and dry.. who wants to eat there again??? Not me."}
{"text":"I was very excited to come here since I have been raving about the.NY stand for a year. I stopped in today, 8.8.17 for lunch, and the hot dogs were waaay over Cooked! We ordered 4 different kinds and every hot dog was over cooked and disgusting.

Not only that but the service attendant was not very enthusiastic about life in general let alone working at Papaya. I still tipped him some cash to see if maybe that turned things around and then he offered me a free cup of drink.

-1 star for bad service, -1 star for terrible, overcooked food, -1 star for value of food, -1 star for presentation of food (looked nothing like the photos unlike in NY) 
Which = 1 Star for cleanliness."}
{"text":"So this is the first time I've heard about this place.  My friends and coworkers were telling me about this place and it was close to me from home.

I went there almost at 10pm at night and the staff were really nice.  They wanted to make sure that I was greeted and they were ready to help me out. 

The cashier person was helping me out because I asked him what was so good about their hotdogs and which one should I choose?  He suggested for me to try out the Grand Slam Combo because I was able to choose from their specialty hotdog section.  I let him know that I wasn't so hungry for bigger hotdogs with lots of stuff so he suggested the King Combo and because I wanted chili he stated that I can substitute it from my Combo. 

Since from the time I came in to their store,I felt that the facility, staff, and food were all great to me.  So I've never had this place because it was made only in NYC where it's popular their and I've never been there YET. 

So after I received my meal, the amenities were located in many areas of the store to make it easier for customers to go and eat. Plus the food was served quickly. I like that the fact they were quick and they asked me if there's anything else that I needed. That's good service.

Last they made sure each customer were greeted each time people walked in the store.  

In my opinion with good employees, there will be a great people that will comeback more often."}
{"text":"Was the menu a little complicated? Maybe
Were the workers a little confused being a brand new system with a little complicated menu? Maybe
Were the dogs good? Most definitely.

This place does have a little complicated menu but I believe, in time, it will be very easy. It is just different then what people are used to ( including me )

I ordered the number 6 which is either two specialty dogs or three regular ones, drink, and fries.

I got two specialty dogs. The upper east side and the bulls eye. Both were bomb dot com

Oh, and the papaya drink was perfect to wash down such a tasty meal. 

Curly fries were good. 

People were really friendly. Except for one customer that was complaining that the dog wasn't centred on the bun. I thought he was joking at first but he wasn't. He started lecturing the kid about putting the dog on the bun right. I'm thinking he must've been an owner or investor but super unprofessional to do in front of everyone if he was. 

Place was good and people were nice. It would be a shame if that guy is the owner because I will not patronage a place where the owner lectures his employees in front of everyone. Let's hope it wasn't. I'll go back again to find out. Otherwise, there's another brand new place that also opened up just across the street."}
{"text":"I found Papaya King by accident and was hungry for something not too heavy. It was hot in Las Vegas. I walked in there was one customer and one of the employees eating. This was 3:30 in the afternoon. This is order and seats your self-place.

So I thought I give it a try. I ordered a hot dog with onions and a medium lemonade. I was asked if I wanted curly fries. I passed. 

What arrived was DISAPPOINTING the hot dog (small, like you, would get, buying at the grocery store) was smothered in a red sauce/onions. I guess the papaya sauce is supposed to be the key of this New York City eatery. This is their first outlet west of the Mississippi.

This eatery does offer food and drink combos and the prices are higher than they should be. I paid $7.00 for a medium lemonade (not hingspecial) and the hot dog!

Go someplace else."}
{"text":"Um yea.  I wanted to go because I was too lazy to walk across the street in Manhattan.  Let me tell you they just have a tone of fried food, hot dogs, and sugary smoothies.  It is ok at best."}
{"text":"lol literally how does this place exist. Drinks are super good and cheaper than back in Toledo Ohio anyways our bartender is playing jenga with us and keeps giving us shots is this review long enough now just come here"}
{"text":"Well, if you are in a hurry, then this place is definitely not for you! They service is really slow, and the workers do not seem to want to be there. There is no energy, or charm at all. 

The food is equivalent to what you could get at a food truck, but much more expensive. This is not the place to go for a genuine New York style hot dog. 

SO disappointed, and will not go out of my way to go again!"}
{"text":"I was excited to try Papaya King.  I have never been to the original but this location didn't live up to the hype.  We ordered the #6 with C&C and Hula Hula, Corn Dog and Coconut Champagne to drink.  Hot dog was good but unfortunately not hot.  I liked the flavors of the toppings but thought they were a little light.  More toppings might have helped the dry bun.  I liked the drink.  Would def try other flavors, especially when they have alcohol.  Prices were super cheap.  We came midweek in the afternoon.  It was really slow, only 2 other parties in the time we were there.  That may have been part of the problem.  I would try again at a busier time.  Probably after drinking at the Hard Rock."}
{"text":"This place is trash. Do NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY HERE. The employee was brand spankin new. We asked a question. She ignored us. Asked again then said I dont know I'm new. What? Are you not trained ? Their smoothies are fake. The manager told me it's milk with water and flavor. Do not buy. Their hotdogs ...ive never seen a more pathetic hotdog for 4 dollars. Its little the size of a pencil in how skinny it is and the length of a marker. It also tasted terrible. Do not absolutely not waste money here. Disgusting."}
{"text":"I'm sorry to even write this review it was so bad. I lived on the west side of manhattan for almost four years and Papaya King was my lunch and dinner many times over. This Location is horrendous to say the least. The red onion and sauerkraut used on my hot dogs were extremely salty, dry, and overcooked. Employees had no idea what was going on even though there were only 3 people in the entire restaurant. Some things just need to stay in NYC and need not to be franchised out. These franchisee's apparently do not care about the amazing tradition that is Papaya King and are defiantly not upholding the standards set by the original. If you're a New Yorker on Vacation..stay away!!"}
{"text":"I lived in Manhattan for almost 5 years so I am
a bit biased to Papaya King and Grays Papaya. I really love both of those place that produce almost identical experiences which are consistently very good for over 50 years. Loved the neon lighting of Papaya King as I approached the store and it reminded me of the Manhattan location right away. What I noticed right away was there were only about 10 hot dogs on the flat top where in NYC I was used to seeing about 100 cooking at once all day everyday, but being off the strip on Paradise Rd there is barely any foot traffic so I understand why they don't keep too many hot dogs cooking at once. I went at about 10:30 pm, no line, and about 10 ppl inside. The Hot Dogs were great and both of mine had the \"Snap\" that made them famous. I always order the original w Kraut & NY Onions and add Mustard at the dispenser. Remember \"No Ketchup\" on NYC shot dogs lol I'll be back for sure at least once a week."}
{"text":"We stopped her for a quick bite when heading black to our hotel. It was a very good hot dog for a $1 and since we checked in on a yelp we received a free topping. The waiter didn't even know that when you check in you get a free topping and was in shock when we requested it although there was a sign hanging in front of him that specifically said.. if you check in on yelp you get a free topping.. these waiters need to be updated with what promos their company is having .. but again the hotdog was good and definitely great for $1"}
{"text":"I've never been interested in trying Papaya King's original New York locations because they don't serve veggie dogs. Having been disappointed by several New York-based eateries that've set up shop in Las Vegas, I wasn't expecting much from Papaya King. 

Initially, I was interested in just grabbing a few tropical drinks to quench our thirst (it was 106 degrees in the shade), but we ended up ordering some dogs & dessert & eating in. Both the Papaya tropical drink & Papaya Pride smoothie were watered down without much flavor. 

The food was just as bad. I took one bite of an Original hot dog with NY Onions & it was disgusting. The NY Onions were drenched in a sweet tomato sauce. This was my first time trying a meat hot dog in years & best believe it'll be my last (until I get tempted again.) Fried Twinkie was covered in a nice pancake batter; sweet & heavy, as expected. 

I'm not sure if the original locations are any better, but it would be fine if I never found out."}
{"text":"I'm depressed and embarrassed. I lived in NYC for 15 years and when I heard they put up a Papaya King here, I decided to take my brother's family. There's 8 of us and we walk in to a smallish line. Basically 3 sets of people in front of us. In NYC there's a line out the door and it gets handled super fast. I will make a long story short and say it looks like the one in NYC but it is operated terribly. It was just before dinner time, like 5pm and they were out of fries and pastrami and sweet potatoes. They didn't have any dogs on the flat top which looked to be off the entire time we were there. The service was so slow that people before us asked for their money back and another set of people started complaining that they didn't tell them there were no fries when they ordered a combo. I knew it was about to be a disaster so i suggested we cancel and get our money back, but my family said we're already here. I thought maybe they're making the food in the back because no one was cooking. One person was at the register and the other was consolidating mayonnaise. Finally, after people started complaining they started making our order but it came out all haphazard. And they kept asking us what we ordered when they had our order on a screen. They brought some dogs and then some others then after we had the dogs they brought out the sides one by one so that my family was eating random tater tots after their hot dogs were finished. For some reason my hot dog came after the oreos so we just boxed up the rest and left. I was so excited to take my family to see the place i loved in New York and this was so depressing. Obviously they're not being supported, given the lack of core items. And they were nice, just not properly trained and staffed."}
{"text":"Service was slow, dining area was dirty with all filthy tables, garbage overflowing with trash no one behind the counter seemed to really care. Food took 15 min when there was No one else in line. Hot dogs came out cold, bums tasted stale. Chicken sandwich was delicious. Big disappointment will never return."}
{"text":"First I came middle of the day like 1pm no one in there so service should have been good right. Hell naw it was ugh below average the cashier couldnt even take my order correctly and IT WAS SIMPLE 2 beef hot dog combo one with onions one without.  Yes he messed it up put onions on both. But thats not it the fountain machine was busted they offered a smoothie the smoothie (mango) was all frothy lukewarm and NASTY not to my liking. So on to the hot dog you expect because we were literally the only ones in there it'll be hot  haaaa nooottt it was maybe lukewarm in nasty too. The hotdog was liw grade beef and oily.  Note to self NEVER go there AGAIN no recommendation for this establishment."}
{"text":"Move along, nothing to see or eat here....
I was in the area of the Hard Rock hotel in Las Vegas today and today was the day to try out Papaya King for hot dogs and the highly touted Papaya drinks. Oh cool, the \"King Combo\" has two dogs, curly fries and a drink for $9. Well I order and the guy taking the order is new and doesn't quite know the menu, I order the king combo and he asks me which one that is from the picture menu, I point it out and get one hot dog with the sour kraut and one with some kind of tomato topping, then it come with curly fries and a drink, I order the standard papaya drink because it sounds different and I had to see what it was all about, then I step aside and wait for my order. 
Some lady was behind me in line and orders food too and a few minutes later a tray with two hot dogs, that looks like what I ordered comes out to the counter and so does fries and a drink. The lady serving the food doesn't call out a number or name, just puts the tray out for someone to get. Well without me knowing the lady that ordered after me grabs the tray and is off. I'm thinking that sure looked like what I ordered, but I'm not sure.
Then, I'm thinking my food was swiped out from under me! Soon I hear, whos drink is this? (Mango), well sure enough the lady took my papaya drink and my food and was already sitting down and eating it. Then they ask me what my order was and I said, \"it looks like that lady is eating it\". They are like duuuuh???? and ask me if I ordered the mango drink, I said \"no, that lady is drinking it, I ordered the papaya\" again a look off duuuuh?
Well they finally realize that my order was being comsumed by someone else and I finally get me food. I find a seat and the overall experience is not too good. There is nothing special here and as some of the other reviewers were saying they liked the hot dogs because they had a \"snap\" to them when they took a bite, well sure enough one of the two dogs did have a noticeable \"snap\", but am I lucky or what? it's just a rubber hot dog and nothing really outstanding. The curly fries are the same machine extruded ones you can get at the Checkers on the same corner lot. The great papaya drink tastes like the remnants of a watered down orange julius and is not all that. 
I also saw 3 people in a group order some food with different topping and the workers behind the counter didn't label the foil wrappers, so this group of 3 diners had to ask which is which and the counter people had to unwrap each one to take a peek inside because they didn't know either, the wrappers are not marked as to what toppings are inside.
I'm suprised that they didn't have a system down for all that since the place has been open or a while know. I hope the hot dog gods will have mercy on these workers there since I am sure one day they will have a large group of tourists arrive and I am sure they will fail in a big way because they don't have a basic system in place to run the business properly.
The hype has been revealed and I don't like the food there and it's nothing to make a specail trip for.
The beautiful neon sign that I see every night when I go home from work is the only redeeeming offering from this glorified hot dog cart.
Move along folks, nothing to eat here, move along."}
{"text":"This is a new place. Saw the $1 hot dog sign, was craving one so I tried it. Waited 10 minutes for bartender to make on drink. Ten minutes to get my hot dog. Twenty minutes? That's not right. A tiny hot dog with a cold bun. Served on a napkin at the bar. Never again.
These new places need to learn SERVICE & QUALITY matters.

I wrote the above review back in May 2017. I was walking by lay Friday 9/22 they are \"Out of Business \". I am always correct."}
{"text":"Yeeeeahno...

We tried a Southern Comfort  and Upper East...
Service was good BUT...

Buns were dry
Hot dog was good
Toppings were skimpy 
Drinks were artificial tasting
Seriously,  go to Dog Haus across the street 

Can we PLEASE send Papaya King and Halal Guys back to New York (Tell Momofuku Milk Bar stay home too!) and bring Dominique Ansel  here instead!?!?"}
{"text":"Fried errythang! Pickles, Twinkies, and Oreos, Oh my! Smoothies with and without booze, were delish & well blended and you probably already know how great their dogs are..."}
{"text":"I'm going against the grain here and giving Papaya King a solid 4 stars.

I came by for an afternoon snack.  The biggest plus is that they're way cheaper than all the \"designer hot dogs\" that are offered on strip such as Pink's and Haute Doggery. 

I ordered their Classic Combo with two Franks and Papaya Tropical Drink (http://bit.ly/2w4lPqo).
I liked their franks!  They have this really good snap to them when you take a bite.  And I loved the Papaya Tropical Drink!  It was really sweet and refreshing and pairs so well with the hot dogs.  

Overall, I've become a fan of Papaya King with this visit.  I could see why Anthony Bourdain digs it so much.  Cheap, good hot dogs, refreshing drinks, and they're open late which is always a huge plus."}
{"text":"Went in today and the food was so bad I threw it away and went next door and got lunch. It was so bad. The hotdog bun was so stale it broke in half. Save your money and time skip Papaya King."}
{"text":"Extremely disappointing. I have eaten at one of the New York locations and if the food was as bad in NYC it would have closed shortly after opening. The classic hot dog (and you must buy two of them) was a tiny tube of dried meat submerged in a brittle days old bun by a ton of cheese that was pumped out of a can.  Their chili is just a thin gravy with lots of beans and a bit of meat 

The Papaya drink was ok but very sweet. 

I now see they are advertising half off. Unless they upgrade their food an discounts won't  help. 

Avoid those place"}
{"text":"If you're looking for the best sausage & curly fries, come here...BUT expect to pay a bit more than what's normally acceptable. Of course that's the case because it's still well within strip vicinity (right across from Hard Rock) and it's apparently a famous NY import. Understandable, I guess.

Got the jumbo sausage w/ peppers, curly fries, and the specialty papaya smoothie thing on my first visit. First 2 were bomb, but I could've done without the watery, milky, un-smoothie thing. Around 10 bucks for the combo.

My favorite part about this joint is that they're open until 3am...Perfect for my night owl dog cravings!

Try it at least once, but don't get that sorry papaya thing."}
{"text":"Hit Dogs are OK and the location could use a better staff the Hit Dogs never seen fresh at this location so your better off buying from busier location... I'm a NJ/NY hot dog expert and VEGAS could use a great HOT DOG!!!"}
{"text":"FOOD 2/5:
-I got the hot dog with cheese & pickle chips. Alright so 1st of all, the hot dog doesn't taste like anything special. It taste like you can make it at home. The pickle chips were gross, I thought it was supposed to be delicious, but it just tasted like vinegar.
-Curly Fries LARGE $3.50: I rather go to Jack in the box for their large curly fries because they taste the same. 

The people working there were really helpful but I am sorry these hot dogs just taste like regular hot dogs i could make at home..."}
{"text":"The cashier was nice.  It was all downhill from there.  A terrible location, especially for any Strip traffic.  We are locals, originally from the east coast, and familiar with the Papaya King.
The menu is placed high up on the wall and difficult to read  or understand.  Our visit was in the late afternoon and only one other person in the place.  Hot dogs looked like they had been sitting on the grill all day (and still we ordered- mistake) and were shriveled up and very small.  The rolls were stale and tasteless and the order of fries looked like they were left from early in the day. They did cook a new order, nothing special. The drink, OK. Took a few bites and threw the rest away.  As we left the other person in the restaurant was complaining about her take-out order.  They may get it together but, we won't be back.  New York it isn't."}
{"text":"Papaya King.. I'm sorry but I haven't bought into the from New York hype yet. I've been here a couple of times now and I have to say that the dog they serve is good. The place just doesn't do it for me.

This New York transplant has hot dogs, special hot dogs, appetizers, fruity drinks, and alcoholic drinks coming soon. Everything is very reasonably priced. The hot dogs are just a couple bucks and the special ones are a couple of bucks more. 

I've had their classic with kraut and mustard, one with brisket, I've had their regular tots, and they king tots or something. The king tots I had recently and I didn't like the cheese sauce they use. I've also had their papaya drink and the namesake also doesn't do it for me. 

I think their hot dog itself is good, the prices are good, the staff is nice, the space is maintained, but it lacks the \"cravable\" factor that makes me want to return. 

I definitely say to try it since it's a regional thing, but with all the gourmet hot dog places in town this chain just doesn't appeal to me."}

{"text":"Been looking forward to this since I heard about them coming to Vegas. Had the hula hula (mixed topping, just a little spicy) and C&C (chili cheese dog). With a papaya drink. I really enjoyed everything."}
{"text":"Well, my first experience was fantastic. 

Hot Dogs, Good 
Fresh Juices, Delicious. 

I will say that I have not been a fan of the ways, that a lot of these east-coast-style spots are coming to Vegas. In regards to overall execution - it's sufficient but I've been underwhelmed by recent transplants in the last few years. On the higher end side of dining , and the casual side - the gameplay of these places has been, frustrating to say the least. Service non-existent, clueless staff and inferior food product.

Now comes another Ny, east coast staple. Papaya King was good. I liked it a lot and will be back soon. The Upper East Dog and a Classic Chili dog were both great, served as a combo with curly fries and a papaya coconut juice. It  was excellent. $12 for the combo and full when done. 

The restaurant is small with counter based service. The menu is oddly high on the wall and the lighting is sharp and fluorescent. Overall, I liked it - and I look forward to a hot summer day in Vegas with a fresh and delicious Papaya King juice to cool me off. 

On a similar note - other reviews have mentioned Dog Haus hotdogs across the street. I like Dog Haus a lot as well. This is not Dog Haus. It's not the same concept. Yes it's hot dogs, but it's not the same. Papaya King is something else with different flavor profiles and great juices. Give it a try. Happy Eating!"}
{"text":"Great service, I originally didn't know what to get and the nice man helped me choose. The food was amazing also! I ordered the mozerella fries and the side on top hot dog. Will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Not what I expected, and really was hoping for better. Please give them a try to see what you think, I may have just went on a bad day. I will try again sometime in the nearish future :)"}
{"text":"Came here yesterday with my better half.  Place is decorated with different Papaya facts and pictures of different types of specialty franks.  I ordered the Jumbo Sausage combo and asked to substitute my drink with the Mango Breeze Smothie for an extra cost which is worth it.  My Hun ordered the Grand Slam which you can choose 2 specialty franks he ordered the Bulleyes and C & C and substitute his regular fries with chili tots.  Very satisfied and will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Great drinks great customer service and not to mention the cool zone is right there. My favorite place to grab a few drinks during the day. Try the spiked grape is amazing."}
{"text":"Super bummed about this one. Always wanted to try the King's dog and signature papaya drink, especially after seeing Bourdain devour them on tv. Keeping in mind, he was in NYC at the flagship with the owner, but, hey...doesn't Vegas deserve quality and attention? The dog was decent and with the distinct \"Snap\", but, man, the rest was was crap. Cheapest bun on the planet disintegrated with an overload of Sysco toppings. Had the New York dog #1 on the menu, served recklessly with more drippings than frank. Pro Tip: get a plain dog and add your side toppings as you go along. Defeats the purpose of having prefab options, but who wants to contend with all that mess? Nathan's, still wins. Papaya \"smoothie\" more like a sugary Orange Julius-type than tropical goodness; on par with the pseudo quality of their offerings. Maybe the boozy Stip location will serve Vegas better."}
{"text":"I was very excited to try this place but it was a big let down.  Being from LA I ate Pinks hot dogs a lot and was expecting something of that caliber.  Unfortunately, the hot dog was overcooked and the bun was stale.  It was a huge disappointment."}
{"text":"They are not ready. Famous or not, cold buns, dogs not grilled and a long wait. WTH still in soft open mode I guess. Not ready for prime time. Spoke to manager and he said they are waiting for a new grill that chars the dogs and they are trying to get a different bun supplier. Definitely not the same. The only thing going for them is the papaya drink."}
{"text":"Very disappointed Had the King Combo, one hot dog with mustard and onions, the other with mustard and sauerkraut. The hotdogs were so thin that you could have fit 2 in the bun. The sauerkraut was over cooked and so were the curly fries. The onions did taste like authentic New York city version. The staff is still very green and have to get their routine down. They could barely handle the rush of about 5 customers. This is NOT ANYTHING LIKE THE PAPAYA KING IN NYC! Don't waste your time or money here!"}
{"text":"cheap crap, poorly prepared shriveled wieners. who puts sweet relish on a hotdog, blaahh I'm still sick thinking about it. OWNERS, spend a little more than minimum wage and get some decent help in there. 

tots w cheese sauce ok"}
{"text":"Really surprised that this is New Yorks best hot dogs. Really disappointed after seeing this place on the news and wanting to try it. The staff was very friendly but food was not what I expected. I ordered the specialty dog, the hot dog is so small the only thing I can taste is the bun and toppings. Also ordered the \"king\" tots and they were also disappointing. Your better off going next door to checkers"}
{"text":"Idk.. I mean, the papaya smoothie was pretty good? For some reason papaya king was better when I was in a snowy NYC starving. I just wasn't a fan of this one here. It's a bit unfortunate cus I was excited but it's not like a MUST go type of spot here in Vegas. 

The dogs were mediocre tough and the curly fries were meh. You can def get something a bit better. But hey, it's near the bars and such. Drunk and hungry? Come here. 

The service was pretty ok too. Kind of slow. Especially when no one's in there. I've come twice. But, I do give them kudos for keeping it super clean. 

This spot use to be Hamburger Mary's, i belive. I miss hamburger mary's. :(


I was excited when we got a bunch of ny's food joints. (Milk, Momofuku, Halal Guys, Shake Shack, etc) But none up to par just yet. Maybe just Kung Fu Tea. I'm waiting for Rice to Riches or Juniors to make it's way here. Ahh, I miss NYC too. Haha."}
{"text":"Walked in at 11:30 on a Saturday. One person clearing the tables. I went up to the counter and the person cleaning the tables told me someone would be right with me. After three minutes of standing at the counter, I asked the lady cleaning tables if someone could help me. Again, she told me someone would be right up and called a name to the back. After about another minutes, I walked out. The lady yelled at me as I was leaving \"Fine, I'll take your order.\"  The gist of what I said was don't bother but I may have used a bit more profanity to express my dissatisfaction. Avoid until they realized crappy service doesn't fly in this town."}
{"text":"Nice, clean place specializing in hot dogs.

My vegetarian (soy) dogs were somewhat disappointing -- flavorless (could/should have used seasoning at the ok soy-dog factory...) & I think undercooked.    Despite having cheese, onions, etc. on them, there really wasn't a lot of flavor.    The good news is that the manager said they'll be switching to a new/better type of vegetarian hot dog in the near future, and the manager was very friendly & informative, even after having been on the job for 10+ hours.  Even the hot dog buns seemed to have been sitting out for a couple hours -- not as soft/fresh as I would have liked or expected for the price.

Strip-Mall location at Tropicana & Paradise is rather seedy, especially after dark.  I'm sitting in the corner, sizing-up (oh dear, profiling!) everyone that walks-in.

Place has wifi, but it's secured.  Either just for staff, or customers need to get the password from staff.

Open until 3AM, a lot of their clientele may be drunks staggering over from the Hard Rock, just across Tropicana.   Could be fun people-watching to be here around 2AM...

I wish my food was better, but I will come back in a couple months to try their new vegetarian hot dog."}
{"text":"Meh. That's pretty much what Papaya King left me with. 
I'll start with the good. The highlight is definitely their Papaya drink. Not at all healthy, but tasty. I totally agree with everyone that once their liquor license happens alcohol will be very good in this drink. The chili cheese tots were my favorite as far as the food we ordered went. $6 for these tots. The toppings were ok, but more cheese should have been involved. 
Now the hot dog...... Where is the \"snap\" my hot dog was supposed to have? The toppings were just sad. My dad got the Upper East dog. I doubt there was a full piece of pastrami on the hot dog. The toppings are just sad. The bun was even worse. You can't ignore the bun and make it an after thought. It was hard as a rock. Did someone leave the bag open? My Pig In Da Blanket was ok, but I rather hit up Hot Dog Heaven in Henderson any day then spend my money at this corporate chain. Super disappointing over all."}
{"text":"There are some things that don't translate well, there has to be something in the water, or in the scenery or something in the air. This Papaya King was rotten. 

Full disclosure I have not tried the NY locations, but was eager to try the Las Vegas offerings. We swung by and they were not busy, but for some reason the guy already had hot dogs cooked and ready to go on the griddle. Not sure if you have ever done this, but the hot dogs shrink, the casing looses it's crunch and overall it just leads to a poor experience. Not to mention the bun was cold and not in the steamer or anywhere. So it was a bit of a difficult swallow. 

The Papaya drink tasted like a taffy that was lightly papaya flavor. I wouldn't call it refreshing, but it was tasty. I would drink it again, if I was drunk."}
{"text":"Stopped by while on Vacation. 8 pm, not busy, Monday. Hot Dogs were so good, not gonna lie. Got Chili Special. Free refills!
Would have second thoughts on onion rings"}
{"text":"This place has
No chance. Basically overpriced garbage. I saw them scooping out the chili from a big can. I used to go the original in ny and it was delicious but this is an obvious poor replica franchisee trying to get rich. Better luck next time. You can't go to the bathroom without asking for them to unlock it, big turnoff."}
{"text":"I had heard about this place in NYC and have been looking forward to the opening. Unfortunately I was very disappointed. However the employees where very nice and helpful. I found that it was very underwhelming I could have quite honestly stayed home and made a hot dog myself and better for that matter. My bun was hard and stale, my hot dog was very cold. I just haa custom classic dog. There is nothing special about this place that would make me want to eat here again. Maybe if I just want a quick bite to eat."}
{"text":"\"Can we PLEASE send Papaya King ... back to New York?\"  Vegas yelper, Nelson Q.

A NYC institution since 1932.  The nostalgic remembrance of a NYC local, \"when I was in high school, this was the cheap eats hangout\".  The great Julia Child (1912 - 2004), claiming it was the best hot dog she ever had.  Could we please have a current endorsement???  Maybe something from, oh I don't know, this decade?

1.  Bone dry buns.  Beyond day old.  Bite and crumble. 

2.  Canned toppings (cheese whiz, \"chili\", fluorescent green relish and pickles, ballpark yellow mustard, not so sour kraut).  

3.  Absolutely nothing special about the dog.  It's no Casper, Miller, oh heck, it's not even Nathan's or Pink's.  Nothing makes it stand out.  No great spice blend, no smoky character, no snappy casing, nothing.  It's just a mystery meat in a tube found at your local ball park. 

The curly fries are good.  

Meaning no disrespect to the great sausage crafters of today but speaking of nostalgia, anyone else remember  1988, The Great Outdoors?  \"Hotdogs!  You know what they make those things out of...Lips and A------s\"."}
{"text":"It's been a while since I've had a good hot dog here in town and Papaya King delivered. I see complaints from people stating the dog was nothing special or that the bun was hard. These people obviously are no hot dog enthusiasts. First of all, the all beef link is just right. Equal length of the bun and a perfect snap because of the casing. The bun is lightly toasted, rather than steamed usually making the bread too soggy to hold the toppings properly. They have a great variety of dogs to please any palette and the also have some deep fried oreos or twinkies if you happen to have a sweet tooth."}
{"text":"If you think about going because it's similar to NY's Greys Papaya you will be sadly dissapointed as I was. Buns were dry and the juice was way to sweet."}
{"text":"I'm hesitant to give a hot-dog place this many stars, but I'll make a confession, guilty pleasure of mine. West coast guy here, loving this east coast staple. This eatery is new to my recently gentrified neighborhood in Vegas, couldn't be happier. This place will be on my rotation."}
{"text":"This place is supposed to be legendary, but Papaya King fell short. I mean, it's not the worst hot dog in Vegas. I just expected SO much more. One of the workers suggested the Classic Hot Dog with New York Onions for only $2.50. The onions were incredible and the sweetness helped to balance out the saltiness of the all-beef hot dog. The C&C (chili and cheese) $4 was slightly above average, but the sodium levels were through the roof. My biggest gripe are the buns. Can they at least steam them or something??? My hot dog buns were pretty tough. I seriously need to drink a gallon of water in hopes of preventing belly bloat."}
{"text":"5 stars if you are dying from a craving of cart onions (red street art onions). 0 stars if you want your food promptly! Service was atrocious"}
{"text":"Friday night 11pm across from The Hard Rock were the Papaya King neon lights, not a soul in the parking lot. Are they even open??  They were open and 2 employees appeared, didn't say a word to us, just looked like they didn't want to be bothered. But we bothered them, so I'm not sure if it was the alcohol in my system, but for a hot dog joint it was tasty. The dogs are small, so if your hungry get 2. I tried the Original with onions. And a Papaya drink, the papaya drink was weird in an addicting way, my husband didn't like it as much as I did. It was better while it was cold, but it was almost like those orange chewable children's aspirin. If this place can't get business on a Friday night on a busy street corner in Las Vegas, I don't think they'll be around much longer, famous or not. But if I'm in the neighborhood and they're still open, I'll stop in."}
{"text":"I just had to try the famous Papaya for a hot dog. I mean who could pass up the opportunity to try a hot dog from a famous New York establishment that's been around since 1939?

I wish I had. It was the most disappointing hot dog experience I have ever had. I think the photo speaks for itself. Tiny little hot dog that looks like it was cooked yesterday and reheated. Wayyy overcooked."}
{"text":"I was here early and it was painful to see how disorganized this place was unlike the NYC location. The food was ok not the best I've had better at Costco . The drinks are not all the good either just watered down drinks . Don't wast your money here it's not very good at all."}
{"text":"Honestly not really worth it. It's cool to try once and they do have decent and unique drinks but the hype was too much. I highly doubt even the NY one is better than the one here. You charging $9 for two mediocre hot dogs, jack in the box curly fries, and a drink that saves the meal...if you have better and fresher ingredients I wouldn't mind but honestly a place like Carney's is so much better...."}
{"text":"This is NOT a gourmet hot dog spot. If that's what you like go to Doghaus. This is a NY street dog. Anyone giving it a bad review either doesn't know what a Sabrett hot dog cart is or doesn't like those either and no this isn't a Sabrett frankfurter or a Nathan's or anything else because it's a papaya king frankfurter which is a brand in of itself. 

The homerun \"traditional\" NY dog is delicious minus the brown mustard which they should carry and is why I am giving them a four star instead of five. The knish is very good too, again, it does need spicy brown mustard. The other dogs on the menu, are probably whatever! I would never order them because I come for the red \"NY onions\" and sauerkraut, period! 

Lastly, the buns are toasted and mine were good. If it's crumbling that's not good but could be because the place is new and messed up. They should be toasty though and mine were. 

If you want a NY street dog in Vegas it has arrived and I'm happier for it. Plus they are 100% beef"}
{"text":"After going back to have a hotdog we encountered the enemy of every restaurant: inconsistency. 
The hotdogs were nowhere near the same as Saturday. They need a manager there to crack the whip on the kids and teach them how to properly chop onions."}
{"text":"Brooklyn native living in Vegas and I find a Papaya King. There's hope for Vegas after all. King combo and some coconut champagne I'm good."}
{"text":"I give it 3 starts its a damn shame aint no communication between the person taking the order and the person cooking the food i dont understand this type of shitnis ridiculous.... and whats crazy you got two black people working here makes me look bad... yall need a whole nee staff and dm yall just trash as fuck slow as fuck everything about yall trash... exepct the food i wont be coming bacl f9r this trash ass service!!!!!"}
{"text":"Not just for papayas and hotdogs. Deep fried Oreos, twinkies, and pickles!!! Love the chicken fingers and corn dogs. MUST try the juices! Mango is my fave"}
{"text":"Good dogs! A bit expensive for hot dogs and fries but the food was good. The poor guy behind the counter was all by himself when we got there and it was pretty busy so service was slow. He was on his cell phone trying to get someone to come in and help him but I can't fault him for that."}
