{"text":"Great carry out restaurant, new ownership about 1year ago. Best thing that ever happened to this restaurant was the current owners ... I stop in here everyday for breakfast on the way into work , Great quality food!  Love this place!"}
{"text":"Place is all around awesome! Food is great, inexpensive as well. It's one of the better spots to grab a Philly Cheesesteak, and not spend $10 for just a sandwich. Matter a fact, it's better than most $10 Philly's in the area.   Great people, Great Service, Great Food.... A+"}
{"text":"I love places like this. Tiny, what seems like a family owned restaurant. Has classics like chicken fingers and burgers, and also unique and interesting items on their menu. Their sweet tea is amazing! They give a really good portion size for the price too. After a long morning of travel, had a chicken tender plate from here and wasn't hungry after for hours! Food was hot and pretty tasty as well. Five stars for sure!"}
{"text":"So worth the money... I have returned 99 times after my first meal... also never spent more than $7"}
{"text":"Really great breakfast I truly enjoyed my thick crispy bacons strips, scrambled eggs, home fries and toast plus I got a chicken chef salad with so much yummy grilled chicken for an amazing price. Very satisfied."}
{"text":"I LOVE Graham Street Grill!! I live literally around the corner and I make sure to get breakfast from them on my days off. The prices are cheap, but the food is cooked fresh to order. Where else can you get a meat, 1 egg, home fries AND toast for $3.25?!?!?   The only thing that I hate is that they're closed on weekends I don't get a chance to eat their lunch food that often, but when I do I have no complaints. It's not in the best part of town but they're definitely worth a visit!!"}
{"text":"We stopped in here for lunch today and was very pleased with the food and service! I recommend the cheesesteak extra cheese, add mushrooms, minus lettuce and tomato. I will definitely stop in again if ever back on that side of town!"}
{"text":"My favorite unknown greasy breakfast place. A lot of people call ahead and that seems like the way to go. There's basically no seating so it's all take out mostly.   Their chicken philly is delicious, fries are average. I usually get a breakfast plate or sandwich at both are amazing. There are a lot of options on the menu.   Whenever I'm in the area and hungry, I get so exited to go here.   CHEAP and delicious. You can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Ok, so first,   YES it is a dive.  Right next door to a convenience store, in a section og North Graham Street you probably would not want to go after dark, which may be why they close at 4:00 p.m.    But that is what makes this place so awesome!     My co-worker and I ordered and picked up the gyro and fries combo.   Also could not resist the Pineapple Pound Cake with Cream Cheese Icing.    Both plates came up to $15.15 including tax.   Got back to the office and devoured the plate.    Gyro was perfectly done and very traditional Greek fair with some of the best homemade fries.    It also came with 4 oz. of Tzatziki Sauce that was to die for.    Pineapple Pound cake made for a nice sweet after the meal .    It is only a take out place, but for the money, the quantity of food and the taste,   a great bet if you are wanting something different than the regular burger, but they have that too.   And the ones I saw coming from the kitchen looked pretty darn good."}
{"text":"Reviews and seeing it made me want to check it out. I would say the burger had a good taste and got a lot for the cost. I would eat there again but not get the burger, tons better burgers in town from other small places."}
{"text":"Chose this place due to proximity of where I needed to be early in the morning. There is a small bar with about 5-7 chairs if you wanted to eat at the establishment. The menu is posted on the wall behind the counter.  I ordered the turkey sausage burrito with peppers and onions. It was fantastic! The veggies were perfectly saut√©ed and not mushy. Perfect blend (not too many onions). Every bite was the ingredients, unlike many places where you get a bite of nothing but peppers or sausage etc. everything is MTO and not one part of my burrito was sub-par.  I would highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"Country breakfast $3.95 scrambled eggs, 4 pieces of bacon and biscuit & sausage gravy. DEAL!! The gravy was good but hubby said it should be hotter. Fried chicken sandwich w bacon and Swiss (processed) cheese slice.  Good flavor to salty."}
{"text":"Amazing prices, solid quality food, super fast service, crazy nice staff. I'll be back. Only bright light in a food deserted area. Too much fast food around and this place is worth a try."}
{"text":"I came yesterday and ordered a Philly Cheesesteak and was very surprised about how much meat you get usually a Philly steak in charlotte is dry and not a lot of meat and a lot of veggies. The sweet tea and lemonade are awesome! I am in love with this place so much I came back today and got there famous cowboy burger.   *Please note this place is take out only it looks super sketchy but the food is well worth it and all the employees are super friendly!"}
