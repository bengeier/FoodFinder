{"text":"Best breakfast around. Fast, friendly service with a smile - these girls hustle! Food and portion sizes are good, and you'll never see the bottom of your coffee cup!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast and lunch specials , not in Elyria though, in LaGrange"}
{"text":"Read some other reviews. I know for a FACT that saying this is \"the best breakfast around\" is taking it too far. It isn't the best. They do what they do very well though. It's very good family diner food at an affordable price. Servers are on their game, mine was at least. Very friendly. Very cozy spot. Would return."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a good breakfast with lots of options and a friendly staff...look no further.  Very consistent.  Eat-in or take-out.  The trains can be loud (hence, choo-choos), but it just adds to the ambiance. For my money, best breakfast in the area."}
{"text":"I was told by a friend to try this place. We were so disappointed. My friend said we must have hit a bad day or a bad cook. My husband got Salisbury steak. They were out of  mashed potatoes?! The Salisbury steak was a frozen premade burger with gravy. Choices are all fried foods. They need to get some healthy options. I am going to try it for breakfast soon. Still hopeful."}
{"text":"Been here twice for breakfast. It is a very cute establishment with friendly staff and good, affordable food. It's very close to our new home and it's looking like this is going to be our go to breakfast spot."}
{"text":"We have eaten at Choo Choo's a few times. Their breakfast is really very good. Their omelettes are great, waffles and pancakes are very good, and their roast beef hash is home made and delicious. They have great coffee, and great service. Even their multi grain toast is something special. Their lunches are good, but not quite as good as their breakfasts. The derailer burger is great, but their prime rib sandwich (special) is just OK."}
{"text":"First visit to Choo Choo's. The review on their website was much more impressive than the actual food. The description of the deluxe hamburger that I ordered was more grand than the burger that was served to me. \"Where's the beef\"?! For $6.95, no way.  My friend ordered open faced roast beef. There was so much gristle, she left 75% of meal. We won't return. #dissatisfiedcustomer"}
{"text":"I went here several times only because I live a half mile away. A group of good ole boys sat in the back telling racist jokes about Barack Obama EVERY TIME I was there and I haven't been back since. Food is average. I don't understand the myth of this being such a great breakfast place. Michelle's Cafe up the road is better."}
{"text":"Love having breakfast here!! More than ample portions, friendly waitresses, and always a great meal!!!"}
