{"text":"Great hotel and super clean! WONDERFUL BEDS & PILLOWS, super sweet staff (especially Stephanie when I checked in)."}
{"text":"This hotel stinks. Today the WiFi doesn't work. The front desk people are not the least bit considerate about it. They keep telling me it will be working in  one more hour, but time keeps passing and nothing happens. We I went down to the lobby to access the wifi I was told it wasn't working there either. When I confronted them they happened to let slip that they have been working on it since yesterday afternoon. It is working on higher floors and its quite early, but they won't give me another room that has WiFi. I'm paying over $200 a night and after all, this is a Hyatt \"Regency\". I even asked for a reduction in my room rate and the best they could offer me was complementary access to the business center. That's pathetic.   A month ago I made a reservation for a king bed and they told me the only thing available for a handicap accessible room. I argued with the front desk clerk and got the same inconsiderate response. What ever happened to customer service at Hyatts?"}
{"text":"I've never rated an hotel before, but I wanted to let fellow travelers know how bad this one is. I live in Pittsburgh and this hotel is an embarrassment to Pittsburgh.  While the \"suite\" we had was large (too large) it was oddly arranged.  The bathroom  was not attached the bedroom.  The closet was tucked into a weirdly angled corner and the rod was strangely low.  The coffee maker sat on a  shelf that was too far away from the power plug and the cord was not long enough.  The furniture, carpet, curtains, and walls all felt slightly battered and dingy.  Good hotels think about these details.  This is not a good hotel.  The rooms really need to be refurbished  The restaurant was even worse. It was expensive and the food was diner quality at best.  The salad I ordered was floating in dressing.  I had to send it back.  I ate the pasta because I had no choice - I was hungry and there was nowhere else to go.  The service was equally as bad.  We waited 15 minutes for water, 1/2 hour for salads and about an hour for the entree.  The bread, although we asked multiple times, was delivered well after the salad. We saw other diners eating burgers and fries, which could have been a better choice, but the waitress neglected to bring us that menu.  She was completely indifferent to serving us.  What an unpleasant experience."}
{"text":"We stayed at several Hyatt properties over the Thanksgiving holiday and I was pleasantly surprised with our stay at the airport Hyatt. This is a Hyatt Regency, but be aware there is no Regency Club at this property.  Parking is a little tricky to figure out. There are 25 spots in front of the lower lobby - these are $25/day with full in/out privileges. The long term lot at the airport is free for the 1st hr, then $3/hr with a max of $13/day (day=24 hr period, starting when you take a ticket). The hotel is basically located in the long term parking lot so this option makes more sense if you don't need to come and go often. Sections 1A / 3A / 6A are right outside entrances to the hotel's main 2nd floor lobby so these are ideal and easy to deal with.  We stayed in a 1 br king at the corner of the hotel. The room was very spacious and well appointed with wrap around views of the airport - this was great for watching planes takeoff and land, as well as beautiful sunrises. The smaller front room had a pullout bed. Soundproofing from exterior noise is excellent with thick double paned glass. Our room had two LG flat screens with phenomenal HD pictures. Wifi worked flawlessly after logging in with last name and rm number.  Breakfast in the farm to table Bellfarm restaurant was excellent - we tried both the buffet and ala carte items, and both were very good. Cage free eggs, uncured bacon and other high end items were a nice touch, and offered for both the buffet and menu items. The staff in the restaurant was fantastic - very friendly and attentive, but not overly so.   The pool was clean and well heated - it could've used some more pool toys for the kids. As an added bonus, there is also a whirlpool, steam room and sauna. The steam room needs some updating but they are a rare amenity to begin with. Fitness area is great with a full set of dumbbells and cardio equipment, and an assortment of weight training machines.  As great as this property is, we did run into a few issues. 1) the pullout bed wasn't made when we arrived with tired children - they were fairly quick to remedy, but waiting 40 min was painful and caused problems for the kids. 2) the heat wasn't working in the front room - this is an issue in late November and was never remedied. 3) the safe was locked from the previous resident and the coffee service hadn't been replenished. The staff was apologetic on all counts.   Other reviewers have called this property \"pricey' but what isn't at an airport? You can walk to and from the terminal indoors and park within a few minutes which is extremely convenient. All in in all, we were very satisfied with our stay and it didn't feel as if we were at an airport.  http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2630790-d96774-r330180277-Hyatt_Regency_Pittsburgh_International_Airport-Findlay_Township_Pennsylvania.html#"}
{"text":"I love this hotel for many reasons. We stay here every time we fly into Pittsburgh to do Steelers-related things. My wife and I arrive, stay at the Hyatt at the airport (because it's awesome and connected to the terminal - you don't even have to go outside). In the morning, we wake up, rent a car at the terminal and take off to Heinz Field. The next day, we check out, walk to the terminal and fly out. Every time we've stayed at this hotel, the experience has been great. The room service food is good, the staff is polite, and the beds are comfortable just like at any other Hyatt. The TVs are new, and the prices are very reasonable for what you get. This time around, Mr. Tom Hardy, one of the managers, even contacted me before I arrived to make sure that our needs were met. When I arrived, they really took care of us with a nice room. I took some pictures. I'm a regular customer and not some special magical dude. However, I always feel well taken care of by this hotel. We look forward to returning."}
{"text":"This hotel is very convenient to the airport. It is connected by a covered walkway to the land side terminal. This is very nice especially if you have an early morning flight. The staff was very nice and the room was clean. The hotel does offer self check-in/check-out service which is nice. You will have to pay for parking, but we purchased a room package that included parking. It was worth it for an over night stay and the convenience."}
{"text":"Das Hotel selbst ist sehr gut, normaler Hyatt Standard. Die Lage nur für jemand, der direkt am Flughafen bleiben will. Man kommt zu Fuß vom Terminal zum Hotel. Alles andere ist weit weg. Preise variieren extrem stark mit Buchungslage. Zuletzt musste ich hier fast 300 USD zahlen. Wegen der Lage bevorzuge ich eindeutig das Pittsburgh Airport Marriott. Frühstück sehr gut."}
{"text":"Very poor experience staff were not sincere when asking about stay. Room was dirty and although bed was comfortable linens were thin and stiff. Also no refrigerator. I felt nickel and dimed - Internet service 9.95 per day. Who charges for Internet any more? No coffee service in lobby? We where there with friends and security was pushy and intimidating. It was saturday night and the staff was over zealous at 9:30 were were told we need to get our rooms there a curfew. Sounds unbelievable. Hyatt Hotel management should get customer service training. Sorry it was not address will need to real think about staying with Hyatt again."}
{"text":"Love the bed and linens. Easy access from airport especially when getting in late. Ashley is great. I made it but my bag didn't so she got me some toiletries for the night!"}
{"text":"The proximity to the airport is amazing. My trash wasn't emptied but I didn't want to make a big deal of that ... but I went to plug in the lamp and discovered so much dust that I'm sickened. How can you be a high end hotel and let your guests sleep next to such filth? That's actually a health hazard. I'm only here for one night or I'd change rooms ... and honestly, I don't know if the other rooms are any different. Hyatt should hold itself to a higher standard."}
{"text":"Love staying at this hotel before an early flight.  The pool and gym are very nice.  Rooms are nice as well. I have ever eaten here so I can't comment on the food. There are lots of choices in the airport anyway. Nature's Kitchen has a location before going through security and is pretty decent for airport food.  I never needed to pay for parking, but have seen parking charges at other locations much higher. It is worth the price just for the convenience."}
{"text":"Worst hotel I've stayed at. Room was dirty, food and drinks were way overpriced and cleaning person just tapped on door then walked right in the room while I was still in bed sleeping! Not the kind of wakeup call I ever want to happen! I will NEVER stay here again."}
{"text":"We stayed at this hotel when it first opened years ago and loved it, but boy, has it gone down hill!  We needed to beef up our Hyatt stays/nights this year, so we opted for the airport Hyatt Regency instead of the Hyatt Place North Shore (which incidentally would have been much closer to our activities) simply for the reason it is Regency branded.   There is nothing \"regency\" about this location. We knew that there is no Regency Club, but our past experience led us to believe that in every other manner, this hotel would live up to its branding. We were given an upgraded room due to Gold Passport status. It was a corner room, referred to as a suite. The only thing that made it a suite was a small room with a dining table and four chairs. I think the bedroom itself was actually smaller than the regular king rooms as it did not have a desk. The closet was tiny. The hanging bar for clothing was hung so low that my mini-dress was dragging on the floor.  The ironing board was stashed in the closet at an angle which made hanging items even worse. Not only that, but the carpet in the closet looked like it had never been vacuumed as it was coated with dust.  The bathroom was standard. It had a mounted magnifying mirror and the lighting was not bad for putting on makeup. The bed was extremely comfortable but the linens were a little rigid.   Here's where things really got bad . . .   When we checked into our \"suite\" well after 4 pm, there was still a cart full of dirty plates and unfinished food in front of our door that stunk up the entire hallway (we were at the end).  We had to call to have it removed. When we left for dinner that evening, there was a pile of empty beer cans and pizza boxes on top of the garbage can by the elevator.  When we returned late that evening, it was still there.  As we were leaving the hotel the first day, we alerted the front desk that housekeeping could make up our room, and that we would like extra towels, and extra coffee and valet packets.  When we returned to our room, again after 4 pm, the room had not been made up.  We called the front desk and they sent the \"night crew\" to tidy up. They forgot to leave wash cloths; they forgot to replenish the coffee, and they forgot to leave coffee cups.  We had to call the front desk yet again for each of these items as we noticed them. In addition, they did not vacuum the floors. And remember the garbage can by the elevator with the beer cans and pizza boxes . . . still there when we left in the morning . . . still there when we came back late in the evening.  Once again, we called the front desk. The night manager Kevin was so apologetic.  He said he would take care of everything, and even brought up the coffee cups himself.  He was proactive and so on the ball, and maybe that's why it is a Hyatt Regency and not a Hyatt Place?  Kudos to Kevin for not passing the buck!  I never bring slippers with me, and no flip flops either.  Usually I don't have a problem walking on the carpet with bare feet at a Hyatt Regency property.  When I stepped into the white bathtub for my shower, gobs of dirt washed off my feet as they got wet.  It was pretty disgusting and just reaffirms what I said previously about the carpets not being vacuumed, and perhaps not even cleaned on a regular basis.  It was truly gross!  I'm not going to complain about no breakfast included, or the charges for internet and parking. My husband's Gold Passport status entitled us free internet and breakfast.  I will say that all hotels are starting to nickel and dime the guests for everything they can, just like the airlines do, so traveling as much as we do, we have become accustomed to it and bite our tongues when even the Gold Passport status doesn't give us a discount off the resort fees and parking.  Hyatt . . . please check this property for quality control . . . it would do a world of good.  Then again, it appears this hotel is sold out night after night and the guests pay top dollar, so they probably think, \"why bother?\""}
{"text":"The usual airport screwing, and then some.  This Hyatt has a monopoly on lodging at this airport and they take full advantage of it.  They charged a lot for parking, even more for the drinks at their bar, and on balance are not worth the money.  (Corporate drones with expense accounts, you may ignore my remarks, you don't care about the cost of your lodging or little niceties that one SHOULD be able to afford.)  Non-cost-related: Hallways smell musty, rooms don't have auto thermostats, only the old-fashioned fast-med-slow-off fan control and cooler-warmer temp control.  On the plus side, their gym is actually kind of nice - clean and well-equipped.  If you can get a Priceline or Hotwire deal this place isn't bad, but they'll get part of your savings back unless you don't have a car and don't drink."}
{"text":"Really disappointing hotel. Parking is expensive and you only get one voucher. There is only one restaurant and access to the airport shops and restaurants is only before 5 Monday through Friday. There is no microwave or refrigerator in the rooms. The construction on the way to downtown is miserable and never ending. I will avoid this hotel in the future. Expensive and very few enjoyable points. The restaurant is mediocre at best and also expensive with limited hours."}
{"text":"My wife and I were booked to stay one night as we were flying to Orlando early the next day.  We stay here often strictly for convenience.  You can read the other reviews to figure out my last statement.  Unfortunately,  my wife had a gulblatter stone issue the morning we were to arrive.  She was admitted to the hospital and scheduled surgery the following morning.   Stress started to rise as I had to cancel all of our reservations.  The two motels in Orlando were great to deal with, Hertz was wonderful, I had insurance on the flights so that wasn't an issue and then I had the pleasure of talking to the Pittsburgh Airport Hyatt.   I explained my situation to the fist person I talked to.  They were very pleasant but said we are sorry but you will be charged the entire cost of the room.  I then asked for a manager. The manager, after again explaining my situation, reluctantly agreed to give me a half price reduction.  I guess it was better than nothing.  Lastly, I told her to be sure to look for my review on Trip Advisor  and Yelp because it will be interesting.  I was pissed off.  I even offered to supply documents from the hospital but to no avail.  About three hours later I received a phone call from Hyatt upper management stating that I would receive a full refund and they were sorry for my wife's unfortunate situation and that we missed our trip.  I wonder why or how upper management got involved.  I guess the threat of a bad review did it.  Thank you Hyatt for doing the right thing.  I will continue to stay at your hotel in the future."}
{"text":"Proximity to airport is good. Room wasn't very clean. Turning on the bedside light you could see the dirt on the walls and the half assed attempt to wipe them.  The most disappointing thing was the shower.  It was pathetic.  Froze trying to get the soap off under the useless stream of water.  I think the rooms are in need of an update and some tlc."}
{"text":"$10 for Wifi! That should be included for the price of the hotel. It is very convenient though since it is attached to the airport."}
{"text":"Nice, clean room & really good food but of course pricey since it's connected to the airport. I would stay here again."}
{"text":"First rule of staying in a hotel is cleanliness.  It was not clean.  Only one towel and one washcloth, no soap between my wife and I.  Thank goodness we has antibacterial wipes in our car.  Next conference here, we will choose other"}
{"text":"Eh - as far as Airport hotels go this one is ok.  Comfy rooms. Decent amenities. Easy access. Nice views from floors 5 and up of the runway with planes taking off and landing - the view from the 6th floor was lush and nice that I left the drapes open the entire time I stayed there.  You can get here straight off your plane by taking the pedestrian walk way from the airport directly into the hotel. It's really nicely done and you get a good scenic view as you walk away from the airport and the major freeway.  Just be careful if you don't have plans to go into the city you might just get stuck indoors for two days!! :( There are taxis to the downtown part of Pittsburgh but it'll cost you a lot. Better just to rent a car and since you are at the airport it is really convenient. The hotel does offer shuttles services to a nearby mall but we were pretty busy with the wedding events to have time to jump on this service. Honestly, I don't enjoy staying at Airport hotels unless they are in the heart of the city - which you rarely find anyway.  I was there for a wedding so my review below is of the Regency Ballroom: Very spacious and great ballroom staffing! Everyone was so wonderful at the bar and at the tables. But the kitchen staff could have been a lot better at handling the food. The supervisors were pretty rude.   The great hall was massive and accommodated all 200+ guests at the wedding comfortably including the massive dance floor. :) The sound system was great and the DJ looked like he was getting the help and the assistance he needed from the hotel staff too.  Restrooms are nice and clean and close by to the grand hall. Great for the guests! Over all the banquet hall and experience was nice."}
{"text":"My wife and I debated long and hard to go with 3 stars versus 4 stars for this hotel. Ideally we'd give it 3.5.   Pros: -Location, location, location! If you have an early flight, you absolutely cannot beat this hotel. You check in the night before, park your car in extended stay and you are good to go. It offers a peace of mind you cannot get at any other area hotel. We even went into the airport the evening prior and stopped at the ticket counter and were able get our boarding passes printed out quickly since there were no lines. All we had to do at 4am was check our bag.  -Watching the planes take off and land. Always entertaining.  -Our room was clean and spacious. The bathroom was also clean and spacious. The shower had great water pressure. -We enjoyed the restaurant at the hotel. Our waiter was attentive and the food was really good. Honestly, I was a surprised at how good the food was.   Cons: -The noise level. It was already difficult enough to fall asleep knowing we had to be up at 3am, but it sounded like there was a large number of people having a party in their room (not sure which room(s) the noise was coming from) (we were on the 10th floor) and this went on for hours and did not end until at least 2:00 a.m. My wife only got about one hour's worth of sleep since we had to wake up at 3:00 a.m. to go check in at the airport. We most certainly did not get a decent sleep, let alone a good one. -Our toilet backed up several times (not of our own fault ) and we had to call for assistance. Thee staff was quick to respond, but we almost had to move to another room. -No refrigerators in the rooms. This is always a major negative for us when we travel."}
{"text":"We arrived by car, dropped off by friends, leaving the next morning early for sfo.  We were not met by greeter, bellhop or valet.  No carts for luggage.  We are senior citizens. The lobby was on the second floor and we had to lug our four heavy suitcases without help.  The hotel connects to the airport via a long walkway.  We inquired how we were to manage our luggage the next morning and we're told there was no shuttle or that we were on our own that the hotel had to cut back on expenses.  The manager was not very personable or concerned with our concerns asking if our suitcases had wheels.  This hotel is not for seniors or anyone with heavy luggage"}
{"text":"I actually had a great weekend stay here. Of course the major highlight is the proximity to the airport, but the room that I stayed in was  a very nice suite at the corner of the building. Both mornings I saw the sun rise in my windows, which was beautiful. Ordered room service for breakfast, which was vey good. I tend to rate hotels well because I love staying somewhere new, but I very much enjoyed my stay here."}
{"text":"Visiting this hotel from Philadelphia Pennsylvania. The parking is confusing as heck .... The hotel honestly isn't the best. The food is over priced . The only delicious food is the angus burger with fries . I went to the vending machine and got Aquafina water and I got this sparkling grape instead of regular water like the photo showed... so I had to get refunded by the  desk and waited until I got back on the road to get some regular waters . This place does not have a fridge in the room, and no gift shop. So if you need some extra goodies and pain meds , you must bring them yourself . Never rely on the hotel to have them . I learned that the hard way... this hotel however is very beautiful! But just needs some improvement.. the hotel is very very large , I'm surprised they don't have a little gift shop or fridges in the rooms .. luckily I had a little ice bag, but it couldn't hold much in it ..."}
{"text":"I should have my Elite status revoked for reviewing a chain hotel, but I had an unexpectedly good time at the Pittsburgh Hyatt for my sister's third and final wedding reception on Father's Day weekend and so it deserves a review.  Why does a Hyatt Regency get 5 stars?  - the hotel is attached to the airport, but far away enough from the tarmac so you can't hear the planes. That means you don't have to deal with traffic, crowds, or angry taxi/shuttle drivers - the hotel staff is pleasant, friendly, and helpful - the suites are large and comfortable while maintaining a solid middle-class feel for us non-rich non-snobbies - as a hotel guest, you get the privilege of running amock in the airmall after you are escorted through security by the police.  - the extremely well presented and executed dinner in the grand ballroom.   After I got off the plane and grabbed my luggage, I raced down the moving sidewalks, T-1000 style, and made a right turn into the Hyatt lobby in the span of about 3 minutes. I discovered that my spoiled ass got to stay in a suite. I really enjoyed having 5 pillows to lay my sleepy head down on after a bruising red-eye, even when I only used two and threw the rest on the ground just for fun.   When I was getting dressed for the wedding reception, I discovered that my new fancy shirt required cufflinks. Being a shabby dresser and a cheapass, I don't have cufflinks. With all the cars rented out for the US Open that weekend, I was limited on options. The front desk informed me that I could get a pass to go into the airmall, but I'd have to go through security. Another 3 minute walk back to the airport and an additional 20 minutes of dealing with cops and security scanners, I was back inside the airport with a good hour left to shop. I emerged victorious, garish American flag cufflinks in tow and a father's day present to boot.  I went to check out my sister's bridal suite. It was massive. I've been to the Century Plaza Hotel suite in Century City (just to check out the view, take a piss, and leave), and the Hyatt's room was just as big. However, the decor was less classy and the view far inferior - it overlooked the massive expanse of the airport parking lot. The best part about the suite was that there was a LCD TV in the bathroom. My bro-in-law said there's nothing better than taking a shower and watching TV at the same time, except for taking a dump and watching TV at the same time.  I helped with some of the pre-reception duties by ordering the workers around. They rearranged the tables and setup the DVD of my sister's wedding ceremony while barely putting up any attitude. Then the guests flooded in. I'm pretty sure every single Chinese person in Pennsylvania, New York, and Massachusetts was there. Soon afterwards, dinner began. The executive chef had created a special Asian-themed five course meal just for the reception, which included some fowl wrapped over mushroom, sweet peppers and sticky rice, to go along with filet mignon. I realized there was an open-bar, and with the assistance of awesome bartender Don, I proceeded to get drunk in front of my parents and my sister's in-laws. Oh yeah, that's why I had so much fun at the Hyatt."}
{"text":"Overall my first impression the hotel was nice. The location is perfect for the any early flight you have and you do not want to deal with traffic. The car rental is right across the hotel so highly recommend you drop your car off first and save those extra bucks.  The room was decent a little maintenance needed in our room. Was quite surprised on how thin the walls were. You can hear everyone talking from your room. You can even hear them when your walking down the halls. The rooms and halls have a bit of a mildew smell from possibly poor ventilation.   Overall bed was comfortable. Would I stay here again, sure just because of the convenience and the easy 5 minute walk to the gates."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff but they overcharge for services! $10 for wireless Internet? Really? $24 to print a few pages? $1.50 to copy one page? Absurd. I'm surprised they aren't charging me to take a shower."}
{"text":"I stayed here for a conference that was held here in the hotel. This is the only hotel that is connected via a walkway to the airport. Extremely convenient to grab a good nights sleep in between layovers.   The place is clean, beds comfy, service accommodating and friendly. I asked for an early check in and it was no issue at all. I was so thankful since I had been on a red eye flight all night.  The gym is open 24 hours and the pool and jacuzzi are open until 10pm. There is a restaurant and bar in the hotel lobby. Would stay here again if I'm ever in the area.  The hotel is far from downtown Pittsburgh and from things to do. I wouldn't recommend staying here if you are planning to tour around the burgh. It's a good place for airport oriented stays."}
{"text":"Now, maybe my review is negative because there was a dance/cheerleading/horrible competition occurring at the Hyatt Regency, but I swear, it was a nightmare.  From what I heard, the Hyatt Regency is supposed to rank under Hyatt Resorts. I mean, we all know why a resort would receive a higher rating, but I didn't know what was so special with this particular chain.  My room was small. It's odd when I noticed that the bathroom took up half the room. I honestly could've slept in there and been more comfortable. Moving on, the TV was tiny - so tiny that I missed my flat screen, computer monitor at home. Then there was a small section with a table and two chairs.  The room was honestly a narrow hallway aka solitary confinement. That's not even the worst part. No free parking. I understand that it's right next to the airport, but to have to \"clock in and clock out\" was beyond obnoxious. In just two days, I spent around $50 on parking alone.  I will never stay at this location again."}
{"text":"Lovely room, no complaint there, just beware of the restaurant!! Unless you get a kick out of paying about $8.50 (in total) per bottle of local beer - just served in a bottle without a glass, despite the fact that you are sitting down for a nice dinner."}
{"text":"Everything has been splended. We haven't been here more than a few hours and the room service was delicious (dude that brought it all up, his name was like Adam or Andrew or something, total sweetypie and listens to the same music we do!), they sent up care packages (all I said was that my boyfriend and I forgot a few things and they said hang on a few minutes, we're sending up supplies!), beds are comfy, huge tv, beautiful view, and the lotion smells great! Front desk girl was a cutie pie, total sweetheart. Boyfriend and I both said this was a great beginning to our vacation and want to come here for a few days just for a little get away soon."}
{"text":"I ended up with this hotel through a Hotwire purchase and it taught me something very important about getting hotels near PIT (Pittsburgh airport).  That if it doesn't say \"Free parking\" it most likely is this place.    The hotel I didn't have a problem with this place at all as a facility and a place to stay.  The staff was very professional and the rooms are clean and well kept but the one thing that killed it for me was the fact that this place is right at the airport and you will have to pay for parking for each day you are there.  If this was say a 65+ dollar deal on Hotwire it becomes an 85+ hotel a night because of the parking.  There are many other hotels in the Carnegie/Robinson area to be had that do not have parking charges.    To me this was the defining factor on what to look for on Hotwire pertaining to the PIT airport areas (there are about 3 or so).    Besides that it is very close to the airport itself so if you want the proximity, it doesn't get closer than this.  If you are like me and just like the western part of the city to stay so you can go shopping at Robinson etc then find another place."}
{"text":"Horrible service! Called ahead two weeks in advance for a crib to be placed in room. Crib wasn't there inspite of front desk saying that it was. Then after half an hour a broken pack and play was delivered to the room. Took another hour to fix."}
{"text":"Clean, modern rooms --- attached to the airport which is fabulous as it allows an extra 30-40 minutes sleep.  Self check-in kiosks didn't work (great idea - when they work) but staff was on-hand to help.    As much as I travel, I continue to be amazed that hotels charging $200+/night also charge $10-$20 a day for internet access. In lodging-land it seems Internet access is to 2012 what \"free cable\" was to 1984."}
{"text":"The hotel is lovely and extremely convenient to the airport. The wait staff in the restaurant were all extremely attentive. Our group had dinner there and most were very pleased with their meals. I had the crab cakes and while they were good there was very little crab and too much filling. If I come back I'll order something else."}
{"text":"The hotel is nice enough, and it is very, very convenient to the airport.  Food at the bar/restaurant is mediocre at best.  I ordered 2 items for dinner, and neither was as described on the menu.  Food was overcooked, soggy, gross and expensive."}
{"text":"If you are into getting screwed over by paying for wifi, parking,  breakfast,  and parking far then walking a long way in rain or snow or a long slow crappy bumpy crowded shuttle ride to your hotel after everyone is dropped off at the airport first this is the place for you :)   Only saving grace is the nice bed and piping hot  hot tub. The pool sucks it's shallow with just ladders and it's too cold. I only recommend if you are flying in or out.   FYI windows aren't really tinted the parking lot can see in your room while you stand naked drinking coffee watching planes land and take off."}
{"text":"I booked this hotel via one of the on line hotel booking services. Therefore the rate was very good. However the room was disappointing. Bathroom wasn't very clean only one soap nothing else. Parking is $25 a day if they handle your car or you have to park in the airport long term or short term parking.  I have had better experiences in more basic hotels. If you are on the road this is not the most customer friendly place due to the set up. They also have the ability to put a hold on your money but not seem to know how remove the hold. Although this is common practice I am not interested in waiting 6-7 business days to have access to my money.  No soul here."}
{"text":"As the name implies, this is an airport hotel, quite literally-- it is attached to the airport by a walkway through the parking lot.  As such, it's not a good choice if you're a tourist hoping to explore Pittsburgh, but it's great if you need a place to stay before or after a flight.  I stayed here Tuesday evening before Thanksgiving; the forecast was predicting snow, and while that proved pretty inaccurate, I felt safer being at the airport the night before instead of risking driving from Greensburg in a blizzard.  Everyone I spoke with on the phone was helpful, and they found me a room at a reasonable rate.  If you want to save a bit of money, ask for the room without a view-- your options are the airport view or the parking lot non-view, and I can't imagine the terminal is really all that scenic.  They have some parking deals, but it was much cheaper for me to drive to my normal off-site lot and then shuttle to the airport than it was to use one of those options (parking is very much NOT free, and neither is WiFi.)  The room itself was very clean and quiet.  The bed was comfortable.  The shower had decent water pressure.  The bar downstairs was overpriced, but it was nice to get a glass of wine easily.  There's also coffee and breakfast options.  Most importantly, my room was closer to the security line than a parking spot in long term would have been.  Obviously not a destination in and of itself, but if your destination is the airport at 6:00 AM, staying here can give you the peace of mind you need to make air travel bearable."}
{"text":"I am a member of Hyatt but I accidentally booked this hotel through hotels.com and that's where my disappointment started...   I was looking on hotels.com, clicked on the Hyatt information page for the hotel - and dialed the toll free number for what I thought was the hotel. Well it wasn't until the end of the call that I realized I was talking to hotels.com. and paid in advance.  I WAS NOT HAPPY and felt completely tricked.  On several occasions now I've noticed that if I book a hotel through any of the online travel services (presumably at a discount rate), the room I get is older, on a lower floor, the services are restricted (wireless, etc) and the hotel staff at check-in frown...  When we arrived, the front desk person found one of my reservations but couldn't find the second one for my business partner's room.  She looked under his name too and it was no where to be found.  I knew I had paid for the room in advance - so it had to be there, right???   After looking for several minutes the front desk girl said that she couldn't find it but had rooms available.  So, I said I would just go ahead and book it and then take-up the issue with hotels.com.  She said, \"good luck.\"  Oh to add insult to injury - the rate at the front desk was a better deal than what I got on hotels.com.  Then the clerk asked if I had my computer before booking the 2nd room for a 2nd time.  I did and she was very patient while I started my computer to find the confirmation (because the confirmation numbers I wrote down were from Hotels.com don't appear in Hyatt's system...   We found the 2nd room booked but mis-spelled under my name.  Problem solved.  But the rooms are on lower floors, worn-out, the TV is old, Wifi for those that book through online discounters is extra and parking is not covered..   After thinking about the situation for some time - I came to the conclusion that all of this - IS HYATT'S FAULT.  It is Hyatt's responsibility to protect their own brand.  All guests should be treated equally - and not with sour grapes just because they booked through a partner that they arranged in the first place.  Shame on Hyatt for setting up this whole silly system."}
{"text":"Sigh. Another sucky, soulless airport hotel. I stayed here during a work conference with a large group and was hoping for better.   The bad: a really small bar and restaurant area. Since you are at the airport, the only option for anything else was to walk across the pedestrian bridge back into the airport. Or you could have their shuttle take you somewhere but it was really busy the week I was there due to said work conference. If you do have a car, then you can park in the airport long term parking, but they had no in and out privileges so you either paid the daily rate ($7) or whatever the hourly rate came out to for shorter trips. Plus the parking is closer to the conference side of the hothel, so it was quite a hike through the hotel to get the front desk.  I also had pretty horrible service when I requested a late check out. I know I don't have any status with Hyatt but they were adamant about paying $20 for an extra hour. Seriously? The conference I was at spent a lot of money at the hotel and they couldn't waive that fee? They were just not nice about it and it really left a negative impression on me."}
{"text":"Not happy with this property - Room 936 has the WORST shower I have ever been in - and that is saying something.  I have stayed here 3 times in the last month and the rooms have gotten progressively crappier, and I am a Hyatt \"Diamond\" member!  I guess it's lovely if you enjoy lovely growing mold.  I also have an issue with the 70s style thermostat.  The people who work the front desk are very friendly, and breakfast buffet and service is excellent.  However if you have a crappy room it isn't worth it.  There is a Hyatt Place nearby for next time.  NO!!!!!"}
{"text":"Dirty washcloth and used soap were in my shower at the Hyatt Regency Pittsburgh International Airport. #gross #disgusting"}
{"text":"Had a reservation for 2 nights. Had to cancel due to the storm/cancelled flights. They charged me $181 for the cancellation. That's not how you run a business."}
{"text":"Total JOKE OF A HOTEL.  $239/night, PLUS $9.95 Internet, $3.50 water, no remote in room, and the WORST chicken wings I have had all month"}
{"text":"The only thing good about this place is the free wifi and the nice staff. No Parking really you want me to pay for a room and parking. Will NOT stay here again. Holes in sheets towels are shredded and half the lights don't work Don't stay here"}
{"text":"Nice room and location but my \"down\" comforter had no down. The other beds comforter was fine and full of fluff. Mine was flat and void of fluff. Weird. Had another brought that was a bit better."}
{"text":"Beautiful hotel walking distance from terminals. The lobby is very big with comfortable chairs very nice staff when you walk in and bar to the left of check in desk . In the rooms  I had two double beds with a good amount a space . There's a flat screen tv on wall . They offer dry cleaning and show cleaning options"}
{"text":"Not sure if this place is pricey cause its a HYatt or by the airport  but they dont give you a break on anything I been to better looking hotels that were cheaper to stay at then 280 a night and got free parking, wifi and food was less. I had to pay for long term parking 13 a day to leave the car here.  They wanted 10 dollars a day for wifi but I had it on my phone thankfully. And got a deal  200 percent off for place n priceline bidding.  I ordered a meal which cost 40 dollars for soup salad and desert and I had better the food wasnt high quality. Comfortable room very inviting roomy, 40 inch flat screen lcd tvs, lots of channels.  Older thermastats, no refrigerator or microwave. basic looking bathroom setup. place smelled new. Super comfortable bee with cloud like pillows. My room was across from the spa and fitness room was like a gym and yoga studio with a guy that maintained it every half hour so it was super clean they  had a fruit bowl of apples and purified water:) Had steam room sauna pool hot tub all that good stuff. Hotel smelled fresh and new. Im a smell person so it was a turn on:)"}
{"text":"Ehh. It's not great. My husband booked through priceline kind of last minute. We just needed a place for the night and we wound up stuck here. We were not flying anywhere.   They charged an extra $20 to park at the hotel and not in airport parking. The room was clean, but the beds are TINY. They should at least have queen size beds in there! The shower was okay but the bathroom didn't have a fan so it was super humid.  No fridge or microwave. We were on the 10th floor - there was an ice machine and soda machine but if you wanted a snack you had to go to the 2nd floor.   A bonus was that we didn't hear any noise from planes taking off but you could hear every word spoken in the hallway. Go figure.   Best part of this place was that they serve Starbucks coffee in the lobby. The woman working when we checked out made an excellent nonfat white mocha latte.   I don't think I'd stay here again."}
{"text":"The only hotel near PIT airport that is actually attached to airport. Extremely convenient. Don't mix up with the other Hyatt in the area which is not attached.   Con is you must pay for parking at the airport. Other hotels let you leave the car for free during vacation and let you shuttle to airport.   Hotel itself is very nice and in great condition."}
{"text":"It's convenient to the airport as you can walk here. But I will say the rooms need some serious attention to detail on the cleaning aspect.  The bed was hard and the sheets were too limited for my comfort. I like a nice comforter and it's just a cover sheet with a super thin blanket in between. My work put me up here but If I had a choice were to stay this wouldn't be it. The hallway smelled absolutely horrible when I got to my floor! Doesn't feel nice enough to be a Hyatt more like a motel 6."}
{"text":"I have stayed here on number of times when I visit Pittsburgh due to the extreme convenience of walking over to the hotel from the airport. But each time I've gotten progressively more disgruntled with the hotel. Lumpy mattresses, weird inconsistent towels one soft one not one old one new, I pulled out the ironing board to touch up a shirt and it looked like it came out of a Landfill, stained nasty no pad under it - just gross."}
{"text":"A major warning - this hotel permits smoking. Our floor smelled as though a chain smoker had walked up and down the floor at night. When I asked the front desk if it were legal to smoke in Pittsburgh hotels he said, \"um, not really but they let people smoke on a few floors in this hotel.\" Otherwise, the hotel was ok except the carpets are badly stained and the walls have some kind of water damage with visible bubbling and buckling of the paint."}
{"text":"Staff is very accommodating, restaurant is clean and nice. Food is good, not great, but nothing bad. Gym is above average and accommodations are current."}
{"text":"We booked here through a hotwire deal. After many nights of staying in disgusting cheap hotels, a Hyatt was a huge relief. It was clean and up to par with Hyatt standards. The parking situation seems daunting at first, but once we figured it out it was fine. Sucks that you have to pay for internet and parking, but other than that it was a luxury for us."}
{"text":"Great beds. A short walk from the airport. Gym overlooks the pool. I worked out twice I liked it so much. The staff was kind. The view sucked...from any angle. The indoor pool was large enough to do laps. This Hyatt rocks!"}
{"text":"This is a super convenient place to stay when you have an 'o dark:30 flight out of Pittsburgh International Airport which we did a few weeks ago. We had stayed here before however I have to agree with some of the other reviews. At a quick glance all seems well but if you take a closer look you see issues. The cleaning staff does not seem to be as attentive as years prior. The shower tiles had mold in the grout lines and the floors and carpet must get a super fast once over because the corners and under the desk area looked as if it had been missed for quite awhile. The bell service is very unfortunate for anyone who cannot haul their own luggage but there are carts available (either just inside or in the lobby). There are stairs to the main lobby or elevator. The front desk staff is quick and professional. The restaurant has good service and good food at customary hotel prices at this level."}
{"text":"I was flying to Pittsburgh and my flight was due in after midnight.  Rather than arrive at my destination at 3am, I decided to spend the night here.  It is great because it is essentially attached to the airport via a people mover.  Check in was pleasant and friendly.  They gave me a king as requested.   In fact, they gave me a king suite which was fantastic.  It had its on sitting room and a view of the airport and one of the runways.  I stopped by the bar for a quick drink.  The bartender was nice and they had a few beers on draft.  After the drink, it was time for bed. I pulled the black out shades and slept undisturbed.  I never heard any planes landing or taking off.  The bathrooms were nice, clean, and functional.  I even requested a late check out and that was no problem.    I was impressed with the staff, the cleanliness of the hotel, and of course the location.  Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I've stayed at this particular hotel during business travel and conferences on multiple occassions and have never been disapointed.  The rooms are modern and clean.  The catered meals and snacks I've been provided during the various conferences I've attended here have always been above average to excellent.  I've never had a single issue checking in or out and with the large amount of triaffic going through this hotel, I've never experienced any issues with noise or service.  There conference services including AV and IT set ups have always been top notch. This place would be on the cusp of 5 stars if not for having to pay extra for wifi within your room and the high prices at the bar.  Domestic beers and food at the in hotel restaurant aren't THAT good.  But other than those minor issues, this place is top notch."}
{"text":"Booked a room in this hotel because I had an early flight at 6am.  Amazing convenience to airport so you could roll out of bed and be in the airport terminal in 5 minutes!  Unfortunately my flight got cancelled so I slept in and enjoyed the 12 noon checkout!  We were able to rebook our flight and run into airport to get seat assignments... Come back to the room and go to sleep.  Pretty handy but I would only stay here for the purpose of easy access to airport."}
{"text":"Great if you are a weary traveler....not if you want a taste of Pittsburgh.  I fly into Pittsburgh a lot so I knew I was signing up for a true airport hotel.  The airport is literally attached to the airport, which after a long flight from the west coast, I appreciated.  You walk out of the airport, down the hall and the hotel is right there.  I did not park in the lot, I rented a car the next day so I did not have the parking nightmares that others have noted here.  Check in was nice and easy (no lines).  I went up to my room and was kind of under-impressed.  The cost of the room was pricey for an airport hotel and I kind of expected some water, fluffier pillows, wifi, I don't know something more for the 250.00.  The room was very quiet which I appreciate after a long day of trotting across the US.    I went down to eat at the restaurant around 4:30 and was told that they did not open until 5:30. The bar was open to serve bar food, but when I travel alone, I do not like to go to the bar.  I came back down for dinner and had a nice meal. The prices were not too bad and the service was great.  The staff was very nice, just not sure it was worth the price. If I am going to pay that much for an airport hotel I want a few extras...wifi, breakfast, coffee, something.  However the convenience was great after a long day."}
{"text":"Wow. No elevator service to second floor lobby so you have to lug luggage.  Invisible staff - in a bad way.  Litter throughout lobby.  Carpet tape showing; exposed video equipment cables.  Lamps in the room didn't have light bulbs; a sofa in a room by itself - no tables or anything else helpful.  Extremely limited television channel selection.  Disappointing."}
{"text":"I was really impressed with this hotel. The room appeared to be brand new and was immaculate. Nice restaurant downstairs with a helpful friendly staff. It is directly connected to the airport and there's no need get a cab or walk outside. I'm glad I stayed here rather than going downtown after a late flight."}
{"text":"The hotel is ok.  The biggest plus is it is attached to the airport.  The rooms are clean and the beds are comfortable.  That is important to me because my back can hurt if the beds are uncomfortable.  The bottom line is there is nothing special about this hotel.  It is expensive and nothing special."}
{"text":"I don't remember the last time I've given a place one star. [Full disclosure: I'm lumping the hotel with the restaurant (Olive Lounge).] But here we go....  I arrive at the hotel to check-in. The front desk employee is flippant with my questions and instead of doing the obviously, physically daunting task of checking me in - she points me to a screen and says I can just do it on there. Lazy much? Strike one.  I get to my hotel room. It's a decent size but I'm not too taken with the overall amenities. The TV remote does work. A light fixture is broken. The decorative basket in the bathroom is oddly discolored...almost rotting? Who knows. However, one positive was the make-up mirror in the bathroom. That was pretty great except for the horrible lighting...which I guess made the utility of said mirror moot?  The restaurant was not good. I had a steak salad for lunch which was not too bad but the staff was horrible. Two different waitresses were grumbling about work despite there being a minimal number of patrons. Breakfast here was not much better. The food wasn't very flavorful and the frittata offered in the breakfast buffet was brownish-GRAY and winkled up...I was shocked and repulsed. The coffee tasted burnt and had an off-tatse. I stuck to some fruit and yogurt. Yay for a $20 buffet. Last but not least, dinner. Our waitress took over HALF AN HOUR to get a bottle of wine to our table. It took even longer for us to get our food and bread basket. Also, the bread basket was was super salty and the bread was stale. When I mean stale, I mean it was hard to tear a piece of the bread off. When I say hard, I mean I had to literally put some muscle in it. The food was either bland or exceedingly salty. The only exception was their salmon which was expertly prepared every time I had it.   My next grievance comes from my morning routine of getting ready for an important meeting. What happened you ask? My hotel-supplied hair dryer didn't work. I called down to get a new one ASAP. It took 20 minutes.  My next issue was with the front desk again. I had a 40lb box of important papers, I needed to have brought up to my room. 3 hours and 4 requests later, I angrily marched downstairs to front desk only to see my box sitting on the ground behind 3 different front desk clerks. What did I do? I carried the darn box myself to my room...in my business clothes... which included 3 inch heels. THANK YOU, HYATT!  Oh what else...oh yes. We reserved a conference room but apparently the beverage catering people didn't come to work that day. I had to track someone down to simply get ice water for the room.   Never again, Hyatt. NEVER."}
{"text":"The hotel itself is not the best I've stayed at.... actually, it's pretty darn gross. The toilet bowl, for starters, was sooooooo disgusting. I think the bottom of the bowl had some material chipped off because it constantly looked like there were speckles of poop at the bottom!!! So so so gross! The shower has mildew in the corner. But the part that made up for the nasty bathroom was the phenomenal customer service....everyone from management to maintenance to house cleaning. I can't give enough kudos for the friendliness of each and everyone I came across. So for that alone, I would recommend this hotel."}
{"text":"Our stay was different from most of the reviews.  We were flying out a 7am the next morning.  I'm Hyatt Gold Passport member so we get free internet, otherwise it's like $10 per day which is crazy.  We dropped off the bags, checked in and then I came back to turn in the rental car.  We cleaned up and went to the airport and ate dinner in the Café, nothing super, but the food was OK and we didn't have to spend $30 a person for dinner in the hotel. We saved the extra day of Rental Car fees.  We were on the 11th floor and the room was clean.  The AC/Heat worked fine.  The TV was a different story, they have a HDMI input on the back so I want to use the bigger screen to some computer work, but they have the input locked out so you can't select it.  They also limit the volume which isn't a bad idea, just they need to give at least 50%.  We could barely hear it over the heat blowing.  Overall if you have a super early flight we can stay farther away and save some money or eat before you arrive, turn in the car and have a 10min walk across to the check in and TSA lines.  We got up and 4:30, took a shower, check out and then checked in at JetBlue, down to TSA and once thru there we had a lot of places to eat.  Most go to McD's but there are about 6 including TGIF Friday.  Then down to the gate and ready to board.  It was winter time and the last thing we wanted was to wake up to snow and have to drive to the airport in that. The closest hotel is about half the price of the Hyatt or $80 a night, add extra day of rental car and your up to $120, the Hyatt was $152 with tax.  For piece of mind we felt it was worth a few more bucks, in summer I would consider a close hotel that cost less."}
{"text":"Stayed at the Hyatt for a three day conference and was pleasantly surprised by the quality. Naturally, the hotel is very convenient as it's attached to the airport. The corner suite rooms are spacious and the entire property including the guest room and conference rooms are clean, bright and comfortable. The front desk staff was friendly. The banquet catering was some of the best I've experienced with fresh ingredients and ample choices. The actual restaurant leaves some to be desired as the space, atmosphere and food are good. But the service was very poor during my visit as I had to smile and flag down a server several times just to place an order."}
{"text":"Came into Pittsburgh for a work related day-trip focused on tourism and business travel. Our hosts from the airport scheduled lunch for us at the Hyatt's BellFarm restaurant. The place featured a farm-to-table menu and the food was outstanding. The staff was very friendly and the prices were reasonable.   I had the Yuengling-battered fish and chips (Yuengling is a western Pennsylvania beer producer)."}
{"text":"Our flight was delayed so we were unable to pick up our rental and get to our original hotel. It was 2am and we were exhausted from traveling.  We called the front desk and they were able to get us a room. It's a hike from the terminal so keep that in mind if you have bags.   Check in went smooth. The room was the issue. The beds appeared to be cleaned but the bathroom was horrible. There was hair in and on the toilet (I keep anti-bacterial wipes so I wiped it off) and on the floor. We were so tired we went to bed. The next morning we get up to shower and there was all kind of hair is the shower! You could tell the tub hadn't had a good scrub in a long time, there was a dirt ring in it. Makes you wonder if the room had been cleaned at all. We had to get on the road for a 2hr drive so we put on flip flops, took showers and packed up.   I went to the front desk and told them how dirty the bathroom was only to be met with a reply of \"sorry to hear that.\" Hmmm...we won't be back."}
{"text":"My flight was delayed and I was out on the next morning's flight instead. Since the hotel is in walking distance to from the airport, I decided to stay here for the night. Greeted by the front desk staff, very helpful and asked me what time was my flight the next day and told me I should give myself at least an hour to go through security. Room is very clean and spacious. The bed is very comfortable and great selections of room dining. Overall a very good experience staying here. Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Kuddos to Machell for her usual great service! The filet was cooked to perfection and the Pinot Noir was great. I look forward to coming back soon."}
{"text":"While the hotel is convenient, it is an old hotel with outdated carpet, furniture and amenities. I equate it to staying at a budget hotel; I don't believe it lives up to the Hyatt reputation. I do a lot of business travel and this is definitely not a hotel I would return to as I often stay for weeks or even months at a time in any given city - I didn't even want to take my shoes off when I got into bed. I was fortunate that I only stayed for the night in attempts to make my early am flight.  The parking lot isn't convenient, you have to park your car at long term parking which you're purely just circling through the airport for 10-15 minutes.   I was very hungry from my long drive from Erie, I reluctantly ordered room service and I was better off eating fast food. The utensils were old and the top that covers the food and keeps it warm did not look clean (had stains on it). The food was poorly presented and tasted like it was microwaved.   I'm giving this place 3 stars because of its convenience to the airport - direct indoor walk to the check-in counters and the staff was friendly. Btw, don't be fooled by some of the pictures that are posted, pictures do not capture the mildew on the grout in the bathrooms, or the broken furniture handles, the thinness or the holes on the bed coverings and the smell of cigarette smoke in the rooms."}
{"text":"I usually like high end hotels like the Hyatt because you can expect a certain level of service and amenities.  However, I was really disappointed with our room during a recent stay at the Hyatt Regency Pittsburgh International Airport hotel.  My family and I decided to stay there overnight prior to leaving on vacation.  (We've found that staying at the hotel the night before an early morning flight is less stressful than getting up at the crack of dawn and driving 45 minutes to the airport.)  That being said, we just like to kick back and relax the night before a flight and we were really surprised at the condition of our room.   The bathroom floor was actually dirty to the point where you could actually see the dirt.  Additionally, the floor tile was discolored in places.  The bathtub could have also received a refresh.  I was really surprised that everything was just so-so. (I had experienced this during my last stay in July, but I had hoped that was just a fluke.  It's not a fluke, unfortunately.)  $140 plus dollars for a single night at a just okay hotel is a bit much.  It's definitely not what I expect from a Hyatt.  The only thing that took the stay out of the realm of a bad experience was the fact that my server at the Bellfarm Kitchen and Bar restaurant was extremely friendly.  Other than that, I have to try and find a more suitable hotel substitute now that I know that the hotel hasn't been updated in a while."}
{"text":"This place has a nice lobby and convenient since it is attached to the airport, but it ends there.  Pictures speak a thousand words... Dirty, dirty and very dirty room. Not what you expect from a Hyatt."}
{"text":"Probably the dirtiest hotel room I've experienced in over a decade. Service is non-existent. We called the front desk and asked for a blanket. We were given a sheet that may have been a comforter 20 years ago. They obviously stay in business due to their walking proximity to the terminal at Pittsburgh International, but this property is more consistent with a flea bag interstate motel than its purported 3 1/2 star rating."}
{"text":"So this hotel is a bit expensive for what it is. We have stayed here three times and the rooms are cleanish. This time, Aug 2017, there were a few cleaning issues (pics).  The bedding is a bit worn, garbage cans beat up and decor a bit dated. It is great for being right at the airport but it needs some love."}
{"text":"I've stayed here every Thursday night for Jan-April in 2011 and then a few nights in August 2011. This hotel is decent. The rooms have been re-done even though the outside of the hotel looks like it is older. The heater and A/C units in the rooms work well consistently. The food has some real issues. Consistently the food was pooooor. After speaking with the food services manager they made strides to improve it. In August it appeared to be back to the blah status it was in early 2011. The front desk is nice and acknowledges the status of the customer. Some are really loud and like to announce to the whole lobby that you are using a certain credit card at a certain room rate...that was weird. Anyways, overall the location is the best for an early flight. It is a very quiet hotel and overall a good choice."}
{"text":"Absolutely unbeatable convenience if you need to be at the airport early or get in late. Special thanks to Eliza on the front desk for being especially warm and welcoming -- outstanding service!"}
{"text":"After a postponement, countless conversations with Northwest and then Delta, and loads of anticipation, my second trip to the 50th state and my first to Hawaii's Big Island was underway.  Spending the night at the airport prior to my 6:40 AM flight on a Saturday was the only answer.  This was my first time at the Hyatt and it was very nice.  The lobby is very inviting, the desk service was friendly, helpful and efficient.  The room was modest in size, but very nicely decorated and quite clean.  We had a king room, and there was a nice ~42\" LCD TV at the foot.  The bathroom was clean with a great shower.  The sink fixture was a little odd, too small for the sink, and set a little too far back from the bowl.  I had requested a \"honeymoon\" room when reserving online and they came through.  The put me in an extremely quiet room, well away from the elevator and stairs.  The biggest downside is that there is a premium to pay for the convenience.  The cost of the hotel is higher than what you'd pay off airport premises.  Overall, this was a very good value and a tremendous experience.  We took a bottle of Cava, chilled it in the ice bucket and relaxed the evening prior to our long flight.  Finally, be warned, there is another Hyatt not far from the airport (a few exits down PA60).  It is deceptively named, Hyatt Place Pittsburgh Airport.  There was a couple at the desk when we arrived that was dealing with cancelling a room in the wrong hotel and getting a room in the airport property.  Be careful when reserving."}
{"text":"Nice for hanging out before flight.   My husband and I had lunch here before my flight.  We sat at the bar and we're waited on quickly.   I had a veggie burger that was quite tasty, but kind of fell apart into a bit of a mess.   Other goods.  Bright.  Modern.  Outlets at bar for phone charging.  Healthy options Nice bartender  The bads Forgot drink,  but eventually got it Biz center for printing was Expensive,  but Woman at the desk printed for me  So overall,  we will stop again"}
{"text":"I sent a reply to the generic concierge email with my parking receipt and received a response that they would address the issue and refund my $13 because of the misinformation.  I am very happy with the excellent customer service!"}
{"text":"Oh my gosh, I couldn't wait to inform the yelp community about the brutality I experienced at this wretched hotel but then I realized I am in good company.  Most of the other reviews are sub par as well.  It wasn't for a lack of research that I ended up at this hotel.  We were here for a wedding so I was forced against my will to stay here for three nights.  We tried to check out after the first night but it just didn't end up being worth the hassle so we sucked it up.  Ok I don't even know where to start this complain-fest.  Upon arrival we realized we had to park in long term airport parking and it was going to cost $13 a day.  So as soon as we checked in I inquired about that because you aren't allowed to come and go, you get a new ticket with each exit/entrance.  That would have cost us more than $13 per day doing it that way so I was really confused.  We were not there to just hang out in the hotel all day/night so I was sure they had some type of resolve to this policy.  Umm. No.  They didn't.  The resolve was to keep checking their front parking lot because that one is $25 for the day and you can come and go as you please.  So you MAY save a couple dollars doing it that way.  WHHHHAAAT?  Are you guys crazy?  Who is going to pay to park at a hotel?  I think even hotels in NY validate your parking.  That is just ridiculous.  Moving on...  As soon as we were checking in we could tell this just wasn't going to be a good place to stay.  The check in desk was so crowded...it was full of pilots and flight attendants and businessmen that were only here for one night.  This was an airport hotel and you could just tell.  They weren't trying to make you comfortable.  They were trying to get as much out of you in the quickest amount of time possible.  They want you in, want to rob you and then want you OUT.  Got to the room on the 9th floor and the beds were so small and the room just felt cold and uncomfortable.  ZERO amenities, no free wifi (had to go to the lobby for that), $3.50 for the bottle of water, no free breakfast or anything for that matter, no fan in the bathroom, they set the volume on the TV, limited TV stations, view was of the parking lot, my feet hung off the bed, there was a plastic diaper cover over the beds because it was a \"pure room\" and that was there way of making it hypoallergenic, people at the front were super rude, there were like 10 rooms booked by our family for the wedding and we were all on different floors, etc etc etc.   The actual wedding was gorgeous here and the food was fantastic!  I don't know who handles that aspect of this hotel but that is where they \"shine.\"  The $20 buffet was worth about 10 but they at least offered cage free eggs and uncured bacon along with quite a few other yummy items.   We called to complain after the first day we were here about the parking and some things and asked if we could just check out but of course they said no because we needed 24/hr notice.  The next day we had housekeeping show up to clean out our room because they were told we checked out.  We corrected them but when we actually went to check out they still had record that we already did.  Super odd.  They gave us parking vouchers after begging for them so I wish they just included that for all guests.  It would be a really nice \"hospitable\" gesture.  I would NEVER stay here again.  The beds were uncomfortable, the expenses were through the roof and the service was pitiful."}
{"text":"Decent hotel, just not for extended stays.  I stayed for a couple weeks since hotels closer to the city were booked and the commute is about 30 minutes to and from downtown Pittsburgh (45 minutes to an hour during peak rush hours).  There are restaurants within about a 10 minute drive if you don't want to eat at the airport or the hotel restaurant.  The rooms have pretty new TVs, but the channel selection is limited (networks, sports, news, FX, Discovery, TBS, HGTV, vanilla HBO, and not much else) and the picture was blurry.  The ice machines were pretty dirty and left some little black specks in my ice bucket.  My room didn't have a refrigerator and I was disappointed to not have a complimentary breakfast.  Free wifi was included and a glitch in their login system gave me a free upgrade to the premium wifi a few nights.  Speed was good enough for Netflix on my laptop (~1-5Mbps).  Housekeeping did a pretty good job.  Towels were replaced daily, sheets every other day, glasses every other day.  Unfortunately, housekeeping sometimes came late in the day.  Two days housekeeping wasn't finished before 5pm, and I just put up the do not disturb sign one of those days when they hadn't come by 6.  Parking gets pretty expensive.  You get the option of hotel parking at $25/night with unlimited entry and exit, short-term airport parking at $4/hr up to $24/entry, long-term airport parking at $3/hr up to $13/entry, or extended airport parking at $8/entry.  The hotel lot is much more convenient than the others, but you pay extra for it.  I lucked out and parking wasn't added to my bill, but this was almost certainly a fluke. Overall, the hotel isn't great, but it isn't bad.  If you just have to stay overnight between flights, the convenience is great, but if you are going into town or staying a while I'd recommend somewhere else.  The cost is too high for what you get."}
{"text":"Checked in late on a Friday, the hotel was staffed extremely well at the front desk with friendly staff. I was checked in quickly, and able to get to my room after a long day of travel. The hotel is in walking distance from the airport. The room was spacious and clean. Great place to stay if you are flying into Pittsburgh. Only negative is you have to park on the long term airport lot and pay for parking daily. If you are renting a car wait and pick it up when you need it to save on parking."}
{"text":"Ill equipped. That's what comes to mind when I think of the Hyatt near Pittsburgh International Airport. Sure it looks all nice in the lobby but first impressions can be deceiving.  My boyfriend and I booked this hotel a little short notice I will admit. While I've seen worse, the price we payed it certainly should have been better. When we booked the hotel, it gave the illusion that there was paid parking. However, there were only about 12 parking spaces which forced us to park in airport parking...an additional $13 later.   We get in and settled into our room to find out our sink doesn't work. Josh tried to do what he could and after a few tries we called the front desk to get someone to fix it. The plumber came, tried, and failed to fix the clog. It only took him 20 minutes to realize it was not getting fixed.   He followed us down to the front desk where we finally got a new room. The time now is about 12:15am. We get settled into our new room to find that this sink does not drain correctly either, but at least the water would go down. Slept on an overly form mattress and laid our heads on some of the tiniest pillows I've ever witnessed in a hotel.  Woke up and proceeded to get out showers. Fun fact: there's not air vent to suck out the humidity from the bathroom so it looked like you were walking into a rainforest. Which would explain why the wallpaper on the sides and ceiling were starting to bubble and peel.   For a 3.5 rated hotel, it's very misleading. I'd say it was around a 2 star standard. If you need a hotel, save yourself the stress, drive 15 minutes and get some place worth staying for the money you'll pay."}
