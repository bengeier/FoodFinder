{"text":"I normally don't care for the atmosphere of a place- unless of course it's really really bad.

But this location is nice, well kept and is peaceful- perfect to go with friends or by yourself if you want something cheap and awesomely tasty! The menu is quite variegated and quite cheap for the portions you get. Be warned- they can be large.

My favourite is the rice and curry chicken- for about $5 you get a tasty dinner-size meal and it's delicious! They also have the usual assortment of beef and pork varieties- nothing unusual or quirky- just great service at an even better price.

The owners are usually there to greet you and they make the food too. They're very friendly, very well mannered and for some reason even the teeny-boppers who end up there act behaved as well.

I'd highly recommend this place to anyone who wants a quick cheap and great tasting meal. Head down there, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Just had a very quick light dinner at River Tai.
Old school (home style Cantonese and not fancy resto.. 1960's decor). Sure nice elder owners. Family resto. Very inexpensive. We tried : Cantonese chow mien and veggies and tofu on rice. Both were yummy."}
{"text":"We were in the area and felt hungry, so stopped in this family-run place. First thing to notice was the kindness of the owner who greeted us. We were seated in an empty restaurant, wherever we wanted to sit, in a spring Saturday afternoon. 

Place looks very average and old school, check the photos on the wall and just look around. it is like going back in time, but that doesn't bother us.

Menu has a lot to choose from, we were struggling, but made a choice of Shanghai noodles and some other noodles. That was a mistake, as the noodles ended up being too oily and it looked and tasted a bit weird. One of us lost her appetite on Shanghai noodles, while the other had to share her reminder with her :)

Food was cheap and portions big, too bad we couldn't finish it all. 

Do not feel like giving another chance, as this place is just average and there are many like that in the Hogtown."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant - it is an example of the hard-working family business that our country was built on; plus the food is delicious. My favourite dish is the egg noodles with beef and Bok choi."}
{"text":"Old school (but clean) restaurant run by an exceptionally kind elderly couple that serves decent Cantonese food near UofT. The hot & sour soup is authentic and BBQ pork is great considering most meals are under $5 here."}
{"text":"I tried this restaurant while I was going to school in the area and I have to say that it is incredible value and incredible taste. The barbecue pork fried rice is less than $5 and is to die for. It is owned by the nicest old couple and it has been here for a good amount of time. If you are looking for a no frills, cozy, great food, great service place, check out River Tai."}
{"text":"The food is generally good but the portions are rather small. The prize is very affordable - the cheapest meal is $3.99 plus tax! I also like how convenient the location is as it is close to downtown UofT campus."}
{"text":"I've been eating at River Tai for over a decade now and have never been disappointed. The prices cannot be beat (they have a whole list of meal-sized dishes for $3.99 all day every day!) and it all tastes delicious. They owners are a very kind elderly couple who have always been happy to accommodate my requests. Although the decor is not \"modern\" (and has not changed over the decade I've been eating there--why should it?), the restaurant is clean. The clientele is a wide mix, but appears to mostly be long-time regulars (always a good sign) and students. Great hot and sour soup."}
{"text":"Stepping into this restaurant is like stepping back in time.  Nothing has changed since the 1990s.  Even the prices are still the same (or at least very close).  Heck even the take-out menu is literally exactly the same, recognizable by the fact that the printed phone number predates Toronto's 10-digit dialing.

As for the food, I honestly have no complaints.  It's not gourmet level food, but it's well worth the price and bottom line is it tastes good.  Exactly what you'd expect from a small family run business like this.  The Day Specials at $3.99 are the best deal.  I particularly like the BBQ Pork Fried Rice.

So if you're in the mood for some good cheap Chinese food, I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"River Tai is a hidden gem.

It's a hole-in-the-wall classic Cantonese restaurant. I know some people have been put off by the $3.99 special because it is so cheap that they question the quality of the food but you don't get a huge portion (perfect for lunch). The appearance of the restaurant is clearly not super enticing but I always do take-out and the food is great (the owners are also super nice)! Try it out, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Really average food, nice owner. Had the bbq pork rice, it comes slathered in a oyster-saucey, well, sauce. The price is probably the best thing, it cost me 5 dollars in total and the plate was of a decent size. Probably won't go back unless i was starving."}
{"text":"Tasty, basic Chinese/American Chinese - nothing groundbreaking, just the \"classics\" done well and at great prices. 
Exceptionally kind service, can even hear the smiles of servers/owners when I place an order over the phone."}
{"text":"So glad to have discovered this gem downtown! Extremely close to UofT and to Robarts, and is amazing for students. The food is cheap, SO good, portions are generous, and service is great. Got the BBQ pork with fried rice and have constantly been coming back for more. Brought friends here recently and they said this place has the best hot and sour soup they've had and is all very authentic. Will be back a lot!"}
