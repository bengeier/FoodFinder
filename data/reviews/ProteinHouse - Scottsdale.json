{"text":"Worst pancakes you'll ever have. If you like the consistency of a kitchen sponge, then you'll love these cakes. So dry that no amount of syrup could possibly rehydrate them.  And butter? What's that? No saturated fats up in here! Seriously though, the flavor was very bland- you can tell the water and whey protein robbed these cakes of any flavor. You'd just think at an $11 price point, these would be so much better. Disappointing. The place was clean, and the service was decent though, so it gets just 2 stars."}
{"text":"Wonderful healthy eatery!  The owners and staff are soooooo nice and they do business with INTEGRITY!!!  They keep food standards high-using organic foods as much as possible, focusing on quality and healthy meals.  Clean eating that's affordable and convenient. Staff is very helpful and knowledgeable about nutrition and specific diet needs.  Bowls are amazing, good portion size and such a perfect menu for a healthy meal.  The sexy bitch bowl is great with salmon or steak and love the grain options of quinoa, while wheat pasta, even sweet potatoes!  This restaurant is super clean, immaculate actually!  We stop here daily because Protein House is simply delicious and our favorite place to eat healthy, real food!   Make sure to try the pancakes too & chicken/black bean whole wheat quesadilla!     And the Greek yogurt is amazing!!!!  Perfect summertime meal.  Keep up the great work guys-we are daily regulars and love what you do!!!!"}
{"text":"They're still working out some kinks, which is to be expected during a restaurant's opening week.  Met a friend for lunch, it was pretty crowded and the line didn't move very quickly.  You need to read a paper menu to really understand what you're ordering, as the menu above the cashiers doesn't provide much detail.  I ordered an Aloha burger (grilled chicken teriyaki) and an iced tea and my bill was about $13.  My burger had choice of sides including fruit (my pick), greens, mashed sweet potato and sweet potato sticks.  I assume the sticks were oven roasted s. potato slices and that they don't deep fry them?  Might be helpful for the cashier to provide some info on that.  My meal was good, overall.  The bun was ok, the chicken was not overcooked, pineapple was perfect.  Maybe a bit too much teriyaki sauce, and the chicken cutlet went over the side of the bun by quite a bit, so made it a little awkward to eat.  Overall, I'd say it was a good meal, but a little pricey for lunch (my choice was one of the less expensive ones on the menu--some bowls are over $15).  Because of the restaurant's emphasis on nutrition, I expected to see nutritional information for menu items posted, but that was not the case. Maybe they could print some out for customers?  Otherwise you need to check calories on their website.  The portion size for my meal was perfect, but my friend ordered one of their bowls and was overwhelmed by the amount of meat/chicken in the bowl. I'd say most bowls could be shared by two people.  Again, pretty good but a bit pricey for fast-casual.  I'll definitely try it again though."}
{"text":"Been there three times can't stop eating the breakfast burrito and the PB&J pancakes. I think I'm addicted to the great food, atmosphere, and friendly staff. Try the cookies and cream coffee it's awesome."}
{"text":"Love this place. Healthy yummy food, and quick service. I went there for dinner, but definitely going there to try the brunch."}
{"text":"Loved, loved loved the service and the food! Fantastic peanut butter cookies . Definitely try this place !!!"}
{"text":"Protein House - fail, got a take out salad, with maybe 2.5 oz grilled salmon on it, partially the fatty end, bleh, and then the apples slices still had seeds and partial core on them - cmon for the $14 price tag I would have been better off at the Whole Foods salad bar!  Not worth it, over priced and pretentious."}
{"text":"Overall was good food and drinks! But sadly I won't be coming back due to one employee who was a barista, I believe her name was \"Kat\". She had a nasty attitude and was unbelievably unfriendly. Working in management in the food and beverage industry I would never hire someone who presented my company name as she did."}
{"text":"Great food with the Macros broken down on their to-go guide. The PH burger made from bison was delicious. Pricy, but worth it to eat clean."}
{"text":"Kind of disappointed in this place. I was excited when it opened since I live right down the street.   My boyfriend and I decided to try it out over the weekend - we only had about 40 min before my boyfriend had to go to work, and since you ordered and sat down we thought that would be more than enough time.   I ordered oatmeal which was so sticky and had no taste. The juice I had was thick and gritty like a shake. I don't know how you can screw up juice and oatmeal. My meal came out first and I just picked at it for about 15 min. The manager brought over a protein bowl and we told her we ordered a burger. The name of the bowl and burger were very similar and since we are not familiar with the menu I questioned if we ordered the wrong item. She continued to repeat the bowl name and rolled her eyes at us twice, like we should have known what we ordered - which was a burger, not the bowl. She walks away and does not apologize or say your order will be right out. After 35 min of waiting for his food, it turns out, the manager brought the wrong order to the guy sitting next to us. They gave him our burger as well as the bowl. At this point, my boyfriend was late for work, so we asked if we could have our money refunded - for the $18 burger! That's insanely expensive. The manager was so rude about it, continued to roll her eyes, credited us back and walked away. Did not apologize or anything. Then the cook in the back was just staring at us like we did something to him personally.   My boyfriend is in the food and beverage industry and manages a restaurant. We were both appalled with the service, food, etc.   Good luck staying open."}
{"text":"I love the pancakes and protein cookies here but the past couple times I have ordered the thai monster bowl and both times the meat was overcooked and super dry. Also, the staff members I have encountered are not very friendly :("}
{"text":"The food itself taste amazing. But I would NOT recommend the meal prep option. I ordered meal preps with the 3oz of chicken (even though I really needed 6oz but it was too expensive so I settled for 3). When I got home I took all of the chicken out of TWO meals and weighed them. Together they hardly added up to just under 4oz. Which means each of my \"3oz meals\" had about 2 oz of chicken in reality. When you are counting macros this is a vital thing that you have the correct amount of meat portions. I was disappointed to say the least. I pretty much paid $86 dollars for hardly 3 meals since now I have to combine the proteins to meet my macros."}
{"text":"My daughter and I ate diner at PH and we're excited to try it out. I ordered the PH burger and she got the Cajun chicken bowl. We were both really disappointed with the taste of the food....super bland!!!! We cook and eat clean all the time and both walked out feeling super let down and that we could have done much better at home and saved $27. The bison was dry and way over cooked. The sweet potatoes weren't sticks they were chunks. Maybe the breakfast foods are better?? I doubt we will risk it!"}
{"text":"Overall the portions are perfect and the food tastes great.  It is more pricey, but well worth it's price.  The atmosphere is great.  I had the teriyaki bowl with quinoa.  The salmon was cooked well, it was very meaty and a nice size.  The quinoa was fluffy and warm.  The vegetables tasted fresh.  I'll be back, but not daily because of the price.  Worth a try."}
{"text":"Love his place  Very clean food , very tasty  Great atmosphere and friendly staff  All types of meals to satisfy ur craving for the day"}
{"text":"Great concept but lackluster execution!   My biggest gripe is in the details everywhere. For a niche healthy place, it's not cheap.  That being said, I expect every detail of my meal to be fresh and tasty. I ordered th veggie omelette  (needs garlic, pesto, ketchup something), and it was bland but chock full of veggies.  The fruit cup was really sad (a small bowl of honeydew which is the worst fruit), and the juice offered (extra ginger) was overpriced and I couldn't taste the ginger.   Go somewhere else if you want tasty food or go somewhere else if you want bang for buck."}
{"text":"This location is very close to my house and since I've been juicing lately I wanted to try it. It's good but the service isn't super friendly. I prefer Nekter where the juices and service are much better."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place.   Always try to eat a meal here when I am in town. I have had a number of dishes like the Thai Monster, sexy bitch and the ninja burger. All delicious!!!!  Looking forward to trying the Boss bowl.  What I love about it is you never feel bloated when leaving and it fits within eating good and lean.  I am trying the peanut butter cookie with 18g of protein which will be good to hold me over on my flight home."}
{"text":"Delicious. Heathly!  Perfect place to eat post a four and a half mile hike . Will totally be back.      A must try for all."}
{"text":"I ordered a 24oz Green Monster Juice, which is under their category of cold-pressed juice. I love pressed juices and have never tried one here before so I thought I would give it a try.  I ordered it to-go, and it wasn't until I was home when I realized 4/5 of the whole drink was this strange foam. I have never seen a cold pressed juice foam like this, it wasn't even juice, it was all residue in a large cup. Not only didn't it look right, it didn't taste good at all either. The fact that I payed $9 for foam is beyond me.. I also got a Power Wrap which was OK, nothing too special, a little too bland for my taste. This was my first ever purchase at the Protein House and I was highly disappointed with what I received, won't be going back. Love that they have plenty of vegan options but just not worth it."}
{"text":"Truly, truly disappointing \"event\", yet refreshing customer service and meal. So what do I mean with that statement?  Allow me a moment to clarify. I've frequented this location a good number of times.  In fact, I've brought co-workers, business guests and family members here.  Almost \"all\" have raved about the meals they have purchased; the \"others\" are just some of my co-workers for which it is seldom they say anything good about a restaurant or meal.  But I digress. On this visit, I purchased my usual (LR Steak Burrito) and anticipated the usual wait time of 10-12 minutes.  Unfortunately, and even with a fairly low number of customers (it was 11:39 when I placed my order), I was completely overlooked! Overlooked?  Yes.  In short, and after 20 minutes of watching other patrons come and go, I went up to the counter (waited another 5 minutes as they assisted others), and then was asked if I wanted to place an order! \"No\", not smiling either. Anyway, and as it dawned on the young lady at the register that she had forgotten about me, I asked for a refund. Now the \"good\".  Not only did she immediately apologize and provide a refund, she gave me \"my\" bag of food which was on the shelf behind her (for the past 15 mins - how do I know? - I watched her put it there while I was sitting a few tables from the register - just had no idea that was mine! - yes, was a bit cold, but still delicious). Anyway, this one-time disappointing experience will NOT stop me from frequenting the PH."}
{"text":"Hey, gonna be totally honest... This place is too expensive ?. The reason I'm leaving a star is because  of the great staff service from the barista Caelyn!"}
{"text":"I've seen friends post their food from here and it always looks delicious so we decided to try it tonight. I ordered the PH burger with the sweet potatoes and all I have to say is, don't order it. Super bland and the potatoes tasted like they were pre cooked and just reheated. Will I be back? Maybe to try the breakfast but I will not waste my money on the burger again."}
{"text":"Concept and atmosphere are great! Food is only okay, but WAY overpriced. I won't be coming back  even though I had hopes for this place."}
{"text":"This place is in walking distance of my apartment and I just love going there. To me it seems a little pricey but everything is really good. For a while they were having daily discounts and I was going every day, then they stopped and because of the price I go maybe once a week now but everything they've made is delicious very clean great atmosphere great location. If they start doing daily specials again I will definitely try to make it by daily or at least 3four times a week it's worth it."}
{"text":"This place has everything you want if your looking to eat a High Protein clean meal! The Chef has created some great bowls-wraps-salads-with BISON-Fresh Salmon & a Plant Powered Protein (Vegan) options!! Lots of Protein Smoothies-Cold Pressed Juices & even a complete Espresso & coffee menu!! Clean-Lean-Eating!!"}
{"text":"Great addition to the area.  My wife had something called the \"Sexy Bitch Bowl\".  I had the \"Thai Monster Bowl\".  Both were fantastic.  Loaded with fresh vegetables and lean protean over tasty brown rice.  Each with their own unique sauce.  Both were only about 500 calories, perfect for lunch after a workout.  The location is tight across the street from Life Time Fitness."}
{"text":"I had high expectations for this restaurant, but it ultimately came up short. The atmosphere is nice and the restaurant looks clean, but it's still a counter-style restaurant and the prices are undeniably inflated. The service is also extremely slow considering it's set up for quick dining. The food wasn't bad, but it definitely lacked flavor and originality. I also found it disappointing and concerning that a restaurant catering to the fitness conscious offers NO nutritional information. Lastly, the staff seemed untrained and uninterested. Kristen rang up my meal and not only was she extremely rude to my friend and I, she overcharged me almost $5. Overall a very disappointing experience."}
{"text":"Amazing food, amazing shakes, AWESOME VIBE. Love it here! Protein house is a definite must try."}
{"text":"This is my go-to spot when I am in town from Los Angeles.   It's comforting to know that there is a place that sells nutritious foods cooked by caring people who have your health in mind.  People may say it's pricey, but I am paying for what they DON'T put in the food (preservatives, fillers, junk etc). Everything tastes great.  Nothing on the menu sucks.   Jenna is especially helpful at the counter as she is very kind, warm, informative and has that \"it\" quality when it comes to customer service.  Most people do not have that.    Please visit and you will not be disappointed. That being said, nothing is perfect and don't be an asshole to the people who work there and everything will be peachy"}
{"text":"Love this place!  Super healthy protein foods!  Great energy and excellent friendly service."}
{"text":"If you are looking for some quality protein, this might be the place. But if you want some decent food, please try somewhere else. This place feels more like a science/fitness lab than a restaurant."}
{"text":"Protein Protein Protein!  A Lot of it.  Great alternative to other fast causal spots in the valley if you're looking for a healthier choice - Wishing they would open one closer to downtown PHX.  Enjoyed a few meals here since they opened and haven't been disappointed.  Thai Bowl was phenomenal!  Owners were there handing out samples of the Smoothies and if my meal was not so filling I would of ordered the Peanut Butter one one the spot.  I will have to make a separate trip just for that!"}
{"text":"Great place to stop after the gym or for a quick lunch. I tried a salad and a green smoothie. Both were amazing. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Nice clean restaurant with healthy, fresh, reasonably priced, delicious food. I will become a regular here, and I wish there were more places like this. Can't give it 5 stars because of a few minor details. Iced tea tastes like instant - wish they had invested in a yummy brand like China Mist. No butter or smashed avocado for my toast. All they had was sugary jelly, which is definitely not healthy in my book. Couldn't find a salt shaker with more than a few grains in it. Even so I highly recommend if you want a veggie/protein packed yet tasty meal."}
{"text":"Southwest Bowel had zero flavor even after I added hot sauce. Bright, airy place with a bunch of TV's. Hard, uncomfortable chairs."}
{"text":"Solid, but not amazing. Always feel like I'm eating food I could easily prepare. The food is always good, portions are average/small not large by any means. Price is reasonable for the area. I like this place when im looking for simple healthy. Wait time here can be excessive, they need to improve this. 25 minute wait for breakfast burrito and availability bowl is ridiculous."}
{"text":"This place opened today and is just located next to Whole Foods and roadrunner sports. Two of my favorite places. Now there is a third favorite place. Coming here for lunch, it was surprisingly busy for the first day and we were immediately greeted with some smoothie samples. PB&J. Great taste! Also all the other samples we received during our stay were super delicious. PB Dream, Skinny Bitch, Hulk and some more. I would have ordered all of them if I hadn't gone for the Plant Powered Bowl already. This very filling, veggie loaded bowl had a nice kick and the veggies were all still a little crunchy. Just as I like it. Also the bowl was surprisingly filling. The stuff came multiple times to check on us if the food was alright. Many vegan/vegetarian options, even gluten free. Great place for spending my lunch break. I would also come back to try their breakfast options and have more of their smoothies."}
{"text":"Do usual take outs. Love the food, it's healthy and rich on flavor. I like how the price is not too high and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Customer service is poor. When I was wanting to order, I was not greeted, was told to wait with no eye contact, border line rude. On the upside, they do have good food overall with a few really out there options. It is definitely overpriced for a self serve in-out cafe. I would come here more often if customer service was better and price was more reasonable."}
{"text":"Love this place!! Everything at Protein House is awesome! I was super impressed with the food, the portion sizes, the snickers coffee, the atmosphere, and the friendly staff! I will definitely be making this a regular spot!"}
{"text":"One of the best concepts I've experienced in a long time! Fantastic menu - my Hulk shake was great! Friendly staff and fun environment. One customer said he literally eats there daily and I can see why with the variety and quality of clean food they offer. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"After a tiring gym session with my friend, we decided to stop by here for lunch because I was getting hangry.   When you place your order, you get one of those devices that lights up and vibrates when your order is ready. It didn't take very long - 10 to 15 minutes.   I went with the Shrrd salad and it had spring mix greens, spinach, hard boiled egg, chicken breast, peas, tomatoes and avocado. The dressing was a balsamic vinaigrette. Simple salad that was filling. Nothing really stood out though. I guess I should've gone with something more interesting.   The water dispenser was not the cleanest. I think it really needs some maintenance. I questioned the water but drank it anyway because I felt like I was dying of thirst after working out and a night of drinking.   My friend got a protein shake but I wasn't really a fan of it because I'm not much of a peanut butter person unless it's on bread or bananas.   I'd come back and give this place another try. Maybe go with a protein shake or a burger. I eyeball-ed some burgers that other people ordered and they looked really good."}
{"text":"Definitely appreciate the concept, but I'm afraid that's all it is. On the surface it appears as if it would actually live up to their \"Eat clean\" motto by serving wholesome, healthy foods (aside from the vast array of Torani syrups featured behind the counter). Fast forward to the broken up **Nature Valley** bars they were calling granola which was heavily mixed in to my acai bowl & suddenly I realize this place is all for show.  I wonder what could possibly be clean about a Nature Valley bar and why they couldn't manage to put actual granola on my $10 acai bowl. I really expected more from this place, but was sorely disappointed. Save your $$, & head next door to Whole Foods instead!!"}
{"text":"I have followed protein house on social media for years and even followed the building of the first one in AZ and was so excited ! We drove all the way from Mesa to try it out and while the inside was cool I was so deeply sad about the food and price for it ! I got the Mahi sandwich and my hubby got a burger and both were so dry so flavorless and burnt . I thought maybe it was a one off but our friends went and said the same exact thing . I was so hella sad I was looking forward to it for months."}
{"text":"Enjoyed an omelette and the chocolate monster pancakes for a late breakfast today. We enjoyed both. Service was friendly and we got our food in a reasonable amount of time. We liked the variety in the menu. Looking forward to going back to try a few other things."}
{"text":"I SO wanted to love this place!  As a vegan, Scottsdale is a hard place to find good, healthy food.  We ordered the vegan burger and power bowl.  Both could have been great with some kind of sauce or dressing, but instead they were bland and tasteless.  I really hope ProteinHouse makes some changes and adds some flavor to their vegan offerings.  If they do, we will definitely be back!  The service was friendly, although confused - they came back to our new able twice to ask what we had ordered.  Hopefully they will get it together - we'd love this to be our favorite vegan spot in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"The food was decent, did not sit in my stomach like a brick, and the employee that helped me and my boyfriend was friendly. However, being a restaurant, this place really needs to remember that it is not a gym, and having randomly placed free weights and yoga mats doesn't make it such. The food was a bit pricey for the portion sizes. This is not a bad place, however I suggest they focus more on providing quality meals instead of trying to look like a gym."}
{"text":"Really liked the protein house. Got a bogo coupon at LA Fitness so thought I'd give it a try. From the name of the restaurant, I honestly thought the food would be geared toward meat heads and the quality of food would not be very good. The menu was diverse and the quality of food was surprisingly great. I had buffalo hash and protein pancakes. It was reasonable priced and tasty. I will definitely return."}
{"text":"Boss bowl is delish!!  Got mine with steak instead of bison.  The staff is super friendly and make really good recommendations for options."}
{"text":"I ordered a couple items from here via Postmates, the  BBQ Turkey Burger and the Ninja Burger in a collard green wrap, each with the sweet potato sticks. The Ninja Burger was what I ate, and was very disappointed due to the lack of flavor (other than the dollop of sriracha on top). The ahi itself was quite fishy tasting, which would indicate a lack of freshness, and I ended up throwing most of it away. The pineapple was hard as a rock, flavorless, and had the core still attached to it. My biggest issue was that I had ordered it with the collard green wrap, and received it between 2 pieces of romaine lettuce. There is a very big difference between the two in flavor. The sweet potato sticks were just diced up sweet potatoes that were undercooked and crunchy. So, if you're into bland, improperly cooked food... this would be the place for you, otherwise I would steer clear."}
{"text":"On a suggestion we went to have dinner after a workout. Initially I thought it was a little over priced for the size of the serving.   I rethought that after the meal.   I had the general bowl     The bison medium cooked. (I know it is not a foodie thing to do medium or well done.  I grew up on a farm ). The vegetables were fresh and the bison was not dried out at all. I could only eat half the bowl. I had the rest today for lunch and it tasted as good as last night. Essentially I had two meals from that bowl.   The other bowl was the  southwest.  This was not as good. The char grill overwhelmed the meat taste. This was also a filling meal. On the second meal with this at home BBQ sauce was added. Which I was told made it taste better."}
{"text":"Got the Cajun BBQ bowl...I would definitely get it again.  Overall, it's a solid place.  If you've seen Zoolander 1, it reminded me of the restaurant version of Globo Gym.  Very open, very modern, very white and shiny, very clean...and the crowd was very, well, very much like the crowd you'd expect to see in North Scottsdale at a place with Protein in it's name.  The Scottsdale \"bro's\" and over the top fitness snobs definitely run deep in this place, but it's expected so I wasn't bothered by it.  It was actually quite entertaining for people watching.  I also like the open kitchen concept, where you can see them make everything.  It is a tad on the pricey side, but the quality of the food seemed good and I am sure the rent in that location isn't cheap.  All in all, I think it's a good place for a healthy $12-$20 lunch.  I'll certainly be back."}
{"text":"Great concept! Love the idea of this place having an option for meal preps. I ordered the Skinny Bitch bowl lol (love the names of the plates too), which was a great portion of greens, quinoa, salmon and peppers. The taste was a little too bland, maybe from the quinoa because it was watery at the bottom. I know it's healthy and maybe this place is watching how much seasoning they use but a little won't hurt. I just added some Sriracha and the lime it came with and that did magic.   Overall, I'm really excited to see a great concept open. Just hope the other plates would be tastier.  I had no sauce or seasoning on this plate but willing to come back to try a few more plates before I decided if it's a go to or not. Give this place a try :)"}
{"text":"Wanted to love this place being its within walking distance but.....  It has such a cold atmosphere. And I don't mean I need a jacket cold, I mean it is VERY unwelcoming! You can tell they are all about working out but have no clue how to be in customer service or run a restaurant. I ordered a protein bowl and my meat should have been medium rare, came out well done. Overall I was more appalled with the vibe in the place more than the bland food. After standing at the counter with three people behind it, not one said hello, or be with you in a minute, BUT when the phone rang they picked up that call and put their order in right in front of me. Should have walked out right then and there. Normally in that situation you put the call on hold being I had been standing there! Needless to say I won't be back. Prices are ridiculously over priced for what you get as well. I don't see this place lasting."}
{"text":"Love how they decorated the place. Cool place to eat. Fresh food, they offer many varieties. Good for vegans as well. The food is very tasty. Very friendly staff. I will definitely be coming back. I want to try the pancakes next time. They looks so yummy."}
{"text":"I'll start with... great concept and food. But every time my order has been incorrect, eat here several times per week."}
{"text":"Finally made it in and my boyfriend and I loved it! I ordered the Thai monster bowl and he order the ph burger. I was afraid the Thai sauce would be over powering but it wasn't, I added siracha and it was perfect! The burger looked amazing when it came out and he said it tasted great! He didn't expect the egg white to be as good as it was.   The staff was very friendly! The manager/owner was extremely nice and he made sure we had a great first experience (we didn't catch his name ) but thank you!  Loved the white and black theme and the yummy healthy food! The portions are a good size and very filling. I'm excited to go back and try their breakfast and shakes!"}
{"text":"Protein House sounds healthy right?  Not so much.  Look at the nutritional value.  Cost!  12.00 for a southwest turkey wrap.  Yes it's nice to eat out but I could make that meal at home for 4 people for that cost. It was nothing special and too many onions.  PB cookie gross.  The restaurant was clean I will give them that."}
{"text":"I LOVE PH!! This is clean eating people, if you want cheap, unhealthy, but super flavorful food (which I don't personally believe theirs lacks), go to McDonalds!  Their bowls are delicious, my personal favorite is the Southwest Bowl. If you're looking for a less expensive option, then definitely create your own, they're very reasonably priced.  Love the burgers, smoothies, wraps, and coffee. I tend to just stick w what I like but the menu is huge so explore it! I also see many complaints about how long the food takes to come out. It takes time to cook meat. Salmon takes 6 minutes on each side=12 minutes, bison takes about 8 minutes, chicken takes 6 minutes each side=12 minutes. Not to mention putting your plate or bowl together and coordinating it with your coffee or smoothie if you ordered one. This isn't fast food. Expect it to take about 15 for your buzzer to go off. And have a little more patience if they're slammed, which, much of the time, they are! And for good reason. The restaurant is gorgeous, has an awesome vibe, and the staff is friendly and very helpful.  The manager, Matt, is saf...just saying. lol he's enough of a reason for me to drop in. ;)"}
{"text":"We ordered the snickers iced coffee drink that we saw on Yelp... we were very excited hoping to see a product that looked exactly like the pictures here on yelp.  That was not the case.  It looked like chocolate milk that was not very well stirred. I feel if they are going to advertise their products in a certain manner with photos that is exactly what we should get as consumers.  Considering it was nearly a six dollar drink I feel robbed and I would definitely not go back."}
{"text":"This place rocks! So many great choices to accommodate anyone's dietary preferences. My salad was fresh and delicious, best strawberries I have had in a long time and ingredients well proportioned. Had a peanut butter protein cookie for dessert and it was amazing. Very clean, friendly and helpful staff. Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Love the breakfast sandwich it was moist not dry! My next favorite is the Portobello sandwich it was so juicy you need a bib! Great place!"}
{"text":"Waited at register for 9 minutes before anyone even said hello. Put my order in, 23 minutes later I'm still sitting on a chair waiting for my smoothie. That's all I ordered, a smoothie.   Good food but the service isn't the best. Seems to be understaffed. Peanut butter cookies the qty(2) for 4 bucks?????????? They are the size on a silver dollar."}
{"text":"Shake was good but the menu is WAY overpriced for what you get. I doubt I'll return....was on my way to Scottsdale and looked up protein shake locations and found this one. The shake was tasty, but I wouldn't buy anything other than that due to prices."}
{"text":"MY ORDER IS ALWAYS WRONG!!! Love the food, prices are a bit higher than they should be, but I have no issue paying more for quality food... However, my order is never right. It's really frustrating and makes me not want to go back. For example, tonight my side was missing so I went and asked for it. After a couple deer in the headlights looks from staff somebody grabbed it and handed it to me without a word. For the first time it was awful, overcooked and tasted like cleaning supplies. Pushed it away. Then, I go to eat my bowl and notice the dressing I paid for isn't there. I go asked for it, am questioned about it, then it's handed to me. So then I go back to eat thinking I'm finally good to go. I dig in and guess what? IT'S THE WRONG BOWL! Not to mention I'm a vegetarian and found meet in it even though it was otherwise meant it was a vegetarian bowl  At this point I just ate and left. The last visit, I placed an online to go order for two bowls. I should have checked it before I left. Both dressings were missing and then between the two bowls we were missing 6 items that we paid to add on!!! The add ons and sauce aren't cheap and added up to a pretty penny and left me feeling ripped off. This is usually my go-to location after sessions with my trainer. I think it might be time for a new place. After a hard workout I just want to eat and chill. Not deal with this."}
{"text":"Very excited about ProteinHouse!! My hubby has gone Vegan and it's been difficult to find places that #1 offer options without cheese & dairy and #2 have options that are for Me. I've grown so tired of the limited options...so when I stumbled on a menu at my workplace I was intrigued. Today we made the trip in and were delighted to find So Many Options for us Both!! He had the Plant Power Bowl which was so Amazing I was envious that I hadn't ordered it too!! I had the Mediterranean Wrap that was very good as well! I love all the sauces they have Available that are Vegan as well! The staff was Super Friendly offering advice on the menu options! All and all a Fantastic dining experience and we will definitely be back! Thank you ProteinHouse for making it so Flavorful to Eat Well!! You Rock!!"}
{"text":"Vegan salad is excellent. Açaí bowls are good. I'd recommend the nutty açaí bowl. The PB&J pancakes are surprisingly good (we got without the \"sugar-free jam\")."}
{"text":"Each of my 3 visits were progressively better experiences. Customer service was very good and the food was healthy, delicious, and convenient for pick up."}
{"text":"Love this place I try to go at least once a week! I've had everything from the pancakes (pb&j pancakes are a must), breakfast bowl, burgers, Thai wrap, you name it I've had it and it's never a bad meal. Its also the only place I trust to eat when I'm in competition prep. The entire staff, including the owner Matt, is always kind and attentive to customers and maintains cleanliness throughout the restaurant every visit!"}
{"text":"Service was great, food was amazing, and atmosphere was on point.   I had the Muscle Boy for breakfast after a nice, long bike ride. Hit the spot. So much meat! You definitely won't go hungry after eating this thing."}
{"text":"Okay, I get it.  You wanted to create a concept catering to those of us seeking a healthy choice for dining out; those who are physically conscious, particularly of their diet. I get that.  However, of the items I've tried so far - particularly the cookies and the pancakes - I've felt I've needed a glass of water for dunking my dried out pastries. After an intensely intense workout, the body is craving fluids. Your pastries absorb saliva due to their dryness, and leave your patrons with less bodily fluid than when they entered. Who is your head pastry chef and why does he/she hate us? As an older fella - a ripe 45 y/o -  I've coached younger athletes to maintain a healthy dietary lifestyle but to also live a little. In these final decades of my life, I'd like to enjoy the occasional sweet treats that don't feel like punishments or poor decisions. Workouts should be hard, pastries shouldn't. Yours is a nice concept, but tone it down a little. I eat for health, but I also eat for the enjoyment of food. It's okay to add moisture to your meals without sacrificing the health benefits you promote. I'm sure you'll figure it out.  So far - disappointed, but I do have hope for you and wish you success. \"Just add water.\""}
{"text":"Great place to get good, healthy food with no fluff.  Ive tried their juices, which is hard to get wrong, so were yummy and Ive had their Chicken Caeser salad which was great. My husband always gets the PH Burger or the Salmon wrap. He thoroughly enjoys both."}
{"text":"Good spot for healthy food and easy seating.  Little pricy."}
{"text":"So excited to finally have a place to go where you can eat healthy and still get amazing flavor! Another  huge plus are the portion sizes! They don't skimp on the meat like most places do. Great atmosphere....great service...great food!"}
{"text":"Restaurant is clean, staff is friendly but not overly to where it is annoying.  Key point id like to make here is that the food is perfect for those that truly want to eat healthier and still want their food to taste good.   I ordered the veggie omelet and a side of the berry protein pancakes. The omelet was a perfect portion and was delicious and flavorful. It had the perfect amount of veggies and a great variety of them. I could've stopped there, but had to try the pancakes. The pancakes were so good I finished them off! Thank goodness I worked out this morning ;)  I also ordered the berry protein salad to go for lunch. Haven't eaten it yet, but the chicken looks fresh, there's just enough cheese crumbles, and a balanced amount of fruit.   I spent about $30 total and included an iced tea. I always figure about $10 per meal for good food and this met my expectations.   For those who think the food is pricey, I say you get what you pay for.   I'm definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"I think this is my last time coming here. There is hardly anyone in the restaurant and yet they take FOREVER to make your order. It's absolutely ridiculous to wait 10 or more minutes for food that is supposed to be easy to prepare. It's not rocket science."}
{"text":"The monster protein pancakes is a great way to start your day.  Love this place. Keeps me healthy with all natural ingredients."}
{"text":"Ok this place is awesome the breakfast food is perfect for my husband and me , has great selection a little pricey but for good healthy food it's going to cost you.  But this is the problem and I talked to a lot of my friends about and they have the same problem !!!     What are guys thinking  OPEN UP AT 7:00 am   I would've ordered breakfast 3 times this week but 9:00 I'm already thinking about lunch.  Come guys staff would be minor give it a try especially life time-fitness people working out before work.      Just saying.   But your food is awesome !"}
{"text":"Love this place! Pricy, but awesome options when you are trying to eat healthy but have something aside from a salad with chicken. Go for breakfast and get the protein pancakes!"}
{"text":"Even  before I gave a try to this place, I knew it was gonna be bad but still, I just can't figure out why the owner want to serve food to people, everything was flavorless. Protein shakes and salads might sound boring but it's safe. Healthiness and deliciousness are hard to co-exist(they can be for sure).If you don't have good recipes and cooks, don't serve food."}
{"text":"Menu was a little confusing to me, but overall this place is a great option when trying to eat healthy. I would go back."}
{"text":"I have to say if this place wasn't so far away from my Surprise home I would go there more often than any other place. But unfortunately my 45 minute drive to Scottsdale from Surprise makes it impossible for me to go more than once or twice a month. But the healthy food is definitely worth the drive!!"}
{"text":"ProteinHouse - Phoenix rocks!  This is one of my absolute favorite places to go eat out.  It is healthy and we all know that sometimes eating healthy comes with the trade of healthy for tasting good.  This is not the case with Protein House! They have a delicious menu of healthy and clean eats. The setup inside is laid out nicely and it has a great feel.   I like that they make clean and healthy food taste delicious.  The atmosphere inside is fun and a little swanky.    I would love to have a loyalty rewards card so when I buy a bunch of protein smoothies or meals I can get rewarded in the future.  They offer online ordering, although it's a pretty clunky process.  it is super convenient for members of Lifetime fitness in N. Scottsdale and for people wanting to go hit Whole Foods without being on an empty stomach!    There is plenty of parking in the shopping center."}
{"text":"Not sure where to begin. The menu online says the vegan wrap is Beyond Meat. Well, no it's not! I asked the lady who took my order what type of patty it was wanting to confirm it wasn't soy based. The response? \"It's vegan and a patty.\" Not helpful. When I pressed the issue she asked the cooks who also had no idea. So, she brought me the box and said the ingredient list was so long she couldn't memorize it. Well, it was. It was a low quality product for which they charge way too much. Plus, they cook the vegan products right next to the chicken and beef and use the same spatula! Not vegan friendly! I also asked what type of vegan protein powder they used and again, she had no idea. Seriously?! People with allergies, sensitivities or special diets can't take a risk and eat at places where they don't even know what they are serving!"}
{"text":"This is the best place for clean eating with a great menu and environment. The food is excellent and the service perfect. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"PH is awesome!! Kudos to the architect who designed this place. I've been there several times now and everything is good. My favorite is the Bison burger and \"Skinny bitch\" shake Food is great staff is friendly and very good vibes. I really like going after I've worked out, smoked a bowl in the parking lot, and hit up on some of the hot staff that works there This place is located in Phoenix but it's really Scottsdale. Located right next to Lifetime and Whole foods it's right in my bubble. But really I would drive far just to eat here anytime \"new favorite place to eat\""}
{"text":"Eh not really a great spot. The food was small and tasted bleh. Too much protein powder and metal in this building."}
{"text":"Nice choices of healthy food.  My husband got the Boss Bowl which he thought was delicious.  Try the protein peanut butter balls.  No sugar added and were so good.  The place is not much in terms of design but the food is worth going back for."}
{"text":"I arrived hungry for dinner. That was the first mistake. After ordering the teriyaki bowl from the huge menu on the screens hanging from the ceiling, I took a buzzer and waited. And waited. And waited. 30 minutes later, I was ready to eat my own hand when the buzzer went off. I went to the register and there was my bowl. There were two problems with that bowl.   First, it was salmon. I didn't want salmon, I expected beef or chicken. Turns out that the smaller menu on the counter says in small print, 'salmon', and that I had to specifically order it with chicken or beef. Takeaway lesson for you all -- don't look at the massive menu on the screens; they mislead you. Look at the smaller menus in finer print on the counter by the register.   Second, the portion size was so small it would be considered perfect for a light lunch, but for dinner it was too small. I'm not a big eater, but I ate that bowl and was still hungry.   Not wanting to wait another 30 minutes, I went to Whole Foods and got some extra food.  I may be back to try it at lunchtime, but if I have to wait 30 minutes like I did for dinner, I will not be going back.  On a positive note, I thought the food was prepared excellently, and was very flavorful."}
{"text":"I'm in love with this place! Deliciousssss vegan options! Healthy, loaded with protein, and they have the macros calculated out for you. It's our current obsession and go-to."}
{"text":"Protein House has always exceeded our expectations. We order there almost every week for a few days worth of food. The staff are very friendly and helpful and the food is amazing!"}
{"text":"You can seriously taste the protein in this food, actually that's the only thing you can taste - macronutrients. And what better way to have protein served to you than topping it off with an \"overbearing mother\" like peanut sauce that leaves unpleasant but barely  tolerable after taste in your mouth. This is truly the dining hall for cave men who may lack or chose to ignore flavor and taste. And for the price you will be paying, you may not be able to afford college for your children after dining here. But hey don't take my word for it, you're going to ignore my SOS and eat it anyways. P.s- hot sauce helped the food go down much easier."}
{"text":"First time here for breakfast. Vegan pancakes / fruit and their chocolate muffin. Pancakes were really good and the vibe is awesome here. A bit pricey but it's worth it. Great staff too.   You don't need to be an exercise freak to come here - just enjoy some good food and if needed the staff is happy to help and recommend options."}
{"text":"My views on protein house are mixed... Was it healthy yes, the flavors weren't bad ( but they weren't great either). But man for the prices they charge I would expect my salmon to not be so totally over cooked that it resembled an over cooked chicken breast... I mean two totally mediocre bowls for 25.00 just doesn't sit well with me. I would skip this place at all costs unless your a fan of over spending for \"healthy\" food. Your better off shockingly heading over the Whole Foods and hitting up their salad bar, or any of their fresh hot food offerings (and I mean that's saying something).  Just not a fan... Not a fan at all"}
{"text":"Good bowl. The improvement I suggest is that the sweet potato mash in the bowl be served hot, not cold. I will give it another try."}
{"text":"Service was fast but the chicken was very dried out so dry you can't even swallow it and had no flavor. rice was over cooked and no flavor the girl at the front counter was friendly but not very patient being that it was my first time. She also never offered me a drink so I left with no drink. Overall I spent $20 for some okay cooked asparagus."}
{"text":"Love this place! The sexy bitch bowl is so delicious. I sub the quinoa for sweet potato mash. Also love the Hulk smoothie. So much here to enjoy. Customer service is great as well. Ordering meals from here to take for lunches during the week. Can order same day or day before pick up. So excited to pick those up tomorrow."}
{"text":"I usually go to whole foods for grilled salmon and make a salad. I saw this place and had to try it. The menu has a lot of choices for meat and vegan and can easily customize. I got the sexy bitch bowl and it was great!! Salmon with veggies that are diced over quinoa.  The portion size was right for the price. Filling and a nice size of salmon. My guess is close to 3 or 4 oz.  yummy!"}
{"text":"Love this place...macros, gf, vegan !!! Great service & great food ... everything is really good here great idea!"}
{"text":"I have been here twice and this place still woo's me! The food is by far the best and the cleanest I've ever had! And the staff is amazing and all their hard work! I am a good friend of Tim and he is one heck of a guy! Good job buddy!"}
{"text":"So so overrated.   A PC restaurant that is on the bison bandwagon.   Any restaurant that serves bison INSTEAD of beef for their burgers is an instant zero stars for me."}
{"text":"Made my fitness goals easier than I thought it could ever be! Their meal prep keeps me in my macros and is so good! I can't even remember the last time I cooked."}
{"text":"First time here I had the bison wrap. I already know this is going to be my new favorite spot, I just wish they had a location closer to my home in central Phoenix. There are not enough healthy lunch places !! I love that they do meal prep for you (seriously? This is way cool), and that they have bison on their menu (because where else can you get that?). The wrap was delicious and so was the cookies and cream hot coffee I got. Will be back to try more !"}
{"text":"Had a 10am breakfast, post workout, at the new location for Protein House. Love the clean atmosphere and appreciate the fit staff. You order at a counter and use a hand buzzer to let you know when your food is ready. I ordered the breakfast sandwich which is ham, egg whites and cheddar on an Ezekiel English muffin. It's pretty delicious and filling. Also served with a side of fruit for $7.99. Coffee is $2.50 for a 16 oz. Think most of the entrees are a little overpriced, but they deliver on appropriate portions and clean food. They serve breakfast all day. Pancakes looked delicious! Definitely will be back to try them and some of the lunch options. Pretty extensive menu with smoothie and juice options as well."}
{"text":"Good, clean food and military friendly.  A little pricey but you get what you pay for ."}
{"text":"Tried the veggie burger & vegan pancakes. Unfortunately both lacked in flavor for the price. The burger was very small the sweet potatoes soggy & the vegan pancakes looked pale & tasted bland with a tiny amount of fruit. Sorry but for almost $30 I wasn't satisfied. Disappointed because everything looked so much better on their website."}
{"text":"This review is for the food. The smoothies were pretty good and the food was clean, and healthy.  However, you should be warned: no one will be wearing anything other than workout clothing...even other customers... It's as though a memo went out that I clearly missed. I walked in and instantly felt like the laziest sloth on the planet...Which I'm not, I'm a health conscious vegan who received a notification in the mail talking about how there's vegan options--there's really just weight lifter options.  The food is good..and you'll immediately feel like you should go workout incessantly thereafter. If that's what you're looking for, you're in luck"}
{"text":"The menu is very fresh and there are lots of options! Unfortunately the veggie bowl lacked spices and tasted a bit bland. Maybe the absence of salt made it more healthy. Good, nothing more, nothing less."}
{"text":"I love the idea of this and think that it's awesome planning that they have it right near lifetime fitness haha. I was surprised by all of the options available, something for everyone! Burgers, wraps, bowls, smoothies, and vegan stuff.  It was nice and clean in here, spacious and cute. A little bit pricey but good quality stuff. I ordered off the plant-based protein portion of the menu. I got a whole wheat wrap with tofu, squash, spinach, tomatoes, and peanut sauce. It also came with fruit. The wrap was delicious, just enough to fill me up, and I really liked the peanut sauce. I bet the veggie burger is good too! We also saw people with pancakes that looked excellent. Food was ready quick and the people working there were great. Protein house, I will be back!"}
{"text":"Great concept! However, their acai bowls seriously lacked substance. Now, I know my acai bowls ok- I make them at home and order them anywhere they're offered. I ordered the Superfood bowl: unsweetened acai, coconut water,  avacado, goji berries, chia seeds, bee pollen, cacaco power, almond butter, Greek yogurt, and chocolate whey- topped with blueberries, flax seeds, and granola.   Ok- where the hell were the chia seeds? I asked the manager and she said well, chia seeds are tiny. I know what chia seeds are and they expand when they come in contact with moisture. There were NO chia seeds in my bowl. Maybe they powder them before blending the acai? I don't know. The goji berries are also in power form- weird. My bowl was also topped with maybe 6 blueberries... for $13 this \"acai bowl\" sucked big time.   MAYBE this is how PH likes their acai bowls but in general- don't expect the traditional bowl. Next time I'll try the tropical one."}
{"text":"Terrific place if you're into fitness and well balanced meals that taste amazing. I only wish I knew about this place earlier"}
{"text":"I had the Protein House Pancakes. They were good and full of protein. They tasted pretty close to regular pancakes. My friend had an egg sandwich & she said it was good. The food takes a while so don't expect to be in and out of there if you are in a hurry. They offer the macros online for the menu. This is a great place if you are trying to get more protein in your diet."}
{"text":"EXTREMELY slow!!! We ordered a salad and one of the bowls. It almost 30 minutes before the food was ready and the place was not busy at all. The salad wasn't fresh, it had lots of brown parts in the lettuce. The bowl was mediocre at best. This place is over priced lacks flavor.   Good concept but save yourself the time and money, go to Whole Foods next door."}
{"text":"PH does a great job with really fresh food that tastes great. Add in a very helpful and friendly staff and you've got a great option for breakfast or lunch! My favorites are the Muscle Boy Bowl and the PH Burger."}
{"text":"Try the mocha loca it's delicious it's my 3 days a week breakfast shake. If you haven't been there try it. Staff is friendly food is also delicious and not your typical \"health food\" IT HAS FLAVOR!"}
{"text":"Chicken tasted like charcoal and steak was overdone.   I asked for medium and got well done.  However the rice and vegetables were good.  The food items cost too much and aren't that good.  Will probably not return.  The cashier talked in a soft voice then got annoyed when you asked her to repeat herself.  The cook in the back was messing around on his cellphone while cooking.   I had high hopes for this place."}
{"text":"Not the place to come if you want a quick salad/bowl. Waited 45 minutes (I know!) too long for mediocrity. 1 star for sub-par service and ok food. Come on people- fast casual is not rocket science! Keep your expertise to the gym because you have a lot to get right in the area of food/service. Seemed like complete chaos behind the counter. When I had to remind the frazzled gal at the checkout of my order. Twice.   This place isn't for a developed palate. Despite what it looked like, the turkey burger (part of a bowl) was actually tasty and moist considering it was chopped into too many pieces. The sweet potato needed some char for texture for added taste (much too mooshy). Although the flavor was OK, the green smoothie wasn't cold enough. The display of protein powder they use in their shakes also didn't appeal to me. Too many chemicals and over processing turns me off. Healthier options overall, yes. Worth the wait/price, no."}
{"text":"First time impression: Pretty good menu with a lot of great options. The people are friendly and the food portion huge. The bonus, weekend special, buy an entree and get a free short stack of pancakes . The place is pretty clean and they have outside seating. Overall enjoying my first meal at ProteinHouse."}
{"text":"Smoothie Tasted like it was blended w Room Temp dishwater.   I came here with my boy from here and my girl... never went to the PH in Vegas with all the times I've been there... so I figured I'd try here.   Super friendly staff... very clean and hip environment. KAI Greene training video playing as we waited.  I wasn't too hungry so I had a Tropical Tease smoothie with 2 extra scoops of protein.   I wasn't even going to write anything bad here - because I thought that's just how they make smoothies... but after I tasted my girls Hulk Man smoothie - I had to write a review.   Tropical Tease sucked. Tasted good... but tasted like it was blended with room temperature dish water. My girls, on the other hand..  was super chill, ice chunks, and amazing taste. If I had THAT smoothie... I'd have given this place a 5-star... buuuuut I had the one I did, and it was worse than a Jamba Juice.   Will I be back? Pooooosssibly. But for my girls smoothie actually being good, I'd never step foot in here again.  It does have a nice vibe and the whole workout/fitness vibe. Which is cool... but with the iconic name of protein house... ya gotta have a good protein smoothie!!! Com'On man!"}
{"text":"Completely blown away by the quality of the food. Tried the Thai Monster bowl and it was simply out of this world. The chicken, bistro filet, vegetables, rice and sauce could not have tasted fresher. We found the prices to be very reasonable. The kitchen manager DANIEL stopped by our table which was a very nice touch.  Will definitely return!  And today as in the day after my first meal there...I returned to try the Protein House breakfast burrito (they serve breakfast all day), and it was absolutely fantastic. Super great to have a place like that like Protein House close to the gym with such high quality food.  I'm very excited about Protein House being here as it could be the place as the solution to help me achieve my fitness goals to become leaner and fitter. I also met Tim whom I believe is the owner of this location and he super nice and welcoming and thanked me for coming in."}
{"text":"South beach pancakes are dry and flavorless. My order came out and nobody brought it to me or rang my pager so I would know. My yoghurt bowl was ok, but why are they serving sweetened yoghurt at this place anyway?  Disappointing."}
{"text":"Food is delicious! I've been here 5 times and always satisfied. I order ahead of time because it takes a little longer than most places to receive food.  That is only because food is made fresh and by order."}
{"text":"I have been waiting for something like this to come along for a while now. Fast friendly healthy options... What a great concept!!! This will be my new go to place after I'm done at the gym. They have quite a few menu options as well as meal planning kits. Lots of TV's you can watch while you wait for your food or while you're dining in. Very clean and modern. Try the Teriyaki bowl with salmon and quinoa... Yum Good!! The only thing missing is a drive through :)"}
{"text":"I have tried the vegan versions of both the Berry Blast (an Acai smoothie) and Skinny Bitch smoothies. I did not like either; both were too grainy and earthy/gritty. . I asked them to remove the whey but I am assuming they added a vegan protein powder (which is an option), which I did NOT request. Vegan body builders and those who are used to, or like the vegan protein powders may enjoy it.  I have also tried the Vegan Blueberry pancakes. They are gluten free and come topped with fresh fruit (bananas, strawberries, and blueberries) and coconut flakes. They were good, but not amazing and not worth $11. If you eat in store, they have maple syrup and agave available in their condiment section. I ordered to go and they did not include any syrup or knives.  Also, they do not automatically give you a receipt, even when paying with a credit card. I had to request my receipt every time.   Also, I was not a fan of how when I first came in and inquired about making a smoothie vegan, the lady at the register responded with uncertainly; that was very unsettling to me. Luckily, the printed menu is very helpful in letting you know how to veganize items."}
{"text":"It's unfortunate this place seems to be run by a bunch of workout enthusiasts instead of professionals with restaurant experience. I've been here twice now and while the flavors of the food and smoothies we got were fine, the service was T.E.R.R.I.B.L.E.  The first time my husband and I ordered food with one smoothie. After a teensy bit too long of a wait, his food came out. Nothing for me. I insisted he start eating figuring my veggie burger would arrive in just a second. Halfway through his meal it still hadn't arrived so I went up to the counter to ask about it. They'd clearly dropped the ball by the look on the guy's face that I spoke with (several other customers' orders had been delivered while I'd waited at the table). He scooted back into the kitchen side and returned with the fib that \"It was just taking a little longer\" and would be ready in a minute. I call bullsh*t.  There wasn't any apology offered either and the general attitude of the folks that work there is certainly not one of service. They're sneery, unapologetic, and somewhat patronizing.  The last time I went in was at the end of the evening after a workout. There were two couples in the place, both eating already and lots of workers. Some were standing around stretching themselves (good lord), some were beginning to clean the VitaMixes in the back and there were a couple in the register area. I ordered a smoothie and was given one of those vibrating thingies (as if it was going to be a 15 minute wait??). What the heck. I sat down and waited. And observed. Still cleaning the VitaMix... I waited some more. Chatting at the counter and in the kitchen area. I continued to wait. Nothing - almost 10 minutes went by.   These guys were unbelievable. ZERO sense of urgency or timing. FINALLY I heard the VitaMix being used with actual produce in it. Why had they waited so long to even start?? I was headed up to the counter to register my displeasure when the chickie came out from the back with the smoothie in her hand. No clue how long she'd made her customer wait. No apology, just some vacuous look on her face as her mind was clearly elsewhere.  Thanks but no thanks. Get some real experience in there and some training on WHO your real customer is. Hint - it's not yourselves."}
{"text":"This location is better than the original in Las Vegas! I used to live in LV and go there all the time. So kudos to you!  This location in PHX is clean, bright and open concept! The food is delicious (as always) and the staff is friendly. Great for snacks, breakfast, lunch or dinner. My favorites are the bison burger or the Peanut Butter Dream smoothie with almond milk."}
{"text":"ProeteinHouse has tons of healthy, protein packed options but I thought the food was fairly bland and expensive for the taste and the simplicity of the meals. You could definitely make this stuff at home, but with more flavor, or pick up a similarly priced and tastier meal at Whole Foods next doors. The pickup process for an online order was slow - they need to have a separate pick up area. I don't think I'd be back but I could see it being a decent option for people that just don't cook, or who travel a lot and need something relatively healthy."}
{"text":"Great menu selection. Steak burrito is the best! Finally a fast-casual restaurant can walk away from feeling satisfied and healthy."}
{"text":"Food was very fresh and the service was awesome. It was my first time at Protein House, the cashier was very helpful with recommendation and walked me through how the selection works. Really legit place, especially if you try to eat right and want something tasty."}
{"text":"If zero star was available I would give no stars for this place. First time there and very disappointed. Place was not busy and staff very unfriendly. While drinking my smoothie I felt something different about the texture of the smoothie. There were pieces of plastic from the labels that were left on the fruits that they never removed. I returned to the store and spoke to the manager and he said oh I can make you another showing no concern like it is an everyday situation. No thank you."}
{"text":"Nice Clean Modern Restaurant stressing health and fitness  We ordered the Chocolate Monster Pancakes which I believe is an awesome combination of pancakes soaked in Chocolate with walnuts. Definitely not on the healthy side, but very good.  Also ordered the Breakfast Sandwich that had egg, ham and cheese on wheat bread. It was ok but almost looked lie an egg mcmuffin on Wheat bread.  The majority of the people eating there were wearing workout clothes and must have just come from the gym.  Nice new breakfast place addition to the area, not real visible from street but not difficult to find.   Good concept to build around fitness and health to a restaurant.   It seems that that pancakes are the prime item to order here and they come out very nice.  Will come back here again."}
