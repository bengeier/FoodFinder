{"text":"All You Can Eat and Lunch Special menus available. Prices on the website are for the Steeles location. The Don Mills location seemed a dollar or 2 more.   Chicken Teriyaki Don (not Bentoh) comes with miso soup and salad. Bentoh comes with gyoza too.  - Chicken was a bit burnt and dry - There was enough teriyaki sauce to cover the chicken and rice   Service was good. Very friendly staff that spoke English well. Decor is much more modern than the restaurant that was there before, Tako Sushi.   May return for AYCE menu."}
{"text":"Extremely horrendous customer service from Kevin, the acting manager. Rude, abrasive, and defensive. Argued with us about the ingredients in the food, claimed that then kitchen requires upwards of 25 mins for each item as it is prepared \"fresh\". Incorrect food delivered throughout the dinner. Don't plan on going back."}
{"text":"Rice of the maki was too soggy.  Decent kitchen dishes. Been to better places, tip automatically added although service was no where to be seen (in their defense it was quite busy... But still)  Probably won't return."}
{"text":"I just had to write this update:  We went here again, this time with a friend for a la carte sushi on a Saturday night. The host area was a zoo of people who had made reservations for the party rooms and still were waiting for their table. Asked the lady when it'll be and if we can order a la carte...her answer was \"yes, you'll be seated in two minutes. Everybody here is waiting for a party room\"...We proceeded to wait 40 minutes for a table and every time we asked her when it'll be (mind you she only came around to the front twice in that 40 minutes) she answered just two minutes... Had we known it would take 40 minutes we would have gone next door to eat. When we finally did sit down we were told it's AYCE only. A little disappointing but the food is still great, they need to work on their service!!!"}
{"text":"Food is ok but no service, wait a long time. 12% tips not worth."}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed.  I ordered take out from here one evening.  The woman on the phone said it would take 10 minutes so I was there in 10. Ended up waiting by the take out counter for 20 minutes until they finally brought my food. When I got home, I saw the 9 tiny pieces of sushi that tasted horrible.  Nothing like I had expected.  I will never order or eat from there again. A terrible experience overall."}
{"text":"We were a family of 4 for ayce on a Sat evening. Food was above average, price higher than average, decor pleasant, and staff friendly. Now for the negative remarks. Service was very slow. Noise level was excessive for the price and nice decor. The problem was made worse by uncontrolled small children who yelled loudly and jumped on the seats. We will definitely not go back."}
{"text":"Service was so slow food took about 20-30 minutes to be served. The food when it finally came was good we just got so tired of waiting, we weren't able to order much. The main server said that they were one waitress short so that's why it was slow and when we would try to get someone's attention no waitress would look to our direction. The bill came faster then the amount of time it took to have us seated."}
{"text":"2.5, rounding up to 3 because this used to be one of my fav AYCE and hope that this one not so great experience was a one time thing.  So first off, Matsuda used to rank in my top 5 AYCE Japanese restaurants. It was close to where I lived, food was slightly above average, and service was decent. Mind you, I usually go with my family of 4, so maybe service was slightly better than if it was a larger group. But I haven't been going for about a year now. Until my office decided to have our annual Xmas gathering at Matsuda.   I called about a month ahead to make reservations, since we were going to be 15+ people. Being around Xmas, I knew they would be even busier, and wanted to make sure we got a table at the specific date and time that we wanted. So I called around the beginning of dinner service to make a reservation for a Tues around Xmas. A guy answers the phone, takes down my information, and than tries to hurriedly hang up on me. But I had a few questions about pricing and wanted to double check he got my information right, so I made him stay on the line. He than sounded super annoyed, simply just answering \"yeah\" to my questions, and than at the end saying \"don't worry I've got you reservation, don't worry ok\" with a bit of an attitude and than hung up on me. So flash forward to the day of our reservation. We had a different number of people than we originally reserved for so we called to let them know the change, and they couldn't find our reservation. Well apparently, we were lucky since we were eating slightly earlier at 6:30pm, slightly before the dinner rush, so they said they would find a table for us and made us a new reservation. I wonder what would have happened if we never called to make a change to our non-existent reservation, we would have been stuck waiting hours for a 15+ table.  Anyways on to the food, based mostly on this experience only: ~Sashimi & sushi were a-okay, maki rolls were not as fresh. ~One of my fav items here that you probably can't find at every AYCE is the Fish Head Soup. Its a pretty big bowl with one half of a salmon fish head, tofu cubes, and lots of nappa cabbage.  ~Cooked foods were mostly average, nothing super good or super bad, that was particularly memorable.           ~Particular hits with my co-workers, but not necessary myself, were the Unagi Rice, Matsuda Golden Shrimp, and the Grilled Salmon Heads. Those kept getting reordered. ~Desserts were okay. There were a lot of Mousse options. Good for if you like tiny cups of different flavoured mousses.  Service was super slow. I can't believe in this day and age, we had to order by dictating our orders to our one designated waiter. Most other places have ipads, or at least an ordering sheet you can fill out yourself. This kind of ordering method becomes especially annoying when you have a large group. A lot of our food items were missing, or it did not come in the correct quantity. It was hard tracking down our waiter, and when we asked him to check on the missing items, they still didn't come.   Drinks were not included. Weeknight dinner was $24.99, which is pretty standard now. I don't think I'll be back anytime soon. But maybe someday I'll give them another shot for old times sake, but definitely not with a large group."}
{"text":"Matsuda has the worst service I have ever experienced! The hostess was inattentive and kept wandering off as the foyer filled up with people so when she returned, she was bombarded with people trying to get a seating number. The hostess gave us a number and didn't tell us how long the wait would be. Whenever someone approached her she looked as if they were burdening her with our presence. We waited for 30 minutes before we had to ask to be seated since we were next and there had been an empty table for 4 for over 10 minutes. A table for two was empty beside us for 20 minutes before a pair were seated.  The food was good but a lot of our order did not come. When we tried to get the attention of a server, they would look at us and walk away. Portions were extremely small. One roll was only 4 small pieces.   My overall experience was poor and I will never be going back."}
{"text":"This place used to be very good with putting our orders in, but now I can ask for the sashimi 3 times before it comes, I think they cheapout and dont give away the expensive stuff"}
{"text":"Food: Not too shabby, better than most sushi places but not the best. Would recommend the Mango Roll and Sunshine Roll  Service: God awful, asked for wasabi and pickled ginger many times and it came on the third time. We had spilt some tea on the table and we had to ask three waiters to get extra napkins. Some sushi dishes took forever to come and some came quickly."}
{"text":"No service at all... been waiting at the seating area for more than 10 mind and no server comes over to help; after a long wait, a server walked over and asked us how many pal for the party and then walked away without giving us a number or dropped down our names... The server went to the bar and stayed there for more than 5 mins. .. I walked up and ask how long we have to wait and my response was \"Just wait\".. without even looking at me... This is not the kind of attitude I expected.  For the same amount of fee, I will rather spend it elsewhere; there's tons of Japanese cuisine in the area."}
{"text":"Don't forget to bring lots of 'patience 'coz you'll need them after the 1st round of food so order as much as you can on round 1.  Be ready to forgive the servers 'coz they are always pissed and will most likely mess up some of your orders but hey .. Its AYCE.   Just sit back, relax and enjoy the food for 3 hours!  I suggest going with a group of 4, skip your two prior meals and allocate time for food coma after."}
{"text":"Just there for lunch, great service even there aren't too much choice for lunch AYCE. All foods came out within 15 mins when we ordered. Everything are nice and fresh, love their desserts.. Will come back for AYCE dinner someday!!!"}
{"text":"I went with a party of 5 and we all got the AYCE. I personally thought the price was a bit high ($34 after tax and service) for the food quality and service. Then again, this is AYCE sushi and the staff were busy with several sizable tables celebrating birthdays.  Overall Price: High Service: Slow Food: Mediocre, a bit under seasoned  Decor: Dark but classy  My observations and review:  Tea It's green tea with roasted rice. It was noticeably watered down but works to wash down the food. I would recommend getting this as you start to get cold inside the restaurant after some time.  Seaweed salad Texture, seasoning and presentation was nice. This was probably my favorite thing of the whole meal. I would recommend you try this appetizer.  Sashimi Sashimi sitting on a bed of ice. Salmon was on par with decent sushi places in Toronto. White tuna was decent too. No heavy fishy smell so their sashimi is reasonably fresh and/or well kept. I recommend this as a staple for your rounds.   There were these slices salted sashimi with yellow roe attached to it that stood out. It had a firm but nice texture. I recommend trying it. I recommend you try this.   Golden shrimp Sweet and sour shrimp. This was probably the best out of all the shrimps we had in terms of seasoning, taste and texture. Nothing mind blowing though. I still recommend getting this if you like shrimp.  Grilled shrimp? Slightly under seasoned grilled shrimp. Better off leaving this one out to save room for other orders.  Grilled calamari Burnt under seasoned calamari. I don't recommend getting this.  Sushi pizza I was curious to get this. I heard sushi pizzas are usually not worth it and it looks like disc of some sort. We got a macaron sized hash brown with a hard panko shell. It was an okay hash brown but I would not recommend it unless you like hash browns and expect to get a hash brown.  Golden scallops? I expected to get a scallop from the grilled section of the AYCE menu. Instead I got a puree of mash on a scallop shell. Tasting it, it was a combination of sweet potato and fine cottage cheese. There was actually a scallop but it was the size of two pinky tips/phalanges. The scallop tasted frozen and under seasoned. I don't recommend getting this this but get it if you want to see this deception.   Cream cheese wonton I forgot what it is called at this location but you can find this at other sushi places. The wonton wrapper was a bit hard. It was served with a thin syrup sitting on the bottom of the plate. Overall, it was decent but I wouldn't recommend it.  Some mango roll These rolls were served with a line of mango sauce squeezed from a squeeze bottle. Presentation wise it was okay. Taste wise it was a tad under seasoned but overall the flavor works. I recommend this as a staple in your rounds.   Some roll with bonito flakes? Bonito flakes gave it a fishier taste. Personally I think the other rolls are better.   Volcano roll This was served hot and deep fried with only fish stuffed inside the nori/sea weed paper. Overall it was okay and i would recommend this if you just want protein.  Unagi items All the unagi orders I ate had fattier cuts of unagi. They were all a bit fishier than the other orders and seasoned decently. The texture was soft but a bit too soft.  Unagi rice was mediocre. The rice was a bit on the harder side and the soy sauce drenched over the rice was only decent.   Unagi roll was decent. If you crave unagi, I recommend getting the roll over the rice.  Some grilled pacific fish This was a long fish that was grilled and served with a bowl of sweet soy sauce. Texture wise it was decent. It wasn't burnt but taste failed to press me on this one. It has a comparable taste to frozen sardines. If you want protein, get this.   Lychee mousse This has the texture of whip cream with a light hint of lychee flavour. Googling mousse, you would expect to find something airy where you can see the separations. This was very close to whip cream and didn't look like mousse.  Mango yogurt All there deserts seem to be served in a small cup which is great for trying various desserts.  This was a light pudding served with mango puree. The pudding had the same taste and texture of the extra soft sweet tofu pudding you find in the grocery store. Overall, it was a very light mango pudding. I recommend getting a few of these for a light snack at the end.  Beef ribs Decent. Get this as a staple for your rounds.   Enoki wrapped in beef Decent. Get this as a staple  Chicken/beef skewers Decent. Get this as a staple.  Service Slow to bring out your foods. Understandable given how busy they were."}
{"text":"Great food, great selections, ill just list the pros and cons to make it simple.  PROS: - Great tasting food - Great selections - Staffs are nice - Price is reasonable i guess  CONS: - Most of the time we never get our orders - We get food that we didn't order - Doesn't matter if you booked a reservation, you will still wait"}
{"text":"At Matsuda right now, will never recommend this place to anyone.  We only get 1/3 of what we ordered and we did not order lot at all.  The food though not bad but compared with the price we paid and the waiting time, I guess we can find many other better restaurants than this place with the same price.  Very poor service, the ordered items never arrived.  I personal feel it is a rip off restaurant as they use the waiting time to be an excuse to the customers for not getting food and we finally have to leave as our patience reached the limit."}
{"text":"*Cockroach alert!*   My friends and I were located on the NW wall at the booth, everything was fine until my friend pointed something on the wall. It was a cockroach! It just stayed there. We asked someone to remove it and it took 5 minutes for someone to kill it. They failed 3 times to remove the roach. I still don't think they removed it.  They moved our seats and give us new plates and all for that they only gave us free pop drinks. I demanded a free meal for that but they refused, even discounts weren't given.  So be warned, Toronto public health should take a look at this place. There was only 1 roach but that could lead to many more.   Ps: it doesn't really help that the restaurant is right beside the garbage room."}
{"text":"Love it, they have a big selection of food here. Their little specials they make are why I come back such as the mango rose. ! so delicious and sweet and their Mango Yoghurt!  Just make sure the # of what you order you double it because they never give the amount you order. It will always be less or sometimes the food doesn't even come. When this does happen just make sure your waitress/ waiter is aware and they usually will bring you it out immediately after you've noticed them. Make reservations if you plan on eating at dinner time, the wait is 20 minutes++++"}
{"text":"Tried this newish place. Nice decor. We ate at the Teppanyaki table. Food was plentiful!! It was AYCE but they did not skimp on anything. Sashimi, rolls, steak, etc. We were soooo full afterwards, food COMA. The dinner is a bit over $30, which is more than your usual uptown japanese AYCE but in the grand scheme of things this is still good value. Presentation of the food was nice. Quality is definitely better than a lot of other AYCE places. Pop not included. We had 2 rounds of Teppanyaki, the first round the portions were small but then the second round the portions were huge and we ended up not being able to finish. They didn't charge us for the leftovers which was a relief. They also have interesting starters which I have not seen at other AYCE places such as Salmon Natto and Wasabi Tako (usually see these only at Izakaya places). Will definitely come back! They even have shrimp sashimi on the weekends. And make sure to order their mango milk pudding- really refreshing to finish the meal!"}
{"text":"Horrible service, rolls are just rice! Ordered off the menu because all you can eat is not my thing.  My server greeted us 10 minutes after we showed up to the table.  I tried to ask my server questions, and she just walked away in the middle of my questions, TWICE.  I waited a few minutes and when it was obvious she forgot about us I got up with menu in hand to ask a question and she yelled at me to sit down or I won't get served. When she finally showed up and answered she appeared to be annoyed. When ordering she said \"that's enough and walked away\". It's my money, my choice, and while I would have appreciated her opinion, I didn't appreciate her walking away. I never got my Tempura and when I tried to ask the server and 2 others just waived me off. Really?  The bill came and they  charged me for the Tempura. Oh, and the \"specialty\" rolls were massive balls of just rice, inside and out, with a tiny sliver of fish and some cucumber. GHETTO. JUST DONT DO IT AND FIND ANOTHER PLACE."}
{"text":"The sushi's okay, but the service is HORRIBLE. No waiter is ever happy to serve you and surprisingly, the manager (a woman with short spiky black hair) had the worst attitude. When my friends asked for a status on our order, she snapped back at us saying \"I don't know!\" She even lectured us about ordering sushi because our second order was similar to our first. And at one point, she called one of us fat, snickered, and then ran off to the other side of the room.  I hated my experience so much, I made this account just so I could write this one review."}
{"text":"Such  bad service is very hard to find nowadays in toronto! Not in KiKu or Sushi on 7 or Suygon.  Today go there at 1:38 pm no greeter, 15 min guy wear suite pass by and said wait then go away. Not till 2 pm we were told seat will be really soon behind us there is people like us not being serve at all.  Start or first order at 215.  Wait long 20min finally food on table . Keep searching for server to make the second order.  All together we got 3 chances to make order and a girl come by !  !! we were eating!,!  and told us it is the last call. We make our final order and also remind her some food not coming yet.  OK she soon bring the food to us.  Not more  than ten minutes server bring in a bill and put on the table ,,,Thank you she said Tips included She added! When I ask her if  I can paid credit card Serer said go to the cashier to paid.  There was a long line.  When we go back to our seat, all our food on the table gone!  Including my desert.  All above are poor customer service and is totally unacceptable.  Their manager call Fanny, cant get hold with her.  Wow,  it is very reasonable to acknowledge food not finished most not even start to eat.  I would say they intentionally to do that.  Is there something wrong with the restaurant that they don't want customer any more or they treat the server badly to make them bad to customer in return."}
{"text":"First time to go there and it wasn't quite a nice experience. With food alone I guess ya, it's okay nothing really stands out, just okay for me and my family. What turned us off really was the service. We booked for 6pm and waited for like10 mins before sending us to our table. Then took our order like 20 mins after we sat down. Our first order came like 20 mins after they took it and they didn't send all our first batch of orders. We end up following up our orders, at first our server was very polite and felt sorry for the delay of our food. We let it pass, we understand that its very busy and the place is very jammed packed. Then another server came to our table asking if everything is okay, so we told this lady that we were waiting like now for another 20 mins and still the rest of the first order is nowhere in sight. That lady even said that she noticed that there's not much coming to our table. So she assured us that she'll follow up again. Let say another 10 mins passed and finally, the rest of the food came. Then we did our second order, we waited again for at least 10-15 mins to get the second order and again the rest of our orders didn't come. My hubby couldn't help it but asked sarcastically our first server that it really took a while, to send that 1 cup of rice? That's the time our server got annoyed too. We end up ordering dessert just to get our bill and leave right away. Of course, it took less than 3 mins when they handed us the bill. We understand that they're tired and all of us likewise we're hungry and pissed off too. So, from the moment that guy's mood changed and whenever he comes to our table, he doesn't smile or make eye contact anymore. We really did our best to talk to them politely as possible given the annoying and  slow service we got. Anyway, we think this will be our first and last visit there. Just try to change the system of how things work there to improve a much more faster service to your guests. ESPECIALLY on weekends where you have a lot of people coming in."}
{"text":"I'd like to give this a 0 rating but it doesn't seem to be an option. Came here for lunch with a friend on a weekday. The place wasn't packed at all but they seated us in a corner away from the general crowd. No one came to take our order for at least 20 minutes. We tried flagging a couple of the staff down but they completely ignored us. After about half an hour of waiting for them, we got up and left. It was a terrible experience. They clearly did not care. We shouldn't have to get up from our table to go find a staff member just to make an order. That's not okay. We ended up going elsewhere and will continue to do so."}
{"text":"OK food but we will not be back. My brother and I went here for lunch, and we understood AYCE places would be busy and that is fine. A table with three guys beside ours was served about three times as often as ours.  I had to ask 3 different servers to get a new set of chopsticks. The waitress didn't come by to pick up any new orders so my brother ended up walking our second order to the chef's area.  And the worst part?  We were served half the number of sushi rolls that we ordered!  Was the writing that bad?  Was there a sushi void somewhere?  I don't know, but it happened 3 TIMES!  10 pieces of salmon became 5, 20 became 10 and then 10 became 7?  I may not understand 'new math' but we wanted to eat and go and, instead we had to wait and reorder because the correct number of items that we wrote down NEVER ARRIVED! Gastronomically, the sushi and white tuna rolls were delicious that day, the spicy salmon was good and the strawberry ice cream was very nice at the end. I would stay away from the chicken wings wonton/gyoza and spring rolls. That being said, the service was bad and making someone doubt their math skills is just cruel. 10% cash discount mentioned elsewhere was not offered."}
{"text":"I went to eat lunch with my 4 other friends. There was nobody to take us to our table so we had to wait a while. The waitress we had was very rude and had a negative attitude. We never even got all of the dishes that we ordered! We ordered hand rolls in our first order, and in a cycle of 6 orders, we had 0 hand rolls. I absolutely hated the service. The only food we had was the shrimp tempura which was mediocre. We had a few rolls since the rice was falling apart and the fish was not fresh. The dessert however was actually decent. The waitress had actually ignored us many times when we called for her. The service was terrible and my friends and I would never come again. We wasted 16 dollars each just for some mediocre tempura and sushi rolls that were falling apart. Definitely not satisfied. We were not full and actually went over to the Subway next door. The wait for our food was very long as the average time for each dish to arrive was about 35 minutes. We didn't get all of our orders.   Service is terrible and mediocre food.   Fish isn't fresh.  Wait time is unbelievable.   NEVER COMING BACK."}
{"text":"For AYCE menu  In short, It's price is reasonble (If you compare the manyAYCE sushi restaurants in California) and the service is NOT.   You asked for a variety of sushi, beef/chicken side dishes, ramen and miso soup. Then came first the ramen, chicken and beef, reasonably implying that they are happier to stuff a hunger eater first with starch and meat, i/o sushi rolls for which most eaters go there.  Then, when you order, say five sushi, and there comes three, a trick often seen in AYCE restaurant.  Orders arrive late and last call comes just in time.   To be honest,  It's chicken and beef skewer is good."}
{"text":"The food here is excellent not very much selection of sushi compared to other sushi places but all the cooked food is excellent too. The down side is the service is the worst. Takes forever to get any food n most servers don't speak English which doesn't help. To top it off they add a tip onto ur bill n that sucks cause they never deserve one"}
{"text":"Be prepared to wait and wait and wait and wait at the front, the hostess seems to appear once a blue moon to see what your reservations are...waiting 20 minutes to tell her our reservations and to wait an additional x amount of minutes is punishment to your stomach...oh by the way we are still waiting"}
{"text":"My first experience here was on a Sunday night with a very, VERY large group. We had a get together of approximately 30 people. The man who was taking care of our tables was very nice and polite, despite the overwhelming number of orders he probably had to take from us. I have no idea how he was able to keep a smile on his face dealing with such a big group, but nonetheless, he was very hospitable.  As for the food, it was all very delicious. The main highlights were probably the ramen and ginger milk. If you come here and do not try the Ginger Milk, you are missing out! It tastes pretty much like dau fu fa (hot tofu pudding) but with a kick of ginger in it. It was very yummy, and nice and warm. A very relaxing dessert after the bloatedness of consuming all the buffet food. Another dessert I really enjoyed was the Mango Yogurt. It was actually very light and milky, yet not too sweet. It was so good that I had to get another one.  The only thing that really hindered the experience was how they kept forgetting to bring some of our orders. Also, whenever they came around and brought the food to our table, we were left guessing which dish was what, and sometimes we had to ask twice before they either gave us a response, or just looked at us with confusion.  I feel like this place could really benefit from the use of iPad ordering or at least using the checklist sheet where people can mark off what they want. Having to tell the server what we wanted every time was kind of a hassle.  To be honest though, I don't know if I would come here too often for dinner on the weekends. The price is pretty expensive for what you get."}
{"text":"Really bad service, and rude staff. The one at don mills is much better. Dont waste your time here."}
{"text":"Very expensive and the food wasn't good.  I ordered teriyaki salmon dinner($24) and the sauce was as thick and sticky as molasses.  All the dinner came with was rice and salad(the dressing for the salad was completely mayo based).. The only okay component of the meal was the rice. Would never go again."}
{"text":"A quick update on my feelings towards this Matsuda.   I went there yesterday with a few of my friends  because we were craving sushi so of course Matsuda is our go-to place.   The food was great, always fresh and hot/cold (whichever it needed to be).   The only thing I need to comment on is the new servers that they have hired. They are oblivious to their surroundings. I witnessed a server look and walk around aimlessly, confused and full of worry. She had no idea what she was doing. (This didn't bother us because she didn't need to serve us) Another server comes around and starts clearing plates off of people's tables. She came to pick up one of our tempura baskets and realized there was still one in it after she picked it up. She immediately said sorry and put it back down... and laughed it off. She did the same thing to the table beside us. Moments later she came and took the basket without even looking at it... We haven't touched it yet but ok.. take it i guess... I would also like to comment that this server smells really bad. She has insane B.O. and is in need a breath mint.   Now our bill payment was kinda difficult so we required some extra assistance. I went with 3 others so 2 of us were paying individually and the other 2 were paid together. None of us had the exact change (we all had $20+$50) combinations. We required change, but separately. Now the server (with the b.o) came by to help us with is. She asked us if we needed to split it so I said \"if it would make it easier then yes can you do that for us?\" She immediately says \"no\" ..... what? You did not just offer a split and then say no... LOL WTF.   Anyway, still a really hot spot for AYCE sushi and it is still recommended. There's always people who come and go in businesses so I'll let it go this time."}
{"text":"Went to this Japanese restaurant last Thursday for a lunch all you can eat. There were so many variety of food on the menu that we couldn't try all of them at one time. I like sushi rolls so much like rainbow roll, avocado/salmon roll and volcano roll.... I also ordered one of my favorite foods - avocado and salmon hand roll and it's so fresh and yummy. The Salt-Grilled Pacific Saury was so tasty and juicy that I placed 2 orders in a row. The food was apparently served so fast with a lot of different dishes on the table. I like this place with a very friendly and good atmosphere that I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Good food, fish is good quality, but bad service.   They leave out a lot of things when you order and dont bring everything, when I asked them to check what was left for our table no one had any idea what was left or able to answer, when they went back to check no record of things that were not brought and asked us to order again, theres a charge for left over food... how do i know if they have made it or not already? When they asked me to order again the waiter gave me some attitude, also had dirty cups for drinks."}
{"text":"We came here with my colleagues for a team lunch. We had a reservation but they were understaffed so it took them a while to greet us at the door.The service was extremely slow throughout the lunch. They did not bring food in the right order. For example the miso soup came after some rolls and teppanyaki orders. The sushi was just okay."}
{"text":"What is good: -the food is decent -the beef skewers are good -eel sushi is good   What is bad: -the orders are often missed \"forget\"  -they give you less of the quantities you order,  (order 15 sushi,  you get 8) -service is slow, I came here twice. Once on a Saturday night, restaurant is full, was slow.  Today I came at 35% capacity,  terribly slow even at 35% capacity.  -they lack servers to take your orders,  you best be waiting 10-15mins before someone show to help you.  I came to this place twice, didn't want to write a bad review, but after coming here a second time in the last 5 months thought things changed. It hasn't, terrible sushi restaurant.   Best find another sushi restaurant."}
{"text":"Love the choices on the menu. Golden shrimp, steak, baked seafood & avocado (some people don't like it but I just do!)   But the real winner at this place are the desserts! Love the mini desserts in shot glasses! We can eat a lot of theeese! yum!   It is a lil bit on the expensive side though. And watch out for the parking. I've seen a lot of people get bumps and scratches while parked in this area. :("}
{"text":"I loveeee sushi! This restaurant is 5 mins from home. I was so happy when I discovered this place. All u can get sushi for $12-13 bucks is a great deal. Whenever I come back to Toronto for my study break, I make sure I get my sushi fix at Matsuda. Sushi is fresh and delicious. My fave place for my sushi needs."}
{"text":"Went for ayce lunch on a sunday. booked reservation for 8 people. arrived and took a while before there was anyone at the door to show us to our table. got our table and waited for rest of our group to arrive. finally ordered round 1. waiter writes down your order, then it took a while to get our food. ordered soups, salads, rolls, grilled meats, tempuras, teppanaki items. soups smaller bowl than usual miso portion and other items quite small portions. sirloin rolls not so fresh. chicken wings oily. chicken skewers were deep fried and dry. salmon rose, had rice - other ayce places usually don't have rice! noticed most food is under seasoned and lacking a flavour. At least you can control the amount of salt.  round 2, ordered more rolls and grilled food. took awhile and they forgot some of the items. finally round 3 was dessert, this took awhile again but maybe because we were celebrating a b-day as we didn't tell them in advance so possibly caused a bit of delay. (note: they provide a simple ice cream dessert with a single candle and the waiter brings it out with another staff member, beat the drum and sing happy b-day. no free meal for b-day person or any other discount). fried banana didn't look good. mouses and pudding about 3 teaspoons. ice cream about 4 teaspons worth.  overall, food was ok, some not so fresh and greasy, service about what you we come to expect for ayce... long lulls between food being served and some items missed. not the worst ayce we've been but nothing compelling enough for a repeat visit.  And they automatically slapped on a 15% tip. This is after bill + tax so effectively 17% of before tax price."}
{"text":"Both the quality of the food and the service are poor.  - Took about an hour to be seated for a table of 2. They sat parties with multiple people instead. (Asian business mentality: larger table = more $$, small table = less $$) -Wait time to get food on average was about 15 minutes. They are extremely slow - Waiter forgot my order about 4-5 times.  -Waiter got my order wrong several times -Waiter charged me the weekend price instead of the weekday price. -Oh yeah, they'll automatically charge you service gratuity of 10%. I wasn't going to tip them but it's mandatory.  BEWARE, careful, those asian restaurants are all about the money and not about service or quality. They are sneaky"}
{"text":"Went here a few times and never had any issues. However, my last visit was abysmal. The lady at the front desk was just beyond rude ignoring our party. Food was mediocre...used to be better. The quality has really went downhill - for example, my avocado handroll had 1 slice of avocado and way too much rice. It's disappointing because Matsuda used to be one my favourite all you can eat joints. Now it feels like I'm a nuisance rather than a paying customer."}
{"text":"I took my company staff to this restaurant for a christmas dinner.  Staff was very friendly, the food was amazing and the chef had an amazing cooking performance that blew us away."}
{"text":"I normally don't prefer going to AYCE, but when friends/family want to go to an AYCE japanese place, then Matsuda would be a top choice.  FOOD : The food is generally okay for an AYCE restaurant, nothing really wows me . I don't expect quality when I'm at an AYCE, however sometimes the rice they use is very dry. Also, sometimes the cooked teriyaki items are bland and it lacks taste.  SERVICE: This place ALWAYS forgets orders. Majority of the time that I am here, I have to constantly remind them that some of my items didn't arrive. This is not a huge problem if it happens once during a dinner. But it's a problem when they continuously forget to bring my food!"}
{"text":"I came here on the day after new years for lunch and i am very reasonable, i know the place was fully packed when we got seated. But as a restaurant you need to be prepared with the correct amount of staff to service x amount of people on a holiday/stat day. We sat there for 2 hours me and 2 others and we only shared 20 pieces of sushi and drank lots of complimentary green tea. We asked for water and the waitress got mad and asked us to drink the green tea. At that point we asked for our bill and paid it and still tipped her like 3 or 4 dollars. I will never return to this restaurant or recommend it to others. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"This is one of the better AYCE Japanese restaurants and definitely the best in the area.  Everything is really good but my favourite things are:  - beef skewers (great quality meat and flavourful) - spicy salmon hand rolls (their hand rolls are good because they don't give you too much rice to fill you up like all the other AYCE) - beef udon, it's a tiny bowl but noodles have the perfect firmness and the soup tastes amazing. - Unagi sushi  Overall a good experience (been there around 8 times or so), but the their service is sometimes slow."}
{"text":"Usually go there at weekend for dinner. The restaurant is always full and have to WAIT for 30mins or more (for walk in). Probably better to have RESERVATION. Well trained and experienced servers. Tips are added to your bill by the restaurant already. Sashimi (fresh), sushi (good, try the chef's recommendation (black dragon roll, mango ross maki)), dessert (mango yogurt, mango pudding-good, not a fan of their mousse)  A bit disappointed about the grill and fried food, the food is always over-fried and nearly burnt, so tastes kind of bitter.  My favorite top 3 are the Chopped Squid sushi, Baby Cuttle Fish sashimi, and surf clam sashimi. Usually around $30 per person for weekend AYCE dinner, for lunch AYCE is less than 20 but NO sashimi."}
{"text":"It is never a disappointment coming here. The line up for a seat is long especially during the weekend during dinner; however the wait is worth it in my opinion. I've been here plenty of times, with huge groups of 12-15 to small groups of 3-4 people.   The food is fantastic for AYCE. You have plenty to choose from and you will definitely find your \"favourite(s)\" there. The mango roll is delicious (TRY IT!) and the sashimi is pretty fresh. Like all AYCE places, there are going to be some hiccups. The staff will sometimes mess up the orders or even forget to bring you your orders. Sometimes it takes (feels like forever) a bit of time for some of your orders to come. However, the staff is always friendly and is willing to accommodate whenever possible.   The atmosphere is what you can expect at popular AYCE. Loud but fun when you're with friends! Best part of Matsuda is the desserts. My advice to you: TRY THEM ALL!!! =)  Overall, this is unquestionably an AYCE sushi spot around me that I will be going to for a long time."}
{"text":"Lets not even talk about their food, the service is terrible. They don't have enough waitresses here. Some of the servers cant even speak english or chinese. And they just tell me to call a waitress, they dont get one for me. It took at least 10 minutes for a waitress to finally show up. They only have 2 waitresses working on a thursday night. This place is not worth going to. Will never come back"}
{"text":"Came here for a Valentine's dinner, and although the food was pretty good, there was a lot to hate.  To begin with, service was ridiculously slow. Took them about 20 minutes to bring our first plate of food, 10 more minutes for the second plate, then the teppanyaki chef took another 15 minutes, so it was a lot of waiting.  The worst part was the price. They have a weekday price ($29.99/adult) and a weekend/special day price ($34.99/adult) written in the menu, but they bumped up the price to $38/adult for this night because it was Valentine's day. The total was $97.28 (for 2 people), and they included a service charge into the bill so we couldn't choose what to tip them. The food and service was nowhere near worth this price.  It was also drizzling rain outside, so when we came in and put our jackets on our chairs, they put plastic bags over it and then I noticed they did this for everyone. I could only think of all the plastic waste that was being created. They also only gave plastic spoons, which is more waste.   As for the food and the chef, it was pretty good (but not $38/person good). Also, the chef was not as entertaining as other ones I've seen."}
{"text":"Really really slow service, and unlike other ayce places this one is in the past with no automatic ordering via iPad.  Is through a wait person who occasionally comes around. This likely is the explanation for the extreme slowness of not being able to deliver California or dynamite roll after 1.5 hours of waiting.  Only Good thing I would mention is the rock shrimp is fresh and tasty."}
{"text":"So, Tako Sushi is no more which is what this restaurant was originally called.  I`m guessing new owners, new staff and new decor.  They gutted this place and really modernized it.    Finally opened a week or 2 ago and had the pleasure of attending during lunch.  After looking at the menu we realized that this is an all you can eat place ($15.99).  They did provide us with a separate menu but it was very limited and that along with the  prices pushed us towards the all you can eat selection.  Pros:  The food was amazing.  Everything we ordered from the Miso soup to the chefs sushi special was absolutely delicioso.  Obviously I can`t remember everything I ordered because I am getting old I think.  Anyhoo, one food I do recommend is the Crazy Spicy Sushi or something close to that.  It`s actually fried sushi and it s off the wall, must try.  Cons:  Our first waitress was amazing, she was funny and really made an effort to bond with us.  The next 2 waitress were nice but they came around in very long intervals.  My suggestion is to make sure you place a significant size order the first time around.  Their is a 2 hour seating limit and that time flew bye when we placed orders every 30 minutes and it was just for 1 or 2 dishes. The toilets need to be attended to more frequently.  It really turned my stomach to see a stall that  looked like someones a**hole  exploded in there.  Thats all I am going to say because I feel like vomiting just thinking about it.  Summary:  Food is really really good.  The price is fair.  The decor is really nice and the place has perfect lighting to make anyone look good.  Opportunities for Matsuda Owners:  I think for you to succeed at this location, you will need to add a under $8 lunch menu, as this place is not as busy for lunch as it used to be when it was Tako Sushi.  One last opportunity, please do not have your staff wear a hazmat suit to go clean the bathrooms and then walk through the restaurant before and after."}
{"text":"I came here once and I don't think I'll be going back any time soon. The food was mediocre, just like any other AYCE sushi place but what really led me to giving this place 3 stars is the service and the ice cream. Every time I ordered something, they would either mess up my order or forget to bring me what I ordered. It was very disorganized and I didn't like their service at all. When it came time for dessert, of course, I ordered ice cream. The ice cream tasted funky and made me really sick. I had the worst stomach ache after. There are definitely way better and cheaper AYCE sushi restaurant out there."}
{"text":"I was here for my mom's bday :D  This is my 3rd time eating at this restaurant and it was awesome!!!!  It was not busy when I went there which is a good time to get orders!  I recommend their sushi, sashimi, appetizer, grills and dessert.  Tempura was great too!!!  However, I did not like their \"mini\" pizza and so as the fried chicken wing :(  The service overall was great!!!  I had my own little Post-it note to keep track of the orders, maybe that is why they did not miss my orders :P"}
{"text":"I want to first say that we originally were going to visit this restaurant on a Monday Night but after checking hours on the yp.ca (yellow pages) site thought it was closed (it was after 8:30).  To our surprise we found the correct hours the next day which is till 11p...  Someone should consider correcting that error as it may cause people to believe you are closed when you are not.  Most other web based sources appear to have the correct business hours.  We did notice that the restaurant appeared quite empty.  One reason may have been that the establishment is a little new.  I was a fan of the original establishment that closed down at this location (Tako Sushi) and was very eager to see how a All You Can Eat would be...I realize they are not affiliated in any way.    This AYCE restaurant is definitely a little pricier than the typical places I've visited on York Mills etc.  The interior does feel upscale and the staff were VERY attentive.  I did comment at one point that I felt *as if* the staff were beaten in the back room if they didn't remove the empty dishes (joking of course) but they were ALWAYS checking to remove plates, cutlery, etc when they were no longer needed.  And we were asked on numerous occasions by different servers if we'd like to order anything else.  I have to say that they were all more than helpful the whole night.  Food was presented well, fast to the table and nothing was missed.  Even thought the cost per adult is slightly higher than I'm used to I would recommend this restaurant to my friends without hesitation.  The menu had a great deal of selection and we still feel like we could go again this week and still find some interesting things to order.  Oh and there are Teppanyaki tables which I have not tried yet, we simply did regular dining this time. I still need to see how a full restaurant would affect the service and quality... but that will be for next time... ;-)"}
{"text":"The Mango yogurt and beef skewers were gooder.. The rest was typical AYCE quality. I would come back :)"}
{"text":"I'm all for local business but save your time and money and go somewhere else. If you're a vegetarian or vegan NEVER come here their broths that they claim are veggie based are meat based. They give you less than what you asked for and take ages to bring your order to you. And on top of that they don't bring everything you ask for at $28-32 dollars you won't be getting your money's worth. Not to mention the service is terrible, I got sauce spilled on me with not even a second look."}
{"text":"Went back to this restaurant every time we are in Toronto. Lots of varieties to choose from. Especially love their herring sashimi and tako wasabi. Also their all you can eat desserts too!  Although the restaurant is super busy, the waitress was super friendly and always had a smile on her face. Will definitely return again next time we come to Toronto :-)"}
{"text":"Our go to for ayce in Toronto. Good service, good selection and their sirloin beef, matsuda golden shrimp, beef tataki, eel fried rice and chawanmushi are our favourites. Do make a reservation though. It does get crowded."}
{"text":"Decided to go on a Saturday with a party of 12. I've heard this place gets packed at night so we decided to make a reservation. It still took around 10 minutes before we were seated but we were given a private room which was nice.   The ambiance is very nice and the place is actually spacious so there's enough room to move around. It took some time before our server showed up to take our order and don't come very often since we're in a private room. However they show up from time to time to check on us.   It helps if you write down your order on paper and just hand it to them. I was surprised to see that they don't give you a sheet and just tick off the items that you want (which is standard in AYCE japanese places). Our server was very friendly which is a nice touch.   Food quality is good. The ingredients are fresh and the rolls are very good. I have to note that we ordered the beef sirloin twice and the first time was cooked perfectly but our second order was overcooked.  Price is on par with other places. I would recommend this place but be sure you are prepared to wait."}
{"text":"This is definitely my favourite restaurant, I go there once a week and the food is always great. It's not the cheapest all you can eat that I ever had, but you definitely get what you pay for. The food is always fresh and unlike many all you can eat restaurants, they send over just what you ordered ( well...most of the time lol). The menu has pretty much everything you expect from a Japanese restaurant, except red tuna sashimi, which is very unfortunate. You can make unlimited orders and the portions are really small, so you have the chance to try a little bit of everything. Tea and water come to you table without you even need to ask for. In addition to that, desert is included. Staff are really friendly, but once in a blue moon they may screw up your order due to the lack of language skills. There's nothing that bothers me about this place, I have mainly good things to say. I've visited other Japanese restaurants, for the sake of variety, but I just can't find a place that come as close the price/quality ratio of Matsuda."}
{"text":"They have such a variety of options on their menu, you can find something for even the pickiest of eaters. Really good food.  Great service (Although, it doesn't happen often, orders can get mixed if very busy but it's minor so doesn't take away from the experience)  But yeah, would definitely go again!"}
{"text":"This location has ayce sushi and teppanyaki! One additional feature they added was putting a plastic bag over your coat which I thought was very considerate of them since the smell of the food can stick onto your clothes. Otherwise, the food is highly recommended for this place but the price is a little high-$33.99. So if you want to come here for a special occasion, I would def recommend!"}
{"text":"Went on a Fri evening ... Lots of ppl and got seated after 15 minutes. Place had lots of seat and the ambience was ok.  Ordering by checking items on a booklet was different but kinda effective.  Ordered maybe 20 items right away and the food was good... Salmon Sahimi was very fresh and grilled items was good.   Lots of shrimp choices.   Pop was $2.50 with free refills so that's a negative.  Food was good but other sushi places have more selections."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch AYCE and my party of three were greeted with the worst service ever! We ordered food and could not finish some and were charged $5.00 for not finishing all of our food...   The fish on the sushi was thinly sliced and it seemed like they made the sushi with more rice than usual. The green tea ice cream also tasted very strange...  The waitresses were all very rude and seemed like they wanted us to leave soon after we were seated. Safe to say I will not be making a return and will be spreading the word to friends and family."}
{"text":"Service needs improvement as it is quite slow. We came with a party of 6 and a 13 month old toddler. They charged us $4 because we offered the toddler a few nibbles of what we were eating. I felt so nickle-and-dimed. There are other much better AYCE sushi places where toddlers under 2 years can eat for free and over the age of 2, they charge only $2. We are never coming back to Matsuda."}
{"text":"This is the only AYCE i go to becase it's the closest. But for the price, the sushi/maki rolls are so tiny. Food that you order doesn't always come unless you complain about it. It's like they don't want to serve certain dishes, either because they are usually pricey or because you're the only one ordering them so the cook don't want to prepare for just your table. Anyway... yesterday I got a hair that belonged to the waitress in my ice cream. I asked for another one. I saw the waitress go to her colleague and she giggled about it. The only thing i can assume is that she took out the hair and gave me the same ice cream. It was a disgusting move! Other reviewers are also right about utensils not being clean. Maybe waiters should do their job the way they expect other waiters to when they go out to eat as well...."}
{"text":"It used to be better. Some food didn't taste the same anymore. Wait time for food was quite long. However, food selection was good. lunch AYCE is really worth it!"}
{"text":"I've been here years ago with a bunch of my friends (not in the VIP room) and back than service was great. Food was on point. However I recently came back here for a birthday party during lunch hours and the host reserved the VIP room. I found that at most times we had to wave down a waiter/waitress to get any type of service.  At times when we requested simple things like water and or forks it had to be asked more than once or we received it more close to the end of our lunch. Food was great but made me annoyed since the waiting time was not worth it especially during lunch hours."}
{"text":"Food Quality & Price: Quality of sushi was good but nothing to rant and rave about. There is a good amount of sushi options but in my opinion, not enough appetizer options. Sirloin steak was likely the best dish we had as well as the Mango Roll.  At $15.99 a head for lunch, the price is typical and average (though it is not hard to find cheaper locations). I enjoyed the salmon rose which was actually bite sized (and not over sized) in most places. The portions of food are consistently small including their ramen. For a spicy seafood ramen, there was minimal noodles, one shrimp and one piece of imitation crab (which took 15 minutes to arrive). The desserts also left much to be desired.  Anything that says \"mousse\" is simply flavoured whipped cream (including the chocolate custard cream pudding). The only dessert worth ordering is ice cream and mango pudding.   Facility: Modern decor and average washrooms.  Sight-lines are bad so unless a server comes walking by, it is hard to get someone's attention. Lighting is very dim compared to the floor to ceiling windows at the front of the restaurant (which causes very awkward lighting and very hard for eyes to adjust coming in and out) which makes it difficult to talk to someone who sits in front of the window. Music is barely audible and noise level is completely dependent on capacity.  Service: SNAIL PACED. My husband and I have experienced this restaurant in the past on weekdays (on which service is relatively timely).  But on this particular Sunday (before the restaurant was packed) there were 6-7 sushi chefs in the back and only about 5 or 6 waitresses working the floor. Food was coming out at almost 20 minute intervals.  We ordered some sweet potato tempura and started a stopwatch.  It took then 26 minutes to deliver this item (after prompting) and there were only TWO SLICES of tempura given to us. The average dish came out 20 minutes or so (and they were brought one at a time).   I also asked a server for their wifi password to which she said no. I asked a second server and she gave it to me on the spot. So everything seemed a hit or miss when it came to service.  We had three different waitresses take our order/deliver our order/ refill our tea. So I am not entire sure who gets the tip or how they split it. A 10% tip is AUTOMATICALLY charged on your bill by the way.  Overall: Do NOT go on a weekend.  They are horribly understaffed during that time and you'll end up waiting for longer than you can eat your food. We may return another time but definitely not on a weekend."}
{"text":"The place has a significant upgrade in renovations over the former Tako Sushi that was here. Much more elegant decor. There is an upgrade in quality of the food as well. All of the items we ordered were high quality.  For an all you can eat, there are quite a few menu options to choose from. The sushi was very good and the tempura shrimp was delicious. The beef ribs had very little fat and was very tasty.  Also ordered spicy seafood ramen which was quite good as well. In addition, there is a good selection for dessert which is also included. A little but pricier for AYCE in the area - weekend is $29, week is $26. Similar price to Spoon and Fork around the corner but here you get dessert. I would say you get good value. We look forward to coming back to try the teppanyaki!"}
{"text":"Awesome AYCE!!  Absolutely love their Mango rolls...a definite must have, so order it!!! Tempura is great, not heavily battered nor greasy! All in all their food is great!  Been a customer for the last few years or so and service is always good."}
{"text":"The hostess gave me attitude for checking waiting time. Went back a month later, same service. That makes it or breaks it for me."}
{"text":"Their spider rolls were some of the best I have had. Service might be slow but they usually give me a free cup of green tea while I wait for my order."}
{"text":"Been here 2 times and received the same disrespectful service. The hostess ignored us at the entrance. We waited for her to come back and another group of ppl entered and she still ignored us and decided to help the other group first. We didn't bother arguing why waste the energy when they don't appreciate business. Will never come here again and would not recommend it at all."}
{"text":"I go to a lot of AYCE sushi and I must say, this one is one of the best. The restaurant's decor is modern, new and with great ambience. Great place for a date.  Food was served so nicely.  I've never seen sashimi served on top of ice before. It keeps the fish nice and fresh just in case you don't eat it right away. They also added one that changed lights. not really necessary but was a nice touch. the food selection was huge but most importantly unique from other AYCE sushi places. They have their own Matsuda roll which is worth trying and also herbed salmon sashimi which is basically dill on salmon. The quality of everything we ordered was fresh and tasty. which isn't always the case in sushi buffet places.   The best part was the desert! So many types of mousse. I loved all of them!  on the weekends there is tofu cheese cake and creme brule. I will have to come back to give those a try."}
{"text":"The sashimi here has been fresh since the day this restaurant opened. Love it here despite the 'sarcasm' of the manager. He will learn it the hard way that his sarcasm will get him no where. Otherwise the food was delicious and quite fresh!"}
{"text":"We went to this place for dinner on a week night. The price for adults is in par with other AYCE sushi restaurants but a little high for kids. The service was not the greatest, but based on my observation of other sushi buffets, I think this is more of a culture thing than a waiter/waitress issue. One thing you may like or dislike about this place is that they include a 10% tip on the bill, so they have already decided for you what you will be tipping, to me that was in par with the service I received, to some that may not be the case. If you choose to tip more, you do have that option at the register ;-) Over all, I would go back."}
{"text":"This is the worse service I had on my life, I did asked to bring me water 3 times half of my order was missing when I asked the waitress she said sometimes they lost the order and you have to order it again. They bring each sushi plate to the table every 10 minutes, but when you asked for the bill they bring it away. Right the food was good but they have very very poor customer service. And one star is too much for this restaurant"}
{"text":"We went Friday at 5.30 and it was pretty empty. Left at 7 and it was packed!  People had to wait.   It was my first time eating sushi. I quickly realized I didn't really like it so I can't comment on the main stuff, but my friends happened to like most of what we ordered. From what other stuff I ate,  the food is okay.  Their deserts are tiny so order a lot; they're more on the bland side. The presentation was mostly nice though.   They have a lot of green tea,  soy sauce and wasabi on the table. They also bring in extra chopsticks and napkins as well as a big jug of water. You have to ask them for a fork.   We were in one of the rooms. The waitress checked on us at the right times.  Some food came quickly while others took some time but I wouldn't complain about it. I recommend ordering a lot at the start so you can eat while you wait for the other stuff.   Tips are included. It was 12%. Each person paid about $31. Drinks are extra.  I won't come back but people who like sushi should."}
{"text":"It was my family's first time coming here as we heard it was nearby. The decor of this place is nice, and its fairly large so it feels cozy. Youll probably be waiting 5-10 min for a table to clear if you go when it gets busy which is usually on weekend dinners, so try to go earlier if you can.  The variety of sushi they had was good, and they were quick to serve me and my family. While theyre are cheaper spots, for a $25.99 dinner it aint all that bad."}
{"text":"Waitstaff was quick to sit us down during dinner, even though the place was super busy. They were also extremely friendly, and everyone who helped our table had a huge smile on their face. As a patron, this is a huge plus whenever I eat somewhere; if the staff seem happy to be there, that's usually a good sign.   We sat for AYCE dinner, and the quality of the food was pretty good. Their sashimi was fresh and their rolls were great. As with most AYCE sushi, they have an extensive menu, and so I wasn't able to try everything. But the regular stuff (spicy salmon rolls, spicy crispy, california, dynamite, tempupra, teriyaki) was all pretty good. Not the best sushi (I still reserve that for a few sushi places up in Markham), but definitely can hold its own. Dessert left a little bit to be desired (between 2 of us we tried 4 desserts). Quantities were small and the ice cream wasn't the greatest, but hey, it's AYCE what can you expect.  I'd  go back with an appetite :)"}
{"text":"Waiter kept giving us the wrong dish, food quality was okay, but for the service, I rather go to the one on Steeles and Middlefield."}
{"text":"I suspect that this is run by the same owners as Ten-Ichi(http://www.yelp.ca/biz/ten-ichi-japanese-restaurant-scarborough) on Sheppard as they have similar menu offerings. Came here to celebrate the end of first semester exams and reintroduce gluttony to my yelping profile!   The location is very nicely laid out lots of open area and good lighting perfect for the group that we had (16). Odd thing to note is that the tables are bolted to the ground.   The food was fairly good, with the sushi being fairly average for ALL YOU CAN EAT and the Maki rolls being good! Their grill menu was also on par with Ten-Ichi so no problems there. Their dessert list is very large, I personally found it exciting that they offered durian mousse, but it was disappointed.   The service was interesting, I had made reservations due to the size of the group and they accommodated appropriately, however they had already gotten rolls prepared for us which is both a blessing and a curse. On one hand it means less down time, but on the other hand it takes away from the choice of what we wanted as our first round of ordering. The service staff was average but given the quality that the restaurant is exuding, I felt like they could have been more attentive and completed a higher percentage of orders.   Would come here again but not with a large group. 3 stars"}
{"text":"I've been going to Matsuda to get my sushi fix for the past couple of years. Whether it's lunch or dinner, I've never regretted a meal here before. The service can be slow during the dinner rush, but I can't expect the servers to move any quicker without the use of an iPad, or even a sheet you can mark your own orders on. This is something management should definitely look into. For now, if you don't have a solid hour or two dedicated to lunch/dinner, you should move on from their ayce menu.  The food is always fresh when I come here. I guess I'm lucky? My go to orders are the sashimi, salmon roses, specialty rolls, spicy salmon maki, shrimp tempura, Matsuda golden shrimp and sirloin steak. I especially like the light crispness to their tempura. The desserts are average, I always order the strawberry ice cream. It's a shame that they don't have mango ice cream! The yogurt is just too runny in my opinion.  Besides the food, one little thing I like about this restaurant is that there are advancement opportunities for the staff. Being a regular for years, I've seen servers who work their butts off to become managers. I enjoy supporting businesses that offer promotions to their employees, which is something you don't see often in some Asian restaurants."}
{"text":"Been here a number of times now.  First time was VERY impressed with everything from their unique rolls *mango roll is a must try*, to their entrees and desserts.  Subsequent visits have been hit and miss with different things, so the inconsistency is my only complaint, otherwise this place would have gotten a 5 star."}
{"text":"This is my go to sushi place! The servers are polite and fast and the food is always consistent and tastes amazing!"}
{"text":"Matsuda is probably my new spot for whenever I'm craving sushi, as my other has closed down. Coming here for the first time for a dinner on a weekday evening, left all my friends and I stuffed and very satisfied.   Before coming, I had really high expectation because all my buddies were raving so highly about this place, after leaving, they were justified.   Service is slow and meh. After ordering maybe 9 of one item, we were given around 4-5, not sure if they thought we wouldn't eat it all or what but this seemed to happen several times. It also took a while for someone to drop in if we needed anything. A button to call them would be very welcome.   Their menu is pretty big from what I saw, in comparison to some other places, and they have a lot of really nice specialty items like their Matsuda Golden Shrimp. It was so good we ordered it 3 separate times.  They do the classics like mango rolls, green dragon etc. very well.   The ambience is alright, we were a party of 8 so we were given a private room which has its pros and cons, so we couldn't really enjoy the decor of the main eating area, but we came for the sushi, not the decor so it was fine!   I'd definitely recommend this place for someone looking for a new sushi spot. A few of my friends that tried sushi here for the first time on my recommendation, thanked me for it. 4/5!"}
{"text":"Their menu looks exactly like that of Ten-ichi, a popular AYCE in Scarborough. Most of the food i ordered even looked similar. Taste and quality wise, it's on the lower end of the AYCE places.   Also, I ended up getting food poisoning there so I will not go back!!!!"}
{"text":"Weekday pricing is $23.99. Average selection of sashimi, hot foods. Many dessert options. Not bad pricing for the quality and amount of food you get."}
{"text":"FOOD ARE NOT WHAT YOU THINK YOU ARE EATTING AND SERVICE IS ...WAIT WHAT SERVICE?  Used to be good when it first opened. Slowly the food quality gone down hell. It's impossible to cook pork belly to the point to become dry, it's obvious that its some other parts of the pig. My favorite beef wrapped needle mushroom was flavorless. Cheaping out hardcore! The service? 1. Switched my food with the table next to us. 2. Our original waitress DIDN'T come by at all till we are paying. 3. When I order deserts they brought me the wrong ones. 4. Stopped this short toothpick size waitress to fix my order she gave me dirty look THE WHOLE TIME like as if I killed her entire family. She walked away, came back, didn't care to listen with her nasty ass attitude THE WHOLE TIME! Then at last she took the desert ran away without fixing the issue. I called her over to fix my desert order, instead she did not bother listening to the issue, grabbed the jello( what I did not order) and walked away mad!  The whole experience pretty much sum up to me paying them so I can serve them. Sad to see a place I once love turned out like this. When I had my birthday there in 2015 this place was amazing, was!"}
{"text":"i have a problem with this place.    The website times and the time they tell you in person for lunch times are completely different.  I brought my american boyfriend here to prove to him that our ayce sushi places are better than the ones in the states after hearing good reviews about it.  I WAS SO WRONG.  the FISH IS NON EXISTENT!!!!!!!!!  i was so disappointed.  im NEVER going here again... i know ayce sushi places dont really give u much fish but seriously, this was a waste of time!"}
{"text":"Worst place I've ever ate at. The food was ok good, but service sucked! We made reservation for 14 people, but only 11 of us showed up and they decided to charge us for 14 people. We ordered 50 pieces of salmon multiple times and got 30 pieces. Some of our food never showed up. Our waiter acted like she didn't want to take our orders. If we're paying $400+, I think we should get some decent service. But not this place because they automatically charge you for gratuity so service doesn't matter."}
{"text":"Food and service was mediocre. Overpriced for the quality of food served. Waitresses were meh."}
{"text":"Tepanyaki grill is lots of fun Food is well done and a nice show  Would be nice if they invested in a new system to draw the air up from the grill so you won't have your dog following you around after he meal because you smell like dinner"}
{"text":"This place is always so busy!!! Even with reservations u still have to wait. And the food takes so long to come out...The menu has lots of selections and the server was quite nice during this visit so that I would have to give a 3.5."}
{"text":"Please make sure you have enough time to have a meal at this place as food doesn't come to the table fast enough and we had to ask for the orders one after one.  We spent the whole 3 hours here in the past Sunday.  Otherwise, food quality is not bad there.  Another thing is that I saw one of the chefs who makes sushi/sashimi and swiped on his phone without washing his hands afterwards nor wearing hand gloves, that's not professional and bad things could happen."}
{"text":"Very poor quality of service. Rude and unprofessional staff."}
{"text":"The servers check your order and try to limit the amount of sashimi you get before theyd submit the order for you"}
{"text":"This place is okay as a sushi restaurant, it's nothing special, though it doesn't have many character flaws either. It's got nice ambience, and the service is relatively good. The staff isn't particularly attentive, but really, at what sushi restaurant is it?  The sushi was alright, nothing spectacular. Although I would recommend getting the Sunshine Roll if you drop by.  I mostly tried the sushi, as that's what I went for, but the other items on the menu looked really good, so I'm definitely going to try them the next time I go.  The food was reasonably priced. Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"It's my go to spot when I have a craving for a Japanese-style all you can eat. The food here is usually on point and the fish is quite tasty. I've been here a couple of times since they opened (used to go to the Scarborough location), and their quality is more or less the same. There is quite the selection on the menu, but I usually focus on the seafood. Service can be a bit iffy depending on the volume of people at the restaurant but they are usually responsive."}
{"text":"The service was terrible. I was there from 1:30-4 because the servers never came back to take more orders and when orders were made, it took half hr to actually get it. Not only that, l I thought I just had the stomach flu the next day but turns out it was food poisoning as my friend who was at dinner w me also had food poisoning."}
{"text":"The only reason I come back to this restaurant is mainly for the mango yogurt and pudding.. Disappointing that they have very limited sushi rolls especially for dinner. Also very inconvenient having to wave down a server for them to come take your order each time.. It's an ayce restaurant. Either upgrade by giving us those slips where you check off what you want or get an iPad. Also very annoying having the server tell you they will come back because they're busy and they end up taking forever. The matsuda golden shrimp is delicious though. Some of the food is pretty good overall. Just needs some improvement."}
{"text":"Came here for a work holiday party. Delicious sushi! Everything was really fresh. Fun atmosphere. I would go back. I did the all you can eat and it was too much food, next time I will go with the steak and sushi. Also I have food allergies and the wait staff was great and I had no issues."}
{"text":"One of my favourite all you can eat places. I have been told that the Don Mills one is the better branch. I have not tried the one on Steeles yet so no opinion from me. They have upgraded to use tablets when ordering. Staff is generally friendly but during busy times its hard for them to accommodate everyone so please be understanding. Call for reservations if you can since they get really busy. Usually when I start eating there is a line until its time for me to leave.  Must orders: Matsuda Golden Shrimp (Order this right away since it takes some time to make) Baby Cuttlefish (Only available on weekends) Octopus sashimi (Not the greatest but they don't have this everywhere) Sirloin Steak (Medium Rare) Pork Belly (Fatty and good!) Desserts (All the mousse, creme brulee)  They have a tepanyaki table too but I have not tried it yet. They have lots of parking spots but parking is quite tight in the back so you may have to Austin Powers your way to get out (kudos to those who get the reference)"}
{"text":"This place has good food but is really expensive at $30+ per person. Service is average and interior of the place has a nice atmosphere.  Price is way too high."}
{"text":"FOOD This is my favourite all you can eat sushi restaurant in the uptown suburbies. My husband will only come to this restaurant to eat and will go to no other sushi place.  We have yet to try their their location that was opened a while ago.   The food is always fresh and they have these unique dishes that you can only have it at this restaurant. If you're not a fish person, they have tons of selections of cooked non fish items.  PARKING Plenty of parking.  PARENTS W/ INFANTS OR TODDLERS Not really meant for you to bring a double side to side stroller. There is always one door locked. You can squeeze in a single stroller no problem.  I don't remember their being a change table in either men or women's washroom. Men's washroom, confirmed by the husband of course lol correct me if I'm wrong..."}
{"text":"T It can be a bit pricey but the sushi is on point. There aren't any restaurants nearby that can compete.  The staff are really friendly and the atmosphere is pretty nice too.  The wait times can be long for peak hours due to its popularity though"}
{"text":"I think this must be the worst AYCE place I've been to. The food comes out cold and very underwhelming. Ordered a Kimchi seafood hotpot and it was so sweet I could barely eat it. The nori that comes with sushi dishes were very soggy, especially the ones wrapped around temaki, making it tough to chew. Service was mediocre and dishes came out really slow, even on a Monday night. I probably won't be coming back anytime soon."}
{"text":"I visited this place with my friends because Kaka was already full. This place served really great food. I was very pleasantly surprised. I liked how they served all dishes properly. The sashimi slices came on a bowl of ice, and the grilled mackerel with the grated radish, sauce, and a lemon wedge. I especially enjoyed fresh sashimi slices, juicy grilled shrimp, and meaty kalbi pieces. The quality of food did not degrade towards the end of our meal. The servers were responsive, friendly, and prompt. I would say the desserts could have more variety. The mousses were rather similar to each other. I would just get the ice cream next time. I had a great time with my friends here. I would love to come back for another night of Japanese AYCE."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner with a couple of friends yesterday after having it recommended by a friend.  The sushi served was just mediocre at best.  The fish was not fresh at all and the selection is extremely lacking.  Although it's an all you can eat, the portions served just didn't make any sense.  There was 4 of us in the party and most of the dishes they served came out with 2-3 pieces.  We had to remind the server that we had ordered more food after 20 minutes of waiting and everything came at once.  This is your typical sushi restaurant catered to locals around the area.  If you are looking for real, authentic sushi, I'd advise to stay away and look for another place"}
{"text":"Out of a lot of Japanese AYCE's that are out there, Matsuda is definitely above average.  The service could do better, but the food is at least decent.  I think I was more excited about the plethora of desserts though.   Priced like any other AYCE."}
{"text":"Second review of this place and its for a teppanyaki lunch with my coworkers. I found the price quite ok for that amount of food. People who eat a lot won't be full since there isn't much rice per person  I got the sirloin steak lunch combo and it came with -soup and salad - 3 California rolls, 3 spicy salmon rolls - fried rice, pretty good. Very oily but good lol - fried veggies, mushroom and zucchini, I liked them as well. Wish there was a bit more. - your choice of meat, I got steak, that was really good, really tender and flavorful. - dessert which is ice cream   I guess since it's freshly cooked in front of you, you're paying for the service which is why price is a little higher for the amount of food. I do enjoy the experience though and eating my courses when they're hot.   Also, it takes a while since it's being cooked in front of you, we were there for maybe 75 mins."}
{"text":"Dined at the teppanyaki table, way over price for what you get. Service is bad, don't bother."}
{"text":"Weak and sometimes pretty bad service when it isn't even busy. Only come here because my friends order all the expensive stuff. Employee told me to write the table number on my order too."}
{"text":"This is the best all-you-can-eat sushi place that I've ever been to! The food was better than any other place I've eaten at, the presentation is beautiful. My group was about 10 people, we were seated, and had our orders taken right away. Food came to the table SUPER fast! I'm not a raw fish kind of person, so I buy everything that is hot (fried rice, chicken wings, ramen, shrimp). The only reason I wouldn't go super regularly is because it was pretty expensive. $33 for just the all-you-can-eat. But get the wings for sure, the wings are AMAZING."}
{"text":"Recently discovered this fantastic sushi place - everything about them was excellent, right from the fact that they're open till 11 to their phenomenal customer service and quick service. Their menu really stood out and they had some great innovative items on the menu. Highly recommend the golden shrimp, mango roll and snow roll! A bit expensive for AYCE ($30) but for the quality of food, it was worth it. Two negatives - too much wastage of paper due to a weird ordering system where you rip pages off a book and hand them in. The tip gets automatically added in, even if you're not a large group."}
{"text":"Theres not anything special about this place. It's decent food for AYCE sushi. I like them for the convenience.   What i've noticed is that their rolls are quite small. Which may not be a bad thing either. After you place your order, it takes maybe 10 minutes or so until the first dish comes. It isn't a long time for our order to arrive, but usually at AYCE places, your dishes come one by one so we are at least occupied. It's understandable for dishes from the grill to take longer, or even to make rolls. But for something as simple as ice cream, seaweed salad & garden salad, it still takes 10 minutes for them to arrive.  Thats really my only complaint. Not much to expect from this place.. or any AYCE sushi really  Mediocre food and the service improved a bit."}
{"text":"I tried this new restaurant for lunch on Saturday and was impressed by the taste of the food. Most of the items I tried were classified as being recommended by the chef. The menu was not as extensive as I have seen at other AYCE restaurants, but that was OK given that I liked everything I tried. I was disappointed that the Teppanaki tables were not open when I was there.   The design of the restaurant was clean and modern. The men's washroom was impressive. There were 2 private dining rooms.  Not a lot of parking out front, but there seemed to be adequate parking in the rear."}
{"text":"They have decent AYCE sushi (never tried their teppanyaki though) and I also prefer this location to their Steeles and Middlefield one - much better service.  Everything was made to order, they give us what we order and they don't skimp out on tiny slices of salmon. They have a decent selection of special rolls, they don't stuff the sushi with rice and their cooked items are pretty good as well.   It is pricey for weekday ($26.99/adult) and drinks aren't included.  I would come back."}
{"text":"We went here for a family birthday dinner with a party of 7.  The food for the most part was OK, nothing special but not horrible with a couple of exceptions.  The decor is nice and recently updated.  The problem is the service.  5 of us arrived together and 2 more shortly after.  They took orders from the first 5 but took forever to come and ask the next 2 what they wanted.  Then when we tried to order something, they said everyone else had already ordered so share with them.  Huh?!?  When it came there were 4 tempura shrimp to share between 7 people...  Every time we tried to get a large quantity of something so everyone could have some, we would only get a small portion.  We had a few things we ordered that took forever to arrive and several never came at all.  Their tempura was only average, not that hot and not crispy like it should be.  The sashimi was OK, but cut a bit thin.  They had something called \"golden scallops\" which was disgusting: a dollop of mashed sweet potato with a tiny bean sized piece of scallop hidden inside.  Yuck!  On the good side, their sirloin steak was quite good and cooked just right, not over done.  Their grilled shrimps were also quite good.  At the end when we were ordering desserts, it took forever to get someone to take our order.  Then we ordered a bunch of ice cream with various kinds and numbers of scoops.  What came was nothing like what we ordered.  I had asked for 2 scoops of red bean and a couple of others asked for red bean along with green tea and only one scoop of red bean was brought out. We had to chase down a server again to get what was missing.    Over all, I would say I wouldn't really care to go back.  Their menu is identical to Ten Ichi to the point I wondered if they are owned by the same people, but the service is so bad it would keep them off my list."}
{"text":"Like the other reviewers, I agree the food here is quite good.  Sushi is fresh and there's a wide variety to choose from.  We've been twice now for AYCE, and both times we found the service  acceptable.    However today, as a lady manager was walking by our table, she wouldn't take away our finished plates because she noticed that there were 3 pieces of sushi RICE left over.  Just the rice part.  Then she told us that we have to eat the rice!  (Yes, her exact words!)  We ordered 14 pieces of sushi, what's the big deal if we don't eat the rice on 3 pieces?  Tell me, when was the last time a restaurant employee told you that you have to eat your food?  How degrading!!!l     So do yourself a favour, be prepared to go to the washroom to flush any leftovers down the toilet to avoid a lecture.  What a joke!   Like the service or not, tips are included on your bill."}
{"text":"Matsuda is one of my go-to AYCE sushi places. I would rate their service pretty poorly, but I usually go on weekends. Matsuda's quality of food is very good. I really like their mango sushi and their sashimi. They also have a pretty large assortment of desserts. If I really feel like shelling out money for sushi, I would go to Matsuda. Their prices are comparable to Tenichi but Matsuda is slightly cheaper, I think.   I've gone in big groups before, and they are pretty accommodating. However, one of the times that I went, the service was extremely slow and we already wanted the bill by the time our last order came in. If you do go to Matsuda, (or really, any AYCE place) make sure you go with people who are fun to talk to, as the wait may be really long."}
{"text":"Went there the past Saturday with a group of friends (6 of us total) for AYCE and majority of us thought this was actually the best service we've had at AYCE. We had made reservation at 7:30 but didn't get seated to closer to 7:50.  At a glance Price: $ Rating: 4  Details:  Atmosphere/ Décor: 4 the Decor was nice for an AYCE. There is enough space between tables in the booths where you don't feel squished. The booth we were in could have easily fit 10 people.   Service: 4  Our host and first waitress was typical of an AYCE restaurant (service=meh). We got two menus to share between 6 people and after we ordered our first round she tried to take our menus away and we asked to keep both and she made a comment saying they were low on menus and told us to hide it.  For the amount we were paying for AYCE this was not good. I forgot what question we asked but it was related to the food and i remember one of her answer was i'm not sure i'm only part time here.  Our food came relatively fast but it was missing a couple of things, that's when one of the server (FIN) came and turned our experience from going downhill to uphill. We told him we want to place our second orders but we were missing a few items still and we don't want to double order if it's on its way (by this time we were probably already 30mins since we first ordered) To make the long story short, he pretty much followed up with all our previous orders to make sure they were put in priority and made sure all our orders came the 2nd round. We even asked for recommendations and he was so patient to provide that to us and answer some questions. On top of that he was so patient and personable! Best AYCE server ever!   There were these items that some of my friends did not like so we were trying to hide in the dirty food pile because we didn't want it to be that obvious we didn't eat it. He was re organizing our dirty plates to take away and saw those items and told us that we don't have to hide it (busted) and they don't expect us to like everything which was a nice touch.   Food: 4 Alot of choices, one of my friend does not eat raw fish and she had a lot of choices to choose from! some food were too dried or did not look that great but there were so many choices to choose from that it's expected. The food was very fresh as well.   Overall: Great place. Fin definitely made the service much better. Also they say the seating hour is 2 hours, our group was there till almost 11 and we never felt rush so that was really good! We just didn't notice the time until the staff were starting to leave or changed clothes and was waiting at the booths.   The place is a little pricey though for an AYCE ($38 taxes and 15%included) and it doesn't even include drinks but the service made up for it."}
{"text":"A lot of variety.  Pretty good for ayce Japanese.  However the salmon was definitely below average. It did not taste fresh at all. The white tuna was really good though. Service was friendly and fast."}
{"text":"Horrible service!! Food never came - we ordered sashimi and followed up 5 different times and only 6 pieces of white tuna came. Thats only one of the multiple orders we had. The girl was always confused and kept telling us the food is coming but it never did. To top it off she even over charged our bill. One of the worse places I've ever been."}
{"text":"They have fresh enough Sashimi & tepanyaki. Fun to watch & eat same time. You need to book for tepanyaki."}
{"text":"Exceptional service and one of the best quality AYCE around town.  I will definitely come back just for their service.  All their waiters and waitresses are very polite and well trained. Very follow through your orders and very caring."}
{"text":"Expensive! But worth coming on a special occasion. Food is good and you could tell it's fresh. Lots of different variety and the flavour is good for the most part. Lots of different selections for sushi and delicious desserts. Service is good. Restaurant is spacious and beautifully decorated. Would reconsider visiting again in the future."}
{"text":"Excellent food.  Good value.  But this place is always busy.  Will definitely go again.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"One of the better AYCE sushi buffets in the area. It's quite expensive, but so good! I love their golden shrimps and maki rolls. The dessert is yummy too. I would say this is basically the same as Ten-Ichi (perhaps owned by the same person lol!?). Their menu items are extensive, and I have yet to be disappointed! They do get extremely busy during weekends though, so reservations are key in getting a table!!"}
{"text":"Wow this place got busy quick. I got there around 7pm and there were a few people waiting. Once I got seated people started to pour in.  It was zoo in there.  The place is nicely decorated with red latterns and wooden style layout.    The sashimi was very fresh gotta give it to them but seriously when you ask me how many pieces I want and I ask for 20 don't give me 10.  What is the point in asking.  When I originally asked for a plate for 6 people and allow her to make her own judgement.  This happened the whole night.  The sashmi they gave less but I love how they gave us more rolls when I asked for 1 than gave me 3.  I know they trying to fill us up with rice... blah blah blah.. heard it all before.   Service was pretty bad as they seriously lacking staff and I hate how the server that bring you food cannot take order and when you ask one they will be like one moment I will get someone for you but no one ever comes back to you until you flag someone else.  They have a nice collection of  dessert which is like Ten-achi the place I normally go to.  Mango pudding, mango yogurt, ginger milk, ice cream (I can't believe they do not have Mango Ice-cream!!! That is what I get everytime).  So I settled with green tea and red bean ice cream.  They also have a handful of mousses like lychee, taro and durian.  They also have deep fried banana but it was kinda weak."}
{"text":"By far the best all you can eat sushi restaurant I have ever been to. Sashimi is always fresh. I always look forward to the mango yogurts for dessert. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"The food was low quality sushi, sashimi, maki, etc. And they charge you 29$, its so expensive. Not worth your time and money."}
{"text":"A very good place in terms of quality vs prices. Nice setup and quick service. However, the waitresses could use some training to make you feel a bit more welcome."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place 4 stars. We didn't have reservations so we waited to be seated.  The wait was long... Maybe 45 min... So make reservations if you're going on the weekends.  Food was actually good!  It's the small things that makes a huge difference! The ice under the sashimi plate.   The sliced onions and garlic chips with the beef tataki. This place does not use the same sushi sauce for everything.  They use the correct sauce for the dish.    Anywho... I would say a good place for all you can eat.  Try them out if you are near.  Oh, you don't order from an iPad or write how many you want per dish, you actually tell your waiter.   Happy eating!!  ?????: 4/5"}
{"text":"I think this place under went new management from the last time I went because they had a change of name and decor from what I remember. Setting wise, I enjoy how the restaurant is very spacious, and since it was lunch time, I didn't have to wait long to be seated. In terms of food, the menu is pretty much the same as any other AYCE sushi place, BUT the dessert menu is especially long.  Let's focus on the actual food for now. The other foods on the menu are pretty typical, I think my top items would be the sirloin steak, and the matsuda Q sushi pizza. I chose the sushi pizza not so much b/c it tastes especially good, but because it's MINI sushi pizzas which I found to be very cute and convenient to eat. I WAS looking forward to the volcano roll which I've had before, but this time it was cold, and as the name suggests, the roll is supposed to be HOT. Which leads me to a major issue in this restaurant, much of the food we were served that were supposed to be hot, or at least warm, were not. This really ruins my perspective on the food here.  Dessert wise, the long menu was very impressive, but I couldn't help but notice that certain items such as the mango yogurt, the tiramisu, and the chocolate mousse were all knock offs of the Tenichi desserts. They even copied Tenichi's dessert presentation with the shot glasses. However despite this they did have items that were unique to them (as far as I know) such as the durian mousse (which was unavailable along with many other items that I wanted to try). I think dessert was probably my highlight at this restaurant, Since I think I ate more dessert than I did actual food.  Finally service was good and bad. Our main waitress was a cranky cranky girl, and it doesn't help her attitude towards us when my friend almost poked her in the eye while he was stretching. However there was another lady who provided us excellent service. She was patient, and smiled often. So it depends on your like in terms of the service you will receive. However food comes REALLY slow here, which I think is why our food was always cold, 'cause it was made a long time ago, but no one brought it to us.  Overall, Matsuda was a \"meh\" experience, good enough to return to (since the lunch is pretty affordable, though I forgot the price), but not good enough for me to really crave like I do with Tenichi (yes that is my face sushi place)."}
{"text":"Came here during peak hours for dinner and oh my god HOW DO YOU NOT HAVE A FILL OUT SHEET FOR AYCE DINNER?! By this alone, you already know you're gonna have a bad time....  Poor servers have to write EACH QUANTITY and EACH ITEM on a SMALL ASS PIECE OF SCRATCH PAPER.... Like wtf!????? How about you guys invest in some print-outs to make it easier for yourselves? God damn, don't kill yourself!  Anyway, service seemed rushed, after ordering a second round of unagi handrolls I noticed they compensated by putting BANANA in mine.... like really? What if I was allergic to that shit. I mean I do love banana's, but I'm preeettttyyy sure unagi hand rolls have just unagi in them.... and not banana. They were also very inconsistent with the output and we received numerous items that we did not order, but we ate them so fuck them lol.. Not my fault you didn't know which table to give it to =p  Their dessert menu has a large variety which is good, but the flavour of most of the items on there were bland. The tiramisu tasted funny, the durian mousse just had a hint of taste, and the other mousses had me thinking this shit was just whipped cream with fancy topping. HONESTLY!! This is coming from someone who understands and knows what real mousse tastes like! ANDDDDD they reuse plastic spoons for their desserts. LIKE YOU'RE A FUCKING DINE-IN RESTAURANT! WHY YOU SERVING PLASTIC SPOONS??????? This is not a fast food joint! Ugh... soooo shit.   Needless to say I thought this place would be decent because it looked poppin' (full house) but it really is not all that it's cracked up to be. Definitely not coming back, and sushi should not be one of the things you cheap out on. Seriously."}
{"text":"I've been going to Matsuda since high school ( 4+ years) and it has been consistently good in terms of food, service and cleanliness of restaurant. Food arrives quickly to the table and usually orders are not forgotten, everything is accounted for. Their menu is very extensive and features a lot of different items to suit a variety of different people.   Recently, they've implemented a new ordering system. Previously, they had a typical ordering system where you just tell the waiter what you'd like to eat but now they provide every table with a booklet of sheets that can be marked and ripped out. Each sheet has approx. 10 different menu items and a little box beside it to mark the # you'd like. This is a LOT easier than their old way.   Also, being a vegetarian, I appreciate when restaurants put a little green leaf/broccoli symbol next to items that are vegetarian friendly. It saves me the trouble of questioning them on all their dishes. Sushi doesn't have too much rice, and tastes fresh. Tempura always arrives hot to the table and it isn't too oily. Large selection of desserts as well, my personal favourite it the mango pudding.   Would recommend/visit again for sure!"}
{"text":"The most horrible experience with customer service I have ever faced in any restaurant in my entire life. If you want to watch staff walk around looking for things to do as you wait a minimum of 30 minutes for your food then I advise you to come to this location."}
{"text":"Ok food .  Nothing special. Over priced for All you can eat. $37 per person and we got a mouthful because we didn't finish a sushi role."}
{"text":"I came here on a weekday for lunch, restaurant wasn't busy but service was pretty nonexistent. The tea was hot but lacked the tea component, had to ask for more tea leaves added to the pot.  To my surprise there was no longer sashimi on the lunch menu, we upgraded to the dinner menu instead.  Food came our very quickly after we put in our orders, and again to my surprise the food was quite decent. Definitely no oversized sushi to fill you up, and the meats were not overcooked like many ayce places.  The Golden shrimp wasn't very hot, was barely warm, very tasty, mentioned that to the server and the next round was just perfect.  The beef was very good, the sirloin steak bits with fried garlic and the beef wrapped enoki rolls were just cooked to perfection!  Will definitely earn another star if services were a bit more attentive."}
{"text":"Still absolutely the best all-you-can-eat sushi place in the city, in my opinion. Ignore the whiners below. If there's a better place, let me know, because I haven't found one that even comes close.  No, this is not $150 omakase sushi, this is all you can eat, but it is truly outstanding! And I dare you to find fresher fish and more yummy side dishes for lunch at only $18.95 or so, anywhere in the city.  Do not miss the golden shrimp, big bouncy fresh shrimp tossed in Japanese mayo and tobiko, the tasty chicken and beef skewers, surprising Japanese hash brown patties, super fresh teriyaki salmon and chicken, or the dozens of other excellent dishes that can accompany your choice of sushi nigiri, hand rolls, and maki.  Personally, I cannot get enough of their amazing teriyaki chicken, which is not anaemic grey chicken drowning in a gummy sauce like so many, but is lightly sauced, with crunchy delicious skin, well seared on the teppanyaki flat top, and always just too good!  And if you are there for dinner, make sure to order at least one of the avocado seafood salad, it's a delicious avocado mousse with tiny flecks of scallop scattered throughout, baked in a scallop shell, truly a unique treat in addition to all of the other delicious all-you-can-eat items.  Order it early in your meal, because they are made fresh and take a little while to bake in the oven.  I always laugh at the number of people who, on any all-you-can-eat sushi review page, actually believe that there's some great conspiracy to withold food and bring them the wrong orders, when they should just not accept anything they didn't order, and reorder anything they didn't get, easy! It's all-you-can-eat people!  Beautiful decor that is definitely date-worthy, fresh, delicious, well-prepared food, and a great price for a lot of food, this place is still a huge winner for me!"}
{"text":"Went for dinner. Charged $ 38 with tip automatically added.  Liked charred sushi. Not all the orders came in."}
{"text":"I love the all you can eat options. Despite being a bit pricey, the food is fresh and it taste good. We tend to  go as a group and order a lot at once because getting a hold of the waiter after is really hard due to it being so busy. The dessert options are also pretty good despite it being  in small portion. The  fact that its all you can eat and you dont feel rushed out, when we  keep ordering is amazing. Its a great place to grab food  as a group or as a couple."}
{"text":"New place that took over the old sushi taco lol I know that's not how to spell it.  Place looks great! The entire black and purple is fantastic! The door has been relocated, the  teppanyaki area looks top notch! Bathroom was really clean, and urinal kept full of ice!  The price is a little higher then most ayce only by a dollar or two tho, not a big deal!  Lunch prices start at 9.99$-12.99$ (a la cart) quality is good, I only went for a lunch bento box so I can't talk about the sashimi or any thing and again how much \"quality \" does one expect for 10$ Staff are trying really hard to be friendly, yet had to ask three times for water, for sure there is room for improvement.  Will be back for ayce dinner and will update review, for now it sites at a 3*/5*"}
{"text":"Simply the best of the AYCE sushi places in and around Toronto.  Quality and selection is excellent, but because it is large and welcoming, there aren't the long line-ups and reservations typically needed at Ten-Ichi. Plus the food is better!  and more selection!  Faves include the Sashimi, Beef & Chicken Skewers, Teppanyaki Garlic Sirloin, Golden Shrimp, Assorted Tempura, and of course the shot-glass desserts, especially the mango yoghurt, and lychee mousse.  Great food quality and OK-to-weak service for an AYCE, plus excellent selection still makes it a winner in my books."}
{"text":"For an AYCE it's over average, this place servces great quality sushi, teppenyaki dishes, efficient workers and the decor is nice and clean. Monday-Thursdays $28.99 Friday-Sunday $31.99 Weekend has a few premium items like ginger milk and creme brulee, the ginger milk is sooooooo good, I down like 10 of them at the end haha. The salmon here is very fresh, and the grilled salmon nigiri has dill and a lemon aioli, whew so good. From the grilled section my favorites got to be the chicken teriyaki, and chicken skewers. In the teppenyaki section the sirloin steak, grilled flounder, jumbo shrimp, unagi, and seafood fried rice. Desserts, the mango yogurt is insanely good, you're going to order 5 trustttttt. Its like a panna cotta but a custard at the same time. This is my go-to AYCE sushi place, will come again every few weeks."}
{"text":"Went for the teppanyaki lunch with a group of 18. Good quality ingredients and great tasting food.  Would have scored them a 4 but service and timing was not so great. Drinks forgotten, one side was finishing up when other side got food...needs better service."}
{"text":"Horrible experience. Would not honor dietary restrictions. Would not allow ordering a la carte at the same table as all-you-can-eat guests - forced me to eat apart from my friends. Food was greasy and over-riced. Servers and managers were rude. Would highly recommend avoiding in favour of other options in the area."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time a few months ago despite warnings from a good friend. The food was good and the service was great regardless of how busy they were. To me it was a restaurant that I would definitely go back.   But oh boy was I wrong. I came back on Jan 28 on Saturday for lunch with 3 of my friends. The service was lacking. They had quite a few waitresses and it took way too long for them to get our order.  It would take at least 3-5 mins of waiting with my hand in the air waving the order till they came to our table to take our order.  Some of them saw me and the had the audacity to look away and pretend like they didn't see me. This was unacceptable. Food was fine and such til the waitress came up to me and warned me to not leave any food as there would be extra costs charged onto the bill. I understand that the waitress needs to inform customers this, but the way she said it was not considerate at all and nor did she ask or thank me for my understanding. As a waitress, one should be as considerate as possible when addressing customers, regardless if the situation was bad or good. I took this as a simple gesture from the waitress and decided to not think much of it.   A couple hours later since we left the restaurant, one of my friends started to have lower bowel pains. He complained of extreme bloating and pain. I thought it was peculiar and that it might've been just him not feeling well. I guessed wrong because a few hours later my 2 friends and I started to also develop pains. What a coincidence. I took a tyenol and my pain did not subside at all. So I headed to the nearest pharmacy to grab extra pain relievers. All of us had to constantly run to the bathroom with extreme lower bowel pains. There's no way all 4 of us could get sick at the same time, and since we did we knew it was from Matsuda. They really need to double check their stock and they should review the methods that they're using to store and prepare their foods.   We've already spent enough for a ayce lunch, we didn't know we also had to spend additional money on medication. I don't know which items made us sick, but I know for a fact none of us will ever return to this establishment."}
{"text":"I have been to both the one locked in York mills and Don mills and this one. I totally prefer the service and atmosphere of the other location but I'll have to admit that this one has a better quality in taste. Unfortunately most of the servers that bring out the food cannot speak English thus making it quite difficult and frustrating to ask for specific things such as a spoon, or napkin. My server came rarely to check up on us even after we have finished the first round of order. And I also find it frustrating how I had to repeat one of the item, that I've ordered, three times to finally have it served. Interior decor wise, I'd much rather go to the other location where there are more space and less crowded and decently quiet with a relaxing ambience. This location was definitely more crowded with a high noise level."}
{"text":"Maybe because I came here during national holiday, it appears that the restaurant overbooked and there is a long line up of people near the restaurant entrance. Even though you reserve a table at a certain time, it doesn't necessarily guarantee a spot  The restaurant is well known for its AYCE. Service-wise, they are pretty good. Food comes quite fast but im sure they have all been pre-made. For example: the sashimi wasn't that fresh.  The sushi isn't hot as evident by the temperature of the rice.  The cooked fish is a lot better for example the meat with mushroom.   My conclusion is that the food isn't the best, but the service isn't bad at all. The biggest value proposition is that the service is fast!"}
{"text":"Food was mediocre, service was slow and food came out even slower. You order 10 pieces you get 4. Half the time the food wouldn't even come and we would have to reorder it. Took 15 minutes for the bill to come when we had enough of the awful service and just wanted to go home. Server counts the money infront of us as we are eating our dessert."}
{"text":"Nice decor, good service, fresh foods. When it comes to AYCE Japanese food I still like the checkbox/paper system better, but this place is alright.   Sashimi is okay, rolls were a bit dry. The hot food seems to be the better choice. The fried chicken wings and short ribs were freshly made. Teriyaki chicken were nice and crispy. The fish soup (Veggie Fish Hotpot) was quite good it had a lot of mushrooms in it. The tempura was okay, it didn't have a lot of batter on it, for me didn't have the crispiness or crunch that I liked. The grilled eggplant was good but the portions were small. The mochi maki never came.   Ordering system seems a little flawed as I mentioned, items didn't come or were forgotten. Things got a bit slow when it was too busy.The service seemed to be okay, they tried to help us fix things when problems occured and the servers were quite courteous. I'm not much of a fan of AYCE anymore. I find the quality of foods lacking and items are quite boring now. I really had all I can eat."}
{"text":"Probably the best sushi i've ever had. Everything tastes so fresh and it's a little pricey for dinner but absolutely worth it. I don't live close by but I would definitely make the drive for this amazing food!"}
{"text":"Impressed by the sushi and sashimi as well as the outstanding service!  Their teppanyaki is nothing special, lacks a bit in flavor.. but will definitely return for their fresh sashimi and sushi!  I recommend this place, best AYCE sushi I have tried in Toronto"}
{"text":"I don't usually give such bad reviews but this one was earned.  Ok so first, no one came to our table for a solid 15 minutes after we were seated, and this is at lunch time when most people don't have an unlimited amount of time to be at a reataurant. Then she only brought all you can eat menu. Ok. So we did all you can eat.  I told the waitress I'm a vegetarian when we ordered, but when the food came out she brought everything but my veggie rolls... Took another 15 minutes to get someones attention about it... Seriously its an avocado roll. Beyond that, the vegetarian options were cucmber, avocado or sweet potatoes. Also I ordered grilled eggplant which was not cooked throughout... You can see when eggplant is not cooked.  Maybe I was disappointed because this place used to be amazing, it was an experience. This was like a disorganized shuffle. We got food we didn't order, didn't get food we did order.  Not coming back."}
{"text":"Once this place used to be worth 5 stars for quality, price point and service. But now i have over the years seen it decline and get worse.   I originally used to eat at their first location in Markham. And was super excited when I found out they opened this one on Don Mills.   The price has increased about 3 times since they opened. I think at one point it was 22.99$ then 24.99 and now since I visited today it was 31.99$ for weekends ! That's very expensive for an AYCE place and especially since the quality isn't the same as it once was.   The food usually comes in a fast manner and they'd never miss an item you order. Although lately it's been slow, and the seaweed is soggy aka translate to sitting around for long periods of time. Instead of still crunchy!   Anyways really hope they'll improve on the quality and freshness. As usual their service is the same attentive and fast, just not the food delivery lol."}
{"text":"We came with a party of 12 for a birthday dinner buffet on a Thursday night.  I don't know what is going on and why sushi buffets are so insanely busy on weeknights now?  The restaurant is pretty big but it was a full house with people waiting to be seated in the wait area.  We used to dine here when it was Tako Sushi but haven't been since it switched to Matsuda.    We were seated right away which was nice.  They put us in a room near the front....which I thought was nice at first.  But no one was looking after this area.  Literally no one came in to check on us and take our orders.  I had to run out to the main restaurant and drag a server into the room to take our order after sitting there for 30 mins.  Then because we had a large group and a large order, I think the kitchen and sushi chefs pushed out all the small orders first.  It was another 30 mins before our food trickled out when smaller tables that arrived after us were eating way before us.    We were all starving by that point so polished off the food in like 5 mins.  We put in another order.  I of course had to run outside and drag the waiter into the room again.  We made a bigger order this time since we were still starving and it takes so long between orders.  We waited another 30 mins and they brought out 3 bowls of mussels with 4 mussels in each bowl which worked out to 1 mussel each person.  Then another 15 mins later....another small order comes out.  By that time we were all tired and cranky so didn't feel like eating anymore.  We asked them to cancel the majority of our order.  We then asked for dessert.  Had to wait another 20 mins to bring out ice cream.  Wtf? We figured it was pre scooped! By that time the restaurant cleared out.  We were the last ones there.  I think 2 seatings ate and left.  We all left tired and still hungry after a 4 hour marathon of a weeknight meal.  Wasn't cheap either for about $30 a person.  The food that we did eat was good which is the only reason for the 2 stars.  Sushi and sashimi was fresh.  The service was just incredibly slow and they didn't even make an effort to check in on us at all.  It was really annoying having to run around the restaurant to drag people in to take our orders, refill our water and tea because we were parched and the orders took forever and didn't come out right.  They need more of a first in first out system rather than big tables last.  I complained but it fell on deaf ears.    My uncle and aunt tried it out, just the two of them and it was fine.  Just don't go with a large group."}
{"text":"Matsuda is average as a AYCE. Food and service are both fine.  highlights: unagi don is really good here. I also liked the matsuda golden shrimp which tasted good but alittle too much mayo for the stomach. Beef sashimi is also good here.  I would still return to matsuda once in a while when i crave some easy sushi and feel lazy."}
{"text":"I love to come here for the scallop and amaebi sashimi it is always fresh. The hot items and everything else on the menu has good flavours but only when you get it on a fresh day.  Wondering why I have posted 1 star though? Well due to countless ( over 20) of service issues.    Been coming here for over 5years with family and friends. Really the quality and service has dropped substantially.   I can only really count on the sashimi being fresh.   The wait staff here have mastered the art of gossip, and ignoring ! I am really disappointed with that. For some reason Chinese people love to gossip about their customers/ laugh at them while they are eating. Not right and down right disgusting behavior. Especially since this is supposed to be an good time!  And they don't like people to waste a bite, Yes I know it's horrible to waste food, however we all been in the over ordering boat at AYCE sushi ! And sometimes even receiving other people's orders!   But seriously GET OVER IT MATSUDA! People will have 1 bad piece here and there and ya damn right if items we ordered are not cooked we will let you know !  This is the 2nd problem we have with Matsuda over the past 20 times coming here. When things were undercooked or not ours they have a big angry gossip fest for the next 2 hours as if we personally attacked them! Next thing to ensue is slamming all the upcoming dishes on the table or dropping it / squashing it \"accidentally\" on top of other plates....  List goes on, I would be here till he'll freezes over about the petty attitude of their many servers.   Anyhow if you can stand being treated like shit for fresh sashimi. By all means go ! But that is all you will get that's good!"}
{"text":"Excuse my ugly photos lol I was dining with a group of 12 people so they table was huge and akward. We came her for ourfamily Christmas dinner, we sat down and noone came to check up on us, we weren't assigned a waiter and not even water or tea was offered. We waited about 20minutes before we could flag anyone down and trust me we were getting impatient and hangry! I couldnt believe that I had to write my order on a piece of paper to than transfer my order to the waitress.. too long and complicated process. It didnt take long for the food to come out but there were missed orders and things that came that we never ordered.. etc. Poor organization. The food was okay, ive had better sushi.. i find the rice too fluffy and thick but the cuts of fish were good, consistent and tasted fresh. They had some unique items on the menu from other AYCE places which gave them bonus points and an extensive dessert menu. Loved their fried bananas!!!"}
{"text":"Good buffet of Susie and other Japanese baked food. Lots of see food. However, my favorite is the Beef Stake Japanese style.  The place is big and clean. Workers here are young and nice.   It is about $14 for an adult."}
{"text":"Came for dinner tonight.  We had to stand in the lobby for 10 min for a hostess to come. When she finally arrived, we asked for a table for two. She looked at us and said '20 minute wait'. The restaurant was half empty.   They probably wanted us to wait for a table for two to open up instead of giving  us a table that sits more people in case a bigger group came in. Not the way to treat customers."}
{"text":"The quality has gone down since half a year ago. I've always enjoyed eating here but the service is extremely slow (way more so than before). There were many missed orders and most of the food didn't come until the last 20 minutes. At one point, no food came for a good 20 minutes. Many of our orders were given in the wrong quantities. The miso soup has also become very salty. I felt like it wasn't worth it to pay $20 to go eat there since barely any food came until the very end. Even desserts took a long time to come. Yamamoto at Pacific Mall has better and more consistent service and I will not be going to Matsuda anymore.  I refuse to pay $20 to sit there for 2 hours and not have my food come."}
{"text":"This place replaced another japanese restaurant and the renovations are really nice.  I came here for lunch and had the salmon bento box.  Comes with rice, fried gyoza (these were gross), salad, and california rolls.  There was actually a bigg serving of salmon compared to all other lunch bentos I've had - two long pieces.  But it's pretty bland and I probably wouldn't try it again.  I have to say though the dressing for salad was actually outstanding! It's a peanut salad dressing and I would want to come and just order a big bowl of salad to eat haha.  Also, they give you ice cream at the end so that's always a nice touch."}
{"text":"Decided to have AYCE sushi tonight, food was good, above expectation! They are not cheap like other AYCE places, most ingredients felt fresh to me, sashimi wise I prefer salmon and white tune. Mango roses maki was yum, steak was cooked perfectly. Service was great, they have waitresses who are solely responsible for taking dishes away and delivery. Some are to solely take orders. System is good. Environment is decent, clean. No complaints. Will come back for sure."}
{"text":"Came on a Tuesday night and it was still so busy so call ahead if you don't want to wait The food is ok- I'm not a bad fan of sashimis so I had to ordered the cooked food and it was ok. The sushi, and tempuras tasted very stale, while the other stuff tasted more fresh. The waitress was nice but she didn't put a lot of my orders in but it was probably bc she was handling 8+ other tables so it's w.e Overall if you like sashimi it's a good place to go since my fam was going ham about how good it was. If you don't like sashimi then go somewhere else."}
{"text":"The employees were focused on closing down the restaurant instead of their customers. We've waited at least 30 mins to get our bill. The food was good though but the service...meh!"}
{"text":"Came for a dinner for two on Friday night. I have been to other all you can eats on Friday nights before so I know how busy it can get. However, this particular time was the most horrible service I've ever experienced. Our waiter disappeared. Leaving us waiting over 40mins for ordered food. When we finally got the food, so many things were wrong or missing. When we told our waiter, she just nodded her head and took another 30mins to bring back another set of wrong/missing food items. It was so bad.   We did not feel like we got to eat what we ordered and ended up just leaving with room still in our stomachs.   I will not be back to this location or any other Matsuda. If you're spending 70$ for two people, you expect some kind of service and quality. There's plenty of other places out there. Take it from my experience and go somewhere else!!"}
{"text":"Food is pretty good. Some dishes are better than others. Some of their highlights are their soups, and wings. Thee handrolls I felt were more rice than filling.   They have great portions. Rolls come in about 4. Everything else comes individually.   Service not the best. They kept forgetting our orders or forgetting things like our water.   The place itself is beautiful. Perfect for date night. There's lots of room to come as a large group."}
{"text":"Love this place! Fresh sushi and great food every time we go.  Their beef tataki is a must try."}
{"text":"Went on a Friday lunch, it was pretty empty. We got our food pretty fast, there were a couple of dishes they did forget but not so much.  The ordering system is different. You are given a book and you write what orders you want down. And then rip the pages off and give that to a server. Wish we had instructions cause we were confused at first.  The decor is really pretty, keeps you occupied while you're waiting for food.   The rolls were really good. Lots of unique items . Loved the mango rolls. There were a good amount of vegetarian options but not so much unique vege options. just the standard avocado and cucumber rolls. They had lots of yummy desserts."}
{"text":"We had the all you can eat Teppanyaki at Matsuda.    Our chef was really entertaining and the food was great!   We made reservations for 13 people for my nieces birthday party,  we arrived on a Saturday night and the place was packed!  It was really disorganized but the hostess came and told us it would be a 10 min wait.    Once seated,  our server got the ball rolling and gave us our options for the all you can eat Teppanyaki.    The food was great!  Very filling, and satisfying.  I just feel so bloated because of all of the soya sauce.   I wish they didn't use so much!   It was really food and I had a lot of fun and so did my family!   Will for sure go back again!"}
{"text":"Came here tonight, I think they over book.   Even with reservations which we showed up 10 minutes early is still 30 min wait for a table.    Things started off okay after that.   They picked up the order sheets really quickly and we were off to our first round.  The sashimi was very fresh tasting, salmon was really nice and temperature was good.   Ordered an udon and unagi fried rice for my baby.  Both were extremely salty.    Tip when ordering sashimi (as you enter the quantity you want), expect to get half the quantity.     As the meal went on (mind you restaurant is packed), things started to be forgotten or left out and of course quantities were always reduced.   Everytime we flagged a waiter to check they would advice us to put in another order.     By the time it was time to order desserts and the order was placed (which they have a boat load of things I wanted to try), all our missed and reordered items (tempura shrimp 2 of the reorders came with in 5 minutes ) arrived.  By then you are already fill after sitting for 20 minutes digesting and no food.     We have a baby so ended up having to tell them to cancel the dessert order as it was taking to long.  I have to give kudos to the girl who is at the front of the house tonight.  This woman does everything.    She was handling the walk-ins, showing ppl to their tables, taking reservation, saw her clearing tables, bringing out people's food.   She looked really busy doing 10 things at once but just kept a great pace all night.  I think I will give this place another time, but hopefully at a slower day.   As this busy day was too much."}
{"text":"Good food but service is questionable.  Their business really cuts corners in a really unethical way.  A lot of the time they 'run out' of the same items that could be considered worth more, serve dessert with plastic spoons that they re-use, and in my most recent visit, one of the managers came over to our table rudely scolding me about charging me double for assuming that I wouldn't be finishing my plate - meanwhile, I'm still half way through our meal, chopsticks in hand, sushi in chopsticks.  They treat their customers with very little respect and as you decide on the amount of tip they deserve (or not), you realize that they include a mandatory service fee.  Come here if you're just looking for a decent AYCE sushi place but be prepared to deal with the rude/lack of service."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service.  I will never return again.  I came here for lunch with my 5 month old baby who was sleeping in a car seat and my mother and we asked for a table of 3.  The server initially seated us at a table that's good for 4 people, which is fine, because I could use the extra seat to support the infant car seat.  After settling down, making sure not to disturb my baby and adjusting the seat so that the car seat was secured; she then asked us to move to another table.  I asked her why? and she said the car seat is taking up too much space.  At this point I was really annoyed as I already lugged the 40lb infant car seat into the restaurant and sat at the table she brought us to and we had already settled down and she had the audacity to ask us to sit at another table.  My breaking point was that the restaurant was NOT BUSY at all, it was not even quarter full on a Friday afternoon.   I'm not about to play musical chairs here.  Obviously the server does not have any common sense or courtesy.  We walked out of the restaurant, because we do not deserve to be treated this way.  I'm sure the food is not even that great, we ended up going to Sushi Legend near the Chartwell shopping Centre.  They are much more accommodating to family and had way better customer service.  So I suggest to others to save your money and go somewhere else where you are welcomed."}
{"text":"Reserved the room for around 50 people after a burial. They are not ready to handle a big crowd. Half our servers didn't speak English and had to complain many times to the manager because the food we ordered kept going to another table. Eventually got the food which is always decent."}
{"text":"Good place for AYCE, food is pretty fresh but line is normally pretty long (30min wait without reservation) during dinner hours  Pretty good place for AYCE, most of the fish are pretty fresh....though if you want speed order the sashimi plater, it has some of everything but it is probably pre cut because it comes right away. We normally get a few platters and then focus on things we love like a entire platter of just salmon sashimi....they also have a beef sashimi but......I personally wouldn't go for it...just in case  the mango rolls here are pretty special, they have a really nice tangy mango sauce of a california roll."}
{"text":"I was here this past weekend for dinner with my cousin. The atmostphere was really nice and appealing. We had made reservations but were a bit early and they accomodated us. The staff were friendly and attentive.   The food was great.  There was a wide variety of selection and they accomodated my preferences.  Service was quick as well.  My favourite part was that they had a wide variety of desserts! They didn't just have ice cream, but jello and different flavours of mousse! Even though there was a line up out the door about half way through our meal, we never felt rushed to leave.   I'm excited to go back. It was worth the money for sure!"}
{"text":"I would definitely give the food here 4 stars but I knocked off a star for this review because I came here last Sunday night with a reservation for 7:30pm and I was finally seated at 8:25pm..  While I'm glad the waitress was apologetic and offered pop on the house, it was still a mistake that made my friends and I have to crowd at the front doors for an hour, and that's not excusable.   For only a few dollars more, I would recommend coming here on a weekend because they offer really delicious scallop, sweet shrimp, and baby cuttlefish! Yum!!"}
{"text":"Price for lunch have changed to $17.99 weekday. Quality of food went down a lot. Matsuda Golden Shrimp used be to very good, cripsy and creamy, but it disappointed me today. I understand it is a all you can eat place and it is very difficult to maintain food quality to be consistent.  Cleaningness: poor. The plates were very dirty/ sticky.   They no longer accept discount card for lunch time.    Therefore I will rate it 2 stars now."}
{"text":"Matsuda offers a wide selection of dishes including some of my favourites, such as torched sushi, beef tataki and scallop sashimi. Although I came on a Friday night, the restaurant was surprisingly not busy.  Service was quick and food came out at a decent pace, but a few orders did get missed. Some of the hot food items are also very good, with the diced beef sirloin being the table's favourite. It was a great experience and I would definitely return."}
{"text":"Ok so I've been here with my family and friends on numerous occasions. Overall the food is great here, especially the sashimi. I've been to many other AYCE Japanese restaurants and by far their sashimi can't be beat.  Dessert menu was great a well. So I give them a 4 star for the food.  What changed the atmosphere was the server, he kept forgetting what we had asked for but in the end we still got what we wanted. Maybe they had less staff tonight, maybe he's a fairly new at his job, maybe there was a mix up with the orders.... Regardless of any of my maybes...expect and know that you'll be there for at least a few hours, bring your patience, bring good company and just enjoy it!"}
{"text":"Service is prompt and courteous, raw food is alright for AYCE, however cooked food is better than your standard AYCE, must try the sirloin roll and sirloin steak I always double up every time I order it. The rolls are pretty standard but I think thier cooked food is worth a try. The beef sukiyaki is pretty tasty and it's worth trying. Be aware that you have a designated server when you want to order food, everyone else will be either running your food or clearing off your table. Again service is very polite as long as you are polite to them. OH YES, for dessert the Mango Yogurt is the only thing you need to order, thank me later"}
{"text":"So nearly nothing stuck out about our meal here.   I came with my family to celebrate some birthdays, but few things actually stuck out. What this spot seemed to do well in was their cooked foods. The skewers were actually pretty great, but the sushi was a bit disappointing. The only sushi thing I really liked was the beef sashimi.  We likely won't be returning."}
{"text":"Honestly, it wasn't all that bad. Despite all the negative reviews, it is only bad because of the bit*y workers. They were rude but the food made up for it.  A lot of choices , a lot more compared to Osaka. The highlight was the beef tataki, salmon sashimi, sweet shrimp, the flounder, and the creme Brule. The rice/fried rice bowls were the perfect 2 bite portions as well.   29.99$ a person  Came on Sunday at 6 for a table for 5 and it was pretty empty. It got very busy by 7 but there was still no lineup, people were going straight in."}
{"text":"Came here with a group of 5... ordered 20 of each fish.. gave us like 5 .. lol. Takes years to get the waitress' attention and when u finally do, they go like \"hold on\" and completely forget about you. The fish isnt fresh (its frozen which shouldnt be if its a real japanese restaurant). Nothing special.. dessert was literally cups of whipped cream with oreo crumbs or other toppings.. even the salmon rose was skimpy compared to the one at ten ichi.. and it tasted better there as well.  Bad service overall. Food was meh. And price is $26.99 on weekends.  Edit: ive eaten at many other ayce restaurants and authentic jap restaurants dt where they actually speak japanese and not chinese..  and if we were to compare, matsuda is lacking in quality by folds..."}
{"text":"Growing up I've gotten very much used to \"slow\" service from Chinese ran businesses as its almost a high standard to be \"slow\"..  Basing my review solely on AYCE standard Sushi.   I've been to this place probably over a dozen times as the food isn't half bad. I don't really order rolls when I do AYCE as its a waste of space. The fish is decent quality and the cooked food is good too. Not getting into much detail as everyone should know the quality of food when you go to AYCE, I don't come here hoping for Sushi Kaji or JaBistro quality food.   +1 for getting 90% of my order correctly most of the time  +1 for a excellent dessert selection  but -1 for untimely food arrivals."}
{"text":"I have 4 stars not because of service. Service here is a bit slow, they will sometimes forget your order and you'll need to remind them by showing it on the Ipad.   But I will say, the reason for giving 4 stars is because of the selection of sashimi. Not only do they have the regular salmon, tuna and surf clam. But they also have herring and mackerel which is difficult to find at most ayce sushi places.   The desserts could use a bit of work. I enjoy the mango Sago that Ichiban or Yokohama have so if they could replicate what they have  I would be more happy!"}
{"text":"$27.99/person weekday. One of the better AYCE in the area.  - Good stuff: tataki, sashimi (especially the stuff on weekends only), beef skewers, mango roll, golden shrimp, salmon roses, sirloin steak, mango yogurt  - Torched sushi - OK (not outstanding)  - Pressed sushi - meh (rice too soft and warm, fish to rice ratio not good) - Sashimi - Good (fresh but thickness of slices are inconsistent) - Better selection of cooked food than other AYCE - Cold soba noodles is neat to try but taste-wise was OK - Desserts are average tasting but a wider selection than other AYCE (except their mango yogurt which is outstanding compared to others)  On average, the service was good but some stuff came out slower than others. Can get very busy. Will continue visiting Matsuda :)"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE SEVICE. They kept bringing us the wrong food or the wrong quantity. I'm still waiting on 4 pieces of dragon roll after an hour and 10mins and 2 reminders. It's not even the weekend! The food is just on par with the price. Nothing amazing."}
{"text":"It's my first time here and honestly I didn't have high hopes for this place. There has been so many AYCE sushi places out there that is really not worth your money. The moment I stepped in, its nice! And packed with people.... Good thing we made RSVP! there was no wait for us. We quickly ordered our food, there is quite a selection! Which really surprised me, they had their own version of sushi rolls and they actually had authentic cold soba with the egg. It was yum!   The food quality is really good,and the portions is about right. The food came pretty quick too.  The only complain I have about this place is that they need more waiters taking our order. I had to flag them for a few minutes before they would come to our table    I would definitely come back here."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the food here, as did my dinner companions. We did AYCE. The only thing was I arrived first of the three of us, and because I was unsure if we would be doing AYCE or a la carte, I had to wait to be seated (until the decision was made). After the second person joined me, and we had made a decision, we were seated, while we awaited our third companion.  We found the AYCE menu to be extensive, including many dessert items beyond the standard ice cream scoops. Of course, this place is a bit on the pricey side, esp for dinner, so it makes sense that there are so many options. All of the food we ate was fresh, enjoyable, and worth the price.  The reason this place gets 3 stars instead of 4/5 is for service. We were ignored for quite some time before being able to give our orders, or add to them, throughout the dinner. It also took an incredibly long time for us to get the bill. Essentially we had all gotten dressed in our various outerwear and were sitting there waiting for the bill to be brought to us. I can understand that the restaurant is busy, but it seemed like everyone else was getting the appropriate service and we were just being ignored. I think we could have easily walked out without paying, that's how bad it was.  I would like to go back, but unless the service improves, I don't think it's a must visit venue."}
{"text":"This place is OK. Was really surprised that they charged for my 1 year old. Food is decent and service was OK. Parking is definitely not convenient. Space wise on the inside was OK. Would probably come if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"This is amongst the pinnacle if not the finest on my listing of to Japanese AYCE style dining.   PRO:  Versatile Menu with lots of items to choose from (top quality dishes in every category) Sashimi Is very fresh (Always Ice Cold when served)   Very comforting Japanese style dining atmosphere  (Air, Seating,  Lightings, Restrooms)   CONS:  Price, the premium comes with top quality food and service, definitely earned its right to charge  the premium over other J-AYCE  Wait Time, whether it is for a seat or for your food it does take a while, overall its definitely worth the wait  I have eaten at enough places to confidently say that Matsuda is worth the trip and highly recommend! 5 Stars :)"}
{"text":"Food was good.  The waitresses were nice enough, but really speedy unlike the delivery of food. Me and three of my friends went on a Friday lunch AYCE and we stayed for three hours. Because we were waiting for our dishes to come. We had to remind the waitresses several times for our orders. Longest time we waited was 30 - 40 minutes without any food arriving. Other dishes came one by one with intervals of 10 to 20 minutes."}
{"text":"This place does all you can eat sushi and teppanyaki table.  So far I've only tried AYCE sushi and this is as good as it gets with AYCE sushi. They have premium dishes (things you wouldn't normally find at other AYCE) but that also means it comes with a premium price tag. With that being said I would still recommend this place.   Service is also good. Never had a problem."}
{"text":"Went for dinner on a Wednesday night and I was pleasantly surprised. The food was good and service was also good. Few items near the end of the meal was a bit slow to arrive (by this time the restaurant was full) but everything else came fast. One thing I think they can improve on is making the cooked food arrive hot. Warm food...doesn't cut it for me. I also really liked their drink selection. Fresh fruit juices and sherly temples sound tempting and I will definitely try them next time I go.  If you pay cash there is a discount so don't forget to bring cash.  I will definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"Ambiance/decor-2 Service-0 Food-1 Strikeouts-2/3  Strike-out #1. Let me start off my saying that we had to wait at least 30 minutes before a hostess finally came to ask us for how many people to be seated. She took the number of seats of the table for a table of 6 and told us \"15 minutes\". Little did we know that \"15 minutes\" turned into just under 45 minutes. We were not impressed.   Strike-out #2. They added 15% tip on top of the bill before asking. Tipping the waiter was confusing.They also have the option to ask for more tip with the card machine, when using a credit card or debit to pay. There was not a, 'no tip' option, so I was forced enter $0 or 0% for tip, otherwise I could have accidentally paid tip twice. I hate it when restaurants don't tell the guest that the tip is already added onto the bill. It tricks people to overtip and the service was abysmal.   The decor was mediocre at best since it was newly renovated, but really tipped the score on this was the massive drum in the front. It's nice, but when one little kid starts going bongo crazy on it, you would want to rip your ears off.   The food and sushi rolls and sushi was mediocre. The best thing on the lunch menu was the teriyaki chicken which I kind find of ironic for an all you can eat lunch SUSHI buffet. You definitely do not get what you order in terms of quantity or quality. Usually when you order any of the big rolls, like a green dragon roll you expect something grand. This definitely doesn't make that cut. Not only was it small and tiny, but also only four pieces. Opposed to the typically 8. Some places serve 6, but this was just unacceptable. When I order 15 pieces of sushi, I expect 15. We get 8 pieces instead for 6 people. We went in the afternoon around 3:30pm, so there was not much of a crowd to serve, so I don't get the lack of accuracy is. I had to order my order twice. I hate it when all you can eat restaurants do this to save money. It makes hungry people like myself angry and write negative reviews just because they wanted to save a few dollars.   The person taking our order made up for the one star this restaurant barely deserves since she was battling a war with serving the entire restaurant where everyone else ignored our table or forgot anything we told them if they bothered to stop. I would rather spend money to eat pho 3 times than come back."}
{"text":"Finally got my ayce sushi craving, this location is so much better than their sister location. Service was fantastic, our server was very quick about things, attentive and when we asked about our food she always came back with it. Ordered the fruit punch and it was really good! She even surprised us with a 10% discount!"}
{"text":"First time coming to this Matsuda location and worst experience ever, I normally go to the one on steeles.  The wait wasn't to bad for table of two, waited around 15min but after we got sat it took our server 20min to approach us and take our order (after us asking some employees to get our server). When he finally came to took our order, it took them half a hour to bring us our miso soup and wakame salad.. The table next to us sat after us and got their salad at exact same time as us, after getting fed up we talked to two managers to check on our drinks and rest of our food. After talking to them we finally got our drinks, 45min after we ordered it...  (fresh strawberry juice) As if the wait wasn't bad enough the juice just tasted like super watered down juice, after taking one sip we just told them to take it away. For 6.99 I don't recommend getting it!   After an hour and fifteen min of us ordering and not getting our complete order we just decided to get the bill.. That was probably the fastest thing we got all night! I'm just gonna stick to the steeles location."}
{"text":"This place was good by most ayce standards. A wide variety of kitchen food and desserts are the highlight and appeal of this place.  The layout of the place is a bit confusing as it was difficult to navigate your way to the washroom and back due to the narrow walkway or trying to squeeze yourself in between seats and bustling servers. The kitchen food were well prepared. There's nothing to complain about service either. Food came quick but not as hot as i like it. The sushi selection is also very basic. The desserts was extensive and was actually very good. I would definitely come back if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"It was one of the most busiest AYCE sushi places we've been to. Food was fresh and atmosphere was modern and pleasant.   They offer a wide variety of dishes but the price is very high. I paid over $40 with one soft drink on a weekend day. $28.99 + tax + tip is the  weekend dinner price.   Food wasn't anything special. The quality doesn't meet the true Japanese restaurants.  The rice in sushi was very mushy and too sweet."}
{"text":"Salmon sashimi, herring roe, fish soup, baked avocado, beef wrapped inoki mushroom. This all you can eat place is consistent.   I don't like the baked scallops because of the mashed yam. However, overall both sushi and hot dishes are good!"}
{"text":"The worst sushi I ever had.  It takes too long to get the order and why not have  an iPad to order?  They don't even give a pen to write down the order. The service is way too slow and very unfriendly. I eat sushi at least once every week but I will NEVER go here again"}
{"text":"3.5 stars  Service was actually pretty good! The girl was nice and everything came on time! It was a bit pricey since it was mother's day and the mothers day specials weren't that good.   Food was average, some of the sashimi was very very fresh but some of the cooked stuff was so/so. Still, it was not bad overall. Desserts weren't that great."}
{"text":"Food was surprisingly good tonight.  All you can Tenpanyaki dinner $33.99 pp  Service was really good"}
{"text":"2nd visit to Matsuda for lunch AYCE. Tenichi would have been a good AYCE choice but unfortunately they don't do it for weekday lunch. Matsuda is closer to me so I came back instead.  Was really impressed with the food today and feel bad for not giving them more credits and providing more details.  I really like most of what I ordered today and am very impressed with the quality and care they seem to put into every single item.  What I ordered and really like: ===================================  salmon sushi - though fish is thinly sliced, it's fresh, not half thawed, presented nicely with 'tail' draping over rice, rice is also cooked well, not too hard or mushy  miso soup - light, not too salty, something about it just taste better than other places  mango roll - mango sauce is nice, sweet and refreshing  sunshine roll - love the spicy mayo, not too overpowering  sirloin steak - cooked fresh to order, straight from the grill and arrive hot at your table, cubes of tender, juicy, garlicky goodness, love the small slices of garlic tossed in  beef teriyaki skewer - like the sirloin steak, very tender and juciy, but marinade is sweet  onion rings - tempura style, lightly fried to perfection, onion is thick cut enough so you really get the texture and taste of the onion under the light batter  tempura calamari and tempura zucchini - also lightly battered and fried with care, calamari is tender and not over cooked  Matsuda golden shrimp - very lightly battered and fried to perfection, very plump, juicy, fresh shrimp taste  fried capelins/smelts - nicely fried and not greasy  grilled cuttlefish balls / takoyaki - very good  mango yogurt - light and refreshing, definitely everyone's must have  mango mousse - good flavor, smooth, like eating a good mango mousse cake  durian mousse - like whipped cream with good amount of durian flavor, very nice if you like durian  I'm certain there are lots more well made items on the menu, but that's all my stomach have room for today :)   Then there are a few things that I felt were meh...not so great, nothing special, could have done better: =================================  tiramisu - like bland whipped cream  rainbow roll - average, nothing special like the mango roll or the sunshine roll and doesn't deserve to be a \"chef's recommendation\"   Overall, the food is really good here. Better than what I remembered the first time to be.  However, though service is quick and they rarely mess up on orders at lunch, the tone of the servers aren't so friendly, especially when the place starts getting busy. If only they care about their persona like they do with the food. Guess they figure there's no need to be nice to you since the bill already include tips.  Washroom is very clean.  This place is 5 min from my home and as long as they keep up the quality, it will be my regular AYCE."}
{"text":"TABLE: 4 adults and 2 babies  BABIES: We came here with my 1 year old twins who eat probably about 1.5 rolls each. We had to pay $4 for each of them. I've never encountered this at any AYCE restaurants. Over the phone they told me 4 and under are free.   FOOD:  Best thing I like here are the Golden shrimps. Sashimi was great and fresh. Mackerels were too fishy than normal. Food came out fast and iPads were used. When we came here last year there were no iPads so food came late, service was also horrible. Therefore iPads are a +!  PLASTIC SPOONS: This location must be violating health codes or something because they reuse their plastic disposable spoons! They gave a spoon to us to use for their scallop appetizer and it had lipstick stains all over the back. It was odd at first and we didn't think much of it. Then when they gave us plastic spoons for dessert and they smelled like fish! Disgusting! Some of these spoons fall on the floor and such, they are DISPOSABLE plastic spoons, not reusable.  If you guys didn't want to waste spoons and save on cost, buy reusable ones. You can even get them in alibaba or something.   RECOMMENDATION: One of my family members is friends with the owner of this place and I'm not going to recommend this restaurant again! The other location is better."}
{"text":"Decent. Not bad, not good. But at $20 you can get better lunch. Come here if you are very hungry, and just want to munch on lots of food."}
{"text":"Overall the food was okay however the wait times were ridiculous and the service was poor. Also, they enforced a 15% tip at the end of the meal despite the horrendous service. Each order took around twenty minutes to arrive on a Tuesday evening. Would not recommend if you plan on coming with a group larger than 6. Poor service, with mediocre food.  It's possible I just went at a busy time but the rude service and long wait times are not worth it.   - Poor Service - Long Wait times - Mediocre Food"}
{"text":"I took my fiance here for his birthday. It was a Monday evening and we had their all you can eat sushi. Price-wise, Matsuda is on the higher end compared to other all you can eat places. At $25.99 per person, this location is $1 more than their sister location at Steeles and Middlefield. I was told by the server that this particular location has a larger selection of items. However, the one sushi we raved about at their sister location was missing from their menu (Shoganute or something like that). I inquired about the missing sushi and our server made quite the effort to figure out which one I was talking about.   The decor is modern and nice. This is a newer location, so they put a lot of effort into it with nice lighting and the like. Service is above par for an all you can eat place. I had to ask for water three times before I got it. Otherwise, all our food arrived in a timely manner and our plates were cleared shortly after we pushed them to the side. Servers were friendly and upbeat and I didn't experience any of the terrible service others mentioned on Yelp. However, we were just a table of two and we are easy to please.   In terms of food, this place is much better than a lot of the other all you can eat places. I really liked how they put sashimi on ice to keep it fresh and cool. Let's be honest; warm sashimi is kind of gross. Sushi was well presented on nice, new places and they were fresh and cold. Tempura was served in cute little baskets. Their kimchi seafood stew is delicious, but be warned, there's half a salmon head swimming in there. Garlic sirloin steak is unreal. The deserts are alright here. I found their mousse a little greasy tasting and wasn't a huge fan. Their mango yogurt is very light and refreshing.   Protip: You can totally ask for a side of spicy mayo. Mmm....  I would totally come back here for dinner again!"}
{"text":"I always see my friends posting pictures of their desserts from Matsuda. I finally got to come here with my mom and fiancé. They really enjoyed the salmon and white tuna sashimi. They said it was super fresh and tasty. I enjoyed a lot of the sushi from the chef's favourites section. My favourite was the shoganute sushi, which had some crispy red shavings on top (can't remember what it was). The desserts were good, too. They have a ginger dessert that is exclusive to weekends and my mom said it was really good.  The mango yogurt and mango pudding were my favourite desserts and I found the mousses a little to rich and thick for my liking. They have a durian mousse for those who enjoy the pungent durian flavour. Everything we had was super yummy and our server was very friendly and helpful. Our food arrived in a timely manner and people were always coming by to clear our empty plates. This is definitely one of the best all you can eat sushi places I've been to.   As far as pricing goes, Matsuda is more expensive than the average AYCE sushi place, but you get what you pay for. $25.99 a person on a Sunday night. If you pay with cash, you get 10% off. There is also a 10% service charge on the bill, so it's up to you if you want to tip more, which we did :)"}
{"text":"The food here is tasty and fresh. They offer more options in terms of dishes then most of the surrounding AYCE sushi restaurants in the Markham / Scarborough area. However, the service isn't so great in terms of wait staff interacting with customers as professionalism does not exist in the Asian restaurant industry."}
{"text":"Me and my family loved the tepanyaki. It was a good experience. I know we will be back soon.  Recommended for large groups too."}
{"text":"I am not a huge fan of all you can eat, but I tolerate this place bc of the quality.   Great service, and lots of options. Try out the Taco Wasbi and Beef Tataki! I enjoyed the teppanyaki part more than the sushi options because they have great flavours. Fish, salmon, shrimp, chicken and steak are the options they give you! Quality isn't bad - my fav were shrimp and steak.   They also have a lot of desserts you can try. They come in small portions, so you can try a couple different ones.   Tea is in a thermos on the table, which keeps it hot and accessible!!!! Huge plus, especially with food this salty.   Also, try not to wear your best cashmere here... you don't want it soaking up all the smoke!"}
{"text":"I never really have a good experience at this location. During the handful of times I've been here, I have always received poor service. I prefer the Don Mills location because the menu is slightly different and everything is quicker. The food is never terrible at this location, but the service needs to be MUCH better. They also have a new way of ordering where you are given this little book and each page is a different part of the menu (I.e, appetizers, Maki rolls, sushi etc) and you write the quantity beside whatever you're ordering then rip out the page. It's a poor system when having one big sheet to write on is way more efficient, not to mention, it's more environmentally friendly."}
{"text":"Ate at Matsuda last night for the first time and really enjoyed it.   It's a good space, not too loud, looks nice.   Fairly extensive menu and we got to try many items as we were a big group.   Sashimi was very good Maki rolls weren't the best I've ever had but not bad. To be fair we only tried a couple.  The unagi sushi, though, was UNBELIEVABLE. Wow, so good.  We tried too many things to list but I thought most of them were good. I had recently been to a different AYCE sushi in the city and Matsuda far surpassed it.  Biggest downside is the ordering system. The waitress comes and writes down your order as you read it off. It would be much improved if they had menu cards where you could write down the quantities of each item you'd like and just submit it to the waitress, as many AYCE places do"}
{"text":"I have been frequenting Matsuda for my Japanese AYCE fix for the past two years and it's probably one of the better ones in the Scarborough/Markham and I have tried more or less all of them in the Scarborough/Markham area.  I went this past Friday night ($24.99 per person) and it's probably a good idea to make reservations since it gets really busy Friday and Saturday nights.  Sashimi/Sushi:  The selection of sashimi is small and simple (Salmon, Red Snapper, Surf Clam, White Tuna, Saba and Beef Sashimi). The sashimi is pretty fresh but nothing spectacular but the one item that stood out was the beef sashimi, thinly sliced, very lightly seasoned and great flavour.  The maki rolls were just average. Like any other Japanese AYCE, they also have their own signature rolls.  Grilled Foods:  The grilled food was pretty good, specifically the Korean kalbi ribs which were juicy and flavourful and not overcooked and had a nice char to them. The same thing for the chicken teriyaki. Another item that was done pretty well, was the sirloin steak, nice flavour and seasoning.  Desserts:  Matsuda probably has one of the bigger dessert menus in comparison to it's Scarborough/Markham Japanese AYCE counterpart which is great news if your really into sweets. I don't think the desserts are made in house but probably sourced from an outside company.  The service was pretty average like any other Japanese AYCE restaurant and the food came out in a reasonable time. When you consider how busy they are on a Friday and Saturday night, I think the waiter/waitresses do a reasonable job and because it's a Japanese AYCE restaurant, I don't it would be fair to expect the same level of service you would get at a higher end a la carte restaurant."}
{"text":"This is another great ayce sushi place I visit at least once a month. The biggest selling point is the fact that they actually have little rice with their sushi. I hate how some places have rice that's size of my fist with such a small sushi piece. However, the Entrees here are comparably worse than Sushi Legend (my favourite ayce place)."}
{"text":"The food is really good but the service was terrible. They kept forgetting to bring out some of our orders and claimed their computer system broke down.. probably will only come back on a Mon to Thurs"}
{"text":"We came in with a big group of people for lunch (9) to be honest the service was pretty swift and straight forward and we were able to order fast and get in and get out.  Service was decent, and the food was also pretty good.  The shrimp was amazing, so was the garlic beef all u can eat, the rolls were okay, and the dessert was on point.  All in all a good buffet, however incredible disappointing that you cannot order sashimi of any sorts. they kind of fill you up with fried options, which gets you fill, and they bring out those options first (probably strategically to get you full)...price is also decent. But would have liked to have other options on the buffet menu tat are actually SUSHI (i.e.; sashimi)"}
{"text":"A couple weeks ago, I came to Matsuda for dinner. I won't be back.  I don't think I can visit another AYCE with worse service. They always serve you only half of what you order, pretend to not see you when you're trying to get their attention and the place is just not clean!  2 hours of waiting before any food arrives.   Yes, the food quality is slightly better than other AYCE sushi restaurants. But I live in North York and happy to have sushi legend near me when I want my AYCE sushi  fix.   There's always something dirty in the utensils they serve in.  My submitted photo already made the lipstick stain less obvious... No thank you!"}
{"text":"This is very enjoyable, it is comparable to Ten-ichi.  PRO: Sashimi is fresh and delicious.  There's a good variety of selections to choose from. Not as packed as Ten-ichi  CON: service is a bit slow. We had to keep reordering sashimi because they kept forgetting our orders...but they were fast on refilling our tea cups!  New family favorite for sushi buffet :)"}
{"text":"I love AYCE places, and this was a really cool one located in between Scarborough and Markham. My accompanying friend had a few favourites, which were also things I liked to eat when I went to Asian AYCE places. We went at lunchtime. The sirloin steak was AMAZING. My goodness. So were all the deep fried items, the sushi, and they had a curry dish that was not spicy but tasted and felt like actual indian curry, it was such a weird feeling. The decor was very nice, until you look up and realize the top is warehouse-like. Service is slow, but for such a large AYCE restaurant, it's understandable.  Sometimes my friend and I were waiting for a long time for food, but luckily we are both chatterboxes and the wait time flew by.   NOTE - The restaurant will charge you a tip, on top of the lunch AYCE price. Definately coming again to try more food."}
{"text":"Matsuda is a safe option when you don't know where to go. This is one of those AYCE places you go to when you have cravings and want lots of sushi. Quantity over quality. Make a reservation if you want to come on a weekend.   Most of the stuff on the AYCE menu isn't too bad. Recommended dish is the sirloin steak with garlic, available for both lunch and dinner. If you want maki/rolls I generally love the spicy salmon and salmon roses. They don't have alot of rice in them compared to other places, which means it won't fill you up as much.  They have a long list of desserts available. The mousse is just flavoured whipped cream with food colouring. Still a guilty pleasure though."}
{"text":"Why oh why did I agree to come here again?  Ok food....but you're going to be waiting.  So clear your calander folks. They cut back on a lot in the past year. The staff seemed to be almost pissed off that you're here. The old \"toss n leave, avoid eye contact \" trick.   I've been trying to flag down someone for the bill for a while now. If I was a terrible person there would be nothing stopping me from literally walking out the door right now. I can't even choose my own tip because it's not automatically added to the bill.   Avoid going 2 hours before close....because they will turn you away, as we have been twice. It wasnt even full or on a weekend.  Someone I'm close with likes it here, so I join them when they asked. But if it wasn't for them I wouldn't dare."}
{"text":"Very fresh sashimi and very good tepanaki. The service is excellent. The server ensure we were fed before they cooked the tepanaki. Will come back again."}
{"text":"I enjoy Matsuda and it is conveniently located on Steeles close to my home.  We would likely go more often but the service can be downright pathetic.  I feel scammed sometimes being charged a service fee to get ignored and end up with the wrong quantity of food ordered.    The matsuda golden shrimp are to die for,  and they do have good quality rolls.  Try and go when it's not busy and you will likely have a positive experience."}
{"text":"Excellent all you can eat food. I come here quite often, the sashimi, chicken and beef skewers, mango yogurt, mango rolls are their specialty!! Each of the portions are small, so you are able to try as many items as tou can without wasting much food.  There are one to two designated servers who mark down which foods you would like to have. Remember to make reservations as this place begins to get busy around 7 to 8. When you feel really full, there's a park or t&t within walking distance! Food comes fairly quick, would come here again!"}
{"text":"I came here for the very first time with D and a group of friends for dinner. I have to say, I haven't had all you can eat Japanese for a while. SIDE NOTE: Highly recommend that you make reservations.   To start off, don't expect good service. I gave this place a four star purely because of the food. The service here is like any other all you can eat places across GTA - the servers are always in a hurry regardless of what you are asking the server to do for you. So typically, when I go to any all you can eat places or buffet places, I don't really expect a high level of service.   The food quality of the sashimi and food in general is so much better than a lot of all you eat places that I have been to. I like how this place has a few items that most all you can eat Japanese places don't have. I really like the steam egg. It was really good. They also have a pretty good list for deserts too. This is the only all you can eat place that I've been that offers steam ginger milk for desert. It was really good - very heavy in the ginger flavor.   I would definitely come back for more. Next time I come, I think I will try a weeknight."}
{"text":"Only come here cause it's close and their golden fried shrimp is delicious. Everything would be great if it didn't smell like a swimming pool inside."}
{"text":"Not a bad place  Went several times to the Scarborough location so this was a change  Bigger and they have teppan tables to dine at.....  Menu is also better as they have more variety at the teppan table than others  The duck steak is delish  Sushi isn't bad Can be a bit on the salty side  Overall great experience and will definitely come again"}
{"text":"The Sushi here is prolly the best in Scarbro/Markham area.   The size of the rolls are generally pretty good. it taste fresh and healthy! They have lots of sushi options. The restaurant is quite new..its LARGE. Probably one of the largest sushi places I have seen lol its nicely decorated and they have booths, group seatings, double and singles. Take out is kindof slow tho, so instead of trying to get the sushi to go...might aswell stay there and eat. The dining service is quicker lol"}
{"text":"I've been here twice now, once for sushi, and today for teppanyaki. Both times, service has been sub par. Sushi is good. There's a lot of variety but the price is pretty expensive compared to other AYCE. I was pretty disappointed today about the teppanyaki. They didn't do a show, they literally set some oil on fire and that's about it. The chef just cooked our food and left right away. Not what I'm use to seeing at other teppanyaki places. I don't think I would come back here."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Sat at the tepanyiuki table with a group of friends.  It took us over an hour to get some sushi while our whole group was on there third orders. They forgot most of our order and gave us the wrong quantities of what we wanted. They were rude and made us change seats during our meal. It was also freezing there to top it off. At the end of a terrible experience they handed me a bill with 15% tip included. I ended up giving them less and told them that's all they are getting.  I will never set foot in this place again. If it wasn't our friends birthday, I would have got up and left."}
{"text":"$15 for all-u-can-eat buffet lunch. Problem is that the food was so slow and boring that there was nothing we wanted to eat.   Service was so slow that we didn't even remember what we ordered. Can't understand why they didn't let us just fill in a order sheet and had us flag down a waitress instead.  Mandatory tipping even if you order take-out."}
{"text":"A la carte lunch:  Price to portion and taste ratio poor. Prices for lunches started at $7.99 (curry pork cutlet with rice, terriyaki chicken with rice. both come with miso soup only). Bentos are $10+.  Had the curry pork cutlet with rice and the grilled eggplant appetizer.  Miso soup: nothing special.  Pork cutlet: crispy but bland.  Curry: NOT Japanese curry. Japanese curry tends to be mild, spice wise, and slightly sweet. This was strong, spice-wise and not at all sweet.  Eggplant: I have no idea whether it was grilled or not. They peeled the skin off of it. All that was left was the insides, which were cooked to mush. The dipping sauce that usually accompanies grilled eggplant is sticky and sweet. This was just soy sauce.  At these prices, I'd rather go to spoon and fork 5 minutes away. They have $12 set lunches (sashimi even, and very fresh at that) which include soup, daily salad and daily appetizer."}
{"text":"I been a customer here since 2nd day when they opened and I've been coming to this restaurant at least once every month.  I am still sitting at this restaurant writting this review because I am very disappointed.  It takes us 10min just to talk to the hostess and orders that we ordered is either missing or forgotten. I have to wait at least 10 min for a server to come to our table.  As a chef myself I understand kitchen can be busy and the delays on food I understand. But purposely giving less and for horrible service, I don't thinnk I am coming back here anymore. Good luck with your business."}
{"text":"Went in expecting to satisfy my sushi craving but ended up waiting 45 minutes at the front. My girlfriend had made a reservation for 7pm and we sat at our table at 7:50pm. The staff seemed stressed, there was a huge mob of people waiting, no idea who is in front of who.    When we got to our table it was paired with another couple which was fine. But the wait time for the food was so long it became annoying as I was starving. Staff was no where to be found. The food was good but service was slacking, I was very disappointed to say the least. To make matters worse it was highly priced from what I can remember over $25"}
{"text":"I heard from friends that this place is pretty good.   Food was decent. Proportions of rice to topping was fine.   However. As a Chinese person living with a Chinese family, we always wipe down our dishes and utensils even when they're already on the table.   The white napkin was brown after I wiped the inside of the cup and soy sauce dish.   Nuff said. Bye."}
{"text":"It takes so long to wait for my food They even cancel the order on their end. I wait 20 mins then check with the waiter, he said they just start making it  it. They just ignore your order.  it isn't busy at all. It seems they don't car about their customer."}
{"text":"Line up and it was very busy for Friday dinner but were waiting to be called. We placed 1st order and they missed my shrimp tempura, we called the supervisor and confirmed that it will served shortly, we got the 2nd orders but our shrimp tempura not arrived yet..we ordered our miso soup and garden salad still not arrived..called the supervisor and confirms that the food on the way..3rd order placed..dessert and served right away but still not served our soup, salad and shrimp tempura and we reminded and worst to worst they served it after we finished our dessert. We expense $72.+ for two plus tip.. food was great but service is poor. They should put more server during busy dinner."}
{"text":"Good place for a Japanese buffet. Just some waitress get confuse and bring orders from different table but is not a huge problem cause when I was there was really packed. Anyways. Very tasteful and really good sashimi."}
{"text":"I've gone to Matsuda maybe about 10 times in the last two years and I've never been disappointed.  It's simply the best AYCE sushi in Scarborough.  The food itself is great for all-you-can-eat.  The rolls are great and the mango roll is probably my favourite food of all time.  There's a great variety of food for lunch and an even bigger one for dinner.  The service is so-so, especially during dinner.  Food comes 10-20 minutes after ordering which isn't bad, but the staff messes up an order at least once every time I come here.  I recommend coming right when lunch starts; you will have amazing service.    The atmosphere is nice, but as with all AYCE establishments, it can get very loud and is often full.  Again, coming during early lunch/dinner is what's best.  Overall, Matsuda offers great food at an amazing price.  This is my favourite sushi spot in my area and I'm sure it will be for a long time."}
{"text":"Service- 5, servers are really active and nice  Food- 1, sashimi really does not taste or look fresh. All dish/pieces are really small, portions are like those supermarket tasting portion. I understand AYCE that you can order as many as you want, but those small pieces just turned down my eating experience. The steamed egg was my favorite.   Price- 2, price is ok, avg ayce price. The they count the tips in bill already without telling you. We forgot to read the bill and double tiped."}
{"text":"Very bad experience. Was happy in the past, but this time, they ruin our friend's and baby gathering!! When we book the table, we have been told that the toddler who is 3yrs old or under is $3 for the lunch buffet. But end up they charge us $8.99!!! And the manager pointing her finger to my friend said that she hear it wrong in the phone!!! They said if the toddle is 3.5 yrs old then they are no longer count as 3yrs old, what??!!....that non sense!!! This is not the money issue, as if u told us clearly at the first place, we can choose not to come to this restaurant , as other ayce are charging $2-3 for a toddle who is 3 or under.  This is a scam and very bad / poor customer service. When we ordering the desert, they said we only can order it once , as they were short in man power!! What?! ....then told me earlier, and we will find another place to have our gathering!!!"}
{"text":"Omg yum! This is our go-to sushi place. Reasonably priced, consistent with the portions, flavours and fast and friendly service."}
{"text":"Came here for my niece's birthday dinner. Interior decor is nice though being senior I found the light levels a bit low for reading the menu.  Let's face it. After you've been to dozens of 'sushi' places they're all pretty much the same. They usually stand out only if they're terrible.  Fortunately this isn't the case at Matsuda. We had a variety of sushi dishes. Sashimi was particularly fresh. Not a wide variety of selection but salmon, snapper, mackerel, tuna, surf clam were all good. Sushi rolls, beef rolls and skewers, tempura, grilled shrimp were all good. Deserts, in particular the mango yogurt, was a perfect finish to the meal.   Service was also good for an ayce. Establishment clean.   This is my first visit so 3 1/2 stars. Will be upgraded to 4-stars if they maintain the same quality over time. Hopefully they will."}
{"text":"Not really a fan of this place, the service is terrible and the food is just alright. Instead of dealing with allergies they just tell us to order something else...most restaurants are quite accommodative so I'm not sure where they are going with that attitude. Their decor is stunning though so that's where I'm giving them two stars. We ordered off the discounted lunch menu and the prices were still quite high for the bentos. I would much rather visit another joint at the Yonge & Sheppard area."}
{"text":"I come here all the time with my girlfriend.  The sushi is consistently good and there's a wide variety.  I also like the decor - it's very spacious and it's cleaner than the ave average sushi AYCE."}
{"text":"Horrible service, the hostess was a complete wreck with the worst attitude ever. The food is terrible with the sushi falling apart and fish wasn't even thawed. Everything is fried to all hell. I saw them drop the food, pick it back up, and serve it to a table. To top it off, they charged tip on one receipt and provided me with a different receipt when I told them I needed a copy. Avoid if you don't want shitty food and high prices."}
{"text":"The service here is God awful. Servers don't care, are not attentive, and are very very slow. They tend to forget things all the time too. The food is quite decent for ayce standards. The menu has quite a large selection of different items. They either need to reduce pricing to fit the horrible service, or hire new front of house staff."}
{"text":"Place had nice decor and food was decent. Food took forever to arrive... normally at these restaurants the seating limit is 1.5-2 hours but because we didn't get any food for the first 45mins-1 hour we were there for over 3 hours. The restaurant was clearly understaffed with unoccupied tables of dirty dishes piling up and food took long to get to our table. When dessert came they actually didn't have enough clean spoons so the hostess/manager actually asked us to used a spoon we already had on our table that was used for another dish and just wipe it. 2 stars for decor/cleanliness/food quality everything else is a no no."}
{"text":"Great value. We had all you can eat teppanyaki, sashimi and dessert.  The food tasted delicious. The teppanyaki provided great entertainment for my 6 year old. He couldn't stop laughing and he ate everything that was put in front of him. The only downside is that the service is a bit slow. Would come back again."}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant many times, and I was originally expecting to give this restaurant at least a 3 star rating, but this experience proves me otherwise.  This is a restaurant that was great for AYCE sushi. They have a wide variety of selections, ranging from sushi to BBQ ribs. I particularly liked their salmon sashimi: the texture is very smooth to chew with just the right amount of softness and they give them in thick slices which is always a plus.   Today we went for lunch, and I got a sushi and sashimi bento box. It comes along with a garden salad and a mango pudding. The salmon sashimi, as stated above, is great. The mango pudding was actually a nice easy-on-the-stomach little dessert after the huge carbs meal of sushi.   But the reason I gave this restaurant an overall rating of 2 stars is because of its sub-par service. We went at around 2pm, so some of it might be due to the late lunch timing, but even considering the context, this should not happen at any time: As we were in the middle of our meals, we were asked if they could give us the bill. Then they gave us our desserts right away. In addition to that, they turned off the lights above us, so we had to eat in the dark. If you think we might be cutting it late, just close the doors at 1:30, we would understand that.   In summary, it is still a good deal for its AYCE sushi. Just be prepared when you come across service that might ruin the overall experience."}
{"text":"My last visit here was disappointing. Overall, the food was only okay. The quality of some of the ingredients seems to have declined since my visit here about a year ago. The fish in the sushi rolls tasted pretty fresh, but the rice seemed a bit dry and old.. this effectively ruined a lot of the specialty rolls for me. The sashimi was very good (especially the salmon and clam), but I wish we had the option to order eel by itself. I also enjoyed the beef tataki.   The cooked foods were either hit or miss for the most part. The kalbi was pretty good, and we ended up ordering that a few times. It isn't the highest quality short rib, but they do get a nice char on the meat. I also really like their kimchi seafood hot pot. The broth is delicious with just the right amount of spice. The one complaint I have about this is that they put way too much inedible crap in there (like fish tail).. I'd rather have more soup and less of that stuff. The fried pork chop was probably the worst thing we received during dinner. It was thin, tough, and bland.. just about the worst fried pork chop I've had in a long time. I didn't bother eating any more after trying a bite.   I really like the way they do desserts here. The servings are very small (shotglass size), so you can try a lot of different things. My favorite dessert was the lychee mousse.. I should've ordered 5 of those. All of the desserts I tried were pretty good except for the strawberry ice cream. The strawberry ice cream tasted really artificial (almost like medicine).  The service was just awful. The servers got something wrong pretty much every time we ordered food. We had to order a few items multiple times to receive it once. We had to wait an absurd amount of time to receive the second half of our ramen order. There seems to be something that is causing a lot of miscommunication at some point in the ordering/food preparation/delivery process. They really need to figure out what the root cause is and fix it because it was happening WAY too often in our dinner. Our table also had a lot of issues flagging down servers even when it was getting late and less crowded. Our dinner must've taken about 2.5-3 hours because of how slow they were. The prices were reasonable for AYCE, but I don't know if I would be willing to come back and deal with the service again. 2.5/5"}
{"text":"The sushi is mediocre and the service is poor, even by ayce standards. Flagging down a staff member to order is impossible u less you wave your hands like an imbecile. At least 7  ppl walked by obliviously. The don't get paid enough to care.  If the food was above average i would give it 3 stars but unfortunately it is not. I can go to better ayce  places with better quality  food and the same shitty service.  Warning: they cut order qty in half as portion control. Your order 6  they give you 3. You order 4 and you get 2. Another thing is that the teapot lids are loose as hell and have some sort of crappie cable that doesn't even hold it on. Therefore if you pour the tea you run the risk of the lid falling off and getting hot tea all over yourself :/"}
{"text":"Matsuda was definitely an experience.  Our friend and real estate agent decided to take us out for dinner Saturday evening to this place.  Keep in mind there are two locations, one in North York and Markham. Though parking in the front of this building can be a pain, there's plenty more spaces towards the back. Inside, Matsuda definitely feels like you've stepped into a Japanese restaurant. The ambiance, fixtures, gigantic drum in the front is appealing to the eyes.  The service, almost reminds me of Mandarin, lol...it perfection, the servers are extremely polite and provide a lot of recommendations for first-time-visitors.  Presentation.....completely blew me away, Matsuda takes pride not just in presentation, but the quality of foods their serving to its clients.  Like most place, where they'd try and stuff as much rice into hand rolls/ makis/ sushis, Matsuda doesn't do that.  Everything seems fresh and they've got a lot to offer for AYCE including their desserts :) most notably their Creme brulee & ginger milk that's only available on weekends.   The place can get expensive, however quality and overall experience is key. :)"}
{"text":"Slow slow slow service.   Literally everything you order will come as one piece of something.  Even if there's 20 of you.  Servers and people who deliver food to the table don't speak English and have a hard time hearing you if you're speaking English.  All in all there are better restaurants that serve all the same dishes and while all the food was tasty, they took way too long to come out and I felt I didn't get money's worth."}
{"text":"So far the best all-you can-eat sushi buffet. Only in comparison to places in the Greater Boston area. The waitress was great and extremely helpful. We told her it was our first time here and she took care of all our sushi needs. The salmon sashimi was our favorite. Each one was sliced in a substantial size. No stingy slices at all, which you tend to see in other sushi buffets. The desserts were not bad. Their desserts are in smaller portions than we're used to. However, if you have to get something, get the strawberry ice cream!"}
{"text":"I called up to make a reservation but the phone just kept on ringing so I gave up. I told myself I'll just wait there and take my chances. But what do you know Matsuda called me up saying they missed my call the first time - good sign for service. But I spoke too soon re good service.  When I got there, the place was jam-packed which was surprising because you'll never know the place is full to the brim until you get inside (what do you expect it's the long weekend). They gave me a 745 pm reservation but we came in early so I waited for my reserved time before following-up. We got seated a few minutes later. Not bad.  Pros: - more matcha in their green tea ice cream - strawberry ice cream - real strawberries - there's a person for every order you have - which means, somebody will come and she's just carrying all sashimi food items, then another will come carrying all teriyaki stuff... so your order will not come all at once.  CONS: - if you raise your hand to get the attention of the waiter/s, they will not look at you. they are 'experts' in avoiding your gaze. my son was feeling bad and just wanted a glass of water. we had to ask several times, but to no avail. i had to go to the nearest convenience store to get him a bottle and when I got back the water we requested for our table is still not there.  so I had to call the manager's attention. they had the excuse about the computer not working but hello - it's just water. we're not asking for much. the manager had the courtesy of saying that the drinks were on the house. and after that the attention from the waiters improved to the point of annoyance.  I came here because it was recommended to me. It's expensive, there's no a la carte choice which is rather limiting since my son doesn't eat much - not worth it for him. There's nothing here that you will not find elsewhere and maybe even nearer to you (for us Tenichi is nearer).  If you are with your friends and you would be busy gabbing/tinkering your phone then you wouldn't notice the bad service too much then I guess you will be fine because for small parties they have private rooms not found in other Japanese AYCE in Scarborough.  I won't be back - it's a been-there-done-that deal for me and Matsuda."}
{"text":"I went here with some friends for lunch and considering the fact that it's an AYCE restaurant, I have to say the food was pretty good, but the service was just okay. If you go, make sure to order the mango sushi rolls and beef skewers. Be careful of the sushi pizza because it's either a hit or a miss, the first time we ordered it was okay but the second time it tasted oddly sweet/sugary. Also be careful if you order ramen because it tastes just like making instant noodles at home ((except more bland)).  I found that the ordering process was very confusing. If you don't specify how many sushi rolls or (for example) pieces of sushi pizza you want, they only give you one. The menu doesn't say how many pieces come with your order, so you would assume that they'll give you a bunch ... but no. You have to tell them exactly how many pieces you want.  We also found that the kitchen would get our orders mixed up sometimes and not give us enough of something and we would have to request more."}
{"text":"Came here for the second time. Would only go back during lunch. I find that the dinner price for someone like me that can't eat too much is too pricey. I do enjoy this place for ayce though. It has a lot of different options. I still have yet to go try the teppanyaki. Overall 4 stars for service speed and food quality."}
{"text":"I tend to come here for AYCE sushi. It's always fresh and delicious! On Fri/Sat/Sun, they have fresh scallops and steamed egg!  We generally come here because of these 2 items and their fish head soup, which is a bowl of delicious, fragrant broth. I salivate just thinking about it. Of course, they offer the typical Japanese AYCE fare, such as a wide variety of sashimi (dinner), nigiri, maki, hand rolls, grilled items, desserts, etc.  Their beef tataki is worth noting to be above average. Some places are still icy from being frozen.  Parking is free in the plaza and it's a huge lot, though it can get really busy due to the opening of a new supermarket where the old T&T used to be before it closed down.  Before you ask...Yes, this Matsuda is better than their other location on Don Mills."}
{"text":"Walked in here for the first time with my girlfriend thinking it would be good, but it took us forever to get seated then when we did get seated we had a small dinky table which hardly fit any food. However, in our case we did not even get much of the food we ordered.. We did not order much but at least 50% of the food was not delivered and we had to ask two times before we were actually heard. Even when we were heard it took another 20 minutes for the food to come. By that time we were sitting, not eating anything and getting full. What's weird is that the table beside us had such quick service and they got food before us even when they ordered AFTER us.. Their table had 3 adults and 1 kid. No matter the party size,  I think all service should be equal and no one should be neglected or ignored. I would not recommend eating here nor will I be coming back ever again even if someone wanted to pay me(that's how bad the service is) , what's even worse is that they will autograt your bill for that terrible service."}
{"text":"I've been going to this sushi joint ever since it's opened! The staff is super friendly (they always welcome me back cause they notice frequent customers), and their food quality is great! Their menu offers everything you need to satisfy your japanese food cravings. I've gone to the Steeles location before, and it was terrible compared to this place, and they offer the exact same menus. This place definitely gets busy during lunch and dinner time and any day of the week (especially weekends) so expect that there might be a little bit of a wait time for the food. You do however, get greeted and seated right away which is good. But since I go back every time, I'd definitely say it's worth the wait! Make sure to try all their 'chef recommendation' rolls, spicy salmon maki roll, and an order of their sirloin steak!"}
{"text":"Service was horribly slow, wait staff ignored our tables several attempts at flagging them down to replace an empty bottle of soya sauce before we even received food. Multiple orders missed even after re-ordering... Saving grace is the selection at this AYCE, however regardless of the selection, there is no point in even ordering the multitude of items available on the menu as you probably wont find your ordered item on your table(even by the end of the night). Service however changed promptly in the several minutes shortly after we asked for the bill - how convenient!"}
{"text":"Matsuda has a dim light setting inside the restaurant. The decor and set up was pretty nice. They also have a private seating area with bigger tables which is more suitable for bigger parties and groups.   For an AYCE, the menu selection is not that big. At least sushi wise, there wasn't too big of a variety to choose from. Portions are very small and cute if you like that. All of the chef specials were pretty good, so I would highly recommend those. Those include the mango, volcano, sunshine and green dragon rolls. Other appetizers and dishes are decent. Their salad dressing is a peanut sauce, which, if you don't like things too savoury, it might not be your best bet.   Also, if you are going with kids or in general, beware of the unagi (eel) roll/sushi! I, myself don't do well with bones in my food. I almost shocked on my sushi. I know in some places there may be super tiny bone(s) left in the piece of meat, but it was still do-able. There was a LOT! of bones in these ones. They were long and a little hard. Had to even hand pick them out before eating. Tried voicing our opinions/comments to the restaurant but how they explained it was that, there's always bones in eels and they are hard to handle, so we just have to be careful and deal with it. Well..if they said so. I've ate sushi a lot and that never happened so...whatever you said!  I went to Markham/Scarborough location and remembered that their mousse shots were really good! So I was very excited for them here. Tried one of each at this location and not sure if its because it was a while ago, they don't taste the same. Instead of having a more fluffy texture to them, it felt very thick, like a blob of cream. Flavour wise, they are pretty artificial. My favourite was the chocolate custard cream pudding. BUT! Be sure to stir it up before you eat it! Otherwise, it really would be a blob of cream!"}
{"text":"Been here several times for AYCE lunch and dinner. I would say it is one of the better ayce Japanese restaurants. Everything is consistent and fresh. There's a wide variety of food and (almost) everything arrives (depending on how busy they are). However, there are times that they miss some orders which can get annoying if they miss it more than once. The restaurant gets full fast so you should make reservations. They close from 3-5pm to prepare for dinner."}
{"text":"Food is good, service was ok, the desserts were amazing!  But I'm not happy about the extra $2 charge on top of the weekend price per person because we went on a \"Hallmark\" holiday and it wasn't even a statutory holiday!  Bleh!"}
{"text":"Writing this as I am here right now. Other reviews were not kidding. While service (the temperament of the servers) is decent, the food takes eons to arrive. Literally, eons. We have watched other tables receive countless orders while we wait. Maybe a break in the chain?   Quality is fine. Good selection."}
{"text":"AYCE Japanese Restaurant. This place replaced Tako Sushi. Renovations are very nice.  Dinner Weekend: $34, Weekday $30 They have some items only served on weekends which is worth the extra $4.  update: This is my go-to place now for AYCE. Service is extremely fast now even when the place is packed. This might because they changed to iPad ordering."}
{"text":"Food took way too long to come, around 10-15 mins after placing each order. Ice cream took around 15 mins to come as well... Would definitely not recommend."}
{"text":"So I'm not one to write reviews but after seeing a 3 star rating at this place I gotta put in my two cents. Been coming here for over 2 years and it seems to just get better and better. Service is amazing and staff is always smiling unlike other sushi places. Food tastes fresh and full of flavour. Lunch or dinner, busy or empty, this place never lets us down. Mango rose and green dragon sushi with Jumbo tiger shrimp and sirloin steak all day. Don't forget the vanilla ice cream with fried banana for dessert!"}
{"text":"OMG they must have changed the owner or chef or something.  It used to be our go to AYCE sushi buffet and I recommended  all the times to my friends. I came back here after few months, the taste is different, the service is bad. They have more choices than before but the taste is worst than I can remember. The sashimi are so thin!!! Definitely not coming back and lots of customers complained  about the wait time for food. NOT RECOMMENDED AT ALL!!!!"}
{"text":"Matsuda Japanese cuisine offers an option where you can get both teppanyaki and sushi. The sushi quality is great, and they have a bunch of variety. For the teppanyaki, they make all the dishes for the first round, so don't order too much sushi! Afterwards, you can order specific types of dishes for the teppanyaki. The service isn't very good on a busy night and it might take a while to get the staffs attention. Also, they usually limit your seating to 2 hours but you won't have to worry because you'll be full really quick at this all you can eat cuisine. For dessert, they serve plenty of things! So make sure that you leave room for dessert!"}
{"text":"From the exterior, there is nothing unique about this place.  Inside, I was seated immediately along with a friend and given menus. The salmon sashimi was disappointing, didn't taste fresh. What surprised me was the service was terrible, especially since it was a weekday and was not busy at all.  The only thing that tasted half decent was the dessert which was probably store bought.  I would not recommend this place to a friend.  2/5"}
{"text":"Worst place ever went to, had a reservation and still had to wait for an hour, food is horrible with no service at all! Never go again !"}
{"text":"I don't usually eat AYCE but this is imo the best AYCE in GTA. I was so pleasantly surprised that I want to give it 5 stars for first visit, but it wasn't as good the second time. Overall good for cooked foods and sashimi that easily matches the quality of an average non-ayce restaurant.  Cooked Foods - some favorites:  Garlic Sirloin Beef Cubes - this is my fav order at AYCE. Juicy, flavorful, soft cubes , but second time was tough.   Enoki Beef Roll - really the best I've had - not tough/chewy like others.   Fish Soup, Steamed Egg  Raw:  Sashimi Selection - possibly the best selection for AYCE - in addition to the standard choices, they even have squid, sweet shrimp, mackerel (fav) and herring.   They also have Tako wasabi!!!   Beef Tataki  Rolls: I only tried mango roll and didn't like it   Desserts: the milk/mango yogurt/pudding is ok, ginger milk was watery.  The interior is pretty nice (kind of ~upscale~ with the dark woods/purple theme) and comfortable too."}
{"text":"Called to make reservation and told we don't need to make one if we came \"right now.\"  We came right now and were told there's nowhere to sit. Went home hungry, including my 2-year-old. They just sent us away! Highly recommended if you are ok not eating.   Um, what?  WTF  Avoid!"}
{"text":"i will never come back here again with my family.  we went on a christmas day.  the staff was very friendly and helpful.  the sashimi was fresh.  the tempura was a disaster.  the vegetables tempura were barely coated with the tempura batter like none at all!  the shrimp tempura was cold and limp!  we had some of the fish and they were not bad but very greasy.  orders came late and we had to order again and so in the end we got the same order twice!  the sea weed salad had some much liquid in it at the bottom of its bowl.   strange this was.  the miso soup was heavily diluted nearing the realm of blandness.  the meat skewers were good though.    the dessert?  terrible!!!  the mango pudding tasted nothing like mango pudding.  i eat almost anything but that mango pudding was disgusting and i had to spit it out and i never spit out food even at home.  the mousse was basically flavoured whipped cream.  the good desserts were the ginger milk and the fried banana.  they come highly recommended by me.    so a few good things but all in all a terrible place to eat.    sorry matsuda, truth hurts but it's for the best."}
{"text":"This place is actually pretty good for some AYCE sushi. I've been to the other location at Markham and Steeles a few years ago. Both are pretty good. They offer a lot of variety of sushi and both hot and cold dishes.   The negatives are it's a little expensive and the service was poor.  We ordered a certain amount and they always brought out a little less, I guess they assumed we wouldn't be able to finish it. But we kept having to order more on many occassions.   It's good for a sushi fix, especially in the area where there aren't many AYCE sushi places that are good."}
{"text":"After a day of shopping, we were craving AYCE, so a friend recommended this place. Although this place has teppanaki and AYCE we only went for the AYCE.   The food was absolutely delicious. I would recommend the kimchi hot pot. The broths for the spicy udon/ramen were great. However, the one thing I would not recommend would be the grilled fish as it was burnt and not exactly what we expected. Lots of bones.   Our first order of the food was fast! I would recommend ordering as much food as you can the first time because after that, the service takes a while and it can be difficult to get their attention afterwards. There were a few mix up with our orders and it was a hassle to get them to change it, and sometimes it wasn't worth it. It was almost nice that there was a waiting time during our next few orders as we got hungry while waiting.   We finally got our bill and they told us tip was already included. It was actually surprising to me since I know they automatically tip if you have a party of 6 or more. We only had 3 but what can you do. Just make sure you don't add more tip on top of the tip if you're paying by card."}
{"text":"\"it's a nice AYCE Sushi experience but expect to pay top dollar if you can find parking\"   There is such a vast AYCE menu here that you might want to come on an empty stomach, and that includes saving some room for dessert. The problem is that items will take a while to arrive given how big and busy they almost always are. The quality of sashimi, rolls and other dishes are quite good, but the processing and cooking time varies widely so you really should make a slightly bigger order so it arrives to your plate staggered.  They have all of the typical items as well as a large choice of their own custom/special items to try. Lots of meaty dishes, rice and noodle dishes as well. They have a good appetizer sectionm  The dessert selection is huge including fresh puddings as well as your traditional ice cream.   Atmosphere has hard top stone tables and lots of ample seating. Can't go wrong going here."}
{"text":"Awesome place. Came with family today for Lunar New Year lunch. Surprisingly it wasn't that full until it hit 1:30pm which I think is the peak time for lunch. We ordered a lot of food like my portion was insane! LOL. The price is pretty good for a AYCE place, cheaper compared to Ten-ichi but service is a bit lacking.   What I ordered: Miso Soup Chicken and Beef Skewers Mango Roll (photo got messed up on phone) Rainbow Roll (photo got messed up on phone also) Spicy Salmon Roll Surf Clam Sushi Dynamite Roll  For dessert: Mango Yogurt Tiramisu  I also been to this place before it underwent new management but I noticed that they barely changed the seating and scenery minus the fact that they added more authentic Japanese memorabilia like the oni masks above the washroom and private VIP rooms. This time I actually feel more vibrancy and there's more energy which is a good thing. Next time when I go back, I think I'll bring a more stronger camera then just my phone."}
{"text":"Despite of the old-looking exterior. Interor is pretty good. Had  a quick lunch here between work, and even though the soup is a little not warm enough. The overall speed of food delivery is good. (About 10 minutes) Salad, to my surprise, is pretty decent too. Would come again~"}
{"text":"Matsuda admittedly does a good job as a AYCE restaurant. The space is large and airy, service on-hand when needed, food comes fast after being ordered and the quality of the food is fresh and cooked well (when needed). They have moved onto the ever-popular tablet ordering system so you can track the amount of indulgence you've had.   In all honesty, I begrudgingly scored a 3 stars because they don't do anything badly, but nothing is spectacular except for maybe the quantity of food that you are legally allowed to shove into stomach.  Also, for the price of $30ish dollars there are still items on the menu that is not available on the weekdays dinner which is just annoying."}
{"text":"I came right before rush hour which is pretty nice. The service was amazing in the beginning cause there wasn't that many people. Once more people showed up, there was less service but that was fine since we were getting full. We extended over the two hour time limit they told us only because we had friends trickling in. The sushi was nice and tasted fresh also. I highly recommend this to all!"}
{"text":"Matsuda has finally upgraded to ipads!! Last time I visited this restaurant they were still using pencil and paper. I came to eat here as a part of a party. My friend made reservations for 8PM for 20 people on a Saturday a week in advance. We waited for at least 30 minutes if not more which was incredibly upsetting. You would figure such a big group and a reservation made well in advance would yield a prepared table for when we came in. But nope. So irritating to wait around knowing you had a reservation. Aside from that the food here is pretty great. This AYCE place doesn't really do that thing where you order 25 sashimi and they give you 10. They honour your numbers. The food variety makes up for the bad experience. If it weren't for this reservation problem I would give them a better review."}
{"text":"Matsuda never lets down when it comes to fresh sashimi, grilled items and teppanyaki. This is our ayce staple in Toronto. Today's visit however was a little disappointing... We found strands of hair in our sashimi and a very small piece of tin foil in the sirloin steak. Tsk tsk"}
{"text":"Horrible horrible horrible. Ruined my night and it was already going Terrible. Matsuda was supposed to be the bright light at the end of the tunnel  and ended up with a horrible experience here."}
{"text":"Great food! Absolutely love what actually gets to our table for AYCE. The service is horrible, they bring you less than what you ordered and sometimes don't come by your table until you call them over. I think they are very understaffed for such a busy place. The environment is nice and clean. It's a little too pricey for dinner, only a few things on the menu change. I personally love the matsuda golden shrimp and the dynamite and California maki rolls. The golden shrimp is a must have for shrimp lovers. The desserts are cute and light, great end to a meal."}
{"text":"I have been coming to Matsuda for over ten years now and I have to say the good has always been good but it was the service that needed improvement. My visit today was the best visit ever and the service was great. Probably one of the best services i've had in a while from any restaurant actually. Management definitely had a talk with their staff because damn that was really great service lol"}
{"text":"Good food and good service but is busy every time i've been here so make sure you make a reservation (even on the weekdays!)"}
{"text":"In comparison to Ten Ichi - their scallops at Matsuda is quite big for AYCE and plentiful! I've been to Heart sushi before in Mississauga and their scallops are not as good as here. They also have sweet shrimp which is a plus for me since I love sweet shrimp and their octopus sashimi is very succulent and meaty. They also have the squid but chopped up so the texture is not as nice as it would be whole.  The garlic beef steak is pretty good - my friends really enjoyed that and their pressed sushi as well. You don't get to see many places with pressed sushi so it was nice to try it out.   Wait time surprisingly wasn't that busy on a Friday however I still made reservations nonetheless. Usually people say despite making reservations, you may not get a seat right away depending on the people so if you are in a rush somewhere - it is most likely best to get their earlier before the reservation to get the seat and accommodate the timing!"}
{"text":"We had come here last year and it was fantastic! However it has gone downhill since then. Horribly overpriced for what was utter despicable service. Slow, RUDE, and orders kept getting messed up (there were 4 other tables at the time; it was not very busy at all). At the end we had a fair amount of sushi left over which we agreed to pay the price and was told that we could take it home. The server agreed but then after 10 min she changed what she had said and said we had to pay even more. We disagreed and after a few back and forth she clearly swore (which we should have brought up with management but didn't) and took forever for her to get us a takeout box and bill. While the food was delicious we will NEVER come back here and make sure to steer anyone else clear of this place as well. What a horrible experience."}
{"text":"I should've read the reviews before coming here! Tbh I think the food here actually tastes great, but the service was seriously awful. Came here with one other person on a Saturday afternoon/evening - there was no hostess to greet/seat us for several minutes despite being seen waiting around by staff. After getting our table it just went down hill; easy orders like miso soup and seaweed salad never arrived, and neither did our salmon sashimi. I asked one of the servers for ginger and she replied: \"ask the waiter\" - so then, what are you exactly?? In general, all the servers were inattentive and didn't care about getting orders right. AND to top it all off, they charged 12% auto gratuity on our bill of just 2 ppl! No wonder they don't give a crap about service, they're getting tipped anyway.   Good food, but terrible service - avoid if you can, especially on the weekends."}
{"text":"Taste: 1 Service: 1 Value: 1 Presentation: 2 Overall: 1.2 down to 1  Hi an welcome to another episode of javing it with Javier. Let's see what we are javing today. Today we are trying out all you can eat at Matsuda. This used to be one of my favourite all you can eat Japanese places a long time ago, but I stopped going over a year ago because the quality deteriorated a lot. Let's see if they have made any improvements.   Starting off with the salmon sashimi which is my favourite. After trying a few pieces here though, I actually didn't want to eat anymore sashimi which is extremely surprising. If I were to describe it, it tasted like soggy jello. The skewers we ordered were so burnt, you wouldn't have known the difference if you were served charcoal on a stick instead. The rolls were mediocre at best, nothing very interesting there.  Service was not great throughout the night. Some of the employees gave us attitude which I wasn't very fond of. Our orders took forever to arrive. And when they did arrive, we had missing items and we were given items we didn't order.  I actually didn't know the price until they gave us the cheque at the end. A whopping $40 to be served a variety of garbage? No thanks!  In conclusion, there is much to be desired from Matsuda. I thought that they would pick up their slack, but I guess I was wrong. I won't be visiting this restaurant again. Better to use that money buying sushi at TNT supermarket instead. And that's it for today's episode of javing it with Javier. And remember food is life!"}
{"text":"There's nothing to complain about the food here, but service is so so so horrible once it gets busy.  Always orders forgotten, our dessert took so long (over 20 minutes) that they decided to bill us first on their own, and then remembered they still haven't given us the dessert after all bills were paid. Oh top of that, they rudely pointed out my tip is less than 10% and asked for more. I've never seen any waitress do that, tip is not required and it depends on my experience at the restaurant, this place was definitely not a good experience to have."}
{"text":"One of the better \"all you can eat sushi\" restaurants. Been coming here for the past 2 years and the quality and presentation of food is consistent and great. Sashimi is always fresh!"}
{"text":"Neat place for teppanyaki! Food tastes great and the restaurant looks pretty nice. The best part is watching the chef cook the food in front of you and sets everything on fire. Very quick knife work too!  If you're looking for something different, this place is it. Price wise, it's along the lines of your average Japanese restaurant. I paid about $30-35 for all you can eat on a weekend."}
{"text":"We'd been visiting this place sometime and liked their AYCE sushi, but after tonight I am forced to give them one star.  Because it was busy, they seated us in the teppanyaki room, which was not a problem for us.  However, they seated three other parties at the same large table which allowed us to clearly observe the service level for each party.  Two of the parties were composed of Asians and two (including ours) were composed of Caucasians.  They were very prompt about bringing orders to the two Asian parties and ignored us and the other one.  They did not even bother to refill our tea when requested.  We finally informed the manager and he brought part of the stuff we ordered which was still missing (not even all of it).  He took 10% off the bill and did not charge for drinks, but sorry, it was too late for apologies.  That kind of treatment seems discriminatory and is not okay in my book.  They lost what might have been loyal customers."}
{"text":"Food was mediocre, when we ordered 10 pieces they would give us 4. I came here with my family today and had reservations. The lady proceeded to seat everyone else while we waited 20mins after our reservations. Service is alright, had to yell to get a waiter/waitress's attention.   The food is nothing to rave about."}
{"text":"Probably the best quality AYCE sushi resto in Scarborough (which, to be fair, isn't saying much as the quality of AYCE sushi has declined immensely here). The sushi here is consistently fresh.  Unfortunately, so is the slow (and sometimes forgetful) service. The restaurant is fairly busy, especially on weekends and holidays (by which I mean any celebratory holiday: Mother's Day, Father's Day, etc.) Not to mention it's in the same plaza as a T&T grocery store, which can make parking a bit of a chore. But the quality you'll get here is better than other AYCE sushi restaurants you'll find in the area."}
{"text":"Came here after a friend recommended this place and I have to say I was quite pleased. This restaurant is in comparison to Ten-Ichi located in Scarborough where I frequent all the time with friends and family. Matsuda is cheaper and quality of food is amazing. Restaurant is big and the food was delivered quickly. Loved the place. Went to lunch buffet and it was quite busy but service was never slow."}
{"text":"I was so excited when this location opened up because they had teppanyaki, but I'm a little disappointed here. Although the food is so good, the service is very disappointing.    Pros: - Food: The food here is so good! Regardless if you order desserts, appetizers, or the sushi, everything is made fresh and is so tasty! See below for my favourite orders.  - Options: I love the menu here. Tons of options (even if you don't like seafood).  - Parking: Tons of parking in the back lot and a couple of spaces at the front.   Cons: - Service: Honestly, the service is bad and I feel like it keeps getting worse overtime I come. It sucks when you order one thing and they don't bring enough of it, it takes WAY to long or they forget. There have been multiple occasions when I've had to repeatedly ask for my order again and again and wouldn't get it.   Foods I like:  - Seaweed Salad - Wasabi Mussels  - Grilled Chicken Skewer - Grilled Golden Scallop - Scallop Cutlets: This is so yummy! I love it with the wasabi mayo.  - Smoked Salmon Avocado Salad - Matsuda Golden Shrimp - Matsuda Golden Flower - Sirloin Steak - Sirloin Roll - Matsuda Maki - Philadelphia Maki - Green Dragon Maki - Spicy Salmon Hand Roll - Spicy Crispy Hand Roll  - Agedashi Tofu - Gyoza - Grilled Eggplant - Grilled Mushroom - Baked Mussel with Cheese - Mango Yogurt - Tiramisu - Ginger Milk - Deep Fried Banana  - Creme Brûlée - Green Tea Ice cream - Red Bean Ice cream - Mango Ice cream"}
{"text":"I used to love it here, but unfortunately it has changed a lot over the years.   Pros: - Food: Food here is fantastic! I love it. The sashimi is always fresh and tons of options for sushi, sashimi, fried foods and desserts.  - Decor: The decor in the restaurant is nice. Low lit and not to old.  - Parking: As long as you don't go during peak hours, the parking lot isn't to bad. Tons of spaces in the lot!   Cons:  - Service: Honestly, service has gone down hill over the years. The servers used to be great and used to tend to our table right away, but not so much anyway. The orders get mixed up a lot when being placed. An example is if you order 20 Sirloin Rolls, I'll get 10. This happens with a lot of the foods being ordered. Slightly annoying when you have to keep placing an order multiple times through a meal.  - Price: The price per person is higher, but not to bad for the amount of options you get. After tax and tip, the cost per person is about $40.00 now. Just way to much for the quality of food and service that you get.    Foods I like:  - Seaweed Salad - Wasabi Mussels  - Grilled Chicken Skewer - Grilled Golden Scallop - Scallop Cutlets: This is so yummy! I love it with the wasabi mayo.  - Smoked Salmon Avocado Salad - Matsuda Golden Shrimp - Matsuda Golden Flower - Sirloin Steak - Sirloin Roll - Matsuda Maki - Philadelphia Maki - Green Dragon Maki - Spicy Salmon Hand Roll - Spicy Crispy Hand Roll  - Agedashi Tofu - Gyoza - Grilled Eggplant - Grilled Mushroom - Baked Mussel with Cheese - Mango Yogurt - Tiramisu - Ginger Milk - Deep Fried Banana  - Creme Brûlée - Green Tea Ice cream - Red Bean Ice cream - Mango Ice cream"}
{"text":"We had dinner here for a few times, and the consistency is always the same. There is a fairly large selection from the AYCE menu. The sashimi comes out at the perfect temperature for my liking! As other places serve it too cold for me to enjoy. The eel rice is by far my favourite. The sauce and seasoning is on point! Service is efficient."}
{"text":"This is my favorite AYCE Japanese buffet. Its on par with all the other AYCE places in Markham but the one thing I like here is the Herb Salmon sashimi. It has a distinct flavor which I can't put my finger on but I actually like it better than the regular salmon sashimi. And so far I haven't found any other places that serve the herb salmon sashimi. Pricing and service is what you can expect from an AYCE restaurant."}
{"text":"I used to frequently go here because it near by where I live, and it was so good. The service was good and the food was amazing for ayce. However, over the years as it got more popular the service became terrible and your food would never come without a reminder. It was difficult to even get water from the servers and the quality of the food decreased. Not the best but not the worst. Also pretty pricey now."}
{"text":"This place used to be my favourite place for Japanese AYCE. However, there are too many other newly opened Japanese AYCE places and we no longer come here due to the limited food selections. But it's a good place compared to tenichi"}
{"text":"High end AYCE, which is matched by its lounge-like, darkened-room decor. Came here with my family on Sunday for lunch ($16.99 for adults) and we got almost everything on the menu. Okay, maybe 2/3 of it.  The Good: All their Nigiri had a good proportion of protein to rice. Seafood was very fresh. Unagi, spicy salmon and the tuna were my favourites. Tamago was a little bland, and Inari a little overpowering, though, Had all four of their signature Maki: Green Dragon, Mango, Sunrise, Volcano. Volcano contains cooked Salmon and was coated with teriyaki sauce, my least favourite. And I normally don't like kitschy mango rolls, but this one was perfectly balanced - they make their own mango syrup with fresh mangoes, so it doesn't taste like dessert when you eat it. The others two were good too, not too. much rice. Beef, chicken and chicken skin skewers were amazing. Not dry at all. Their take on Takoyaki (cuttlefish ball) on the menu was amazing. They top it with a peanut sauce, mmmm. Careful, just like the ones in Osaka, these are volcano-hot on the inside! Desserts: lots of selection, including tons of mousses. Small portions so you can try many kinds. Deep fried banana (using the crispy tonaktsu batter) with ice cream? Yum.  The bad: Soba (cold buckwheat noodles) were presented nicely, with a raw quail egg, but tasted like nothing like Soba texturally. Tempura batter was fried at very high temperatures, so ultra crispy and not light tasting. Tonkatsu curry tasted more like South Indian curry (heavy on the masala) then the sweeter, richer Japanese curries.  Everything was presented in a sophisticated fashion, especially sauces on the Nigiri platters (see picture). A bit pricey, though, it's 25 for dinner on weekdays, and more on weekends. All in all, a sophisticated, delicious AYCE place!"}
{"text":"This place sucks..... I don't have a problem with the Steele's location but their new locations is horrible...  I hate when I go try new places I had never tried before and the result that I get from the experience is a stomach ache. And that's what I got from this place.   Something in their sashimi, cooked meat or whatever it was didn't sit well with me. By the end of the meal I was already feeling the after effects of the meal in my stomach while still sitting in the restaurant!! It was instant.. Seriously, something is up with this place and isn't right.... I've gone to a handful of different japanese sushi joints and majority of them had not given me problems. BUT, THIS PLACE... your restaurant is HORRIBLE....  Whatever it is in your back end kitchen or however you preserve your fish, there is something wrong...   The sashimi didn't taste very fresh nor did the meat dishes either. Plus they kept giving us orders that we have never even ordered. May I also include that this place is not cheap either. On a Monday -Thursday basis its $25.99 for dinner?! Your restaurant is a joke. And they charge you even more on Friday's and weekends. This place is a waste of time and money. Food sucks, expensive, and makes you sick.     Just go to Gonoe Sushi next door if you want good sushi."}
{"text":"Gee Golly This AYCE is expensive - the dinner is $30 on the weekend and holidays.   I'm not sure if the pricing is 100% worth it, as the $30 doesn't include drinks beyond water and tea.   Although I have to give them props for some pretty impressive presentation on the sashimi plates, ice and blinking lights.  The decor and service is great, they checked back in with you quite often.   This place is also made for large groups - with several huge booths to seat lots of people. I can't promise that your order will always be right - but you definitely have a lot of room to place the plates.   The weekends and holidays also offer a few more desserts. If you there on a Weekend or Holiday, I'd said order the Mango Yogurt and the Ginger Milk dessert. I found the others to be a bit too one note on the heavy cream. I didn't order the mango pudding, but some of the table guests mentioned that the mango pudding had an off-putting artificial taste to it.  Their service is pretty good, mind you they are newly opened - so I can only hope that they maintain quality and level of service as they go forward.   I didn't enjoy the grilled seafood salad, unless you like baked guacamole - this item is on the DNO ( do not order) list. Also skip the mochi skewer, I was not impressed.   Do order lots of their short ribs, the mushroom and sliced beef and tenpan steak chunks with garlic slices, the sashimi was decent and the hand rolls ok. The rolls were ok - but if you are ordering - make sure you tell them quantity as it is pretty much by individual item.   Overall - not too bad - but pricey."}
{"text":"I don't normally bitch about bad service but out of all the restaurants I've ever eaten at, this establishment has probably been one of the worst restaurants I've ever been to in terms of service.  Me and my cousins came sometime during Chinese New Year so it's understandable that the restaurant is busy. What was not understandable was the fact that we had to wait two hours for our main entrees. On our order sheets we specified that we wants a few appetizers like tempura and spring rolls, we also order sashimi and of course three maki rolls for us to share. We give our sheet to our server (who by the way does not even greet us or even offer water) and we get our appetizers and such within 20 minutes which was fine. But after constantly asking where our maki rolls were, we were ravenous and starting to get hangry. Everytime we would see a mango roll leave the sushi bar it would inevitable go to another table. After the fifth time of asking for our food within the two hours, we ordered dessert and resolved to the decision that if the dessert came before the maki rolls, then we would leave. Inevitably, only the ice cream had come. So we asked another server for the bill and when our original server came with our bills we paid. Now I was completely quiet and polite, albiet mad and hungry, because I did not want to create a scene. However, all of that changed when our server had the nerve to demand a \"service tip\" after I paid the exact amount. I understand that the service industry is tough and relies on tips but how does one have the audacity to demand a \"service tip\" when I didn't even get a reasonable service that filled my stomach. So I assertively said \"No\" and explained that we had to wait 2 hours for food that did not even show up at our table.   Let's just say we ended up taming the beast which was my stomach at the closest McDonalds. Ask me if I'm ever coming back again (because I won't)."}
{"text":"Both the all you can eat and the teppanyaki are well above average, and fairly priced as well! This is the sushi place in Toronto I would rank as my personal favourite."}
{"text":"I been here before and service and food were great.  I went here yesterday with reservation for 10 guests. I vowed to never returned.  We ordered foods that never came! We sat there for 3 hours still little food show up. I ordered several times and they only bring 10% or less of our order. I ordered 5 maki to help as fillers but only 2 comes. Why the hell would you bring 2 maki on one plate to feed10 people and nothing else for another 20mins!?  I asked multiple times in case they have short term memory loss but they keep bringing us little bits of food. Beside us sat a family of 3 (dad, mom, child), who looked very upset because they were not getting any service or food either. They finally got a attention of one of the waiters and left.   After 3 hours of sitting there still waiting for food. We decide to leave and we were still hungry!   NEVER EVER RETURNING TO THIS RESTAURANT AGAIN!  SURPRISE: Friend ordered two eel hand roll. One of the hand roll had a piece banana in it!? WTF is wrong with these people!?"}
{"text":"My second visit here WOWed me. I came here for Mothers Day - 5:30 pm - made reservations day before and they squeezed us in. Lady over the phone was accommodating.   I don't know why but the second experience here was soooo much better.   The sashimi is still fresh and good. So are the handrolls. I super love their california hand rolls and I don't usually get hand rolls.  Their hot items are all great. Except the garlic sirloin, this time it was chewy and slightly over cooked. But wow, item after item, (we ordered about 1/2 of the items on the grill / hot items list) and it was consistently deliciousness after  deliciousness!   Service is fast at the beginning and slow near the end. Go figure. This is typical though so order more in your first round!   Don't forget the assortment of dessert! Get one of each! You can do it!   I also found out their AYCE is a couple bucks cheaper than some competitors in the area. That works for me! I'm a new fan. (minus salmon Belly and all... :)"}
{"text":"Same as most of the reviews: DON'T GO HERE WITH BIG GROUPS. Their customer service is terrible despite the large yummy selection of ayce sushi. I went here with a party of 10 on a Saturday afternoon at 11:30 (when it opens, so it's not busy at all). We got seated right away in a party room because we reserved beforehand. That's when problems started. We ordered and it took about 30 min to get a few of our dishes, we waited about another 15 min and asked if there's more coming, our waitress said she would check but never got back to us. We finally decided to order some more and yet again, our order took so long to come and we were missing a lot of our order. Our waitress stopped checking up on us at this point so we waited another 20 min before one of us finally went to look for her. We ordered more food along with dessert since we knew they would take forever and waited some more. At this point, I was on the verge of just walking out. I was hungry, irritated and tired of waiting. Our desserts finally came after what seemed like an eternity, along with our sushi -_-. We spent a total of 3.5 hours here and I left hungry....at an AYCE sushi place...I left hungry. Ridiculous. On top of that, I had to pay gratuity for this horrible service because we were over a party of 8. Ridiculous.  On the plus side. Their food is good. Get the chef's recommendation for sushi (mango roll), sirloin beef with garlic, and this shrimp dish (I forgot what it was called). In terms of dessert, mango pudding is good along with the mousse. The deep fried banana comes per piece so you have to say how many pieces you want (they're pretty tiny)"}
{"text":"Not as good as the last time I visited. But still the only place with ginger milk which I love haha. Mango yogurt has more gelatin than before as well. Sashimi pieces were cut too thick today. Sushi was lacking tbh. Too much rice and it was over cooked.  Overall the quality is still decent though. Sashimi is fresh. Also they only charge 10% service charge (included in the bill) which I think is good. Some places overcharge. Service was decent but the waiting time for food was super long today. I think we waited over 20 mins for some things. Come here if u want sashimi and ginger milk haha."}
{"text":"Meh. Food was good. Service was utterly confused. At first I thought it was because we were such a large group, but same issues as the other reviews."}
{"text":"This would be my fourth or fifth time to this location.  My first and second time - I would've rated it 5 stars.  The food was great.  The service was great.  Great selection.  Quick turnaround on the food.  Third and fourth time started going downhill.  Still good but more 4 stars than 5.  This would probably be my least enjoyable visit here.  Maybe it was because its a Thursday evening.  The service wasnt up to par.  The food was sub-par.  Just a little disappointing.  We ordered the crispy pork belly 4 times before they sent it over.  It was neither crispy nor was it pork belly. More like dried cold pork.  There was this golden scallop thing on thr menu where i pictured a beautiful panko encrusted scallop fried to a golden crisp presented to us on a seashell with whatever sauce they were going to serve it with.  Along came a seashell with a piped on mound of sweet potato mash and a tiny little scallop in which you had to treasure hunt for.  Avocado seafood salad is luke warm flavourless guac.  Don't order it.  A few other items we ordered right from the beginning of the meal.  It never came and when we asked for it again, they said it was sold out (third time asking for it).  They brought us a bill for more than the number of people that were at the table.  Just disappointed.  I might go back on a weekend to see if they can redeem themselves but definitely not anytime soon."}
{"text":"3.5/5, +.5 for service  With many of the newer AYCE restaurants switching to iPad ordering and all its eye candy technology, it's great to see restaurants that still use the traditional ordering system. Not just that, the traditional places are generally lower price than the iPad ones, and it showed as dinner for this place on a weekend is only $24.99 for adults.  I arrived at 9pm and we had to wait 15 minutes for a table. I was impressed by how packed the place is, but realized at the end how long this place existed by the amount of check-ins and the not-so modern design of the restaurant compared to other more recent AYCE places I've been to.  Items I ordered included miso soup, chawanmushi steamed egg, all of the sashimi, chopped ika sushi, tobiko sushi, matsuda maki, philadelphia maki, shrimp tempura, grilled beef skewer, calamari teriyaki, japanese curry beef tender, scallop cutlet, sirloin roll, salmon and chopped ika pizza, mango yogurt, kimchi seafood hotpot, tiramisu, chocolate mousse, and ginger milk.  Good: - Chawanmushi steamed egg: Egg tasted quite good! The enoki mushrooms were a good add as well. - Sashimi: Amazingly fresh, especially the ika and salmon. - Chopped ika sushi: It was actually a roll, but still excellent taste. - Grilled beef skewer: The beef was very juicy! - Tiramisu: Must-have for dessert! - Chocolate mousse: Again, must-have! - Ginger milk: My parents enjoyed it, saying it's very rich.  Okay: - Tobiko sushi: More like masago, but not bad. - Matsuda maki: If it was bigger I would've liked it more, but seeing it's a buffet I can understand the size. - Shrimp tempura: Nothing special. - Calamari teriyaki: Nothing special, though it was more like cuttlefish. - Japanese curry beef tender: Once again nothing special. The beef tasted quite good though but the curry lacked taste. - Scallop cutlet: Nothing special. - Sirloin roll: The steak was good, the mushrooms were good, but it was quite thin. - Salmon and chopped ika pizza: Probably the smallest pizza I've ever eaten.  Bad: - Miso soup: Way too salty. - Philadelphia maki: The cream cheese was on top of the roll, not inside. - Mango yogurt: Tasted nothing like mango or yogurt.  Service was excellent the whole way. Despite the fact we were in the corner of the restaurant, we were able to get the server's attention the whole time when we needed something, especially when we needed refills on our Nesteas.  I've had better AYCE experiences for sure for higher prices, but for $24.99 this place is certainly of good value for your traditional AYCE style which (surprisingly) is getting rarer to find."}
{"text":"Nice decor. Fresh and delicious sushi. My only complain would be that they don't give you a list so you can check the items yourself, instead you have to tell your server verbally the items you want to get. I don't like this method of ordering when its all you can eat, idk it makes me feel uncomfortable. Also, the food takes some time and they don't bring everything at once. They seem to run off a lot of item."}
{"text":"This was from an experience a few months back: We chose here for a friend's birthday celebration and to be honest, I've been here a few times before and experiences/food have been decent. However during this meal, we had multiple negative experiences... that makes me never want to go back.   Understanding that the restaurant was busy during 5pm, we gave extra time for our food to arrive, but it dragged out as long as waiting 45mins+ for certain dishes. Our waiter was very sweet, thus we overlooked it multiple times. One of our friends is vegetarian and we SPECIFICALLY asked for certain items on the menu that were labelled as \"veg\" and we clarified that it indeed is veg - however 3 times in a row they brought these \"veg\" dishes that had different seafood mixed it. Having had enough, we asked the manager to come over... and this is the most absurd part. Not only did the owner seem dismissive, he didn't utter a single apology during our conversation. We asked the owner to explain to us why there are bonito flakes (dried tuna flakes) on a veg dish - he simply stated that it's vegetarian (...fish?) when we questioned further on this, he presented an extremely rude attitude and basically said whatever. Listen to this - we asked him \"where are bonito flakes from?\" and he said \"the sea\". We gave up there.  No apologies at all. The waiter came after to apologize on the manager's behalf.   At the end, they gave a 10% discount but that doesn't even matter - what kind of restaurant has a manager who is so inconsiderate, condescending and most importantly, takes dietary constraints as a joke? Deeply disappointed, Matsuda."}
{"text":"I guess this is one of the better AYCE sushi places in the area. The menu is what's attractive about this place. They have a wide range of variety for you to choose from and the food is pretty fresh depending on the days you go. The service has always been a downer since some of the girls there have too much attitude for their own good. They need a chill pill and some ice for that dreadful expression they have. Other then that, food is A-OK depending on what you order.   DO NOT ORDER: seaweed salad: This is the nastiest seaweed salad I've had. It looks fake, tastes like plastic and I'm pretty sure IT IS plastic... NIGHTMARE!  MUST HAVES:  Tako Sashimi (really fresh compared to many places) matsuda fried golden shrimp: fried shrimp with mayo sauce (family favourite) sirloin steak: steak in cubed pieces with roasted garlic sauce Mango rolls: california roll without the fish roe COVERED in fresh mango sauce (YUM!) Beef Skewer: well marinated and tender meat Salmon rose: looks pretty and great texture Mango yogurt: take it like a shot and order lots!! (this is me feeling poetic)"}
{"text":"Matsuda has to be one of my favourite All you can eat sushi in Toronto. The service is fast and friendly and even when the restaurant is full, the wait is short.   The selection is pretty impressive and the prices are reasonable. The ingredients are fresh and quite tasty for an AYCE restaurant.   I would recommend the noodle soups (especially the seafood or vegetarian ones) with the spicy broth. Absolutely delicious!"}
{"text":"I haven't been back to Matsuda for years. And I am surprised how they improved. They have more selections of food now. Last time I went there, the waitress were very friendly. She recommended some food that were so good. The only thing I dislike is the price has gone up. But compare to downtown ayce the selections of food can't be beat."}
{"text":"I came here with my friends on a Friday we arrived there at about 12:30 p.m and left the place at about 3:30 p.m. It was our first time trying this sushi restaurant and we were excited and even wanted to bring our other friends next time. We've been waiting for a lot of dishes we ordered and we got nothing we missed about 10 dishes and left an all you can eat buffet still hungry. Our experience wasn't great, the food was really good but the service was terrible."}
{"text":"bomb ass food, horrible service though"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I had AYCE lunch on a Monday at 11:45am. Food is great! Really not bad for AYCE. Service is ok, acceptable. HOWEVER, only go to this place if you have at least 2.5 hours for lunch. Yes, EVERYTHING HERE is VERY SLOW ...much slower than other AYCE places. The only thing that is in normal speed is when they clean up your table and give you the bill!! You pretty much have to wait minimum 15 minutes before someone comes take your first order!! Please remember to order AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE in your first order, because your 2nd order might take an hour for the food to come. Oh well, the hot food items we have ordered came fresh and hot!! In addition, 15% gratuity (before tax) is added to your bill automatically regardless the number of people in your party, so whether you like the service or not, you are tipping the servers!! Although it is AYCE, but you won't be full if you have less than 2 hours for lunch on a not busy MONDAY.. (you will need more time for weekend)! Took us 2.5 hours for lunch today and we only ordered 2 rounds of food..first round is all sushi and hot food items...second round is desserts."}
{"text":"I'm not a restaurant complainer nor high maintenance.   I understand the restaurant business is tough and I cringe at the 1 star - but it had to be done...   We used to come here all the time over the last 3 years, when it used to be Hyakka and now as Matsuda.  It was one of our favourite sushi places not only in the area, but in Toronto in general.  Service, quality, and portions have unfortunately gone VERY down hill as of late.  As an example, the dynamite shrimp last time we visited came with 4 pieces/order, and yesterday was down to 2 pcs/order.    This, of course, wouldn't be a huge deal if the servers came around more often and there wasn't such a gap between ordering and when you actually get your food (20 mins to make 2 pcs of shrimp? really?).  Unfortunately this is not the case.   Last night at the bottom of my mixed vegetables I discovered a bug (dead, about the size of a thumbtack) as well as a very obvious hair on an order of shrimp we were given.  As we lost our appetite, we asked for the bill and then the manager.  The waitress was very sweet and sympathetic.    The manager proceeded to offer 10% off of the bill.  10% discount for insects in food is insulting, appalling, and quite f*king ridiculous in my opinion.   The restaurant was packed to capacity at this point and we are a party of 2 with not only a bug and but a hair - I shudder to think what surprises could be going undetected for the other 60+ diners in the vicinity....  Like I said, I'm not a complainer.  but a 10% discount tells me you not only don't value my business, but you also don't value my health.  In contrast, I found a hair in my pasta one time at East Side Mario's.  Did not complain, simply asked for a new dish.  I got a brand new meal, did not pay a red cent, and also was given a 25$ gift card to retain my business.  Time to find a new favourite Sushi place.  Would not go back there if someone paid me."}
{"text":"Nothing really fancy, just good food and LOTS OF IT!"}
{"text":"Matsuda is exactly as you'd expect an all you can eat sushi restaurant. Not great, not bad, but acceptable. This is the place to be if you want all you can eat. Food is decent. Serve is fast. Wait times are long. Don't come with more than a party of 4.   Will return, if I'm itching for all you can eat sushi. No real complaints."}
{"text":"Been here few times and was never disappointed.  This place is very nicely set up for an all you can eat sushi eatery.  The portions per order is smaller so it's good for trying out more items on the menu without getting stuffed on the same thing.  However, due to the long line up, this would be a poor choice for a spontaneous outing and last minute craving."}
{"text":"Really lovely atmosphere and delicious food but extremely slow service & difficult to get a hold of your server"}
{"text":"I came here on a Sunday afternoon for lunch with some friends and we had a pretty good experience. The restaurant is spacious, has nice decor and it feels clean when you walk in.   All the ordering is done by iPads, and the servers are friendly, but a little slow at times.   For dessert, they actually have a ton of flavours for mousse, which were nice, but you could definitely tell they were made hours or a day or so ago,  because they tasted a bit stale.  I wish they offered the hot milk dessert that they offer at the Don Mills location - that is delicious!.   Unfortunately, their lunch AYCE is a tad bit limited, but the price isn't too bad for what you get.   Overall a pretty good experience. but not too likely I will return.   Heads up, its a crazy busy plaza on the weekends, so parking is a bit hard to find sometimes."}
{"text":"Service was fast, food is pretty okay, but service is terrible. They forgot food, gave us less than the amount we ordered and we asked for a fork 4 times. We never got the fork. One of the servers told us to ask someone else.  The other location is much better"}
{"text":"The food isn't too bad.  It's Japanese food all you can eat.  Just be careful you don't order too much.  You can't finish it all if you do.  The sashimi could be fresher.  Desert was ok."}
{"text":"I appreciated the small size of the rolls,  and how they weren't over stuffed with rice.   The service was not the fastest but it was ok.  Some of the items were a hit and miss.  The mixed fried rice was a miss,  very stale and flavourless.  The noodle soups were suprisingly great!  Most of the rolls were good too.   The price for weekend dinner AYCE was about $36.  I've been to better sushi places, but this wasn't the worst,"}
{"text":"I went for the lunch AYCE today. First thing I noticed was the horrible smell of bleach and some sort of detergent. Not off to a good start. Then I was greeted by an extremely rude host at the front.   Their hot foods were better than their sushi/rolls. The Shrimp tempura and Matsuda shrimp was the highlight of the meal. Other than that the other cooked food was alright, nothing special or memorable but it didn't taste bad per se.   The rolls were definitely a miss. Sizes were off, rice was falling off and it was still hot. I only had about 2 pieces of sushi since I don't like eating raw fish on hot rice.  I do love their choices of desserts, I think I had everything on the menu and they all tasted good.   All in all, I probably wouldn't come back to this place for the rude host and mediocre food."}
{"text":"Horrible service with a zombie wait staff and an aloof and indifferent hostess to match. We called to make reservations only to wait an extra 20 minutes after being lied to over the phone about an available table.  Food was below average with several disgusting  highlights: frozen white tuna sashimi, over fried pork and overly salty terriyaki sauce.  If you enjoy being angry and hungry, this is definitely the place to come. Else, save yourself the hassle and get better sushi at your closest 7-Eleven."}
{"text":"Food is absolutely amazing but the service was pretty slow. But I would still come back just because the food is so good"}
{"text":"It's alright... similar to ten-ichi in terms of menu items, especially with the emphasis on mango sauce, the avocado seafood salad, the desserts, etc. Makes me wonder if they are from the same owner, but I doubt it. Matsuda seems to be on a bigger scale - a bit bigger with more staff. Some items took quite some time to come.. naturally we thought they had forgotten the order and re-placed the order.. however they eventually came in doubles! Oh well. The manager (or lady in a black blazer) was filling in everywhere as a hostess and server, and was very keen to catch any unattended customers. I would say 3.5 stars. I would come back if I was craving ayce. Generally though, I think I need to stop with the ayce.."}
{"text":"This is a chain restaurant. I've only ever been to the one on Middlefield/Steeles and this is definitely the better one. Went here on a weekend and was able to make reservations without any problems. Their menu is decent for AYCE, definitely recommend their specialty roles. Service was quick and they only missed 2 or 3 of our orders which is pretty good since other AYCE places always seem to miss half your order. Highly recommend this place for those nearby and craving some good sushi."}
{"text":"Great All You Can Eat sushi joint in Markham/Scarborough. Big place with plenty of seating. It is run by Chinese people but the quality is very high. Weekend prices are as expected but includes scallop sashimi and sweet shrimp sashimi. They have torched sushi and it is delicious. I would come back and would highly recommend to other sushi lovers."}
{"text":"Unfortunate to say... I will never come back to this place AYCE place...   They have Teppanyaki AYCE, it's about $60 per person..   They give you 3 rounds of cooking... first round is to try everything, second and third round, you order what you felt tasted good.. the regular menu is unlimited ordering...  This AYCE place is bullshit.. I left this place not full.. wtf..  I ordered 20 pcs salmon sashimi to start as an appetizer.. took like 30 minutes to come and only 5 pcs came..  Ordered another 20 pcs salmon sashimi, same bullshit..  At the end of the night, I had like 15 pcs of salmon sashimi, when my initial appetizer order was 20 pcs..   My friends asked me if I was full.. and I kept on saying none of the food i order came.  Same bullshit with the shrimp, kalbi, duck breast, sirlion, any whatever else you order, less then half of what you order will come.. total Bullshit!  Then your time is up and you get a bill...   Food quality was also so-so, the chef wouldn't even serve my my beef rare, cuz he knew it was shit quality beef..  This place is total bullshit!"}
{"text":"Decided to have lunch here.  It is AYCE that you order on a tablet.  It was lunch time so no sashimi.  They still had a good selection.  The food was okay but nothing extraordinary.  However the deserts, especialy the deep fried banana, were delicious.  Is it somewhere I will return, not sure."}
{"text":"Another standard ayce Japanese near my in laws'. After going to other ayces where we placed our orders through an iPad, I was reminded of the pain it was to have to wave down our server to submit and check on our orders every single time at Matsuda. Although there were multiple staffs who brought out our foods, we were only allowed to order with our assigned server. She never volunteered her time to check on our table; we had to get the other staffs to find her for us. By the time our second order was served, there was a 30 minutes of sitting/waiting around in between.   Foods - mediocre at best. All the shrimp items were heavily preserved with msg. The tempura and fried times were cold when served. Sushi and sashimi took at least an additional 30 minutes after all the hot foods were brought to us. The sweet shrimp sashimi were strangely dry and salty. The best item of the night coming from an ayce Japanese was unfortunately its ginger steamed milk. The ginger taste was distinct and the dessert for the majority of the time was served hot. Forget about mediocre sushi and sashimi, I chose to fill my stomach with multiple orders of this instead.   Overall - save your money for a la carte restaurants instead. I can guarantee you that there are many greater options in GTA!"}
{"text":"We had AYCE lunch on a weekend. In a nutshell, the price is expensive for lunch AYCE, and the sushi is just a bit above average. What sets Matsuda apart from other AYCE places is that most of the kitchen items had some care put into it, unlike most other AYCE places. I just don't think that the price is well-justified.  The rolls we had were okay and are the usual variations you see. The deep fried rolls we weren't a fan of, nor the mango roll with the mango puree to top. The unagi sushi and salmon rose were made well. The Japanese potato salad tasted quite good and some attempt was made to decorate it nicely.  Save room for dessert. The yogurt and puddings that come in small cups are tasty.  It was hard waving someone down to take our order and our orders come out randomly long after our order had gone in. It's really a guessing game trying to figure out if you still have any dishes coming out. Sometimes we get the wrong dish as well.  Wifi password is matsuda88"}
{"text":"Subpar AYCE Lunch Sushi Experience.  Food: There are some food items that were prepared well and many that were not. In general, I get the feeling that many foods were rushed and shortcuts were taken in to speed up preparation. The selection at lunch is quite poor compared to other places with limited availability of decent sushi rolls. The green salad was disappointing using thousand island dressing from a bottle. The sushi rose was hard and not fresh, though the presentation of the rose is nice. I wonder if they're made in advance? The spicy salmon sushi was good.  The chef's recommendation rolls were average at best. The rainbow roll was small and lacking in fish. The mango roll had a thick mango sauce on top as substitute for real mangoes. The volcano and sunshine roll had deep fried fish. There was absolutely nothing special about the special sauce in the volcano roll (I believe it's just eel sauce...).  The soba set is different - comes in a tray the same way you'd get it in Japan and comes with a raw quail egg for you to put in the soba sauce (Tip: Egg in sauce, dip soba noodles in sauce and eat). Grilled beef skewer, Matsuda Golden Shrimp and sirloin steak were good. Somehow, the sirloin roll wasn't good (!) and the Takoyaki (\"Grilled Cuttlefish Balls\") were dome-shaped - someone forgot to flip them! The korokke (\"Japanese Hashbrown\") was too thin and didn't have enough creamy potato filling.  There were many dessert options but they were all typical of AYCE sushi places and couldn't repair the bad impression. Mango yoghurt and mango puddings in small cups, buffet-quality mousses, and ice cream. Deep-fried banana was good and recently deep-fried.  Service: Service is non-existent. The servers don't seem like they're empowered to respond to your requests (\"I ordered 12, not 4\" \"Ummmm...\" *walks away*) and don't tell you what the food is before dumping it on the table. Another server cleaning up dishes knocked over the drink menu into our spicy salmon sushi and didn't notice/left the menu in the sushi. Worst of all, a service charge is already included in the receipt (though at least they had the courtesy to tell you so).  tl;dr Can't find any reason to come back again for lunch. It's also not cheap ($15.99 weekday lunch, $16.99 weekend lunch + mandatory service charge)."}
{"text":"Went in for lunch on a Monday, first time there. Big massive place with nice decor. Hostess was very cold and uninviting, but I'm white and had construction clothing on so I come to expect that type of greeting and nicer restaurants.   Food quality was spot-on but service was certainly lacking. They also \"forgot\" some of my order and I had to order 10 spicy salmon sushi to ensure I got 6. It seemed they were forgetting stuff to regulate how much I ate.   I had to pay a fixed amount ($17.39) for lunch with tax and tip included because \"the cashier wasn't in yet\" at 12:30. I found that odd.   Overall, more expensive than most AYCE sushi lunch spots but food was good. Service sucked and for what you pay, I don't think they offered good value. I would return if I was in the area, but wouldn't go out of my way to eat here.   P.S. As a separate note, I always find a group of people get better service if there's at least one Asian in the group (regardless if they can speak the language or not). I always get the worst service from Asian places when I go alone with work gear on."}
{"text":"My fav AYCE in the GTA! They have a cool ordering system. Each table gets a stack of mini printed menus that you tick off and submit. There is an amazing array of menu items from your basic sushi, tempura (of many kinds - yam, onion, shrimp, mushroom, etc) and teriyaki. I was surprised to see the very trendy scorched sushi available. There are many teppanyaki options as well and other grilled items like eggplant and shrimp, An individual item of note is a really interesting eel and banana maki roll. There's also many noodles and soups to order - one noteworthy one is the fish head soup. My favourite for dessert is the fried banana with chocolate sauce. This actually isn't found on the dessert sheet so look out for it under the fried section. Speaking of dessert, there are a lot of ice cream flavours (not just stuck with green tea) and a ton of other options like mango yogurt, ginger milk, mousse, etc. Come hungry and you'll be so very happy!"}
{"text":"The quality of the food here is meh, there many better AYCE places in scarborough/markham. The service is like any typical AYCE restaurants, when its round 3, they stop coming around unless you hunt them down."}
{"text":"The food is great at this place. Its all you can eat sushi so you can't really go wrong here. I have been here a couple of times and I have no complaints about the food. The layout is nice but I noticed that they were storing some drinks under the customers chairs.   I also don't agree with the weekend prices. We paid close to $70 on a saturday night for 2 people at an all you can eat resturant. During the week its not even close to being that expensive. The wait staff there was ok but they kept bringing us ginger pudding and we never asked for it. We would always send it back and then 10 minutes later another  one would show up   I would recommend eatting here just stay away from it on the weekend the prices are way too high"}
{"text":"The taste of the sushi was acceptable as far as all you can eat joints go. The only problem is actually getting your food. When every single sushi order gets reduced by less than half, and some don't even show up regardless of asking again and again, the irritation makes you forget what you're eating altogether."}
{"text":"I personally dislike going to all you can japanese places since its quantity over quality. But since i was dragged in by friends, I had to come to this establishment. I do say I was pleasantly delighted that the food is not great but acceptable for an all you can eat place.   If you like all you can eat places, its a 4 star If you dont, its a 3 star"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed our experience here recently. I love AYCE...bang for the buck. It reminded me a little bit of Spoon and Fork. The decor was nice. I remember coming here a few years ago and it was a different restaurant.   Service was wonderful & they always came back to check on us. Our orders came quickly and they did not mess up anything (aka forget). We also got a complimentary special dish w/ mushrooms and sake. Yummy !   Some of my favs were... Matsuda Sushi Pizza - nicely fried, bite size small portion (order more!) Spicy Salmon Sushi Pizza  Cheese dumpling - :D  Cheese Oyster - Super tasty.... I ate 4 ! I guess everything is good with cheese on it!  The sashimi was fresh & placed on ice so it would remain cold for a little while. The rolls were generally good but not spectacular.  I would definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"This place was surprisingly good, and I would say better than the Steeles/Middlefield location. Just the past Sunday around 8:45 p.m., we made a last-minute reservation for 9 people. We arrived at 9 and still had to wait a good half hour to be seated. I'd highly suggest making reservations ahead of time no matter which part of day, especially on weekends. I was surprised to see this place so packed on a Sunday night with customers continuously walking in after 9.   Food-wise, everything exceeded my expectations. All the small things and tiny details made this place a 4-star. The beef rolls with enoki mushrooms was cooked to perfection- which is often not the case. For once it's not overcooked and didn't taste like rubber. We had to order a few rounds! Loved that tako wasa was on the AYCE menu- wasabi was overpowering though. Sashimi was fresh. Chicken wings weren't the normal kind but seasoned like Taiwanese popcorn chicken. The batter of fried food was served crispy and hot- shrimp tempura was impressive.   Most important thing- 98% of our order came quickly and ACCURATELY! And with the forgotten order, we just reminded the staff and they were fast to respond. Service here was great and they were attentive to our needs. I'll be visiting for another round of AYCE!"}
{"text":"Sadly this place is closed. Go to taco bell instead, the pepsi taste better there. The ice isnt even cold ice here. I got diarrhea for days"}
{"text":"I would give it 0 stars if I could. This is for service/management: - very slow and often missing items - certain items never arrive - when ordering sashimi, they always gave less than ordered - gave us attitude when we requested specific number of sashimi slices - I had a bit of rice left on plate. They wanted to charge us extra for leftover food, or we must clean our plates completely  - manager giving us the stink eye often when looking over at us  I have never seen such rude service, and unreasonable enforcement of \"leftover food fee\". They also applied service charge on our bill.  Stay away."}
{"text":"Shitty service. Waited 45 minutes for my food that never came. They only brought 2 dishes I ordered. I don't have time for this shit."}
{"text":"Good all you can eat sushi restaurant.  Pros -  so many options and variety. So many desserts to pick from Con - loud, hard to order, service is very poor"}
{"text":"Safest lunch ayce in the hood. Best chicken wings i ever had in an ayce. The quality sometimes changes unfortunately on some cooked items on salt on food. I would order sirloin steak first batch really good second bland..... Place is big too which is good!"}
{"text":"Been here years ago and then recently went back.   when I first went here I was amazed at the fast service and the quality of the sushi, not sure if it was just an off night when I went a couple months ago but it was like night and day. They were constantly mixing up the orders, and the server was not helpful at all. They were missing stuff from our orders and it took them forever to bring out our food. The quality of the sushi was not so great, and the sashimi was cut too thick and I am not saying I am an expert by any means, but I personally don't like my sashimi thick.   I mean i wish I could write more positive things but the last experience left a sour taste in my mouth, literally.  I will be constantly checking for new reviews on this place, to see if i should try it one more time, and if i do try it again, i will re-review!"}
{"text":"I do not know why I keep giving this place another try. I've been going to \"Matsuda\" since I was 15 years old, at the location next to T&T. It is quite unfortunate that the service at this Don Mills location NEVER FAILS to disappoint me. The food is great though, good job sushi chefs.   However, every time I come here there's always at least one rude worker. The overall service is extremely slow and disorganized. I came to Matsuda tonight, April 6th. I have a very specific complaint to make. I was originally going to confront them there, but did not want to make a scene in front of my family. I understand this place is busy, but that is no excuse to be blatantly rude to PAYING CUSTOMERS. I've worked in the restaurant industry for years and I completely sympathize with workers when it gets busy, but it's never okay to treat customers the way they did. First of all, my parents are old. They are sometimes forgetful, and sometimes don't know how to communicate well. The waiters/waitresses were very impatient with them, and actually ignored them several times or walked away when they were still speaking. They also had a look of annoyance every single time we would place an order. This is all you can eat isn't it? Another downside is that they do not have pieces of paper to fill in for the all you can eat option. Instead we wrote on a blank paper the menu item #, the item name itself, and the amount. For some strange reason that wasn't sufficient and each time our order was taken, we had to either look through the menu to point it out to them or repeat it several times. The ordering system is problematic because: it was disorganized (kept messing up our orders) and was not efficient whatsoever. No exaggeration here. Legitimately every single time we ordered, there would be something wrong. Either they would insist we ordered something we in fact did not, or they would forget something. I think we had to tell them at least 2+ times each time we needed something (i.e. spoon, shrimp, etc.). The service was so incredibly slow it was unbelievable. I wasn't as full as I normally get from all you can eat, that's how slow the service was. I had no choice but to eat a little at a time with huge breaks in between because that's how they brought our food to us.   My specific complaint is towards one of the waitresses. I did not get her name but she had red ends to her hair that was tied into a bun. She was VERY rude, I felt uncomfortable throughout my dinner. Not a friendly environment. I called out \"excuse me\" politely, many times to her - which she ignored. She definitely heard me too, and walked right past our table, obviously ignoring my calls. Then I raise my voice significantly and she FINALLY turns around and acknowledges me with some hand gesture. She did not even bother coming back to us. In no circumstance should a customer be treated this way.   Good food, but if you want to fully enjoy yourself please save yourself the trouble and go next door to Gonoe or something."}
{"text":"We went today for lunch today, while the food was good. The service was bad.  The lady who served us didn't give us half the food, and half of the food that did come were wrong.  The second round I ordered from her, I said my order and had to repeat every single item back to her again because she was so confused. And some of the items I ordered from her, she didn't understand what I was saying, even though that's the item's name and it's even listed on the menu and I had to show her multiple items on the menu to show this, \"this is what I want\", it wasn't a great lunch.   Also, if they're going to add gratuity to the bill, shouldn't they had told me?   I honestly didn't didn't think she deserved the $5 tips, and since I didn't know she added tips to the bill again, the machine prompt me to enter tips again.  So in the end, she got way more tips than she deserved.   I was not happy."}
{"text":"The food at this place is truly Epic. Always fresh, always tasty. It is busy and a great atmosphere. The staff are friendly and helpful. They offer both sushi and cooked dishes.  I would recommend this restraint to anyone from the sushi beginner to the expert.  Enjoy. You will be glad you went."}
{"text":"Had their all-you-can-eat dinners. Its not bad and they have more interesting selection than the typical California Roll and Salmon Sashimi. Service was fine but when they get busy it gets slow. Price is comparable with other all-you-can-eat Japanese restaurants."}
{"text":"Food is.... Good. That's the only reason I give three stars and not two. Service is consistently terrible. We used to go quite a bit cause it's the only decent AYCE around us. The service always leaves a bad taste in our mouths though. We went just today and our waitress disappeared after a short time... and NEVER resurfaced. I had to get up from the table to get someone's attention to order dessert and get the bill. That's not the first time I have done that there."}
{"text":"it was ok, nothing special.  Service was slow at times, but the servers trying their best i guess with a non ipad system.  Tempura was very starchy and chicken wings was very peppery...  Sushi was ok, either than the salmon rose, the other sushi barely had any fish on them..."}
{"text":"Second favourite Japanese AYCE.  - The best sushi rolls - A little on the pricey side ($30 after tips and tax i believe) - Wait time to be seated is crazy. Make sure to have reservation."}
{"text":"I feel like most AYCE are similar to each other. I've visited twice this year and service is still consistent. The food were fresh. Sirloin steak and roll are a must! I would recommend everyone to try their Snow roll- I can only find this at Maison du Japon (Artic Roll) but Matsuda offers the roll as well!  Paid $67 tax and tip included for 2 people :)  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I was never a huge sushi fan but if I am ever in a craving, matsuda would be the place I'd go for sushi. Who needs to pay $10 for a dinky plate when you can pay $25.99 all you can eat?! That's my take on sushi.   We went on Friday at 5pm when it opens, so the place was empty. All good though because service was relatively quick.   They've got a huge variety. For those sashimi fans, they've got salmon, white tuna, surf clam, red snapper, and a couple of other types. The surf clam is pretty good and obviously the salmon is a win.   Definitely give the chefs recommendation on sushi rolls a try -- matsuda making, shogunate, and black dragon are all pretty good.   Say yes to the beef skewer...it is so juicy and flavorful, I had to order two plates. Oh and the matsuda golden shrimp is a lightly battered deep fried shrimp with a bit of mayonnaise -- ahhhhmazing.   Oh and the best part? MANGO YOGURT for dessert. They come in shot glasses so make sure to order a couple at a time. The mango pudding is not bad but it doesn't come with the milk :( I hear the green tea ice cream is good (although I've never tried).   The place is clean and they've got some nice Japanese tunes to bob to while you wait for your food. Waiters are always quick to take your dirty dishes and fill up on water. However if you do go during the weekend at around 7, it can be packed. You might be unlucky enough to have to wait for 10 minutes but it'll be worth the wait!   Your total cost of dinner includes a service charge so you don't have to tip, unless you want to add more to the tip included. So make sure you check the receipt!"}
{"text":"The service is horrible!!! We didn't make reservation on a Wednesday night and there were plenty of empty tables when we walked in but they did not seat us until AN HOUR and HALF later. I asked the hostess multiple times why can't we be seated at the empty tables. She actually yelled back at me saying \"WAIT!\" The food was OK. Again service is horrible because no one would come to the table to take our orders. The selection here is decent. The sashimi were good overall, except the octopus on the second order was still frozen. I would not come back again."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Never felt like i didnt eat anything after an all you can eat meal. Ordered sushi and took an hour and 2 complaints to come. Then manager told me they dont have anymore salmon and they used up yesterdays stock. So did that mean i got served a-day-old salmon in my first order?! Good thing i had good company and i still had a good chat. Otherwise it will be the worst experience ive ever had."}
{"text":"My first time at this location. Had the best service here for ayce! This is the best ayce sushi I have been to so far. Everything I had was really good and tasted fresh. They even had creme bule for dessert here too. I believe you also get 10% off if you pay in cash as well."}
{"text":"Horrible. Went for take out.. 930pm.. Restaurant not busy. Asked me to wait 5 min. Then please wait more.. Ended up being almost 25 min.  Horrible! Unacceptable.. I walked out. I will never go back. Hospitality at its worst."}
{"text":"3.5 stars   Matsuda is a bit of a hidden gem, located along Don Mills. If you didn't work or live in the area, you may not have discovered it before - but it's actually quite a decent AYCE spot.   Came here many times within the last year, and I was satisfied with all the visits. The food is prepared fresh and is quite tasty. One of my favourite rolls is the sunshine roll which includes cooked salmon and spicy mayo - so good!   They have a lot of variety like many AYCE places - definitely on par with contenders in the area. You can definitely taste freshness and thoughtfulness that is put in the food.   However, the loss of stars is due to the service which can be a bit slow. I usually came here for lunch during workdays and was able to make it back to the office within an hour, but it would be better if you had more time and not rush your meal.   In all a solid AYCE place!"}
{"text":"I dont usually go on Yelp to write a review, but this place had my balls fired up. The food was great but the service was ridiculous. We were given only 3 menus when there were 5 of us. We paid $30 plus bucks for dinner when the jumbo shrimp NEVER CAME!! Honestly it was already dessert no signs of shrimp. Like WTF. We told 5 waiters and none could give us a straight answer. The ORDER SYSTEM ALSO SUCKS! Like why not have us write our orders down instead of the servers do it. Youre giving extra work to them by going around the table.  Again the food was great. Id recommend it to a hungry diner but dont ever order their slimy bubblegum flavored green tea ice cream. Gross."}
{"text":"The service here is pretty bad, the waitresses and waiters seem pissed off when you ask for something which leaves a bad taste in my mouth. The food is somewhat decent (sushi and dessert) with the noodles being a huge downfall (don't order there). If I was the one who paid I'd honestly give little tip. We were the only group there for a while and they still managed to ignore us for a while. What a waste."}
{"text":"Been to this place twice, both times the service was extremely slow and food took forever. We literally had to order sashimi 3 times before it came out. There were missing orders and we continuously had to reorder items!! Never returning here, there are plenty of AYCE sushi, this place must've been the slowest and bad service. Food was mediocre."}
{"text":"Very modern interior. The 5 of us dined with a baby in a large booth on the left side. Awesome table with lots of room for dozens of tiny plates.   We arrived after work at 6:30PM. No trouble getting a seat, as there were plenty of seats available. Service was great... In the beginning. Waitress was able to keep up with our choices as we went through the extensive menu.  Each item came out one after the other in short amount of time. We were instantly questioning ourselves if we ordered too much (which we did not of course).  Sashimi came on ice which was great to keep nice and cold. All sushi and maki was served on wooden platters which made it feel like a fancier AYCE restaurant.   When it came down to our second round of food, the waitress was again, very attentive and took our orders quickly. Soon afterwards, the service started to crumble.  Food came out at adequate times, but once it came time to order dessert no one was to be found. The restaurant was at about 50% capacity on a Wednesday night and we were only able to see 2 waitresses taking orders. There were plenty of servers running food to tables.  It took us a good 20 minutes to try to order dessert. Desserts were typical, mousse, yogurt, ice creams. Nothing too outstanding. On the weekends they offer creme brûlée which is nice.   Would I return? Maybe for date night..."}
{"text":"I've been here on two occasions. Once with two others after a quick doctors appointment (which is right next door) and once with the whole family (15+ reservation).  I feel as if this place has the same owners as Ten-Ichi (Sheppard & McCowan) as they have the same delicious mango yogurt that everyone can't seem to get enough of. They even the same waiters. (Yes I've eaten at Ten-Itchi that many times to know the waiters' faces).  Anyways, it's got an average lunch menu (I have yet to go for dinner, but I have avoided AYCE dinners because they're too pricey nowadays). I just cant justify paying $25 before tax and tip for something I can order for $10 less during lunch time.   I gave 3 stars, but 1 extra for the \"Golden Fried Shrimp\"- literally like tempura but tiger shrimps with spicy mayo. Must try if you love tempura."}
{"text":"I was here with just my girlfriend on a Friday night. this place is usually packed so expect to wait. Even if you book a reservation for a certain time you might not get seated when you arrive because it'll be full. How they seat guests waiting in queue is - reservation, no reservation, reservation ...etc- so it's a fair for people who arrive a bit earlier than those who reserved. We were soo hungry so we were a bit antsy to get stuffing but this system is fair. It really just depends on the customers who just sit there and talk and not order something when they know so many people are waiting to eat. it's a douche and inconsiderate move. Anyways...  Food was amazing. any of the maki rolls are yummy and they don't kill u with rice. tempura is a bit over fried but i've seen worse. dessert are aplenty (I think my GF tried all of them). Best part is that you can enjoy your meal and not rush eating because they don't shove the bill in your face and stop asking if u want to order anything else after an hour. There a few jap AYCE in Markham that do this but I don't point any fingers.   Although dinner is around $30 / person (including all taxes and tips) I'd recommend this place for special occasions or whenever you want great food, relaxing atmosphere and good service."}
{"text":"A very busy AYCE sushi spot with an extensive menu. Food and service were both great. However they do occasionally miss some items on big orders."}
{"text":"Bad service.. food isn't that good, never coming back - DO NOT recommend."}
{"text":"Teppenyaki dinner was awesome!!!  Is the best sushi AYCE in the Don Mills area.   The teppenyaki works like this:  1) There's two menus; Teppenyaki and regular AYCE. The Teppenyaki menu, you order limited AYCE selection, meaning you can order such things as Fried Scallop, Fried Salmon Head, etc.  2) Teppenyaki chef will come to your cook table approximately 30 - 45 mins. depending on how busy the place is. They will cook tofu, shrimps, vegetables and mushrooms, salmon, turbot, short ribs, steak, duck, and fried rice. When the chef finish cooking, if your like me, you can opt for round 2. I would say the duck is the best!  Moist, succulent, and tasty, the soya sauce on the duck is wonderful!  I had 4 orders of those ducks.  It is that good!  Sashimi was fresh, the cut was thick and tastes delicious!  No disappointment there. Most AYCE lacks consistency when you order the same thing the second time but not this place. Surprisingly their Salmon Rose is to die for. Really really nice!  The mayo compliments the salmon really well.   All of their Sushi Maki is fantastic. I don't order too much of those because the star of the dinner is Teppenyaki - that's just my advice.   Another advice is tip the chef. They will remember you when you come again and they'll throw in extra stuff (wink). Also be nice to the manager, he'll get you exactly what you need.   Great night!  We all came out stuffed like a turkey.   Food:  5/5 Service:  5/5 Ambience:  5/5 Cleanliness:  5/5"}
{"text":"Okay, I'm giving it a 4 mostly because of the price of $28.99 (weekends - Adult). MAN! Since when did it becomes expense to pig out and eat to your heart's content??  Anyways, moving past the price point....I normally go to the one on Steeles, but it's ALWAYS jammed packed with people. This location has it's own parking lot, so you don't need to fight with anyone to get a space. The restaurant wasn't as crammed and we were seated quickly (LOVED that!). The service here was quick too, another point to Matsuda! It's clean and it's got a sleek decor vibe, but the atmosphere is a bit more exclusive/snobby/posh compared to the Steeles location (the dimmed lighting didn't help either...I wanna see my food!!).  The food here is DELICIOUS! Of course, we took pictures of our food with the presentation. The beef skewers here are so juicy, it's ridiculous. The sashimi here was sliced thicker than other places I've been to, another point!  IF you can get past the price point, I'd say this is the place to go whenever you've got your sushi cravings. I'm still on the hunt for a go-to sushi place, so here's to eating to your heart's content (aka sleeping as soon as you get home)!"}
{"text":"My family and I booked reservations to eat here over the Christmas break. When we arrived there 10 mins before the reservation time, we had found out they had given away our table. They tried to call us but could not pick up the phone because I was driving. After complaining, all they could do was give us 4 pitchers of free soda.   The service is also incredibly slow, takes about 15-20mins to get your food after each order. It's smart on their part because it gives you time to digest your food.  The reason I give 2 stars is because their food wasn't too bad, although their sashimi is served on a pile of ice and sometimes it's still frozen."}
{"text":"One of the better tasting AYCE for sushi. I have been going to this place for years now. The food quality is consistently exceptional. They have a large selection of variety and is always packed during dinner hours so always reserve during a holiday or weekend if you don't want to wait. The price is a bit on the higher side and also keep in kind they include tips on the bill."}
{"text":"GINGER MILK DESSERT SOLD OUT by 8pm on a Friday night. NOT ACCEPTABLE! Don't charge a premium for specialty items that are only available on Fridays to Sundays, then tell me you're sold out. I know it's just one item but it happened to be the MAIN item I was looking forward to. Just demonstrates poor management and preparation. The server told me it's a very popular item and that's why it's sold out already. Matsuda isn't a new establishment, they should have known to stock up on it or have a contingency plan. I am really disappointed because Matsuda has always been one of my favourite AYCE sushi places and in honesty, one of the better AYCE sushi restaurants out there (reason why it's not 1 star). However, factoring in the cost ($35.99 for teppanyaki), the slow service, and this incident makes me feel like it's time to look for other options or just stick to a la carte.   Food: 3 stars  Came here for teppanyaki with friends but actually not a big fan of it (good if you're an avid carnivore). Though I will admit the meat was pretty good overall for AYCE. The ribeye steak was a but of a hit-and-miss. I had one really good piece, then the others were a not as tender but still good. Chicken was WAY better the last time I was here. Not sure what happened. Didn't eat that much sushi since the teppanyaki part is quite filling. Chopped ika sushi is pretty good. Sashimi was good but the sweet shrimp and beef tataki were still kind of frozen and we had to wait to let it thaw a bit. Squid sashimi was unique. It comes coiled around some cucumber but I don't really like the slimy texture too much. I heard praise of their steamed egg from a co-worker but didn't try it.   Ambiance: 3 stars Only been to this location for teppanyaki so I've never sat around the rest of the restaurant but overall, it's pretty noisy (very busy on the weekends). Teppanyaki area is nice and everyone gets front row seats to the chef but it's hard to really share sushi and other items in that layout.   Service: 2 stars They need to hire a hostess. I've been to this location only twice but both times, there was no one at the door to greet me or even just get me to my reserved table. I always had to wait and eventually get fed  up with waiting and wave down a waitress who will then go get someone else to come help me.  Our server who took our order and the teppanyaki chef were pleasant enough. Orders do take a while to come but like I said, it's busy, so I'm sure they're trying to get stuff out asap...or they're just understaffed (an extra hostess???)."}
{"text":"Beautiful spot. Went around 6:30pm and reserved a spot for 20 spots. Got pretty busy, understandable since it was a Saturday night. Personally I love the iPad sushi spots but don't mind the server asking if we're ready to order.  The cons were we would have to wave down the server each time we wanted to order, and didn't see our original server till the end. Probably seen him 3 times in 3 hours. The servers we waved down didn't know how to take down the orders, and also didn't get some items that we ordered. That's also a con of the pen and paper order  The pros were they had some great food, out of everything the chicken skewers, the unagi fried rice were my favourite had amazing flavour  Would I come back again? Probably not, the goal was to eat but waving down our server was an obstacle after the 7 times we ordered"}
{"text":"Very busy on Saturday night.  Lineup to get a table.  Can't really explain it because the service was poor and the food was very ordinary.  We were given an incomplete menu from which to order to start things off.  Then we didn't get everything we ordered and the food that we did receive was brought in absolutely no logical order.  Food that was ordered when we were first seated, arrived as we were about to leave.  At other times, there were long gaps when we waited for our food.  The quality of the food is par for an AYCE restaurant but the flavours are far from authentic Japanese.   It's not bad but it isn't Japanese.  On the plus side, is an extensive menu with lots of choices and decent parking."}
{"text":"It's ok at best. Nothing special. Still on the hunt for best ayce sushi. Yokohama is still our number one."}
{"text":"Matsuda has a very nice decor, dim lights, comfortable seating and a good atmosphere for dining. There was no wait on a Sunday evening in comparison to the other location where every time I went I had to wait for a table. They offer teppanyaki, but I only went for the AYCE. Their pricing for AYCE is on the more expensive side ($30/person on the weekend)  The service was great. Our server was always around and always swung by to clear the table of empty plates. The food was served in a timely manner and there were no missed orders.    I always thought Matsuda on Steeles was one of the better AYCE places around the area, and in comparison I think the two locations are pretty close in food quality. The sushi was average. I prefer the cooked food more. Definitely try the short ribs and the sirloin. What I like about this place is the small portions they serve to prevent wasting food. It allows you to try the variety they have to offer in maki rolls without feeling obligated to finish the whole roll, or feel bad for wasting food. This place serves 3-4 pieces rather than the whole roll of 6/8 pieces. I was disappointed that they didn't actually serve some of the items that were listed on the menu, such as the tofu cheese cake dessert -the server said they never had it at the restaurant.   Overall, this place is pretty average. There wasn't really anything that stuck out to me in good or bad ways."}
{"text":"Summary:  The food makes up for the service.   Good:  The quality of food is excellent for an AYCE; the sashimi was fresher than some non-AYCE Japanese restaurants I'd recently been to, and the garlic steak bits were very tender. On an AYCE scale, the quality is definitely top-tier among all similar establishments. The interior of the restaurant is nice-ish, too; not what you come for, but it doesn't hurt.   Bad:  Service is lacking, even for an AYCE spot. Turnaround on orders is slow and deteriorates considerably after two rounds; things eventually just stopped coming.   They're also quite stingy. You know how you can normally get around small serving sizes by multiplying the quantity ordered? At Matsuda, they still short-serve you regardless of how much you tell them you want. Portions just kept shrinking through the night with no regard for how much we ordered. The waitress even gave me an attitude when I asked for them to replicate portions that were initially served to us."}
{"text":"Don't come here, service is terrible and food takes way too long. Spent more than half the time waiting and food isn't even good."}
{"text":"Matsuda is my go-to spot for sushi when I'm in Markham!  You're looking at a higher price-point for ayce sushi tho. About $30 pp after tax and tips on weekends. But trust me, it's worth every penny.   The service is quick. Everything comes out fresh and hot, and they don't purposely slow down the food because they're afraid you won't finish.  They have a wide selection for sashimi and during the summer, they would occassionally serve sweet shrimp, which is typically rare for any ayce sushi places since a la carte usually charges $5 for 3 slices. When I went last weekend, they served scallop sashimi which is never heard of in ayce sushi places. During the weekdays, they also serve their pan-seared salmon sashimi.  Their mango rolls and yoghurt is a stolen recipe from ten-ichi it's just as good, if not, better. I can't give them any credit for innovation but MANGOOO ON EVERYThiNG...shall i say more?  Another menu item that WILL blow you away is their garlic stir-fried sirloin steak... Make sure you double or triple order because you WILL want more after!  Make sure you arrive early and if you're coming with a party, RSVP! It does get hectic over the weekend, but no matter how crazy they get, you never have to wait too long for food or wave a server down.  Matsuda definitely deserves more than than the mediocre 3.5 stars given by so many Yelper friends."}
{"text":"Service was pretty bad at this restaurant even with the iPad ordering. We only had a table of 2 so I don't know what the heck was wrong with them. Half of our first order came after 30 minutes, the other half was lost. Our first order miso soup didn't come until an HOUR after. The food was mediocre at best and just wasn't worth it for the price. The desserts were unique and good though."}
{"text":"Worst dining experience ever. The waiters are very bad and annoying. First time, i refused to pay tips. Won't ever go back again!!"}
{"text":"This is a review mainly for their Teppanyaki. We chose the ayce Teppanyaki menu because we were interested in trying many things for a few bucks more. How it works is you get 2 rounds of whatever and however much of Teppanyaki. This means the gentleman will put on a show only twice. You can order from the ayce menu indefinitely and it'll be brought over.  Highlights of Teppanyaki menu were the ribeye steak which was juicy and succulent. Their seafood was a big hit surprisingly and hands down my favourite! Loved the jumbo shrimps, salmon filet, and cuttlefish dipped in lemon soy sauce. Their wild mushrooms and mixed veggies were a nice break from the meats & fish. If you're a fan of tofu (i'm not), order it because they do a nice little jiggle on the flat iron grill. We ordered dessert off the ayce menu. The blueberry mousse, chocolate mousse, creme brûlée, tiramisu, red bean and green tea ice creams were yummy.  It was very busy Saturday night which is probably why the servers didn't top up our water and forgot some of the items we ordered. But they brought them over quickly when we pointed it out. It's a bit pricey but you're getting both dinner and a show. It'd be a nice choice for a celebratory dinner, since it's got a pretty ambience and a cool experience to match."}
{"text":"Their beef sirloin was reeeeally good, surprisingly. And the sashimi quality was good, especially the octopus, scallop and sweet shrimp. However even though we ordered a large portion of sashimi every time, we always got really little. That was kind of annoying. The pressed sushi was not as good as other places I've had it."}
{"text":"Food is good, better quality than most all you can eats... But the service is terrible. We ordered 4 times and they brought out like one item from each order. We had to complain in order to get all our food brought out."}
{"text":"Matsuda is a solid 3/5. Decent AYCE, but pretty generic. If you're close and are craving AYCE sushi, come here. If you're far, don't bother. Go anywhere else. ITS AITE, there i saved you from reading all the other reviews."}
{"text":"Management is really bad. Waste of time and money. They tell each customer the food is coming when it's not."}
{"text":"Really poor service. Food is ok. Orders never arrive. You should probably avoid this place."}
{"text":"The variety of food here is the reason I kept coming bad. Sometimes the service is slow, but overall staff is ok. The quality of the food is not very stable, 80% of the time is good."}
{"text":"Nope nope nope. Slow service. Shrimp had a distinct frozen taste. Beef wasn't tender. Dirty plates cups utensils. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"If u have a large appetite and want savoury quality food, come here. If u are a big boi who likes to bulk up, come here. If u are a big boi, who feasts like a beast, then it's worth the price. If u are a dainty, cute wittle, wussy, eater, wanting high-dining bites, sorry this ain't for u!   I love the setting- it's spacious, airy and chilled (great for my hot-blooded, smouldering soul). The craftsmanship on the dishes is excellent and consistent for EVERY order. (My stomach is a deep and vast bottomless pit). Solid experience. As well if u are a natto fan, or a first time natto eater, u will love it- it's seasoned nicely here.  Big Boyz only! This establishment deserves dueces!"}
{"text":"This was the worst restaurant I've been to. The quality of the fish was terrible and the service was terrible. The fish did not taste fresh, and they kept dragging out our orders. We had to wait 30 minutes for one sashimi or sushi order. Also, the servers kept giving us wrong orders! It was so frustrating because they would bring food items that we didn't order (like ice cream even though we just started eating) and insisted that it was our order. Lastly, when I got home that night, I had a major stomach ache and had diarrhea twice!!!!! I will never be returning to this restaurant. Ever."}
{"text":"Yeah.. never again. Honestly, for food, sushi tasted so good, esp. the crispy roll & the spicy salmon roll, and for dessert, strawberry ice cream (tasted way better than what you would get at reg. ice cream parlours/grocery stores.   However, the service was horrifying!! Three of my friends and I decided to go for lunch (yes, we knew it would be busy). Our first waitress was extremely rude (e.g. when we asked her for straws & forks), thank god we got another waitress. She was nice, but she was definitely confused. We sort of felt bad for her. A bunch of waiters were helping, yet we kept getting dishes that we did not order, probably around 6-7 dishes. After a while, they even checked the paper and realized they were wrong.   The food was alright, not the best. I can't lie, the sushi was good!! Also, the dessert was pretty bad OMG! The mango pudding, mango yogurt and tiramisu were not good, I definitely had better elsewhere. I would stick to the strawberry ice cream for dessert.  Let's just say, for an AYCE it's not the best place. I rather go to Tatami. 2 stars because our second waitress was kind and helpful & the sushi was good."}
{"text":"My all-time favourite AYCE sushi location. Wide range of choices, nice staff, quick service, great food. I would very much recommend a reservation as it tends to get busy real quick. The cherry on top of this place is the dessert! Love the mousse! Price is well worth it."}
{"text":"Food quality are excellent but the waiting time are horrible even you had reserved a table.. they do not have enough staffs working in weekend..."}
{"text":"Good food. Bad service. It took us almost 20min to get our order taken, 20 min for food to come and we ordered 3 times. We tried to minimize ordering cause the food came very slow and hard to find a server."}
{"text":"First off I would like to say that I was disappointing on the fact they didn't have many veggie/non fish eating sushi. They didn't have any beef rolls, chicken rolls, ect. Next I would like to say I had a bad experience with the teapot they gave us. I went to poor myself some tea and the top opened and splashed all over the table and myself. I am lucky that only a little of the tea fell on my lap because it was burning hot. Also I noticed the waitress never wrote down our order which from time to time we noticed we had to repeat certain items that we didn't get.   I really like the one roll I tried for the first time it was call the spicy crispy which is the tempura batter in the center of the sushi roll. Very unique. The restaurant was large and out table was extremely spacious. Also after my tea incident I decided to order a 7-up the waitress was kind enough to tell me the price before getting the order. Good Service on that point.  This happens to be my friends favourite sushi place so I am pretty sure I will end up here at some point again.. I will just have to be very careful when trying to poor myself a cup of tea!"}
{"text":"Making our way to the restaurant we discovered that Tako was out of business and replaced with a new sushi place Matsuda. Like a lot of new restaurants there was a lot of attention to style and design. The entrance was moved from the side to the front of the building facing out to Don Mills road. The entry consisted of lots of glass and a large Japanese drum. Behind this the actual restaurant was really dark with stone walls and lots of pinspot lighting. Along the back wall was the sushi bar with all the sushi chefs visible to the restaurant. There was selection of tables separated by short walls and a couple of teppanaki tables in separate rooms at the front of the restaurant. Before being seated we were asked if we were there for all you can eat, something that is being adopted by all sushi places across Toronto. Because none of us were that hungry we opted for the a la carte menu, but changed our minds when we saw the prices. The AYCE was priced at $ 28.00 dollars per person, with a la carte options priced seemingly to make the AYCE more attractive. So in the end we opted for the AYCE based solely on price.   The service was at time abrupt and other times just plain rude. Unlike other AYCE places where you order dim sum style on a sheet of paper, this place wanted you to order from the menu through the wait staff. This meant as customers you were dependent on the server coming back to the table and taking your orders. This would be fine if the service was attentive. Sadly, too often we had to flag someone down who then made us feel like we were making their life difficult. But as they say, the proof is in the pudding. Sadly, in the end, the food was disappointing and not worth the high price.  AYCE restaurants are never known for the quality of their food and my expectations were low, but Matsuda disappointed even these low expectations. Too often the food that arrived bore no relation to how it was described in the menu. The standout misnomer, was a golden scallop that turned out to be a tiny pumpkin soufflé with a small bay scallop hidden at the bottom of the ramekin. It was too say the least, odd. Another disappointment were the grilled Jumbo shrimps which turned out to be extra small shrimps. By the end of the meal we found ourselves, the absurdity of the place had us and the table beside us laughing at the place. There was nothing really to do but sit back and laugh at a place that will not last very long."}
{"text":"This is one of the better AYCE sushi place. They have a great selection of sushi, apps, grilled items, and desserts.  It does get very busy on weekend, specially on long weekend. Staff are polite, however, service can be hit or miss during busy time.  We have been here a number of times. We went again today on long weekend, they kept missing a few of your items.  Dessert selections are good. We like the ginger milk, mango yogurt, deep fried banana with ice cream. A lot of people like the different flavours of mousse but I'm not a fan. Weekend dinner is $27. If you're a regular, they give you a VIP card for 10% discount (dinner and cash only).  Overall, we will come back again if craving AYCE sushi"}
{"text":"As others have said, the service at Matsuda is lacking. I've only been here twice with the first time being two years ago. Everything seemed to be fine then, but having visited recently I doubt I would ever want to return.   I came with a group of approximately 13 people. We originally planned to eat from their set lunch menu (which was on their website), but was told that we could only have AYCE lunch. Since the group was mostly here at this point, we decided to just eat AYCE. We had to order multiple times in order to get our food and even then they either came in the wrong portions or not at all. The fish was cold, but the rice was warm which made a strange lukewarm combination for the sushi. Food for the most part was just average for an AYCE place.   At around 2:30, we sent in two orders since it was the last call before they closed for lunch. We only received our desserts, but not the order previous. We ended up speaking to a lady who told us that she would get our food shortly (they either forgot or weren't planning on giving it to us - probably the latter), and then it all started coming in. It would have been nice if the food had come before our dessert as most of us were pretty much full at this point. Our bill was given together and not split as we had requested.   With all the mishaps that happened during the meal, I am highly disappointed in the decrease of quality of this restaurant. I don't plan on returning."}
{"text":"To be honest, I really enjoyed the food. Everything tasted amazing and even the combination of the sushi were pretty outstanding. I really enjoyed the Philadelphia roll which I never tried before.   However that was the highlight, service was by far the worst for any sushi restaurant I have been. We arrived at 12:45 and quickly learned what terrible service this place had. They quickly seated us and offer the all-you-can-eat menu, when we asked for the bento box menu that took a while for them to find. We decided to go with the ayce because it had a lot of great options. We waited for 15 minutes, waiter walking by 4-5 times before serving us water and ordering our food. All our hot food came relatively quickly but when we asked about the sushi, their immediate response was, \"the whole restaurant is waiting for sushi, you are not the only ones\". This really rubbed us the wrong way so we decided to ask a different server who had the same response. It was close to 2pm before any sushi arrived at our table. For ayce place, it didn't feel like we ate a lot especially since we waited so long for sushi. This is rather disappointing. I would not recommend going there for lunch on a Friday. Service was slow and servers were not friendly.   My favourite dish was the golden shrimp which were very good, and it was deep fried in mayonnaise!"}
{"text":"One of the best AYCE sushi places I've gone to. Food is fresh and delicious. Quite large menu with a good variety.  Wait times during lunch hours were ridiculous as me and my friends waited a very very long time between rounds of sushi. Also, there were things we ordered multiple times that never came."}
{"text":"Price per person: $35 for weekend dinner Summary: a good all-you-cal-eat sushi buffet place, slow to get the food Recommend: mango yogurt, ginger milk, sashimi  A group of us went to this place on Saturday night. This place was very busy and it took us some work to make reservation. We ordered 2 rounds of sashimi. The quality of food in all-you-can-eat standard is not bad. The sashimi was pretty ok. small in size, but not bad. I love the dessert at this place: mango yogurt and ginger milk is a must-try. I had 4 mango yogurt and 3 ginger milk. Did I get my money back? Probably not, but denfinitely a good all-you-can-eat place."}
{"text":"Matsuda has been an AYCE establishment that has been standing for years within the GTA. They are quite large, with many seats and booths available to the customer and nice Asian decor. I've recently visited Matsuda again and can say they're still a great AYCE restaurant, but obviously for that experience it is a $35~ price tag.  Service: Lightning speed. It was insane. Within minutes of ordering we got all our dishes in 10-15 minutes. The servers were in traditional Japanese wear and were very nice and attentive. What I didn't like was their new system of ordering (I haven't been here in a long while) where you have to go through this thick book and pull out pages and then write what you want. I feel like a long sheet or iPads are a better experience. Not a huge deal though.  Food: I don't eat fish, so I can't comment on the sashimi, but it seemed like my friends liked it. It looked fresh and appetizing. Most of the food was very delicious and I was in heaven. One of the highlights was the Golden Shrimp. Soooo good. They also have a lot of options for every kind of eater, not just sushi and fish. As always, dessert time is one of the highlights of every Matsuda dinner, where you order over 20+ little cups for 4 people and it's a sight to behold.  To conclude, I walked out of Matsuda feeling like a content, bloated cow. I was very satisfied with my dinner and had no regrets. I would come to Matsuda more often if it were not the expensive price tag. 4/5."}
{"text":"Extremely slow service and the food that does come is just ok. The hot foods we ordered like the golden shrimp was good but felt warm as if it was sitting somewhere and was just thrown to us even though we sat in when the restaurant hours started. (approx 5pm) around 7 pm the place got packed and we could hear the complains from all around us but the staff did nothing. The tables even beside us had just as bad service as us. We ordered a dish when we first sat down and didn't get it until an hour later even after we asked many times about it. And it was just for a miso soup. which was very watered down. Sushi wise was ok. not terrible but not that great either. They also forcibly charge a 9% tip charge so really they just don't seem to care about serving you or working for a tip. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. It was a terrible experience and over priced. we came out paying 30+ each person for terrible service and sub-par food. Do not waste your money. there are plenty of better sushi restaurants out there."}
{"text":"Average food with average service. I came here for lunch and was disappointed they didn't have sashimi. Otherwise, it's very spacious and lots of parking."}
{"text":"Matsuda, formerly Tako Sushi, offers both an AYCE option (which is ludicrously pricey), and an à-la-carte menu. Not feeling particularly hungry, I went for the latter.  Sushi, unsurprisingly, is of the average all-you-can-eat variety, stressing fried seafood and strange mayonnaises over nuance. The few pieces of nigiri were uninspiring, as were the accompanying salad and miso soup.  In all, a quite standard Japanese place, albeit with slightly nicer décor than its predecessor. There are far better places (both Japanese and Western) in the area, so avoid unless absolutely necessary."}
{"text":"I had teppanyaki dinner here last night and overall the food was unsatisfactory so I won't be back any time soon. I already had a bad experience at the Matsuda at the Steeles location which I gave 2.5 stars to. However, I tried to have an open mind and enjoy the food.  The parking situation was a little iffy because they have about 10 spots at the front of the lot which were all full of course and the space at the back is all owned by a school which had \"Private Property\" signs all over. I'm sure it's extremely rare for someone to get their car towed there but I couldn't help but feel agitated thinking about it.  The service was much better than the other location because it was much less busier. To put a disclaimer though...the group I went with had regular customers so I feel that my opinion on their service would be heavily biased since I felt like they went out of their way to treat us better. However, I can say with confidence that they are not understaffed like the Steeles location. Orders were not missed and the overall atmosphere was better.  I found the menu to be lacking in variety compared to other AYCE restaurants for this price. The raw fish was not good enough even considering it is winter season so the quality in fish is worse than normal. The beef tataki was OK. I did not order any hand rolls. The sushi rolls were really mediocre. The tempura was way below average quality because the batter was bad and the sweet potato tasted strange. Their miso soup again was really mediocre. However, the fish/mushroom soup which came in a large pot they specially made for us (perks of going with regulars I guess) was delicious. The saving grace of the meal was the meat they used for the teppanyaki specifically the sirloin steak. It was high-quality, tender and cooked to perfection. The duck breast was not bad either. The dessert options are similar to the other Matsuda which all come in the small glass like mango yoghurt, jello and various mousses. Ice cream options were limited to vanilla, red bean, green tea and mango. I tried the mango one and it wasn't as good as the one at Ten Ichi but it did not taste cheap and overly sugary at least.  To sum it all up nicely, this Matsuda has better service than the Matsuda on Steeles but has worse food and vice versa. I would not go to either Matsuda's because there are much better options for Japanese AYCE for the same prices that do not falter in service and food quality."}
{"text":"2.5 stars.  I didn't expect the place to be so packed! We got seated a little while after our reservation time but I know the 20 or so people standing at the door weren't so fortunate. A server came by to our table to take our first orders when we haven't gotten a chance to look at the menu yet. There were clearly not enough servers for a fully packed medium-large sized restaurant so I felt lucky enough we got service so fast. Too bad the fast service didn't matter because half of our orders never came! We told the same server to check up on the food a good 20 minutes later and again, some of our orders were never came again. The rolls we ordered at the beginning finally came when we were already eating dessert. They definitely need to hire more staff on weekends and have a better system of keeping track of orders.   Some of the food were pretty good and some were just a fail for my standards. Here are some of my thoughts: Handrolls = rice way too soft, seaweed not crispy, felt really mushy Sashimi = the sweet shrimp was really underwhelming, some i could taste like it just came out of the freezer, standard AYCE quality Mango roll = my biggest disappointment, the one at Tenichi is miles better Tempura = a little too dry, otherwise average quality Steak cubes w/ garlic = on par with other AYCE places I've been to Kalbi ribs = not juicy, more on the dry side but it was marinated at least Jumbo grilled shrimp = one of the highlights of the night, full of flavour Agedashi tofu = good Zaru soba = the quality of the soba was better than i expected for an AYCE Unagi rice = very tiny portion of rice, good Udon = soup base had a ton of flavour to it, better than average Desserts = average quality  I usually don't order drinks which cost extra, but the watermelon juice was very good, albeit, a little pricey. I also loved how small the portions were because you get to try more variety of food.  So to summarize, I've been to other Japanese AYCE restaurants that charge a similar price but have gotten much better service and food. I will most likely not visit Matsuda on a busy night again simply because I don't like chasing for my orders to come. If you're more patient than me or don't mind this type of service, I guess the food isn't too bad to not give them a try."}
{"text":"Not going to lie and going straight to the point here. The food is really bland, no flavour whatsoever. They try to be creative here but it really isn't working out for them right. Such as adding cheese in dishes, which is normal for japanese restaurants here in the GTA, but they come out cold and stuck to other pieces of sushi. Other times food shows up cold or it just tasted really fishy (ie tempera). I at first was really intrigued by the lovely interior, the spacious seats as well as the friendly staff, but seriously the food was really disappointing"}
{"text":"The quality and presentation of the food was above average then most AYCE  resturants, the only downfall was the lack of waiters. I do not blame the 15 mins wait to get our order and the 20 mins wait to finally get our food because the food was amazing ! I give koodos to the staff it was a very busy night. If only they could get more servers or at least cordinate the staff then I will definitely be coming back. Hey Matsuda, have your at least 1 or 2 waiters serve one section/ row each. That is my advice to the restaurant."}
