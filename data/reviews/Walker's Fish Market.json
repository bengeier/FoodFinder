{"text":"PROS - very well renovated, great service, clean and modern dining. Great place to go for a nicer sit down dinner with friends. 

CONS - food EXTREMELY salty. Ordered Haddock & chips, and the wedges were too salty to finish. 

Overall - there are better restaurants to go to at this price point with better food."}
{"text":"This was our fourth visit to this location and we are yet to be impressed. My wife ordered the fish and chips and I had the ribs, wings and shrimp combo. The fish and shrimp we heavily over battered and under cooked leaving them mushy. The wings and ribs tasted ok but were nothing special, I have had similar tasting wings out of a box from the grocery store. The service was fine and the draught beer was excellent but I expect a lot better quality food from a restaurant at the prices they charge. 
Each time I have visited here I have ordered something different and, so far, the hamburger has been the best."}
{"text":"The food was excellent!!! Service was impeccable very good selection of fresh fish and seafood"}
{"text":"Excellent cuisine.  Varied and well presented.  Service very friendly and attentive.  Personal interest shown.  
We went for the Monday Shrimp fest and found a wide variety of shrimp dishes ranging from battered to spicy Cajun.  Each dish was tasty, well presented and of sufficient quantity.  The Killer Calamari appetizer was one of the best prepared calamari I have ever tasted.  The calamari was tender and flavourful.  The only negative I could see to the whole evening was that the table in the booth we were in was too narrow so that our legs were cramped. Decor was interesting and pleasant.  Will go again for sure.  Can't wait until next summer when the patio will be open."}
{"text":"I was out in Mississauga from the states for a business trip. It was a 2 week business trip. 1 week into the trip we discovered Walker's Fish Market and wish we could stay 2 more weeks so we can eat there more often! The food was delicious! Within the last week, we went back twice just to make sure we can get it in one more time.

What we had-
1) Nova Scotian  1/2 Lobster (5 stars!)
2) Chilean Sea Bass (5 more stars!)
3) Bread pudding (5 more stars!) + Tip (ask for a side of chocolate sauce/syrup)

Other Great Tips. They have appetizer specials! One day we went in and an appetizer that was $12 was only $5! Then on another day, it was 2 appetizers for $10 or 1 appetizer + 1 drink for $10! What a GREAT DEAL! I guess you need to call for details because each day is different?

4) Dynamite Shrimp (DELICIOUS! When we paid $5 for this, it was 5 stars. However, the regular menu price is $12 so I would say this becomes a downgrade of 3.5-4 stars.
5) Mussels (Awesome! 3.5-4 stars!)
6) Blue Crab Shrimp Cakes (4 stars!)
Oh what I wouldn't do to go back to this delicious restaurant! Yum yum yum!"}
{"text":"Would have gotten 5 stars a few months ago before I discovered Lucy's Seafood Kitchen which I definitely prefer (and it's not too far away). But totally different atmosphere so go here for a date night instead of Lucy's.
Reasonable prices for the food you get! Yum!"}
{"text":"I ate here about 3 months ago with a friend (I wanted to give this place  a chance)
Compared to other local sea food restaurants this was a disappointment. I had the lobster which was overcooked, and the vegetables which were undercooked. The wait staff here don't appear to be happy and I found the menu items overpriced as well.
I am surprised, I had been at there other locations and found the service and food much better. If you live in this area you may want to skip this place, and try something else!"}
{"text":"I went for dinner on a weekday and the restaurant was less than half full. The environment isn't bad for a business dinner or lunch. I wouldn't call it upscale, hip, or fun though. 

The wait staff was pretty bad. We had lots of wait time and she seemed so uninterested in doing her job. If anything, she spent more time talking to the bored looking chef than all the patrons combined in a 2 hour window.

From the menu, there's lots of variety to choose from but everything lacked in flavour. I had a salad to start and that wasn't bad.  The vegetables were fresh and the size was good.  The dressing tasted like Kraft but that's ok.  I had the tuna done in the Mediterranean style and it was the dullest and most boring tuna I've ever had. It was a huge slab (we're talking over 6 oz) that was grilled to medium but it tasted like cardboard. The couscous side was flavourless as well. It was a pretty disappointing meal."}
