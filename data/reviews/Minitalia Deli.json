{"text":"Food for lunch is very good.  That is when u can get it. Show up before noon and ur screwed. Out of specials out of pizza. Out of everything except lunch meat. So show up early can't understand when you know people will be why enough food is never made."}
{"text":"Update: The sandwiches came on fresh bread and the servings of both meat and cheese were MASSIVE!  Five stars up and down the board!  Note that the phone # has changed to (412)373-1473.."}
{"text":"Sandwiches yes. Outstanding yes.
Minitalia Deli is just a shell of its former incarnation as an Italian Grocery store. Most everything is gone except the Deli some fresh breads and a few other items.
However I can't say loud enough: Minitalia Deli Is an outstanding sandwich and Italian deli shop.
Don't look for anything else and you won't be disappointed. They have a good ten or fifteen predesigned sandwich combination with various interesting names. Try the Manhattan and the Park Avenue which are two of my favorites. During the weekdays they serve hot sandwiches also such as Meatball Hoagies and Hot Sausages, also some soups and chili.  If you get there right around lunch time you can expect a bit of a line to get your deli meats or sandwiches made. Also inside they have some seating if you want to eat there. Many local workmen stop in for their lunch here.
The service is pretty good with nothing fancy, just, 'what would you like and okay I'll make it for you right away\" kind of attention.
You will not be disappointed in the made to order sandwiches either.  Single or double meats, any kind of bread, cheese etc. I customize my own sandwiches here pretty often. I get them with lettuce, tomato and red peppers as a favorite.
 The meat, mostly Boars Head and the cheese is very, very fresh. Nothing sits around here very long without being devoured. Did I say that they pile the meat high, very high, so you have a fun challenge getting your mouth around it? 
Cash, sure. Credit Card yes, with a modern twist. Your receipt will come via text message or email, your choice. Really is kind of neat for a Deli.
Getting hungry for lunch? : have a great sandwich, Turner's Ice Tea and some chips.  Oh Boy, tasty!"}
{"text":"Great antipasti. Not a sit-in resistant, but they will make you a pizza from scratch."}
{"text":"Have always loved this place. A real family owned type business. Through the years they have seen many changes. They have terrific homemade sauces and soups.  You can pop in for a fresh made Sammy for lunch. They have very good lunch meat. Can't beat boars head. They used to have a terrific salami, bergermeister....they don't carry it anymore. But, they have tons to offer. They are friendly and sincerely awesome. Today, my mom went in for a bit of salami. The woman remembered her and that my Pop had some recent health issues. She inquired about his well being. My mom, just out of the hospital herself, updated her. The kind lady, threw in a fresh loaf of bread to have with her salami.  She was very kind and considerate. Paying it forward. I will always be their biggest fan."}
{"text":"This place is the definition of a diamond in the rough. Situated on Old William Penn Highway not far from the 376 Plum Exit, they have sandwiches that are not only a great value but big on taste.

Forget Primanti Brothers this place has got the sandwiches you crave. Sure there is something to be said for the Pittsburgh classic of fries and coleslaw on a sandwich, but even double meat at Primanti's doesn't match up to wad of Boars Head meat Minitalia is slinging out on their sandwiches. 

The decor is a little discombobulated but don't let that throw you. You are sure to get a good sandwich and good service as this Monroeville eatery. I interacted with both associates working this Sat afternoon both were very friendly and helpful.

If you are in the neighborhood give this place a try. You will not leave hungry I assure you."}
