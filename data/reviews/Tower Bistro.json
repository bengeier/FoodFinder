{"text":"Great place to get a cheap lunch meal in downtown Phoenix. This place is located downstairs inside the chase tower."}
{"text":"If your budget is conservative, but you want a decent meal...Tower Bistro is your spot. Sort of a cafeteria feel, but not too terrible.  I had the buffalo chicken salad, which was great. The regular size take out box of salad...$5.74! Talk about good AND cheap. Of course they had more options like a huge slice of pizza for $3.   Aside from the cafeteria feel, I was pleased with the cost and the food. I'll definitely go back!"}
{"text":"I've been dining here for about a year now, as it's in Chase Tower (Concourse Level).  My usual go-to is their salad bar and it's pretty standard. It would be awesome if they offered things such as Quinoa and various, fresh salsas.  Prices are on the higher side, so buyer beware!  Best weekly menu item? Mexican Posole - hands down!! Every Wednesday...  The majority of Aramark staff is very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Rude staff food is ok at best would recommend to hire more polite and friendly employees this will be the last time coming in here."}
