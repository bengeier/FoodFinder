{"text":"Mislabeling of food. 

Visited with my father and nephew, after first, orientating ourselves with Mount Sinai Hospital. Our nephew will soon be a first time father.

The wonton soup has no wontons, instead it contains sloppy looking noodles without any filling. The broth is not seafood based, it is vegetable based and overly salty.

The fried squid dish is not breaded or fried. I wanted this dish removed from the bill. I spoke to a man, perhaps the owner, that argued, \"the squid is fried\".

I told the owner that \"I take responsibility for not asking how the squid is prepared\", but since it was labelled, fried, I figured it would be fried. 

He, the owner, repeated my words, \"you should have asked how it is prepared\". At this point, I knew what kind of person I was dealing with.

I was offered a 10% discount, off the \"fried squid\" dish which I refused. 

I found it amusing that this same man asked, \"did you eat the squid\" , I replied, \"yes, I ate one piece because I intended to eat the fried squid, but since it is not fried, I have no interest in eating the rest\" which is the reason I asked for this dish to be taken off the bill. 

Salt and pepper chicken, overly salty. The only okay dish was the 5 tiny, chicken and shrimp dumplings.

The free water was the best thing about our meal.   

I echo, Zechen's review of the rice, which I also found overcooked and mushy.

We arrived at lunch time, to an empty restaurant, two other patrons were there by the time we left. 

I understand why this place is and should, always remain empty. Horrible food, service and ownership."}
{"text":"The food was made with care and extremely tasty. The dumpling stuffing tasted fresh and the dough was of proper texture. Overall highly recommended."}
{"text":"We have had a lot of dumplings in Toronto and Markham and 7 Dim Sum is our favourite. The soup and steamed dumplings are better than mother's dumplings and Dumpling House in Markham. The owner is really friendly and takes great pride in his food. Everything is freshly made and you can tell by th springyness of the wrapper. The noodles in the spicy beef noodle soup are definitely homemade and delicious. Nothing is too salty and it a all very flavourful."}
{"text":"Just stopped in to get some dim sum... Asked for the menu and was told they only serve dumplings and no other dim sum. That is not dim sum. Don't name yourself a dim sum restaurant and not serve dim sum. I'm so greatly disappointed"}
{"text":"This is my favourite place to have dimsum..by the way, for those non-chinese speaking people, the name \"7 dimsum\" sounds like \"eat dimsum\" in Mandarin :-)
Anyway, carrying on the review.  I like this place more than any of the Chinatown places because it's homemade, low volume, and the owner runs the show 7 days a week! He's always friendly and chat with you and make sure you're well taken care of.  The flavour is not overpowering, it taste like home-made food! It doesn't make you feel sleepy or disgusting like some of the cheap Chinese food restaurants.  I know for sure they don't use MSG.

My favorite dishes are spicy wonton, beef pancake roll and the amazing black sesame sweet mochi balls in rice wine for dessert! It's just the right amount of sweetness and doesn't give you that crazy sugar high like some of the deserts will.  It's just the right amount of satisfaction to complete a full meal.

Please don't run this place down by making it too popular and turn it into another chain restaurant..*yuck*! Stay small and homey and I promise to come back lots and lots to support you!

{"text":"I was walking home and noticed this new place. Open for just 3 weeks now. Located at Jones on the Danforth. Looks like I get the first review. Checked it out on Sunday. Nice clean location. Excellent helpful service by the owner himself. When we wondered if we had ordered enough food he was honest to say that our order should cover us. Food was delivered to the table in a timely fashion. Tea provided on a regular basis. Lots of different things to order. Menu can be found on their Facebook Page as it would seem they don't have a website yet (at least I couldn't find one.) They do have a twitter account..

Enjoyed the Pancake Roll With Beef, Deep Fried Eggplant, and their specialty Shrimp and Soup Pork Dumplings. They flag that all their cuisine is homemade and it definitely tastes that way (Tasty). I was full by the time we left. 

Definitely worth checking out and a nice addition to Danforth East."}
{"text":"I've been here about 5 times since the grand opening on March 1, 2015. I think it's about time that I add my thoughts to the Yelp community. Hands down the best soup filled dumplings in downtown Toronto. The shrimp and pork is my personal favourite. I tried the durian fruit cake and it was a bit too doughy-y for my tastes, but who cares? Their speciality is soup filled dumplings, and they are simply delightful.

{"text":"I'm pretty sure that the rating for is restaurant is highly underestimated. 

The steamed dumpling could be one of the best choice among Chinatown. And it's well priced."}
{"text":"A welcome addition to the neighbourhood. My wife and I typically have to drive up to Markham / Richmond Hill for decent dumplings. Not anymore.

We found this place by accident and dropped in. Ordered the crab/pork soup dumplings, beef noodle soup, and a few other dishes but those I considered as the highlight. You can taste the crab in these dumplings whereas other places you wonder if they remembered the crab at all. The noodles taste homemade. I feel the chef's love in his cooking.

We will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"So bad I had to create an account to write a review.  Stopped in for some lunch.  Ordered the siu long bao, sui mai, pork and shrimp steamed dumplings and deep fried tofu. It looked and tasted like week old dried out leftovers.  Cost me $35 including tips.  How are people giving this place anything more than a one star.  If you bought dim sum at t&t and heated at home it would be better than this."}
{"text":"Delicious delicate little dumplings.  Unique but subtle flavoring.  Would like to go with more people to try more things.  We had the shui mai, shrimp/pork dumplings and the green onion pancake.  All was delish."}
{"text":"Ordered crab meat and pork soup dumplings, beef onion pancake, cold salad with vinaigrette, hand pulled noodles with bean sauce and pork pot stickers.  Comparable to eating in Markham or Scarborough (ie thoughtful prep and very tasty and high quality food).  Chilli oil also delish, speckled with sesame seeds."}
{"text":"It's absolutely tasty!! If you like soup dumplings, regular dumplings or noodles give it a try.  I think it's worthy of Markham Chinese food!"}
{"text":"Love this place, but right now it is currently closed up and on Facebook they say they will open soon in a new location, but i cant find out where or when!"}
{"text":"This is the best restaurant to open on the Danforth in years. Don't think hargow or siumai though, think soup dumplings, fried dumplings, homemade noodles and fragrant soups. Had various dumplings the first time, all crazy good, and the second time homemade noodles in spicy fragrant beef broth, with fall apart tender beef flavoured with chinese spices and some greens. This is seriously good food."}
{"text":"$11 dollars (after tax) for a \"Special Pork Sauce with Noodles\" highly disappointed. I would get something much better tasting and more filling with a lower price."}
{"text":"I had the pancake roll with beef take-out today.  It was very very good.  It was light and tasty w/ a hint of coriander. It was on the pricier side of dim sum, however somewhat justified as you can tell that everything is fresh and home-made and that the chef had a fine touch.  It was truly delightful.  I will be dropping in again.  Next time I am going to have a sit down meal with my husband, but I already know that it will only be regarded as a snack by my husband who has a healthy appetite.  The place is casual and small.  Clean and nice.  There is an emphasis on pork dishes however, but they have beef, chicken and veg too.  And their specialty is pork soup dumpling, so if you don't eat pork you may feel a little limited.  If you are like me and like to try out new restaurants I would definitely recommend this place;  but bring some friends so you can all try a few dishes."}
{"text":"Loved the shrimp and pork soup dumplings, onion pancake and firey dumplings.
Very small place, but very nice, excellent service."}
{"text":"Very limited choices, and very small menu.  Only 5 tables, tiny little space.  The green onion pancake was very oily and very salty.  The firey wontons are in a very hot spicy peanut butter based sauce.  They could do with more flavor and less heat  Deep fried eggplant - neither of us could eat it.  Huge clumps of dough surrounding mushy eggplamt.  The beef pancake - was just okay, lots of oily dough and large pieces of coriander, not much meat.  The shrimp and pork soup dumplings were pleasant but frankly I don't see why people rave over with them.  They were okay.  Getting back to the 401 was a nightmare of driving through Toronto city streets as the Don V was closed.  If you aren't in the immediate neighbourhood, believe me, this is not worth the drive!  Another Yelp disappointment for us.  Parking is almost non existent.  I wish we had tried the beef noodle soup but doubt it could compare to the Sogo anyway."}
{"text":"I didn't really get the dim sum thing until I came here. This food is delicious! Had the pancake roll with beef... wicked. Pork soup dumplings....yum. Beef noodle soup...yes please. Glad I live nearby. A new regular place for us!"}
{"text":"Highly welcome local spot and the best dumplings I've had on the Danforth. Earnest attentive owner takes great pride in his food. The soup dumplings are rich, and the fried dumplings are not oily, and have a great crunch to them. Also tried the beef and coriander roll in foil, again a hit. Would recommend even as a destination spot."}
{"text":"The dumplings are comparable to Markham but get their beef pancakes...its probably the best I've had in Toronto. The braised beef soup needs more meat and vegetables but decent enough."}
{"text":"Here for lunch with the family hoping to find something closer than hwy 7.

Spicy beef noodles were good. Noodles tasted good...the texture was soft...homemade?  Beef was nicer cuts than other places we have tried. 

Green onion pancake was too doughy and not enough onions.

Pancake roll with beef was great...light, fresh...

Dumplings were good...both steamed and pan fried.

Overall a nice lunch.. 

I would leave a pot of tea for the guests as those tea cups are like any Chinese tea cups...small. and I can see at busier times hard to keep up refilling."}
{"text":"This was my first experience with soup dumplings and me likey! Interesting idea and love that they have a board with instructions on how to eat them haha. 

We also had steamed pork, steamed veg, and crunchy fried beef dumplings. All were good but the crispy beef ones were my favourite. 

The green onion pancake with beef was unnmmbelievable. Looks like a regular type of wrap at first glance, but on closer inspection it's sort of crispy and sweetish. It was amazing.  

We also had these small filets of fish covered in almonds that were delicious. Not sure what they were called as I didn't order them. 

Fast service, good prices, and a nice little spot. Would definitely go back"}
{"text":"High underrated spot! The deep fried lotus root, salt and pepper eggplant, and pork and cabbage dumplings were my favourites. Authentic flavour, well priced, and everything made to order. One of the best kept secrets."}
{"text":"This is not your full fledged dim sum joint. You will be hard pressed to find all your favourite dim sum items that you often order at larger Chinese restaurants (cha lau). However, whatever items they have on the menu, they deliver it well.

The dumplings are well made (they don't fall apart of crack) and the filling is fresh and delicious. You can definitely tell these guys make it fresh and frequently. The infamous xiao long bao (one of my favs) holds up well. The skin is thin yet tough to break and the soup inside is great. It's like heaven in a single bit (except you may not want to do that if you want to avoid a 2nd degree burn inside your mouth - read the eating instructions provided by the restaurant).

All in all, a great place to grab a quick snack or even snack until you're stuffed. LOL"}
{"text":"Had the Xiaolongbao here today and it was great. I would say it's on par with Din Tai Fung, but presentation is not as good (not as many folds). The green onion cake was good. Next time I would like to try the hot and sour soup. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Simply amazing and far exceeded our expectations. Everything was just perfect, so we just kept ordering one more fish. Do yourself a favour and just order 2 orders of the pork soup dumplings right off the bat to save having to place another order. I'm mad at myself that we waited for a few months to try. Best addition to the strip in years and will become a weekly meal in sure."}
{"text":"Don't eat here...
Don't eat here if you're a regular yelper.
Don't eat here if you're a 'foodie'
Don't eat here if you're gonna breakdown the menu and how its 'Not Dim Sum'
Don't eat here if you're reading this for the comments.
Don't eat here if you're gonna tell a friend about the Chinese joint in Greektown.
But.. Eat here..
.. To stuff your face,
 .. To out your phone down and enjoy a meal
.. Lastly enjoy the same type of meal I had.. 
Me and my friends ordered everything!!"}
{"text":"Really delicious! I tried the green onion pancakes and steamed mushroom and chicken dumplings, hot and sour soup (perfect consistency) and fried beef and carrot dumplings. Coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"im not a dumpling connoiseur but here is my take:

- super high quality ingredients (relative to good chinese places)
- very delicious
- felt special
- very very very very very good"}
{"text":"The best dumplings in Toronto. Everything we have tried has been fantastic. Soup dumplings are a favourite, and the pancake was tender and crispy. Their fried dumplings are done with the lattice batter which is my favourite style. All of the filling is flavourful and cooked perfectly and the dough has a pleasant chew to it.

Their chili is homemade and AMAZING. Super spicy and fresh. This is secretly my favourite part about coming here.. I want to bottle it up and take it home. It reminds the boyfriend of his mother's chili.

I have never seen anyone else in here, so please go! I don't want to lose my favourite dumpling joint. The restaurant is cute, although the music is always really weird. The owner is very nice. Highly recommended :)"}
{"text":"I came here on a Friday night looking for a quick bite. This place didn't seem as busy as the other places in Baldwin village. The inside of the restaurant feels very different from the sign - the decor was a lot nicer than I expected. I had the mini wonton soup and the salt and pepper chicken with rice. I didn't know the rice dish came with a hot and sour soup and the owner explained to me afterward and didn't give me the hot and sour soup. He adjusted the price of the mini wonton soup from ~$5 to ~$3. The wontons were REALLY mini in that they didn't really have any filling at all. I would stick with the hot and sour soup that came with the rice dish. The salt and pepper chicken was good and made with white meat but I wasn't the biggest fan of their rice (it was a bit overcooked). Service was really good."}
