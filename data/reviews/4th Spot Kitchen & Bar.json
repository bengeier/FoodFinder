{"text":"Great Place!   I have been a fan of this place since I stumbled upon them about a year ago. They have excellent food which has not declined in quality which most pubs/restaurants do after they open.   Pros: - great pub food  - menu additives and reductions are appropriate and nice to try  - daily specials on drinks and food worth while and no skimping because its on special  bad:  - can be a little slow on service but its usually busy and can be forgiven"}
{"text":"Just tried the Maple Canuck Burger.. It was the best burger I've ever tasted in my 28 years of living. I am from California and this is my first time in Canada.. So I decided to get everything as Canadian as possible. To me.. Canada is known for bacon, maple, hockey and poutine, which led me to the Canuck Burger and poutine fries. Geez.. I am salivating just writing this review.. And I just ate the burger 45 minutes ago. Anyways, service was good, atmosphere good, and burger fantastic. Check it \"oot.\""}
{"text":"I've only tried their burgers but man are they good.   The poutine is amazing.   Our server, Amanda, was a gem! Knows her beer. Love her!"}
{"text":"I've been frequenting 4th Spot since they opened last year and all I can say is these guys know what it takes.  This place in a word is, Phenomenal!  4th Spot has a great atmosphere for a relaxing few drinks/dinner out. Not a high energy spot.  Modern, classy and clean is how I would describe this place.  And between the small parking lot out back and the available street parking, I don't usually have a hard time finding a place to put the wheels.  The menu has a great mix of items for all tastes and the quality of the food is consistent every time I go.  Portions are quite large and the prices are fair.  This place probably has one of the best (if not THE best) burgers in town. Highly recommend the Maple Canuck Burger for first timers looking for a good pub burger (if beef isn't your thing, try the Stuffed Club). And as many reviewers have already pointed out, the poutine is out of this world!  If you're looking for something a little on the lighter side try the One Love Tacos.  My mouth is watering just thinking about them!  I usually sit upstairs in the lounge area and the service there is fast and friendly every single time.  Which brings me to my one complaint. The service in the lower dining area is perpetually terrible.  Slow and not overly friendly just about every time. And unfortunately I have recommended 4th Spot a few times to friends who ended up sitting down there and said they'd never go back for that reason.  This didn't change my rating though, as I find the lounge a more comfortable place to sit since there are no small children allowed up there (sorry parents, I just prefer to be surrounded by adults when I go to a pub)."}
{"text":"Ok, this place is very, very good! I've been here twice now, and we ordered a variety of things, from bison burgers, to pulled pork sandwiches and BLTs. It is ALL good.   One of the things I notice is most places don't do French Onion Soup very well. Usually most places make it overly salty and you taste salt more than onions. The French Onion Soup here is delicious. They bake a cheese biscuit right on top of it, and it comes out scalding hot. You can taste the onions and broth, which is the way it should be. Sides such as sweet potato fries, and soup of the days have been fantastic and never disappointed me. Service has always been excellent and friendly.   The atmosphere is pub fare, so don't expect fine dining, but for supposedly \"pub food\" this is by far one of the best I've been to.  Street parking is plentiful in this area but I'm guessing it's more because not many people know how great this place is. I can't honestly think of anything that would make me take a star off, so this place is easily deserving of its perfect score."}
{"text":"We had the French onion soup and the Mac n' cheese everyone has been raving about, and both were amazing! Service was great. For adults I would probably suggest the patio or lounge. The main dining area was loaded with families and children... so for a quiet date night I would probably try to avoid that area, or just go at a later hour."}
{"text":"Super classy but comfy home feel, PHENOMENAL food, and incredibly friendly and welcoming staff. Definitely going to return again! My mom and I split the French onion soup and the maple canuck burger and were totally blown away by both. Brilliant! Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Highly recommend you try the Sausage Pizza, delicious and the Saucy Meatballs...mmmmmmmmmm, Good! Not too mention a very good array of beers on tap to help wash it down. I'll be back..."}
{"text":"Must try the Sweet Potato Fries! I went up to 4th Spot for two friends' birthday and will definitely go again.   Although my friends' reservation for a party of 15 was lost (they have a room off the lounge for, if not privacy - since it is quite open to the rest of the lounge-, at least a bit more room and division from the rest of the crowd) the manager was able to get us seated in the lounge with a row of tables between the time first members of our party and the birthday gals showed up (Thumbs Up!). I do believe it was a technical error rather than their fault, and I'm sure the Birthday Shots on the house helped out a bit too.   I had the Spa Club, but was not a fan. I'd definitely steer clear of their chicken if I were to go again since it was quite rubbery and tasteless. BUT their Sweet Potato Fries with Spicy Mayo are to die for! By the time I got through the Sweet Potato Fries, I could hardly care about the lack lustre sandwich anyway. But the rest of my party seemed to be enjoying the food and the pastas and pizza looked like a hit.   At this point I'd give 4th Spot a 2-3 Star rating, but the atmosphere and service was great, so I'm forgiving the bad chicken. 4th Spot has a very relaxed mood and is spacious (we went on a Saturday ~7pm and the lounge was about 3/4 full, so nice if you don't wan't to wait). I'm not sure if it's because it wasn't too busy, but our meals came quickly even with our large party. Our waitress was wonderful and unfazed about dealing with a larger party. Also, she checked on us just enough to make sure we were topped up with drinks and had no problems with dinner, but didn't circle us like a hawk.   I'll definitely go back for appies or dinner with friends, but I'll just avoid the chicken next time!"}
{"text":"Ordered the steak and salad today - El Matador - and it was bad. Overdone and tough pieces of steak on skewers with pieces of vegetables, all marinated in vinegar to the point of being sour, along with salad soaked in yet more vinaigrette. The waitress was attentive but seemed uninterested in my comments re the meal. I had the meatloaf a few months ago and loved it. But after this, I won't be back."}
{"text":"My friend took me here yesterday for a post drinking recovery meal and I am glad I went.  The place I gather is fairly new and shows on the inside , great decor , great atmosphere and a west facing patio for tons of sunshine during lunch and dinner service.  I ordered the regular burger with cheese and bacon with a beer  ( they have daily 5$ pint specials ) The burger came out in a reasonable amount of time ; about 20min.  Presentation was nice , the burger came on a square bun with a pickle on top skewered by a steak knife and the fries in a basket.  The burger it's self was delicious; a home made patty that was beautifully seasoned and moist. The bun was fresh and delicious and put together with the fillings made for one of the best burgers that i've had in reccent memory. The fries werent by any measure exceptional but I have no complaints - just fries.   Price is on the higher side unfortunately."}
{"text":"Great food, great menu specials, great atmosphere. We took our kids (4 yo and 19 mo) for an early supper. Mussels as an appetizer were fresh and tasty. I had the spaghetti and meatballs....mmmmmm!!!! kids were happy and liked their mac and cheese. Great local tap selection for beer!! We will be back weekly!!"}
{"text":"Ambiance was fantastic but little noisy  Chicken wings too great Baked French onion soup and the Baja quesadilla were excellent dishes and this is a must go place Service was good too"}
{"text":"To the Poutine lovers out there you must come here and try the Chicken and Waffle attacking cheese before it's off the menu! It came out piping hot with ooyee gooyee cheese, gravy and maple syrup with chucks of waffles. The Poutine was so alive and stringy that the cheese flew and hit my boyfriends forehead smack in the middle. Then came the best part... Next time he lifted the fork and the fry with gravy flew to his forehead and stuck there... So if you what some crazy awesome great salty and sweet poutine  ... com' on by because it will be a food  story of a life time. Oh yeah the Virgin lime margarita with salt on the rim was a nice addition to the meal. It was a decent portion  for two."}
{"text":"The only bad thing I can say about this place is that there are so many amazing options on the menu that it's really hard to decide.  Also, it's a busy place, so I've had to wait as long as 15 minutes before - not bad at all.  Everything I've tried here has been really, really good.  Burgers, tacos, steak sandwich, all awesome.  The homemade hot sauce is good enough to steal a bottle (I haven't.... yet).  They have a fairly extensive beer list, and the sides are interesting and delicious.  I've had good service every time I've visited - not stellar service, but good.    One unique experience I had here was two weeks ago, as we were finishing our meals, and the entire lounge area filled up with the unmistakable smell of pot. I looked around (as did all the other customers) to see who was passing a joint around.  I guess someone was relaxing at the end of their shift just outside (or inside?) the back door, and the wind blew the stench right into the lounge?  The whole incident brought an otherwise 5 star experience down to 4 stars, but hey, maybe some people like second hand weed smoke?"}
{"text":"I have loved everything I have eaten here. I am looking forward to trying everything on the menu some day. Very attentive and friendly waitress. I have never been more happy with my restaurant experience than both times I have been here. Well done!"}
{"text":"Great Food all the way around,  My kids eyes just about glazed over when he got his Poutine.  Everything I have had has bee great - anxious to try the French onion soup....Looks amazing!"}
{"text":"I hadn't heard of this place before.  I actually wanted to go to \"John's breakfast and brunch just a few stores down. My girlfriend and I decided to give it a try. We took a seat on the patio and immediately noticed that out of the 5-6 tables with people on them,  none of them had their food.  We knew this was going to be a long wait. We ordered drinks to start. She had a mimosa and I had a drink with Vodka,  strawberries and something else.  Not the manliest drink,  but it tasted good.  If we didn't have our drinks we would have been starving.  The buzz was keeping me going.  She ordered a traditional black forest ham Benny and I had a Benny with grilled salmon.  They were both tasty but not worth the 40 minute wait for them.  The portion was pretty small.  I don't think I will be coming back here anytime soon."}
{"text":"4th Spot is AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME. We went in at 5:45pm on a Friday, and the place was jam packed, mostly due to the families that were having early dinner. During our 15 min wait, we were offered drinks, until we were seated. We were taken to a cozy booth in the back corner of the lounge section, and our server was with us within a minute. I had the Veg burger, with sauteed mushrooms and onions. On top of being sloppy and delicious, it could have fed 2 people. My boyfriend had the Fat Elvis, a beef patty with spicy mayo and blue cheese. Also delicious, rich and fattening.  They really do have some of the best yam fries in town, crispy and fresh...not limp like they've come out of a bag.  Looking around, you have all types coming to this spot, from families, to couples young and old.  There is live music on Tuesdays and drink specials everyday. I will definately be coming back for the fantastic food and friendly service."}
{"text":"Not your typical neighborhood pub. Original food that's cooked very well and tasty with a nice atmosphere! Pizzas are amazing, French onion soup is definitely worthy a try and the beef skewers will not disappoint! Found my fave place for amazing food with a beer!"}
{"text":"Good food..great ambiance ...patio rocks"}
{"text":"My father and his friends finally treated me to here because i have been marking too long time.hahahahaha.joking  we ordered five meals, all of them were good. Although this the first time i ate burger in Calgary,it was not bad. Excluding burger,the favorite meal is that soup! It was amazing, i love it!The cup of soup was covered by the fried wheat cake or pancake (Actually,i don't know how to describe), but it tasted nice."}
{"text":"I have been to 4th spot many times. The past few visits have been disappointing. After the stinky, cold and generally disgusting olive oil pizza, I will never go back. The pepperoni on traditional crust was just ok.  My beer was less than chilled. I am more disappointed that they would actually serve something that was obviously sub standard. Clean up your act 4 th spot!!!!"}
{"text":"I live just up the street and have been here many times. Sometimes just for drinks but most often for pizza, nachos and wings. I had there burger last night and it was very tasty."}
{"text":"Fab fab fab!! Went here Valentines night just gone, service was brill, food was amazing! Had soup and den d Vitamin Sea Salad , could not fault it! Cant wait to return :))"}
{"text":"We have tried other places in the neighborhood but have always walked away disappointed. 4th Spot delivers on all the important points - food quality, value for money, atmosphere - it's got it all. My go to dishes so far are the two chicken burger selections. I'll update once I get the bruschetta to start, but I'm sure it will be delish. On a Friday or Saturday night be prepared to wait around 20-30 mins for a table. If it's particularly busy they will come around with beer and wine samples, and juice for the kids. I'm not complaining!"}
{"text":"This place was great and we had really excellent serivce. We did have to wait around twenty minutes and the line behind us kept getting longer! You could tell that this place was really popular.   We tried the Statiion 7 burger with sweet potato fries (highly recommend the sweet potato fries!) as well as the homemade Mac and Cheese. Both dishes were excellent. The Mac and Cheese was to die for!  Really great atmosphere and I wanted to try everything on the menu. You have to try out 4th Spot!!"}
{"text":"Love love love the Mac and Cheese. Full of flavour and the portion size is huge.  The French onion soup is amazing as well. Would love to give 5 stars, the service though could use a little tweeting. Lots of staff but seem to wait quite awhile for the server to come around."}
{"text":"I cannot say enough good things about 4th spot. I live in the area and my husband and I frequent 4th spot a lot. I have loved everything I have tried here, but my favorite is the burgers. They taste so fresh and the toppings are fantastic! Also love their tacos and the house salad! Great little spot,which is why it can be hard to get in during peak hours."}
{"text":"The food was great and the staff were all super friendly. My only complaint is that they don't have a kids menu. But I'd still go back again and again. I've recommended 4th spot to a few friends and they were quite happy with it too."}
{"text":"Oh. My. God. Why didn't I know about this place sooner? We just moved in to the area and a friend took me to 4th spot. The food was amazing- I had the stuffed chicken club and the inferno shrimp (order extra bread, because you're going to want to soak up the sauce from the shrimp!). Our server was great, she even let me put a sticker over my house on the giant aerial photo of the neighborhood on the wall. I took my boyfriend back here a few days later and we had equally great service. He had the steak sandwich, which was amazing. Whatever the marinade they use for the steaks, it's spectacular. I had a pizza which was 1/2 price and delicious. Definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Used to love this charming little spot. However, the last few times I have been they have told me 15-20 minute wait for a table and then stood around waiting for over an hour. Not fun when you have a 1 year old. Also didn't appreciate the $3.50 charge for a soda water. Sadly, won't be going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Yep...what everyone else said. They screwed up my order but still got 5 stars.  This is one of those places that is hard to order from cuz everything sounds so damn good.  I had the French onion soup to start and it was topped with this crazy phyllo crust that turned out quite good.  Steak sandwich was on special and it's a smaller filet that was perfectly cooked.  The screw up I mentioned earlier was that I was brought the wrong sidedish (ordered poutine and was brought baked) then my replacement poutine never came.  The reason they still get 5 stars is because they handled it perfectly by leaving the baked potatoes for the table to share then comping my steak sani from the bill.  Exactly the right thing to do to bring me and my buddies back.  Everyone else raved about the food and the place was packed....took us about 15-20 to get a table on Friday night 7:30, which isn't too shabby.  Definitely a decent spot!"}
{"text":"Burger and beer Thursday was great. Clean and classy, food was delicious and good size portions. Service was pleasant and not pushy. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Loved this local gem. Friendly service and great food. I had the Elvis burger and it was fantastic. Thick juicy burger topped with a fried egg. Heaven."}
{"text":"My partner and I decided to try the 4th Spot on Wing & Wine Wednesday. Their menu online seemed really excellent, and we were excited to finally be going to this cute and friendly-looking neighbourhood spot.  When we got there, there was quite a large line up waiting for tables, but their staff members were quite organized--they took down names and gave out very accurate wait times. While we were waiting, someone came out offering up hot slices of house-made pizza. What a treat to have the establishment care about waiting customers.  Once we got seated, the servers were friendly, and very efficient--drinks were brought promptly. For our first round of wings, we ordered the Tough Guy (tasty suicide sauce) and the Jammin Mon (homemade Jamaican jerk). For our second round we ordered the Hotty Cowgirl (red mile mixed with BBQ sauce) and the Cheesy Pick Up Line (baked parmesan and red mile sauce). Here are the pros and cons of our dining experience:  PROS: - Great value of wings for special night. The wings are large and juicy. Plus, the number of wings per serving was perfect. - Service was incredible. We needed to send an order of wings back (see CONS), and the server was really wonderful about it. - Restaurant definitely cares about its customers (eg. serving pizza to those of us in line). - Offered us a beer sampler on a drink choice we were unsure about.  CONS: - The wing flavours were DISAPPOINTING to say the least. The descriptions made them sounds wonderful. The so-called \"suicide\" wings were bare a \"medium\" heat. The Jamaican jerk rub may as well have been called \"Cinnamon\" because that's all we could taste. The Hotty Cowgirl tasted like unsauce wings--we just had to send this order back to get re-sauced. While the server was truly gracious in obliging this, we got the wings back COLD. Like the person in the kitchen tossed the wings in sauce from the refrigerator!!! So so so disappointing. - The acoustics of the dining room are very weird, making the corner that we were sitting in thump with the bass notes of the speaker above us, and making it hard to have a reasonable conversation.  Ultimately, due to the service, care, and generally lovely atmosphere, we had a three-star experience at the 4th Spot. We are thinking about giving it another try--possibly for Burger & PInt Thursday, but we won't be returning for wings any time soon."}
{"text":"hidden Gem..........only been once......great meatballs, and mac n cheese! Good beer prices! Good atmosphere if you sit upstairs in the bar. Worth a visit to a quaint neighborhood...... out of the way kinda place with a nice crowd......"}
{"text":"I've been to the 4th Spot many times and it's definitely worth the wait. The service is great and the food is amazing. I do miss a few of the menu items that they recently removed with an update but I'm still more than satisfied by the excellent choices. My favorite is the meatloaf, it's amazing."}
{"text":"This place is an awesome blend of lounge and family restaurant.  I had the French onion soup as a side to my maple bacon burger and it was all amazing although too much for one meal. Great service and atmosphere. Use the no wait app to save yourself the cold wait outside."}
{"text":"best burger i have eaten so far here in Calgary, with the sweet potatoes on the side is a great combination."}
{"text":"Went for lunch and had the meatballs and pizza. Both items were amazing! Really nice decor of the restaurant and the service was pretty good too. I'd go back for sure!"}
{"text":"Got to this place and it was busy so I checked in and gave them my number so they could text me when it was ready. Waited 45 minutes, came back in, the place had died down significantly and there girl at the door was like we text you 30 minutes ago..... nope, sorry, you didn't. No big deal let's keep moving. Got seated at a wonderful spot upstairs next to a roof leak (big piece of ceiling tile down and water leaking in. Oh by the way our bathroom is flooding as well... wait what? Stuck around long enough to have food, even tho our waitress was super inattentive. It was delicious and there only saving grace. Good food, poor service and overall bad experience. I'd save your money. Pretty pricey, would have been happy to pay it for the food but not with all the other nonsense."}
{"text":"Really good food, amazing service. Friendliest and most helpful waiters I have come across in a while"}
{"text":"Saltiest food I had ever eaten in my life. The meatloaf was not edible. It was so salty I had a bite and downed a full glass of water. Disgusting. Maybe it was their off day but will not go back I want to live a long healthy life."}
{"text":"I live close by, so I've been to 4th Spot lots of times. Love the food, especially the pizzas. Pizzas are half price on Mondays and it's Pasta night on Tuesdays - my favourite nights to go.   The service does tend to be slow, and if not for that, I probably would give it 5 stars. I still highly recommend it, though."}
{"text":"We went mid afternoon so it wasn't too busy & we didn't have to wait for a table.  Interior is nice, with a variety of seating options.  We had delicious burgers, & upgraded the fries to poutine. Service was excellent, friendly & fast. One burger was missing cheese, but they were quick to remedy the error."}
{"text":"Good food, great deal on wine on Wednesday. However, food service is VERY slow (even though we sat at the bar to accelerate the process). If you're there for the wings special on Wednesday, expect a long wait that will make you forget the flavour you ordered."}
{"text":"This is a great little spot for a date night during the week! They have excellent daily specials!!  It can get a bit busy, so I would recommend going before or after the dinner rush."}
{"text":"A neighbourhood classic.  Food is good, service is attentive, and atmosphere is welcoming.  We usually eat in the lounge or on the patio for a kid-free experience. Both are very comfortable and casual.  The restaurant has daily specials every night of the week.  Pizza night can get pretty busy - but is well worth the wait."}
{"text":"Good food and great daily specials!    Food has been good  everytime I eat there. They have daily specials and is really good value.   A lot of local microbrews on tap, lots and new brews to try.    It's a small location, but I like that adds to the character of place  Highly Recommend it!"}
{"text":"Good pizza. Good vibe. Good pizza night specials. Great playlist. Will return for sure."}
{"text":"This is my favourite place that I drag friends to when I know we want a great meal and we are nearby. I am such a fan of the pizza and I've never had a disappointing meal. Always busy, but it's a great somewhat-hidden gem."}
{"text":"My husband and I made last minute dinner plans with friends from Airdrie on Friday night as it was a good middle point.  We arrived around 6:30 and there was a line (I'm sure that's normal!) We were told we would wait about 20 minutes...not too bad.  Ended up only waiting about 7-10 minutes which was a nice bonus.  The server was friendly and attentive.  Good food, my husband and his friend enjoyed the good selection of beer.  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great ambiance and amazing food!  Service was fantastic and quick...we will be back!  I would recommend this place for large or small groups...Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Ate there on a Monday evening so it wasn't overly crowded. Clean and nicely decorated.  First time to Calgary so we weren't familiar with the local brews. The waitress gave us samplers ... very good beers. I had the salmon \"comfort  food\" and my buddy had the fish tacos. It was good but did not pull us back for another night. The salmon was over done (as it is at most places) and they didn't have their apple slaw so they gave me some corn mixture (in addition to corn on the cob). It had a nice flavor,  good spice, but was a bit OD on corn."}
{"text":"Pedestrian food, slightly overpriced but good service and ambience. Beware the short ribs. Had them twice and found them ghastly."}
{"text":"I love, LOVE this place. Great good, casual atmosphere, reasonable price. I live near here and it's a nice treat when I don't feel like cooking.   Their burgers are awesome, as are their tacos... And their wings... And well, pretty much everything else I've ever had here.   The one downside is that it is ALWAYS busy here. I've had to leave a few times because the wait for tables was too long.   Definitely worth checking out... And on Tuesdays they have live music too!"}
{"text":"While dropping off our father to the airport we want a nice place for dinner. After seeing the French onion soup on yelp we had to give it a try.   We all went for the soup and were not disappointed. The phyllo pastry topping made for a unique dip in the delicious French onion soup. A little bit of cheese added to the very filling meal.   My only compliant is that we ordered too much food. I had to try the nachos with pulled pork as well.   The sassy waitress made the dinner complete with some witty banter.   Bookmarked for future trips to Calgary."}
{"text":"I love the specials on Thursday especially but good everyday.  Pizzas are excellent and burgers are outstanding. Parking is a little difficult but okay. Service is excellent and all with reasonable pricing. If you haven't been then you're missing out."}
{"text":"4th Spot is in a great location with plenty of parking, and the ambience is relaxed. I felt myself going back and forth with this review. I don't get it, Calgary. It seemed like with 3 servers relaying (with roughly 10 guests per server for the group), the service would actually be somewhat decent. However, it took my friend and I half an hour to get a menu, 20 minutes to get a glass of wine, and over an hour before her salad showed up. The server that gave us our drinks, didn't even bother to stop and ask if we were ready to order, he just booked it across the room. Is there someone outside in a giant barrel, stomping grapes with their bare feet? Is someone harvesting romaine lettuce by hand, in the rain?   Why are so many of Calgary's restaurants completely and utterly unprepared to handle large groups? Large groups make reservations, so you know well ahead of time that you're going to be serving X amount of people; yet you still act like your mother-in-law randomly showed up on your front porch with a suitcase to stay for a week, so you ran upstairs and shit the bed.   Thankfully, the birthday guy seemed to be well attended to, which is the important thing (and which kept your stars from turning brown), but when the food finally arrived... blargh. We wolfed it down because the wait was making us hangry, and if it wasn't for the Tic Tacs in my purse, my friend would've started nomming on the upholstery.   Now, the sweet potato fries here are decent. And so is the house made hot sauce, although I wish it had come out at the same time my dipping cup of ketchup came out. By the time the ketchup came out, there were 3 fries left on the plate. Three. That's a rounded tablespoon of ketchup for every lukewarm fry.  The gluten-free crust for the pizza... yeah. It was way undercooked. It tasted like I had put sugar-free ketchup on white bread. I know how that tastes, because I was a stoner in high school. I do appreciate that gluten-free things on the menu exist though, since the birthday guy legit has Celiac disease, and this restaurant is close to where he lives. Maybe, I would've appreciated it more, if I hadn't had amazing vegan, gluten-free pizza 2 days prior. But this pizza was like a bear in a tutu following the Beatles. I know delicious gluten-free crust is possible. This could've been more if it had more time in the oven. And it should've had all the time in the world, because it took over an hour to arrive.   Still, while I wouldn't go out of my way to visit this place again, if invited, I'd probably give them another go. Like I said, I do really appreciate that they have gluten-free options available, and the servers seemed like they would be a lot nicer if they weren't so overwhelmed. I'd probably decline an invitation where there were 30 guests again, but maybe with a couple of pals."}
{"text":"Our group landed here after a flight. We were all very hungry and the Yelp reviews enticed us. Food was amazing! The French onion soup was beautiful - the bread & cheese on top were of perfect consistency, and the soup itself, divine. It disappeared quickly! Meat poutine was a monstrous portion. Would definitely return!"}
{"text":"Nice looking place, nice setting and good selection of beers. I went there for happy hour in Sunday. Their HH pizza is too small to be an appetizer. You pay extra for toppings so it's not a deal at all. My pork poutine was big enough but the gravy was tasteless as the chicken bites. Not worth my visit"}
{"text":"If you don't mind a crowd and some noise, this is the place to be. The food is delicious with large proportions and I have not been disappointed by the service yet.  There are deals every day of the week and a bar and patio to sit in as well. The maps of Calgary and street signs on the walls really give the restaurant a sense of community, and that they belong in the NW.  The restaurant itself opened up after a well known, community favorite pizza place flooded in the 2000's. Rather than repair, the owner sold the property to 4th Spot, and they in turn bought the old family pizza recipe! They have their own pizzas, as well as the family classics from the old owners.  My recommendations: - The Chipotle Fried Avocado Burger. It is a massive burger with two halves of fried avocado on a well seasoned patty. - The Cheesy Pickup Line Wings. Truly delicious, with your choice of dipping sauce. Fried cheese on my wings? Yes please."}
{"text":"Food was very good. Unfortunately my body did not think so. Party of 4. 3 of us had poutine. Same 3 went straight to the washroom for 30 min afterward."}
{"text":"If you are looking for amazing food and great service in the NW like we were, this is the place! We came in before the rush around 3pm. Perfect, not too busy. We took a seat on the upper level. The menu is varied and there is something for everyone here. The food does take awhile to come out but it is worth the wait! There are quite a few beer on tap and also bottles. I do not even drink beer but I enjoyed an Apricot Wheat Ale just because it sounded so good. OMG, I left this restaurant so full after that beer and the food! Hubby had a maple whiskey burger that came recommended and he opted for it as the patties are homemade here. (very few items are apparently made from frozen which makes my heart sing!) The burger was very good. I tried it and my only neutral comment would be that I did not taste any whiskey nor maple. Still, a huge sandwich with yummy bacon, ketchup on the side and you can opt for poutine that comes as a side for $2.49 more. Worth it. Yay for Quebec cheese curds! I normally would go for thin crust pizza but I wanted to try the original dough from the 60's when this recipe was born and I was not disappointed! I got the loaded veg to try and save on SOME calories and wow! Very good - the crust was so buttery and not too thick at all, not doughy one bit. I would get it again. We wanted to start with the mussels but they were out of those. :(  Next time! After 4pm, the pizzas are 1/2 off on Mondays and then Wed nights are half off bottles of wine. If you cannot finish it, they will cork it and you can bring it home! Tues nights from 7-10pm, local one man bands are hired to come and play in the upper lounge for some variety. The atmosphere was good, the place was clean and we enjoyed the alternative rock that was playing. All in all, a great afternoon that did not break the bank and we will return!"}
{"text":"I had the perogy pizza, it was surprisingly good, I have nothing negative to say about the food, however the service was pretty sub par, the waitress was pretty unhelpful and not all that friendly. And as there is no reservation system, you might be waiting for a while."}
{"text":"Love the Mount Pleasant (drink).Love the brushetta. Service can sometimes be lacking considering all the staff I see when I'm there."}
{"text":"The food was very good, but getting our salad and burger from the kitchen was very slow even though place still had empty tables."}
{"text":"I went here with my boyfriend and 3 other friends. I decided to get something small (or at least I thought it was small) I ordered the pulled pork poutine listed as an 'intro' on the menu. The rest of the gang got most of their picks from the 'intro' selection as well. Once we got our food I was amazed to see that my pulled pork poutine didn't really look like an 'intro'. Once the plate landed in front of me I said: \"Oh shit!\" The plate was HUGE! And lets just call it what it is, an intro is an appetizer, not a meal.. and for reals, this was a freaking meal. This looked like it could have fed the five of us. It wasn't bad, it was just too much for something they consider to be 'intro'. The fries were pretty mediocre. I have to say, the pulled pork helped this meal A LOT! I kinda wished the waitress warned me how big this was.   Then there was my boyfriends meals. My boyfriend was so disappointed with the shrimp inferno. He loves his shrimp and was disappointed to have bad sauce that came with the shrimp. It wasn't so much inferno, more like ocean sauce. I've tasted it.. it tasted like ocean water.   The rest of the gang had no complaints about their picks off the menu.  I don't think I'd go here again. It's not because of my poutine (which I ended up finishing within the week) it's just not my cup of tea. I'm sure the rest of the menu selection is just as good (maybe not the shrimp inferno) It's just not a go to spot for me."}
{"text":"Went in for date night last night. Seated quickly and server was very attentive. Started with Bruschetta, which was unique. Small pieces of cheese toast that you could load up your own toppings. I had the mac and cheese, which was the cheesiest macaroni ever! Also had the perfect amount of sliced sausage baked inside.  One appetizer, two entrees, a glass of wine, and a pint of beer; all for about $65!"}
{"text":"I'm on the fence with 4th Spot. I've been there four times over the last year or so and twice they screwed up our order. The first time they brought out the wrong pizza entirely. I didn't notice right away cause it was basically the veg version of what I ordered. The second time our order was taking forever, all the tables around us who got there after us were getting their food. Turns out there was something wrong with our order and they were making it now (order was two pizzas straight off the menu, nothing crazy).  Both times they remedied it by comping the one pizza and offering free wings the second time, but 40 minutes in I'm just hungry and annoyed.  The other two times I went it was fine, the service is always friendly but there's something wrong in the kitchen. They're batting 500 in my books which isn't worth the risk (or the wait times)."}
{"text":"Friday night was packed - but the restaurant is large enough that there are always a few tables free. Grasshopper was on special that night - as well as baseball steak with coleslaw and sweet potato fries. Fries were great and my bf's dad really enjoyed the steak, though he made a joke about the size of the steak. I ordered the salmon and soba salad, which was refreshing and very filling. The salmon was cooked well - not overcooked and tender. The soba noodles were actually ichiban type noodles - the thin curly type. Boiled asparagus spears were mixed in with a pile of spinach leaves. I sampled the 'traditional' style pizza - I like how crust looked like a pie crust (as in apple pie) and the filling was rich and cheesy with lots of onions and meats. My friend ordered a burger which looked great. I would go back for the burgers and pizza. I like the environment - it's got good energy and it's nice to go to a bar and not be the oldest person."}
{"text":"Half priced wing and wine Wednesdays? Sign me up! Better yet, you don't need to sign up for anything. You just show up and order a bottle of wine for half the price. It's THAT simple. 4th spot is kind of like a local, non-chain version of Joey's (What was Joey Tomatoes, not to be confused with the fish n chips place.)  Ok caveman dieters - there are salads and then there are SALADS. If your idea of the perfect salad is actually hearty steak dinner on top of a bed of leaves just for fun, you gotta check out the Matadore Salad. This thing is 2 large BBQ skewers loaded up with marinated steak, peppers and onions, a good size chunk of grilled focaccia and feta. Now that's a meal! But just to be nice, they drop all of that on a pile a lettuce and mixed greens. This was possibly the first time in my life I've asked to have my salad packed up to go.  There's a dining room as soon as you walk in but if you left the kids at home and are 18+ I think you'll find the upstairs lounge is a little nicer of a place to hang out. They have booths and the whole area just feels a little more cozy. If you can find your house on the gigantic wall map, they'll let you mark it with a shiny star sticker. A fun game after a few half priced bottles of wine. :)"}
{"text":"We moved into the area and always saw this placed was always packed. We went on a slower night and it was by far one of the best experiences we've had. Great food and friendly staff. We seem to also take friends to this location when we are near."}
{"text":"Went here for YYC Pizza Week and had their 403 Meaty Breakfast Pizza! Delicious and great service! Love the atmosphere! Come try their unique wing flavours on Wednesdays."}
{"text":"The whole family has been here several times already!  This place has a great ambience (neighbourhood pub/restaurant) and attentive service.  It can be noisy on busy nights.  From Mondays to Thursdays, they have dine-in deals: e.g Mondays is pizza night, Tuesdays is pasta night,Thursdays is $10 burger and $5.50 pint night, and Fridays is steak sandwich night. Tonight (Wednesday) they had wine and wings for half price.  I couldn't possibly pass this deal up. The bacon maple wings were lightly battered and drizzled with maple syrup and bits of real bacon (instead of those fake bacon bits). They were a delicious combination of sweet and salty smokiness--what more could a bacon lover ask for?  Another pound of these wings, please!  The honey roasted garlic wings and  sweet chilli coconut wings are also worth ordering.   Our favourites include: baked French onion soup (served in a large crock bowl topped with a generous portion of cheese and puff pastry), steak sandwich(the steak is cooked and seasoned perfectly), the Bruce Lee (thin crust pizza topped with teriyaki chicken, red onion, pineapple, mozza, green onions) and the butcher pizza(traditional crust pizza with pepperoni, beef, bacon, and spicy Spolumbo's sausage).    My son can't wait to come as a regular on Wednesdays once he gets his braces removed!"}
{"text":"burger was barely done.  the soup was a redeemer.  nothing special about side salads,  was just a clump of romaine heart thrown at my salad.  potatoe salad was fine and tacos fine.  pizza is nothing spectacular.  the only thing that was a 5/5 was the cute factor of my waitress,  I was stunned to learn that she didnt receive 100% of my tip.   manager made excuses for it,  but fact is cooks should be compwnsated enough for them to hussle and make top quality food efficiently,  the tip is for the server who in essence represents the entire restaurant.  if 40% of wait staff tip is stolen, it will detract from wjat the customer sees as the restaurant -  their server."}
{"text":"Visited on a Monday night and was surprised to find how busy the place was. They told us it would be a 20min walk and took down our name and number so that they could text us. If you plan to visit, know that this restaurant is on the No Wait App so you can put your name down in advance to save you some time if there is a wait.   Hostess and servers were competent, but everyone was literally running around everywhere. Our server notified us that certain items would take longer to make, which we appreciated. I think they seemed understaffed, which obviously happens, but hopefully this was an off time and is not always the case. The only time our server kind of took the time to talk to us was when she tried to talk us up for a tip while we were paying lol.   We were seated in the lounge near the bar which I would not recommend if you want to be able to hear whoever you are having dinner with.. It was way too loud! I could barely hear myself think. There were some people at the table next to us and a few individuals who were clearly way too drunk but the servers continued to take drink orders. I would just avoid the lounge area to not have to deal with this next time.   We had the stuffed burger and the mac n cheese. The burger was great but when they asked me if I wanted chips with my burger, I was expecting fries chips, not.. Actual potato like lays chips. Maybe it was dumb of me to assume but now ya'll know.   The mac n cheese was good, but nothing to write home about. I think the dish would look a lot more \"restaurant-like\" and a step on from KD's if they used better macaroni and not the plain ones that look like KDs.  They have specials every day so I would be interested in checking this place out for some of those. I would also like to sit in the dining area next time to avoid drunk people walking into my chair every 5 minutes.   Overall, I think this place is a 3.5 with it's overall service, atmosphere, and food. It's a friendly neighbourhood pub with decent food so you can't complain, but I would not drive across the city to eat here."}
{"text":"Great pizza, cool lounge-like atmosphere. The burgers are also pretty fantastic. It's harts to go wrong here as far as the menu goes!"}
{"text":"First time here:  The food is amazing, local, well priced. The beer is amazing, local, well priced. The atmosphere is amazing, local, welcome.  I WILL ALWAYS COME BACK!"}
{"text":"One of my family's favourite restaurants- if not our number 1 place. The steak sandwich is always cooked as requested (med rare), tender and juicy.  The olive oyl pizza is a favourite, and the house salad is always great.  We actually haven't been disappointed by anything in the menu.  The burgers are so good, hand formed and actually make it hard to eat a normal frozen BBQ burger in between our visits to this restaurant.  Love this place- reasonable pricing, tasty menu, and family friendly!"}
{"text":"Really pleasantly surprised!! We took our two kids and it was very family friendly with a great kids menu and even better regular menu. It was $5 off burgers when we went and ours were delicious, the chipotle and fried avocado.....yum! Sweet potato fries were great. Will %100 go back! Next time we'll try out the pizza night :) Only thing was no reservations and it's a busy place, but once we got it the service was very good."}
{"text":"My first time at 4th spot and the inferno prawns are delish!!!!!!!!  The prawns were cooked to perfection. And the truffle and cheese pizza my friend had was also really good as well. However the mussels were on the small side and kinda cold.    I would come back for the prawns!!"}
{"text":"This has become our go-to spot, especially for happy hour. The deals for happy hour are amazing - $4 for delicious chicken bites, personal pizza, nachos and more! My husband and I were lucky to (coincidentally) make it there for happy hour, which ends at 5, and we ordered the nachos, maple chicken bites, pizza, and the juicy Lucy burger with the French onion soup as a side. My husband also had 2 virgin Caesars. We got all this for $42! Obviously we had A LOT of leftovers to take with us when we were too full to eat any more! Everything was so tasty and the burger was probably one of the best I've ever had. If you haven't seen pictures of the French onion soup, check them out and trust me - it lives up to the hype! The nachos were totally not what we were expecting but were so tasty! Instead of nacho chips they were potato chips. Yum! We loved everything so much that we came back later in the week with our son, as the restaurant is kid friendly. We came on a Tuesday, which happened to be pasta Tuesday. I got the spaghetti carbonara and my husband had the mac and cheese. Both were amazing. I could go on and on about this place, but you'd be better off to stop reading and just go try it for yourself!"}
{"text":"We went for dinner here after drooling over the photos of everyone else's plates here on Yelp. Service was amazing and staff was informative about gluten free options. We had the inferno prawns (that sauce ) and the poutine. We never once reached for the salt; everything was seasoned well. Our main course choices of the Fish Tacos (gluten free) along with the Fried Chipotle Avocado Burger, were full of flavours. The char-broiled taste of the burger made it even better. We decided after the appetizers that we would be back again. By far one of the best meals and ambience I've ever experienced in Calgary. Job well done."}
{"text":"Literally the best French onion soup I have ever had. I was home for Christmas and went back twice for it. Sooo good. I dream of it....I'm not joking!  Their pizza is really great too!!"}
{"text":"A comfortable place. Great service. The server caught me looking at her bum. Haven't tried the food. They have Dictador rum :D"}
{"text":"We arrived at 9:30 on a Saturday and the place was pretty empty, so it was understandable that they were closing early.  We ordered fries and the calamari, both tasted okay but we found the calamari dish quite small. The service was great! Very attentive and happy. Overall a very nice experience."}
{"text":"Great food. Good mix of restaurant and bar. Good place to come with friends or family. Pizza is excellent."}
{"text":"It was Stampede week, I'd been getting up at 4:30am every morning to volunteer with pancake breakfasts, and up until midnight every night showing my Australian friend around town. We were sitting around home, I was falling asleep on the couch, no ideas what to do for dinner, so long as it wasn't pancakes.  Enter: Yelp.  Can't exactly remember the criteria I used but it had to be within a certain distance of downtown, great reviews and somewhere with a variety of foods.  4th Spot totally fit this bill. Three of us went, we didn't partake in the drinks but we did each have different meals. We were all pleased with our selections. Service was great, and the decor/atmosphere was pretty neat.  There was quite the selection of wine - would like to go back and try some!  Review #23 of Yelp's 30 Day Challenge 2012"}
{"text":"Super friendly service, good food--the pulled pork pizza was absolutely delicious--and a cozy ambiance add up to an experience just about anyone can enjoy. Their French onion soup is humongous and topped with puff pastry. Great casual cozy atmosphere welcomes families with young children--it gets noisy and crowded on a Friday evening, and even though they don't take reservations, the wait is worth it. There's parking in a lot (some covered) and on the street."}
{"text":"Lots of good reviews on this place, which is why we went there but it turned out to be a bad choice. The service was okay, if maybe a little insincere, the main complaint is the food. We shared a small plate of the smallest mussels known to man, the seemed oddly a little cold and were served with one chunk of slightly stale bread, not a good start. I tried the chicken tenders, the tasted of old oil, they seemed to have been deep fried some hours ago and either reheated or deep fried again in that old oil, fries were equally disgusting. I cannot imagine how this place got good reviews, although it did encourage to shun such terrible food in favour of healthier eating, Nice looking place, terrible food."}
{"text":"I've been coming here since it was reinvented. Formerly Caruso's, an excellent pizza place, 4th spot carries on the excellent pizza tradition.  It has beautiful decor that is starting to see some wear, notedly the paint by the hostess station. Fortunately the chalkboard illustrations around the restaurant draw your eyes there.  We had decent service but it was much slower and less attentive than I'm used to there. It was busy for sure (20 min wait for a table on a Saturday night isn't bad) but not busy enough to warrant the gaps in service.   We were there to kick off Poutine Week so we checked out the three varieties and then asked our server if all of them go towards the Mealshare purpose of the Week. He didn't know anything about Poutine Week, even though its been published for weeks in magazines that it was happening. We got it sorted out though. He told us the Butchers Shoppe poutine was a big portion that was a good starter for us to share.  False! This amazingly delicious poutine was humongous. With two very hungry people we still had a hard time finishing it. When the burger we ordered to share arrived, we laughed and asked for it to go.  That poutine though, its delicious. Shaved beef, Spolumbos sausage, bacon, cheese, and BBQ sauce. The only thing it needs it more fries. The topping to fry ratio was a wee bit lacking. Still good though!   I give 4 stars because I have had consistent good service there over the years and the food is stellar. If you're a pasta or mushroom lover, you need to try the Mushroom Ravioli. Warning, contains almonds and deliciousness. Avoid if you're allergic to either!"}
{"text":"We loved it all! The poutine, cider, maple bacon, salt n peppa wings all yum!! Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"Driven by here for years and finally stopped in for first time.  May have found one of the new favorite places to go.  Great service in the bar, ordered a steak sandwich and she ordered the maple canuck burger.  Both came out quick and perfectly cooked and tasted amazing!  Lots of craft beers from around western Canada on tap.  A little expensive for some of the pints but whatever.   Amazing food and well priced,  great atmosphere.   Highly recommended and will be back for sure!!!"}
{"text":"Food and menu are great but they play the \"delay until they have 2 drinks\" game to perfection. Not usually a problem until they soak you $11.00 for a glass of Chardonnay. We will search for other less expensive options in the future. With raised prices and crazy wine prices we will walk further."}
{"text":"All I had was the calamari and a beer, but the service was friendly and the appetizer was great. Will be coming back to try some of the fantastic unique pizza combinations they have."}
{"text":"Always a great place to catch up with friends. The atmosphere is really nice. Not too loud, friendly staff and, as always, a great menu. I had the steak sandwich and others In our group had the Cobb salad, wings and tacos. We all really enjoyed it. The gluten free Mac and cheese was also shared by all.  Parking can be a bit difficult, but other than that, I strongly recommend stopping in."}
{"text":"Since my last review I've been here several times.  In 2 words THIS PLACE ROCKS - ok that was 3 but for a neighbourhood restaurant 4th Spot is truly incredible.  Everything we've ever eaten here is fabulous & flavourful.  We've been for pizza night on Monday's, dropped by on Tuesday to see live music & enjoy cheap pasta, delight in half price wings & 1/2 price bottles of wine on Wednesdays and of course made it in on Friday/Saturday to avoid cooking at home.  Which means I still need to explore Thursdays and Sundays LOL.  But what really stands out is the customer service received regularly and more specifically on a night we ordered takeout pizza.  We said we'd be in at a particular time to pick it up (4 pizzas) and it was not ready when hubs/daughter arrived...in fact they forgot about it. Without even blinking an eye my daughter was given an ice tea (her fav drink treat) and big slice of ice cream cake.  20 minutes later the pizzas were ready to go and much to our surprise given to us Free Of Charge!!!   Such incredible service, food, ambience and the wine glasses are fuller ;).   It is also kid friendly!  This place is a gem and Bill the owner, incredible guy who cares about his customers!"}
{"text":"Every time we visit our son and family we have to go here, just a quick walk from their home.  The fish tacos are unbelievable paired with a Caesar salad. Others in our party had pizza which looked fantastic, shrimp tacos and of course the chocolate cake with ice cream. Will be back have not been disappointed"}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night.  We used the Nowait app and it went flawlessly (still had to wait a bit since we got there early).    I had the kitchen sink penne with a daily soup (tomato).  The soup was far from being a regular boring old tomato soup.  I think the tomatoes were smoked or roasted which gave the soup alot of depth and definitely kicked it up a notch.  The pasta dish was a good size and filling.  There was a ton of things going on since it was everything but the kitchen sink, however I could've done away with the meatloaf since I felt like texturally it was out of place and ended up just breaking apart.    My gf ordered the chipotle fried avocado burger and upgraded the side to french onion soup.  We both saw pictures of the french onion soup and decided we had to try it.  We were not disappointed at all.  The puff pastry on top kept the soup hot and also kept the pastry flaky.  The soup itself was not overly salty (alot of places over-reduce their soup) and the sweetness of the onions went well with the cheese curds.  Definitely a must-get item at this place.  The burger was good although I couldn't really taste the chipotle aioli.    We also ordered a Pimm's cup.  It was very watered down and didn't taste like anything, however they were nice enough to swap it out for a beer instead.  Our companions also ordered a Caesar and a white wine peach sangria.  They also found the drinks to be watered down, so perhaps skip the cocktails and stick to the wine/beers here.  Our companions also ordered a pizza, however they told us that it was dropped in the kitchen before it could come.  So they took it off their bill which was nice of them, however it was a very long wait for the rest of us and we were basically done eating by the time they received their pizza.  I'll be back for their upscale bar food and pair it with their french onion soup.  They have some additional parking in the back if it gets busy as well."}
{"text":"Ok, they get bumped up to 4-stars because:  Their staff are usually friendly and lovely. The burgers.. oh... so good! It has a cozy feeling to it, and usually good for bigger groups.  Going back!"}
{"text":"I really like 4th Spot. It's the place I send people when I'm not sure what they're food tastes are... or they're not too sure how far outside of their own comfort zone they're really willing to go. It's the safe zone of a neighbourhood restaurant except with food that I'm actually willing to say is good! Now, it's not your fancy pants restaurant with creative and artfully presented dishes, but it is a place with reall great burgers, pasta dishes to fill the most intense of carb cravings, pizzas that rest on tomato cans and plenty of other food and drink choices. And it's family-friendly.  If you have friends who like a hearty meal, they won't leave hungry here. Also great weekday specials... and local beer! Not to mention a good wine selection too... you can enjoy the restaurant in the front or the lounge in the back. Or, in the very back, two private rooms you can book for functions and the likes.  Food I love: - Maple canuck burger - Lady & the tramp spaghetti and meatballs - Vitamin sea - Mahalo pizza - Porkers pie pizza  Note: Pizza can also be requested on a gluten free crust.  Drawback: The acoustics in the washroom. You can hear everything from the conversation of the tables just outside the door! Although I don't know if they can hear everything too or if that's just a one way thing. I've also heard people say it can get pretty loud whenever they have live music playing and it can spoil any chance of conversation up in the lounge.  Tip for 4th Spot: Right now your menu link on your website only goes to one page on your menu."}
{"text":"5 stars for lunch! I haven't been here for dinner but lunch service is great. I have been here twice for lunch and I love when service is consistent, friendly, and quick during this meal.  Their menu has lots of variety so it is good for a group with different preferences for food. I had the Jamaican tacos which had a nice kick of spice and tang to it.  I had a bite of everyone else's dish which ranged from burgers to their pasta. Their penne didn't stand out but their burgers are so delicious. Good portion size, creative combinations and packed full of flavour. I definitely recommend one of their burgers as top menu item choice.  I also love how their fries (if you choose it as your side) come in a cute little metal basket. The visual appeal makes the fries even more appetizing."}
{"text":"I live in Toronto now and I really really really miss my favorite go to spot in Calgary!!!  This is my favorite restaurant in Calgary!!  It was my husband and my go to restaurant!  We lived all the way in Woodbine and would drive all the way to the NW for this restaurant at least once a month and have never been disappointed!!!!  The prices were so reasonable and they had fantastic daily specials.  Living in Toronto now....this is what I am craving....their pizzas!!!!  They make one of the best pizzas in the city!  Greek style pizza and on Monday they have their pizza special.  I cannot find a pizzeria restaurant in Toronto that is even close.  I also miss the Maple Canuck burger with a side of French onion soup.  The soup is out of this world and such a good deal if you order it as a side.  Their wings, their stuff burger, their chocolate cake.  I am really craving food from there right now.  Just wish I wasn't so far away!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were finally able to get away for a little short vacation this past summer (albeit just to Calgary), but we had plenty of friends to visit from his art school days that we hadn't seen in a while, so we made a week of it.   One of his friends lives in Mount Pleasant, so he brought his main squeeze, and we were able to walk the 2 or 3 blocks to this place. We' driven by and thought it looked intriguing, and Jim and the squeeze said it was fabulous, so in we went. The guys were able to order their favorite beers, and we all ordered food. There was at least one of the huge burgers in the mix, and I think a club. I got some sort of veggie burger. (wish they'd get finished with their website so I culd remember just what I had!). We agreed that everything was delicious.   We sat in the very back. The decor is gorgeous and understated, with old photos and maps of Calgary that have been handsomely framed. The lighting is nice and subtle. Not too dark, not too bright, and the paint colors were well chosen. We actually commented on the decor, because it was so striking.  Our waitress was super friendly and funny, we had great food, great beer, and great company. That's what eating out is all about."}
{"text":"I love 4th Spot. I probably go here once a week since I live nearby. They have some great daily specials and live music on Tuesdays. I enjoy the relaxed vibe, friendly service, and the food is good too. It can be really busy so don't be surprised if you end up waiting for a table. My favourite things to eat are the French onion soup, fish tacos and maple Canuck burger. The fries are good (crispy) but usually pretty salty. We just ask for light salt on the fries. My friends have raved about the inferno shrimp and pizza. Awesome beers on tap as well. So happy to live walking distance from this place!"}
{"text":"It's not often that I'd give a business five stars right off the bat, but I have not one issue with my first experience, which was last night with a group of friends.  It was recommended by a few people in our group who had been here before and really enjoyed it.  One of the girls raved about the yam fries.  The reno work is excellent and I think it's a super cozy, casual, high energy environment.  The place was busy and it was comfortably warm.  I usually notice these things because I'm often cold and many places have cold air blasting on you from a vent somewhere.  Being that winter has just struck, I was excited that the restaurant had good temperature regulation.  It might sound silly, but it's the little things, you know?    Our server was friendly and attentive.  My spouse and I tried the calamari and dip, which was awesome.  Others at our table tried the poutine as an appetizer and the portion was huge.  For a main I tried the meatloaf and substituted the mashed potatoes for yam fries.  Both were delicious and again, the portions were massive.  The fresh vegetables were perfectly done for my taste.  Not overcooked, leaving a tiny bit of crunch.  I had enough leftovers for another meal.  Grasshopper was on special for $5.  Perfect.  Prices are very reasonable.  Our group sat there for three hours and not once were we asked about ordering more or pressured to leave.  An added bonus is that there's lots of free parking in the area.    I'd recommend 4th Spot to anyone and am interested in going on a night when they have live entertainment in the lounge.  Yay for marvelous neighborhood restaurants!  19/30 for Yelp's 30 Day Challenge"}
{"text":"Hands down, the best ribs I have ever had! (Better even than the Palomino.) Service was lacking, though the wait for our food wasn't long even though it was a busy Friday night. I'll definitely be back, the menu looks amazing and there's definitely a lot more I'd like to try!"}
{"text":"Food looked awesome but was lacking flavour. I got the drums n mac but subbed the mac for fries.  Drums were fried crispy and hot but the coating needed some salt and seasoning. The maple syrup was a nice touch but was the only flavour punch.  It came with an apple Cole slaw that had absolutely no flavour! There were other veggies, corn on the cob and asparagus, that were equally boring in taste.  Odd thing is while my chicken was piping hot, my fries were merely room temperature. Prices are very high for the quality and quantity of food. Not sure if I'll be back or not, still on the fence with this place."}
{"text":"We went here for lunch while we were in Calgary. I had the beef   chimichurri tacos. They were a bit dry at first so I tried their house hot sauce. The tacos were perfect with the hot sauce, the hot sauce is smokey and spicy. Overall the service was good and timely."}
{"text":"We came here on a Tuesday at 5:30. Parking is dicey. No wait at this time. I had the penne and it was pretty good. Great portions. My husband had the meatloaf and he said it was delicious. It's not cheap, the meatloaf was $20. Also, my husband ordered wild turkey and it was the smallest portion of wild turkey I've ever seen poured out / and it was $8!"}
{"text":"This spot was awesome. The Canuck burger that I had was to die for and the ingredients were super fresh a spot I would definitely go back to for sure at some point. It was a beautiful night to sit outside on the patio."}
{"text":"4th spot is the 1st spot on my list of local faves. Equally great for family get togethers or business lunches. The little fry baskets get me every time, and the pizza is delish. I am also a vegetarian, and have never had a problem with the menu, lots of veggie choices which is a plus!"}
{"text":"My parents wanted me to check out this place for a while so we headed here tonight for dinner. Inside is a very updated interior with dark mood lit walls.   The menu was excellent, there were choices like Poutine on the appetizers.  Salad choices offered a variety as well as pasta dishes, sandwiches, meatloaf, burgers, pizzas and features each night. Tuesday is apparently Pasta night and you can get half price pasta on all the regular dishes. One night is Big Rock night, Friday, and you get a deal on beer that night too.  I had the Steakout sandwich and the 6 oz of sirloin was amazingly tender, it has been a really long time since I had a steak from Alberta and it was so good. I had the choice to have fries or salad etc and chose the Caesar, it had small bits of bacon so for the veggies out there make sure you hold the bacon ;)  Some of the other choices eaten at our table were excellent burger and a pasta dish that arrived with lots of tomatoes and various vegetables, the presentation on the all dishes was excellent. The burger came with lots of fries and a side of gravy and the burger was huge.  Steak sandwich with the side salad is a filling but some might feel light dish as they don't do all that garnish type stuff on the plate. It was perfect for me, but some folks if they are really hungry might have felt the side of fries was a better choice.  When you pay they also have wireless Debit machines ;) Love these modern options (rarely do you see this in the city I live unless you are at an open air market)"}
{"text":"First experience here. Wasnt bad- but not blown away. $5 individual happy hour pizzas were decent. Chicken bites were good. Kettle chip nachoes looked really good but were dry and not very good. Almost like they had been sitting out for awhile. Overall not bad- would try again."}
{"text":"The food and atmosphere was great and our server was fantastic!  Try their house made hot sauce. Yummy with a great kick. We will definitely be back. Gluten free selections are really great not to mention the knowledge the server had. She came back to tell us that the enchilada shells are deep fried in the same oil as other items so they wouldn't be 100% gluten free and not best for a Celiac. Love that she was thoughtful and knowledgeable enough to come back. Used the NoWait app and walked right in on a busy night ... highly recommend using it!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Their weekly specials are amazing no matter what night you come. The food and drink is reasonably priced, they have great service and a sunny west facing patio. It gets busy every night for dinner so it's a good idea to come early, but there's usually room to sit at the bar and the wait is usually not too long. Their food is unique and creative but still has the elements of familiarity that you can enjoy. Heading there for the yyc poutine tonight! It's also the only place (besides their sister restaurant Spot On) that has a wine and wings deal on Wednesdays!"}
{"text":"I love how this pub has a special going on essentially every night. Pasta Tuesdays are wicked!! Delicious pasta, HUGE portions for $11. I recommend The Everything But The Kitchen Sink pasta. Mac and cheese and stuffed pasta were also pretty good.  Wing and Wine Wednesdays is a pretty sweet deal. The wings aren't phenomenal, but like I said, It's a sweet deal with the wine. If you like spicy, go straight for the tough guy, and skip the red mile.   Really nice, clean pub with a good crowd. Excellent service!  It's an awesome pub.   Can't wait to try Pizza Mondays."}
{"text":"The French onion soup was one of the best I've ever had. The giant pastry on top makes it even better. Had the stampeder dip, best ever. Can't get any better."}
{"text":"Wow. Great food great vibe. This place is tucked away and a worthwhile find. I highly reckoned for either a quick bite or more substantial lunch. I was in the neighborhood used reviews to decide on it and was not disappointed."}
{"text":"I really, really enjoyed 4th spot. We had a great little party there, and having private rooms booked came incredibly handy!  Food was really good. Portion on a smallish side, but kitchen work was very decent! Drinks... well, I would say that choices were a bit limited if you go by glass - but that is pretty common overall. Bottle-wise, there was a lot to choose from...  Service was amazing, big thank you guys!! Very helpful and nice. I wish parking was as good, but alas, it was only on these tiny residential streets around - with lots of them requiring permit and already packed with cars.  I would definitely like to return though, place is worth it."}
{"text":"Walked in waited to be seated....the person who greeted us was SOUR...I told her I didnt want to be in the bottom area not in the lounge part...she stood there and stared at me...I said...UP THERE!!! You're looking at me like I am crazy....the other girl took us up and asked if we were ok with tall stools...I said sure...I'm easy that way although I do like a booth. Once seated I saw that 2 booths were empty as well as two low tables...not sure why out only option was TALL CHAIRS???  Was told about the burger/pint special and I asked is the veggie burger was vegan...was told she would check...  Brought drinks...then came back to take order...\"Is the veggie burger vegan???\" Off she went to ask.  So as usual I ended up having to order pizza with no cheese and a salad.  Common people..ONE VEGAN DISH WOULD KILL YA??? no idea how many of us are out there telling all the other vegans where to eat...  Not coming back....service was meh meh...pizza was meh meh..salad was good but how do you screw up on that?   For a place that is local to me...I was hoping for better...this is the 3rd time here...no more chances and no recommendations."}
