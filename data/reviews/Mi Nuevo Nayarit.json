{"text":"The food was very GOOD!!!  they've been open for only four months. the fish and shrimp were very fresh. I will be coming back"}
{"text":"This is a sea food Mexican style place.  We were there on Saturday (today) for lunch.  Place was half full with good ambience and clean. We were seated right away.  While we took a look at menu waiter brought us chips, salsa and a fish broth. All was very good.  We order coconuts filled with shrimp and octopus.  They are cut open, empty water into a glass, then scraped the coconut pulp. Pulp goes back in coconut shell together with shrimp, octopus, onions, cucumber and tomatoes.  They serve it with cucumber slices, avocado, saltines and limes.  Let me tell u it was delicious!!! My mom had a Jamaica agua (hibiscus iced tea) and I had a Clamato preparado. Which is tomato juice with lime juice, soy sauce and chili powder over ice.  Delicious as well.  The only reason I don't give them five stars is because there was a band playing; which is typical on these places; but they were using speakers which made it extremely loud.  Don't get me wrong they sing pretty good but place isn't big enough for them to use surround sound.  My mom and I couldn't carry a conversation because of the music being so loud.  Other than that place is worth the time and money."}
{"text":"Muy lento el servicio 1 hora esperamos la comida y nunca salió y nos quería cobrar la comida que nunca vimos. PÉSIMO SERVICIO. No querían cancelar la orden."}
{"text":"This is our new favorite seafood restaurant, they have a great variety in the menu, I recommend the tostada chuvy duvi (I think that's the name) that was so delicious, one of my kids ordered tacos gobernador and of course I had to take a bite, they were delicious as well, live music and micheladas.... what else can you ask for?   Next time I'm having the camarones chelin, the table next to us ordered it and they looked boom!"}
{"text":"Bad service and tasteless food with overpriced tacos.  We had to go around asking to be seated and then search for a waitress.  We felt like we had to beg for service and the food was just plain and tasteless."}
{"text":"Awesome food, good service, and reasonably priced. Only regret not trying the chuvi duvi."}
{"text":"The food was blehhhh, the shrimp ceviche was tasteless the marisol tostada's sweet and spicy sauce is literally ketchup. If you take a party of six or larger be aware they will charge you gratuity and scratch it off the ticket with a sharpie and not let you know what the charge is for in hopes of getting a double tip. I won't be back not because of the food but the staff, hopefully you can be a little more honest about the charges on the bills with your future customers."}
{"text":"So I basically just had the best Carne Asada burrito of my life. Hot and fresh with so much flavor, the steak had just a hint of char it was amazing.. So I came across this place after being detoured off the I10.. so glad to have found this gem!! I can't wait to come back and try some of the shrimp dishes. Fast and friendly service, very busy at 11:30 so you know it's good. I also had the horchata it was perfect! Highly recommend, they have a drive through when it's late just drive straight to the window and they will get you taken care of."}
{"text":"Bomb food! I had the Tosta Marisol and the Fish Burrito and couldn't be happier with how it turned out. I will definitely be coming back here."}
{"text":"The food and service was good. I tried the crab  and a Shrimp  tostada. They brought out both fairly quick. They had a reasonable amount of food. Some good chipotle sauce would have helped. The place is not too big and I am sure it will get full easily. I plan on coming back to try other food. They have lots of items in their menu."}
{"text":"Just in town for the day. I was looking for something unique to eat besides the regular burgers and fries. Came across this restaurant and was not disappointed. They bring you chips and consomé to start. The consomé is fire. I ordered  a tostada marisol and a mixta and was not let down. Amazing. I also enjoyed that on a Monday night they had live music. Definitely coming here every time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Y'all this place ain't all that. The food is ok. The fish tacos are bland until you add some lime and some salsa. The ceviche order was ok as well. Don't go on a night they're playing music. You can't even hear yourself or the waitress speak."}
{"text":"It's so good, everything seems fresh. Service was okay, maybe because they were a little busy but I know why now."}
