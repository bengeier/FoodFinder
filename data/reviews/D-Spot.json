{"text":"Amazing spot they just have their soft opening I would definitely recommend that place love it the bistro looks amazing they did a great job the staff is so friendly and top always asking if we need anything and the dessert is over the top tasted so good we just ordered a \"my crepe ate your brownie\" and a cappuccino and actually it's the first time I had such a good chocolate dessert it's so delicious and very filling. We really enjoyed it keep it like that and you guys gonna go far! Will definitely come again and recommend it to everyone"}
{"text":"Was looking for some late night dessert in Mississauga and noticed this fairly new opening! 

The menu had a decent amount of variety with the standard drinks, sundaes, crepes and waffles however they also offered some pancake options and even pizza and poutine!! 

We ordered the Cookielicious, which was definitely large enough to fill my dessert craving. Prices were pretty comparable to other dessert places (i.e. Demetres, Dunk n Dip) at about $20 for a serving that is enough for 2 people. Being a bit of an ice cream aficionado, I will admit their ice cream was subpar in quality to some other dessert places, scoop size was a bit smaller than usual and waffle texture was on the softer side. However the cookie and brownie portions were very rich and yummy!

Overall it was still a good experience! Staff was very friendly and conversational, the interior was very spacious and had lots of cute decor. Will definitely be back to try some other menu options!"}
{"text":"Great place very friendly staff, nice atmosphere and very tasty fulfilling plates. Definitely going back !!"}
{"text":"Visited D-spot last night with some friends and loved it.  We ordered the nachos with gyro and was a huge portion and enough for four people.  We also ordered the Mexican chicken crepe and was delicious with a side salad.  The desserts were a hit!!! The amazing selection and huge menu!!! Service was phenomenal.
We also loved the decor and attention to detail."}
{"text":"This is how you want a dessert place to look and feel - happy! The moment you enter it's bright, cheery, with pops of color everywhere! It's a great place for foodie photos, plenty of light, and good backgrounds. We went late at night, it was full of friends and families enjoying some sweets. Staff was friendly, food came out quickly. We had a couple of savory items including a butter chicken crepe and poutine, both very tasty, although I was not a fan of the fries, they were the \"coated\" kind. The desserts are impressive, as was the Belgium Hot Chocolate, the lava flow was a cool surprise! They do warn you on the menu that the desserts are sweet, they drizzle different sauces this is what takes them over the edge! The crepe dessert was excellent, with a smooth almond mocha ice cream filling! Everything is shareable, so bring some friends to partake in the fun!"}
{"text":"Visited this place with my wife, daughter and our friends and their kids.  First place is huge, clean and brightly lit.  Every customer friendly and inattentive to our needs.  Pricing when compared to Demettre Cafe is price slightly better.  I had a mango shake and my wife had a coffee, both delicious .  My wife had chocolate crepe which was a bit rich for me but you get a lot what you order.  I decided to try their butter chicken poutine and it was a wise choice, this place can do savoury dishes as well as sweet.  Our waiter told us it was their soft opening and only been open for a week and then the owner shown up both friendly and thanked us for compliments.   D-spot is open only from 1pm to 2am every day.  Maybe should open at 11am might get a few workplace employee to come over for lunch.  Overall we will visit this place again."}
{"text":"The dessert menu is very similar to Dunk in dip. The taste is not that great. Dunk n dip is a better option.   The food menu is limited. I would have given it a 3 start but my 14 year old son loved the food and desserts a lot so giving it 5 stars."}
{"text":"This place is so cute! From the wall and window decals to the colour scheme, everything is adorable! This place is very reminiscent of \"Spin\" or a cuter Demetres. Standard dessert type menu (waffles, crepes, cakes, ice cream), with a few savoury options. The staff are so sweet and so friendly, and I have been here twice and didn't feel rushed at all either time. I will definitely be back again :)."}
{"text":"We had the Cookie Monster waffle and Belgian hot chocolate, both were amazing. The hot chocolate was like drinking liquid chocolate. The atmosphere was great and our booth even had outlets, making it a great study spot. 

D Spot gave me Demetres vibes, but we would both prefer this. The menu is extensive and servers were nice."}
{"text":"I almost didn't come here and would have regretted it if I hadn't. Decor is fun and whimsical. Went for dessert and found out they serve food as well. Our waiter was amazing so I have to say there are no complaints about the customer service. 
Tried the 'Something to talk about' waffle which was huge! You would definitely need to share this one. The hot chocolate could also be a dessert for one. Let's just say we walked out with a nice sugar rush! Lol!"}
{"text":"I went with a group of friends on their soft opening and everything was amazing.  

The interior is super cute!  Everything is sweets related. They had chocolate bar walls, decals of chocolate icing dripping from the ceiling , etc.  They have mostly booths, which I like because it is more comfortable.

Service was great.  The chefs also came by to make sure everything was okay and asked for our feedback.  Waitress was super friendly. 

Menu selection was good.  They have a variety of hot and cold beverages, waffles, crepes, pancakes, cakes, cheesecake and some savoury food (ex. Poutine).

It'd definitely go back soon"}
{"text":"Craving waffles, we came to this restaurant near the airport for dessert. We got the Cookielicious waffle, which was big enough for at least 2 people. There were a lot of dense toppings; brownies, cookie dough, a cookie with molten chocolate in the centre, and ice cream as well! I could not finish more than one quarter of a waffle before I was full. 

The interior of the restaurant is so cute, there are neon signs and cartoon desserts on the walls! There is also a huge overhead light shaped like an upside down cake which I thought was really unique and cute. Also, our waitress was super helpful, walking us through the whole menu and telling us about the most popular dishes. 

Verdict: Definitely will be coming back to try other items. The only downside is the price ($20 for one dessert) -- it might be better to just cut down portions so prices can be reduced."}
{"text":"Honestly, the portions are better in this place of all the dessert places I've been to. They are very generous which is nice considering the price you pay for.

Customer service is excellent, and the place is spacious inside which was surprising. Its definitely good for a big group of people. 

Everything is clean and organized so its a thumbs up for me.

But, there are a few things that my spouse and I noticed that didnt sit well with us so I can only give this place a three star. It was after taste on some of the dessert we got. Which is a shame so we never got to finish it. Unless your sensitive to the taste then you will know what am referring to."}
{"text":"We went to D-Spot recently and I'm glad I did!!. Unfortunately, for me, I over did it!! My bad. Never visit D-Spot when you missed a meal!! Wow, I ordered the butter chicken crepe. It was very filling and had a lot of flavor . Then, I had to order a dessert!! I had the High On Coco!! I really had an over dose of coconut. Loved it! Great place to visit to get over your dessert cravings. Dinner great too!! Staff was so attentive and amazing. Thank you"}
{"text":"Had a WONDERFUL experience at this place ! The decor was super cute, the service was amazing, the staff were very friendly and welcoming, and the dessert was excellent ! 100% going back."}
{"text":"Nice place for dessert. The employees are very kind! I have to say I'm liking D-Spot way more than Demetres in Mississauga. They've really shown great customer service and have given my friends and I an enjoyable experience. The place was nicely decorated inside. Family friendly & lots of space. 

We ordered: 

1. My Crepe Ate Your Brownie: 6/10. Presentation was good. The crepe was great. However, the brownie itself tasted a little burnt. It could have been the recipe itself that we didn't like. Was a good portion, enough for two to share (depending on your hunger level). Wouldn't order again. 

2. Waffle w/ Fruit: 10/10. Presentation was good. The waffle was nice and warm. The fruits were very fresh & there was a good variety. Would definitely order again! 

Overall, I would definitely visit this place again & order different desserts."}
{"text":"I invited a few of our friends to have dessert at D-Spot during their soft opening last night. 

When I first walked in I noticed the cute interior design of the restaurant. Everything is designed to match the dessert theme. I really liked the bright colours and lighting. There was an upside down birthday cake on the ceiling, chocolate bar walls, and dripping chocolate from the ceiling and the store front. The booths are large and spacious which could accommodate the 6 of us. The booths have wall outlets so you can charge your electronic devices.

The service during our stay was friendly and great. Two of the dessert makers/management came by to ask for our feedback. We had nothing to complain about. The waitress was also friendly and knowledgable during our visit.

There are a lot of options to choose from the menu. Me and my fianc√© shared the velvety and happy dessert on a crepe. It was a large portion and was tasty. 

We received a coupon for a free drink with our next dessert purchase. We will be back to try other dessert options again!"}
{"text":"This is my first 1 star review and it pains me, but I couldn't give any more than that.

Honestly, it looks great when you enter, but that's about it. We were seated and waited 15 minutes before the waitress showed up to bring water. Then, she didn't come back for another 20 minutes to take our orders, even though we were ready right away and even closed our menus and put them to the side to demonstrate that. We got the twisted chocolate, hazelnut cheesecake, and cookies and cream cake. With three people at the table, we were just barely able to finish 20% of the drink, which is surprising because it was a pretty small drink. The coffee just tasted off and we didn't like the flavour. The hazelnut cheesecake was chunky, like cottage cheese, and the aftertaste was very off-putting. The cookies and cream cake was dry and bland as well. Both came with vanilla ice cream and honestly, I've never ever had bad vanilla ice cream, so this was definitely a first for me. 

This is the first dessert place where we did not finish or at least pack our cakes to go. We finished about 30% of the hazelnut cake and about 15% of the cookies and cream cake. 

I guess the 1 star is for the interior design and the nice music."}
{"text":"Second visit even better than the first. My husband had the hit d spot waffle again but with mocha almond ice cream. I had the happy and nutty waffle. The peanut butter ice cream was so good! We also tried the poutine - doing the tandoori chicken poutine with both fries and onion rings. Everything was Delicious! You won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite dessert spots. They have a few locations and I frequent the one on the queensway. They have a lot of variety and you can always mix and match. The staff is very friendly and so is the owner. I love that they are open so late on the weekend (until 2am). I love to go for a small dessert after a movie or just like a late night thing if I have guests over. 
The portions are generous for the price you pay, just come with a big appetite. The ambience is lively when there a lot of ppl around, and also otherwise. 
This places always makes me happy, I can visit with my family, friends, and everyone else."}
{"text":"This was a pleasant find for me. They've got an exquisite interior, it almost makes you feel like you've walked into Charlie's Chocolate factory. Aside from the fun interior, they've got a wide range of food items to choose from, everything from savoury to sweet. I got the \"undercover nut\" crepe. It was super sweet but really delicious. Definitely come here if you're really trying to satisfy a sweet tooth. However, I wouldn't recommend their matcha latte, I got it and was extremely disappointed. It's just Vanilla ice cream blended with a bit of matcha powder and topped with whipped cream."}
