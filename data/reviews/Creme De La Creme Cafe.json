{"text":"Cramped, awkard service, dirty, and so-so food that is diner quality but charges restaurant prices."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed, very slow service - the waitress was running around trying to deal with customers while the 20 something waitress was wondering around with a cloth cleaning tables  just seems disorganized very busy but not efficiently run - the food finally did come and it was warm - I guess it had been sitting on the back counter  food was just OK Really think they get extra help and a wireless POS  2 stars"}
{"text":"Great find in the west end! We went there for breakfast and they easily accomodated me by letting me order a sandwich from their lunch menu. The spinach and cheese omelette was good and we ordered a side of pea meal bacon, which was delicious. The service was nice too, quick and pleasant.  We also got to sit outside since they put tables on the sidewalk. Great on a sunny morning."}
{"text":"So there I was, at 11 am on a Sunday morning, standing adjacent to the bathroom in a narrow hallway, behind a long line of other prospective patrons...  A long line means either the restaurant is poor at seating, serving and turning over or the food is just that good.  Happily for creme de la creme, it is the latter.  (A small caveat here - I have a soft spot for family owned restaurants).  Orange juice, tea, medium poached eggs and toast with melty butter & jam is my idea of a good breakfast...add in the hash browns and tomatoes and you've got a fan!  My friend had a bespoke omlette that looks huge, but delicious!  The hustle and bustle, the good-humoured family atmosphere and being served by people who love what they do all added to the ambience...I'd go back for sure...I'll try the eggs benny with salmon next!"}
{"text":"The scrambled eggs were light and fluffy, and the hash brown potatoes were great. The steak? Disgusting! I requested a medium-well steak. The steak seemed to have been boiled- not grilled, as it should have been. It would not have been edible without HP sauce. Never again!"}
{"text":"The food is ok, but mostly mediocre. Owner almost never smiles. The place is often noisy and crammed. So just 3 stars."}
{"text":"Best.Breakfast.In.The.City. Mic drop.   But seriously, a hole in the wall, cafe feel and very cozy. The service could be better but the food makes up for it. There's a couple very friendly servers. If you're into Eggs Benedict, and you should be, this place has the best I've ever had (beating out 5 star Inns in Niagara on the Lake). A must visit. The local shops are also a plus and its not far from blood west village so you can burn those calories off with a walk around the little shops."}
{"text":"Pretty good i used to go here with my family alot when i was younger the portions are nice and the hashbrowns are delicious! Only downside is its really tiny so if you come on a sunday you might not have a table for a while. Really want to try the eggs benny next time i go here!"}
{"text":"The best breakfast ever. Small location but the pancakes were great. Price is good - only draw back is you have to pay for parking."}
{"text":"Love it there especially Saturday morning in the summer time. Quick walk up & there you are seated by a friendly staff.  The place is always buzzing with neighbourhood families enjoying weekend breakfast.    I love their eggs Benedict/best hollandaise sauce.  Awesome hash brown.   Very busy place, understandably you feel rushed at times but most importantly quality of food is always consistent.  Over time you know what you want and menu is not required."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast that is no fuss and delivers good food.  Eggs benny are tasty as is the steak and eggs.  This was actually one of the few places that cooked your steak to what you asked.  I usually ask for it to be medium thinking that it will be overcooked.    I've taken friends and family there and it has always been pleasant.  The restaurant is cozy and the staff are very friendly.  We keep going there everytime we want breakfast because it never dissapoints!"}
{"text":"We moved to Bloor and Islington from Leslieville and were worried that there wouldn't be any good brunch places.  Well, 5 minutes on the Internet turned up this place, and we loved it.  The Eggs Benny came with potato hash, really nicely done peameal bacon, and perfectly poached eggs with a great homemade Hollandaise.  Eggs Florentine were just as good.  Unlike anywhere else I've been, they ask you how you like your poached eggs (soft, medium, hard) - and they actually come the way you ask for it.  I'm a coffee snob: several good restaurants let themselves down by skimping on the brew.  Here it was dark and rich - absolutely perfect.  Service was good compared to the typical Leslieville grumpy wait staff.  Seating was tight indoors and the air was hot and sweaty, but we sat outside in the nice cool Summer breeze.  It probably wouldn't have been so good on a rainy day.  Definitely recommended and I look forward to trying the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"How can you not like this place??  A must have: Pancakes  or Eggs Benidict both equal amazingness  The staff is fantastic Ellen is my favorite she makes me feel like I am going to a realitives home for brunch! I always bring a bunch of people with me, I make it my meeting place of choice, except for on the weekend they get super busy , for good reason.   The pancakes are like crapes almost but bigger and crispier. My main reason for loving this spot so much is because they make there own Hollandaise sauce.... A MUST when searching out great brunch spots. Nothing bothers me more than sauce from powder...ewwww. As mentioned in many other reviews, there hash browns are real Hash browns, none of this deep fried potato fry thing that seems to be so popular, they are as real as they come. In fact you can see into the kitchen when your paying and can almost always see someone grating potatoes !!  Sometimes the service is slow , but thats okay with me because I know what I am getting is made right to order. It is a family run business and the lady that owns it is such a delight!   I really cant say enough great things about this place, you will have to just go try it yourself !"}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant maybe a dozen times over the last decade, most recently last week, and I finally understand why it's so busy: there are literally no other breakfast places on Bloor between Islington and Jane.  The food is \"meh\". The service more miss than hit. Putting maple syrup on bacon doesn't improve so-so bacon. The home fries are dry and lifeless. The sausage is underdone and tasteless.  This area would benefit greatly from another breakfast spot. Unfortunately, until that happens locals will settle for Creme de la Creme. I'll drive to Jane."}
{"text":"Our go to breakfast/brunch place. The ladies working here are always cheerful and not at all in the fake because-I'm-working-for-my-tip kind of way. They are genuinely happy to see you and make you happy! And that is refreshing on a Saturday morning.  Whenever we're here, I always say I will try something else in their menu but always end up getting the smoked salmon eggs benedict. Now, I am by no means a connoisseur but it is divine IMHO. Smoke salmon, eggs benedict, hollandaise sauce, hash brown - how can you go wrong? I love it and never get tired of ordering it.  I also always get their hot chocolate. I don't think it's fall off-your-seat spectacular but it is very good. I am not a coffee person but my partner says it's good (and she's finicky with her coffee).   Service is fast and sincere. Food is good and cheap. Only thing stopping me from giving that 5th star? You always smell like food when you step out lol. Not a big deal except it annoys the person beside you on the TTC."}
{"text":"Basic average run of the mill breakfast place. They keep it clean and delver what they promise.  Nothing special, but nothing bad about it either."}
{"text":"It's a little crowded and the dining space a little awkward but worth enduring for the great food. All dishes are reasonably priced considering the generous helpings of eggs and breakfast potatoes you get. My favorite dish to order is the pancake with fruit. Just the right size and the texture of the pancake is closer to a fluffy crepe. If you are in the area and looking for something a little more elevated than a greasy spoon, pop in at Creme de la Creme."}
{"text":"I would probably love this place if I was in high school and was spending my parents money. Now, I just know better.  Pancake was interesting and huge. Crispy edges. Never have had anything like that before. But it's just a pancake. For a fruit cup ($4.5 - chopped up banana, 4 orange slices, one piece of canned peach),  4 strips of bacon (4$?!), an order of pancakes and French toast...the bill was damn near $40. Huh?  It's really loud and crowded - service was prompt, though. Not sure what all the hoopla about this place is about."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the food but the place is really mismanaged and the wait times are borderline ridiculous. To wait 60+ minutes for a simple breakfast is unacceptable, especially when you have kids with you. When I pointed that out to a waitress she got really defensive and rude... I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Old fashioned Euro-style breakfast. Not quite American - but Americans will love it. Standard sausage, eggs, toast, hash browns perfect for breezy, sunny Toronto day. If you can sit outside, do it. On the weekend traffic noise is minimal. Inside, it can get a little noisy - lots of animated conversation."}
{"text":"Pancakes. Get the pancakes.  ...I didn't get the pancakes. But, I'm getting them next time.  This cozy diner is crazy busy on the weekend. It's a casual spot to grab brunch with outdoor seating in the summer. We wandered in and we didn't have to wait long to be seated.  I ordered the eggs benny which was good. The portions are large and the food came out quickly.  I noticed that most people were ordering pancakes. The pancakes were large and thin... They sort of looked like a cross between a crepe and a pancake... crepecake....  pancrepe....  My friend ordered them and I had order envy! Pancakes, next time."}
{"text":"Located in the Kingsway neighbourbood, I'd heard about this place from a friend and wanted to try it out. We arrived on Sunday for brunch and as expected there was a full house with a bit of a line up. When a place is this packed you know that what's in store is gonna be good.  After a very short wait our trio was seated and handed menus. Then 30 seconds after being handed the menu our server barked at us \"if we were ready to order.\" Did I pass out? Did I miss the customary 5 minute menu review period? Am I on drugs? No. Our server was on high alert and had decided to throw social norms and common courtesy to the wind today, and our table would suffer for it.  We asked her to give us 2 minutes and that was the last we saw of her for nearly 15 minutes! When we were finally able to flag her, she continued her rushed approach to service, barely acknowledging our inquiries or order, just pushing us through the process as opposed to letting us enjoy our brunch experience.   I won't harp on the service much longer but let's just say we received more of the same over the course of our brunch, to the point where we weren't even asked if we wanted more coffee, just poured a full cup as she walked by. When our food finally arrived she handed all plates to the wrong people and just kept saying \"Toast? Toast?Toast?\" Faster and more intense before any of us could respond... I felt stressed out!  To the restaurants credit their food performed MUCH better than their gruff impersonal server. I had the Smoked Salmon Eggs Benny which was light and delightful! Great hollandaise, AMAZING hashed brown potatoes and perfectly cooked eggs. I was thrilled with the meal portion.  Had it not been for the service I would have comfortably awarded this place a 5 star, however, service is part of the experience of dining out, and even a smile or forced small talk might have earned them extra marks. Note to management, make sure your team is as lovely as your food.   I'll be back to re-evaluate at some point, hopefully their food stays the same and the service improves!  Eatcrest Out!"}
{"text":"I'm quite glad to live close to this great little brunch place (though they serve breakfast all day, which is always a gem to find). The servers are super friendly, and the food is both tasty and cheaper than most places. My friend jokes that the menu is pretty standard, but that their \"secret ingredient is love\". It does seem like a nice family run business who take pride in their tasty food, and I'm happy to support that!"}
{"text":"THE WEIRDEST THING HAPPENED while we were eating brunch in here... one of the waitresses TOLD ALL THE GUESTS TO SHUT UP!!   WHAT. THE. F*CK.  If she wanted the place to be quiet then she should have just told all of their paying customers to leave!   Have you ever dined at Creme De La Creme Cafe? IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO AVOID NOISE... the neighbouring tables are practically kissing each other and the restaurant is small that you can practically hear each conversation happening at each table.   I am a restaurant manager, and I can not imagine making an announcement to tell everyone to be quiet. Maybe if there were some drunken fools, I may politely ask that table to settle down. But it is a common fact that when a small restaurant is crowded and each customer is having a  normal conversation then the noise level will more than likely be quite loud.  Creme De La Creme Cafe's one and only guest who wanted peace and quiet should have therefore gone to a fine-dining restaurant instead of a local mom & pop breakfast place! What an idiot! And what a stupid idiot waitress! GAIN SOME COMMON SENSE!  Oh and we never received a set of rye toast. We informed our server she gave us white toast, she said she must've heard us wrong, never gave us our proper order, left it on the bill and we ended paying for something we didn't order and didn't eat."}
{"text":"Every friday my boyfriend and I order take away breakfast and we are always so pleased with the care put into our meals and the preparation gone into it. Never a disappointment."}
{"text":"Cream de la Crap!  What an awful brunch experience. This place is so chaotic. You'd think if you have a busy crowd every Saturday & Sunday you'd adjust to the surroundings however it seemed like the staff was encountering their first rush hour and had no idea what to do besides rush every aspect of the meal. At one point I overheard the waitress tell the couple next to us that if they were finished they had to go. I'm sure the individuals waiting for that table were thankful but I wouldn't appreciate being escorted from my table.   The food was mediocre at best. I had the eggs Benedict that lacked a flavour - it's debatable if that was considered hollandaise sauce and the meat of choice is on the side.   If I continue to rant about my disappointment I fear I'll have the longest post written in regards to this spot so I'll stop.   BUT! In conclusion, what a sad breakfast experience."}
{"text":"BEST BENEDICT EVER   First time here and glad I went in, now they are not trying to re-invent breakfast.  Having said that everything was done with old school care,and the portions are generous for the price. My Benedict was perfectly poached, the pemeal was hot and thick without being dry, and the hash browns were properly cooked not a raw potato in the lot.   I would highly recommend this place to anyone that takes breakfast seriously. In my books home run from start to finish."}
{"text":"Let me get something out of the way right now. This is easily the best breakfast food I've had anywhere in the city. My scrambled eggs were heavenly. My wife claimed her over-easy eggs were cooked perfectly. The shaved hash browns were delicious. For food, this place is 5/5 all day long. Service was great too albeit a bit slow because of heavy volume and not enough servers working."}
{"text":"Good ambience, service works hard to make you feel welcome. Food was good, but wait was too long. We waited an hour for our food. Arrived 11:20am, when resto was very busy."}
{"text":"Worst service ever! Food is horrible. Toast is always cold. Way over priced. There is no air conditioning. The owner makes her waitresses pay for the debit machine out of their tips. Who does that?  You should think twice where to spend your money. There is no music, the only background noise is the people who are dining. Avoid this place at all cost."}
{"text":"This was my second visit to Crème de la Crème; I was actually on my way to another west-end breakfast place which turned out to be closed, so I decided to return here.  The first time I came was this past winter after some ice-skating at nearby Central Arena, and I enjoyed their french toast with fruit.  It was not very busy again, possibly because it was a Monday morning just like my first visit.  The waitress was fast and friendly.  The menu is what you would expect: all-day egg breakfasts, omelettes, waffles and pancakes.  I had the eggs benedict with hash browns, and my coffee was regularly re-filled.  The food was very good; they offer soft-medium-hard for the poached eggs, and ham-bacon-spinach-salmon as toppings (I had the ham), and the hash browns were probably the best I have had recently.  Overall, I was pleased with the food and service, and would definitely return and recommend."}
{"text":"I came here with my dad on father's day and it was so lovely! It was packed at 10am, so we had to wait in a very long line but it only took 15 minutes to go through. I ordered the full order of pancakes which was wayyy too much food! Get the half order. Each pancake is HUGE and thin, crepe like folded on top of itself so you reallly only need one. It comes with fresh fruit and I asked for whipped cream but they forgot to put it on top and when I saw how large the portion was I was really ok with that. My dad got the half order of french toast and he said it was amazinggggg! The service is friendly, the only thing is that it was more expensive than we thought it would be. All in all a really great find!"}
{"text":"I enjoy visiting Creme de la Creme.  Have visited occasionally as this is one of my mom and step-dad's favourite breakfast places.  Six of us went to brunch today for my step-dads birthday and enjoyed the food and experience.  It is busy here so you may have to wait a few minutes for a table. We waited about 5.  Coffee is decent and refilled often.  I opted for smoked salmon accompanied by scrambled egg whites with cheddar cheese and hash browns.  Love that they serve the salmon with a fresh lemon wedge and some capers - yum!  I enjoyed my breakfast - delicious and a huge portion. Have leftovers for tomorrow!  Make sure you try an order of the pancakes - they have crispy edges and are served with some fresh fruit YAY!  Will definitely come back again"}
{"text":"This is the best breakfast in the city. Great food, super nice staff and plenty of (pay) street parking. Highly recommended. Great job guys. Can't wait till we come back Again.  Try their eggs bennies with smoked salmon. Yum. Their house pancakes is the best in the city."}
{"text":"This place is nothing special, except that its one of the only places in the area where you can get breakfast foods in the afternoon on weekdays. The food is unremarkable, the service is unintentional, and the drinks are underwhelming.   I ordered a latte, which is on the menu, and the server brought a coffee. When I gave him a good old Canadian style apology and clarified that I wanted a latte, the server said he wasn't sure if they made those. He returned a bit later with a poorly made latte that was far too hot to touch until almost the end of the meal.    My french toast was bland and had an overly eggy taste.   I wouldn't recommend against going to Creme de la Creme if out of other options, but I certainly don't intend to return."}
{"text":"A nice little space to grab good food. It is quite little so it can get busy. The food is great and if you needed anything, the servers are more than willing to help out! The servers are wonderful, polite, prompt and accurate! Cost wise, it's ok!  We go when we can"}
{"text":"Service is good. Best coffee in Etobicoke. Only thing I dislike is smelling of grease after leaving the place. They need a new kitchen exhaust or something."}
{"text":"ordered the omelet and fruit bowl for breakfast amazing comfort food!! will go back as often as I ll be in the area!  the only downside is this place is very packet, all three times i've been and a little bit expensive. definetely delicious.  Service wise very friendly and definetely food  did come pretty fast everytime considering the place is packed, the average time was around 10 minutes"}
{"text":"I have been coming to this amazing little spot for years and always order the smoked salmon Benedict. The hollandaise sauce here is the best in the city ( and the most butter! Yum). They do their hash browns  as the classic shredded potatoes, they are so tasty. I cannot get enough of this place."}
{"text":"This charming little storefront, with its gold decor and roosters, is just the thing to wake you up in the morning.  The menu is not unusual, but what is on there is excellent.  Omelets come with choice of three fillings from a list (extra for smoked salmon or goat cheese).  I picked spinach, feta and onions and mine was great, as were my partners eggs benedict.  Fresh flavourful hash browns and good coffee.  Very friendly, prompt and considerate service.  What more could one ask for in a breakfast joint?"}
{"text":"Great brunch spot in the west end.  Cheap, good and plenty of food.  The sidewalk patio is a nice touch in the summer."}
{"text":"Came here yesterday morning with my boyfriend. We both got omelettes and they were tasty! The food came fairly quick, the waitress was also quick to refill my glass of water. For just under $10 you get a fair sized omelette which three toppings come included, toast, as well as breakfast hashbrowns. The only downfall is that you have to pay for parking because of it's location"}
{"text":"This place is not what I thought it would be at all.  The food was bland. The customer service was almost non-existent to the point of being bizarre.  I thought I had walked into the twilight zone once we sat down.  The service is slow.....and don't even get me started on ordering their oatmeal.  I tried to order it on a Saturday at 11:15am and the waitress told me no they would not make it.....not that they couldn't, but wouldn't.  I asked why, and was told that after 10am and before 2pm they would not make it b/c they did not have time.  My suggestion is either find the time or take it off your menu.  All and all I think this place should be avoided at all costs."}
{"text":"I've only had breakfast there, but have been there many times alone and with the family. The breakfasts are fresh, plentiful, and delicious, and they have REAL hashbrowns. I always have grated cheddar on them (not on the menu) and they are fantastic.   The only problem I've ever had is when I went with a group of 8, and it really put a wrench in their works... they managed to get our food out at roughly the same time, but you could tell that it put a stress on their system."}
{"text":"Seems like a Ma and Pa owned place, the wait staff were attentive and asked if I wanted coffee immediately. They came out with a fairly Large breakfast plate! The food tasted Yummy and fresh, service was friendly and quick! I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"My go to spot for bf in the bloor & royal york neighbourhood.  Simple but fresh ingredients, great family friendly service, and reasonable pricing make this an ideal everyday breakfast (and lunch) place.  Today i had the smoked salmon bf with eggs, hash, tomatoes and rye toast.  My uncle had a grilled cheese & tomato sandwich with a side of spinach.  Everything was good as per usual.  Perfect portion size, and am back home satisfied.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Did you say All Day breakfast? Okay I'm in!! Breakfast happens to be my favorite meal of the day, and I love it even more if I can have it at any time of the day-- in this case 1pm! It was a weekday and the place wasn't busy, but there were about 3 other occupied tables other than mine. It's a simple, typical diner and I liked it, although generally I just happen to like diners a lot. I got the peameal bacon with sunny-side up eggs, hash browns, and rye toast, and yes brewed coffee which turned out to be unlimited. Hurrah! The peameal bacon was good, the eggs were all right, and the hash browns were fantastic-- to me they were almost like Swiss roesti, lightly browned on each side. I must say it's the best hash browns I've ever had, and a whole lot better than boring home frites. The rye bread was fresh and lightly toasted the way I like it. On the table was a small basket of assorted jam, marmalade, and butter. There was also a slice of orange fruit, which I happily ate after the meal. I wished there was a bit more fruit in there, but I guess for the price of the meal that's fair enough. Well what can I say, Creme De La Creme, you had me at hash browns."}
{"text":"Love this place. The owner is a really nice woman, let my friend and I come in 3 minutes till closing because it was so cold. We really appreciated how accommodating they were. Service is really good as well. Been here many times and it never disappoints. The hollandaise sauce is my favourite in the city!"}
{"text":"I find it difficult to be wowed by bacon and eggs... they both require zero effort and taste pretty much the same everywhere. With that being said the food here was good and the service was excellent.  My hubby and I walked in around noon and the place was pact. We sat in seats near the register and were immediately greeted by the cutest old lady who told us that she could show us more private/romantic seats in the back.  We walked through the front half of the kitchen to a little secluded area all to ourselves (until someone else was seated next to us 15 minutes later).   Portions are huge and with Sean M.'s tip, we ordered hash browns with cheese (not on the menu) and it was THE BOMB!   I should note they don't take debit (cash & credit only)."}
{"text":"I came here 2 days ago for brunch with a old friend of mine, it was his idea so I tried it out.. I was a bit skeptical from the look of it but the breakfast and service made up for it! I had a cappuccino and it was Huge! I like to have  it with cream and sugar and I did. I ordered the smoked salmon eggs benedict and it came with shredded home fries, I liked it a lot but I wish it had more hollandaise sauce on it, I love it with extra sauce. I had the pancakes and fruits for dessert and I love the pancakes! They are almost similar to the way that I make them at home. I wouldn't come out of my way to come here for breakfast, as I had better but I do recommend them. My favorite was the cappuccino!"}
{"text":"Super squishy! I came here with my boyfriend and his dad. I guess it's what you expect from a traditional looking European brunch restaurant? The servers are nice and friendly. The food was only OK. The hollandaise sauce on the eggs Benedict was ok because it had an off mayo taste to it. The spinache was decent. But the hash browns were off putting. They were tasteless and I suppose the way they do it is mashed up/ scrambled.  Overall I felt kinda sick being forced to eat it."}
{"text":"Well the food and presentation was good. It qas a pleasure to sit outside. I also liked that they offer the opportunity to purchase the breakfast without meat (more places need to offer this)."}
{"text":"My Fiancee, a mutual friend and I had breakfast here on Sunday just after noon. It's normal to show up to a full house but keep in mind it will be well worth the wait. I had an Omelette with Spinach, Mushrooms, Goat Cheese and Bacon with hash browns and Rye toast. It was perfect! My friend went with a 1/2 order of pancakes - this was more like a crepe, but tasty as hell. We were happy with the service (kind of reminded me of a Simpson waitress because of the accent and demeanor but still very good). This is now added to my list of go-to brekky joints 1000%"}
{"text":"They have cockroaches.... Never again.   The food is extremely greasy, basically dripping in oil. I had smoked salmon Benedict and the salmon looked darker than it usually is at other places. It had a grey tone to it. The Hash browns were plain, and had no flavour and 0 enjoyment.   We came in at about 10 30am and by 12 the place was full of people. I have no idea how.. The waiters were super nice but I asked for peanut butter 3 times and asked to get my water refilled twice and didn't receive it. I just didn't bother saying anything anymore.   The place itself as a whole, was chaos. They are super unorganized and their operations need to update a little. Its super plain inside and not the most attractive interior. All walls were yellow, there were 5 giant picture frames, or so it looked like it, and they were all emply.   THE BEST PART ABOUT IT is that in order to pay you had to go up to the front and wait in line. There were 5 people in front of us and we had to wait for a total of 15 min until we were out of there. I'd assume since there is such high traffic, the restaurant can afford wireless debit machines? One gentleman in line was holding up the line up because he had an issue with something.   To top it off with a cherry, while we were waiting in line to pay, a cockroach was casually climbing down the wall which I was leaning up against... A COCKROACH! I can only imagine what their kitchen looks like... I was either going to squish that thing and get its remains all over my clothes, or it would fall into my bag (which i immediately noticed was open), and I would bring it home with me and... well anyways. Never again."}
{"text":"What can I say that hasn't already been said?   Delicious, MASSIVE portions, and cheaper than most brunch spots east of Runnymede Station.   Vera is the shit, she's a sprightly middle aged Russian (edited!) waitress who knows me by face after only a handful of visits and says 'Da?' after most statments. She's direct, friendly, and good-humored.   What makes it worth the ride to Royal York Station?  2 Words: Eggs M*@&#^@#in' Benny!!"}
{"text":"Slightly slow, but very friendly service. It was super busy when we were there though.  Food is great. Pancakes are monstrous and our server was good enough to put our shared pancake order in after we were nearly finished our eggs and stuff.   Just wish they had an eggs and pancakes meal. Oh, and you'll probably smell like breakfast after eating here."}
{"text":"Love Crème! My husband and I have been going for years. They serve the best when it comes to breakfast and lunches. My favourite is their pancakes; thin and absolutely delicious. And their hash browns - Yum! No one else makes them like Crème and they taste terrific. They are a little overpriced but when you compare them to other breakfast establishments, they're worth the price. My one complaint, the level of noise when the place is even half-full; the noise is bouncing off the walls. Go before church lets out to beat the crowds."}
