{"text":"Exquisite Thai food, this was our first time here and will definitely be back. The service was excellent and the meal was quick and delicious. Excited to try more of the menu items in the future."}
{"text":"We ordered a dinner for 3 take out from the Thai Charm Eatery for the very first time as we thought it would be nice to try something different, it really wasn't. To start with, we drove across Airdrie to pick up our order and once we got home discovered everything was incorrect. As we all know people make mistakes and it wouldn't normally be a big deal but when we returned to have our order corrected, the lady working there proceeded to tell us that the mistake was ours and she gave us exactly what we ordered (dinner for 2). After all that we had to wait for them to make our correct order and they didn't even bother to apologize for the mix up as it couldn't have been their mistake.  As far as the food is concerned, it was ok for the most part but I have definitely had better Thai food and for much cheaper then the $85 plus tax that we paid for this run around. Needless to say I don't think I will be back here again and probably won't recommend it to anyone else."}
{"text":"When we go to Thai Charm we always receive the best service.  Their Pad Thai, Druken Noodles and shrimp salad rolls are amazing.  It's nice that you can control how spicy you want your dish to be.  This is great for me as I am the biggest baby when I comes to spicy food.   The wait is never long when waiting for a table or your food.  Our server is always very prompt and efficient when it comes to getting us more drinks or clearing our table."}
{"text":"Thai Charm is a great new Thai restaurant in Airdrie. I have eaten there a couple of times, and have also ordered take out to bring home.  Being new, it's not usually that busy. Service has always been excellent, and the food is classic Thai.  The green curry is very flavorful and aromatic with lots of meat and vegetables. The coconut rice has just the right amount of coconut flavor. Salad rolls are full of lettuce and different herbs, making them different from usual salad rolls.   Only food that I've ever been less than impressed with was the Tom Kha soup, and only because there was a large amount of broth and hardly any meat or veggies inside.   Owner is very friendly. A nice change to the food scene in Airdrie."}
{"text":"I am basing my review on more the service and atmosphere than food quality... Only one Thai staff member, and the food is kind of Americanized for those who have spent a lot of time eating street food in thailand, but it IS good and the service is amazing. Super friendly, and very accommodating for both food and friendly and beautiful presentation! I will keep coming back. Only Thai food in airdrie, btw."}
{"text":"Stoped in on the way back to Edmonton from Canmore. Quick, friendly service and a good buffet selection. This is now going to be a new traditional stopping place."}
{"text":"Order the drunken noodle lunch special and there wasn't much special about it. The portion was small and there was lots of stringy chicken fat three out the dish. For that price and I'm still hungry."}
{"text":"I was neither impressed nor unhappy... It was totally middle of the road. I had Tom Kha soup, he had Chicken Panang, and neither was especially good. Or bad. The service and speed were absolutely top notch, though."}
{"text":"I ordered yellow curry with beef. The menu says it comes with mixed veggies and potatoes. I had 2 pieces and hubby had 1 piece. The amount of Onion was about 10 times of the potatoes. The beef was ok, not a lot, more than 3 pieces. The sauce was very very watery and Lack of flavor. The dish was $16, very over priced for under cooked veggies swim in watery sauce that does not have flavor. I'd try something else but not the yellow curry again. Btw, this was a take out order."}
{"text":"New owners are Oriental .. I asked if the cook was the same and the food is the same she lied and said yes .... food is gross now"}
{"text":"Excellent service, delicious food, & generous portions!  We ordered 4 different entrees to share between 6 people and still had leftovers to bring home. Everything tasted great. I am not big on seafood, but even the fish was amazing."}
{"text":"We ordered take out from Thai Charm tonight and it was good! We got an assortment of pad Thai and a couple different curries. Everything was really tasty.   Tip: the curries did not come with rice, so if you want rice with your curry be sure to order! Overall, this is a good option if your wanting Thai on the north side and don't want to drive all the way into town!"}
{"text":"Worst Thai food I've ever had.. Got take out, the pad thai and the red curry.. Brought it home to find out I paid 40 dollars for noodles (absolutely no veggies and barely any chicken in the pad thai) and cold rice.. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Great for take-out.  I have an allergy to peanut and they are really good about making me dishes without.  They food is pretty decent and the prices are good.  It hits the spot when we are craving Chinese/thai.  My kids love the noodles."}
{"text":"We ordered take out for our first time eating here. The wait time was a bit long but I won't complain for freshly cooked food. Got it home and it was amazing! Best Chinese food that I've had in the Calgary/Airdrie area. Will definitely be returning."}
