{"text":"I have gone to this restaurant many times before and I usually order vermicelli or pad Thai and both dishes are phenomenal."}
{"text":"FOOD: a good selection of thai/viet food. Huge quantities! I always have enough for dinner and lunch the next day. Even their \"small\" soup comes in this giant bowl and is enough for 3 people.

SERVICE: great servers! you can tell that the owners really care. They chat with you and are extremely friendly - also makes good food suggestions.

COST: Competitive pricing. About $10 to $15 for a main dish. 

OVERALL: From the outside, it looks more like a diner than a viet restaurant, but it's got good food and pleasant service, so definitely worth a try. There's also lots of free parking in the lot. It's located near Dixie mall and is a good alternative to the mall food court."}
{"text":"This is without question the BEST Vietnamese restaurant in Toronto.  My family has been eating here every week for the last year and my dad has their Pho soup every day.   They have a large assortment of dishes but I highly recommend the lemongrass chicken.  They also serve bubble tea but it does take them a long time to make.  However I've been told good bubble tea can't be rushed.  Great prices and the restaurant is easy to get to from Lakeshore and the end of Dixie."}
{"text":"Service is friendly (if a little leisurely at times), the food is good, the prices are reasonable. There's a reason Lotus Island is the ONLY place still in business in that little plaza...here's hoping it stays, because it's my go-to local spot for pho!"}
{"text":"Lotus Island is a gem. Try the Pad Thai and the mango salad. I'm picky about both and they are excellent. Servings are generous, especially the pho, and prices very reasonable. Staff is friendly and it's fast. There's lots of parking and its wheelchair accessible with the bathroom on the main level. We went with grandparents and teenagers with food specifications and they were able to accommodate everyone (no soy, vegetarians, no dairy) since they cook from scratch. This is our go-to place on the cheap and cheerful side."}
{"text":"I am blessed to live in a country where I can stop in here anytime I would like for treats and treasures and conversation with the nice lady who hands me my ginger-ales. I cannot say enough about her and her snacks! try the veggie pho, pho realz!"}
{"text":"Why doesn't YELP allow you to put NO STARS?!?! I don't have anything really good to say about this place, and I have to give it a 1 star???

I have been here several times before and I usually had good experiences. However tonight I had the worst experience I have ever had at a Vietnamese restaurant. This is BY FAR the WORST Vietnamese restaurant I've been to. Tonight I ordered a Well Done Flank Beef Rice Noodle Soup, P7 to be exact. I've attached a picture of what they call flank- mind you, I've always ordered flank beef soup before and I've never had so much fat or tendons in my pho before in my life. I barely received any beef in my bowl to begin with. From what beef I had, I'd say a good 90% of my meat looked like my picture. Oh, and by the way, that picture is of some fat I took out, AFTER I had just given a bowlful of fat to the manager/kitchen staff to look at when I complained to the waitress! Anyway they tried to say \"oh you ordered P10 (or something, that has tendons)\". I said, \"no, I ordered P7\", which we all verified as per our written order. Then they tried to say that, \"Oh, you know, our flank and tendons get mixed up together sometimes because we cook them together\". Of course I retorted, \"If I wanted tendons or whatever else I would've ordered it!\" Needless to say, I told them I can get better beef at McDonalds. Hands down! They apologize, and I was already so hungry before I got there, so I just kept taking out the fat and tried to finish my soup. This actually gets worse! As I near the end of my soup, I bite on something weird...wiry! I spit it out and it's a piece of metal from a metal scouring pad!!! (I took a picture of this too!) SOOOOOO DISGUSTED by this restaurant and their service at the point! My boyfriend had already walked out before the bill came, because the manager apologized and said he'd take care of it. So he only takes off just the one item of soup from the bill. I call my boyfriend back in, because I am NOT paying for anything at this point. Anyway, after speaking with the manager for 15 minutes he says that bits of scouring pads in their food are out of his control (WTH???). My boyfriend ended up paying for the rest of the bill, but in my experience with other restaurant establishments, our meal for the table should have been free. DO NOT EAT HERE!! Unless you don't mind lack of hygiene, quality, and customer service!"}
{"text":"The food was great and the portions generous. I was amazed at the price.I am so happy they finally got a liquor licence."}
{"text":"Best pho and vermicelli in the area! Ive been coming here for 2 months now and its never disappointed. 

Service is always great. Love this place."}
{"text":"Pho was good. Soup base was clear and tasty. Old style beef ball taste. Will come back again. 

Do not order the chicken satay. Just a chicken breast white meat on a stick and the sauce was nothing special."}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem in Etobicoke/East Mississauga. The mango salad is the best I've found anywhere and the chow mein noodles are so full of flavour. It's great for take out or eating in. It's not a fancy restaurant but perfect for a quick meal out. Great pricing and the staff are very friendly and smiling. Always nice people. Fast and I completely recommend them to anyone."}
{"text":"We live down the street from this place! Melissa is super nice and very welcoming. always come here when we're in a rush and want something yummy to eat!"}
{"text":"This one of the best Vietnamese restaurant I ever ate in Etobicoke and don't judge of dampy/dark look of its appearance.

My girlfriend had order pho medium size and I got the satay beef bowl. It was tasty and lots of flavour into the soup. I have been to other Vietnamese restaurant in Etobicoke but its not as good as this local location. Most Vietnamese taste like there msg in after you eat it feel like you need to drink a lot of water.

I highly recommended you guys to get typical Vietnamese dishes but its they also cook other type of Thai and Chinese food as well. For sure I will come back to eat this amazing pho!"}
{"text":"Amazing!  
Delicious vermicelli, calamari is so tasty! 
Lady who is always there is super nice and helpful. 
Doesn't matter if you dine in or out - you will not be disappointed. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"If you're not in the habit of rolling the dice on places like this (those that have good ratings but fewer reviews) I suggest you take the chance every now and then - the results may totally surprise you.

Lotus Island is located just over the border of Etobicoke and Mississauga on the north side of Lakeshore Road East. To look at the business and it's faded signage, paired with the perceived age of the plaza, it's nothing special. But don't let that dusty old book cover turn you off, it's a shiny gem on the inside.

We went off peak hours so there was almost no one aside from staff inside, and much like the dated/aged exterior the design of the interior was equally dated. Again, as I've said before, these simple backdrops make for the person platform to allow the food to shine.

To start we got a mango salad and the fresh rolls. The mangos were not overly sweet which was fantastic and unlike many other mango salads I've had the mangos were perfectly ripened (not too hard and not mushy). The fresh rolls were pretty good, not anything out of the ballpark but definitely tasty when dipped into the satay style peanut sauce.

For my main I (of course) had the house special Pho which came with tendon, beef balls, rare beef, well-done beef brisket and tripe. I was hungry and when I saw that the large was only $9.50 I went all in. The bowl that emerged was massive! The broth was clean, and flavourful with no excess oil AND the rare beef was actually rare when it was added, likely the most rare I've ever had - I loved this since that meant that it would remain less cooked for longer.

Overall the experience was delicious, amazing and extremely affordable. Don't let the aesthetic or few reviews fool you, Lotus Island is an oasis of amazing eats amidst many suburban strip malls!

{"text":"I came here on the recommendation of a friend.  I've gone to my fair share of pho places and I'm very picky about it.   

Service: Very friendly and nice.  

Atmosphere: While all the tables and floors were clean, it was a bit dingy and beat up.  They were wooden tables with lots of scratches in them. In additon, the menus look worn out.  

Food: I ordered the vegetarian pho (off the menu).  I appreciate the fact that they were able to give me pho with just vegetarian broth and vegetables.  It was a very generous size, but I felt the ratio of noodles to vegetables wasn't right.  There were way too many noodles and not enough vegetables.  And while the broth tasted decent, it was a bit too salty for my liking. Now in all fairness, when I cook, I rarely ever use any salt, so I'm quite particular when it comes to saltiness.

Verdict: I'd come back if I was in the area, but since I live in central Mississauga, there are plenty of other good places."}
{"text":"This place is great for Pho in the South-West Etobicoke area. There aren't too many oriental restaurants that stand out but this one is a gem. 

It's run by a really nice lady and her chef. They're so sweet and always make sure you are taken care of.

Pho broth and portions are great. Shrimp wraps are nice and full. Price is fair.

Love coming here when we're near the Kipling/ Lakeshore area."}
{"text":"We did takeout from Lotus Garden - Veggie Pho with Veggie Broth (had a craving, and did not want to make a run downtown to Ossington).

Pro: Huge Portion size, lots of noodles.
Cons: not enough broth, and not a lot of veggies.

The next time I order - will ask them to fix this up.  
Will I go back - HELL YA!!"}
{"text":"Maybe the best in Mississauga.  Good prices, quick.  Could use a little Reno.  Most importantly, great pho."}
{"text":"This is a great little place. Food is delicious and the service is great. The main server remembered me and my wife on only our second visit. We have mainly eaten pho so I can't comment on the larger dishes. Very impressive and quite inexpensive.
Great selection of pho and other Vietnamese dishes.  Extremely friendly staff and never really too busy, quick too. 
I hope this place doesn't get caught up in all the development going on in this area!"}
{"text":"Nice location and great service. The pho didn't really stand out to me though. It was simply average in quality."}
{"text":"Drove past this place for years and always meant to try it. I finally went and tried my usual combination to test the waters. 
They offer true vietnamese style spring rolls which differ from the typical style most Thai/Chinese places carry (which also means they're made in-house and not frozen). They tend to have a crispier coating and a yellow tinge to them on the outside. They were excellent in my opinion. 
Their fresh rolls, (I ordered the pork summer rolls) were the best I've ever tried. The attention to detail, with the fresh herbs inside and the flavour profile of the pork made for a delicious combination. 
Lastly, a generous serving of pork vermicelli was absolutely to die for. I haven't eaten all day and I still couldn't eat it all or pass up taking the rest home. The vermicelli noodles they use are finer than most places I've been to and I must say I'm a huge advocate of that, as thinner noodles allow for less starch and more flavour of whatever you incorporate into your bite. The pork itself was marinated beautifully, then cooked with a nice sear to lock in the flavour and juices. I also got to try the beef, which was nicely seared and had a sweet undertone to it almost reminding me of a Korean short rib marinade I sometimes make. 
All in all, I thoroughly enjoyed my meal and the service was above and beyond what I'm used to in this type of setting. I will definitely be going back in the near future as the value, taste and service made this a standout experience."}
{"text":"I'll admit it - I'm a regular.  Ever since my trip to Vietnam in 2013, I have a craving for pho every week or two.  Not surprising considering that I ate it every day (often for breakfast) in Vietnam.

The pho here is delicious and I'll admit I don't often order other items.   I have on occasion ordered the Hanoi style Bun cha which is wonderful and truly a street food that I remember from Hanoi.

The owner is lovely and I think remembers every single client who has passed through her door, what your favourites are, the ages of your children, one of the most personable people I've ever met in the hospitality industry be it a pho restaurant or staff in the O & B empire.  

Always a great, satisfying meal and always reasonably priced.   If they were just a touch closer to my home I'd probably be eating there 3x a week."}
{"text":"Delicious food, good service, fair prices. Soup servings are huge, rice and stir fry are moderately sized. Milk shakes are actually smoothies, but so very delicious."}
