{"text":"A true big city deli- huge sandwiches and endless combinations. Even the servers seemed \"New York\" (one of them was definitely packing a gun?). They have several flavorful vegetarian sandwiches as well as the standard meat offerings! 

The atmosphere was also fun- lawyers, cops, fire fighters, and citizens on jury duty!"}
{"text":"The Hero Factory

 

Big-ass (can I use \"big-ass' as an adjective?) hoagies the way it's done in New York.

This place packs the meat in their hoagies, and I mean pack. In my book, they don't gyp you. They use Boar's Head meats, which is prime in the deli world, and they pack the other good stuff into their sandwiches, too, like tomatoes, peppers, whatever! Of course, it is a little pricier than your typical Subway, but c'mon...the meats, the bread, the accoutrements are waaay better. This new place, located smack downtown, is a hit among the big names in the Phoenix scene (politicians and high-powered City and State officials). You never know who you're going to run into.

 

Owners Nicole and Jay (who moved to Phoenix from, yes, New York), run the counter themselves, and let me tell you, they are characters. They will throw the f-bomb once in a while, but not in an offensive way. They do it in the most endearing New Yorker way. 

 

I highly recommend this new deli joint. Buy one of their hoagies and you get two lunches out of it. And BTW, they do a \"Hungryman Breakfast sandwich\" and it is a cardiologist's nightmare, but a meat and breakfast lover's dream come true. This breakfast hoagie has breakfast potatoes, bacon, sausage, scrambled eggs, and topped with American cheese for good measure. If you get one of these breakfast beauties, you might want to share with a friend...preferably a carnivore friend. 

 

So check it out, will ya?"}
{"text":"Came in twice in two days while in town for a conference. Nicole, the owner, was friendly and remembered our orders from the day before. Sandwiches were wonderful."}
{"text":"After reading all the glowing reviews on this place I felt compelled to write about my experience.

My first time there I came in with coworkers.  I had ordered before all of them but was the only one still waiting for my sandwich.  I asked the cashier how much longer and then suddenly the woman preparing them went off on me (the one with the pistol on her side)...the cashier was just silent.  When the woman preparing the food finally gave me my sandwich I swear she called me a name.  

Some time after my coworkers wanted to go back there.  I had hoped such an employee with a bad attitude like that would have been let go by then so I went back.  Nope, she was still there (another yelp review says she is the owner, I'm not sure if this is true or not) and very passive aggressive with me.  It put a very bad taste in my mouth.

One of the yelp reviews said this place is closed now.  I hope so.  

There seems to be so much hatred and anger in Phoenix especially downtown.  I hope the city will start to change and people will learn to let go of such bad emotions."}
{"text":"I made a special trip to try out this place.  In fact I decided to try out the light rail on the same day and road it from Mesa to downtown Phoenix specifically to eat at the Hero Factory.  I loved it.   When you've got great bread and Boar's Head brand meat you can never go wrong.  Luckily I had a long ride back to Mesa on the Rail so I could wallow in my gluttony after a foot long, side salad, large cookie and a large soda.  I was comfortably miserable.  Best sandwich I've had in this town so far."}
{"text":"This place is gooood! I had the New Yorker with turkey and pastrami and my friend had the Factory Special, an Italian sandwich. We were both very pleased. The sesame bread is amazing and so are the meats. One of the best sandwich spots in town. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I ordered the Manhattan, here's what i think:

Concrete jungle where dreams are made of
There's nothing you can't do
Now you're in New York
These streets will make you feel brand new
Big lights will inspire you
Hear it for New York, New York, New York!"}
{"text":"I work downtown and I try to get into The Hero Factory at least once a month.  Huge portion sizes for what you pay, great customer service and very speedy.  I usually get the Godfather and I'll eat half of it for lunch and the other half for dinner.  They've won best restaurant 3 years running for a reason."}
{"text":"I see there hasn't been a review in 2009. So let's get started. I don't know why I don't eat here more often. It's not all that far from my office. The talk about the bread is all true. Phenomenal taste and texture. I had the turkey and swiss. Pretty tame. However the Boars Head turkey thinly sliced is to die for. The only other great sandwich in the dowtown area is at Calabria's on Roosevelt. Both places do remind me of back East in NY.  Any sandwich you get at either place is big enough for two, or for both lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"We have eaten here twice and both times the sandwiches were great. The bitchwich is the favorite in our office. Only issue we had was delivery. They took our order and scheduled delivery and then called and told us their service would deliver to us.  When we went to pickup our order, they gave us free chips for our trouble.  Will definitely return."}
{"text":"I met another LI friend here for lunch today. I had the Godfather and it was so good. Good quality cold cuts (I am very picky) with lettuce, tomato, onions & dressing \"Just like home on LI\". I also ordered a Factory Special for my husband and he loved it! My friend ordered the Manhattan along with sides of potato & macaroni salads. The salads tasted just like the delis we miss so much. All around a great downtown place to grab a hero. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The Hero Factory is one of my favorite lunch spots in downtown Phoenix.  The sandwiches are generous to say the least, especially at the $7.95 price point.  Jay and Nicole are always friendly and know me by name, a testament to their service skills.

My favorites include anything with a chicken cutlet and how could I not mention Jay's homemade meatballs.  The roles are nice and soft and when toasted offer a nice crunch to accompany any of the tasty fillings.  Another suggestion is the chicken salad wrap with bacon.  Yum!  

I used to visit quite often, even for breakfast where Nicole would always make me a turkey wrap, a little oddity for breakfast foods.  

Overall the Hero Factory is a great place for lunch and totally outshines most of the mediocre downtown lunch spots.  If you haven't stopped in do so."}
{"text":"I wanted a sandwich. I was going to hit up a chain, but decided that, for the money, I could do better with a local place. I looked around online for the best sandwiches in the downtown area and kept seeing Hero Factory come up. I decided to give it a try.

The place was nothing special. The establishment itself was overcrowded with chairs to the point where you had to bump into people already seated in order to find a table. The staff was rude and inattentive. I wasn't loving it.

But it was the sandwich that made things worse. I got the vegetarian hero. It was so bland and boring. Subway is better. Veggie sandwiches can be awesome. There's no reason for me to pay money for flavorless blah. The bread tasted old and came out of a plastic bag. If this is the New York experience, New York can keep it."}
{"text":"Food is great, service is fast. Only complaint is how busy it gets because so many people love it! The breakfast burritos are a less known specialty that I love."}
{"text":"Massive sandwiches for reasonable prices! This place is very nice for lunch, the sandwiches are so big I sometimes take half home. The place is nice and bright, and never too loud. Definitely one of my favorite places downtown so far, when I have room for it.

The only thing as others have mentioned is that they have a surcharge if your order is under $5. Doesn't really matter as that's quite rare unless you go for breakfast, which is only $2.25 or so. Sandwiches are $8.50 or so. But they're big and use high quality meat."}
{"text":"Great NY hero's. The staff is friendly and very quick. I have been there three times in the last week."}
{"text":"Great breakfast and lunch spot! Its open on Saturdays now and later during the weekdays which is great cause I always need a great breakfast spot close by. Nicole the owner, is amazing and will let you customize anything off the menu. Stop by and help support a local business they are about to start their 7th year!"}
{"text":"This factory is no hero to this Yelper.

I was craving a sub, so I gave this place a chance.  I immediately went for the Italian sausage parmigiana. The good news was it was fast, but the good news ended there.

First the rolls are very narrow and completely covered with sesame seeds, which was then covered with cheese and MICROWAVED!!! rendering the roll tough and chewy.  Then there was the total absence of any tomato sauce at all, which is implied by the term parmigiana!  The \"Italian sausage\" was also very bland and lacked any character at all."}
{"text":"A few co-workers and I were in town for a conference and decided to check out this place on a Tuesday for lunch.  Service was fast and the sandwiches were good.  The bread was fresh...I would suggest splitting because a whole sandwich is just too much for a regular appetite."}
{"text":"Ate there based on the Yelp recommendation.  Sandwiches were large using Boar's Head meats.  Good service friendly staff.  I gave them three stars because the sandwich just wasn't up to my expectations of a NY style deli e.g. a sandwich piled high with hot corned beef (compared to the Carnegie Deli).  The sandwiches are good just not great."}
{"text":"This definitely IS the place to get your hoagies from!! On their website it states, \"What is a hero?\" You might ask yourself. Well, come try one. It's what others call a sub, hoagie or grinder, ONLY BETTER. What some call a sandwich, we call a snack. What other places call double, we call regular. We definitely don't skimp.\" Yeah, they definitely don't skimp on ANYTHING!! 

The quality of their bread and meats (Boar's Head), dressing, and customer service is spectacular. Ah yes, their customer service... You will definitely get that East Coast vibe- be a part of the family- yet don't feel offended if you hear a cuss word or five- and better know what you are going to be ordering cause this place is not for the indecisive. 

I haven't tried many Heros because I usually stick to my favorite one of all, a Po' Boy Special (ham, salami, bologna and American cheese with lettuce, tomato, onion and your choice of dressing). It costs $7.95, which is extremely cheap (not saying that you should be raising your prices but I would still be getting my Heros on even if you did) for the quality AND the quantity. 

The only downfall to Hero's Factory is that they are only open from 6 AM - 3 PM Monday to Friday, so I am not able to go there as often as I would like to. However, my husband does work downtown (night shift) and is able to bring me some before he heads home. 

To Nicole and Jay, and to the rest of the team, thank you for all of the Heros. :) 

P.S. Hero's Factory has made my Best of the Best ONLY list, of course."}
{"text":"This is the place for the best sandwich in town. Nicole, Eddie, Rick and Bob are the best. You can't go wrong with the New Yorker."}
{"text":"Nice little spot. Kinda pricey, but the staff and owner are cool people. 

This place makes sandwiches and sandwich wraps and soups for the most part and they are offering breakfast now as well. 

The customer service is good, you will be recognized acknowledged upon entering, ordering and exiting the joint. The sandwiches are really good and the soups are marginal in taste at best to me. 

The tables and chairs had crumbs from previous patroons and that was a low point for me but hey it is what it is I guess.
Expect to be out of 12 bucks for a sandwich, chips and soda. 

Parking won't happen unless you're willing to walk or pay to enter a parking garage. So take the light rail if you can. 

Nice different choice for this area of downtown Phoenix."}
{"text":"This place just plain rocks.  I grew up on Uncle Sam's in North Phoenix, and after moving downtown, I struggled to find a good, giant, hero.  I'm sure some yelpers could lead me in the right direction, but up until now I haven't been able to find a giant sandwich DTown.  Well, I've found it. The Hero Factory is a place for huge sandwiches. And firearms. Yes, the proprietor is a hot chick with a sidearm. The service is awesome. We came in close to closing (fyi, they aren't open weekends, and close at 3 on weekdays) and asked if they had tables outside.  The proprietor told me she would put one out for us.  This place was ready to shut down, but she offered to take a table outside so we could enjoy the weather.  Big menu, awesome service, HUGE SANDWICHES, very reasonable prices and great food.  If you get a chance, try this place./Art"}
{"text":"Since moving back to Arizona, I've struggled to find a great Italian sub.  Why are there so many bad sandwiches here?  I just don't get it.  Luckily, The Hero Factory's \"Factory Special\" sandwich fills the void.  The portion is large, the meats are quality, and the seasoning really hits the mark.  Thank you, Hero Factory!"}
{"text":"Okay so I work downtown and have ventured to most of the places to eat in the area at least once and I noticed for some reason I had not ever been to this place. So as I walk closer I notice there is a line right up to the door of office workers which is telling me this place must be pretty good if this many office workers are waiting in line. I step in and I'm instantly hit with the smell of a real deli. The menu was filled with tasty sounding items that made me change my mind several times while waiting until I came across a little sign about a new sandwich called Nicole's Bitch-wich ( Cajun Chicken, Chipolte Ranch, Pepper Jack Cheese with all the fixings) and that won me over on sandwich choice. For as busy as the place was it was pretty fast and it was nice to see them really making a sandwich even cutting the meat freshly for each sandwich. The staff was very friendly and even broke an extra $20 I needed broken without any trouble. The woman who turned out to be the owner add's to the place with a lively NY personality with a little AZ flair carrying a firearm. I suppose it doesn't hurt that she is cute too. Any case back to the food... so I get this huge hero wrapped in classic butcher paper and it is just plain awesome. As someone else mentioned on here that this place makes a sandwich which I think beats the famous downtown deli's sandwiches and it seems to beat them price wise.  Price wise for what you get this by far blows away the chain shops like Paradise and the thought of even considering going to a subway when this place is near by is a sin. Five stars as far as sub and hero places go."}
{"text":"I really like this place... 
Taking the advice of Yelp we stopped in on our way through downtown. 
We were immediately greeted as we walked in. I told the staff it was our first time in and asked which sandwich was the best. 
Following the recommendation I ordered the Crackerjack, cracked pepper turkey and melted pepper jack cheese with lettuce, tomato, onion and Russian dressing. We also ordered the Godfather, cappicola, salami, pepperoni and melted mozzarella on garlic toasted bread. 
Let's take a moment and show the bread some much deserved love. It tastes fresh with a chewy center and crisp exterior covered in sesame seeds. You could put a shoe on this bread and it would taste great. 
I really enjoyed the Crackerjack. The Godfather was good for a few bites, but too rich for me. 

I can't wait to come back... 
Great choice for lunch downtown for a very fair price. 

Unless you are completely starving, share a sandwich!"}
{"text":"I think I'm going to cry. After over TEN YEARS of suffering through Arizona style sandwiches... Long Island is finally in the house! 

The first thing I saw when I walked in was the potato salad... and I knew I was home. Long Island delis have a certain way of making potato salad that I've never found anywhere else in the world. So when I saw The Hero Factory's deli case my heart started to race a little. I prayed to God that his would be the real deal. By the power of Huntington please be an authentic LI deli run by real New Yorkers.

And it is!!!

Ever since I moved here from New York I've been craving a real deli sandwich. That means tons of boarshead meat on a real roll (kaiser or hero) with dressing and shredded lettuce. Chicken parm, turkey and cheese, roast beef with mustard - it doesn't matter just make it taste like home. Thankfully everything I ate at The Hero Factory tasted exactly like home. 

Even if you are not from NY, you must give this place a try. They make the best heros in the Valley - hands down. You will fall in love.

The owners did a really great job of maintaining authenticity. Their accents, personality and friendly, familiar way of talking to the customers is refreshing and so very NY. 

I actually feel like something good happened to me today because I discovered this place. I'll be back whenever I have a craving for good food or for home."}
{"text":"Coming from the east coast it's hard to find a good sub in AZ. This place almost has it right on! My only qualms were with the price and the sesame seed roll as the bread. A choice of bread would have been preferred. $9 for a turkey and provolone though? A little steep in my opinion but it is downtown Phoenix. Good place for a sub fix every once in awhile for sure."}
{"text":"This place was amazing. I'm from Columbus and wanted something in Phoenix that was out of my normal realm of eating. It was so unique, the service was phenomenal and I was so impressed to see the owner up front making my food. You can tell she genuinely values her customers and wants to ensure the satisfaction of her customers. It was ridiculously delicious and the quality of the food is amazing. I definitely recommend. Love it!"}
{"text":"This place gets packed for lunch, and rightfully so.  Delicious sandwiches that are absolutely huge.  Can easily be shared with two people.  I think I got the Rachel, which is pastrami with thousand island dressing and coleslaw (I think).  Anyway, it was huge.  I ate half of it and it was plenty for me.  

Make sure to come early or have some time because the lines get a little long."}
{"text":"The Hero Factory is 2 minutes from my office, good for my foodie obsession, bad for my waisteline.  This place has absolutely one of the biggest heros I've had.  $10 will get you a hero and a drink.  A little pricey but I can never eat the whole thing and that means lunch the next day too."}
{"text":"I came here today with a few coworkers for lunch and enjoyed it quite a bit. Now, I'm not much of a sandwich person myself, but even so I was diggin' it. The people behind the counter were definitely New Yorkers, and I got a huge kick out of their accents. They were friendly and efficient, and we got in and out of there pretty fast, despite the line.

I ordered the Barbeque Ranch Wrap, no lettuce, no tomato, with a wheat tortilla shell. Upon my first bite, I wasn't absolutely loving it, but the more bites I took, the more it grew on me. It had just a touch of hot sauce that gave it a nice kick, and I'd say all of the ingredients went well together. I'm not sure I'd order it again, just because they had some other good looking wraps, but overall it was pretty tasty. 

Again, I don't love sandwiches all that much, but if I have to go to a sandwich place, this would be my pick."}
{"text":"Ok so I have been here twice now on lunch.  Let me start by saying the subs are delicious.  Everything is fresh, top quality meats, breads.  The only \"but\" that was the cause of three stars is my biggest pet peeve.  They seem to rush so fast to get u out the door they screwed up my sub both times I was there.   No onions I hate onions and got them both times.  Slow Down, think about what your doing, and think how the customers feel about being shoved off like that by the employees.  I do highly recommend the place maybe just shout or sing ur special request so they remember it."}
{"text":"I read rave reviews about this place and it was 2 blocks from my hotel, so i had to check it out!
The NY accent is definitely thick and abounds in there!
The menu is huge!
The specials are indeed all over the place!

I went with the turkey special and spaced when ordering it and got a wrap... Not that yummy bread that everyone speaks so highly of.
I couldn't believe it as it existed my mouth... sigh.
It was made fresh right in front of me, and i even had a choice for the wrap - wheat, spinach, tomato or something else... woah!

There are cute tables out front, unfortunately a family of about 15 small children bogarted it for the entire time i was there.
The light rail passes by and luckily is not very loud.

I would definitely be here frequently if i lived here, but alas, i am just passing through!
If you are attending a conference walk the 4 blocks down Adams, skip quiznos and subway and enjoy a great sandwich!

And try the meatball sub - it looked amazing!"}
{"text":"Great-sized sandwiches, fast and helpful service, but next time would choose to not eat in. 

Got the factory special, basically an Italian and it was good! Bf got a Reuben, and it was also delicious. 

Great food, deli atmosphere."}
{"text":"Tried The Hero Factory out for the first time today.  I will definitely be going back.  I tried the veggie lover sandwich and had them add avocado for extra yumminess and it was quite delectable."}
{"text":"Love the ambiance, just like home! Meatball parm is delicious!!! Will be back whenever I'm in the area."}
{"text":"I was very impressed.  I was downtown for jury duty, so I thought I'd find a local place for lunch. Very good-  larger sandwich (easily shared) with lots of good meats, and really good bread.
  I had an apparently new sandwich- \"Nicole's Bitch-With.\" Quite good and exactly what I would expect from the girl with a cat hat and packing a snub auto- sassy with a bite.
  The sandwiches are just under $8, so plan on at least $10 if you want a drink."}
{"text":"Thoroughly enjoyed my first time to the factory. Ordered Nicole's huge bitch sandwich! Was delicious.  If you have time you should definitely stay, eat your food and enjoy the entertainment. Crew works very well together. Will be coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"Had a New Yorker Sub today, April 24th.  Delicious!"}
{"text":"Love this place... as much for the food as gun-totin' Nicole and the staff.  Having read the other reviews of the place, I won't repeat the same stuff over and over... but all the accolades are true... generous sandwiches, good drink selection, nice atmosphere.  My fave sandwich is the Ms Rachel, which is similar to downtown deli's New Yorker, but on a delish sub roll with pastrami, slaw, Russian dressing and Swiss cheese.  Also try the knish (but prepare to share, it's big.)  Also, the address is given as 114 West Adams, but the place is actually on 1st Ave north of Adams.
In a downtown with lots of eateries but not so many great ones, you'll find yourself coming back to the Hero Factory."}
{"text":"If this isn't the best place to go downtown for lunch, then it is among the best. Gotta love the eat coast owners."}
{"text":"Meh. Went there for an early lunch with the fiance today after reading so many great reviews here on Yelp. They definitely have a great selection of meats and cheeses and potato salad, if you're in to that but the 2 sandwiches that we had were rather average. They were certainly not terrible, but as someone who lives down the street from DeFalco's Family Deli in Scottsdale, every $8 sub is held to a certain standard. 

I had the Italian Sausage and Peppers (and Onions) on sesame sub roll, she had a chicken sub with peppers and cheese (mozzarella?) on wheat. The breads we quite good. We expected her sub to be made with the grilled chicken that was in the deli counter but it was actually made with a deep fried cutlet which was pretty disappointing since the grilled chicken looked so good. I had a couple bites of hers and it was decently good and with some marinara, I would have no problem eating it again (although I would order something else next time).

The sausage and peppers was good. Not GREAT, but good. I had marinara and provolone put on it so that, combined with the juiciness and sauce of the sausage/pepper/onion concoction, made for a messy experience. Again, it was far from being a terrible sandwich, but for $8 I'd like a little more flavor and less \"mess\". 

I'm not saying not to go here. Do it! It's better than Subway or Quizno's, hands down and it's great to support local businesses. I just have a problem spending $18 on 2 subs and a drink and not being completely satisfied.  The reason I go to DeFalco's (and pay the same amount of money) on a weekly basis is because I KNOW I will get every dollar worth of delight out of my sandwich. They have a great sausage/pepper but, as many of you may know, their cheese steaks are what make that place shine. I'll leave that for another review.

CONCLUSION: Hero Factory is good. Good, fresh food, good low-key atmosphere, nice helpful (gun-toting) staff. If I had the option to order a half-sub for $5, this review may have been a little different. I'll go back at some point to order something different, but when asked to rate this particular experience? Meh."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches and service.  Long lines for lunch and forget about ordering and picking up for lunch."}
{"text":"Awesome food and people. They are incredibly friendly and after leaving this place I genuinely feel I have stepped away from a shop in New York!"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time and tried the Mr. Reuben. It hit the spot. Very good in my opinion. They charged me for extra Russian sauce so the total was $9.50. I could get a Jimmy Johns sub down the street for a few dollars less but they are a little smaller there and not as good so I guess it evens out. I'll be going back soon."}
{"text":"The \"New York\" inspired deli that dots the streets of everytown USA.  A good sandwich, particularly the Copper Square, for when you are stuck down town without a lunch date."}
{"text":"I was visiting from Chicago and had a a friend (who is a Phoenix Police Officer) take me for lunch at the Hero Factory. 1st rule of thumb, if you see cops eating at a restaurant you can usually assume it's good.  In the case of the Hero Factory, it is AMAZING!! 

You are greeted by the owner, Nicole, behind the counter the minute you walk in.  She is upbeat, smiling and full of energy! Before you even order you are having a great experience! The sandwiches are HUGE and priced right. I am so thankful I only got half and a bowl of the soup which was just the right temperature too.  The meat is piled high, the seasoning is awesome and the veggies are crisp and fresh. 

We dined there and it had a cool vibe going! Customers were greeted by their first names and many times the employees were making their sandwich before they even ordered.  They have tons of regulars which says a lot too. 

I get to Phoenix at least once a year and the Hero Factory will be on my list of regular stops from now on.  I just wish we had one in Chicago :( Keep up the great work and keep smiling Nicole!! A treasure of a HERO shop!!!"}
{"text":"I've heard about the Hero Factory for years but never had the chance to try their sandwiches until today. While waiting in the 4 hour line to redeem our Jimmy Fallon tickets, our friends were kind enough to give my pregnant self a break and let me grab a sandwich while they held our spot in line. The Hero Factory truly lived up to their name because their sandwiches were incredible and they were the closely spot open to the Orpheum. I ordered the buffalo chicken wrap and my husband had the Eddie Machete. Both sandwiches were amazing but I especially loved my husband's which had chicken, bacon, cheese and this amazing chipotle mayo. I wish I lived closer to the Hero Factory so I could enjoy their sandwiches more. The guys working there were super nice and friendly. If you're in Downtown Phoenix, stop by for a sandwich and you won't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Only open for breakfast and lunch, Hero Factory caters to the downtown Phoenix lunch crowd with humongous, top of the line hero sandwiches. With veteran deli owners Nicole Dorio and Jay Friedman, quality and freshness are high while the prices are low. Hero only uses Boar's Head meats and cheeses, which you've probably seen before in the expensive side of the grocery store meat counters. This makes all of the difference in quality comparison to the places, left unnamed, who sell $5 subs. You'll notice the difference! Then there is the bread! Covered with toasted sesame seeds, the toothsome bread has a light bagel texture, slightly chewy while remaining tender. No wonder since the bread is sourced from our own local Chompies bakery.

When you set foot inside the first thing you're going to notice is the smell. A mixture of onions, meat and tomato sauce fragrances permeate the air inside causing an instant and raging hunger. The deli counter is broken up into 3 different areas, each more moth watering then the next. The first case is filled with all sorts of delectable salads and desserts. Then there is the meat and cheese case, where the owners slice the meat to order whether for a sandwich or by the pound. Then there is the hot section which has steaming hot dishes of deli classics like sausage and peppers and meatballs, the fantastically overwhelming smell was quickly fingered. 

Ordering can be a bit tough due to the fact that everything sounds so wonderful. Signature Heroes both cold and hot, wraps, salads and sides make up the large and straight forward menu. Place your order at the counter, pay, then grab a seat and you'll be called when its ready. Once this process is started you can watch as your meat is sliced and your sandwich assembled. Ive always enjoyed watching my food prepared, you can learn so much for your own kitchen. Yes, Ive already ordered my very own meat slicer so I can do this at home on the weekends when Hero is closed.

The heroes at Hero are big, thick and piled heavy with meat, cheese and toppings. 2 big eaters can easily share 1 hero sandwich and a side no problem. Being the big bear that I am I did barely manage to finish one by myself and was quite miserable for sometime after that. Fortunately parking in downtown Phoenix is kind of spread out so a nice walk afterwards will really help out. The easiest method would be to park in mid town then take the light rail to the Hero Factory, it runs right by.

With so many heroes to chose from I went ahead and put my trust in the owner Jay. He immediately tells me that his favorite hero is the Manhattan ($7.95). Anything with \"man\" in it has to be good, right? A thick stack of roast beef piled high on toasted garlic bread all covered with melted mozzarella cheese. This sandwich was in its most pure form, no veggies and sauces to get in the way, just the simple flavor of good meat, cheese and bread. When he came to check on his sandwich I asked for some Russian dressing for a bit of a variation, this single element added that extra dimension that turned the Manhattan from good to great! Their Russian dressing is some of the best I've had. They really should bottle and sell this dressing, can't wait to try it on a salad! Of course the owner is going to know what's best to eat off of his menu. It was great that he didn't say the generic phrase, \"everything is good on the menu\".

Taking matters in my own hands, next up was the Crackerjack ($7.95). While not as anti-holiday as I was looking for this one was simply fantastic! Thin sliced cracked pepper turkey, oozy melted pepper jack cheese then dressed with lettuce, tomatoes, onions and their amazing Russian dressing. Each bite of the spicy turkey and cheese was a hard contrast to the sweet flavors of the holiday; this one definitely has some heat to it. If something all American is more your liking, then the Patriot ($7.95) will be a home run! Roast Beef, turkey, ham and American cheese topped with lettuce, tomato and onion. You can never go wrong with the basics at Hero.

What's a deli without trying some of the home made salads? The cheese and bacon tortellini salad ($1.75 1/2lb) was so creamy, smoky and tender, one taste was not enough. In fact this one was so good I didn't want to share with my table mates. The deli case also had a tomato and mozzarella salad ($1.75 1/2lb) that was perfectly dressed with balsamic vinegar and olive oil. Each cherry tomato exploded with sweet tangy flavor contrasted by the balsamic coated mozzarella, delightful.

The hours at Hero are limited to weekday mornings and afternoons which may be the only drawback to his location. Since the light rail is moving finally and more businesses are opening downtown, perhaps the hours will include a Saturday? I sure hope so, I really love this place!"}
{"text":"I am new to Phoenix and was happy to find somewhere with Boar's Head meats and cheeses (and more importantly, Boar's Head dill pickles).  I ended up gettting the Islander, which includes chicken cutlet, bacon, melted cheddar and BBQ sauce.  

The hoagie roll itself was big, so I was looking forward to a sandwich I could eat for lunch and dinner.  I must say, for close to $8 they could have put a little more chicken in the sandwich.  The flavors, however, were pretty good.  And the hoagie roll, loaded with sesame seeds, added to the nice flavors."}
{"text":"They wouldn't pay their rent and back rent so the landlord terminated their lease. Closed. No gun slingin here anymore."}
{"text":"5 Stars!!!  This place is a MUST \"stop by and try\" if you haven't already!   It's in somewhat of a convenient location if your in this area of downtown, near the court house.  Nicole is fantastic, despite what some lefties might write about her, and she makes some of the best sub style sandwiches you'll find anywhere near downtown.  She welcomes everyone including the left winged misguided souls :-)

Selections, after you par-ooze her menu on the back wall take a look at some of the more creative specials posted down in front.  I chose the bitches bitch, which was the most awesome roast beef 10.5 inch sub with different kinds of peppers and cheese on a toasted sesame seed role.  It was DELISH!   My friend Rand had a hot pastrami hero with some extra spicy mustard.  He enjoyed it and her despite the fact she was packing some heat, literally :-)

Stop by and see Nicole and try one of her deli sandwiches!   You will enjoy it and look forward to coming back to see her again."}
{"text":"Seems as if some folks from the NW of the country have the same taste buds as the Brits, maybe bangers and mash would suit better? All I can say is the essence of a great sandwich shop is here. Great menu, plus you can order it as you make it at home. Owners rock with their attitude (always friendly) and let me stand around and waffle over my choice. Carnegie Deli? No, you don't get an overpriced sandwich that takes 40 minutes to get through the line for and is mediocre at best. Just because celebs go there doesn't make it good. But if you want a t-shirt, you can buy one like you can at Carnegie. That's where the similarities end. If you've transplanted here from the east like me, you will not find a better place to eat. Period. Have a nice day!"}
{"text":"This is a New York style deli with meats sliced to order with a wide variety of hero options and daily specials.  
Hours are 6am to 5pm M-F

If you work or live in the downtown area near 1st Ave & Adams, you've gotta try the Hero Factory. I'm making my way through the menu one hero at a time with a visit at least once a week and enjoying every bite of it too.  These are honestly the best hero subs I have ever had in my life. The portions are huge, enough to share with a friend.  Not only is the food awesome but the people who run this shop are very cool. They put a lot of heart into every meal they serve with great appreciation.

Need a recommendation? 
Try the Godfather- Italian meats on toasted garlic bread...It's to live for!"}
{"text":"OMG, the best sandwich I have ever eaten anywhere.  I had  the Big Bitch.  The roast beef was sliced paper thin and laidon the huge roll in mounds.  Jalapeños and other peppers were full of flavor and the sauce had just the right touch of horseradish.  Nicole, the owner is cute, down to earth, and fun to talk to.  I went with my buddy Arlin and he had the sausage and pepper hero.  He gave me a piece of the most delicious Italian sausage I ever tasted.  A little sweet, but spicy.  I'm a bit of a fat boy and I like to eat lots, but I had to take some home to my wife and not just because I love her, the sandwiches are robust and worth the price.  Drive, take a bus, ride the light rail, but get to this place for lunch as soon as you can."}
{"text":"It was your typical hero style sandwich shop and plenty of options. The breakfast menu was better than most in the area and the prices were reasonable. The food was good and I ate breakfast there twice during my stay, it was quick, hot and one block from my hotel. WARNING if you're from Boston and they know, you'll hear it from the staff, they're imports from NY...  FYI, besides that it was a locals spot as most of the customers were regulars."}
{"text":"A-Freaking-Mazing!!!!  Nicole, you are my new best friend!!!  Ordered the doodlewich and it was awesome, soooo huge though, had to split it with a co-worker. My ONLY regret is not discovering them sooner."}
{"text":"3/5

the sandwiches are huge. i'm not to bent on the whole freedom fries this and such on the menu, but it is AZ so i guess that is how it runs."}
{"text":"Pretty good deli sandwich but a hassle for parking. Love the selection of things to buy sorta like a little market in NY!"}
{"text":"I love this place. I get the same thing most of the time ... Buffalo chicken ranch wrap. Great selection of wraps and sandwiches. I need to try something else sometime."}
{"text":"The wrap I got was awful. I'm pretty sure they ran out of the ingredients and tried to improvise cus it was during a lunch rush but I wish they had just told me so I wouldn't waste the money on something I couldn't even eat..."}
{"text":"Not open Saturday unlike the Yelp page. No hours listed on building. Breakfast fail. It's very disappointing to walk all the way to a restaurant to find it is closed. A complete waste of time. I was looking forward to it. I won't be fooled again. Save yourself the trouble and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Oh yeah. This place rocks! Definitely authentic. I felt very pressured to order in that New York nice kind of way.

As a frequent NY traveler (just read my other reviews) it felt every bit like I was in a New York deli, except there was room to move around and not a lot of people talking very loudly.

The subs are huge, fresh and tasty. I am definitely planning on sampling as much from the menu as I can. So far, I would say this is the best sandwich shop in town."}
{"text":"Delicious! This is my favorite spot of sandwiches downtown. It's a NY style deli and they aren't afraid to broadcast it. They use boar's head deli meat and there is no skimping on proportions. The hoaggie bread is perfectly soft with sesame seeds on top, but they have other options if you want to be \"healthy.\" There is a strong battle in my heart of Ms. Rachel vs. Mr. Ruben when comes to selection time, but the buffalo chicken wrap makes a good lunch too. The side dishes are pretty good too, but I hardly ever have room for it.

It's totally worth the hassle of limited parking and downtown madness to stay full all day."}
{"text":"In short, this tiny downtown sub shop serves affordable breakfast and big hero sandwiches. No vegan options though, but they have vegetarian breakfast items.
I've only eaten here in the morning and usually order the garden platter which came with potatoes and coffee for under $6.
I wish they'd serve tofu scrambles, but they are not that kind of restaurant.
The place is clean and breakfast items are inexpensive and decent. I can't really comment about the other items though. 
Overall rating + 3.5"}
{"text":"Wtf!?  

Who puts disgusting, processed American cheese on a sub sandwich!?

Every time I go back to this place, it gets worse.

For...the...love...of...God...

This is why I'm scared to go out for lunch in Phoenix.  Nobody seems to have a clue about what you should and shouldn't do.

Also, the bread.  Why choose a bread that has millions of tiny sesame seeds?  Hmm?  No bueno.

Hey, Hero Factory, the 80s called.  They love your cheese.

The rest of us, not so much.

I paid about $11.00 for this awesome sub and a small bag of chips.

If you appreciate it when people flaunt their right to wear a gun in public, then this is the place for you.

However, if you want some decent food, I would avoid the Hero Factory.

They get 2-stars for quick service and good jalapeno potato chips."}
{"text":"Now THAT is a freakin sandwich!! Thank god I don't work downtown, otherwise I would be fat as hell. 

These sandwiches (excuse me, hero's) are GIANT and delicious. I eat the first half and I'm full before I then find myself fighting my inner fattie to not finish the whole thing. The Godfather is delicious, and the owners are all real cool. Try a delicious Dr. Brown's Cream Soda with your Hero, they are the perfect combination!"}
{"text":"Hands down best sandwich in the state.   Nice clean business.  The owner is a lil rough but you won't have any smelly bums wandering in and out while you are trying to eat."}
{"text":"Great food and good service, very clean, and locally owned which we should all support."}
{"text":"I have ate here about 4 times and have always had a good hot (if I ordered a hot sandwich) sandwich or a great factory special (an italian hero)  I love the bread as I've stated in a few of my previous reviews: it's all about the bread! The meat is top notch and has always been fresh and delicious.
I love the deli style feel. The people that work there are always nice and are good at getting you through the line quickly. 

I will be back and my search for a great hero is over"}
{"text":"I'm taking a one star deduction for not being open after 3p or on weekends. 

To put it simply I am craving this right now bad and I cant have it.  

Very rarely do I go somewhere that bills itself as New York and have it live up. This place is one of the exceptions.  It backs up the New York moniker.  

Best damned sangwhich in town period!"}
{"text":"Good sandwich, fresh, priced average for downtown (expensive place to do business), but the loud, obnoxious music will keep me from coming back!"}
{"text":"I've been going for the past 2 years.  The food quality is great, the workers seem to love their jobs, and are quick and efficient.   Recommend them highly."}
{"text":"^^^CLOSED^^^
Walked over for lunch today to find an 'occupancy terminated, closed for business' notice on the door. A gentleman was leaving as I arrived & he stated that he will soon be renting the space to another tenant. Another one bites the dust, it seems."}
{"text":"Had the Patriot with spicy mustard. Nicole said I needed to have spicy mustard 'cause only girls order regular mustard. Sandwich was freakin awesome."}
{"text":"I tried this place for lunch and had a great experience.   I tried the sausage and peppers sandwich... that was awesome.   They even had March Madness on TV.  I think the prices are a little on the high side but they're a mom & pop restaurant so I understand.  

I'll be back soon..."}
{"text":"The Hero Factory is a great place for a quick & delicious meal. The prices are great, the portions are huge & the heroes are as close to ones you'd get in NYC as you can get. Plus, the staff is super friendly, make great conversation while they make your delicious sandwich, salad or wrap. 

If you're a vegetarian I recommend the eggplant hot hero, it's cheesy, crispy, everything a delicious Italian sandwich should be."}
{"text":"Food was overpriced for what it was, and the quality was borderline gross. The person making the food was pulling up their shirt and scratching their stomach the entire time. Not going back there."}
{"text":"Was downtown today at the right time...just b4 lunch. Left my comfort and ordered the Po Boy sammie and holy Effaroonies was it good. Had to fight the nap dart that was stuck in my neck after. What's great is they aren't all chincy with their meat and it's QUALITY. Yes, you pay for it, but damn you're full. If you open your fat mouth about something expect Nicole to bite back. Be cool, get your food, say bye and get the fuck out. Love this place 5 stars indeed! Shit, I think I'll make a special trip down there tomorrow for a cutlet sammie, like Forrest Gump...for no particular reason at all......"}
{"text":"I used to live in NY and while that may not make me a New Yorker, I think I know a little something about a real New York deli.  Hero Factory is the ONLY real New York Deli in Phoenix.  Every detail from the Metro ripping by outside to the obnoxious broad behind the counter calling my sandwich \"naked\", you almost feel like you are on Long Island.

The best part of Hero Factory is the bread.  They have some secret recipe for it that makes you want to buy it in bulk.  Anything they put on it is great but the top item is the chicken salad.  I know that is weird to say because, at a deli, you expect cold cuts.  While all of the hot and cold sandwiches I have tried are good, the chicken salad is better than anything around.  

The other thing about this place that makes it so great is the location.  Not only did they go under the Orpheum Lofts, giving them some instant credibility, but they helped keep the corner of Monroe and 1st Ave alive after Nick's 101 went under.  They have some competition next door but the line is always coming out into the street by 11:30 during the week.

Biggest disappointment - they close too early."}
{"text":"The Hero Factory is one of my favorite spots downtown!
I love the atmosphere that Nicole and her staff provide! You can have a chill conversation with Nicole while you wait for your food...she's the coolest owner you'll ever meet!
The food is great and everything is made fresh when you order it.
Subs are big enough for 2 people and very tasty and hearty!
I recommend the western omelette for breakfast and the patriot for lunch!!!
Amazing place!"}
{"text":"I always go there for the eggplant parmesan! Very tasty. Nice and attentive service is a plus."}
{"text":"[Solid 3.5 stars] 
Not having tried this place yet, as I was running errands on my lunch hour I decided to stop in. 
So I have this thing....one that impels me to order Egg Salad whenever I see it on a menu. Here they do, so when it was my turn in line...Egg salad sandwich please! They grabbed a heavily sesame seeded, at least 12\", baguette from its resting place and filled it full of chunky egg salad and topped it off with shredded lettuce and fresh sliced tomato. Adding a bag of Salt and Vinegar chips my lunch came to just under $9. 
I have to say that the bread was great, sturdy but soft! The egg salad was quality, rich and tasty (very few ever have enough yellow mustard for me and find myself adding extra). 
The sandwich was so large I just had half and saved the other half for later. 
The only negative for me was the type of butcher paper and amount of it they used to wrap my sandwich. It was a bit thick and bulky, especially since the sandwich itself was wrapped in a piece, cut in half and then wrapped again in this thick paper. 

Otherwise the service was fast and friendly and I will surely stop in again in the future."}
{"text":"With all apologies to The Downtown Deli, The Hero Factory makes the best sandwiches Downtown. Owner Nicole is a laugh riot and she and her staff churn out bigger-than-your-head sandwiches at great prices (especially when you consider that their subs are really two meals). I'm a wrap guy and their club, buffalo chicken and Ceasar wraps are all top notch. 

The only tip I'd give is to come early because by high noon the line is spilling out the door."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place and I think if I had ordered anything else off of their menu I would have.  Unfortunately I ordered their veggie and it just didn't really work out.  The bread was great and all their veggies were nice and fresh, but the sandwich just needed a little something extra (a second cheese, some seasoning, SOMETHING) just to give it some flavor.  I tried adding salt and pepper but it just wasn't enough.

I'm giving them three stars since the guys working there were really friendly and the bread was good.  If I ever get a chance to come back to Phoenix I'll give one of their meat sandwiches a try."}
{"text":"It's been three years now that I've been coming to the Hero Factory, and I have never once had an experience that was anything short of exemplary. There are many spots to get a sandwich downtown, but this is 'the' spot. I've tried various items from the menu and all have been spot on, but the Godfather is what keeps me coming back. 

Everyone working there is nice and outgoing  and they'll make you feel at home. I wish them unlimited success in the future, and I sincerely look forward to my next Godfather."}
{"text":"Worth a try?  definitely yes...I had the reuben and it was very good. The pasta salad was incredible. The attractive lady working the register talked me into it and I'm glad she did. The sesame bread is a bit weird at first but it actually finishes great. The staff was friendly,  the attractive one might come off strong but she has a good heart."}
{"text":"Thus far, I have not had anything I didn't like. My buddy tried one of the subs here and thought it was great. The pricing is a little higher than other places, but considering just how much sandwich you get for your money it is worth it (half for lunch, half for dinner). Line starts right at the counter when you walk in, not the other way around - just a tip so you don't goof it like I did."}
{"text":"Get the knish with ham & cheese (smothered with mustard) and your tummy will know happiness. This little treat saved my morning yesterday and I'm still thinking lovingly about it. Next time, I'm subbing the ham for bacon.

:drools:"}
{"text":"I am updating my review with 5 starts for their salads because I love them. Az is seriously lacking in good delis in town. The only NY based deli I can find in Phoenix with Long Island Style Potato salad and I have looked everywhere. They also have Knishes which are hard to find too. They do run out though, insert sad face. 

I love to come here when I am in Downtown. Nicole reminds me of home. She is so NY. I love her stories. You will hear them if you visit. Don't be shy or prudish when visiting here. Ha! You will get an earful.  

Cassellas in Scottsdale and Hero factory in Phoenix are the two best delis in town. The only bad thing is the location and hours. If you do not work in downtown it is hard to get here. I do see they are open on Saturdays now so that is better. The sandwiches are pretty tasty here. So far I have had chicken salad, turkey and roast beef. All of them delish! Some folks have commented on the bread. I like their sesame seed sub rolls. They are not as good as NY, but what is?"}
{"text":"I don't have much to say other than I love this place and their Chicken Salad is incredible.  It's a short walk from our house, but is unfortunately always closed by the time we get home from work.  We rejoice anytime we have a day off and we make every effort to make it to Hero Factory to pick up a sandwich.  

I know absolutely nothing about New York authenticity, but I can tell you that this place is damn good.  Try the chicken salad.  'Nuff said."}
{"text":"Came here today for a quick, late lunch at 2pm. They close at 3pm and aren't open on the weekends due to the lack of business after hours and on weekends. Too bad too because I could see coming here on the weekends. 

The place is spotless and they had a great selection of drinks, even Diet Cherry Pepsi! Tons of different sandwich options and it was helpful to check out their menu online first or I could have easily stood there for 20 minutes trying to decide what to order. I opted for the CrackerJack and my fiance tried their New Yorker. Both were warm and delicious! The sandwiches were both huge and  only half was filling enough for both of us. I love it when one meal can be spread out for lunch for two days.

We got to talk to the owner, Nicole, who was very NY and very friendly. She informed us that she no longer used Boars Head meats and was using a local supplier.  Both our meats were great but having not too much BH before, I can't really compare. She also mentioned that she offered cold-cuts for purchase so I may even come weekly and get some fresh slices for our own meals we make at home.  It was a bit unusual to see her packing a gun on her hip but I can't say I blame her either. I knew many people wouldn't want to mess with her and that was BEFORE I saw the gun! LOL She was friendly and seemed genuinely grateful for our business and I love supporting local businesses.  We'll definitely come back!"}
