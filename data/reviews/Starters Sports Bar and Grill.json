{"text":"Great service! It is for sure a dive bar but I loved it. The cheese curds were amazing! I had a great time playing pool, drinking beer, and eating food!"}
{"text":"Good times good eats and the champ is always there most nights. It's divy and they have karoke every Wednesday night."}
{"text":"this place offer the best Nachos and Steak Philly sandwich in town. you will be so amazed by the huge quantity of Nachos you will get when you order it and it taste so delicious. you cant never get wrong with any of their menu items.   personally i love that place and love to eat there whenever i feel hungry."}
{"text":"Met up with some friends on our way to Black Sabbath concert for happy hour on a Friday . Beers were cold, service was as better than expected. We have plans to experience the true nature of this place and watch a NASCAR race there in a couple of weeks."}
{"text":"Awesome vibes, great food, and tons of fun! Starters also houses 2 Golden Tee machines that are only 3.50 to play! Cheapest you'll find in Phoenix! You should ask about the bacon hot sauce they sell too!"}
{"text":"I'm come here several night a week to play the free poker. The service is always pleasant. Their food menu consist of only pizza and wings -which sucks- but other than that I enjoy coming here."}
{"text":"This place is great. Prices are right. Definitely better than Tempe tavern. They're personable and prices are great. Tabby is our favorite bartender and she sets the vibe for the bar and it's a great environment when she's here. She remembers what we drink before we ask which is cool. You should try their food too. I have been in Arizona since 2010 and finally found my bar."}
{"text":"Fun. Two Golden Tee machines, pool tables, darts. Plain dive bar, with some decent food."}
{"text":"Ive ordered food twice here and was not pleased either time.  Once was a cheesesteak which was just OK.  Considering the convenience of the location being so close to my apartment I decided I would try them again, this time a cheeseburger, cheese fries and mozz sticks, cant be hard to mess up right? Wrong! They use spicy nacho cheese on the fries, nothing about the burger was appetizing(seemed like really cheap beef) and the mozz sticks just werent good."}
{"text":"This place is the essence of dive bar. The prices are good, food is good (my guy loves the wings), staff is very set. Tabby is a particular mainstay and serves us up with the usual before we take our seats. Regulars are a bit off putting due to certain addictions and problems, which at times are easier to overlook. We visit for karaoke which was good with Lindsay and Frank the Tank. Still, I wish it was more comfortable visiting without dealing with local issues. Love the staff and karaoke, wish they had a bit more control on the local element."}
{"text":"My bf ordered us food from here to go. Best cheese burger I've EVER had. Juicy patty, cheddar cheese, toasted bun.  It was darn good. I want one right now just thinking about it. Wings are good too.  Bit of a biker bar which isn't really my scene, but I can't pass up a good burger!"}
{"text":"Decent unassuming sports bar with good grub and good beer. Many TVs and a full bar. Service was as good as it gets. This place is owned by a nice young couple from Minnesota."}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place.  Our neighborhood doesn't have many bars and I walk by this place on my way home from the light rail.  I walked in and I was greeted by many of the regulars, which was pretty cool.  As soon as I sat down though, I noticed how filthy this place was and I just couldn't get past it.  I wish there were more choices for food.  You have 2 things to choose from... frozen pizza or frozen wings.  I went for the wings.  Unfortunately, you can watch the bartender \"cook\" the meal in front of you and in an unflattering way.  I saw a chicken wing or 2 fall off the grease rack and onto the counter and then back into the fryer.  EEEK! That counter was probably not the cleanest, either.   The beer was ice cold and good.  Then some of the regulars got a little too close to me and started their drunk banter in my face.  Things got a little rowdy than I like them to be on a Wednesday afternoon at 4:45. LOL  I probably won't go back to Starters, but hey... it's definitely worth trying once."}
{"text":"This place is a treat. I've stopped by on several evenings and each visit was unique. There's always something going on, whether it be Karaoke or Texas Hold'em, and because it's such a dive, it's very easy to participate in everything. But, don't get me wrong, sometimes it does get fairly busy. And, I've met the most random types of people here - often very friendly and willing to strike up a conversation.  Decent happy hour prices and the food is so-so. I haven't checked it out for sports, but they have a good size patio that looks like it could be pretty fun on a cooler night out. Though I really only go here because it's on the way home from other bars I frequent, it doesn't dissapoint as a good last-drink stop."}
{"text":"Went here last night with some friends. It wasnt busy, which was fine with us. They had the typical bar fly old man sitting rigtht by the door when I walked in who gave me the \"you know you arent allowed to smoke in here, and you are on FIRE\".. line.  Drinks were pretty strong and not badly priced. They dont serve food after midnight, so we just drank shots instead! Juke box was ok- had to supersearch and pay extra for some normal recent stuff, but if you like 80 rock, or journey..then you are all set here. The bartender, Jessica, i think she said her name was, was cool and made conversation with us"}
{"text":"Great neighborhood bar. I've spent may days in there where I only came for one beer but then got lost in conversation with the bartenders, owners or another beer lover."}
{"text":"The wings are great and the people that work there are even better. I would like to see more on the menu like some wraps but if you want to go to this place and have great service, play some golden tee and pool while watching the game on the big screen then this place is for you."}
{"text":"Awesome local bar & service.  If you're hungry & want a few beers this is the place to visit."}
{"text":"Horrible service.  Only one bartender on duty on friday afternoon w/ baseball games and preseason football on today.  After sitting for 1/2 an hour without talking to ANY of the staff, they still charged me for a beer after telling me they were showing a game that they weren't.  Don't plan on coming back."}
{"text":"I think this place is pretty great. It's your typical hole in the wall dive bar with cheap drinks (especially during happy hour), sports on TV, pool, pinball, Golden Tee, poker, jukebox, karaoke, wings, friendly people, blue collar, mostly regulars, but still friendly to strangers. A great place to watch a game, even better for a Nascar race on Sundays, when it is busiest.  They have a limited menu -- typical bar food. The wings are pretty good. One thing that's a little different about this place is that the bartenders cook the food right in front of you at the bar. That seemed a bit odd at first, but it turns out to be a good thing because you can be more involved in what they're doing with your food. No guessing about what's actually happening in the kitchen.  For entertainment options... They sometimes have live music or DJs on Friday nights, and Karaoke every Wednesday and Saturday nights starting at 9 PM. Trivia on Tuesdays and Wednesdays at 7 PM. Golden Tee, pinball and a soft tip dart game.  I highly recommend this place if you're looking for a dive bar in Tempe with cheap drinks and friendly people.  A quick note to the negative reviewers on this page: Your experience is not common. Every place has bad nights. Overall, this place is pretty great, especially if you're expecting a casual experience. I understand it's not for everybody, since it is a bit rough around the edges. I wouldn't bring a prom date here or anything. But if you're just looking to kick back and watch a game, it might be worth another shot."}
{"text":"MY FAVORITE DIVE BAR OF ALL TIME!!  The place is super laid back and relaxed! Every day they have a different event going on such as poker or karaoke.  The food is so yummy! My fav are the wings..grilled and resauced and come out perfect each time! My boo loves the grilled cheese!  The bartenders are SOOOOOO nice! I love me some \"Tabby\"! One thing for sure, they don't take ish from anyone so if you're comin in their with some kinda attitude...I'd recheck myself. lol   I love the fact that its a mixed crowd. All kinds of different people go there from bikers to hipsters!   All in all, I love this place...it keeps me coming back ;]"}
{"text":"Sad to say that this place has gone down hill since I used to visit :(. Drinks barley contain booze I ordered a 7&7 it was clear no trace of any whiskey.  The bartender spent most her time hanging with who appeared to be her boyfriend. There is some kind of horrible smell coming from the restrooms that permeates the air when the doors are opened.  Place just needs some TLC. What happened to this little gem? Based on my visit last night I would never recommend this place again to anyone. Owner or management needs to visit this place clean it up and retrain the staff."}
{"text":"VERY short bar pours.  Nasty bathrooms.  Extremely mediocre and few TVs.   Poor TV sound.  No TVs on patio."}
{"text":"Great bar with friendly people.  You won't find a sweeter bartender than Ms. Kitty!  The owners where also very pleasant and fun to talk to!  I would recommend stopping in and giving it a try."}
{"text":"I really like this place, it have a good vibe to it and the bartenders make really good drinks. From what I've seen on the weekends it gets pretty packed."}
{"text":"Ghetto white trashy bar. First time here and my car was broken into."}
{"text":"As far as dive bars go this is pretty decent. I don't know why someone would say it was dirty and had poor service. We didn't experience that at all and this is Tempe. Pretty clean compared to the places on Mill. Tabby cooked up our burgers no prob. We didn't get drinks. Just stopped in for a study break. The regulars were really nice. One guy came up and talked to us invited us to hang later."}
{"text":"Summary: Dirty place, bad service with an attitude, watered down drinks, not like it used to be.   The following are my experiences from my last 2 visits:  First of all the place seems to always be dirty, restrooms are disgusting. 2nd to last time I went there I ordered a pitcher and 2 cups, the cups smelled like fish. I'm not saying they smeared fish in the cups, perhaps it was the dish soap's smell when not rinsed properly. Lady barkeeper took them back with a really nasty attitude, as if it was an almost impossible request.  Last time I went there I was ignored at the bar over 2 people who arrived after me, and I can understand confusion from the bartender if the bar was full but there were only 3 people there. When I raised my voice to get some service, this is exactly what she said; \"I'm on break\" and just stood there, and looked at her phone. Which is highly unhygienic. A second person ended up making my drinks and they were watered down, which is a pattern I have been detecting from a long time.  This place is going downhill like another yelper said. I don't even go there anymore. I'm giving them 2 stars and quite frankly don't know where my generosity is coming from."}
