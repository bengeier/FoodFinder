{"text":"Came here for lunch as I was craving a veal sandwich near my workplace.  The veal melted in my mouth it was so tender and not chewy like I've experienced at other places.  The tomato sauce the used was to die for good.  Service was good, friendly, and efficient.  While there o noticed they had a great tavola calda selection.  Will definitely go back to try for more."}

{"text":"I won't get into all the details how we ended up finding this place and how we were craving an Italian hot table for lunch. Let me tell you this was the WORST Italian hot table food that I have ever eaten. I had the bow tie penne Ala vodka which had absolutely no flavour, hardly any sauce. Honestly I ate it because I was hungry but did not enjoy any of it.  The food did not remember Italian or any or ethnicity. Does the person who made this even know how to cook? Don't let me get started on my husbands panini which was equally as bad. Don't you take pride in serving good food?"}
