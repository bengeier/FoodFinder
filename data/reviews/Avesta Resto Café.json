{"text":"The food is delicious! Mezzes, Manti (Mini ravioli in labné), Menemen (Turkish omelette) & hand made fresh bread! Service is ok! Pricing is reasonable!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to come here ever since i saw that woman making tortilla-like bread in the window!  Me and my friend decided to eat here because we didn't know where else to go. We had both never eaten turkish food so this was an experience.  We were greeted by a friendly waitress who seated us promptly and gave us the menu. After inspecting the menu items, we were both clueless! So i asked the waitress for some help. She was very kind and went through the menu with us.   Everything seemed yummy. Very uncomplicated food where the spices and ingredients speak for themselves.  We both had Gozleme; a panini like sandwich made with the lavash (tortilla like bread). You have different choices of fillings; i had beef and parsley and my friend had spicy spinach.  It's made almost in front of you on the stove were the lady makes the lavash.  The gozleme is served with a simple salad. I usually don't eat side salads but this one was yummy with its yogurt-like dressing and fresh parsley.   My gozleme was really good.... it tasted like a tiny meat pie. I could taste the spices and enjoyed it greatly.  To drink, i had turkish tea; it tastes like black tea but a little bit more bitter. It comes in a tiny glass and costs only $1. I loved it but i think its high in caffein.   For dessert, my friend and i shared a baklava. Its actually 4 little baklavas so it was perfect to share. Very good and tastes home made.  Overall, the food was amazing and came out to $13.50 with tip. Definitely going back.   Go try turkish food. its really good!"}
{"text":"This place had a nice atmosphere. The service was very good : kind and welcoming. Although they didn't have so much vegetarian options. But what I had (the omelet Menemen) was fresh, well presented and tasty. I will go back for sure !"}
{"text":"First time tried this resto in montreal the entree was borek with dolme and eggplant which were all old and cold not good in taste at all not comparable with the borek in turkey The main dish was small chops of lamb with vegetables so greasy and small portion the price was too expensive 19$  Small cup of tea like one small shooter 3$  Too expensive  It was not at all the turkish resto It is a totall shit"}
{"text":"Fantastic Turkish food that will leave you wanting to plan your next vacation in Turkey! Authentic and delicious! I'd go for the lahmacun and manti (dumplings)!"}
{"text":"Great Turkish restaurant and cheap!  It's a cozy little place with woven Turkish decor. Right in the front you can watch as the flatbread is made.   Perhaps the best steal on the menu is to choose a borek where you get an assortment of your choice to go with your bread. Absolutely delicious!!   As others have said, this bread-making resto heats up so I wouldn't suggest going on a 30 degree day but definitely go when slightly cooler out!"}
{"text":"One of the first places I ate at when I moved to Montreal. Very nice people. great food.  Nice atmosphere. I am not easily impressed by the version of Mediterranean food available in North America, but I have to say this place is very authentic."}
{"text":"The Turkish food is tasty but not here at this place and the portions are deplorable and  doesn't make you feel satiated , I asked for Burek and wine leaves  and got only 1 of Burek and 2 wine leaves after waiting for a long time besides no diversification in the menu , it is really for passers by on Saint Catherine who get trapped into trying it !"}
{"text":"As a Turkish person I must admit that rating the food here is a bit tough but I'm doing it per what goes and is available in North America, rather than a restaurant in proper Turkey.  Stuffed vine leaves, a staple of feasts at home in Turkey, is rarely done well in restaurants, especially in North America. Avesta gets it right most of the time, which is a blessing; if you are not vegetarian, I highly recommend ones with minced meat over veggie ones as the latter are harder to make well and Avesta does screw it sometimes too but their minced meat ones are almost always very good and definitely worth ordering.   Their mezze (appetizer) options are all very good; the way they make tzaziki/cacik is more to the Greek style than authentic Turkish but it fits well with rest of their menu. Be sure to try their gozleme, which are savoury stuffed flat bread buns (or 'crepes', one could say); they prepare those fresh and right in front of you at the store on a traditional saj stove. Similarly, their manti (tiny dumplings served in lovely Turkish yoghurt with mint-tomato paste sauce) is very good; I know that they work with local Turkish women to prepare those and hence am not surprised at the quality. Sometimes I find the filling to be a bit too much, but that's just my not-super-into meat self.  Their saj kavurma (sauteed chunks meat in special traditional pan) are all very delicious and also very hot/spicy; if you are not good with pepper, tell them in advance ordering this. I'd say this is their most authentic food out of all the entrees. I like their Inegol kofte (a kind of Turkish meatballs closely related to Balkan-style meatballs) and Beyti kebab (minced meat kebab wrapped in very thin flat bread, cut with sauce drizzled over), neither is anything like the original. Most of their entrees are in fact not exactly 'authentic' but they are tasty copies; the sort of food mums will make at home in Turkey as knock-offs of fancy restaurant kebabs that are very hard to make. It will give you a good idea of the sort of herbs and spices used in Turkish cuisine as well as the tones of taste and variety, even if they are not exactly authentic.  Their desserts are very meh; even by home-made standards, very very meh so I'd say skip it. Tea is alright; your regular Turkish tea; honestly not worth the cost, but hey if you have never had it, it's authentic Turkish tea so you may give it a try.  All in all: this place is a good place to go just for the bread and appetizers to be honest. In fact sometimes I go just for that. Also: do not expect quality waiting staff or service. They are polite and nice but also slow and often short in numbers. Turkish food itself takes very long to make, hence even Turkish people like me coming to a restaurant when we crave borek or kofte, so if you aren't willing to wait fifteen or thirty minutes for your food, don't bother--go to McDonalds; this is not 'fast food'. In Turkey its food probably wouldn't even be regarded as 'decent' by our restaurant standards, but it is very decent by North America standards."}
{"text":"Tres bon service . Portions de repas tres petites , prix tres cher , mezze sans gout beacoup de plats made in  micro onde ."}
{"text":"Management has recently changed, and there are new changes in staff as well.  The food is just as good, and the portions just as generous.  They showcase the unique talents of their breadmakers, who are also responsible for the delicious dumplings.  The food is always great, and well spiced.  The staff is attentive and helpful.  Cant recommend it more!"}
{"text":"I entered this place at 8:30 pm .we were quick to place our orders.We repeatedly asked for water which we got at 9:10 pm. It's 09:40 pm And our food has just arrived . There is just one person serving here . And it's by far the saddest tasting food we have had in Montreal (no salt at all)"}
{"text":"The good: Fresh, HOMEMADE, unique (but crowd-pleasing) food. Love the spicy chicken sandwich that is made with the yummy pita type bread. Can't remember a lot of the names of dishes I eat when I go there, but just ask for their favorites. I bring all my friends here when they are in town and everyone has been very surprised and ended up loving it. Finally, this is very easy on the wallet!! Very affordable lunches and dinners.   The bad: Very quiet restaurant (no ambience music), can be stuffy and warm, the service can be slow and can come off somewhat unfriendly -- I think the women working there are just a little quiet? The reason why my friends were surprised is because it doesn't LOOK impressive, but once you eat their food, you forget about all the bad parts of the review!   *remember the really good dish with the yogurt and meat takes a long time to cook, so prepare for a long wait, but its worth the wait! Just get some apps to hold you over."}
{"text":"I recommend going with few friends so you can order different meals and have a bite of everything :)   Amazing fresh breads should to be mentioned!  Unique taste of Turkey you could call it I guess lol"}
{"text":"Not everything here is great but I do enjoy their home made lavash bread,The manti (small home made dumplings in a yogourt sauce ) is pretty great, so is the gozleme almost like a turkish quesadilla? Their sandwiches are alright as well. I think its worth a try if you haven't had turkish food before."}
{"text":"Although the food is very expensive compared to quantity, the taste is very good. The chicken kebab was so tasty. The kunafe was awesome, i wish the quiantity was more, for 8.5 bucks it's super expensive and finishes within 3bites at most lol. The turkish coffee was nice too. The decor, service everything was good. Recommend."}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant 3 times this summer and every time I've been there the food has been excellent. I've been to Turkey and I love turkish food, so I don't use the word \"excellent\" lightly in this context.   The meat has always been cooked to perfection and their bread is delicious. But the one thing that will keep me coming back their again and again is their turkish Manti. Yum!   Their service also really great. Everyone is super friendly and food comes on time. Also the food is halal for those conscious of that."}
{"text":"This was the 3rd time I visited Avesta. I enjoy the mezes offered here, I had 3 choices to myself and it was more than enough. I took the eggplant, hummus and yogurt with cucumber.  The food was fresh and flavorful. I had my meal with a cup of Turkish tea. Food 4.5/5  The customer service is why I give this place 3 Stars. The woman who sat and served me was not welcoming. There was a table of 4 and another table of 2 people during my visit. Although, the service was extremely slow to order, get the food and pay at the end. The server was more hospitable to the other guests. I'm curious to try the kebabs or other dishes one day.  Service 2/5"}
{"text":"I can hardly consider this place a Turkish resto! The food is not bad, but it's far from Turkish food! Their homemade bread is more like cracker than bread! Very dry!!!! I waited almost 45 min for my order!!!! Not very friendly staff."}
{"text":"went to have dinner with my friends.  fresh handmade dough, well seasoned food, combo/trio system in appetizer, pretty decoration, appetizing demonstration seen from street.  just service was pretty bad; they came to put dishes on our table without any explanation, mistook orders, came back very late to take our empty dishes. still, they were friendly and very nice, i hope it wasn't their best and we can truely enjoy their food next time."}
{"text":"I tried this place because it looks very so authentic, and I wanted to try Turkish coffee. The coffee was excellent, and the beautiful presentation completed the experience. I tried the Borek appetizer as well, and it was very tasty.  The only drawback is that the service was a little slow and disorganized."}
{"text":"It was the coldest night in Montreal! We were looking for a desert spot when I recalled I once dined here. This was way much better an experience. Baklava and Kunafa. OMG that was yummy. Sweeeet but when swallowed with a pot of Turkish tea it feels just right. I did not expect it but besides Turkish music which I like there came few Persian music tracks that rang many bells and brought up many good memories. Like it! I'll visit more!  One more thing is the girls waiting the table. Nice, polite and much faster than we last dined here."}
{"text":"One of my favourite restaurants in Montreal. Went once but fell in love immediately!  We shared a plate of 4 mezzes and one chicken sadj kavurma between two people. All of the food was really tasty, tasted fresh, wasn't overly oily unlike many restos in this city.  On top of it, the staff was really nice. We had to be a bit patient at first, but once the service started it was great.  Definitely one of the top \"ethnic\" eats in Montreal!"}
{"text":"Best food you will ever anywhere anyplace on any planet ! Specially the kofta! Incredible ! Hands down wins"}
{"text":"Service was good as was the food, portions were great. We ordered a bit too much the first time so when we go back we will chose less. Lots of leftovers."}
{"text":"It was my first time having traditional turkish food. It was the best ever. I have since been back there 3 times in a matter of 4 months. That says a lot about how yummy their food is. You cannot go wrong with any of their dishes. My parents are vegetarian and they had great options here. Everyone was happy and of course I was already happy. A must go to stop if you are visiting Montreal!"}
{"text":"This review is based on dining at weekday evening. The restaurant wasn't crowded as we expected. One lady was making gozleme right by the entrance which is impressive. The waitress who greeted us was very nice. Dining room looks nice too. The only thing I didn't like was table clothes. They are actually very beautiful piece but I don't think they change after every customer. That could be a hygiene problem. We started with red lentil soup, which was good. Then continue with sarma, also was good. We tried spinach gozleme and liked that too. My wife ordered inegol kofte for entree. That was so dry. I ordered beef saj kavurma, this was good. Ayran was incredible. We has revani for dessert, was okay. Even there are a few flaws, this restaurant deserves 5 stars. Overall, I enjoyed the food and was happy with service."}
{"text":"The Sadj and filet mignon were so delicious!! Fresh bread! Free tea! Spices I've never tasted before. And the service was rather fine too. :)"}
{"text":"Great Turkish food. The flat bread is extremely delicious and when you get it piping hot from flat top it is extraordinary.   Food can awhile so order drinks.  I found the hummus to be the only low point on their menu. It is perhaps because they use canned chick peas rather than fresh ones.   However everything else is extremely delicious. Try the dumplings they are great."}
{"text":"Avesta is one of the best Turkish restaurants I have been to outside of Turkey. The food tastes authentic (which is hard to achieve) and the kitchen and restaurant is clean.  I would highly recommend their Manti, Gozleme, Boreks and desserts."}
{"text":"Delicious Turkish food, in specious traditional decorate . Clean and have multiple choices .try Saj and boreks ."}
{"text":"Very good Turkish food.  Service was a little spotty, but the food was worth it.  The bread was home made by the owner in the front of the restaurant.  It was thin and fresh and hot.  We would consider Avesta a favorite if we lived in Montreal."}
{"text":"My review of Avesta is partially based on how good the resto USED to be under the original owner/management. We starting going there about 7 or 8 yrs ago when it was new and it really was something of a delight! Even my Turkish friends loved going there, not just to hang out but to actually eat, because the food was so tasty. The service was wonderful, warm and attentive, the place was clean and bustling, with great Turkish music. The lady making the lavash at the front was there (the only awesome person left today at that place) and it seemed to be a family operation. We used to enjoy all the dishes, manti, saj kavourma, menemen, etc ( meat dumpling dish, dish with cubed lamb and veggies,and a dish with eggs and peppers and some meat). We were always given fresh bread as soon as we sat down. The prices were incredibly fair as well. Fast forward a few years, our Turkish friends stopped going and we were told that the original owner had sold his place to a female employee who worked there as a server. I can't be absolutely sure that's what happened, but it makes sense because that employee has stayed on and to be honest, she has never been very friendly or customer oriented. Last few times we went, we had to beg for bread after being told that it is not automatically offered anymore and is only given depending on what plate you order. On top of that, once when we ordered a special that came with coffee or tea at the end of the meal, that same unfriendly lady said she didn't have regular coffee anymore and that she would replace it with a cappuccino. We agreed and nothing more was said until we got to the cash and saw something like an extra $4 on each of our bills. When we asked, she told us it was for the cappucinos. She had the audacity to try and charge us and then when we insisted that we would not have ordered the drinks had we been told of the extra fee, she still was grumbling and didn't immediately remove the charge. Eventually, we won our point, but one thing that always ticks me off is the sense of being nickle and dimed and owners acting like they are doing paying customers a favor by serving and dealing with them. The place also no longer looks very clean and had a musty odor last time we went. Service is scattered and takes too long for this type of place. Lastly, the food now ranks as just OK in my opinion, but a lot of it (especially the specials of the day) are items that any person who knows the basics of cooking can make. The meat is tough and too chewy. I also saw an Asian lady cooking in the kitchen last time, which is not to say she isn't capable of cooking Turkish food, but there is a clear difference in skill and taste when comparing the old Avesta to its current form. It is still a cheaper outing, but with several new spots opening in the area and with Adonis and Sparta Grill not too far away, there is no real reason for me to go back apart from seeing the smiling lavash lady!"}
{"text":"I have passed by this resto so many times. Always enjoyed looking at the lady who is always rolling the dough so thin. Today, finally, I came to eat lunch with my sisters. We were welcomed with big smile. Our server was really sweet and helpful. Our food was outmost delicious. The wait for the food was a bit too long, since it was one server. The decor is very beautiful and vibrant. Turkish background music was delightful but got interrupted by a bang by the rolling dough lady when she dropped some pots; she killed the vibe a bit. Overall, recommended!"}
{"text":"A nice date night restaurant. The décor and mood lighting give off the perfect vibe.  Ordered the The gozleme with beef and pasley, that tasted kind of like a pratha and tourtiere, and the spinach and feta one, that tasted like spinach in flaky flatbread. It was so so good!   Service is a bit slow but the food is definitely worth it! Prices vary depending on what you order. They have some lunch specials which are cheap."}
{"text":"Good food, good service, really nice atmosphere. Good selection of dishes, without overwhelming you with too many choices. This is the place you come to for homely dishes, yet unfortunately there is no wow factor. It's a very quite restaurant, with an intimate feel to it. I might be back."}
{"text":"Turkish place where the lavash is made by hand by a woman at the front of the restaurant.  Friendly service."}
{"text":"PROS: 1. The food was pretty darn delicious. We got the mezzes (hummus and yogurt with cucumber-yum!!) and I had the Iskender as an entree. Really delicious!! The manti (little dumpling dish) is good too but I thought the Iskender was better.   2. They have a lunch special: Soup, Entree, Dessert, Turkish Tea for $12.99, steal!!  3. The tortillas (i know there's a turkish word for that, but i fail to remember it, my bad) that go with the mezzes are made fresh off the grill the lady uses in the window!   4. I like the casual turkish carpet decor and the cafe style. However, the menu does need a facelift.   CONS: 1. No A/CCCCC or windows, making it a stuffy place for a summer lunch/din.  OVERALL: -I would recommend this place. -I think gettting 4 mezzes would suffice as a meal in itself and you get to try more things! -Lunch deal is a steal people!!"}
{"text":"This place is perfection. The decor, turkish music, the kind staff and the delicious food is all on point. It is my go to place when I'm on St. Catherine and looking for a filling meal. Their kebabs are to die for! The seasoning is great and the rice is especially full of flavor. The chicken is also tasty. I especially enjoy having a spot of their tea after the big meal. The menu is affordable and service is great. Be sure to look around the restaurant at the beautiful photographs and paintings. It just adds to this calming atmosphere."}
{"text":"Juste pour la nourriture, j'aurais sans doute donner 4 étoiles! Nous avons partagé un mezze en entrée et chacune des quatre variétés choisies était une réussiteen en particulier le \"muhammara\". Mais la véritable découverte pour moi était les manti en plat principal, un délice!  Avesto est un restaurant turc abordable et convivial. Nous l'avons d'abord remarqué par la dame qui prépare le pain lavash en vitrine, ce qui n'est pas habituel!  Mais alors, pourquoi ne donner que trois étoiles? L'organisation! Ici, je voyais à quel point le personnel est désorganisé, ne sachant pas quel plat est destiné à quel table, encore moins à quel convive. Cela à certainement un rapport avec la lenteur du service. Pas trop grave si on est pas pressé et qu'on mange avec l'amour de sa vie, mais peut-être moins dans d'autres situations. Je ne pouvais m'empêcher d'imaginer le chef Ramsay et les commentaires qu'il ferait au personnel! En plus, je sais que ce n'est pas de leur faute, mais quand même, il y avait des travaux de construction à l'étage et j'avais l'impression que le plafond allait céder d'un instant à l'autre!"}
{"text":"I passed in front of this restaurant for years, and always wanted to try it out. I loved watching the ladies preparing the dough and making the pita at the window. Finally got to try this place out and it is actually my first time trying Turkish food.  The interior decor is cosy because of its warm color scheme. There was only one waitress but the restaurant is not super busy anyways. The menu is well explained, and they even have pictures reference on the last page for people who are not familiar with Turkish food like me.   I ordered the borek in beef and pasley for appetizer, menemen, and gozleme with beef and pasley.  - The borek in beef and pasley was really tasty. I thought the crust was going to be flaky but it is actually soft.  - The menemen is actually similar to a typical Chinese dish, but it tastes a lot more sour and the persley adds more flavor. It comes with pieces of thin pita that are freshly made (the lady sat by the window and made the pita for us right after we ordered). The pita is super thin and soft. - The gozleme with beef and pasley tastes similar to the borek, the only difference is that the appetizer got a thicker crust. The gozleme also comes with a small salad. The dressing was really special: it was yogourt mixed with spices that tastes a bit like pesto. Super tasty in overall. We even got Turkish tea at the end and I wish I could add milk in it, I am sure it would have tasted great.  It was not super pricey, the food was tasty. I will definitively come back! Their sandwiches look great too."}
{"text":"Pas déçu et non agréablement surpris! La femme qui fait son propre pain nous a incités a rentrer par contre les plat étaient soit trop acide ou trop fades. Je ne suis pas une fan de nourriture Turc alors.."}
{"text":"The service was terrible. I order Hamous for appetizer and it was the worst Hamous I've ever had in my life. For the main course I ordered kabab and it was cold and not tasty at all. My wife ordered Gozlama and Again it tasted like crap."}
{"text":"The beyti kebab was just awesome - the meat was succulent and the bread was just perfect. The dessert was heavenly- worth the extra wait that the waitress warned us about."}
{"text":"We ordered the Beyti Kebab, it had Lamb and Beef Kebab Skewers wrapped around their house bread, topped with a tomato sauce. The meal came with rice, grilled vegetables and a house salad.   The food was excellent. We have been to Turkey several times and found the food here to be very authentic tasting.   Service was very good as well. Overall had a great experience!! Definitely coming here again soon!"}
{"text":"I'm not one who eats at sit down resto's regularly other then fast food joints but I tried it out anyways. The service was great, the meals were sooo good and the waitress who served me the 3 times I ate there was very polite and sweet. I don't know Turkish food but I know what I had there hit the spot. If your near Atwater I highly recommend this place. Also the waitress who served me has very intense eye's, I feel like she had cast a spell on me. I think she went too hogwarts."}
{"text":"This is very authentic Turkish place but ti was too expensive for me.  I was here a couple months back and was drawn to dine here because of the old ladies making fresh flat bread. The portion was too small for three guys from New Jersey. But, the food was very good."}
{"text":"This is a beautiful little restaurant on Rue St. Catherine. My friend recommended this restaurant and I thought I'd take my girlfriend there to try Turkish cuisine. I was surprised how good the food was for the price we were paying. It's a different in a great way. The decor and atmosphere was cozy and romantic.   We had 'Sarma' (vine leaf with rice and beef stuffing) for appetizer. I had the Urfa Kebab for main and my girlfriend had Menemen (Omelette/ tomato soup). Everything had very interesting and delicious flavoring that I was not expecting. Especially for me, the rice on the kebab dish was very special. My girlfriend especially liked the vine leaf and the yogurt sauce that it came with.   Lastly I have to mention the service. The lady who served us was very kindly and attentive. She served us Turkish tea and dessert on the house for our tasting. It was a very nice touch."}
{"text":"Having travelled to Turkey a couple of times, I have come to know the local food quite well. I have to admit this is one of the most authentic Turkish food I have found Outside of Turkey!! I cant believe I only just found it having been downtown so many times. I absolutely loved everything about it - from the interior (and exterior where you can see traditional bread being made) to the impeccable service and quality of food. I found the food very fresh and beautifully presented. We ordered a few starters, different kabab main courses and kunefe for dessert. The kunefe is to die for, it just melts in your mouth!! And to top it all off, the highlight was the complimentary Turkish tea which took me back to my days travelling in Turkey. We were there for hours as the cosy atmosphere feels like home and doesnt allow you to leave.  If I have to be super critical however, I found the portion sizes quite small so bear that in mind. And also - no ketchup!! :(  Other than that, I cannot wait to go back as it truly was a winner for me!!"}
{"text":"A very good Turkish restaurant. The meats are always amazing there.  Food is always good and service is always good.  I highly recommended this restaurant."}
{"text":"I've been passing by this place for a couple of years always tempted by the lady making fresh bread through the window. Built up excitement led me to slight disappointment. Bread wasn't so great. The appetizer portions are really small, the 3 appetizer option is an even smaller quantity, wouldn't suggest it. The main meal portions are better.   We ordered: the dumplings; basically a lot of small sized dumplings covered in lots of garlic yogurt sauce.  The lahmujin; that was good.  The salep; was too thick & sweet. 2 cups of tea   Paid about $54 for all the above.   The food was decent, ambiance okay..."}
{"text":"First visit after passing by several times and watched the lady preparing breads in the front of the restaurant. Tried the Inegol Kofte ( a kind of meatballs) the taste was awesome. The rice was spot on and the vegetables were really good, not boring salad at all.  I want to return to try another Persian specialties.  The staff is nice, service was good."}
{"text":"We had the lamb Sadj. It was great with the fresh flat bread made on site. Definitely worth a stop."}
{"text":"Not horrible, but not great either. Slow and inattentive service. Mediocre food. Small portions. Good beer selection and good desserts."}
{"text":"?élicieux savoureux super bon . J ai adoré. Je recommande ce resto au milles et une epices"}
{"text":"Je suis souvent passée devant ce restaurant avec la ferme intention de l'essayer un jour. C'est la dame qui fait du pain lavash à la main devant la vitrine rue Sainte-Catherine qui a attirée mon attention. Je ne connais aucun restaurant qui fait cela ici, à Montréal!  Venue pour la Saint-Valentin avec l'amour de ma vie, c'était rempli de couples qui mangeaient paisiblement. L'ambiance est calme, relaxante. La décoration est simple: beaucoup de tapis et d'objets de Turquie sur les murs, les nappes sont très colorées. Le service est lent, mais les plats arrivent tous en même temps. On se sert et c'est convivial.  Pour deux personnes, je vous recommande d'essayer les mezzés en entrée (plusieurs choix végétariens et avec viandes) accompagnés de pain lavash frais et les manti (mini-raviolis dans une sauce au yogourt et au beurre pimenté). Terminez en beauté avec un café turc servi dans une superbe petite tasse avec des mini-loukoums à l'eau de rose.   Parfait quand on a envie d'exotisme et de changement et pas mal moins cher qu'un voyage!"}
{"text":"The food is tasty, the dessert too. The service is horrible and people are not professional (Many times) Very sorry for a place that could be good."}
{"text":"Great and relaxing dinner on a Tuesday night! Atmosphere was calming and warm. The food was delicious but the house salad was a different kind of taste, not bad but not great. The hummus and freshly cooked bread were SO GOOD!! I highly recommend that as an appetizer. I ordered the byoti lamb (I'm probably not spelling it right, but the menu has pictures so when you see mine then you can match it there) and the flavor was excellent! My wife order the manti (ravioli) and she said it grew on her. She wasn't a big fan at first because the flavor was so different but then she enjoyed it. Very yogurty and a different kind of ravioli. Service was quick and overall this restaurant was a solid choice for a night out!"}
{"text":"Manti wasn't bad! Worth going"}
{"text":"I have to say at first: my opinion on the great service is a bit biased by the fact that my good friend works there as a waitress. However, I would say that the food, although I did not try it all (yet) is amazing. It tasted a lot like the food I had in Istanbul last summer, thanks to the Turkish chef. I had the beef and parsley gozleme. I also really like the fact that we could watch the lady making the Turkish bread in front of the resto. The lady making the bread even invited one of the customer's children to show her how to make it. This created a very cozy and playful atmosphere that I liked in the restaurant.I would recommend this place to go with a group of friend or family, that way they can share the plates and taste a lot of different dishes."}
{"text":"Avesta serves Turkish delicacies. The ambience is so so but the food is good and reasonably priced. They make freah turkish breads and you can even wathc it while they are being made. Do order the turkish coffee or tea at the end. I really like the way it is served.  The service is good. I go there for causal dinings, though if it had a little more luxurious ambience, I would make it my favorite business dining place too!"}
{"text":"The freshly made flatbread (lavash) makes this place great.  Although they have reduced the number of mezze they offer, there are still several choices.  The mezze portions are a bit too small... (hence 4 stars)  The other highlights are manti (meat dumplings in yoghurt sauce)  and the gozleme  (stuffed flatbread -- spinach and feta is best).  Pick the gozleme over the borek, as it's freshly prepared."}
{"text":"This might be the best Turkish restaurant ever.   First of all, when you come in there's a Turkish grandmother on display in the front window making food. Our server said that most of the time she's busy working on lavash bread. On our day she was making manti (a Turkish ravioli).  We ordered a sampler of three spreads. That appeared to be three full portions. The hummus may be the best I've ever had. One spread - the pine nut and pomegranate paste - was totally new to me. The other (eggplant/red pepper) was good but paled next to the others.  The husband thought his kofte wasn't as good as the place we go to in the San Francisco Bay Area. It came with rice, thinly sliced tomato, and green pepper salad.  I ordered a dish I've never seen before, the gozleme. Basically it was a stuffed flat bread that we got with \"smashed potatoes.\" It reminded me of Afghan bolani. It was nicely spiced and well, delicious.  The server brought us free tea. It might have been because I talked him up about the food and what dishes weren't available on Turkish menus in California. I asked if the food here was actually Kurdish. He said it was - and Turkish - as that was geographically the same area."}
{"text":"Food was amazing and service was superb.  I am sorry I don't live here so I could come back and try more dishes."}
{"text":"Easy to make reservation by phone. Table ready and quick service for a group of 10 persons. Very well seasoned and tasty meats and food. Most main course dishes in the $15-20 range (reasonable). Appetizers are quite expensive for their portion size ($6-10). Beautiful decor with colorful table cloths. Very friendly and efficient staff. Worth trying and easy to become a fan of."}
{"text":"Nice casual atmosphere. Wait staff were busy but apologetic helpful and friendly. The hummus was garlicky and fairly tasty.   For the main I had the Madja which was a beef tomato potato green pepper affair which was pretty good. Came with a larger than expected side of salad and rice on a separate plate. Rice was memorably good   Worth coming out to try something new. Many of the menu dishes are similar to Lebanese foods but likely has its own afghani twist."}
{"text":"Extremely bad food , if you never visited Turkey or if you are not Turkish and if you never tried authentic Turkish food then possibly you'll like this restaurant cuz it's different,different meaning when you see the lady behind the glass making the dough it looks authentic and makes you want to try . Nothing is fresh you should see the way they keep there appetizers in a small boxes in a dirty fridge nothing is fresh , they buy there food from other restaurants then  they reheat the food and serve, even the signature dish MANTI is made by some stranger at home we don't even know how clean it is, once they put the yogurt and the sauce you can't see what's in the bottom . What kind of Turkish restaurant don't serve you s authentic Turkish bread :)) Jnstead When I asked for bread omg they serve you a tortilla they just heat it up On the stove where the woman is sitting in the front and serve you,  in 2 minutes it becomes rock hard looooool. I might be wrong but probably the owners are not even Turkish well I know the original owner was but this one looks like Persian or  Azeri or something like that. I orderd a Lahmadjun it was disgusting you know why? Because they don't make it they buy it from these Lebanese place called Arush where they sell very bad Lahmadjun. Not Turkish style rather Lebanese style. At Avesta they heat  the frozen disgusting Lahmadjun who knows how many day old it is that put it on the Owen and give it to you like a dog food . Very very very bad restaurant i don't think they'll be in business too long , hopefully they'll sell the place to a real Turkish food expert . What about unfriendly slow none smiling tall girl in black looks like a witch Omg ."}
{"text":"I passed by this small but lovely restaurant for several times. Every time the ladies who prepare dough and pita at the window attract my attention. When I got inside, I feel an exotic ambiance with authentic decorations like colourful table cover. Types of dishes are quite rich. Pictures for different dishes helped me a lot to have an idea of turkish specialties. I ordered a appetizer mainly consisted of mashed eggplant. It was cold but it tasted very good with hot pita. For main dish, I took Gozleme in beef and parsely. It was really gooooood! My friend ordered a dish with kebab. The meat inside tasted so good! Another way of enjoying this dish was to put hot meat and cold cheese together in one bite! We also ordered turkish tea and I love it! After dinner, my friend had a turkish expresso, which tasted very special...In his word:\"It tastes like sand.\" I tried a little bit and it was too bitter for me. So, I won't recommend this only if you are curious and brave enough to taste something very special. The service was just normal, like all other small restaurant. It's not a Michelin three stars restaurant and also with a relatively low price, we shouldn't expect a lot on the service right?  In one word, this is a lovely restaurant with good Turkish food. I would like to go back one day."}
{"text":"Yelpers didn't let us down, as this was an excellent and more polished but still family-style restaurant that elevates itself from funky hole in the wall to special occasion place through a combination of excellent service and ambiance. We had a nice bonus - a seat where we could watch bread being prepared in the front window. The house specialty, the leg of lamb, was quite substantial and delicious, although it showed ever so slightly the effects of reheating after having been in a long stew. There are kebabs and turkish meat cakes for the less adventurous (like the kids) that were still unusual and quite tasty. The farina cake was unusual and delicious. And, they do have wine available, including in demi-litres, at decent prices.  The service did slow down when the customers started coming in later -- there seemed to be only one server -- so one probably should temper one's expectations if arriving later during the dinner hour."}
{"text":"Great little gem! The portions are reasonable, the food is very flavorful, and cheap! The service is very homely and efficient. The babaganus (as spelled on their menu) is superb! Pretty good coffee, and great tea. The baklava is delicious here as well. I cannot wait to go back, definitely a great place to check out!"}
{"text":"Nice decoration, good service, good dishes, i like tea presentation, raisonable price. The fresh bread is made front of everyone in the entracy."}
{"text":"Good authentic Turkish food. Safe bet!"}
{"text":"Une grosse arnaque. nouritures rechauffées au micro onde borek moue et mouillé. Portion de mez ridicule plat principale tiède et sans aucune saveur et pour cloturer le tout prix exorbitant (entrée et plat principale 35$). À éviter c'est des voleurs."}
