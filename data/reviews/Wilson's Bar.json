{"text":"The Best Sports Bar in town. Wilson's has, dollar for dollar, the city's greatest Friday night fish fry. Just don't tell anyone. A lot of people have caught on and Randy raised the prices lately! Albeit only slightly. If Mack is working behind the bar order a \"Mackdriver\" and say goodnight. Yes, the same Mack who ran Stillwaters for years. There truly are TVs everywhere including the restrooms, so this is the place to watch the big game.  A sports gambler's Mecca!"}
{"text":"Wilson's is your typical neighborhood bar.  I had the fish fry.  Three ($8) or five ($9.50) piece fried cod, basic fries, coleslaw and a roll.  Very decent for bar food.  They could do a better  job letting you know what's on tap.  I had a Spotted Cow but their are a few other good brews on tap and the basic beer.  The ceiling is very high so the loudness of the place is amplified.  Don't misunderstand, this is a great and very friendly place.  And it appears they are adhering to the smoking ban - which is great!"}
{"text":"My favorite neighborhood tavern!   Service is friendly and specials are great. Tons of tables and the greatest place to watch a game because there are tvs everywhere! Also, as you walk in you'll notice that they're open 365 days a year.   Their website posts a month's worth of daily specials including lasagna, baked chicken, prime rib, and more.  Food is good - I've had a few \"ok\" meals (that's the only reason I'm giving this place a 4)."}
{"text":"Wilson's is a comfortable pub with a casual, inviting atmosphere. Reasonable prices, tasty food and fine service are the hallmarks of this establishment. Randy, the owner, is a friendly, outgoing intelligent host who has the unique capability of working diligently while personally interacting with patrons. Other staff and family members also work with Randy and clearly enjoy a good relationship  with him. When you're at Wilson's, that pervasive feeling we all know but seldom experience of \"it's nice to be here\" sets in immediately. Expect to find an interesting cross section of ages, social orientations, occupations and personalities among the crowd.  Enjoy athletic events? This is your kind of place. Multiple television sets broadcast games and sporting news throughout the day. Want to down a couple while taking in a UW, Green Bay or Milwaukee game with a spirited, interactive group? Wilson's is where you'll find it.. \"Badgers 'n Breakfast at Wilson's\" is a slogan we think appropriate for  this unique and totally appealing establishment..     .  .   Please don't review this business if you received a freebie for writing this review, or if you're connected in any way to the owner or employees."}
{"text":"Dined here for lunch on a Friday. Love this place! Had the three piece fish fry. What a deal. Comes with delicious cole slaw, fries and a roll for $6. You can't beat that. And it was good! Love that they have table service and you don't have to order at the bar. Small menu but who needs more choices when everything on the menu is good, and it's a bar stupid!"}
{"text":"One liner...great neighborhood bar.   Super nice people and great food!  If you like huge burritos they have one for you!  Comfort food specials during the week.  Hard not to like Wilsons."}
{"text":"A Wilsons, what you see is what you get. A good, solid bar. Filled with tvs, this near eastside sports pub reflects the eclectic nature of the neighborhood...working class, graduate student, families...without the tired pretension you feel at the Harmony. The prices are good, the bartenders are friendly, and the food is decent. Want a burger and a beer? You can do much worse than Wilsons. New to Madison and want to catch your favorite team's games? NFL Sunday ticket, MLB game package and even Setanta Sports are available. Just as the 'tenders to tune the tv at your table to whichever channel you like. Plus, free popcorn all the time."}
{"text":"They have Karaoke on Friday nights.   Ordered a Capital Brewery Amber and it came to $4.50 for a bottle. Tried to use a credit card to pay but there's a $5 min.   The bartenders were sufficiently nice. Fits the quintessential neighborhood bar style."}
{"text":"Nicest bar staff in Madison. If you're from the neighborhood, they've got your drink ready before you even sit down. Awesome food, great karaoke on the weekends, and the pours are always generous. I don't look like your typical \"sports fan,\" but the staff is always warm and welcoming. Spend your money here. Go Pack Go."}
{"text":"I went to their Friday fish fry with family.  The fish was wonderful and reasonably priced.  The service however was very slow.  It took over an hour from the time we arrived to get our food.  The fish was the best part with fresh cod deep fried.  The fries and roll were nothing special, just typical bar food.  Their beer selection is good for WI beers and not as expensive as other places.  Go with the fish.  Madison has other better options for good bar/pub food."}
{"text":"The Best Sports Bar in Madtown. Randy has one of the best fish fry's in Madison. Breakfast... simple, big breakfast at a fair price that will definitely help you get over the wreckage from the previous evening.   If Mack is working behind the bar order a \"Mackdriver\".  There truly are TVs everywhere including the restrooms and outdoor smoking area.  This is a great place to watch Packer/Badger/ Brewer games...but get there early because it fills up and it's sometimes difficult to get a \"ringside\" seat."}
{"text":"I was home alone today and craving some fish for lunch. I decided to checkout Madisonfishfry.com to see what they recommended for lunch. And Wilson's Bar was \"Highly Recommended.\" I thought well let me check out the website first. I seen that they had a special on fish today $8.00 for 3 piece Cod with fries, Cole slaw and a role. Or $9.50 for 5 piece. I went in and it appeared to be a few older gentlemen conversing while watching the Cubs play the Giants. I ordered a Spotted Cow on tap and the 3 piece fish.   About 10 minutes later my food comes out and it's piping hot! Their was 3 decent size pieces of fish here with some awesome tartar sauce. I started in but had to wait a couple minutes as the food was so hot. The fish had a nice batter and stayed together well with only a little bit of flakiness, The fries were good and very potatoey. The Cole Slaw was pretty good too. My final bill was $11.50. I will be back, their is a surplus of tvs and the bartender is super friendly.   Plus this place has a cool neighborhood vibe going for it."}
{"text":"If I was going to open a sports bar, I would pay them to show me how to cook this menu.  It's great food, they turn it around quickly, and it's consistent. The bartenders are nice, the place is rarely empty, and they have dozens of TVs.  This is not a fine dining experience.  It is simply the best sports bar in Madison without driving to one of the malls."}
{"text":"If Wilsons doesn't have the best fish fry in Madiosn, they ae in the top 3! Great experience everytime we stop by Wilsons."}
{"text":"Poor food handling practices!!! I was really excited to try this place as the reviews were excellent. Major disappointment! We arrived just before noon and the place was really busy. They were still serving breakfast but we were interested in lunch. We asked our server to see what the lunch menu to see all our options and she seemed annoyed. We ordered a couple of beers and they were prompt but not really cold. While we waited about 30 minutes in order to be able to order lunch, we had a lot of time to observe things. I was appalled to see the filthy salt, pepper, ketchup, and mustard containers. They looked like they had never been washed. I also watched the bartenders clear dirty dishes off the bar, then dig their hands in the cherry jar. The last straw was watching the woman cooking touch a handful of raw hamburger patties and then immediately touch the buns on the grill. Last I checked, those practices could send someone to the hospital! We will not be going back!"}
{"text":"Horrible service the guy who took our order was an older bigger guy don't know his name but he was extremely rude and the food wasn't really that good. And the guy sets a dirty plate in front of us and leaves it there Avoid this place if possible there are plenty other bars to choose from. I will never be back"}
{"text":"I started going to Wilson's about 4 years ago with friends that were regulars.  And because I was there with regulars I thought I probably got a better service than I would normally.   Well, I way wrong.  I have been back more than once on my own and never have I been disappointed.  Gamedays can be crowded - particularly Packers and Badgers, but it's a great crowd with which to hang.  Beer prices are typically 50 cents lower than downtown or the west side of town.  It is a very local crowd typically when I am there. Ages vary anywhere from 25 to 55 years old (okay some older).  Every one is very nice too.  I was there on Friday night to watch college football.  The place was packed and the bartender and waitress were hopping, but the service was still great.  I ordered a cheeseburger and a bit to my surprise it was delicious.  Okay, so the shots are in a plastic cup, but that is probably best.  Definitely a go to place for sports.  I will have to try for a non sport Friday or Saturday night."}
{"text":"I am a fan of Wilson's Bar. Unfortunately the only time I go there due to location is when I am waiting for a haircut at Atwood Family Barbershop next door. Whether I have enough time for food, or just need a beer, they are good at both.   I have had a few different things off their menu including a burger and fries, chili, and breakfast. For bar food made on a small flat top right in front of the bar, it was pretty good.   They have a good selection of beer on tap and in bottles. The bar tenders are always helpful and the prices are extremely reasonable."}
{"text":"Wilson's Bar is one of my favorites for sports. Anything Wisconsin affiliated will bring in crowds of regulars and new patrons alike. Televisions are plenty, some tables even have their own ~25 inch TV mounted on the wall above the table - extra bonus!  The tap and bottle lists are fairly extensive with lots of Wisconsin microbrews to offer. Wilson's offer standard burgers and sandwiches with some nightly specials. The free popcorn in the back corner is addicting - and it's not oversalted like so many other places.  Pro tip: if you're going to watch a highly anticipated Wisconsin sporting event, get there early! Seats/tables are limited, and the place fills up incredibly fast."}
{"text":"Gosh...to write a negative review about a favored locale is almost a sin in Wisconsin lore.  I don't care!  The bartenders are the number one reason for such a negative review...it ain't the poor quality of food, it ain't  the smell,  nor the lack of ambiance (it is a sports bar, remember??).  And it ain't about the lack of patrons who actually give a F#$k how they spend their money at an establishment.  It is about the lack of customer SERVICE!!! I read over several reviews from years past and it seems I'm not the only one aware of a problem here.  I doubt these owners even use, read, or respond to Yelp.  But guess what? The consumer does! Save your time (and $$), buy a 6-pack of Bud  and watch the game on your own screen...at least you won't have to deal with cranky bartenders.  Oh yeah...another thing, their manager needs to tell the karaoke dj that it is about the customers that want to sing, not about him wanting to re-live his college dormroom dj career. Enough said...I'm out!"}
{"text":"I've been to Wilson's a few times ranging from Packer games to New Year's Eve, and I'm finally ready to rate it four stars since on my last trip, for the first time ever, it didn't smell like old, burning grease. I had a doubly enjoyable time when I wasn't fighting for fresh air and looking through a smoky haze.   Things I enjoy about Wilson's:  + TVs everywhere + Cheap drinks (a pitcher of Spotted Cow is $11) + A mix of karaoke and DJ on Saturday nights - you'll probably get to sing your song pretty quick / if there's something you'd rather just hear than sing, you're covered there, too + Nice staff  Fingers crossed the fresh air sticks around as it makes for a much better experience!"}
{"text":"Love this bar the best sports bar in Madison imo. TV everywhere including bathrooms  and even outside in their smoking area . Have pretty much every NFL game on at least 1 TV always willing to  try to find a game if asked. Staff very friendly definitely a family business most times  at least 1 bartender is a Wilson . Other bartenders Brian and Mack have seemingly been their forever. Decent selection of beers can find at least  a couple of most styles . Food is better than most bars very good burritos good breakfast on the weekends solid burgers. Used to get there much more often lived 2 blocks away but still an enjoyable evening out."}
{"text":"Nice low key place. I was half mesmerized by the presence of TVs all around the wall of the bar. So if you're a sports bar type of person, this is definitely a must-check-out for you.   The bar could use a few more bartenders - two guys splitting their time between making drinks and grilling the delicious food doesn't really work too well for a quick service.   That said, their food is delicious. We ordered cheese curds, onion rings, and chicken wings for appetizers. All of them came out hot and super crispy and just darn good greasy delicious. I ordered the reubin sandwich, which was also awesome as well."}
{"text":"This is a breakfast review.  If you want a simple, big breakfast at a modest price, this is a solid option.  In fact, a good place to have breakfast after a big night out.  If you need it to help your recovery, you can get a good bloody mary or just a screw drive with your breakfast.   Tons of great TVs."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood sports bar with lots of TVs tuned to every possible sporting event. Good selection of draft and bottled beers. The Friday Fish Fry and Saturday Prime Rib are really excellent and at a good price. Pool tables too."}
{"text":"Wilson's... 4 stars for what it is... a local sports bar.  There is always parking available, they recently upgraded all of their TV's to new flat screens, and the locals and staff are always welcoming.  The price is right for the food they have to offer, although you're basically only going to get something deep fried or grilled up.  Stick with the burger or grab the fish fry... the wings suck, but they basically always do in the Midwest (sorry, these are facts, just sayin').  The best time to go there is when a Packers, University of Wisconsin Badgers, or Brewers game is on... especially when they're winning.  In other news, there is Karaoke on Friday nights, and a couple of pool tables if you're interested."}
{"text":"Like the location and atmosphere.   Decent bar food.    Similar to another reviewer, terrible service, was rude and made us feel like he was doing us a favor."}
{"text":"How could I have not reviewed this bar yet? Doy. Well, besides the kind and sweet bartenders (Brian's awesome), they have great burgers, a crab leg special that's too good to pass up, and of course: beer and booze. If you are into sports, they have tons (I mean TONS, even TVs in the bathrooms and outside where you would smoke) of TVs to watch whatever 'the game' is on. Also, video trivia for free, and, oddly enough, one of the best wi-fi signals around! And, Snake Hollow on tap. Go say hello. If Mac is working, try a MacDriver, his signature drink. And, the fish fry is FABulous."}
{"text":"My boyfriend introduced me to Wilson's about a year ago. As a small town girl, this place reminds me of my hometown bars. We've typically come for a later breakfast and drinks, but I know it can be a popular spot to watch games as well. Definitely a local sports bar.   There is plenty of seating throughout the bar. Service has always been good and friendly, and we've been acknowledged quickly upon arriving by our server on all occasions.  Bloodies and drinks are good and the prices are right. If your looking for a fancy spot this is not it. If your trying to test out a relationship to see if your potential new girlfriend can hang out at local neighborhood bars, you should take her to Wilsons to see what she says."}
