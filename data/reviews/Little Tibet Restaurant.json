{"text":"my craving for steamed dumplings and soup were fulfilled at Little Tibet, me and www.myfolieadeux.com ordered the lunch special of 4 beef momos with spicy potato and salad with a side of tentuk soup... the window seating at 12:00 was just great for people watching and the option t purchase a jar f hotosauce on the way out was great.  the History of tibet is something i need to look into more, but this little sliver of tibet in Toronto wet my tastebuds for more..  As Lonely Planet reported, \"Tibetan food is more about survival than pleasure.\"   http://www.myfolieadeux.com/2009/07/little-tibet-in-big-toronto.html"}
{"text":"sitting at the front, feeling part of the sweaty and every increasing lineup by the door was not the best seating arrangement for us, but we did manage to order some interesting food and have a relatively romantic time.  we started with some butter tea.  mmmm youd think, but as my bubbie loved to say at the smell of a fart lets say, \"feh\".  in my opinion salty tea that tastes like butter is not the right combo.  i hate to stain the face of an iconic tibetan drink but hey, prove to me that i got the lemon of the bunch and im all for it.  the first dish to arrive was a lentil soup that was very tasty.  after that came the famous \"momos\".  these are very intricately shaped dumplings.  if you could be a little fly flying above them it might look like a gigantic bike wheel, spokes and all, but made of dough, that you, as the fly could barf on and then eat, and then barf up again and then...  well they didnt make me want to barf in the least.  they came with a very tangy sauce, and ours were filled with spinach and cheese.  i would have liked to try the meat or seafood versions, but it almost doesnt matter when there are dumplings of any origin on the table.  i did find them a bit doughy for my undivided liking, though.    as my main, i had a shrimp dish with veggies that was very juicy and mixed well with my rice.  the other dish i got which was unnecessary and not all that interesting was a type of specialty bread they make. it was like foccaccia on steroids and i tried to like it by dipping it in stuff but it was no great shakes.  i would come back again if i was in the area, but id just as soon expand my horizons and try other tibetan places as well."}
