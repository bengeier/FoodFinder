{"text":"Food was somewhat good lots to choose from but a friend of mine had a problem with her food and asked to have something done about it... the manager on duty wasn't will to give any comps or refunds...liked this as a first time but the service for my friend has pretty much destroyed any chance of us coming back or recommending to others..."}
{"text":"Quick tip -- I would save your dollars, and use it towards a better fresher, cooked to order meal at one of the casino's other restaurants.  Being spoiled by the food and numerous buffets in the greater San Francisco area, I found this casino buffet to be not all that great for the price I paid at dinner time.  For $26+ I kind of expected some crustaceans and perhaps sushi, but after thinking about the location, I do realize Arizona is not surrounded by any huge bodies of water, but then again, neither is Vegas and I do recall eating some decent seafood at Vegas buffets for a lot less.  For Asian international fair, they had panda express food.  For their pasta selection, it was pesto pasta (meatless, and probably could have found that at Soup Plantation) and cheese ravioli.  For the carving station, it was brisket and something else that didn't look too good to try.  Their skillet potatoes were mushy, there was no prime rib, the steaks shouldn't have even been a buffet choice since they don't do too well sitting around, and their salmon is awefully dry.  I found myself endulging on the desserts (lots of pudding pie in all different flavors), steamed veggies, and the mexican food that is not worth $26+.  I actually thoroughly enjoyed my Famous Daves meal like 5 times more than this joint, during my stay here in Arizona."}
{"text":"Went for lunch today. We looked before we bought and it did look better than it tasted. I don't think we'll return, but will try other dining options in the casino."}
{"text":"Wonderful buffet! Chinese, Mexican & western fair! Soups, salads and appetizers galore. Pepper crusted roast beef that is out of this world... Let's not forget the desert bar...... Yummmmm! We had a great meal and a lot of fun!!!"}
{"text":"Went for the lunch buffet. The selection was mostly mexican and chinese along with pizza and sundry meats. the dishes were okay. For a price of $30 for two people, I have had better meals. Yes, there were a lot of choices but the quality was not great. nothing stood out for me. did not even feel like trying the desserts as nothing seemed appealing."}
{"text":"Great customer service, loved seeing the chef at the Desert station, helping customers. Everyone was so helpful. Had a waiter by the name of Ralph that was amazing! Food was Amazing!!! Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I'm not going to be long winded on this one. My wife and I went for a Saturday Night Dinner Buffet and it didn't disappoint. Nutshell? It was exactly like the Sunday Brunch without the Eggs and Pancakes. Delicious Seafood and meat selections. King Crab Legs were great, Lobster claws hit the spot! Beware of the Crab Legs Frenzy! Apparently the idea of All You Can Eat Crab Legs turns people into crazed Zombies as they will become insane when the platters come out!  Get here early. At 430-5 there was a short line, by 6 it was insane! I can only imagine people waited probably an hour or more to get in there."}
{"text":"Exceptionally good. Our server was very attentive and friendly. We saw listed \"Calzones to order\", which  I stay clear of pizza on a buffet but my husband ordered one.  All I can say is  delicious (keep in mind you must wait for it to cook). The tortellini is to die for too. You have so many choices on this buffet. Excellent!"}
{"text":"I'm from Reno so in comparison to the buffets there, this one is lacking. The selection of foods is very small and poorly maintained. They were out of several dishes the first time I went through the line and didn't stock appropriate dishes next to some of the stations, i.e. soup bowls, small cups for dipping sauces, dinner plates, etc. Food quality was just ok. I probably wouldn't come again."}
{"text":"There was a little piece  of white plastic in my salted caramel ice cream which is probably fell from the ice cream scoop,I thought it was a sea salt so I bite it and tiny pieces of plastics shattered  in my mouth,took them out (hopefully I didn't swallow any but I'm not sure) showed the dessert server lady who almost didn't say anything except ok when I suggested her to check her ice cream,all I wanted was apology,I know mistakes happen,especially during this holiday time the restaurants can be pretty busy and hard to keep everything perfect but come on,just one word would've make me leave happy"}
{"text":"Waiting..........waiting........waiting.........waiting The Choice of food is excellent but there are some real drawbacks  1) Waiting- There are so many ways to let patrons know that they have 20-30 minute wait  2) Staff and Service  2 out of 5 - Not attentive / Missed Order  3) DARK - There are caves with more light - Why does a buffet need to be so dark"}
{"text":"The buffet selections are on par with the Wynn's in Las Vegas or any other casino resort. But what sets this spot apart is their customer service and attention to details. I felt really cater and attend to throughout my dinning experience. The staffs at the buffet seems like they got it down. Five stars for that. Definitely be back when I'm in town again."}
{"text":"Everything was delicious!!! The primerib was to die for!! I needed a bigger stomach. The waiter was johnny on the spot for everything! Everything tasted so fresh. It was better than most buffet's I've been to in vegas and just about one of the best one's I've ever been to. Don't pass up!"}
{"text":"This review is for the breakfast buffet.  Pro:  value, variety, views  Con: smokers and gamblers you encounter en route.  low class.  Wuddya expect, it's a friggin' casino.   Even so, it certainly does the trick for a cheap \"I could eat a horse but I'm broke\" breakfast call.  You name it,  they probably offer it:  Mexican, American, Chinese,  even gelato, and a very decent fresh fruit offering.  Servers have always been friendly on my visits.   Surprisingly good for kids and the $1 keno games are a nice side bar.  It's what I'd imagine a low budget cruise ship buffet to be.  I'm at 2.5 stars on this place; a definite \"meh\"."}
{"text":"Very unimpressed with this buffet. When the queue wrapped around the casino (along with the $55 price tag for the Mother's Day special), we were anticipating great food. After doing a quick walk around the buffet to check out the options, we could already tell that we were not pleased with the limited variety of options. There were numerous meat dishes but not much else.  As a meat lover, I was excited to indulge, and I'm not picky at all when it comes to meat dishes. But of the prime rib, beef steak, lamb chops, and crab legs, only the lamb chops were edible. I never leave meat unfinished, but I couldn't bring myself to finish the rubbery rib and completely bland steak. The crab legs felt like they had been laying in the freezer for weeks. Fresh king crab legs were the major selling point for even coming to this buffet, and this was a major disappointment. As for the desserts, the raspberry mousse was bitter and lacked any sweetness. The cheesecake was lacking, and I could have bought better at Albertson's. The nutella pancake was actually decent. As were the breakfast potatoes and hash brown. The one major upside to the brunch was the delicious bloody mary's included. Overall we were very disappointed with our overall experience at this buffet. There are $13 buffets that are far more satisfying than this one. Would never recommend this place to a friend. Maybe the high volume of customers for Mother's Day led to the subpar quality of food, but this did not meet any of our expectations whatsoever. With the tip we spent over $150 dollars for two people, which would have been better spent at numerous other upscale restaurants."}
{"text":"Have been to the buffet twice for dinner and every time i leave totally satisfied with everything that is offered. I actually wish i could fit more in my stomach. The chefs do a wonderful job and have a exceptional variety from around the globe. Service is also top notch and pleasant. Cant wait to go back."}
{"text":"I\"ve eaten here many times and it is always very tasty food.  It is hard to find something that doesn't fit the palate here. You don't get the glitz and shine that is everywhere in the Las Vegas hotels, but for pure taste and culinary satisfaction, you can't beat the Wandering Horse Buffet.  It ranks up there with best of what Las Vegas offers without the travel.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"We ate here on a Friday night. Food was ok, everything was just ok. The lobster claws and crab legs were good. They are cold, so if you are a fan of hot lobster you can have them reheat them, the crab legs are split in half (bonus) but you can't really reheat those. The Kobe beef was good, but small pieces. I think the brunch is must better than the dinner. The deserts seemed to be of the high end premade frozen type. The staff behind the buffet appeared to be upset when they had to replenish  the food. Oh we'll, we won't be back for dinner, but probably for breakfast."}
{"text":"Lunch  While staying at the resort, I was not especially hungry, but really did not want to eat a bunch of junk. I went to the Wandering Horse buffet.  Price $12.95 plus tax.  I had smoked salmon, antipasta, salad, fruit, and then prime rib, roast pork, a few calamari and shrimp, more salad, and called it a day.  I could have had smoked salmon and prime rib all day but that would be really living it up, and I would have felt that I over ate at lunch. The thought did cross my mind.  At In-And-Out burgers, #1 is $ 5.50, so this was definitely 3 times better than a # 1.  If you are around here, really go to the buffet."}
{"text":"This review is for the breakfast buffet, which I believe opens at 8AM. I arrived at 8:30 AM and was promptly seated (this was a Saturday morning) the very large banquet room was very empty, but I was starving, so I didn't care. The waitperson was very attentive, I must say her service was excellent. My concerns... #1 my biggest concern was at 8:30 AM (remember they open at *) the carving station, although all lit up had only a bone with no meat and a carving knife on display. During the course of my leisurely brunch (8:30 AM to 11:30 AM) the scene never changed. RIPOFF!!!! There was supposed to be ham or beef available at the carving station. The rest of the buffet is pretty standard fare, BUT... the bacon was somehow greasy and underdone while at the same time stuck together in a greasy clump. The link sausages were greasy and semi raw! I'm sorry, but the \"cook\" in charge of this dismal small buffet should be canned. I'm not upset that it is a limited buffet ( they don't even have scrambled eggs), I'm upset that with minimal offerings, the \"cook\" should make the buffet shine. 5 stars to the egg station! They are the only reason that there are two stars instead of one."}
{"text":"The Wandering Horse is a really well done buffet that I have found to be consistently clean with an very good selection of fresh items and friendly if occasionally spotty table service. The buffet offers a standard blend of the tried and true steak, prime rib, salad bar combo with a nice blend of Mexican, Italian, Asian selections as well.  I've eaten here at least 15 times since they opened, entertaining in-laws, business associates, and friends for lunch, dinner, and brunch having never left hungry or disappointed in anything save for the soups. Service has gotten consistently better and the food has stayed very consistently good. I would love to give five stars but on numerous occasions the soups have been under-seasoned and terribly bland."}
{"text":"Wow what a horrible experience. Went Sunday night and asked for a table for 6. 3 couples all paid separately but 18% tip tacked on all bills. Waiter was horrendous. We finally had to go to server area and get our own pitcher of tea and then again for water. Waiter never noticed. He was clueless. I guess since he had his tip of 21.00 for table he didn't care. Buffet was so so. Not a lot of taste. With the prices we paid should have been better. Salad bar was a joke. Deserts were really good! Would not eat here again."}
{"text":"I've came here for Saturday lunches a few times and I believe it's worth the $. The food that's put out is always fresh."}
{"text":"For Scottsdale, this buffet is just as good as a Vegas buffet!! and their pool parties have just as many pretty people in them! Talking Stick Casino overall is very good and clean!!"}
{"text":"Christmas buffet here is yummy ~ come with an appetite and good friends and family. I've also been to the spa- the facials are amazing"}
{"text":"The Wandering Horse Buffet at Talking Stick is quite nice. It's well set up with many large booths and tables. One entire side of the restaurant is all windows offering a bright atmosphere (in an otherwise dark casino) and a nice view of the mountains. For $26.95, you can't go wrong. I tried a fraction of what they offer but what I did have was quite good.  There is a large and quite varied selection of food. Included was an Asian section, Mexican section, Italian section, fresh crab legs, oysters, shrimp and many different options of meat at the carving station. If you are a non red meat eater, there was salmon and chicken. There's quite a nice selection of potatoes; mashed, hash browns and country style. Also included was a salad bar, a selection of soups, fresh vegetables, waffles, pancakes and made to order omelets. The desserts included cakes, mousses, tarts, pies, gelato, crepes as well as other pastry items. My favorite was the jalapeño bacon, probably the best bacon I've ever had. I'm sure I'm forgetting something but no matter your palate, you will definitely find something.  As with most casinos, the clientele can be interesting and Talking Stick is no exception. There was a varied group of people which always makes for good people watching. Is the buffet on par with The Phoenician, no. Is it better than most buffets, definitely yes. Would I go back? Yes!"}
{"text":"Overall,  good buffet selection.  Went there on Valentine's day craving for some seafood buffet.  They served complimentary champagne and unlimited lobster claws that night. The line was long but it was  worth the wait.  Asian dishes could be improved, I think."}
{"text":"This review is for the lunch buffet.  Been here a bunch of times for lunch, and although its gone up slightly, its still worth the $14.  There is a great variety including plenty of seafood dishes.  The steaks, the shrimp fajitas, the chinese selections, the artisan cheeses, the pizza & pasta, the fish & chips, the salads, the smoked salmon, the soups, and even the sugar free cheesecake are all very good.  A little different than the typical buffet, the food is served in smaller portions on the buffet.  So most choices seem pretty fresh.  Its a nice, spacious room with great views.  And far enough seperated from the casino so that you don't smell the smoke or hear any of the noise.  Not that there's anything wrong with that :)  We've had great service on each visit as well.  I can't speak to the dinner or brunch buffets, but based on the lunch selection and quality, I'm sure the rest is very good.  Will have to try the dinner soon.  Work up a hunger... settle in... and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Went to the buffet for both breakfast and dinner. Breakfast was Good for 12 dollars, a lot of options with refresh fruits and gelato. Their Friday dinner buffet was really awesome. For 33 dollars you are getting king crab legs, stone crabs, oyster and so much more. It was great for a seafood lover like me. They have a lot of dessert selection as well including sugar free and gluten free choices. Definitely worth a visit. Come early at dinner. People start to line up before the dinner starts."}
{"text":"little to no seasoning/flavor on any of the dishes at lunch today. Of the hot dishes, the majority appeared dried out. Nothing really stood out as great..."}
{"text":"Well done Cindy and Ana. I forgot to take a picture of pizza,they made it very special and cheesy.I love it so much and its delicious too. By the way, everything in there taste good..."}
{"text":"This past Saturday night I convinced my husband to go out & have dinner at a buffet. I have been wanting to go to Wandering Horse for a while now, so we made the trek out to Scottsdale. The last time we were here it was in the tents, so it was all new to us. The remodel is beautiful! Wish we could have checked out the rooms.  We also met his cousin & our friend there. We were seated right away & went right to the buffet. As soon as we got back to the table our sweet server took our drink orders. She checked on us a few times & made sure empty glasses were refilled.  There was so much freakin food! This has definitely got to be the best buffet in AZ. Some of my fav items were: fried shrimp, salmon, kobe beef, broccolini, shrimp scampi, bread with pesto spread & cheese, roasted corn on the cob, mashed potatoes, mussels, fried rice, pizza, pork eggrolls-I'm sure there's more but you get the idea. Dessert was pretty good as well. Some fav items there were: mint chocolate chip gelato, fruit tarts, creme brulee, some strawberry/white cake creation & the boys fav-a crepe with warm nutella!  At 1st, I was going to dock a star for the $27 per person price tag, but it was just so good I had to give it 5 stars. I'd love to come back on a Sunday for brunch & take full advantage of the endless mimosas!"}
{"text":"Good service, decent price, nice selection but the Oysters had gone very...VERY BAD. Once I took a bite I immediately spit it out and wiped my tongue with napkins. I had to suck on couple of lemons to get the bad taste and smell out of my mouth. Selection doesn't count when the items are inedible. Never again. Disappointed."}
{"text":"The deserts were old tasting and not very big of a selection for food. The drinks are expensive and barely, if any, liquor in them."}
{"text":"Really bad buffet even for a casino buffet. Tried many of the choices and all were bland. Cheesecake was actually stale. Try one of the other restaurants. This was major disappointment."}
{"text":"We tried the lunch buffet on a Thursday.  I had heard good things about it and it was even better than I expected.  Very good selection including beef and fish dishes, pizza and pasta.  Desserts were varied and quite good.  The wait staff was attentive and we had a very nice view of the mountains.  The price, which included a beverage,  was not much more than Old Country Buffet but infinitely better.  We will return."}
{"text":"First time in the area, first time in this Buffett. The steak is beyond delish. Mashed potatoes and gravy hit the spot. Iced tea was refreshing. Atmosphere is nice, casual. Employees are very helpful. Give koodos to Angelo for helping us find directions to the fast track. He even took the time to write down the directions for us. His suggestion and going out of his way for customer satisfaction. Angelo represented the company well. Thank you."}
{"text":"***********If you don't appreciate......\"The Best of The Best\"........ stay away**************   Wandering Horse has always provided a TEN STAR dinning expierence. The food is Fanstatic. The service is beyond OUTSTANDING.  I've been going there, since they opened.  Wandering Horse you're ...... \"a Class Act\"."}
{"text":"They always have a wide variety to choose from. Pizza to pasta, salad to cheese and crackers, Chinese fried rice to quesadillas, steak to mashes potatoes. Not to mention a wide selection of desserts."}
{"text":"Excellent Mother's Day brunch! Great selection, and very attentive staff. We sat for hours visiting and never felt rushed to leave so they could have our table. Well worth the price!!"}
{"text":"We were super excited about trying this buffet.  We were in town visiting and after a long day doing the Apache Trails we wanted to really stuff our faces.  We got there just before 6, there was a line of maybe 8 parties ahead of us but the line moved quickly.  For 2 adults dinner on a Saturday it came to a total of $73.30 including tax.  Not much cheaper than going to the Caesar's Buffet in Vegas.  We were promptly seated.  Our servers were really good, very friendly, prompt, always refilling our glasses.  Now in terms of the food, we were a little let down.  We tried everything from the stations and everything was pretty average.  Everyone goes crazy over the crab legs but even they tasted really bland.  We were so excited for the desserts, they have a huge selection but again they looked better than they tasted.  I think we'll stick to Caesar's from now on."}
{"text":"I went here with the expectation that it would like your run of the mill Vegas buffet, but I was wrong. It was sooo much worse. This place is definitely those looking for quantity over quality.   We went for \"seafood night.\" This consists of badly tasting lobster claws, gross oysters, mediocre crab legs, etc. I was extremely disappointed in the seafood selection especially knowing that all of the other restaurants in this casino have amazing seafood.   All of the other food choices were mediocre at best.  The deserts were not very good either. Even though there was a big selection I couldn't find a single one I liked. Meanwhile, I was with a diabetic who only picked the \"sugar free\" options. ***WARNING*** they are NOT sugar free. His blood sugar spiked as soon as he left. A very scary thing to mislabel.   Overall, not an enjoyable experience and will not be back."}
{"text":"I really like coming here for lunch on Sat or throughout the week! It's decently priced for lunch and the food is pretty consistently good! I also love their hot green jasmine tea--delicious!!"}
{"text":"You dont get a better buffet than this.  Been to vegas and atlantic city buffets, and this rivals them.  Great service, excellent food.  Best in arizona."}
{"text":"We stayed for 5 nights at the Talking Stick Resort on vacation. This buffet restaurant has an extensive display of international foods. We ate here three times for breakfast and it was quite delicious. For breakfast there is an omelet station, extensive granola/musueli choices, yogurt, pastries, various meats including peppered bacon that was sliced to order. Eggs were cooked well and the biscuits with gravy was one of my favorites. One day the gravy had a chopped corned beef and another day it was regular sausage-type gravy...both were delicious. We also had a donut each morning.Yeah, I know it wasn't on my diet...but hey, I was on vacation. The variety of fresh fruit was impressive...juicy, plump blackberries, strawberries, blueberries, fresh pineapple. Ummmm....My mouth is watering just thinking about it.   We ate once in the Wandering Horse for lunch. It was good, but not quite as tasty as the breakfast, but definitely can find something you like. The fried shrimp were plump, good seasoning and great breading. There was Mexican, Asian, American and pizza stations. The salad bar was really good and they had about 14 different flavors of ice creams, gelatos and sorbet. The sorbets and gelatos were actually more delicious than the ice cream. Definitely worth a trip for the reasonable breakfast price of $9.95 and lunch of $12.95."}
{"text":"A lot of choices, but nothing stood out as a must have.  The desserts were very good, but everything else was just ordinary.  Bring your wallet if you plan on drinking alcohol.  I guess the Tribe has to pay for that beautiful new building somehow.  Drinks way overpriced."}
{"text":"If you're staying at the Talking Stick Resort, this is a very convenient way to have a relaxed meal and you should be able to find some foods you really like. I noticed a selection of olives, fresh mozarella and tomato and picked up a serving. There was a carving station serving fresh pork, and I also got some shrimp.  For dessert, there was a wide selection of gelatos with an assortment of toppings like shredded coconut, Oreo cookies and m&ms.  Naturally there were numerous other choices, these were my picks. The staff were friendly and attentive.  Overall it was a great value, the pricing was really fair. There is also a large bar if you want cocktails.  One thing to think about is tipping - I tipped when I checked in at the front desk, but probably should have waited to tip the server directly. I ended up tipping a second time because the waitress gave good service and I did not want to leave her empty handed."}
{"text":"It' was first time at Wandering Horse Buffet. The Dinner buffet Hours 4:30 - 10:00PM , I was directed to dinner table about 8-30 PM , waiting on line for kingcrab legs 7 minutes (kingcrab legs had been frozen for long time (better got from Fry's or Costco); 3 minutes waiting for NY steak -(sorry we do not have anymore NY steak at 8:50 PM ), swing back on line for little neck clams 10 minutes waiting -(sorry , no more clams), complainted to Restaurant's Manager - (sorry , we do our best ).And then I went to Casino's Restroom before leaving this Resort , the  restroom was dirty liked Waltmart ' restroom .I have rather paying $15.00 at regular buffet restaurant , alot better then paying $36.65 at WDH Buffet when the foods was underrated ."}
{"text":"Not to be repetitious, but really nice buffet. No one's addressed the regular (non-Sunday) breakfast, but for $9.95 you get juice, coffee and food. Omelets, cheeses, bacon and thick cut applewood smoked if you want, smoked salmon (not little pieces, but a whole slab o' fish you slice off a piece yourself) and all those deserts (pastries, pies, cakes, etc.) including the sorbets. And then there are the non-US selections with Thai, Japanese and other cuisines represented. Fantastic ranges of spices and flavors. And kudoes to the designers for keeping the 'sausage-making' out of view of the diners, making the entire experience more pleasant than most buffets."}
{"text":"I had taken a peek at the Thursday night dinner buffet offerings and decided to go back for lunch on Saturday with my husband.  After checking out the bufffet, he decided to go to the Ocean Trail restaurant at the casino for the red beans and rice (always delicious there) and I dined alone at the buffet. I was disappointed and unimpressed with what I ate there.  The roast (prime rib?) was extremely hard to cut with the knife I had, and VERY rare. (And I like it rare, usually.)  The pork chops were too hard and dry to cut, the turkey looked very overdone so I didn't even try it, the fish was overcooked, the eggplant had a sauce that tasted like unseasoned tomato sauce from a can.  I tried one of the small bits of grilled steak ( not grilled to order)  and it was so-so, but I didn't expect fantastic steak on a buffet.  I also tried a marinated cucumber salad that was too sweet to enjoy.  The scallop lo mein was awful-- Panda express would do a better job with that!  I tried the chili-- it was not great. The shrimp enchiladas were not bad-- probably one of the better dishes I tried.  There were no refried beans, only charro beans at the Mexican food station.  I sampled some good cheese ( hard to mess up cheese) and it was good.  The asparagus was good, the mashed potatoes and gravy were good, and the sorbets were good, too.  The mango and prickly pear flavors were great. To tell you the truth, I prefer the buffet at Fort McDowell casino-- seems to be better quality and a lower price.  I think there is a lot of room for improvement at Talking Stick."}
{"text":"definitely above average American buffet. reasonable price. generally fresh food and lots of dessert options~!"}
{"text":"Like any buffet, food selection is plentiful for price. Eat what you like... Ate lunch which was average to good (some things better than others).  They offered wood fired pizzas, many salads, mexican, Stir fry, grilled pork, chicken, grilled vegetables...numerous desserts..  Menu changes depending upon chef.  Clean, attentive staff.  Located right in casino."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch today. Not many items but what they DID have was delicious. I was hoping for a larger selection, at least a fraction of a Vegas buffet since it IS a casino. Anyway, they had great fresh pizza with handmade mozz, tri-tip, pork belly, hunan shrimp, apricot stilton cheese, asparagus, Thai spring rolls, wontons, lots of desserts. Too many desserts. Way to keep America obese. Again I expected more of a selection for a casino buffet but everything was quality and service was nice. $15.20 total before tip for weekday lunch. No wow factor here but the pizza was scrumptious and cheesy."}
{"text":"I had the Sunday brunch buffet last Sunday. At first, I considered it to be the best buffet I've had outside of Vegas until I came down with food poisoning. It was the buffet because my wife is fine and we've shared every meal together the past several days and she is fine. She didn't eat any of the meats or seafood. I'm thinking it was the raw oysters that tasted a bit off. I'm into day three now and I'm absolutely livid. For the price I payed for the buffet, the food should've been fresh so I wouldn't have to pay for it the next three days. And yes, I thoroughly washed my hands before eating.... I'll never eat, game, stay or recommend Talking Stick Resort again."}
{"text":"Best.Buffet.Ever.... I think those 3 words sum it up. Everything is delicious. I have never seen a selection of dessert so vast in my life. I come here with a game plan... start with cheese appetizers and end my meal with every dessert they have to offer. But my plan always fails. I can't start slow, this buffet is way too exciting. Totally worth the money and better than any buffet I've been to in Vegas. I'd come here every week if I was rich and had amazing metabolism."}
{"text":"Love this buffet.  Food is always fresh, the selection is plentiful, and the price is reasonable."}
{"text":"Really likes this place.   Sure its a Casino and I really dont gamble or drink (at all).  But I was meeting a friend that I had not seen in a couple of years with my wife and its at the halfway from where we both live so it made a convenient meeting point.  Had a little trouble finding it inside as there are no signs but asking someone proved fortuitous and away we went.  We met up, had some tea and hit the buffet.  Great food.  I had some Duck, Pasta, Spinach Salad, Prime Rib.  Definitely went off my diet for this one.  The place was spotlessly clean and the server super attentive.  The only drawback is that we got a bit rushed out at the end of the lunch hour as they were setting up for dinner.    Hey I hadn't seen my friend in years, lots of catching up to do.  But all in all this is an excellent place for lunch and probably dinner as well if their lunch is any indication.  Desserts were great, had a peanut butter pie that was fantastic.  The food fresh and colorful with great flavor and not too many sauces or overdone.    Do yourself the favor and try it out.  Definitely worth the drive."}
{"text":"are 1st time at the Buffett at the talking stick resort!!!! the dinning room was very clean,staff was very friendly,food was very good!! steaks is my favorite!!! when u have friends or family can't beat it. I thinks it's about $20 p.p if u sine up for the players card,it's a $4 discount pp  no 5star because some cakes are dry,"}
{"text":"Plain and simple 5 stars of gross very poor quality of food. All the meat was cold and dry. The Asian selection was not very big and unauthentic as was the Mexican food  the noodles in the Asain food were dry. The enchiladas in the Mexican selection were the worst I've ever had. Shrimp gumbo don't bother. Pizza plain thin no taste. Dessert selection was big but looked like it had been sitting out to long nothin was moist. The best things were the mash potatoes and the Caesar salad. I was really disappointed by this place especially inside such a nice casino/resort. The service was great but the food needs to be brought up to Scottsdale standard."}
{"text":"We went here for the Sunday brunch. For $27.95 a person I had high expectations going in.  After paying they have you stand to the side before getting seated. The atmosphere seemed nice. We were seated pretty quickly and asked immediately for our drinks.  The buffet area itself was small, but it had a good selection of items. I won't go into detail about the various items but I will say that there was nothing that wowed me and some of the hot foods weren't even warm.  I thought overall it was okay. I cut buffets some slack generally because it's not that easy to mass produce great food. I probably would not go back unless there was a promotion or something.  The service was lacking. We had to flag down other servers to get condiments."}
{"text":"$12.95 lunch buffet (no fresh seafood offered during lunch).  I've been curious about casino buffets, and with a friend visiting w/ Malaysia, I used this as an excuse to try going on the Loop 101N on our mini AZ roadtrip.    Yes: Prime rib (no casino buffet should be without it plus you get an offering of creamy horseradish or the plainer, intense one) Cheese selections (snob appeal to have a cheese course after my main and prior to dessert) Berries & creme anglaise on puff pastry (this was soooo good, I sat here an extra 15 min relishing this with coffee) 14 flavors of gelato/sorbet (go ahead, that really nice counter lady will kindly scoop several mini tastes into a platter for you...hehe)  AND YES REALLY: Shrimp wonton soup!  I was digging it... but kept quiet cuz really, really?a buffet can make wontons this good?.  Then my Malaysian friend said \"this is really good\" and I got way too excited for being inside a casino and tripped over to get a second bowl.  Though I'm not sure how this place ranks with other casino buffets, this meal has to be an incredible deal when I kept tabs on how much we'd spend on lunch for the remainder of our trip."}
{"text":"Good buffet.  Not as good as Vegas (not even close), but one of the best buffets in Phoenix for sure.  We went for dinner, lunch and once for Sunday brunch.  I think the Sunday brunch was BY FAR THE BEST.  Unlimited bloody Mary's and mimosas and the food was especially good.  Plus it is inside the casino which is pretty awesome too.  Loved the hotel, stayed there for a few days.  I would definitely recommend this place.  You feel like u r in vegas"}
{"text":"My husband and I normally don't like buffets.. period ..but my parents were coming into town and they are older and love the variety and cost of buffets. I checked out buffets on Yelp.com for the Phoenix location. Wandering Horse at Talking Stick Resort kept popping up with good reviews. I read the reviews but was still leery. Sounded like the best time to go was Saturday night. The cost was $25 plus tax per person which included buffet and drinks. Cokes, tea, coffee The menu consisted of prime rib, kobe steak, oysters , salmon and lots of shrimp ,Chinese ,Mexican dishes, soups. Tons of desserts and even banana foster was available if requested.   My plan was to pay for our dinner as we walked through the door so my parents wouldn't notice the $25 charge per person. My Dad somehow pulled out his credit card while I was scoping out a table with my Mom. I could tell by his expression that the $100 plus bill was more than he expected ;-)   The waiter let us pick out our table and we decided on one by the window so we could enjoy the view. The waiter got our drink order and even served me hot green tea when I requested it. The glasses were thin and small but the waiter always came by and asked if we needed a refill. Our dirty dishes were also taken up promptly and new silverware were replaced after we returned from the buffet.  Now for the good part... The food. My husband and I don't eat red meat so I can't speak on that but everything I got was excellent. Salmon, fried shrimp, mashed potatoes, green beans and lots of mini desserts.  Dad stated prime rib was also excellent. I usually think the food at buffets all taste the same and bland but this buffet actually exceeded all our expectations. Actually flavorful. Mom and Dad even agreed that it was worth the bill. I would really like to give this a 4 1/2 star if that were an option.   I would also warn you about the smoke in the Casino.  All I have to say is walk fast to Wandering. horse buffet.   We got dropped off at the front and my husband self parked and got a ride from a hotel provided golf cart driver. The line for valet parking was long and actually it didn't take my husband long to meet us in the restaurant."}
{"text":"Awesome choices for lunch. I love the tuna salad,sauteéd vegetables,tilapia and smoked salmon. Furthermore,they have good varieties of dessert. For $15 of lunch buffet,this is one of the best deal in the casino. My husband and I will definitely go back when we visit Phoenix."}
{"text":"Brunch use to be $28.00 per person!  Upped your prices to $34.00 per person for the same food and since your company is owned by the same as company that owns Casino Arizona no reason to spend that much for a similar menu!!!!  Won't be back here!"}
{"text":"Either I was REALLY hungry or that buffet was very good. The macaroons are insane."}
{"text":"Some of these reviews must be from the employees or people that have not had a better casino buffet. Went there Saturday for lunch, and being from San Diego, I can say honestly if you don't want to drive 6 hours to get to Vegas or San Diego then I guess this buffet would be second best. 5 stars is way too high to rate this buffet.  Steaks were like rubber, Asian food was as good as Panda Express, the \"gelato\" was just basic ice creme, so if you want almost as good then go here. I have yet to find anything in Az as good as Barona, Pala Casino, or Valley View. Guess ill visit Cali more."}
{"text":"This buffet was pretty awesome. We came in for Easter brunch and didn't realize that it was going to be extra since it was a holiday, but we sucked it up.   There was a lot of varieties to choose from.. mexican station, asian station, even a gluten-free station, a bit small but still great that is offered. Seafood was abundant with raw oysters, cocktail shrimp, and crab legs already prepped and cracked for you.   The most awesome part is the huge dessert section (which is a total plus). Lots of different types from cakes, and cheesecakes, sorbet, gelato.. it will make a sweet tooth very happy.  The buffet is very clean and the restaurant is quite large. There are huge windows that bring in lots of light into the restaurant and a view of the property."}
{"text":"Went here a couple times for the lobster buffet and the Alaskan king crab legs. Nice restaurant, good prices for the buffet. The only complaint I have is that the meat of the crab legs and the lobster gets very dry after it had been cut in half by the restaurant, all the juiciness and moist from the seafoods dissipate after if get the final steam before serving to customers. The only reason I'm hesitant to come back here actually. If you are reading this Wandering Horse management, please don't pre-cut your crab legs or lobsters in half, doing so would result in dry, non-freshness meat."}
{"text":"Great prime rib!  Desserts were also very nice."}
{"text":"It's cheap and clean (I'm used to the asian buffets, don't judge), but I was expecting a little more food than that. We had a really attentive waiter, so that's always a plus. Regardless, it's a buffet and I kinda spent most of my time wishing I was in some kind of food paradise living out my wildest dreams, but I wasn't. Oh one thing about the omelet/egg station - I was standing in line to order an omelet but the poor guy in front of me couldn't get his eggs over-easy because the chef didn't understand what he wanted (language issue), so that was awkward but a minor issue regardless. Eggs are eggs. You can't always get eggsactly what you want, I guess."}
{"text":"Buffet is exceptional. Food is really good. Street corn was a treat. Coconut pie one of the best I've ever eaten. Love the peanut butter cookies very hard and crunchy. Love the red skin potatoes with chives and sour  cream .would do this again in a heartbeat.  Prime rib was delicious and turkey breast also delicious"}
{"text":"The server, Romelia, was excellent in refilling our drinks and taking away our plates.   In general, the food was very good.   The shrimp fajitas were excellent, and another person in our party said the mashed potatoes were great too.   I would stay away from their Spanish rice... pretty pastie and bland.   Nice selection of desserts too and the ice cream was. Served in little melon scoopers, but were just the right size after eating so much."}
{"text":"I work in Scottsdale a few miles away from Talking Stick Resort.  My coworkers and I go to the Wandering Horse Buffet in Talking Resort occasionally to eat.  Our appearances for lunch have been less and less as of late.  Mainly because of their stupid tipping policy.  At the Wandering Horse Buffet, tips are included for 18% for parties of 6 or more.  This sounds like normal restaurant procedure...except that the lunch buffet servers only take orders for drinks and only refill your drinks.  They don't even take your plates away (the busboys do that).  You get your own food from the buffet and carry it over to your table.  When you enter the restaurant with 5 friends and pay your $15 buffet price, you are sometimes told about the 18% tip (many times it just silently shows up on the bill).  In the times when the cashier asks if an 18% is OK and respond with \"No,\" is when I get rolled eyes, dramatic sighs, and sideways glances to the other waitresses who fold their arms and look away.  It's a guilt trip every time and I find myself suggesting the buffet for a lunch destination less and less often.  I understand requiring a tip for servers who take orders, carry plates, return plates, bring coffee, take the dessert order, bring dessert, close the bill, take credit cards, return cards, etc.  All the servers at Wandering Horse do is bring drinks.  A mandatory 18% tip that requires a fight at the cashier to get removed is ridiculous.  The food is hit or miss and a little expensive, but the tipping policy at Wandering Horse Buffet kills the experience for me.  If they don't fix it, then I'll be wandering somewhere else for lunch."}
{"text":"This place is bookmarked from long and finally I made it today at lunch buffet and found it worthy for the price on weekdays .It is priced around 15$ for each person and they had huge no.of stations .Starting with Asian,Mexican,Pizza ,Dessert ,Salad stations. The one I loved most is the dessert one.   Good thing is they had smoked salmon and tomato basil salmon available on weekday too. I would say they should work more on the smoked salmon and the shrimp soup available. Service is prompt and also they would offer you hot tea or coffee at the end of your meal .  YES !! I am a FAN now for this buffet ."}
{"text":"Was here again for the 7th Breakfast Club UYE. I was here in January for the 1st Breakfast Club of the year but that was pre Yelp times for me. That was long long long ago in the before times. I have to say this Buffet is very close to perfect. Lots of food and lots of choices. Pretty much everything you can imagine for breakfast including some Chinese food thrown in. Fruit, cereal, pastries, omelet bar which is the best, BACON, sausage, hashbrowns, breakfast potatoes, fresh cut right in front of you peppered bacon, even Gelato. My only real complaint is that they don't have just regular buttermilk pancakes. They have whole wheat pancakes or they have nuts in them or something. Still good but I would love some regular buttermilk pancakes. I would even take blueberry pancakes. For $10 you really can't beat it. Breakfast Club always has great people at it and good conversations going on. Even for 8 am in the morning this had the biggest turn out so far. If you haven't been to a Breakfast Club you should come out. Go here for breakfast on Friday and Saturday when it is only $10 and stuff yourself. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"This buffet is really really really good! The food is fresh and flavorful! It is of high quality. The restaurant has a great ambiance...very modern yet cozy! And the service was excellent and way above standard. Our server Leslie took great care of us and was very attentive to our needs and really made our experience very memorable. We love this buffet and we love this resort. It truly was the level of service we received all the way around that sets this place apart and whenever we are in Scottsdale we will for sure be staying at Talking Stick resort."}
{"text":"I'm not typically a big fan of buffets and this one didn't really change that, but I was pleasantly surprised with how many options were available. Along with the typical buffet offerings (shrimp cocktail, salad, various fried items, etc.) they had goat stew, grilled sirloin steaks, pork chops, two different types of crab, prime rib, mussels, clams, oysters, and a lot more that I could get into. The grilled meats were good as was the prime rib. Plenty of food to go around with the crab tray and steaks fully stocked at all times during peak Saturday dinner hours. The desserts were pretty varied as well, although I didn't try many as I was stuffed from the savory foods.  Wait wasn't too bad, line extended out to the casino with a little bit of a wait to get seated once we paid, but overall it took about 15-20 minutes. I probably wouldn't come more than once a year, but it's a good change up if you want to try a bunch of different things."}
{"text":"Went for Sunday brunch, the price was $18.00 which included the buffet, and two glasses of champagne. The buffet had breakfast and dinner items. I only had the breakfast items (eggs, fruit, bacon, sausage, biscuits and gravy, etc...). The food was good, and the best part was the made to order omelette station. One pleasant surprise was the service; our waiter was excellent. Definitely worth a visit when you are in the mood for a breakfast buffet.   Cheers."}
{"text":"Tried the lunch buffet.  The actual food area is quite small compared to the amount of space for tables.  Over all quality was good for what I tried.  They had a Asian Station, various noodles with shrimp, vegetarian etc.  Didn't try any of it, but did try the Wonton Soup and dumplings.  It was tasty.  Chicken enchiladas were tasty.  Carving station had tri top and lemon chicken.  Did not try the chicken, but it looked good.  Tri tip was tasty and nice medium rare on the inside.  They also had sirloin steaks that were all well done, but they were happy to grill up a medium rare one for me which was tasty.  Blackend salmon was also tasty, melt in your mouth and not overcooked.  Desserts were really good and nice portions.  Meal over all was good.  Sodas, Ice Tea, and Juice was also included.  There is a full bar there too for those interested.  3 Stars is because it's $15 with tax, with tip looking at $18 for lunch which is a bit pricey.  Also you pay before hand which makes it difficult to tip. Having to prepay including tip, doesn't allow to give an extra tip based on actual quality of service, which I wanted to do because service was actually pretty good, but alas I couldn't.  Will come again, but not that often, $18 gets a really good non buffet lunch at a lot of places.  But if I'm craving a nice carving station protein kinda meal, will come again."}
{"text":"Took a friend here tonight for the Christmas Eve buffet. All the food I tried was fresh and very good overall. I had fresh oysters on the half shell, lobster claws, king crab legs, American Kobe beef steak, baked halibut, veal oscar, lamb chop, panang curry shrimp, smoked salmon,. a spoonful of very good guacamole. and a small bowl of seafood chowder.  The crab and the lobster claws were fresh and really excellent, as were the oysters. I really liked the veal oscar and had a second piece. The kobe beef was good but I have had better, still excellent for a buffet though. The halibut was good and the smoked salmon was very good. Lamb chop and the seafood chowder were ok. The panang curry was really excellent.  After eating all this I was too stuffed to try the desserts. Have to go back again to try the cheesecake.   Overall my friend was very happy and I really enjoyed the food so it was a great evening. Cost was $35 a person plus drinks if you order liquor. I stuck with ice tea but my friend had a drink and she said it was very good. Service could not have been any better, pushing on fantastic for a buffet.  Had to wait about 20 minutes to get a table but it was worth it. I'll be back again!!"}
{"text":"First time in town for the training. This place is near by the training center and the reviews on yelp were good. 4 stats and 300+ reviews. What can go wrong. How can this place get 4 stars? The foods were dried especially Chinese and pizzas. You can feel it just looking at it. Not much selections. I know it's only $20 per person for the dinner. Then why I gave 2 stars instead of 1? The server was good to earn 1 more star. Other than that. This is worst buffet I ever had."}
{"text":"Y'all might as well plan to have my funeral here on a Sunday during Brunch service.  Although this place isn't big, the variety is always awesome and fresh. If you can't find something you like here something is truly wrong with you or perhaps you're a bit too pretentious? This is certainly the CLEANEST buffet in Arizona and that's important to me. The stations are well attended to and I've never gone on a day where the food wasn't freshly prepared. Please note; they don't always have Crab legs only on Saturday Night and Sunday Brunch service I believe.  Typically, their dinner/lunch spread consists of a salad bar, cheese and crackers, multiple soups, Asian, Mexican, Pizza/Italian, Meat Station, and of course a massive Dessert bar! The last time I went the Dessert attendant was making Banana Fosters on request! Service is friendly and fast, the waiters do a good job of keeping your beverage full. This place is a must try!"}
{"text":"Made the mistake of going on the weekend, seafood on the bar equals super expensive.  Especially if you aren't going to eat your weight in crab legs, which I'm not.  Its weird,  I know, I love most sashimi but raw shrimp, crab legs, oysters, and mussels gross me out.  I also don't do mimosas, bloody Marys, or champagne.  I had a bad experience with mimosas, so I don't even like the thought.  If you're into that kind of thing, this is your A number one Sunday brunch spot. Don't get me wrong, I ate until I was miserable.  They have other stuff, like Chinese BBQ duck legs and a range of gelato selections.  I think I tried three or four rounds of gelato.  My favorite was definitely the salted caramel.  If they'd just handed me the bucket of that I would have been super happy, although probably also super sick.  I'm overall satisfied with the quality here.  I thought it was pretty good.  You should avoid the chocolate cake on the dessert bar, though, its got chocolate liquor in it and is disgusting.  Other than that, its all in what you like.  Give this a try.  You won't be disappointed.  Although I would go during the week if I go back, I thought $80 for two was extravagant when neither of us like the seafood."}
{"text":"It ain't the size of a Vegas buffet not even half the size... so chill out. This buffet is aight. I'm giving it 4 stars because in my opinion, it was clean and offered Gelato. Yup. Gelato. The food is eh. Not a lot of variety. Tiny Asian section. Tiny Mexican section. Pizza, pasta, American food, salad, fruit, etc. The usual buffet foods. Oh and about $15 on a Saturday for lunch - that's relatively cheap to stuff your face before they shut down and tell you they're closing the buffet down to prepare for dinner!"}
{"text":"Gluttonous and completely delicious...we did the lunch buffet with with my sister & brother in law plus 3 kids (the restaurant was very kid friendly minus the walk past the cigarette smoking blue hair contingency in the slot machine area)....  For lunch, they had a nice selection of prime rib and roasted chicken at the carving station.  Loads of shrimp + salmon and sea bass and a Mexican buffet area.  The deserts were amazing (had to do 1 slice of coconut cream pie and 1 slice of banana cream pie because I couldn't decide).  They also have a very nice selection of gelato.  Overall, it was a Vegas quality buffet for a fraction of the cost ($12.95 per person)."}
{"text":"Went on a Tuesday for lunch. $ 13.95 plus tax.   Lots of food options around the following cuisines: American, Italian, Mexican, Asian.   I particularly enjoyed the roast beef--nice and rare.  The mashed potatoes were so good I would trade my newborn child for them (just kidding) Brown gravy and au jus went well with the potatoes.    A variety of salads and desserts --too numerous to mention.  I will tell you there wasn't anything we didn't enjoy except maybe  the chinese fried rice.   A buffet, such as this one, with SOOOOO many options is lost on someone like me who doesn't have an expandable stomach.  I benefited from the choices and certainly I was not shy about eating their chocolate cake.  Cake was really good.  My companion, on the other hand, got his money's worth.   The staff constantly filled our glasses with sugarless iced tea.  Clean place, good service, plenty of good choice though not stellar cuisine."}
{"text":"We came here on a Saturday for lunch for which it's priced $13.95/person. I've been to a lot of Vegas buffets so I wasn't really expecting anything phenomenal. But as I scooted around the buffet, I was b,own away by the variety of cuisines! Asian, pasta, Mexican, pizza, gelato, salads, soups, cheese, ice cream, desserts, meats, and so much more. It wasn't about quantity though, the quality was definitely there and I went back for seconds and thirds and eventually 2 rounds of desserts! Yum! It definitely surpassed my expectations!   We came back on a Saturday for dinner for which it's priced $33.95/person. I was delighted to find that it was a seafood night which meant unlimited steamed crab and lobster!! There were also mussels, clams, shrimp! I was very excited and loaded up on my seafood.  This is a great place to bring out of town guests or for groups. To avoid the long lines or crowded buffet, come during off hours like for a late lunch or early supper."}
{"text":"For a casino buffet, I would have to say this is the closest thing to a Vegas buffet I have tried outside of Vegas. I went here after hiking in Sedona so it was a great place to be after a day full of physical activity. I saw some mixed reviews on Yelp so I wasn't sure what to expect. For $30, this was a great dining experience. They sat my friend and I near the windows, which had an awesome view of the sun setting behind a mountain, almost looked unreal, but it was beautiful. Our server was attentive and very personable--almost ninja like with the refills (there were times I didn't even see him and my glass would be full).   The buffet itself is not the largest (space wise) but there was a huge selection  of food items organized by region of the world. There was a ton of seafood options from cocktail shrimp to grilled salmon to lobster claws. The special of the night was  King Crab and it was pretty tasty. The most enjoyable items were the asian style chicken wings, shrimp linguini, seared salmon, and the cake options.   Even though there were a ton of people there, it was not chaotic. The staff were helpful in organizing the buffet area and kept the food hot and fresh.   Overall, I would recommend stopping here if you are in the mood to feast!"}
{"text":"For a price tag of $30/per person I'd say this buffet is OK.  Wandered (pardon my pun) into this establishment after spending the day drinking at the pool party.  We tried to get into Ocean Prime (I think that's what it's called), but the wait was long and with 7 people we knew we would be waiting forever- and we needed food.  At the time a buffet sounded like the perfect option.  I'm pretty sure my Husband would rate this place five stars solely for the large amounts of crab legs he was able to put on his plate.  He absolutely loved it.  I enjoyed most everything I put on my plate.  I especially loved the coconut shrimp, and the romen noodles.  I wish there were some warm dessert options, as the pies and cakes are not my thing.  The steak was good and everything was hot and fresh.  The service was great as well and I liked that drinks were included.  Not sure I would go back considering the high price tag, but honestly all buffets are expensive.  The food quality was good and everything seemed to be fresh, which is super important.  So, if you're in the area and need a quick place with lots of options, this buffet might be for you!"}
{"text":"It was alright. $21 for an adult dinner, I was expecting something a little more fresh. It looked like the food had been out for a while. Doesn't look like they change it out very often, at least not during the week, maybe the weekend is better. If you're expecting a Vegas buffet, lower your expectations. Not a lot of variety either. I probably wouldn't come back. Save your money."}
{"text":"we have a new 5 star casino Buffet in the valley and it is great!!! Rand H. and myself went there on opening day and the place was pact at about 11:00 am .I started with a great bowl of soup and then I had a plate of salad items. they had this one macaroni salad that was unreal it was so good it had sun dried tomatoes,feta cheese and barbecued shrimp in it yumm!!!! After that i tried the hot food items that were all excellent. Then it was on to my favorite part, dessert.Well they have quite a selection of mouth watering sweets but the one that really got me was this hot caramel cake. It was so good i went back for more even though i was stuffed   YUMM!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I generally think that casinos offer the best buffets across the country (especially vegas) and the wandering horse buffet is no exception.  I would highly recommend going for lunch during the week for around $12 as the best deal in the valley.  You get a few Asian options, a few grill options, Italian food (pizza and pasta), soups, salad, a few Mexican options, and a huge desert bar.  Of course, they have a carving station with 2 types of meat, and hot grill items which may include some steaks, burgers or pork chops.  At night they add a few more items such as crab legs or other seafood but it is around 90% of the same between lunch and dinner.  Also, check their website for theme nights as well.  They run keno on the TV screens in the dining area and have sports games playing at the bar in the center of the room.  The staff is very friendly and attentive and you can pretty much ask for anything you want and they will get it for you.  If you are into buffets, this is a great one.  If you lose a few bucks in the casino, I'll give you 50/50 odds you can make your money back and the buffet!  ha ha"}
{"text":"Ever since the first time I went to Vegas and ate at a Casino Buffet, I've been a huge fan of them! Of course, the variety is the biggest draw for me. Why confine yourself to one item when at a buffet you can have 30+ different things? Well, it was Friday night and Talking Stick came up. Bingo. Sign me up. Wandering Horse Buffet time!  The line there was fairly long when we arrived, but our total wait was only took about 25-ish minutes to pay & be seated. They had the full menu of items posted at the front so we knew what to expect. Our server came by and got our drink order in a short amount of time after we had gotten some food.  Overall, we were happy with the quality of food they were serving. I tried out a variety of items including fried rice, chow mein, & cream cheese wontons, as well as fried shrimp, veggies, potatoes, pierogies, and salmon. While some items were better that others, I did not find any of them to be disappointing which was great. I typically don't like desserts at buffets, but I really liked the freshly prepared bananas foster & gelato here!  As far as the pricing goes, we thought it was fair. We know we will never be able to eat enough to \"get our money's worth\" since it is $35/per person for Friday & Saturday dinner + Sunday Brunch. It doesn't particularly interest me, but they do offer crab legs during those times and also Champagne for Sunday Brunch. Their pricing for other times of the day is significantly less.  The only reason for minus one star is due to the service. We noticed that they were having a really hard time keeping up with clearing plates. We were given a small 2 person table so it was super inconvenient when we brought back a new plate and our previous one was still on the table. Since the food was good though, we will be back!"}
{"text":"This buffet is located inside the Talking Stick Resort Casino... It's pretty fancy compared to the asian buffets that my family loves to go to. It's clean and the ambience is just nice.  But for some reason... I prefer the asian buffet food (Pacific Seafood to be exact) maybe coz Wandering Horse doesn't have sushi.  I love the fact that they have the carving stations of meat! Yumm and a gelato station. They also have really good chicken wings atthe asian station (I don't think it's always there tho)   I just feel like the food here is too bland but my family says it's \"healthier\" which would make sense... So if you are looking to be healtheir... Here you go!!   This place is not bad tho, still not the best!   Oh and heads up they close lunch at 3pm... The reopen for dinner at 4:30. So no you can't stay there forever!!!   Come for lunch tho! Way cheaper almost the same food as dinner... But I believe they have crab legs for dinner!   Lunch is 13.95 and on weekends dinner is 33.95   3.5 stars!!"}
{"text":"I have been here twice now. Once for dinner and once for breakfast. Both were great. I had good service with both a small and large party. Drink refils were plentiful. The food was all tasty...Some of my favorites were the oysters at dinner, the gelato (and yes I had gelato for breakfast!) the breakfast asian food selection was good as well since I am not really that much of a breakfast person! All the stations all seem to be filled quickly when they are getting low and there is a good selection of main items, desserts, fruit, etc. Solid buffet with good staff working hard!"}
{"text":"Thanks to yelp found this place while in visiting. My coworkers wanted to try a buffet and this looked like a good place. Located in the Talking Stick hotel and casino. The buffet is around $25 a person. They have several good dishes like the prime rib and the kobe steak, and the shrimp and mussels. They also had pastas, pizza, salad and mexican food.  But the desserts looked amazing, if only I saved room to try it all. Although they may not be as big as some of the Vegas buffets, the quality of the food is above average compared to other buffets. The staff was friend and helpful. A tip to everyone, save some room for dessert."}
{"text":"I wanted to try this buffet because I frequent the Vegas strip buffets often and I wanted to compare. Wandering Horse is definitely one of the top buffets I've tried here in Arizona. It still doesn't rival the Vegas buffets because it doesn't offer nearly half the choices. However the quality was very good in the items I tried. The steak and roast beef was great, cooked tender and seasoned perfectly. The Asian section wasn't good. The \"dim sum\" dumplings tasted like something out of a frozen package of a grocery store. However, the spicy wings were juicy and full of flavor. I was only here for lunch but would like to check out what it is like during dinner. Service was slow and took a long time just to get water served. A good long walk going through the parking lot and casino."}
{"text":"First of all before I start I am the BUFFET MASTER.  I am the first one to ever review the world famous Buffet of Buffets in Las Vegas, so I know what I am talking about when it comes to Buffets.  I have eaten Buffets from Reno, to Vegas all the way to Atlantic City.   So let me begin.  Buddy hit me up today and said lets go out to eat.  We both were really hungry so I said hey lets go up to Old Country.  He said let treat ourselves and go someplace better.  How about Talking Stick.   So I was down since I have never gone before.    Ok this place isn't that big.  It is about 1/3 the size of Harrah's Flavors Buffet in Las Vegas and about 1/10th the size of Planet Hollywood Buffet in Vegas.  It was 15 bucks for Lunch to get it.  So I was expecting VEGAS or Reno quality.  Honestly I could go item by item and tell you how mediocre the taste was but I will spare you the details of that.  I will sum it up by a couple events that blew my mind.   The first one floored me.  I was standing there next to the Chinese food section and a person asked what kind of sauce was on the Chicken wings.   The Chef then proceeded to reach under the counter and pull out a bottle of General Tso's sauce, I just laughed.   I asked the chef if they made any of the sauces from scratch.  He said nope.  The second and other thing that really pissed me off.  The waiter came to me and said I better get in there and get all the desert I wanted because they were changing over for dinner.  YEP they boot you out.  Unlike VEGAS, or RENO  you actually have to leave.  You cannot stay for the dinner change.   So I went in to find a couple of pieces of cake left.  They tasted worse than Fry's packaged cakes and pies.   It was a joke.  The Ice Cream was average.    In conclusion this place is worth about 6 or 7 bucks for lunch  9 or 10 MAX  not 15.    RIPOFF.  Food tasted like SHIT.   Honestly.  Won't ever go back.   Rushed out of the place, couldn't even enjoy my meal.     Not even on par with Las Vegas and the people on here who are giving it high reviews don't know shit about buffets."}
{"text":"This is easily the best dinner buffet in Arizona. Its comparable to a Las Vegas style buffet. I've come here both times on weekend nights and Saturday they do a seafood buffet with king crab. They have a massive dessert bar, with gelato, pastries, cakes. The Italian section will make pizzas and calzones to order. The Saturday I went they were doing New York strip to order - some of the best steaks Ive had, the mashed potatoes are great and their Latin section had the best paella. All in all, solid place to take a group and great place for steak."}
{"text":"Plate 1: Chocolate donut, strawberries, blue berries, blackberries, pineapple, orange, grapefruit, 2 pork egg rolls, a maple bar and a yoplait yogurt.  Plate 2: steak, sausage, bacon and icecream.  Beverages: Water, orange juice, coffee and a diet coke.  Servers and bussers: SUPERB!  Cost: $9.99+tip on Saturday morning...AMAZING!  So obviously I am not going to become known for my food pairings, but the point is they have all kinds of stuff to meet anybody's desires at the Wandering Horse Buffet.  I think I only tried about 1/4th of all the options available!  It also all seemed very fresh.  The donuts even seemed to be made fresh in house as opposed stale ones that have been sitting around and sourced from somewhere else.  The fruit bar was my favorite.  I was too stuffed for the Mexican breakfast bar and cereal bar, but they also looked appetizing.     I am not really a buffet person, but I definitely left fat and happy!  If you leave this buffet hungry, it is your own fault."}
{"text":"I'm wavering a lot between the 3 and the 4, but they've given me enough great nights with the family so they get the benefit of the doubt. Very rare for me to want a meal enough to wade past a casino full of smoke obscenities for the food.   The lunch pricing is at a fantastic value and you're paying a lot more for the brunch/dinner/holiday packages. You pay first at the register, and as long as you don't order stuff like alcohol that's all you have to pay, besides gratuities for 6 or more. Even on a super packed Saturday with the line out the door, we could seat a party of 10 in about 20 minutes.  There is a great spread of options - Mexican, Asian, pasta/pizza, carving station, salad, dessert, and I'm still probably missing a couple. I do agree with the sentiment that quality is uneven. Carving station has ranged from great to \"what is this dry crap I'm eating\", the Orange Duck Wing hits a great fusion note, and surprisingly the pizza station is really good! I didn't care too much for specials like the crab legs Friday/Saturday though - it was a mosh pit next to the Asian area and it ranged from cold to soggy after reboiling.   I'm still waiting to try brunch, but I guess I'm pleasantly surprised the casino food isn't just hot garbage. It's close to my house and one of the few places I can get my grandparents to go out."}
{"text":"As buffet's go this is a little hit or miss. The brisket is phenomenal, I really enjoyed the potatoes and gravy and the wide array of desserts. I wish there had been a better salad selection but overall it was tasty."}
{"text":"The food is OK, but the table service could be improved. I guess the focus is on gambling. I don't think we will return anytime soon."}
{"text":"The Sunday Brunch Buffet is worth every penny! There is an amazing amount of seafood, a carving station with ham, lamb and prime rib. There was every type of desert you could think of. Everything we tried was wonderful. The three mimosas that were included were pretty good as well. I'm looking forward to going again soon."}
{"text":"This buffet is about as good as one can possibly imagine for the price.    We didn't realize it until we got there but this place is located in a casino.  I don't really gamble and usually don't feel at home in casinos outside Vegas but this casino wasn't bad.  It wasn't like the typical smoke filled dungeons you see scattered over Arizona.    Also, beware that the buffet closes between breakfast and lunch.  We unfortunately arrived right before it closed for the change to lunch but the staff was nice enough to let us eat the remainder of breakfast quickly.  They were even nice enough to let us stay through the change and into lunch which I was told would normally be an additional cost.    We were treated like kings and ate like kings too!"}
{"text":"Clean affordable with excellent food and selection. You will not be disappointed. The food is always fresh And well prepared. Can sometimes get crowded usually on weekends. I have been here several times and it always has been a good dinning experience. The service is outstanding."}
{"text":"They have a great selection of desserts here.   I don't think it's worth the $25 though. I came on a Saturday night. Their buffet consisted of: Cocktail shrimp and raw oysters  Mexican stand Kobe beef/prime rib/leg of lamb Fried shrimp/cod Asian stand Salad stand Pizza   For a buffet, that seemed really boring. I expected more from the Kobe beef.  The pizza stand had four different pizzas. I don't know why you would go to a buffet to fill up on starches.  I could get a better food from an Asian buffet. At least they have a variety of seafood and sushi.   I thought I could leave with a happy tummy if I lost in gambling. Boy was I wrong."}
{"text":"Its good. Legit buffet for $26.95. A little overrated, a little more expensive than your typical buffets, but the food is better than other typical buffets around town. I'll go back if craving king crab or lobster claws because thats what makes the visit worthy... Servers generally sucks(a lot of waiting & constantly having to ask for water & drinks) but the buser is really attentive(always)."}
{"text":"As good as it gets in AZ. This is probably your best bet for a Vegas style buffet 300 miles away from Vegas. The line can be horrendous, especially on holidays and weekends. Wandering Horse is by far nothing like home town buffet or Golden Corral.  On seafood nights it's like they need line security for the crab & lobster claw section because people start getting ignorant and act like they don't know how a line works but other than that, it's a very enjoyable buffet. High quality for the most part and very clean."}
{"text":"Delicious. The dessert is wonderful, with fresh crepes and pies made.  Entrees are also freshly made, I love the smoked salmon, prime rib, and all the pastas."}
{"text":"Best of the best buffets with AYCE King Crab, lobster, or prime rib, and some of the best desserts ever."}
{"text":"Long lines for buffet. We waited over 45 minutes for a table of 2 adults.  And it's quite expensive, nearly $75.00 for two people?  Our waitress was excellent!"}
{"text":"Excellent buffet food and surprisingly delicious salads! Had to walk thru the smoke filled casino (expected), but once you hold your breath and get into the restaurant, the service and food are excellent.  We were thoroughly surprised by the grilled veggies, as well as the smashing potatoes and tons of crab legs. Overall, we can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Went with out of town friends for lunch. Go before 3pm to get the lunch price. Amazing selection of foods, everything was fresh. Deli meats & cheeses, salad bar, Asian dishes, steak, pizza, cold deli salads, fresh fruit & crackers. Hand dipped ice cream, tons of sweets & sugar free treats.  Everything was quality and fresh.  Employees were smiling and helpful. Beautiful casino setting. Plenty of covered and valet parking.  I can't wait to come back on a Sunday for the brunch Buffett!"}
{"text":"Yoooohoo this place is the bomb! There is so much food and varieties so that there is something for anybody- that's me saying who doesn't eat steak or sea food. But still had so much of the pizza, Chinese, Mexican, American breakfast, and desserts and it was all soo sooooo good. Drinks are free as well. We had juices memosa and coffee. Place is in casino. Very clean ambience, grt service, fresh food and lot of choices. My wife eats both sea food and steak and she said they were also very good. A+++"}
{"text":"Food is fresh and well prepared. Service is friendly but do not speak English well. Atmosphere is nonexistent... Like a cafeteria. Smoke smell drifted into the room.   The view from the window seats is awesome."}
{"text":"Food was not impressing. The ambience and the decor of the place is great like eating at a nice restaurant rather than a buffet place. Food on buffet was served on small serving plates with employees standing right behind them to restock them when low. Sort of makes you feel like they are judging you on how much food your serving yourself. Maybe just me but, I don't like buffets like this.  There was not much choices with the breakfast buffet but would like to see about re visiting for a dinner buffet. Was A Ok."}
{"text":"This review is a reflection on the UYE Breakfast Club get together that we all enjoyed so much. Monica O is definitely the Queen of putting together large groups of Yelpers and she does a swell job of making the event fun and exciting.  This is my second chance to visit the Wandering Horse and always seem to have a great time. Brought my wife so I could introduce her to some some of my really cool party animal friends. She always hears me talking about them and this was a fine occasion to take it to the next level.  The food at the breakfast buffet is always very good and fresh. They serve everything that you would need to get your tummy filled up and make your belt buckle loosen on it's own. There is really no reason that you should still be hungry by the time you are finished and leave this place.  Service is always delightful and the place is usually very clean and tidy. Would like to see a faster process up front at the money takers. The line was very long before they opened and it felt like it took forever.  Big shout out to Monica again for all her efforts and time. You are the Best and deserve a gold medal or a new cute badge. Hi to everyone who came and to those to did not make it. Hope to see ya again next time. It's going to be awesome. PARTY TIME!  5 STARS"}
{"text":"It was our first time going. We went on fathers day so there was a little bit of a wait. It was way worth it. All the entre choices from the seafood to the steaks,prime rib and rack of lamb all outstanding.  Plus your choice of champagne, bloody mary or mimosa is a sure bonus."}
{"text":"Returned again last night for their Valentine's Day special!  Everything was top notch food fresh and can't beat the variety.  Service was excellent.  Highly recommend. Have the lobster ravioli if available and the parmigiana risotto- heaven!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious. Not your typical casino buffet of just fillers. The poached salmon was extraordinary. Roast was perfectly done, mashed potatoes were creamy and tasty. Everything I tried was so yummy. The gelato was almost as good as what's served in Europe.  The desserts all looked so tempting. Cheesecake was good too.  Service was great.  A great buffet experience. Before spending all your money on the slots, this restaurant is a must to try."}
{"text":"Awesome buffet at a great price! I've been to many a buffet -pretty much hit everyone in Vegas over the years. Talking Stick has great service, amazing variety and excellent food! Definitely worth the 20 min drive! A+"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have been excited about going here for months. Every time we went the line was so long we didn't want to wait.  We finally went Saturday night ...  I have no idea why this place has such good reviews. It's honestly like Golden Corral but with crab legs. And the crab legs were good so if that's what you're going for you will enjoy. DO NOT EAT THE OYSTERS. They small and taste fishy.  We knew this was a big no-no after we ate just one each.   The atmosphere is terrible like a cheap cafeteria and the selection is not good at all. The only thing other than the crab legs that I would eat there again is the bananas foster. Not worth the line or the price!"}
{"text":"Top Notch, Great variety including sea food, asian, soups salads, carving station, desert, Gelato/Sorbet.  Really good."}
{"text":"Upon the upcoming of a 2nd The Breakfast Club UYE, I realized I did not write the rave review of the last one as I intended. The mind get's a little slippery with age I suppose! I for one have never been a breakfast person but this was an opportunity to hang out with some Yelp friends and make new ones too, met at The Wandering Horse Buffet at the Talking Stick Resort & Casino. All you can eat and drink for $10.00 sounded like a great deal to me. The food was fabulous! Where else can you get any breakfast food you desire from fruit & yogurt, eggs made to order, fresh cut bacon,fresh pastries, with the baker making them onsite, the list goes on and on. Then to my surprise food of the Asian Persuasion for breakfast, I was in heaven!  As if the first two plates of food wasn't enough, I decided that hey if you can have dessert after dinner and lunch why not have it after breakfast? I had melt in your mouth gelato, a small scoop of pistachio, salted caramel, and caramel cookie crunch, soooooooo good!  I can hardly wait to go back, taking my Aunt when she comes to town and sweat pants!  Wandering Horse definitely converted me into a breakfast person!  Thanks Monica for setting up an awesome UYE and choosing the best breakfast place in town!"}
{"text":"This buffet is possibly the best I have ever had. That is really saying something because I have been to Vegas 17 times in the last 4 years.     Thought it would be nice for my mom and I to check out a local buffet so I jumped on yelp and found the reviews for this place. I have driven by here many times but really never noticed it. We went on a Monday night and expected it to be pretty busy. Lucky for us the place was almost empty when we arrived. We were seated at a very nice booth and placed our drink order. At first I did not see where the actual buffet was until I noticed people walking through the archways and into another room. I think that's a nice touch. Makes eating a but more relaxed and quiet.         We walked in and checked out everything before starting to fill our plates. Pretty nice selection. Lots of very nice cold meats and cheeses. These turned out to be very good as I tried several. I tried most everything they had to offer and was really blown away by the quality and freshness. The prime rib was excellent as was the pork chops and especially the duck drum sticks. These were my favorite and I ate my weight in them to prove it.          The deserts were also very good. I tried bites of several different cakes and pies and indulged in the gelato as well. I did not notice the crepe station until I was picking out my gelato. It looked like they were making bananas foster so I went for a closer look. Low and behold that's just what they were doing. Well I had to have some of this. I ended up having them place it on a crepe instead of gelato.. This was fantastic, as was every other desert we tried.         All in all the buffet was excellent. Everything was very fresh with top quality all the way down the line. We are going to go again for mothers day when they have a special menu. Can't wait!         Give this place a try, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"great buffet with lots of selections and the options have been plentiful along with a good price (especially if you aren't going on Saturday night or Sunday brunch - The price almost doubles)."}
{"text":"This was for brunch. Great price . Great selection for a buffet. This review for food & ambiance of the restaurant based on the wkday brunch price. I'd Say more like 3.5. It really is a good choice.. . but it's great for the price. We'd come back..."}
{"text":"Lunch buffet was $14 and worth way more! Amazing pizza, steak, asian, mexican, desserts etc. Of course we found this on our last day in AZ but will definitely be back. It was the best tasting buffet with the best selection I've ever been to."}
{"text":"The buffet is not bad however there's not much variety. Mainly the crab legs are the attraction and so is the display of desserts. The other foods were on the dry side like the beef but the seafood seems to be what attracts people here."}
{"text":"I have to write another review because it's Easter and it was a 25 min wait and they handled it beautifully. Even though there was a wait we got a table quickly.  I was impressed with their service at all the food stations. The prime rib was bloody of course. But I like mine pink not bloody. The server said they could put it on the grill for me for a minute! It was perfect. I also had the king crab legs, lamb, mashed potatoes, Caesar salad. A shot glass Mocha mousse dessert. Everything was delicious. I can't wait to go back. !"}
{"text":"Wandering Horse is the best Buffet in the Phoenix area.  Considering that I'm not a huge buffet fan.  I really love coming here.  First of all the price for this buffet for breakfast is only 10 dollars.  That is right I just said 10 dollars. It is a bargain for buffets; normally buffets are at least 35 dollars or more.    Secondly everything at the buffet is fantastic.  Between the pancakes to the desserts, you can find some great things to eat at the buffet.    Last thing is that the waitress that always takes care of us does a great job at keeping our drinks filled and taking our plates away when we are done eating."}
{"text":"I went to this buffet for a mini-UYE with Rand H., Jeromy H., Mike C., Robyn N., and Brian S. As I entered Walking Stick, I was wondering if this buffet can top The Buffet in Harrah's in Maricopa, which before this was my favorite buffet. I must say that Walking Stick Resort and Casino is truly impressive and Wandering Horse is definitely deserving of its place here. Well-appointed and brightly lit, the buffet's dining area offers a grand view of the scenic Scottsdale Mountains. The servers are very friendly and very efficient, and the food is superb! The offerings included carved meats, American, Mexican, Asian, and Italian dishes, plus a cornucopia of desserts. There are too many items to mention here, and I tried to get a little bit of as many of the items offered, loved all of the things I tried, and regret that I ran out of room before I could try a lot of the offerings - which is a good thing, because that means I can look forward to lots of great new things to sample during my next visit. So ... The Buffet in Harrah's - I think you're really great but you'll have to move over; Wandering Horse outshines you."}
{"text":"I've only been here for brunch.  It's a simple variety of options but the thick cut uncured slab bacon is the superstar at this brunch buffet!  The omelette station is perfect for me.  I stay away from those scrambled eggs that have have been sitting around......  I for one hate that burnt bacon aftertaste that I've encountered at many casino buffets.  You won't find that here though!  Just gimme a nice made to order omelette with extra fat and some of that bacony bacon and I'm done.  2 plates of that and I'm goooood with no chances of falling into a food coma while I'm grinding 10 hour sessions on the felt.    4 stars overall I would love to see more variety but hey sometimes less is more.....eeeh doubt it."}
{"text":"Sooooo worth the money!  Most definitely the best buffet in Arizona, and possibly the best buffet I've ever had, and I've had a lot. The only buffets even comparable that I've been to are a few select Todais (some Todai buffets are REALLY bad...), and Cafe Sierra in LA. Neither one of those, however, are in the state of Arizona, so they're not very much competition...  I came here because of Marsella M.'s review. She talked about lamb, crab, and prime rib, which are all our favorites. I called beforehand to make sure they had these on the menu, but they said I had to pay for their $40+ Easter buffet in order to get those. (bull!) Marsella confirmed they offered those for Sunday Brunch ($28 a person), and that's when we went. She was correct (thank you!). Sunday Brunch has a wonderful variety of different foods, as well as 3 glasses of champagne/mimosas per person. Love the mimosas! Since we saw Marsella's review, we've been here twice!  Our highlights were the kobe beef (you can ask the cook to make it rare or well done), lamb, crab (there are at least 3 different types), and, surprisingly, pink (I assume strawberry) yogurt. Really, best yogurt I've had in my life. My boyfriend also loves their pizza, which is very different indeed. They have so many varieties of desserts, and they're all pretty good. It's also nice to see they have gelato instead of the usual ice cream.  The only thing we really didn't like was some of the Asian items (but then again, that might be because I'm Chinese), and the fish. We felt their fish was very dry and bland. We also wish they had sushi, which is the ONLY reason why this may NOT be my favorite buffet ever (since Cafe Sierra had DELICIOUS sushi!). But really, those few things should not prevent you from trying out this buffet!"}
{"text":"First time here. All the food was very fresh and staff was attentive. Great choices of fresh salmon, turkey, chicken. Salad bar with lots of fresh fruit. Plenty of desert to choose from. Price was a bit steep at $38 (after tax)"}
{"text":"I have been here several times before. But, we came here on Sunday night for dinner. There was no wait at all . We were seated in a nice table by the window. Which was really nice watching the sun go down.  Our server was a really nice lady. She filled our drinks,Hot Tea and Ice Tea many times. They cleared the plates and checked on us a lot.  The food, oh yes the food. Oh so good! Every single thing was to die for ,as they say. The fruit was perfect. The meat was just falling apart. Even all the Aisan food was really great. Nothing was dry ,or over cooked, or tasteless. This was like going to a great Wedding in my book. Nice time all the way around.  Clean restrooms and plently of covered parking."}
{"text":"They have the best breakfast buffet at only like $13. They have everything including an omelette station. Finish off breakfast with the best gelato."}
{"text":"Depending on your dietary requirements the choices are many. Really enjoyed how fresh food was consistently refilled. The $22.50 with drink was not that competitive with Valley buffets but you never have to worry about the food sitting or being old from a previous sitting. The saying you get what you pay for applies here.  The guests were a combination of hotel guests, the usual very mature community and gamblers. You can choose a table that is positioned away from everyone and outside.   The waiters and waitresses are attentive when they are not busy sitting people.  They only take your order for your drinks. Professional Psychologists and Psychiatrists.  Don't forget to tip!"}
{"text":"Sadly, this place is starting to slip. Maybe the issue is going for the Saturday lunch buffet - when I clearly should hold out for Sunday. But the quality and selection just doesn't seem to hold up to the experience here the first couple of years they were open.  The smoked salmon is still phenomenal. The gelato is still a great touch to the dessert selection. And everything else was perfectly average.  There was nothing wrong with the food. It is still fresh and constantly replenished. But there are far fewer choices at the cheese station. No peel and eat shrimp or fresh  oysters. (I had both breaded and fried - but was really hoping for cold.) The pork roast was OK. The turkey looked dry. I didn't have any of the offerings from the Mexican food area.   I used to feel overwhelmed at how amazing every offering here was. Now it just feels like a normal AZ casino buffet.  Nothing wrong with it, most in my party seemed to enjoy their meals. And, when it comes down to it, the company was fantastic, I won some money in the casino, and I got to break bread with people I love.  If only they up the standards on the food and selection again - I'd be more than happy to add another star. They used to be worth it, and I hope they will be again."}
{"text":"I have been to this place twice and mainly because I enjoy the company of my fellow Breakfast Club members.  The food is abundant, however it does not mean it is anything special or delicious.  It is A-OK.  They have everything you can imagine for breakfast and more, there is an Asian section with some typical Chinese/Thai dishes.  They also have a Mexican section, besides Made to Order Omelets and pastries, donuts galore.  The one surprise is the gelato offering.  Gelato for breakfast, awesome!!!"}
{"text":"Came here because of the great reviews also because someone recommend me to come here. Also it was a Wednesday night and usually their special are ribs but there was no ribs what so ever. Thought it would be like a Vegas buffet. Well it wasn't. I should have known better. It has definitely clean inside and someone always brought refills when we needed it.   They do have American, Mexican, & Chinese food. They had 4 soups total. Meats, cheeses, pizza, noddles, barbecue chicken, turkey, mash potatoes & gravy(was so delicious), & salad(wish there was more toppings to add to your salad). Also they had lots of different kinds of desserts & fruits & ice cream.   The price you pay includes drinks. It was $23.95 we paid per person. I guess that's reasonable cause every other restaurant you would pay around the same.   They do have seating outside as well and heaters. Over all the food is okay nothing spectacular."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with my teen-age daughter. First off - this is a good value. We especially loved the carving station and all meats. The pasta with scallops and shrimp in a light cream sauce was really excellent. I think she has three servings. Ribs were very good.(This is coming from someone who lived in Texas for many years). I'd skip the Mexican and most Chinese, though the duck was very good also. Deserts were O.K. They looked very good, but the peanut butter pie and key lime were very sweet. Gelato was good. If they do not have what you want, just ask. We got some gorgeous shrimp cocktail and the chocolate/ hazelnut gelato by asking. Plan to return here for brunch as drinks(champagne...) is included with many more seafood items. Finally, nice atmosphere and kid friendly even though it is a casino."}
{"text":"Pretty bad  all of the food tasted like reheated, premade cisco food. Might as well eat a bunch of stouffers. Not even close to any other casino buffet we've had."}
{"text":"Just ok.  Really expensive for what you get.  Nothing great. Other casino are better and more value for your money."}
{"text":"The only reason I did not give this 5 stars is due to the weekend price. Almost $75 for 2 people BUT the food is soooooo good! Especially the sea food! So much selection. also, it gets VERY busy so be sure to come early"}
{"text":"Went on sat at 4:30pm after the Jackson Barrett car show. Stood online 15 minutes early and line moved fast on time . Not like in MARICOPA where they make you wait extra for high roller cards that never wait. Would rather drive 50 minutes from MARICOPA than go 10 minutes to the MARICOPA casino.. Food and deserts and service are all excellent. No reason to ever look anywhere else. Anything they serve is fresh and delicious and food is updated and refilled super fast. Tried everything from pizza chicken seafood and Mexican. Won't find a fresher or better casino buffet anywhere in Arizona! HANDS DOWN THE BEST IN THE STATE INCLUDING THE SERVICE."}
{"text":"Met friends for lunch. Had a nice assortment of foods from pizza to fish & chips, Italian, roast beef, salmon, etc. Nice soups and a big selection of yummy looking desserts.  Food was fresh and despite the fact that it was a very busy Saturday, we were seated quicly and service was excellent."}
{"text":"I was underwhelmed by Wandering Horse Buffet. We went here this morning for Sunday brunch. For $30 + tip and three cocktails the Sunday brunch is a decent value. It was the food that I didn't care for. I have a hearty appetite so I tried just about everything. The best part of my meal was the chicken ceasar salad.  The deserts were also relatively tasty. Everything in between failed to live up to my expectations. I felt like I was eating at a high end cafeteria as opposed to a fine dining buffet. Other reviewers have raved about the seafood selections, but simply having seafood available does not mean a buffet should be esteemed. For example, you can buy a fish sandwich at mcdonalds and crab legs at walmart. The seafood I had today was ordinary at best.  I had a california roll that was mostly rice. I had the caprese salad and the mozzarella was so stringy that I would describe it as borderline runny (I do appreciate the tomatoes being local and heirloom).  I had three different kinds of chinese food, none of which tasted very good. I had some prosciutto from the cured meats area and discovered a thin sliver of bone or gristle in one of my bites. The english muffin at the base of my eggs benedict was as hard as a rock. I was trying so hard to cut through it with my knife that I almost knocked over my champagne glass.   On a more positive note, the views from the patio are phenomenal and the service is very good."}
{"text":"Wonderful buffet. I'm generally not a buffet person, because I don't eat that much, but this buffet was worth every penny. Even if you just got the king crab legs and nothing else. Prime rib melted in your mouth and the desserts were actually homemade. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"I had the chance to enjoyed a nice lunch with Yelp Buffet King Rand H, along with Robyn N, Mike C, Norm R and Ursula D. Our group had a fun time sharing stories and getting to know each other.   The food was a bit uneven, though good. The best was the Tangerine Chicken (chunks of white breast meat), their Carving Station (Sirloin Tri-tip) and the Gelato (Caramel Chip). All would rate a Four Star if judged individually and the rest was \"A-OK\".   In the end, I wanted to like this place more than I did, given its upscale nature, and almost Las Vegas like Buffet features. I've cheated a little, giving them Four Stars for effort, but only Three Stars on execution.  Given YELP'S Rating Distribution Trend graph, Wandering Horse is off their game and in the Three/Four Star range after a solid opening.  I agree with friends and fellow Yelpers, Monica J, Pepper T, Heather C and Aileen B that Wandering Horse is good, but it could be better.  The tab came to $15.20 including taxes, but before gratuities.  Like I said, it's Three Stars, A-OK."}
{"text":"Went for the dinner buffet with a friend last week.  The cost was $20 pp, and not atrocious, but the buffet was similar to other higher end buffets for a little less money, especially since they ought to subsidize the food from the gambling revenues.  There were some decent things on the menu -- prime rib, smoked salmon, and some other things, but the Chinese food selection was pretty bad.  They had some deep fried stuff too -- the shrimp and scallops were good, but the \"crab rangoon\" was a little yucky.  All-in-all, I think it was OK, but a little pricey."}
{"text":"The Asian food station could use a bit more flavor. Shrimp shomai was lacking flavor. The waiter was usually not present to refill our drinks unless we asked. The meats could be more tender. My favorite area is the dessert bar!"}
{"text":"OMG...Best buffet in the valley hands down!!!  Beats any LV buffet including Bellagio etc.  Go for lunch...$13.95 is a bargain for this culinary destination.  I've been here twice and have been beyond impressed with the overall freshness, selection and presentation.  Some highlights:  - Salad bar - the \"bomb\" based on overall taste, selection and freshness as mentioned above...artichoke hearts, marinated olives, gourmet cheeses, many delicious prepared salads etc.  - Chinese - fresh, hot and delicious!   Scallop lomein, duck spring rolls, potstickers, and several other hot delicious looking entrees  - Brick Oven Pizza - Spinach, mushroom & artichokes....need I say more?  - Stuffed Eggplant - didn't even have room for this Italian masterpiece...bummer!  - Desserts - same as above....every imaginable flavor of gelato and so much more!  I cannot wait to go back here!!!!"}
{"text":"This is the go-to place for Sunday brunch.  Great selection of fresh seafood from king crab legs, oyster, large peeled shrimp, smoked salmon and etc.  Prime rib and wild boar bacon are amazing.  The seafood risotto is usually pretty good and made fresh in small batch.  Decent selections of deserts.  A good place to go for Easter or Mother's day brunch.  Go early to avoid the line.  Just under $30 pp.  It's on par with the best of Vegas buffet.  Very family friendly."}
{"text":"My first time coming here and I was very disappointed... First time i come in Cashier was very rude... The food was ok..."}
{"text":"While the food was pretty good, the $72 price tag (with tip included--gee thanks) definitely made the meal less appealing. We visited the buffet after coming to Talking Stick to see a concert and thought it would be a good bet. The wait to be seated was ridiculous. There were tables open and we were a party of 6. The staff refused to push tables together or seat us at a bigger table as there 'might be a bigger party waiting in line who needs it'. They stopped letting people in because it was at capacity...but those tables sat empty. And those tables sat empty the entire time we were there. The food was just alright with some dishes more of a standout than others. But for the most part, it was just meh. IF we ever go back to Talking Stick--and that's highly unlikely for reasons completely separate from this buffet, we will definitely skip this restaurant."}
{"text":"Ate here today, Monday, December 1, 2014.  Everything was delicious and there were many good choices and opportunities to eat a healthier meal.  I tried the things I wanted and enjoyed everything.  The buffet area was very clean and attendants were constantly refilling dishes and cleaning things.    The service for drink refills and clearing was excellent.  Also, great coffee.  Looking forward to coming back."}
{"text":"THIS REVIEW FOR LOBSTER THURSDAY  Lobsters were small cold and tough. Rest of buffet was gross food that looked like it had been out for days.  For the money I would much rather go to Orange Sky upstairs."}
{"text":"Went there with my family last Thursday night for $20.95 each person. Nothing exciting to eat. The buffet lines were smaller and items were fewer than I thought after reading the previous reviews. The main course was roast beef and roast pork loin, both were tasteless and tough! So the most that I ate was jumbo shrimp coctail and grilled top sirloin steaks, which was OK. There were some skinny raw oysters but I avoided. Finished up with gelato. No crab/crab legs, no lamb, no kobe beef. I guess only the Sunday brunch offers those. We had more than 6 people in a party, so was charged 18% tips automatically, totaling $27 per person. For this price, I rather stick with Red Lobster."}
{"text":"well this place still gets five well-deserved stars, I went for a little UYE with Scott W, Robyn N, Lyn W. and her wonderful daughter Clair. We had a feast and to half. Today unlike my last visit this was a weekend so the buffet was a bit more expensive because of the free-flowing Champagne, Mimosas, Bloody Marys and Screwdrivers. When I say free flowing I really mean, I think it was four or five per person. Again all the meat was perfectly seasoned and perfectly cooked with a wide selection of unbelievably good choices! So I think the total cost per adult was $26 compared to the $14 and change for a weekday brunch. Like before the helpless with friendly and wonderful, in fact the manager at one point came out to ask a large group that was waiting to be patient because the place was packed. And in the same breath he offered them and ported himself each glass of champagne. They were seated shortly after and we also got a set of drinks before we were seated. If there was anything that had been ravaged and they hadn't yet noticed it I simply walked up to one of the many chefs in the serving area and let them know, less than a minute later the serving was replenished. This place rocks folks in a very elegant way! well that's my update."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what in God's name people are thinking, but this is an absolute 5 star buffet. Everything is made fresh and tastes delicious. We eat at casino buffets all over the US and this is by far the best. Spend the money and eat here, you won't be disappointed unless your a \"know it all\" food critic professional Yelper."}
{"text":"Alaskan king crab legs Saturday night was a very delicious night with a decent price for AYCE. I've posted pictures of the crab legs and they were easily to eat since they were cut in half for the guests to grab the meat out with ease. I ate so much crab meat that I started getting sick of crab legs (always a plus!)  The server was very helpful and polite. She refilled our drinks and checked on us when it was necessary.  The whole experience was excellent and thankful that it was a day like crab legs night. All I wanted was crab legs, therefore, I was completely satisfied."}
{"text":"Visited about a month ago for lunch on Saturday. Got here slightly before 11.30, short line, but it was already pretty full inside. Shortly after we were seated, the line got longer and we could see people waiting for tables near the entrance.  Food is pretty good but most are pretty average. They got the usual pizza (quite a few varieties), pasta, carving station, mexican, chinese, dessert stations. Good variety of desserts with nice presentation but mostly just taste ok. Overall, we were pretty pleased with the selection and the taste and for the price and for a casino buffet in the valley. It is no Vegas buffet, but this is not Vegas either."}
{"text":"I frequent this place for breakfast often. You can't really get anymore for your money Monday-Saturday if you are looking for a hearty breakfast with lot's of variety. The food is decent in general and I would say it is very good compared to any other buffet. The place is very clean and has a picturesque montain view from most tables. I have been for lunch as well and I am always impressed by the variety and the quality. The kicker for me is the gelato station with all the flavors and fixings. Who else has that, it's really great."}
{"text":"My new favorite buffet! Absolutely worth the price. They have an endless amount of different choices. Their lasagna and salmon was to die for! Not to mention, dessert was absolutely amazing. Wonderful service, our waiter was so consistent with refills and with checking on us. Will be coming back!  It's funny I'm actually going back this weekend and my first time was barely last weekend! Check this place out, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I come here every holiday for their special brunch. This place is awesome. Service is wonderful...always a clean table. The king crab is precut which is amazing. So many wonderful deserts. I can't say enough great things about this place."}
{"text":"In spite of the multitude of options for dinner, we chose to visit the Wandering Horse Buffet this evening.  We have eaten here plenty of times, but mostly during weeknights. Not that the menu has changed significantly, nor has the selection been any less spectacular than before. Most certainly, the dessert menu is still quite plentiful.  Notable traits regarding our dining experience this evening: Faye, our server, was just a bundle of joy and we thoroughly enjoyed conversing with her more than we really enjoyed our food. The salad vinaigrette, and the chops were also notable.  The salmon needed more seasoning, the soups were both in auspicious, and the carpet needed a little bit more attention. I can understand minute particles lingering on the floor, but large pieces of chopstick and straw wrappers staying on the floor for one's entire stay doesn't bode well for the attentiveness to cleanliness of this establishment. It certainly detracts from the atmosphere that they are trying to portray.  It wasn't a bad experience, but it wasn't stupendous either - nothing that truly differentiates them, aside from the aforementioned qualities."}
{"text":"Great, simple amazing food!! Crab and mimosas and prime rib. We had a great time. $35 was a fair price, we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Excellent selection of food and made well! Customer service was great. Restaurant was nice. The dessert selection is a WOW! Can't go wrong here. Only buffet place worth going to in Phoenix. Price was more than reasonable. We were there during super ball and thankfully they were not busy. I give them a rating of yum yum!"}
{"text":"This is a very good buffet. Not exceptional, but an excellent value with very, very good choices. The sea food was particularly good. We were very happy with our meal and would gladly return any time."}
{"text":"I usually go for lunch so that's what my review reflects.  I love it, awesome selection and everything is really good.   Not necessarily fantastic, but really good with a nice variety.  In any review, price is a factor.   Normally price costs stars, because it's not hard to find good food if you pay a lot for it.   In this case, they gain the 5th star because it's an exceptional value for what you pay,"}
{"text":"We tried the lunch on a Thursday around 11:30.  It wasn't busy at all, so we selected a table with a great view of the mountains and tennis courts.  At first service was a bit slow with the drinks, I think the wait staff could use a little more familiarity with English.  However, the food was fantastic for a buffet, especially at a Casino in Arizona.  A staple of these places, salmon, was moist and not dry or rubbery.  This was surprising.  There was an ample selection of vegetables, from fresh salad, steamed asparagus and some crudites choices.  All the vegetables looked fresh and tasted fresh.  You can sometimes get old vegetables that have been sitting out, but not a problem here.  The cheeses in the hors d'uvre section of the buffet were fantastic.  Also, the prime rib with horse radish was good.  The Asian section had noodles and fried rice, which were okay.  The fried items such as pot stickers, crab rangoon, and egg roll were very good.  The Calamari was good, nice and soft, not overcooked.  Finally, some of the desserts were very good, but some of the cookies were dried out, the macaroons were perfectly moist and chewy.  Overall, an excellent buffet experience for $12.95."}
{"text":"Steak & Lobster nite was worth it. Great cold smoked salmon. Very nice desert selection. We enjoyed the atomsphere and the service. One of the best buffets in Phoenix."}
{"text":"A lunch buffet for $14 with a wide realm of high-quality food from different cuisines? You really can't go wrong.  Some of my favorite items were the baked potato soup, mini spring rolls, chow mein, and key lime tartelette dessert. They have a decent salad bar, two or three options for soups, and a ton of entrees. The buffet even features a small carving station where they had a prime rib (yes, even at the lunch buffets!), chicken, and some more hearty entrees.   The only reason I didn't give this place five stars is because some of the food (the shrimp poppers and some chicken finger/nugget items) seemed like they were of the \"fresh-frozen\" variety. Everything else, though, was phenomenal, especially for the price!"}
{"text":"Always love the buffet, plenty of food and always bringing out fresh food. Wed. night is Prime Rib night and Fri is king crab night. Service was a bit slow getting to us our drinks. The gelato may be the best in town. Huge raw oysters too when I was there on a Wed. night is always a plus!"}
{"text":"I love their selection of food. There's a wide variety for whatever mood you're in. I lean more towards their seafood section. I've taken several of my friends here and they all love it.  Their desserts are awesome too. The keylime pie and the bread pudding are my favorite."}
{"text":"This is a 5 star buffet hands down.  The buffet has a wide variety of options.  Normal breakfast items like eggs n bacon, sausage, pan cakes, omelet station,  biscuits and gravy, donuts and everything else you would have for breakfast.   But they have stuff you normally don't see like Asian food, pot roast, they even had a bacon carving station.  There is a bar in the area so you can sit at it or order a drink from the table.     The food is top notch and there is always plenty of it."}
{"text":"Skip Sunday brunch and come for Saturday breakfast.  Best deal in town from 7:30-10:30 am. Lunch is also super affordable at $13.95.  If you look at where I've eaten in my Yelp career, I'm not normally value driven, but that said, I appreciate getting what I pay for, or in this case getting way more.  I think for the holidays they're doing lobster Thursdays for dinner. It might be worth checking out."}
{"text":"Had dinner there last Sunday, definitely not worth it.  A lot of the food is institutional grade, I'm not sure they make much of anything.  The red sauce on the spaghetti is canned I think, the cheesecake has a funny taste, and the Mexican - con cuidado mi amigo!  The guac is like the stuff from the tube at Taco Bell or Del Taco or one of those places.  Shrimp tasted like it was frozen too long or refrozen or something, it was rubbery and bland.  The pesto ravioli was good.  Crab rangoon wasn't.  Brazilian Churrasco was tough.  Overall I think about 1/3 of the food is OK, nothing outstanding.  I think for lunch it's OK from my experience. $13 is worth it.  There's enough to pick from to make that work.  But it's been a while since I've had lunch there so I reserve my rec for a future visit.  For dinner, skip.  Find a better place.    And don't bother  playing the slot machines on your way to the buffet, this is by far the tightest casino I've ever visited.  THe guy next to me won $10,050, I kept wondering how many tens of thousands he spent to win that."}
{"text":"We were given a gift for our trip and decided to use it to eat out. Our dinner here met our expectations for a meal, for a great environment, and for service.  Our server, Jin, was very attentive and likable. We had a booth, and even with music the acoustics were great and the dining area spacious. Real silverware and cloth napkins made it all the better. The buffet choices were eclectic--Carved, Asian, Italian, Mexican, American, and desserts, soups, and cold bar. All were fresh, well-prepared, and not over-cooked. Lloyd had oysters on the half-shell, Anti-Pasta, Caprese Salad, and Asian stir-fry...you name it! I liked the vegetables and the carved slab bacon--all this, to give you a feel for the foods presented."}
{"text":"Wandering Horse Buffet was my first Indian casino buffet experience in Arizona, and I thought the weekday dinner buffet menu had a lot to offer for the price. Maybe that has to do with the fact this is the only place in Talking Stick Casino I got something back for money I put in here ;P  All I know is that, we were all pretty happy with our buffet dinner meal.    There was quite a bit of seafood available which I enjoyed such as crab claws, shrimp, oysters, etc.  There were several types of different ethnic foods, salads, pizza, chicken, beef and my favorite part of the buffet, the desserts.  The dessert area had a gelato station, cakes, pastries, pies, parfaits and my most favorite of part of this entire buffet, the made to order Bananas Foster station.  OMG, I love Bananas Foster so this was, needless to say, very exciting for me.  The sous chef working there was so sweet, and he walked me through what he was doing during the entire preparation.  Watching him flambe the bananas with rum, sugar and cinnamon and add the sweet cream.  I wish I would have taken a video of it.  It was glorious.  And it tasted as good as I knew it would.  So yummy.    All the staff I encountered throughout the buffet were friendly and helpful.  Our server was attentive in refilling our drinks and bringing us condiments we needed.  All in all, we were pleased with the overall buffet experience we had here."}
{"text":"I did not find much options from the menu. There was only one option for fish, smoked salmon. Only one option for shrimp which was also sweet and too much sauce. Only one option in chicken , barbeque which I dont like..the food was not tasty.. There was many items for dessert but everything was kind of ok .. nothing was super tasty..I was not impressed at all and will not recommend to anybody."}
{"text":"Very impressive look and great food. Wouldn't recommend this place for vegetarians, but dessert friendly. Definitely going back hear in the near future."}
{"text":"This is the best Buffet I have had in a while.  They have huge booths for a large family.  The kids can run around while the adults eat.  They have almost anything you can think of for a great brunch.  The crab legs were great!  They also had fresh oysters and shrimp.    I would highly recommend this brunch if you're willing to spend $36 per person."}
{"text":"After consulting the Great and Knowledgeable RAND...my plus one  and I went out to Talking Stick for our bimonthly  Mommy -Daddy Date night . This night's excursion was all about Talking Stick. We wanted to see if it was worth having a stay-cation there.   First off Low Carb  heaven here folks!!   If I jump back on the Low Carb band wagon again this will be my Mecca.   Prime Rib, big sweet shrimp, lovely oysters ( actually better than we have had at Durant's and Bandeaux..seriously. ) Loads of fresh salad bar faves, like blue cheese , choice olives, mushrooms, bacon , nuts  etc. They also had a cheese / lox/ fresh fruit area that looked super healthy  , I must tell you the Kobe beef was very delicious and I wish I had had that first instead when I was full.  They also had some uninspiring Asian food and a pizza area..not necessary  for me but I guess somebody would like it.  Desserts were good ..not stellar , but pretty tasty,  they had some great gelatos, and cute little Brulees, fruit tartlets, good banana and coconut pies ..THE WORST ...surprise, the   Cheesecake, it was sticky, sweet peanutty..what's up with  that!? the had an interesting  fruit bread puddingish  dessert that reminded me of desserts I had in Germany...yum.  Service was great , drinks were refilled way before they emptied , good service, nice staff.   We will be back ...In my book 25.00 was worth it. Want to make it 5 stars..give me tender Prime Rib and tastier Desserts."}
{"text":"It was a slam dunk for me to give 5 Stars to the Wandering Horse Buffet. First of all, the dinner buffet is only $20. When you compare the price for all the variety of great tasting food you get, you are definitely getting a great deal. I had my fill of the buffets during my recent trips to Vegas, so I think I'm qualified to compare buffets. I also used my $4.20 in credits from my Player Reward Club card to bring down the cost of the buffet even more.  They have fish, how about Salmon, shrimp, and Mussels to name a few. And you can't have any pudding if you don't eat your meat. They have pork, Prime Rib, beef, Chinese Chicken wings (I'm drooling). They have plenty of soups, I liked the won ton soup. They had this excellent salad that consisted of cucumbers, cherry tomatoes cut in half with some other stuff included (but no lettuce) with this insanely delicious light salad dressing. I had about three helpings of that salad so I had my veggie quotient for the week.  How about those desserts? They had several different pies. And the winner was the coconut pie. How I stopped myself at one piece, I'll never know. Now on to the Gelato, the Mango was good, but to me the show stopper was the Coconut. They had so much more, but my stomach finally said \"No mas\" until next time."}
{"text":"Well maybe for Sunday Brunch they aren't as good as other times.  I can't say they were bad but I also can't say they were great either.  Someone said something about endless drinks???? I didn't get that experience or I might have given an extra star ?  Some things I selected I thought seemed old,like the cheese and I don't care for old precut cheese no matter what kind it is....also every bite of fish I tried was dry except for the cold fish selection.  They had heirloom mini tomatoes on the salad bar but they were shivered.  I only tried one  beef meat that came fresh from the cook unloading it on the buffet so I grabbed it and it was fresh and cooked nice  but not flavored well.  The best hot meat I tried was the dark chicken the only one that was actually good.  The Asian selection looked frightful so I didn't take any to try.  Among the high lights were the FRESH CORN COBS....they looked like Arizona grown because of the tiny sweet kernels that were kind of dry.  I also enjoyed the Artichokes that seemed fresh marinated.  My husband said a highlight was some sort of shrimp that I didn't taste,he said it was very good.  The desserts all look really great....I tried a mini scoop of lemon cello sorbet and it lacked flavor, We shared a mini cannoli and it wasn't too bad, and the mini Lemon Meringue pie had great lemon curd but raw meringue and a crust that was heavy as a fur coat in the hot sun. All the servers did seem hospitable.  I know people who LOVE this place and go every week so you might not agree with me and again maybe they are better at dinner time or weekday lunch, brunch was around $25 plus tax and tip.  I felt that I was a Wandering Horse after indulging"}
{"text":"Worth the drive and every penny!! King crab legs were hot and sweet and already cut open for easy eating! Seafood galore and all delicious. I wish I had enough room for more desserts, they had about 30 to choose from! Don't miss out on this place!!"}
{"text":"So I have never been to Talking Stick despite living in Scottsdale for 7 years....tonight was to have been the first time for my girlfriend's birthday. She had called earlier this week to make reservations at the buffet to celebrate and after dinner go to the bar up in the penthouse. I was excited! But then I walk thru the front doors and my girl was in tears! ON HER BIRTHDAY!!!! Apparently she went to check in and was RUDELY told that she was mistaken as they NEVER make reservations on the weekends. She proceeded to tell the manager and staff not only did she make the reservation SOMEONE called her to reconfirm HER RESERVATION!!!!????? they basically called her a liar. So feeling stupid she walked away in tears. I attempted to try and fix this, I went to the front desk of the hotel and got the manager on duty, Mary. God Bless her as she attempted to resolve this but by that point my girlfriend just wanted to leave. She was done and I dont blame her. This was my FIRST AND LAST VISIT TO TALKING STICK"}
{"text":"Visiting from San Diego, of course we had to check out at least one of the local casinos. There are two with the same name within a couple of exits of each other so I am not sure if they both have slots or if one has the slots and the other one is just cards but they are both conveniently located right off the freeway.   We've visited many buffets and they ranged pretty damn good (Barona Casino and Valley View Casino) to absolutely gross (Viejas) and everything in between. What makes this buffet a stand out is it's all the high end touches that abound. Beginning with the buffet entrance, everything is wonderfully decorated and the views from the dining room are lovely.   The service are not overly friendly but are very intuitive. There is no refill drink bar, all your free drinks are replaced as if by magic. There are real cloth napkins, weighty silverware and comfy chairs.   The restroom is a bit of a walk but again, you will get to enjoy the rest of the hotel/casino while you walk around. Like many other yelpers have said, the Buffet is located in it's own room. All the food is beautiful presented, all the serving stations and decorations are high end and upscale and at no time do you feel you are in a cafeteria as you may have felt in other casinos.   The food is just too much too mention but everything we had was tasty and the desserts were killer. Very nice place, will def visit again."}
{"text":"Awesome.  Went for Sunday brunch.  Great selection and variety of all kinds of foods - breakfast, savory, sea food, ethnic food (Italian, Mexican, Chinese, etc), caving station, and expansive dessert options.  Food was being cooked continuously and stations replenished often so food was fresh, not old and dried out like it can get at some buffets.  3 drinks included with brunch.  I was uncomfortably full at the end because it was so good."}
{"text":"I love buffets!  One of the main reasons I go to Vegas is for the buffets.  Wandering Horse is the closest to a Vegas buffet but at less then half the price.  My daughter chose to go here for her birthday.  My husband takes a look at the prices for lunch online and is shocked.  It was $8.95 for kids and $13.95 for adults.  Wow!  That's a deal!  They have a good variety of food to try.  I loved the bbq duck legs.  Yum!  The dessert bar was wonderful! The kids love the gelato and so do I!  But my favorite dessert was the chocolate chip cookies.  If you are dining on a budget and want good variety, this is the place!"}
{"text":"If I could I would be here every Saturday for the endless amount of beautiful quality crab, so delicious! Also of course their amazing sorbet bar in their desert section is to die for, especially the blood orange sorbet."}
{"text":"Ummmmm, ...  Holy.  Crap.  This Sunday champagne buffet was super tasty.  If I wanted to weigh 500lbs, I'd totally eat here everyday. For now, I shall just go on Sundays.  Loveddddd it!"}
{"text":"Great brisket and smoked salmon, the fish adobado wasn't bad either and calamari was tasty but it is pick and choose.  The pizza did not look good but many items were fresh.  For the price of nearly $25 per person (incl tax) that makes it costly for a Casino meal.  I was hoping for Prime Rib at that price but the brisket was exceptionally tender so somebody spent a lot of time setting up the slow roasting to do that.  Not sure if I'd do it again when the deli is much more reasonable and the patrons are a bit more civilized - got elbowed out of the smoked salmon line by a young Asian gentleman that stepped in and cut the line."}
{"text":"Joined 35 fellow Yelpers for the Breakfast Club UYE (thanks Monica) for the Saturday morning buffet. It was $10.95 for adults and $6 for kids. Still well worth it for the wide variety and quality of the food and the excellent beverage service.   I decided to go with pot roast with oven roasted potatoes and carrots, corned beef hash, Kung Pao chicken, walnut-caramel roll and hot Earl Grey tea. Each food item was served at the right temperature and tasted outstanding.  Service was spot on with the servers checking back frequently and our drinks kept topped-up The view of the desert from the dining area is awesome."}
{"text":"Best buffet in Arizona. Food is a cut above standard buffet food. Alaskan king crab is delicious. Everything is of high quality, very clean and good service. Pricey but worth it!"}
{"text":"I ate so much last night I actually went into cardiac arrest.  Paramedics were summoned. They tried everything including paddles. I was a goner.  Then one of the buffet-goers loudly announced they'd just refilled the lobster and crab station and I sprang back to life, just like Uma Thurman in Pulp Fiction.  I'm resting comfortably now.  I found some bits of shell in my cargo shorts this morning. I have no idea what happened after my near death experience but I know it involved copious amounts of shellfish."}
{"text":"Still getting to know our new backyard, best way is finding a new breakfast joint on the weekend.  Plenty for everyone in your group.  Our waitstaff was incredibly gracious."}
{"text":"Questionable quality! My family usually eat at Casino Arizona Eagles Buffet as it's one of the few buffets in town we like and tonight we decided to try the Talking Stick Resort buffet for my Brother's birthday.   I'm guessing the food is better on specialty nights or weekends but Wandering Horse was terrible on this Monday night. The Asian food didn't look anything special and was basic as any Chinese restaurant grub. Their salad selection was severely lacking compared to Eagles Buffet (Eagles offers 3 prepared salads and a salad bar for personal construction). Any varietal salads you had were in the Antipasta section. The meat carve was OK but a little dried up. I appreciated the baked salmon and pilaf. The oysters were impressive as well.    Their cheese board and charcuterie was not good. The cheese was dried up and there was only one selection of meat. I've ordered charcuterie plates in Scottsdale restaurants and Wandering Horse cannot not compete. You mind as well eat out than eat in.   The dessert section was OK. It was about the same as Eagles buffet. They probably differ in a few desserts. The only impressive thing was the gelato bar. Lots of pies...  Lastly, the silverware was not clean!  For a place located in Scottsdale and being inside a resort, I expected better. I heard from some friends that Talking Stick had luxurious food establishments. Unfortunately, the buffet was not impressive at all. Maybe it can't be as elaborate as the Vegas casino buffets but I think they can learn a thing or two by the local restaurants in Scottsdale. I find it worth going to a local restaurant with better quality than try eating at this average buffet. You probably want to go on a specialty day and avoid it on normal nights.   My mother ended up having a stomach ache and puked out her food later on sadly.   Much is to be desired."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place out for dinner one of the nights I was staying at the resort. Absolutely terrible. The food was completely flavorless. For $36 I would expect there to be better quality food. Not worth the amount of money I spent nor the amount of time waiting in line."}
{"text":"I have been here several times over the past five years and it definitely is a place that I need to eat at when I visit the Phoenix area.  During my very first visit here back in 2011 (my prior review), I thought that we were given very lackluster service.  Since then, we have only experienced excellent service by the many staff members who we have encountered.  The quality of the food here is exceptional and none of the other area casinos that I have been to has food that compares.  The weeknight dinner menu has plenty of delicious options, but I think that splurging on seafood night is well worth it.  The king crab legs and the seafood pasta that they offered were amazing.  In general, I also really enjoy their duck potstickers, steak, caprese salad, chicken caesar salad, and the rest of their salad bar.  The desserts continue to be of top notch quality.  I usually like to have hot tea towards the end of my meal and I love that they have Mighty Leaf tea bags!  I hope that this is something that they will continue to offer."}
{"text":"The wandering horse buffet has a great breakfast buffet ! Not a bad buffet for $11.95 great selection on food !"}
{"text":"The buffet for Saturday night is 26.95 per person as of this writing. I would consider it a good deal at 20, but 27 is a bit too high. Some food was fantastic. The steak and salmon were very good, and the peanut butter chocolate cream pie was fantastic, rich but not heavy. One standout low was the so-called French onion soup, which was made with (I kid you not) reconstituted onions, almost identical to the grody ones McDonald's puts on its burgers. A cup of Lipton instant soup would have been better. I suppose that would be (barely) okay for a 7 dollar cheap ass buffet, but wholly unacceptable when dropping close to 30 dollars for a meal.  Fresh onions just aren't that expensive, and while a good French Onion soup takes a while to make, it's not labor intensive at all and an acceptable one should be easily in reach of any certificate holder from a culinary school.   Basically, I'm reinforcing what others have said; what's good is very good, what's not good is downright bad."}
{"text":"It was pretty ok. Food is tasteful and fresh, but there was less variety than I originally expected. Considering the price it's not too bad though. The only problem(?) I had was that I am not a big dessert person, and 70% of the selections they have are a great variety of desserts."}
{"text":"Always wanted to try this Buffet.. Went to dinner before the Boz Scaggs Concert..  No wonder the Horses wondered- I wish we did.. Let me say first off that the service is excellent and I just wish the food was the same.  We were not there on a Prime Rib night and that might have changed our experience. Their Carving Station was, Lamb, Beef Wellington and a Pork Steam Ship. None were eatable.. The Lamb was blood rare and they carved it in chucks-- tasteless and way too rare for Lamb.. The Beef Wellington was like pot roast- overcooked and tasted as though they made it in the Microwave...Then there was the Pork Steamship which we didn't try because it was all dried up and shredding like an eagle had gotten to it before the Chef did.. Horrible looking! No one on line took it and the comments were all very negative..The salad bar is very limited.compared to other buffets... the tomatoes were tasteless and some looked spoiled.. I will tell you that the Pizza was delicious!  The cookies were tasteless and the mini eclairs had a freezer burn...The Pies were good and the ice cream...  The little Buffet at the Radisson Ft McDowell is so much better- not a very pretty room but the salad bar is fresh with an incredible variety of cheeses, olives, artichoke hearts etc.. Their food is excellent... .. I had a stomach ache for two days after..    I can't tell you how disappointed we were...Go there to the Red Rock Buffet so much better for the price!!!"}
{"text":"Sadly, WHB has slipped off its pedestal for me.  Lately, there have been some disappointments.  Actually, many disappointments.  As usual, prices have gone up while quality has gone down.  Even though items are put out in small batches, many times they are not fresh.  I used to regularly enjoy their petite steaks, but now they're just dry, tough, and overcooked.  The pasta dishes may or may not be worth considering.  The crab legs on occasion are just bad.  At times, I have wondered if they were left over from Sunday brunch.  And when I asked for a freshly made tortilla (per the sign that says \"made to order\"), I was directed to the ones sitting in a basket that were already stale on the edges.  Really?  The guy manning the station was doing NOTHING.    While there are days WHB is nearly a 5-star visit, those days are becoming further and further between.  We used to eat here almost weekly, but have dropped to maybe monthly because of the inconsistency in quality.  It's become a \"we have to eat now\" situation, and usually not worth the $45-$60 price tag for dinner for two."}
{"text":"I have to start off by saying that this is not the best buffet that I have ever tried; for that you would have to go to Vegas.  That said, I doubt that you will find a better buffet in the Phoenix area.  We ate outside with a nice view of the nearby mountains at sunset.  The food quality was very good, the variety was excellent, and the service prompt.  The desert bar is on par with the best I've seen anywhere.  For what you get, I found the pricing very reasonable.  Overall a very good experience."}
{"text":"I recently dined for the breakfast buffet at WH and it was my first experience here. I was absolutely floored by their architecture, design, the beauty including the mountainous views, it's clean, comfortable and the entire staff and breakfast buffet was outstanding!  WH well exceeded what my initial impressions were with buffets, but this place is very different.  The food is fresh, with a lot of variety to choose from and of quality.  During my dining experience is was only $9.99 for the breakfast buffet and it includes unlimited beverages of OJ and or coffee!!!! Say what???!!!! A superb deal! They are very accommodating to any group in your party and I HIGHLY recommend WH for your extremely hungry cravings! I cannot wait to return again for breakfast and also try their other buffet offerings for lunch, dinner and brunch!  I NOW have another favorite restaurant at Talking Stick aside from Ocean Trail! Yippee!! Talking Stick is a WINNER! BTW where else can you find a fabulous deal like WH for buffet? And for someone like myself that does not consume pork or pork products they had a lot of other delicious options to eat including amazing fresh fruit, eggs, hash browns and OH OH OH!!!! I LOVEd their salsa, it had a wonderful kick to it."}
{"text":"Probably the best overall dinner buffet in the Phoenix area. New, spacious, clean with attentive table service. Even a nice covered outdoor patio with candles, heat lamps and a view. If you are going to spend $25 for buffet, spend it at Wandering Horse Buffet. Ask for directions to the Buffet entrance, it's easy to miss."}
{"text":"This review is for breakfast...  We had friends coming to visit and the hubby and I decided to go try the breakfast buffet on Saturday. We were very pleased with the service and options, the only thing was that the doors to the patio were left open and there was a very cold breeze (well, cold for Arizona standards) and we were a bit uncomfortable because of that.  Well, we took our friends there today, we were cautious to avoid the cold draft... ordered our drinks... and then we proceeded to be totally disappointed by the buffet. We had highly recommended the Asian food and none of it was there, just fruit and fruit all over the place and a lot of the good stuff we had Saturday was missing... They had some sort of smoothies that didn't taste like fruit, were way too sweet, and were all watered because of melting ice. The carving station only had some sort of bacon that was extremely salty (I am often accused of eating too much salt and I could not eat it)... they didn't even have the mandatory bacon tray that any decent breakfast buffet should have... it was just a big tray with sausage patties, sausage links an a little bit of bacon...  So while the buffet may still be good, and be a good deal, we were very disappointed because of that fact.  ***Saturday was too busy and we didn't get an omelette, but today there was no line and we had some. The ladies working the omelette station were very friendly and worked very well together, they were interacting really well and that was nice to see. Their omelettes were nice and fluffy, but about the ingredients, I was not very impressed either."}
{"text":"I do love a good Sunday brunch and this is one good brunch! Wandering Horse Buffet is located inside the Talking Stick Casino in Scottsdale. Although I am not a big fan of the casino itself, the buffet is both beautiful and delicious. This is the 3rd time we have eaten here and each time is better than the last.   Today I sampled the lamb chops, prime rib, American cobe beef, cracked crab legs, cocktail shrimp, chow mien with shrimp and scallops, shrimp won ton soup, smoked salmon and assorted imported cheeses, deli meats and more that I cannot even remember. They also feature freshly made pizzas, salads, and much more.   I am not sure how but for desert I sampled fresh house made chocolate chip mint ice cream and creme Brulee with other choices which included pies, cakes, cookies and fruit tarts.   Oh, and day drinkers rejoice! Champagne, Mimosas, Skyy bloody Marys or Bellini's are included in the $24.99 pp price and contrary to previous reviews, we were allowed to order our cocktails, all throughout our 2 hour meal, without our server making us feel like the lushes we most certainly are."}
{"text":"One of the best buffets in town!   Dinner on a Saturday night is $26.95 per person, kinda like Vegas buffet prices. I thought it was worth it. They had king crab legs, lobster claws, clams, mussels, raw oysters, prime rib, a variety of Asian foods, pizza, etc. I like how they are able to warm up the seafood for us because some places don't. There's also a bar inside, so if anyone feels like they need a cocktail or two they are able to just walk up to the bar. The view wasn't so bad either. We had a table next to the window and we were able to catch the sunset.   If you do plan to go, arrive early or you'll be stuck in a looooooong line. The wait was worth it though!   Happy eating!"}
{"text":"Today is our 2nd brunch buffet at this place. Yes, its price is higher than others but the quality is better. Also, we don't get chocked by tobacco smoke walking through the casino. Yes, I can still smell tobacco, but less than other casinos.   The service staff is professional, friendly & efficient.  The seafood is obviously frozen (but what can one expect from a place in the middle of a desert?) but is still better than others.  One of my many favorites is the \"custom-cut\" bacon: crispy skin, very good flavor.   The dessert dishes are not overly sweet. I can taste the underlying ingredients (nuts, fruits, chocolate, etc.) instead of just sugar.   We will be back to this restaurant."}
{"text":"I was not impressed.  The only thing that was worth my 33.95 for dinner was the crab legs.  Even with that the line to get crab legs was so long, i waited about 15 mins to get some.  The selection of food was not good at all, my husband tried the chicken enchiladas and the tortilla was like rubber he could not cut them.  Our  server was not very attentive and kept forgetting what i asked him for and he wasnt the nicest.  Tried to get some pizza and all they had was pizzas with mushroom and i am allergic to mushroom and he said he couldnt make special pizza and he had to stick by his \"list\" .  There were quite a few empty selections and the salad bar was quite limited.  I will not be back."}
{"text":"Consider this Sunday Brunch buffet the Godfather to all buffets in the Valley. If you're like me, you won't quite realize what you're getting yourself into until you've been seated and you make your way into the buffet room. Yes, I said buffet room and I mean that it's an entire room dedicated to the buffet. Here's how it works: you stand in line to enter the restaurant, you pay upfront, you're seated by a hostess and then the feeding frenzy begins.   Once we were seated, we took a moment to take in our surroundings. I looked to my left, I looked to my right and everywhere I looked, people had food piled (and I mean piled) high on their plates. Had they eaten in weeks or had they just eaten last night? It's hard to tell, but really, it's also hard to blame the gorging-like behavior because the second you see this buffet, an animal instinct triggers in your body and you must attack the buffet as if it is your last meal on this earth. People piled entire meat shops on their plates and then topped it off with heaps of fried Chinese food, cheesy Mexican food, Seafood glory and any pastry, dessert or breakfast dish imaginable.   For the amount of traffic this buffet gets, the staff, service and structure is spot-on and even with just one person working the register, we got through the initial line pretty quickly. Once we were inside, we were let loose to discover the culinary creations on our own. The buffet room is clean, stocked high with food and organized in a structured way. People pile the food high on their plates and this results in the food disappearing off the serving platters faster than the chef's can put it down. But the chef's aren't phased and keep cooking as fast as they can. There is every type of food imaginable and there's no possible way a human could enjoy everything this buffet has to offer. But it's definitely worth a shot.   The Sunday Brunch Buffet is $26 for adults but it's absolutely worth it. I was told it's pricier because it's a seafood buffet. It's not your 5 star resort \"stuffy\" brunch but rather a nice quality casual buffet and probably the nicest one Phoenix has to offer for this price range and quantity. I will be back soon to try out the $9.99 buffet they offer on Saturdays.   This is absolutely the buffet to check-out in Phoenix. You'll walk away as in awe as I am."}
{"text":"Was pretty disappointed that I missed their breakfast buffet ($10) by 10 minutes, but was very satisfied with there lunch selection.  There's way too much food to list, but believe me, there's a big enough selection that you'll have more than enough to satisfy your craving.  If you're a big dessert person, there were pies, cakes, ice cream, and gelato galore.  Consider how many people and tables there were, service was very prompt.  My water and coffee remained filled the entire time."}
{"text":"We were really excited about going there for New Years Eve buffet. It was small buffet and very disappointing. It cost $67 a person plus tax and 18% tip they add on to the bill. The prime rib had no flavor at all. Beef and lamb was very chewy. The deserts were fair. Gelato was good and so was key lime pie. Everything else was terrible. The buffet at Casino Arizona is half the price and similar. For that kind of money it should have been a lot better. Wasn't even crowded. Place was empty all evening. service terrible. Called the manager today and all he said was thanks for letting us know I will tell the chefs. Thats it. Didn't seem to really care."}
{"text":"i love vegas buffets, and after a week of just falling off my healthy diet (visitors in town!), we took my father to the all you can eat crab legs tonight.   it did not disappoint. the crab legs were sawed in half lengthwise for ease of meat extraction. there were even lobster claws. and both shellfish were filled with meat...not skimping on the crab legs at all!!!! so basically, all we ate were crab legs and lobster claws. the lobster claws were a bit dry for me, but with unlimited melted butter to wash em down....oh well, lets just say it's a good thing my cholesterol test was postponed till next week.  the buffet is pretty extensive for such a small casino. there are numerous offerings from seafood, raw oysters (not bad, but not the best i've eaten), very good soups, an asian station, american meats and potatoes, pizza, sandwiches, and salad bar that was loaded with fresh fruit and veggies. the centerpiece is an island of delicious desserts...bananas foster (very sweet and very good), gelato, small portion desserts, and slices of delicious pies.   service was very good and our table was constantly cleared of plates and glasses. price was reasonable 27 bucks for crab leg nights, considering how ungodly the amount of crablegs we ate."}
{"text":"This review is based on Thursday lunch. If you're expecting the quality, variety and flavors of a Vegas buffet, you'll be disappointed. However, the food was fresh, tasty and of decent variety. Surprised there was no cold shrimp, a buffet staple. The brisket was tender, the fried chicken was crispy and well spiced, and the baked salmon was tender and flaky. Enchiladas very good. The Asian section didn't look great, and there were no shellfish at all. In all, it was worth the money, but nothing to get excited about. The staff were very attentive and polite, no issues there. Cleanliness and appearance were above average. I would compare this evenly with buffets in Reno."}
{"text":"Still a fan.  In fact, I ended up eating here two days in a row just due to schedule and circumstances.  The desserts are still top notch and I especially enjoyed the ice cream selections.  Both servers were excellent, they make sure you have everything you need and check in on your at reasonable intervals.  It's an easy, enjoyable meal.  Still a fan."}
{"text":"Average food with pretty much average choices. No idea why it has so many positive comments. Dessert had more choices. Ive had better food in other casinos outside AZ"}
{"text":"I went on a Sunday Brunch ( the most expensive) I cant deny there is  variety of food, but 90% taste of the buffet is horrible, the crab is super salty and rubbery, the oysters and clams are SANDY and tasteless ( the cheapest kind ) , the desert is horrible taste even the basics like cheesecake. Big waste of money, horrible chief(s)."}
{"text":"Tons of food! If you can't get your money's worth in shrimp and mimosas alone, you have no business going to a buffet PERIOD."}
{"text":"Let's see there are not enough words I can use to describe just how great this buffet was....so I will just put it this way:  Brick Oven Pizza.....Check  Mashed Potatoes....Check  Creme Brulee......Check  Shrimp Fried Rice....Check  Fried Shrimp.....Check  Chicken Casear Salad....Check  Clam Chowder.....Check  All Non-Alcoholic Drinks included......Check  KEY LIME PIE.....my favorite......Check  First Class Service......Check  Awesome Dining Area.....Check  Now that was just a small sampling of what was available at this establishment. If your into Red meat.....chips and dip....Bananas Foster...Sushi....Crab Ragoon....Gelato......Apple Pie....Cherry Pie....Fresh Fruit Parfaits.....Pasta.....etc.....I think you get my point.....They had all of that as well. Now it will cost you about 26 bucks per person....but it is TOTALLY WORTH IT.....I will definitely be back to try Sunday Brunch.   So let me wrap this up by simply saying this is the BEST BUFFET I HAVE EVER TRIED.....and trust me for those of you who know me that is saying something. So if your ever in need of a buffet dining experience or just simply hanging out at Casino Arizona here  in the valley of the Sun......run don't walk to The Wandering Horse Buffet.....I promise you won't be disappointed. Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends!!!!!"}
{"text":"Yes, I love buffets, especially great ones. This one in Scottsdale, basically within 20 minutes of home is shockingly good.  I went there on a Friday night yesterday for dinner before a concert. They had Asian, Mexican, Seafood, American, Cold Deli, Hot soups, Hot rotisserie meats, stunning variety of desserts, even some sugar free, Gelato. I had 2 heaping plates with chow main, duck, lamb, beef wellington, lobster claws, crab legs, grouper, cod, shrimp, shu mai,clam chowder, won ton soup.  So much more I wanted to try but wanted to be able to walk out :)  For dessert, I had a fruit tart, berry trifle and berry layer cake.  All good.  And they all stayed in my tummy.  I was satisfied and more.  It was worth the $ and a splurge.  I had good service. They added gratuity when you paid so it was convenient if you didn't have cash. I would return.  the only con is the allowance of smoking inside the casino so if I went into the restroom, smokers would exit."}
{"text":"Wandering horse buffet, which is located at walking stick resort and casino, was well worth the $14.95 weekday lunch price, which  includes your drink as well. The buffet has several different cuisines.   The dessert bar was definitely our favorite part of the meal. With various hand-dipped ice creams, pies, cakes, cookies, crepes, it was like a dream. I tried about 10 different desserts and they were all good.   I would say the biggest disappointment was the meat menu. the prime rib was very tough, the barbecue ribs were not tender, and the smoked salmon was just ok. the tangerine chicken was probably the best meat entree that I tried.   I would definitely go back, but it would be nice if the wandering horse would improve their protein!"}
{"text":"OMG! is all have to say, Went on a Thrusday for dinner, they had all I needed and wanted! Oysters on a shell. Peeled fresh Shrimp, Variety of delicious soups, Scallops!. Desert were AMAZING!!!! = ]"}
{"text":"We enjoyed the food, the desserts were awesome... don't skimp on the tip on the way in, the service is great, and we added to it on the way out."}
{"text":"Spendy, but nice atmosphere and great selection of food on a buffet.  You can't get a buffet this good anywhere else!  Dining on the outdoor patio is intimate and romantic. Space is limited.  The casino isn't bad too.  Stop by on your way out."}
{"text":"Very average. Would not recommend it. Other restaurants in casino are better....especially the seafood place near casino tables.  All the photos on Yelp were old and there was really nothing to write home about.  Seafood selection that was offered was limited to sushi.  All was just ok.    The staff was super friendly."}
{"text":"De do do do de da da da Is all I can eat with you De do do do de da da da Just keep stuffing my face and I'll pull through De do do do de da da da Is all I can say to you De do do do de da da da There's so many food and that is true! (Lyrics - Sting & Police - De do do do de da da da)  Wondering Horse Buffet is not your typical buffet around the valley.  They definitely have an edge on their competition.  Fresh seafood like king crab legs, shrimp cocktails, and oysters!  Yummy!  They also have hand cut prime rib and something strange, but very good -- pork belly slices!  So good and so wrong haha!  Along with my favorites, they have a plethora of cuisines from different regions.  Mexican, Asian, and Italian dishes spread across the buffet room, while a wood burning grill bakes up some fresh pizza.  My favorite in the buffet room is the dessert right dead center of the place.  The little cheesecakes, strawberry shortcakes, and brownies look so good you wouldn't want to eat it.  Nicely crafted into small figurine like statues; they're a work of art!  The place itself is very nice.  Great overview of what heard is to become a shopping center and pool area.  Wandering Horse Buffet is far back in the casino so might as well play your luck after a great dinner! - Cheers!"}
{"text":"This was a fantastic buffet and my mom really enjoyed her birthday brunch.  We had crab legs, oysters, shrimp, caviar, lamb, prime rib, antipasti, fresh salads, smoked meats, I could go on and on (and I did)!  I ate so much I nearly had to pass up the huge dessert bar, but managed to have a few cream puffs and some cheesecake :)  Plus, kids under 5 eat free so when you consider my mom, my son, and I all ate for around $60 it was very reasonable.    I am pretty sure we will go back for a gluttonous Easter feast on the patio.  They have fantastic views, too!"}
{"text":"Had a wonderful lunch here this week with some good Yelp friends, Rand H. Robyn N. and Mike C.!  I was a little skeptical at first based on the very high Yelp rating's and knowing it's a buffet but the Wandering Horse Buffet exceeded all my expectations.  It's an awesome place to dine with friends and family both for lunch and dinner.  The decor is nice, somewhat modern contemporary-ish with both tables and booths to choose from for seating.  They have a large bar on the middle of the dinning area as you go into the buffet area.  Relaxing colors through the dinning room with one wall full of windows with a view of the mountains in the back ground.  They have a nice patio area for when the weather permits.   The service was good.  They were very attentive to our needs and kept our table clean.  The price of $12.99 was exceptional considering the ginormous smorgasbord of culinary delights they offer!  The food was scrumptious!  They had just about everything including the kitchen sink!!  I wanted to try everything but there was no way I could, it's that large of a buffet, but I tried....    The Asian area had duck cooked at least three ways and several other options.  The Mexican area offered several traditional favorites including chili rellenos, fajitas and the best shrimp/scallop ceviche.  The prime rib was fantastic but the pork lion was a little dry.  The Italian area had the most wonderful mushroom filled spinach ravioli's in a lite cream sauce!  The smoked salmon salad and curry and vegetarian wantons are things I'll dream about until my next visit.  They were delicious!   There were so many other options to choose from, there is no way I could list them all in this Yelp review.  I'm looking forward to going back to the Wandering Horse Buffet, so I hope to see you there!"}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed in our experience here today. We went in for the Veterans Day deal and after standing in line for 45 minutes we were told the deal had ended. We ended up paying full price and eating anyway. The food was sub par. The crab legs were just OK and the oysters were BAD. The oysters even smelled bad! The pork loin was flavorless and the Mexican selection didn't make sense at all. The only thing that was good was the gelato/ice cream. Paid $100 for three people (one a child under 10) to eat and then paid an extra $18 for a double Jameson and Coke. This place was a complete rip off and their Veterans Day \"deal\" was a total scam.  The newspaper said nothing about the deal ending at 4pm."}
{"text":"Although the food is usually very good, as stated in my previous review, the policy here is strange and made our last visit a little awkward. Let me explain a little...  At every other buffet I've been to, if you're there during the change from breakfast to lunch, lunch to dinner, they simply change out the items on the line and you are free to continue eating; no big deal. At this buffet though, it doesn't operate that way.  We arrived just after 10 am. They let us know that lunch would begin at 11. We were okay with that. Once seated (after paying), they let us know that the buffet would be shutting down shortly and just to grab as many breakfast plates as possible because we wouldn't be allowed to go up again once the lunch items were out. Whaaat?  So we did just that. We filled up a number of plates and had very little space left on the table, and a lot of the food ended up being cold by the time we got to it. Goofy policy. It made what would've been a good experience into an uncomfortable one, food that would've been enjoyable into cold and not so enjoyable items."}
{"text":"After spending a couple hours at this buffet at a mini UYE for lunch today, I almost feel like I should downgrade every other buffet I've rated 5 stars to 4, because this one is as good as it gets.  It's definitely more upscale than The Buffet at Harrah's, both in atmosphere and food.  The dining room is separate from the buffet area and has large windows facing the Scottsdale Mountains.  The service was top notch, our plates were cleared quickly and drinks and water refilled often.  The food was excellent!  I started with salads, the spinach salad had fresh raspberries!  They even had fresh bleu cheese to go along with the bleu cheese dressing.  The fried calamari was some of the best I've had, not greasy, lightly breaded and even after sitting out tasted fresh and not rubbery at all.  There was a fantastic selection of cheeses and charcuterie served with dried fruits and veggies.  The smoked salmon and the baked salmon were perfect - and the prime rib of beef was done just right.    I can't forget the awesome dessert spread - the sticky toffee pudding was delicious (I wish I had another dish of it right now) and the gelatos, blood orange, mango and limoncello were the perfect end to a great meal.    I will have to come back for the Sunday brunch, the only thing that would make this better is unlimited mimosas and bloody marys!  And I left with $200 extra in my pocket!"}
{"text":"This buffet used to be one of the best in Phoenix. The value for the money was outstanding, and the 30 minute wait on a Sunday to get seated reflected it. Today, we got seated right away, and I noticed the dining room was operating at about 60% capacity. Now I know why: the food quality and selection has gone down from its heyday, and the pricing has gone up. That is a disastrous combo, and quite a disappointment to loyal customers.  Their crab legs used to be of top notch quality. Today, the crab legs were slimy and not very meaty. They stopped serving lamb chops (one of favorite menu items). Also, their delicious cranberry walnut crispy cookies were nowhere to be found. How could they possibly take those off the menu? Sad to say, we won't be coming back, due to the higher prices and lower food quality and selection."}
{"text":"Like a Vegas buffet, but in the Valley.  It's a bit pricy, maybe $5-10 less than the Wicked Spoon (our fav in Sin City) and not as big.  But they have a nice variety of food with decent quality and nearly as long a wait to get a table, plus you'll save 5 hours driving.  The night I was there the king crab legs were plentiful and delicious, there was leg of lamb and sirloin and the lava cake was legit.  Definitely worth a try if you are looking to pig out buffet style."}
{"text":"When a family member promised Sunday brunch at a casino, I didn't know what to expect. It left me speechless. Kobe Beef cooked to order, fresh crab legs, fresh mussels, fresh lobster tail, fresh prawns, smoked mussels, lamb. Friendly servers. Comfy tables."}
{"text":"Went here last night to celebrate our Anniversary, I am not a Buffet fan but the wife chose this place for our Anniversary Dinner. I was pleasantly surprised, Valet Parking, the food was fresh, lots of choices, Prime Rib, Excellent Dessert selection including Gelato. Do yourself a favor and give this buffet a try, you will love it! We will be back!  Also my wife won $100 on a slot machine on the way back to the car so that made the evening even more special!"}
{"text":"This is by far the worst buffet I have ever had in my life. If you are looking for something that is totally flavorless no matter which meat or item you pick, then this is your buffet. I take that back-the salmon definitely tastes like smoked salmon, but the Brazilian steak, tilapia, shrimp, no flavor whatsoever. Went back for General Tsos chicken, it's supposed to be spicy, and that was bland too! Even the cheesecake was totally dried out, you do not even want to try it. Not worth even 5 bucks, don't bother. Total disappointment. Not sure how this place got 4 stars at all."}
{"text":"Really a great Buffet Friday is LOBSTER night if you enjoy lobster you must go it was inexpensive great food  great server named Gulio  i had a great friday night dinner Go Go Go"}
{"text":"Meh, I know better. I do it anyway. All you can eat king crab. Precut by some machine I'm sure, hot when you get it, cold and smelling of the sea when you eat it."}
{"text":"The buffet is the best quality I've had with a big variety of tastes. I enjoyed the salad (spring mix), dressing and toppings but I wish there was romaine and other toppings, but who came to eat salad?  There were a lot of sides, I enjoyed the mashed potatoes, best ever charro beans, ok grilled corn, but I would have appreciated a roll. Maybe its a habit.  The meat was awesome, tasty medium well steaks, oven roasted chicken, honey ham, fried cod with tarter sauce, Korean BBQ ribs, Asian wings, all perfect.  The deserts were great too, pies, cheesecake, cake and gelato.  On a Thursday its about $20 for dinner.  For the price of an appetizer, entree and dessert at a nice restaurant you'll probably pay the same.  A vegetarian option or two and signs that note if they are vegetarian would be nice. But it seems that this buffet is more focused on meats which they excel at."}
{"text":"I was so disappointed with the saturday night king crab buffet. The crab legs were so overcooked and sad looking. They also had lobster claws, which were way overcooked and rubbery. What a waste of lobster. The only good item was the dessert, especially the pistachio ice cream. Delicious.  Will never waste money eating here again.  If you don't know how to cook seafood you shouldn't have it on the menu.  Since I am from New England I was dying for good crab...I should have known better !!!!!  It's a crime what the chef did to the crab legs and lobster claws."}
{"text":"I would say as far as Casino buffets in Az go..this one is the best and closest to Las Vegas quantity and quality.   Very reasonably priced for the assortment of food.  They had a lot of different ethnic fare and a wide variety of high quality desserts.  We both thought the prime rib was excellent as well as the salads and fresh seafood.  There can be a bit of a line.. the last time we visited was on a Sunday at around 6pm and I think we waited 45 minutes to be seated."}
{"text":"I came here today for a birthday get together for fellow Yelper Arana W.  Being a Saturday I was expecting the place to be slammed.  It was only about 1/3 full and it only took a few minutes to set up a table for 10.  In good weather there is additional seating on the patio.  This is a new building and I noticed the layout could be easily remodeled to a full service restaurant with a full bar and a private group dining room in place of the buffet serving area.  There were plenty of food choices and all I tried were good.  I have finally come to the conclusion that 2 plates of food plus dessert are all I can handle any more so I had my two plates of food and in that I had at least 20 different items in small portions.  I skipped the dessert trip (well I did try some of Arana's gelatos) because my next stop for the day was Sweet Republic.  Everybody had positive comments on the foods they had, including the desserts.  The service, both at the table and the serving area, was excellent.  We were there 2-1/2 hours and at no time did we feel rushed.  In fact they were still coming around refilling waters and drinks.  At $12.95 this is an excellent value and I am not sure why it wasn't packed as the casino itself was quite busy.  Lunch is only 11-3 and then they shut down and get ready for dinner, which I think starts at 5.    I very seldom think of a casino buffet as destination dining but this place sure comes close."}
{"text":"Thank you Fernando such sweet service !! Very good food! Steak was good and Mexican was good $14.99 yay!"}
{"text":"**** Brunch Buffet review:  I would best describe this as a wanna-be Bellagio Las Vegas buffet but missing the mark. The items are extensive and very well stocked. Service is decent but the quality that i have gotten from Las Vegas buffets just doesnt quite do it here.   The best part: The dessert station rocks!!!! Especially the only Gelato station in any buffet I have ever seen. Great diabetic friendly desserts as well."}
{"text":"If you haven't been to the Wandering Horse Buffett for Saturday morning breakfast, what are you waiting for?  It's from 8am to 10:30am, for $10.95 (plus tax)  per person,  but if in parties 6 or larger, gratuity is added, but with tax included its still under $14 bucks!    They have everything you could possibly think of, from breakfast burritos, omelet station, yogurt & granola, waffles, quiches, slabs of thick juicy bacon SLABS!!!!, chicken chow mien, Thai spring rolls, fried rice, general Taos chicken, donuts, pastries and more!    I have been quite a few times in the last 3 years and each and every time service was great and the food was delish! My family and friends really enjoy this breakfast spread!  If you haven't been, you really need to go, it's one of the best Saturday morning breakfast buffet I have been too."}
{"text":"aaah, breakfast, how I love you.  Why on earth would someone spend upwards of $10 for breakfast at fatty McD's when u can have fresh pineapple juice, smoked salmon, picture-perfect berries, firepit baked pastries, bacon literally sliced off the slab right before your eyes, and blueberry pancakes made in sight (not frozen), among many, many other surprises ..... ALL for $9.99 and UNLIMITED.  This, my friend, will start your day off right.  Yet, this is NOT your grandparent's cigarette-filled buffet.  It's a younger, lively, clean atmosphere with floor-to-ceiling windows giving a view to the golf course.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This buffet is the best ever in AZ! They have everything here from chinese, mexican, italian, and American food! The options are never ending! Prices is well worth it We love coming here. Their desserts are the best! You won't regret coming!"}
{"text":"I totally agree with Rand H.  WOW, the best buffet in AZ.  I went to the Sunday Brunch event with my family.  The service was first class.  I did not find 1 item that did not taste good.  Asian food, Mexican food, Italian food, and American fare was ALL good.   Desserts were so good.  Too bad it was to early in day, I could not try a bite of everything."}
{"text":"We tried this place over the wknd because my partner really digs seafood.  Probably the nicest and cleanest and well-appointed buffet in the area.   Staff for the most  part helpful and friendly but cashier and host could use a bit of polishing.  Very very limited choices if one doesn't consume meat or seafood.  They put meat/pork in everything!! - even the veggie rice had bacon in it!  But if you have no diet restrictions you will experience unlimited pleasure witnessed by my companion who loved the unlimited shell fish and would prob give Wondering Horse 5 stars. Ps....The $55 tab was quickly erased by winning a sizeable jackpot on the slots!"}
{"text":"My friend and I decided to head over for Sunday Brunch. I've been to the buffet once before and had a good experience. He had not been there before. The line to get in wasn't too bad. It moved quickly.   Our waitress was friendly. There was a good variety of food; mexican, asian, italian, seafood. We both really enjoyed the prime rib and lamb chops. I love that they have gelato for dessert. My friend and I both left satisfied. We will be back."}
{"text":"Super expensive and nothing blew my mind.  The waitress seemed to forget about our table and the meat was over cooked."}
{"text":"The food i had was ok and the selections were smaller than i thought for a casino buffet. They had a little mexican, asian, and American food. Our waiter was great, she made sure we had drinks filled when needed and check to make sure we were good on sauces and other things. Large dessert selection, some yummy and some not so good. I didnt car for the cake or cheese cake. I loved the key lime pie it was delicious.  It was clean coming in and bathrooms were clean. Three stars because for the high price they should have a larger selection of food. And some better choices of food. I dont think i will be coming here again. Not unless someone paying for me lol."}
{"text":"WOW can you say HEAVEN?   All you can eat amazing food?!  Yes Please!  I wanted to make sure I tried everything I could get my hands on and believe me I tried nearly everything minus a few things here and there. But it gives me an idea of what to expect next time and what not to get. My personal favorite as far as little appetizers would have to be the pork potstickers the endless cocktail shrimp,& half shell oysters.  For main course I love love LOVED the Kobe beef. It was cooked just the way I like it medium rare-ish. The flavor was good but would be even more stellar with some A1. The prime rib lacked flavor but was definitely tender and right in color.  I tried the wild boar Bacon and it was eating like a piece of salty Ham. I'm a little weird when it comes to Bacon because I would rather cook things with it and put it in things than eating it alone as a strip. If you love Bacon for the flavor I recommend this unless you need the crispiness like I do somewhat.   Other things I tried and didn't love as much were the Asian drums in heaven or whatever it was called, the crab wonton wrapped things, the shrimp and mushroom risottto almost tasted like it wasn't finished cooking  & The red chili beef and the shrimp ceviche. As you can tell some things were just hit or miss. But the things I loved I loved with all my heart. So I have a better idea on my plate choices next time.  Let's move on to dessert shall we?  creme brulee was good the texture of the custard reminded me of jello but it was still superb regardless of the jelloy effect :/ The little chocolate crepes were one of my all time favorites,  and a certain cookie to the left on the top shelf that was like eating a crisp sweet wafer were oh so good or like toffee without the effect where it sticks to your teeth! I didn't dip into all the cakes and pies because no restaurant can beat my pies and cheesecakes and cakes. So I passed them up without a doubt along with the little tarts. I Hated the little strawberry shortcake parfait cup. *shivers* gelato here we go.... Prickly pear-different but tasty. Lemon ciello-good but way too much texture for me. I like smooth gelato.  Blood orange-FAVORITE!!!!!! I went on a Sunday before the closed and I know for next time I will go for lunch they way I don't have to pay 27.95. I like the sound of 13.95-20.95 better. :)"}
{"text":"Have I had better quality food at a buffet, yes. Have I had better selection at a buffet, only once (la Paloma, Tucson). But hot dang is this well priced for Scottsdale and the selection of salad, seafood, Asian, breakfast (omelette station also) carving board, meats section, Mexican, Italian, and dessert allows for a need to be rolled outta there! $36 gets you all you can eat AND all you can drink mimosas, bellini's, or bloody mary's. With the mountains as the back drop, the patio is one the best spots to eat Sunday brunch. Today's quantity, 5 breakfast plates and 1 dessert plate"}
{"text":"Great time on a Wednesday night here at The Wandering Horse. Prime rib was very good with a nice herbed crust. Good to spend time with friends. Beautiful Fanny Bay oysters on the buffet too! The best part was the service from Miss Faye! What a beautiful lady inside and out! She took such great care of our party. They are lucky to have her there! Ask for Miss Faye and leave her big tips, she deserves it! Our first time here and definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Never had a bad experience at this buffet. The price to eat is a little steep but honestly the food is worth the price. I've been here around 4-5 times now and it has always been great. Most recently, I visited on Christmas Day for the buffet. It was roughly $60/person (not bad considering the holiday and food selection). Each person also got 3 Mimosas or Champagne glasses with their meal. The chefs were all VERY nice and helpful if you had a question about allergies. Their food selections always offer endless plate options. I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a classy buffet with amazing food."}
{"text":"My my my. This is the buffet to patron if you like luxury items including seafood, duck, and gelato. We ate for about an hour because we wanted to try everything. Spoiler alert: it all rocked. The service, the food, the atmosphere, the house Chardonnay. Ten out of ten. Just don't overdo it (like me), you'll get a tummy ache if you have two of everything. Or do...I can't say I regret it!"}
{"text":"I've waited a couple of days to update my review. While the food is still good, I'm disappointed in the way management addressed my concerns on my last visit.  I bit into a large bone in the tuna salad, it was hard enough and sharp enough that I wasn't quite sure it even came from a fish, and instead of bothering my server or making a scene I opted to go to the quiet, unoccupied section of the bar to wait to let the manager know. I stood there for about 5 minutes until a gentleman and woman arrived to talk to me.  I wanted them to know that it was sharp enough it could have cut me and there are lots of children and older people, in the establishment and this poses a choking/safety hazard as nobody expects to find this in something soft and mushy like tuna salad. I was not trying to get comped, I told them I wasn't hurt, I just wanted to show them so that they would throw out the batch of tuna salad.  Now my husband is a restaurant manager himself and while he was disappointed that   they did not come to our table I mean this is a nice place it's not McDonald's or something, it was what happened on our way out that is what's prompting me to write this review.  As I was leaving I made eye contact with the female manager and walked right by her and  waved. She watched us go without uttering a single word.   This is what sets apart restaurants for me , a good manager who cares about their patrons would have asked how the  rest of our meal was, and apologize again for the incident earlier etc.  I felt dismissed and unappreciated as a returning and loyal customer. To me that's just bad service and unkind management. If I go out of my way to be nice to you and not be a crappy patron looking for a freebie you should have enough decency to address me on the way out of the restaurant.  The management can use a refresher a customer service. I've had better table touching and concerns addressed at an Applebee's."}
{"text":"This has got to be the best buffet in the area I've had so far. I've gone to the Brazilian BBQ, which I do love, and the tomatoes place, which is a bargain. However,  The Wandering Horse has the most variety, and bang for your buck, so far. I mean, where else can you get Prime rib, King Crab legs (with shell cut in 1/2), omelette's to order, and a wide range of desserts for $35? Oh, and it also includes 3 alcohol beverages. Needless to say, we walked out of there stuffed. It's well worth it, and we did not wait very long to be seated. On the downside, the beverage service was a little slow, but hey, I'm still giving it a five star, as it was a bit busy on Sunday afternoon. We'll definitely be back. Probably not for a little while though. Can't eat at a buffet every weekend, if you know what I mean."}
{"text":"Finally, they got their act together, and now offer 3 drinks limit for everyone. At least that's settled. Now, the food. They used to have great crab legs, prime rib, lamb lollipops with mint jelly, and kobe beef steaks. The mashed potatoes used to be creamy and homemade tasting. There was coconut shrimp. Today, the price has jumped greatly, no more kobe beef, just sirloin steaks. The prime rib is \"raw\" and seasonless. And I love rare prime rib. Cheap lamb sirloin with no mint jelly. Crab legs are huge, but frozen and tasteless. We used to go to brunch almost every sunday, but no more. Tried it this weekend, and no way it was worth the price. It used to be. Management, please listen!"}
{"text":"I tried a little of most things and I can say that the meat was tough, the food was almost all cold, the flavors were pretty blah. I did like the mashed potatoes and gravy though and the cheese cake was pretty good."}
{"text":"I have been to this buffet several times. I attend a conference here each year,  It is clean, servers are attentive.  Wide variety of good buffet style food. Love the made to order omelets. My only complaint. Today as we sat enjoying our coffee while eating breakfast, we were told we had to leave as they were closing, Don't ruin a good thing by kicking people out. Tell them the kitchen is closed and let them finish their meals."}
{"text":"The family and I (party of 7) decided to come here New Years Eve to stuff ourselves before the big ball drop. From the mountain of endless crab legs, to the savagely delicious lamb shanks, this buffet is worth the price of admission.   This buffet is better than most Las Vegas buffets. Yes, I said it. Do yourself a favor and spend a little more at this buffet than your typical cardboard-tasting Chinese buffet - you won't regret it."}
{"text":"came for fathers day (hubbies request) and brought my parents with us. the price was pretty heavy for the amount of food that me, my sister, and mom eat but worth it for the guys. the wait was a bit long but thats understandable since it was fathers day. been here before and thought the food was pretty great but this time we were all pretty disappointed. not sure what happened but none of us left satisfied. not sure if it was due to the holiday but you would think with the increase in price the food would be better then a normal brunch."}
{"text":"This dining experience was wonderful.  The food selection extensive,  so many seafood choices. The service impeccable,  and  deserts to die for.  The staff was attentive and prompt even with our large party. It was options available for all diets.  Was happy to take visiting guests here because everyone found something to eat and everyone left full."}
{"text":"I've never been a huge fan of buffets but this one was probably the best buffet I have gone to! It's more upscale than most and everything I tried was really good.  There are many selections like most buffets. Ranging from pizza, pastas, meats, etc   My favorite was the desserts! Soooo many options! More options than I've ever seen. I love that they have gluten free and sugar free dessert options as well."}
{"text":"Horrible Service - Waiters stand in the corner and chat rather than refill drinks."}
{"text":"Nice options and you can even eat healthy if you want.  Good Salmon and Shrimp."}
{"text":"This is by far the BEST buffet I have eaten at in the Phoenix area!!! We were here a few weeks ago for dinner, and again today for the Sunday Brunch.   The selection is enormous. And so good... there is so much seafood options to choose from.   What I hate about buffets in general is that the food is usually cooked poorly when cooked in large quantities... but that is totally not the case here. All the meat and fish I sampled were cooked perfectly.   This venue is very comparable... if not better than most buffets in Vegas!!!   Sunday Brunch was $26.... but well worth it. Besides... you can earn your money back for your meal at the slot machines!"}
{"text":"Can't beat the amount of crab legs you get for the price you pay. Sometimes I only come and eat just the Alaska King Crab legs that are pretty cut. A little secret, you can ask the cook to steam them for you.   Please note: I am an employee of Casino Arizona and Talking Stick Resort. The views expressed in the post are my own. They have not been reviewed or approved by Casino Arizona and Talking Stick Resort."}
{"text":"We have heard of Casino buffets and the lavish spread. We wanted to try the one in Phoenix and landed up in Talking stick for my husbands bday.   We went on a monday and it was crowded, we were seated immediately. It was a vast spread ranging from Thai, Mexican, American, Italian. You could eat whatever you want and I was really overwhelmed with so many options. Honestly the quality of the food was not great, I mean the quantity was varied but the taste was missing. I was impressed by the look and feel but not looking to go for the food.    My one star goes to the dessert category, they have amazing options and loved the sugar free ones too.   Overall a good buffet for a $25 on weekdays. The service is good and the place is clean."}
{"text":"I've been to this buffet for breakfast, weekday dinner, and Sunday brunch and I must say, this buffet is legit.  Their breakfast is only about 12 bucks including tax and a drink and it's completely worth it!!! There are fresh cooked omelets served the way you like them or sunny side up eggs and tons of meat selections including two choices of bacon, ham, sausages, steak, and even chicken. Then there's salmon and different salsas with a variety of breads.  They also have hash browns, country potatoes, biscuits and gravy, French toast and donuts. This might sound odd but there was Chinese food served for breakfast too lol! I love the rice congee! Also for all you healthy eaters, there are fresh berries and oatmeal along with cottage cheese.  They even have dessert for breakfast!  Dinner is around 25 bucks per person but this includes fresh seafood such as large shrimp cocktails and fresh raw oysters. Prime rib, mashed potatoes, veggies and many more meats r served including a variety of pastas and pizzas and different specialty cheeses. There isn't much seafood though but they have much of the same items from breakfast besides the typical breakfast dishes. Dessert is the best part. Honestly the food is good but it's nothing compared to Vegas buffets  The brunch includes everything from breakfast and dinner combined. The only difference is that they give u champagne and also have lobster claws, king crab, stone crab claws and some sushi and more meats. The lobster claws are not good because they have no flavor and the sushi tastes like you can get it at the supermarket. But I do like all the other foods during brunch.   The reason I gave it five stars is because the food is higher quality for AZ and is worth the price because it would be the same price if I were to go to outback for a prime rib dinner so minus well go to an upscale buffet. But this buffet ain't got nothing on the Vegas buffets. If I had to choose between this one and the rio world buffet in Vegas, which is about the same price, I would definitely choose the rio hands down! Obviously the caesar's palace  buffet is way better so I can't compare, especially with the price difference. But for AZ this buffet is worth it to go to and has a nice atmosphere as well as good food and service."}
{"text":"Had lunch with my Husband here today, we sat outside, it was gorgeous weather, the food is really Great, good variety, of ethnic foods !!!  Not bad for the price !!!"}
{"text":"#200 review!! Went for brunch and was scared of the menu. As soon as I saw everything the offered it didn't matter!! EVERYTHING IS AMAZING!! Mashed potatoes are the best I've ever had, the gelato bar was so cool and plenty of crab legs, oysters, and prime rib to go for days!  So glad my boyfriend brought me here for a spontaneous brunch. Mimosas are a must they do not gip you on the champaign portion!"}
{"text":"Was not expecting the food to be so good at the buffet. We did the seafood buffet on a Saturday night and most of the food was excellent. The service was also amazingly good. Great value for the money in my opinion.   Brenda provided great service."}
{"text":"I ate here with my husband as the guest of a local resident who loves this place. He surprised us! I've heard good things about Talking Stick but had never seen it. The buffet restaurant is in a huge area, constructed in in a big curved shape, with all open windows on one side for a very airy atmosphere. The restaurant also featured outdoor balcony seating and the building cleverly shades it.  The choices were amazing as was the quality of the food! So much for my diet! It was one of those places where you want to try this and that. They segment the food by location, such as Mexican, Asian, Italian, etc. Some items I ate, because I LOVE variety and tasting everything: Vegetable curry samosa, Thai eggroll, barbecue chicken (Asian), sesame chicken, asparagus (really fresh ones), (I skipped all the noodly dishes to save room for the other stuff), salmon (really perfectly cooked), smoked salmon and salmon salad (ALL great), chile relleno,a teeny tiny slice of turkey with a special apple cranberry sauce, sundried tomatoes and yellow peppers, a blueberry cheese (sounds weird, but VERY good), one ravioli (tasted and looked like a pesto-based sauce), and tastes of a few desserts that I shared with Gary.  I did not try the tasty-looking salads or soups, instead going for the more serious or unique offerings.  Desserts: a fruit pastry, red velvet cake (yum-the server said the employees really hit up on that dessert!), delicious gelatos (I had hazelnut chocolate and something) and a few other goodies. I believe lunch was around $13.95, a great value for the quality and quantity of foods available.  I would certainly come here again for the ambiance, food choices, quality and overall experience. Really classy place, even with a casino. It is located just east of the 101, easy to get to. Parking is free, on property."}
{"text":"We just love this Buffet... The dessert island is awesome, large and even includes a station where you can get Banana's Foster, and more. The Creme Brulee is very good as well. The dessert section goes on and on.  The Asian. Mexican and Italian stations can be good but it is bit hit and miss. Salad Cheese and Meat stations are superb.   There coffee excelent, IMHO. Prices vary on time and day of the week. Enjoy, this is a consistantly yummy meal!"}
{"text":"A bit more than your typical casino buffet.  Firstly, its hidden towards the north end of the main casino floor before the lobby w/ elevators to 270 Degrees.  The line moved pretty quickly when we were here: 8:30 on a rainy Sat morning. The seating in this place is very lux for a buffet. And theres plenty of it: both tables w/ chairs and booths. Theres a nice patio and view out the floor to ceiling windows at the north side of the dining room. It looks like theres a small bar here as well, but it wasnt open during our visit.   The actual buffet room is smaller than a lot of other ones Ive seen, but has a great selection of items. Fruit and breakfast items including slab pepper bacon. Chinese and Mexican items, plenty of breakfast pastries, and cakes/pies. An omelet station (theyre large), and a gelato station (they give you a melon ball sized scoop). The food was pretty good. Id say the omelet was the best thing I had. our waitresses were very attentive at first. There was a 45 minute period where we couldnt find anyone for water or coffee refills though.  Overall, a decent breakfast at a decent price ($9.95 on Sat morning, all you can eat)."}
{"text":"very good!  Lots of food choices, the desserts were amazing!"}
{"text":"Stayed at Talking Stick for a Staycation birthday, and have always heard \"how great\" this Buffet is. Came on a Saturday night with a group of 6. Line is long so be prepared for a wait. Once at the counter our group was charged with auto-gratuity charge, for having 6 people. I always have a tough time with auto gratuity charges at Buffets since it's primarily self serve...not to totally nitpick. $96 dollars later for just my husband and I, my expectations were high. They did have a pretty wide range in options but it all looked and tasted like heat lamp food. Food all tastes the same after sitting out long enough under heat lamps. Although there was crab legs in plenty, wasn't fresh. Service was efficient with drinks (thumbs up). Dessert had a ton of choices, and Gelato was tasty. If you love buffet food and have to buffet I give this a mediocre attempt at a Vegas Buffet. All in all I say spend the $96 bucks on a nice dinner somewhere else in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"We have had several dozen good to great meals here.  Today, I found a hair in my mashed potatoes.  Well...the manager came over to ask about it.  She said that she would tell the chef.  I'll be back, but it will be with a different type of anticipation."}
{"text":"First time, Monday lunch buffet, 12:30 - 2pm, group of 8 people... Cost was $17.57 each, paid prior to eating ($13.95, plus they automatically added gratuity).  PROS:  Clean & comfortable table/chairs, fair selection of food choices (salad/fruit, beef brisket, mashed potatoes, fish, Chinese, Mexican, pizza, desserts).  CONS:  Service was awful...Drinks never refilled until we asked (20min with empty glasses, twice), used plates never removed from table.  Old cheese cubes had brittle/dry edges, jerky-dry fish, very limited vegetables, overall very slow food rotation for many dishes.  Do not plan to return and would not likely recommend, although friends had good reviews of dinner and brunch buffets...maybe their lunch crew just wasn't good today."}
{"text":"I have visited this buffet three times, twice for breakfast and once for dinner over the past few years. Today was breakfast. As a vegetarian there are always more options to enjoy at breakfast vs. lunch and dinner. Best of all, the breakfast is always the cheapest meal. Today's meal was about $12 inclusive of tax.   First the good: Although there was a line of about 15 or so people when we arrived, the line moved fast and we were seated in less than 5 minutes. The dining room is clean and the waitstaff was attentive and friendly.   The run of the mill: The food was OK. Nothing to crow about but one has to manage expectations. Had eggs, hash browns, fruit, French toast, potatoes O'Brien and quiche. The flavor was on par with a Denny's or other chain breakfast place.   The bad: My potatoes O'Brien were cold when I got back to my table, other than that nothing to complain about.  Observation: Amazed by people who complain about Wandering Horse not being Vegas and food not as expected. Well, it's not Vegas, manage your expectations. Also, you are paying about the same for a meal as at a sit down burger restaurant. Rather than having a burger, side dish and drinks, people expect multiple trips, unlimited beverages and sweets for the price of a regular meal elsewhere. I like to see you get crab legs, prime rib (unlimited) sushi, etc.. for $30 elsewhere.   I would say Wandering Horse is a decent buffet, with good food in a clean, modern environment with friendly staff at a reasonable cost."}
{"text":"No attention to detail. After one of the diners in my party found a piece of cardboard in her food, I notified the sous chef, who notified the manager.  We were told her name was Denise.  The lack of concern for accommodating my guest was appalling.  I expected them to at least comp her meal, but she only offered my guest a drink. If this low level of concern exists for what a guest finds in their food, then who knows what goes on where we cannot see. No apology from the manager,  no explanation on how it might have happened,  and no gratitude for pointing out a problem.   Another in my party got insenced and insisted on finding the casino mgr to share the story. He was angry because the one who found the cardboard was his Mother. The casino manager empathized completely and took good care of my party. Thank you."}
{"text":"Came back here to try the breakfast which seemed a little better than the dinner. Everything was mediocre at best. Eggs were overcooked, quiche was soggy, and there was just a regular array of foods. The price was okay at only $10 with drinks, but noting worth going out of my way for. The desserts look nice but they are more about quantity than quality. One good thing though is that the lady who made my omelet was incredibly nice and the omelet was great. To be perfectly honest this buffet is the equivalent or worse than golden corrals breakfast buffet. I would not recommend this buffet."}
{"text":"The waiter service here is horrible. There is no personal interactions, lack of table cleanup and beverage refills. When we ask for help it still took another 10 minutes. We are sitting here again with a table full of Plates and no help. They automatically take gratuity witch is bull crap as this server does not deserve a tip."}
{"text":"Came here for their breakfast buffet with the UYE crew (happy birthday to Monica O!) We arrived at 8 and waited a few minutes to pay and be seated for our large group. It was nice to get there early and avoid the lines. FYI: for parties of 6 and more, a gratuity is automatically added. Coming to a total of $16 and some change, it's a great deal.   I didn't have a plan of attack, just wanted to get whatever appealed to me, but I had to get a second plate and split up the savory and sweet dishes. There is a lot to choose from, including a customized omelette, quiches, breads, pancakes, French toast, waffles, oatmeal, fruit, yogurt, rice, tofu, chicken, breakfast meats, donuts and more. The staff is great about getting your drinks and clearing your finished plates.   At the end of it all, no matter how stuffed I am, I always have to get some gelato because it's delicious and not heavy. Sunday morning brunch is more expensive because they offer more variety including crab legs, but Saturday has a lot as well and I like the price more."}
{"text":"I thought this buffet was okay. Granted, it was really bang for the buck and definitely a lot nicer than normal buffets in the Phoenix area, but I didn't feel like it was that awesome.   First of all, the selection was quaint, but a little bit meager - except the dessert. I think there was just as much dessert as there was every thing else. The food was all right, but nothing tasted so good that I wanted any more of it. The prime rib looked really nice, but was actually very tough and chewy. The red velvet cake also looked really good, but the cake was dry and the icing was too much. Everything else was pretty forgettable. Still, if I were to spend money on a buffet, this one would be worth it. I just wasn't blown away."}
{"text":"Normally, my boyfriend and I eat at Ocean Trail every time we go to Talking Stick because we love it so much, but we have heard great things about the buffet. So, this past weekend while we were staying here, we decided it was time to try it. We went for the dinner buffet ($26 bucks, not super cheap, but whatever). It was delicious! First of all, it's the cleanest buffet I've ever been to. Which is nice, because it takes your mind off of the fact that youre about to eat multiple plates of food and hate yourself for it (is there a way NOT to overdo it at a buffet?). I also like the fact that the buffet part and the dining are are separate so you're not looking at the food the whole time you're there. The food was great. We tried several different things but my favorite was the seafood ravioli in vodka sauce- YUM. Also, i thought the best dessert was the cannolis. Anyway, everything we tried was pretty good and we will definitely return one day when we've forgiven ourselves for how much we ate at dinner on Friday. The lunch and breakfast buffets looked like they were about half the price of the dinner so I definitely want to try them out one day. It would be better if they included unlimited drinks too....I can dream."}
{"text":"This place is so worth it.  Anywhere you can get smoked salmon, prime rib, and crab legs is sure to win me over.  However, the sides are also amazing, everything is.  Most buffets have a few downfalls or cheap items, but every single thing I tried was quality.  The salad....I wanted another plate, but would have been so sad if I didn't have room for the beef and crab.  Being an adult is tough, but choosing dessert here is not.  So many mini options, I didn't even consider making  a decision.  I chose them all, and loved them."}
{"text":"YELP BREAKFAST CLUB...this was the place for July. First time for me here for breakfast. Can't beat $11 for all you can eat. Defintely had something for everyone. Breakfast buffet, chinese/asian buffet, gelato bar, fruit/yogurt bar, fresh danishes and donuts and much more all during breakfast time. Food was good, quality of food not bad either.Only downside is we got there early to beat alot of the crowds and our service was pretty bad, server was slow at getting drinks and coffee out and she wasnt even busy, just slower than a snail. We will all be back again in a few months for another breskfast club event :)"}
{"text":"Review is for Sunday brunch.  The selection is solid, the price is ok ($33+tax pp), and, fittingly, the food is a gamble.  There are some winners and losers on any buffet but I felt like this one had a lot of losers.    Going around the loop, you first see soup and smoked fish (scallops, salmon, mussels).  These were terrible.  Whoever cooked those should be removed from the kitchen and put on maintenance duty where they'll be better suited.  There are numerous salad selections and the mozzeralla on the Caprese salad was about the same consistency as a hockey puck.  The carving area had a few nice choices but unfortunately they were all of poor quality.  The prime rib was very undercooked and full of grizzle, the pork loin was ok but overcooked, and the fresh cut bacon was cold rubber.  You could ask them to grill it up after cutting it but I think hot food is a must have from the buffet.    The Asian selection was actually pretty good.  The shumai were good and the rest of the selections were better than average.  The seafood is right next to this which is the other somewhat bright spot (so you should probably spend your whole time in this corner).  Regarding the seafood, the shrimp were decent but the lobster claws tasted as if they'd been frozen since the Eisenhower administration.  The crab legs, while also clearly frozen since the dawn of time, were of much better quality.  I'd recommend soaking the crab meat in drawn butter to rehydrate and heat it.    Desserts are abundant and, again, hit or miss.  The mini creme brulee was basically a war crime while the mini tiramisu was delicious.  For drinks, the included champagne is cheap but does the trick.    Some to like...so much to dislike.  A decent brunch but if you're going to spend about $40/pp after tip you might as well splurge and go somewhere high end like the Wrigley Mansion."}
{"text":"This place is a favorite lunch stop for my wife and I, whenever we're in this part of the valley. At about $30 plus tip for two it isn't the cheapest lunch, but the food is generally good quality, with some items, notably the steaks and chops, being very good. My wife's favorite part of the buffet is the Gelato bar, which she abuses sparingly. If I have one criticism, it's that the soup offerings are poor, they used to have an amazing Irish Lamb soup, but I haven't seen that in over six months. The beef stew is good as well, honestly, give us something besides creamed lintels for a soup choice. Anyway, if you're near here, and have the time, give it a try."}
{"text":"Came here  for the first time today with my family and was wowed beyond belief with the great food and service here. Definitely a marvelous place and will be returning"}
{"text":"I have a girlfriend who is a gambling devotee, so, knowing she would jump at the chance to eat a good meal, since she quit cooking and loves to gamble, I got her to go with me to Wandering Horse. First off, I have never been to Talking Stick before despite several meetings that I wanted to attend but couldn't for one reason or another.  So, this was my first visit to Talking Stick.Talking Stick was a nice surprise:  no smoke smell.  Love it! Architecturally it is quite beautiful, clean--even the ladies' room is super clean--and, since this was a weekday, there was no problem getting a close parking space to the elevator in the parking garage.  If you don't get into the garage you can also park in their huge parking lot. The food is a pretty decent quality, gobs of selections and it appears that everything is made there as I saw a guy making pizzas and another grilling steaks on some huge George Foreman looking-type grill. I had various treats like smoked salmon, steak, tri tip steak, raw shrimp fajitas and the carmel gelato with sea salt which is my favorite...yummo! You can eat so much as you want, you can drink so much as you want.  This is just a fat girls' dream I said pinching myself!!!  I love this place! So, I ate and ate and ate till I was stuffed, which made walking out of the place difficult since I've been on a diet and my stomach is pretty shrunk. But I was in heaven, anyway, even with a stomach ache. The service was great, and we had a small Asian gal offering to bring us drinks every time she came even within 5 feet of our table, so no complaints about the service.  She was really great, deserved a big tip and she got it when we left. The neat thing about eating here is that you can gamble a little if you want after gorging on their food--and we did.  We played the slots for a few hours, too, which was alot of fun especially since we both won. This was a really fun day!  Granted, I ate one 100 calorie dietary ice cream bar for dinner cause I was so stuffed from early lunch (and I even had to choke that down), but I sit here with memories of a really great meal and fun time at the slots. I am definitely going back here when I feel like pigging out on alot of good food again. For the $15+ for lunch, this place is a realllly great deal!!!  UPDATE:  Breakfast here, to me, was a big letdown considering the lunch buffet.  A few bucks cheaper and loads of wonderfulness down.   The lunch buffet is great...breakfast not so much.  Won't do it again."}
{"text":"I went here with some work friends and the buffet was pretty good. It came out to 17 dollars because we had a pretty large group and they included the tip.  I pretty much had everything they had to offer. I started off with their mexican food and it was actually really good with the variety of salsas they had to choose from. I used them all and the blend was quite tasty.  I then moved onto their mashed potatoes, vegetables, and sirloin. It was pretty tasty, but it wasn't to die for.  After that, I made a small plate of their Chinese food selection. To be honest, the selection was that great. I had some kung pao chicken that was below average (it didn't have any peanuts in it) with some low mein and orange chicken, rice, and spring roles. I put some sweet and sour sauce on the side. The spring roles were also below average. The orange chicken, low mein, and rice was average.  I then had to try their pizza. Sadly, it wasn't very good. They had some chicken pizza, cheese pizza, and then pepperoni pizza. I went with the pepperoni pizza. It was lacking sauce and it just wasn't very good. Although you can see them making the pizza, it tasted like it was a bad frozen pizza. Maybe I grabbed a slice that had been standing out for a while. I am not sure.  Lastly, I finished the meal off with some really good ice cream and an OK cookie. The ice cream was carmel chocolate with cookie chunks. Really good stuff.  Overall, the service for refilling our drinks was very good. They were very quick to pick up our old plates.   For 17 bucks, this buffet isn't bad, but I wouldn't rave about it or try and get my friends to go there with me. It def isn't a place that you \"have to go to\"."}
{"text":"One of the best buffets that I've had. The Sunday Brunch may be expensive, but well worth it. The chilled crab legs are super sweet. I don't recommend you have them heated up because it loses its sweetness that way. You must try the cranberry laced, pecan,  brown sugar cookies (which I believe they only serve during brunch), they are the best.  I must get that recipe. Hurry though, they run out of these pretty fast."}
{"text":"came here after golfing a few weeks ago. i forget how much it was but im thinking 25-30$.   Seemed a little low on food but did get some nice steak and lots of other things that i cant remember but i do remember the key lime cheesecake and went back for more of it. overall it was just ok, nothing too special but probably will go back to check it out again"}
{"text":"Went there for Easter brunch with my family and it was excellent. There was a wide variety of food and I especially enjoyed the carving station and wide selection of desserts. This is the closest Arizona comes to a Vegas style buffet. The service was also excellent."}
{"text":"Best buffet in the Valley!! They give you the right portion so you don't have any leftovers in your plate. Were else can you find a buffet that serves, Kobe Beef and Lamb Chops, which are freshly cooked. They were excellent. Even the Gelato was delicious, but I wish they had more flavors.  Downside was the oysters which were dry from sitting too long and the macaroons were burnt.  We ate dinner there several times and enjoyed the atmosphere and service. We will be back to try their breakfast and lunch."}
{"text":"The food at the Wandering Horse Buffet is truly amazing. I have been dining here for years and the menu they serve is always delicious. There Chef has a great menu and is always adding different seasonal items. We love to come on holidays, they always make us feel like a part of there family.  My friends, family & loved ones will be returning as long as we live in the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"Here I am: a twenty-something lady trying to eat healthier for the New Year. More turkey, less ground beef. More veggies, less fries. More water, less Pepsi. And then Monica O. pops in announcing it's time for another Breakfast Club UYE. \"Fantastic!\" I think excitedly to myself, \"I can try somewhere new and I'm sure that wherever we go, they'll have healthy options to help me adhere to my resolutions. I'm definitely in!\"   It's a buffet.   Technically, this means it gives me even more opportunity to be good. It's a buffet! Pick and choose to your little heart's content! But IT'S A FREAKING BUFFET. I mean, I started off well enough by ordering myself a glass of water and an orange juice (included in the Saturday morning $9.99+tip price), but it all went downhill from there (in a very good way... that is, unless you're my waistline).  Cheesy sausage and spinach omelet, pile of bacon, pile of sausage links (OH NO I never tried their sausage patties!!), hash browns galore, bacon, fingerling potatoes, fresh strawberries, blackberries, raspberries, and then an additional pile of bacon. They had yogurt that I probably should have eaten and also a dude available to toast you some bread of your choosing. But instead I was staring at the giant slab of peppered meat that ended up being more bacon, which they slice right there and fry up in front of you. After that, I wandered over to the donuts where I waddled back to my table with a second plate of cake donut and lemon poppyseed muffin. Everything was yummy. The bacon and hash browns were crispy, the omelet was not overcooked, and I made sure to eat everything I could of that scrumptious muffin. Have I ever told you that I love breakfast? Because I do.   I'll get back on that diet horse tomorrow."}
{"text":"I went with a party of six prior to a show in the nearby showroom.  It's a great place to go if you are in a hurry.  The buffet food is first rate, especially the steaks, cheeses, shrimp, desserts, and gelato.  The mushroom pasta was fantastic. Even excellent pizza slices.  We'll definitely go back.  The only thing which keeps it from getting five stars is that the $25 price is a bit high and it lacks sushi which I've come to expect at buffets."}
{"text":"Had the dinner buffet here recently with my wife and kids (under 10 years old).  First off, the dining area is immaculate...very classy indeed.  Second, the service was impeccable...our glasses were always filled and our used plates/bowls always promptly removed. Service was with a smile, not obligatory.  With regard to the food, I would say it was a \"mixed bag\" for me.  I thoroughly enjoyed the savory prime rib, and had two helpings.  I sampled through the other areas and enjoyed the oven baked pizza and mushroom ravioli.  The breads, cheeses and olives were very good, as was the gumbo (add some tabasco) and won ton soup (heavenly).  The asian chicken wings were explosions of flavor, but  mexican style dishes did not seem too appetizing so I skipped them all together.  The shrimp were large and succulent (boiled, they also have the fried variety).  THe desserts were reflective of the buffet in general (some good others so so), but I would have to recommend the gelato (many many varieties).  Overall, I would agree that the buffet is smaller than a good Vegas buffet (Bellagio, Paris, etc.), but the Wandering Horse does many things well, and yes there's room for improvement.  I would eat here again the next time I'm in AZ."}
{"text":"This buffet was great!  $25.00/ per person, includes soft drinks or tea and excludes alcohol.    The wait-staff was friendly and very attentive.  Usually, I'm not disappointed by casino/ resort buffets and this did not disappoint.   Selection was fresh.  I spent a lot of time at the salad bar area and appetizer area.  The restaurant offers all kinds of meat dishes: lamb chops, Kobe beef, pork chops, prime rib, etc.  The place has an \"Asian\" section with fried rice, noodles, and other entrées.  Other selections includes side dishes, bread, and seafood.   The dessert selection was probably the most disappointing section. Not sure where the room to stuff ourselves after the heavy dinner was, but literally, the BFF and I tried almost ALL of the desserts offered.  Mint chocolate, peanut butter, vanilla gelato, tiramisu, key lime pie, banana foster, pistachio cannoli, other random cakes . . .  the best thing was the gelato.  My fiancé got a banana foster with vanilla gelato and it tasted great.  Ours, however, turned out not so great.    Definitely recommend after a night of gambling or start the night off right with dinner and then to gamble."}
{"text":"Our favorite buffet, they always have a great selection of food from steak & crab legs to pizza & salads. It's well worth the price & the staff has always been amazing."}
{"text":"Stopped in on Friday July 7 11:15 am.   I was seated by the window overlooking an outside patio. The waitress promptly asked what I was drinking and brought it over while I was at the buffet.   This was my first time trying the lunch buffet.   I decided to take a spoonful of a variety of items. I very much dislike wasting food if I don't like the flavor.  I decided to start with the Asian station. I had some fried rice, shrimp lomein, orange chicken, a spring roll, dumpling, and a couple Asian bbq drumette.  The fried rice didn't have very much flavor and the rice was dry. By dry I mean it didn't taste like it had been fried in some oil in a wok but had been done on maybe something like a griddle. This didn't embed the traditional stir fry flavor into the actual rice.  The shrimp lomein & the orange chicken tasted like something the average person whips up in their home, when they attempt to make them at home and utterly fail. Considering a casino has access to the best cooking equipment, and quite a few chefs or sous chefs they should be easily rocking any Asian dish.  I liked the taste and size of the spring rolls. They were about 1/2 the normal thickness of a traditional spring roll and much longer.    The Asian dumpling was horrid, and I mean horrid. I recommend you find a different recipe immediately. The worst I have ever eaten, even over every boxed one I have tried. At least do a blind taste test with 10-15 people and I am sure you will get the same answer.    The Asian bbq drumette were fantastic. They were perfectly cooked, had just the right amount of sauce on them and had an excellent light crispness to them. Perfect score with these.  I next tried the meat station and immediate area foods.    I had the mashed potatoes and they were killer. They weren't to thick or to runny, they had a good salt ratio, and tasted like they had some sour cream or buttermilk in them.    I tried the fried cod, roasted turkey, roast beef, and some kettle chips.    The turkey was moist but lacked any spice or added flavor. It was very very much plain turkey flavor. I recommend some butter, lemon added under the skin.    The beef was pretty good. Also nice and moist.    The fried cod was tender, but the batter was extremely greasy.    The tartar sauce was fairly runny. I think it could have used a little more relish and thicker. Kettle chips were pretty good.     I tried some of the ravioli in marinara sauce and it was on the chewy side. Decent flavor though.     I tried the shrimp fajita. I prefer grilled shrimp in a shrimp fajita, thus was more like a stewed shrimp fajita combination. Decent flavor, just not to my preference is all.    I tried the carne asada quesadilla. Decent flavor.     I tried some of the honey smoked salmon. This one is very hard to describe if you haven't ever tasted something like this. While the salmon was moist and the smoke flavor pretty good, it had this weird back flavor to it. Something like the smell of a sterno burner or gas smell embedded into it. Could have been a fluke, not sure.   While they had a decent assortment of food for sure, many of the dishes felt like they tasted like something someone tries to cook at home, when they really want the flavor of a good restaurant food. In my opinion many of the recipes need reviewed and tweaked to actually taste like something you would be eating out at the restaurant. You have tons of cooks and chefs working for you. Let them All experiment or bring replacement recipes to you. I am sure they can come up with some fine tweaks.   The waitress was very attentive and always looking to make sure I was doing OK or if I needed something.  Pretty good price for the lunch buffet. However, I prefer the assortment and flavor of the dishes at a very nearby casino. I might try the buffet here on a different day or later in the year to see if something changes. But for now I will stick with the other casino buffet.   This review is based on my personal taste preferences, and I know each person is different. However, that Asian dumpling is an immediate get rid of item and get a new recipe completely different than what you have.  Overall a slightly less than average meal. Nothing stood out I ate as fabulous, except the drumettes and mashed potatoes."}
{"text":"For a $15 lunch buffet, you really can't beat this place. My husband & I wandered in really hungry & left very satisfied. They had a nice carving station with turkey that I appreciated over just the usual red meat option, though they had that as well. They had fantastic sorbet & ice cream dessert selections!!! I would choose this for lunch again, they're open till 3:00 so we actually made it a very early dinner."}
{"text":"Vast selection.  Good service.  Food quality typical for a casino buffet. Would definitely return if I'm at the hotel again."}
{"text":"We had our seventh Breakfast Club UYE \"Meeting\" here in July . . . And even with an 8AM start time, it was our biggest turnout yet!   Lots of people were talking this place up at \"past meetings\", so my expectations were high.   You can't go wrong with $9.99 + tip on a Saturday morning!   Pretty much anything you want you can find here. Omelets cooked to order, all your typical breakfast meats, Asian foods, pancakes, biscuits and gravy, fruit, probably missing something here . . . Oh, and gelato. Yes, GELATO. Try the Blood Orange and Salted Caramel flavors.   The omelet was perfect, and I really enjoyed the Samosas from the Asian section.   Didn't really go crazy, but that's probably a good thing given the workout I had to skip off to immediately after.   I'm not a huge buffet person; however, I could see myself coming back.  Give Wandering Horse a try!"}
{"text":"Took Mom and her sisters for lunch here last week.  While I couldn't eat (was still full from breakfast), they had a very good time- especially my aunts.  The items that garnered the most \"oohs\" and \"ahhs\" were the sweet potato fries and the desserts-- aunt loved her coconut cream pie (it did look very fresh and rich and creamy... I was almost tempted to take a bite!), and Mom and another aunt really enjoyed the sorbets (mango was the fave).    Service and the views outside were excellent.  My aunts definitely want to go back.  Maybe next time, we'll dine outside and I'll be able to try the food."}
{"text":"Well, I am only giving it 2 stars this time (previous visits have been 5!)  There were just two of us for the Sunday Brunch, and although it's always busy, it is worth the wait.  There was nothing wrong with the food...everything was fantastic, with many choices, even for those that are picky.  The service this time, left us with a bad taste.  I know that everyone can have a bad day, but we encountered 4 staff that clearly did not want to be there that day.  We didn't ask much of our server, (extra napkins and water refills), but she kept forgetting us and when we asked her for the 3rd and 4th times, she acted very annoyed with us, like we were asking for something extraordinary. Very disappointed at this visit."}
{"text":"Very good food salmon was amazing.  The dessert was very good.  I wish they had some sushi.  Service was ok. Will be back!"}
{"text":"I came here for the breakfast club yesterday and I was pretty happy with the choice of venue. The food didn't blow my mind or anything but it was pretty good for a buffet. And you can't go wrong with all-you-can-eat for only $10. The best part was the dessert; they had a surprising amount of pastries. I tried a doughnut that was delicious and tasted fresh made. Apparently the cheesecake was also very good. I have heard dinner is even better so I look forward to trying that as well, probably with my mom since she loves casinos."}
{"text":"I'm not generally a big buffet person, but I can handle them from time to time for breakfast or brunch (not so much for lunch or dinner), so when I was in town for Thanksgiving I stopped in here with my dad, brother-in-law, & nephew the Friday after turkey day, and I gotta say this is a pretty solid spot.  My (older & retired) parents have begun coming here for breakfast once every two weeks or so because they love a good deal, and at $9.95 (Mon thru Fri...it's more on weekends) it's hard to beat this place.   Some highlights include the omelet station (where they will also make you sunny side up eggs or fresh scrambled eggs if you're like me and are kind of picky about eating eggs that aren't fresh), the area where they do a lot of Mexican style breakfast food including mini breakfast burritos with chorizo, and the pastry/baked good area. I was actually VERY impressed with the baked goods, which I got the impression were baked fresh right there in the kitchen (if they weren't, they fooled me). I had a chocolate chip scone as well a sticky bun, and they both rivaled pastries you would get at a fancy shmancy bakery.   Of course Wandering Horse also has all the other typical breakfasty items you would expect to find at a buffet (sausage, bacon, hash browns, hot/cold cereal, fruit, etc...) and it's all good.   What's also nice is that the price tag includes drinks like OJ, coffee & milk. I also noticed there is a bar in the dining room area where I'm guessing you can grab mimosas and Bloody Mary's.  One minor complaint I do have is that the service is kind of slow (and quite frankly...not friendly). It wasn't all that crowded when we were there and they were a little slow with drinks.   Overall, Wandering Horse is a solid breakfast buffet and I'd come back!"}
{"text":"Would NOT recommend!! False advertising for Veterans appreciation discount. I resorted to eating salad after the trying most of what wasn't good and $100+ later wish we went somewhere else."}
{"text":"Quite possibly one of the best buffets I've been to, even compared to Vegas buffets!  They have an extensive array of seafood, including fresh raw oysters, chilled shrimp,  smoked salmon and scallops.  The smoked salmon isn't the thinly sliced, prepackaged stuff you find at the grocery store.  This was a whole fillet of salmon that was cooked/smoked, which was a nice surprise.  They have a carving station with 2 meats (the night we went they had roast beef and lamb), and different cultural stations (Mexican, Asian).  They also have a VERY extensive selection of desserts, even some sugar free desserts.  I highly recommend the bananas foster.  They will make it for you on the spot, and put a lovely amount of rum in it too!   Our main server was very nice and did a good job at clearing plates, refilling sodas.  The water server was a bit strange though.  We were seated at a time when it was not very busy, and we went in celebration for a birthday, so we were here to eat like pigs!  After a few plates, the water server went by my table and told me, \"You guys eat really slowly, don't you.\"  Um..... I guess so?  I didn't know you were keeping such a close eye on our table!"}
{"text":"After reading all the 5 star reviews I was excited to visit the Wandering Horse Buffet.  The place is clean, and the food is nicely displayed and the service is very nice.  Unfortunately the food itself was a different story.  The Chinese food section was on par with Panda Express.  Their fried rice wasn't good either.  The Mexican food didn't look appetizing at all so i skipped it altogether.  The prime rib was tender but flavorless.  Everything looks so fancy, how can it taste so mediocre?  The desserts reminded me of Home Town buffet.  I went on a Wednesday evening so I don't know what they have on weekends, but I didn't see any sushi, crab legs or oysters.    Overall I wouldn't go there again.  for $20 I expect better quality food.  Even Golden Corral is better at half the price.  My favorite buffet is Pacific Seafood Buffet.  Read my review of it to find out why."}
{"text":"J and I went for Sunday Morning brunch at Wandering Horse the other Sunday. With all the 5 star reviews, we figured this place would be a hit. In the end, we were disappointed. J definitely was when he was given the total price at the register. Did he have sticker shock? That's putting it lightly! He stated, \"For $50+ for the 2 of us, this better be good!\"   The dining room is very nice and the staff is extremely friendly. After getting our drink order put in, we walked into the food room. Not as much of a selection as I had expected. I'm usually all over some Chinese food, but after looking over the selection, I passed it over. For the section we overall enjoyed the most, it was hands down the Mexican food.   Here's a rundown of what we tried and liked/disliked:   Sushi - J said they were pretty good for California Rolls.  Prime Rib - Very tender. Lacking in flavor though. Thank goodness for the horseradish sauce.  Peppered bacon - Very fatty. J said it was more like eating a slice of fatty ham than crispy bacon.  French Toast w/ Blueberry sauce - This was a favorite of mine.  Green Chili - This was one of our favorite dishes. Paired with the fresh house made tortillas, beans, and rice.  Lamb Chops - This was our other favorite dish. Very flavorful and tender.   All in all, we felt like it wasn't worth the money for us to eat there."}
{"text":"Seriously, this buffet is awesome!!!! We visited a couple weekends ago, and for $25 a plate we got our money's worth. The butcher station was serving lamb and new york. Absolutely fall off the bone good. They have themed stations.....asian, mexican, etc. I tried a little from each and everything was awesome. It's a bit of a drive for us since we are in the far northwest valley, but we will be back again SOON!"}
{"text":"Went in the evening around 7. Food was tasteless and meat dishes were so tough my husband spit it out. Definitely not worth $45 for two. Asian food looked limp and old. Not the selection of main or side dishes you would expect from a buffet. Deserts were dry. Best thing was the sorbet. We definitely won't be back for the food!"}
{"text":"This buffet has an amazing variety of food, and it is all delicious! I especially like the dessert options, which includes a gelato bar. Be prepared to wait if you go during peak hours, but it's worth it!"}
{"text":"Holy moly buffet batman. Probably one of the best buffets I've ever experienced. The place is super clean, nice, staff is very attentive and the dessert selection...oh my. I opted to focus solely on Asian cuisine and my husband did the seafood and meat stations. Food was good, we were stuffed and left happy. We easily spend $100 on dinner and to only spend $60 for all of this yumminess on a Friday night, not too shabby. AND it's attached to a casino. Hit me!"}
{"text":"We went for Friday night dinner buffet cost of 33.95 a person total of 74 bucks! Although our server was friendly and attentive my husband and I were severely dissatisfied with the taste and quality of the food. It was Alaskan King crab night and most if not all of my husbands crab legs had bits of sand in them that he could taste in his mouth. I know casino buffets arent geared towards kids but there were little to no options for my 2 year old. The chicken low mein was flavorless and old and the pizza was sub par at best. The cheesecake was atrocious i dont even think it qualifies as cheesecake. The crust was made of white cake i think and a very sad white cake at that! The mashed potatoes were great i will say that and the garlic bread was decent. The sunrise pasta was different and tasty. But those 3 items were not worth the 35 dollars a person we paid. I dont think we will be back. My husband was so disappointed he wanted a refund but our 2 year old was throwing a fit ( probably because he was still hungry from the lack of options for him)  so stopping to complain was out of the question. So sad because this has been said to be the best buffet in Arizona well then i guess im sticking with sweet tomatoes then!"}
{"text":"Our Holiday Office party dinner was at the Wandering Horse Buffet.  We had over 20 people at our table.  The staff was very attentive and helpful however, seemed to be in a rush at times to clear the table with plates when some where still eating.  The selection of foods was bigger than expected! Kind of an international selection, from Mexican, Asian and Mediterranean.  However, the two main proteins were duck and chicken which was really odd.  The duck was dry.   I was looking forward to the scallops that everyone had mentioned. No scallops.  The oysters were still attached to the shell which made it hard to eat.  Nothing really stood out as to why you would go here over other places.  Except that there is a huge selection of options and it's about $26.  Even the fried rice was bland.  I would try it again for the brunch but it wouldn't be my first choice when taking friends and family to."}
{"text":"You almost feel like you are at the Las Vegas buffet,  amazing variety including lamb chops, oysters, crepes, The list goes on and on!!!  We usually go there for Sunday brunch and this is the best spot for that! Service is great the food is better and the price is very fair!"}
{"text":"The food was pretty good, they just didn't have as much food selections as I thought they would have. Their deserts were amazing though. So many varieties of different deserts. I wasn't able to try them all out lol. Brunch might be my favorite time to go."}
{"text":"This has to be the best buffer in the Phoenix Metro. If you can make it through the smoke stink lobby you'll be surprised by the level of elegance in the buffet room and how excellent the service is. The employees are attentive, helpful and courteous. The food is much better than a Golden Corral type buffet and better than some Vegas hotels as well. For $20 you can eat yourself into a coma and know you ate good clean food. If you go here for lunch be prepared to take a nap in your car around 3 PM."}
{"text":"Name one other place in Scottsdale that has a breakfast buffet.  I only have a few issues with this place is that my appetite isnt bigger. we dont like buffets because we eat alot, we like them for the variety and not having to wait for our food.  They should have more of a variety of egg options during breakfast/lunch including egg whites.   TV's would be great. Im sure that would cause people to lounge more and eat more though. That is my reasoning for wanting them LOL"}
{"text":"For a buffet in Arizona this is the closest you'll get to a Las Vegas quality buffet. This is hands down the best buffet in Arizona with its sister casino's buffet The Eagles being #2 if you want a cheaper option. Everything was fresh, seasoned well and delicious. There were a lot of choices and the cooks were constantly putting out fresh items.  The crab legs...oh the yummy crab legs.  Individual legs, split in half for you, bursting with delicious sweet crab meat.  Lobster claws, scallops, muscles, oysters and shrimp also adorn the table. And don't worry they have drawn butter for dipping. Fyi, if you go on a night where the crab is on ice just ask one of the friendly cooks to throw them into the pot of boiling water to get them heated.  We liked this place so much we came here Friday night and then Saturday night we were like, \"why not!\". Lol The first time we came to The Wandering Horse we were sat towards the back near a windowless area, but on Saturday I asked for a table right near the big windows so we had a beautiful view of the mountains.   Tip! This place starts getting a decent line a half hour before they open. So if you don't want to wait and wait I suggest getting here early. We got there on Saturday around 3:45 and were second in line. By the time they opened the line was about 30 people deep and growing. By the time we left around 7pm (we like to enjoy and take our time)the line was easily 60 people deep.   Definitely give this place a try, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"We got here at 2:30pm and they said the buffet closed for 1 hour at 3pm, and then the dinner menu is served .the cashier said we could stay .then the mgr came over again and said we have to pay the difference for dinner. I said no no. When I went in the buffet court at 2:35pm the food was cold and they weren't putting out now food until 4pm,  a full refund for our lunch. Michael steel"}
{"text":"HOW? HOW. CAN. FOOD. TASTE SO GOOD? AT A BUFFET! OH MY GOD.  I've never been to a better buffet. Went for birthday dinner, tonight.. $20.00 cover charge includes beverage.. had a soda to begin with, and ended with coffee! No additional fee.  Two kinds of smoked salmon, caprese salad, GIGANTIC cocktail shrimp, REALLY FANCY FRENCH CHEESES and a whole host of other nibbly delicacies are the first things to the right, when you walk into this glutton's paradise. FINALLY. I HAVE EATEN OYSTERS ON THE HALFSHELL THAT I LOVE. SO LOVE. SO FRESH. I've only had icky oysters prior to this. :( I'm a new man!   The quality is absolutely top-notch, along with the freshness.  I didn't use up too much stomach space on at the Mexican part of the buffet, but the Mojito Cod (Or some sorta tropically treated cod) was really delicious! Along with this, the traditional BIG CHUNKS OF MEAT UNDER A RED LIGHT ON A BUTCHER BLOCK that every buffet seems to have were present, and unfortunately sliced incorrectly.. a quick mention to the waitress rectified the issue however.. these meats (Beef, and pork) were surely well prepared, though, and tasty.  Living right next door to the GIANT MEATS were an assortment of fried seafood (shrimp, calamari, and scallops) which perfect too.  Not to be forgotten, are the salad bar, and Asian section.. the Asian section featured the typical fried appetizers (Crab Rangoon, Eggrolls, etc) and a few entrees.. The General Tso's chicken was KICK ASS.. the noodles were an oversight because I was focused on fancy! The entire north wall of the buffet is dedicated to Italian delights.. Pizzas, and Pastas.. Normally I skip pizzas completely at buffets, but WHOLE WHEAT WOOD FIRED PIZZAS, HAND MADE!!! and REALLY GREAT! Also, creamy stuffed ravioli were a highlight...  Now, for the desserts.. There must have been 7,000 desserts available for the taking, along with a HUGE assortment of delicious gelatos.  The sparkling gem of the entire dessert experience, however was the FRESH MADE BANANAS FOSTER, SERVED ON VANILLA BEAN GELATO. Yeah, you heard me folks.. walk on up, ask for Bananas foster, and it's prepared right in front of you, butter, sugar, bananas, cream, Meyer's Dark Rum, and Bananas.. AMAZING. Absolutely AMAZING.  There's SOOO much more to this buffet than what's mentioned, but combined with the delightful dining area, and STUNNING mountain view, I actually almost cried leaving, like a kid being dragged out of Disneyland at closing time...... (FLAWLESS STAFF/SERVICE TOO, BTW!)"}
{"text":"Went for Sunday brunch. Sat on the patio. Yum!!!! Wonderful ambiance. Great service too! Loved the food selection. I agree with other reviewers, prime rib was too tough. Too bad because I generally eat a lot of it. Really enjoyed the seafood soup, cilantro rice, Gnochi with mushroom sauce, mozzarella and artichoke and sundried tomato skewers, fruit tarts, breakfast potatoes, artisan breads and cheeses. Excellent \"shot glass\" desserts. Bloody Mary was okay. Will definitely go back. I think it's worth the $25 per person price tag."}
{"text":"Not bad, decent buffet for the price. We got here about 30 mins before they closed for Sun dinner. Server was attentive for the most part, so our cups were never empty. I'd definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Thanksgiving buffet horrible 64$ for some fried appetizers and gross looking \"salmon\" most of the food advertised was cold or not even out. Selection was small and most food was cheap would have rather went to Golden Corral ripoff and waited over a hour for this disaster be warned!"}
{"text":"I had traveled to AZ for 3 days and I saw good reviews from this buffet, so I and my boyfriend tried it. We came on Tuesday, nothing special on the buffet. Not much food for us to choose, at least they covered drinks (not alcohol) and the dessert court had many kinds of ice cream and cake. 47$ for two at dinner buffet was not worth it. Not recommend for coming on Tuesday."}
{"text":"I've lowered my rating because this place has jacked their prices way up. It's now too expensive to take our family here for Sunday brunch as my daughter is now considered an adult with the adult prices being raised and the kids' price has also gone way up. What used to cost us around $80 for the four of us would now be about $140. That's quite a price increase (combined with the age changes, which we weren't aware of until we paid one day and found our bill much higher). This place probably makes a killing on taking desperate people's money out in the casino. Why the need to gouge at the buffet?? It used to be a good value, but I can't say it is any longer at these prices (why is an 11-year-old an adult now??).  Sad probably won't be back anytime soon unless some rich relative we don't know dies and leaves us money in their will."}
{"text":"This is our most favorite place when we plan to eat a lot ;) or give a treat. Ambience, food, variety, quality, service - all the criteria i can think of should get a 5 star. This is a perfect place for a carb-conscious person like me. Went more than 10times in last 6months and always loved the food."}
{"text":"Was ok. Food was not that great, but the desserts were amazing! I would just go there for the desserts. Service is good!"}
{"text":"Shrimp, crab, cheese all delicious.  The hot foods were ok, not great.  Dessert was hit and miss  - some were delicious and others lacked flavor.  Great variety at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"* Review is for the SUNDAY DINNER BUFFET which was a GOOD DEAL *  it's random that we ended up here of all places but several people had mentioned it at the airport. thought we'd check it out since it was close to scottsdale.  now, as a californian, i hate smokers.  hate is a strong word.  totally appropriate in this case.  i am probably bothered by smoking many times more than the average californian.  (in fact, when i was a kid, i used to pretend to cough my lungs out while walking around vegas at the sight/smell of a smoker.)  really dislike places where they allow indoor smoking. in phoenix downtown, we would smell cigarette smoke almost everywhere we walked since they had to smoke outside.  don't people know that they can save themselves $3000+ yearly for kicking the smoking and starbucks daily habit (probably more with the healthcare they have to pay when smoking leads to cancer, etc) ??? *SIGH*   sunday dinner buffet was a great deal at $20.95 per person.  service was prompt. your drink orders arrive quickly. when you get up to do round 2 (or 3) of the buffet, your plate is cleared within a minute or two. their selection of teas are peets teas.   so many desserts. i walk in trying to focus on what to eat before dessert.  all i see are plates of pie, cake, mini parfaits/puddings, the gelato station, bananas foster station...   the soups were okay. i had the viniagrette tomatoes, olives salad that was refreshing. put some chicken (dark meat), honey smoked salmon, mashed potatoes with gravy, veggie ravioli, potato salad, etc. don't remember everything i ate. the asian station didn't look appetizing though..  they didn't have prime rib but the beef brisket was delish!!  my favorite dessert was the banana cream pie.  i wanted another piece but couldn't do that to myself.  the chocolate brownie with walnuts was also an indulgence.  the little cups were pretty but not worth grabbing. mini fruit tarts were yummy.  we also noticed that some people ate a short dinner so that they could get back to gambling. haha.   3,5 stars"}
{"text":"We went for Mothers day buffet and menu sounded great. Prime Rib had no taste, Shrimp was mushy, food was cold. Crab legs also mushy and no taste. Overall this is the worst Mothers day buffet we have been to. Also a party of six was charged 20% tip without telling me prior to charging."}
{"text":"So I went to the Wandering Horse Buffet Sunday for Brunch.  We were celebrating valentines day late since we work in the service industry and valentines day is a mandatory work day.  We were running a little behind because my girlfriend was in a fender bender.  I checked the hours and they said open till three.  We arrived about 2:30.  We paid 75 dollars for the two of us.  Our first trip through and the food was cold crab legs cold and many other entres not refreshed.  Then our server came to the table and said the buffet was shut down at 3:00 and we had ten minutes to finish..  Really disapointed.  I work in a restaurant if you are open till 3:00 that usually means you take the last customers at this time and wait until they are served then shut down food service.  So we paid 75 dollars and were promptly pushed out the door.  Absolutely rediculous.  No manager ever came to the table no explanation nothing.  I feel like I was robbed of what could have been a nice valentines lunch and 75 dollars.   Thanks for a extremely disapointing experience.   Jeremy Shannan."}
{"text":"At about $20, the Wandering Horse Buffet is properly priced for what it is.  Housed in a pleasant setting just off the Talking Stick Casino on your way to the Hotel, the buffet can sometimes be crowded (I'm told) but was not on a weekday evening at dinner time.  Nor were there lineups at the food stations.  As for the food itself, there is substantial variety and also great variation in quality.  Some of it is very good (orange duck legs), some of it reasonable good (steamed shrimp), and some of it almost inedible.  As at most buffets, the trick is to start with little tastes of a lot of things and then return for the best stuff.  The desserts are plentiful and attractive but, again, there is a great variation in quality.  The key lime pie had no lime flavor, but the lemon merangue tart was just about as good as it gets.  They also have top-of-the-line Talenti gelatos.  Because it is a buffet, the fact that there are poor food itemsis not very important because you can avoid them.  In every other way, the Wandering Horse need wander no longer, as far as I am concerned."}
{"text":"I went here for brunch with my friend visiting from out of state.  It was worth it, I was kind of iffy at first with the price being $30/person but the prime rib, lobster claws, and king crab alone is worth the price.  They did have unlimited mimosas and bloody marys.  The buffet actually is comparable to the Vegas buffets, good entrees to choose from,  fresh seafood, omelet bar, big selection of desserts.  Will be back whenever I have the mood to overeat :)!"}
{"text":"Wandering Horse isn't the cheapest buffet around, but OMG what a buffet it is.  I can sum it up in all up in five words:  All you can eat steak.  And not crappy shoe leather steak--delicious mini kobe or other steaks, as much as you want, pile it high.  And you can do the same with the chicken, the fish and shrimp, the pork and crab legs, the Mexican food, the Asian food, salad, veggies, and tons of different kinds of desserts but. . .  The steak--endless steak, tasty, tender steak, eat until you pop steak.  Just go back and get more  Walk into the casino, head in, pay once. and let the beef commence."}
{"text":"Excellent value for weekday Breakfast!  Good quality, fresh food & great staff!  The choices included omelet bar (made to order), fresh fruit, yogurt, granola, eggs, bacon, link & patty sausage, potatoes, chorizo, various pies, donuts, breads, bagels, muffins, coffee, teas, juices, cereals, etc.  There was much more but I can't remember everything.   Prices go WAY up for dinner & weekends, so call the resort to know prices beforehand."}
{"text":"The place. Cant talk about Wandering Horse Buffet, with out mentioning Talking stick casino, its the tall building east of the 101 in Scottsdale. Im glad the people decided to ditch the tents and build a nice building with a golf course around it, and by the way the rooms are really nice with out a big price, if your a local check out  their deals during slow seasons.  Yeah and its hidden as well in the maze of slot machines and black jack tables.  Well for the buffet, no problems here close as you can get to a fancy Casino Buffet in Vegas.  The menu is always changing so keep up to date great specials.  Another tip, the Wandering Horse Buffet also hosts great food for holidays.  As for the service staff, I leave a nice ti. Im being real when I say, I don't tip at all buffets.   For the atmosphere Clean classy casino buffet.  you don't eat in a smoke haze. the seats are nice and comfy if i remember right they have wheels, don't tell me that not fun.    Personally any place that can satisfy a dessert feast after a large meal wins me as a fan.    Anyways casino prices,     * Buffet Breakfast - $9.95     * Buffet Lunch - $13.95      * Buffet Dinner Sunday thru Thursday - $20.95      * Buffet Dinner Friday & Saturday $26.95      * Sunday Buffet Brunch - $27.95      * Holiday Buffets - $42.95  kid prices as well."}
{"text":"We stayed at the hotel during Xmas. The food was okay, plenty to choose from. The soup was yummy. it was Prime Rib special that was good. Pizza a little too spicy. Lots of deserts cakes and ice cream. My partner did not want to come back."}
{"text":"There is no lower star to review this restaurant. NEVER dine here on Holidays from $27 per person on regular days and $67 per person on holidays.  Food poor quality.  Terrible customer service.  First time NO LINE because price was too high.  When we started coming here, food was great and reasonable price.  Call first for price before dining.  They will raise the price during TPC Golf Tournament, Super Bowl, & Holidays.  Buffet in Las Vegas is cheaper & better quality food."}
{"text":"Food is fantastic!  Vast array of salads and desserts.  Three meats at carving station included lamb, ham and beef wellington.   Excellent crab legs and shrimp. Four soups, clam chowder, pork posole, beef bok choy and pork wonton.   Well worth the price, you just have to take it slow.  Service staff very attentive, courteous and friendly."}
{"text":"This place has very friendly and courteous staff as well as a very well maintained kitchen.  The buffet assortment was incredible! Everything was clean and well stocked.  The kitchen staff is actually standing around the buffet to ensure everything stays fresh and clean. This is definitely not your average buffet where food gets gross looking from sitting under heating lamps or where some weirdo grabs food with their hands. I will be coming back often to this buffet!"}
{"text":"This buffet reminded me of a smaller version of a buffet you would get in Vegas. Food was fresh and almost made to order, the way they constantly were filling each section regularly. Well worth the trip and a must whenever you're in Arizona."}
{"text":"Have wanted to visit this restaurant for several years based on the reviews, I choose to use my birthday brunch and celebrate here.  First off - Talking Stick Resort is an amazing place, surrounded by wonderful activities (Top Golf, Odyssea Aquarium, Butterfly Wonderland) and staffed by very courteous, helpful and nice employees. Additionally there is a nice club and an awesome concert/pool area that hosts some great shows (Journey, Foreigner, Stevie Nicks, Alice In Chains to name a few.)  Wandering Horse is located past the main casino floor and even though the casino smells like cigarette smoke and burns your eyes as you walk through, the Wandering Horse seems to filter this out completely. They have great outdoor seating and cater to any size group. Call ahead if you have more then 8 people.  It is pricey - $33 a person for Sunday brunch. Unlimited spicy Bloody Marys, Champagne or Mimosas - all were delicious and as soon as your glass is empty, another one is brought to you. Your water is always filled and fresh as well.  The buffet. I wanted to love it. The food looked amazing. There are many ethnic food stations - Asian, Pizza, Seafood, Mexican, Roasted Meats, Breakfast, Charcuterie, Smoked meats/fish and a massive dessert and gelatto island.  The good. The food was not bad. It was not great, but it wasn't bad. It lacked a lot of flavor. The selections seem almost endless. I think even if you tried, you could not eat your $33 worth of food. The desserts were a hit. Full size slices of pie, cake, cheese cake, tarts and many small cups of deliciousness. I am not a sweets fan, but they were rocking on this end.  Pizza is handmade and cooked in a brick oven. Was not bad, was not great. The smoked fish was nice. Some of the dishes on the Asian side (Orange chicken, BBQ duck leg) were excellent. Jalepeno bacon - incredible. Beef Stroganoff - creamy and good. Fried shrimp, butterfly style, tasty.    The bad. You think people never have had crab legs. People pushed and shoved to get into this line. They are brought in frozen and steamed, sliced in half. Some legs were icy. Sort of flavorless. The oysters - steer clear. Even on ice they were warm and tasted heinous. Shrimp was rubbery. The prime rib, it had flavor but was over cooked. You are given a generous portion. The lamb was over cooked. Pork belly or slab bacon was undercooked and so fatty we took a bite and left the rest.   I wouldn't go back here, mainly because I am not a big fan of buffets. I wouldn't say I disliked the food but do not agree with all the \"awesome food\" reviews. If your a big buffet fan, definitely try this place. The wait staff as well as the chefs are top notch, helpful and will do anything you ask. You feel like your really in a big time Vegas place. Get there early - as it was packed by 11AM on a Sunday."}
{"text":"We went there for the first time to try the Sunday brunch.  Being from California, we love Sunday Brunch buffets and they are tough to find around here.  Anyway, here are my thoughts  Food: The food was outstanding.  Huge crab legs that are split for you.  They will also steam them for you and hot drawn butter available. Shrimp, Oysters, Omelet bar, Asian food, endless deserts, Pizza, etc.  Huge selection. Three glasses of Champagne are included.   Service: We ate at the bar as we did not want to wait in the endless line just to get in.  I don't know if it is always like that all the time, but it looked to be a 30 minute wait at best. Our service was excellent, and same with the people working the buffet.   Atmosphere  This is where I dropped a star.  It is a huge dining room that is quite noisy - almost cafeteria looking.  Nice and clean, but they could use some decorations or something.  Overall we really enjoyed it and I am stuffed on Crab.  I would recommend it."}
{"text":"My friend and fellow Yelper Robyn N. put together a little birthday UYE for me at this amazing buffet.  We were joined by Jeromy H. and Scott W.  And of course my daughter, Claire.    This is by far the best buffet I have been to in years!  Since it was a Sunday we induged in the mimosas and Bloody Mary's they offered with our meal.  Walking into the buffet area was like walking into a food dream.  There was the usual salad offerenings and some different soups. And several different areas of asian food with my daughter's favorite, fried shrimp, as well as my favorite, coconut shrimp.  There was an omelet station, delicious bacon and yummy potatoes.  I had the best salmon I have ever had!  It was like butter and metled in your mouth.  And there was pizza made right there in the pizza oven.  My daughter and I watched and they made her a special pizza of her favorite topping, black olives!  She loved it!  There were so many choices and everything was delicious.    And desert.....omg!  They have a gelato station with about 12 different flavors.  I tried the Limoncello and it was delicious!  There was pie and cake and pudding and cookies.....my daughter was in heaven!!    We had a great time with good friends and delicious food!  I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Wooow This buffet puts the 'edible' in incredible. Came in during the Sunday dinner buffet for $22 (minus $4 for spending some time in the poker room). Was worth every penny.. Allow me to walk you through what went down:    Started things off with a full plate of fat and juicy chilled raw oysters with lemon/cocktail/horseradish and a bowl of creamy tomato soup.    Next up was a bit of a taster as I plated a scoop of Korean beef (tasty with a kick but not worth a second go), two saucy duck drumsticks (very delicious), and several steamed shrimp shao-mai ('lightest' tasting I've had of these, five sufficed) from the Asian stir fry section. A quick reconnaissance of the Southwestern corner where I picked up some..meh tasting steak/pork medallions and finally to the center grill station for a grilled pork chop and broccolini spear.. This pork chop could have been THE BEST chop I have ever tasted - the thick, sweet n' savory onion/carrot reduction really blew me away.    Boom, on to the next one while the Patriots and Broncos move into the 3rd quarter almost neck and neck.. I attack the seafood section again, this time its smoked salmon with a scoop of fresh guacamole and a pile of plump cocktail shrimp with lemon and cocktail sauce...Ohh and why not throw on another one of those great pork chops.    Mmm, no reason to slow down now - on to round four! This time I shoot for the freshly hand-carved prime rib with hollandaise sauce and two steamy fried cod fillets with tartar sauce... Just a wee bit more smoked salmon and - you guessed it by now - just one mo' dem pork chops.    Head spinning, Broncos pull ahead into the fourth with a dominating lead.. Dessert time!  - Creme bulee x2 - Blueberry and raspberry tarts - freshly made chocolate filled crepe with strawberry sauce - ice cream/gelato sampler - scoop each of: coconut, banana with peanut topping, blood orange, cookies n cream with few extra oreos - peanut-butter chocolate creme cake - banana foster (by request - made to order) ...    Believe it or not, I went back in but something told me to stop else I slip into a food-induced coma.    tl;dr: wtttffff are you waiting for - try it out for yourself!"}
{"text":"Another family favorite of ours.  There is a wide variety of offerings and ethnic cuisines that will sure be pleasing to most people.  I'm surprised that my parents enjoy this place as American food isn't really their type, being from southern China and really set in their routine.  Their dishes change daily and the ones I've tried over my past visits I liked a lot.  I especially like their desserts and always hope that the crème brule and tiramisu are there as they are my 2 favorite desserts.  This is a fine place to take your family to for a meal or for you to take a break from the casino.  I found the price per (adult) person to be a bit steep but quality is there to back it up for the most part."}
{"text":"We had high hopes for this place, it was rated the best buffet in Phoenix by Yelp. I knew it would be a little expensive due to the crab legs... $25 a person. We arrived a little late and waited for over 30 minutes to get in.  I was surprised by the large bouncer like men out front who directed us across the hall where the line started.  We got in and found the food was good, but nothing outstanding, with the exception of the crab legs. We took our time with our meal to enjoy it, but when I went back for desert, I found the entire buffet area entirely roped off. When I asked our waiter, he said \"you didn't hear last call?\" Since when is there a last call at a restaurant, especially when you pre paid. He brought us a few different pies... All of which were not what I wanted.  I'm really disappointed that I paid over $25/person for this meal and did not leave feeling like I got my money's worth... I really feel like I didn't get what I paid for. You can get a much better deal at Sweet Tomatoes across the street."}
{"text":"The Wandering Horse Buffet is a very good non-Vegas buffet.  We came here on a Friday night.  On weekends, starting Friday nights, the price of the buffet is $26.95.  For children between 5 -12, the price of the buffet is $14.  The food is good for a casino buffet not located in Vegas.    The food is separated by sections.  Starting from the far left as you walk in is the seafood station.  The seafood consists of Alaskan King crab legs, Lobster claws, mussels, and clams with a pesto sauce.  Most of the seafood was pretty good.  They have a carving station.  On the night that we were there, they had a leg of lamb, beef wellington, and a pork roast. The leg of lamb was dry.  The wellington was soggy, but, the meat was pretty good.  The pork looked ugly, but, it actually had a good smoky taste to it.  They had a grilling station where they cooked Kobe sirloin steaks and vegetables.  The Mexican and Asian station didn't look good, so I skipped both of these.   They also had a salad bar, different cheeses and sliced meats.  None of which I tried.  But, it did look good.  For dessert, they had a dessert station with about 10 different flavored gelatos.   They also make crepes and bananas foster.  All manned by an impatient Chinese (Mandarin) woman.  She must've been lonely because she started speaking to me in Chinese.  It wasn't until I started conversing with her that her impatient attitude changed.    Our waitress was pretty good.  She did a pretty good job clearing our plates, and kept our cups filled.  The only interesting thing all night were the fighters that came in here to eat.   There were going to have some kind of tournament in the hotel.  Some of them looked pretty rough.  Overall, it was a good experience with good food and good service.  Definitely would be back if we went to Scottsdale again."}
{"text":"We have been here over a dozen times, this is our food-splurge spot!  It is not a splurge in terms of money, especially during the week when it is an absolute bargain.  Granted during the week there aren't quite as many choices but there is always a couple of carving stations, some seafood options and almost always those huge gorgeous oysters.   The buffet is always well stocked (you don't even have to wait for them to bring out more crab legs on a Saturday night!), tons of food and dessert choices and the servers are great. Get there early, the line gets serious by 6pm."}
{"text":"I came for the prime rib buffet tonight.  When I got to the kitchen they had run out of prime rib....seriously.  When I asked for a manager, an attractive but completely apathetic woman came over.   I explained the issue and she refused to do anything about it.  I suggested that as a consumer I would like what I paid for and believe a voucher would be in order.   She refused. So now this buffet has my $22 and this review.   I am a consumer rights lawyer so this ain't over yet."}
{"text":"I think I'm going to need to knock several stars off my previous review:  Recently, at a busy non-holiday Sunday brunch, we arrived about noon to stand in an immobile line, only to make our first round of the buffet about 1:45. And shortly after 2pm the offerings begin to dwindle significantly. Not only did the food dwindle, so did the champagne, with servers abruptly discontinuing beverage service about 2:15pm.   At another recent weekday lunch, I though the buffet offerings were a little pedestrian, and some things were decidedly less well prepared than usual. To make matters worse there was a large group meeting of some sort going on in the corner of the dining room, where there was public speaking, tributes, awards etc.  Why would the casino not make this group get a banquet room? It was so great to overhear someone speaking about a member's tragic death from cancer while I was trying to enjoying my lunch--NOT!  Management at this restaurant needs a wake-up call."}
{"text":"Top of the line buffet. It rivals some of the best in Vegas. We've been there for lunch, dinner, and Sunday Brunch. All were great. The lunch buffet was a great price ($13.95), for a fabulous spread. Dinner was delicious as well ($20.95 week days). The real star is Sunday Brunch .   Mimosas or Bloody Mary's including in the $27.95 price tag.They have a salad bar, international offerings, an omelet station, spicy boar bacon (family members love this!),  cheeses and antipasto, pizza, pastas, an array of desserts, and a full gelato bar.   It's beautiful, it's clean, fresh and out of this world!"}
{"text":"First impressions are always the lasting ones. When you go to the end of the line to as for people tyo sit ast the bar instead of asking those of us that have been stand in here in line for 30 minutes you are a POS Restaurant. Makes no difference how good thee food is my impression is you care nothing f or the people waiting. 4 times now we have been passed up as they goto ther end of the line to ask for people for the bar seating. It is absdolute B.S.  Will not return."}
{"text":"would give it 5 stars, but, the sugar free dessert, I think it was supposed to be a mousse, was simply not edible. Everything else... amazing. Shrimp, mussels, clams, salmon, it was a low carb eater's paradise. All fresh and delicious. The buffet was beautifully maintained, and really a surprise to find such fine dining in a buffet setting. So, I'm going to suggest that with all the other really wonderful foods they offer, maybe they can improve on the sugar-free so I can top off my meal!"}
{"text":"What a deal, $13.95 per adult and $8.00 per child at lunch.  11-3 Monday-Saturday.  We enjoyed the lunch pricing and enjoyed a $47 bill for 2 adults and 2 kids.  What a great lunch.  Where else you going to eat for such a low price and eat white truffle oil infused ravioli, duck pot stickers, duck legs, prime rib with Au Jus sauce, mash potatoes and gravy, shrimp, oysters, scallop low mien, pistachio gelato , cheese cake, apple pie, banana cream pie, and plenty of other deserts that I could no longer look at.  Delicious calories waiting for me to fill my belly.   Seriously I almost ate all of that at lunch.  This buffet totally blew my diet and it should with so many great items on the menu you should find something that you will like.  In fact you should like it to the point that you will have to loosen you belt a notch to make room.  This could be the best buffet in Arizona, I have to agree with Rand H. on that one."}
{"text":"Hands down the best buffet in Arizona. Seriously!  I tried the sirloin, roast beef, shrimp, mussels, mahi, and pork. All were well prepared and fresh. I also saw crab legs, salads, pasta, pizza, and calamari. They have a ridiculously large desert selection too! The atmosphere is very modern and open, with an optional outdoor patio.  It helps that this is in the new Talking Stick Resort & Casino, which offers several other upscale restaurants to explore. *Check out the 15th floor bar while you're here."}
{"text":"Mothers day brunch was okay but not amazing.  If they charged less than $55 a head, it would have got an extra star.  1 Star for movement and organization of the staff.  It was a very long line but we made it up front in about 30 minutes.  Bussers and servers worked very well as a team to get plates cleared, get people out and people in.    1 Star - The desserts.  I am not a dessert man at buffets.  I do not have a sweet tooth, but this place rocked the desserts.  I was impressed with the selection and care the dessert makers had with their dessert.  Negative star for the layout of the buffet.  Omelette station in the middle of the dessert bar?  I totally missed it and I really wanted some eggs.  No butter by the crablegs and lobster?  It was on the other side of the bar and not labeled.    Negative star for putting shitty lobster on the menu.  It was practically unedible.  I have no idea how to describe it.  It was like overcooked then flash frozen then reheated in a microwave then chilled.  Definitely the lowest point that was our biggest selling point for going.  Bottom line, Mothers Day 2016?  No way Jose.  Random Friday night if I am gambling and have an extra $60 to spend on dinner?  Sure!"}
{"text":"The Best Crab Buffet in the Valley Period! Everytime I've Been We Have Enjoyed it All! The Dessert Bar is Fabulous Also! And Worth Every Penny!"}
{"text":"Meh. 2.5 stars.   3/5 for service. Very pleasant waiting staff but the servers rarely visit the table to refill water, etc.   2/5 for food. Decent amount of variety but the quality/taste is subpar."}
{"text":"There's no question about it, the buffet food here is phenomenal and top notch. Lots of variety, fresh, colorful, tasty, everything to please the most discerning or picky palates.  The atmosphere is great except maybe for the smoky smell from the casino but that usually doesn't bother me.  Waitstaff are always available and friendly.  If you want top notch buffet food at a great price (about $15/person), then this is place to come!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times, probably one of the best buffets in the Phoenix area. The fact alone that they now offer 4 gluten free desserts would make me a fan but the food and the service is always spectacular. Went last night before the Toto/Yes concert (both were awesome) and stayed overnight. My only disappointment was the lamb, which was not up to snuff last night as in the past when it simply melted in your mouth and was oh-so flavorful. Aside from that the sirloin steak was great, the shrimp cocktail, the oysters were delish. Last night they had crab legs and that was quite popular. I don't do crab because it's SO MUCH EFFORT for such little meat, lol, imo. There are many things that someone with food restrictions can have. Also if you step up and ask, the chef will either make some things for you and/or guide you to what you can safely eat.  Wednesday night is Prime Rib night and that's always good too."}
{"text":"I come here for brunch on special occasions. This occasion was my birthday, and  I love their crab legs and eggs Benedict. Today all the eggs Benedict's were cooked all the way through which is not good.  It's sopose to have a runny egg-yolk.  So I asked the waiter to see if he could do something. Eventually the cook came out and we chatted. He made me an eggs Benedict by hand w a very nice runny egg yolk on top of Canadian bacon and English muffin covered  in hollandaise sauce. It made my day much brighter.  Never had the issue before. But they were super nice about it and I appreciated what they did.  Also had a Bloody Mary, which are so good here.  Lots of variety of foods and some of the options change from time to time keeping things fresh and new."}
{"text":"Nothing special and sub par quality   This a TERRIBLE buffet at dinner time considering the price. The wait can be horrendous and the food options are nothing better than a Golden Corral. If your crazy about crab legs go to an Asian buffet for 12.99 and save yourself some money."}
{"text":"One complaint! There needs to be a main dish for vegetarians! There are many of us who visit. Quiche or enchiladas or lasagna or SOMETHING without flesh in it would be very appreciated. Without it, it's pretty slim pickings. Great cheese plate--however one cannot live on vegetables and cheese plate alone."}
{"text":"Went last Friday night. The line was VERY long of course, but people were seated quickly. For two people we paid around $70 (Eek!).There was a lot of different foods to choose from, chinese, steaks, deserts, etc., but they were all very bland tasting. Even the crab puffs seemed overcooked and were hard to chew. One of the deserts tasted how sunscreen smells. I feel ripped off for the price paid but I knew it was a risk like gambling."}
{"text":"Kudos to the omelette maker and the waitress! However, I'm not sure why it was so difficult for four hostesses to find me a decent table.   Overall the food was okay, not that great of a selection for $30 per person though......the bread table had a great display, but was inevitably just there for looks and stale.   I'm a vegetarian and tend to look for healthier options like fruit and a nice salad bar which was not offered.  I don't recommend this place at all. The cigarette smell from the casino seriously kills the appetite."}
{"text":"Sunday Champagne Brunch is pricey for what you get in my opinion.  I started out at the salad bar and the king crab legs and shrimp looked soooo appetizing however they had no taste.  It was kinda like eating tofu if you know what I mean.  I tried the Mexican fare however, it was horrible.  The homemade tortillas were dried out and hard as a rock, the rice was indescribable and the beans were edible but not great. I love green chili but not here!  Yuck!   The tamale was fantastic!  Prime rib was flavorless unless you add Au jou sauce.  The desserts are truly amazing however, they used to offer mini ice cream cones that they no longer offer and we totally miss.  They also now limit you to 3 glasses of champagne which if the food sucks they should fill it up and then you wouldn't care.  Anyway, with the selection, you can find something you like but plan on wasting alot of food to find it.  It used to be fabulous but it was really lacking this visit."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING. Better than Bellagio for half the price and in Phoenix.  Crab claws, prosciutto, wild boar bacon, the best gelato ever with many non-dairy options including prickly pear gelato.  The only minuses were new potatoes weren't done quite right. It seems like they fry them without pre-boiling them and the eclair was ok but the filling wasn't very good compared to Eclair in Europe. Still better than the Awful monster Eclairs at AJs though."}
{"text":"For a buffet dinner it is $34.95 for seafood buffet.   It is pretty expensive! But the king crab legs seem pretty fresh and tastes good when you're eating it. They also have lots of oysters that were yummy with lemon, salt and pepper and marina sauce. I ate about 6 of them! And a lot of king crab legs.  They have a huge selection of dessert and even gelato. You can order banana foster as well.   I rated this buffet 3 stars because it came out the other end right away! (TMI) I know, sorry!  That's just me, I have a sensitive stomach."}
{"text":"Quality Buffett. Go for Sunday brunch if you want the good stuff."}
{"text":"IM A FAN!  This buffet is inside the Talking Stick Resort and Casino. If you park in the West Parking structure and walk across the breeze way your will be pretty close to the buffet entrance.   I was a little hesitant to try this buffet because of their steep weekend prices (~$45/adult; thats like a Vegas Casino Buffet!) but we tried it on the weekday because its a little bit cheaper during the weekdays. Wednesday nights are prime rib night for ~$20. In all honesty, $20 for the variety and food that is offered is a great deal!  They have 7 different sections: Salad, Asian, Meat carving, Mexican, Raw seafood, Italian, and dessert. The Asian section was actually pretty yummy. It tasted A LOT better than your regular $7 Chinese buffets. It included fried rice, noodles, stir fry with muscles and clams, chicken wings, duck, egg rolls, cream puffs, and soups. It was mostly Chinese food, so I do wish there was more of a variety. The Meat carving station included prime rib and ham. Not too shabby. Mexican and Italian sections were both small but had the usual. Wednesday night also included shrimp cocktails and raw oysters! I was surprised. The dessert had a HUGE variety. from 10+ different amazingly delicious gelato flavors to pies, cakes, mousses, tarts, brownies, and cookies.   For $20 I will come back again; but I can't imagine what else they would serve for double the price!   Environment: 5/5 Food: 4/5 Price: 4/5 Service: 4/5"}
{"text":"After 3 years of living in the Valley and searching for a nice buffet, I've finally found what I consider to be the BEST buffet ever!  Was heading to Peoria from Fountain Hills and decided to try this based on other Yelp reviews.  I wasn't even gambling and didn't have any drinks, so my review is purely based on my love of good food. I arrived around 10:30 to find the enter section roped off, and I was told lunch starts at 11AM (not sure if this is a Labor Day only thing as the signed states 10:30 AM for lunch).  Decided to walk around the casino as this was my first time at this one. Much nicer than Ft. McDowell for sure!  Could hardly even smell the cigarette smoke which was very surprising.  After coming back around 11AM we were the first in line and the line behind us grew quickly.  I was impressed by the upscale ambiance as even when other buffets try, they still seem dirty, smelly or just average at best.  After paying just under $30 for 2, a professional server came to take our drink order and we entered the buffet room to find a nice assortment of Italian,  Chinese, Mexican, as well as other various cuisines. Very nice ssortment.  Tried the pesto ravioli which was amazing, brick oven pizza, seasoned curly fries,  fajitas w/fresh warm tortillas.  Everything I had was delicious.  I will say there was a nice assortment of seafood which I did not partake in.  The dessert bar was to die for!  Tried lemon tart, ice cream, red velvet cake which were all decent.  Chocolate chip cheesecake was great too.  I will definitely be going back as there as numerous items I would like to try such as several pasta salads,etc.  There is defnitely something for everyone here!"}
{"text":"Not much variety, potatoes are not very good. Cups smell like dog. The French toast is ight."}
{"text":"The food was great and our server was really nice! Cashier was unfriendly and standoff-ish, kind of like she didn't want to be bothered. I would still recommend this place."}
{"text":"This IS a buffet, so I review it as a buffet and in comparison to other buffets, and not as a 5 star steak house. But for a buffet, this place is gooood. I've been several times for both lunch and the Sunday brunch.  Let's start with the service, you pay when you enter and are then seated. You have a server who brings you drinks and others clear plates as you dine. Everyone I've encountered is pretty friendly.   From there, you are free to get up and visit the actual buffet as many times as you want, obviously. I will give them five stars on food variety. They've got pizza and pasta, soup and salad, Mexican, Asian, carving stations, cheese and fruit, smoked salmon and more. In the middle are all of the deserts, which are the best part. Many kinds of gelato, cakes, pies, cookies, pretty much anything you would want. All are part of the lunch spread. For the Sunday brunch, they add crab legs and some other extras and have a little more variety with desserts and sides. Sunday brunch also comes with mimosas or bloody Mary's, those type of drinks.   Most of the food is pretty good. Some dishes can taste more cafeteria than fancy restaurant, but nothing I've had is ever horrible. You go for the variety, experience and all you can eat value, not necessarily the best damn food you've ever had. I will say though, their mashed potatoes are BOMB.   I've never been for dinner or special occasions with have an elevated price, so I can't comment on if that's worth it, but for around 15 bucks for lunch and around 35 bucks for brunch (with drinks) I think it's definitely worth the occasional trip."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with Sunday brunch today. It had been about 1 year ago since I went the first time. I wad impressed by the choices of meats... Like 5 different types of bacon, including wild boar. 5 different types of beef. 5 different types of pork, including wild boar. You get the point. They also offered unlimited mimosas. Price was $30 per person. Today, the price went up and there was less choices. Like any typical buffet....one choice of beef, one chicken, one pork. Oh, and no more unlimited mimosas. You have a limit of 3 amongst  bloody mary's, mimosa, and champagne. I used to recommend people to come here for Sunday brunch. Before, it was worth it. Not so much now. Now, it's just an overpriced buffet. Definitely not impressed 2nd time around. Oh yeah, and if you have a party of 6 or more, they automatically add gratuity. Even if the service sucked. Definitely telling people to go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Great quality food, the king crab legs and firewood pizza was a hit. The desserts was great l!"}
{"text":"We went here for dinner last night.  The price was $26/person.. not bad considering there are raw oysters, big shrimp cocktail, sea bass, salmon, duck drumettes, Prime rib, ribs.  It is not the largest spread I've been to like at the Rio in Las Vegas, however, it is not as pricey either.. Surprisingly the stone oven baked pizza was awesome.. they had one with wagyu beef on it that was really good.  Service was extremely attentive, the staff very polite, and the food was consistently being replaced.  In fact, I was reaching for some grilled asparagus when the server behind the counter told me to leave that and he would have some fresh grilled asparagus for me to take instead... This is one of the cleanest buffet's I have ever been to as well.  If all you are looking for is a huge buffet and you don't care about the quality of food this may not be your place, however, I found the selection to be more than sufficient... oh did I mention they have gelato.. really yummy gelato..?  Good buffet, I would recommend."}
{"text":"C+ is the grade I  am giving the Wandering Horse Buffe at Talking Stick Resort. The \"+\" is for the excellent service. The C is for the average quality of the food despite its vast selection.  Furthermore, I disagree with some of the other reviews that this buffet rivals some of the best in Las Vegas...as that could not be further from the truth. I thought the quality was just okay, and some of the displays looked downright unappetizing especially some of the Asian selection..  $ 27.95 per person excluding gratuity may seem like a bargain for a Sunday brunch buffet but I can't say I was blown away or anything. It was my first visit there and I guess I expected more. The service made quite a difference in the overall experience as I must say that Faye was wonderful and did not miss a beat in keeping us happy and kept the champagne coming (three glasses per person maximum).  The dining room was quite busy however and I assume The Wandering Horse Buffet is a popular destination for Sunday brunch. In conclusion, I was not impressed hence my rating of three stars."}
{"text":"i won some money on the slots and i treated my husband and I to the sunday brunch today. I sampled the shrimp, kobe steak, few breakfast items, yummy mini desserts and of course the mimosas.  loved wandering horse atmosphere, it's a modern and open restaurant. i was impressed with the large buffet offerings!  everything was delicious and fresh. it's comparable to the nicer vegas buffets.  It's too much food to eat in one sitting but It's so worth trying your favorite items."}
{"text":"came here for the holiday buffet It was kind of a letdown from all the hype from the holiday menu  the seafood was good meats ok other ethnic sections were mediocre"}
{"text":"This review is based on breakfast only, but I'll update it after I try more meals.  As my 15 year old son would say, \"This buffet is BEAST!\". I ate here on a Monday at 9:30 and it wasn't terribly busy. Breakfast is around $12 (incl. tax) and you get beverages as well. The food quality is really high and being a buffet, it eliminates the \"Do I choose savory or sweet?\" dilemma I always face at most breakfast joints. You can have it all as long as you have stomach space!  The fresh fruit all looked really good and the pineapple and grapefruit I had was great. The blueberry pancake wasn't the best, but the waffle with butter and strawberry sauce was killer. I must eat more of that next time! I am not a huge fan of sausage links, but these were quite good, and the bacon was cooked PERFECTLY. So were the hashbrowns and potatoes. I did not care for the peach smoothie at all, but that was the only thing I didn't like.  The wait staff was friendly and efficient. We will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Went here with my wife and 2 kids for my birthday dinner. They serve several different cuisines and I tried a bit of everything. We were pleasantly surprised how good the food was. Among the highlights were crab legs and lobster claws. Lots of people were getting platefuls of these, but at no point we're they even close to running out....they just kept it coming. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Can't beat the huge crab legs! And open seafood bar with oysters mussels and clams.   Parking: it's a casino so there is a huge parking garage.   Service: because we were in such a large party, we had great service. They were attentive and really quick to refill drinks and that crab! The venue is nice and clean. Probably the cleanest buffet I w seen. They're really attentive.   Food: the best thing I ate was the crab legs and the beef Wellington and the ice cream! The crab leg was a bit cold and salty but it was super good and filling. The beef Wellington was bomb. I mean I didn't eat too much of the pastry part but the beef was cooked perfectly. The other desserts were not good but the ice cream was awesome.  Specifically the banana dulce de leche ice cream.   Super yummy crab and ice cream!"}
{"text":"It's Monday and I am still stuffed...maybe that will resolve itself through the course of the day today...we'll see.  I had clients in town yesterday (and they are friends, as well...always nice to do business with friends:) and they wanted to see the new casino at the 101 and Indian Bend and have brunch...all in all, excellent ideas!  The casino and resort (which has been under construction since I moved to town) have really turned out nicely (at least the portion that is finished...some of the landscaping, pools, finish work inside...well, about 80% of the resort is done...so they have that going for them:) is really very lovely...2 or 3 giant steps ahead of what I expect from a local casino (we aren't in Vegas, after all!).  The important pieces are done...and by important, I mean the pieces that make them money!...the rest of that stuff is just for show.  The casino itself is very nice for a local casino...the restaurants are open and going...they actually serve Peet's coffee here (if you are a Bay Area transplant, you'll know what that means:) and the staff is super accommodating!  We showed up for brunch on Sunday at 11:30 and there was no wait to get a lovely table near the window so we could look down on the construction of what will become a desert nature walk area (probably kind of \"Disney\" version of desert and native American life...lots a dirt and concrete right now...should be nice when they get it done:)  The dealio seems to be essentially unlimited champagne, bloody mary's, blini's, and mimosa's with brunch...for $25 a head...and given the quality of the food...and the quantity of the food and drink...that's a terrific deal:)  We sat there (well, sat and ate, went and refilled, repeated as directed) for 2 and  1/2 hours...the place wasn't busy and it seemed we had our own wait staff making sure that our drinks were never dry and that dirty plates never piled up...in short, assuring us of a wonderful time:)  I have sampled a few breakfast buffet brunches around town over the past few years, from the Phoenician to the Fairmont to Eagles Nest to the Wrigley (The Beautiful Carin loves no meal quite so much as a Sunday Champagne Buffet Brunch), and I can tell you that this place measures up in every way...and exceeds many of those much more expensive brunches!  * The food is presented so appealingly...on porcelain instead of in steam trays! * Chef's at the ready for any special request (if you don't care for the pizza that is available, they'll make whatever you want...no extra charge:) * Gelato, as well as pastry for your sweet tooth:) * Fresh shucked oysters on the  1/2 shell...on ice...with all the accouterments! * A grill next to the carving station (you want your prime rib with grill marks on it?...no problem:) * You want sushi fresh cut, or a fresh stir-fry for your meal...they whip it up while you wait...wonderful!  The buffet is laid out much like the Wynn in Vegas...tucked behind the massive bar and easily accessible, but not in line of sight, so you can enjoy your meal('s)... without all the clanking, cooking, and other things that often accompany a buffet.  None of that would matter if the food and drinks were crap...but they aren't crap...in fact, the food and cocktails were terrific!  I talked to several of the chefs and told them how really good I thought this place is and they just beamed with pride...they are having a good time and making some good chow and it shows in every bite:)  And for me, the bites kept adding up...I didn't find anything that wasn't tasty (and I ate pretty much everything:)  The good news is that I was wearing my \"eatin pants\" so I was ok right up to the time we dropped my clients off at their hotel...then it was all I could do to drive home and drag myself to the couch...moaning...in pleasure (no, food pleasure...I couldn't have done anything else:)  Even Carin needed a nap Sunday afternoon (in spite of eating a much \"healthier\" brunch than I did, with her special request stir-fry and what have you)...those champagnes glasses do add up:)  It looks like Sunday has become \"Brunch Day\" once again, now that a good one is so close...and so reasonably priced!  Now I just need to figure out a new workout program that will allow me to deal with the extra 12,000 calories every Sunday:)"}
{"text":"I came here for Sunday brunch with Sarah H and Dan H and it was glutinous.  It can easily compete with a Vegas buffet.  Three kinds of smoked salmon, crab, shrimp and sushi just to name a few of my favorites.  It is well worth the $30 price."}
{"text":"This buffet is quite wonderful! The place is classy & clean. The food has a wide range of fried, baked, healthy, & sweet options for breakfast, lunch, & dinner. The ambiance is comfortable & pleasant. I look forward to coming back."}
{"text":"Wanted to give 5 stars, but the buffet on a Saturday night featured no crab legs, just jumbo shrimp and oysters for a seafood buffet?  Service was great, I have to admit. The prime rib was tender and tasteful, leg of lamb was also yummy. The buffet overall was a great buffet, I think I need to try out the sunday brunch to get the full experience."}
{"text":"Wife and myself had dinner here tonight. Lots of variety of food. Some hits some misses. Quality is no better than good but nothing was something to remember or bring me back. It was underwhelming. Decor was clean cafeteria with some padded booths. At $21.99 per person for dinner you could do much better two milies away. It would not keep me at Talking Stick for food or to gamble. That is what a restaurant should do at a resort. This place does not."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing dishes!!!  I don't know what's more impressive,  the food or the service.. We've been here on Christmas Day,  birthdays,  family get together and just because... So much exquisite food to choose from.. Make a point to come here for a really nice dinner."}
{"text":"If I could rate this with a negative star I would. Since this opened around 2010 we went several times a year.  We loved it. They had some amazing items and pretty reasonable. As time went on things started changing.  Lamb chops only lasted about a year and quality started lacking.  I know things go up in price but at the beginning it was $19.95 for Friday & Saturday, now its $33.95. We went there yesterday  (6/21/16)   It was absolutely horrible.  NEVER GOING AGAIN.  My favorite is oysters and I'm sure they were spoiled because they tasted really really bad.  I have bad stomach pains and diarrhea till 2 in the morning.  Soup was gone and nobody refilled, nothing looked fresh and this was at 7 pm and everything else had been sitting for a long time. Well I guess they have their clientele and don't care about quality."}
{"text":"If you are looking for variety of food dishes, wandering horse buffet is the place to visit. It has different types of cuisines, which are available such as the Mediterranean, Latin, Asian and American. The dining options, which are available for the public, are the buffet and breakfast/brunch. You must be prepared to eat a lot as there are dishes, which are really mouthwatering. Above all you would not find this place expensive at all with reasonable price ranges of all the dishes. The price range of this place is around PKR 980 to PKR 2939.  People find this place really attractive not just because of the food it has to offer but also because of the other indoor facilities that are available here. There is the option of outdoor seating as well if you are not interested in sitting indoors. The feature of wandering horse buffet includes the carving station, fresh bar of salad, lively cooking stations, pizza kitchen that is brick oven and the delectable desserts as well (Jenny, 2014).  It has been a great experience visiting this place because of the variety of dishes this place offers. If you are here for seafood you must try the sea food. Although the crab legs are salty it is worth giving a try.  If you are looking to have a breakfast here you will find a variety in it as well. Except for fresh berries, which were available in variety, there were numerous varieties of dried fruits as well. There were 2 kinds of sausages, Mexican items, carved ham, Chinese items group of dim sum, Asian vegetables/meat combos, congee and oatmeal, pancakes, French toast and waffles. There were some of the breakfast items which were regular ones and that included the scrambled and hard boiled eggs, omelet station, pastries, and different kinds of potatoes, cold cereal and yogurt. The gelato station is already set during the hours of breakfast.  You can find an array of desserts, which includes different kinds of cheesecakes, numerous pies and gelato bar. In lunch you can have the American, Mexican and Chinese buffet items, four different types of fish, unusual crackers and cheese chunks.  The service of this place will also inspire you. The room provides with beautiful scenery. The price factor might be an issue for many. The breakfast costs around $9.95 every day except for Sunday. There will be certain changes in the price as per the notice, which was seen when I visited there. The price will be increasing to $14 by the end of the month of March. This price increase will be from breakfast-brunch.  It will be still good considering the time length will be increased from breakfast-brunch (Elyse, 2014).  If you are not a smoker, this is the place to have a great meal without any smell of smoking. The decoration is really impressive except for just having the variety of food. You can easily try those expensive lunch items for around $15, which includes the drinks you prefer. It must be remembered that if you are dieting this is not the place for anyone to visit. If you are planning to visit this place on weekdays you will surely get the value for your money. There are plenty of selections available for you in just 21.99, which include the sliced beef, pizza, ribs, pasta, oysters, shrimp, sirloin steak and Chinese chicken (Elyse, 2014). There are numerous desserts, which you can also try.  You can also have those desserts, which are sugar free ones. The staff is really friendly and attentive. You can also book a room which must be king sized one. The room is really spacious and also the beds which are really comfortable to sleep on.  The shower area is also very good and large one where 2 people can easily take the shower at a time. There is a WIFI, which is also available in the rooms. It is really speedy in terms of browsing or uploading some of the pictures on face book. There are few problems, which can be encountered. Although the view of the pool is really nice from the room but it is really noisy with the noise reflecting. You can still sleep comfortably after the midnight as the pool is empty and no one is around there. There is lot of noise on the weekend but besides that the midweek is really peaceful. The valet parking service is also free of cost with many spaces available for self-parking. The service provided is excellent. The hotel persons are really polite, wonderful, prompt and courteous. The bell service is also provided to pick up the bags the moment when you open the door of the car. The bell service is required because they don't keep any baggage carts for the guests. The hallways are really long and you do need someone to help lift the bags (Lucky, 2014). Overall, the wandering horse buffet is an excellent place to visit and you must give a try to the variety of food that is available here."}
{"text":"I don't get the hype. I mean it was at best \"okay\". Perhaps I went on the wrong day (Mother's Day) where they raise the price $20 a head. Cost to value was not justified after having brunch. Even on a normal day, I'm still not sure it's all that great for $30/ person.   This may be one of the better buffets in Phoenix but that isn't really saying much. The thing I'll give them is great service, comfortable atmosphere, wide selection. Creme Brulee was top notch. That I will brag about."}
{"text":"My wife and I tried this place on a Tuesday evening.  We were both pleasantly surprised.  This has to be one of the better Casino buffets in the Phoenix area.  Seafood, Chinese food, Mexican food, salads, soups, steak, sandwiches, pizza, and deserts a good selection for the meat eater and vegetarian alike.  It was well presented and fresh.  The staff were attentive and never let our ice tea get empty.  As long as you can regulate yourself and not eat to much you'll enjoy this place."}
{"text":"We came here for lunch and I was disappointed after reading some stellar reviews.. The food was very bland and our server barely ever bussed our table. There was a lot of things that said \"unavailable\" at the buffet and when our server first asked us if we wanted to drink (the second i pulled my chair out .. Not even looking at the menu!!) I told her water for now and she didn't return for 45 minutes. Just because you immediately harass me prior to even sitting at the table doesn't mean i don't want something to drink after i have had a minute to look at the menu. Ridiculous.  The chefs there to cut food when i asked KINDLY if i could have a slice, asked how their day is and immediately was returned with a WELL IM HERE, YOURE THERE, AND ITS NOT CHANGING ANYTIME SOON CAUSE I HAVE BILLS TO PAY. wtf teach your chefs/servers customer service... Are you not paying them fair wages and are they constantly mistreated? This is the message your staff is giving to clients. Its unprofessional, aggressive and insulting. Completely changed the energy of a celebration of our anniversary. Which i spent a crap ton on a room due to spring training (3x the amount I pay in vegas for EXCELLENT rooms and free buffets). Extremely disheartening. Some of the food was tolerable (im being nice to those of you that have a decent palate, nothing i have a desire or craving for again.  I generally left disappointed and felt bad for the employees who seemed to have little to no support from management.  Seemed very hostile and it was the least appealing environment ive been in, in awhile. I hope management can make some changes."}
{"text":"My friend won big at the casino today.... and so she took us to dinner....hooray! This place is expensive.... like almost Vegas expensive BUT it was better than the majority of the Vegas buffets... and I have done some serious buffeting. They had american kobe steaks that were tender and delicious. Creamy mashed potatoes. Tender broccolini. Wonton soup that is actually good (fairly rare for a buffet). Really good garlic bread. And to top it off.... A fancy cheese, meat, and fig display. The only thing that was not awesome was the lamb leg...but it still wasn't bad. The dessert set up was pretty awesome... fresh fruit, all different types of pies, tarts, cakes, ice cream, sorbet, and even fresh made bananas foster. I ate so much dessert. It was sick. They had some delicious chocolate mousse, tarts, and the bananas foster was excellent.... I am so glad we gave this place a try and I would definitely come back for another special occasion.   This buffet does a very good job of making you feel like you are in a nice restaurant and not necessarily a buffet. The buffet is separated from the dining room and there is very attentive service bringing drinks (all non alcoholic drinks included) and clearing plates. Gotta like that. Plus we had a view of the pool... not such a bad view."}
{"text":"The best buffett I have ever been too.  All you can eat lobster What more can you ask for.  Going to this buffet is more like an experience.  I live in NY, I wish we can have some of these great restaurants Here.  I just have to wait for my next trip to Arizona"}
{"text":"Thanksgiving buffet here is amazing and that line is looonnnnnggggg. Wide variety of food and really on point with each style if food."}
{"text":"WHAT!?  5 stars.  Not a chance people.  I checked this place out because of the great reviews.  They use very nice china and cutleries.  It's clean.  The atmosphere was great but that was all this place has to offer.  The food was mediocre at best.  Asian station was panda express served on real china.  No sushi!!  Dumplings tasted like the frozen ones from Fresh and Easy.  The pizza was not any better than Peter Piper.  Dessert bar was comparable to Old Country Buffet.  Mexican food was mediocre.  Steak was a disappointment.  Gelato was okay.  G  Casino Buffets with no crab legs?  This place was a total disappointment.  NOT worth the money."}
{"text":"Breakfast buffet review: it's well worth the price and a good selection of breakfast items including some Asian dishes too.  I ordered a coffee, OJ & water - so don't be shy on your drink selections.  We came about an hour before the breakfast buffet closed but there still was a good selection of food and they were putting out fresh stuff!"}
{"text":"We came for breakfast on a Friday 45 minutes after opening. The buffet is in a casino. You have your choice of valet parking, parking garage or self parking. You have to walk through the casino to get to the buffet, a clever marketing scheme for potential slots addicts. There were only a couple people here at this time so we were seated immediately at a table of our choice. The dining area was separate from the buffet so it had the feel of a formal dining room rather than a cafeteria. They had a wet bar on one end of the dining area near the buffet.    The buffet had a nice selection of pastries, fruit and cereal. The hot dished included several kinds of breakfast potatoes and meats. There were the fixins to make eggs ranchero and many other breakfast standards. They had about 10 different kinds of gelato to finish off the meal. The food was a good quality and tasty. I did however think the O'Brian potatoes were a little greasy. This is a place I will take visitors to for a local experience as it's not a casual dining venue. I want to try the dinner buffet as it sounds fantastic according to the menu, but the $26.00 price sounds a pricy."}
{"text":"Very thoughtful staff who prepared noodles specially for my table when I mentioned we were vegetarian."}
{"text":"I've been to this buffet on several occasions and left pleased. However this weekend we stayed at the hotel for my birthday, dinner on Saturday night was sub par compared to other occasions. We were severely disappointed to pay the same price for Sunday brunch to be served the EXACT same food as Saturday night dinner with the exception of a few egg dishes. Save your money and visit one of the other restaurants in the hotel."}
{"text":"Pretty solid buffet I must say.  I came here for the lunch buffet with some of my coworkers. If you come M-Thursday its $15 which is a pretty solid deal. The steak and shrimp fajitas were pretty good, I also liked the salmon and enchiladas. I do wish they had some tortillas though so you could wrap up the fajitas. Theres a few carving stations as well with different meats.  I finished off my meal at the dessert station. The cake slices I tried (cheesecake, tiramisu) seemed like they had been sitting out for a little and weren't that great. The gelato was awesome though. The mango and lemon flavors were my favorite.  Got a few plates in then hit the tables to win back what I just spent on lunch! What a win-win! Will be back again to try the dinner buffet."}
{"text":"Hands down the best buffet I've been to yet!   My cousins and I discussed many options before settling on this one. Although it can be pretty darn pricey, I honestly think it's worth it considering the extensive array of options you have for food, dessert, and drinks! So many amazing options; it's a little overwhelming! My favorite had to be their chicken salad and pasta dish.   They had so many different kinds of dessert, including various flavors of gelato. I came back so many times the staff remembered me (kind of embarrassing, but he was really funny and made light hearted jokes about it).  The staff here were unbelievable! I never expect much from the staff at a buffet, but our waitress and waiter were so great; they were refilling drinks every 10 minutes and clearing plates at the same time. They were all super sweet and nice and made great conversation with us.   Food here was so delicious, my family and I ate until we couldn't move.  The only downside was that there was some special show going on and we couldn't park on the premise. We had to park across the street and be go-carted to the entrance... which was pretty cool."}
{"text":"Food is average. Not a huge spread for as much as you pay. Also it's not a bottomless champagne brunch, it's a max 3 sparkling wine brunch.....for 36 bucks go to RR in old town Scottsdale or Lons at the hermosa, better food better \"champagne\""}
{"text":"Mother's day buffet today.   It was okay,  but probably not worth the cost at $54.95 per person. The crab legs were frozen,  but the prime rib and fresh cut bacon were delicious.   The dessert buffet was splendid with a lot of choices.   The wait to get in was over an hour long,  but it was very refreshing that they didn't rush us to leave.   Not sure if I will return ...."}
{"text":"Went specifically for the king crab and lobster claws.  Never again!  King crab was cold and the lobster claws were so tough, overcooked and probably old.  Chef even verified and offered to cook up another plate for me.  By this time, after eating a couple of the others, I had no interest.  Actually been feeling a little ill since.  After the \"mgr\" acknowledged what the chef said, we were offered a glass of wine."}
{"text":"Service is good, they have a wide variety of desserts. It seems they lack meat though. The basic boneless chicken breast is nowhere to be found. For dinner , they should have more seafoods. I dint see mussels, crab legs, crabs. But they had shrimp and oysters. They had steak and lamb which was good too, salmon was overcooked it was really dry and chewy. I liked the steamed pollock ( not sure but it was white fish ) with veggies and rice. The ambiance is good, too.   Tip: when you do dinner, get there as early as 4:30pm,  yes, when they just barely open, especially if you are starving else you would have to wait before the other 25-30 people can get in."}
{"text":"I really want to love this place, and a huge part of me does, until my last experience. I was with my husband and mom, on a Friday night for dinner, and it was going really well. Our server was terrible, but other then that the food was amazing. It was when we were going for dessert, that as I walked past the bar area, I slipped on ice all over the floor, near the bar. I grabbed the wall in time, but my leg had already been hurt. The bartender was the biggest asshole I have ever met. He stared at me, holding my leg and my husband yelled at him to get some help. He rolled his eyes, and called and I asked him for some ice, and he said they are getting it, He then immediately tried to grab a towel to clean up the ice, and my mother and I both yelled at him to stop so we could take pictures. He was pissed. The medics came, and wrapped my leg, all while I was crying, and everyone was staring at me. I have never been so embarrassed. The bartender made it worse by giving me dirty looks the entire time. The chef though, he was amazing. He came out, asked if I was okay, and kept apologizing. He literally made it better, just by being kind. Then the manager came out. One I didnt know she was the manager because she didn't approach me and hid behind the medics. I asked the medic for the manager and she came forward, I told her that this is ridiculous, and that I didnt even get to finish my meal. I had to ask her for a refund! She ran to go get it and took 20 MINS!!!!!!!! I was crying because the pain was shooting up and down my leg. She finally came back and I was taken out in a wheel chair. Ive tried multiple times to get a hold of the GM but I got another manager instead who was rude and simply said soooo you got a refund....... I dont want freebies I wanted to talk about how the situation was handled. oh and fyi the Bartender makes all the drinks, soooooo guess whose fault it was for dropping ice everywhere, and me hurting my knee. I ended up missing my camping trip. So yea great food, shit service but they literally dont care if you hurt yourself because of their inept employees."}
{"text":"I was expecting Vegas quality but this is just a small casino in Arizona.  Get real, Joyce W.!  :(  We arrived at 6ish for a Saturday Dinner Buffet.  I believe it was $14/pp but I'm not entirely sure since someone else picked up the bill.  They had NY Strip, oysters both raw and fried, king crab legs, lobster claws, clams, mussels, tilapia ceviche, a fajita station, pizza, a cheese selection, fruits, salads, Asian stir fry, a very impressive dessert bar, et cetera.   Sure, the king crab legs were plenty and always stocked full but it was all frozen firm meat.  At one point, one of us asked someone to heat some up for us because it had ice chunks inside.  The raw oysters were sadly not fresh.  I was telling everyone I was going to down at least a dozen by myself.  Two fishy oysters in, I gave up.  You just can't choke down oysters that can't be pried off their shells.  I also ate one with too much horseradish to try to off-set the weird-taste but all I got was a clear sinus from it.  Whoa!  I heard the NY strip with au ju was pretty decent.  I regret not getting a cut because I was starting to feel like an ice cube from all the cold foods I was eating.  I think the highlight was dessert.  Everything was small and dainty and the serving size was perfect since I wanted to try a little bit of everything.  Give me more creme brulee and I'll be a happy camper.  I even had some sugar-free spumoni.  All-in-all, it was a decent dinner buffet for $14 with an okay selection.  It's a very clean dining area and the wait staff is friendly and on-point with clearing dishes away.  They keep the glasses filled and the tables stocked with wet napkins."}
{"text":"Huge fan of this place.  Great food, reasonable price.  The parking garage can get kind of full.  The food is top quality and the ambiance is nice."}
{"text":"Best breakfast buffet I have had and at a very good price. Everything was good: sliced pork belly, very flavorful bacon strips, wood-fired breakfast pizza (although they should use their good sausage gravy for the sauce), eggs with chorizo, and very good coffee. If I lived in this area I would come here just for this buffet."}
{"text":"I normally hate buffets and never would have dined here if not for my Dad choosing it for his birthday dinner. My dislike for buffets is due to its food wastage, however, this place is different because they donate uneaten food! I have it a low rating because the food itself is sub par, yet I would have given this place 5 stars for service alone! Amazing staff, that are kind and attentive, and that is everyone from the server to the dessert attendant to pizza chef. If this place was more affordable for the food quality received I would likely bring my family back simply on service alone. With that said, a normal everyday dinner price of $25 a head with no prime rib, crab legs, shrimp, etc. Is excessive. Furthermore, all children over ten years are considered adults. And paying $25, after tax, for each child is simply crazy, especially since my smallish nephew's barely ate a thing. I believe the excessive food wastage at wandering horse is due to people putting visual appealing foods on their plates only to be disappointed and not finishings then going to get something else. At least, that was our experience. I was very upset that I called ahead for a menu and when I got there it was different than described, and it was disappointing. The plus side is they have a pretty brick oven pizza section, however, any dreams of quality crust and amazing toppings is dashed when you take a bite and it is reminiscent of Little Ceasers and not Pizzeria Bianco, but again they will custom make whatever you ask and make it pretty, but they can only work with the poor ingredients they are given. All in all, for service it is excellent, but the food is bad and the selections and variety is worse. The dessert bar was bigger than the normal food selections. Need I say more?"}
{"text":"This place went down hill food was cold heavyly salted like they don't taste it for quality very little to choose from cooks behind counter was more worried about talking among each other then helping with the food with their guests horrible cooking staff better buffets in arizona !"}
{"text":"came here with the family on a Saturday for Alaskan king crab legs and it was delicious! their seafood is very fresh and tasty. all the other food items in the buffet are delicious with a wide variety of choices. their dessert selection was great too! the servers were very attentive and nice. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Excellent selection, something for everyone. Smoked salmon is great. Pork carving very good, stay away from the prime rib, it was tough. The desert island is heaven."}
{"text":"This has to be one of the best buffets in the Phoenix area. It is clean and all of the dishes are of high quality. On the weekends, they have seafood night, with crab legs, shrimp, and oysters on the half shell. The Sunday brunch is also superb: mimosas, seafood and carving station with meats such as brisket or roast. Granted, eating here is not cheap but for what you pay for, it is great value."}
{"text":"Came here for their AYCE Cold Water lobster on a Thursday night for $25.95.  We arrived at 6 pm and the place was already packed with a line.  The wait wasn't too long....you pay and then stand over to the side until they call your name with a place to sit.  Kinda nice so you don't have to battle it out to find a table.  The food is plentiful, but nothing that I would really say stood out. I came mainly for the lobster - and there was a long line for that - and they serve you 2 at a time.  It's pretty small since the meat is mainly from the tail.  You can finish 1 lobster in 2 bites.    The other foods there:  a Mexican Station with green enchiladas, corn, beans, rice and tortilla chips with salsa.  An Asian food Station with stir fried noodles, shrimp shumai, chicken wings and fried rice.  Salad bar, Pizza/pasta bar.  And meat bar with roast beef, steak and ham.  You also have your usual mashed potatoes and french fries.  Also a nice soup bar.  They also have oysters on the half shell that I did not try.  Their dessert bar (located in the middle) is tasty and full of varieties.  We had them make us a bananas foster over vanilla ice cream which was AMAZING.    All in all, I probably wouldn't come back again for the lobster feast - but I do know that their Sunday brunch is out of this world.  I'd come back for that."}
{"text":"We visited this buffet for Sunday brunch at my mother's request.  I am not a fan of buffets in general... mainly due to hygienic concerns.    However, this buffet was stellar.  They had saw-cut crab legs, which won me over right away.  Then there were all your usual buffet offerings.  They even had made-to-order corn tortillas with the Mexican food.  I hardly noticed the omelet station, which I usually run toward.  I did not see one person order an omelet during my entire meal.    To top off a very wide selection of really decent food, you were allowed your choice of three breakfast drinks: bloody marys, mimosas or champagne.  At first, we were a little annoyed because we thought it was unlimited champagne.  However, three glasses of champagne is REALLY enough.  Trust me.  Of course, I got DH to get me one of his drinks so, I had four.    At $27.95, this was a little pricey for a weekly brunch.  However, I think it will definitely be on the rotation in the future.  I crave that sweet crab every now and again and not having to crack it is an extra bonus!"}
{"text":"Friday and Saturday is the Seafood Buffet Night with King Crab Legs and Burger Patty size Kobe Beef Steaks.   All the items are done very well and if you leave here hungry something is wrong with you.  When getting the King Crab Legs make sure you ask one of the cooks to boil them to eat hot.  If you are looking for a place for breakfast give it a try here from 8:00 am to 10;30 am for $10 per person.   There are custom omelettes, eggs, sausage, bacon, pancakes, french toast and the custom sliced pork belly.  Of course the desserts are very good and there is a case of gelato.  Will be back for more"}
{"text":"I can only address the Christmas buffet offerings, my only visit to this buffet thus far. Food was excellent in every category I tried. Impossible to try them all in one meal there is so much variety. Highlights for me included the lamb chops with mint sauce and the Alaskan crab legs. The sideboard items such as veal roast and prime rib looked just as good and well prepared. Coconut macadamia shrimp was so well flavored I wished I had saved room for more. The large variety of  handmade deserts were just as delicious as they looked. There may be a wait line for the buffet. Very worth the wait and cost considering that many of the items sold individually in a served restaurant in Scottsdale are nearing cost of this buffet. The Christmas buffet is priced higher than other times, but includes three glasses of champagne or mimosas. This was far better than any Vegas buffet at fine hotels I have tried."}
{"text":"We went on a Saturday evening. They had the king crab legs and other shells at the seafood bar. They were the highlight of the dinner. They also had lamb at the carving station and roasted goat meat at the Mexican station. A variety of gelato and sorbet flavours were a major bonus. It was definitely worth the price you pay for the variety of food you get!"}
{"text":"Showed up to treat my wife to a nice night out and was greeted with a price tag twice the normal price. Ok Valentine night something different might be worth it. Except it was not really different than normal just twice the price. Use to come often I won't go back so hope that price hike is worth the lose of a regular customer."}
