{"text":"I went to Bingo Monday's and had a great time with friends. The lamb sliders are AMAZING! Love the outdoor seating. I would definitely recommend this place if you need something fun to do on a Monday night."}
{"text":"Loved the ambiance and fresh cut fries. Not a seedy place at all.  The waitress wasn't very attentive, but it was a busy night."}
{"text":"Got cabin fever during the snow/ice and headed here for dinner. Wasn't expecting much but boy was I wrong. The fish and chips meal was delicious. Perfectly fried and fish was moist, succulent New England code. and the tartar sauce just right. Wasn't chunky and dense like a lot of places. Such flavor! Came with peas and fries, fries were decent. Very friendly waitress and food came quickly. Boyfriend enjoyed his burger but said it wasn't necessarily better than other restaurants' burgers. After tasting my fish and chips he said he would definitely order that next time. Also the music selection was on point. Found myself jammin in my seat a Few times. Since the world was iced over we did not eat outside but they have a nice outdoor seating area that would be great for warmer weather."}
{"text":"This was a fun bar.  My boyfriend and I met up with some friends here for a few beers.  Before they arrived, we started out downstairs, where there was music, but no band.  We went exploring upstairs and found a completely different scene up there.  Comparing the two, it felt like a slightly older crowd downstairs, and a younger crowd upstairs.  To me, the upstairs was reminiscent of fraternity parties I used to go to in college, if that gives any sort of mental image.    The band was great, but it was SO LOUD.  As in, ears ringing the next day, LOUD.  Maybe it's a sign of me getting older (and in that case, I maybe should have stayed downstairs?), but it seemed kind of ridiculous to have it as loud as they did.  Beer selection was good.  We had fun.  Even if I didn't hear a single word anyone said the entire night."}
{"text":"Atomsphere,atomsphere...well done.staff was on top of their game, never letting our group of 6 go dry regardless if it was beer or water. Food all around was great..corn beef and cabbage was my choice and made a happy plate as a result. Located in south end and easily accessible and plenty of parking."}
{"text":"I don't think I've ever had a bad experience here since the remodeling completed. Beers are colder than before, the food is pretty decent, and the crowd is always laid back and looking for a good time. The outdoor patio is set up nicely with cornhole and live music. This really is a great neighborhood pub."}
{"text":"This was one of the fifth or sixth places that I ventured to since my move to Charlotte. It instantly became a favorite. It has a cheerful atmosphere and the staff seems to be rather accommodating. I was told that they recently revamped the entire menu. I'm not quite sure how the menu was prior to the new one, but either way the food is great! One of the bartenders even introduced me to a \"snake bite\" (my new favorite beverage)- a concoction of Guinness and Woodchuck (cider beer). I'd definitely recommend giving Tyber Creek a try!"}
{"text":"I loved this place before, but the new updates put it over the top!  Awesome decor, great menu, and as always, an incredible staff!"}
{"text":"Good spot to hang out. Chill during the week fun on the weekends. Bartenders are cool. Best spot in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Great bar.   The beer is cold, the food is good and the Bartenders are awesome.   Early in the week, Tyber creek has a very down-home, Irish pub feel. It's quiet, the music is mellow and you can shoot the shit with the Bartenders while enjoying your drink. On weekends it gets a little bit more rowdy, with live music and DJ's upstairs.  But the biggest draw is the staff. I would definitely recommend getting to know these guys and girls, as they are some of the nicest people you'll ever meet. They know how to mix a mean drink and are always very welcoming.  This has become my go to bar for some time now, and I don't see that changing any time soon."}
{"text":"It's like any Irish bar. Very darkly lit. I was surprised to see curry fries on the menu (apparently I've never been to an authentic Irish pub as this is a staple item). The fries were overly greasy but the curry \"dip\" was flavorful.  My beer was not as cold as it should be and didn't help the flavor of the beer. I sent it back no problems.  Heather served me. She was attentive, pleasant, knowledgable about the food and drink menus and made good recommendations.  Private parking with plenty of spaces."}
{"text":"Tyber Creek is a place I frequently visit during the week, weekend etc. We always end up going to Tyber Creek for drinks. I usually go during the week and it's never overly crowded, which I like. I'm sure going on the weekend it would be more crowded.  I like the outside seating and they have standard bar games outside (cornhole, jenga). There's also an upstairs with a bar and additional tables and TVs. I've only ever had two items off the food menu, but both were pretty good! I had a standard burger and the spinach and artichoke dip. I really liked the dip, especially the bread/crackers that it comes with! Living close also makes it a go to spot for me!"}
{"text":"Visited Tyber Creek on St Patty's Day with some friends and had an awesome time. It was very busy so we were lucky to be seated with a table outside on the patio that had just opened up.  Our server told us in advance that there was a wait for food which we gathered by how busy it was. We were happy to enjoy a couple Guinness pints while we waited, it was certainly worth the wait and the best fish and chips I have had in a long time! My boyfriend got the Reuben and two others got the bangers and mash & corned beef to share, everyone was happy with their meal and our servers suggestion of Irish coffees as desert went down a treat!  We stayed into the afternoon as the atmosphere was great and despite how busy it was we were well taken care of and returned with a large group for the Irish band the following night. We did not eat but were at the bar and had a nice cocktail with Jameson in it, I can't remember the name but I'll be having it again next time for sure!"}
{"text":"The first time I came to Tyber Creek Pub was for a Cornhole tournament. Yes...classy...I know.  My friends Guinness and Jameson ensured the day was successful and that our tournament was not.  What I've liked about Tyber Creek on my several visits is that it has the dark, heavy feel that an Irish pub should have. This is also why you see so many good looking Irish girls with busted looking guys. Major kudos to the men of Ireland!  The beer and whiskey selection satisfy my tastes...and the food isn't too bad either. There are three completely different vibes to Tyber: the daytime...grabbin' food and tippin' one or two...the nightime...\"this is how we do it\"...and the weekend...\"all caution to the wind\"  All three of which are fun and inviting given the mood you're in.  Tyber Creek is a fun time with great service, great drinks and fun people. If you haven't made it Southward...maybe you should.  Try: an Irish Car Bomb  Avoid: domestic beer"}
{"text":"Seems like your typical neighborhood bar with outdoor games (cornhole, darts, giant jenga) and friendly service.  I liked that you could have a dog outside and the atmosphere was very casual.  Pretty standard fare of drinks and food.  We ordered the dip/pita appetizer.  The pub cheese was cold (womp womp) and the hummus was bland but the server was incredibly nice in bringing us multiple rounds of pitas to dip!"}
{"text":"Went on St. Patty's day and waited 1 1/2 hours for food under staffed and finally when the food came out it was ice cold. The had and Irish guy behind the bar upstairs and he was a amazing jerk. I would recommend to everyone to please stay away from this venue if you want good service good food or a good time. I know personally that I will never return"}
{"text":"Always enjoy coming here and they've got a new chef and Iv had great food every time so I like the direction they are going. Excited to come check out the new menu in a few weeks too"}
{"text":"Love this pub! We went here on St. Patrick's Day and had a blast. The place was packed and such a good atmosphere to be in. Service was good at the bar and at a table outside with our server Kayla. Corned Beef and Cabbage and Bangers and Mash were just what we were looking for. And they definitely know how to pour the perfect Guinness. Can't wait to come back and try some things on their menu!"}
{"text":"I like Tyber Creek.  I went early on a Thursday night and had a good time relaxing and catching up with a friend.  If there were half stars it would get a 3.5.  Here are the great things about it:  - Ample parking - Cozy inside - All pints are $3 on Thurs. - Adequate beer selection - Chill  I didn't try any of the food.  Service wasn't as attentive as I'd desire, but we got what we needed!"}
{"text":"Tyber Creek Pub deserves 2 stars only because I was served a pretty good burger the first time we ate here, but our second (and last) outing at Tyber Creek last night was absolutely ridiculous. The staff crumbled in front of us and made all patrons feel extremely uncomfortable. The GM was fired under a spotlight on the second floor, our food runner complained to me about his wages, and our waitress mentioned to us that another waiter had just told her to \"f*uck off\"..... We never wanted to be caught up in the awful, petty reality show called Tyber Creek Pub, we just wanted to catch up amongst our friends and have an enjoyable dinner.  I will never eat or drink here ever again, but if you love drama, terrible service, and sub-par food, it's a must-visit."}
{"text":"Oki have always loved this place, as it has the best breakfast in Charlotte, but today they went above and beyond, through a reason I won't go into I accidentally set fire to the bar (it involved a napkin and a candle) anyway like the idiot I am I grabbed said flaming napkin and immediately set fire to my hand, the barmaid, who I will say has to be the best ever calmly  puts out the fire hands me some burn cream likes it's not a thing, I dare you to find that kind of service anywhere else."}
{"text":"Good beer selection, good outdoor area with cornhole, big jenga, and ping pong, fun vibes and good amount of parking"}
{"text":"This edition of Excited about Eating takes us to Tyber Creek Pub in the Historic South End of Charlotte.  Dora here. Isn't this the coolest looking building? I love the brick exterior and this pub has been on my radar for some time, specifically for the Shepherd's Pie. The dark interior screamed bar and outside of two or three tables inside, the only seating appeared to be the outdoor patio. Wouldn't recommend bringing the kiddos for dinner.  For my lunch, I chose the Reuben with a side of hand cut fries. This sandwich was very good and loaded with moist corned beef, sauerkraut, and melted cheese on toasted bread. The bread stood up to this juicy sandwich and never became soggy.  Dora here. We visited on a Saturday for lunch and, if I'd done my research, I would've known that they only offer their limited Brunch menu on the weekends. Bummer since I was looking forward to Shepherds Pie. Instead, I opted for the Tyler Creek Pub Burger. A good burger, but nothing jazzed my taste buds. The French Fries were fabulous. Tasty and not greasy at all, these hand cut sticks almost made up for the unimpressive burger.  We rate this restaurant 3 forks out of 5 for a friendly restaurant serving good food. ~Ernie & Dora Hiers, Fiction Faith & Foodies Blog"}
{"text":"Tyber Creek is a great place to drink, and is one of my favorite places to throw back a cold brew.  They have $2 Guinness drafts every single day, so bear that in mind.  They are also within bike riding distance from y house, so i love to just ride my beach cruiser up there drink a couple of Guinness and pedal home.   It has a true Irish pub feel with 3 different atmospheres.  1st there's the outside, perfect for most of the temperate climate in Charlotte, and on weekends they tend to have live music outside.2ND there's the first floor inside which is dark and very Irish pub-like . And 3rd there is the top level where they have live music and DJ's on occasion and mostly its just a more lively place to hang out than the 1st floor, they do have a pool table, its a little crooked and stained, but hey its only 50 cents to play.   Thursdays, like are $2 draft night where everything on draft is $2, but bear in mind this is one of their busiest nights and you will most likely have to deal with the type of crowds  Erin K. warns about, but if you're like me, that is no problem, $2 beer is good all day every day.  Tyber creek has a great great atmosphere and $2 Guinness pints everyday, beat that."}
{"text":"Tyber Creek is one of those bars that's perfect for every scene: day drinking, chill happy hour, or 1am drunk dancing. They have a really large outdoor patio with seating and games like cornhole. They have string lights which make me v happy.   Inside the bar is very dark. It's also pretty small and kinda claustrophobic. Upstairs, it's also dark and sometimes there's a DJ playing up there. To me, it's weird. It's usually never crowded upstairs so it's like having a DJ play music for your 3 friends in someone's attic.   I've never ordered food here and the thought of doing so is weird to me. This doesn't seem like the place I'd ever go to have food. But .. who am I to judge since I've never tried it."}
{"text":"Really like this little place, reminds me of the real deal. I like the strange configuration as a lot of real pubs in Ireland are like that.  Dark is awesome but I would have liked to see some tea lights on the bar.  We had the potato cakes and the curry fries both could have used some salt but other than that, very good. The bartender is from Ireland and she was perfect, slightly cool reception but warms up as you chat. Made us hot whiskey, delicious. We'll for sure be back."}
{"text":"Beautiful spot in a beautiful part of town.  Drove by this place a couple of time and I got really curious about it.  This looks like a beautifully restored brick building which may have been an office building at one time.  Downstairs is appears to be more of a bar type area where drinking rules.  There is a second story where it appears to be more of a dining area.  There is also an outdoor patio area which really looks with about 10 tables which really looks like a nice place.  Ate on the second floor dining area.  The decor is pretty much the basic Irish Pub look, dark wood bootsh, wood floorks, kind of a dark atmosphere that was brightened by sunlight shining through the windows.  The menu is very basic barfood with an irish slant to it.  My freind had fish and chips and I had a cheeseburger.  To be honest, I wouldn't be drawn here by the food, but it wouldn't keep me away either.  Food was good.  Best part part about this place is that it's got this great atmosphere that's relaxing, you have a good selection of beers and you can have food or snacks thats satisfying.  To me thats worth a return trip or two."}
{"text":"My son and I were so hungry one nite. But did not won't to go out. We ordered food and we had it delivered through bite, which was also the first we used the services. I order the Banger and mash, my son ordered the shepherds pie. And also the Jamison Glazed wings.the food was out of this world. When it arrived it was hot. I have had a lot of British food. This food was very authentic completely surprised on the quality of the food. And on the Taste they have madea customer of me for life.        Also using bite. Delivery service for the first time. From now on I will use this delivery. Service the Delivery fee is very reasonable very reasonable in accuracy in time was amazing. The delivery person was very efficient and very friendly"}
{"text":"Having just returned from London and missing it, we decided to give Tyber Creek Pub a try.  Turns out, it's an Irish pub, but it fully reminded me of the English pubs we ducked into while in London.  As we soon discovered, it was a bit too much like a London pub.  It took us a few tries to realize that there is no real waiter service in London pubs.  You order from the bar and then someone brings your food out to your table, if you're lucky enough to find one.  Tyber Creek wasn't much different.  After waiting a little while, we discovered that we had to order our food from a little window and it was brought out to us.  Like London pubs, the menu was VERY limited and the food was just average, and the place was a little dingy with an obvious bar/musty smell.  If you're in the mood for something extra casual and just feel like standing around drinking, I guess it could be fun.  Me?  After working so much, I like to relax, sit down, and be served some delicious food in a fun and/or relaxing, clean atmosphere.  I can't find all that at Tyber Creek."}
{"text":"Finally made it to Tyber Creek for the first time! After all, it's been 2.5 years since I moved to Southend, so what's the rush...ha! Good beer selection with decent bar food in a dark atmosphere with old TV's...enough said."}
{"text":"We walked over for lunch because we were waiting for Sycamore Brewing to open. It looked like we were the first ones there at 12 on a Saturday, a little strange but who cares when you are sat quickly and the beer comes out quicker. The service was great Our waitress Lauren was attentive and she chatted with My mother in law and Aunt about her trips to Europe. My mother in law in heading there in September. Our food came out quick but not so fast as we couldn't enjoy drinks. The food was hot and fresh and cooked right, we sat outside in the patio area and they had fans on and with the breeze it was not to hot to be out in the sun. After we paid the tab we checked the games they had two cornhole setups and giant jenga. This place would great for happy hour with all that to keep busy. i will definitely be back and bring a crowd to enjoy everything they have to offer."}
{"text":"First time guest and i was impressed! I found the place through yelp and the reviews were spot on. The place is very cozy and perfect for a date night/fun time! I loved the candlelit tables. We started with the spinach dip appetizer and it was delicious !! Loved the pita bread. I had the steak sandwich and asparagus which was great as well. I loved the Irish cider. I definitely will return!"}
{"text":"Cornhole and Guinness what more could a man want?  Great bar to chill outside and grab a pint.  There is better bar food out there though why the 4 stars."}
{"text":"I probably enjoy this more than any other bar in South End (outside of breweries).  It's not too fratty like the light rail strip (All American, etc.) and it's a good time."}
{"text":"Good selection of beer and cool outdoor sitting. They also have these heaters outside which adds to the fun. I really wanted play ping pong but there were lot of people so dint get the opportunity."}
{"text":"I love this place. Especially my visit last night. The bartender (it starts with a C I think) is so awesome! I told her I was in a hurry and she made sure to get me in and out. She made me feel so welcomed and was so accommodating. Such a breath of fresh air. I'll be here very often. Stellar customer service and good food as well. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Kelly C. and I stopped in for a drink before the event at Pinot's Palette on a Wednesday hoping to grab a cider. I was unsure if they had any but I like the space Tyber has with an outdoor patio and fun games to play like cornhole and yard Jenga.   I've been here a handful of times, but actually never been inside. We sat at the bar, and lucky for us, they had Angry Orchard pints on draft for $5. That's definitely a +1 in my book. The bartenders were very nice while we sipped on our ciders and chatted. The bar was not very crowded at all around 5pm, so we didn't feel rushed to move.   A pleasant surprise on a sunny Wednesday, and a great way to start off the evening festivities."}
{"text":"Came in for a beer and ended up staying all night! Jon, mo and Jamie are some of the best bartenders around. I just found my new favorite spot!!"}
{"text":"Tyber Creek is an awesome neighborhood pub. My favorite part is the outdoor area. There are so many fun activities to take advantage of! Great for groups or even a fun stop after a casual date.   Some of my favorite nights are at Tyber with my friends playing darts and having drinks. Ok, that sounds dangerous... But seriously it's nice to have a neighborhood spot like Tyber!   It's my very own \"Smelly Cat\" or \"McLaren's\"- a place to be with friends!"}
{"text":"Went to Tyber Creek with some friends sat outside, ordered some drinks and food, the food came out cold and when I sent it back I guess it aggravated our none too friendly waitress Caitlin !  At 10pm without asking anyone at the table if they were done in fact there were still plates on the table she smacked down our tabs ! It wasn't that they were closing in fact she was still starting new tabs !  We weren't lingering actually none of us had finished our drinks , we only had two ! Guess having a third was not an option as Caitlin was done with us ! Shouldn't have sent the cold food back I guess !  I'm Irish and was embarrassed as this was NOT Irish hospitality as I know it ! I like the place and atmosphere but Caitlin if you don't like your job you should work else where !"}
{"text":"Went last night to Tyber creek pub for a dinner with a large group did not know what to expect .  The food was great the drinks were great and the service was outstanding .  Will go back.   Andrew"}
{"text":"Cool place to hang out and drink.. not a ton of seating, and the downstairs is pretty small. Other than that.. the place was crowded, and there was a nice patio area outside. They also have cornhole which is a big plus!!"}
{"text":"The hubby and I came here because we had a buy one entree get one free coupon.  We were here on a Tuesday night and there was hardly anyone else here.  This didn't bother me though because we had our choice of whatever table we wanted inside.  I enjoyed the ambiance in this place with a traditional pub feel.  They spiced things up a little with some mood lighting from the candles placed on every table and all along the bar.  I also liked the selection of music they were playing and it was at just the right volume.  We each ended up ordering the buffalo chicken sandwich and fries.  The sandwich tasted pretty good and it was actually sufficiently covered in buffalo sauce.  Add some blue cheese dressing and it hit the spot.  The fries were practically overflowing off my plate.  Unfortunately the fries tasted just like the kind we make at home in the frozen bag.  They had a decent draft beer selection (maybe 10 or so beers) but we came on a night without specials, with the exception of the daily $3 Guiness pint.  We ended our evening by playing some photo hunt at the bar.  I'm easily entertained.  I would come back here to hang out on a weeknight and grab a couple beers, preferably on a night with drink specials."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Very casual/dive bar feel to it.  The staff is very accommodating and friendly and the food is very good and reasonable.  The outside patio is smoke friendly and they have fans blowing when it is warm outside.  Definite Irish Pub feel to it, which makes me feel right at home!  Keep up the good work!  Bartenders are great!!"}
{"text":"Great food, great atmosphere, fair prices. I've come here every time I'm in Charlotte and will continue to do so. One of my favorite stops, assuming you get here when its not packed."}
{"text":"Yeah I like this bar, the bartenders are awesome and they make good drinks.  Its small and cozy and has a nice outdoor patio.  I haven't tried any of the food yet but its definitly one of my go to places in this part of town."}
{"text":"One of my absolute favorite pubs around Charlotte. Quaint and impossibly Irish. I frequent here often for a number of reasons:  #1: Beer. Good selection and modestly priced. Of course there are only a handful of tap, but they definitely stock some good non-commercial and local brews.   #2: Great food. I would rate it a 9 out of 10 for bar food. Potato cakes were a must for a long time but I feel they've skimped on the portion sizes lately. Love the wings, especially with the Jameson glaze! Decent burgers and chicken sandwiches. Word to the wise- don't ever order pizza from ANY Irish pub, especially if you're like me.. typical NY pizza snob.  #3: Atmosphere: Your typical Irish pub. Again, very quaint. Upstairs, downstairs, and outdoors. You can order from the bars on both levels. Low-lighted. Outside is key weather-permitting. TV's and games set up.  #4: Vicinity to uptown. Just outside the city in Southend, \"usually\" easy to get to.  #5: Events. Three words- JAMESON. WHISKEY. DINNERS. There's also live music on weekends and one of the best places to be for St. Patty's and the World Cup.   #6: Staff. I purposely saved this for last. The staff here is great. Friendly and always quick to take your order. I've never had bad service, let alone less than perfect service here.   Still taking those Yelp app coupons..."}
{"text":"A group of 6 of us wanted to enjoy some Irish fare on St. Patrick's Day so my brother found Tyber Creek Pub for us to try.  The parking sitiation was pretty dicey but we did all find spots.  They had a tent up for a band and plenty of outside seating.  There was a bit of a nip in the air so we were seated inside- no wait.  We were ushered to the upstairs to a hightop that we kinda had to squeeze into.  The waitress brought us water in a large bottle and small glasses so we could hust pour what we wanted.  We had a couple that would have liked a go at the dart board but one group monopolized it the entire time we were there.  We placed our orders and it was a fairly lengthy wait but we were in good company so it wasn't too bad.  When the orders did come out, only one was incorrect and had to be sent back-my son is not a big cheese eater and his burger, ordered with only catsup and onions, came covered in cheese.  When it came back, they had only wiped off most of the cheese.  We just let it go as we didn't want to spend our entire day there but it did tick me off and he didn't eat much of his burger.  This is why I didn't give them 5 stars.  My fish and chips tasted very good as did my fries.  I particularly liked the tarter sauce.  Can't pinpoint what exactly was in it but it was good.  2 in our party ordered the Shepherds pie and said it was delicious.  My brother got the corned beef and cabbage and raved about how well it was cooked.  One got bangers and mash and judging by the clean plate, she very much enjoyed it.  Our waitress kept our glasses full and was pretty attentive especially as busy as they were.  I would go back but would have handled the burger situation differently.  I would definitely insisted on a new burger."}
{"text":"Best PUB in town!  They have the friendliest bartenders (and TIM), wide selection of cold draft beer and an awesome atmosphere.  I love that you can go there and have a conversation with friends, without screaming over loud music.  Except, when there is a band.  And in that case, you are singing along. Their pizza is one of the best in town too!"}
{"text":"To be honest, it's a good bar, but today was one of the most important days of the year for me, the day of the birth of our Lord Beyonce and I simply requested the DJ Fish to play Beyonce at midnight and I PAID him to do so, and does he? He plays a mere snipped of one lame ass excuse of a 7/11 remix and calls it a day. Anyone in the Beyhive knows that this is the most important day of the year and as this is the 10th anniversary of B Day album, this is extremely important. DJ Fish is NOT in formation to say the least. He didn't countdown with us, he didn't put the love on top, he doesn't \"still care\". Next time I give a tip, my 1+1 +dollars hopefully will be RESPECTED."}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere-has a little bit of everything. You can chill on the patio, play cornhole, hear live music, saddle up at the bar inside or even sit upstairs to eat-late night they have DJs to drink/dance the night away! Some of the best bartenders in Charlotte-great place to visit.  Some of my favs are the apps (esp the pimento/cheese dips).  They always have drinks specials, too."}
{"text":"We just ate here for lunch and it was absolutely, positively the most horrendous service I have ever received at a restaurant.  We waited over 1 hour and 45 minutes for our food and the only reason we didn't just walk was they kept saying it was on it's way.. obviously a lie.  Then we found out that they mixed our ticket up with someone else's... they clearly had not even looked into the problem for the last hour we were asking about the food and people that were seated 45 minutes after us were receiving theirs!!  That is just laziness.  There was minimal apology from the manager and absolutely zero remorse or apology from the waitress who had clearly not done anything to advocate for us in the kitchen.  On top of that, the shepherd pie was bland and the salad was doused in dressing.  Coming out for lunch with the office and it taking over 2 hours to eat is absolutely unacceptable.  We used to come here regularly after work, but after today we will NEVER be back."}
{"text":"Boyfriend and I were looking for a place around to area to grab a bite to eat, discovered this place on yelp and decided to give it a try. As I was walking to the front door, I noticed how large the outdoor seating area was. It seemed like a fun time to enjoy the night out at.   The hostess sat us at a table upstairs. Boyfriend and I decided to split the Potato Cakes (50% off appetizers when you check in on Yelp), a cup of Potato Leek soup & Shepherd's Pie. After we ordered the waitress came back to inform us that food would take 30 minutes.. Whoa, but since we were there we decided to wait. So, I decided to pass the time with a yummy Magners Irish Cider. I really enjoyed the appetizer and soup, the Shepherd's pie was alright.   I would definitely come back to enjoy a few beers outside and play games since it seemed like such a chill spot."}
{"text":"We love Monday Bingo and all the fun events that they host here! This is definitely a great irish bar in Southend!  Our favorite eats are 1. Fish and Chips  2. Chicken and Goat Cheese Wrap  3. Buffalo Chicken Wings (extra crispy)  4. Jameson Wings (these were okay)"}
{"text":"Very busy, very loud. But had a great time. The outside patio is beautiful at night especially when it's lit up. Great beer choices and good food. Their fish and chips is not to bad."}
{"text":"The one star is based on the food.  I brought my wife her for Mother's Day because she likes to have an Irish breakfast. So she ordered the Irish breakfast and the egg yokes were solid. The black and white pudding - well the servings should not have even been plated one was maybe the size of a quarter in circumference or diameter.  I thought rasher came with the meal should've asked but there was no rasher. This is a common component of an \"Irish\" breakfast. I ordered the corned beef hash with sunny side up egg - yoke cook to solid state. Personally,  I would not come here for food ever again.   Yes they gave us a free Guinness but that does not make up for a terrible meal."}
{"text":"Tyber Creek is usually always a good bet for a Birthday celebration, some football watching, or just a random chill hang out night. This past weekend wasn't much different, however I will say it's lost some of it's charm. Tyber Creek has been remodeled a few times in the years that it's sat on it's quaint little corner. Every time it gets remodeled I feel a little of it's charm is lost and it's trying to get too upscale. That's just a personal preference though since I've been coming here for a long LONG time. Also the menu is a bit sad. Not a lot to choose from when it comes down to it. So in our group (at least what I tried) we had a pub burger (not bad but the bread was rather hard on the bottom), a chicken sandwich (okay but nothing special) and the steak kabobs which were amazing and what I'd order the next time I come in. The fries were good as well. I also tried the chocolate cake which was okay but why why why must every single piece of chocolate cake be covered in ganache instead of frosting?? Sigh... Anyways service was great, we watched the game and that was a great experience. After the game the DJ started up and he was decent enough; played a lot of old school stuff which was cool. All in all I'm giving 4 stars rather than 5 because the food just wasn't great and their menu is super small."}
{"text":"I've come here a few times for drinks after school with a small group and it has always been great. I think I'd only eaten here 1x before though. A larger group of us came this weekend and had a phenomenal time. Everyone was happy with their food. NO complaints. I had the blackened chicken/goat cheese sandwich and it was actually blackened (unlike some places) the seasonings were amazing and so delicious. Everything was exactly how we ordered.  The only complaint I have is that we were seated and then told we had to move because another party had reserved the section. It wouldn't have been a problem had we been told that when we arrived. The least that could have been done was a free app."}
{"text":"We went on a weekday for dinner.  the place was pretty much empty.  we sat at the bar, unfortunately we sat at the end where there was this loud speaker, lol.  we dint care to move.  We order the spinach and artichoke dip and a chicken wrap.  both were good, nothing special though."}
{"text":"Went here to meet up with some friends. They have a nice outdoor seating area with TVs so we could keep up with the NCAA game that was playing. They have a good selection of beer, however, I was disappointed with their specialty drink selection. Only a few to choose from and none of them were too appealing. I tried the one that I thought looked the best, but ended up sending it back and just decided to order beer. But it was a good place to meet up with a group so I would recommend it."}
{"text":"Tyber Creek is a great example of a risk-reward type of place. You definitely run the risk of the following: drunk idiots who are all wearing the same thing (polo shirts and khakis or plaid shorts), a crowded bar, and the potential to lose your voice talking to the people you are with due to the LOUDNESS of the place, both downstairs and upstairs where DJs and bands play. I also enjoy the outside area, which is where I like to head when the weather is nice.  If you can handle all of that, you are likely to enjoy yourself, as there is good music, $2 Guinness draughts, and a great place to observe funny drunken behavior.  Definitely a younger clientele, similar to that of Angry Ale's. Not the type of place I want to frequent, but an amusing and sometimes fun place to hit up every now and then."}
{"text":"Vibe here is great. Came around midnight so the kitchen was closed but the patio was kinda cool. Only thing I can comment on is my drinks. My smithwicks was good but can the bartender chill the vodka in a cherry bomb? The redbull and vodka were both warm. That's a lazy mistake. Also makes the shot awful."}
{"text":"Amazing food and beer selection. The bar tender Celeste was awesome. I had bangers and mash, which was bangin'. It was so cool to find a legit Irish pub in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Amazing free cranberry biscuits for brunch. Lovely patio, dog friendly and never too busy to get a table right away! Staff is very sweet, so I will become a regular here from now on."}
{"text":"Ok, this place can be a great little neighborhood bar- they have a nice Irish pub feel and plenty of beers on draft.  If you were to go here  Sunday-Wednesday this place would prob receive 4 stars.  Unfortunately, this place has the most horrible clientele.  This is yuppie central, especially on Thursday nights, and the people that come to this bar just suck.  I will leave you with this story-  The last time I went there on a Thursday night (when they have $2 drafts, which is cool) a guy i went to high school with hit on me, and it was clear to me he had no idea that we knew each other.  After I reminded him, he happened to mention (while he was hitting on me) that another girl we went to high school with was upstairs waiting for him to return with her drink- this guy is a winner.  I'll admit i thought it was funny that he was such an idiot and that the girl was upstairs waiting cluelessly for him to return, but this is not the kind of behavior I want to deal with when I'm trying to drink.   So pretty much, go during their off-times for a quiet drink or some food or be prepared to deal with drunk, stupid, wannabe social climbers."}
{"text":"Looking for good bar food we decided to try Tyber Creek Pub.  We were greeted by a smiling hostess whom asked if we wanted to sit upstairs or down by the bar.  We decided to sit down by the bar.  The bench was incredibly uncomfortable.  But the bar area was as uncommon as any bar in any city across the country.  I excused myself to the ladies room and though tidy I was pretty grossed out with how dirty the floors (especially the corners) were.   While in the ladies room my husband ordered a Jameson on the rocks (for him) and a Jack Daniels Honey Whisky for me.  When the bartender brought the drinks over he spoke to us in his Irish accent...jokingly I told him \"Can you just talk to me all night?\"  I say it was joke because my husband was sitting with me!  He must have taken offense to it because he said \"I am married!\"  Easy Buddy - so am I - it was a total joke.  After he left it was obvious he sent another server over to wait on us.   My husband ordered a Reuben and I ordered a steak sandwich.  Our wait was not long and our food was delivered by yet another server.  My husband's Reuben was really small but he said it was tasty.  My sandwich though good - I could taste the charcoal from the grill.  Both of us were given an abundant amount of over salted fries.   Once done with our meal our plates were whisked away and our server a very sweet young lady chatted with us about Charlotte and hometowns.   The bill with drinks was a little over $35 reasonable.  However with all the great places around the Southend area - it is doubtful we will return anytime soon."}
{"text":"There is always an amazing band or artist performing here. I like every single one I have seen. They have a really cool location in south end and comfortable dark, exposed wood, homey feeling bars up and downstairs.  I love the food especialy the egg, steak, and cheese wrap!  Most delicious bar menu item I have EVER had.  They have outdoor seating as well and cornhole for the drinker that likes to be active.  Pool tables and darts upstairs and the staff is beyond friendly.  Great place to start or end your night....or hang out all day on the weekend."}
{"text":"Great place to grab drinks, enjoy the warmer weather on the patio, and engage in Irish festivities. The food is decent, some menu items are definitely better than others. Their drinks are always on par and the staff and service are always pleasant. They often host Irish themed events which are always a blast. Parking is tight when it's crowded, but it's easy to walk to from other lots. Tyber is one of our favorite casual places for date night and to meet up with family/friends."}
{"text":"First time here, and probably the last.  We went for dinner and not drinks.  The food was borderline OK.  It appears to be more of a drinking spot.  However, the staff were very friendly."}
{"text":"I came here again today to watch the World Cup and once again was not disappointed. If your a fan of soccer and want to watch the World Cup this is a great place to see it. For the 2nd weekend in a row I sat upstairs and had a great view of the tv. They have the matches on the speakers as well so you can listen and watch (I've been to other bars where it's only on tv with no volume). On to the food. We ordered the spinach and artichoke dip and it was excellent. I will definitely order this again. They have a good draft beer list to go with the food."}
{"text":"Walking in expecting to see a hostess or something, we kind of just meandered in and found a table. The backless stools looked brand new yet still fit with the old world pub feel. We were greeted by the barkeep who came out to take our orders. We had one menu to look at to make our selections.   Small but sufficient bar food menu and a decent jumbled listing of beers. They were all written in one run on sentence like paragraph using commas to separate them so i really couldn't say how many drafts they had. i know i had Big Boss Blanco Diablo and a $3 Guinness.  Thursday is $3 pint night for all drafts i believe, but everyday is $3 Guinness day.  i went with the buffalo chicken sandwich which apparently comes with a super sized  extra large amount of fries. Plain old fries that could use some love from a seasoning salt of some sort. The buffalo was decent and the chicken was a hearty portion.  Overall, i liked our service and meal. Can't say i'd recommend coming solely for the meal, unless you come armed with the Entertainment coupon then it is definitely worth trying (bogo entree) or if you are longing for an authentic pub feel and are going to have some drinks. (i've never been to a real pub, but it seems authentic),  i imagine we'll venture back if for nothing else to use the 2011 Entertainment Book coupon."}
{"text":"This is one of my top three bar I hang out at. I love this place. I found it while attending a yelp happy hour event (which we need to start doing again). It just has a great vibe about it. I love the bar staff they make great drink and loves to have conversation. The food is good and out door space is perfect to chill summer or winter. When ever my friends and I have night out on the town we make sure we stop here. Thursday they have live music and Friday and Saturday they have a DJ. I say it enough I really enjoy hanging out here and you should check it out."}
{"text":"Awesome spot. Very Irish Pub for food. Traditional dishes, great flavor. Outside they have bar games like Jenga and bags. Inside they have TVs and football. It was turned up very loud so if you want to see the game, it's a good spot. Upstairs had a band and an event. Good to know they do that too. Great spot overall."}
{"text":"Been here a handful of times for beverages, yet to go for food. Great selection of drinks, fair prices, only complaint is the amount of time it can take to get a drink at the bar.   My last experience was a Saturday afternoon, not that busy, still waited close to five minutes for a beer."}
{"text":"Food was good. Service was completely  absent. 20-25min to get water. Food came out at different times. One main meal was never put in and after finally getting the attention of the server, waiting 30-45min, to address this issue the order had to be switched as take out because it took that long. This meant not eating with my group for which I am very upset. Service had to be waved down for attention. By the end, I had to wave payment just to pay. With this little attention on thier tables or concern for payment, if this happens again, I will walk out.    It was embarrassing to have invited friends to dinner here. I was not expecting this due to other ratings. Not sure if this is due to being a Friday night.  I would not recommend coming here to eat on Friday nights.   In regards to food, the artichoke dip, potatoes leek, and bangers was good. Shepard pie was not impressive but not sure if it was due to it being put for take out. It looked like slop."}
{"text":"First time here. My boyfriend called to ask about a game to be shown on TV ahead of time. We walk in and they have a table reserved just for us...outside...on the patio! Just perfect for our Saturday evening! Very accommodating, excellent service!  We'll be back for sure to check out the food :)"}
{"text":"Really great pub! The two hunky Irish bartenders are awesome! Love the vibe good beer selection ... Did not eat but wings smelled awesome!"}
{"text":"This is the only place I will get the best poured Guinness! Love the staff because they are always welcoming. Go a few times and they know exactly who you are and what you drink of choice is (except on the days where you like to add a shot to it).  I love going there early in the afternoon or when they are later into their evening to see all the coo coos. Finally tried some appetizers last time I went. Delicious! Wings were cooked to order on the first try (that means a whole lot),Steak skewers (hubby had) were cooked just enough & very juicy. I also adore the fact that no matter what you will always find a group to chat with."}
{"text":"What a shame since warm beer lines are lame....  I was inspecting the local watering holes in the hood and ventured over to TCP. This is a gothic Irish watering hole....it smells of beer and is worn from years of merry making! HOME! However, every home has their skeletons in the closet and TCP is no exception. I stopped in early Friday evening to get a ice cold pint of beer....For those of you with weak stomachs this next part of the review will shock you.....as my pint was being poured the head of dread appeared. The tap was pouring all foam. What the hell!?! This could me only one thing.....warm beer! The barkeep was great and after about a dozen pints I probably would have proposed to her at least a dozen times but alas the warm beer was the wedge in our potential relationship.   I was informed that during the heat of the summer jungle months that the beer comes about a bit tepid! NOOOOOOOOO! What did that beer do to you!??!! Plus you are pissing away profits in foam! What a shame since the Irish in me hoped and yes prayed I found the promised land of drinking...I will be back in the fall when the temps die down!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite weekend spots in Charlotte to visit, enjoy a draft or two and some great authentic Irish food. Caitlin is the best! She is very attentive, always makes some great recommendations on both food and drink."}
{"text":"Tyber Creek is pretty close to my boyfriend's house, so we were hoping it could be our neighborhood bar (or something like that). But the crowds there are way too fratty for us and, as others have mentioned, the place is insanely loud. Plus, I hate when it's a battle just to get to the bar to order a drink. Going out drinking should not be that hard.    The bright sides: $2 drafts on Thursdays. And It's right off the light rail, so if you're coming from uptown or farther south you can take public transit there. If you live in South End or Dilworth, Tyber Creek is probably within walking distance for you, which is another perk."}
{"text":"Awesome pub with great food, great atmosphere and great service and staff. Had an awesome time there last Thursday. Best spinach artichoke dip ever, perfect steak sandwich, delicious bangers and mash. You won't be disappointed at this place."}
{"text":"Love Tyber Creek Pub. I started going there several months ago. The bartenders and staff are so, so friendly. And they are friendly every time I go in there! The bar area is small, but very cozy & welcoming. The bottled beer is cold. I always get the fish-n-chips and it is outstanding. The fish is always fresh, cooked perfectly and is THE best fish-n-chips I have had in Charlotte. There is a regular crowd that hangs out there, but I never feel out of place! When the weather is warm, the outdoor patio area is awesome!"}
{"text":"Tyber creek is always a blast! Their food is good (although expensive for what it is), there's also a good vibe, friendly staff, nothing not to love."}
{"text":"Recommend this place for late-nights or during the summer. Guinness was poured just right and they had cider on tap. Food was just ok."}
{"text":"We were looking for a family friendly, fun place, to watch the World Cup.  They got an outside patio, inside bar area, and another bar and lounge area upstairs.  We elected the upstairs area and settled in to watch the match.  Majority of us all ordered Fish and Chips, with one dissenter, electing a burger.  Food was hot, fresh and tasteful!  Fun times and very family friendly!"}
{"text":"Had a couple of beer specials on a Saturday night and an open upstairs area with darts, pool, and shuffleboard. Stopped by here as the second stop of a bar crawl. It was pretty empty when we got there (at around 9:30pm), but the sheer size of our group got the place hopping. Those stairs can be slightly treacherous if you've had a couple of the on special drinks. The downstairs bar area is dimly lit and probably a good place to just sit and drown your sorrows with alcohol...but that's sad, so don't do that.   For future reference: At about 2 blocks from the East/West Blvd light rail stop, it's a perfect distance for a crawl. And with a ton of bar games, a great place to spend more time at."}
{"text":"You're out on a Saturday night and you're not ready to call it a night.  \"Just one more drink!\"  \"Food sounds so good right now!\"  This was me last weekend.  With all the places to go in South End, I was really just looking for a place with good food and beer that wasn't crowded with standing, drunk people.  I wondered into Tyber Creek Pub and since it was well past dinner time, there was no issue getting a table outside.  This place has a fun atmosphere.  They can accommodate large groups with their community tables (or smaller 4-tops if you don't feel like being social with anyone but the friends you came with).  Everyone looking like they were having a good time hanging out and watching the game, so it made for a nice, friendly, casual atmosphere.  The waitress I had was excellent.  I can never tell if I'm going to get good pub food or a greasy mess, but she gave us some pretty decent recommendations.  I tried the salad, the spinach dip and the sausage plate.  Overall, food wasn't totally out of this world, but based on what I had and the clean plates I saw around me, it's a pretty solid place to get a bite to eat.  If you looking to halfway watch a game, have some beer/apps, and hang out with friends, I would throw Tyber Creek Pub on your list of places to go."}
{"text":"You know, this place says it's an Irish style pub, but nothing really screams Irish to me...  That isn't to say it's a bad place, mind you... It just feels more like a regular bar than an Irish pub, in my opinion...   My favorite part about this place?  The bartenders... So helpful and sweet... Totally willing to carry drinks to the table for you from the bar...  We had a pretty large crew and we were all taken care of very well... I also enjoyed the bouncers... Well, the one upstairs, specifically... He was very sweet but I also got the distinct feeling he could headlock someone in a second, if the need arose... lol    The spicy mozzarella sticks are huge... I don't like those, but the people that had them said they were really good, so I guess they're a safe bet, if that's your thing... I had a couple of the Tyber wings with the Sweet Chili sauce and they were fairly decent for bar food... I really enjoyed their specialty shot with Bacardi 151 and a couple other things in it...  It's called the Tyber something... It was decently priced as well, so that was a plus...   One thing that was kind of lame to me is that I didn't see a purse hook anywhere in their ladies room... Maybe I missed it, but I thought those were pretty standard nowadays...  They have a really cool outdoor patio with cornhole boards, so I'm sure this place rocks fairly well in the summer... I've only been there a couple times, but it's a good hang..."}
{"text":"Solid bar, dancing is average and kinda divery upstairs and smells. Drinks are ok.  Food 5/10 Service 6/10 Parking 8/10 Location 7/10 Music 9/10 TVs 3/10"}
{"text":"Fish & Chips were very good! Tender and flacks inside and crisp batter outside.  Excellent wait staff, on top if everything! Sat outside and watched football game with locals. Good people! Had extra out door area for games: Darts, Bean Bag Toss, Frisbee toss, Giant Jenga Wood Blocks."}
{"text":"So I needed a beer and had never been to Tyber Creek.  Not sure what's kept me from going, maybe I think I had the feeling it was a little neighborhood joint and it's not IN my neighborhood or something.    Either way, this is a pretty cool, sort of outdated, friendly bar.  Irish bar with plenty of great and cold beers on tap as well as an appetizer and bar menu that can compete with the best of them.  Friendly bartenders keep the drinks coming and it's not hard to tell why people like this place.  It is definitely a come as you are kind of place and I like that."}
{"text":"One of the heavy hitters when it comes to the fish and chips offerings in Charlotte, and all around solid menu of Irish fare from brunch to dinner.  2¢- This is one of the places where you can almost guarantee that you'll get a properly poured Guinness (pleasantly surprised that this rule still applied to each pint in our group even on St Patrick's  day this last Saturday when the house was packed).  Pro tip- room for groups in the upstairs"}
{"text":"Fun place to go when you're in the South End on the weekends.  They always have a great DJ spinning some good tunes to dance to and the atmosphere is lively.  I've only drank at Tyber Creek (and mostly it's been beer), but I do know we've always had good service and always had a great time."}
{"text":"Totally a fan.  Used to live right around the corner and could very easily walk there.  I truly enjoy all the bartenders' company and their playlists!  You can always bet on a good mix of people who are either enjoying the pints of Guinness or the pool table and dance floor upstairs.  You can't go wrong in a place where they actually know how to correctly pour a Guinness.  I always like to get a \"snakebite\" which is Harp and Cider mixed together.  It's refreshing and sweet but after about two it's a little overwhelming.  For a long time, this was our neighborhood bar.  We would usually show up after dining hours strictly to party, and that we did, and that we will continue to do."}
{"text":"Bar has a very nice vibe, casual atmosphere, relaxed. It's a very solid bar and easy parking.  Menu could be a little more interesting, but the draft selection is solid."}
{"text":"For my girlfriend's 50th birthday, she wanted a big party with all her friends.  I called Tyber Creek a few months in advance and they reserved the upstairs bar area for me for free.  A few days before the event, I called back and ordered the medium size Party Package, which they assured me would be enough for 50 people.  I, also, asked that they be ready with 50 shots at 7pm for the birthday toast and reminded me I might want to bring a cake (Oops!)  When we got there about 6pm, they took the cake off my hands and assured me it would be brought up at 7pm.  We went upstairs to find they had the upstairs bar area set up.  We had a dedicated bartender and waitress (plus others who helped out as need be).  They clearly had already been briefed about the shot, food and cake.  And nobody went long without a drink in hand.  They started setting out the food, with hot food over sterno, plates, etc.  By the end of the night, I was pleasantly surprised that there were still a few chicken tenders and some dip left - but not much!  Good value for the money and a real pleasure not having to order any more food part way through the party.  At 7pm sharp, they brought the cake up, having already put the candles on it, along with plates, forks and a knife.  The bartender was just finished pouring the shots.  I didn't have to remind them, which was very impressive.  At the end of the night, my sweetheart managed to twist her ankle, so I whisked her away home.  It wasn't until the next day that I found out we'd left several gifts, mostly wine, at the bar.  They had put it ALL in the office and kept it safe until we picked it up.  That really says something about the honestly and ethics of the staff.  I highly recommend Tyber Creek Pub for groups of 50 or more.  Very professional and a pleasure to work with.   And having had the occasional beer there, I know it is a first rate neighborhood bar, as well."}
{"text":"This place is great! It has an old Irish feel and the food is pretty stellar. They have outdoor games and a great outdoor seating area. Super fun for pleasant weather. They have Crispin on tap- which is a big plus for me. The only downside is it is VERY packed on Friday and Saturday nights (well duhh) but it's not so much how packed is it, as how wasted everyone is. The belligerent folk come out and it can be pretty amusing, but seriously loud. I recommend going on a different night unless you love to people watch."}
{"text":"This place is . The drinks, the food, it's all amazing. Especially the kabobs. They've also got pretty frequent, fun events."}
{"text":"An Irish-style pub and therefore they have Guinness on tap. This was one of our stops on the Light Rail Bar Crawl and so the timing was short. Rather than wait for the Guinness to settle, I had a draft Harpoon.  Upstairs is a whole different area and yes, there is a proper bar upstairs with the usual selection of draft and bottled beers plus spirits. The two bartenders working that night were friendly but it was hard to hear anything over the rather loud music. Fortunately, we managed to escape before the DJ started spinning tunes.  Of the bars we hit during the Crawl, this was my favorite."}
{"text":"First pub that we came to after moving to Charlotte.  Shoutout to the server Erin, she's awesome at all of it.  We will def be returning :)"}
{"text":"Great drink prices and atmosphere, I love love love the outdoor seating and activity area with corn hole, janga and ping pong! Can't wait to go back and enjoy some whiskey for an awesome price and might have to try some food too!! Great job !!"}
{"text":"Really love coming here. The atmosphere is chill and they have a nice outdoor seating area with tv's. They have corn hole for some outside activity. The food is average. But I really come here for a drink and just hang out with friends. Good location with a decent size parking lot. Gets pretty packed on Friday and Saturday nights. (Like most places do) Overall I would suggest coming here if you are looking for a laid back place to drink."}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere- food was good! Came on St. Patrick's day during the day and they had a special menu for it. Got the Reuben which was good regretted not getting the corn beef and cabbage after seeing someone else having it! Specials on domestic beer and a lot of local drafts."}
{"text":"Tyber Creek Pub is a little bit tucked away off of South Blvd, but let's call it a pseudo-hidden gem. This place is great, whether you're looking for a quiet drink with friends or a wild night out on the town. Tyber Creek has a very saloon-y feel: dark with wood everywhere, if that makes any sense. There's a downstairs area that's a little more mellow, and then a raucous upstairs space, complete with its own bar and plenty of bar game fixtures (that game with the sliding things and the sawdust? you know what i'm talking about). Great music playing, great crowds, and just an overall fun vibe every time I've been in here.   Check out on a Monday or Tues if you're looking for a quieter evening. if you're looking to really throw-down, try a Friday or Saturday night and you wont be disappointed."}
{"text":"Four of us stopped in for a quick bite before a movie downtown. I tend to like pub food, but we were a little disappointed. I expect a place like this to have some bar smell, but this place was a little too much. Took away some of our appetite.  The lamb sliders were way over done. meat was black. The sausage plate was ok, but they only gave us two varieties of sausage, and they were kinda skinny. And the fish and chips was two small/medium sized pieces for $13.00.   I would have given them two stars if the place didn't smell so bad.   I really wanted to like the place. The staff seemed nice. We were just in too much of a hurry to complain about the food."}
{"text":"So unexpected!! The spinach and artichoke dip was amazing. With a suggestion from our server,we added pita bread to our dip, and it was perfect.Shannon, our server, was so helpful and incredibly accommodating. I have dined at Tyber before, but this was such a memorable experience I had to share."}
{"text":"I've heard great things about this place, so it's possible that my expectations were too high and therefore I was slightly disappointed.   I arrived on a Tuesday evening, around 5:30 and the place was completely empty. I wasn't looking to party so that was entirely fine. It was pretty warm outside so I chose to sit inside at the bar while I waited for a friend to show up. First of all, the inside was SO dark...which isn't good or bad, just interesting. After a few minutes of the bartender staring at me while talking to some guy - who didn't seem like he worked there but was standing behind the bar with her -she reluctantly came over to take my order. I ordered a glass of wine, and she sighed, grabbed a wine glass, and continued her discussion with random-behind-the-bar-guy with my wine glass in hand all the while wiping it down with some dish rag. Like...is it dirty....? Wet...? Anyway finally she poured some wine in it and I thanked her and paid. I took a sip and then looked up to see that the bartender and random-behind-the-bar-guy were standing DIRECTLY in front of me staring as I drank my wine while continuing their conversation. I felt awkward so obviously I thought I will pretend to be doing something on my phone...nope, no service. The entire scenario was so strange and uncomfortable I found a hostess and asked to be seated outside.  The hostess was delightful and after a while my friend arrived and we were served by an incredibly sweet girl (I believe her name was Brittany?) and I really enjoyed the rest of my time there.  I guess my advice is if you come here do not expect good service at the bar.......get a table."}
{"text":"REMODELED!  Went in here on Friday afternoon to grab a drink, man... what a difference a remodel makes.  The upstairs is totally redone:  they \"un\"-blacked-out the windows and put frosting on it so it lets a lot more light in.... really opened up the space and also got rid of that weird \"stage\" level with the railing that had all the tvs and video games located on it.  The whole upstairs is totally one level... and is very open, inviting, airy, and chill.  There are new bathrooms upstairs as well so no more stumbling down dark stairs (you can see now!) to go use the restroom.  I asked the barkeep how long ago the renovations had been completed and she said it had been about 3 months.  They also did away with the quick bar food type menu and have a chef.  Everything is homemade and delicious (according to the bar keep).  I ended up trying the pimento cheeseburger with bacon.... man I was not disappointed by the hype that the bartender put in me while telling me about this sandwich.  The great thing is that the food is Delicious and affordable."}
{"text":"It was very dark in there! Hard to see on the stairs and they sort of forgot about us upstairs Bc it took forever to get the waitress each time. The food was pretty good though! We left right before bingo hahah"}
{"text":"After a late brunch at Tyber I feel like my previous review needs to be updated. I had such an excellent meal that I will write off the cabbage experience as an unfortunate mishap.   Since dating a Brit I have completely adopted one aspect of his culture - the full English Breakfast. Now at Tyber Creek it is an Irish Breakfast but it is basically the same thing. They definitely have this meal down perfectly. I especially liked that they let me sub extra rashers instead of the puddings (one white and one black). I almost never try to sub out at restaurants but #sorrynotsorry I just can't get past how they make black pudding. Now instead of having a plate with food I wasn't going to eat I had extra delicious English style bacon. AT NO EXTRA CHARGE. I must highlight that point because I am sure rashers are a speciality item and across the street at Big Ben they charge $2.25 just for a single extra Yorkshire pudding. Tyber Creek gets major bonus points for this small free substitution. My love can be bought with bacon.  The waitress and bartender were very attentive throughout the whole meal. Now it isn't really a brunch place but somewhere you can get a hearty English Breakfast until late in the day and it was so delicious we will definitely return."}
{"text":"Update: Not a fan of the menu change! The things I pointed out as fantastic (pizzas and pimento cheese) were removed! The new black bean burger is lacking in flavor and mushy."}
{"text":"Chill spot for getting some drinks at a good price. Good outside area and small dance floor upstairs. I haven't tried the food yet."}
{"text":"I think this place is a pretty cool spot in South End. Friendly bartenders, plenty of parking, cold beer, and it even boasts an outdoor space. I was lucky enough to snag some of their appetizers at a Yelp event yesterday and have to say their basil pesto is delectable. I heard more than a few comment on bottling that delicious concoction! The place was recently remodeled so check it out !"}
{"text":"I came here on a Sunday and I so wish I had found this place earlier.  I have been looking for a place that had other forms of entertainment than just people watching and I finally found Tyber Creek.  I loved the dark pub feel and how they had not only an upstairs but also outside seating.  Half of the beers on tap I had never even heard of so I decided to taste test them (and they let me!) and all but one were great!  I can't speak for what it's like on a Saturday night, but for a relaxed Sunday funday, I couldn't think of a better place to go.  Cornhole, shuffleboard, outside seating, friendly staff and patrons, and cheap yet unique beer.  Yay!  Plus the nachos weren't too bad either."}
{"text":"After about 30 stops around Charlotte trying to find the best reuben (with a few left to check out), my reuben at Tyber Creek still stands out as one of the highlights of the adventure. The reuben at Tyber is unbelievable and a must-try spot if you're looking for a great reuben around the Queen City.  The corned beef was the first thing you notice - thick, clearly hand-carved cuts off a meat clearly done in-house. This was far from the deli meat served on most reubens around Charlotte. It tasted like St Patty's Day inside the surrounding rye bread. The kraut was fantastic, adding that pickled flavor a reuben requires, and the cheese was flavorful enough to be enjoyed in each bite. The bread was the only thing about the reuben that didn't stand out, and something other than standard marbled rye (something locally baked maybe?) would have made this reuben perfect. The experience was great and without a doubt I'll be back to enjoy another reuben from Tyber."}
{"text":"I love the close proximity of Tyber Creek Pub to our home and it's a great place to grab a beer after work!  This was our first visit and it was pretty good;  pictures attached.  We had the meat skewers, tuna tacos, a grilled chicken salad, and a pimento cheeseburger with bacon.  The salad was pretty good and basic but the chicken was great quality.  The skewer was only okay, the tuna tacos were good but not great.  My brother had the burger and enjoyed it.  He compared it to Bad Daddy's with far less grease.    The outdoor seating is great and I look forward to visiting again in the fall.  It was a big hot and probably should have sat indoors, but it was great to see the newly renovated area.    On the next visit, I'll sample the traditional irish fare.  With Big Ben across the street serving up excellent authentic English fare, I'm hopeful this one can be comparable so I can have a good Irish place to visit on a cold winter night!  ... More to come ..."}
{"text":"Prime patio dining here. They have a great setup with a mix of outdoor booths and tables. They also have games and live music. Looks like they also have heaters for when it's chilly. Did not even venture inside.   Great tequila special on Thursdays, which you can also order a margarita with at a discounted price. Had to have a Guinness while I was here too. Of course.   Started with the spinach dip (half off thanks to Yelp!). Honestly one of the best spinach dips I have had. Next time I will get with the pita instead. After much debate between pizza and reuben I went with the Reuben...because lets be honest I wanted fries. When it came out I thought the portion was a little small, but I only ended up eating half anyway with the spinach dip app. Great flavor and loved the fries too!   Our service was not great, empty drinks for quite a while, but I think our waitress was new.   Great spot in South End for dinner and/or drinks!"}
{"text":"Gotta love a remodel! Tyber Creek was due for a little love and they did a really great job.   Beyond the nicely put together two floors, spacious bars and plenty of seating, Tyber offers a really sweet patio. Whether you care to enjoy a Guinness after work or are itching to play some cornhole, this is a perfect place to do so. Bartenders are friendly and the overall vibe is relaxed and easy. Bonus points for great daily drink specials!   As for the eats, the menu also received a fairly nice redo as well! I was particularly fond of the pesto dip to go along with the fresh and toasty pita triangles. While the spicy cheese sticks sounded scrumptious, I kept hoping that my next bite would be spicier. That just gives me more of a reason to come back and try a few more apps!"}
{"text":"Is it weird I like to order pizza at an Irish pub?   I love Tyber Creek. I don't even live in South End, but I find myself here a lot. The one consistent theme: I always have a good time.. day drinking, after work cocktails, a place to kick off the evening or to end a blurry night.  What can you expect? The place is dark. The patio is pretty spectacular. The bartenders know how to pour a Guinness correctly. I don't drink the stuff (unless it's in the form of a car bomb), but I give them props for doing it right. It's insane here for St. Patrick's Day. Tyberpalooza is super fun. What is that? An annual two day event that happens every CIAA weekend. Live music, flip cup and cornhole tourneys. They bring in a big ass heated tent for it.  Typically, we come here just to drink. When I do need to order food, I usually go with pizza. I like the Tyber Old School. Buffalo sauce, grilled chicken, ranch = a trio that I will always enjoy. They do brunch on Sundays with a bloody mary bar.   I've left my car here several times overnight and it has been fine when I come pick it up the next day. Take that for what it's worth. If you drink, don't drive. Check points are no stranger to South Blvd, especially near 277 and uptown."}
{"text":"I had never been to Tyber Creek before, despite the number of times I have passed it driving through South End.  I was very impressed on my first visit and well certainly be back.  I love the atmosphere of a pub (opposed to a bar).  The dark wood everywhere and the focus on good beer and good friends (instead of trying to be a restaurant/dance hall/bar).  Upstairs is more seating and another full bar with drafts, bottles, and spirits. They do food as well, but did not sample any on my first visit.  It seems like they take a stab at being Irish, with Guinness and a few other Irish staples on draft, but only a few selections on the menu.  As others have mentioned, the music can be a little on the loud side.  But, at least they play DECENT music, something that fits with the atmosphere and the menu.  Fun hangout place that I'll certainly return to."}
{"text":"Staff is rude and doesn't really pay attention to you. The place fills up with frat boys when the clock hits 9. Guaranteed 4 glasses break a night. If you wanna get drunk, blow money on drunk girls and act cooler than you are. Swing by for a good time. Food could use major improvement."}
{"text":"This place is so amaZing especially if you have Sydnee as your server. She is the best"}
{"text":"Love this spot!  I don't normally spend a whole ton of time in the South End (although I'd love to start... in fact, I think I will start now! ready, go!), so when a CMYE popped up for this location, I decided to give it a try.  Our get together was upstairs, and we had a dedicated bartender there, along with waitresses, so we were never out of drinks, which was awesome.  I'd love to come back here and try the food, it looked pretty good (and the samples of hummus, garlic dip, and tapenade were delish!).  I like the atmosphere here, it's quiet enough upstairs that you could hold a conversation, and there is ample space to sit or stand around.  Plenty of TVs too!  One thing, though... maybe get some new barstools?  It was not fun for this short person to hoist herself up onto a barstool by the bottom rung of the stool, only to have it break off and send me reeling and spilling my drink everywhere.  It was a good conversation starter in a sea of strangers, but, I mean, I spilled my drink.  Other than the drink-spilling, though,  good times!! Need to come back and play some cornhole outside!!"}
{"text":"Pretty awesome place to grab some beers and just hang out.  The patio was a great place to just chill with some friends.  Parking is enormous.  Bartenders friendly.  Prices reasonable.  Indoors has a nice ambiance to it and looks like a place that could be a staple if I lived nearby.  Special shout-out to Tyber for sponsoring our kickball team--Drinkers with Kicking Problems!  Okay, you get your fifth star...bribery works.  dmo out"}
{"text":"I'm not a nightclub girl, but I am a bar fly. I love how dark this place is inside. Something about dim lighting just makes the room so much more comfortable, not to mention everyone looks prettier! :p  Jamie our bartender was super sweet, pretty, & was always there right when we needed her.   I can't comment on the food, but I've nothing but amazing things."}
{"text":"LOCAL OWNED & LOCAL RUN.  Super Nice Staff.  Fun place for a pint.  I highly endorse TC.  Irish pub.  Corn Hole Outside.  Outside seating.    Parking can be a bit rough.  DO NOT DRINK AND DRIVE.  This is a high arrest area for Charlotte area.  Get a cab."}
{"text":"I have spent some Sundays here, both on the patio and inside.  I really enjoy a nice game day at the location.  There are TVs outside and in.  The patio is my favorite.  There isn't tons of room, but it's always comfortable.  People there are friendly and you can always strike up a conversation with just about anyone.  The inside is dark, but cozy.  There is space upstairs as well.    The service is always good.  I have mostly got drinks, but had a bite of an app or two at one point.  Everything was always satisfactory.  I will update when I venture back and try some different menu items."}
{"text":"Yeah, not really my thing. And by that, I mean:  I like my beer cold. I like my beer bubbly.   Service was great, crowd was mixed (tad fratty. but I expected worse), patio is awesome and comfy (but seriously smokey, which my lung-healthy cohort kept pointing out). They pour ye olde Guinness properly, and that's what we came for. But would I come back? Not unless they figure out how to properly chill and store their libations. A warm, flat beer, even on $3 pint night, ain't gonna cut it."}
{"text":"Favorite late night chill spot for a couple drinks and some dancing upstairs! Perfect if you're not an Epicentre type couple but still wanna throw that a$$ every now and then. On the flip side, delicious food and great outdoor area to hang"}
{"text":"Went here with a group of friends and was pleasantly surprised! Great food, and $3 pints of Guinness. The place just had a great atmosphere, friendly staff, and played great music! If you're looking for a fun place to have a pint with friends, definitely check out Tyber!"}
{"text":"Cool little pub in the SouthEnd area with a decent outdoor area. Stopped in a couple weeks ago for some brews and food. Had the pimento cheeseburger with fries. It had a good grilled flavor but overall it was just another burger, nothing too special. The fries were tasty. I really liked the $3 draft special, Sweetwater 420! You can't beat that price!! The service is friendly. Overall, nice place to hang with some friends, drink a few cold ones and play some cornhole."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and it's usually for a big event.  I but I finally went on a quiet Friday night for drinks and dinner.  I have to say the food was good and the service was pretty good too. Great Irish food and drinks!"}
{"text":"No matter what else is on the menu, if I see a Reuben at a restaurant, I'm eating it.  That being said, I have been disappointed more than my fair share of times.....Tyber however has the single best Reuben I he ever eaten in my life.  Atmosphere is nice and staff is friendly. I love it."}
{"text":"Good times. Great atmosphere. Authentic beer.  I have never been to an Irish Pub I didn't like. Maybe it's the accent of the man behind the bar, or my love of Irish culture, but I have tagged Tyber Creek as my go-to meet up for game day or killin' daylight with a group. Their is plenty of space to bring wthe hole gang, too."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to grab a beer, a cocktail or just some really good pub food. They always have a wide variety of cool events going on.  This has to be the best place for people of all types to just come and hang out. Play cornhole, darts, Jenga, and ping pong. Or maybe just come here for a cute date spot under the patio lights. Doesn't matter. Tyber is even the best spot in Southend for you to come just dance your ass off on Friday and Saturday nights.   There is a reason it's been around for nearly 20 years.   The kitchen is open till midnight every night. They are always open until 2 am, no matter the day or weather."}
{"text":"Pre-renovation I was a huge fan on Tyber, and yes, due to it's proximity to my abode, it still gets more than one star, but taking out the games upstairs and replacing them with booths... not okay.   The food has always been decent (especially for midnight fare), the bartenders have always been great, but walking upstairs was a disaster. I never noticed a seating problem before, but apparently the owners did... oddly enough, the high tables were still busy as usual, but all of the booths sat empty. Only once the upstairs bathroom line grew too long did people start to occupy the nearest cushion. Also, instead of people being able to gravitate to a high top away from the stairwell like they used to, they were stuck standing right near the stairs (or the bathroom) and walking from one side of the upstairs to the other was more hassle than needed be.   Tyber has definitely dropped on my list of near-home stop ins, but on an off night where I think it'll be slow enough I don't have to head upstairs for a seat, I'll probably be back."}
{"text":"After moving into the neighborhood, Tyber Creek has become my go to spot for meeting friends and grabbing drinks.  Although the bar can get crowded on weekends, the bartenders are on point and the drinks are good and you get what you pay for. They have a large variety of beer, as well as full bar including wine.   I have yet to eat at Tyber, but have heard great things as well as seen some great meals around me. I will definitely give the food a shot soon. Overall, Tyber is a great hangout in Southend, and don't forget to go upstairs, on the weekends you can enjoy some good music and dancing!"}
{"text":"I like this tucked away pub. Plus it's close to work & home. Plus they typcially have decent beer/drink special. And more recently (ex. earlier this week), I found out they have Bingo on Mondays!   Let me clarify my 4-star rating. I enjoy a good pub/watering hole. I think a lot of places in Charlotte get too packed (seriously who wants to wait an eternity to get a lousy overpriced beer?). Tyber Creek Pub is what it is: low-key spot that gets forgotten at times, and I'm glad because I can find a table and enjoy some $3 pint special.   However I wish their food is more solid. Most recently I ordered the beef skewer and I don't know if it's my fault for having it medium rare. I swear it tasted a little bad. And the soup of the day was incredibly salty, to the point of inedible.   Thus, this is not a 4-star food review. But this is a solid 4-star let's get your drink  on review. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Chill pub atmosphere. Lively crowd. Baked cod with the carrot and parsnip mash was unexpectedly lovely. Most times when you ordered the baked as opposed to fried fish the baked fish is lackluster. Not the case here. And the lamb sliders were pretty bomb as well. Kudos!"}
{"text":"Spent the better part of the afternoon with a large group of friends. We sat on the patio, drank, ate, and played corn hole and darts. We all had a really good time. I was pleased that the prices of the drinks weren't too bad. Had the goat cheese chicken wrap, it was really good. The French fries were the best part dipped in malt vinegar. Waitress was sweet and helpful. Inside was way too dark for how bright it was outside, but that's my personal preference.   I liked this place best of the many bars and pubs we went to during our trip to Charlotte. The patio was cute and a great place to hang out with some beers."}
{"text":"Not sure what everyone raves about, service was terrible, and the crowd was thin.  I didn't eat, so I can't tell you about the food, I was going to eat, but based on how long it took to get a drink I went to Mac's to eat and you should too."}
{"text":"This is what a neighborhood bar should be, providing a comfortable atmosphere in the bar downstairs, a place to eat quietly upstairs, and an unrivaled patio to pass the many beautiful nights we get here in the Queen City.  The remodel Tyber went through about a year and a half ago did change the atmosphere a bit.  They went from a true bar, dark as midnight even at noon inside, a bit more light was brought in and some more space made downstairs.  I admit, I do miss the days of the $2 Guinness, but this is still once of my favorite places to grab a pint and a bite."}
{"text":"We finally made it to Tyber Creek after 1.5 yrs, despite it being in our backyard.  Maybe I was deterred by the cornhole games or the deafening live bad music I could here from 2 miles away...  Anyway, the indoor atmosphere is pretty cool (very dark, though, when not sitting at the bar) and the service was nice.   I would probably come back here just for the Spinach & Artichoke dip.  It was phenomenal and as good as any I have ever had.  The burgers are also great as well (I can't say the same about the soggy/greasy fries, though), and definitely very flavorful....I didn't even need ketchup.  \"Don't drink the water\" - DMB...should be posted on the walls, though.  Pretty sure they use a hose out back for the ice water, so stick with soda or booze."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch on a Saturday at 11:30 with 4 friends.  The menu is nothing spectacular nor particularly Irish.  I had the shepherd's pie and it was nice but nothing to write home about.  No rave responses from my fellow diners either.  A friend has a wheat allergy and they made a wrap without the wrapper for her with no problem.  The main problem was that it took over an hour to get our food, and the place was mostly empty when we arrived.  I shudder to think how slow the kitchen is when they're busy.  The interior is very dark, even at noon on a sunny day, so if you hate the sun, this is the place for you, but if you like to see your companions....  Overall, next time I'm taking my business elsewhere, (like the place across the street which I haven't tried yet.)"}
{"text":"I've never eaten here but I do love their patio and staff. They painted the inside so it's not as dark and gloomy as it once was."}
{"text":"Don't go here if you want to have a quiet conversation on a weekend night.  As ususal with a quick review of my fellow Yelpers, I wonder if we were at the same place. How certain is the truthy quote, ' it's all in the eye of the beholder'.  I was interested in this place because I heard they were serving $3 Imperial Pints of Guinness, which they are. It's also the site of place I used to frequent back in the late 70's called the Olde Quarter. Bill Hannah played regular gigs there as well as a host of other local & regional bands...Dixie Dreggs and Spectrum. There was a fire in 82 or 83, the place closed down and I know it's been several bar/restaurants since and has been in it's current incarnation for about 10 years.  Back to the Guinness topic. It's a nice clean and fresh pour and certainly a good value at $3 for an imperial pint which at 20 oz is four ounces more than the standard US pint.  The music....a nice mix of U2, Kinks, Steely Dan, Foo Fighters, Radiators...you get the idea...but loud...loud...loud. Way too loud to have a 'quiet conversation' as another Yelper suggested.  Went on a Sat evening, the downstairs was open, the upstairs was closed. It does have a Pub feel to it, dark and lots of wood, signs advertising specials and various bands.  There's a host stand but no one to greet us at 730p on a Sat evening. There's a good sized bar and many raied round table tops on the floor of the bar...some with stools & some with wood backed chairs. We took a seat and sat for about five minutes with no server in sight. I then went to the bar and orderd some beers and asked for food service.  Within 5 minutes we had a server who was cordial and nice. I asked about the music and she smiled and said \" do you like it\", to which I responded \"yes, but isn't it a little loud\"...she smiled even bigger and replied...\"are you kidding, it's quiet compared to what it's usually like\".  If you don't mind asking your companion to repeat themselves after every sentence or are good at giving and reading sign language then you shouldn't have a problem. Otherwise I would suggest going when it's warmer when you can sit outside. There were a couple of 42 inch plasmas tuned to ESPN...fortunately with the sound turned down  We both had burgers which were better than average. They have a good selection of  pub grub fare. The couple beside has the wings which they both raved about. They also suggested the Rabbit Food appetizer which we orded and I'll admit was fresh & tasty, carrots, cucumbers and celery sticks along w/Ranch dressing...a little pricey IMO at $6.50 but...it was fresh.  Upstairs is a bar with a 52 inch plasma, pool tables & some dart boards. I'm guessing on a busy nite that's where most people go if they don't care for the downstairs.   I would guess that if the place has managed to stay in business for 10 years, it's because of the affordable draft beer selection & the location. It's proximity to Dillworth & South End.  Go for the beer and take someone you don't care to  to have a quiet conversation with."}
{"text":"Came here for some fun on a Saturday night with a large group. Plenty to do for everyone. If you like to dance, there's a DJ. If you like to chill and play some game, there's a giant outdoor patio with giant Jenga. Only downfall is the dance floor on the third floor is tiny- not much room for many people. Good thing it wasn't too crowded."}
{"text":"$2 Tequila Silver.... Yep, I said it! But if you need me to continue... I will gladly. The ambiance was welcoming and the day was nice so I was able to enjoy the outside seating area.   The waitress was nice and I received my food in a timely fashion. AND it was really good! I would definitely come back and just chill out and have some drinks and an appetizer.. No brainier!"}
{"text":"This is the only bar I've found in Charlotte that knows how to pour a Guinness and for that alone it earns 5 stars.  Trust me, it's not as easy as it sounds and SO many places screw it up.  There's a process, it has to settle, you need a rich creamy head on top.  Most bartenders in CLT pour the suckers in 30 seconds or less and the difference in taste is huge.  The bar is comfortable and the patrons are an interesting mix.  If you want a proper Guinness then this is the place."}
