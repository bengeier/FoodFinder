{"text":"I went to Open on Center Church Rd last evening and was looking forward to trying it. I love German and Italian food and am aquaintances of the owners Sal and Susie. I will say that it was a unique dining experience and not in a good way. Let me begin by saying that the food was delicious and the portions big, but there was so much lacking in the way of ambiance and décor and service professionalism that made the dinner a huge distraction. 

First the food. We began with the stuffed peppers and they were delicious. Nicely done and great taste and so much that we immediately decided to take half of it home. I was next given a salad which was fresh and large and crisp. Our main courses came, I had ordered the Veal Royale Schnitzel and it was delicious thought it could have used a little more gravy considering the size of the piece of veal that I received. (again, half of it I took home) and potato pancakes which were okay. Interestingly they served my potato pancakes halfway through my meal as they had run out which I found strange from a german restaurant. My companion had the German meatloaf and mashed potatoes which were very good and which she liked a lot. The meal on the whole was good. 

The ambiance.....there is none. It looks like it was put together from leftover construction materials and poorly at that. In fact one light fixture was installed upside down which was rather funny for my companion and I. A mixed and matched flooring, beige walls without a single decoration. Loud and bland. You would not bring someone here that you were trying to impress. 

The service staff.....If there is a less professional group of servers I have not run into them. They inserted themselves into conversations, they yelled across the room at each other, one insisted on referring to us as \"lovelies\" everytime that she came to our table and one walked across the dining room on her cell phone having a personal high volume conversation while doing so. If this were my restaurant I would fire them all and start over....or at the least train them.

Lastly, I love a good glass of wine and asked to see the wine list. There is none. Apparently they have mystery bottles of cabernet, merlot, pinot noir, chardonnay and white zinfandel that you merely order by varietal.

Again, I will come back sometime for the food but never for a \"wonderful evening out\". If it wasn't so sad it would be funny."}
{"text":"Actually posted by her husband. We went in September this year. The place was empty except for one other table. The young gentleman seated our party of five at a table with an end seat. The person seated at the end was protruding into the aisle. I asked to be moved to another table, first the gentleman, kid, said he would have to find one. I told him to turn around, you have at least 10 empties behind you. After waiting 15 minutes a waitress found us a table. We proceeded to order. In s nutshell, I did not enjoy my fish sandwich, dry and a little too oily. Don't want to speak for the others but the food was not what they expected. Poor service, treated without any concern of our request, was too much to bear. Will I ever go back??? Only if I am out voted on Friday night family dinner night."}
{"text":"Authentic German Food. Great wait staff. Generous portions. Excellent addition to the multitude of restaurants along route 19."}
{"text":"This was an awesome, quaint restaurant! German food was fantastic with very reasonable prices. Service was top notch as well! Just off Rt.19. Will definitely be back! Highly recommend. Kid friendly but also nice area for the bar section."}
{"text":"Wow. I'm pretty sure this is the same place (albeit renovated) as the old Candle Keller restaurant that I went to with my German class like 30 years ago. We went for the German food and it did not disappoint. Their number one seller has good reason for its status: the corned beef Reuben on potato pancakes instead of marbled rye is flat out awesome. The corned beef alone is a quality that surpasses every other corned beef I've tried, and that includes the time I spent a summer sampling corned beef sandwiches throughout Hoboken, NJ. I would absolutely return for that sandwich alone... especially since that wasn't even my own entree! I had the Esterhazy schnitzel. It came with a soup that was okay. The meal itself was lovely but I must admit, my side of German potato salad was a most pleasant surprise. First, because I did not know what German potato salad was, so I expected something totally different. Second, because it was awesome and complemented the potato pancakes and schnitzel.
Last, I never get dessert. But I had to get a slice of the German chocolate cake. I got it to go and our waitress (she was great btw) gave me a little thing of chocolate sauce and raspberry sauce-ok I know that's not traditional, but it looks fantastic in the pictures-anyway she gave me the sauces in little to-go containers with instructions to heat up the cake before enjoying it, which I'm totally going to do in like an hour.
It was a great experience here (aside from scraping my trailer hitch on the steep entrance to the parking lot) and I'll definitely return. Oh and the music! We walked in to Wham! and got to enjoy an all 80s dinner vibe lol. I loved it"}
{"text":"We have been wanting to try this place for a few weeks now, and I'm so glad we came.  The service was excellent from the time we were seated until the time we left.  The head chef came out and checked on us as we enjoyed our dinners.  They have a delicious variety of German and Italian entrees as well as sandwiches. The prices are very reasonable for the quality of the meals.  I highly recommend this place for a casual night out. We ordered the 2lb burger to go, which was huge!!!"}
{"text":"The service was terrible. There were only 3 tables with customers, and all 3 tables were audibly complaining. Waitress had time for a cigarette break though- could smell it a mile away, causing me to feel a little nautious. German food wasn't very authentic, pork was very tough, stuffing too mushy. Waited too long for food, an eternity to pay."}
{"text":"The 4 stars is for the potato pancake Rueben, my husband says is the best Rueben he has ever tasted. However I was there this week and it was not as great as usual . Maybe just a off night but noticed the corned beef was dry . Please don't change anything like previous times I've been there because it can't be beat ! 
 Also a gluten free option for food would be nice so I can take my wife there ."}
{"text":"We've heard a lot about this place but couldn't find it because they are not on a main road. The mix of offerings (German, Italian and Deli) is unusual to say the least. Their corned beef is among the best around. 

We were there for a late dinner and the service was excellent.  My wife found most of her German sampler plate to be wonderful.  

About a week ago we attempted to go there for lunch. We discovered that they had decided to not open for lunch, at least temporarily.  We were disappointed.  

If you're looking for the place it's on a side road across from the Goodwill store on Route 19. The food is worth a try. I will mention that the place is basically a bar, but the menu is much better than bar food. Oh, they were also closed on Mondays."}
{"text":"We thoroughly enjoyed our Meals last night. I had a mixture of pork brotwurst and another sausage. It was very good
 My husband had a corned beef sandwich and loved it. You could not ask for a better server
 We can\"t wait to go back!"}
{"text":"We recently decided to try the new \"OPEN\" in McMurray, since we have been anxiously waiting for it to \"open\". My husband and inlaws went in for Dinner around 7pm and there was plenty of seating available. It is a wait to be seated restaurant, however there is no sign telling you that, so after standing around for a few minutes, I finally approached the bartender so then seated us. The front room, while newly redone, left much to be desired in décor. It frankly looked like a pizza joint, no real décor to speak of, very bland, yet it was \"open\" and bright. But there was a lingering smell of deep fryer oil. This holds true for the front entry, I would suggest some much needed flower, a bench outside, some simple items to make it a bit more friendly. 
The layout of some of the tables is awkward, and they sat us in a booth in the center of an isle. the booth was very small and we were constantly kicking each other under the table. However it was clean. Because the front room has the vaulted ceilings, it is very very loud and there were only a handful of people in there. Their voices magnified and echoed and we actually had a hard time hearing each other in the other room, due to the noise level. 
Our waitress was very nice and relatively knowledgeable on the menu, which is extensive. The beer and wine list is not available and simply a hand written note of \"some\" of the beer selections available, but that said they are working on getting a nicer list printed. Our drinks came timely. 
I ordered the weiner Schnitzel with pork instead of veal, it comes with two sides and a salad or soup. I had the sauerkraut and potato pancakes as my sides and a salad. The potato pancakes are big, but very bland and have a strange taste that we finally determined was oil. Perhaps \"old\" oil? While they were ok they definitely needed some seasoning, maybe onions, or anything other than just potatoes. The sauerkraut was fantastic, very good with bits of ham in it. The pork was two strips heavily breaded and fried. It was ok, nothing great, but the taste was ok. I did however also receive veal on my plate, which I had not asked for or wanted, and it did not taste good at all, I took one bite and that was it. 
My mother in law had the potato pancake Rueben. it was huge, and not easy to eat, but it looked delicious. She said the same comment regarding the pancakes about the oil taste and said the cornbeef was extremely dry. But over all the dish was ok. 
My husband had the stuffed pepper soup that he said was good, and the  veal parm, and once again, it was \"ok\",  but nothing special. The pasta he ordered came in a small bowl and when he went to eat it, it was a sticky ball that he couldn't even separate without making a mess. 
My father in law had bratwurst and potato pancakes,, same response on the pancakes and the sausage looked very naked on the plate. It looked as though it was boiled there were no garnishes and it could have stood to be grilled for a minute to at least make it look appetizing. Again, it was \"ok. 
In the end, we wont rush to go back. 
As a side note, they really should do something about the awkward handicap space by the front door. I cant imagine it would meet code regulations as you have to drive up a steep hill that then levels out (by steep I mean it looked to be about 30-40 degree angle). If you are in a wheel chair or on crutches, etc,, and get out your passenger door, the only way to get to the entrance is to walk behind your vehicle, which would place you walking on the very steep hill? Super dangerous, plus there is a standard parking space next to the handicap one, that you cant even get to if there was a vehicle parked in the handicap. Very poor layout."}
{"text":"Great food, service and atmosphere.  The new location has a large bar and plenty of seating."}
{"text":"This place is recently remodeled, and I hope they're not done.  It's very roomy, but needs more finishing touches.  Big bar area with a lot of interesting beers on tap.  I hate when there's a huge space in a restaurant and they seat all four occupied tables right next to each other.  They did that.

The waitress was a young gal, friendly enough, but bless her heart, she was pretty incompetent.  Brought the wrong side dishes, couldn't identify the kind of wurst I asked about.  She seemed like nobody had ever trained her to wait tables.

Really good food.  I had the Bremen platter to try a little of everything.  My favorites were the bratwurst, pork loin, and the beets.  Try the german chocolate cake!  A nice draft of Peroni.  The food and friendliness make up for problems in service and atmosphere.  I will be back, but I'm hoping they step up their \"front of the house\" game."}
{"text":"I didn't know there was an original OPEN restaurant much less this second location. One of my friends had eaten there and suggested we meet there. Another friend joined us a little later. We started off by ordering 2 appetizers-Beans &!Greens and Sauerkraut Fritters. The Beans & Greens were $8.95 and definitely not worth it. Their version of greens is lettuce instead of collard greens or spinach. There wasn't a lot of flavor. The fritters were incredible. You get four for $4.95. They packed a lot of flavor and come with a tasty dipping sauce. I could eat them as a meal. 
I ordered the Rueben that had potato pancakes instead of Rye bread. It was DELISH!!!!!!!!  It was huge and packed with meaty cheesy goodness. It pretty much a heart attack on a plate. LOL with all of our food on the table it looked like a mini buffet. The potato pancakes were seriously the size of pancakes. They come with sour cream and applesauce. We asked if they had any whole grain mustard and they brought us out a sauce that was off the hook good. 
We also had sides of German potato salad, red cabbage salad, and Coke slaw. The rabbit was good but very little meat with a lot of crispy coating. I would recommend NOT getting the sauce that comes with it. It is a red wine and bacon sauce that looked like retried beans and had a weed taste. The Weiner Schnitzel was cooked perfectly but it wasn't outstanding. 
For dessert I ordered the German Chocolate cake. That is my favorite cake on the world. It came out on a plate and it was the size of a cupcake. The cake was moist and delicious. The icing was \"just like mom used to make\". Seriously.   It had dollops of whipped cream on each side. It was drizzled with chocolate sauce and raspberry sauce. I would ask the to leave the raspberry sauce off. It didn't belong. 
It was good food and I will take my family to try more dishes."}
{"text":"Last night we made the decision to eat at Open, the new place off Washington Road in McMurray.  During the past year or so many friends and family members told us about their experience and are urging us to go to this fantastic German/Italian dining experience.  We could not have been more disappointed with our meals.  The wait staff is overly friendly to the point that it is awkward and forced and comes off as not genuine.  The host met us immediately as we entered the restaurant and sat us down.  The building has been the host of many restaurants over the last ten years which is noticeable by the various floor finishes which go from concrete to tile and carpeting.  There are no decorations, and the color scheme is rather dull.  I for one would never use dark brown paint on anything.  The first waitress came over introducing herself and taking our drink order.  She was friendly but proceeded to tell us she was going to give us \"professional service,\" whatever that means.  Delivering our drinks was another waitress who is ready to take our order, but unfortunately, my family is still processing the overly extensive menu and is asking for more time.  Unfortunately, the time between the first time she is asking for our order and the next time totaled ten minutes, far too long.  I ordered the stuffed hot peppers, chicken marsala, and wedding soup instead of the salad.  My wife ordered the eggplant parmesan and the wedding soup as well.  The first item to arrive at the table is the wedding soup.  I can always judge an Italian food restaurant by their wedding soup.  My wife immediately says to me upon tasting her soup that something is not right with it.  And then she hits the nail on the head, beef broth instead of chicken.  They serve the soup with crackers and no cheese as well.  Next up is the hot peppers; that arrive two on a plate.  And much to my surprise, they are not banana peppers.  The sausage was okay, nothing special and the sauce left a lot to be desired.  Next up on the hit parade is my order of chicken marsala and the side dish of spaghetti.  The chicken breasts are tender, but the marsala sauce and mushrooms look like something out of the freezer isle, thick brown sauce with a skin over it like it were sitting around for a while.  Overdone, sticking together as one lump of an intertwined mess, and a sauce that tastes like it is straight from a jar the side of pasta is a mess as well.  This review is getting long so I will not go into the details of my wife or son's dishes which are equally as bad as mine.  Transitioning from a small few table restaurant in the back of a post office to a full service larger restaurant with a full bar may be the cause for the some of the glaring mistakes.  Unless they make significant changes, there are way too many places who do it so much better; they will be out of business soon."}
{"text":"Went to the OPEN restaurant in McMurray and had a  wonderful dinner.  My husband and I do not care about \"lack of decor\" \" or \"the lay out of the parking lot\" as others have mentioned in their reviews.  What we care about is good food; and that is what we received.  We went on a Sunday evening, were seated immediately and were served by a delightful waitress. My Ruben sandwich was delicious as was the coleslaw . My husband had the Wiener schnitzel , potato pancakes and coleslaw and ate every bite. We will definitely be visiting again."}
{"text":"Brand new place, second place for Open, the other is in Venetia.  Remodeled restaurant and bar with some nice wood and very light during the day.  
This location has a bar.  About 12 taps and a cooler full of beer. 
Staff was super friendly.  Met the owner, Salvador who was working with the staff and greeting most of the tables. 
Had the Boleslaw sandwich which is kielbasa, carmelized onion, slaw and a pierogi. Nice sandwich, very tasty.  If you enjoy german food this looks to be a good stop."}
