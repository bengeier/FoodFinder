{"text":"I used to come here when I was younger and I loved it! And I still love it! The service was fast and friendly. The chips and salsa were great, and the margaritas were delicious!! The food was just as I remembered, yummy!! And the best part was being able to go with my family! I will definitely come here again!"}
{"text":"Food is fairly low quality and far from authentic. Low grade meat (steak), old peppers & onions, bland salsa & chips, overly salted refried beans. Ordering for four people and having the food being delivered to the table within five minutes, i think  was a good indication of food quality. Awesome service! although i asked for a pint of beer and was instead handed a 12oz bottle and told that they don't have beer on tap, despite the draft beer section of the drinks menu clearly stating what draft beers were on tap... at a different location. Friendly people with really bad food. Comparable to taco bell."}
{"text":"This is a really quaint place and the service was exceptionally fast. We were seated instantly and the food came out very quick too.
They give free chips & salsa. The salsa is a little watery but very tastey, and the chips come out nice and warm. They have quite the selection when it comes to their menu. Its really hard to find a mexican food place that serves albondigas. Needless to say, that's what I ordered with a sour cream green chicken enchilada and rice + beans. They a very generous with their cheese. Overall, it was delicious and I pretty much ate until I nearly popped.
Our server's name was Tryon and he was a pretty friendly fellow. Not overly in your face, but tentive and smiley. My boyfriend's order came out wrong (the reason for the four stars), but we didn't complain because it was still awesome. I definitely enjoyed my experience."}
{"text":"So I love this place. Food was amazing ! Service is amazing ! Linda was our server she is above and beyond amazing !"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying this is definitely not my first choice for Mexican food but when you have family members come to town and they request to go to Macayo's you oblige. I must say, their green corn tamales are delicious and the only reason to ever eat here. That is literally the only positive I can say about this visit. We have been here numerous times and it generally has always been with a large group but we've never had such bad service. 
     We had a party of 15 for dinner and our server's name was Andrew. He was extremely rude and a terrible server. Everyone was drinking either water or Dr. Pepper with the exception of one iced tea yet everyone's drinks were always empty. After asking twice for refills they came around with the pitchers of soda and water and filled everyone's drinks up except for the iced tea. After an additional 10 minutes of waiting, the guest nicely asked again for a refill of her tea and Andrew preceded to tell her that he will get her more tea and he only has two hands. I don't know if he is always this terrible at his job or if it was because he knew he was going to be adding gratuity to the check so his service wouldn't have mattered. I did complain to the manager as we were walking out which I have never done because it was that bad.
     I worked and managed restaurants for many years and the way our party was treated was unacceptable. Honestly, I don't think that I will ever come back to this establishment. Hopefully the management looks into this situation. Sorry Andrew, maybe you should be transferred to the back of house so you don't have direct contact with any customers...."}
{"text":"My fella and I have frequented Macayo many times since moving to Vegas a few years ago and have enjoyed every single visit. The free chips are yummy, the service is friendly and efficient and the wet California burrito I get every time is delicious and so huge, it also serves as lunch the following day."}
{"text":"I grew up eating at Macayo's.  Birthdays, holiday's, any big event, my family went here.  They are always laid back and let you do what you want.  If your a loud group(which my family is) they will put you more away from people.  At 22 years old they let me color my picture and then we fold them up into paper planes and toss them around the room!

It is great.  Now that I'm old enough to drink, their drinks are amazingly strong!  Gotta lot a little extra Tequila for your Margarita!  Food is always the best and their fresh chips and salsa keep me coming back!  The staff can be a little......slow, but everything else makes up for that.

Plus......they are located in the best shopping complex, so I work off all the food I ate by shopping."}
{"text":"So we were headed downtown to the Beef Jerky store, and we stopped in at Macayo's for dinner ... is 3:30 pm considered dinner?
Mr. Abbott ordered the carnitas plate(it comes with pico, guac and sour cream, rice and beans and tortillas) because apparently it is Macayo's anniversary and they have specials running through the month of August.
Happy 50th Maycayo's :)
I ordered the Baja Chimichanga which came with rice OR beans I chose rice and the chef gave me both by mistake *BONUS*  I wonder if I could add stars based on that fact :).
OH and we ordered a TCT for an appetizer  (toasted cheese tortilla)
Let us begin with the chips and salsa ... 
Warm chips and two sauces  one chunky one smooth. 
I prefer the smooth, which is good because Mr. Abbott prefers the chunky (I can't even say the word chunky) kidding. 
We barely ate half the chips and the bus-girl came and had another pile of warm chips. 
My water with lemon? My glass never made it past a quarter empty . They also brought a little bowl of lemons. *nice*
Then the TCT came and it was this amazing flour tortilla with wondefully  melt-y cheese ... so delicious when dipped into the smooth sauce . 
Then the baja chimi.... A chimichanga with chicken and ranchero sauce on top with a cream cheese-y sour cream sauce) what tasty goodness that was such a big portion that i only ate half and didn't eat any of my rice or BONUS beans.  (Don't worry they made it into a take home package)
Mr. Abbott's carnitas were over filling too and apparently quite good because he didn't even try to steal any of mine.
Wow three bonuses already I should probably change it to five stars, 
but I wasn't crazy about our waitress she had the personality of Sean Connery's shoe. 
Will I be back ... ohhhhh yeah!"}
{"text":"love coming here for the great food and excellence service. the staff always remembers you and makes you feel like family. been coming here for years."}
{"text":"My old friends always seemed to love going here. I never went with them though.
Finally tried it, it's just typical Mexican to me. 
The service is always friendly and attentive but LOL@how the waiters are dressed. I feel sorry for them. Also, the decor of the place is really odd. It has a painted sky on the ceiling as if it's trying to mock the Venetian or something. 
It's a shame I wasn't impressed, it's supposedly a Vegas classic that even my aunt used to eat at back when she first moved here in the 80's, could it be because it has so many locations now?
I still would go back just to try that Toasted Cheese Tortilla everyone raves about though."}
{"text":"Love the Chimichangas!!!!! Great Guacamole!  Just need a bit more alchohol in the Margarita's:-)  That the only reason for the 4 star:-)"}
{"text":"The Food has always been very good and the servers are very nice. Food is always piping hot when served. They keep your drinks topped. My family has been a customer of Macayo's for 30 years and just love it."}
{"text":"I love Macayo's! I'm born and raised in Vegas so I grew up going here. Let's be real this place is super gringo mexican food but if you're ok with that then you'll love it!  TCT is a must for an app. Then I like either the fajitas or the chimi. Don't forget the shirley temple!"}
{"text":"Sorry not Mexican food. Walked in and had chips & salsa then ordered food after tasting bland chips I canceled my order and offered to pay for chips ,server said there was no charge your welcomed to try it."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant. Never had bad service. Chips and Spicey or Milder Salsa always comin, Ground Beef, Cheese Enchiladas, Beans & Rice, Shredded Beef Tamales with Guacamole and Sour Cream. Always Good. Always a Hot Plate. Virgin Daiquiris and Virgin Pina Coladas excellent."}
{"text":"Mmm great for lunch - the Macayo's favorite lunch is super yummy!"}
{"text":"I went there for lunch time.  They have good lunch menu and I think it's nice deal.  I had a Street Tacos and my friend have a Grilled Tacos. Both under $10."}
{"text":"One if the Vegas local favorites. I still have people being me salsa from here to California. I love their tct and burritos."}
{"text":"Oh Macayo what happen to you? I've eaten there since I was a child in 1979. My Wife and I went there tonight and could not get service. After 20 minutes waiting and no server we stood up and left. I guess we did what other tables were thinking. Four other tables followed us out."}
{"text":"Pretty good stuff. I'm fairly particular about Mexican food, having been surrounded by the most amazing Tex-Mex for the first twenty years of my life, so I can't say it's anything spectacular.

From the vegetarian point of view, it's pretty disappointing. There are a few veggie dishes, but my date wanted a veggie chimichanga, which wasn't available. We ordered the chili con queso, cheese enchilada, spinach enchilada and veggie fajitas.

The salsa and con queso were okay, the cheese enchilada was pretty good, but the spinach enchilada was way too rich. I could barely eat one bite! The veggie fajitas were very good, though, and made the experience worthwhile. The rice and refried beans were both on the dry side, which I didn't care for.

Still hunting for a great Mexican food place."}
{"text":"Ooey gooey, Antonio.

Best green, sour cream enchilada and chili rellano I ever had.  The taste was excellent, but it was the textures I really liked.  Tons of stringy cheese, like great pizza; al dente burrito shells, like lasagna; and slightly crisp chilies,  like red onions on a pizza.  Antonio the Mexican sends his best."}
{"text":"Carb/cholesterol savor...chicken fajitas with no tortillas...Yummy!!!"}
{"text":"Worst service I've ever had. We sat down and placed our order, waited 15 minutes and still hadn't gotten our drinks, not even water. When the manager Carmen was confronted, she has no remorse just made excuses that there was a party of 35 in the back, while her and 3 other employees were standing around the register. 
However, we did receive a bowl of chips with no salsa!"}
{"text":"Just ate dinner here. It was pretty good. 
Chips and Salsa were good with two choices of salsa.
I ordered the Enchilada sampler. It was good and was extra, extra cheesy. Which is a huge plus because I love shredded cheese!
Service was fast and prompt. They were right there for refills on all of our drinks.
Prices were very reasonable.
Could not drink due to work. But seems like they have a good drink 
menu."}
{"text":"I have been coming to Macayos since I was 6 years old.. I'm 28 now! I use to frequent the West Charelston location during breaks between classes and the family and I live by the Cimmaron location. The shredded beef chimi is always my favorite. Love to start with a TCT and dip it with beans and guacamole or skip the nonsense and just order the Baja Pizza App. Miss the Andes Mints and Flamboyant costumes but the food has always been consistent and delicious for over 10 years. Now only if they'd add chilliquiles to the menu id never have to go to Casa Don Juans again.

Cradle to Grave Customer,
Jon"}
{"text":"Love their nachos! I can't eat it all so I share. Sharing is caring! LoL!"}
{"text":"RIP Macayo! You shall be missed. 

Those of you that are fans, you ought to get there before they close their doors in a few weeks:-(

So many memories, so many special events were celebrated there. 

At least the three other locations are remaining open. Not that I care -- the W. Charleston restaurant is very special and sentimental.

The Sonoran Beach tacos with the creamy cilantro dressing are out of this world. Pretty good TCTs and salsa as well."}
{"text":"Ok.

Let me just start out by saying that this is a great Mexican Food Restaurant.

If you loathe Mexican food.

Best thing about eating lunch here? It was out of me less than two hours later!

Explosively.

Really. I swear.

My bud had a 2 for 1 coupon and asked me to join him to talk biz ,so, being cheap, fat and hungry, I said, \"sure'. I knew where the place was ( who hasn't bought street drugs at some point in their lives? Don't judge me!) and made it there only to enter 1981 Mexico. The \"decor\" is barely that. Some frescoes of someone's idea of Mexico could have used a Silkwood shower and the tables looked like ,well, nothing.

The first bad sign? Stale, tasteless chips and some sort of salsa juice. WTF? I mean this set up was so bad even my friend (who will eat anything.) only finished 1/4 of them.

The menu is very typical White suburbia version of Mexican \"Combinacciones Platos\". I was actually in the mood for that. It's like you know it's not real Mexican food but you love it anyway. 

And then I made a mistake that would cause our waitress, Surlyrella, to decide that she and I were NOT going to be Freunden. 

Not.

\"You know what? I'll have a cheese taco as well as my Enchiladas\", I gamely said to the looming rock of hate. \"CHEESE TACO?', she hissed. 

We stared at each other like two mean Wildebeest about to go all Wild Kingdom on each other. Being Gay, I was not about to back down.

\"It's a TACO WITH CHEESE\", I looked her gaze right back at her now beady steely eyes.

\"Hmph\", she shot back in a way that said, \"screw you and your mother for letting you down the birth canal!\"

So.

The \"food\" came.

As did the next twenty minutes of my choking down some of the blandest globs of cheese, rice and beans that I have endured since Swanson decided to take on the Mexican TV tray market. 

It came, but it didn't went fast enough for me.

Fast forward to me back at work breaking my cardinal rule, \"No number 2 at the office!' 

Explosively.

Oh yeah. That cheese taco? A hard shell with some cheese shoved in with that nasty from the bag shredded lettuce you get on clearance at Food For Less. Despicable.

I hate this place and strongly suggest you eat at , well, anywhere other than here."}
{"text":"Im very picky when it comes to Mexican food. Came here yesterday for the first time because my co-workers suggested it. Never heard of it ever in my life. Walked in and it had a Mexican feel to it, so I was like okay maybe this will be one of those hidden gems.

Sat down and it took them a while to come and ask for our drinks and to deliver us some chips and salsa. The chips and salsa are 'ehhh' they bring you 2 types, 1 is mild and 1 is spicy. The mild salsa is NOT fresh, tastes exactly like the salsa you buy from the store in the glass bottle. The spicy salsa is basically tomato sauce with some spices and wasn't even spicy. Good thing the chips were fresh! 

I ordered the steak fajita lunch meal, which came with sour cream, guacamole, beans and corn tortillas. My co-worker got a the chimichanga lunch meal and my other co-worker got the taco bowl. 

My fajitas were good, and I guess since it is from the lunch menu didn't really come with a lot of meat or veggies. Meat was tender and flavorful and the beans were delish.

I was looking around and I guess they've been there for some time because it was extremely dusty. On the light above our table, the seperators between us were very dusty and it kind of turned me off a little. I understand you've been there for a long time, but it doesn't hurt to do an annual cleaning once and a while.

Overall, food was 'OK', but I don't think I will be coming back. Since it was really dusty and the food was just 'Ok'. Luckily, I wasn't the one who paid for lunch."}
{"text":"I came to this location to eat lunch with my girlfriend 3 days ago. We were both craving some good mexican food and thought we found a good spot. Unfortunately not. 

DIdn't start off bad, we were seated quickly and brought chips, salsa and drinks. Right after this our server, a lady with a southern accent, came to ask if we were ready.. nope needed a few more minutes. She must have come back only 30 seconds later. Talk about annoying. 

So we got our order in and started with chicken tortilla soup. It was okay.
We got our food in a reasonable amount of time. But then realized we had no silverware, so we stole some off of another table. No big.. 

My girlfriend ordered 2 enchiladas and was only able to eat 1/4 of one before she started feeling sick and has felt sick since this meal. No appetite, nauseous, stomach pains and more. Which makes us feel it was food poisoning. 

I ordered a carne asada bowl special. 20 minutes later, two empty glasses and still no check up from our server. We finally decide to just get up and go to the front. The lady at the counter looked puzzled at why we came to pay empty handed and informed her that we hadnt seen our server since we got our food. 

Needless to say we will NEVER be back & will be sure to warn everyone we know."}
{"text":"I'm really surprised to see so much hate on my main mexican place. Eating here is over a decade long tradition for my family! The location is without a doubt terrible and sketchy but since both the West Charleston & Trop locations closed, you gotta do what you gotta do for some delicious eats.  The sopapillas are fantastic and their baja sauce is my absolute favorite!"}
{"text":"It saddens me to only give Macayos 2 stars but other than chunky salsa and customer service, there is just no point in expecting decent Mexican food from here. 
My last 2 experiences have severely disappointed me.  The food comes out pretty fast, so fast that you question when it was cooked. 
On my most recent visit I ordered the enchilada sampler. This comes with a green spicy chicken enchilada, a ranchero enchilada, and a plain cheese classic one. 
I took a bite of each and was pretty much ready to leave. 
There is just no authenticity to this food at all. I use to come here as a kid, but I wouldn't even bring my own kid here these days. It wasn't the worst, but I think all and all this place just needs a makeover. Their days may be numbered on the east side if they don't figure it out soon."}
{"text":"Omg ....eeew wish i would have seen the dead mice review before I ate there today at lunch !!!!...server was great ....food was bland and they gave me what was suppose to be shrimp tacos they should have called it cabbage wrap it had about 6 shrimps cut up in little pieces in each tortilla I paid $11 For cabbage basically....Terrible !!!! Don't come here waste of money the atmosphere is very old and restrooms have trash all over . Only star is for service. Oh and the enchiladas gave my friend CHORRO ...they look good on the outside but that's it ."}
{"text":"Born and raised in Las Vegas.... Been coming here since I was 4.... Albondigas soup and the Baja sauce!!!! I save my cheat days fat days for macayos....."}
{"text":"Great Mexican food in an old fashioned restaurant. Good lunch specials and bottomless chips when you sit down. I've never had anything I didn't enjoy here."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE?

This place was super dam American like really chicken tenders???? Wtf is that 

They have NO SEAFOOD 

My meat was tasteless and uhh 

The pizza the Baja pizza was amazing but other then that this place sucks 

My grandma loves this place but I think it's terrible

Our service sucked he acted like he hated his life smh!!

I love Mexican food but this place was way below average"}
{"text":"The best part of this restaurant is the Manager, Carmen.  We've been coming to this location for over 40+ years.  It definitely is in need of a remodel."}
{"text":"A Vegas tradition. I remember going to this and other locations (Trop and Maryland is closed! So sad!) Don't let the area or the inside of the restaurant drive you away. It's in a seedy part of town, no doubt and the inside of the restaurant is cheesy as all get out but the food is good and you can generally get out of there spending only about $25 for 2 people. 
Chips are served warm, get the guacamole dip if you want to splurge (at $8.79 it's pricey) but it's served in a mini fried tortilla shell that can be eaten if you're hungry enough to finish all the guac. The salsa is so so - nothing to write home about but it works.
I think the most popular thing here is the TCT - which is essentially just a quesadilla. You can add meat, veggies and beans to make it a little more filling but it's massive - served on a huge pizza pan over a lit candle to keep it warm. You gotta try it at least once. Most people get it as an app but if you're hungry enough, try it as your entree. 
My favorite thing on the menu is Pollo con Espinaca which is grilled chicken in a spicy cream cheese and jack cheese mixture with spinach. It's creamy, spicy, warm and so incredibly delicious. I've tried to replicate it at home but just can't get it quite right. It's served with the flour tortillas and the typical sides-beans and rice. For sure try this if you're looking for something a little more adventurous than a chimichanga (which, by the way, are pretty amazing too). 
The restaurant itself is older and not in the greatest shape. It's got lots of seating - both booths and tables and if they're busy enough they even open up the back area which is kind of a cool spot to eat.
The people are friendly - I swear a few of the ladies there have been there since I was a kid. Service is hit and miss - we had to wait a little too long for drink refills and a chip refill. Our server didn't come back to check on us until we were actually done with our meal but it wasn't a big deal cause we really didn't need anything. While the service may not be a worthy of a 5 star restaurant, it's at least friendly. 
If you've lived in Vegas for any substantial amount of time, you've definitely heard of Macayo's. If not and you're looking for a good spot for generally inexpensive good Mexican food, give it a try. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"The food was very delicious but unpleasantly to put them 2 stars because on Monday I went to dinner with my wife and our friends, everything started well since we entered the girl who took us to sit she behaved very friendly, but the guy who brings the salsa and chips before ordering, came started to throw things, I asked \"but you are not really angry?\" He turns to me with a very red face and sweating he answers \"no! Why ?, I said, just asking, at that time I behaved patient, We felt uncomfortable for the incident, was a very bad experience."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good. The servers are pleasant but the cashier BETTY is awful .I dont know if its her old age or if she was having a bad day... Her attitude was very bad when taking a payment or asked to change items on our receipts . I spoke with a manager hopefully that helps get the customer service in this restaurant back up to the nice place it used to be."}
{"text":"Not the best but, for a quick work lunch the mex bowl is awesome. I get it with black bean and no meat with a side of jalapenos! Yummy"}
{"text":"When the craving for Mexican hits, it hits hard and nothing else will satisfy.  So I was not stopping until I had some proper Mexican food!  Some co-workers had suggested Macayo and I was pleased to find out there was a location five minutes from my work... how convenient!! I went in with a friend and we were famished, so of course we ordered close to everything on their menu!  We were greeted with warm chips and salsa, which was amazing!  We started with their appetizer sampler and their dip sampler.  Both were HUGE portions and we immediately regretted how much we ordered! The appetizer sampler was great!  It offered pretty much two of everything, which was perfect for us to split.  Their dips are all amazing. 

After sufficiently stuffing our faces with this, the rest of what we ordered showed up at our table.  Now our server definitely thought we were crazy for how much we ordered, but we hadn't been forewarned about the serving sizes! (Consider yourselves warned!  They're HUGE!)  We got a few things to split since we were new to Macayo and wanted to try as much as we could.  We got the TCT and juevos con chorizo.  I feel like we also got something else that is escaping my mind right now!  The TCT is a giant open, family style quesadilla.  It was a great way to share with my friend and put exactly what we wanted on our own quesadilla.  Brilliant in my opinion!  For example, my friend loves beans but I don't... serving the quesadilla this way lets her have what she loves without ruining the quesadilla for me, and vice versa.  

Now after spending a few months in Brazil, I am quite the chorizo enthusiast.  For this reason, I get kind of nervous when I try chorizo at a restaurant, because let's be honest how do you compare to local Brazilian chorizo?  Macayo did not disappoint! Their chorizo was delicious that I ate up every last bite! 

Now, I only tasted one very, very briefly, but from what I'm told their Margaritas are amazing.  From looking at their menu, they definitely offer a variety of flavors and types and my friend got one and they're huge!  I unfortunately don't drink tequila anymore (let's just blame one bad night in college for that one) and couldn't enjoy one of the refreshing drinks, but you should definitely get one next time you stop by Macayo!"}
{"text":"This is an old family favorite.  If you are an old las vegas then you already know, they were around before most people knew what a taco was in Las Vegas.  Chips and Salsa are my favorite there, and the mini chimichangas.  Not the most authentic flavor, but still great."}
{"text":"I live in California and I can honestly say I practically grew up there.. shit, I've been drinking there since forever.. the margaritas are wonderful! and the food is the best I've had in most places... ( even in mexico...) I wish we had one where i live... i'd be there everyday for happy hour... lol  seriously."}
{"text":"Great food- and service! Very attentive with hardly no wait at all. I had a burrito bowl with shredded beef and a margarita. My bf had the lunch special: taco, enchilada and tostada. We are both happy and full!"}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars I would .horrible service , horrible food .They served me a cold chhimichanga  and wouldn't even make it right never again will we return don't make the mistake we did stay clear"}
{"text":"God love Macayo Vegas

. It's been here since I can remember (and that's a mighty long time). The neighborhood around it has gone almost completely Mexican, but Macayo has not! It's still the same old quasi-mexican-style bastion of cuisine that may not be entirely autentico, but suits the cravings of gringos just fine.

 The endless bowls of hot, fresh chips and two kinds of salsa (the chunky is newer and seems to be more popular, but the smooth, more garlicky one still tastes like the 60's and makes me happy), and, of course, the crispy, cheesy, and just a little greasy TCT, are the draws that bring us back again. Never did care much for their regular tacos - too fast-food/ kind of dog-foody tasting but their deep fried shredded beef ones are sooo tasty, as are the wonderful cheesy, sour creamy enchiladas suizas.

 Now bringing the third generation here to color the exact same sombrero boy on the kid's menu.

 If you want authentic, trot across the street to Tacos El Gordo. If you want a cool, dark place to escape the noon sun, and indulge in a big plate of god-knows-what drenched in melted cheddar cheese and shredded lettuce, this is it! Viva Macayo!"}
{"text":"If you work downtown and need to escape the office for the lunch hour, this is a good option.  

I am generally in and out of here within an hour's time.  The service is predictable and usually good though there are the occasional hiccups.  

The food is pretty standard for your \"Americanized\" Mexican food.  If you're looking for authentic Mexican food from someone's abuela's kitchen, this is not it.  

The parking can sometimes be problematic, as it's shared with the other business in this strip of shops, and it feels that the spaces are sometimes too narrow to accommodate most SUVs (which is only really an issue if you drive said SUV, like I do)."}
{"text":"Dead Mouse Anyone?? 

Imagine taking your daughter for her 16th birthday to dinner with 24 people! Bill comes to $500 ish and you find that your kids are playing with a dead mouse in the room your eating! Yep! That's what happened tonight! Disgusting! When we tried talking to the \"supervisor\" she proceeded to say $20 off my bill?? $20 are you crazy? Free not necessary but $20?? Then when we go to leave you follow us out to take pictures of our cars to report us? Well we will be reporting you to yelp, channel 5, 13, 8 oh and the health department! Thanks for the memorable 16th for my kid!

Ps.... Ceaser was an amazing waiter! He was the good part of the experience and the guy who walked out with us!"}
{"text":"Worst service for their standards WOW they don't come for refills or anything ordered appetizers they didn't come til meal came out Never again will I be here 
Beware of this place"}
{"text":"As a transplant from southeastern Arizona (almost 30 years ago) we were happy to find good sonoran cuisine upon arrival here. We have been frequenting Macayos for all these years, and, despite some forays into other so called Mexican restaurants, Macayos has been a constant purveyor of excellent food and friendly atmosphere."}
{"text":"The service was terrible. I constantly had a empty cup and had to ask several times for refills and was overcharged for our meal. Sad sad sad. The food was decent but not what I expected. Alas it is what it is."}
{"text":"I grew up on this stuff... and now that I live in New England, Macayo's is one of the first stops I make when returning home to Las Vegas. My family keeps those ridiculous gigantic margarita glasses at my Grandmother's house, just so they can have one more (this could set me off on a tirade about how margaritas, and mexican food in general should be simple and cheap... but if you are reading this in Las Vegas, you already know that). 

The chimichangas are amazing, the chili rellenos are outstanding... really, I think by now I have had everything on the menu, and I long for it from the other side of the country. 

Eat in good health, and have a bite for me!"}
{"text":"I first visited this establishment back in 2008 while on vacation in Las Vegas. We have family in the area so they know the good \"local\" places to eat outside of the strip. 

My first visit was very good - coming from Texas where we get top of the line Tex-Mex, as well as authentically cooked Mexican dishes. 

My favvvvorite item on the menu is the \"Spicy Chilorio\"... The words I want to use to describe the feeling I get when I wrap this creamy, cheesy mixture into a fresh flour tortilla - are not suitable for your general audience. When I tell you I dream about this dish, I am not telling a lie! It is perfectly spicy, very creamy but not overpowering like some similar dishes can be. 

On my last visit in late November - my entire table of 5 ordered the \"Spicy Chilorio\", and everyone agreed with me on how amazing the flavor is!

The service here is always great. I wish I could remember the name of our server assistant, he was white, very tall, and very attentive. He NEVER let our glasses get even close to halfway empty. The chips and salsa were constant - he was definitely better than our waitress (who was just fine, no complaints!). 

The only draw back for me, is the location! It seemed to be sort of shady, not somewhere we wanted to be late at night. 

Overall, I love this place!"}
{"text":"I am 'Vegas born & raised and have been eating here since the 60's. My parents ate here before me. My Mother in law has eaten lunch here every Saturday for as long as I can remember. She also has a margarita in her special mug. My wife and I join her once or twice a month. The chips and choice of salsa always get me ready for what ever I order. The food is not the Mexican food you would find in the spicy-hot places, you can actually taste  the food. I have never been disappointed. Occasionally I run into a local celebrity. Cops eat lunch here all the time."}
{"text":"I guess I'm in the minority, went here on the recommendation of my brother's friend that I had to try it while in Vegas. Not good. The meat in the street tacos was so dry, both pork and chicken. Honestly, I make better chicken tortilla soup. It was like watered down tomato soup with the nasty chicken chunks in it. I will day my friend got a burrito and it was like the biggest I've ever seen, but if never go back. Vegas has a lot of great Mexican food, pad on this one."}
{"text":"Do not get the baja pizza, its absolutely disgusting. Food in general is extremely heavy and pretty low quality. For the same price just go a few streets up downtown and get something that is actually delicious made with better ingredients, not oil laden cheese product."}
{"text":"I LOVE this location in particular.  They play oldies music, staff is friendly.  The best items on the menu are spinach queso and baja pizza.  OMG!  Sooo good.  Portions are huge, prices average.  We go here about once a week."}
{"text":"I went to a bday at the E Charleston location(on 6/9) After reading the negative reviews I was a little apprehensive as I haven't been to this location in many many years. I must say the area we were sitting looked very clean, the food was just as good as I remember growing up, the service was fast without making us feel rushed.  Our waitress had a great sense of humor, was personable, friendly and seemed happy which probabley wasn't easy because our table was a little needy. I would definitely return."}
{"text":"A sit-down Mexican place in front of El Gordo's. My husband told me he used to come here as a child, we brought his Mom with us and she said she doesn't think they ever changed the interior. It looks exactly the same. First impression about the whole restaurant- it's small and it smells old :-) but the food is good. Big servings and they give you free nacho chips with salsa (we probably had 4 bowls while waiting for food to arrive). The servers are super friendly and they made sure our drinks were refilled. Waiting time for food was probably around 20 minutes."}
{"text":"Love this place, a Vegas tradition. Have been to it several times. The chips are great. The toasted cheese tortilla (tct's to those in the know) are great. The burritos tasty, the fajitas great. The salad dressing, WOW, what's in it? The generous portions, the frijoles are super. Have tried many differant items over the years & never disliked anything. Well worth it anytime. Better service than other locations."}
{"text":"Came in on a Saturday for lunch and was immediately seated.i haven't been to a Macayos in a few years, so didn't know what to expect. Within minutes hot and fresh chips came to the table with homemade salsa. The wait staff member was friendly and attentive. The food was very well prepared. The large portions, food quality and the low prices will definitely get us to come back."}
{"text":"Americanized Mexican Food. 
Served by friendly but overworked wait staff in a location that..well it's seen better days. 
Pricing...slightly on the high side when you look at portion sizes and overall quality especially compared against what you can find at so many other places across the valley. 
I want to like Macayo but I just don't have any real desire to go back. YMMV."}
{"text":"I don't know what happened to Macayo's. They used to be the best Mexican restaurant en Vegas and now they are \"one more\". My favorite: their chips and salsa quality is gone, tasted like \"canned salsa\". The portions are smaller and the prices are up.
If they keep lowering the quality of the food, they will keep closing more locations."}
{"text":"4 stars cuz our waitress was not attentive.

but i ate the best chimichanga i've ever had in my life here. shredded beef baja style. it wasnt fried so much where the tortilla was crispy. but i like it like that. baja style means theres a special cream cheese sauce added on top. the sauce was so cheesy and creamy. the beef was tender and flavorful and there was tons of it! no skimpy dishes here! the rice was seasoned just right. the hubby had steak fajita and ate every last strip of steak and sliver of grilled onion and pepper. sour cream and guac were FRESH. you could definately taste the freshness. margaritas were tasty and not too wimpy or strong. just right. and i like mine with sugar not salt and they gladly rimmed it with sweetness. 

now for our waitress. didnt get her name.. cuz she didnt tell us. no name tag either. asked for water with lemon.. no lemon. and we had to ask each time for water refills. isnt that basic to refill water when its empty or at least ask when you see the empty cup at the edge of the table? lol.. we asked for a small order of guacamole dip with our chips and it never came. our food came.. still no dip so we just said forget it.

 maybe she was new cuz when she was repeating the order back to us she got it wrong. not only with my table but the one next to us too. she brought them the wrong dressing with the salad. when she came back she wasnt sure if they wanted ranch but they did. and then she was like ok good cuz i was going to get thousand island.

anyway.. this is some good grub."}
{"text":"This place is Mexican food for people from Ohio. The chicken is boiled and not seasoned. Enough said."}
{"text":"Difficult to find the first time as their.large lighted sign out mostly in need of repair. Parking is difficult in a crowded small strip center. The service was excellent even though it was understaffed. A lot of choices from a clean menu. Ordered tamales which were equal to something I could buy in the frozen section at walmart. Dessert was average, flan.
Two people two drinks two desserts total with tip $52.00
 Over priced under quality."}
{"text":"To start off with we came in we were seated promptly, a few moments later our drink orders were taken.  Roughly five minutes later our drinks finally come with some chips and salsa.  I had already started to get a bad feeling about this visit.  The waitress asked my wife to taste her diet pepsi to make sure it was right, however she did not wait around for the answer.  Her diet pepsi was flat.  A few minutes go by and she finally comes to take our order, we place our order and she leaves again.  My drink became empty during the wait and she finally noticed about 10 minutes later.  It took them nearly 25 minutes to get our food to us, of course what would happen?  They brought me the wrong food.  In typical fashion with this type of waitress she fled the scene before I realized that I had the wrong food, I was fuming that it was taking so long, no other place in town has ever been so slow in food delivery for a lunch menu!  It took her 12 minutes from the time she delivered her food to the time she came to ask how everything was.  I was finally able to tell her about our problems.  She offered to correct my meal but I didn't want to wait another 20 minutes so I told her not to worry about it.  She left promptly and about five minutes go by and she apologized for the mixup and asked again if I wanted my corrected order to go this time, again I said no and she started to collect our plates and left, to which I would have imagined she knew we were ready to go, another seven minutes go by before she brings us the check.  All in all it took us roughly an hour from start to finish, definitely not great lunch service.  She said she was going to correct the bill so we didn't have to pay for the wrong stuff, she took $1 off for my meal being wrong, how nice.  When I spoke to the cashier I was able to get the flat soda removed.  I'm a tipper, for excellent service I have tipped up to 50% before, rarely do I tip below 20% for decent service just because I know how hard these people work.  This is the first time in nearly ten years that I did not leave a tip.  We will not be going back to this location.  For lunch hours with not too many patrons you wouldn't imagine it would have sucked this bad."}
{"text":"Food is very good...and nice environment.  The only negative is its location, next to a always packed 24/7 Walmart.  Anyway, if you want quality and consistent Mexican fare, come here...as you know you'll get a good meal.  Very family friendly."}
{"text":"Since KoMex was closed until 27 Dec for the holidays, my buddy and I went went to Macayo for a real sit-down Mexican restaurant (instead of a fast food Mexican joint).  Big mistake as the kitchen took forever to prepare our food on account of the large group that was in the back room.  

The chips & salsa was ok, my taco, tamale, enchilada combo was ok.  Our server Melanie was nice, but I don't plan on going back to Macayo.  I'll wait until KoMex is open again or just opt for a fast food Mexican joint."}
{"text":"24 years+ here in Las Vegas and Macayo is still my go to spot for 'American style' Mexican food. I've tried nearly every sit down Mexican restaurant in town, and Macayo never disappoints...always hits the spot. 

Not the best location, but the spot still works. Good prices, great food, and a decent margarita. And usually, pretty good service. Not fine dining, but attentive. 

I'll be back..."}
{"text":"My friend and I decided on Mexican food.  He took me here since he's been here before and he likes supporting the locals. 

Our server was an interesting one.   According the my receipt, his name is Andrew.  He likes to see how you're doing by walking by, asking how everything is without stopping.  It was hilarious to watch every time he did that. 

As for the food, my friend got the carnitas tacos and soup, which he liked.  I wanted something fatty and fulfilling so I went with the Mex bowl after looking at the pictures that people posted on Yelp.  My dish was a little on the big side.  I ate most of it and was stuffed.  I thought it was alright.  I don't think I'm a huge carnitas fan.  I just forgot how it tasted like. I should've went with the carne.  I'll remember that next time..."}
{"text":"Great service...great food....great atmosphere.  This place is great and a new favorite.  Been to a lot of Mexican food restaurants but this one is best."}
{"text":"Ok I give them 4 stars cause everything from service to cleanliness to presentation was just fine. 
 Thing is though I've been to other Macayo locations and they were very Americanized Mexican food. Being that this location is smack Dab in the middle of many other authentic (Spanish speaking only) Mexican eateries well it made me figure this Macayo may fall in the authentic Mexican category. 
Well everything is very America style from the salsas, to the enchiladas, to the taco salads. We took a few bites, got Togo boxes and gave our food to a homeless dude out front. We were really looking for the Mexican Street taco and corn vibe. That's my go to style. 
 Now this is not a negative review being that there was a full house of customers who all seemed to be throughly enjoying this style Mexican food. So still I kick down 4 stars for the friendliness of staff, cleanliness and overall kind service."}
{"text":"I've always enjoyed going home to Texas to eat Tex-Mex.  Macayo's  has just taken away one of my reasons to visit Texas.  Great service from Linda.  Some of the best Tex-Mex I've ever eaten..."}
{"text":"It's all about the nostalgia. I had my first Macayo's about 40 years ago and from then on Shirley Temples and TCT's were a regular staple. TCT's and Shirley's eventually evolved into green chile cheese enchiladas and diet pepsi. So, whenever I go back to Vegas  for a visit it's just one those places that I have to take the kids. It hasn't changed. The kid menu is the EXACT menu from 40 years ago minus the sucker that they used to punch through the center. The chips and salsa, TCT's, enchiladas...all the same. It's not great food. It's borderline good. But it's nostalgic and for that I'll keep coming back."}
{"text":"My family has been going to this Macayo on E. Charleston for 50 years and I still love the food and atmosphere. I was 15 when we first started going there and now even though I have moved to Henderson and they do not have a Macayo, (which I wish they did), I make sure I get there once in awhile especially on my birthday. I love the shredded lettuce salad with guacamole and of course their enchiladas...great food."}
{"text":"You have got to be kidding me, we ordered our Cinco de mayo lunch from Macayos today and when our unknowing runner today got there to put the order in first of all she asked the girl working the counter how big the burritos are because she is a smaller lady and cant eat that much and the lady working the counter told her that the burritos are very small, just about the size of an enchilada and that she would need 2 of them so she ordered 2 for herself and 2 for one of our other employees and each one ended up costing almost $10 a piece and then I ordered the chicken Nachos which I thought would be priced normal and they where anything but that. 

I have added a picture of the receipt for the nachos.. You have got to be F-ing kidding me... They Charged $4.99 For the chips and then extra for every additional topping. What the hell is that about. Forget this place, I am sorry if you are a fan but this is plain robbery."}
{"text":"Had my first and hopefully my last visit.  I was unimpressed with the food.  I thought the prices were high for the quality (or lack thereof) of the food.  The cleanliness of the bathroom was bordering on unacceptable.  But it was close to the office and I had a nice time with my friend."}
{"text":"Macayo is a favorite with my family. Their salsa, carnitas, burritos, quesadillas and enchiladas are all delicious.

Macayo is awesome for large groups and all ages. From my little 7 year old cousins to my outrageously inappropriate grandmother in her 70's, everyone always walks away full and happy."}
{"text":"Good Mexican food is hard to find unless you are in border lands like San Diego or Texas.  Macayo is not quite there although they do a good job for Vegas.

This isn't the cleanest establishment and I have had to send back a glass or two due to lettuce or sauce on the rim of the glass.  The staff is friendly enough and replace the glass right away.  They have a varied menu from burritos, to tacos, enchiladas, and chimichangas.  The chimi's are very good.

They have a great salsa for dipping chips but the chips are sometimes stale tasting.  

I enjoy their faitas and they have great lunch specials.  The tortillas have the same problem as the chips as they sometimes taste stale.  Still, overall Macayo has the potential to come close to the Southern California restaurant level.  And as I said their lunch specials make this location a favorite of local attorneys and businesspersons."}
{"text":"Mmm...Macayo....Me like you lots!


M elt in your mouth incredibly delish

A ddicting 

C heese that is out of this world

A gain, Addicting

Y ou only wish you had some

O nly in Vegas....Oh, and Arizona

I don't eat Mexican food often though, if I had one of these places close to where I live, I would probably turn in to a burrito.

I'm talken lip smaken, melt in your mouth, wanna slap someone flippen DELICIOUS!! 

We got one order of there cheese nachos which was AMAZING!! I have not had nachos in years so, this was a major decadent explosion of cheesy goodness that feed the deep rooted cheese addict in me.   I also ordered some sort of Cheese Chicken quesadilla though, it was called something else- It was A Thick fluffy tortilla, stuffed with thick chunks of chicken with again, the most incredibly flavorful cheese I literally have ever had, all with some superbly fantabulous guacamole on the side....needless to say, I felt the size of a super burrito when I left.

This place really is addicting. I don't know what kind of flavor they add to there cheese though, it is any cheese lover's idea of heaven.

The overall appearance of the restaurant is nothing fancy and just a typical Mexican chain joint , the service is probably a hit and miss though,  the food.....you just have to try."}
{"text":"Alright, so we all know about Macayo's but I wonder how many of you grew up with Macayo's?? That's right, yours truly did. Most everyone knows it is not the incredible food  they have but it's really about the chips and Macayo salsa I can't tell you how many times I have downed bowls and bowls of their chips and salsa. There have many Macayo's restaurants that have come and gone from the old, old one on Paradise Road (think when this street went two ways) to the most recent closing of the one on W. Charleston Blvd a couple of years ago (sniffle, sniffle). This leaves only three locations.

My friend and I enjoy popping in at one of the oldest locations on E. Charleston. Yeah, it is not in the greatest part of town, but it is definitely a locals place. We have a history with coming to this restaurant after partying as they were always open in the wee hours for us to get our fix. We stopped in yesterday to grab lunch and enjoyed one of the lunch specials. We didn't have anything fancy except your typical Mexican fare (tacos, burrito, frijoles, rice and tortillas). We had nothing to complain about. The food was good and the service was exceptional! Oh, and of course the chips and salsa were warm and tasty. 

Whenever I have a need to taste old Las Vegas, I know I can always go to Macayo's and I am filled with warm memories of days gone by!"}
{"text":"We have had decent experiences at this particular Macayo's location. This time was not too shabby. We walked in and were being seated before all of our party was through the entrance. 

Shortly after sitting down, somebody came by to get our drink orders and drop off chips and salsa. Not long after he went to fulfill our drink order, the server stopped by to see if we needed drinks.

When it came time to order food, my father in law confused our server by asking if they had chili (he thinks Tex-Mex is served at all Mexican restaurants). She had a confused look and said they had green chiles that could be put on his food.

Our wait for food was just long enough for us to finish the first bowl of salsa on our half of the table. The food was good, decent flavor and hot.

While conversing over the meal, i had not kept an eye on my drink level. When turning to take a drink, there was a full soda sitting next to my half drank glass. Very nice to not go without beverages due to staff inadequacies. 

Looking at menus, comparing items, what they include and their prices, frustrates me. Some of the items are identical, with the exception of the sauce, which generates a $2.00 price difference?! This is baffling to me. I understand businesses are around to make money, and we pay to not have to cook and clean in our own homes. There are times, when charges get excessive.

The main reason for 3 stars instead of more was the price vs meal size. Granted, I can eat for days and still be hungry, but if I am going to spend over $10.00 a plate, I would at least like to feel like I've eaten $10.00 worth of food. Also, the location just seems... dingy. It was clean inside, well as clean as old carpet and booths can be. The overall feel of this restaurant is bordering on dive-y.

Macayo's on Tropicana near Maryland Parkway is well appointed, brighter feeling and more inviting to the diner."}
{"text":"Not sure what happened to this Macayos, but this spot is a \"tradition\" so I ate here. The service is horrible. We sat and waited 10 minutes before a waitress came to our table to give us water. Although, it was 5pm on a Friday and there was 3 waitresses working, walking past us not making eye contacting, the wait time is unacceptable. When we finally did get our drink order in with the waitress, the drinks were wrong. Long story short... Macayos will always be Macayos but the waitress and even the manager on duty (at the time) need to make a change with their service and staff, or they will probably be closing like the one off tropicana and Maryland parkway."}
{"text":"We ordered the combo meal, enchilada sampler, and the spinach dip. The spinach dip helped us to eat more chips than we should have. The combo was ordered with a baja chicken enchilada and the shredded beef taco which my wife really liked. I thought the enchilada sampler was a great combination: beef enchilada with green sauce, chicken enchilada with cheese sauce and a cheese enchilada with red sauce. We thought the food was good and the servings were large."}
{"text":"Been going to this restaurant since I was little and it never disappoints me! The staff and food are amazing! Love everyone who works there , especially Linda , Diana and Carmen"}
{"text":"Sat and waited for 45 minutes just to get a table because a server couldn't serve between 2 different rooms. Assistant manager Linda argued with our group because we did not make a reservation and the reservation party was more important than other customers. Linda argued with me, would not let me speak, cut me off, and walked away from me. This the worst customer service I have ever experienced and cannot believe a customer would be treated this way and when asked for an apology, she continued to argue as to why she did not need to give our group one. We also had two people on walkers who had to stand and wait. Do not come to this location, especially if Linda is working."}
{"text":"So I had Macayo's the other day...I ate the carne asada burro....with a CRAPLOAD of jalepenos...well 1st thing they charged me $1 for extra jalepenos....LAME! im eating mexican food, i expect it to be spicy! the burro had cheese sauce like stuff in it (i was not a fan) im from southern california...im used to AMAZING mexican food so maybe im biased...but yea not going back anytime soon. at least the service was friendly....but not too speedy- and it wasnt even lunch rush time!"}
