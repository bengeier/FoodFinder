{"text":"Their broth is so good! I tried their beef combination bowl which was delicious. Spring rolls were okay and egg rolls burnt. Just stick with their pho and you won't regret it! Also there was only one server working that night so it was hard trying to wave him down for things we needed. Still, will definitely be back for their pho!"}
{"text":"Had the soup fried rice and won tons.  At first we were the only ones there.  Later two other couples came.  

And strangely  the workers there all sat down to eat.  We felt bad asking for water and our check.   The pho was really good.  I finished it off the next day.  I would definitely go again but maybe do take-out next time."}
{"text":"Best pho in vegas; clean pleace, love it.

{"text":"Place is clean, server is nice, and food is delicious. I'm glad to finally have a Pho place on that side of town. I will definitely be coming back for more!"}
{"text":"This place is the Best. The owner is the sweetest man who always makes sure I'm a satisfied customer who keeps coming back. I only stumbled upon this cute, little place on a whim with a craving for spring rolls and viet iced coffee, about a month ago. And I've been back 5 times since. It's so great, even to call in and pick up a cheap, yummy lunch."}
{"text":"Awesome Vietnamese beef stew with rice noodles! And the peanut sauce that accompanies the fresh spring rolls was delicious. It's not far from work, so I'll probably make my way here once or twice month. Yum! :)"}
{"text":"This is the only Pho place on my boyfriend's side of town and we love the Vietnamese Fried Egg rolls so we decided to give it a shot. The inside was clean from a glance and the woman who waited on us was attentive.

We ordered a Vietnamese pork dish and some Beef Chow Fun along with a starter order of fried egg rolls. The food was just okay, nothing that blew my mind. The Thai tea was actually my favorite part because they served it layered. However, the egg rolls were pretty disappointing. They seemed really greasy, the serving size was four but they only came with two small leaves of lettuce to wrap all four in. Additionally when I picked up my lettuce leaf, there was a little black spider attached to it. At that point, I didnt want mine anymore. My boyfriend squished the spider and he said he thought it would have just smashed but it had a hard outter shell. 

Needless to say, as much as I wanted to like this place... I will not be returning. Food was okay and the spider was off putting on how they store or clean their vegetables."}
{"text":"Nice hidden gem in an unassuming part of town. Had the beef pho, spring rolls and a banh mi sandwich. All were very tasty. The beef broth in the pho had a nice, deep flavor. I've been to several local pho restaurants and this one holds up better than them all. I eat at Pho Kim Long regularly because it's 24 hours, but when this place is open, this is where I go. The prices beat any other spot in town, especially at lunch time with some great lunch specials. The staff is courteous and attentive, but not overbearing like you'd expect from a small \"hole in the wall\" restaurant. It certainly doesn't hurt that they're only a few miles from my house, but I've tried several pho places on the eastside of the valley and this one surpasses them all easily. I prefer supporting local, family run business' and this place is definitely that. It shows in all they do from the cleanliness of the establishment to the quality and care they put into everything they serve, including their customers. Will definitely be eating here for the foreseeable future, and on a regular basis."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place with my friends while in the area. Nice interior and looked pretty clean. We ordered a chicken pad thai, spicy satay noodle, and a regular beef pho. Service was pretty fast but we were quite dissapointed with the food. The noodles in the soups were all in one big clump and the beef was also in one large clump. The most dissapointing was the spicy satay noodle soup. The soup barely had any satay flavor and was pretty much just a regular beef soup with some chili oil. The pad thai was alright, noodles again were lumped together and were too mushy. Flavor was quite bland but luckily a squeeze of the lemon saved the dish. All in all, we would never return to this restaurant again as there are many better ones out there."}
{"text":"My favourite pho spot in the neighbourhood. Great portions and really well priced. I come at least once a week."}
{"text":"Bottom line: will not return.  Atrocious service and food is terrible.  There are many better places than this sub-par restaurant."}
{"text":"While not a Pho expert, I eat what I like. 
This was my second visit for lunch and decided on the chicken Pho bowl. Since the amount of green onion is small I asked for extra and they gave plenty. My first visit I had the rare beef Pho and I did not add any additional spice to it. It was good but I wanted more. So this visit I added some Sriracha to it and what a huge difference. 

Very fresh tasting, side vegs are fresh and it was a great lunch bowl. They used only white meat chicken and I do wish they would use some dark meat also as it adds more flavor. But it's their recipe. The bowl is so large I have yet to finish one. But for $6.95 it is worth the price. 

The staff is friendly, the place is clean, and food is served quick and hot.

I enjoyed this place. Small, out of the way and two doors from my other hangout bar. Will have to try the other menu items on next visits."}
{"text":"5 stars  just because the services itself was awesome! very kind, attentive &courteous staff. asked for no tripe in my Pho and they suggested to replace with a meat of my choice without charge. Also the grilled pork Bahn Mi (sandwich) bread was so soft yet it still had that crunch! I call that perfection! the spring rolls were had such soft wraps & was dressed with the freshest Veggies. matter fact, everything I ordered on my plate was FRESH! meats, veggies and all! see, im from Cali and Cali has many different Vietnamese restaurants I've been to for so many years I would say I'm pretty damn experienced.. all jokes aside, I'd have to say this is my go to Pho Joint. y'all gotta get out here! thanks for the great food, fast and friendly service Pho Bistro! u da BOMB!"}
{"text":"I had a bad experience here just today. As soon as I went in the restaurant, a female server told me that the booth seat is for those who have children so I just went with it. And we waited too long to order food, she knew it and yet she just pretended that she was busy cleaning the table, I know most of the restaurants usually get orders first cuz customers are waiting. Anyways, she came to us to get the order, (of course her attitude was like omg hate them), and her attitude was really bad as if she is a racist.  We also asked for cold water, she never brought the water even tho she heard clearly. So I had to ask again to the male server. The female server was horrible. She even avoided doing the payment moment, but she kept glancing at me cuz she was like that on purpose. I don't think the boss would like to hear this but she seemed a racist. Either that or rarely she doesn't want to work there. Whatever that is, that filipino female server made my lunch horrible. The food were good tho."}
{"text":"Convenient location if you live on the east side and dont want to go all the way to Chinatown. The pho is good but I like the pho at pho kim long a little more. Service was excellent and I like the overall feel of the place . Definitely gonna go back."}
{"text":"there pad thai was ok, kinda sweet,,,

But i will go here again and again and again for their Deep Fried honey Banana with vanilla icecream....what ever its called ,,,,, but its &^%&%@##$#$#$#^ DELICIOUSSSSSSSS !!!!!!!

i took this one for take out, but somehow it tastes better when u order it in, and it looks better too...

ive tasted a few similar deep fried banana dishes, this is the Best so far, and its not small like in other places ive been

6 stars out of 5 for their deep fried banana w/ ice cream dessert.!!!!
ORDER IN!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Went there with some family that were very new to Asian cuisine, and we all left thoroughly impressed. The prices are really good for the quality of food and the elegant interior. Service was good, but probably not enough staff for a full house. I had the Vietnamese grilled chicken and prawn with rice. The chicken was to die for!"}
{"text":"Very friend I can speak a few word they show me big smile when I try to talk their language"}
{"text":"Awesome Vietnamese noodle soup! 

Good quality chicken, huge portions, inexpensive, awesome service. Tried both the traditional beef broth and the chicken broth, both delicious. Vegetarian broth also available. Veggies and herbs totally fresh. 

Cheesy strip-mall notwithstanding, I plan to be a regular."}
{"text":"Awesome! delicious ! Pho was amazing aromatic frangrant flavors.The Ginger was a heavenly surprise. The appetizers battered shrimp and fresh crispy spring rolls out of this world.   i had the vegetable pho,  hubby had the shrimp pho, daughter steak pho and my other lil girl crispy noodle. Definitley going again."}
{"text":"The best restaurant ever.  Service, quality of food, cleanliness, interior, price.  everyone should be satisfied with this restaurant.  NO DOUBT!!!  Could not find any negative point.  They know and understand exactly what customer expect from them."}
{"text":"I was craving for pho, and wanted to try something close to where I live. I should have read some reviews, especially the one that said that the cold shrimp rolls were bad. 
1) Cold shrimp rolls: they were terrible. the rice noodles inside were expanded beyond acceptable limits and they weren't cut properly so I had the noodles spill their guts out. The shrimps were tiny (bait size) and didn't look appetizing. I would say do NOT order this.
2) Pho: the portion was pretty big. I'm not sure how to describe the taste, but I found the broth to be too strong (?) in an odd way, and I didn't like it.
3) service: nobody noticed  I was waiting to be seated for a couple of minutes, but once they found me, the service was quick."}
{"text":"First time here and was pretty impressed.  Clean, friendly staff, and the food was fresh and tasty.   I'm not a pho expert, but the rare beef was delicous with all the fixings (did also add my own garlic).  Wonton soup and potstickers are also tasty and we'll seasoned.   Had a bit of sore throat and cold creeping up on me, and the piping hot broth with basil and spicy stuff really helped.   For $20 you get enough food for 2-3 hungry adults, will be back."}
{"text":"I love this place! My husband and I have been going there ever since they opened and the owner is friendly and always remembers us.highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Delicious food, great prices, employee's are friendly, homey environment....I could go on but defiantly check out this place for your self."}
{"text":"Nice folks, but not sure what's happening here.. the three times I've come back the soup base was just tasteless. 

Also, with ordering 2 orders of fried egg roll (so total 8 egg rolls), I got 4 pieces of tiny lettuce (that slightly smaller than a tennis ball size). Thanks for being so giving..?"}
{"text":"I can't remember how many times i went here. P01 is my favourite! And their employees are nice not like the other pho restaurant near swiss chalet."}
{"text":"I ordered the pad Thai chicken. Overall pretty good.  Fast service,  Tasty food and good portion size except for the chicken...  I counted 6 small pieces.  
However,  they accept credit OMG and the server speaks perfect English versus the place I almost stayed... Entered asked for the menu and she didn't understand me.   BTW,  I don't have an accent... Born and raised locally."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch last Thursday and had the pho and a bahn mi with grilled pork.  The pho broth was very flavorful while the bahn mi lacked pork.  Just not enough.   I will be back though to try some of their other dishes."}
{"text":"My wife ordered off the luncheon menu and received a large bowl of Pho, I ordered off the regular menu and received a huge bowl of Pho. I had to take half of mine home. Loved the fresh vegetables served with the soup and especially my tea with milk and tapioca which maybe one of the best tasting drinks iv'e ever had in my life, yes it was that good."}
{"text":"One of the best Pho places in Vegas!! The only one my husband will have! He gets the pho with beef balls and rare beef and I just like the rare beef."}
{"text":"Good vietnamese food considering it's in Nevada. 

The house special fried rice is good. Not greasy nor oily, seasoning is just rice. 

Pho is good. The broth has less msg, and you don't get thirsty after.

M9 (noodle with bbq porks, spring rolls, vegetables, served with fish sauce) is yummy. The pork is very flavorful and egg rolls too. 

Will return whenever I'm traveling through Nevada.

FYI: very nice, attentive and friendly service too!"}
{"text":"Very slow service! I came in to pick up takeout they told me it will be 15 minutes and they made me wait almost 45 minutes extra! And everything I asked how long it will take nobody cared and all they said is soon! Very disappointed at service! Also extremely noisy!"}
{"text":"Great vietnamese food. Servers are very helpful and supportive of what kind of experience you want to get from their restaurant."}
{"text":"One of my favorite pho place in Vegas. Came here regularly always ordered the pho. They are delicious. I also tried several other menus before, fried rice, fried noodle, chicken wings, lunch special. They are all delicious. Everything in a good price. The master always have a great service."}
{"text":"Idk why others put less starts. The pho is amazing we also got spring rolls and egg rolls. Everything was delicious and $14 for it all. The service was great check this place out its worth it."}
{"text":"It was my second time here. I'm assuming they're understaffed because the lady didn't come take my order so I ordered my food at the register. 

I ordered the lunch special pho with beef. Even though the weather outside so hot,  it was ideal because it always cures a cold. As  for the actual food, it was good, as per usual. For $5.95, I'd say I left content."}
{"text":"Simply the best Pho in Vegas!  I found Pho Bistro through a mailer, so glad I tried them! My family and I now go weekly. Authentic Pho and Vietnamese food, with great prices and superb customer service. The restaurant is impeccably clean and has great ambiance. The food is ready at lightening speed and oh so fresh!  I no longer have to go across town for amazing Pho!!! The bowl is always heaping and pipping hot!! Really can't say enough about them!! Six stars if I could!!"}
{"text":"I love this place. The food is fresh. The sandwiches they make have the best bread. The spring rolls are my favorite. If it's too hot for pho (which is also very good, clean broth) try the m9 the grilled pork vermicelli. The price is surprisingly great."}
{"text":"Definitely a great pho spot. Really great flavor and Great customer service. The pot sticker appetizers were also amazing! Would recommend to everyone!"}
{"text":"Clean restraunt. Food is amazing and at a good price. The owner Jimmy is halarious and very nice. Promot service. I don't know why you wouldn't eat here."}
{"text":"The service was disappointing, the servers were just sitting in the corner hanging out, not helping customers. When they did come to our table, they were not friendly. 

The food was very mediocre, I have had better for the same price. I got the vermicelli with bbq pork and the meat was very dry. 

I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Our family always go here on weekends for dinner and they are so nice. Especially the owner, one time when they made two spring roll for us which we only ordered 1 they didn't hesitate to give us the other one for free."}
{"text":"This restaurant is situated in a strip mall and is small but they have excellent attention to detail on the flavors of commonly ordered dishes such as the spring roll (rice paper). And the pho here is definitely above average from the many places I've ordered pho across the country over the last 20 years.  Just thought I'd write these guys up as I'm visiting Las Vegas and it was a pleasant surprise!"}
{"text":"Always get the combination pho and fried egg rolls. And the Vietnamese iced coffee is"}
{"text":"I had twenty dollars, and having a pair of functioning legs meant I had no excuse to be eating anything from Centre Point's food court. So I walked across the street, and found the first Korean restaurant with English on their sign.

There was no Maitre'D, I had to be spotted in order to be seated. The place looked like the interior of a Lexus E360. Black leather everywhere below the wall, and cloth white above it. Huge amber backdrop by the bar, it felt a bit like an after hours bar. Every table resembled a booth at a club, only more comfortable. It's very laid back during lunch hours and the wait for the food is fair. I've always been apprehensive about pho, as most places have either good soup, or good everything else, but never both. 
I ordered the rare beef tripe tendon, and spring rolls. It was not until after five minutes of sitting down did I realize there was Korean Pop music playing in the background, at an appropriate background volume. It felt as I was a bit close to the table next to me, as I kept glancing at the girl's legs under the radar of her boyfriend from the corner of my eye. I was eating alone, and had nothing else to do okay.
My soup came, and I was satisfied with the portions. The Vietnamese style crispy spring rolls weren't cut..just sliced, and not completely detached. What was the point of that? And so, I had to cut it with my spoon. I've never received so much meat in my bowl of pho anywhere else, but the place was called pho 'Bistro' afterall.
I wondered whether if I should have gotten a rice dish instead, as I was in the mood for something hardy, and from the photos on the menu it didn't look bad. One thing I noticed about this place was that it was very clean. I can't say that for many pho restaurants, but this place I was impressed with. 

I sat in my seat for 15 minutes after finishing, and nobody came to rush me out. I stared with empty eyes at the Roll Royce parked outside and daydreamed about being chauffeured around by a European blonde.
 
I visited the washroom before leaving, and was relieved to find that it was completely hygienic. They even had a basket of pinecones by the sink. This was a three Man wash room. One on the toilet, one in front of the stall, and the third looking at himself in the mirror by the sink. 

Seriously, vanity mirrors in the boys washroom. Hell yes."}
{"text":"This used to be my go-to pho, until they started charging me for extra lime and soup.  They never did before, so it really threw me off.  There's literally a pho place at every major intersection, and I hate when they cheap out on their guests.  Unfortunately they are easily replaceable."}
{"text":"Came to visit Vegas and decided to check this place out. First of all, the service is pretty bad. My group came before 2 others and they got their food before us. The prices are affordable! But the wait for the food took long. It was good, except some people had upset stomachs after.."}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise to find this restaurant in our neighborhood.  We had a party of 8 and a great time.  excellent food and service.  Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"EXCELLENT FOOD - EXCELLENT VALUE!!
I \"discovered\" this place last week (5/2). It's in a seedy-looking strip mall, but dont bel fooled!!The best pho broth i've had in vegas AND Reno.  The fried egg rolls and spring rolls are luscious--flavorful and i would make a meal of just these.  The service was friendly and helpful--love this place!  My only regret is i don't get to that side of Vegas very often, but it's on my list next time i'm on the east side.  5 STARS FOR PHO AND GREAT VALUE AND SERVICE!"}
{"text":"I don't write many reviews. But this place is good. The staff are always very nice. He food is great and and pho broth is flavorful. I always go out of my way to go down there and eat"}
{"text":"I came to this place a lot because it was close to my house the food was good and the price was great but today the pho Was super salty and I told the waiter that it was bad and he told the owner and the owner treated me back I asked him for something else in return because I didn't eat it and he kicked me out but I still paid for it at the end....  I will never come back to this place and I do not recommend anyone to come in here"}
{"text":"The Pho Bistro is a pretty great pho place especially since this part of town doesn't have too many. They should definitely consider opening up a location in Henderson near the galleria mall since there are literally no pho places in the area. I deducted 1 star since the furniture is a little outdated and some of the seats are torn and what not. So it isn't the most up to date pho restaurant but overall it is a pretty good place if you're having a pho craving."}
{"text":"It seems that everytime I go for Pho, my eyes get bigger than my stomach and say in my cockiest voice \"Medium.. pfft, what do I look like? Better make it a large.\" And then it arrives, a salad bowl of broth, noodles, beef and bean sprouts and THEN I say to myself....

\"dammit\"

This was a great bowl of Pho complete with all the essentials; perfectly cooked beef, flavourful brother, tender noodles, and all the right sides. Let's be fair, it's not hard to mess this dish up. 

This would be a 3 star to match the other reviews but I feel it deserves a 4th star for the attentive service, quick turnaround on my order and unreal price, $7.50 'pho' a large! ha ha

Located just west of Yonge and Steeles in the same plaza, I'd recommend you pay them a visit!"}
{"text":"Love, love,love this place. Some might say it's a \"hole in the wall\" type of place, but those are usually the best places to eat at. And this one certainly has the best in town. It's family owned and the service is wonderful. We've been going since it first opened, and they treat us like family. I love when Jimmy, the owner, tells us, or rather educates us about Vietnam and it's culture. Just ask, if you're a curious person, like me. Besides the pho, they have a great combo dish (m9) on the menu. And the bahn mi's are also delicious. Everything is reasonably priced and everyone that we've ever taken there has fallen in love with the food. Do yourself a favor and try it out. Tell Jimmy that Juanita sent you."}
{"text":"Cute little mom and pop joint by our home. I was feeling sick and the pho definitely picked me up and revived me. 
Service was good an quick. Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"I had pho ga and spring roll. Serving size is somewhat small, food clean but very bland, reasonably priced. Menu is limited, service is fine. Overall not bad but not good either. I'd give the business another year."}
{"text":"First time at Pho Bistro with my family and we were all very happy with the service and the food. The Veggie Pho was delicious. It wasn't salty and the flavor was well balanced. The lunch special came with Tea or Soda and the lunch prices are all very reasonable. The gentleman who helped us was very pleasant and hospitable. He checked up on us all the time and he made sure our drinks were refilled. 
I recommend this place. Satisfaction guaranteed. Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Nice little pho place close to home. Probably the best in east Las Vegas! 

Spring rolls are always fresh & they have an awesome $5.95 all day lunch special! 

Looks like it's family operated, so that makes it feel cozy!"}
{"text":"East side gem.  Cool owners.  They remember their customers and give great service. 

The broth is really flavorful compared to a lot of other places I've tried.  The meats have all been fresh and they offer vegetable broth which many places don't.  We go at least once a week for take out."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! Staff was very friendly, the food was so delicious and affordable! I don't have to go to China Town anymore! I highly recommend this place! Love, love, love their Pho'!!!!"}
{"text":"Nice spice aroma and flavor in the pho compared the other places I have been to in Las Vegas. Pretty standard beef cuts everywhere. No one seems to use hanging tender beef cuts. It's so tender and flavorful compared to the flank cuts.

After putting in the veggies the soup was still hot. A big plus there. Very few places seems to get the concept that the soup should be piping hot when served.

Spring rolls and egg rolls seems kinda standard. At least the egg rolls came out hot and crunchy."}
{"text":"BAD, BAD, BAD

Food was horrible. They have one chef and he called out sick so all they had was soup and appetizers. Oh and if your NOT Asian don't go here. A couple walked in 20 minutes after us and were paying their bill when we got our food."}
{"text":"New Pho restaurant on the East side. Whoo hoo!

Had the won ton noodle soup this time and...OMG, I absolutely love the won tons here! I work in Chinatown, so I've had a few versions at various restaurants in the area. I have to say these pork & shrimp balls of goodness are the best I've had yet. The broth was especially tasty, too.

We also tried the grilled pork bahn mi sandwich and it was pretty darn good, too. Nice soft, yet crispy, bread and the right balance of cilantro & veggies ratio to the pork...and they didn't add too much of the Vietnamese mayonnaise to it either.

They are a little heavy handed when it comes to adding the cream to the Thai tea, but they have the right strength in the brew and sweetness, so it tastes just fine. :)

Looking forward to trying more of their items in the future.  You should, too!"}
{"text":"They have a lunch special that is 5 dollars for a small entree and a beverage. I did not get that this time as I was super hungry. Instead I ordered a full size chicken pho. The broth was very good

I will definitely come back for the lunch special when I am in the area."}
{"text":"The pho was fair. The broth was a little cloudy which is a huge downfall.  The veggies were wilted and the atmosphere was just mediocre"}
{"text":"Pho Bistro seemed to have the most positive reviews for pho in this area and I needed to satisfy my pregnancy cravings. We ordered the pork egg rolls, sliced beef pho,  and the pork vermicelli bowl. All were satisfying, but I like the broth recipe at other restaurants a little more-- too much anise in this one (but I'll come back after pregnancy just in case I'm ultra sensitive to it temporarily). Large servings-- we had enough leftover to enjoy the next day at home.

Nothing fancy in terms of decor, but we're not eating pho for the atmosphere. It was 85* outside the day we came and pretty hot indoors; it did not feel as though the air was on. Some people may not care about that, but I was eager to leave due to the uncomfortable temperature. When you're ready to pay, go to the counter."}
{"text":"I was here for dinner with my kids and as much as I would like to give them a 3 stars all they are getting is 2 stars for their awesome service ... The were Very friendly but I got to say the food didn't nail it ! I order brisket belly and steak pho for my self and chicken chow mein for my son .... well the broth for my pho wasn't tasty even with the lime the jalapeño and spicy sauce I added to it ... My kid's chicken wasn't cooked all the way  and so I decided not to let him eat it ..... And last thing the pace smells very weird and I suppose is because of the carpet on the hole dinning room. I don't think I would be back"}
{"text":"I'm impressed with the quality of meat here. They have beef tenderloin as an option. We had the filtel mignon with onions entre as well as the pho filet mignon. Both were excellent. Good service, and fair prices. Very good food"}
{"text":"The seafood Pho was awesome!!! The service great and friendly and best of all I can walk here and get great Vietnamese cousine without having to go to spring mountain because this east side Pho Bistro is the bomb.com!!!"}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite Pho in Vegas. Friendly, awesome service and I have yet to find something on the menu I haven't liked. The Broth(s) are excellent. The noodles are right.  Plenty of accompaniments...  I literally dream about the Banh Mi.  Don't know what they do that makes theirs so much better than everyone elses, and I don't care, as long as they keep on doin' it. The cherry on top is the pricing.  So glad to have such a gem in my neighborhood!"}
{"text":"This is our first venture here! The Pho was great and the Ba Cau was amazing! The service was excellent, which is unusual for Vietnamese! We will be back! Limited menu but what we had was worth coming here! Yum!"}
{"text":"Nice, quaint Pho place. It's a small shop, but was very quiet on a Tuesday night. Had the Pho meatball, very delicious broth. We tried the shrimp and crab egg rolls, chicken wings, and Banh MI Dac Biet. The egg rolls, were okay, they just tasted like egg rolls. Wings, were tasty, asian but flavorful. Banh Mi, was really filling had a hearty size of meat, more than normal banh mi's.

Overall, would come back again.

Oh they also have $5.95 lunch specials, including a drink."}
{"text":"One of our favorite pho places in town, and by far the BEST pho on the Eastside. I've eaten at every pho place over here, a few times even because I've been desperate, and none of them come even close. The pho is delicious and the egg rolls are good. We come here 1-2 times per month to get our fix and when we are too lazy to go to Chinatown. Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Probably my favourite pho place so far. Cheap, delicious and generous portions. I got the special pho (medium) and it came with huge portions of noodles and meat, the broth was very flavourful and they had this amazing chili sauce on the table.

Service was friendly, quick and attentive."}
{"text":"I was speculative on coming here but it was close to where I live and there aren't many good pho place around here. 

Came Tuesday for lunch, first impression is that it's nice and clean which is always a great sign. Our server is nice and helpful, brought our tea out quickly, very tasty. 

We ordered the spring rolls and combo pho. The spring rolls were awesome! All the ingredients were extremely fresh, peanut sauce was just right. The pho came out soon after that very hot which is just how we like it because we always get the steak on the side. Everything was well sliced, nothing was really coarse or carelessly made. Only thing is the soup could be more flavorful. Overall it was a surprising great experience and we will be back for more :)"}
{"text":"Huge hike in prices. I understand that they need to raise the price to keep up with the increase in ingredient price/wage but the price level now is a bit out of proportion to the taste/serving.

Service is still good and place is quite clean. No complaints.

I would still go here for the convenience but there is definitely better choices in the west end if you crave Vietnamese food."}
{"text":"I gave Pho Bistro a try and sure was a great choice. Situated on the Eastside, it is the closest Vietnamese restaurant to my home.  I called in my order for take out and the owner took my order. He was very polite on the call and gave me a total on the phone. Bonus points for that. He was very confident on the phone that it was going to only take 7 minutes. That make me smile.

When I arrived, parking was plenty and restaurant sign was visible. it is between Salsa Loca (which I've been to) and a tattoo parlor (which I have not or will).  The aroma of fragrant broth filled the space. 

The owner greeted me by my name (which I thought \"how did he know\"....but I might have been the only one with a take-out order.) He made sure I have utensils with my order. I ordered A4 2 pc Fried Eggrolls and P1 Special Beef Combination Pho.

Once I got home, I unpacked my dinner and was amazed at how everything was prepared.  The broth was in a stryofoam container/tall bowl with a bag around it.  The Pho veggies (beansprouts, jalapeño, basil and lime) where in a small bag.  The beef/noodles were in a compartmental box.  The noodles were not over cooked and stuck together (another bonus).  The noodle broke up effortlessly once mixed with the broth.  The broth is not overly fatty/oily/salty. The only negative was the fried egg rolls.  They were on a bed of lettuce and the condensation made it not crispy once it got home. Taste great still.

Overall 5/5."}
{"text":"First timer here! 

The area is a little run down but don't let that keep you from stopping by. 

The customer service by far is what will keep you coming back. The gentleman Louis (found out it was his first day), was absolutely amazing. He always checked up on us and showed so much charisma. I didn't even know it was his first day. He was so professional and knowledgeable. 

The reason for the 4 stars is because although the broth tastes good, it still needed a lot of \"doctoring\" up to make it the flavor I preferred. 

Overall, would recommend coming here. It's one of the best pho spots in the area. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Great place to simply fulfill your craving for Pho.
Their pho is tasty however their noodle and meat ratio is a little bit on the low end. They do give you a hefty amount of add on veggies on the side.

Their menu also has some Chinese fusion items on it too, also equally as tasty as their pho. I recommend trying out the iced coffee as well if you have a bit of a sweet tooth.

They are very accommodating when I order to go on the phone and have everything ready in about 10 to 15 minutes if you don't feel like sitting in.

Try it out for a quick bite, or just to hang out and watch random channels they play on their TV whilst you eat. By the way, their prices are pretty decent for the the amount of food they give!"}
{"text":"Great friendly service, good food at a great price. 1st time I found this place was late, they were closing in 5 minutes and they still made me feal welcomed, allowed me to dine in and no pressure or funny looks from the kitchen.
Place is small but kept clean, great Pho and Spring Rolls."}
{"text":"The spring rolls are so yummy!! The pho and the bahn sandwich are delicious as well. Everything has a good price. But the spring rolls are the best"}
{"text":"Where to begin...
Well I will be honest by saying I might not come back here again, Manu selection in my own opinion is small I couldn't even find any egg noodle soup dishes.. we order the rice noodle special pho dac biet.. fresh shrimp rolls beef ho fan noodles an avocado shake and the 3 bean dessert thing.. price wise I think they charge too much comparing to other pho places.. food came out way too quick which I find is a bit odd usually certain dishes take time.. flavor of the food I found to be bland.. the beef ho fan noodle felt like they were soaked in soya sauce before they just threw in the pan to heat up the beef was cut very chunky and a bit tough.. the fresh rolls was not great it look like no effort was put into making them and it was filled more with greens then noodles and shrimp was very tiny.. the 3 bean dessert was lacking some sweetness and evaporated milk it was a very dry dessert when it should be like halo halo.. the pho dac biet was alright isnt better than any other pho places i have been to.. avocado shake i would say is the only thing i enjoyed along with my daughter.. 

What I found to be very odd was at one point I saw the people that worked there started filming a couple that was leaving and walking to their car which is creepy odd and disrespectful doesnt matter the reason cause it shows that if you do something wrong or give a small tip (cause tips are based on service and quality of food and isnt mandatory). And it seemed like any time you asked them for something like a bowl or small spoon or scissors they all look at one another laugh and talk and stare at you which I didn't like at all . washrooms are not parent friendly there is no place to change your child diaper if they are still in diapers..

So yes this is the reason why I wont be going back food wasn't great. Service was odd and somewhat disrespectful to me after what I saw and it isnt baby friendly in the washroom.."}
{"text":"The BEST PHO in town!! This place is it! Drove all the way to Pho Kim long because it was after hours, but it was definitely not as tasty as Pho Bistro, my neighborhood Pho restaurant. I eat hear so often, it blew me away to try another restaurants pho and it just wasn't the same!"}
{"text":"I love this place and love the location. Close to my gym and starbucks. Their lunch pho portions work for me and I'm glad they have veggie pho with veggie broth. Only thing I'd ask to have in the future if possible is non dairy based milk or condensed milk for Vietnamese coffee  then i wont need to go to starbucks lol"}
{"text":"What a surprise to find a good pho place in a plaza full of unique korean gems! If you know me, you know I'm a noodle head so I was so down to find a place to eat in this area (seriously, if I'm ever lost, just look in this area and I'm probably somewhere eating)

I was happy to see that this place is pretty big (I hate small pho joints.. it feels a bit.. mafia?). I was seated right away and the older lady (I think she's the owner) spoke amazing english with zero accent- which has NEVER happened to me at a pho place. She was very friendly and even complimented my tattoos, which was sweet. I love when staff make an effort to talk to you rather than just simply slide the bowl of pho towards you and then wait for you to pay, like every other pho joint. 

The noodles were very fresh and EXACTLY how I love my pho noodles. Texture and quality were all there. I was not a fan of the beef because it was already cooked by the time my pho reached my table. This was probably because my broth was hotter than Dr.Mike on instagram (amazing quality in pho btw) but I'm sure I can do what I usually do at pho 88- ask for the raw beef on the side so I can cook it myself hot-pot style. That way, I ensure that my beef is the right amount of rareness. We also ordered avocado and durian smoothies and DAMN, were they ever good. Holy- their blender is amazing and there were zero ice chunks residing in my delicious beverage. What blender do they use? Can I has? 

This place is a gemstone."}
{"text":"Alright, I'll be honest. Had to come back as this is the best pho in town. There's just something about the broth, it's the best."}
{"text":"Pho is one of my favorite dishes. So it's nice to have a restaurant close by That serves this. The only thing I have tried is there pho so I'm not an expert on anything else at this restaurant. But friends that have gone there with me have ordered other items and said they enjoyed them.  My only suggestion is that I wish there was more meat and vegetables in the soups."}
{"text":"Satay beef and combination - both average. Satay not spicy enough. Service very poor due to this one lady food server. 

\"How many will use the chopsticks. If not everyone will use it, I will remove them because we have so many customers. \"

\"Next time, ask for the small bowls also when you order the noodles...\"

The way she speaks to customers lack tact. Better replace her or teach her the basics. 

Careful - food that falls onto the table may not be safe to eat. Cleaner I saw wipe a section of the floor using the same cloth for the tables. 

Consolation - scallop with bacon skewers were ok. 

The service however overshadows whatever positives we got out of it. 

Alternative - Pho 88 at Steeles Warden Foody plaza still the best! The owners are very friendly and food is much better!"}
{"text":"Very nice place and service is good also. Lunch specials are great but I usually order off the lunch menu. The pho broth is good! And I don't feel all dehydrated and thirsty after I dine here lol (cus some places use a lot of msg) the beef stew is just okay... I wasn't impressed but maybe they just don't get that many orders of it. But the pho and vermicelli dishes are great! My son loves the fried rice also. Food comes out pretty quick and the stuff is friendly :)"}
{"text":"I love this place reminds me of home or going to my aunty house for dinner. They have great customer services and bring the food fast . The food was also good like home yes there's other good pho too but this is in my neighbor hood , It's nice for the Eastside now I don't have to go all the way to China town :)"}
{"text":"Pho soup had too much star anise and cinnamon flavor and was too sweet. Overall a good Vietnamese place to go to if you are close to the area, but the spring mountain selections have better soup bases. The iced coffee was it bad."}
{"text":"When my dad wants pho, this is the place he comes to. Prices are low and food is decent quality. Service could be a little better but overall it`s a nice, casual, restaurant in a busy area."}
{"text":"Great veggie pho. Hard to find a place that has veggie pho and with veggie broth. The owner was really nice... Great service. A small place in a strip mall but clearly has a local following as the owner recognized people coming in and knew their usual dish."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were very hesitant eating at a pho restaurant in the east side but the reviews here helped. It's very clean and the service is awesome. The appetizers are great and the pho is awesome. The soup itself is a little on the sweet side. This is definitely going to be our new pho place instead of driving 20-30 minutes to Henderson or Spring Mountain."}
{"text":"This place is affordable and you get a lot of pho for the price. I get the chicken pho and the egg rolls, both were very satisfying. We found this place on Yelp and I had to give it a good review because of how surprised I was with the quality of food. overall very impressed."}
{"text":"I hate to say something bad, but the Pho broth was uneditable just color and smell was bland I felt like they put chicken bouillon in water and heated it up. My husband did get some good ribs. But if you love Pho don't go there and the vegetables weren't fresh and no cilantro was even in the Pho...just so disappointed I had surgery and couldn't eat all day and I was craving that and now it's in the trash."}
{"text":"First time coming to this place and to my surprise Pho Bistro was actually really really good. $8 for a large bowl of (good) pho doesn't really exist anymore. The portion was huge and the noodles were really good. The chili oil they provide is also amazing and smells great. I also got the coffee with condensed milk which was also great. Everything overall was just amazing. 

Verdict: Great.

If you're in the area then you have to try this place out. It's a really solid pho joint, it's surprisingly clean for a good pho place and price-wise, probably the best I've had in a long time. 

That's all."}
{"text":"I ordered the Special Pho Combination which was just perfect especially because I didn't want to drive all the way to Chinatown for some Pho. This is a great Vietnamese spot if you live or are on the east side. Great food, great service."}
{"text":"This little hole in the wall place has a lot to give! To start off they have fresh spring rolls which I crave at all times, they serve it with a delicious peanut sauce which is amazing. Their pho is very good, the broth has a very delicious taste to it, not bland like other places. They give you a fair amount (usually too much for me but enough for my be) 
 They have Thai tea but it's not the best. I would definitely skip on that. But their food has a very good overall authentic taste.
   The Place is a little hole in the wall. Very small and intimate. The workers are extremely nice and on top of everything."}
{"text":"Was in Las Vegas for the day, and wanted to treat my employees to Pho. It was good for a fair price."}
{"text":"Very friendly service , they are quick to bring you water while you wait and offer their insight when stuck between menu items. Ordered spring rolls and combination pork sandwich. Very clean restaurant tucked in plaza across from lvac on Sandhill and flamingo."}
{"text":"This is one of my absolute favorite pho places. The pho and bahn mi are delicious. Pho Bistro has a 5.95 lunch special, which is a great price! The owner is a sweetheart and makes sure to take care of you. It may not have the flair of other restaurants, but the food makes up for the simplicity."}
{"text":"good pho on the east side and really great price i'd say! they even got lunch specials on the daily. once you go in its basically your ma and pa joint. which i love by the way. always support the locals haha. so you'll get greeted and seated right away. so far i've been here a few dine in and take out and haven't seen it so pack. but theres always someone dining in when i go. the last time i went with my friend who has a disablility and the owner im assumming was so accomendatting and moving tables around just so he can feel comfortable.  that was awesome ! kudos for that. its not popular as your other pho place around chinatown but that kind of customer service is whats making me go back!"}
{"text":"Me and my husband decided to try this out for the first time he had chicken pho I had rare pho . With that being said it will be the last time I ever go there I've never had it where the cinnamon was so overpowering that I puked when I got home. They were very polite not the cleanliness of places but they were very nice their food I can't say the same about it was gross and believe me I love my Vietnamese soup. So beware unless you like an overpowering cinnamon flavor don't eat it. We also had their spring rolls not the greatest at all. So will not be going again."}
{"text":"Came here for some pho cause I'm sick and pho makes me feel better and honestly I wish I hadn't it's was not good at all. The meat on my pho was disgusting and old and it made my mouth itch! Ugh! Never coming back!"}
{"text":"The portion is not standard Pho portion.  Yet pretty decent food taste!  Not that good value for money..."}
{"text":"I've been coming here once a week for the last year mainly for the spring rolls. An order comes with 2 pieces. They use to make them fat with 4-5 pieces of shrimp & give you plenty of peanut sauce to go with it.  1 order was more than enough for my dinner. Last few times I came I've noticed that the spring rolls were getting thinner, less shrimp & they're not as tasty as they use to be. They're even getting stingy with the peanut sauce.  I'm hoping they go back to the way they use to make their spring rolls. If not I guess I'll have to go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Good amount of meat. Always so friendly. Have enjoyed all of their Pho. Love it. Great flavor and pricing and takeout packaging. Very professional"}
{"text":"Posted hours say they are open until 9pm on Mondays. I got there at 8:11 and they were locking up. I told them it says they close at 9 online, no apology, just \"we know.\" They must not be interested in earning  my business."}
{"text":"A friend took us to his favorite neighbourhood pho.  Was excited to try it out since I've been to many pho restaurants in Toronto.  Decor and service was good; food came out quick.  I ordered medium Pho Tai Nam $7.50.  Was a good size pho with lots of meat and soup tasted good.  Unfortunately soup wasn't very hot so took awhile for veggies and raw meat to cook.  Also they don't use fresh noodles.  Was also able to try the shrimp cold roll which was bland.  Probably won't be back unless I am in the area and most likely will order something other than pho."}
{"text":"I like this place, it's a small mom and pop with decent food. I've tried the beef pho, beef stew with egg noodles, beef fried rice, and Korean short ribs with rice. All have been tasty, but I feel that you get more food when dining in than to go. 

I often judge Asian restaurants on their beef quality, and this place is good. The broth is decent, better than some, not as good as others, but the way I eat pho it probably doesn't matter that much since I add a lot of condiments. The portion sizes are right for me (when dining in, a little noodle skimpy when not). 

The owner is very nice and friendly. The water is cold and has lime in it to mask the Vegas flavor. Cleanliness, the tables are sticky and I don't know about the restrooms. 

I like this place, it's not too far from home and I don't have to fight people for parking, which is a huge plus."}
{"text":"Usually when I go for pho it's a normal experience but this was a little above average. Not enough for me to give them 4 stars but still not a bad place. A couple of my friends brought me here. The decor seemed really modern, contemporary - nice. 

After being seated, it took a while for the pho to get to the table but wow was the portion HUGE.

The noodles, the beef, everything tasted great and in addition to that, it wasn't expensive at all! Service wasn't great, the servers did not keep tabs on us at all and just hung around, which is why they don't get the 4 stars but when I say a little above average, the food tasted better than other places I've tried. 

If you're in the mood for pho and are nearby yonge and Steeles, give this place a try!

3/5"}
{"text":"I usually love this place, but I tend to get the same thing here every time I come- the pho ga. My allergies pretty much preclude a lot of the other soups.  But I just tried their beef stew w baguette. The baguette is as good as usual, but I have to say-  don't get the stew. There aren't that many ingredients in it- too much broth in the ratio. And more FAT than any other ingredient in the entire soup"}
{"text":"Wow I love it. Pho tai was amazing and I got the lunch menu came with a soda. Our waitress was very nice and kept an eye on my water to refill. It was fresh inside and cozy really enjoyed it."}
{"text":"\"Some high quality pho for a low quality price in a quality setting\"

So I've been eating a lot of Pho recently. A lot. I have yet to find a food that costs so little yet provides so much meaty and hearty goodness without the guilt or regret. Also it's available in a lot of places, and for the most part doesn't deviate too much in terms of flavour profile regardless of location or ingredients. The problem with Pho is it's hard to eat in the summer because it's so very hot outside so having a cool, air conditioned atmosphere to eat is paramount otherwise you'll need a towel during the meal to wipe off, especially if you like hot sauce and peppers in your pho.

Having said all of that, in terms of all of the pho places I've been to, this is actually quite good. Very happy with everything I've had here.

Atmosphere

It's at Yonge/Steeles so right there around all of the shopping, car dealers, farmers markets and ethnic grocery stores. It's also adjacent to a lot of other really good businesses and restaurants that I want to yelp/check out as well. Free parking is also always a plus but the lot fills up quick, especially with a Pokestop right in the parking lot. 

Inside, nice atmosphere with quality finishes on the tables and decor that looks like an upper end AYCE sushi place. Ample room for seating and stone countertops on the tables is a plus. Very inviting. This is important as it doesn't feel as \"Divey\" or \"grimey\" as many of the \"good places\" have. 

Food

Lots of choices when it comes to Vietnamese and Thai cuisine. Lots of combos, appetizers, and entrees. Of course the title said Pho Bistro so I got Pho. I got the house special pho (as I tend to do everywhere I go - best bang for my buck). I was very tempted to get a large, I mean I'll get to why in a second. I always view the Large as a challenge but I caved and got the medium partly because it was my first time there, and secondly I wanted to have another meal that day. 

The medium was MORE than enough. The flavours were very pleasent, subtle and strong in the right ways. Lots of noodles and enough meat (could always use more, but the meat content is more than fair). Supplemented with chili oil, sriacha, fresh basil, and other fresh herbs and veg. Very happy with it and would definitely order it again from here.

Value

The best part, the Pho ranges from $6.50 for a small to $8.50 for a large. Enough said. Are you kidding me? It's mega affordable, it's filling, and it's delicious. If you're in the area, it is tremendous bang for the buck. Would go again."}
{"text":"We came in for take out. I needed , yes needed. Okay, i wanted Pho.
This was very good,  not the best.  But i enjoyed it. We waited about ten minutes in a booth for our to go order. While we waited the cashier/server , was friendly & talkative. He even have us water for our Short waiting time. 
The restaurant was clean and had about 4 tables of people at say 2pm? 
I'll go again if in the area"}
{"text":"I want to like this place, I really do... but there were just too many problems. 

I ordered pho with rare sliced beef and beef balls... and requested it in a larger size. The menu only displays one price, but the server said he can make it into an \"extra large\" bowl for me. I was hoping I'd get proportionately more meat, but I ended up with a large bowl of what seemed like endless rice noodles. TASTE wise, it was fine, but I felt a bit ripped off. 

Interesting to note: there are no containers with fish sauce on the tables... but they have single-use packets for SOY SAUCE. This should've been my first red flag. 

The next problem is that I was craving some traditional Vietnamese coffee, hot. Even the menu has a cute picture of what it's *supposed to look like*... a hot, slow drip. When I put my order in, maybe 45 seconds passed and he brought out a mug with a spoon. He warned me \"It's super super hot and also VERY strong!\" To emphasize how strong he believed it was, he grabbed me a container for sugar and set it next to my cup (something that I did not ask for, but it gets better)...

I tasted it and immediately felt disappointed. One, this wasn't how it's supposed to be served. Two... it tasted almost identical to the Vietnamese instant coffee packets I have at home! Two packets, to be precise. No extra sugar was necessary because I never add sugar when I use my two packets at home.

Maybe I just got my hopes up too much from other Yelp reviews. Is this place terrible? No. (The restroom was well maintained, at least.) But don't go out of your way to come here! I spent a little over $14 and walked out disappointed."}
{"text":"I love this pho place! First thought process was pho on the east side? But I'm sold! After eating here for the first time with a couple coworkers i come here regularly with my best friend. The service is good, the really friendly, pho is great, fried rice is good, & thebun or vermacelli bowl is amazing! Everything is also pretty fairly priced."}
{"text":"This place took over Beijing Noodle & I'm glad! I am sad to see a local spot gone but the family that owns this place is cute. I feel like they just opened a place to serve food they make at home. They claim to be a Vietnamese and Chinese spot but I didn't see much Chinese except for the fried rices.

It has a typical Vietnamese menu minus the curries. I did however see they offered a beef stew with bread yum.

Basically the food was good, the place was clean, and the service was polite. They could do to stop by the tables more often except to drop food off but I enjoyed all of the staff I encountered. Very sweet and friendly. 

We tried their combo pho $8x 2, a ban mi dac biet $3 and some change, and their spring rolls $3. All came out to $24 and some change. We were stuffed. It was a bargain IMO.

I really liked their sandwich. Their bread was hot, fresh, and crunchy. I've never had one like that. I want to say they didn't put the patte part. I have to say I didn't miss it, and I've been eating those sandwiches since my childhood. At first it looked like they skimped on meat but it was perfect. I loved it.

Their pho was good. It was a good size with a large amount of meat. The broth was good, the noodles were cooked just right, and it was served super hot. The bowl looked below average in size but it was just the right amount. I finished the whole bowl and the broth. 

Their spring rolls were good. The dipping sauce was good. I enjoyed them. 

I have to say for a newer place I thought they did a great job. If they are reading and I could help them improve I'd say to offer straws for their water, get a napkin dispenser for the table if they don't plan to walk by too much, and lastly take their service to the next level. 

Overall I do plan on returning soon. In comparison to a Pho Kim Long, Pho Saigon, or Pho So 1 it is just as good but with the friendly staff you won't find in China Town.

Check them out!"}
{"text":"I finally found a reason not to drive to Spring Mountain for pho.

Pho Bistro is the place that replaced Beijing Noodle Cafe, which was a Chinese restaurant with similarly inexpensive, casual eats. This place has actually been open for almost two years, but I've found reason after reason to keep putting off my first visit, including disbelief that we could have anything good out here and lack of reviews from familiar Yelpers. I ended the procrastination today with a lunch visit.

They offer $5.95 lunch specials daily from 11-3, and it's not just the typical fried rice and whatnot. There are 4 pho options, including vegetarian, beef meatball, chicken, and the Pho Tai that I got with rare sliced beef. The bowl came out quickly and was piping hot, which hints that they have a huge pot going in the back like all good pho restaurants do. Well, that would've been just a guess if I didn't get a spoiler because my seat was in line of sight with the kitchen door. That huge pot on the stove was a giveaway.

But that doesn't matter if it doesn't taste good, and boy was the stock surprisingly delicious. It might be a little too sweet for some, but to me that just means that it plays well with the lime juice that I ended up fully extracting after a careful squeeze into a spoon of broth and a small sip. The pho noodles are pretty standard, and the meat was tender and savory. The Thai basil was fresh, and so were the bean sprouts, which I normally skip but decided to throw into my broth this time. Value-wise, it's a small bowl that works for a lunch portion and is great for the price.

By the way, the lunch special comes with soda or tea. I went with a hot tea, which ended up being a bag of what was labeled as jasmine tea that was allowed to steep in a mug of boiling water. I was expecting a little more jasmine aroma, but it was a nice way to cleanse the palate and get a little caffeine to stave off the food coma.

Pho Bistro is home of my favorite pho east of the Strip, and it should be the first stop for pho if you're on this side of town or if you're in the immediate vicinity. Henderson is pretty mediocre, and there's one spot on Boulder Highway that I still need to look at, but this is probably the go-to place. And this rating could actually rise if their other options are as good and if the pho is consistent. I was gonna try a banh mi sandwich, but I have other dinner plans. Next time!"}
{"text":"Good bargain.  They are evidently Vietnamese but serve Thai and Chinese food as well.  What we ordered was cheap, very tasty (great soup) and well-prepared.   Total number of selections of each varierty is limited and the Thai stuff we ordered seemed to have a Vietnamese or foreign influence (Satay was deep-fried, but very tast that way).

Nice friendly service - we will be back!"}
{"text":"My new favorite pho spot!! So Delish and fresh!! Had pick up twice and was always yummy!"}
{"text":"Most of the asian restaurants in the area were Korean ones and I didn't feel like eating at the food court.  So I stumbled upon this restaurant which seemed to have good Yelp reviews.

I ordered :

P01.  Pho Bistro special combination  ($6.50 for medium)

The pho and soup base were excellent.  The beef could have been more tender though.

I didn't think I would find such a good pho place in the area.  The decor was lovely.  Great location.  Nice prices and friendly staff.  This review is based on a single soup noodle but from this pleasant experience I would gladly visit again!"}
{"text":"Came back for a weekday lunch around 12:30 and this time, there was no huge line up like last time.  :)  My party was already seated and we promptly ordered our lunch of satay beef pho, rare beef, tripe and brisket pho, rare beef pho, fresh spring rolls and a grilled chicken with spring roll platter with a side of fried egg.  At $45 including tip for 4 people, it was a satisfying meal indeed.  

Food arrived quickly and the pho was as good as I remembered it from last time.  I'm deducting a star this time for not so fresh looking sprouts they served up with our meal.  The little green chillies they served with the sprouts were not at all spicy so it didn't add much to the experience.  

Still a solid place for pho.  I'll be back again"}
{"text":"A little hole in the wall. The grill pork and rice was bland when I got it. The waiter was nice. Service was good. Food was not that great. Not my place for vietnamese food."}
{"text":"Our drinks came out at the end of our meal. Server didn't even apologize for the delay. The chicken wings were way over fried and had no chicken flavour. The lemon iced tea was very sour. The tapioca was old. A hair was on our drinks glass. Good thing it was on the outside of the glass and not the inside. The pho was ok. Bad service. Too bad."}
{"text":"I've had a lot of pho in this town and I have to say that this has been my favorite and tastiest pho broth I've had in a very long time! It's a small and quaint family owned restaurant. When my pho came out, the smell was SO aromatic! I hardly ever finish my broth when I eat pho, but this time I nearly finished the broth! YES, it's that good! You East siders are lucky to have this place and not go to China town! Glad I stopped by here cause it's close to my church!"}
{"text":"Reasonably priced and very close to home. Their spring rolls are some of the cheapest in town and taste really good. There peanut sauce is pretty good too. The pho broth is a little sweeter than some but still delicious."}
{"text":"The service is the best, so friendly unlike other places that treat you like a complete stranger. Best pho on this side of town! And the lunch special is such a great price. The iced coffee is so great too!"}
{"text":"My first time eating at Pho Bistro was amazing. The location itself may be considered sketchy, but the quality of food is outstanding, plus we all know the hole in the wall like places are the best ones! The owner was extremely welcoming and helpful, and the broth of the Pho was tantalizing! The flavor was so rich of different characters that typically I don't consume all of the broth afterward, but I gulped it down gladly! My son, who is 2 1/2 years old, had the chicken pho and was delighted with it. He ate and drank the broth and enjoyed every second of it. With this review, I highly recommend this place to try, great prices, owner was welcoming, the decor may have not been my taste, but the quality of the food was incomparably great! New pho house that's for sure!"}
{"text":"Their beef stew with baguette was amazing! I burned myself multiple times because I couldn't wait to take another sip! Their pho combination was okay. But did I tell you about their beef stew? Yeah, it was pretty great!

One complaint, I asked for a to go bowl. I was still eating my stew and the kid (he works there) started packing it for me. I wanted to eat more :(

Anyway, still a great experience!"}
{"text":"Decided to five this place a try after the Korean place we wanted to go try was closed. Ordered a large pho with beef balls a rare beef, taro spring rolls, and a vermicelli bowl with pork and beef. Spring rolls were crispy and delicious, a hit oily, but they ARE deep fried. Pho was a good size and broth was on point. Meat on the vermicelli bowl was seasoned and cooked perfectly, only complaint was the noodles were a bit soggy. Overall, solid place and would come again."}
{"text":"Meh.....I got the spring roll and a Banh mi.....both seemed to lack flavor, which is funny because the whole place had an overpowering stench of fish sauce. Service was super slow. I doubt I'll be back, even if in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Very good lunch specials with great prices. The broth here is tasty. The Banh Mi are wonderful with crusty bread and deliciously seasoned grilled pork. The service is quick, kind, and efficient. Try them out!"}
{"text":"This was my first time trying Pho. My friend dragged me out to give it a try because she was having a craving and hadn't been to this location in while.

We ordered two appetizers. The crab and shrimp eggrolls, two to an order, for $3.50, and an order of pot stickers that were $4.95 for an order of six. Then for our actual lunch we both ordered the \"Pho rare sliced beef steak\" for $6.95.

For the price, you can't go wrong. The Pho was in a large bowl with a lot of noodles, but not the heaviest on the meat part. The broth was tasty and the meat was too, I loved the crunch of the bean sprouts they supplied for us to add. The only thing that was a little off putting was all the cilantro they put in the bowl, it was a tad overwhelming. 
The appetizers were good, nice and crispy and flavorful. Our waiter was nice and accommodating."}
{"text":"Not the best . Veggies and herbs on our ban mhi not fresh. Pho not flavorful. \"Siracha\" tasted like Tabasco. Sad because so close to home but won't go back ."}
{"text":"Good food and great service! The gentleman who took our order was very kind and friendly. Food came out rather quickly and it was delicious. I will definitely return. If you're considering going, check it out!"}
{"text":"I struggled to find a Vietnamese joint to get my fill. This is hands down the best Vietnamese food I've had in Vegas. The food is so simplistic, yet so full of flavor. Staff is super friendly and incredibly helpful in understanding the dishes and their ingredients... and they are very flexible in making accommodations and substitutions for certain ingredients (I'm talking to all you vegetarian/vegan peeps out there). On the outside, this place may not look like it has a lot to offer, but it is a well hidden gem for a reason. Try them out, you won't regret it!

Also, get the Thai ice tea. It will quench your thirst with this infernal heat going on."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been coming here since shortly after they opened. This is hands down the best Pho we've had in Vegas. We've been to all the most popular places for Pho in China Town, and this hidden gem is better.

They don't have a huge menu like Pho Kim Long, but their food quality is far better. Their beef Pho has the best broth I've ever had, and their prices are very low for food of this quality.

Besides the Pho the banh mi and rice dishes are all very good. I can't recommend this place enough."}
{"text":"I was in the mood for Pho, we came across Pho Bistro because it is close by my husband's office. I had the Pho Tai lunch special, for $5.95, you can't beat it! It was really good. Next time I went, I ordered the won ton soup, which is amazing! It has lots of big, delicious won tons, tons of noodles, and meat. Then of course the bean sprouts and fixings on the side. I like mine with a bit of Sriracha too! So yummy, can't wait to eat it again! Service is top notch as well."}
{"text":"Decently priced, have tried a lot of their food and has not yet disappointed. Owner has great customer service. I would definitely recommend to family and friends."}
{"text":"Me and my friend were trying to go to Oh Curry, but they were closed. But we are so happy that we found this Pho instead! I ordered the rare steak and meatball soup. The broth was so flavorful and they didn't skimp on the meat. We will definitely be coming back here during the cold winter nights!"}
{"text":"This place has god-awful pho. I should have known when I entered this place when the place was only 10-20% full at dinner time. My pho came to my table with the noodles clumped/stuck together in the soup. I had to break the noodles up. It was not an enjoyable meal. It was just plain lazy whoever prepped my meal...It was like they prepared the noodles in the bowl so far ahead in time that the noodles cooled and congealed to each other. The soup tasted alright, in my opinion light tasting. The only thing saving from my meal was the deep fried banana and ice cream - which was truly a treat. Still, they don't deserve to use the word pho in their restaurant name if they can't competently serve a basic bowl of pho. I can't see myself coming back here again."}
{"text":"Best pho in east Vegas.  The beef is fresh and still bleeding like how it should be. Great service with a smile. With the food that tastey the prices are a little low. It's in a great location with lots of parking. Also The Viet shaken beef is amazing. I get it to go all the time."}
{"text":"Great Place to stop and enjoy some Fantastic Vietnamese Food and Good Customer Service. Very cute Asian Style Atmosphere make it quaint and comfy. Coming back for more."}
{"text":"Nice enough place. Interior is good, service is good, food is not bad and cheap. 

I found the portions a little small, but at those prices, you should be getting a few dishes."}
{"text":"Not bad. I only had the vermicelli but I think that's how you judge a restaurant not on what they sell the most of but what they don't. It wasn't the best I've had but it did have mint in it which was new and refreshing I'm sure the pho is better and I'll be back to taste it."}
{"text":"This is my favorite pho place! There food is amazing and also the servers are nice always. My kids love the pho and I love the spring roll! Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Very good lunch specials! Several items to choose from + your choice of soda, all for less than $6 before tax. Service can be a bit slow because it's usually just the owners working, even if there are not a lot of customers. Food is very good and definitely worth coming if you're around the area around lunch time."}
{"text":"The service was great. The owner have great suggestions and were extremely accommodating. The food tasted great and came out really fast! I would definitely recommend this place to my buddies. The prices were pretty reasonable too. I'll be back next time. I came with someone who is viet and he enjoyed it too (if that makes any difference lol)."}
{"text":"Must try: Pho Bistro Spring Rolls

It was a very enjoyable meal! 

We ordered the (1) Pho Bistro Spring Rolls, which I would definitely recommend to share. I loved the flavour of taro with the minced meat and shrimp, it's quite special and not your average spring roll.  We also got the (2) Pho Bistro Special Combo Pho. There is a pattern eh... Always order the dish with the restaurant name in it, you can't go wrong. The pho was actually just alright, the portion was good, but the taste was sufficient, not phenomenonal. Last thing we got was the (3) Vermicelli Platter with Sugarcane Shrimp and BBQ ground pork. I always love the sugarcane shrimp, I can't explain why, I just have a weakness for eating such a street-eat finger food kind of treat. I also liked the fish sauce for the vermicelli. If I remember correctly it was somewhat different than what it's normally like. The ground pork was interesting too... Different flavouring than what I'm used to. 

The portion size was huge! After the two of us declared ourselves full, we still packed a whole box to go. Score.

{"text":"This place is in the same location that Beijing Noodle Cafe used to be at. I came in 10 minutes before close and they still took me in. They asked if I wanted my order to go and I asked if I could done in and they said ok. Maybe they didn't want to but they were still nice. We ordered egg rolls which only come with 2 but they came out fast and were piping hot and crispy. Our pho came out not too much longer after that. Broth is a tad oily but it was pretty good. I would order my beef next time on the side because it was not pink like if like to see. Overall the bowl of pho was comforting and the place is clean. I would definitely come back because they're relatively not too far from home and they were super nice!"}
{"text":"Okay so ordered my food to go, two of the rare steak pho and the fried wontons. While I was waiting for my food everyone was very nice which was a plus. I really wanted to like this place! Despite a few reviews saying that the pho was bland I decided to give it a try. So once I got home and tired the food, the wontons were delish but the Pho was bland :( It was a let down."}
{"text":"Been here a few times, since discovering this place a few months ago.
Besides excellent soups, there is a very nice variety of Vietnamese, Thai and some Chinese food. 
Very tasty food, reasonable prices and good service.
I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Good place. The Vietnamese coffee w/ condensed milk was good and all the food we got was excellent. Server was polite and everything was fast. Good place that isn't as far away as many. Give it a shot."}
{"text":"I say this is the best Pho in town.  Price is $6.95 a bowl except combination or shrimp one, that is good deal."}
{"text":"I was dropping off a friend in the plaza on a Thursday evening when I came across this restaurant. I was hungry and didn't think twice before walking in. There was a fair number of customers seated, mostly families and I thought it should be alright to try.
I ordered a soup and Pad Thai to go and the order came faster than expected. When I came home to try the highly anticipated Pad Thai with shrimps I was very disappointed with the taste.  I have tried curry pad thai all over North America at various restaurants and frankly did not expect such a bland taste.  I could barely taste the crushed peanuts if there was any in it. All I could taste was the noodle and curry.

 The spicy chicken soup was good though. It had all sorts of vegetables including mushrooms, broccoli, bell peppers, celery and more."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the Pho filet mignon!! The broth had a great flavor and I was very happy with the speediness of food coming to the table after the order. The only reason I did not give 5 star is because service was not the greatest when it was time to to pay. I guess you are to walk to the front cash register when you are ready to pay? I wanted to order another soda but no one comes to check on you once they bring you your food. Other than that, the filet mignon Pho was so good that I will for sure be back regardless of the weird service when it was time to pay . My daughter had the chicken pho and that was ok but compared to the flavor of the beef, it wasn't all that."}
{"text":"I always surprise at how competitive the restaurant business is!! 

Since there is no menu posted outside Pho Bistro, and I was hungry and it was after 9 pm on a Sunday night... I just got stood up... I just want something warm and comforting to eat.

This place is really nicely decorated for a Pho Joint, modern and chic with dark wooden theme....

Price for a Special Pho Small is $4.95!!! Pho Bistro is cheapest pho place I been to yet, aside places that might have lunch specials!! And for that price, the food is good.... broth has good depth and has a hint of anise.... Noodle though the dried type but was cooked properly.

Cold Shrimp Rolls ($4) was disappointing! The shrimps were tiny and the rolls just look ugly and tasted so so... like something I made myself..... 

I would be back just for the Pho if I want a cheap, decent pho fix.. and with that price Pho Bistro is a good choice if I am in the area!"}
{"text":"First visit and wasn't disappointed, perfect fresh shrimp roll and best spicy Satay Pho in many outings it different Pho Bistro's, excellent soup with huge noodle and meat to go into medium bowl. Was definitely surprised by this Bistro offerings, will be back."}
{"text":"This place beats all of the overhyped pho places on Ossington and Spadina! I'm surprised by the low ratings but that could be because of the thai food they serve, which we didn't try.

We ordered a rare beef and well done flank pho, and a grilled chicken and pork rice with cold vietnamese coffee & condensed milk. Everything surpassed expectations! 

Pho: The broth was rich in beef flavour and delectably savoury. They're also not skimpy with how much meat you get. The noodles are just the right level of thickness and chewiness (not overcooked or too starchy). 

Rice: With the rice, you get a fish sauce mix with a kick that is absolutely delicious. The meat was well seasoned and tender.

Viet coffee: real drip coffee with creamy condensed milk. Coffee was smooth and aromatic.

In my opinion, the best pho place in the city!"}
{"text":"The pork chop and chicken on rice. The vermicelli dishes. The fried spring rolls with shrimp and pork. The coffee with condensed milk! The pho - raw beef! The Tom yum. The list goes on...

This restaurant is always packed - prices are some of the best in the city for such a high quality of food. 

Owner is a great guy - he sells me large jars of Vietnamese coffee sometimes - saves me driving all the way to the market on Rutherford and Jane. 

I come here with friends and family once a month - it is a regular haunt and to be honest - there would be a hole in my heart if it ever closed.

The Pho quality has dropped off a bit. Bbq meats still solid though. Noodles sometimes come out in a bit of a glob. Light on he noddle serving sometimes and others - too much."}
{"text":"This is such a great family restaurant. They are always super friendly with great food. The pho is yummy, grilled pork sandwich rocks and my favorites are the spring and summer rolls."}
{"text":"There are so many good Pho restaurants in Vegas that you actually have many options.  The price has gone down due to competition.  That's said, Pho Bistro has lost its competitive edge.  First, it's located outside the China town.  It's Pho is average.  The broth is OK.  Tripe is uncooked which leaves a raw bitter taste.  The service is spotty.  It offers only one veggie dish: veggie pho. In the evening, the parking in front is a little scary."}
{"text":"This was my first time having pho and while it's nothing crazy or fancy it is satisfying and cheap. The service was quick although the place was a little cold. I had the spicy thing and it had some good kick to it. I think a small would have been enough in reality."}
{"text":"My usual go-to Vietnamese restaurant in the area. 

I usually order the P06 (pho with rare beef and beef balls), the broth is pretty spectacular and meat portions fair. They do give a lot of noodles which some people enjoy - I just ask for less. 

The vermicelli with grilled chicken is also delicious and fulfills my cravings every time. Also comes with lots of noodles - again, not complaining, I just ask for less :)

I've also tried their Tom yum soup, green curry (great kick) and all the rolls they have. 

Delicious food, fast service!"}
{"text":"The soup in this place is great and cheap too; ordered a large (had to take it home).  The restaurant is clean and the washrooms as well.  I will come back again."}
{"text":"This is a great casual and quick spot for lunch or dinner, both under $10. I tried the beef pho, beef stew, and grilled pork banh mi. Everything had really good flavor, the banh mi is on a perfect chewy baguette, and prices are awesome. The baguette was only $3.50 and the pho and stew were each around $8 or $9. The owner was really friendly and funny, joking around about working really hard to slice the banh mi perfectly down the middle. They were also great about providing any extra things we wanted - jalapenos on the banh mi, more bean sprouts and cilantro for the pho. I'm so happy to have found such a good Vietnamese spot on the Eastside!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here on a Wednesday night about 7pm for a late dinner. Strangely we were the only one's there. It's a small place located on the corner of E. Flamingo and Sandhill.
They have 3 booths and 11 tables set up for 4 people. Your typical neighborhood restaurant.

The owner was very friendly and greeted us warmly. As we were choosing booth #1, he suggested we get away from the door more so the cold and wind wouldn't bother us. Promptly brought out waters with lemon. We ordered off the menu with a couple changes, no problem.

Spring rolls were good, with a nice large piece of shrimp, served with peanut sauce. 
The Pho was very tasty, good hearty broth flavor without being salty or oily. Plenty of meat. 

This is the closest pho place to where I live, and since it was pretty tasty at a fair price, I will be back. Good service, clean, and convenient. 4.5 stars!!!!"}
{"text":"Always drove by this place finally took the time to check it out. Employees were extremely nice and took care of us, great customer service! The price of food here is not bad at all, they have lunch special $5.95. Really underestimated this place, has to be one of the top pho places in town!"}
{"text":"absolutely not!!!!  stay away.....was there on 01/07, place an order, git my pho, then all of a sudden......i looked down and saw something float to the top of the bowl.....a damn roach!!!!!!!avoid this establishment!!!!"}
{"text":"The staff could sure benefit from using the pads & pens they are carrying around to actually take people's orders.  Poor execution from beginning to end, don't waste you lunch hour like I did."}
{"text":"It's a good quaint place. The employees are always friendly. Since I live on the east side of town, there isn't very many pho restaurants to eat at. This place does have the better broth than some of the restaurants on the east side. If I could, I would come here during lunch time. It has a great priced lunch specials from 11am-3pm for $5.95."}
{"text":"Quite a disappointment.  If you are a pho lover, you will hate this place.  A ball of noodles topped with tasteless broth and average to poor meat. 

The meal started off well. I ordered the lunch special pho tai and spring rolls.  The rolls ($2.95) had more meat than most places and the sauce seemed to be more hoisin-based rather than peanut-based.  Different than what I expected, but a pleasant surprise.  The lunch special also comes with a small egg drop soup (figured that wouldn't be included since I ordered pho, but it was; a welcome, albeit strange, surprise).  The egg drop soup was also good. Solid egg drop soup with small pieces of carrot and corn added. 

Then the entree came out and my experience took a nose dive. 

Honestly, it's the worst broth I've encountered in Vegas.  When I think of a good bowl of pho, the broth is complex in flavor, and is the star of the dish.  This broth was flat and tasteless.  I'm not sure if it's broth from a packet, or broth that simply didn't get simmered for long enough to develop flavor, but it wasn't good.  It would be more accurate to call it meat water than to refer to it as broth. 

The meat was not as bad as the broth, but still left a lot to be desired. The pho tai (rare beef) had a total of 7 small pieces of beef that, perhaps, were rare at some point, but were not by the time they got to me.  They were somewhat chewy and lacked the flavor you usually get. 

Finally, the noodles...  It seems like this place must put a ball of hard noodles in a bowl, slap some broth on there, throw in some meat and then bring it out immediately.  The noodles were hard and difficult to separate until they had sat for a while.  It's probably just a matter of preference, but I'd rather have waited an extra couple minutes for the food to come out than get the hard ball of noodles that had to sit before eating. 

There are a couple saving graces of this place. First, the prices. The lunch specials are 5.95 and you get an entree, can of pop (Pepsi or diet pepsi), and egg drop soup.  That's a great value.  The spring rolls were also about half the price of other restaurants. And second, the food other than the pho was worthy of a 3 or 4 star rating. 

Unfortunately this place only gets two stars because this is supposed to be a pho restaurant, and the pho was terrible.   Probably won't be back unless I'm desperate."}
{"text":"Tucked in the corner off Sandhill in Las Vegas where anything \"Bistro\" is foreign, there's this little hole in the wall called Pho Bistro. 
Being honest this is far from a Bistro but hey maybe it gets people in the door. 
We sat ourselves immediately in this dark, as clean as could be expected eatery.  
I opted for the Shrimp Pho. Watch out  my fellow Pescatarians this shrimp Pho is made with a beef base broth. Which I was clearly able to taste from the first swallow. This is so not okay to do to people.. 
Anyways for this type of restaurant it's probably as good as it gets. 
4 stars for the beef broth in my shrimp Pho 
I don't see myself returning."}
{"text":"This is small quaint little place to get some tasty, but still very affordable pho. The gentleman (and I'm assuming maybe the owner) who greets,seats, and takes our orders is very friendly, patient, and quick to make recommendations if you have any particular requests (as I heard him do when a lady seated nearby told him she was on a diet). We usually stop in to get an order to-go and the service is always quick, with the food usually taking only about 5-10 minutes.My husband loves their iced coffee with condensed milk and I usually go for their Pho Ga, which is offered with their lunch special ($6.50 with a soda or tea included). If you're ever craving some delicious pho, but are in a budget this is the place to go."}
