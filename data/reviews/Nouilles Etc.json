{"text":"Good chinese food ! Very fast when serving the food in the restaurant."}
{"text":"Ils exigent 2$ pour les frais de livraison

Par contre, ils disent 45 minutes et ils arrivent 45 minutes tapant.

Les raviolis aux arachides sont excellents. Et je suis difficile en matière de sauce aux arachides parfaite. Grosse portion, que dis-je, ÉNORME portion pour le général tao. Le poulet, pas trop noyé dans la sauce, reste encore très croustillants. Ca aussi, c'était très bon. Les portions sont généreuses, on en a pour au moins 3 jours.."}
{"text":"Awesome food everytime I go there, I'm never disapointed about their beef and brocoli, the beef is tender and the brocoli is slightly crunchy. Very good service too. The plates and servings are big as well and the restaurant is clean, they have an open kitchen so you can see what is going on in there."}
{"text":"I can see why locals like this kind of shop. It's spacious, clean, the staff (who are Chinese) all speak French, they give legit receipts, the prices aren't too bad. But when it comes down to the food, I'm afraid to say that it is very much chinese take-out à l'américaine, i.e. everything stir fried together and drenched in soy sauce, which is fine but not to be confounded with Chinese cuisine.

Surprised that I was able to speak Mandarin, the cashier asked me if I lived in the area because there are seemingly few Chinese in this part of Hochelaga. I disappointed him by saying I just dropped an Uber rider next doors and was hungry."}
{"text":"Quiet place to have a quick bite. Right next to the metro, so if you're feeling famished stop on in. The service was quicker than I expected for a mid week lunch time. The food was delicious, just keep in mind that they serve PLENTY! So make sure you go with an empty stomach. Loved their Pad Thai. Nice big plate of hot, filling noodles. I mean honestly, for the price that we paid and the portion delivered, we were blown away. I did see a few people come for pickup, so that seems to be an option but I don't know about delivery. But this is a good and cozy place to grab some Asian cooking. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I never been to this place, but I ordered some delivery today, it took them 90 min to deliver the food. I called back after 60 min to cancel, they didnt even try to retain me. Not customer service at all!!!"}
