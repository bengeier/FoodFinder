{"text":"3 stars, or \"A-Ok\" perfectly describes CJ Lunch Box.  I work in the area and frequent this spot for lunch (as does everyone else in the area I think). The value is hard to beat, for $6 you can get 8 pieces of maki (my preference is red tuna or the tempura shrimp) and a tray of edamame. Miso soup is far from great but it's free so who can complain?  I have had the noodles and spicy chicken before and they are pretty delicious, mind you I felt like garbage a few hours later. The fried dumplings fall into the same category.  The owner CJ is always so friendly and upbeat and they really do their best to get you in and out quickly."}
{"text":"I usually only go here if I'm working in the area. I've never spent more than $8 for lunch and it's filling enough. The sushi might not be the most presentable, but it's pretty fresh and it tastes pretty good, especially when you consider the price.   There's a seemingly overwhelming line between 12-1, but it moves really quickly and the staff are always friendly.  It's a great option if you're looking for something quick and cheap."}
{"text":"Super cheap sushi place.   They have a line-up during lunch hours. You line up, pick your sushi/food and pay at the cashier. You can get 8 pieces of salmon rolls for $4 (including tax). The quality is not that good: you're pretty much getting what you pay for.   CJ Lunch Box is open until 5pm but when you go after 2, they don't really have a lot of options. Also, I think they changed their miso soup price.. I believe it's not free anymore. You have to add a dollar.   Go to this place if you don't really care about quality and just want cheap sushi!"}
{"text":"CJ is a great quick lunch joint. Their \"fast food\" sushi is of reasonable quality considering it is quite cheap. Can't go wrong with shrimp tempura rolls and a miso soup for $4."}
{"text":"Great cheap sushi place. Miso soup is free. 2 rolls, tax in for $10.  Reminds of the corner stores in Vancouver selling good and inexpensive sushi. Deliciousness"}
{"text":"Fast, cheap, fresh sushi! Love it! Don't be intimidated by the line-up, it moves really fast! Staff is friendly and food is fresh. Not the best quality nor the best tasting, but the value is unbeatable!   The salmon they use in the sushi is surprisingly fresh for a small sushi joint and the avocado is always ripe. Almost always the staff will throw in free pieces of yam tempura in the sushi box, a nice touch!   Apparently miso soup is also free with take-out? I've always paid cash so never really noticed if they charge for it.   Two boxes of filling sushi and a cup of miso soup for $8? Yes please!   Cash only under $10, and above that you can use cards."}
{"text":"Best place to grab sushi during your lunch break. Quick service, cheap prices, good quality sushi .. what more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"BBQ eel, avocado, cucumber, sesame, unagi sauce."}
{"text":"This place was THE place to eat if you were one of the many cooped up office folks at Richmond and Spadina when it opened. While the traffic has died down a bit it is still one of the busiest places on the corner.  For service and quick eats, CJ's has it locked. The owner is incredibly sweet and willing to work as many deals as he can into the lunch hour rush. It might be something as small as rounding your meal down to the closest dollar or throwing in free yam tempura but it's always appreciated.  You might not want to stay in and eat because it's just so small inside but if you're doing take out you might wait all of five minutes from line up to cash out. The long cafeteria style counter has a cold, sushi combo and hot section (for noodles, bento-ish trays and spicy fried chicken nuggets that are addictive).  This place would have been a solid 4 stars if it they had better prices but I find I spend the same amount for lunch at CJ as I do at other places and while CJ's food is tasty, it isn't the same quality."}
{"text":"Cute little sushi factory. It seems this is mainly a take out spot, they seemed surprise that I wanted to sit down and eat here.   They showed me the pre-made rolls they had, but I opted for something off the menu which they had no trouble throwing together in under a minute. My yam/avocado roll came up to 5$ with a drink and I was given a pile of yam tempura on top for free!  I will be back. If I wake up on time again. I suggest coming early- I can tell this place turns into a zoo around noon."}
{"text":"Super cheap lunch.  Little sushi containers like Bento Nouveau but it's all made fresh that morning so you're in and out quick.  Comes with miso soup.  It's like sushi fast food!"}
{"text":"Cheap, fresh and fast is how I like my lunch, and CJ doesn't disappoint.  They're friendly and helpful, and there is a great variety of sushi, mostly maki rolls.  My staple is salmon/avocado rolls with veggie dumplings, and wakami salad, and a complimentary miso soup.  Sometimes I'll get the veggie noodles or the tempura shrimp maki rolls.  They also cater !"}
{"text":"I just got back from the place......  While waiting for my lunch to be ready,  I saw the fry cook put freshly cooked dumplings into my container, drop one, pick it up of the floor and put it into container with the rest...not cool lunch box not cool.  I complained and they swapped out for another container of dumplings.    I'm not sure I am that comfortable with the 5 sec rule applying at a sushi restaurant, however cheap it may be."}
{"text":"I've been in the neighbourhood a lot recently and I ran into this place somewhat randomly a few months ago and now it's one of my go-to places. It's not your standard sushi place. It's a fast-moving serve-yourself sushi joint with decent, but not great, sushi served in little plastic boxes which most people take out. I believe they do custom orders, but mostly I just go and grab a box or three of some of their goodies in little fridges in front of the line. I always tend to over-order when I'm here, so be careful."}
{"text":"Good and quick but not great sushi. Very cheap and cheerful sushi in a prime location - ask about the daily special and don't forget your free miso!"}
{"text":"Absolutely nowhere else in this area can you find a cheaper and more filling lunch. For $6.95 I got a maki roll (veggie) and gyoza or potstickers (its all the same people..) with fried sweet potato. I ran out of my office (a block away) at 11:45 to beat the lunch rush and made it! I was in and out in 5 minutes. The times I have been here with the line out the door is still impressive as they MOVE fast. You can, of course, not chose the pre made options but there are honestly so many I can't imagine me ever doing so. And they don't just have prepackaged (but made fresh) sushi, but also salads and hot entree's."}
{"text":"Cheap and cheerful sushi joint, set up mainly for takeout, with a few tables. Can't say the sushi is especially memorable - a bit mushy, like most cheap sushi - but the vegetarian gyoza were very good. Staff are super-friendly.  But in the end... aside from the fast service, how different is this place really from the hundreds of others cheap sushi peddlers in town?"}
{"text":"This place is extremely busy during office lunch hour. They're fast, convenient and tastes pretty fresh.   Then again, I wouldn't frequent CJs if I didn't work in the area. A common complaint is that their sushi rolls fall apart very easily and that the complimentary miso soup is too bland.   The spicy tuna rolls are covered in hot mayo and you can request extra on the side. The lunch box prices vary from $8 to $10+ so for those who are always like me, would be spending almost $20 for 2-3 lunch boxes. I suggest that they make a lunch box that contains more than 8 rolls.   The front patio has a great view of people bustling about on Spadina and is mostly packed during a warm day.   Overall CJs is A-OK. They could certainly improve in quality and more variety though."}
{"text":"1. best avacado/cucumber sushi ever! so fresh! tofu inari is also amazing! 2. free miso soup 3. cheap!!!!! 4. only open on weekdays for lunch  5. fast and friendly service... CJ, the owner, is awesome!!! 6. take out or eat-in! 7. vegan friendly... lots of vegan options :)"}
{"text":"This used to be my lunch spot until I decided to go a bit healthier and cut out the sodium form my diet (soy sauce is the devil!). I actually went back today so I figured I would throw out a review.   The restaurant is extremely busy always and forever (unless you get lunch at 11:30 or 2:30). Often times you will be waiting outside the restaurant. With that said, they are also extremely fast. So although it looks like you'll be in line for an hour, you'll only be in line for 15-20 minutes.   This is fast food sushi. Do not expect much in the way of quality. I think people go for the experience - picking your sushi from the cooler and getting all the free goodies (spicy mayo, miso soup, tempura sauce), the staff are beyond helpful and friendly (I think the owners work the til), and it's cheap!  The Good:  1. Staff. Friendly and always willing to assist or make you what you want the way you want.  2. Price. It's very inexpensive and worth the price.   The Bad:  1. Size. It's just a lunch place so it's very small and very limited seating. Even if you manage to snag a seat, you will be getting bumped by the huge line RIGHT next to you.  2. Quality. The sushi is OK but it falls apart. It's fast food sushi.  3. Lines. Always always huge lines.   Recommendation: go at 11:30 or 2:30 for your lunch and do not go here in between if you are in a hurry!"}
{"text":"Cheap sushi. No frills. Lunch only. I wish they opened for dinner. Is this place a front? Lol!  I once found a fish scale in a salmon sushi though. No big deal. I haven't gotten sick from here yet."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times now and I really enjoyed it. Though the sushi may not be the best I've ever had, the price is definitely unbeatable. It's less than $4 for 8 pieces! If you come during lunch hour, be prepared to wait in line. It does moves fairly fast though, so you can still be in and out of there fairly quickly. Miso soup is included for free as part of any order and they also give out cups of spicy mayo with no additional charge.  Another thing I liked was that they offer both cherry and vanilla coke in cans. As a lover of cherry coke, I highly approve! Since I work in the area, I will definitely be frequenting this place for many lunch hours to come."}
{"text":"Super quick, super cheap. Probably cheapest sushi in downtown Toronto, if not in all of Toronto. It's perfect if you're at work and looking for a quick bite. Place is small, people normally go here for takeouts."}
{"text":"The sushi here is unbelievably cheap and quick. $4 will get you 8 pieces of sushi in a variety of forms (including dynamite rolls, sweet potato rolls, and California rolls). You can upgrade with some gyoza or help yourself to some complimentary miso soup.  While I can't say the food here is particularly delicious, it does the job when you're on a budget.   This place is always busy during lunch hours. The wait will only be a few minutes though since everything is pre-made and packed in easy-to-take-out plastic ware."}
{"text":"If given the option, I'd give CJ Lunch Box 3.5 stars. Is it cheap? Yes. Is it fast? Yes. Is it healthier than most other options in this price range in the area? Absolutely. Do you see God when you take your first bite? Nope. But for $5-$10, I'd say it's worth it.   I had long been intimidated by the lunch-line of business-types, but decided it was finally time to try it out. The line curled around through the restaurant, which was fine by me because I wanted to peruse the options. I grabbed a container of the red tuna topped with sesame seeds and accompanied by pickled ginger, a lemon slice and wasabi. If you're a germaphobe, steer clear of the free miso, which is self-serve and left uncovered. I went for it, and it was great - not overly salty and piping hot.  The sushi was decent and matched the price. The service was friendly and brisk. The lunch crowd is civil. This will be my go-to option for very cheap sushi when I have a craving but don't want to seriously indulge."}
{"text":"Having grown up in Metro-Detroit, I've been to Toronto quite a few times.  Here for a conference, I hopped over here for a late lunch.    I DO NOT regret it.  Delicious, and inexpensive, but not short on flavor and flair.  Very friendly and conversational staff.  The special was an 8pc shrimp tempura roll and about 8 dumplings.  This filling lunch was about $6.    If you're looking for inexpensive but still tasty, seek no further!"}
{"text":"This is the ultimate place to get a scrumptious sushi fix! Although it is packed at lunch, the line moves very quickly, especially if you go around 1pm.   Today, I shared a box of edamame, salmon roll (8pc), california roll (8pc) and a box of fried dumplings with my mom. In total, the meal was just $13! It also comes with miso soup (warning: it tastes like high sodium water...but heck, it's free!)."}
{"text":"It's not cheap at all. You have to buy at least two boxes for a meal, which is 14 dollar after tax. And the sushi is at poor quality. I don't understand why so many people go there. Did I miss anything?"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a nice, quiet, easy-going place to sit down and enjoy a lunch of sushi, edamame, and miso soup, this is not the place for you.  C&J Lunchbox is a fast-paced, super busy, sushi-churning factory.  At any given point, you'll find at least a half a dozen employees running around, prepping sushi rolls, packaging chicken bites, and deep frying dumplings.  The service is quick, and the people are really friendly, but the food is largely hit and miss.  However, it's also dirt cheap and incredibly filling, so it's a definite hot spot for the lunchtime crowd around Queen/Spadina.  I can't speak to the quality of the sushi - I don't eat the stuff.  However, I have had their chicken bites, various noodles, dumplings, and edamame beans over the course of the few years they have been in business.  Some days, the food is fantastic and I enjoy every bite.  Some days everything is a little dull and without much character, but what do you expect when you can get two or three fully-stuffed trays of food for under $7.  Even if I find one day to be particularly unmemorable, I tend to go back because the price can't be beat for the amount of food you get.  The restaurant is a lot quieter after 1:30 or so, but the selection also begins to wane, so go early.  You may not get a place to sit down, but you'll get the food at its freshest, and hopefully end up getting exactly what you came in for."}
{"text":"A decent, no frills sushi joint in the Entertainment District. I wouldn't say it's super cheap nor super delicious but it sure hits the spot. Lunch rush is no joke but the line moves fast. A few seats but it's more of a grab-and-go establishment.   2 boxes of sushi for $9.50.  Not bad, not bad."}
{"text":"Not the biggest rolls, or the largest selection. But other than that this place is aces. Don't let the lunch line fool you, you will not be in it for long.This place runs like a Swiss watch. Super efficient & friendly staff. And despite the demand they never run out of anything. If I had CJ running all aspects of my life I could become the Titan of Industry I have always dreamed of! Lookout world, here comes CJ & D!   ****"}
{"text":"Banal sushi checkout line. Staff is friendly, but going there feels like being in a factory lunchroom. It's cheap, at least. You're not going to dream of their rolls outside of work hours. Perfect place if you've given up on lunch variety."}
{"text":"Not bad for a small sushi place and will return to try other items.   Food: 3/5, we got the tuna, dynamite rolls ,salmon nigiri and noodles.  You can however see that they were not the freshest .  Service: 3/5, no service since it's self serve.  Ambience: 3/5 it gets quite busy with people doing take out so not best but seating.  Price: 3/5, about $25 for two people."}
{"text":"This place is perfect for quick grab & go sushi experience. Don't go there expecting a fine dining experience. This restaurant is perfect for the neighborhood - busy professionals looking for somewhat healthy and quick lunch. In that department, this restaurant absolutely delivers. Staff is always extremely nice and while lines can be intimidating, they move really fast."}
{"text":"Fresh,  cheap and so damn fast. Great place if you need to eat quick. Similar quality to a lot of sushi places in the area but cheaper and mostly take out. Great service.  Love these guys."}
{"text":"I went here with a friend and ordered the spicy chicken and let me tell you, it was perfection. I wish it came in a bigger size because I was finished in 5 minutes and wishing I had enough money for seconds.   Try to come before or after lunch time because there's always a lunch rush and there's limited seating."}
{"text":"Order through Ritual app.   Super quick. Solid for cheap lunch sushi.   Spicy salmon was good (though I mostly tasted the spicy mayo over anything else.)   Small portion sizes."}
{"text":"The rice is dry and the fish isn't fresh which all that matters and miso soup was very plain. Definitely not enough miso paste for larger portion of water. I don't know why this place is so popular. I won't go back. It's expensive for what it is. They provide the Same quality sushi as those AYCE restaurants do.  I had two boxes of sushi and it cost me already $17 with miso soup, when I can just go to AYCE around the corner and eat as much as I eat the same quality sushi. Aw well. Never again."}
{"text":"Extremely flavourful, fresh and affordable sushi! If you're in a rush you can just grab and go or have them make something made in front of you. I will definitely make this a go to spot for lunch."}
{"text":"For cheap eats of sushi, CJ Lunch Box owns the title. The staff is incredibly friendly and accommodating; the food is fresh, and you can order something quickly and painlessly if it's not available to be picked up pre-prepared during the lunch time rush.  The only downside is it's no open on the weekends for a quick bite when we're downtown!"}
{"text":"I literally stopped because of the long line of hungry people picking up boxes and shoving money at the cashier. The concept is simple. You pick up boxes of prepared sushi, gyoza, and seaweed salad from the open cabinet. There are cold drinks in the fridge or you can scoop up some miso soup as you wait in line. You pay (~$5 for a maki, ~8 for sushi) the cashier by the door and walk out with a good lunch in hand.   The maki itself is heavy on the rice but there is enough of fish and avocado to make it delicious. The rice is soft and well seasoned, so it makes for a filling meal. Good option for a simple weekday lunch on the run!"}
{"text":"#LUNCHTORONTO #LUNCHBOX #SUSHITORONTO #YELPTO  I am a huge fan of decent sushi for the price. I pay $5 for a set of salmon-avocado rolls (8 small pieces) and a miso soup. I think the miso is free. It's grab and go; they have a small patio if you want to sit there and eat but I haven't seen too many people making use of it.   Because it is ready-to-go sushi in bunkers, even with a crowd in there, you're looking to wait max 8-10 minutes.   ANKIE TIP: If you want a chopstick, little bowl or napkins, grab them after you pay because the staff won't put it in the bag for you. I often forget and end up chopstick or napkin less.   Knocked off a star because the edamame isn't too great."}
{"text":"Today I needed a quick but filling lunch before I headed to a volunteer meeting downtown. I was able to order from CJ with my RITUAL APP (promo code $10 with CHRISTEN7181 for first time users) with 30mins before they closed. I ordered ahead and then I started walking from St. Andrews subway station. When I got there it was an easy pick-up.   So the food: honestly you get what you pay for. Their maki rolls are simple, not very big (but enough for a young Asian female). The costs is also decent (hence their smaller rolls). It tastes pretty fresh too.   This place is good for a quick and easy fix.   I ordered the spicy salmon roll (8 pieces) for $3.99."}
{"text":"There's something to be said about having the option to eat somewhere decent without breaking the bank account. Ju took me to one of her favourite quick, cheap sushi takeout joints. Although, we ended up sitting outside on their little patio which I thought was great! Perfect downtown people watching spot.  - Spicy red tuna and half shrimp/half avocado ($5.00 each) - I don't think you could get sushi any cheaper. Don't expect the best sushi but these will do if you're hungry and want something to fill you up. I tried one of the spicy red tuna rolls and it was decent. That about sums it up perfectly.  Great value for the price. I'd eat this over anything you'd get at a grocery store. Solid grab and go spot for a quick and easy meal."}
{"text":"Reasonably priced sushi, decent quality, fast... you won't find a quicker sushi lunch in the city. Even if you went and got the prepackaged stuff from loblaws it might take you longer because it's a bigger place to walk through...... The stuff flies off the shelf really quickly here, so even though its all packaged stuff its probably freshly made and the fish is probably pretty fresh.  The chicken is pretty decent and a good side to have with some sushi to make sure you are feeling full. Some of the salmon/avocado rolls, or the packs with just salmon sushi are the ones that can go quickly.  Every purchase comes with a free miso soup. Its definitely not the best miso soup in the world, as its pretty watered down. But if you just want a hot drink to go with your sushi it hits the spot. Its definitely become one of my go to lunch spots as Im currently just working across the street."}
{"text":"Cheap lunch to go. Great place for quick sushi and other things. Would definitely come back here. The food is obviously not the best, the sushi is machine rolled.   If you are in a rush. This place is good for their speed."}
{"text":"CJs is always always busy during lunch time. And I finally see why. For just a c hole of dollars, you can be sure to satisfy your sushi cravings with plenty of options. The sushi flies off the shelf and is constantly replenished so you know the fish is always fresh.  The spicy chicken is also a great filler option if a couple of rolls isnt enough.  They also give free miso soup and spicy mayo for your sushi rolls if you ask for it. More than the great food at a great price, the owner of the place is a short Asian man who is always at the cashier, and he's the nicest guys. Greets everyone that comes in with a smile. It's service that like that keeps you coming back."}
{"text":"A cheap place to eat at lunch. Fresh sushi rolls made to go almost infront of your eyes. It's always busy but the line moves fast. I think their sesame chicken is their signature menu item. Bite sized pieces of chicken tossed in a sweet and sour sauce and garnished with sesame seeds. The average price for an eight piece sushi tray is around $4....besides MCDonalds this is the best deal around Richmond street. Once I went it around 6pm and grabbed a tray to go and the cashier took it from me and had the kitchen make me a fresh tray. That made me feel happy."}
{"text":"For the most part, everything is made to order. They have pre packaged items to those in a rush. If not, you can always space the 5 minute wait for fresh cut sashimi.  Really inexpensive which probably explained why it's sooooooooo super busy during lunch time."}
{"text":"Ordering through the Ritual app \"speeds\" up the wait time - in the sense you only need to go when your order is almost ready.   The sushi is definitely fast-food sushi, but it's great value for the price. It's good, but not excellent. Wait for the fresh rolls, they are better.   Recommended: Volcano Roll, Spicy Salmon."}
{"text":"As the name implies, this place is open for lunch only...and boy do they do a brisk business in just 3 hours!  Lineup can be long between 12-1pm but it moves surprisingly fast since they have the throughput thing down to a science.  Working nearby, I get take-out at least once per week.  Everything is fresh...never been disappointed. Favourite is the tempura shrimp & avocado california rolls but the sashimi, maki rolls and sushi are great too.  When I've O.D'd on sushi, they have a tasty spicy chicken.   Price is very reasonable for the amount of food.  $8.60 gets me two containers and a soup which fills me up. Compare that to other lunch option in this hood that come in at $10+ and I still have almost enough change from my ten-spot for a coffee later in the afternoon."}
{"text":"Pros: - Great value. Lots of for the price - Fast service - Friendly staff - Free miso soup!  Cons: - None  Conclusion: This is a great spot for a quick and cheap lunch. Most rolls and mains are between $4-$5 dollars. Nothing in particular is outstanding but with a deal this good, you can't really go wrong. I would recommend CJ's"}
{"text":"CJ Lunch Box is what I would call a sushi dive bar. There is much left to be desired from the decor, but the food is cheap and the service is cheerful. The frankly unappetizing and limited overhead menu makes ordering somewhat confusing. There are no descriptions or photos of arbitrarily named maki and combos. From the way that the very friendly lady behind the counter greeted me and asked me what I was having in the same breath, I figured that this place was frequented by nearby office workers who probably know what they like and have the same thing daily. This was pretty much confirmed when a young girl who looked very much like a fashion intern came in and ordered six California rolls to go.  For a little more than a fiver, I was able to afford the daily special of a shrimp tempura roll and fried-to-order veggie gyoza. I watched news headlines scroll across the muted flat screen while waiting for my food and was pleasantly surprised to have it served to me with a big smile. There were many more dumplings than I had expected and even a few bonus yam tempura pieces thrown in for good measure. The food wasn't the best, but it filled me right up and was a steal of a deal on a day when I had forgotten my wallet at home and was starving with only a pocketful of borrowed change. Although the table was less than spotless, the large windows provided lots of natural light and a decent people watching vantage point.  I found it quite strange and rather depressing that all of the hot trays and refrigerated section were empty. Since the first thing on the menu are the groceries, it would probably only boost sales if CJ displayed some of those fish and specialty Japanese ingredients out front alongside ready made sushi boxes."}
{"text":"If you want affordable sushi that tastes good, CJ Lunch Box is the place to be. Don't be fooled by it's exterior! The good stuff is on the inside.  Everything is made fresh everyday by a great staff and if you get there early enough they even have salmon nigiri sushi (and if you get there really early enough, sometimes they add in extra pieces of sashimi)! usually though I get the salmon roll plus the FREE miso soup and it comes up to like $4 for eight pieces or something ridiculous. The nigiri might be a bit more expensive but it's still pretty good for fast food sushi.  It has come to a point where after working late nights/all nighters at the studio that I think it's okay to have sushi and coffee for breakfast because it just tastes so good and is really affordable.  Their hours are kinda wonky though. They usually close whenever their food for the day runs out so it varies and all the good stuff goes pretty fast. I'd say good luck trying to find any salmon rolls after 2 or 3pm.  Really though, I never thought I'd ever eat sushi for breakfast until I found this place."}
{"text":"The price is good and you can be in and out of there surprisingly quick. In fact, there was a long line there and no line at the pizza place next door and I still beat my friend in speed. The staff there is very efficient and nice.   That being said, the food itself is only ok. It is by no means bad, but it is not exactly amazing either and I paid $19 for three items. I was not even sure what they were when I got them, they only seem to label half of their items.   Perhaps if they had a better labeling system / pricing system that you can see while you are in the long line, I would rate this place higher. So if you are a regular, you would probably be more fine with that but as a noob, I did not enjoy that part very much."}
{"text":"Cheap, decent and good for the price. This place is only opened for lunch and it gets super busy here. Free miso soup, sushi is already made to grab and go and you basically line up for it. Rolls are around $4.50 - $6 per roll (8pieces). It hits the spot for a quick and decent lunch."}
{"text":"A long time ago, when i first entered Waterloo as a first year student, there was a sushi house near the school called \"Mr. Sushi\" and the food was cheap and good and the payment was \"honour system\" where you just go to the unguarded cash register and pay your own bill. A year later, this extremely successfully sushi joint was sold to someone else and the glory days were over. Another year later, a place called Charlie's Lunch Box opened in a different plaza - the cheap sushi and lunch bentos were a hit and about a year or two later, the place was sold and the glory again ended.  Fast forward 4 years later, this rumoured same owner opened a place in Toronto named CJs lunchbox - also cheap sushi, but I was pretty disappointed. Yes the sushi is cheap - about $4 per roll, all pre-made and placed in little boxes at the front. The prices are good for what you get, but the experience was just not the same anymore.  The menu is very small (no spicy mayonniase) and miso soup now cost $1. Did Mr. Charlie sell this place again?"}
{"text":"Used to work minutes away and came here about every 2 weeks or so. Always ended satisfied and the staff were very friendly. Would have given 4 stars, but they didn't take credit card (not sure if they do now or not) and I'm disappointed to hear that they now charge a buck for the miso soup. Not that it was anything spectacular (in fact, it was pretty watery), but it was such a bonus to my $8 sushi+gyoza+miso soup meal that just can't be beat. Sure, the quality isn't that of Tsukiji market, but it filled my belly nicely. Also would have been better if they took Visa. Haven't been there in a couple years, will have to try it again."}
{"text":"This place is meant to just grab and go which is awesome during lunch hours. Often times during lunch you can expect to wait 5-10 minutes in line, so I recommend using ritual to order beforehand. It is very small and seating is pretty limited.  I go here when I'm not too hungry but craving sushi. It's great if you want to buy 1-2 rolls but after that it's just not worth it. If you're spending 10$+ there you might as well pick other sushi restaurants around. I don't think it's worth it after that amount since the boxes aren't super big. The rolls are usually fresh and taste more authentic than grocery store places. The sweet and sour chicken, salmon avocado roll and spicy salmon roll are my favourite, Makes a great snack."}
{"text":"I got a free lunch using Ritual app. I like it here because it is close to Scotiabank theatre. The sushi is just OK quality, not over the top, but worth the price. This place is good and cheap for fast food sushi. The place is small. I ordered spicy salmon sushi which I really like. The veggie dumplings are not bad. I would probably eat here for quick bite before going to movie on Tuesday.  Recommend: Veggie dumplings (it has sweet potato fries), spicy salmon sushi Not Recommend: Udon"}
{"text":"CJ Lunch Box is super sweet, cheap and cheerful.  You walk in, get in line, grab your stuff and get out. You can stuff yourself for under $8 easily, and likely your friend, too. There are a couple of tables in the corner, but I never see anyone sitting there. This place is totally take-out.   Their gyozas are great, and their rolls are decent. I never go for sashimi here because I'm skeptical at this price point, but I've seen others slurp up their raw fish happily many times.  PEPPER PLEADS: Cover up the miso soup. It just seems like a germ trap when it's both self serve and uncovered, CJ."}
