{"text":"Had the beef patty and it was very good and definitely fresh. Just one warning they are very hot because they are just baked but they're amazing will be going back again for sure."}
{"text":"Still on the hunt for the perfect patty...however this makes a quality patty. 

Read the reviews on Yelp and was excited, so I got two baked boxes of patties.  The pastry is fantastic and the filling actually looks like ground beef which is a plus!  However I love my spice and these patties just don't have any kick.  If these patties had a good kick they would be the perfect patty. 

I would recommend this place however keep in mind that the patties are not spicy at all."}
{"text":"Best beef patties in Scarborough! Almost exactly like Randy's. The patty is filled with the right amount of beef ... but be warned! The beef filling is really hot so take your time! Lol"}
{"text":"Hands down the best patties I've ever had.  Extremely hot (temperature wise) so definitely let it cool down a bit before your first bite. Crust is perfectly cooked. Not too hard and crumbly just right.  Filling is amazing. Perfect spice level and super flavourful and juicy.  I've Only tried the beef so far but will update this once I've tried chicken and their other offerings."}
{"text":"I found this place on Yelp and had to try it since it was a lot closer to me than Randy's.  Boy I was not disappointed.  The patties here are amazing.  I don't know if it is better than Randy's, but they are comparable in deliciousness.  This is a no-frills kind of place with great patties that will keep you coming back."}
{"text":"I will start my review by saying that I grew up in Scarborough and therefore grew up eating patties. Those who grew up in the area will remember Warden Station. I also was fortunate to go to grade school close to Star Wars Burgers whose patties were memories I will never forget as a kid. 

With this days gone I have always been on a search for a really good patty place that would take me back to those days. I would agree with some other comments I seen here that Randy's and Allen pastries is my favourites...well...should I say they were until I tried Patty Time. 

I found this place through recommendations and reviews I read on this site and I can't thank everyone enough. These patties are incredible to put into a word. The crust is flatly and thin with delicious flavouring. The patties are abundantly full with real meat (not paste) in a gravy that has the right balance of spicy and savoury. I honestly could not stop commenting to myself about the delicious taste as I ate 2 and then went back to buy a box. 

I will not be going anywhere else and I feel my search has ended to find the perfect patty that reminds we of growing up in Scarborough. 

I highly recommend...guarantee you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Went in the other day to get a patty on a bun. They couldn't even slice the bun open. Guess they wanted me to do it with my fingers, which I did  .."}
{"text":"Best patties! First time trying them and it is worth the drive there. Flaky crust and generous mouth watering filling. Both the beef and chicken are amazing!"}
{"text":"OMG. The beef patty here was SO good! I came here based on Yelp reviews. They have a simple menu. Chicken or Beef patties. No spice level. They are all the same. I would classify it as inbetween spicy and Mild. I agree with a previous review that it needs a kick but they have hot sauce on the table if you want it that bad. I ordered a dozen frozen to take home! I am sitting in the parking lot right now debating if I should get another but I am trying to resist. 

1= $1.75
12= $1.20 each

CASH ONLY$$$$$$$ No Debit or Credit"}
{"text":"Tried the patty here, was okay but not amazing like the other reviews said. The filling inside was full but only in the center of the patty, the outer crust of the patty didn't have much filling. Michideans patty wins over this, cheaper pricing per patty and taste wise. Too bad they had to recall a batch of their patties due to e coli scare.."}
{"text":"As a Jamaican I've tried multiple,  probably all patty's available in Toronto. Frozen, bakery fresh, you name it. I thought randy's patty was the best then allan's. But I was wrong and I'm glad I'm wrong cuz I stumbled upon this joint on Lawrence in between brimley and mccowan. In all fairness without being bias in any way, PATTY TIME had the best patty in Toronto in my opinion. I'm from Jamaica so I've had the real deal of patty's but patty time brings me back to Jamaica. Crust is light and flaky with perfect texture and taste, the filling is absolutely flavorful and they aint cheap with the filling, you get a lot of flavorful filling and it's real meat, not that dark paste bullshit garbage that patty king, tastee and the rest offer. So my new top 3 patty in Toronto is 1. Patty Time, 2. Randy's patty and 3. Allan's patty. 
Note: I live 10 mins from the allan's bakery on Kennedy in Scarborough and I drive all the way to Patty Time at brimley and Lawrence for my patty fix. It's that damn good. Dozen frozen $13.95 no tax, dozen not frozen $14.95 no tax. A bit more pricey than the competition because they are better than the competition, nuff said."}
{"text":"2nd time trying this place beef patties were best I ever had. Tonight wanted Jerk Chicken but they had none  left so I opted for chicken  patties..they were o k but the beef was better."}
{"text":"Great beef patties, flavour is amazing and there's a small kick from the spices.  This would've gotten a solid 5 if my patties had a little more filling in it.  Had to grab 2 because one just ain't enough :)"}
{"text":"Come all the way from Aurora to get these patties!! Cash only so don't come with your debt card!!"}
{"text":"great price and amazing patty
reminds me of the islands"}
{"text":"There are articles and people's opinions thinking Randy's Patties are #1 in Toronto, but Patty Time is THE best patty I've ever had.

Recommended to my by a Chinese Jamaican friend who has had all kinds of Patties in Jamaica and here in Toronto. Apparently, Patty Time's owner is Randy's owner's father. I've had Patty Time's patty before I had Randy's and I must say, PT is hands down THE best patties I've had. Spicy and mild.

The location is at Lawrence and Brimley. They dedicate the store to patties. The back of the store has Patty masters working away for hours generating warm, fresh and delicious patties in huge ovens (you can peak when ordering fresh patties). They offer frozen and warm patties.

They sell individually and in dozens."}
{"text":"Hole in the wall store in a strip mall with bars on the windows. Interior is stark and menu is limited but don't let that dissuade you from trying their fresh, in house baked, savoury patties.

You have the choice of beef or chicken (red dot), hot or warm. A dozen half beef and half chicken hot, of course, and one coco bread to go please. 

The coco bread was soft but had a tough exterior and was a little anemic looking. Both patties, beef and chicken, had nice flaky crusts with delicious fillings. Other patties have fillings that are over processed and look more like paste or have gelatinous fillings to add bulk but these have a nice texture and mouth feel, you can tell they're made fresh in house. 

So glad I've found a good Jamaican patty place closer to home. Patties make a good on the run snack; you can also bring a dozen or so to group gatherings. This will be my go to Jamaican patty place, but for more spicy patties or if I want goat patties or rum cake (regular or chocolate), I'll still head on over to Allen's on Kennedy Road."}
{"text":"I always thought Randy's was the best in the city but a friend told me to try Patty Time. I'm so happy I tried their patties, Patty Time is the BEST!!! Delicious."}
{"text":"Best beef & chicken patties you will ever!
Soooo good! 
Chicken patties are filled with real curry! But they go fast!
Beef are also really good!

I also like to buy them frozen and make them at home as a treat / snack time to time."}
{"text":"This place on Lawrence Ave East has better patties than I've found in Jamaica. So flaky, moist and delicious. Next time, in going to get them frozen so I can bring them home.  Bomb.com!!!"}
{"text":"Went to patty today around 6pm, didnt realize they only took cash and had spoken to one of the ladies and requested a half dozen. She said she only had cold left and would warm them for me while I went to withdraw cash and asked me \"your gonna come back right?\" Told her id be back quickly and came back within 5 minutes, door was locked and she looked at me and said \"finished\" and gestured me to leave. What a shame because their patties are great but this instance of customer service was disappointing."}
{"text":"These patties are good.  The crust is flaky, thin, and there's a good amount of filling. The beef ones were better than the chicken ones I found.  I thought that the filling was a bit too liquidy as a well but maybe it was just too hot when I bit into it.  All same levels of spice. The ones with the red dot are the chicken patties.  You can buy them individually or by the half dozen or dozen. I usually freeze them at home when I buy a dozen.  You can also mix beef and chicken. Good service as well.

I tend to prefer a thicker crust, but that's just my opinion. I've been on the search for the best patty in the city, and I have yet to find one better than at Warden Station--although Randy's comes pretty close."}
{"text":"Okay, I've had parties all my life....from the local convenience store ones to subway stations and to the local patty shops...  Spicy, non spicy, beef, chicken, goat heck even vegetarian (which by the way shouldn't be a patty if there isn't any meat in it!), I've had pretty much all of them.

Because patties are such an individual preference the top 3 in my books were Randy's, Allan's and Michidean's.  For those who don't know, basically all the Jamaican patty joints are owned by Chinese Jamaican and they all have some sort of relation to each other as it's a small knit community.   They each have a different spin on how they do patties. However after today I got myself a new favourite.....

Patty Time is located in a little run down plaza on Lawrence near Brimley so don't let the area discourage you.  They have ready to serve individual as well as boxed precooked and uncooked patties.  They also serve some combo meals such as curry goat, oxtail and jerk chicken.  This review however is for the traditional cooked and ready to serve beef patties.

Patty Time patties are fat, fat patties!  There is a ton of saucy ground beef with an excellent spicy and savoury combination.  However be aware that it comes out extremely hot, if you try to wolf it down like I did you will burn yourself so be warned! The shell itself is extremely thin so you can kinda say that they are almost a low carb patty!  Patties are made in store and fresh.

I can't believe after all this time I've never had Patty Time patties... I feel that I have a lot of catching up to do so \"I'll take 5 dozen patties to go please!\""}
{"text":"These patties were so fresh and moist, they definitely do not cheap out on the gravy here. I was fortunate to have come at a slower time and just picked up a couple to try, but you also have an option to buy in bulk, which will be what I go for next time. The pastry was nice and flakey, cooked to perfection. 

They have a couple of tables, but it's mainly a take out place. The decor is nothing to write home about, but don't judge until you sink your teeth into one of those juicy, flakey patties. They'll have you coming back for more!"}
{"text":"Take my coworkers here all the time, and they are continually amazed. 

Best Patties (flakey, and beef has a nice gravy). They are always surprised its not the pasty/gummy meat they usually get in frozen patties. Wasn't a fan of the crab and shrimp (seafood) patty though. But Beef is da Bomb

Patty and Cocobread = Best Lunch."}
{"text":"Seeing that Patty Time is so close to work and it has raving 5-star reviews, I have got to try this place out! My boyfriend initially thought it was located in the Bombay Bazaar strip mall but it's actually a tiny plaza just east of it, right next to a hair salon named Conrad's. 

Food:
Curry goat: 3 stars
Patty: 4.5 stars
Mainly came here for the patties but after looking through their menu, I was on the fence about the curry goat and the oxtail. I decided on the curry goat and I was not disappointed with my choice. The meat was firm and gamy, and usually came with a piece of bone so be careful not to chip a tooth. There may be some small shattered pieces of bone in the rice as well, so don't be scarfing it down too fast. There was a good portion of meat, but wish there was more corn and tomatoes; I literally got one slice of tomato. The rice could have more beans and be more flavourful, but there definitely was a lot of it so no worries about it not being filling enough. 
The patties here are really delicious! Probably one of the best I have ever had. Piping hot with a good amount of filling. It's mildly spicy and you can see that there's ground beef in it and not just some brown paste that tastes like beef. The only little thing that cost it 0.5 stars is that the patties are a tidbit small. Will definitely be back for more when I'm having a craving though!

Ambiance: 2.5 stars
It's a small take-out shop. It's a little decrepit and simple to no decor. It's selling point is mainly its homemade Caribbean food. Parking wasn't too much of an issue. The plaza is very small but other than Conrad's and Patty Time, there isn't much else going on there. 

Service: 3 stars
It's take-out, but the ladies at the counter were nice enough. Service was quick even though the place was pretty busy on a Saturday afternoon."}
{"text":"A nice sunny afternoon...

The sound of Reggae music in the air...

A few of those muscle car in the parking lot...

I feel like I am in Jamaica....

Patty Time is located in a strip mall in Scarborough... One of those I don't frequent.... 

Chicken, Beef or Seafood Patties?? Or should I go for a full meal of Oxtail...or just have a coco bread...

The smell of baked pastries... must be from the flaky outer shell of the patties..

Beef Patty ($1.29) is as flaky as I think it should be... the filling does have some kick to it... but I don't think they have a non spicy version.... 

Maybe I need to wash it down with a red stripe.... oh I am not in Jamaica.. cannot drink in the parking lot................."}
{"text":"I've had a lot of patties in my life and nothing comes close to Patty Time. Hands down. Best patties I have ever had and for a really good price. I haven't tried any of the other things on the menu yet but the patties are for sure delicious!"}
