{"text":"I wanted a rice, chicken and veggie bowl but the only sauce choice was Teriayki (not my fav).  I ordered anyway.  Then when I was waiting for my food, I read the ingredients on the Teryaki bottle on the counter which has High Fructose Corn Syrup.  Darn it!  When I got my food, it was a good amount of chicken, rice and veggies but the veggies were not seasoned at all and the broccoli seemed past its prime (some florets were yellow). On the plus side, it seemed clean and was pretty fast.  But I'll spend my counter service dollars somewhere else."}
{"text":"Got the spicy tuna roll, spicy California roll and the crunch  roll. Didn't like any of them and I'm an avid sushi goer. Super disappointed. The rolls were warm and fell apart when picked up."}
{"text":"I was first introduced to Yogi's Grill a few weeks ago, we stopped by the one at Ray and Loop 101... I loved the food, it tasted clean... the natural flavors of the food were there and the teriyaki sauce was not too strong. The rice was cook wonderfully and the California Roll was delicious.

After that, I was hooked... my wife and I found out there was a Yogi's closer to home, this one was at Ocotillo and Arizona Ave. We had a craving for some Yogi's tonight so we called in our order and picked it up.

I ordered the Beef and Chicken Combo Bowl (comes with rice and vegetables), my wife ordered the Chicken Katsu Plate (comes with rice and salad)... we picked up a California roll fo my 2-year old (plus we wanted a couple of pieces too).

My wife wasn't impressed, and she was not disappointed... her dinner was OK but she had very, very little salad compared to Ray & 101 location. My daughter loved her CA roll (we all agree that it was a pretty good roll)... but my dinner was not so tasty.

My vegetables were about 95% cabbage, two thin slices of carrot, 2 medium slices of zucchini, and two small broccoli florets... and all the vegetables were 100% RAW. I really don't like cabbage and I really dislike raw broccoli and raw zucchini... I was really disappointed with the vegetables especially because I love properly cooked/steamed zucchini, broccoli, and carrots (raw or cooked).

The beef and chicken were dry, the small amount of sauce helped very little. The amount of sauce did not bother me as they gave me plenty more. I popped the top off two small containers of the six they gave us, dumped it on and took a bite... all to find out that this was not teriyaki sauce, it was something else... it was like a really sour and thick soy sauce (not ponzu). It didn't taste horrible, but it was not what I was expecting... that one is my fault, I should not have assumed it was teriyaki... I should have tried it first.

Food alone, this would have been a 3 star review... but that was before I called them back to give them some constructive feedback. A nice lady answered the phone, I explained that we just finished our dinner we picked up and it wasn't very good. I explained my issues with the raw vegetables and that it was about 95% cabbage. She confirmed that the 95% cabbage was normal for them and thanked me for my call. She was very nice, but she does not understand customer service... I am extremely disappointed that 95% cabbage was normal and not a onetime mistake... and the fact that she did not apologize that it was not a good experience really shows a lack of concern for opinions of their customers.

I have the mindset that if I eat something, then it was not bad enough to get a refund or be otherwise compensated. I work with many people in the restaurant industry and many of them want to treat the customer fairly. If I dislike something to the point I don't want to eat it, I let them fix it. I'm rarely disappointed with a resolution that I have received. If I eat the complete dish and didn't like it too much, I will tell the wait staff who almost always get the manager involved. I will turn down any compensation they offer because \"I liked it enough to eat it\" and just ask them to make sure the other guests are taken care of... I just feel that is the right thing to do.

The reason that I went off on that tangent above is that Yogi's Grill on Ocotillo & Arizona Ave didn't offer anything, not even an apology. That does not sit right with me... they could have offered to comp the meal, I would have refused since \"I liked it enough to eat it\", but the lack of concern and the lack of the desire to \"make it right\" was enough to knock this down to two stars.

Overall, I will go back to Yogi's Grill, just not this one. I'll make the drive up to Ray & Loop 101... those guys have a great operation there and they treat their customers correctly. If you don't like this one on Ocotillo & Arizona Ave please try the other locations... they are so much better!"}
{"text":"I just posted a two star review for a Yogi's on Ocotillo and Arizona Ave... so I wanted to post one for this location as my experience was 100% different!

I loved this place, the food was fantastic!

I ordered the Beef and Chicken Combo Bowl (comes with rice and vegetables), my wife ordered the Chicken Plate (comes with rice and salad)... it was lunch on a Saturday when we stopped by and had a bite to eat before picking up our daughter visiting at a friend's house.

Both the Beef and Chicken were flavorful, the sauce did not overpower the natural flavor of the food. The rice was perfectly cooked and the vegetables were perfectly steamed (zucchini, carrots, squash and broccoli... not an ounce of cabbage [see my other review to understand what I mean by that comment]).

My wife loved her food as well... very tasty overall.

The environment was clean and you could tell the employees really took care of everything.

Food was out quickly, but not super-fast (I didn't mind the 10 minute wait... it's hard to have \"fresh\" food any faster anyway).

I have been back, and I will continue to go back. The guys behind the counter were friendly and explained a few things about the menu since it was our first time there.

Give this location a shot, you won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"Good eats for being relative fast food. I tried the Arizona Bowl last week and can't stop eating it."}
{"text":"Update: I decided to give this place one more chance, I ordered through uber eats and what do you know, they messed up my order AGAIN. I've never had a restaurant so incapable of handling something so simple. I warn everyone away from this location.

Every single time I've came to this location they have absolutely messed up my order.
Today I finally had it and called to inform them of what's been happening and I asked to speak to a manager about it and I was told their manager only speaks Spanish....I'm sorry but if you're a manager why do you only speak Spanish?? That just doesn't add up.
I won't ever be coming back to this location. Definitely not worth my money, I suggest going to another yogis or just somewhere else entirely!"}
{"text":"So so so so good ..i have been here 2 times and had the chicken teriyaki bowl..so good..and the staff is great..i have found my new work time lunch place..."}
{"text":"I Ordered the large chicken with a drink for lunch... $7 and some change. Yoshinoya is a totally different dish, so I won't compare... Flame broiler and Waba.... Yeah, those two have nothing on this place... Perfect rice and juicy yet a bit crispy chicken! Love it!"}
{"text":"Their Chicken is amazing! They are always busy and lately they have this new Filipino lady working and she is flying around like a wild woman getting it done!!  Great food and great service will keep me coming back!"}
{"text":"OK food but awkward layout and poorly trained staff.  

Half the time I order by number and the girl taking my order has no clue what I'm trying to order.  Often they put my name down in an unrecognizable spelling that when they call my order, I have no idea it's me.  

The takeout orders are handed out in the middle of the ordering line so you have people bumping up against you while you sit and wait.  

The steak and chicken almost always have several big chunks of gristle you have to spit out.

After a year of alternating between Yoshi's and Yogi's, it's time for me to go back to Yoshi's exclusively."}
{"text":"Love this yogis! The one on grove and alma school has way different food and is never very good but this one is always consistently delicious and clean and the staff are all very friendly!"}
{"text":"Cashiers are always on point every time I come in some days it gets busy but I can tell they are doing there best, bunch of rockstars! The food is very tasty I enjoy this location and will be continue to be returning regularly"}
{"text":"Teriyaki chicken or beef rice.  Always good!
Egg rolls are good as well.  
Food is always fresh and hot.  They have your food out to you in a few minutes."}
{"text":"This place is soooo yummy! Everything is fresh and clean. Staff is friendly. Definitely 5 stars."}
{"text":"Pretty good food, I must say.  Had the Gyoza (Potstickers) and shared the Dragon Roll with my husband. I like my potstickers a little less on the crunchy side but over all they were good.  The Dragon roll was amazing!  Very filling and cost was fair.  Under 10$ a person. Will def return."}

{"text":"Awesome. Love it. To quote my friend 'you can tell there's someone in the kitchen that gives a sh*t.'"}
{"text":"What kind of a restaurant mops the floor during rush hour lunch with an extremely odorous cleaner while people are trying to eat? Luckily we were already done eating so it didn't ruin our food but we left immediately! I ordered the CA roll & 2 egg rolls. Food was good but the sauce for the egg rolls was terrible & for some reason they left part of a shrimp or something sticking out of the CA roll ... weird. My friend had a special order which they were totally willing to accommodate which was great but then couldn't bring her the right rice. It was decent for healthy fast food but I would make some improvements."}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed. Will never return. I ordered the Edamame, Veggie Tempura, Veggie Roll, and two Avocado Rolls. I realized that my avocado rolls were actually California rolls and I am a complete vegetarian. I came back to the counter to let them know that they gave me the wrong rolls and they proceeded to tell me that the avocado rolls were merely California rolls with avocado on the outside. However, when you look at the large menu posted in the restaurant you are unable to see that detail underneath the food item. I told the young man behind the counter that generally an avocado roll is merely that; avocado and rice. He told me that he didn't know what to say and showed me the smaller menu stating the detail of the roll. I requested that they  remake the roll as you cannot see those details if you are just looking at their large menu and any other place I eat and avocado roll is just that. He proceeded to tell me that the manager is very strict and would not assist me with this request. He said he cannot do anything because it was only a customer mistake not theirs. I asked to see the manager and the employee would not grab his manager. I asked again if they would remake the rolls as I cannot eat crab meat. The employee stated he would make them again but that they would charge me for the new rolls. 
Very disappointed that they may no accommodation for a customer that clearly followed a general rule of thumb and could not see the details of their posted menu, if it had the details of the food. 
The food was subpar as well. The veggie tempura was undercooked and doughy, they gave extremely little sauce for the tempura, and the edamame were soggy. The sheer lack of customer service already placed a bad taste in my mouth and the food did not live up to expectations at all. It was a waste of money and food. I will never return to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch today, it's in the strip mall that I happen to own a business. Let me first say I do go to Kona grill a great deal and they are divine. This place well the owner walked out from behind the door and there was no smile, no happy to greet you attitude. Customer service is everything. 
I ordered one of their bowls, it was OK but for the price I was disappointed. 
The shop, and the two different decorations, one wooden and the other glass table tops, it appears cheap. 
They are OK but a great deal more expensive than I was expecting. I'll stick with my Kona grill who really knows how to do a Caterpillar roll."}
{"text":"First time going here had the katsu chicken bowl was pretty good and was filling"}
{"text":"They do not offer a basic avacado roll or cucumber roll----I asked for just a basic/plain avacado roll & was charged $8.00---for their \"avacado roll\"--californa w/ avacado, minus the california.

Not a good value."}
{"text":"Usually get the regular chicken teriyaki bowl. Always good. Rice has a nice consistency and chicken is always well cooked and marinated."}
{"text":"tried this place for the first time today, and did not like it at all... i would not recommend it, but thats just me..."}
{"text":"I go here probably EVERY SINGLE DAY. It is the best Japanese food I have ever had. The place is clean and roomy. The servers are always friendly. I would recommend this to everyone I know!"}
{"text":"Pretty good teriyaki chicken if you're in a hurry. Been here a few times & they've had great customer service. They were literally faster than the Starbucks next door where I only bought a simple latte."}
{"text":"This was the worst chicken teriyaki I have ever had.  The green onions they put on top smelled like they were rotten. I picked them off and took a bite. To my surprise I bit into a small bone. It stunned my tooth. I took a closer look at my bowl a decided to remove the burt portions of chicken. Which pretty much left me with rice. My wife reminded me that our good friend had a bad experience a Yogis as well and suggested we cut our losses and leave.  Which we did. Never to go back.  I will now take my friends advice when it comes to food."}
{"text":"I just have a question for this restaurant. How can a place that deals in sushi and white rice dishes be out of both sushi and white rice? What a disappointment!"}
{"text":"I Love Love  Love this place!!! My husband picks up food from here twice a week and it is soo good.  I especially love their chicken yakisoba and California roll.  Plus the people that work here are super nice."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The chicken teriyaki veggie bowl and the garlic noodles are recommended. Service is always fast and friendly. Clean inside."}
{"text":"Not very authentic, but good in its own way.

I like this place because I don't have to tip.
Walk in, order, get food, eat, walk out, at my own pace w/o servers hovering over me.

I have tried:

The potato croquette. Pretty good.

Tempura Udon. Pretty tasty but a lil too salty afterwards.
Usually the battered fried veggies and shrimp + noodles + the fried flakes fill me up.

Might not be big enough in portion for some ppl though.

Fried California roll : Battered and fried.
tastes good with teriyaki sauce (which is basically sweeetned and thickened soy sauce)

Crunch Roll. Battered fried shrimp, rice, avocado wrapped in nori (seaweed), coated in fried flakes
Pretty good but I'm not a big fan of shrimp to start with.
If you like fried shrimp, go for it.

If you're looking for something authentic and expensive, go to Shimogamo.

This place isn't priced too horribly for what I get, but then again 
I'm very petite and I don't eat that much so I usually get one Golden /fried CA roll with a croquette and maybe a Ramune (Soda with a marble stuck in a bottle) and all is digested in a few hours and hunger returns.

If you're an average sized person, might have to order more than one dish to not walk out hungry lol"}
{"text":"This place is always clean and friendly. And the food is great. I've been here a bunch and each time the food is always great! The crunchy rolls are really good if you want sushi. And the yakisoba is always great. It always have fresh vegitables when I get it and the flavoring is good."}
{"text":"My family & I decided to stop in after a movie. We got in at 9pm. One of the staff was putting up chairs so I asked him what time they closed & he told me 9:30 so we still had time. After deciding what we wanted to order I started placing it with the cashier. I started to notice his irritation with me after he repeated back the second order. When I told him the third item we wanted he started banging the keys of the register and in an annoyed voice repeated all the orders & ended it with \"is that all?\". My fiancé stepped in & said we actually were going to cancel our order because his behavior was a little rude. That's when the man that was putting up the chairs chimed in, interrupting my fiancé, & said \"ok bye!\". He then proceeded to open the front door to show us out. We were being dismissed. They had very aggressive body language & their demeanor was very hostile. I've never experienced something like this from a business before. I asked for a manager's business card & that's when they pointed at a small elderly lady in the back & said \"that's the owner right there!\". We tried communicating to this woman who seemed very nice but did not seem to understand English very well. Nothing was resolved, she just smiled & apologized. We feel bad for this lady who has two extremely disrespectful employees working for her, but we will never come back here."}
{"text":"The one off Alma school in my opinion is better. I love their chicken bowls, but was very disappointed that their chicken seemed to be precooked & came out cold. I would be willing to drive further to the one near fiesta mall."}
{"text":"Great tasting food and the prices aren't that bad. Location was very clean. 
The girl working the front cash register was incredibly good looking so good job there.

Get the Chicken Teriakyi bowl with rice if you come here and get some extra sauce."}
{"text":"Today is 2/6/16 I ordered a garlic noodle w/chicken. The last time I was here my experience was good today..... Not so much. It smells like a port o potty. OMG I was unable to enjoy my late lunch. I ate a bit but end up leaving as the smell made me lose my appetite. 
Not sure what why it's smells this awful. Somebody needs to do something about it. Omg it stinks in here."}
{"text":"Heard about this place in the paper with someone recommending it for good Japanese food.  Thought we'd give it a try.  A little pricy, but honestly, the quantity was very good as well as the taste.  We'll go back and try some of the other choices.  Looks like there's one closer to us though.  There was only one other group of people there, so it was pretty quiet, which is fine."}
{"text":"The tempura roll is really good, take the advice from a Hawaiian who knows about good Asian food, Aloha"}
{"text":"Love their teriyaki chicken, I like it more than the beef. I work out at the 24 hour fitness across the street and me and my workout buddy come here after every workout and order a large chicken bowl with extra chicken. It's become a ritual. Their udon soup was also good."}
{"text":"I love the food they have here! They have a wide variety of options and everything is fabulous. My favorite is the Beef Teriyaki Veggie Bowl. It's a great portion for the price. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"We had the Chicken Teriyaki brown rice bowl. The rice was mushy, and it smelled and tasted bad, we won't go back."}
{"text":"Ordered the regular all white meat teriyaki chicken (spicy) & vegetables to go. It also comes with some white rice. The rice was good. The cabbage, carrot & zucchini were good. The chicken was tasty. I loved that it was cut into small thin strips which makes it much easier to eat with chopsticks. It was delicious. I work nearby but never tried until today. I will definitely eat here again. Total with tax was $7.94. Can't wait to try some of the other menu items."}
{"text":"Amazing service and exquisite food. The cooks and and cashiers were nice and friendly. The place was clean and organized. I had no complaints, small or large."}
{"text":"Always have the best service & great food. Plus I forgot my wallet there & when I returned to retrieve it five hours later,  everything was in it. I appreciate the honesty & the character of it's staff."}
{"text":"Been to other yogis and loved their teriyaki beef and chicken. Glad to see one opened in peoria"}
{"text":"Just got out the movies and wanted something fast. Go in and it smells amazing. Chicken cooked on grill in front of you. Super nice ppl and food ended up tasting very flavorful. Hit em up after movies. I had chicken teriyaki and pot stickers!"}
{"text":"The food was barely average, and the customer service was HORRIBLE!  Seriously, the jerks behind the counter acted like I was putting them out to take and prepare my simple order, and then glared and grunted at me when they took my money.  The teriyaki bowl left me spitting out pieces of gristle, so I could definitely do without the side order of rude.

I had already given them another chance, and my previous experience was exactly the same...I'm not sure why I thought it would be different this time.  I'm writing this negative review because they need to be reminded that we have a choice, and I for one choose not to return to Yogi's Grill."}
{"text":"They offer a great teriyaki chicken meal! You can order it in a bowl with veggies or with a nice salad with a bigger portion. Regardless of which way you order it, it comes out delicious. The food is consistent and is prepared fast. The sauce isn't too overkill with teriyaki flavor. Their shrimp tempura soup is great as well. More veggies than noodles with the soup (and what do we need more in American diets?). Good place to try."}
{"text":"Great food. I had the teriyaki chicken & beef with white rice. The food isn't greasy like the typical Chinese joint. The teriyaki sauce is great! Freshly made."}
{"text":"The restaurant was dead and the staff was hardly attentive. Employees in the front were gossiping when we walked in and didn't greet us. The bowls were hot, but were one toned, bland, and in my opinion overpriced. My fiance went to the girl at the register because he had a hole in his cup.. he had to tell her twice before she gave him a new one.

I wasn't impressed with the place. Yes, it's new-- it may need its kinks worked out, but I won't be going here again."}
{"text":"Whenever I go to Phoenix (in last year it was 4 times) this is a place to go directly from the airport. It's a must visit place with my friend. Great food selection, tried so many sushi varieties, friendly stuff. Shrimp tempura udon is served in a huge bowl and super delicious! No matter how hungry you are you'll have leftover for tomorrow. Apart from California roll that is in most japanese restaurants my suggestion is to try dragon roll. It's crunchy and very tasty. It will make you want it more. Hawaiian rolls are great, but if you don't like row fish don't have it. They are even making teriyaki with tempura combos and portions are big. Fresh, tasty food and nice place to go to with friends or family."}
{"text":"This place is going down hill. I used to pick up from here frequently for work and it was always good and the owner was super friendly and helpful. Although the soda machine never seemed to work. My husband picked up tonight and the chicken was under cooked and the rolls were gigantic and falling apart. It was like the person who made them was doing it for the first time. Still tasted good but it was a mess. The store on Ray road is way better!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and perfect location for any Luke AFB military personnel looking for some decent Asian cuisine. I'm going on my third lunch this week! The Chicken Teriyaki and ginger salad dressing is out of this world!"}
{"text":"Went in the other day didn't know what to expect, I ordered the teriyaki bowl it was great! Only thing bad was the lack of outdoor seating which isn't that big of a deal. My server Andreya was great she was very kind and gave me an excellent recommendation of food choices while the whole time providing great service! :)"}
{"text":"Tried it for the first time with a \"grand opening\" coupon. Buy one, get the second for half off. Instead of applying it to the regular meals, they applied it to my kids' meals and refused to budge when I called them out on it.

The place was a ghost town... A restaraunt chain ghost town. Nothing culturally authentic here. The cashier had the personality of styrofoam. The teriyaki was so-so. The miso was like magma and had no tofu. I requested their \"spicy teriyaki\", but I think the robot-like cashier forgot to relay that message. I'm not Japanese, but I thought tempura was supposed to have a dipping sauce? Didn't matter much, there were only three pieces.

The only chance of me going back is if I get the runs, in which case I will be returning their product for a refund."}
{"text":"Good food and very clean restaurant. We love the teriyaki bowls and the salmon plate. Love their teriyaki sauce and they sell bottles of it now! I haven't found anything better."}
{"text":"Yogis is a great place to get some delicious teriyaki places and they also have a pretty good spicy California roll.  The prices are good and the place is always clean.  The service is okay...the cashier can be a little nicer but all in all...I'm a total fan."}
{"text":"Really good food! Teriyaki chicken bowl, shrimp tempura udon soup, tempura California roll, are some of my favorites!"}
{"text":"I cannot put into words how happy this restaurant makes me, the food is simple but delicious, perfect rice every time.  If it was served on expensive plates I could easily justify paying an extra $3 a plate!!!"}
{"text":"I was so disappointed. Came here from Washington and grabbed it for a quick bite & it was not good.  The only good thing we had to eat was the sushi .  The chicken was gross and so was the sauce .  Made my stomach hurt after eating some of it , we ate enough to get by but threw the test away.  Also waited a while for just a small order .  Wouldn't go here again.  I mean I guess you could try it for yourself but not good to me waste of money."}
{"text":"Great food! I was not really a fan of teriyaki until I came here. I could eat here everyday"}
{"text":"Fast food Japanese! It's a much healthier fast food choice. I really like the chicken/beef teriyaki veggie bowl. The regular size is a fairly large portion and reasonably priced. A generous serving of meat. The veggies is comprised of steamed broccoli, carrots and cabbage. Nothing fancy, not a lot of flavor, but you can add teriyaki sauce on it. The Katsu chicken was a decent sized portion, had good flavor but a little on the dry side. Wasn't wowed by the sushi. 
It appears to be a family run restaurant. Service is good and the place is clean. Don't forget to get your punch card. It can get pretty crowed during lunch time. You can fax or call in an order. Lunch time parking can be a challenge as well."}
{"text":"I love Yogi's Grill, I am a huge fan of Japanese food and I'm so glad that there is not only one close to my work but another just opened up because sometimes you just don't feel like having to go to a sit down restaurant to enjoy it. 

My meal of choice is usually the chicken teriyaki bowls. The chicken is tender and juicy and it has just the right amount of teriyaki sauce on it. I have tried the beef before and was just not as big of a fan of it. If it's your first time definitely try the chicken first! Everything is made to order I believe so it will take longer then say a Panda Express to get your food but it's worth it and the wait isn't THAT long. They also have a great lunch special that is under $10 for a meal and a medium drink.

What I love about this place though is that they have a small fridge next to the registers filled with various drinks including some Japanese imports. I never get a fountain drink here, I always pick up a can of delicious green tea to enjoy and I'm not talking the AriZona kind (though I do enjoy those as well). 

Besides the chicken teriyaki I also love treating myself to an unagi teriyaki plate from time to time. It only comes in a large so it's a bit pricier but you get enough food for the price that I never feel ripped off. I've also sampled the miso soup and the tempura here and both were good. I've ordered sushi rolls about twice but don't expect restaurant quality sushi from here. Not saying that it's bad but it's nothing to really write home about either.

The food is pictured on plates and in bowls but it does come in styrofoam containers or plastic bowls. It works for me since I usually take my food back to work to enjoy but there is ample seating if you want to stay and eat as well."}
{"text":"Let me start of by saying that yogis grill got me to like sushi but this was at their chandler location. I recently moved so I saw that I had a yogis grill close by so my girlfriend and I went tonight and was so disappointed.

Customer service is everything and the girls working the register did not know how to treat a customer if it hit them in the face. One of them was so rude that she even did an eye roll to my girl. 

We got 2 rolls. 1 Vegas roll and 1 crunch roll. The Vegas roll was okay but it was burnt and it only had 6 pieces instead of 8 like the chandler location. The crunch roll was also okay but nothing special. For the prices I'm paying at this location I would expect they would know how to make a damn roll right but I guess not.

Never will come back here again and I'm currently looking for another place near by that will give me a quality roll like yogis grill once did.

Don't make the same mistake I did."}
{"text":"I stopped by this place for lunch today and it was amazing!  The Lion King Roll was delicious!  One of the best rolls I had anywhere!  I also enjoyed the Rainbow Roll.  The food was fresh and the service was top notch!  Great spot for a quick delicious lunch or dinner!"}
{"text":"The service was friendly and it seemed clean.  You place your order with the cashier, get your  drink, napkins, fork and sauces and then sit down.  They brought out our food in a timely manner.  If you like a bowl that is filled 3/4 full with rice and then a few ingredients put on top, you will love this place.  For me, this was not a good experience.  I had the small Arizona bowl.  While the portion size was generous, it was 3/4 rice.  On the top they put a scoop of mushed up imitation crab meat in some mayo and a sliced up avocado.  That was it.  No sauce, no flavoring, no nothing.  You can get teriyaki and soy sauces from the counter but, the bowl was  filled so full that you couldn't mix anything in until you had eaten the crab and avocado off the top.  My g/f got a small chicken teriyaki bowl.  This was also a bowl 3/4 full of rice with a few pieces of chicken on top and a very cafeteria tasting teriyaki sauce on the top.  I pictured them in the kitchen having a whole bunch of prepped bowls 3/4 full of rice just waiting to slap one or two ingredients on the top to fill the orders.  With so many good restaurants nearby (Sandellas right next door) I don't think this place will last for long."}
{"text":"This was the first time the wife and I went here and we weren't disappointed. Service was great and the guy at the counter was very helpful and informative. The food was amazing!!!! We will be eating here often, I can see that."}
{"text":"So I had the \"Chicken Teriyaki Bowl\" It was pretty good was Impressed Better then other Chicken Teriyaki Bowls I've had. The atmosphere was nice to real clean, Staff seem friendly. I will go back"}
{"text":"Decided to try Yogis for takeout, and it was OK. I tried the white meat teriyaki bowl. The large portion is a fair size, enough for two meals at least. The meat was a little bit dry for my personal liking, but the teriyaki sauce was great. Ask for extra though! The service was quick, and they've got a few tables inside if you decide to sit down!"}
{"text":"Nice clean place, awesome food!!!  Jocelyn at the front counter is really nice.  I eat here several times a week!"}
{"text":"Food was alright, my beef teriyaki was somewhat warm, as was my girlfriends chicken teriyaki. Ordered a roll of sushi, was room temperature but tasted good. Thankfully it didn't have any raw fish or I would have sent it back. I was put off by the whole \"our signature sauce is in a gallon pump and you can't have any lids for the containers\" thing. In short, employee was apathetic about customer service, food was not at proper temperature and definitely overpriced. Will not come back."}
{"text":"I come in here minimum four times a week I work in the Tempe marketplace and let me tell you the food is really good but their service is absolute crap they are so rude they don't even look at you in the face. They look at you like you're asking something wrong if you ask for an extra sauce I was like 22 cents short and they wouldn't give me the food. Like I said I come here all the time.... No more."}
{"text":"The food is bomb!! Point blank. Sushi is on point, I order that or Udon but my family has tried and loves it all. The younger kid that works there and who is literally always there (name is escaping me) is freaking awesome and deserves a raise/promotion ... I would kill for an employee like that so hang on to him and treat him right. 

A++"}
{"text":"I am so happy I found this place. This food is fantastic I love getting the Shrimp Tempera. They have great sodas as well."}
{"text":"Yay Yogis Grill is open!!! But the address and times are wrong : they open everyday from 10:30 AM to 9 PM and the address is 70 S Val Vista Dr #A-7!!!! Yay!!!"}
{"text":"Tried the half chicken half steak rice combo plate. Chicken was very dry, almost like it had been sitting around for a bit too long. The steak was also dry. Both were bland in taste. If it wasn't for me adding Sriracha sauce and teriyaki sauce, it would not have been possible to take it down. The one good factor was the white rice was acceptable. This plate really needs improvement."}
{"text":"Dry, burnt and over cooked chicken over rice...and I even paid extra for white meat. The cashier didn't think it was unusual when I showed it to him and didn't bother to resolve the issue. To top it off, the owner was sitting at a table next to me clearing his nose and throat of congestion repeatedly. Give me a break...I'm trying to force down your poor excuse for a teriyaki bowl. I don't need to hear you sucking down snot."}
{"text":"lol what the fuck are you talking about michelle , i go in there all the time , and talk to the owner when im there . the curly haird small old lady..she knows perfect english lmao"}
{"text":"This was my first Yogi's Grill experience.  It was a very clean restaurant and the food portions were big.  I enjoyed their food and this is a good place to go for a quick \"fast food\" Japanese fix.  We ordered the chicken plate and salmon plate.  Both were good! I probably wouldn't get any sushi here since we already have a favorite sushi place. If you're sitting on the fence, this place is worth a try!"}
{"text":"This is about at 3 out of 5 stars as you can get. The food is warm, the pricing is a little cheaper than other places at Tempe marketplace, and the place is clean. Beyond that, the chicken is burned pretty badly, and the flavors are just so-so. 

I'm not fighting back barf, but I'm also not planning on eating here again. Just too many better options within walking distance."}
{"text":"I used yelp to find a place to have dinner with my girlfriend and her mother. I'm giving Yogi's a 2 pending that I'm not ill later tonight. The food was cold. The service was quick but that's probably because our food was cooked about 3 hours ago and possibly sitting on a counter for the duration. We couldn't even finish a third of our food because it was so bad. On the plus side, they have a great soda machine with a ton of variety. However, we will never dine at this \"restaurant\" again."}
{"text":"Salmon plate is amazing, it's delicious fragrant and hits the spot! I also love their rolls, and their chicken and beef bowl. I always leave this place with a bottle of their teriyaki sauce as well"}
{"text":"Good Food, we come here whenever we get a sushi crave...  prices are bit high for the amount of food you're getting, but if you like it you'll pay it I guess..."}
{"text":"RUDE! The little girl working the register in the evenings is incredibly rude. The food is delicious but nothing's worse than feeling uncomfortable at a restaurant per terrible customer service. Is it also Yogi's standard policy to turn the lights off (while guests are eating), kick paying (and eating) customers out, and lock the doors 10 minutes before the advertised closing time? If so, they should probably reevaluate that policy..."}
{"text":"This place was awful. I ordered chicken & veggie bowl for myself and shrimp & veggie for my husband. I was taking home for our dinner. I paid and was waiting when the girl at the register came up to me and said, I owed them another two dollars. I said, for what? She said, I did not charge you enough for grilled shrimp. Are you kidding me? I gladly paid her another two dollars, but thought to myself...WOW!! A restaurant that offers good customer service would have gladly ate the two bucks and told me next time it will be another two dollars and that would have been the end of it. I left with my food and went home. My chicken was terrible. Very dried out. Looked like it had been sitting under a heat lamp for hours. I ended up throwing it out. We will never be returning."}
{"text":"I visited AZ to see my family from Cali.  Went to the Tempe marketplace and found Yogis Grill.  I personally like teriyaki chicken and roll, so I tried many different restaurants in different places, but here was the best ever!
I've been there by myself, and it was pretty good experience.
Owner was kind with warm smile, teriyaki chicken was yummy and overall atmosphere was great for me. I miss so bad this place.  I will absolutely go again when I visit AZ later."}
{"text":"My buddy Mac (not Al) introduced me to Yogis today for lunch.  Tried the combo lunch special and it was terrific. They also provided a military discount.  A nice added touch was the teriyaki and spicy teriyaki sauce available with the other condiments. Great food at a great price. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"There's nothing fancy about, rather plain actually.
Clean. Inexpensive. Quick. Good. 
Fairly healthy depending on your choices.
I always just get a simple chicken Teriyaki bowl.
Great value."}
{"text":"Excellent casual fast food. Liked everything we tried. Employees and are nice and food is quick but fresh."}
{"text":"My family has been frequenting this particular Yogi's for probably th elast two years or so. It has never disappointed. The prices are good for the portions as well as the quality. We always order the terriyaki bowls, and gyoza (Pot-stickers) and are never disappointed. I would definitely recommend this to a friend for a quick dinner."}
{"text":"Food is so good, price is awesome, but the service and wait time is ridic. We ordered two reg size teriyaki bowls, one large and a california roll and it took 30 mins! The girl working the front was bullsh*&ing on the phone while food was waiting in the window. The person who ordered after us was served before because he said he couldn't wait any longer. Also, I had to repeat my order to the girl at the front 3 times cuz it was way too intense for her to ring up apparently."}
{"text":"So i Order a 8 pice spicy cali roll to go and other shushi, got home my first bite from the cali roll end up being a long pice of red hair from the chief not the first impression I expected. no longer going back to that yogis grill again !  The cooks need to wear hair nets ! So if you end up getting to go food from this place please check your food befor you eat it ! Other than that the service was good."}
{"text":"Probably one of my favorite places to eat in town.  Chicken and beef terriyaki combo with pot stickers and thai tea with boba js the way to go."}
{"text":"Everything here is delicious and the prices are excellent. The staff is always friendly and always staying busy. The store itself is clean and inviting. This location even has one of those fancy coke machines that let's you mix your own soft drink creations! I have never had a bad experience here and highly recommend it to anyone in the area looking for good food."}
{"text":"I love this place. Spicy chicken bowl for lunch YUM!  When I want to cheat on my diet I eat here excellent food at a good price. Carry out call ahead during lunch very popular so you may have to wait a few minutes."}
{"text":"Great food...if they're open. Sporadic hours or just porely run. As I'm writing this I've seen a few more people try to get food, but the restaurant is closed. Probably won't make the trip anymore because i can't rely on them being open."}
{"text":"I had a teriyaki chicken and steak bowl as well as a spicy tuna roll.  The teriyaki bowl was good.  There was a decent amount of meat to rice and it had a nice, sticky teriyaki sauce.  I stuck with the regular size as opposed to the large and it was filling enough.  I do have to throw a challenge flag on the spicy tuna roll.  You can probably see from my photo below that it might have more accurately been called a cucumber roll with some tuna in there somewhere.  What little tuna there was was good, but I did feel a bit shortchanged.  I'd probably stick with the bowl next time and get a roll elsewhere."}
{"text":"Food is always great and fresh. Owner is friendly. Byfar the best teriyake in arizona. and their fried rice is great. The prices is just right its not over the top. and its worth the money. The location is also great im a movie goer and this completes the movie dinner date !"}
{"text":"Very tasty, fresh teriyaki bowls.  The regular size is a great lunch portion, and they have sushi rolls too.   Not too crowded and a quick meal before returning to work."}
{"text":"I love Yogis Grill. Great portions for good money. The small bowl fills me up perfectly. Worth visiting."}
{"text":"The sushi is great. Everytime I go the staff is friendly and very helpful. Downside the price is a little high."}
{"text":"I love this place during lunch time. They're very friendly & my order comes out quickly. Food is always good. I've never been disappointed up until tonight. I ordered my usual, chicken teriyaki bowl with avocado. I sat down & waited for my order to be ready. After 10 mins, I noticed someone else's order was ready & the woman had just walked in to pick it up. I figured they had called in their order, which I usually do, but I was in no rush tonight. Finally after another 15 mins, they called my name. During lunch hours it's ready in about 5-10 mins. When I finally got home to eat, I noticed the chicken was a little burnt & there wasn't as much as they usually serve when I come in for lunch. I'm really disappointed tonight. Night crew needs to work on getting food out in a timely matter & cooking the food properly. It will always be my go to place for lunch, but for dinner I'll go elsewhere."}
{"text":"ok, so this place is OK,

2 stars because everything they serve they serve it in Styrofoam I mean really?? 2 stars because the gal that works there was unfriendly, she is always texting in front of customers and does not want to be bothered. The chicken was overcooked, almost burned.  2 good stars because one of the times I went the beef bowl was delicious, California rolls are good, I don't think is expensive at all, I never order chicken bowl anymore because they over cook it. I probably go to this place once a month because of the California rolls or beef bowl"}
{"text":"The food isn't bad at all but the service is terrible! I've been here three times since it's opened and the first time they weren't able to make what I ordered because they said something was wrong with their fryer and they had just opened so the owner offered to replace it with something else. No big deal. The second time the cashier charged my card two times and couldn't figure out how to fix it and again the owner had to offer apologies and fixed it. The third time before the cashier even ran my debit card she handed it back to me me saying she wouldn't run it because it was expired when I had one full month before it expired. Their sushi rolls are good and the owner is so nice and always apologetic. I feel bad for giving such a poor review, but seriously how many times can your staff screw up, I would be more willing to go here again if the customer service staff was replaced or at least trained."}
{"text":"Glad to have a healthy fast food option near by, replaced a wanna be Panda Express that was probably full of MSG! My go to after the gym on lazy cooking days.. So far the food has been just as good as the other Yogis locations, only complaint is that they're not open later like the McDowell location:( that's the 5th star deduction.."}
{"text":"Looking online I thought this place was more restaurant style, but when I got here found it to be more fast-food like. The food was good, staff were friendly, and the pricing reasonable. I don't think I would make this my go to place for Sushi or Japanese Cuisine, but I would come back again."}
{"text":"My first time having Yogis, I have heard good things about it. We were greeted when we entered and didn't take very long to get our order. I didn't think they put enough sauce on the teriyaki chicken, it didn't really have much flavor. The katsu chicken was soggy. I've definitely had better and was pretty disappointed. It wasn't even worth saving the leftovers I didn't eat."}
{"text":"This place is good! There bowls are nice and big and come with plenty of chicken and rice. There teriyaki sauce is really good as well. Looking forward to try other things from here!"}
{"text":"Horrible service! Was given the wrong plate and was told oh well there's nothing we can do about it unless u want to buy another plate! Never again will I step a foot in this place. Just cause the owners are Korean you can't speak to them. Wei doesn't belong behind a register."}
{"text":"Have been so disappointed in them. Fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice shame on me, fool me 3 times I'm never going again. First time (about a month ago) I ordered 3 chicken veggie bowls. When I got home, none of them had veggies. I called and said come back so I did. When I got my second order, I checked to make sure they had veggies. The first 2 did so I figured all of them did. When I got home, the 3rd didn't have veggies. I called them back and they said to come back. At this point, I was hungry and tired of driving so they said they would give me a bowl for free the next time. I called the other day to redeem and to order 5 bowls for my family and they said they could only give me the veggies and a side of rice as a replacement for the bowl. Huh?!? When I got home, the chicken and veggie bowl was more like chicken and cabbage bowl. About 98% of the \"veggies\" were cabbage with little to no broccoli or carrots. The meat was as close to jerky as can be. It was so close to being inedible. Will never go here again."}
{"text":"I have been to 4 or 5 different Yogis restaurants locally and this one is the best. 

They are fast, serve quality food and have descent portions."}
{"text":"Great lunch specials, service is always quick.  I'm not sure about the sushi but for a quick decent teriaki lunch special its the best deal in the area."}
{"text":"I have tried this place a few times to make sure it wasn't just a mistake but every single time I get the teriyaki chicken they put a very small amount of chicken. Flavor is great but I'm still hungry after I have finished everything every time. Not going to go spend $8 for a snack size portion of teriyaki chicken."}
{"text":"Excellent Teriyaki. Excellent Sushi. Great place Very clean and FASTEST !!! This is seattle Quality Teriyaki.  Will come Again."}
{"text":"It's Yogi's, so the food is always good. However, their customer service is in need of some help. If you're going to prioritize a phone call over the people across the counter form you, you've completely lost me. Not once, but two phone calls in a row without any acknowledgement of my existence. I walked out and won't be back to THAT location. I went next door and gave my money to Cane's."}
{"text":"John was a great employee! He was very patient with us since it was our first time her here had a great since of humor ! He made me and my friend feel welcomed ! It was the best guess service I've ever received."}
{"text":"Way better than we expected! Drove by this place multiple times and decided to finally come try it. The portions were much larger than we anticipated so we ended up taking our sushi home with us.

My brother got the teriyaki beef bowl and enjoyed it. He also got the crazy tuna roll and it was enormous. He said it was very spicy which is surprising since he has a high tolerance for spice. He was very pleased.

I got the beef udon which was delicious. Lots of noodled and beef and veggies to munch on. The crunch roll came after and it was enormous but full of flavor. Was very happy with it.

The place was clean and quiet. Not a lot of lunch rush on a Monday but thats to be expected. Definitely plan to come again!"}
{"text":"Went to this place with a friend to pick up dinner today (lazy man's dinner!).  We both ordered the chicken teriyaki, and I gotta say, I feel lucky coming out of this meal with all my teeth intact.  I don't know if they overcooked the chicken, or this chicken has been reheated a million times, but it literally felt like I was chewing on a thousand year old beef jerky.

Would I return?  If I'm desperate, maybe.  But I wouldn't order the chicken that time."}
{"text":"I originally drove over to this location because i thought it was a WABA grill but decided to try it anyways, and now i go 2-3 times a week. Its everything you could want for Japanese cuisine and they give you a pretty good amount of food. I've never spent over $15 at this place and i always get a lot of food for myself. Nice and clean place, and the staff are very well mannered. I'm always craving something from this place, and i recommend trying the deep fried mashed potato thing! its awesome!"}
{"text":"Food is consistently good. Always clean. Sushi is great considering it's a \"fast food\" place. Better than most places, but not my favorite sushi out there."}
{"text":"I love the chicken teriyaki from yogis but today I got a large order and I get one small cup of sauce. They should be giving you two cups per order"}
{"text":"Quick and easy and the flavors never fail! The kids chicken teriyaki with all white meat and spicy sauce is the perfect size, for an easy take out sushi that hasn't been sitting in the super market freezer for days this is my place-- try the Las Vegas roll their version is made with shredded crab and you can sub or add salmon."}
{"text":"I come to Phoenix every year for Spring Training and Yogis Grill at the Tempe Marketplace is my go-to place to eat. The chicken and beef bowls are delicious and they give a generous amount of food for a very reasonable price. My annual Spring Training trip usually lasts a week and I literally eat here every night -- that's how much I love this place. The place is clean and the service is very fast.

Danny is awesome! He always has a smile on his face and is very warm and welcoming. He's extremely helpful and friendly, and if you need anything he's right there to help you. The rest of the Yogis crew are also top-notch. Kudos to the owners for hiring such great people that make the dining experience so pleasant!

I always look forward to coming back every spring... to watch baseball and to eat at Yogis!"}
{"text":"The Arizona bowl is all I ever get from here but it is good. I like how you can gather your own condiments and you squirt them into little containers,  including the teriyaki sauce. Good for a quick bite to eat."}
{"text":"Had lunch here today. The salad I had was crisp and fresh. The chicken had a great taste. The portions were very good. 
The place was clean. The service was fine. 
For fast food and selection we will be back."}
{"text":"Yummy food! Love the chicken and ground beef combo with rice! Super awesome combo and great post workout!! Sauce is yummy"}
{"text":"They have a daily lunch special of either Chicken, Beef or Combination of those two with a drink for $7.95. Upgrade it to a large size for a dollar more. They also have a variety of sushi on the menu and they are all delicious. I always get a lunch portion for my fiancé and I and also a couple of sushi dishes (either crunch roll, caterpillar, or rainbow)."}
{"text":"I've been curious about this place and meaning to try it. Overall, I was satisfied with Yogis Grill. The ingredients were fresh and it's a fast and relatively inexpensive place to enjoy a quick bite. I have to disagree with one reviewer. I ordered the chicken teriyaki bowl and the teriyaki sauce was actually quite mild and they don't give you much of it. Good thing they have a dispenser where you can pump out some additional sauce, if you desire (and I obviously did). A couple of other things: the chicken comes out a little greasy, not excessively so, but more so than I would prefer, and why can't my chicken teriyaki bowl have some vegetables as well as rice and chicken? Those green onions are good, but they don't make for a decent serving of veggies. Maybe I am just equating this too much with being a teriyaki version of Panda Express, which could be an error on my part. At any rate, I enjoyed this place and would go here again, but future craving will not be intense or frequent."}
{"text":"The cabbage wasn't cooked long enough and was tough to chew. The chicken had a burnt taste from the grill and has no flavor at all and the sauce wasn't any better. A waste of money never again"}
{"text":"I ordered a spicy California sushi roll and it practically fell apart. Very poorly made and didn't have any distinct flavor. My friend ordered a teriyaki bowl which was small compared to price value and overall mediocre in taste. Nothing special and poor service."}
{"text":"Love this place and that they have teriaki sauce on tap! Just wish they had the same sushi specials as Bento Box"}
{"text":"Order through UberEATS.  No soy sauce given, The salad had dressing on it.  It should have been on the side for delivery.  Food was OK."}
{"text":"Food is meh. I ordered grilled salmon that was NOT grilled. It was like a flash fry. Veggies come in a huge side portion, and overpriced when all I want is a little veggie in my salmon bowl. Service was is so-so. The gal who took my order brought my food to my table, and never said the veggie was on the way. How would I know that they come separately? Why wouldn't the veggie and the Salmon not come out together?

On the posit side, portions are large and there are a lot of menu choices. I won't order the salmon again, but might try chicken."}
{"text":"I have had lunch here several times. Everything I tried was very good, several sushi rolls, Teriyaki, and most recently the spicy tuna bowl. The staff is pleasant, and the place is very clean."}
{"text":"Living in CA most my life so I really didn't think sushi in AZ would be any good. To my surprise, this place has a lot of really tasty snacks! I had the lion king roll which was BOMB! The tempura was really crispy and the tempura sauce is their own special concoction. I also got to meet the owners Teresa and John. Teresa was at the table next to us and I overheard her training one of her people. I was really impressed with how well they train their staff by creating an employee friendly atmosphere by incentivizing their work ethic. John brought out our food and he was an absolute delight. A total gentleman and you can totally tell he had so much pride in his shop. This is going to definitely be my stop every time I go to Phoenix. It's not just good for the price, but good just because it's good!!!"}
{"text":"Mmmmm amazing Hawaiian roll and they don't skimp on the fresh fish. Their egg rolls and sweet/sour sauce is also amazing."}
{"text":"First time ordering for takeout . I got the fire cracker and Vegas rolls . Vegas did not come with jalepenos as described and I was shocked at how huge the rolls were  . As far as the taste goes it was  like I was eating more of the rice and fried pieces than what was in the middle of sushi roll . Also the sauce they place on the side got on some of  the rolls so some ended up being Soggy . First time for everything  but won't come back"}
{"text":"Best fast food Japanese, especially teriyaki bowls, in Phoenix.   I also like that the restaurant is very clean with a pleasant atmosphere, and the staff is friendly and helpful.  The small bowl is enough for dinner and lunch the next day for me.  A great value for the price."}
{"text":"What is going on with this restaurant their phone number goes to a disconnected line and when I go there at night they are closed but the Yogis sign is lite up. Does anyone now if 
it has closed. I love this place where are they!!"}
{"text":"The chicken is great! I prefer it over the beef. Ask for veggies to substitute rice, if that's your thing. Egg rolls are very good, too."}
{"text":"$20 for Yakisoba and a roll. 
Let's start with the \"chicken yakisoba\" 
They skimp on the chicken. And the char on the meat itself is overpowering. Awful. 

The roll. Pay $2 to get it upgraded with salmon and they forget it. Nice. 

Wouldn't recommend. Makes sense why they have \"new management.\""}
{"text":"I come here fairly regularly and it's always a decent meal. I've had a variety of dishes and they've all been pretty good. Not my favorite sushi, but the price is decent and the portion size is very reasonable. The restaurant is clean and there is a decent amount of seating. All in all a solid lunch stop."}
{"text":"My boss's favorite place for lunch and that makes this girl happy! Terryaki bowls for about 6 dollars. The food is fantastic and it's always ready in about 5-10 minutes. The staff is always very nice. We have never eaten in the dining room, but it is very clean and never too packed. It's a pretty laid back environment with a couple TV's with booths and tables. We will continue to get our lunch here :) Don't forget to sign up for Belly! You can earn points to get free drinks, apps and more!"}
{"text":"BEWARE this restaurant is dirty! I ate there against my best judgement because my daughter really wanted a California roll before seeing a movie. Big mistake. 5 hours later it is a puke feast at my house. Stay away from this place at all cost. There are so many more reputable restaurants in Tempe Marketplace to eat at. PLEASE pass this place by. I have filed a complaint with the Maricopa County Environmental Services Department. Expect a visit from the food inspector. Dirty trash cans, dirty soy sauce bottles, just walk on past this place for your own health's sake."}
{"text":"I love Yogi's.  However, I will never go back to this location.  The fried shrimp tasted like it had been fried in 10 day old oil.  The rainbow rolls were not put together well and fell apart easily.  I will stick to the Yogi's on 16th St. and Camelback."}
{"text":"Willing to work with special orders and food restrictions.  Food is prepared when you order.  If you order take out be sure to check your order before you leave."}
{"text":"Pretty good teriyaki restaurant! Good, central location near Ellsworth and Baseline. The Northwest has the best teriyaki restaurants, but I was happy to see somewhere I could get yakisoba in the valley."}
{"text":"The hubs and I have been hitting up Yogi's a lot lately. For a quick, fresh, healthy yummy meal at good prices - Yogi's is a great pick!!

Teriyaki bowls are tasty and have always been hot and fresh, both meats and the rice - not to mention coming out super quick. Love that you can get half beef half chicken because they both taste great with a nice smoky char from the grill. I've also gotten the Arizona bowl which is (faux) crabmeat and avocado on rice - for the size and amount of crabmeat plus avocado, it's a pretty good deal! My husband really loves their tuna roll, which is a bit pricey for just a tuna roll but at least it's a lot larger than your average.

There's a good variety on their menu that I'm hoping to try still - Udon, Japanese fried chicken (karaage), yakisoba etc. Definitely a great place to hit up for quick and easy, casual Japanese-style fare!"}
{"text":"Not happy at all. I don't know if this one is indpendently owned or part of the chain of restraunts but the sushi was very small compared to the restraunt by harkins arrowhead it taxed like it was still frozen and gaby the cashier was disgruntled and acted like I wasn't worth her time. I will not be coming back to this one. If you like sushi go to the yogis grill by Harkins arrowhead."}
{"text":"We went here for lunch and I got the large chicken and beef veggie bowl. I was not very happy with the meal! The portion size was pretty good but the meat was poorly made--it was dry and flavorless. The veggies were way too big to eat and they weren't flavored at all. Almost as if they were boiled. Not a fan and would not recommend the place to anyone."}
{"text":"This place has a really good teriyaki bowl. The large is big enough for two people to share. The price is fair and the service is fast."}
{"text":"If you're eating Japanese food in America, it's not going to be authentic, just the same as if you were eating American food in Japan.

As for the food, I actually quite liked it.  I ordered the Arizona Bowl which included soft shell crab, avocado and sauce over white rice.  The crab is the real deal- instead of the cheap artificial option which was a nice surprise considering the price.  The proportion of crab to avocado to rice is perfect and the flavor and consistency is great.  

I was really happy with what I ordered and considering the convenience of this location, I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Extremely tasty and well prepared food.  Wonderful management and service.   We eat either lunch or dinner here three times a week."}
{"text":"I ordered the regular chicken teriyaki bowl and it was delicious! Just the right amount of food for lunch. The only downside is that it took 14 minutes to get my order and as it was my first time here I wasn't sure if they were going to call my name, number, or bring it to me as it was a little unorganized."}
{"text":"Food was good until we found hair!! Workers were not friendly!! Rude girl who took our order and was definitely snotty! They don't close until 9, it was 8:30 and she was mad we were ordering food! Trash was overflowing and store was dirty!! We started eating and then food long hair in our chicken bowl!!! Soooo grossss!!!"}
{"text":"The interior is very dated. Most dated location I have been to yet. Furniture is mismatched. However, the biggest surprise came after I had already ordered and paid. Sushi with a side of cockroach?! Never again!"}
{"text":"Went for the first time on Saturday and they exceeded my expectations. Service, cleanliness and food were all great. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"As good or better than Tokyo Express!!! Way better than Samuri Sams-  the chicken is moist . There teriyaki sauce is really tasty and the rice is the sticky white rice I like ."}
{"text":"I love Yogi's for a healthy, reasonsbly priced good meal. You can substitute steamed veggies for rice and the Spicy teriyaki sauce is awesome."}
{"text":"For what it is (Japanese FAST FOOD) it is really good. The rice was cooked perfectly,  the salmon in my role was tender and not \"fishy\". My companion got the teriyaki beef bowl, lol carb option which replaced rice with steamed veg. However it was swimming in sauce...not so low carb...other than that,  it was quite tasty. The sushi options are fairly limited, and no sea weed salad, but price is definitely right. If you're wanting a fast meal, good price, rather than a fine dining experience this is the place!"}
{"text":"If I could give this place negative stars I would!  What a dump!  Dirty, cooks and preps eating food while cooking!  To the guy with the shaved eyebrows and hickeys on your neck if you worked for me looking like that you wouldn't be working any longer!  So glad I walked out of this place after being ignored at the counter for 10 minutes.  People go elsewhere!"}
{"text":"The food is always good! However, 6 people behind the counter, few customers, trash overflowing and dirty tables. Ok..."}
{"text":"so I found this place while on a Starbucks run. Being from the Seattle area, I'm a teriyaki whore.afficionado. Every time I see a new teriyaki spot, I sooooo hope it's close to what I can get at home. We decided to get takeout for dinner from Yogi. I got the chicken and beef teriyaki dinner that came with beef and chicken teriyaki, rice, salad, 2 piece cali roll, 1 piece shrimp tempura and 4 piece veggie tempura. All that for about $9.50, easily enough for two people. It was pretty good. Not like back at home, but pretty good. the wife got a sushi roll, but it kept falling apart. Overall we enjoyed the food and would go back. IMHO, yoshi's has better teriyaki but this place is a good choice for the area"}
{"text":"Much too expensive for what it is. If I want to make it healthy with brown rice and white meat, my small bowl costs around $10. If I could add a salad for cheap (Tokyo Express used to have them for ten cents, but I'd be happy paying $1 for some iceberg lettuce and dressing), it would be a better deal."}
{"text":"I kind of love Yogis, the food is very consistent and I like the simplicity of the menu. I usually get the teriyaki and sushi/tempura combo and everything is delicious. I also really like the miso soup and it's a good deal."}
{"text":"Their Teriyaki is THE BEST! None better and my husband and I have eaten a lot of Chinese food over the years! The service is great and the food outstanding. I highly recommend. My husband won't go anywhere else!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here 100 times LOL. The cod, chicken plate, Edamame,  and egg rools are good. Food is consistent.  Service is A plus. Veey clean environment. Staff is quuck and friendly. 

California rolls are not good. Imitation crab centers with mayonnaise or some kind of sause is terrible. Not a fan of their soup either. But the vast majority of the food is great."}
{"text":"Fast and friendly service, sushi and edamame were great. Had the crazy tuna roll, enjoyed it!"}
{"text":"Restaurant is a bit dirty - feels dirty too (like the feeling when you're washing dishes with a dirt rag)... food is great though!! Love their portions."}
{"text":"This place is bad when it comes to their sushi!  It was warm, grey in color and a bad odor ... avoid this place for sushi products"}
{"text":"Most fresh and amazing teriyaki!! Whether you like chicken or beef this is the #1 spot for teriyaki!! I love it!!!!!!
The sushi rolls are amazing here too! Super delicious avocado roll and caterpillar roll!! 
It's a must go to if you haven't!! Service is fast and polite, with the great suggestions for you if you can't decide with what to get! Yum!!"}
{"text":"As for the food, nothing special.  The sauce was bland.  The food in general was rather unmemoriable.  They get an extra star for their awesome soda machine.  The reason I give so few stars is because advertised inside was a flyer inviting you to a talk about why Christianity is better than *YOUR* religion.  

This flyer was the ONLY flyer in the entire store.  It wasn't in some public posting board... it was taped to the wall next to the cash register and next to the bathroom door.

If I'm giving you money the last thing I need  is someone preaching at me. I can't stand proselytizing.  I won't do it.  I wont tolerate it from others in my faith.  I will not tolerate it from a business that wants my money.

I will not visit this establishment again."}
{"text":"If you're a lover of katsu or teriyaki chicken/beef, this is a great fast-food restaurant. The food is cooked after you place your order. The grill right behind the counter so you can see you food being cooked immediately.

Portion size is fairly large and they have a nice selection of lunch combos. I love that they have the sauces on the condiment bar so you don't have to ask for more sauce! 

Parking can be difficult since it's part of the Tempe Marketplace, but not a huge deal."}
{"text":"My coworker and I only had 30 minutes for lunch so we stopped by Yogi's for a quick bite. Unfortunately they told us that they were short staffed for the day and it would be a bit of a wait. We told the cashier that we were tight on time and within 7 minutes they made it happen and our delicious bowls were ready! I really appreciate the effort and speediness.

It was also my first time at Yogi's and I was pleasantly surprised at how tasty it was. It's only around $7 for a lunch combo: bowl and drink. This will be my go-to for a quick lunch. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Chicken teriyaki bowl and a side of edamame is always my go to, the guy on the register is always friendly"}
{"text":"Teriyaki bowls are one of those staples that I just can't live without. When I relocated to Arizona I instantly went on a hunt for a good local spot, enter Yogi's Grill. For the first month that I lived out here I thought this location was permanently shuttered because every time I tried to visit they were closed. Luckily one day I managed to make it during their operating hours! The bowls here are generous and the beef is delicious! I think the cleanliness, service and operating hours could be improved but I will definitely be a regular, I'm now officially a Yogi's fan!"}
{"text":"I eat here atleast once a week and it is INCREDIBLE! The staff is very friendly and knowledgeable, they make you feel right at home. The food is amazing and extremely affordable for all that you get!

For someone who is always trying to maintain a healthy lifestyle and eating habits, I love this place. Not only is it freshly cooked to order, it tastes delicious! 

Try it! You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"good place when you are on the go... great prices and good portions. the sushi rolls are huge! I really like their Arizona bowl  it reminds me of a Cali roll.... the pho soup for being fast food is pretty good too with plenty of veggies and meat...."}
{"text":"Fresh food. But rice is very sticky. I'm not a sticky rice fan.... white chicken breast terraki bowl with beef.. was good. . Chicken was more tender then beef."}
{"text":"This place is awful. Took 30 min to get a teriyaki bowl . The portions are much smaller then other locations. The place was smoky from the grill & by the time my order was called, it was cold."}
{"text":"Not my best visit to Yogi's. I thought they used white meat chicken but I guess you have to ask for it. Same with the white vs. brown rice. Veggies were not great - very little broccoli and lots of mushy zucchini, plus some huge carrots. I'll try it again but next time will remember to ask for white meat and brown rice."}
{"text":"This Yogis Grill is by far one of the best in Arizona. They were pretty quick with the chicken/beef order and sushi. The meat/rice is the top quality along with strong customer service.

Avocado roll is made perfectly. It was even satisfying how perfectly it was made. 

This Yogis Grill location definitely deserves its 4 stars. Go here when you're craving Japanese food."}
{"text":"I visited many different yogis grill and this location's chicken/beef is probably the worst out of all the ones I been to. 

Chicken - meat is cut way too big and undercooked
Beef - too dry/overcooked and hard to chew
Rice - overwhelming amount

Id stay away from this location's meat bowls and go to other yogis grill locations. This place is lacking flavor."}
{"text":"This Yogis grill location isn't as good as the other ones I've visited. Their chicken is very dry and their rice has a different taste, not in a good way. Other than that, they seem to have decent sushi rolls but I don't find myself coming to this particular restaurant again."}
{"text":"One of the best Yogi's Grill around with a whole remodeled interior! The food is always consistent and delivers the best chicken/beef bowl. Always will be looking forward to coming back."}
{"text":"The chicken teriyaki is super dry and has a weird taste to it, not sure what it is. The beef is also super hard to chew and overall the chicken and beef is not appetizing. There are better yogis spots. 

Sushi was okay though."}
{"text":"Good teriyaki chicken bowl for a decent price. They don't have the best spicy teriyaki sauce but it isn't bad. Glad this place is in the area and will be back for sure."}
{"text":"I know it might be a little rude to come in late to get food but we came in 10 min before 9 o clock and they said they were closed... Hmm don't post you close at 9 pm when you stop serving before that...say that you close at 8:50...thanks!

Didn't push to get served because we didn't want spit in our food.

Guess I'll never find out how the food here tastes like"}
{"text":"For being a Japanese-style \"grill\", Yogis is pretty good. There are several 'bowls' available including a Chicken Katsu and many beef flavored inspirations. Yogis rice bowls are offered in brown or white rice. You can add a popular spicy sauce that really adds a kick. Definitely a good eat for lunch.

The employees are very friendly and Michelle loves to smile. Yogis can customize orders to make them vegetarian or add a different sauce or ingredient. There is a pump for teriyaki sauce for those of you that like extra.

Yogis sits near a competing restaurant but they always seem busy during lunch. There is limited outside seating but plenty of seating inside. The tables and dispensers for food and condiments are kept neat and clean."}
{"text":"I got the teriyaki bowl and it was so delicious! The service was fast and the food was reasonably priced. Definitely recommend it here"}
{"text":"Went back here for lunch yesterday and didn't enjoy the meal nearly as much. Ordered a large veggie chicken bowl, California roll and a small fountain drink and it was $16 which is outrageous for a fast food. I can get chicken, California roll, gyoza, salad and soup and drink for $11 at a local sit down Japanese restaurant.

None of the food was enjoyable this time and I couldn't eat the California rolls as they were warm and didn't taste right. I only ate two and threw the rest away and my stomach was queasy the rest of the day which I'm assuming was from the roll.

I enjoyed this place the first time I went but this time I didn't enjoy any of it."}
{"text":"I eat here all the time. Great teriyaki chicken and friendly staff, quick service and clean restaurant."}
{"text":"After seeing the not so stellar reviews after we dined here, we flew back and tried Yogis Grill again.  We went before a Cubs spring training game and the place had a few folk dining there. We ordered the Chicken Teriyaki (with brown rice and veggies) the Avocado roll.  The Chicken Teriyaki was cut very thin and delicious.  The brown rice complimented the chicken and in all honesty, the steamed veggies were better than most restaurants we had frequented!

The Avocado rolls were their version of California Rolls with slices of Avocado on top of the rolls.  They weren't bad at all.  My wife and I couldn't figure out the bad ratings, but after trying the place out twice, we're fans of the establishment."}
{"text":"This place is perfect for a casual sit down lunch the food it always fresh and correct. The people are friendly and comfortable. My fav is the teriyaki  bowl, but I have yet to eat something there that isn't good... Located tucked away in the back of the shopping center makes it feel like your own little secret every time you go"}
{"text":"It was just okay. This wouldn't be my first option to return but possible return in a drunken stupor. Got the chicken and beef bowl. Little meat with tons of rice. Meat was dry with no flavor."}
{"text":"I have been eating here for a few weeks and have enjoyed every visit. While u have not tried everything on the menu, that which u have has been exquisite. I especially loved the beef udon."}
{"text":"Had one incident where I asked for a ramekin to take Sriracha home to dip my egg rolls in. The older gentlemen told me no, that I couldn't take the sauce home?? Doesn't make sense to me as a paying customer. I wanted to go today, and it says they are open until 9pm. We walked up to the door, all the lights were off, the door locked and the closed sign on. No sign stating why, but yet their hours say they  are open until 9pm? The food is great, but for the customer service, and not being open when their hours say they are, definitely not a restaurant I want to go too."}
{"text":"I was craving teriayaki chicken so bad. I seriously hadn't had it in years. I didn't even know of any around my place. Then, Yogi's appeared out of nowhere (OK, it's been there a while, I just didn't know it)!

YES!

I loved it! I will be back when the next craving hits me!"}
{"text":"My coworkers and I ordered Yogis for lunch. Since we are school teachers and do not have time to eat out,  we used Grubhub for delivery service. When 2 out of the 4 orders were completely wrong I called Yogis. My experience was the WORST EVER CUSTOMER SERVICE! The 1st phone call I tried to explain our order was wrong, but...Brian, the self proclaimed manager at the Yogis on Chandler and Kyrene, interrupted me and said \"No Grubhub, we don't do Grubhub!\" and hung up. I was so confused!??? After I double checked the location on my Grubhub receipt and verified I WAS calling the right Yogis I called back again.  I spoke with someone else who was very nice and said he was sorry and was trying to fix the situation for us.  HOWEVER... BRIAN got back on the phone and began yelling at me saying I needed to call GH because they were too busy! BRIAN HUNG UP ON ME AGAIN! I could not believe how I was being treated. Neither could the other teachers in the lounge overhearing my conversation on speaker phone. I was encouraged by a few coworkers to call back for a third time. Well instead of BRIAN choosing to listen to me and trying to fix their mistake (not Grubhub's mistake) he chose to not even let me finish the sentence, \"Can you please just listen to me?\" before he hung up for the third time.Needless to say, I will NEVER go back to this place ever again. Sorry you just can't treat your customers this way and expect return business."}
{"text":"To put it simply, calling this Japanese is insulting. It is a teriyaki place and they don't get that right. Corn syrup and sugar is not teriyaki sorry but no thanks. Also the staff is unfriendly and would rather stare at their cell phones then say hello. Won't be back."}
{"text":"The food was good (4 stars), but the help is unattentive & not customer oriented (2 stars).... so I'm giving this place 3 stars because I may return if nothing else sounds better.

Had the Chicken T&T plate (2 tempura veggies, 1 tempura shrimp, salad, 2 pcs of Cali Roll sushi, brown rice & teriyaki chicken)  $10."}
{"text":"This place is definitely fast food, nothing fancy. I went here with my mom and she ordered the CA roll. The sushi was not authentic at all. I ordered the noodle soup which was also not authentic at all. However, they have milk tea!! My favorite brand! The employees are very kind as well :). I suggest as far as the food goes, you guys should order meat, like teriyaki or BBQ, not sushi or soup."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite fast food restaurant! I've eaten here 4 times in 8 days. Everything is delicious. I would recommend the shrimp and vegetable tempura, potstickers, miso soup, chicken teriyaki plate, and egg rolls. My husband and I go to an expensive Japanese restaurant for our anniversary every year and I can honestly say this place is just as good and a third of the price."}
{"text":"I ate here recently for the first time after passing it by several times. I got the teriyaki chicken, tempura shrimp and california crunch roll. All of it was excellent. The dining area and service area looked very clean which bodes well for the kitchen. I would definitely eat here again. I may never eat at Panda express ever again. It is 100 times better."}
{"text":"Great quality food and made to order. The wait is not bad at all. I tried the beef and chicken plate with 2 shrimp tempura all for about $10. I'm thinking I'll be back tomorrow."}
{"text":"Yesterday afternoon, tried to stop in the open store for lunch. An employee said we were not welcomed there because we were wearing Trump supportive shirts. The outside seating was still there, the door was open and people were coming and going, but we were refused service. 
The manager posted that they were closed, and they were in the evening, however, he is incorrect that we were turned away. His employee refused us entrance, I have the pictures. Please do not make us post the pictures and please do not say it is not politics.  
I will never return to your store."}
{"text":"Good!  Tasty, healthy, status quo for teriyaki... my one and only complaint is that the portion of chicken I received was not quite what I have gotten at other places..."}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about this place. They have a good selection of both sushi and noodle bowls, various sauces and toppings (the standard sriracha as well as some which I haven't seen before), a selection of different iced teas (watermelon!), and outdoor seating with misters (which I find nice in the evening, especially around 7 pm). They also have a digital soda machine and a trendy, modern atmosphere. I ordered the spicy California Rolls and a veggie bowl with egg rolls and decided to try the spicy chili sauce and teriyaki sauce. The sushi was very, very delicious and so was the veggie bowl and egg rolls. The servers were kind and inviting and I will definitely come back to try more sushi!"}
{"text":"I love Yogis and on Saturday we made it our spot for lunch. I used to always come to this location and I remember it being good.. 

We walked in and it was starting to get busy. The cashier quickly helped us out and took our order. We ordered two specials that consist of a bowl and a medium drink for $8. We also ordered one miso soup! (The miso soup is delicious) 

Th soda machine was having issues. They only have one soda machine so you have to wait your turn. They were out of more then a few sodas so we had to improvise our drinks. The ice was also having issues and when it would come out, a while avalanche would come out.. 

We sat in the corner and our table was very sticky. The inside of the restaurant was very warm and the floors were dirty. The tables are so tight together that it feels like your sitting on top of other people..

Our number was called out and so we picked up our food at the front, after trying to walk through the maze of tables.. 

The miso soup was delicious and piping hot like it should be! My friend had the chicken and beef teriyaki bowl in which she said the beef was very chewy. My chicken bowl was sadly very dry and flavorless. The chicken was super dry :(

This is sadly not the location I remember it used to be. The food was not the same and the dining area wasn't clean."}
{"text":"Chicken teriyaki is great. Especially, with spicy sauce. Pay extra for all white meat."}
{"text":"I love going to Yogis Grill for lunch. They have one lunch special and its what I get everytime I go. Its chicken breast or beef with rice. I alwas upgrade to brown rice. You can get rice and vegetables or just vegetables with your protein (for low carb option). You can also ask for sauce on side. There are many more options as well. I occasionally like to order spring rolls or tempura shrimp. Sushi is also on the menu. There is fresh tea and coke beverages (with the special your meal comes with a drink). This place is usualy busy so make sure you give yourself plenty of time for lunch. The prices are pretty reasonable and the wait time isnt too long considering as busy as this place gets. All and all Yogis Grill is a great place to grab a quick refreshing lunch."}
{"text":"Always tastes fresh and they are super quick, I work  in the marketplace so I love stopping by here from time to time. The only reason I left four stars instead of five is because I've only ever tried one thing on the menu, teriyaki chicken bowl, (I'm a creature of habit haha) so I feel like I can't really judge the quality and taste of their other menu items. But I would definitely recommend this place"}
{"text":"Always come here for lunch. The rolls are a great size, bigger than other places I've been to."}
{"text":"Best crunch roll!
And if you're bulking,  get the large brown rice extra brown rice and extra chicken bowl!"}
{"text":"I won't be back. I finally decided to give this place a shot and there isn't one thing about I enjoyed. I got the chicken and beef teriyaki bowl and I was not a fan of the sauce, most of the meat was tough/fatty pieces and hard to chew. The rice was typical for a teriyaki bowl place."}
{"text":"Walked in 10 minutes before they close at 4pm on a Saturday and they said they're closed and refused to take an order. Fuck this place


Also the owner has now commented on this post a year later and didn't even read what I wrote. LOL"}
{"text":"Went for sushi and it was discolored and warm. If it wasn't caught before taking a bite I know I would have had food poisoning. The cashier was rude when I told her what the problem was with my food. Never coming again and I don't recommend this place to any one."}
{"text":"Bad service, so-so food.  They messed up my order and acted like it was no big deal.  Will not be going back."}
{"text":"Great place! not sure why a few people are posting lies about getting turned away! I was there for a long time waiting for some friends and enjoying the great food. Never saw anyone get turned away. I was wearing my Trump Support shirt and even had a nice conversation with the owner. Ill bet these guys are getting paid to post bad reviews for some reason or another. I noticed this place stayed open super late as well after everyone else closed. I'LL BE BACK!"}
{"text":"I didn't try the hot food but got a Rainbow Roll. The crab meat was horrific. It tasted like a chopped seafood salad you get at a supermarket -- or worse. It was $9.99 which is huge for a quicky place. Yuk, yuk, yuk. It's a hour later and I think it is finally time to go use some mouthwash. 

The place was pretty crowded so I imagine there is something good on the menu -- just not California rolls!"}
{"text":"It was my first time at Yogi's went because my boyfriend recommended it. I really enjoyed the food it was at a good price and satisfying. I would of gave it 5 stars but the reason why I didn't was the service I would give it a 1. We walked in and weren't even greeted the girl at the register was sitting down and as soon as we walked in she stood up. We were browsing through the menu on the wall and not once did she talk to us yet alone ask if we had questions. I would look over at her and she was on her phone the whole time. Finally got to order again no greeting no nothing. My order was then ready we got out and was taking selfies? It's disappointing to go to places where service is bad because you miss out on the great food. Other than that it was good."}
{"text":"Good food but the owner gentlemen at the front couldn't care less about my business.  Didn't say a single word. No hello no thank you. Not asking for it but at least greet your customer or say thanks. This has happened a few times. Common courtesy can go a long way. Not happening with this guy. There are a ton of other options for our family's money in the area. This will not be one of them any longer."}
{"text":"Pretty solid in the fast and easy category of food. My latest venture there produced white meat chicken yakisoba noodles and vegetables and a side of seasoned white rice which might have be free or at least uncharged. The sauce was spread evenly and the strips of chicken were plentiful. Veggies were mostly carrots with a few broccoli crowns. About 8 bucks before tax. Tried the new spicy sauce and yes it is spicy."}
{"text":"The food was really tasty I'm often picky about my teriyaki cause I'm from Seattle and I think we have great teriyaki but I will definitely come back here"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant! Swift service and consistent quality make it a favorite for myself and my family. Must try the Gyoza (pot stickers) and spring rolls. Delicious!"}
{"text":"Great food, super clean restaurant and it is run like a tight ship! Awesome employees!"}
{"text":"My chicken was pink. My husband went to exchange it for beef and was told by the guy who worked there that it wasn't raw, it is pink because when they bake it, it sits in blood. Wow, that is disgusting. Hopefully wrong but still disgusting. Not once did he say \"sorry\" or \"can I get you something else\". We will not be returning."}
{"text":"I went in here thinking it was going to be the normal fast casual experience, but was pleasantly surprised with the service and food. John was extremely helpful with getting me the best happy hour food at the best happy hour price. I left full and very satisfied. I'll be visiting this location again soon!"}
{"text":"Not bad today!!! Been here a few times sometimes the teriyaki chicken is too charred and the beef teriyaki is tough. Tonight I gave it another try and tried the Yakisoba with chicken & veggies. Looks delicious! Not bad at all!"}
{"text":"All of the staff were sitting in the dining area and hanging out. After a few minutes one finally came over to ring us up. Ten minutes passed until an employee noticed that our order had been sitting on the counter ready to be delivered to the table, but since the employees were just hanging out in the waiting area, they didn't notice it was ready. The sushi was WARM, and smelled extremely fishy (if you've ever had sushi, you'd know it's not supposed to smell...)
When we told the female employee at the register that we would like our rolls to be re-made, she continued to argue with us saying that the food \"is fine.\" I don't know who manages this place, but the owner should definitely find a new store manager. The fact that ALL of the employees, including the cook we're hanging out in the seating area, and not paying attention to PAYING customers, speaks loudly of their poor employee training and development."}
{"text":"The chicken wasn't as flavorful as I had hoped so for that I would've given two stars but the amount of vegetables they give with the teriyaki bowl bumped it up to three. I loved that the veggies wasn't just steamed cabbage. It was cabbage, broccoli, carrots and squash! White meat and brown rice are extra. They do give a good portion of chicken though. And the sauce they give you is flavorful."}
{"text":"This place is just okay. The food isn't bad but it isn't super delicious either. They have sushi, teriyaki chicken and beef bowls, and udon. Their teriyaki sauce is good, but nothing special. To be honest, I would come here if I was in the mood for some teriyaki bowls but I would probably get it to-go. The rice is good, they just need to cook it a little more or add more water because when I came here, it was kind of hard. The staff was nice and friendly."}
{"text":"Always delicious and piping hot. Service is always great. The udon soup is outstanding and filling. If you haven't tried udon soup this would be the right place to. They always have a special on a sushi roll and everyone is awesome."}
{"text":"It PAINs me to write this review.. I have been here 20+ times and enjoyed it, but tonight was different.  The Absolute WORSE tough and fatty chicken I have ever had.. anywhere.  Sorry Yogi's this was horrible, I could not eat any of it... I don't know if I can return after the experience tonight.  Careful with your next bite."}
{"text":"Nothing to write home about. The food is okay but skip this place if you want something with flavor. The sushi is subpar and the bowls aren't delicious."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place for rice bowls. Always fresh and delicious. Teriyaki sauce is amazing !"}
{"text":"be careful, my wife's card was hacked after her visit here. I emailed them and they said check your card company.  She had said the girl rang up the wrong thing then tried to have her pay for it as well."}
{"text":"Just okay. My chicken katsu was overcooked and oily."}
{"text":"Stopped in for my first visit today and it was awesome!  I had veggie tempura, a very flavorful miso soup and their specialty roll which was hot and tasty.  The restaurant is clean and service is fast, and this is probably the best Asian food in all of Tempe town marketplace. John helped me out today and made some pretty good recommendations.  I love this place and I'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"The management and staff here are so incredibly rude I will literally drive miles away just to go to a different location. It was a fight tooth and nail to get a refund two weeks later for food that was made incorrectly due to deathly food allergies and multiple warnings."}
{"text":"Food is awesome, but the time it takes to get your food is another story. Three meals took 40 minutes."}
{"text":"We grabbed a quick bite at Yogi's tonight. We were all feeling a bit down. The batter on the tempura veggies was not bad, but not spectacular either. However, the dipping sauce was flavorful and had a nice tang. My son enjoyed his tempura shrimp crunch roll. The serving was generous, and he enjoyed his meal."}
{"text":"Heathy clean food, clean establishment.  Great fast heathy food.  Would highly recommend and I will return."}
{"text":"Good basic Japanese fast food. Good quality and fresh. I usually get the standard teriyaki chicken.   If you need a quick bite at lunch or dinner, and crave some kind of Japanese bowl, this is a decent place."}
{"text":"Yogis is amazing! I will definitely be back to this joint! Chicken yakisoba is delicious! Plus they'll give you 2 free egg rolls for checking in! Awesome customer service too!"}
{"text":"I've slowly started to come back around to this place on occasion.. Seems like they have better quality control lately.  The staff is always friendly and the food usually comes pretty quickly.  I will continue to visit this place on the regular."}
{"text":"I love this place! I Uber eat it all the time! I sometimes go there and eat. The service is great and they always get my order perfect!"}
{"text":"Been here twice in the last 2 days- and the food was excellent! The service was fast and Chase & Jason were very nice! I would definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"Fast service and very consistent with food taste and preparation. Call in service for to go orders is also very consistent."}
{"text":"Very good food as long as you get white meat. I just get a basic teriyaki bowl spicy with white meat and it's one of my favorite places. I go at least twice a week. The steamed vegetables are pretty bland but if you are like me you put teriyaki sauce on everything anyway so it is not so bad."}
{"text":"The resterant is always clean and the food is good. Recently they made some changes in personal and the new people are awesome and care about thier job. Especially Chelsea!"}
{"text":"Horrible service, waited 15+ min and the food was cold. She was reluctant to even cook it again and would not refund the meal.  Not impressed."}
{"text":"Typically I thought of this place as a 3/5 because it's easy and quick food to pick up. Average food.

I think they changed ingredients or something because their yakisoba tastes so much better! 

Plus they updated their menu."}
{"text":"Foods here is always good, definitely recommend the avocado salad, pot stickers, and spicy tuna roll. This'd location however took forever to get our food and wasn't that busy. It took us just around a half hour to get a teriyaki bowl and yakisoba bowl"}
{"text":"I've noticed that majority of the people who eat at this specific location are the people who work in downtown coming in for lunch. Do yourself a favor and come here over any other food options in downtown.
Like most places in downtown, it will be busy but you'll be able to come in and out of here quicker than any other place guaranteed. If you get the lunch special and pair a chicken/beef teriyaki bowl plus drink it should take you 5 minutes max from the time you walk in to the time you're out of there with your food.
Best option to go to especially if you're in a rush.
Not underestimating the food either, it's really good with a big menu"}
{"text":"Fast, clean, delicious. Service is professional, quick, and, dependable. We like the choose-your-own-flavor Soda Machine, and, Siracha located at each table."}
{"text":"Storefront restaurant. Upon entree noticed booths and tables. Walls decorated with various Asian food specialties. Menu is fairly large with many healthy choices. I came for Teriyaki. Decision was what protein to chose as both seafood, chicken,beef, tofu or veggie options. Rice or noodle bowls. Two size bowls and a plate option. Decide small bowl since I wanted to sample other items. Went with chicken and beef veggie bowl over steamed white rice. They serve sushi and it is made to order. After several questions on the rolls I settled with Salmon roll. 
I also went with one of several salad offerings. Cucumber salad. Sounds like a lot right?  Just ran 6 miles so I was hungry. They have a spicy teriyaki sauce and a traditional. Both are house recipes. So here's what I thought. Bowl nicely presented with broccoli and carrots and Asian cabbage. Mix of chicken and beef. The taste was good. Fresh made to order. I had a side of the spicy sauce and dipped my veggies. Protein was diced and sliced. Nice flavor. 
Salmon roll. Surprised that it looked and tasted good. No special sauce. Just wasabi n ginger. Pickled. The cucumber salad was large and nicely julienned. Nice seasoning. Meal was brought to the table. They do have wifi so I sat in a booth and worked online. 
For a storefront it is good. For a quick meal good. 
Music loud. Service good.  Btw the food bill with bottle water about $24."}
{"text":"I am so disappointed! It is way overpriced compared to the quality and the quantity of the food. The only good thing is the service. Employees are friendly and polite."}
{"text":"Not only is the food really good (get anything with teriyaki) but they were super fast. I went there with some co-workers for a quick lunch and before I could even get my drink, the food was ready to go. They even had a vegetarian option for one of my co-workers."}
{"text":"Worst experience there ever!  I go there at least once a week on my lunch break and have never had to wait in line and get my food for more then 15 minutes.  Today was the worse and I will never go back due to the horrible customer service.  There was no line and I ordered my food, the lunch special.  After 15 minutes of waiting it looked my food was ready and put on the ledge between the kitchen and the counter.  10 minutes later it was still sitting there and the cook actually had to put a lid on it to keep it warm.  I told the cashier I would like my food please and she said hold on and continued to organize her receipts....after two people after me get their food I asked for my money back since I have now been waiting 25 minutes.  The cashier was unapologetic even after I twice said I just really wanted my food which was still sitting right behind her.  Instead she just gave me my money back."}
{"text":"The food is of decent quality and relatively inexpensive. It is a typical  Asian-fast-food  joint, so don't expect anything fancy. Location is convenient (Camelback Colonnade area), and parking is ample."}
{"text":"Love yogis! Good costumer service, Kayla is awesome! And great food for good price! Definitely would keep coming back!"}
{"text":"for a fast food joint it is pretty good. they keep the place decently clean and immediately wipe down tables for you to sit down at. they are quick to make the chicken bowls if you are in a rush and allow for call in orders ahead of time. i really like that they do not drench the order with sauce but allow for extra sauce on the side if you want. you can also get the spicy sauce which i find delicious. there is parking because it is located inside a big strip mall. the cashier was smiling. i come back here on occasion if i want something fast."}
{"text":"I came here tonight with a friend about thirty minutes before closing, had we known we would be rudely asked to leave AT closing we would have gone elsewhere. A sufficient five minute notice would have been great, but the lady rudely interrupted our conversation and said that they were closed, and then asked if we needed to go containers.  I will NOT recommend this restaurant to anyone anymore.  I'll spend an extra few $$ and go back to Kabuki.  RUDE!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been fans of Yogis Grill for years!  He introduced me to this establishment when we started dating.  I really loved it!  But lately, in the last few months, we noticed it doesn't taste the same and sadly, we probably won't come back anytime soon.

The taste isn't simply the same and the quality seemed to take a hit.  We also noticed our food wasn't hot as well.  The prices seem to have gone up too.  While it was busy the night we went, that shouldn't be the culprit.  I am kind of sad that my husband, who spoke so highly of this place, also felt the same way.

I ordered the beef and veggie bowl while he had the combo with veggies, beef, and chicken.  It tasted almost bland and had a ton of sauce to mask it.  I don't know if they changed owners, but the taste is different here. Also, had the California roll, which was just ok, typical. 

Overall, I would say this place is ok and something I will not go out of my way to have.  I just wish Flame Broiler would come to North Phoenix already."}
{"text":"New management and they truly care how I got serviced. Thanks again and everyone was pleasant and food was great."}
{"text":"This location of yogis is the best in the area. We have to make sure and eat here at least one time a month."}
{"text":"This is my first time visiting this place. Food taste is ok but. It warm enough to enjoy the food. However, their customer service is horrible. I brought a glass for water since I don't drink soda and not sure why I took less than a an ounce of sonda just to taste it. The cashier came to me right away and said- \"you need to throw the soda away and pay for it I. Extremely rude to\". I requested her if she can give another glass for water she told me that, \"you can come get if if you want, I can't come and give it you\". Everyone in the restaurant was looking at me and my wife. So embarrassing... NEVER COMING BACK!!!"}
{"text":"I ordered to go here upon the request of the ladies I work with. I was surprised that the sushi was pretty good. Not a bad price for good sushi. I would rather go here than the rotating sushi place down the street. I also ordered tempura udon. It was pretty good for takeout. I would go back.  I like that they have other options too so I can take my husband who doesn't like sushi. :)"}
{"text":"Usually it is very good food and service. Tonight was a different story. Ordered 2 8-pc crunch rolls, took it home and found they forgot to put ginger and Wasabi for both to-go boxes. Called and asked about it and I got a \"my bad, we'll try not to do that next time\". Please pay more attention on customer orders!"}
{"text":"This review is no reflection on the food but the fact that their site is not up to date. I drove 15 min out of the way to come here because it said (online) they were open. There was a sign on the door saying they will be closed on Sundays starting Jan. 2017. Very inconvenient."}
{"text":"Impeccable customer service from the workers. Very fresh food and the place is very clean. This is my sons favorite food. We will continue to come."}
{"text":"love love love! Been going here since I moved to Chandler about 2 years ago! The mangers were nice and we're hiring I applied was hired in the middle of 2014 to focus on school! then left returned towards the end Markus the manager was so nice I memorized people's orders, would talk to everyone.. Love it! Markus is very very very clean to the T! The back people always wear gloves and he try's his best to make everyone happy!! Now I wanted to write back to LOGAN L down below... Hi:) that's was me helping you first being new im sure you didn't know but I didn't make your order to go EVERY PLATE WE MAKE IS IN A TO GO PACKAGE... So hopefully that didn't bum you out to bad. :) second I'm in no position to give away free food nor do I make the food I only take your order and your money :) so the shrimp tempura option was a kind gesture from my manager at the time! Me being me I feel like you wouldn't have known you were missing a shrimp BUT THATS JUST Me! Third every yakisoba plate comes with rice, we didn't just chose you to give out rice.. Lol the back staff are always always ALWAYS Required to wear gloves when touching food and never once did I see different... The hair you saw on the floor was not in your food and going off your negative post I'm sure even if I had asked to get the hair from under your table that wouldn't make you happy! Just to be clear! Good day!"}
{"text":"The food is delicious but there is always hair on my sushi rolls. This happened twice. The to-go orders take long. You'll still be sitting 20 minutes when you get there to pick it up. The girl at the counter is very rude. I've told several of my friends and family to never visit this location. It took this experience happening to me twice to learn this is not the place to go anymore. Horrible experience."}
{"text":"Took my daughter here to impress her. On 5/17/18, we ate there at approximately 4:10 p.m. My daughter had fried tofu on white rice and steamed vegetables. The tofu was fine, but the steamed veggies had a long black hair in it! I took it back up to the counter to complain. The cashier at the counter had jet black hair and a huge nose ring. She was a \" goth\" as my daughter described her. She saw the hair and said, \"So i guess you don't want it?!!\" No genius, please hold the head and pubic hair, I'm trying to cut back!!! What an absolute moron. This is the second Asian restaurant(Kwans)that served my daughter pubic hair in her food. WTF!!! Please kill me now.......I just want people to know, I tried to talk to any manager to resolve the issue, but the cashier is running interference for him/her. What can I say, eat there if you want, just ask themc to hold the pubes!!!"}
{"text":"This place was a great place to take my kids. My sons eat all of their kids teriyaki beef bowl. And it came with a drink for $6.29. I got the lunch special which was the regular sized chicken and beef bowl plus a drink for $8.29. The large beef and chicken teriyaki bowl was $8.29. 
I really enjoy the flavor of their teriyaki sauce. This isn't my first time here, it won't be my last."}
{"text":"It's a convenient location for me due to it being right inside Tempe Marketplace. Typically I order the Teriyaki Chicken bowl or plate and have liked it on each visit. The prices for the food are also very reasonable and I like the way they grill their meats. The food also comes very quickly after I ordered, well at least for me anyway.

I did see some negative reviews on here mainly about the service, but have not had a negative experience in regards to that. Yeah it can get a little rushed in here but that doesn't bother me much."}
{"text":"King of over cooked chicken. Got a teriyaki chicken bowl one day, the chicken is over cooked and dry. Another day i try the chicken Katsu and it is even more dried out then the chicken teriyaki. This place is not cheap so one would expect good food. I barely ate half of each meal just to fill me up. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"Absolutely cannot get enough of their teriyaki chicken!! It's sooo good!! So much better than Panda Express! I wish I could afford to eat here everyday! 

Pretty affordable for the amount of food you get. Mine usually lasts me 2 meals! Always get extra green onion on your teriyaki bowl! It's just so yummy  

Staff is always friendly & food is prepared SUPER FAST!! Even togo's are 5 min pickup time! 

OH and don't forget your stamp card!!!"}
{"text":"This place is great for a quick lunch. They have several different options that are sure to please everyone. The chicken teriyaki bowl is my usual there and if you like your food with a little spice be sure to try it with the spicy teriyaki sauce. John will usually get the beef and chicken bowl and then order one of their sushi rolls as well. Yogis Grill also offers you the option to have brown rice too if you are trying to take a healthier approach. Overall I enjoy this place when I am looking for a good quick lunch."}
{"text":"Great  place for sushi rolls, noodles, teriyaki, and tempura.   We have tried several rolls (salmon, tuna, California), chicken and beef Udon noodles, and the chicken Yakisoba, and all have been quite good.   The restaurant itself, is nice very modern casual dining; however our family being on the go, we usually call ahead and order take-home for dinner or lunch.   Even though Mikado and The Sushi Room are our favorites for formal Japanese dining in our local area when special occasions or time allows,this fills the an empty spot in our rotation of casual eating ( a level somewhere in amongst Native New Yorker, Old Chicago, Panda Express, Chick-fil-a, Red Robin,Chipotle, etc). Very glad this has popped up close to home"}
{"text":"We have gone to this location just about every month since it opened. The food quality has gone down tremendously unfortunately. Chicken is dry, salmon over cooked and once my shrimp tempura was gray and spoiled on the inside. Yuck!! Switched to the Mesa river view location, much higher quality food preparation."}
{"text":"I have tried 2 other yogis and this is by far the best. My salmon was cooked perfectly and the service was fast and friendly. The teriyaki beef was also delicious!"}
{"text":"Panda what?! It's all about Yogis Grill from now on when we need a quick sushi or teriyaki fix! This location is right next to another great place (Lucky Lou's) and the service was quick and friendly. I find places like Panda Express and Pei Wei too crowded and not that Yogis is dead but it's quieter so we can take our time. They do have lunch specials and you can definitely call in orders (four people just did that while we were there). I'm looking forward to going back and trying one of their tempura dishes!"}
{"text":"Our son got sick: My wife and son and I ate here. She got chicken and beef bowl, I got chicken and veggies. Service was okay.. just doing their jobs I guess and no one was smiling. The food seemed okay but was nothing warranting a return visit. That night around midnight my son got sick and threw up all the chicken he ate from our plates.. then threw up again an hour later.. then again three hours after that. This morning he had bad diarrhea once, then two more times not as bad. He is fine now, thank God. My wife and I both had upset stomachs most of the night but we are fine. Obviously we'll never be back. The only saving grace was that some managers were having a meeting while we were there and they all politely thanked us as we left."}
{"text":"Walk in to the counter girl didn't even acknowledge that I was there. She was to busy playing around with here cell phone texting. She was leaning against the counter facing my direction. I had to say HELLO to get her to put down her phone.
Food isn't memorable and I'm sitting here right at the table in the restaurant writing this."}
{"text":"I love the terriyaki chicken bowl (small)   I can't get enough of the sauce. It's so good! Their sushi rolls are also really good. The atmosphere is just so - so. They are usually pretty fast at getting your food out. I like to go here when I'm short on time for lunch. Ask them for a punch card. After 10 purchases you get a free bowl."}
{"text":"Good food preparation and flavor. I live closer to the rio Salado location but the food is sooo terrible there that I make the trek out to river view. Food is made quickly and the service is good. Minuses one star bc of the distance from where I live."}
{"text":"Well, I guess I could start by saying I was very pleased with the food it tasted Great , I got the lunch special chicken teriyaki bowl. I was very happy until I noticed my rice bowl moving and noticed it was worms or maggots of some sort !!!! Yes this really happened !!!!! I was DISGUSTED !!!"}
{"text":"This place has something for meat eaters & vegans alike! I always get the tofu cutlet veggie bowl. The portion is generous & they don't skimp on the veggies. A lot of places like this give you a few veggies & mostly rice but not here.

They also have chicken rice bowls & a mix of other items. 

The staff is always super nice , the restaurant is clean, & I will continue to come back!"}
{"text":"Beef teriyaki is underwhelming, actually I didn't like it at all.  It didn't taste fresh and it was so sweet I couldn't even identify that it was beef.  Would have been better off with a TV dinner.

My husband on the other hand views this place as a good option when running errands in the area because it's \"fast and cheap\".  Well, I don't know about either of those, they aren't fast food fast or cheap but it certainly tastes like it."}
{"text":"Just had dinner for the family.  Teriyaki meals all good portions fresh made.  Nice staff (owners) clean restaurant and killer soda machine.  I'd recommend as good value."}
{"text":"Nice staff & reasonably fast service with many many choices will ensure that even a picky eater will find something.  We watched as our chicken was grilled fresh.  I would say that this place is a notch above the typical mall food place but still falls into the \"food court\" category.  They have Good prices 2.  Worth a try."}
{"text":"The food is really good. I had the Teriyaki Chicken Bowl, Spicy California Rolls, and some Miso soup and it all tasted really good. The food came out really fast. Would give it 4 stars but all the tables were dirty and needed to be wiped down and there was food on the floor."}
{"text":"Every time I've gone to this location I've had issues with the different employees each time. I understand that customer service in the food industry can be difficult but the first person who I see as a customer is your cashier. But every time I walk in they shouldn't be rude and it shouldn't  be obvious that they hate their job. The female cashier (whose name I didn't get) has been rude to me when I've gone in to get food. On other occasions male employees (whose name I didn't get) have been rude as well. I'm only looking to improve customer satisfaction because I do enjoy the food."}
{"text":"Looking for something quick that wasn't McDonald or Chik fil A we tried Yogis. We ordered two chicken teriyaki rice bowls and one chicken and beef bowl. The chicken was good but I didn't really care for the beef. What I did like about this place is they have large bottles or both their teriyaki and their spicy teriyaki sauce so you can add more. Be warned when ordering the large bowl it is a lot of food. I took home a whole meal there was so much food. They have a decent selection of rice bowls, noodle bowls, and sushi so there is something for everyone.

They also have a couple neat Japanese sodas we bought a grape soda to try that was pretty go down and some Hi Chew candy for later."}
{"text":"Food was borderline satisfactory & service was horrible. I ordered a teriyaki bowl, miso soup & large drink. I asked if I could get my teriyaki 5-10 minutes after my soup so it won't get cold while I'm enjoying my soup course. I asked this because in past visits they would arrive at the same time.  They arrived at the same time again. 

I also informed them that they were out of iced tea. They didn't seem to care. An hour later, still no tea. They made no effort to make tea. It takes 5 minutes to brew tea."}
{"text":"Love this place for sushi on the go.  Prices are reasonable and their food is always fresh and delish.  Teriyaki bowls are good.  Chicken katsu is good too. Love the Las Vegas roll,  crunch roll, spicy tuna roll, and caterpillar roll."}
{"text":"Really fast service, I did not even have time to get my drink before my order was delivered. Very friendly staff. As usual, bought more of their teriyaki sauce to take home. I like the way that they garnish the bowls with scallions. Some of the other locations leave this out."}
{"text":"Excellent lunch specials. I love their teriyaki sauce so much, I always buy one to take home!"}
{"text":"Yogis grill is by far one of my favorite sushi places to go to!  I'm a really picky eater and the food is never disappointing. The customer service is awesome and John is always friendly and helpful! If you haven't gone you should, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I ate yesterday and spent time in the middle of night being sick! I had Shrimp Tempura and rice. My daughter and grandson had chicken teriyaki (?). they did not get sick, I suspect cross contamination! Please be careful this is the first time I ever felt ill after eating here! Be careful please."}
{"text":"Best chicken teriyaki boxl in Chandler!  I wish they were open Sundays but I understand everyone needs a day off."}
{"text":"I am really surprised Yogis rated so low. The food is always fresh and the rolls are a great value. The girls that work the register could benefit from service training, but it's fast food. What do you expect? If you want good service, go to RA or Stingray. If I'm in a rush during the workday and don't want to go through a greasy drive thru, I can be found here!"}
{"text":"Beware the sushi...Not only is the rice extremely dry, but something about the fish is off (for the salmon, tuna, and eel). Honestly, the premade sushi you can buy from your local supermarket is better than this and definitely fresh."}
{"text":"This place has the rudest staff ever even to asked for a sauce was such a difficult task for them to get."}
{"text":"I had the small teriyaki chicken bowl and the little guava Hawaiin drink as usual. The food was pretty good but the service was slow."}
{"text":"Love this place. The chicken undon and teriyaki bowls are amazing! Great amount for the large portions!"}
{"text":"I am only giving this establishment a 1 because the cashier/server blew/picked her nose and then preceded to hand out food without washing her hands!!!  (fortunately we received our food before that!!)"}
{"text":"Great service and good food at a reasonable price. Highly recommend. Don't believe the reviews from the guys at the Trump rally. They were looking for an excuse to be angry. There's more to the story, but they saw what they wanted to see. It was a confusing night with threats of protests and riots. The folks at Yogis did the best they could given the circumstances, which turned out to be better than what most places were able to do. Don't let a couple of guys who were looking for a reason to be angry sway you from eating here. It's a great place. Also, bring your Trump hat, or Hilary, or Bernie, or whatever. We can all enjoy good food together."}
{"text":"This is my favorite location. We come here every Thursday after our little ones have swim lessons. We call it in at Riverview and by the time we get to Tempe Marketplace, it is ready to go.

The staff here seem to care more about the food and your time. At Riverview I'm ALWAYS left waiting well beyond the approximate time the order is ready, and Shea is a joke.

The food is always hot, cooked well, and it travels well."}
{"text":"Was good ordered a large chicken bowl and it was delicious. A little pricey but I think it was worth it. Big plates. Have to pay extra for vegtables."}
{"text":"Yogis Grill is a fun and healthy place for a great lunch, with lots of options and combinations to choose, from their extensive menu. 

Our little lunch group comes here twice a month and at this point we've tried almost everything on the menu (see photo). We haven't found anything we do not like. And more importantly, the Sushi is very Fresh. 

I tend to order the Spicy Tuna Roll for $7.99, but recent I've switched to the Spicy Tuna Salad for $9.48 (see photos) with Avocado. Others in our group go for the Miso Soup ($1.99), California Roll ($5.79) and the Chicken & Beef Bowl ($8.39).  All were good. 

On our last trip, I had the Póke which was delicious. Expect to pay $11.00 with a soft drink."}
{"text":"My favorite teriyaki place. I had an issue with the one of the staff one time but I expressed my concern to one of the supervisors and it never happened again. This place is cheap, convenient  and yummy - love it!"}
{"text":"Food is always excellent and is prepared very quickly. A really good experience every time that I've been there."}
{"text":"I like the chicken bowls. Not a fan of sea food so I can't review the sushi. Being from CA AZ is lacking in the Asian food department. This place is a lot like Flame Broiler which I kinda missed.  All in all the sauce is good and the chicken is white meat."}
{"text":"The chicken teriyaki bowl was delicious. It was a generous portion of chicken grilled right in front of you and the teriyaki sauce was so good, I could swim in it. Great food, great price, and super friendly service from John & the crew. I'll be back! :-)"}
{"text":"Used to be very good a couple years ago. Now if you go and order a crunch roll you will be lucky to get it in 20 minutes. Sad to see it go downhill with the service. But this will be my last time eating there for a while. Actually just edited this. Waited over 30 minutes just for a crunch roll. Got my money back and left. Very disappointing. The Mexican food right next door is great though! That's where I ended up going"}
{"text":"Go for the all white meat chicken teriyaki. I love their sauce and its always consistent. Plus I love all the crazy drinks they have in the cooler."}
{"text":"Fast and friendly. The low carb chicken broccoli bowl is a healthy option I like to get all the time."}
{"text":"NOT my favorite location. Every time I call in an order I am told 10 minutes and end up waiting for 20.  The food is sloppy, not always as hot as I think it should be, and I always feel like the counter staff would prefer to be ANYwhere else but at work."}
{"text":"I've been to a lot of Yogi's locations...most of them in the east valley. But now that I've moved to Phoenix, I've had to adjust and try this location. Big mistake. This is seriously the worst location I've ever been to. It was dirty, the food took forever to make (I had a to-go order), and the food actually made me sick when I got home. I'm super bummed out because this is one of my favorite restaurants, but I won't be returning to this location."}
{"text":"This location is my go-to location. It's super close and convenient for me. I've never had any issues when I come here. They are very consistent with the food. My favorites from the menu are the beef teriyaki bowl, the shrimp tempura udon soup, the crunch roll (absolutely amazing), and the edamame. I'm a very picky eater and I like that Yogi's doesn't do all the unnecessary add ins in their food. So delicious! Only criticism I have for this location is that the employee on the register always seems to have a little bit of an attitude or something. This isn't a typical \"restaurant\" setting, so it doesn't bother me that much, but it's a tad annoying."}
{"text":"It was just OK. Nothing too exciting about it. I had a couple sushi rolls and they were kind of overpriced for the quality. Probably won't be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"I reserve that 5th star for an establishment that rocks my world. However, a 4 star review on a concept like Yogis is a BIG compliment. 

I may or may not be addicted to the #23 Beef and Chicken combo with spicy sauce. It's super good, very filling and doesn't leave me with the regrettable feeling of most Asian food places I frequent. You know the one...it was so good but you're going to spend the afternoon regretting it! 

I feel great after a meal here, which means good fresh ingredients and no msg. 

Staff is always friendly, place is always spotless, good is consistent. It's as good as you'll get without going authentic."}
{"text":"This is my go to lunch place if I'm in the area. Quick and mostly healthy. I get the steak and chicken veggie bowl with brown rice. I really appreciate that they are not skimpy with the veggies and they are fresh!"}
{"text":"This location is always busy and the girl that works at the cash register is super nice and very attentive to the customers and I love the chicken bowl with vegetables"}
{"text":"Was so excited to have a yogis close to home. Love the food! Hard for me to find decent Japanese food but this is yummy (for being fast food). Been here 4 times. Terrible customer service. I guess being welcoming is not a high priority. Also, this location will not let you use yogis gift certificates. They say because they are a franchise. Hmmm...."}
{"text":"The best quick teriyaki bowls that I've had in the area. I always order ahead so I don't have t"}
{"text":"Try the chicken and beef teriyaki bowl - spicy!! I cannot decide which is better the chicken or beef! Thank god there's a chicken and beef option! :)"}
{"text":"Love this place - I go here for lunch at least once a week. Efficient, affordable and it's not too much of a pain to park (now keep in mind that I'm speaking in relative terms because this is Camelback.) 

Love the chicken bowls and the arizona bowl. An extra star because they have REAL brewed iced tea. 

Also - love the fact that they write your number on your cup and bring the food to you. So much nicer than waiting to hear your number called, etc. 

Pleasant service always."}
{"text":"Good food for a fast food place, quality of food beats most other similar restaurants."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time, ordered the spicy tuna roll and shrimp tempura, the food was okay, my sushi rice had good flavor and it was soft and not hard but it kept falling apart while I was eating it, (didn't roll tight enough), my tuna in my roll tasted more of sesame oil then tuna, the tuna was bland, and didn't seem fresh at all, overall the only thing I liked was the shrimp tempura, and the service was fast since I was the only one there. I probably won't be coming back personally."}
{"text":"Finally a teriyaki bowl place that does it right.  Nothing against Samuri Sam's, but Yogis is a bit better in my opinion.  Yogis'  menu is strait forward and clearly lists the options available.  The place is clean and the staff is fast and friendly.  The food is also very reasonably priced.  I was very impressed with their different bowl/plate/salad options.  You are able to order some teriyaki veggies, chicken and/or beef pretty much however you want it.  Extra meat, over lettuce, over veggies, brown rice, white rice, etc.  

Anyway, when I visit a place like this my desires are simple.  I want a decent portion of not-overly-sauced white meat chicken over a bunch of veggies.  That's it.  Yogis delivers this and then some."}
{"text":"Took them 21 minutes to give me 4 eggrolls. THE WORST customer service I've ever experienced. Do yourself a favor and do not come here"}
{"text":"I ordered the Arizona bowl and a side of egg rolls. The egg rolls seemed mushy and the Arizona bowl was kind of bland if it wasn't for the sriracha I put on it. Next time I will go with a meat option!"}
{"text":"Great sushi!  All of the food was amazing in taste and freshness. I will definitely be back!  

I really don't get why, even if you dine in, all of the food is served in styrofoam to-go dishes. Very wasteful and tacky for dine-in eating. I would have rate them 5 stars if this wasn't the case."}
{"text":"The food is great here and portions are large enough to share. Not a 5 star but a solid choice any time."}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken and beef teriyaki bowl with white meat and spicy teriyaki sauce. The first thing I noticed was that the sauce seemed more like hot sauce than teriyaki - if there was any teriyaki in there, it was covered up pretty well by the spicy sauce. Not a bad thing - this sauce was good, just not what I was expecting.

The chicken and beef were both pretty decent - and the rice was fine. The little green onions on top actually made a difference - gave the bowl a little extra flavor.

I prefer Samurai Sam's for fast teriyaki, but I'd probably rank my meal at Yogis ahead of Tokyo Express and Yoshi's."}
{"text":"I always get the Chicken and Beef with Brown Rice bowl when I go here. I love it.  Its a bit pricey, but I believe its worth the price."}
{"text":"First time at this location. I always get the chicken and beef bowl. Other locations include green onions in it. This location doesn't as I noticed after I came home with my order. Bummer"}
{"text":"Tried Yogis Grill for the first time around 3:30 & there were no customers. Was greeted by the cashier, who just got off her cell phone. The rest of the staff looked like zombies...no emotion or enthusiasm whatsoever.  Was seriously wanting to walk out, but thought I would give them a chance.  Saw they had our favorite roll...Vegas roll. Normally made with salmon, cream cheese, avocado, & cucumbers...fried & then drizzled with teriyaki sauce.  It was $8, but they charge an extra $2 for salmon...c'mon man, really? I don't mind paying $10 for a GOOD sushi roll, but there was barely any salmon and sadly no cucumbers.
The roll is 8 pieces & as you can see, it's nothing special.  The taste ranks as the worst Vegas roll we ever had! This place is way over priced & is a wannabe Japanese restaurant. 
Please do yourself a favor, avoid this place like zombies."}
{"text":"We went for dinner on Mother's Day Sunday.  We knew they closed soon but they still reminded us when we ordered.  Ok, I get it... eat quickly.  The food came out quite quickly.  The iced tea was awful, I poured it out.  I don't drink soda so my other options were limited.  While we were eating, they started hard core cleaning out the place, pulling tables out, putting all the soy sauce away... wait we needed some for our food.  Here you can have take out packets.  The food was just ok, the sushi was a very small step above grocery store sushi.  I was quite disappointed.  It was clear that them getting out right at closing time was a much higher priority than customer service.  We will not be going back. :("}
{"text":"Well I always pass this place by and I kind a wish I had today. Very nice friendly staff but the breading is too thick and very greasy on their shrimp and mixed vegetables. Maybe I'll try something else and give it one more try."}
{"text":"Usually they're pretty efficient, but don't dare come here on a Sunday when they have their \"weekend crew.\" Walked in to a line, and couldn't figure out why. Then saw the cashier have to leave the register several times to package up food and deliver trays.  After waiting almost 10 minutes to order, I was dreadful of how much of my lunch break would be left.  Noticing there was only one person making food, I knew I was royally screwed, but tried to remain positive.  Until 15 minutes later....when I still didn't have any food.  I joined the line again, noticing now two more employees appeared from the back.  While waiting for a refund, my food finishes. Sorry, but now my lunch break is over and I've missed out on eating.  The guy packaging the food tries to just tell me I can take my food to go.  No, there's a reason I'm sitting down to eat, and it's because I can't just take food back to my workplace and eat while working.  So, now he knows I want a refund, but continues to let me wait in line while waiting for people to order.  Great idea, leave the person who is already exasperated in line again...  Definitely learned my lesson and won't take a chance with my lunch break again.  Hopefully they aren't trying to build their weekend sales, because they figured out the key to losing anybody who is trying to fit \"faster-food\" into their time parameters."}
{"text":"I only been to this place three times, and the third time I been here I ordered a vegetable teriyaki bowl as I started to eat my meal I realized there was a bug on my broccoli (ill post a pic too) and got sick to my stomach.  Apparently they don't wash or check their produce very well and just cook it. I got my money back but will never come back here again."}
{"text":"Worst food Ive had in a very long time, ordered a Yakisoba and it waa disgusting, no flavor tired little cuta of chicken and no flavor what so ever. It was bad enough for me to start a Yelp.acct just to write this review"}
{"text":"This is our family's favorite spot for quick lunch. Our usual is the Beef Teriyaki Veggie Bowl and Udon. A generous serving portion for the price. And cool drink dispenser! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Yogi's is great for teriyaki bowls. I always love the beef and chicken bowl with the addition of siracha. Great pick up place for dinner or lunch. The Arizona bowl is great for change if a teriyaki bowl."}
{"text":"Fast, friendly and good! Went for lunch and had the chicken teriyaki lunch bowl. It did not disappoint. Customer service was equally great! Inside seating is small, however, there is an outdoor patio that is covered and nice to sit out enjoying people watching. I would recommend this for lunch. And I will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"Food was good, lunch special for a little over $7, I got the beef, had great sauce & meat was cooked well. Customer service was overall poor.  When I walked up to counter one employee was standing in the small walkway & another almost ran into me bringing him his food, then both stood in walkway talking while I tried to pass.  Girls at register having their own conversation while I was trying to order."}
{"text":"I love Teriyaki Chicken and really miss Tokyo Express! I use to go the one on Thomas and 40th st, that one has been gone along time now. I loved the little iceberg salads with Carrot Ginger Dressing. I think they cost 10 cents back then.

I found myself in search of a new place and by using Yelp I found Yogis.

The place is a bit dingy, the dining room really needed a good wipe down, and on our visit the room was very warm maybe 85-90 degrees.

Service at the counter was good and I love the brown rice option. I also ordered a California Roll it was generic with lots of Krab, and very fresh avocado at 10 pieces for $4 on special it was delicious! My teriyaki chicken was also very good, and it's nice that they leave out extra sauce to help yourself too. I hate to guess if I might need extra sauce when I order so nice touch.

Yogi's is cravable and service is fine so I hope the work on that AC and maybe hire someone that likes to clean!"}
{"text":"Love this place! We just happened to find it one afternoon and have been coming for about 2 years now. Always fast and fresh"}
{"text":"Their chicken teriyaki is delicious and you get a good sized portion. Their sushi was good, but what you would expect from an inclusion of sushi to a place not specializing in it. Trivial as it is, I like the teriyaki sauce available in the pumps when you want a little more without getting nickel and dimed. Wait time can be long, but usually that's because they are busy with eat in and take out orders."}
{"text":"Great rolls of all types. I enjoy the spicy ones the best. Very quick service as a walk in customer or if I call in an order."}
{"text":"We normally go to the one at 99th and McDowell until we found out they had this location. 

Went in last night and this place is huge compared to the McDowell location and talk about CLEAN! My hubby asked them if they just opened and they said they have been there a few years. 

Food was on point! I love being able to go to another location and have the exact same food experience as another location I have attended. 

My little family of 4 walked in last night to have dinner. We got what we normally do and they even have nice signs showing to add on extras (yummy eggrolls.) 

Sauce was in condiment squeeze containers, love this!!! At the other location I have to continue to fill little cups for extra teriyaki sauce. 

All and all, happy I found this location."}
{"text":"This is NOT a 'three dollar' $$$ restaurant.  The yelp info is wrong. This is a walk-in, order at the counter, and wait for your name to be hollard joint.
Foods okay, I like the yakasoba noodles with chicken."}
{"text":"There really arn't any other teriyaki places around that can compete with Yogis plus the food is pretty dang good. Hence the 5 stars. My favorite thing to get is the regular Arizona bowl. It has crabmeat, cucumber, avocado, teriyaki sauce, and rice so its pretty light but filling. Ive also tried their chicken teriyaki (large) and it was good but the large is fricken HUGE! Their yakisoba is pretty good and so are their pork gyoza. Though I have never tried it, I have heard that the spicy teriyaki sauce is great. I like the fact that when you eat there, you can get as much teriyaki sauce from the dispenser as you want. The prices are not bad for the amount of food you get."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! They need to build one out in Queen Creek! They have the best chicken teriyaki bowl and California rolls!"}
{"text":"Poor service and nonsense with this place. I work nearby and have found after many visits that this restaurant has sub-par customer service and cannot handle taking orders over the phone. Food is not bad, but not consistent either. I've ordered ahead before and arrived to find they never put in my order, but no apology or anything even said to me about it. Today I was put on \"hold\" to listen to the staff talking for about 5 minutes before I hung up and tried to call back, and now can't get through at all. Squid Ink is better anyway and in the same building complex, and they care about their customer service."}
{"text":"Fast, affordable, and delicious. Not many places can cook rice correctly where it's sticky but not mushy. This place nails it. All the food congress in good proportions and the place is always clean even during the rush. My favorite plate is the entire menu. Everything is good."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service every time I have been in. I let the owner know how rude everyone is including himself and he said \"that's OK I'm the owner and I have plenty of business and don't need people like you in here\". I think we can all agree that customer service has just gone down the drain. If an owner of a restaurant or any business treats customers that way, guarantee they will not be open long. 


Response to owner to Jason Hill: Completely made up the story in the response because no where in my initial review did I indicate details of the situation. Wrong customer buddy.

This goes to show not only do you not care, but you don't take ownership for any of your actions. 

Again, you won't last long."}
{"text":"The food is actually pretty good. I've only had the chicken teriyaki bowl and it's delicious. The place doesn't look very clean though and the girl that took my order could probably work on her customer service skills but I'd go back for the food for sure."}
{"text":"Not a bad place, sure I've had way better sushi but this place is good if you're in a bit of a hurry. Every time it's been quick service, my to go orders are ready very quickly, making meals on a go perfect for me. Tried the Las Vegas Roll, it's really good. Husband went with a California Roll, said it was alright. The Japanese curry is ok also, nothing special. Curry is amazing if done properly. I will continue going here though, good and fast service."}
{"text":"Disgusting. Flies everywhere. Always dirty. The health board should be called. Young kids working who obviously don't care about health. This location is terrible!"}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place zero stars! The gal who took my order was snarky and unfriendly, the chicken was fatty and poorly cooked, and it's pretty expensive ($7.00 for a small chicken bowl & small drink). Plus they charged an extra $1.00 for brown rice and another $1.00 for white meat only, and they skimped out on the meat and the teriyaki sauce. To top it off, their idea of spicy teriyaki is to add a tiny splash of siracha hot sauce to the bowl.  So a truly \"healthy meal\" will set you back $9.00 and it will be mostly rice. If that's your idea of value, this is your place!"}
{"text":"This place is my staple spot for when i dont have food in the house.  It is a little pricey but always hits the spot."}
{"text":"This is a great place to take out.  They flat out have the best teriyaki chicken bowl in town.  Always consistent.  And they have sushi also - it is great!  I get the teriyaki chicken bowl and edamami to go all the time.  Call in and it is ready in 10 minutes.  Try it, you will enjoy it for sure."}
{"text":"Lunch special includes couple hidden options like brown rice and spicey teriyaki sauce. This place has not let me down yet. The cooking and plateing are top notch! Only thing is the meal comes in a to-go styrofoam container, as if 'I' wouldn't finish!"}
{"text":"Something was right with the food today.  I had nasty burps and after taste after eating my meal and my friend said he had a stomach ache afterwards"}
{"text":"Been to all these \"otokoy bowl\" types all over. This one has great flavor. The chicken is seasoned and marinated. Simple things like kombu on the rice. Impressed."}
{"text":"Just had my first bad experience here. The counter girl, Courteney from the receipt was rushing people out before 9pm. She turned off the TV denied the people after me the majority of the menu,  then completely denied the people after that. She then dimmed the lights. The food is phenomenal here. The sushi and the bowls are freaking awesome.  If I'm paying $20 bucks for two rolls and $2 for a soda I will enjoy them. Even if I told you the order was for here. Marked as here on my receipt, but bagged to go. I will come in specifically at 850 every night just to order a soda."}
{"text":"I come here a couple times a month and the food and service are both fantastic. The food is a great value, and for take out...it's about as good as sushi you can get. I really like the yakisoba, and everything else I've tried is always tasty."}
{"text":"The cashier during the lunch rush is really friendly and is able to multitask handling the lunch rush line while also helping customers picking up to go orders. Also, the Teriyaki sauce here is delicious! My husband usually gets the Hot Teriyaki  but its waaaay too spicy for me (and I like spicy foods). They have huge portions! I get the chicken Teriyaki  bowl with half veggies and half rice YUMMMMMMMMM"}
{"text":"So I have been here once on my lunch break before. I think I got like a tatsu chicken bowl. I don't know if I spelled that right or not. They seem to have a mix of Asian food which I am really happy about because Asian food is my all time favorite. A friend showed me this place. I haven't been back since but I plan on going back. They have sushi too so I'm gonna have to try the sushi as well sometime. They're pretty quick and friendly. I really enjoyed the food. The sauce on the meal that I got was really tasty. I didn't finish it all. It's a pretty good size. I can't wait to come back and try some other things and take some photos of my meals! If you haven't been here and you love Asian food, you'll like this place for sure! I will be back!!!"}
{"text":"YUM! I love the food here. I've never been to any of the other Yogi's locations, and this one is VERY new, so sometimes they are closed for an upgrade or whatever. They usually close the same time as the Starbucks a few doors down, but this whole area tends to roll up it's sidewalks early. Oh well. 

I was working at the H&R Block next door, and all my coworkers could do was complain about the price. It's definitely more than the awful place that was there before it, but the food is GREAT! Instead of having bins of food sitting around, they pre-slice the ingredients, and throw it on the grill when you order. Fresh, and delicious; yeah, I'll pay a little more for that. And it's not as expensive as a sit-down restaurant would be, I think it's very reasonable! 

I even tried new things, which I'm sort of hesitant to do. I noticed that they had \"tofu nuggets\", and my vegan friend *swear* that tofu isn't gross if it's done correctly. I was very skeptical, lol. But it's true! They give you teriyaki sauce for dipping, and it's yummy. I now dry-fry it myself at home, and dip into bbq sauce. Nom. 

I'm in love with their soda machine. Seriously, I want to marry it. It's one fountain, like those coffee dispensers in hospitals (If they still have those; I'm old). You pick your soda, like Coke Zero, which is the best, of course. Then you get to add flavor, like cherry or lime or whatever. BRILLIANT!!! You can get flavors in your water or tea as well. And all the Fanta flavors for kids or if you just like your soda orange. Since I was working next door, they'd let me come back & refill my cup all day, too. But then, I brought them a box of Block swag on opening day, too, so I'm special. :D"}
{"text":"So thrilled a Yogi's is in Ocotillo!  We have been three times already and are weekly visitors now.  The kids can eat healthy and the food is great.  I love seeing a family owned place and the food and service are consistently great!"}
{"text":"I have only picked up food here, never stayed in, and always get the teriyaki chicken, so can't rate the other meats. Chicken is flavorful. Veggie variety could be better, too much cabbage for my tastes, not enough broccoli! Teriyaki sauce is very good, and they actually give you 2 little containers in your to-go order, so there is enough sauce for the meal. You can choose between white and brown rice.

I have also tried the California Roll and the Crunch Roll, and they were both very good, SO much better than I expected from a chain!

It's a small, casual place with indoor and outdoor seating, mostly take-out, always busy and bustling when I've been there. Menu board is large, has many options, and is easy to read. Staff is friendly, food service is quick."}
{"text":"We ordered from here on Uber eats, not expecting much, but I was pleasantly surprised at how good it was! We ordered the teriyaki salmon, the beef yakisoba, and a Las Vegas roll. The salmon was about $13 and was actually really tasty for fast food salmon. It was cooked well and came with rice and vegetables. The yakisoba was about $9 and it was just okay. The beef was really really thinly sliced and had an okay flavor, as did the noodles. The best thing was the sushi! I was not expecting to love sushi from a fast food place but I did! It was nicely fried and had a really yummy spicy mayo on it. It was HUGE and only about $9. Yummy!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious food! The portions are great and the price is right. Definitely give this place a try!"}
{"text":"I just recently found this place and was hesitant to try the food but now it's become one of my favorites. I had the shrimp,rice,and noodle combo and I loved it.

The restaurant was pretty dead when I was there and the girl on the front was pretty nice but I could hear  them gossiping and talking about the big order that I made ( for take out for my family) but other than that the place was pretty good."}
{"text":"Good sushi for a reasonable price.  I highly recommend the crunch roll!  They also have teriyaki bowls which are really tasty and the regular size is filling.  If you are going to go, look for coupons that arrive in the mail.  I love this place because they also have kids sized teriyaki bowls so there is something there for my whole family. 

This location has always been clean and the food has always been made promptly with no issues.

Only thing I don't like is that it is closed on Sundays."}
{"text":"For such a small place, they do have a decent sized sushi list. Prices are about what you'd expect for sushi so it's a step above Kyoto Bowl without going overboard. If you're not getting sushi, about all you can expect otherwise would be some kinda teriyaki bowl, unless you plan on getting full on miso soup and edamame. The sushi was absolutely fresh. Potstickers were perfect. Kudos on having raspberry tea as well as regular. Get here @ 11AM if you want in. We did and I noticed that there is a huge business casual line by 11:30 on a weekday. They have a nice big screen TV with CNN news playing at a decent volume. Right on."}
{"text":"If you are unsure about yogis just give it a try. Their spicy teriyaki sauce is the way to go. Good lunch before 3 and food is always prepared well and quickly.. Absolutely love yogis"}
{"text":"Great rolls every time I go... The Dragon Roll is my favorite! Super speedy, but great quality sushi. 
Love that we can have Sushi night at home!"}
{"text":"My new go to restaurant for take out or I just don't know what to do for dinner.  The biggest shame is it been there for quite some time and I just tried it a month ago.  

I have probably done take out 4-5 times now.  Food is above expectation, restaurant is VERY clean and the service is quick and friendly.  

Menu has a nice variety including sushi.  If you order a bowl there are 2 sizes, but my husband who is a big eater says the large is too big.  

Lunch specials available, reasonable, and filling.  

Do yourself a favor and if you have not tried it, go now.  You will not be diappointed. I just wish I would have gone sooner."}
{"text":"A little Disappointed 

Went to Yogis Grill to have a late lunch and meet with family and friends. Some of my lunch companions had sushi, which was just average at best, others had teppanyaki which in all honesty was soggy and lacked flavor. The  other entrée's on the menu we sampled  were, spring rolls, beef & chicken terakayi  bowls, gyoza, udon, and all these entrée's just weren't very good.

 Have been to 2 locations of Yoshi Grill and they seem to be about the same quality of food."}
{"text":"Disappointed 

I was excited to see that Yogis opened a location so close to home.  However, in all honesty I havent had much luck when dining at other Yogis locations but wanted to give this location a try. 

Today, I went to Yogis Grill to have a late lunch and meet with a few friends. Some of my lunch companions had sushi, which was just average at best, others had teppanyaki which in all honesty was soggy and lacked flavor. The  other entrée's on the menu we sampled  were, spring rolls, beef & chicken teriyaki   bowls, gyoza, udon, and all these entrée's just weren't very good.

My beef teriyaki was little pieces of beef that was challenging to chew and my potatoe crouquette was crispy on the outside and cold in the middle. Had the crouquette been cooked completely through it wood have been tasty.

 I have now been to 3 locations of Yogis Grill and they seem to be about the same quality of food."}
{"text":"This was horrible!   First, the person at the register (I think was the manager because he was counting money) was very rude and unfriendly.   I asked what the Udon soup came with and it was such a hassle for him to answer.  I ordered a side order and with something that looked like an attitude just rung it up!   Then, they couldn't even give me an empty plastic sauce container for sirachi sauce, again that was a big hassle for them - told me they don't have any extra empty ones and instead gave me teriyaki sauce(???).   NO!  I asked for the chili so that I could add sirachi sauce in it, the girl said \"are you throwing it away and putting the sauce??\"  Service awful!   Then, the food, soup, noodles, tasteless.   I'm very well rounded and enjoy different ethnics foods, Asian being my favorite and I can say this was the worst!  Granted, this is a fast food place but it was absolutely horrible!  Not worth the $11.  I will not be back!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Japanese restaurant for lunch. Great food and the workers are always in a good mood, Chelsea especially."}
{"text":"4/25/2018:

I am a food courier and received an order at 8:42pm for a pickup. I drove from Kyrene and Guadalupe to this location (which is a 10 minute drive, almost 5 miles).

Driving this distance also meant that I was that much farther from driving back to my house, located in Mesa, once my shift ended (which was at 9pm). I also wasted about 15-20 minutes of my time dealing with this which means I missed out on taking a different order that I would have actually been paid for, unlike the total lack of compensation my time and effort got me from dealing with this store.

I arrived at 8:52pm, only to discover that the employee working in the front had decided to cancel my order \"because we don't take orders after 8:45pm.\"

After calling support, I confirmed that the business received the order at 8:42pm, but the employee canceled the order anyways, even after I had repeatedly explained to him that the order was received BEFORE 8:45pm.

Either the employee had not been paying attention to the tablet until after the 8:45pm cut off time, or he was just being lazy and didn't want to make the order because he wanted to close the store and go home.

In either case, the order shouldn't have been canceled because it was in fact received before 8:45pm.

What is the point of even having a 8:45pm cut off time if your employees are just going to arbitrarily decide not to make orders whenever they feel like it?

Now, there is an unhappy customer who didn't get their food and an unhappy food courier who won't bother coming to pick up orders from your store when it's even remotely close to 8:45pm (out of fear that your employees will just cancel the order after I've driven several miles out of my way and wasted a lot of my time both driving and talking to support).

I hope the employee is happy that he got to go home 15 minutes earlier than he would have if he had just had the kitchen make the order. He was smiling as I sat in my car talking to support, likely thinking it was so funny that I was upset about having driven that far for nothing. He must think it was really funny to waste a food courier's time and gas like that (and upset a customer). Well, I didn't find it funny and still don't.

We don't get compensated for that travel time or mileage. That jerk cost me money and time and I won't ever bother with picking up at this store again if it's after 8pm.

I've worked in fastfood and I know how badly it sucks to have orders come in right before close, but you know what, your store is still open so you just suck it up and make the food. You are open, it is your job. You don't just close early or stop serving customers because you feel like going home early. You don't just arbitrarily decide to screw over your customers and a food courier who bothered to drive to your store in good faith because you want to go home. Unless you're some immature jerk of an employee who thinks it's funny to screw over customers and food couriers.

Again, the order was received at 8:42pm, 3 minutes BEFORE the cut off time, but the employee decided to cancel it anyway. What is the point of even having a cut off time if your employees are just going to pick and choose which orders to make?

This business needs to look into this employee's actions and train him to watch the tablet closer and make EVERY order that comes in before the cut off time, or just make the cut off time earlier if it's really an issue about closing the store on time.

I will be contacting the store's GM, the Area Manager, and the Director of Operations about this if I don't get some indication that my complaint has been heard and the establishment is genuinely sorry they wasted my time and money like they did."}
{"text":"It's good but there are better options. Nothing to fiend for by any means but a decent health conscious choice. 

The sushi is horrible if I'm being honest. Not sure why they even have it here at all. Stick with the sorta good things you do...like chicken teriyaki bowls. 

Customer service is ok...I guess. Place is usually pretty clean. Cool soda fountain."}
{"text":"First time we tried this place.  The food was fine.  Not particularly memorable, but not bad.  I like Genghis Grill better, but this place is cheaper.  And the quantity of food is reasonably generous.  Menu seemed to have a variety of choices.  I quickly narrowed in on the yakisoba.  The teenager went for a teriyaki bowl of some sort.  Both came with rice, and we had enough left over for another meal later.

I wouldn't make a point of coming here, but if I were in the area I could see stopping in for an (relatively) inexpensive bite."}
{"text":"WORST customer service by ALYSSA. I ordered a Crazy Tuna (yellowfin on top of a spicy tuna roll). After waiting a substantial amount of time and telling my husband to go ahead and start with his lunch, she came out with something else - a spicy tuna roll WITHOUT the yellowfin. I brought it back to her and said this isn't what I ordered. She argued and looked at the receipt and told me I ordered the \"Spicy Tuna\". I said, \"no, I ordered the Crazy Tuna\". She said she'd remake it, but I have to pay an extra $1.50. I asked her why I had to pay extra if wasn't my mistake. She told me, \"well I read your order back to you.\" So I asked her \"so you're saying this is my fault?\"  She said no. She walked off and then 10 minutes later came out and ask for $2.27 now. I told her again I'm not paying extra because it wasn't my fault. Repeat previous conversation (she read it back to me, are you saying it's my fault, no). I said \"well, just give me all my money back then. It wasn't my fault that you entered the order incorrectly.\"  Then she had the nerve to say \"you're rude!\"  How is it that she can place my order incorrectly, demand two different amounts of money, and tell me it's not my fault and THEN call me RUDE?!  Every restaurant I've ever been to has always corrected a mistake and never demanded extra money for their mistake. If anything, the really great restaurants try to make up for the setback by taking money off the bill or giving a free dessert. Why? Because they realize the importance of reputation (especially in a social media world) and repeat business. Wow. Just wow. I think I've spent $1000+ at this place over the last couple of years and I will NEVER come back. It's too much rudeness for moderately good sushi."}
{"text":"It's pretty healthy. It's fast. It tastes good. It's near my house. They have chop sticks. I'll be back"}
{"text":"We went here before seeing \"Ready Player One\" on our date night. We ordered Las Vegas rolls, a Philadelphia roll, an order of egg rolls, and 2 orders of gyoza. The restaurant was packed, it being a Friday night, but it was still easy to get a table to dine in. The cashier was pleasant and brought us our food when it was ready. The food tasted good, but it turned on us a few hours later.

We both ended up getting food poisoning, so I'm not sure the food was kept at the proper temperature prior to ordering it."}
{"text":"My chicken tasted raw. It didn't look pink . I kept trying to strain my eyes to be sure. And the rice was also kind of cruncky like it wasn't finished cooking. Someone train the new guy how to do it properly cause it had been fine in the past. Internet worked good enough for me to leave this review."}
{"text":"You are not allowed to use the wireless. Thats pretty sad.  But they do have diet coke"}
{"text":"Teriyaki chicken ordered for myself.  Good but not fantastic.  Friend ordered orange chicken and it wasn't a winner.  Staff was cordial and service was fast.  Perfect for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"I used to come here a lot and it was delicious. I've been here twice in the last 3 months and the chicken was disgusting both times. It was fatty and not edible. Some pieces were pink and others were gray. This will be my last visit here."}
{"text":"The food has always tasted pretty good but this time around I took my mom out to lunch and while waiting for the food I used the men's room....  So the tiles had what looked like wet black mold growing in the corners, the urinal was brown, that's right brown, that faded into a sort of white the farther it got from the drain and the sink wasn't even screwed down... I didn't bother looking at the toilet...  I was absolutely shocked by how different the front of the restaurant is to the restroom.  I don't think I will be going back there if that is their approach to cleanliness where you can see it then I really don't want to know about their kitchen...  Please please please work on this!"}
{"text":"The rice was dry. The chicken was dry and burnt. The employees were rude and barely answered our questions. This place sucks. Food took like 30 minutes...."}
{"text":"Tried this place last night. Not amazing, not terrible. Being from the PNW, I found myself longing for my favorite Teriyake joint in Tigard. The sauce is a little too sweet and not as robust as I'd like. The noodles tasted like curry which threw me off. The chicken was tasty and had that nice char. The beef was tender (sampled my husband's) but truthfully, my favorite was the spicy California roll. I'd definitely go back to have that and some of the other menu items."}
{"text":"During the afternoon of August 22nd I was with three of my friends who also were wearing Ward or Trump shirts and we were told the place was closed to us.  We did not ask the person if she spoke for restaurant as she was standing in the doorway and closed the door exiting into the restaurant leaving us outside."}
{"text":"I have been eating here for about 3 years now. Best teriyaki bowl by far and the teriyaki sauce is really good. I have tried other things on the menu, but I come here for the bowls, I go 50/50 half beef and chicken."}
{"text":"I was there yesterday for lunch. I got some veggie noodles along with rice. Taste was ok (nothing impressive). Not sure why I was served rice. I would have preferred a lot more veggies in the noodles than bland rice.

The water was chlorinated and it was pretty bad. I had a couple of sips and I am down with soar throat and cold. I am not going back here, ever."}
{"text":"I never had an issue with this place. I go here at least once a month to get my obsession - Dragon Rolls! They taste great and are a big bigger then other places I have gone for the same price. The staff have been friendly and service has been quick. So I havent run into any issues."}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time and being new convert to sushi I was cautious. I must say this place was great for a quick and reasonably priced sushi place. Not the most friendly counter staff but overall I was pleased."}
{"text":"This place is one of my favorite places and I love their food but this one worker with curly hair who was working the register at 6:15 on 5/28 was Extremely Rude! The moment me and my girlfriend stepped in we were criticized on what were wearing and asked how old my girlfriend and I were. He then proceeded to ask if music was ok and then started playing NWA and Bone thugs and Cuss word this and cuss word that, that I was embarrassed for him. Then other customers entered he pestered them to hurry up and about what they were gonna order. Then he would step outside to talk to his friends for a good 4 min while no one was watching over anything. There is so much more embarrassing and rude things that he did. We will not be returning to this location until he is gone."}
{"text":"I have been here several times for lunch during the week and had nothing but good service and really good food. My first time at Yogis I had ordered 2 rolls....beware...their rolls are really big!!! I could only get through one of them. It was very good, fresh and a great price. The second time I went I had the Arizona Bowl and Veggie Tempura...again...beware...the servings are on the larger side! I wasn't prepared for the veggie tempura to be quite that big (but that's ok, I had leftovers to bring back to work). I recently went again and just got the Arizona Bowl (Rice, Crab Mix, Avocado) and the reg size is plenty! It's pretty crowded during the lunch hour so this time I just got it to go to bring back to work but on other days I had to wait for a table to open up. I wish they had some seats outside as well. Overall, good food and good service so I know I will be back again soon for lunch."}
{"text":"Quick service, but subpar food. The miso soup was like water. The teriyaki chicken had little to no teriyaki sauce. The \"veggies\"was almost all cabbage. Skimpy serving sizes for the price. Gave this a 2nd try after a year or two and still not impressed. Bummer, because the Yogis at 99th Ave. is much better. Won't be back to this location."}
{"text":"Bleck!  A friend and I were in the area and decided to give this place a try - without checking it out first.. mistake!!!  Should've guessed it was a crappy chain but we live and/or learn.

First, the guy taking our orders was about as helpful as a gnat and equally annoying.  Seemed put out that we were looking the menu over, we had to practically squeeze 2 word answers out of him.  

I love eel so I went with the unagi veggie bowl.  I had a feeling I shouldn't have gone for the $9.25 bowl but I did.  I feel robbed!!!  Placed on top of about 3 servings of rice were a few strips of grilled eel, very fatty with skin on.  A little teriyaki sauce squirted on top.  Then a large side of PLAIN steamed veggies - no sauce, no grill marks, wok marks, nothing!  I'm not a fan of Chinese or Japanese food drowning in sauce, but when you have horribly bland veggies they need something!!

My friend went with the chicken teriyaki bowl, pretty simple right?  Wrong.  There was plenty of chicken...dry, stringy, greasy, over-breaded chicken, over about 4 servings of rice.  Oh, and a little squirt of teriyaki.  I almost asked to try a little to see for myself but it looked so unappetizing I opted not to.

I was surprised how many people came in while we were there, it's not good food.  I guess they like the quantity over quality.  Oh, and the difference between a dine in/take out order?  They saw the clamshell in half.  Is that a huge savings?  Seems cheesy.  Especially for a $9.25 rice bowl.

For the same price I could've had a great meal (enough for 2 meals) @ Pe!We!, they actually wok their veggies and have...whats that stuff.... FLAVOR!"}
{"text":"Yogis is the place to go for lunch if you can. Their lunch special is pretty good you get a teriyaki bowl and a drink for around $6-7? Can't really remember right now. 

The place is always clean the staff isn't always the best but they try. 

The new soda machine is awesome you can no chose from a variety of coca cola products so your not so limited there. The Thai tea with boba is actually pretty great. I would say much better than the boba shop in the same plaza. 

Still not a big fan of the sushi and haven't really tried anything else on their menu other than the potatoe cake? Not so great so I might just stick to what I know and have come to love yogis for their chicken teriyaki bowl."}
{"text":"I ordered the Philadelphia roll. It was 8 pieces and very fresh. 

Pricing was good so at $9.99.

It's a bit dark, but not uncomfortable. There was a bball game on the tv, which a bit of background noise, although the place was quiet.

The counter worker/order taker was friendly and smiled the whole time.

It's tasty and fresh! I'd come again, especially since it took them about 5 minutes to make 2 orders."}
{"text":"Ummm, wow! My family tried Yogis Grill (delivered by Uber Eats) tonight and I honestly was not expecting it to be this great! The prices are awesome for the large portions you get. I had the spicy tuna bowl with cucumber and avocado. It was so good! My only complaint about it is that it was a little skimpy on the sauce and if you want more than what's on it you have to pay extra for it. Maybe having it in a separate sauce container would be good so you can put as much on as you like. Edit: you don't pay extra for more sauce, you just have to specify that you want it. 

Overall I would highly recommend Yogis Grill, everyone in my family enjoyed their quality, delicious meals!"}
{"text":"I ordered a roll with eel and avocado. The eel was near non-existent and it was a bit mushy. 
The cucumber salad was devoid of any flavor. An $8 chopped iceberg lettuce salad essentially. 
My husband liked the chicken and beef teriyaki bowls. 
The garlic noodles are also lacking flavor. 
I was so hopeful."}
{"text":"I've been giving this place a few chances ... The first time my husband and I tried this place was about 6 months ago, we ordered the large beef teriyaki, the meat was fresh and tasty, so we thought that we had finally found our official Teriyaki restaurant. After going several times in the last few months, our experience went quickly from a 10 to a 0 , the meat is not tasty at all, it is rubbery and it seems old, the rice is very sticky, and there's not enough teriyaki sauce. I asked the cashier to please provide me with a little more teriyaki sauce and she said \" no , there's already 1 in the bag\" ( keep in mind that I ordered 2 large orders of teriyaki) I then told her that I would pay for it and she still said \"no\" and went on taking other orders. I'm not sure if they have changed owners in the last few months but the service and the quality of the food is terrible. I lived in CA and they have another location there so I thought this place would be as good as the one in Cali, but it's disappointing  to know that's not the case. Oh well ! Time to start searching for a new restaurant ! :D"}
{"text":"I called in an order for a LARGE chicken and veggie teriyaki bowl and a vegas roll the cashier told me my order would be ready in 15 mins.....when I arrive the order was ready I paid and headed out to my car I decide to open up my sushi to taste it, as soon as i pick a piece up it falls completely apart and not to mention the flavor of the rice vinegar was over powering. To top it all off i notice my teriyaki bowl is small and not large so I walk back into the restaurant and point out both mistakes to the cashier she takes the food back to the cooks and to who seems like the manager/owner of the place they refuse to replace the teriyaki bowl for a large even when I offered to pay the additional cost (ridiculous) and as far as the sushi roll goes they asked if i wanted another item on the menu I said NO, my initial reason for the visit was for sushi since I didn't feel like going in to a fancy sushi restaurant. I asked for them to remake my roll which they did not seem too happy about but they got it done. So I get home the sushi was properly made this time but still lacked in flavor all I could taste is the rice vinegar like i said before and the teriyaki bowl was so dry in every way the whole contents in the bowl were dry and bland the only thing that made it edible was the teriyaki sauce which is unacceptable... I forgot to mention the cashier was really nice and helpful, after all its not her fault the food was terrible and the manager/owner or whoever he was is a cheapskate! I have ate at other Yogis establishments and their food is great thats why I was so optimistic about trying this location closer to home but never again this is a total waste of money to anybody that wants to try this newer location don't take a chance there are other reataurants in the area or try another yogis they're not all bad I've had some great experiences at  two of if their other locations in the valley as for me I will not be returning for nasty overpriced sushi or anything on their menu."}
{"text":"Ordered the yakisoba combo and for the price you actually get a lot of food so that's good. The chicken wasn't fatty and actually was grilled nicely. The noodles I felt were a little bit drenched in teriyaki sauce which I feel was too much... but overall the food was good.

The food took wayyyy too long to come out. This is because of staffing issues. They had one girl working the register during a peak dinner time and the line was near the door. There were two cooks and one other lady back there I'm assuming that was putting the dishes together. They definitely needed help because this girl at the register was between phone orders and customer orders and you can tell she was overwhelmed.

I still feel that samurai Sams is slightly better, but I would definitely come back here for sure."}
{"text":"This food made me sick  I ate The AZ bowl  never trying it again . Not recommending it to anyone ..."}
{"text":"One of the very few sushi restaurants I'll eat at when I visit Phoenix. The service is excellent, the food is great restaurant has a warm ambiance."}
{"text":"Loved Yogis for so long but have recently been very disappointed you can definitely tell the work and effort is not being put into the sushi nor the presentation. Got a browned avacado on one of my rolls and the shrimp looked black almost as if it was rotten. Was very grossed out threw away all of the food. They need to go back to their roots where they had affordable tasteful sushi."}
{"text":"Super friendly and fast service! The food was delicious and I will be back to this location for sure. They made me and my son feel welcomed :) plus they have the soda machine that has every single fountain drink you can think of another plus"}
{"text":"Food was ok. Nothing special but I was hungry. I had the sushi and the rolls are huge. Staff seemed a bit lazy and slow."}
{"text":"We have ate here multiple times, and so far everything has been great. Sushi is pretty decent for a chain, and the bowls are just the right size and have a good amount of meat. My fav is the combo bowl."}
{"text":"This is the slowest fast food you'll ever order. The kids working here are about as smart as rocks and as quick as snails. They spend more time socializing with their friends then they do paying attention to customers. 

Called my order in and still ended up waiting over 20min for my order. 1 order that's it, large steak teriyaki bowel with rice. Nothing special and they couldn't even get that right. This place is possible the worst around here and I for one can not wait to get out of this part of town. The management clearly doesn't care by reading the rest of the reviews in here so I recommend just staying far away from this place and see how much they like not meeting their budgets and then the tune may change."}
{"text":"First off, the food is good, I will not comment on the quality. I go here on a regular basis and have no issues with the food, but I do the service. When I order to-go, I am consistently snubbed when I ask for a small container to take sauce in. If I order a teriyaki bowl, I want to add chili to my meal once I sit down to eat. Today I asked one of the girls for chili paste for my to-go order and they told me I can add some to my food for free from the pump containers or I would have to pay $0.50 to get a small container for the chili paste that's already out for everyone to use/take. On a few occasions if I run short on time, I've asked for a lid so I can take my food. The employees ALWAYS play stupid about the lids and get attitude if I go to the counter and ask for a lid..to take the food that I already paid for! I have referred many people here and I will definitely tell them about my experiences, if they haven't experienced any of this already. I don't appreciate being charged for things that I would get for free if I ordered to-go or for things that would be free if I ate in the restaurant. Make a few bucks selling $0.03 containers, terrible business plan. Greedy."}

Overall the place is very neat and clean and great to sit back and enjoy some lunch but I'd say it would be superb if the staff was more energetic. Though, food quality in a sense is what is probably keeping this place alive."}
{"text":"Yogis grill was pretty good overall and I was impressed by the variety of menu offerings.  I ordered two rolls and both were good size and fairly priced.  They have kids meals that provide large servings.  The udon soup looked good as well and was served in a large bowl with plenty of meat and noodles.  Seating was okay and the service was very fast.  I would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"the service is ehhhh but food is pretty good and affordable.

Chicken teriyaki is delish & so are the sushi rolls supprisingly."}
{"text":"I have order here a couple times and the service is always great and the food is amazing! I always get the teriyaki chicken bowl and my co worker gets the sushi which is also really good!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars

Struggled over what to score this little spot. Stopped by and tried the large beef teriyaki and it was good. Was it the best, no, but better than I was expecting. Only real issue was the staff appeared brand new and did not know the menu at all. The young man was very nice but clearly a new employee. The issue does not fall on him but the management who is not properly training the young fella and throwing him to the wolves. In looking at previous reviews, management seems to be a regular issue. Overall, I would go back but would be worried about the outcome.

On a side note, I was informed an extra sauce cost  .25 and boy are they small."}
{"text":"Gd fast food sushi!!!  Get the Unagi Bowl it's very very very good!! Big serving size with assorted vegetables. Well balanced meal! :-)"}
{"text":"The food is so so, but because it's supposed to be \"fast food\" I keep coming back.  Not after today, they simply have no respect for people's time.  For the record I only ordered one sushi roll and there was only one person ahead of me..."}
{"text":"I ordered a large teriyaki chicken bowl all white meat. The chicken was rubbery and tasted like lighter fluid! They were also passing out orders to the wrong people. The last time I had a chicken teriyaki bowl here it was pretty good. I don't know what happened. Maybe new management?  I don't recommend!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Their sushi rolls and teriyaki bowls are fantastic!!! I'm visiting from New York and this place makes me want to stay here even more! Highly recommend :)"}
{"text":"I don't even know where to begin with this place! I've came in a few times, 3 to be exact and it's been more awful than the last.
The first time I came in my chicken had so much burnt grill marks [ from an uncleaned grill] I wasn't sure if I was eating chicken or charcoal. I told an employee and they said \"that's how all of it comes.\" Ook, whatever that means.. I picked around and ate mostly rice and sauce.. they never remade my order.

Second time I came in with friends, I didn't want to get anything, but decided on a dragon roll. Avocados on it were half old and half under ripe, how does that even happen?! Barely any eel and it was cold and chewy, aren't they suppose to at least nuke the damn thing so it's edible?! Once again nothing was done about it, but there was an apology. Awesome. 

Third and final time, I ordered the beef teriyaki, everything tasted great, delicious rice, yummy tender beef, great sauce, and 2 strands of wonderful DNA. One black straight hair and one curly pube looking hair, I was half way done when I spotted my curly companion. I gagged! Not because of the hair on my food, but because there was a weird feeling like something clung onto dear life at the back of my tongue. I stuck my finger back there and I scraped it out after 3 attempts with my finger nail. I damn near threw up. 
I put it on my plate and walked up to the counter, but they were slightly busy so I had to wait. It felt like everyone was looking at me, probably were, but I was just trying not to puke at this point!

Finally got the managers attention, or I'm assuming it was the manager, told him what happened, he looked at me and said it wasn't possible and basically said it was my own?! I have brownish black 22 in long hair.. are you kidding me?! Is it because half the cooks were bald!? They still had facial hair and HE was near food with no hat or hair net on!? I demanded my money back and he said NO, basically, because I already ate most of it?! I was so livid I just left! F this place, and their poor management and customer service skills."}
{"text":"Love their sushi here..always fresh, Yogis has a good lunch special Chicken Teriaki bowl with a drink for $6.99 .. It's a must try"}
{"text":"Awesome service and great food! The chicken was astounding and the sauces were an explosion of flavor!"}
{"text":"I recommend this restaurant. I was not disappointed by the California rolls.  Serving size is good, and so is the price.  And they tasted great.  I went in another time and ordered the teriyaki.  It was also to my liking.  I go out to eat about 3 times a week, and am very picky.  Giving them a good rating, and will go back again."}
{"text":"Just moved in the area a few months ago and looking for a quick Japanese food and found this place on Yelp. I ordered the Teriyaki Chicken and Tempura combination. I was really satisfied with the meal. They gave me an ample amount of food (didn't finish eating the chicken and rice) and they tasted delicious. I will definitely head out to this place again if I ever have another 'craving'. The staff was friendly and the place was clean and inviting. Oh and the California roll that went with it was fresh and it melted in my mouth so suffice to say, it was really good:) Highly recommended for sure and I am excited to taste the rest of the items on the menu..yummy:)"}
{"text":"Staff is super friendly and helpful. While it does take some time to get my order, under 15 minutes on a busy day, my food has always been correct and tasty!"}
{"text":"They delivered to my apt through the doordash app. Great service, delivered on time, food was still hot and delicious. Will definitely order from them again."}
{"text":"Prepare yourself for some big portions here, because at a price point similar to traditional, fast-casual Chinese food places around town like Panda Express and Yoshi's, they give you more than enough to fill yourself up. I couldn't even finish what I had, but the teriyaki chicken was super good. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Love everything I've tried here; teriyaki chicken with rice and noodles, the sushi, appetizers... It's all delicious!  Super fast service!"}
{"text":"Yogi's is a great place to grab a quick, fairly-cheap meal. I love the Arizona bowl - it's a great alternative for you sushi craving if you don't feel like spending a lot of money.

The quality of the food isn't bad. The sushi rolls are alright. The staff is moderate - they've never done anything to impress me, but haven't done anything to disappoint either."}
{"text":"Great food as well as good sushi at a fast food pace. Can't beat that. This is my go to for take out. We are always full, a good full.. Not a greasy heavy throw up full..LOL... The sushi here is one of My favorites I have tried them all and they have a great selection. Great to feed a family of big boys! They are always full and satisfied"}
{"text":"Good food for a good price.  First time I've eaten at this location but it was as good as I hoped.  I got a half size Crunch Roll for an appetizer, and an order of Chicken Yakisoba.  Both were very good.  The crunch roll was very fresh with good quality ingredients, crunchy shrimp Tempura, crab, avocado, etc.  The yakisoba wasn't quite what I thought it would be in that the noodles and meat were separate, not mixed, but that didn't affect the quality or flavor.  It was closing time and I'd only eaten half, but I packed up the rest and brought it back to my motel so the workers could finish up and go home. 

This was the fourth place I'd attempted to go to for dinner so I was especially happy to find them open.  The first place, Azucar Peruvian, was right across the street from the motel I always stay at and I'd been meaning to try them since last summer.  I drove over there to find they were now out of business with a sign up advertising the place going in next.  I snoozed, I loozed.

 The second place was supposed to be open till 8:30pm according to their Yelp listing, but was closed when I got there a  few minutes after 8.

The third place, Omega Gyros, highly recommended on Yelp, was also out of business.  FML. 

So when I got to Yogi's I was holding my breath till I saw they were open till nine.  Thank you Yogi's!"}
{"text":"Jonathan is a  sweetheart I placed my order in the car and my food was ready by the time I got there and no problem ordering extra sauce."}
{"text":"No wonder this place has a shit rating. Sent my boyfriend to pick up food and because he didn't say \"low carb\" the order came fucked up. If I'm saying NO FUCKING RICE ILL HAVE VEGETABLES INSTEAD that means you'll have to out more than 2 pathetic shriveled pieces of broccoli. I called and she said\" we mixed your Vegetables in the noodles\". I can count the 5 pieces of vegetables. I've never been to this location before however, I've ordered the same shit a million times at the 6059 w. Chandler location and it's always came out perfectly!! Avoid the headache and go to the other locations"}
{"text":"this place is BOMB!

wow did not think a fast food sushi joint would be so good! there sushi was beyond my expectations. i eat here at least once a week. they have a great lunch special. almost every time i come here i see a cop which says something right? maybe not lol

try the crunch roll or the las vegas roll. orgasm in your mouth"}
{"text":"I have been going here once every week for quite a while.... 6 or 7 months?

The crew turns over constantly and the orders are NEVER right.

I order the same thing every week, I make them read it back to me, then correct the errors. Then when the food is made they tie the bag in a knot so I have to rip open to inspect, then send back to fix the errors again.

Today I think I reached the breaking point and will probably not return.

How hard is large chicken teriyaki meal with extra onions and an extra side of rice with no seeds and extra sauce?

You would be surprised, how simple it sounds, but they get it wrong every single week, week after painful week. I even say it super slow and repeat myself often like you would with a child........ Wow!!!!

Food quality is good and the price is fair and they have the cool soda machine, but I'm just worn out with the BS.

Good luck if you visit here, and DEFINITELY check your orders if you get the food to go!!!!"}
{"text":"Love yogis! The large bows are pretty large and can equal two meals. 

I really love their teriyaki sauce nice and thick. 

The arizona bowl is pretty dang good too if you like imitation crab. Interesting little dish that I'd never seen. 

Egg rolls are great too! 

Fantastic lunch combo deals too!"}

{"text":"Really enjoyed the food, fresh and flavorful, not oil heavy or overbearing with sauces. 
Good variety of menu selections with classic choices of chicken and beef. 
Service was friendly and quick. Will definitely go back to try other entrees."}
{"text":"First timer... I did take out and ordered two large chicken teriyaki bowls and 2 sodas.  The food order was finished before I could finish filling my drink cups!  Grilled chicken, sliced on top of pearl rice and sides of the sauce to add to taste.  I was all very good and filling.  Service was excellent and the restaurant was not crowded for a Monday afternoon, although it was President's Day so a holiday for some... I'm guessing why shopping center parking lot was so empty.  I would recommend this place and I can't wait to go back!  Thank you."}
{"text":"Wanted to get something healthy and fast. I've seen them around town. The inside was really nice. The food was perfectly cooked and delicious. I recommend this location!"}
{"text":"I recently received a flyer in the mail that a new restaurant had opened up around the corner from my house and today I decided to try it out for the first time.  The staff was genuinely exuberant and glad to help explain the menu.  I ordered the large chicken and beef lunch special and received a hot, fresh, delicious and filling lunch that met my expectations.  One minor complaint was the teriyaki beef:  it was good and tender, but seemed to lack a certain \"character\" in its flavor, probably because the grill it was cooked on was still so new.  I'm sure this minor nitpick will fix itself in time, but I would still definitely recommend this place for lunch!"}
{"text":"I'm never eating here again. Tempura shrimp tasted like frozen shrimp and the cod tasted like its out of a box. Wasted $20!!"}
{"text":"Food is fantastic and always consistent. Great option if you're looking for a place to eat while downtown. Lots of options for kids too. My 2.5 year old son loves the teriyaki chicken bowl. The owner is such a nice person, he will go out of his way to accommodate you. If you're looking for something fresh and fast this is the place!"}
{"text":"The service was fast and friendly. I ordered the teriyaki chicken salad that's was really good with great flavor. I would definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"The Salad dressing is soooo good here!  I think this is a great place to go in a hurry.  Much better option over fast food.   The Miso soup and salad is amazing.  The Avocado roll is one of my favorites, too.  My husband really likes the Combo of Beef and Chicken Teriyaki bowl.  I love that you don't have to pay a tip, too!  It makes everything faster when you order at the counter!  The place is very clean and has plenty of seating.   They also serve alcohol."}
{"text":"Decent food for a quick/casual bite. Great service, fast, easy. Would go again. Cheers!"}
{"text":"I always go to Samurai sams for my teriyaki chicken but thought I'd try and branch out.    I gotta say I don't think I will be back to samurai sams.  This place has much better chicken, the vegetables are really fresh, I had the spicy teriyaki chicken bowl and even the food looked pretty, the presentation in the bowl was so nice.  I loved it, my new place for teriyaki for sure!"}
{"text":"this place is not as good as the one in mesa, the food just didn't taste as authentic as the Mesa location"}

{"text":"Ask for all white meat chicken or you will get handed a bowl with grizzly dark meat."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! Everything is soooo good and fresh. I always get a chicken teriyaki veggie bowl with brown rice and a Las Vegas roll. I also love their selection of drinks, particularly their green tea. If I didn't live so far, I'd probably eat here everyday. Definitely recommend!"}

{"text":"I love this spot. Best fast sushi around. I get the Vegas and the avocado roll. The staff is friendly. Convenient location for me. Try any of their sushi! All of it's great."}
{"text":"I made a Yelp account JUST to post about how terrible this Yogi's location is. For the past 4 years I have frequented several Yogi's locations throughout Arizona and California, and this one is BY FAR the worst. Every time I try to give them another chance, they fail horrendously. Not only is the quality of the food terrible (wrong ingredients, fried rolls soggy and/or under-breaded), but the presentation is just as bad. Today I ordered a Las Vegas roll and it was unrecognizable. It didn't even taste like other Vegas Rolls I've eaten at other locations. Again I've frequented multiple Yogis and each location other than this one has had the same presentation. This one was soggy and under-breaded, and they didn't even cut the rolls all the way across... it was just big uneven chunks that were all connected to each other! They must've been struggling because the whole roll was smashed and sloppy. I also ordered the crunch roll which was halfway decent in quality, but what really put me over the edge was the fact that they included the inedible shrimp tail INSIDE of the roll. If it wasn't for their messy presentation I would have never noticed this and could have consumed it. Do yourself a favor and refrain from ordering sushi rolls from this location. I will now be traveling 30 minutes out of my way to enjoy rolls from a proper Yogis location."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE IT! The Philly roll with cream cheese and the Hawaiian roll are my jam! I about tried everything on the menu! Plus the staff are very friendly and helpful. They know exactly what everything is and give you good suggestions! If you want some quality sushi that's fast and amazing then go here.. It's a little high in price but it's worth it."}
{"text":"Not bad spot for chicken & rice. Able to eat healthy brown rice all white meat & veggies. Always a go to, when feeling fast food but want to stay healthy. They don't let you use their wifi but have 3 of them??? Sushi not bad here either, egg rolls also on point. They have Dasani flavored water"}
{"text":"Our first time here and We were the only customers in here and they took more than 30 minutes to give us our food. I get there are take out orders and need to be delivered via uber and all but take care of your customers in house too. It's ridiculous. Never coming here ever again."}
{"text":"Fairly good. For the price you get a lot of food. Some items are a little bland, and noodles could use some work. But 4 stars for the staff. The female order taker is always very nice."}
{"text":"Excellent service! Delicious food for a relatively small price. The Vegas Roll in particular is an adventure of flavors for any sushi lovers. The Teriyaki bowls are hearty and tasty. Just be sure to add some extra, complimentary teriyaki sauce from the counter. It's damn good."}
{"text":"This review is for their new place in N Avondale on the NW Corner of Camelback and Dysart Roads. I went there on a Saturday just before noon and no customers were around :O Turns out, they don't open until 12:00 on Saturdays (which, surprised me) and they are closed Sundays.

They serve only Sushi, Tempura, Teriyaki and Salad dishes. 

Their salads are AWESOME (5 stars)! I ordered both the Beef and Chicken Teriyaki plates (served over rice with a nicely portioned salad w/ a great tasting Asian dressing). Both the plates were good, but nothing special (3 Stars), with some Soy sauce added.

I want to try their Tempura dishes. But, someone else can have the Sushi."}
{"text":"Due to a miscommunication, I ended up with their Chicken Teriyaki Salad, instead of a large Garden salad with their Asian dressing (this alone is well worth a visit). But, I was still able to get the Asian Ginger dressing and it made the Chicken salad awesome.

But, unlike another reviewer, I found the staff to be attentive and helpful. Since, this is a walk-up order & pick-up, you can't expect the high level of service as at a sit-down restaurant."}
{"text":"Been here about 5 times. Food is always great, along with the customer service. Order your food at the register and they bring it to you. Always clean. Great sushi for the price and coveinenance."}
{"text":"Got the regular size beef teriyaki veggie bowl and it was pretty big and yummy. A little overpriced for other things on their menu like their sushi. Fast service."}
{"text":"Don't expect anything fancy but you get great bang for your buck! My hubby and I call in to-go orders all the time and they are ready for pickup in 10 minutes! Service is always friendly when we call and pick up as well."}
{"text":"First time trying his place, it was alright, not somewhere if drive out of my way to go to but if I was near the area I would eat it. Had the garlic butter noodles with beef, my favorite part was definitely the rice, reminded me of a jape see neighbors rice. Had a Hawaiian drink which was pretty good, it wasn't bad but nothing really stood out. Will have to try something else to wow me I guess."}
{"text":"We ordered 7 different dishes to try, put them in the middle of the table and it was a grab all.  
For the price you pay, the food is adequate quality.  The ambiance is nice and clean, nothing fancy.
If you're expecting top quality sushi, you won't find that here, it's a realistically priced place, great to take the kids."}
{"text":"This place is wack, waited forever for the food and it was cold. Cashiers are rude. Go to waba y'all don't waste your time."}
{"text":"I stopped in for a quick bite to eat before the movie at the Harkins. Just what I wanted, no waiting for a waitress or service. No waiting at all, as a matter of fact. Ordered my food and it was ready. Sat down at the clean table, ate and was on my way. I loved the teriyaki sauce on my chicken and beef. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Food, prices good. But the eye candy during weekday lunch!!!hellloooooooo nurse!! Officers, detectives, office types. LoL

Beef or chicken lunch special with drink $7.79.

Edamame good size and delicious.
The California crunch roll is delicious too."}
{"text":"Called in takeout late Saturday night, about 30 minutes prior to their closing.

I gave them an opportunity to tell me it was too late to call in my order. They seemed happy to help me on the phone. The attitude was a bit more brusque when I arrived 10 minutes later. I know the drill. It's not easy working a long customer-facing shift. Putting on the happy face and attitude can be challenging as things are wrapping up. I would have gone 4 stars had the service experience been more personable. That said, Yogis lands dead center in Average Zone with 3 Stars.

I got Teriyaki Steak and Chicken and an order of steamed veggies. When I arrived I went for the impulse buy with some of the $1.50 kimchi advertised on a post-it on the side of the register. The Steak and Chicken were a bit on the dry side but still hit the spot. The veggies were delicious. And I'll pass on the Yogi variety of Kimchi next time.

I'll be happy to give Yogis another go in the near future."}
{"text":"Although I never go here for sushi or have even tried their sushi, I go when I have a teriyaki bowl craving. They are right next to Sports Authority, lots of parking, and it is a place to get inexpensive good food quickly. 

We were in a time crunch and starving. We only had 15 minutes to get something to eat and we decided to visit Yogi's. Not very many customers were in the restaurant on a Saturday afternoon so we walked up to the counter and ordered the large chicken & beef teriyaki veggie bowl. 

The portion was perfect to feed two starving people. There was tons of meat, veggies and rice. What I love is that they didn't drench the food in teriyaki sauce. The meat and veggies tasted fresh and delicious. 

The total was less than $9 to feed two people. Gotta love it and we were out of there in 15 minutes!"}
{"text":"I have been ordering lunch at Yogis for my office weekly for the last two years. Over the last few months we have noticed the quality decreasing and the price rising. They add ridiculous charges for spicy mayo!?!?!  We no longer feel the cost for a shrimp tempura roll with a side of spicy mayo is a good deal $9.77 with the spicy mayo charge. Absolutely ridiculous. Thankfully there are better sushi restaurants close by that appreciate their customers. Yogis does not."}
{"text":"The food is good. The place just recently opened and I think is ironing out some issues with service however, the people are pleasant and you get your food fast. A pleasant change downtown."}
{"text":"This place is more of a fastfood type. I oreder yakisoba butter noodle with beef and miso soup. The food was served on styrofoam. The soup was hot and was serves in a foam cup. I am not a big fan of hot soup in a foam cup. The food is affordable. The serting is no for dating night. If you are hungry, it is an okay place."}
{"text":"The food was great as expected just like all the other locations. The service was extremely great. They were fast with getting the food out, they helped immediately when my kids made a spill, and the place was very clean."}
{"text":"Mmmmm love the sushi. My husband came home with the Dragon roll last night and I really enjoyed it. Today I had the Vegas roll and was also pretty good. Next week I'll try another one of their rolls...So far so good..."}
{"text":"We show up yesterday at 8:45pm and were told they were closed and could not order.

So once I get out of work I rush right over tonight and was told take out only. It is 8:20 pm. They close in 40 minutes well that is what the door says but we really know it is 8:45pm because of what happened lastnight.

I like their teriyaki chicken that is their only saving grace.

When the door says closes at 9:00pm I should be able to walk in at 8:59pm and order."}
{"text":"My First YELP review!

I work by Yogi's and you know how it is trying to find something other then subway or cheese burger for lunch...so I noticed Yogi's opened right next to a failed Moronis hot dog shop by the Harkins theatre by work so I thought I'd try it.

I am a big fan of Teriyaki so I tried their Chicken, beware if you like veggies on your Teriyaki then you order the Veggie Teriyaki which I did not see when placing my order...I been back at least once a week for past month and I have introduced a couple of my co-workers to this joint as well as my wife and kids for dinner once.

simple, clean and friendly - if you smile they smile back...

If you plan on going frequently get their Rewards card, every 5 dollars you get a stamp and at 10 stamps you get 1 item from the menu.  Already redeemed 1 card about to fill my 2nd.

I like good sushi places like Sakana and the now closed Zen32 so I cant compare Yogis with those places but for a quick lunch roll or chicken bowl, you cant go wrong."}
{"text":"It's good..cheap..clean...did I say cheap?..I like coming here never a bad experience. ."}
{"text":"This place is great for a quick sushi lunch! The workers there were really nice. I had a question about something on the menu and they answered everything very professionally and without any attitude. The place is super clean too and has a great layout. I ordered the shrimp and veggies tempura and it was really crunchy and yummy. The batter held on really well and the sauce that came with it was also good too. I also ordered half a crunch roll (which came with 5 pieces) and it was really, really yummy! The reason why I didn't give them the perfect score is because the price was a lil too high for me to come over a lot. For all I ordered and a small drink was about 17 dollars and I think that's a lil high. Overall, besides price, I would definitely come again for the food and the great customer service I received."}
{"text":"I have been going to Yogi's for years.  Since they opened the Chandler & Kyrene location I now there as it's closest to me.

The restaurant is always spotless, every table is clean, as well as the floor & trash cans.  I love that.  It's so disgusting to go into a restaurant & see filth.

I could eat the food several times a week!  I order the white meat chicken & vege. bowl.  The chicken is always so moist & tasty, vege's perfectly steamed w/ a slight bite. Never over cooked.  As good as that is, the brown rice is amazing.  They cook it so moist, it's almost like risotto!
I know that Edamame is easy to prepare, but I can never resist theirs.  Always hot & slightly salty.

I read the other review & it's confusing as I have nothing but good things to say about Yogi's Grill!"}
{"text":"I'm hooked!  After a new job brought me to the area, I've been going 2/week or more.  Good if not great teriyaki chicken/beef, all-white chicken and brown rice available, better then average pot-stickers (gyoza), and a very good \"fast food\" sushi menu.  Spicy teriyaki is available, and I actually found it to be too hot (I _never_ say that!).  I had to cut it with plain teriyaki sauce!  Also, the restaurant is spotless, the staff (after 8+ visits :-) friendly and efficient.

5 stars, as compared to other Japanese 'fast food' places, like Kyoto Bowl for example."}
{"text":"Great food and I love the choices!  The kids like to eat there too which is a plus!  my sons and I love the teriyaki chicken and they have a great variety of rolls.  We stopped in for a bite before seeing a movie a few weeks ago.  We will definitely be back.  Great choice for a quick meal!"}
{"text":"Excellent food with an extensive selection of fish, chicken, tofu, steak and veggies prepared many ways.  You can have tempura, sushi, salmon, crab, salads anything and everything we selected tasted very good. I ordered a crab and avocado salad and then a side of six piece shrimp tempura and my boyfriend ordered the California sushi roll and teriyaki chicken; we were both extremely satisfied considering it's a fast food service style place.  I can't wait to come back for the lunch specials and other exciting things on the menu.  The menu selection with interesting and healthy options was my favorite part.  Counter service was also extremely friendly."}
{"text":"I really like eating here. I enjoy! It doesn't taste processed it really good! I usually get the spicy teryaki bowl (which is huge portions wether you get the reg or large) and it's so amazing! I'm only giving 3 stars because the yakisoba was not cooked how it's usually cooked the other times we've gone here and the sushi was warm. But hopefully we won't have this issue again!!! I will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Just because minimum wage went up doesn't mean you only staff two people for lunch. Slow service. Old avocado. No salad. Staff your restaurant."}
{"text":"Last night, we decided to finally try Yogis after driving by it for months. It was worth the stop, but not the best meal I've had. I'd say it's 3.5 stars and I'm willing to give it a second chance in the future.

They have a good menu with lots of different options to please everyone from the carnivore to the vegetarian. Several different rice bowls and a few combination plates that looked promising, as well as a sushi menu.

I had the yaki soba and my wife ordered a chicken rice bowl with the spicy sauce. We also tried a couple of sushi rolls and the gyoza appetizer.

The rice bowls are definitely their best offering while the yaki soba was adequate. Pass on the sushi and the gyoza; there are several places in the area that do a much better job and at an average price of $9 for a roll, you aren't saving any money here.

I'd say Yogis is similar to Samurai Sam's but with a better menu selection. Go for the rice bowls, but don't bother with anything else."}
{"text":"Yogi's is set on the back side of a retail complex at Ellsworth and Baseline, between a pool store and a Starbucks. It is usually busy, as a testament to good food and fast service.

My customary order is the Arizona Bowl and a Crunch Roll. The obviously imitation crab is still tasty on perfectly cooked rice. I've never had a bad bowl. My man gets either the chicken, beef or combo bowl. Each has perfectly cooked meat and flavorful sauce.

Recently I gave the Tofu Veggie Bowl and the Katsu Chicken a try. The tofu was good, with the teriyaki sauce over it just enough. The steamed veggies were just plain, and a bit too al dente for me. Still a good choice. My man said that the katsu was tasty, but a bit \"chicken nuggety\". I think that this may be because he is a fat and dark meat guy. My white meat self probably would have liked it.

As for the sushi rolls, I think that they are best left to a real sushi place. The Crunch Roll is always good, but it is tempura, so I don't worry as much. In this fast, plug and play restaurant, there is no possible way that the sushi ingredients are fresh.

A nice addition to the restaurant is the Coke Machine. I like the range of options. But in the close quarters, be ready for other people waiting for the machine in your personal space. Ugh!

Overall, Yogi's is a fast and tasty place to go for sit down or take out if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Yogi's Grill is a staple in our house. With Hawaiian and Japanese fare, there is always something to try. The restaurant is always clean. The staff is friendly, and prepare meals quickly. Take-out is always packaged well. My only warning with that is about the miso soup. It is so hot (temperature), that it melts the styro cup lid. So be careful when you take it out to eat.

The teriyaki bowls are always good, beef and chicken both, with not too much sauce. They will add more onions for free, if you so desire. The sushi rolls are tasty and fresh (Americanized, of course). Our staple is the Vegas roll. The other appetizers such as tempura shrimp and vegetables are also great. Edamame is lightly salted. The Arizona bowl is one of my favorites, with fresh lemon and avocado. We normally opt for brown rice in our dishes. In the tofu cutlet bowl, you get basically a whole block of tofu. The veggies sometimes are a bit al dente for me.

I recommend pretty much everything here, and will be back for sure. Typically once a week!"}
{"text":"yogis is to sushi/japanese as panda express is to chinese.

i have been in here twice. the first time the service was alright, and the food was lackluster. the rolls were small and looked nothing like the ones plastered all over the wall. they were served in a styrofoam box. the second time i went in the food was even worse. the girls in the back were chatting while i waited up front for about 2 minutes to order. she was extremely unpleasant. it took them about 5 minutes to make my simple teryaki bowl which was filled with little, thin, fatty strips of dark meat and topped with [yuck] green onions. the sauce was alright. not even siracha could help this bowl.

disgusting."}
{"text":"A pesar de q el precio sea un poco alto y la atención no Tan buena, debo reconocer que este lugar tiene comida rica, aunq los previos son caros como para ser un fast food, en fin amor la carne y el pollo teriyaki, el udon y yakisoba es bueno, el pescado q le ponen a los rollos sabe rico"}
{"text":"You know, I'm not that big on pretty strip malls. I'm also not a fan of Americanized anything food. I also think teriyaki is very rarely done well and certainly never done well in a pretty strip malled, Americanized Japanese restaurant.  

That's why, my dear Yelp friends, I was extremely surprised (and that is why I've given this place 5 stars) because this place tremendously exceeded my expectations. 

On my way home, via my mini, to visit the parents in Phoenix, I stopped to get gas and pick up something to eat. Thought this would be an average place but decided on it because it would be more healthy than the restaurants around it.

I walked in and was immediately welcomed by smiling faces. After 5+ hours alone in my car, it was quite nice to walk into a place with friendly faces. I was surprised to see that they had a wide selection of Asian drinks and even candy/snacks like Hi-chew! I scanned the menu and opted for shrimp tempura roll. I must say, it was pretty darn delicious. The shrimp tasted very fresh, as though they had just stripped the shrimp of its shell, battered and fried it as I ordered it. They also gave me a sample of one of their best selling beef teriyaki, and that's when it really hit home that this place really cares about the quality of their ingredients. The beef was friggin' awesome. Like mouthwateringly you-don't-get-this-quality-beef-in-strip-malls good.

High quality ingredients really makes all the difference

P.S. Extra props for being right next to Yogurtland. :)"}
{"text":"We really didn't know what to expect because it was our first visit, but wow it was great and now we are really full lol and happy. I Would highly recommend the Arizona bowl which is basically a California roll in a bowl it was awesome."}
{"text":"This place is great for a Hawaiian roll not insanely expensive. Limited seating indoors."}
{"text":"We've been there twice because I got coupons to try this place. The food itselfs very good but I'm giving it two stars because the service is not great.

First time we went there we had to wait for over half an hour to get our food. Dont get me wrong,  I know this isn't a fast food place but over 30 min waiting when you travel over here a 1h lunch hour is excessive. 

The second time we went we had the same problem or worse.  It was the day after Christmas.  The restaurant didn't open until noon and by that I mean the kitchen was also closed so when we arrived nothing was ready.  We ordered at 12:35pm and got our food again over half an hour later. Because of the coupon we had to spend a certain amount of money so I ordered a sushi roll and I was told it couldn't be done because they were very backed up in the kitchen but a couple that arrived after we did got served first and the got not one but two sushi rolls.

Their teriyaki's good and I guess they make their food when you order hut certain things could be changed. Like if you're gonna open at lunch make the cooks go a little bit earlier to start cooking rice for sushi rolls and for teriyaki plates or lunch specials which include rice, have the soda machine ready to go so customers don't have to wait for minutes and in line to get their drinks and somehow in general speed up the process in the kitchen because it's a shame their food's good but people can't wait half an hour at lunch time to eat and go back to work since some people only get a 30 min lunch."}
{"text":"We ordered sushi from Yogis Grill last week. The food arrived on time and in fancy packaging, however, it seemed like the sushi rolls were made by a three-year-old who knows nothing about sushi or wrapping. The tuna smelled a little fishy, but I thought it is going to be ok. Two hours after the meal, all of us got sick from the food. The food wasn't cheap and it got us sick!

Thank you for an expensive mistake Yogis Grill"}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times. I go for the caterpillar roll with the eel. I'm never disappointed and this food is a lifesaver when I'm on a budget but don't want to eat burger king. So fresh and light. I have problems with my blood pressure and the first time I tried this place I had gotten off work and I was having a pressure headache and my husband took me to Yogis, got me a caterpillar roll and some green juice from someplace and I was literally healed on the spot. My headache went away and I didn't feel sick and weak anymore. It's like that food brought me back to life, I've been hooked ever since."}
{"text":"I went for the first time today and got salmon teriyaki and a california roll. Both were really good. For a walk-up place, you can't beat it. It's not a sit down sushi place, but then you're not dropping $100 for a meal, either. I thought the service was good. Very friendly folks at the counter. Will def go again."}
{"text":"Call the Health Dept!!! Went at about 8pm this evening, and right after we ate here tonight as we were getting ready to leave we saw a cook throw out the trash in the huge dumpster out front, come back in and as he was walking in he was rubbing his beard and go back to the kitchen (that's open to see) start cooking!!! HE NEVER WASHED HIS HANDS!!! We left and a person in my party has since thrown up and has made several restroom trips, it is now 10 pm.....I will be contacting the AZ health dept. the store directly tomorrow morning! STAY AWAY!!!!"}
{"text":"Worst experience at a restaurant in my life. I came here to pick up a group order for my company. We always have a team lunch on Fridays from 12-1pm. We pre-ordered from Yelp Eat24 and the pickup time was 11:30 am. I got there almost exactly at 11:30 and asked if it was ready. The employees were all very confused and no one had any idea where it was. After asking to see my confirmation email, the employee helping me walked away and never came back again. (I thought she was going to check the computer or something.) Um, okay. Still standing here.

When I finally got someone else's attention (they're all running around like chickens with their heads cut off) I had the confirmation email ready. It indeed had the right date, location, and pick-up time. They INSISTED that they didn't have a ticket for it and there was nothing they could do. What?? We had already paid for this order, so... I'm just supposed to walk away?

I got the first employees attention again to see if she could help me figure it out because my parking meter was going to expire in 2 minutes. She again insisted that there was no ticket, but she acted like she'd go check again and left. At this point, it's now 11:48 am and I had to run outside to put more money in the meter.

At this point, I'm trying to get ahold of Yelp. A representative starts calling the place--I heard the phone ring THREE times, but no one would answer it. They still didn't until I got someone's attention saying, \"Excuse me! That's Yelp calling for the third time so my order can be made.\" After talking with the representative, I assumed it had been sorted out. She went back to the computer, messed around, then got back to working.

Now it's 12:17. Still nothing. A different team member comes up to me to see why I hadn't been helped. I explained the situation to her and asked if we could write it down and have the cooks prepare it. They could figure it out later with Yelp. YES, finally.

The order is FINALLY made and handed to me at 12:45 pm. That is an hour and 15 minutes after it was supposed to be ready.

For the love of God, STAY AWAY from this chaotic, disorganized, shitshow of a restaurant."}
{"text":"Keeping it simple, Yogis Grill is an excellent choice if you're in the mood for sushi or other popular Japanese dish (albeit Americanized), but don't have the time or money to eat at a fancy Japanese grill.  

The 4-Star rating is not comparing it to a high end sushi/Japanese restaurant, but rather comparing it to others in its own class.

The service was great; we weren't rushed.  The facility is well kept and clean.  We got our food in a few minutes after ordering, which is a huge plus over the typical 15 minute wait for sushi.

The food was surprisingly good.  We ordered a teriyaki chicken bowl and two different sushi rolls.  Honestly, it wasn't bad!  

Here's what kept it from being a 5-Star (in its class):
The soysauce was watered down and the wasabi was weak.  

Overall, a surprisingly good expereince for a fast food Japanese restaurant.  I'm sure I'll find myself here again when I'm in the mood and in a rush."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this location for over a year now since I work in the mall, and today I was just a little disappointed and have been noticing a change in moral of the restaurant. The employees don't necessarily greet customers with positive vibes or smiles or really a hello, just straight to business \"so are you guys still looking or are you ready?\" When it's not even busy. I enjoy the food here and will continue to come back, but I mean as a customer, I don't want to feel like a \"burden\" when I come in to order my lunch. I'm hoping that things turn around."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I have gotten others addicted. If your on the fence... you better run here."}

Oh and a great staff of hard working and friendly people. Tables don't sit dirty here. They keep it nice and clean. Plus they have a drive-thru! 5*"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I have NEVER written a bad review on yelp (I usually don't fell it's worth my time but I can't help it) The food is good. The owner is an a**! This place sells sushi, if you are like me you want a little ramakin of some sort so you can dip your sushi in soy instead of pouring it on top. For the first few months he just PRETENDED that he didn't have any (when you get them when you order potstickers)...

However today, he decided that he is going to charge 25cents for those tiny little containers.

SOOO if you want to work around this, you must ask for a water cup, and put your soy in there

OR for fun, just ask for one and watch how they all respond (any of the employees) it's clear that the \"ramakin nazi\" has given clear direction for everyone to pretend they don't exist. \"I'm sorry we don't have any\"

I'm sorry, but I work in this area and I (unlike many) go buy lunch EVERY DAY! (Like I said in the beginning, the food is good) he would be making WAY more money off me if he would just give out the stupid ramakin. But instead he has made the \"great\" business decision to charge 25 cents (or not provide one) causing him to loose potentially $75 per week (just from me)"}
{"text":"Pretty bad stuff--greasy, poorly prepped, unauthentic food.  I had the shrimp and veggie tempura.  There was a carrot an inch thick in the tempura that chewed like a tree branch...then it just slid completely out of the horrible tempura shell.  The rest was saturated with oil and not enjoyable.  They use fresh produce, but put no effort or thought into prep and execution.  They need experience and leadership in the kitchen.

On the positive side, the staff were friendly and the place was clean."}
{"text":"Love this place! Yogis does not disappoint! Fresh food, friendly and fast service! My fav is teriyaki chicken spicy all white meat with a side of broccoli!

{"text":"I have worked in various types of restaurants since I was 16, from high-end sushi to pizza shoppes to drive-throughs. I understand how annoying it is when you're nearly closed and people come into it, TRUST ME; but I have never been so rudely treated as a patron (with no complaints or issues) than I was here.. 

Their teriyaki bowls are delicious. Gyoza shared with my boo could have gone without and won't order again. Haven't tried their sushi because it was unavailable as I came in \"too late.\" I smiled and ordered something else but was still disrespected and very rushed out. I ordered my chicken teriyaki bowl 20 minutes before close (because it's pre-made) and when my boyfriend was still eating at 9:00 exactly they flashed the lights on and off urging us to leave. 

Then talked amongst themselves complaining we didn't leave immediately in a language my boyfriend understands.. Nice. The saddest part is they were done with all closing stuff, and closed at 9 o clock on a Saturday. That's early for any restaurant on a Saturday in my opinion, and I really don't think it would've killed them to politely wait maybe 10 minutes for us to finish before shooing us out. I really try to be considerate of closing times but that was complete BS to urge us out not even one minute after they closed. Come on.. 


Not to mention I was overcharged nearly 10 dollars on my card and when I got the cash after the mistake, I got no receipt to show what had been messed up.. Not only that but we tipped more than $6 on a $20 order to get the service we did. Not impressed."}

I had to go there anyways for something else, so I just gave up and headed out.  I got there before noon, and there was a line of like 5 people, but it was taking FOREVER to move.  I waited for over 15 mins, because I was ordering for a coworker too, only to get to the register and they told me they weren't doing sushi anymore.  WTF?  There was no note on the door, no note on the register.  If they had done that small courtesy I wouldn't have been mad, and I DEFINITELY wouldn't have wasted my time waiting in line.  I asked again, and the (manager on duty I'm guessing) said 'I shut sushi ordering off 30 minutes ago', with absolutely NO apology.  I can't believe it.  HALF YOUR MENU IS SUSHI.  Lots of people ONLY GO THERE FOR SUSHI.

I wasted half of my lunch time only to get no food and leave without even an apology.  APPALLING."}
{"text":"Love the food. Been coming here for quite some time. I came in today to notice they got a new menu display. It looked very nice. Then I came to notice their prices got raised. The prices were raised by a lot. I was almost in shock a little. I was not expecting the prices to raise as much as they did. I come here so frequently, I think I will limit the times I come here now with their drastic price raise. A little disappointed. :("}
{"text":"Probably will be our go to teriyaki spot. Good food, wish the meat weren't cut so minature but flavor is good. Would be a solid 4 for food and overall experience but had to subtract one star for the lack of dressing on the salad. No dressing on the salad, none on the side...we're hoping it's just a one time mistake and would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Yummy food and an A+ staff. Young lady at the register is so incredibly friendly. Finding something positive to say to everyone who walks through the door. The support staff is also kind and friendly. It appears that this staff is treated well by their leadership. Thumbs up for happy employees, good food and good leadership."}
{"text":"My wife and I had lunch here on Oct 4, 2016 and were pretty disappointed with the food.  Service was fine, but the beef teriyaki we got was so over cooked it was like eating cardboard.  The two sushi rolls we got were ok, but nothing interesting -- basically grocery store sushi."}
{"text":"Their chicken teriyaki is extremely fresh and full of flavor (especially with sriracha) and their thai tea with boba is amazing."}
{"text":"Ahhhhhhh I love yogis the service isn't all the great (the cashiers aren't very friendly or welcoming) they make it seem like a hassle that you walked in but I still go almost everyday for the spicy tuna rolls and edamame LOL can't stop me"}
{"text":"Nice place. Clean environment fast service and food is great. Tried chicken and beef bowl it was amazing."}
{"text":"Great food. Great location. Everyone is always very friendly.  Best chicken teriyaki bowls."}
{"text":"I haven't been to other Yogi's Grill in the area, but I stopped by here while I was driving cross country from the west coast to the east coast.  

The food here is pretty good! I had both the chicken teriyaki and a few different sushi rolls from this place.

The sushi is fresh and the rice was good.  I've had worse sushi at other restaurants, but the sushi here was good!!

The owners of the restaurant were there when I was there and they were very nice and friendly.  The place is under new ownership.  They've been there for about a year now.  

I would come back!!"}
{"text":"This place is great!  I ordered the large chicken teriyaki.  The rice is excellent, the chicken is grilled right, and the portion is generous."}
{"text":"Yogis Grill has the best Chicken & Beef Teriyaki here! I always get the meal that comes with the shrimp & vegetable tempura. The miso soup is delicious as well.
I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Food is good. Just check your order because they mess up a lot. Hours seem to change a lot. I usually get the steak bowl. Portions are good always have leftovers."}
{"text":"Alright, this isn't the first time I've seen a mess here, but this time was awful! You're serving raw fish and seafood, for goodness sake!!! Make people feel comfortable with food they're about to order! There were only a few customers there around 6, and they were not understaffed. I had to ask for my table to be wiped down and the employee walked over and just wiped MINE down HAHA! There were at least 6-8 more tables that needed to be wiped down!! On top of that, there was dried soda on the floor making it sticky, as well as food scattered underneath nearly all the tables. 

My biz is on Yelp, so I pay attention to all feed back seriously in order to maintain a great reputation. So I really hope this can help management. You need to hire some better quality employees or just someone to buss. But man... really felt like I walked into a run down Fili-b's for a second. How they were graded at an \"A\" for food quality and cleanliness is beyonndddd me. Really disappointed, because I love myself an AZ bowl, but I think this is my last time at this location."}
{"text":"This was a fantastic place for the price. Tons a food and quick service. I would recommend this to anyone in the area."}
{"text":"We placed an order over the phone and when we went to go pick it up they messed up the order. I understand that but what happened was is that the new employee started arguing about the order that I placed. Taken back a bit, I told him exactly what I ordered and he kept arguing with me. His manager, Julian came up and joined the argument. I was surprised at his approach...but also that his employee was telling him to shut up when he was trying to fire the order along with charging us correctly. The employee then said \"don't worry about it...he's my brother\".  I was already late to get back to the office so I just took whatever they had and as I was leaving the employee said \"if you don't wanna have problems don't place multiple orders\" obviously he only got the job because his \"brother\" is the manager but the owner should really be apart of the hiring process."}
{"text":"The only reason I can't give it five stars is because of how slow the service is but it was worth the wait. The yakisoba noodles and the garlic noodles are great. The terriyaki sauce is delicious too. My daughter loved the edamae and the chicken kids meal."}
{"text":"I ordered the Chicken Katsue plate the chicken was hard it seemed that it was under cook. I also ordered the chicken Jakisoba and the cabbage had like mold spots in it I told the cashier then the cook came out and dumped a hand full of cabbage on my plate and said to me this cabbage does not have mold. I'm never going back the cook was very rude."}
{"text":"I did not go in to the restaurant to eat, I ordered from this location through GrubHub, and their service was fine. I was not impressed with Yogis food, and I doubt that I will ever order from them again. I ordered two Teriyaki and Tempura Combos, one chicken with rice, and the other chicken and beef with 1/2 rice, 1/2 vegetables. What arrived was two combos with chicken and rice. The receipt showed the correct order. We decided that since it was late, and it wasn't a lot of extra money, we would just not worry about it. Unfortunately, the chicken had a bitter, charred taste. We also ordered the potato croquette, which was a total waste of money. It wasn't worth $3.49 for one flavorless mashed potato patty. I will say that the Pot Stickers and Tempura were very good, but our meal plus delivery was $52.00, and just not worth it."}
{"text":"Food is always great and decently priced. Sushi is awesome! Stay clear of their noodle dishes!"}
{"text":"I stopped here for dinner last night and it was really enjoyable! We got a little too much food - a Spicy California roll, a Dragon roll, the Arizona bowl, gyoza and their croquette - but it was all very good. I appreciated being able to get my sushi fix without having to drive further or go to a more expensive restaurant, and the Arizona bowl was really delicious.

The way they serve the food in disposable containers does seem a little wasteful because of all the trash they generate. I can understand it being handy to take food home without getting a separate container, but they cut off the lids to the larger meal size containers anyway, making it impossible to do so. I think they could be a little \"greener\" and maybe even save some money by using less plasticware.

Overall, definitely a place I will return to!"}
{"text":"Great place for fast sushi and a great teriyaki bowl.   I know  the word \"fast\" may conger up images of \"fast food\",  but that's certainly not the case here at Yogis.  The sushi rolls here are pretty good,  although I've never ordered any of their other sushi.   My favorite is the Crunchy,  stuffed with shrimp and rolled in what I assume is panko.   Their bowls seem to be a step up from most other places,  The meat is sliced into thin ribbons,  and the use of sticky rice is a great touch. 

The service is always fast,  but the staff won't go out of their way to be friendly. Overall a great place to stop for good Japanese when you want it quick!"}
{"text":"Delicious, I am from California and this is the closest thing I could find to a yoshinoya style restaurant"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The owner, Jason is always helpful and ensures we are happy every time we pop in! With me being a picky eater, they always know what to suggest... and I'm always a happy camper when I leave!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here 5 times now. It's quick, affordable and delicious every time. Would definitely recommend it to others. The steak or chicken Yakisoba is excellent. Cheers!"}
{"text":"I've only had the Arizona bowl and crunch till, but they are both excellent. Service can be a little slow at lunch during the week, but other than they it's a great place."}
{"text":"OMFG wtf....... I just came from this yogi's grill, and I am so pissed right now.  I have been to about 2 other yogis grill in AZ and it's always been great........ but wtf is up with this one. I ordered a large beef bowl and came home and there is barely any fucking meat in it......... What the fuck is wrong with you people


UPDATE: 10 mins later.... I just finished \"eating\" and let me tell you, This was by far the worst Yogi's grill I have ever had.  The meat was super dry (like a day old dry) , chewy, and burnt.  I can't believe this place is still open.  To whoever owns this yogis grill: Do yourself a favor and close it down... you do not deserve to own a yogi's grill, you are giving this franchise a bad name........ suffice it to say, I will never set foot in this one again!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Super bummed out that I can only give this place 3 stars.  I was excited to try it as the menu seems similar to Samarai Sams (where I used to live) and I'm always looking for a healthier option for fast food.

We ordered to go and when we got home we opened the containers to discover that our 2 orders (both were large chicken teriyaki bowls) were different.  1 was correct and the other had half the chicken, no sauce and no garnish...I do believe this was a mistake and that the container got closed before they finished it?!  We took photos and are going to go in and I hope they rectify it but regardless this shouldn't have happened in the first place.  Dock a star.
Secondly, the majority of the chicken was charred to the point it tasted burned.  Quite disappointing.  It was also fatty enough that we had to pick fat off the slices.  That was also not cool.  
The teriyaki sauce is quite tasty and their portions are good.
All in all I don't see myself returning on a regular basis but I will probably give them a second try..."}
{"text":"I love this place! Healthy selections at a very affordable price. Never have to wait long for food even when it's busy.

Samantha, the cashier/server/busser (really, she was always doing something) was great! She's the reason I decided to re-download my yelp app so I could leave a review. She was so upbeat, friendly and on top of everything!

Great food, better service"}
{"text":"We order lunch at work about once a month from here.  Never had a complaint about the food until today.  Seems like the last few times we've ordered they have become more stingy with the teriyaki sauce.  For it to specialize in Teriyaki items it needs a bit more teriyaki flavor.  When you ask them for extra sauce they assure you there is some in the bag.  4 small containers for a 6 item order is not enough extra.  They also changed their Chicken teriyaki salad.  It's now just a pile of what looks like bagged coleslaw and a few cherry tomato's with the chicken on top.  It used to be a mix of lettuce, carrots, cucumbers and some fried noodles on top.  This is not a change for the better.  If they went back to the amount of teriyaki sauce they used to put on when we first started ordering and went back to the original way of making a SALAD then we would change our review to 5 stars as previously we had.  
Overall not a terrible place but they seem to have made a few changes that are not for the better but for their cost saving purpose."}
{"text":"This place reminds me of when I was a child. When life was simple,  when such simple pleasures as getting a new yo yo, or getting to spend the night at your best friends house was the greatest excitement in your life. I feel as though this fine dining establishment has captured this through teriyaki chicken and tempered California rolls. 
 So next time you are in search of nostalgia or maybe you are about to go search for the lost Dutchman's gold, stop by Yogis and fill your gullet with these oriental delights."}
{"text":"Prologue:
After a long day on the road my girlfriend and I were in the mood for something for dinner that was quick, simple, and with some protein but not too heavy.

The Plot:
We shared a regular Chicken Teriyaki Veggie Bowl and a Tofu Cutlet Veggie Bowl.

The Scene:
This was exactly what we were looking for.
The portion size were very good and more than enough for the two of us.
The chicken was a good quality cut, tender, flavorful, and evenly sliced into bite-sized pieces.
The tofu skin was nice and crispy and the texture of the tofu was just firm enough.
The amount of teriyaki sauce was good and the flavor was not too strong.
The ratio of rice to protein and veggies was also good and better than some other places I've tried where you get a lot more rice than anything else.

The Rest of the Story:
I agree with some other reviewers about the prices being higher than usual, however the better quality and larger portion sizes make the place a better deal than the other teriyaki rice bowl franchises.

Epilogue:
This will no be our go to place for teriyaki rice bowl.

{"text":"Yummy! Quick grubs and filling serving sizes. Sushi rolls were yummy and BIG! Price about average for hawaiian/asian diner.  I'll go again for some rolls and rice bowls, the udon soup was alright.  Not much flavor to the broth without the sriacha."}
{"text":"Headed out for lunch today hoping to go to Shogun Express, but not knowing if it was still around.  Pulled in, and while I saw that it was gone, it had been replaced with Yogi's Grill...since I was going to a teriyaki chicken bowl, it didn't matter to me who's name was on the door...

Not too crowded when I walked in, and a nice bonus to see that they had the World Cup on (though weird that they were running the closed captioning...in espanol).  The queueing system was awkward, it was unclear it the line from the register went left or right.  The line(s) moved quickly, and soon enough I was at my table waiting for my food.  The gal at the register never gave me a number, but I got it from the receipt and eagerly awaited my number to be called.  And waited...and waited a little more.  I'm sure in reality it was 5-7 minutes, but generally it seems that chicken bowl places are much quicker than this.  Anywho, eventually, another gal comes out and asks my number, then hands me my food.  Kind of weird, think it'd rather you just call my name or number.  

The bowl was fine, nothing out of the ordinary...the sauce did not strike me as good as what shogun used to have back in the day, but it was still a tasty meal.  If I'm ever feeling like a chicken bowl, I wouldn't hesitate to go back to Yogi's."}
{"text":"Good food, a little pricey but they have the same quality as the more expensive places so worth it. Fast service and everyone is very friendly. The only problem I have ever run into is when I order with soy paper, on many occasions they have done it incorrectly and done the seaweed and I get home before I realize it. It has happened about 5 times. The most recent today but when I called they take your name and number so when you return the next visit you get what they messed up the first time for free. When I called this evening I was told this happens all the time. If you have this issue often enough that you have a process for correcting it I would think you would work on fixing the problem but that's just me. Other than that one issue I enjoy this place and recommend it. Just check your order before you leave if you order to go! :)"}
{"text":"We used to be frequent customers at this location. We have had many hit-or-miss experiences with the quality of food at this location (one time my wife ordered a meal and the avocados served in it were completely brown). After the terrible and unprofessional service tonight we will never return   to here or any other Yogis grill location as well. After waiting 20 minutes in line when we had finally reached the counter we were told that they were completely out of white rice and all of the ingredients for sushi. What kind of an Asian/sushi restaurant runs out of white rice and all ingredients for sushi. It is unbelievable that there was not a single notice posted and that the cashier did not even bother to explain to us that they were out of almost every item on their menu while we waited in line wasting our time. The management is obviously doing a poor job running this restaurant and I would not be surprised if it closes down soon. The management needs to get a clue! If you own an Asian restaurant you should ALWAYS have white rice in stock. When we went in tonight, they were out of the ingredients to make almost every single item on their menu. Save yourself the time and hassle as well as your money and avoid this restaurant at all costs!  You will be glad that you paid the extra money to get some quality sushi instead of some poorly made sushi with bad ingredients that you will have to wait hours for. Who knows, maybe if you go in, it will be like our experience where they tell you that they are all out of white rice and every ingredient needed to make sushi and then you won't even have the opportunity to waste your money here on a subpar meal."}
{"text":"This is not a sushi bar.  It's a simple order at the counter and eat-in or take-out type of place.  So based on those prerequisites I give this restaurant 4 stars.  Why not that one last star?  

The TV is always on the dumbest news channel possible.  I can't remember which one, but it's awful.  Don't  put a TV in your establishment just to put it on a ridiculous biased news station.  How 'bout Comedy Central, or sports, or maybe switch it up now and again.  This is why we don't sit-in much, but we live close and enjoy eating at home.  

The sushi and the rest of the menu is great!... and I don't even like sushi that much!  I like the Spicy California Roll and the Las Vegas Roll, although the Vegas Roll doesn't do well as a leftover.

I have ordered and picked up dinner for 5 and they had it ready in 15-20 minutes.

Make sure to look at the menu on the outside of the windows, that is the only place you will find the descriptions you need to make an informed decision about the tasty meal you will soon devour."}
{"text":"We had the beef and regular udon. Soup would have been delicious but arrived cold!"}
{"text":"I love their food! One of my favorite places to eat! I would give this location 5 stars, but in my book to get 5 stars you should have exceptional customer service. If you want great customer service you will, sadly, not be able to find it at this location."}
{"text":"WARNING: GIANT BLACK HAIR IN FOOD!!!

I wish could give this place negative stars, not just for the disgustingness of the above statement, but for the handling of the situation afterward.

We ordered Yogi's for takeout for our family of 3 fairly good eaters. I was only a few bites into my large Teriyaki chicken/beef combo, when my fork produced a THICK, 10-INCH LONG BLACK HAIR. Nothing is quite as awe-inspiring as a LONG BLACK HAIR, DRIPPING TERIYAKI SAUCE, on the fork you had been putting into your mouth. Yum. So impressive was this sight, in fact, that it inspired my entire family to throw their food away and eat PBJs for the night.

I'm not unreasonable. And I get that, even in this age of Health Compliance, Hairnets, and Ponytails, sh*t happens. Just be a little more careful next time and give me my money back. NOPE!

I called YOGI's to let them know I wasn't interested in their hair products. A polite, yet ineffective kid answered the phone. After telling me the manager, Brian, was gone for the evening he asked why I needed the manager, and \"MAYBE\" he could help. He couldn't, but that didn't stop him from wanting to hear the whole story before letting me know that.

He told me to call back the next day at 5PM.

NOPE! \"Sorry, you just missed him. Try again this time tomorrow.\"

NOPE! \"sorry.\"

The day after that I called at 2:30 just to give Brian a little well-deserved nap time.

NOPE! \"Wow, he never leaves this early.\" Truly a fascinating oddity.

Next day, 11:30AM, \"dees bryn.\" F**KING GREAT!! You see, Brian apparently doesn't speak English very well. I have absolutely no problem with other cultures or people seeking their pot of gold in America. In fact, I think it's great. It's just difficult to communicate OVER THE PHONE, with somebody who knows 12 words of English.

Next thing I know, the kid is back on the phone, acting as Brian's semi-translator. They let me know that, if I can get there before 5pm (this is a work day), and produce my receipt from 4 days ago, BRIAN WILL LOOK AT IT. Not provide me with a fee meal, or give me back my money. LOOK AT IT.

F*CK the ranger, Boo Boo? NO F*CK YOU, YOGI's. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Rude staff , they are very disorganized and frazzled during lunch time. Refused to give me my money back on incorrect order. Dave/David is rude and needs to learn how to deal with customers

Update: I never asked for free food. I offered to pay the up charge on the menu. They proceeded to charge me for a whole other side of chicken.  While having the conversation my food wasn't even ready yet. Even through that the staff member was rude."}
{"text":"The poor reviews surprise me-- it's obviously fast-casual Asian food-- do y'all expect Nobuo or something?  Manage your reality.

For this type of food genre, Yogi's is spot on.  It's a wonderful place to eat healthy if you're being lazy and in a rush.  I come here a lot, and most often order a chicken teriyaki plate:
Perfectly steamed rice, awesomely simple grilled chicken, steamed veg (carrots, broccoli, cabbage) and/or a little green salad.

Swift, spotless, inexpensive, (if you start upgrading to brown rice, white meat, etc. it can add up), consistent, delicious, and healthy."}
{"text":"ENTER THIS STORE AT YOUR OWN RISK!!!!!! 

We loved this place!  I dont know what happened but 2 weeks ago we stopped on the way home for a quick dinner to go!  ordered teriyaki chicken bowl white meat.  Go home and cut went to eat a piece of the chicken and the meat was uncooked!  Ok so after almost vomiting, I called the store and spoke to a manager who was very very apologetic!  The store offered to record my name and we could get the next order free (which really is nothing because I paid for this meal and we couldn't eat it but I wasn't asking for anything)!   I just wanted them to understand how raw the meat was and that they check the food because people get very sick from undercooked meat!
So tonight we decide to give them another shot!  Go to the store at 6:30 and order the same thing and explained that our last  order was raw and the manager Told us to give our name the next time we were in so we wouldn't have to pay for the meal because we paid for the last one that we couldn't eat!   Ordered two teriyaki chicken bowls white meat only, asked to please make sure that they cook the meat well. Assuming that they would check the meal before letting it leave the kitchen,  we took the bag home opened it up and to our surprise the meat was raw see the photos attached.  I dont know if I will ever go back!  such a disappointment because we loved that place!  
ENTER THIS STORE AT YOUR OWN RISK!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I really like Asian bowl places. Obviously summer better than others. In my opinion this one and Tolpyo Joe's from my favorites.  What I like about this one is that they have a large size were you really get a lot of food. One of my issues with ball sometimes is that they're not filling, especially if you get the regular size. This place is location is great too because you can go see a movie then come out and get a bowl, one of my favorite things to do and it's healthy."}
{"text":"If you work/live anywhere in Mesa, this is the Go-To place for lunch. I have been here numerous times and each time the quality of the food amazes me. I get their Chicken lunch bowl specials (substitute white meat for $1 extra) with a drink for $9.

The portion is generous, with freshly grilled chicken on a bed of the best white rice I have had outside of a fine-dining restaurant. All of this topped in a sweet teriyaki sauce. In one word, it is amazing! Add on some Sriracha sauce and a touch of soy sauce and for the next 12-15 minutes, your stomach and face will be smiling.

If this is your first time going, try their lunch specials and go from there. Their sushi is also fresh, but not my number choice if I have a craving for it. Their Katsu plate is also dynamite (thinly sliced fried chicken strips with a Katsu sauce on the aforementioned white rice.

I highly recommend this place as a hangout spot with friends or a casual date. Did I mention the White Rice is amazing?"}
{"text":"i absolutely love this place. Its the first place I tried sushi and I got hooked on their food. my favorite is the crunch roll and the chicken bowl and their really great with special requests:)"}
{"text":"I like the food here and it's great that they have wifi. But... The employees always make the dining room their break room while I'm there. Laughing and talking very loudly. Also, the girls up front are usually on their phones and don't even put them away while taking the order. Also, when it's slow and you have a to go order that's sitting at a table near the counter, why would you scream their name out and make them walk to the counter? Why not just walk it out? 

To summarize: Customer service could be way better but the food is good."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a chicken vegetable teriyake and we've been back several times in a couple weeks.
Really good food. 5 stars. We'll keep coming back for more."}
{"text":"Love this place! Nice Remodel. I work nearby so its convenient and the staff is ALWAYS friendly."}
{"text":"I looked at the menu online and I was actually excited to try this place.  I knew it wouldn't be authentic Japanese cuisine but all my favorites were on there.  Who can turn down fast and convenient teriyaki bowls?  While we were there I also decided to get a sushi roll.  That was definitely a mistake.  It was filled with mushed up imitation crab and old avocado.  On the side was some dried up ginger slices and super bright radioactive green wasabi paste.  The yakisoba noodles were not as bad.  There weren't enough vegetables and the chicken was kind of dry.  I really like the noodle bowls at Samurai Sam's and these looked like they would be the same but weren't nearly as good.

Overall, even though I didn't care for my meal I would consider giving it another try since it is so convenient if it weren't for the price.  My husband said I just needed to lower my expectations and think of this place as the Asian Taco Bell.  But at least Taco Bell has 99¢ burritos.  We paid over $20 for two at Yogis."}
{"text":"I Walked in and sat in front of the cashier for five minutes staring at her while she played on her computer. Not one time did you say sorry I'll be with you a minute or explain why she was ignoring me, so I walked out and went ate somewhere else.
WORST service ever! I will for sure never be back so whoever was working at 9 o'clock last night should be fired"}
{"text":"Strong sewer odor as soon as you enter.  Not the best first impression.   Clean store and friendly staff though, thus the 2 stars."}
{"text":"I hit this place up multiple times a month if not weekly. Their lunch specials are vey reasonably priced. The beef bowls are a little bland but the chicken is great. I love their teriyaki sauce. Sushi is reasonable and the firecracker roll is divine!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. Killer Crunch Roll."}
{"text":"The bowls are great, but the sushi is NOT THE BEST! They don't clean their shrimp which is absolutely disgusting. True seafood eaters will know what I'm talking about, but if you go here, def get a bowl and that's It!"}
{"text":"Just an update... I tried their chicken teriyaki and it's just how it should be! Char grilled chicken, just enough rice, and the sauce was delicious! They still get 4 stars! 

However, I took California rolls to go and ate one at home later. My lips began to swell and tingle and my tongue too! I've never had an allergic reaction to a California roll in my life... So idk what it was in there, but I had to throw the rest of the order away. :-/"}
{"text":"We've been here a few times. Our order was a little messed up once but they were really nice and not only fixed it but offered some extra food.  The staff is always friendly & we like the spicy versions. Try the chicken yakisoba with spicy noodles & spicy chicken."}
{"text":"GREAT PLACE! And an even better staff! The owners are so sweet and helpful and really take the time to make your visit the best every time you come. We used to be avid Samurai Sams customers and since we found Yogis we have never looked back. Check it out!"}
{"text":"2 weeks ago I ordered at this restaurant with co-workers . My co-worker went to get the order and when we opened the bag we got the wrong food. The wrong dish and wrong sushi roll. Our current receipt / order ticket was correct but bag of food was not correct. I called back the store and the owner who spoke with me , and very frustrated demanded me to bring the food back because it was for someone else. I told him I was not going to bring the order back because I was at work working  and I am not really wanting something that I touched and started to pick at back sent to another customer nor do I want the food that someone may have touched back. So I do not want the food ...after arguing on the phone he offered me maximum $10 credit. I figured we did get a fair trade one for one item nothing more or less , although it was not what we ordered. I was ok and I said fine. I waited a week and nothing was credit to my credit card. I finally called back and the lady on the phone said the owner was not in the call back later. She said they can't credit a credit card they don't have , I said your owner didn't say that and she said call back when he's here. I was unsuccessful at getting him on the phone. I called again another day same thing owner is not there nothing she can do call back later. I called again today the gentleman who answered the phone said they're extremely busy and for me to call back again. I told him I am not calling back again I need to speak with the owner/ manager and at this moment  he hung up on me. I call back again the manager owner answered the phone and he said he would not give me my money back only a good credit and then hung up on me. I stormed up to the restaurant  I demand him to give me my money back the full $14 now instead of the $10. He looked at my receipt and laughed and said it's two weeks ago I am not going to honor and just leave my store. He wasn't even going to honor a food credit (which I wouldn't have taken anyways). He then waved his hand to shoo-ed me away and went back to the kitchen. In this case what can I possibly do? Of course I can go back to my credit card to dispute which I did but it doesn't penalize him for how he treated his customers . Theres nothing I can do besides shame him on yelp and rate how awful he treated me and how he handled the mistake they made on my order. I wanted customers to know of this experience and it can happen to them. I want to stress it's not about the $10-14 dollars that I'm upset about it how I was treated. Beware of this owner and his business."}
{"text":"A delightfully surprising meal. We're sitting here now and felt a review was in order - this is what we ordered: the Avocado salad had a WHOLE perfectly ripe avocado. It came with iceberg lettuce and I thought at first \"too bad\" ... BUT it was cold, crisp, fresh and I turned to my husband and said \"I'd forgotten how much I used to like iceberg lettuce - and how little we are served ice cold salads.\" Truthfully it was refreshing and tasty!! The chicken bowl was very good, as were the tempura vegetables - although the Tempura dipping sauce was weak! The California sushi rolls were huge. We just came from the gym and wanted a quick lunch and are very pleased with this little place."}
{"text":"Their Katsu and plates are pretty good! It's the only thing  I order when I come here so I can't say the same about any other dish yet. 

I ordered the Avocado Salad when I was hard core dieting, thinking it would have some spring greens or something proprietary but it was pretty much $7+ for an avocado on lettuce (wasn't even dark lettuce, it was kinda just lettuce rejected) so I don't recommend that but everything else is okay."}
{"text":"I think the low scores are here because this place is great at making only one thing on their menu. 

that item is the  teriyaki bowls, their other menu items not so good.

People LOVE the teriyaki bowls here, just don't order the menu items cause well they suck."}
{"text":"Great place, I love that they have a veggie bowl option.  Make sure when you order it though you specify that you want sauce on it otherwise it just comes out with veggies and rice.

Service is always quick and friendly and the price is great."}
{"text":"I was in the downtown location which I frequently stop by since they are downstairs from the building I work in and ordered a large side of chicken.  

It came in a larger container but was the equivalent of a small because I often order both.  When I questioned the kid at the counter, he said that is the large.  He went to the back and I'm guessing spoke to the manager and brought out the small container.  I dumped the \"large\" chicken into the small container and it fit perfectly and looked exactly like the \"small\" chicken I've ordered.  The kid at the counter took it into the back and came back out.  When I was waiting for a response he said that's a large.  I then asked to speak to the manager but he would not come out and talk to me.   I then asked for a refund and was told that could not happen and that I would have to \"email\" the address on the receipt for it.  

I told them that is not how a business is operated.  I was not leaving without anything.  I stood there for several minutes thinking the manager was going to come talk to me and when I asked the kid if someone was going to talk to me he said no.   

Then a talk thin dark haired guy, who I think was the manager, came from the back and violently grabbed my arm, told me I needed to leave and proceeded to physically and forcibly push me out of the store while I was trying to grab my wallet and receipt and said he called for security.  He then pushed me out the front door.  I went to security for the building because I work there, and they said no one called them.

I contacted the \"gmail\" account and via email provided the details of the incident and that I wanted my refund and have not heard back from them.  How does a refund work via email?  I'm not providing card information via email????  Additionally a police report will be filed for the assault by what appeared to be the manager.

Footnote:  Everything Jason said is not true.  I did not begin \"yelling\" and screaming\".  He's trying to defend his staff and consitent bad behavior.  This store has a bad reputation.  I have talked to my co-workers and they said the are very rude at this location and are super nasty to the Uber drivers checking their orders.  Some of our staff won't stop in at this location because of this.   I have heard other issues about this restaurant from many people that work in the downtown area.  He just has no defense.  His staff is not trained.  If they provided more chicken, why didn't they tell me?  That never happened.  The issue became my refund which apparently they can't do.  That being said, no one has the right to put their hands on someone else.  What does race have to do with this?  Is Jason a racist against white people?"}
{"text":"Last night a few friends and I went to yogis for sushi. We weren't sure what to expect but we thought why not? I ordered 4 rolls for myself and a few, first the cook scoffed loud enough for me to hear and said I don't like making sushi. Well dude it's just a job you get paid $10th/hr to do, maybe you shouldn't say that to the customers face? 

The rolls themselves were HUGE, which wouldn't be too much of an issue if they didn't fall apart. They did not stay together at all, they were very poorly made. Sure I wasn't expecting perfection but they were difficult to eat. The quality of the fish tasted low and there was an excessive amount of cream cheese. My two rolls were still $20, I expected them to taste quite a bit better. My friends rolls were also large and fell apart. They seemed rushed, there were 3 other people in the store, there was no rush. 

We have agreed to not return here again, it was not worth the money. Also, I haven't eaten since last night because I've been in and out of the bathroom since about 9pm. I don't have food allergies or sensitivities and I don't want to blame yogis but it is oddly coincidental"}
{"text":"Good food at a reasonable price.  I typically have the veggie bowl, which has teriyaki chicken, rice, and fresh veggies.  The spicy teriyaki sauce kicks it up a notch.  Their sushi is mediocre, but never makes me feel like it's going to give me a food borne illness, which cannot be said for all places that serve sushi."}
{"text":"We have been here numerous times and it never disappoints. Great food and all the employees we have dealt with have been very friendly and helpful!"}
{"text":"Wow! I'll stick to Wabu Grill! The staff acts put out by me being a customer and needing to place an order. There was one order ahead of mine for sushi and they told me it would take 15 minutes to make my one roll. It has dirty floors boxes stacked by a drain up front and again I literally walked in happy and the mood of the staff made me feel depressed and sad. Oh and as I was writing this the staff member bagging my order rubbed her hand in her face and mouth and touched my food. Yes I asked her to stop and wash her hands! Gross."}
{"text":"Yum!! Tasty and healthy. I didn't have time to cook at home or even run out and grab something so I decided to order from Uber eats. I had never even heard of Yogi's grill, but it looked good, so I'd figured I would give it a try. I don't order Asian food often because it is usually fried, heavy, over seasoned, etc...
I was very pleased to find that this was guilt free. Very light. I don't even think the veggies had salt on them. Some might not like that, but I for one love the flavor of steamed veggies. This made for a perfect dinner tonight. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Knocks the socks off of Samurai Sams. The gentleman that helped me was very pleasant and helpful. I had never ventured to a Yogi's Grill before but I am very happy I did. The quality of the all white meat chicken chicken teriyaki entree I ordered was great, it had that outer, flavorful, crisp grilled char but still maintained the inner meat moistness that should be provided and expected...as it was. You don't have to request nor pay an up-charge for white meat here cause that is how it is served son, all white.The sauce was good, really good. I, shockingly liked the regular sauce versus the spicy sauce. This is not normal of me. Could have been a moment, could have been an awakening to what I now consider a sweet tooth. I did not know I possessed sweet over heat. But I did and I liked it. Really good. Great cook on the rice, clean restaurant, friendly staff, good price and options...whats left?...oh, that's right, FIVE STARS :)"}
{"text":"Love their teriyaki and yakisoba!! Everything is always fast, hot & fresh... and most importantly - delicious! Great dinner option without spending the extra $$ at a Sushi restaurant."}
{"text":"GROSS! XP 

I had lunch here with an office group at a coworker's recommendation. It reminded me of Panda Express. I ordered the catarpiller roll for $7.49. It took FOREVER to arrive, which was ironic for a fast food place. If I have to wait 20 minutes for a roll, I'd rather get good sushi. My food was served in a styrofoam box, and it was disgusting. It was warm and squishy, and fell apart when I tried to pick it up with chopsticks. 

My friends ordered teriyaki bowls for a little more than $6. I tried some, and thought the meat was dry, and the teriyaki sauce was sloppy. The portions were small, and not worth the price. 

I will never go here again."}
{"text":"Sizes are big. A bit pricey. Food tasty"}
{"text":"I found about yogi's grill through one of my friends. this one just happens to be the nearest one to my house. First time I tried it I loved it! Every time I've been back they have the same consistent food! Their portions sizes for their chicken teriyaki bowls are very reasonable. My girlfriend loves their \"crunch roll\". customer service has always been good and store has been clean every time I've visited. We will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Yummy food but you have to wait forever. Every time I have ate here there isn't anyone here and yet it takes them no less than 20-30 minutes to make your food. I suggest calling your good in every time and giving yourself that time to drive there and have your food ready. I've already been waiting over thirty minutes tonight and there is only 6 people in the restaurant"}
{"text":"Just because this place is in a strip mall and is technically fast food, doesn't mean it's not the best chicken teriyaki bowl in town! 

I have only tried the chicken teriyaki bowl and each time, it's the best I've ever had. Wonderful sauce---not too sweet and superbly grilled chicken.

Every time I come out this way, I make place to stop in for lunch or dinner.

Best $7.50 you'll ever spend on a bowl and drink.

Nice staff too.

Someday, I will try their sushi."}
{"text":"I've eaten at quite a few Yogis Grills since they started opening up in Arizona a handful of years ago. Their teriyaki chicken is pretty good and you get quite a bit for your dollar. 
However!!! Two things. 1. No matter which location I go to the service always seems sub-par. It seems everyone that works at Yogis Grill just seems uninterested and lacks the ability to be friendly. *shrug* Its not overly bothersome to me but it would be nice to have friendlier service. 2. Their sushi, is not that good and they are ridiculously over priced. I can go to Kona Grill which is a nice restaurant and get much better tasting sushi for nearly $2.00 cheaper! I just can't get past how expensive their rolls are AND it doesn't taste much better then grocery store sushi. 

I'll still go there for teriyaki but not for sushi, its just not worth it."}
{"text":"Food is good but the staff SUCKS. Lazy and inattentive in person and forget about calling an order in, they don't even answer the damn phone!!! Frustrating as hell. Get a new staff and get a MUCH better review."}
{"text":"Awesome food! Very helpful and pleasant staff. Always fresh and delicious DUDE! Great place for take out food. Convenient place with their own parking spots. They are accepting orders by phone, and have great lunch specials. My favorite is their chicken teriyaki bowl. Don't forget to get loyalty card, one free meal with purchase of 10."}
{"text":"The food was fine, the prices were fine, but we will never go back to Yogi's, and I warn anyone who will listen not to either, because of how inept and rude the cashier was yesterday 9/8/17 around 5:45. I called Yogi's after finally getting home to get her name. She said it was Gabby. 
I had ordered for my family, drove all of the way home, and one meal was missing. Upset, I drove all of the way back, and calmly let Gabby know what happened. I expected at least an apology. What I got was her questioning me and grudgingly getting my meal. Also, before I left, she actually questioned the distance I said I had to drive, saying I had only been gone \"like 10 minutes\". WFT? Well, Gabby, I said it was 5 1/2 miles. Round trip it was actually 6.4 miles. A trip I will NEVER make again!!"}
{"text":"We love Yogis...just not this location. 2 orders of Hawaiin Rolls and Miso Soup. Both looked sickly. Do not recommend this place. Asked for a refund."}
{"text":"Ahhhhh my first time ever having a California roll deep fried. Definitely not disappointed and will absolutely be back to eat more of these. The service was just ok but the establishment was clean and tidy. Minus one star because the pot stickers were extremely crunchy"}
{"text":"Yogi's is my cheap/quick low carb paradise!  Their low carb teriyaki bowls are kick ass!! A gigantic serving of tasty, lean meats over a bed of steamed cabbage, carrots, broccoli, and zucchini! Woo! If rice is your thing, you can get some nice sticky white rice, or well prepared brown rice, too!  
Another thing I love at Yogi's is the Arizona Bowl. It's basically like a big bowl of California roll fixins!!!
Their Sushi is quite good too!! Their California roll is always fantastic, and they put the SPICY back in Spicy Tuna. I've been a Yogi's fan for years, and the food has always been consistently well prepared, and extremely fresh.  The only thing I've not been too thrilled with at Yogi's is the Spicy Teriyaki.... not so good, Al.. not so good... 
ALSO. Closed on Sundays.. for genuflections, or something."}
{"text":"The food here used to be really great but the last two times we've been, someone ends up getting sick. Last night it was my 1 year old who was really sick and I had a horrible stomach ache. My husband also said his food didn't taste right. Not sure if the management changed, but something needs to be re-evaluated in their kitchen."}
{"text":"It's nice and clean inside, and the food isn't half bad.  Not too much else to say besides that, either you like it or you don't.  Solid 4 stars. :)"}
{"text":"I liked Teharu better, but this place does have greater variety and is much closer to home. It'll do when we get the craving for sushi lite and don't have time to drive."}
{"text":"Delicious! Wanted to try something new so I stopped by Yogis and I'm happy I did! I ordered the #3 chicken and beef combo (regular) and it was super filling, not too expensive and super tasty!! 

The staff was also super friendly!"}
{"text":"Customer service is non-existent. TINY PORTIONS and HIGH PRICES. I have been several times and they have yet to get my order right on the first attempt."}
{"text":"First time trying this place. It's basically fast-food in style, quality, and quantity. Customer service was fine and the restaurant was clean and well stocked. Miso soup was tasty, but contained no tofu, only a small amount of seaweed. Shrimp tempura was about 50% breading, not really hot, but more very warm. Taste was okay. Overall just typical fast-food experience but at sit down restaurant prices. Probably will not return."}
{"text":"I love this place!!..my favorite is the spicy California roll,Las Vegas roll and spicy teriyaki chicken bowl...oh and try their Miso soup delicious!!..I am just happy and satisfied with this place.will continue to eat here"}
{"text":"The food is nice and cheap. The setting is pretty casual and relaxing, and there are outdoor seating as well. I went and tried the teriyaki beef bowl and it was delicious!"}
{"text":"Just OK.  I had a Dragon Roll, Tempura Shrimp and a drink and it was $20.  I can go to a real sushi restaurant with real service instead of a fast food counter and pay less than that.  The eel on the roll was bitter.  I've never experienced that in all my years of sushi eating.  The shrimp in the tempura was tasteless.   Big disappointment all around."}
{"text":"Stopped in at the lunch rush. Man do they move bowls. The line was long but it moved quickly. This is probably my favorite location of the 3-4 I've been to. I went with my classic favorite Teriyaki Chicken, Brown Rice, White Meat with spicy sauce and a Ginger salad on the side. 

The meals are always consistent and the staff is super courteous. I recommend this location and will always come back."}
{"text":"Yogis Grill is one of my regular lunchtime stops - I am a huge fan of this place. Unless you visit them during the peak of the lunch rush, the service here is usually pretty fast and the serving staff here are very friendly.

The food here is great and their prices are very reasonable considering the portions you are given. They run lunch specials that also include a drink along with one of their Teriyaki bowls.

I have two favorites here - the regular chicken (A) or the chicken & beef (C). I usually like to order mine \"spicy\" style for a little extra kick. For an additional 99 cents you can \"GO LARGE\", which is quite a bit of food to put down for lunch.

Aside from the Teriyaki bowls, they also have salads, tempura plates and a pretty extensive selection of sushi rolls to choose from. The spicy tuna roll and standard-issue California rolls here are both very good.
Most of their locations in town reside in the east valley, but they do have a location in Phoenix at Camelback & 16th. Give them a try!"}
{"text":"This is a hidden joint among a very busy pavilion I like to refer to as the waterhole of Avondale. I never even noticed it until I found it here! Sometimes I crave sushi on the go and now I have found the place when I'm too lazy to go out and dine in. I wish it was cheaper but it's alright. I'll go back."}
{"text":"Love the sushi! Great lunch time place."}
{"text":"This is the 2nd time I have called the City of Phoenix for bad tasting water out of the \" Beverage Dispensing Machines\" When water taste very bad your just not sure what you're getting. They are not the most cost effective place to eat teriyaki chicken but it's not bad. I think they should have their Beverage Dispensing Machines checked and cleaned on a regular basis as recommended by the beverage company. They should also have some kind of good water filter installed to protect the customers from any kind of contamination. The best way to ensure that the soda machine provides safe, high quality tasting drinks is to keep it clean and well-maintained. Managers need to create regular cleaning schedules and educate their employees in how to perform the necessary maintenance procedures. Or call the company they bought it from and have them clean the soda machine."}
{"text":"The prices are decent for what they serve.  I was unhappy with the service and wait time to get my food.  This place was not busy at the time I went, & I waited about 15 min or more for my order to come out, on top of that I order a Lg chicken and beef teriyaki combo lunch special to go when I finally got back to my office, there was no combo of the meats, it was only chicken, so I ask you to check your orders before you leave this place. Now for the best part, I know WHY I waited so long for my order to come out, is because the staff was calling my order by a different name, I finally had to approach them and ask for my order, since people who got there 15 min after I did were receiving their food before me.  I don't know how they ask for my name but write something totally opposite of what I told them.   I hope this place improves over time.  This was not a good 1st experience for me....."}
{"text":"My wife absolutely loves this place! She gets the chicken teriyaki bowl at least once a week. The presentation is good, always hot/fresh, good flavor and decent proportions for the price. 

The customer service is way better than most fast casual restaurants! Especially the service provided by the manager at this location!

I'm not a sushi person but I have seen some amazing looking rolls coming out of the kitchen while waiting for food on several occasions. 

It's a little hidden if you don't know where to look. It's in the same strip as the Starbucks."}
{"text":"Never had a bad experience. Even if my family isn't in the mood for Yogi's, we will usually end up eating here because the crew is always on top of their game and we are in and out in no time. Tip: They have one of those new Coke Freestyle soda machines."}
{"text":"So this spot is close to Luke AFB right across the street from the Bashas on Dysart and Camelback. Its a small location, no booze, and it does have a restroom. Also, they do have an upgraded soda machine that has all the different flavored vitamin waters, lemonades, and all of this extra flavors for your soft-drink needs.

 It's a step up from whatever most fast food joints sell you. They have a good selection of drinks and offer a 10% discount to mil/fire/pol at lunchtime. It's just a bit pricey for a few bites of meat and a plate full of rice. It's nothing special in my opinion when you try and throw extra rice in to make your product look more appealing.

Largest outstanding complaint is their over-priced menu. They do have some spicy soy sauce that adds some well needed flavor (I'm assuming gargantuan amounts of MSG as their is no sign attempting to counter my assumptions.  

Eh, unimpressed but decent."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why this place has a low score, it's probably one of the best fast food asian places you can eat at! Again, I consider Yogi's Grill \"fast food\" quality food, not a sit down restaurant of any kinda. That being said, they have some great bowls that are awesome to bring to work or if you're on the go!

I mostly get the teriyaki bowl with chicken. I get the beef sometimes but I feel it's more dry compared to the chicken. I loved the char taste of the chicken, that taste that only can come from it being on the grill. 

My wife also got the chicken katsu bowl, and it is awesome! Super crispy and delicious and it's served with a tangy sauce that complements the bowl well! 

I wouldn't really get their Sushi though, it's so-so every time I've gotten it. But then again, who would get Sushi at a fast food joint! 

All in all, I really like Yogi's Grill for eating good but also eating healthy. Complex carbs and good protein, well flavored and perfect for a nice recovery meal from the gym. No wonder they opened right next to LA fitness!"}
{"text":"This is a one stop shop for your quick Asian food fix.

Yakisoba, Teriyaki, Sushi...this place has a pretty big menu. After going here a couple of times, I could do without their sushi. They charge about the same as your average sushi bar, but you get something that's not satisfying (very bland). Unless I'm desperate and looking for tempura smothered in eel sauce I won't be trying their rolls again.

For the $8 or so you'd spend on that, just get a teriyaki bowl instead. Or some of the other options. Also, there's a small assortment of Japanese snacks and drinks you'd find at the front of an Asian market (pocky, calpico, etc.)

For being something that is relatively different in such a bland neck of the woods, I'll be generous and give this place 3 stars. I'll be back whenever I'm catching a movie in the plaza, and hoping this place is better than what I can find in many mall food courts."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. I have been going here a few years and have never had a problem. Yogi's is AWESOME for fast, affordable, take out sushi. I also love the beef & teriyaki bowl. The staff is always friendly and fast. I definitely recommend Yogi's grill."}
{"text":"Poor customer service primarily by management. Food is good 85% of the time."}
{"text":"Sushi is not worth getting at all. The bowls aren't bad, but nothing special. They do have all sorts of sauces and spices you can poor over your bowl, which is nice. The outdoor patio area is nice for relaxing during lunch."}
{"text":"Recently tried Yogis for the first time with my coworkers, we had lunch postmated. I tried the chicken teriyaki which was underwhelming. The meat seemed like it was cooked earlier that day and the sauce was bland. We also got a few sushi rolls, they were edible but not worth revisiting."}
{"text":"Ate here last night.  Decided I wanted something other than a burger.  
First off..  Restaurant is clean, They have a bunch of stuff stored in hall to get to the bathrooms, i'm not sure why. 
Second... Love the coke machine...sad that half the flavors were \"out\" or not available
Third..  Prices are ok.  This isn't \"cheap\" by any means but it's not as expensive as other places. 

Now on to the food.  
I ordered the following: 
California Roll (Whole Serving) 
Teriyaki Steak bowl (lg)
Egg Rolls (2 count)

Before I even left the parking lot I could tell the egg rolls were cold.  I went ahead and just went home anyways because it literally took 25 minutes for me to get my food and the poor family sitting near the entrance were there before me and still had not gotten their orer.  

So I get home, unpack the food and take a look at the egg rolls.  Umm.. These are not egg rolls, these are Spring Rolls, or at least spring roll wrappers and the size of spring rolls. 
They were cold, the sweet n sour sauce with them was terrible (maybe it was a chili sauce? I don't know but it was terrible all around)  I had that one bite and decided to leave those alone. 

The Steak Teriyaki bowl,  All together a darn good dinner however there was a lot of fat chopped up in the bowl. I wish they could have chopped that off before they chopped up and cooked the meat..  Rice was good, was not a sticky rice at all, but cooked well. 

The sushi,  Wow  Pieces were not cut evenly, End pieces were literally falling apart.  A severe disappointment.  I don't expect perfection but could we not throw everything together and hope it sticks?

Overall, I live less than a mile away.  It's not likely I will go back.  I've been wanting to try this place for a while since it's next to the Starbucks I go to frequently and the bank.  However unless I'm going to run in for a quick lunch ($7.99 for a teriyaki bowl and a drink) It's not likely I will come back considering the flavor and taste as well as quality, were quite lacking.  

All together I spent $19.10 on the items above and a drink  It was enough food for my sister and I to eat no problem.  Just not a fan..."}
{"text":"When I first came in here, this resto had a non-A health grade. Apparently they've made all the necessary corrections because as of now it's an A. That's a good thing when you're talking about sushi!

Yogi's has various bowls, plates, noodles, salads, and of course, sushi rolls. I've only had the sushi. The rolls are made to order. I've enjoyed the Vegas, California, Crunch, Philly, and spicy tuna rolls. I've enjoyed them all, though the Vegas and Crunch rolls are my favorites. On a handful of the rolls, you can get them either full or half. I'll tell you upfront that if you get two full rolls you better be hungry! 

They have plentiful seating inside; no outside seating. It's on the end of the strip of stores on the SEC of 16th & Camelback."}
{"text":"Nice pleasant place, but the service not so much. The cashier seemed like she didn't want to be their and they got my order wrong. Unless you like ok food and shitty service highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I love this place for a quick teriyaki. I disagree w/ others who say its expensive I think it was right on track...Combo meat veggie bowl is my fav and their spring rolls are GREAT~"}
{"text":"We ordered udon noodle veggie flavor. The soup is just right. Not salty or greasy very nice. Firecracker is pretty good, too. My husband ordered fried noodle and not too salty either! Will come back again if in the area."}
{"text":"Wish I could give this place a good review, having eaten there multiple times but today it was just too much. There were four people ahead of me, two couples who all placed large orders. I watched one couple get the wrong order three times, they were still there when I walked out. It didn't seem like the cashier knew his head from a hole in the ground and constantly kept asking people what they had ordered. In the end I never got my food, which I had paid for, and just walked out as I had spent my entire lunch break waiting. I won't say avoid this place entirely, just avoid them around the lunch hour. They will leave you waiting."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place for lunch and I was pleasantly surprised! I got a chicken teriyaki vegetable bowl and half a California roll. More food than I needed but I wanted to try the sushi. The chicken teriyaki is delicious! The sushi is pretty good considering that this is fast food. The service was great my order was up fast. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Tasty food! Good portions and reasonable prices. A little attitude from the front staff, but I enjoyed the food."}
{"text":"The epitome of average

Avoid the mall food please and go somewhere better like Grilled Ave or Tokyo House. I ordered a very subpar spicy tuna roll with dried out fish mixed with sriracha and rolled pretty sloppily. What the beef bowl lacked in flavor it made up in chewiness and portion. (Great for people who want jaw workouts!)

Anywho if you want better food and are willing to drive about 5 min away theres better places right on the Lightrail/Tempe Campus."}
{"text":"I was just here 30 min ago. The guy there own the place. So be aware if you have an order that is wrong and it is their fault. Just know that they will not refund, exchange, or work with you on fixing it. We precisely ask the cashier if any of the food we ordered didn't come with a certain ingredient. He said no. So we went on with ordering. Got our order an the meal came with an ingredient that I'm allergic to. I could get a anaphylactic shock in his place an the owner wouldn't care. He said either I pay for another meal or have the cashier pay for it. Otherwise they can't do nothing. I was trying to communicate with him respectfully on why this was an issue. Unfortunately he blew up on me and said he had \"No Time for this\". The staff there are nice an respectful. But the owner will not stand down. He will make his workers pay out of their pocket for his problem. At least get the staff on memorizing the ingredient in the food that way they can save the trouble for a lawsuit. The food is great. Just double check on everything you order that way you avoid this issue.

The response below is absolutely not accurate. Exactly how the issue wasn't handle. An I specifically asked the guy. Did any of the rolls didn't come with meat. He specified the avocado roll, veggie roll, an cucumber roll. You mention you could look at the camera. An I was gladly very happy. Because my response and conversation was very much clear to where the person behind us could hear us. As we walked away the customer that was behind us. Said they heard our conversation and they sided with us. The menu is great. The place is clean. Unfortunately the manager can not deal with his wrong doing an does not want to own up to 1 costumer issue out of a day. It's a business where these issues will arise. Unfortunately he was stressed or maybe having an off day. The cashier had more remorse than the owner (below comment justifies). But you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"I've been to a couple Yogis grill. This is their newest one and I am so happy they opened one here in Peoria AZ!! Good food fast service and perfect pricing.  You get a lot of food for a small price.  I really love the spicy yogi sauce.  It reminds me of my favorite Korean dish called duk-boki.  Its not as spicy as i'd like but  it is tasty."}
{"text":"While I don't care for the teriyaki sauce they use on the chicken, I do like their sushi rolls. My favorite is the rainbow roll with no eel only salmon and yellowtail. Compared to higher end sushi places the prices are good and so far the sushi has been just as  good."}
{"text":"My wife an I stopped in here for lunch. Found the staff to be very friendly. I ordered a dish with a combo of beef and chicken.  All was good, except the beef. some of the worst I've had. it was like chewing a tough rubber band. I mentioned this to the wait staff upon finishing. Don't know if that would carry any weight with them upgrading their selection of beef. probably not. Long and short of it. Good food, \"just don't get the beef\"."}
{"text":"I love Yogis as I used to work at the #2 in Ellsworth & Baseline in Mesa for 3 years. Whenever I visit this location, beef and chicken are always dry. I went here couple of weeks ago and sushi had evolved into a half burrito. The guy grilling and the other one making sushi doesn't seem to be happy to be at work."}
{"text":"Great food, super fast service, and incredibly friendly staff!  My eight year old son loved the food as much as I did- and there was definitely enough of the bowl he got to take some home for leftovers the next day (and he definitely eats like a growing boy).  The price point was on par with other fast-casual restaurants and definitely worth the money for the quality of what we got.

For a healthy, fast dining option I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Stopped here one day to get lunch.. The store size is decent and they have a nice menu selection.. For a fast food Asian restaurant the food is pretty good and better than what you can get from Panda Express.."}
{"text":"The chicken and rice dish is just fantastic..always hot and the chicken is seasoned and cooked to perfection..lots of veggies steamed just right and they are still hot when I make the 10 minute drive home..I haven't eaten in yet, but they do have a nice TV and sitting area just in case you wanted to stop in for a game or two."}
{"text":"Great food but horrible service! I came in for lunch and as soon as I walked in the door the lady at the register completely ignores me until she finishes what she was doing and 15 minutes later she finally helps us and she had a bad attitude about it."}
{"text":"Great food always busy for lunch . Great hours ! Awesome sushi . Caterpillar roll and spicy tuna  roll California roll"}
{"text":"FORGOT MY AVOCADO ON MY CATERPILLAR! They were not even busy at all ! Just because chandler location is closed . Will definitely avoid and will go out of my way to not purchase food there . One Star"}
{"text":"Staff not all that friendly, prices way too high for what you get. I'll pay a little more for a real sushi experience. Sorry to all of those who like it, but this place is not what I had hoped based on reviews. :("}
{"text":"WARNING! I ordered takeout from here last night and have been super sick since. I ordered one Rainbow Roll, one Spicy Tuna roll, miso soup and garden salad... $24 dollars  and an upset stomach later, I'm terribly regretting my decision. This is the only sushi spot around me so I looked at Yelp, saw they had decent ratings, and placed an order. Now, I will admit - they were super speedy. They told me it would be about 10-15 minutes. I was happy to hear that. I arrived and the guy at the counter was super pleasant and even told me that he would recommend dinner menus per my suggestion. I got home, opened up my bag and looked at my meal. At first glance, it looked fine. I took a few bites of the Spicy Salmon and it didn't taste ANYTHING like it. Then figured I would move onto the Rainbow Roll. I don't know who made these rolls but they should be fired. The fish tasted old and I should have known better to keep eating it but I was really hungry. I LOVE sushi and never complain about my orders, but I promise you I will never step foot back into this place. The fish was paper thin and tasted like it was dragged across a dirty floor. I'm thoroughly disappointed with my experience and caution others from ordering the sushi there."}
{"text":"I went there again today and one more time they make a mistake and the excuse is that I order that on the phone and she can't do nothing about it. I great difference on price and what I ask. I ask egg roll and she made veggie roll so I spend 5.00 more for something that I don't even like it or ask about it.
Not the first time I have problems in the same place. 
The other time I bought Las Vegas roll with Salmon I pay for it but came without Salmon.
I'm so sad because It's a lot of money for not the best quality of service."}
{"text":"Terrible teriyaki. Not cooked chicken and seemingly only sushi. Terrible service and just overall a bad experience."}
{"text":"I am regular here and they always have hot fresh food good portion. Great fast service. I think prices went up for my teriyaki bowl with brown rice and veggies):"}
{"text":"Every time we have chosen to go to this restaurant they are closed! Do not order on any possible holiday or Sunday!"}
{"text":"Yogis Grill is coming soon to the Safway center at Val Vista & Elliot Road... can't wait!"}
{"text":"Great staff and the owner is friendly, clean store with one of those 50 selection coke machines. I always order the chicken Teriyaki in brown rice, and it's very good"}
{"text":"Okay in a pinch.

My wife and I stopped in here before catching a movie.  It's a fast-food quasi-Japanese place.  On the positive, the food seemed fresh, food came quickly, and things are kept tidy.

The negatives: The staff was Silent Bob-ish, the smell of bleach overpowered the food to a degree, and their teriyaki is more sugary that it should be.  I could barely taste anything else.  They committed sushi sin in that the rice was stale/dry.  The price was high for this kind of food, as well."}
{"text":"Excellent food, great quality. Would be 5 stars however the cashier told us it is \"impossible\" to sub noodles for rice in their teriyaki bowls. Said he was asked often but manager wouldn't allow. I think you should listen to your customers, Samari Sams is where we will frequent as we can get noodles in our Teriyaki Bowls."}
{"text":"I just love teriyaki bowls! Yogis is healthy, fresh, and quick. Lots of different options and helpful staff. It is always clean here and easy parking. If you're looking for a quick lunch or dinner definitely stop by!  My favorite is the spicy chicken teriyaki!"}
{"text":"I'm a regular here and always get the Beef Udon. This time i tried to have shrimp addon to the regular. They told me 1 tempura shrimp is $1 extra. Then girl asked me if i want the tempura or the regular shrimp. I ordered the regular boiled shrimp thinking i would get more, turned out i got only ONE boiled shrimp in my entire bowl. I tried to talk to the staffs and get the same answer: that's the pricing and only the owner can change it. And they really had attitude when explaining this to me. I dont know but it is pretty clear 1 tempura shrimp is more than 1 regular boiled shrimp. Either the staffs need to learn their pricing right or the owner needs to rethink the pricing. Wont return in the near future."}
{"text":"I love Yogi's Grill. I go there at least once a week. The place is spotless clean, and the food is much higher quality than Yoshi's, Tokyo Express, Kyoto, etc. They have a great selection of Ramune, a Japanese soda that I am addicted to. You also order at the counter and they bring it to you. The menu is varied from the usual, offering fresh sushi, yakatori, tempura and other items in addition to the usual bowls of teryaki. Their signature is the Arizona bowl which has crab and avacado... I'm yet to try this one. It's a quick lunch in Biltmore and has great food in a nice clean ambiance, they so far are doing MUCH better than the restaurant which was here before it. 

My only issue is they do not offer a spicy teriyaki sauce, you have to make your own using siracha, which is some spicy shit! By far my favorite rice bowl restaurant though."}
{"text":"Found someone's child under a dining table, decided to adopt it as my own, food was good"}
{"text":"Fantastic food and good sizeable portions. No little midget bowls here..Keep up the good work"}
{"text":"If your taste buds are craving sushi or a teriyaki bowl, this is a fast food Japanese restaurant that has both great food and service. They have a comfy dinning area suitable for a group or a night out with your love. Food has always been well packed for \"to go\" orders too. Excellent pricing for quick Japanese food!"}
{"text":"If I could give this zero stars I would. I stopped in here as it was convenient to where I was this day. I asked about the Shrimp Yakisoba and the girl pointed to the picture and said it looks just like that. It looked good as it had noodles, shrimp and veggies in the photo. After waiting almost 20 minutes and seeing folks that had come in after me get served, I was getting a little inpatient. The girl came out and said that they \"lost one of the shrimps as they are supposed to come with six\" and asked if I would mind one tempura to replace the one that was \"lost!\".. Okay?? She finally brought my food in a box (weird as it was to be eaten there not to go.. I literally had 2 sliced carrots and maybe 2 pieces of broccoli, tons of the noodles and rice? Wasn't supposed to have rice? I guess they figured throw some rice in there.. Lastly the dining room was filthy, there was a large clump of HAIR in the booth which made me almost lose my lunch! The girl came to \"clean\" the empty tables without wiping the dirty tables down! Ugh.... Needless to say I will not be back!.. I almost forgot about the girl cooking in the back which had a band-on her finger and was touching her face which preparing the food."}
{"text":"This place is phenomenal. I ordered the Arizona bowl and jalapeño poppers. And paid a total of $12.63 and for the price, it's ALOT of food and it tastes good. I wasn't expecting it to be such an amazing place. The customer service was good. I had my food brought too me and they were super nice. Good place. I'm happy"}
{"text":"Delicious healthy options at an affordable price. Yakisoba and teriyaki options are tasty as are the sushi options. Wife also recommends the miso soup."}
{"text":"Ordered through Ubereats and the order was messed up. Less than average sushi. Not even the California roll was good."}
{"text":"Love the Garlic noodles! Great food and nice size portions. Definitely on the short list of regular eating spots! Great teriyaki chicken!"}
{"text":"Really good food. Simple menu, but everything done really well. Never had a bad meal. They can get busy, so if you are in a hurry, do call ahead. No complaints! Friendly staff also."}
{"text":"Went for lunch yesterday and got the Chicken & Beef Teriyaki bowl (lunch special with a drink). It was yummy! It's cool how perfectly arranged the meat is on top of the rice. Good teriyaki sauce! Also tried some of the new garlic noodles that my boyfriend ordered and they were tasty too. Yogi's has the Coca Cola Freestyle machine now, which is always nice to have, although I just had iced tea. The place was clean. I've been here a couple times before but this visit was the best."}
{"text":"I've been going to this spot long enough to see 3 different crews, assuming this meant 3 different owners. Food was always excellent but today's visit meant so much more! Starving and anxious after leaving the Dr.'s office (after finding out I have food allergies), I decided to come here because rice is on the approved food list. The menu display was upgraded, place was clean, and I didn't recognize anyone that worked there (3rd new crew). When asked about certain ingredients, the cashier and cook were extremely genuine, helpful, and accomodating! I just wanted to give them a big hug because they went out of their way to make sure my meal was prepared accordingly. 5 stars for the food and service!! I'll keep coming back  :)"}
{"text":"Good food at a great speed and price. If want quick Japanese fix,  this is it. Nice \"fast food\" Japanese food."}
{"text":"Tried this location for the first time. Not as good as other locations. Their chicken was chewy/rubbery like it had been warmed in the microwave and they put green pinions on everything without asking. Other locations ask if you'd like onions, ginger and wasabi. I like the option and reminder to say no if I don't want the toppings."}
{"text":"The food taste and quality are consistent. The owners are rude but the rest of the staff is great. If you are there when the owner is working behind the counter be prepared to get dirty looks when you ask for condiments. I understand the need to keep costs down but it should be at the expense of customer of service. Ginger and wasabi should be included with your sushi. I shouldn't feel bad when asking for it."}
{"text":"Great tasting and well priced lunch bowl specials!!"}
{"text":"I was craving for sushi but had little time to dine in so I stopped at Yogi's off of Chandler and Kyrene for a quick bite. I ordered a salmon roll, something simple and easy.  I mean, you can't really go wrong with just salmon rolled in rice, right? ... This place proved to me you can.  I brought my salmon roll to the office, opened the box an Vuala ?! ... wasabi dried up and stuck to the container,  pickled ginger looked like it was sitting there for days, then... I opened my chop sticks, grabbed a piece of my roll ... and BOOM! It falls apart. Scared that I could possibly get food poisoning,  I refused to eat my lunch from Yogi's and ate the canned mushroom pate sitting in my office drawer.  Two stars because the woman who took my order was very friendly."}
{"text":"This place is conveniently located so I come here often. I don't get out of the gym until 830-845 PM so I make it there by 845-850 PM and EVERYTIME I get an attitude and they never have sushi.  I would go every night bc it's the closest place that serves a semi healthy option but I feel bad and I SHOULDN'T.  Hours of operation are until 9.  I understand it's almost closing but it's just bad for business."}
{"text":"Las Vegas roll is awesome.  Arizona bowl is tasty.  Husband loves the teriyaki bowls and tempura.  We love this place!!"}
{"text":"This is most definitely the worst teriyaki chicken I've ever attempted to eat. Even worse than my girlfriends attempt at cooking. I work on the west side and eat at the Peoria Ave location and never have any issues. For some reason the Tempe marketplace location is trash. I have no idea why they feel like they have to slice the chicken into paper thin strips of dried jerkey?? The amount of time it takes you to slice it like that you could just cut it normal and cook it properly. And the rice... ever cook rice, refrigerate it and try to eat it the next day? Yep. Oh well, this was my second attempt and won't be back until they find a different owner.
Avoid this place and just go to chipotle"}
{"text":"I love the food at Yogis, great taste at a good value.  I've been to this location twice and had bad service both times. The young girl that works the counter seemed very annoyed that I stopped in, no greeting, no thank you, just a sigh and role of her eyes.

I now drive a little farther to the Chandler Blvd & Kyrene location to get my Yogis fix."}
{"text":"Went there today because I wanted to try something new. The girl working the register looked like she checked out completely. I've worked food/clerk jobs and I get that it's about as much fun and being attacked by toddlers wielding coat hangers, but try and at least pretend you're being a professional. 

The food was about as boring as you can get, which when you're talking about a teriyaki bowl, is saying something. The sushi (crunch roll) looked and tasted like it was made entirely from canned/jarred ingredients. Everything was bland and easily forgotten. The one saving grace is that it's relatively cheap. Unfortunately, it tastes that way too. Needless to say, I won't be going back and would have been better served going to a fast food place."}
{"text":"If I could eat Yogis 7 nights a week... I dont think it would be enough. Friendly faces and great food! Of all of their locations Ellsworth is the best!"}
{"text":"Ordered the Chicken Teriyaki bowl for lunch and it was perfect for a post workout meal. I don't know if I would order sushi from here but definitely recommend the chicken and beef teriyaki staples"}
{"text":"This place usually gets pretty packed during lunch but they get their food out fast (unless you order sushi). I had the chicken teriyaki bowl, it was a bit on the pricy side but it was delicious. They deserve credit for being well prepared during their lunch hour!"}
{"text":"Best chicken teriyaki bowl in town!!  Clean and fun environment.... thanks John for the great customer service!"}
{"text":"I live on the east side and go to this location when even on the west side as there is no stores near our home. They front help never seems knowledgeable or helpful. I paid for 2 large chicken bowls with brown rice and white meat plus veggies for one. I asked for 2 side of spicy sauce to go. When she handed us our order I asked for 2 spicy and 2 regular. She said they were in the bag. They were not. 
We got home with no veggies. That is $1.49 extra. 
I call but the number is not working. Check it on the receipt and on here. Not working. 
I am not driving 8 miles for the veggies. 
You would do better to get someone at the counter who felt the customer was more important than the guy in back. I will have to really think before returning. Sad since we've been going since this place opened."}
{"text":"After many more visits, I can say THIS is the best Yogi's. Consistently great service and fresh food. You see the same people working the counter and kitchen all the time and they've got their act together!"}
{"text":"Service is terrible. We go different Yogi's around town a LOT. My kids like to eat the krab meat, so at every Yogi's we go to, we just order them a side of krab. THIS location wouldn't sell us an order of krab meat. I was in disbelief and thought that surely the gal had simply not understood my request, but her fellow order taker concurred that I couldn't. I was forced to order an Arizona Bowl (krab meat on top of rice) and when I made the innocuous request to put the krab meat into a separate bowl, I was DENIED. Whoever is running this place blows monkey nuts. You can keep your krab meat, you inflexible moron!"}
{"text":"I have tried the beef, sushi, Thai tea and boba here. Today I ordered the teriyaki chicken salad. It is delicious! Highly recommend! A new fave! The lettuce is firm, crispy, and green as it should be. Great quality! The dressing is so good. Employees are friendly and wait time is minimal. I am very happy and will be back for more!"}
{"text":"omg food was delicious. great customer service Katie was the best.  we had salmon teriyaki, beef and chicken and a croquette which was delicious.  my 5 year old even ate the salmon it was so good, they even have a wide variety of drinks. vegetables were super fresh.  we will be back"}
{"text":"could of sworn I've already written 100 reviews but this place is amazing.... salmon teriyaki is my husband's fav. I love the chicken and beef w extra meat."}
{"text":"I ordered half teri beef and half chicken with salad, the portions were huge and definitely hit the spot!!!"}
{"text":"this place is okay they are over priced for what you get but if you stack what you want right you can get a great deal didn't leave a good impression on me but that's just me"}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of teriyaki or these types of restaurants. Reminds me of Panda Express or Samurai Sam's. Gross. 

Many of my co-workers go here often and my manager raves about it. Finally, I caved in. I ordered the Chicken Yakisoba and substituted rice for extra veggies. The to-go box was completely full. Definitely could have made into two meals. I actually took 3 hrs to finish the entree while working. They were generous with colorful veggies which included zucchini, broccoli, cabbage, carrots. Surprisingly, the chicken was not drenched in teriyaki sauce, and the sauce was not heavily salted either."}
{"text":"Decently priced sushi that tastes pretty good! I've eaten inside the restaurant about once and have gotten take out from here twice I believe. The employees are nice, the store inside is a little messy but there is a lot of seating which is nice for when it's busy. The food is pretty good, good tasting for the pricing. I've had better sushi before but if you want sushi that's pretty cheap and not going to get you sick I recommend coming here. My only complaint is the last time I ordered out from here 3/4 of my sushi rolls were not cut. That was a pretty bad mistake on their end as every sushi roll should be cut. I wasn't able to enjoy my sushi like I normally would have since it was very messy and somewhat difficult to have to cut it myself."}
{"text":"Cooked to order delicious-ness as far as teriyaki goes. I was highly disappointed in the \"egg roll\" order I got. It was truly fried spring rolls. Customer service is maybe a little lacking. While ordering the cashier had to answer the phone and take an order, therefore messing up a special request we had for no seeds. But that's pretty much how it goes anywhere these days. It won't stop me from going there."}
{"text":"Love the teriyaki, how it's not too fatty, and the sauce is amazing! The crunch roll is good too, but the miso soup I got was too hot to enjoy and ended not feeling like it after it cooled down. 

Prices are a bit steep, but the quality is there. Will definitely be back when I'm craving quick Japanese!"}
{"text":"I eat here at least 3 times a week and I have to say the food is amazing. I usually order the yakisoba half chicken half steak and I am never disappointed. The food is always amazing anf fresh. I usually get greeted by Dany, who is always extremely nice and welcoming. Dany greets all the customers and has great customer service skills. He always asks how your foos tastes and genuinely cares about customer feedback."}
{"text":"Quick, consistent, and reasonably priced. 

Much better chicken and beef teriyaki than most of the local restaurants. 

Service is as expected for a food court type place. 
Cleanliness could be stepped up quite a bit as tables are sticky and have left over food on them."}
{"text":"Wow! This place has given Samurai Sam's a run for their money.

I stopped in today during lunch. It was busy, but I was helped quickly and my food was ready within three minutes. I ordered a standard chicken teriyaki bowl. 

The bowl was beautiful! You could tell that they really care about their food's presentation. They offer a spicy teriyaki sauce, and it was delicious! The meat was moist and flavorful; there was just the right amount of food.

The price can't be beat - more food than Samurai Sam's at a lower cost. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Ordered Chicken Katsu plate. $10.19. 
The chicken portion was generous. It was fatty and chewy. Their Katsu sauce was dumped over it which makes it soggy 
Salad was awful. Dressing was watery. The 2 CA rolls that came with it not so great. 
The rice was white and the best thing. 
W/small drink and tax $13. I could of eaten elsewhere for the same money."}
{"text":"Try the AZ bowl and tempura roll. Good prices and big size plates."}
{"text":"I came to use a bogo ....she told me i had to buy 2 drinks im like ok thats fine then she tells me they have no ice so im thinking you want me to buy drinks that should be cold but they are gonna be warm im like whatever thats fine....i try the sprite it wasnt even carbonated i asked if i was able to just get a cold bottle in the fridge...i personally feel she should have let me have it at that point but she said she had to charge the difference of 20 cents...i just feel that was rediculous...love the food but horrible customer service to my oppinion...she didnt even smile and say hi ...i did :)"}
{"text":"I so totally recommend this place for a good meal!  Teriyaki Chicken has the most delicious taste and the rolls are really yummy."}
{"text":"Food tasted great. We ordered two large teriyaki chicken. They serve a good amount of chicken and rice. They also serve sushi. We had our chicken plain. Their teriyaki sauce contains yeast extract which is similar to MSG. The wait was a little too long for a rice bowl. It was about a 12 min wait.  I hope since they are a chain restaurant they can work on revising their ingredient to rid the yeast extract."}
{"text":"OK, so I've only had the udon, but its great! The udon is deep in the menu, so I was skeptical at first, but its good stuff. The Shrimp Udon is the best, as I've since tried the chicken and beef versions. The udon is nice and thick and the soup comes out steaming-hot! Make sure you add some Sriracha if you can handle the spice! 

The restaurant has been nice and clean every time, and the staff has always been kind and helpful.

Easily beats out other Japanese fast-food types that I've tried before. Make sure you try some Aloha beverages, if you haven't already!"}
{"text":"4.5 Stars! 

Last week, I was in the mood for a teriyaki bowl.  I was about to drive down here and get one, but something came up and I didn't make it.  Fast forward a week, and my Yelp friend Brittany, writes a review of this spot (different location, same Yogi though).  Her pictures looked so good, and she raved about how good it was, so I knew I had to get one asap!  I decided to come down here for lunch today.

I walked in and browsed the menu for a brief second.  I went with a large chicken teriyaki bowl and a regular drink.  I think it was part of a lunch combo and my total was just over $10.00.  You pay the lady your money, grab your drink (Coke freestyle machine), napkins, fork etc. and then they bring out your food when its ready.  Took about 5 minutes or so, and my food was delivered to my table.  Here is how it was...............

Large Chicken Teriyaki Bowl-  Wow!  This thing was massive!  You can definitely split this with another person, or try to mow it down on your own if you are incredibly hungry!  I attempted to take it down myself, but fell about 1/4 bowl short.  HUGE portion!  The bowl was great!  It had a ton of chicken, perfectly cooked sticky rice, some green onions, and the perfect amount of teriyaki sauce.  You have the option to add more teriyaki sauce if you want, but I was more than satisfied with how it came out as is.  Flavors were awesome!  The chicken had a nice char grill on it and it had no \"funky pieces\" (there is usually one piece somewhere in the mix in a lot of teriyaki bowls...happy to say, this one had all delicious pieces of chicken!). The rice was perfectly sticky and held onto the sauce really well.  The green onions were a nice contrast in texture, too!  I really enjoyed this bowl!

Overall, I thought this bowl was fantastic!  One of my favorite spots is this joint called Aloha Teriyaki in Hawthorne, CA.  They make the perfect teriyaki bowl, and it's actually on my list of \"last meal type foods\".  Yogis chicken teriyaki bowl is right up there with Alohas.  Not quite as good (Aloha uses better teriyaki sauce and sauteed onions), but damn close, and this will be a repeat stop!  If you are craving some chicken teriyaki in Phoenix, this is your spot!  Can't wait to come back...real soon!"}
{"text":"Thank goodness for Yogis Grill!  Every now and then you crave a teriyaki bowl.  I had a bowl at the Yogis on Peoria last week, and woke up craving one , again.  I saw that this location was only about a 15-20 minute drive from my house so I drove down for an early lunch.  I decided to go with their lunch special (honestly, it's not a super killer deal as far as saving money, you basically get a soda for $1.00, so you may save .50 cents or something compared to normal prices.  But still...it does save you a little $$.) of a chicken/beef combo bowl and a drink.  My total was just over $10.00.  Not bad considering this is 2 full meals.  Here is how it was...........

Large Chicken/Beef Combo Bowl-  When I opened the container, I knew I was in for something good!  This thing looked perfect!  It had tons of chicken and beef covered in sauce sitting on top of a huge mound of rice.  I took a bite of the beef side first, since I hadn't tried their beef before.  Happy to say, it was delicious!  It was chopped up into little fine pieces, almost like carne asada.  It was char grilled perfectly and had a great texture.  I dug into the chicken next and I knew what to expect.  Once again, delicious!  Perfect char, no funky pieces...a damn fine teriyaki bowl.  I ate half of my bowl and saved the rest for dinner later that night.  It was just as good warmed up in the microwave a few hours later (could have used a little extra sauce, but it was delicious none the less.)! 

I am glad to know that this is here, close to the house.  This bowl tasted better than the one at the Peoria location, and will be my go to going forward.  The lady taking my order was friendly, and this place is rather large and very clean/open/new looking.  I'll be back very soon!"}
{"text":"It was ok.  I wasn't really expecting much, so I wasn't surprised.  The beef had a burnt taste.  The roll I ordered was deep fried.  I hadn't read the description carefully enough.  We did take out.  They did get the order correct which is a huge plus.  

I would rather go to a better sushi place for rolls, and search for a better quality teriyaki place.  It was late, we hadn't planned dinner.  For quick take out it's fine, but I probably would choose something else next time."}
{"text":"the food is good, well i only eat the teriaky chicken or beef bowls so i can't judge the rest but the reason for the 1 star is because , it's closed on sundays. and i live right next to this place.  i've never heard of a restaurant closed on sundays, specially a  fast food restaurant."}
{"text":"the food is ok, not bad, but I hate that they are closed on Sundays, at least the one by my house in Chandler Blvd and Kyrene.  the times that I feel like eating that are on Saturdays or Sundays because that's when I'm at home but if I feel like eating Teriaky food I can't because is closed, I never heard of a restaurant being closed on a Sunday."}
{"text":"I have no regrets with this place! Customer service was great :] YAY! When I go places to eat out, I always expect good customer service! The food was great! and the price range :] I recommend this place to anyone who loves sushi or Japanese food."}
{"text":"Well I went here probably a week ago. I like it. The teriyaki was okay, not the best but not the worst. A little on the pricy side but average for teyriyaki....;.. the sushi was reallly good though."}
{"text":"I love this place for teriyaki and sushi. The food is fantastic,  people are friendly,  service is speedy.  I recommend this place."}
{"text":"I usually wait until I visit a restaurant two times to write a review but this is my favorite Yogis Grill location thus far.

I'm a long time fan of Yogis. Their teriyaki and rice is to die for! I'm not big on fish or sushi so this review is based solely off of the teriyaki. What I like the most about Yogis is the consistency of each location. Unlike other restaurants, when you go to Yogis, you will get the same delicious meal every time. That's extremely important. Their soy sauce is amazing; especially the spicy!! The chicken and beef is always moist and savory. The rice is never dry. My mouth is watering. Each location also has the unlimited option Coca-Cola machine. 

The reason I like this location the best is the atmosphere. The inside is really nice. It looks new and clean. The lights are dimmed for a more intimate experience. The music was low enough to have a conversation but still had a nice thud from the bass. Unlike others I've been to, this location offers the sesame seeds and chili powder. The customer service was just okay. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I came here with my lady for dinner and movie date night and its honestly the best sushi I have ever had. John is a true professional with his outstanding customer service and his extensive knowledge of his menu! I highly recommend this spot to everyone!!"}
{"text":"Good food that doesnt feel heavy or greasy after. I recommend the white meat teriyaki bowl, white meat cost a buck extra but its worth it. People there get the order correct, so dont be afraid to call ahead."}
{"text":"It's close to work, regular teriyaki chicken bowls for $5.79?! I'm sold. It's also not a long wait for food. For military, you receive 10% discount (not sure if mandatory uniform or sufficient with just ID). They always include an extra small container of teriyaki sauce with all orders (meats already cooked with teriyaki sauce. I've tried their sushi and its so-so. Def a place I would recommend for those who crave teriyaki and/or udon (noodles)"}
{"text":"Place is the worse for knock off Japanese food....carne asada for beef bowl? Beer batter used for tempura? What a disgrace! The only thing that was decent was the rice and you really can't fuck that up:/"}
{"text":"I love the Udon soup! I lived in Japan for 3 years and it is exactly like the fast food Udon soup there. The prices are great as well and the Japanese candies and drinks are a nice touch."}
{"text":"This was my second visit to this place. Hands down the food is delicious. So far I have only tried the chicken teriyaki and rice bowl. It they have a spicy teriyaki sauce that is pretty tasty. Today I decided to get the mixed tempura add on which consists of one piece shrimp and 2 pieces veggie. I was not happy with the two pieces of veggies as I didn't think they were veggies. The young girl who works the lunch time counter here passed me and my complaint off to the owner? I think who seemed kind enough to replace my non veggies with actual veggies. My issue is how rude the young girl was afterward. I didn't realize that If a customer complains that we are. I longer worthy of of a \"thank you\" or \"thanks for coming in\" or even \"have a nice day\" 
Customer service is simple. Especially when the customer is being extremely nice about their complaint. However if you meet their nice with rude, it ends up on yelp. The Gist: Pro: good food so far Con: not the best customer service at the counter"}
{"text":"I was watching the boy on the grill shove a large pile of beef around the grill without any sort of technique and I even in a half joking manner told the cashier the guy needed some help as it looked like he had no clue what he was doing or was simply not very enthusiastic about his job. I bought the Chicken/Beef Teriyaki and was truly disappointed. The Meat was completely dried out and burned. You could tell the meat was very unevenly cooked. I was very hungry and had to return to work so I reluctantly stomached this travesty that became my meal. after I couldn't take the taste of the charred crunchy yet chewy bits of meat I scraped them to the side and the rice had taken on some of the charred black color from the meat. It looked like someone had broken up a lump of coal over the rice. I was not satisfied to say the least."}
{"text":"Really good always fresh! I tend to pre-order that way I don't have to wait a while and sometimes the lunch rush Monday through Friday can get a little hectic! Usually is pretty busy inside... Not super cheap but the price is reasonable and I wish they're sushi list was a little better but I can't really complain considering it's fast food :) I would recommend ! (They also have punch cards that's a nice perk as well!)"}
{"text":"California rolls are typically the most artificial sushi you could get... but not here!  It's as top-notch as any regular sushi would be! Hands down, the best California roll I've ever had. As good or better than the one I got on Santa Monica Blvd one time. Will definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"It use to be a great place to go. But that last few times have been horrible!  I will not go back and the girl behind the counter is dreadful,  she needs to go!"}
{"text":"Recently found this place and I'm now a regular. The teriyaki chicken is delicious and portions are generous. It's always clean and nicely decorated there. Plus the staff is polite and helpful. And there's a Very short wait for the food.
Arizona bowl with crab meat and avocados is also tasty.
Only con - the beef is a little dry and tough, the one time I tried it.

8/17/2015 Update: Still love this place -- coming here once or twice a week now. 
If you're not a fan of cancer-causing carcinogens, you Must ask for, \"No blacken chicken\". Otherwise, you'll get some burned pieces (of chicken).
Also, for only $2 more, you can get double meat on their large teriyaki bowls -- each of which fills me up for two or three meals."}
{"text":"Place is clean and service was good but the chicken was not prepared properly.  Every bite of chicken contained cartilage,  fat or gristle.  This has happened multiple times here.  It appears they are serving every part of the bird. I thought I would give them a chance to correct but things are the same.  We won't be returning."}
{"text":"I really enjoy the food here. I feel like it is a healthy option and my 12 year like the food here too."}
{"text":"We love love love the Arizona Bowl. It's like having a super large California Roll. We don't live near hear but we will drive for the Arizona Bowl."}
{"text":"Not sure who is really to blame, Yogis, or Postmates. I ordered 2 teriyaki chickens and a bottle of teriyaki sauce. So 3 items. So to clarify, that's 2 food containers and one bottle. 3 items. Not these big complex multi course meals. Super obvious to look in the bag and see if there are two meals or one. The delivery fee was $8.50 which is ridiculous, but I did it to avoid having to leave the house. Food shows up. And I have one teriyaki plate, and a bottle of sauce. So with tax, fees (not including a tip it was $37 for one small meal. Ultimately I had to go get something at a drive thru because it wasn't enough to feed two people. Postmates won't refund the delivery fee, so I basically I paid more in fees than the meal itself. The food is good given it's basically fast food. But the whole experience annoyed me enough not to order them again."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch with the hubbie. He works across the street from it so he's always talking about it. lol. I ordered the butter garlic noodles, ( because that just sounds amazing, lol) and added beef to it. I really liked the noodles and their portions are pretty big and it came with rice.They have a really big menu, so i'd probably come back to try some other items, however they are very Americanized. It's a cute little lunch spot though."}
{"text":"Yummy! This place was clean and the food was awesome for fast food Asian joint!
I had the Arizona bowl which was a pretty neat idea.

My husband had the beef bowl that was delicious the beef was tender and cooked really well!

I would def come
Back for more!

Oh and the portion size for the price was good too!"}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp while I was in Arizona for Dodgers' spring training. This place wasn't what I expected from the outside. Yogi's is more of a fast food sushi place where you walk up to a register to order, which wasn't a problem at all. The crunchy California roll was awesome and so was the chicken teriyaki bowl. It was a little on the pricey side for a fast food kind of place, but the food was good."}
{"text":"I hit this place for lunch a couple of time a month.  Food is standard fast food teriyaki, and gets 3 stats, but young kid who works the counter is well mannered and friendly.  That's pretty hard to find in a service worker these days.  He gets 5 starts"}
{"text":"A bit pricey for fast food japanese.  Decent Cali roll and Avocado salad."}
{"text":"Usually get the chicken teriyaki bowl, but going for the sushi this time!  Love this place!!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service, if you're looking for a quick and healthy option this is the place!"}
{"text":"I love this joint. The teriyaki chicken plate/bowl is superb. Prices are a tad high for a fast food-type format, but they deliver with HUGE portions of good food. They even have a teriyaki tap near the utensils for those of us who want to add a bit more.. cool. I've also tried & like the yakisoba noodles, and I've heard good reviews on the sushi items from friends. Good stuff, highly recommended."}
{"text":"First time at this location but the food was consistent with the same great flavor. The employees were welcoming and even brought my food to my table. The rice and chicken here is so simple but so tasty at the same time."}
{"text":"Swung in for take-out lunch and ordered the Beef Yakisoba. Got a plate of bland rice, dry, flavorless noodles, completely uncooked vegetables (maybe that's how they're supposed to be? Seems weird, though...), and tough, burnt beef strips. I was unable to tell what kind of sauce or glaze was on the beef (I would guess teriyaki) as it was so burnt the whole strip just tasted like charcoal/carbon.

I ate half of the noodles and trashed the rest. Worst $8 lunch ever."}
{"text":"I don't think I will be frequenting this place. It is kind of musty and has a weird unclean
Vibe. Sushi was ok for the price."}
{"text":"This is my mom and I's favorite place for \"fast food\" style Japanese food. But as of late my order keeps getting f**ked up. I believe it's due to the high school kids they hire for up front who simply do not give a shit. I went on Monday, ordered by phone, paid (wasn't given a total) and realized when given my receipt that it was $42.00!! What??? For two rolls and a chicken bowl?? Well I was charged for three rolls and charged $2 to make my rolls spicey which if they give you sirracha for free why would it coat $2 to add a DRIZZLE to my rolls? Anyways...back to being charged for three rolls the girl at the counter tells me that \"on the phone you specifically stated you wanted three\". Um no I didn't and I'm telling you that now, so since my food isn't done and I ordered it 20mins ago can you correct it? She looked puzzled so I just said f**k it and took it. To top off a less then enjoyable experience I asked for a water cup while I was waiting, since my food wasn't done 20mins later, which she provided me and I got sparkling water from the machine ( no regular water button) which she then proceeded to tell me wasn't free. Excuse me bitch? I just paid for something I didn't order/ nor want so shut the f**k up.   
Never the less she shut up and I had a second cup. The owner is nice but needs to hire someone who gives a little more f**ks."}
{"text":"Ok so let me begin by explaining this review is based on the \"Spicy Tuna Roll\" only. I've ordered dozens of Spicy Tuna Rolls at many sushi bars and even Fry's Marketplace. I can honestly say the Spicy Tuna Roll from Yogi's was a major disappointment. The inside comes with spicy tuna and cucumber, however the portion of cucumber strips was 80% of the inside of this roll. Just a tiny little strip of spicy tuna was inside. Very disappointing and almost to the point where I wanted my $8.61 refunded. I regret not taking a picture to show you just how bad this roll was. They should change the name to Cucumber Roll w/ Tiny Spicy Tuna and lower the price to $3.00. However, this place was very clean and neat with fast service..... Might have been fast due to only one other person eating."}
{"text":"I wouldn't say that Yogi's has the best sushi around, but it's just right for price and convenience. I have noticed that the Yogi's Roll tastes different depending on the location. It was much spicier at this location than others.  I subtracted 1 Star for the fact that they ran out of white rice. How does that happen?  I was tempted to cancel my order, but substituted brown rice instead.  They were going to give me a free drink for the inconvenience, but I already paid for one.  Overall, the staff was polite and the place was clean. I don't know how often they run out of white rice, as this was my first time at this location. Hopefully it's not a common occurrence."}
{"text":"Usually my go to place for terryaki, last night was a let down with unusually dry beef and no dressing on my salad. If the quality would have been better, like usual, would definitely be 5 stars!"}
{"text":"The best teriyaki bowl I've ever had! It was reasonably priced and a perfect place for a meal before the movie. I really loved the sushi too. It was especially awesome for the kids because the food came out fast and we were able to finish before the kids got too antsy. We will definitely be returning again soon!"}
{"text":"This place keeps their epoxy floors wet from the soda machine. I fell twice. They need a f*ckin carpet there to protect people from falling these stupid assholes. Tables are ALWAYS DIRTY. And the boy upfront at the register complains when it's busy"}
{"text":"Not impressed. Bland and basic overpriced rice and meat slathered in teriyaki sauce. I don't understand why people flock here a lunchtime."}
{"text":"You get simply \"bleh\" teriyaki chicken on top of rice for over $7. No veggies, spices or anything else. The rice was under cooked and I got a few suprise crunchy bites of rice.

This place needs to get real and lower the prices of their cheap bowls or increase the quality."}
{"text":"Waste of money.

Picked up some sushi to take home.
It's abnormally large and impossible to pick up and eat.

Had a shitty ass day just wanted to get some good food.
Spent $33 for a mess that tastes like disappointment."}
{"text":"Very disappointing and I wasn't expecting much from a place called Yogis. \"Heeeyy Boo-boo, don't eat at Yogis grill.\" - Best Yogi bear impression ever."}
{"text":"Visor service seems to be improving.  Food is starting to be prepared in the same fashion"}
{"text":"After several more visits, I'll upgrade them back to 3 stars. They've been consistent and the food is always solid."}
{"text":"I've been in a couple of times before and it's not been bad for being a quick counter service place, but today was not the best. The food was ok (although my egg rolls and fried roll were cold, you'll see why) but the service was definitely enough to make me not return. I don't know if it's new management or ownership since the last few times I've been there, but the man who was clearly in charge today had an attitude. He had a (I'll be nice and call it a) rather loud discussion with an employee about whether or not another employee had \"stolen\" centered around what employees could and couldn't have for their discounted food. He then argued with another customer who came in after me to pick up an order he had called in. The customer was super chill about it but I'm pretty sure he didn't really get his extra beef because of how the owner kept trying to tell him what he really ordered and how (\"That's why I asked you three times when you called...\"). And because of that situation and having three other sets of customers come in behind me, my order sat waiting to be packaged and handed to me (hence my cold egg rolls and fried roll). I don't blame the girl who was running the counter BY HERSELF because the guy in charge was standing around doing nothing and when he noticed me looking at him doing nothing he went to stand over one of the cook's shoulders as if they weren't doing their job right. Needless to say, unless I see a sign that says new management or ownership, I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Was in Litchfield Park for a conference and found this gem of a restaurant after stopping by Walgreens across the street. Definitely good value for the money and fast service too. I tried the spicy tuna bowl and a side of a cucumber roll. Way better than any other fast food restaurant food.  I only wish they would come to LA (along with Culvers)"}
{"text":"I stopped by for a quick lunch. I got the spicy California roll and the Philadelphia roll. I didn't realize that they were going to be huge! You really only need one roll or get half-rolls if you want more than one kind of sushi.

The employees were friendly. The dining area was clean. Service was speedy."}
{"text":"The quality of the food at this location has been consistently good. The tofu and vegetables taste fresh allowing you to appreciate the delicate taste."}
{"text":"Ordered, semi busy, been a half hour and still haven recipe, received wrong order. Avoid"}
{"text":"Taste wise it's not horrible but for 12 dollars I ended up with 2 cups of rice and maybe a quarter lb of chicken. 

The staff is nice and pretty attentive for a fast food place but it's still just too expensive for what you actually get."}
{"text":"We chose to eat it and I'm glad we did. When our food came out it was lukewarm at best. I was watching the chef touch all the food ungloved. He went in and out of the freezer a lot; sometimes with food in his bare hands. As we were leaving this same Chef stuck his bare hand into a bowl of cooled rice. It was stomach turning. I did not finish my meal and I won't be back."}
{"text":"I live at yogis... every single time I have been to all the other locations it has been perfection... this location is the slowest moving out of all of them. Waiting 35 minutes for 1 chicken bowl. Female cashier just disregarded me when I asked for an update."}
{"text":"We used to like this place, ordered take out twice a month or more.
Seems like ingredient quality is slipping. Teriyaki beef is so gristly and chewy it's a disgrace. Salads not as good as they were.
Still like the crunch roll,  but they are rather pricy.
Getting harder and harder to find top quality food in this affluent part of Chandler."}
{"text":"Can't find a decent Teriyaki Bowl anywhere.  Today was my first an LAST time to eat here (take out).  I spent $8.00 each for a large Chickin Veggie Teriyaki Bowl and one with Beef.  Just a Chicken Teriyaki Bowl has rice, chicken and sauce. No Vegetables.  The chicken was old and tough, the vegetables were uncooked, and the rice was dry and sorry on both dishes.  The beef was also dry and tough.  Can you say, \"screwing Americans again\"?  Stick we Panda Express, but I do wish they something other than onions in their noodles."}
{"text":"The best teriyaki chicken in fast casual setting. Service is always fast and friendly. A once a week spot for me."}
{"text":"Don't go unless you have TIME to wait for your food or are not thaaat hungry. Cashier told me 15 min for my order of 2 California rolls. Waited an hour. Asked for an update and same cashier said one order was ahead of me. Waited 10 more minutes, asked for another update, different cashier said I was 4 orders behind. There was another gentleman who had ordered before me and his order hadn't even been started yet. There was a woman who was there long before I had arrived and she told me she'd been waiting for hours. Keep in mind there was uber eats drivers coming in left and right to pick up orders, and other people getting their orders. Salads came out before sushi. If you order sushi be ready to wait hours or be lied to about how long the wait really is.  Never going back. You suck yogis!!! You're a liar. Ok I feel better now. Thanks yelp for hearing me out. You've been warned yelp user...(if you're wondering I got my money back and went across the street to Tokyo Joes...sooo much better!!)"}
{"text":"WAY OVERPRICED!!!  This is a great place for first timers but i doubt they will be getting frequent customers returning.  Their menu is just too expensive."}
{"text":"I'd agree with this place just being average. I hadn't had sushi in a while and their rolls looked decent enough. Just needed to pick up to-go but at 12:30 this place was packed. Waited 15min for two rolls that I underestimated for size. However, I quickly realized they were packed with rice which explained how big they were. Overall the rolls were okay because they were expensive and nothing stood out or had me saying \"yum\". The dragon roll's avocado was very mushy, and the eel seemed to only be on every other piece, if that, and started to look questionable the further I got so I didn't finish it. This place is decent, staff were friendly but did forget a request, I'd probably get something other than sushi though... but just off the first experience I'd be fine if I never got a chance to try this place again."}
{"text":"Not sure why so many bad reviews - Wednesday afternoon at 347pm and the lady taking my order was very positive and cheerful ordered a 1/2 of a California roll which was 2/3 of a roll and wonderful teriyaki chicken bowl was plentiful a bit dry and not a killer teriyaki but better than average and the portion was large a bit hard to believe the staple dish is dry the chicken is dry I'd say a 3.5 average and 14 dollars for lunch with a drink but it's a meal and a half problem is there are too many other places close by that are well above average won't be back"}
{"text":"Best teriyaki chicken combo in the valley! Try it out you won't be disappointed. The chicken to rice ratio is great most teriyaki chicken bowl places give you way too much rice for the amount of chicken you get which is annoying because who wants to eat a huge bowl of plain white rice. The Vegas rolls are delicious and even better when you dip it into their teriyaki sauce."}
{"text":"Twice now I've order through Eat24 and both times my order has been altered. My receipts have different, less expensive items on them, yet I'm charged the amount indicated through Yelp. I don't know where the wires are getting crossed, but it's ticking me off. I ordered the Beef Teriyaki Plate for $13.59; I received the regular beef bowl salad at $8.78. The calamari was there, though. The last time this happened, I chalked it up to a fat thumb error on my part. Nope. As convenient as Yogis is for lunch, I can't keep returning when stuff like this happens."}
{"text":"It was just \"OK\". In a strip mall. I think it caters to the younger, movie-going crowd. The food was bland. I had to wait over 10 minutes for salmon teryaki. I did not like the fact everything was served in styrofoam everything.  I will not go back."}
{"text":"Very good food served quickly.  Add a little hot sauce and some soy sauce, mix it together.  Eat.

Price is low and quality is high.  You really can't ask more than that."}
{"text":"Had a ghetto handwritten sign on the door saying they closed at 8pm on Sunday. Sign taped to register \"To Go ONLY\" It was 7:30pm and all the chairs were on top of the tables and all sauces put away. Awful customer service."}
{"text":"LOVE this place!! Stopped by this small hidden gem. Had the lunch special. A large spicy teriyaki bowl and it reminded me of home. It's a clean establishment and has a friendly staff. I was surprised it was busy for a Monday lunch because it was hidden away. I was also surprised how quick they were able to get me my food. Great portions and amazing flavor. Had an upgraded mom and pop shop feel to it. I love these types of hidden places that you always are searching for."}
{"text":"Food was good stuff is friendly little on the expensive side for three of us."}
{"text":"The attitudes of the employees has improved exponentially the last few times I've been here. I'm not sure if there was something said or if the employees found a change of heart, but I don't loathe coming to this location now which is nice! The food is always amazing, and now that the employees are friendlier I find myself coming here a little more often."}
{"text":"The chicken and beef bowl is excellent, gets a tad crowded during lunch but great otherwise."}
{"text":"Short Review: It can be a bit slow even on week days or uncrowded dine/take-out. If so, I recommend not coming here if you want an under 5 minute wait lunch/dinner. The way the food entree is organized when ordering take-out can be baffling. Sometimes, it is nicely done, sometimes it is messy. Overall, it's quite a nice chain restaurant with decent food and service.

Long Review: Because I live around the city of Avondale, it can be a bit difficult to find a \"good\" Asian food close by, especially Japanese food. I do understand that Yogis Grill is not a real Japanese restaurant and is, more or less, an American-Japanese inspired restaurant. But more importantly, I am a big fan of sushi and poke bowls. Unfortunately, Yogis Grill does not have poke bowl yet, but they do have Spicy Tuna Bowl which is pretty much a simplified version of poke bowl. And they do have a decent list of sushi that I'd like eating. So far, I have ate Spicy Tuna Bowl, (Spicy) California Roll, Crunch Roll, and Spicy Tuna Roll. As you can see, I do like spicy food and they did a wonderful job for the flavor and taste. Obviously, it ain't no real sushi from Japan, but hey, some times you just have to substitute and compromise something in order to get partially your way. What's more important is it wasn't expensive. As far as it goes, the food is good and the service seems okay to me. The only problem I have with this place is the waiting. I'm not sure why it took more than 10 minutes to make a Spicy Tuna Bowl and a California Roll. There was no line, I was about the first person to order. The thing about chain restaurant is they should have already prep the ingredients and pre-made most food already. All they had to do is stack the food up and neatly arrange them as how they would do. This is also another issue about this Yogis Grill is that when they make their sushi, it can be messy and some pieces are cut bigger than the other. It isn't evenly done sometimes. The first time I went to Yogis Grill, I got the Spicy Tuna Bowl and they only added 5 - 6 chunks of avocado, which wasn't terrible, but the arrangement wasn't organized. However, another time that I went to get a Spicy Tuna Bowl, for some odd reason, I have a nicely stacked and arranged smaller slices of  12 avocados. It's quite baffling. The taste does feel consistent, but the arrangement of the food can be odd at times. Overall, I would eat here time through time because it is a good place to eat. I'm still waiting for their poke bowl to come out though."}
