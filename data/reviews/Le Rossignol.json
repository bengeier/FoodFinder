{"text":"Le Rossignol is a small and intimate bistro newly opened in Leslieville (taking over Pop Bistro's space). And on a cold wintry night, there's nothing more satisfying than classic French cuisine to fuel and fortify a body against the chill.

Or if you're me, be a glutton and not be able to focus on anything else but a couch on which to play beached-whale during the entire trip home. I tried to solo this meal and perhaps that was not a good call. But I digress! Let's talk about the food.

After I settle in at my table, an amuse comes out from the kitchen - a butternut soup with coconut foam. The scent of five-spice wafts up from the hot ceramic shot-glass and it is a delicious way to warm up. Quite nice.

A hot bowl of French onion soup is up next - not too salty, really nice flavour, and islands of floating toasted crisps tangled in a mess of melted cheese. It's a hefty portion of soup, good for sharing. Of course, I ate it all by myself.

The kitchen clearly thought I didn't have enough to eat this evening (I had two - yes two - mains still yet to come), so a small quenelle of a duck terrine on a crisp gets placed in front of me. Meaty and a little vinegary, this mouthful was a nice way to perk up the taste buds again. A nice and unexpected treat.

I couldn't resist and got the house-made pasta of the night: Linguine with pulled boar, mushrooms, and laced with truffle oil. There was mention of tomatoes, but it was a fairly light note. Rich and delicious, this was a deceptively large portion of pasta due to the plate being more bowl-like than you'd think. Very filling and worth a try if they still have it on the menu.

By now I was pretty full. And what's next? Cassoulet. It landed on the table and this plate of beans, half a sausage, and two confit duck legs mocked me. The peanut gallery of lardons laughed. I tried valiantly, but I got through half a leg, a slice of sausage, and a few spoonfuls of beans before I called it quits.

The waitress enquires if I want dessert? I'm stuffed, but of course!

I opted for a pot de cr√®me trio (it's small, right?) in mango, berry, and apple (in order of preference). The mango was light and delicious and not as mangoey as it could have been. Better that way, I think. The berry (cassis, I think), in contrast, was quite strong and worked well. The texture was a bit off though. I'd have opted to pass on the apple in the end.

A pot of loose-leaf tea (earl grey. hot.), strong and black, accompanied dessert in an effort to make more room in my stomach. It did its job, though I still felt like I was going to explode.

All in all, a promising new neighbourhood place I'd return to sometime (can't think about when right now - too full). Added bonus is the fact that real French gets bandied about between the FOH and kitchens. Adds that extra je ne sais quois to the evening.

{"text":"Food is mixed ... Elk is delicious, cassoulet is very hearty, French onion soup is pretty good, beet salad is fresh.  Service has a bit of a take it or leave it attitude - didn't like our request to decant our wine. Cozy room - meaning not a lot of room between table - but comfortable chairs. Bathrooms are rustic and excessively bright.  With attention this will become a very good neighborhood restaurant."}

{"text":"Absolutely loved it! Food quality was superb with all the vegetables seasoned and cooked to perfection. I will surely be back!"}
{"text":"(note: I posted this review prior to realizing that as of earlier this week, they've moved down the street with their sister restaurant, Le Canard Mort. Hopefully the intimate atmosphere of the old place remains!)

I almost hate to write a review of this place, because I don't want anyone to know about it and thus be able to keep this wonderfully intimate French restaurant all to myself and my husband. Every time we come here, it's not very crowded and we're free to make goo-goo eyes at each other over dinner without making anyone want to toss their moules frites. But, this place is too sweet not to share, so consider yourselves warned if you spot us in a corner, canoodling over crevettes. ;) 

Standouts here include the escargot poutine (yes, you read that right!) and the coq au vin. Both items are rich, hearty, and perfect stick-to-your-ribs comfort food. I also really like the duck breast with cassoulet, which is another hearty choice. The filet and frites are also good, but nothing special. 

The wine list is decent; on the small side, but well-curated. The server, a lovely Montreal woman, sets the atmosphere with her lovely French accent and welcoming (if slightly frazzled) attitude. Food comes out reasonably quickly, and I've already blathered on about the romantic, intimate atmosphere. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Arrived for our reservation promptly and were immediately seated. The waitress gave us a complimentary glass of champagne while we perused the menu. Ordered the frisee, pate, cassoulet and roast boar chop. While we waited, the waitress placed an amuse bouche of shrimp dressed w/ a cream sauce 

Frisee salad w/ lardons and poached egg: nice and yolky, an excellent salad.

Pate main served w/ toast and jam. Meaty w/o being salty and the jam added a sweet note. Lovely.

Cassoulet: It was -5C out so this dish really hit the spot. Two confit duck legs, rosemary herbed sausage and white beans slow cooked until al dente and flavorful. The duck legs might've been a little chewier than usual, but still a good, hearty, filling dish.

Roast wild boar chop: Cooked medium w/ an excellent, slightly sweet glaze, mashed potatoes, baby carrots and crunchy broccolini. The flavors and textures were wonderful, an excellent dish.

Chocolate cake: deep, chocolatey flavor, with just enough sweetness to allow you to enjoy the chocolatey taste w/o being sugary, sickly sweet.

Pear poached in wine and honey, served w/ vanilla creme in phyllo. Man, this dessert was amazing. I'll definitely get this again.

It's not haute cuisine, but it is a French restaurant and service is appropriate and friendly.

Five stars w/ one star off for the overly confited duck. We'll definitely hit this place as the seasons change and different things come into season like ramps and fiddleheads."}
