{"text":"Just ordered a catering order today. They arrived early, with all my food correct. Everyone enjoyed their pizza and wings! We had an assortment of different pizzas, all tasted fresh and great ! We will be ordering their catering again in the future. Thanks for the great food!"}
{"text":"Best pizza chain around this area. Thin and thick crust are both good. Great sauce and pepperoni."}
{"text":"Donatos is serviceable pizza for what its worth. My issue is when it takes longer than 2 hours to deliver, especially when the answer I received on the phone is \"uh, we are running behind.\""}
{"text":"Got carry out today, large pepperoni,boneless wings, big don sub and potato wedges. 
boneless wings are great, best ones I've had in along time. wedges were okay.
Pizza was on the greasy side, and I asked for well done, it wasn't. 
The cashier was friendly. 
The place is very clean."}
{"text":"We have seriously gotten food poisoning the past 3 times we have been here. So sad, this was always a reliable, decent place."}
{"text":"Great pizza, terrible service. We've been here twice. The first time we ate in. We were the only people in the place but service couldn't have been slower.

Ah...but it could be slower. Just walk in and try to place a to-go order. We were told at least four times that, \"We'll be right with you.\"

They weren't.

Again, the pizza is worth the hassle, but the staff is kind of pathetic."}
{"text":"The food is ok. Much better than Hungry howie's or Dominos. I ordered salad and breadsticks.
However, customer service is NONexistent. You go up to the counter, not even a hello from the employee. Most of them were like that. They just hand you your food. And when you say thank you, they don't even say anything.  Horrible Customer service. They all have blank stares and are miserable here!!"}
{"text":"Personal sized pizza was the perfect size. The salad was GREAT! Delivery was on time and polite!!"}
{"text":"The worst, rudest customer service ever. Came in to pick up my order at the designated time and they hadn't even started it yet. Didn't care at all!  Said they were too busy because it was a football Saturday.  Very rude.  Ended up going to Antonio's instead...I recommend you do the same. I will still go to other Donatos but not the one in Solon."}
{"text":"This was the best Pizza I've had in a long time!  I love how they cut it!

It makes it easier to eat and it makes it feel like your pizza goes along way, because you have like 30 little pieces instead of 8- pieces.

Would recommend anyone who has never tried Donatos to do so, and also their breadstix are amazing!"}
{"text":"Eh.....Donatos? Who owns this place McDonald? I think so....Awesome pizza especially the chicken mariachi except when you do a $30 carryout and the staff forgets the sides of sour-cream that helps make this pizza. Sorry team pay a little more attention and I would of given a better rating. The girl at the front was nice and efficient. I will be back one day when I can not handle any other corporate pizza place. If you want awesome pizza in Lakewood check out Angelo's and also Dewey's."}
{"text":"We had a terrible dine-in experience here. my husband and I and our two kids had made the mistake of trying to find somewhere decent to eat on a Friday night in Solon without having a long wait. We ended up at Donato's. While it was nice and un-crowded, there was one waitress working all the tables (only a couple tables were occupied though). She was friendly, but it took forever to even place our drink orders. Then it took even longer to get our food, which was disappointing in terms of portions. Also, my son was supposed to get fries with his wings and did not get them. 
Then it took forever to get our check- the waitress never checked to see if everything was OK, and never asked if we wanted dessert etc. 
There is a larger plaque on the wall that says \"Our promise: to give you the best pizza and make your day better\". What a bunch of corporate crap!!!!
P.S. Normally I only review places where I had a good experience, but I just couldn't help myself here!!"}
{"text":"The pizza took a bit of time to come but was excellent. I love their signature of putting toppings all the way to the crust"}
{"text":"Donatos is one of the best pizza chains out there. Pizza chains I feel usually deliver subpar pizza compared to the locally owned restaurants. Donatos does a good job though. We had the Margharita pizza w/ thick crust. It was very good, but could have used a little more seasoning. They're other pizzas are pretty good too. At the Hudson location, they're dining area is somewhat futuristic with phones replacing waiters. Take out is best though. Overall, if you're looking for a good pizza and you want to eat in, try Donatos."}
{"text":"Horrible service. I \"placed\" a delivery order--or so I thought-- and was told it would be \"5 minutes\"...I should've known right then that were going to be problems. I called back about an hour later to check on my \"order\", which was nowhere to be found in their system. I then had to solve the problem on my own by telling the manager exactly what she could do to rectify the problem (aka put the order in right away with a rush on it...??). I feel like if I wouldn't have specifically pointed out that I'd like the order to be rushed then it would've been another hour or so of waiting--who knows...

After about two hours from the time I placed my original order, our food showed up. It was the thinnest, dinkiest, most tasteless pizza I've ever had. 

The Donatos back where I'm from is always spot on and tastes great. Something is off with this specific location."}
{"text":"I've never ordered at a Pizza place on a Thursday and taken 2 hours to get here. Never again will I ever order from here or eat at a Donatos. I ordered at 6:06 pm and its 7:47pm and still not here. RIDICULOUS!"}
{"text":"This place blows. My order is always wrong and I'm consistently waiting way beyond my quoted wait time. I drove all the way home tonight to have the wrong order. They don't want to bring me my child's food that they messed up because I'm outside of their delivery area. The worst!!!!!! Straw that broke the camel's back. I am never going back here."}
{"text":"My first Donato's experience was at the Bobcats game and it was fine...but tonight, my husband and I needed a quick fast dinner to go with the big bag of Costco lettuce I bought...so we picked up two larger 3 topping pizzas, on special for $20. 

Gotta say, the thin crust, toppings all the way to the border, really hit the spot with our bagged salad kit.  Quick, easy dinner, fast service.  We called to place our order, and 14 minutes later, our order was ready. 

The 4 stars, not 5 are because I'd like to see more topping options...maybe a BBQ pizza option...and the Margarita pizza is drizzled with \"oil\" not olive oil, so I translated that into \"greasy\"."}
{"text":"Had consistent problems with getting marinara sauce (that we paid for) with the garlic bread. Additionally, I placed an order online at 7pm, was told order will be ready by 8:01. Called at 8:15 and was told it will be another 45 minutes. Had I known the delays, different arrangements could be made. All I got was a sorry, nothing we can do. Poor job of managing customer expectations


Update: just tried to order the very next day. Pizza came on time, but wow, the condition of the pizza was unacceptable. It was all scrunched up, will try and post a picture 

Update again! We ordered for the LAST time. Ordered pepperoni and got cheese. Called to get the issue fixed and they said they would send out another pizza but we have to wait and give back the cheese. Usually a situation like this offers a \"sorry\" and some type of compensation. The fact they messed up, planned on sending an order late, and wanted the pizza back is just ridiculous. After I admittedly got upset, the manager hung up on me. I called back and canceled the entire order. DO NOT ORDER from this place."}
{"text":"Worst donatos ever. Ordered a veggie pizza and the dough wasn't even cook. I love donatos pizza but this location is not the best."}
{"text":"Born in Columbus, OH I was so happy to see there's a Donatos in Charlotte! The store here is in a strange shopping center type thing that seems to be empty the two times I've been, but the pizza has been delicious!! I grabbed a salad last time and it was phenomenal. My favorite thin crust pizza anywhere! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I have always enjoyed and supported Donatos but my last experience completely turned me off. I was so hungry tonight that I decided to pick up instead of wait for delivery. I drove there and back, got home, only to realize that I was given the wrong pizza. I called the store to tell them and the guy on the phone (Sean or Sam) was very nice. He said that the manager would just give me a credit next time I called.....I just wanted my pizza. They ended up delivery a pizza an hour later.....cold, prolly the same pizza I had ordered 2 hours before. With most the donatos in the area closing, it won't be long before this one does with this female manager. Calling corporate in the morning."}
{"text":"I've been going here off & on since it opened. I like it & then I don't, I go back and forth. I've always gotten the Big Don Italian sub with sausage. It just ain't worth the money, I didn't mind the little amount of lunch meat on it cause the big sausage patty made up for that. Well they switched to pizza pieces of sausage. What a rip off. I like their wings - get extra baked & the pizza the same as always. Steer well clear of the Big Don lunch meat subs. A terrible deal for all!!!!"}
{"text":"Their Pizza looked and tasted like a Save-A-Lot Pizza can you microwave. Absolutely no taste and very cheap Pepperoni's the kind of shrivel up when you cook them. A Cheesy breadsticks taste like biscuits from a can with some cheese on the top. The only good thing is my pizza came here within 20 minutes from me calling them and they're less than a quarter mile from my house and makes me truly believe that wasn't microwave Pizza. I was just trying something new and got a very big disappointment. I was told it was supposed to be garlic cheesy bread no garlic whatsoever. No wonder every time I drive past the place I never see any cars in the parking lot it means they have bad Pizza."}
{"text":"Do not expect your pizza to be ready in the time given.

This makes it hard to plan around if you have a busy night planned.

I called in a pizza for pickup on a Thursday evening. They said it would be ready in 15min. I got there in 15 min. At the drive through pickup. And they said okay it will be just 2 more minutes. 7minutes later they said please pull around it will be just 2 or 3 more minutes. Another another 8 minutes for by which puts it at 30 minutes after I placed my order and twice as long as they said after it would be ready and they come out to my car and tell me it will be another 5 to 6 minutes. ..

They could have just told me it will be 35minutes and I could have planned around that with no problem. But don't cut the actual time in half and waste my time sitting around waiting by lying to me with it being \"just 2 more minutes\" every 5 minutes. 

Quality of service is more important than taste however they do have a good tasting pizza. Just disappointed with this experience."}
{"text":"This is some good stuff!! Pizza is good meatball sub is amazing and apple vinaigrette is the best!!! Wings could be crispier.. But everything else is soooo good! And they deliver!"}
{"text":"Waited forever for someone to take our order.  Then another lady comes in and the manager Stephanie was so rude to her.  My family and I were embarrassed. I can't believe she is the manager and treats people like that! What a shame!!"}
{"text":"On 4/27/18 my family and I came to this facility for some good old fashioned deliciously famous Pizza. Upon arrival we were not greeted at the door by anyone and  when finally approached by a worker he motioned for us to come to the register to take our order for dine in. After waiting what seemed to be 20 mins for someone to assist us another customer arrived with a take out order and a few simple questions about possible discounts and rudely in front of earshot of my family told this woman she needed to go online and order to obtain her discount. The manor in which this Manager Stephanie Sohl treated this customer will forever leave a bad impression on my family's dining experience. Even if this customer wasn't eligible for any discounts you would think or expect to be treated as though you are a paying customer? In short, I am a visitor from another state that doesn't have a Donatos Pizza in my area and when asked where I wanted to go, I said Donatos! Wish I had said McDonalds. It saddens me to know there are folks out there who don't appreciate the opportunity to make the best of their career choices as that's what happens when you get a job, you made that choice. I would kindly ask for this Manager herself to respond to me with a reason why she hates her job and what she will do in the future to creat a dinning experience for everyone to enjoy. I know the CEO of Donatos would be completely embarrassed by this and will forward another email to her with my information to have a resolution to this managers issues. Thank you for letting me leave with a bad taste in my mouth and mind!"}
{"text":"Excellent pizza. Their thin crust changes the meaning of thin crust pizza. The sauce is great, service is quick. I've eaten here dozens of times and rarely had a negative experience."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with this visit to Donato's. I hadn't been here in quite a long time. They changed their pizza dough and their sauce. I ordered the classic trio on thin crust. 

It was garbage. It reminded me of the pizza you'd order at the school cafeteria. They should be ashamed to charge almost 17 bucks for a large."}
{"text":"Fantastic thin crust pizza. Also have subs, wings, salads, etc... delivery is fast and hot. Dining room has a nice atmosphere and good service. If you have kids bring them on Wednesdays, they can eat free and there is a guy who does balloon animals and magic tricks."}
{"text":"I saw negative reviews and I dont get it. Place is clean, fast, and everybody is courteous. We drive a good 20 minutes for Donatos because the ones in Royalton and Brunswick closed years ago and Parma is much closer than Columbus. I can tell you from my experiences Donatos pizza and Big Don subs are terrific."}
{"text":"Had a horrible experience last night (2/27/18). Placed an online order that was $53. Had an on-line offer for 30% off. Used that. Went in to pay and had a $10 bonus gift card (this was for the Christmas promotion of receiving $10 off with $50 worth of gift cards purchased). The clerk was lost on how to process this and had to go to the manager in the back twice. Manager finally came out, hit a few icons and went to the back of house - never looked at me, acknowledged me, etc. Clerk said the total is $43 now. No, I said I submitted the 30% on-line offer. She said certainly, your new total is $38. I said no ... that would be $28 - the 30% off and I'm using this $10 bonus card. She informed me that I cannot use the card. I'm only allowed to use one discount.

This is the where the problem is. I pointed out this card was received for buying $50 in gift cards this past Christmas and you were told you would receive an additional $10 - which is this card. No where on this card does it say this is a coupon. It does NOT say anything about being combined with other offers, etc. Per the card, \"Valid at participating location - thru 2/28/18. One time use only. Present card upon payment. Change not given. No cash value. Food/Beverage only.\" \"Present this card for $10 off any purchase of $10 or more.\" That's it. Indicates NOTHING else. There are NO other restrictions.

Obviously I was at a stalemate with the clerk. I told her this conclusion is unacceptable as the card does NOT indicate this is a coupon. I ended up leaving WITHOUT the products ordered. Note: This young clerk did not attempt to involve the manager or anything. Clearly indicated she cannot enter it in the register and that's it.  

I just called customer service at the corporate office and they informed me that it $10 card is a coupon and cannot be used with any other offer.

I went through my legality speal to no avail.

Customer lost for life! Nor will I be spending money on their gift cards this Christmas. In addition, our business orders about 15 pizzas from them every month end for the nightly inventory.  Guess that business will go away also.

But they successfully saved the $10. Even though, in my meager opinion, this is NOT disclosed anywhere to the consumer."}
{"text":"Just moved into the neighborhood and this was our second pizza in a few days as we unpack boxes. This may have have been the first Donatos pizza in awhile but I must say I was impressed. They have recently moved to a new location in the Van Aken Mall and we ordered the first batch for the moving van guys. It was mostly pepperoni and cheese but very tasty with the thin crust. Tonight we ordered a large with half tomato and onions and the other half Serious Meat. While picking it up I noticed they had seasoning shakers near the soda fountain so I added Roasted Garlic and Smoked Chipotle, nice additions. Both times the pizzas were ready for pickup at the time stated. We will definitely be retuning here with their friendly staff and great offerings."}
{"text":"Donatos is my favorite chain pizza in Charlotte (or anywhere for that matter).  (For individual pizza restaurants, Hawthorne's beats them all.)  Donatos COVER their pizzas with toppings and come up with some unique combinations to entertain diners.  Last time, we had the Founder's Favorite which includes pepperoni, sausage, ham, and -- my favorite -- hot peppers.  YUM!  Spice it up, baby!   Can't wait to try one of the mariachi ones next time.  Ole!   For the kids, we got the Hawaiian pizza which was unique in that it also carried almonds and cinnamon in addition to the regular ham and pineapple.  Hmm.  Interesting.  And inventive.    

They may be a little more expensive than the normal chains like Papa John's, Pizza Hut, or Domino's, but they are SO worth it.  And with more locations popping up around Charlotte, you're bound to find one in your area that delivers or you can swing by on the way home for pick-up."}
{"text":"We went here for dinner Friday Night an hour before closing.. we enter and tell the girl at the counter we wanted to look at a menu cause we haven't been here before.  We proceed to sit at a table with menus to discuss the options.  The lady proceeded to hover over us and we informed her that we needed a few minutes.  She said that's fine then continued to hover in our personal space.  So flustered and pissed off we just hurried and told her what we wanted.. she went back to the kitchen and we filled our drinks.... at which point while sitting there for another 5 minutes she informs us we have to come up to the counter to pay and we should have ordered there too cause she shouldn't have to come to the table to take our order!!!! WE DIDN'T WANT HER AT OUR TABLE WE WANTED TO BREATH AND ENJOY OUR EXPERIENCE!!  We only ordered from the table cause she was breathing down our throats!  So it turns out she never even placed the order.. if it had been up to me i would have walked out right then... but my husband felt that since we had drinks already to go ahead and place the order we already placed while she hovered over us forcing us to order right then then accuse us of making the assumption that she was supposed to do that when she wasnt... at this point i'm like WTH is this girl unhinged!!  How does she work here and continue to work here????  Finally she leaves us alone and goes in the kitchen... but when the pizzas are brought out... they are burnt i mean to a crisp black burnt pizza... my 7 year olds personal pizza was un-edible!  And same with ours but we forced a little down... it was a horrid experience and WE wont be going back!"}
{"text":"We were happy to find a Donato's when so many near us had closed.  Used to be our favorite pizza.  After tonight's experience, we'll go elsewhere.  The pizza is bland and tasteless, nowhere near the flavor they used to have.  I had to doctor it with red pepper and parmesan to give it some flavor.  The salads were a mess and mostly iceberg lettuce.  And the service was slow and unprofessional. They brought out the salads after the pizza was half gone and we had to listen to the kitchen staff argue about who was going to bring the food out.  Very disappointing."}
{"text":"First timers!! I ordered for pick up a large pepperoni, cheese and a meat lovers pizza on thick crust and two meatball subs on wheat bread. The teenagers said this was the best meatball subs they've ever had! Everyone agreed EVEN the picky eaters that the pizzas were so delicious! Definitely a five star pizza, we need to stay in Ohio just for this."}
{"text":"Went there last night.  My kids wanted to sit far away from the parents!  At their own table!  We were one of the few in there, because of the snow storm.  Cute litle waitress.  Good personality.  Pizza is pizza."}
{"text":"Good pizza, but not near worth the price.  3 medium signature pizza's delivered was over $50.  They cut it different.  THin crust was the best."}
{"text":"I have mobile ordered several times from this location. Tonight was the worst experience. I mobile ordered and was sent an email to confirm pick up at 549.  I received my pizza at 633p.  

The issue I have were. They had me pay when I came up at 553 to get.  I was offered a beverage while I waited but I just asked for the one I ordered.  No consistent person at carry out counter. So unsure if pizza was just sitting back there.   Witnessed one customer Susan who left after getting her money back   Katelyn the main clerk was very nice and never lost her cool.  The manager who would go out on deliveries told me it would be about three more minutes at 615.  

Advice just be honest with customers realize that it was a Friday night and first football games for many and you were understaffed or more likely overwhelmed 

Food was still good as Always. But the price i paid for getting two pizzas 40 minutes after they were promised is what is leaving a bad taste in mouth."}
{"text":"OK Pizza, Fast Service, Would like the decor to be more inviting.  Always busy, but never have to wait for a table."}
{"text":"Pizza was fine. Sandwich was not worth ordering. Cheese bread tasted like cheese bread. All in all, pretty cheap with a decent delivery radius, so, you know....when in Hudson and needing delivery..."}
{"text":"I gave this a one star because it's a pet peeve of mine, but I hate it when a pizza place requires you to let them know you're using a coupon when you place your order and then they short you on the toppings you order. I absolutely hate when a restaurant does this and treats you like you're not going to know the difference."}
{"text":"Refuses to delivery to an area that is 1.4 miles from its location. Westpark to be exact. 

Riddle me that..."}
{"text":"Service was very slow. Two small pizzas, dining in. First one took one forever. Second one took two forevers. Had to appeal to the manager for a discount since no one else seemed to care. Pizza itself was good so +2 stars for that."}
{"text":"Terrible service - messed up my order (short 1 pizza) - had to wait for it plus they charged me - on top of it another employee tried to give me another pizza order that was not mine. Need operations management!"}
{"text":"This was my first time trying Donatos. Yelp had them rated #1 in my area. I ordered the all meat large pizza and cheese baked bread. I enjoyed it immensely. I have extra left. I will be ordering from them or going in person next time. Thank you Donatos and yelp."}
{"text":"Don't order from here it's a waste of your time. I ordered online. It told me it would be here in 30 minutes. That was it a lie it took over 1 hour to get here and I'm two blocks away. Pizza was cold. I took one of their surveys telling them to contact me. They never did.  Get Guys pizza. Sooooo much better!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this pizza soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo much. Only Hawaiian pizza I will eat"}
{"text":"I ordered the Margherita pizza and chicken bacon pecan salad.  It was pretty good.  Only thing was that my pizza was a little more burnt  on one side (but I understand this could be due to the small size).  I prefer my pizza on the lighter side.  Also the driver was nice and friendly.  Overall great experience."}
{"text":"wish i could give 0 STARS.  Ordered a large pepperoni, thin crust pizza yesterday evening and spent all of last night throwing it up!  Do not go to Donato's!"}
{"text":"Have ordered delivery several times and they are always on time and the pizza is always delicious. It's is literally the same and constant every time. So glad when I moved back to Ohio and a donatos was so close to me. Forgot how good it really is."}
{"text":"Tried several times to add the \"Belly Bite\" to try this location to no avail. Finally I gave up and called them only to find out they are no longer participating in the Belly program. Why haven't they been removed??? I'm getting frustrated at the whole Belly program."}
{"text":"After living and working in central Ohio I really missed Donatos since relocating to North Carolina. I was happy to find this Donatos while working in the area. The set up is odd and it appears maybe there were several restaurants in the building at once. 

I had to order my favorite, the Founders Favorite. Pizza was good and service prompt. I'll be sure to visit what is to me Ohio in North Carolina when I work in the area again."}
{"text":"Good pizza at a decent price. No complaints! I really like their thin crust and the sausage and onion is delicious!"}
{"text":"Placed an order for delivery. Waited for 1.5 hours when I was told it would take 40 mins. When I called they told me they had to cancel!! WTF. Keith did not even offer a deal for the missed delivery! Very disappointed. I hope Donatos addresses this with this location. Very poor customer service."}
{"text":"I love this pizza. This location is really good too, they are quick and polite."}
{"text":"Wow, Donatos has changed so much.  It used to be our favorite thin crust pizza.  Back in the day they claimed 100 pepperonis on a large and edge to edge toppings.  They sprinkled the top with Parmesan and the provolone was rich and abundant.  

Now the toppings are minuscule, the pepperoni thinner and tasteless, and no way does a large have anywhere near 100 pepperonis.  We only kept going because no one does a good thin crust in Cleveland...but now neither does Donatos.  No wonder all the locations are closing."}
{"text":"I would give this like a 3.5.  I have had takeout from here a couple of times and I found the meat pizza to be a bit too greasy and heartburn inducing, but I love the chicken spinach and mozzarella pizza.  The cheese bread (I am not sure which we had, I didn't order/pickup) was quite good as well.

After finding myself in the Southpark area, I stopped in for a small chicken, spinach and mozzarella pizza and it is much better when it is piping hot (but still survives a takeout drive of about 8 minutes well too).  

The food court type place that it is located in can be a bit difficult to get in and out of, and at off times I didn't have any trouble parking, though the lot is small so peak times could be a bit of a mess.  The booth that I sat in was not designed for fat people at all, but maybe the seating on the other end of the space is better."}
{"text":"This is the local donatos for my neighbourhood. Ordered a medium pizza thin crust with pepperoni, banana peppers,and meatballs. As far as pizza goes I like theirs the best of big chains. Unfortunately the pizza t tonight was just ok. I guess I should just stick to pepperoni only. The boneless wings followed suit. The best part of the meal was the cinnamon brick bread. A great ending. 
For the price a good place to get a
 decent pizza."}
{"text":"This is a peculiar review. After recently having a very positive experience, the same pizza shop commits a colossal boo boo .

I told others about Donatos. Having a party last Saturday, I called to have pizza for 50 people delivered. After hyming and hawing from a young lady, the phone was handed off to a young man. He told me that he couldn't deliver to my home. He told me that he couldn't deliver south of Emery which is 1000 feet from my home.

This was angering and unforgivable! Let's leave it at that!"}
{"text":"I placed an online order pick up order for a pizza and wings. My boyfriend went to pick it up and came home without any wings. I called the location to let them know they forgot to give us our wings. The employee put me on hold for several moments and then came back to tell me either I could come back and pick them up or they could credit my accounts he $7. No apology. I asked him if it was possible to have them delivered to us seeing as it was their mistake that they forgot them. He replied, \"no\". I asked why and his response was that because it wasn't a delivery order. I said, \"well ok.. if I pick them up is there some sort of discount or credit you can give me for the inconvenience and our time?\" He replied \"nope. Nothing I can do.\" I then asked if I could speak to a manager in which he replied \"you're talking to him\". I said \"well maybe there's someone higher than your position that I can speak with at a later time because I don't appreciate the way you are speaking to me\". His response \"John Donato.\" I then asked him his name and he said \"John Donato.\" And continued to speak to me disrespectfully and in a condescending manner. My boyfriend and I went to the location to pick up the wings only to see there was in fact a manager there named Tatiana. She gave us the gentleman's name... Mateusz Milaszewski. He wouldn't even come out to apologize. We passed on the order of wings in fear that he would do something to our food. I called a different location to speak to a manager and complain and received a phone call from a general manager within the half hour. He credited my order and said he would call that location and take care of it. The wings weren't the point. That is just terrible service and no one deserves to be treated that way. Completely ruined our night and our view of Donatos Pizza. Not to mention the pizza was undercooked and not even enjoyable. Not that anything would have been after that experience . The 2.5 stars for this location is legitimate and well deserved."}
{"text":"Today we ordered two personal pan pizzas around 3pm our estimated delivery time was 4:20pm.. well when 4:30 rolled around we still had no pizza we called and were advised by a worker that the driver should be pulling up any moment. 4:53pm rolls around and still no food. We call back and was told that the driver had just left the store.. now is that possible?? Now 5:05 and still no pizza. We just received an email advising our pizza had just left the store.. this is completely unacceptable! We are now almost 45 mins over the deliver time and have been lied to twice by the staff! Never again.. p.s. we live less then 15 mins away from the store..


Update: pizza finally arrived and what do you know.. it's cold!!! We called the store TWICE And the first time we were on hold forever and now they aren't even ANSWERING the phone.. you guys suck"}
{"text":"Second and LAST time I'll ever order from this place! 1. With tip it came up to $23 for a MEDIUM (12\") pizza with 2 Meats. Mushrooms and Extra Cheese. 2. It came over an hour late. Why? ONE of their drivers had an accident. OK, I'm TOTALLY sympathetic to that. But in an area the size of Southpark, they have only TWO drivers? Really? TWO????!!! WTF? 3. It came cold and the TASTE was MEH!

Three strikes....You're OUT Donatos!

Jet's is FARRRRRRRRRR better. And much less in price. There is TOOOO much competition to have a crappy business model of having only TWO drivers for such a large area. And their pizza just is NOT \"all that.\"

Forgettaboutit.

Out."}

{"text":"Unfortunately we didn't even stay long enough to enjoy the food.  Terrible service, 5 mins for a drink order, 10 minutes later, no drinks.  We walked out.  F this place and the people who work there. worthless humans."}

We got ten pizzas delivered (cheese and pepperoni) and they were great. There was so much pepperoni on the pizza! It was covered from edge to edge. By far the most pepperoni I've ever seen on a pizza. I also loved the rectangle pieces the pizza was cut up into, which made it great for sharing.

I don't think Donatos would be my first choice of pizza in the Charlotte area, but overall it was good."}
{"text":"Ordered two personal pizzas, a cheese and a Mariachi, both of which were fantastic.  Ordered online and the food was ready exactly when the webpage said it would be (10 minutes).

No idea why someone said the place felt unsafe.  There are no unsafe areas in South Park."}
{"text":"Yikes.  We ordered pizza and wings.  Both were really bad.  If you haven't had Donato's before, beware that it may not be what you're expecting when you think \"Pizza.\"  Its this really thin crust, and pretty meager on the cheese as well making it really insubstantial for the price and it just plain doesn't taste good.  The texture is wrong.  It's more akin to one of the cheap frozen pizzas from the Supermarket than a nice fresh pie from a local pizza joint.  Its even cut weird into these really small rectangles instead of a normal pie wedge shape.  The wings were bad too...the sauce was actually good, had a nice heat to it, but the wings themselves were soggy/rubbery.  It didn't help the quality of the food (or my frustration level) that it arrived an hour and 20 minutes after we ordered it.  They did give us a 50% discount due to the delay, which was nice.  But honestly that only brought the price down to what we would have paid at Domino's or Pizza Hut to begin with.  I am not sure how this place is rated as well as it is, but my recommendation is to skip it without further consideration."}
{"text":"I am new in town on temporary work assignment from ATL and I got delivery from here the other weeknight. I ordered a large thin crust veggie pie and some garlic cheese bread.  I signed up and did the online order thing and I really like this feature.  This was the best part of my meal.  The delivery was awesome as they stated online that my expected time was 29 minutes and they arrived in 27 minutes. (I always set the kitchen timer to see how they do)  So A-plus here.  
Now for the food-
The pie was a good portion.
The toppings were fresh.
The sauce was fresh, but bland and the cheese was minimal.
The whole thing was a little watery and the toppings and cheese seemed to be separate from the crust.
This was probably due to the water in the vegetables and then the lack of cheese to hold the whole thing together.
The cheesy garlic bread was nice, although pretty greasy, but hey, it's cheesy garlic bread.
All was presented well and the driver was friendly.
I can't say too many things bad about this place overall, I just did not care for the food very much.
It just didn't do it for me, but a good choice if the food DOES do it for you.
I may order again, just for the convenience of online ordering and speedy delivery so that I don't have to talk to some kid that will inevitably screw up my order by pushing the wrong picture buttons on the register."}
{"text":"First off, let me say I despise most chain corporation food outlets. Donato's was the exception that I used to hold up. Since it's the closest thing to thin crust Dayton style pizza I can find in CLE, I'm willing to drive half an hour round trip for it. 

Once again, employee incompetence ruins my fun. 

Ordered online. Got there and the pizza was ready but homeboy couldn't find my garlic bread. After five minutes bumbling around in back, they found it. Not really sure where. 

Eagerly but patiently drive home (watch out for Lakewood cops) and tear into my pizza... 

WHICH IS NOT EVEN FULLY COOKED. 

People bitch about a lot of petty shit on Yelp, I'm aware. Mushy dough is not one of these petty complaints. You cook pizza. Just do that one thing right!"}
{"text":"Always perfectly cooked! Delicious! The servers are always friendly and helpful as well. We seriously eat here at least once month!"}
{"text":"Ordered to-go. Got an individual pizza with a 5 piece wings. My food was done by the time I got there (at the time they estimated online). The place was really clean and the personnel was friendly. The pizza, thin crust sausage and mushroom, was perfectly cooked with ingredients crust to crust. Amazing! The wings, naked wings with mild sauce on the side, were cooked to perfection/just right... I think I found a new favorite pizza place"}
{"text":"My love affair with Donatos pizza start 3 summers ago when I visited Cleveland for the first time...I was married to the dominoes and pizza huts of the world and swore no one would treat me better...but then along she came...with those long curvy banana peppers calling my name, perky pepperoni, and those juicy meatballs...darn u..donatos...as soon as I took one bite of that thin crust, spicy, yet sweet pizza...I knew I was in trouble. 

It's a love hate relationship.
I love the pizza, but hate that there's no franchise in philly.  WHHHYYYY!??

Sure it's a bit pricey (around 15 a box) but the taste is priceless. Sure the service can be a little slow but it's always worth the wait. 

I suggest ppl to try a regular topping before getting one of their specials."}
{"text":"Donatos to the late night, hotel delivery rescue! 

Let me start by saying that before recently, I had lived in NEO my entire life and I never thought to order from here. I thought it was thick, square pizza. And that's not how I roll. Little did I know I was missing out on their delicious, thin crust pie. 

Long story short, we were in the Fairlawn area staying at a hotel for my sister's wedding. We'd been living off of buffet-style, preplanned meals for days and I just wanted something greasy and delicious to soak up the reception booze. No one was open but Domino's (yuck) and Donatos. 

I placed my order and it was to us at the hotel within like 15 minutes. WUT?! YES. It was the first time in my life my boyfriend and I have been able to almost finish a large pizza between the two of us. I loved the generous pepperoni distribution, the thin crust, and the super-savory (not sweet) sauce. I also loved that it was a round pizza cut into bite-sized rectangle pieces. 

Oh, and it was cheap. Yum!"}
{"text":"I love Donatos but absolutely had the worst experience with this one so I most definitely won't be back they threw my pizza together with the toppings falling off the edge drowned it in mushrooms that tasted old when I complained the manager Amber carelessly refused to make any changes im quite disappointed in Donatos let's see what filing a complaint will do"}
{"text":"Whenever my work orders in pizza for lunch, they go with Donato's. It's always very good and they have quite a few varieties of pizza to make everyone happy. I've been to a few Donato's in C-town but I think this is one of the best.

I would definitely order takeout. They have a small dining room, but they don't have waiter service. They have a phone at each table and you call your order in back to the kitchen - when we went, we had to repeat our order several times, it took forever to get the food, and there was no one to bring drink refills."}
{"text":"This once great pizza has gone downhill to a point where they might as well close this last one up.  I am writing this while my insides are  in great distress after eating one of their pizzas.  Never again will I be so stupid to eat from there again."}
{"text":"These guys treat me well! The thin crust pizza is always great - no matter what style you Get. I accidentally gave the delivery driver too much money and instead of walking away with my money - he rang my doorbell again saying - \"hey , I know I'm a good pizza man but I don't think I'm THAT good.\" Proceeded to show me the mistake I had made.. Very much appreciated, I wish I got his name. I tipped him $30 though for being genuine. Not a lot of people are like that in this world today. Thank you to the Donato's delivery guy who did that for me! You're a great person"}
{"text":"Received a deluxe pizza on time and the taste was impressive as were the amount of toppings.  It did however, show up a little cold and the middle of the pizza was soggy. Will definitely try again."}
{"text":"I ordered online and picked up in store. For one, this is the largest Donatos I've ever seen and very clean. My order didn't show up in the computer but Charlie did all he could to fix the problem. The food was great but I'm really giving 5 stars for Charlie, his customer service is top notch and I will return off of his kindness alone."}
{"text":"Love going to this new, clean, modern store in the Van Aken shopping plaza.  I'm a fan of Donato's thin crust pizzas and the quality from this store doesn't disappoint."}
{"text":"Ok pizza but the original order indicated it would be ready at 8:02. I got an email at 8:12 saying the order had \"left the building. Over 25 minutes later, no pizza. I could actually walk from my house to this location in about 10 minutes. Tried to respond to all the emails I got, and all of them came back undeliverable. And no contact/feedback link within the app. Needless to say, by the time the pizza got to me, over an hour after I ordered it, it was cold."}
{"text":"I enjoy the pizza my delivery is almost always late, and when it's late, it's cold.  Today, I placed my order over 2 hours ago, they said it would be 30 minutes for delivery...I still don't have my pizza.  I called back about 30 minutes ago and they said it was on its way and it would be right here (no apology) - I live 1 mile away.  If you can't deliver, just tell customers to come pick it up.  That would better than being 2 hours late. **Still don't have my pizza**"}
{"text":"Came in because of a Groupon and had the margherita pizza. So cheesy and delicious. I will be back!"}
{"text":"The first time I tried to order pizza from this location, I was told it was a 2 hour and 45 minuet wait, on a weeknight, I said forget it to ordering from them. Second time, another week night, it was an hour and 15 minuet wait, whatever, no big deal, got pizza, but it was someone else's. I could not settle because I don't eat meat and one of the toppings was pepperoni. Called them immediately, told them I got wrong pizza, the manager I talked to told me they can just credit me the money, or wait another hour and 15 minuets to get my pizza I ordered delivered. She was EXTREMELY rude to me, and was treating me like I was an inconvenience to her, even though it was their screw up. Customer service/management is horrible. Will never order again, it's a bummer because I actually like Donatos pizza."}
{"text":"Whenever I'm in town I hit up this place. The pizza used to be extra amazing but the last couple of times it's just been good. The staff is always friendly and the food is definitely hot when it arrives."}
{"text":"Amazing and unique Pizza. I rate it 5/5 stars. I'm a transplant from Ohio, and miss this pizza chain. It's good quality ingredients and flavorful mix of sauce and slightly crunchy crust, giving you a taste like no other pizza. The service here is great, with tons of seating and parking, and they also deliver. They also have lots of specials and coupons. Encourage you to try this pizza and see if you don't fall in love with it like I have :)"}
{"text":"What a surprise! I was here for a night for an appointment the following day and I needed a quick place to eat that would deliver to my hotel. Donatos was recommended to me from the pamphlet in my room. A quick glance at their menu and it seemed like a typical pizzeria. But no... Upon delivery of my food, a pepperoni zinger personal pan, it looked scrumptious. The smell completely sent my olfactory system into overdrive and my stomach started speaking in grumbles. 

The golden brown crust had a warm crispy outer crust with a nice soft inside. There was just enough cheese that was browned and stringy with out being too rubbery. The pepperoni had a nice crunch and had an excellent spicy flavor. The pizza sauce for this particular pizza was incredible and should be included on all their pizzas. It had an additional zing of pepper and added that necessary bite. 

Deliver was prompt. They said 30 minutes and it came within 25 minutes. There was no waiting on the phone for the next available person unlike other pizzerias. 

I want to eat here again, I just need a reason to be back in Cuyahoga Falls."}
{"text":"Tried this pizza chain since a friend was craving it.  I never even noticed it was in this plaza eventhough I've been there multiple times for Los Habaneros.  We ordered a large pepperoni thin crust pizza to share. We were told it would take 14 minutes to make but it seemed like it was faster than that.  The pizza was actually pretty good! I was pleasantly surprised. It's nothing really special but its good for something quick if you're in the area and it has decent prices.  The workers were quick and attentive (granted we were the only customers...). Not sure if I'll make it back, but I would consider ordering delivery if they delivered to my area."}
{"text":"Miss this place more than anything from Ohio.  So so happy it's here.  Really hoping this location is successful.   Thank you so much to whoever brought donatos to charlotte.  Your staff did a great job on my first visit."}
{"text":"The pizza here taste pretty good I was surprised that it didn't taste horrible however the atmosphere really kinda threw me off this donators is hard to find and once you get inside it's like a weird abandoned food court cafeteria thing with bad lighting"}
{"text":"Just boof it. All you need to know about this pizza is its best if you boof it. Order everything and boof it to the high heavens. God I can smell the sauce boss now. Skrrrrt"}
{"text":"Horrible customer service, terrible drivers, advance orders never ready at time specified. The pizza itself is great, but everything else about this location is simply abhorrent."}
{"text":"I love the tgin crust pizza. Founders favorite is really good and so is the pepperoni"}
{"text":"Mmm so good. Thin, crispy and hot....just the way mama likes it!! But really, the pizza was tasty and the service was friendly and professional. I saw a ton of bad reviews on the service so I was skeptical but it was perfect!! It's my new fav chain pizza place for when you just want a slice or two of zaa at home by the fireplace"}
{"text":"I have always loved Donatos, even when I was a kid. I think it is a little expensive so I don't opt for it when I'm looking for a quick pizza fix. 

So we ordered 2 large because we had a coupon, and coupons are the way to go for sure. We got the 150 pepperoni which means I guess they count out 150 pepperoni's for this pizza and we got the thin crust for this one. This is the way to go. I would choose this over anything else they have every time. The other one we got was the pan pizza and it was the Trio I believe. It was OK, lot of sauce which we are not a fan of. The pan pizza didn't even come close to Pizza Hut's so that was a let down. The other bad part was the service. The girl that took our order was probably in high school and looked and acted like her life was just miserable. She was on her phone and didn't even acknowledge us when we were standing at the counter to order. 

I still really do like the thin pizza here. I wouldn't stray away from that again tho. Get a pepperoni thin crust and you will be very happy!"}
{"text":"For chain, processed food the sandwiches and pizza are pretty consistant and good.  Employees are always nice and take my coupons without busting my balls.  Plenty of seats to eat in.  Even a patio for the obnoxious \"I need a patio to be seen while I'm eating\" Yelper.  Cant comment on delivery times cuz I'm not a lazy turd.  I get off mi arse and pick it up son!"}
{"text":"First off, if this app would allow me to write a review without giving any stars, I wouldn't have even given this place one. It took about 15 minutes for our waitress to even get our order. There are only two other party's of about 3-4 so it doesn't really make sense why it took so long. We've been waiting about 40 minutes for our pizza. The employees have messed up the other party's orders as we've been waiting. Also the employees are so dumb like literally they're standing around doing shit. As we were sitting here I heard someone quote \"Who would've guessed this place would be THIS bad.\" This is probably worse than the time where I was stuck on a bridge for 6 hours and had to pee. Don't come here. Just don't. Getting run over by a car would be less painful than this experience."}
{"text":"We were craving something, anything to eat at my house for dinner. The husband suggested Donato's as thin-crust pizza is his favorite. We called it in and ordered one mariachi chicken pizza and one pepperoni and olive pizza.  I volunteered to go pick it up. It's the middle of winter, there's tons of snow on the ground and I'm from California. It's time like these I wish they had delivery to my place but I'm no wuss so I drove to get it. There was a pick up/drive thru window. It was so convenient! Not to mention they are open until 11pm on a weekday. The worker was super friendly and got my pizzas to me right away. He suggested I be careful driving. Service like this is is becoming extinct in certain places but I'm glad it's not going anywhere at my local Donato's. Pizza was great too. Tasty and flavorful. Will keep coming back for good taste and great customer service."}
{"text":"Dinner Jan 25
  Being from Ohio, I grew up on pizza like Donatos (thin crust, toppings to the edge, cut into squares).  So for me, this is like going home and I love it.  But I also understand that it may be a shock to those looking for big, super cheesy, triangle cut, NY Style pizza.
  Founders Pizza is good, but my favorite is always the Pepperoni, Sausage and Onion (love the way the thinly sliced onions get crispy on top of the pizza.  I always ask for a cup of pizza sauce and i will dip pieces of pizza in the sauce.
  The side Italian salad is also really good (I always ask for an extra dressing).
  The Big Don Sub is an oven baked Italian type sub (i get with no Italian Dressing and ask them to add pizza sauce). 
  Every time I am in Charlotte, I try to go to Donatos!"}
{"text":"I've had people tell me their pizza isn't that great, but I was pleased.  I just got a small thin-crust with sausage & I really liked it!  I wouldn't eat it here though because this Donato's is in with 3 other restaurants (D!/Orange Julius, Bojangles & a cafeteria) & it's pretty much bedlam in there & messy.  Oh, parking is in the back."}
{"text":"I ordered the individual sized pizza with pepperoni and spinach, breadstick, and fountain drink combo. It was all delicious and it was ready to eat in good time."}
{"text":"Don't ask me why, but since I was a teenager I have loved this place.  Being an Italian, I am obsessed with red sauce.  I get nothing but a typical hand tossed pizza, extra sauce, light cheese.  No toppings.  This is the only pizza place I ever do that from just because I don't want any distraction from the red sauce, lol.  

You order at the counter, big deal, and wait about 10-15 minutes before your pizza is before you.  This place is nothing special and I can understand why other people give it low reviews, but again it's something about their sauce that gets me!!"}
{"text":"It's sad, because I really like donatos pizza. I called to order two pizzas and arrived 15 min later, when they said it would be ready. When I arrived, they could not find my order. Then they found it in the back, where it wasn't even started. The entire staff was hanging out on the side, talking and not working. They offered no apology or discount for me having to wait an extra 15-20 minutes. I will not be back."}
{"text":"2 days ago got email for 20% off coupon, guess I had to order 2, can't beat that deal so I ordered 1 Ham & 1 Pepperoni no Romano shake, just as usual it was great, love the the drive-up window usually we dine in place is generally clean inside. 

    As far as the pizzas go lots of pepperoni but the ham I wish they added a little bit more & not clumped together, usually is fine but this time it wasn't, the flavor was on point on the on both pies. 

    The app is fairly easy to use, the only issue I have is sometimes I can't use the discount code for 2 pies, I'll have to close our them place a 2nd order usually I'll get a call from one of the workers asking if I meant to place the order, which I liked that they confirmed it, I highly recommend using either online or app. I live about 20 minutes by the time I get there it's coming out the oven. 

    I doubt know why they get negative reviews because the times we've dined in we had no problems, keep up the great job..."}
{"text":"Fantastic Pizza!!! They put a ton of pepperoni on it and the flavor of the crust is outstanding. I definitely recommend ordering one for delivery. The whole family will love it. No more arguing which crappy pizza the kids want. No more dominos,pizza hut, papa who cares, or little Cesar's cardboard."}
{"text":"I love the pizza. Mariachi beef is outstanding.

I don't eat here often because it is quite pricey for chain pizza. Have had a few occasions where they forget sour cream for the Mariachi beef.  If they were more consistent with remembering all the items for delivery and had more competitive prices, I would eat here more often. As it is, I eat here just a couple times a year."}
{"text":"I just moved from Cbus and my local Donatos was the one that the owner gets her pizza from, so they take care of you. First time I ordered from this location and I asked for, as I always do, extra sauce. I think they took that as \"no sauce\" because it was like cardboard with toppings. Disappointed."}
{"text":"This is a chain popular in OH. The crust is thin, crispy and a little salty on the bottom. I have had the veggie, founders favorite, and spicy beef pizza. All of their pizzas are great. They don't put a ton of cheese or sauce,  so ask for extra if this concerns you. They were fast and friendly. This is my favorite pizza place. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I have ordered pizza from this location multiple times and they deliver. Called in and a gentleman turned down my business saying that they cannot deliver to me. I told him I'm a mile from the place. He said \"oh well\". I then said \"so your turning down my business\" and he replied \"yup
The computer won't let me order. A pizza place that turns down business????"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years and somehow they've always had friendly attentive staff...and at a pizza joint no less!  They don't even cringe when I order anchovies!  I really appreciate that they offer green olives as well.  This place deserves your business!"}
{"text":"We get Donatos pizza every other week, so clearly big fans of the pizza here.  Best pizza, especially for the price, in the Solon area.  Thin crust specialty.  

We place order online and use the pick up window in Solon (so can't comment on the dine in experience).  The pizza is consistently available at or even before the time estimate from the online order.  Pizza quality is consistent, hot, and delicious!  We will typically order Large pizza and breadsticks. I think they are known for the edge to edge pepperoni, but classic cheese is also delicious.

Price is slightly more than what you'll find at other pizza delivery competitors, but Donatos quality is worth a few extra dollars and you can always find coupon codes online.  

I've always found the staff to be friendly and responsive, although they seem to have a fair amount of turnover."}
{"text":"I haven't had Donatos in a very long time since moving to the western half of the US.  Recently relocated to Charlotte so thrilled to see them here.   It isn't gourmet wood fired but it's a pretty good smaller chain.  They started out family owned, then McDs purchased and mucked it up, now I think they have been back under original family for awhile.

Love the mariachi beef, that's what I went for this first visit and it was great.  I have never found a similar Mexican style half as good anywhere.  Their pepperoni is really great too as are their subs, ask for the Big Don with pizza sauce, you will love it!"}
{"text":"Been to Donatos since I was a kid I love this place the famous thin crust pizza is the best very delicious, the ingredients are always fresh last time I went was a little bit of a wait but it was worth it I usually get the meat lovers love it. Pizza is reasonably priced so that's also a plus I would suggest this place to all pizza lovers especially if you have never had this before so what are you waiting for ? Go order lol"}
{"text":"When it comes to chain pizza takeout/delivery in Cleveland, Donato's is where it's at. PJ, Domino's and the others cannot hold a candle to the fresh ingredients and yummy crust at Donato's. The Lakewood location in particular is spacious for eat in - even has an outdoor patio for the summertime. This Donato's is in a super cool historical building, yet has a speedy pick up window for when I call in my order on my way home from work. Many specialty pizzas to choose from and they always have good specials. The thin crust will not disappoint. And they cut the pizza in SQUARES! That's probably close to the best thing ever."}
{"text":"I admit to being pretty surprised. I've had better pizza in Cleveland but this was very solid and would certainly try it again. 

Would like to address the reviewer who felt it appropriate to give one star and claim Donatos food made her ill. While that very well may have been the case (hey, things happen. I got food poisoning from a 5 star NYC restaurant once), it seems somewhat irresponsible to make that claim without a few more facts, i.e. was the pizza the ONLY food she'd eaten that day? If not, then unless she's a medical professional or food scientist I'd have to call her claim specious at best and slanderous at worst. 

Bottom line is Donatos serves a good product at a fair price. Don't be misled by a review which very well may not reflect what it states, plus it's over three years old."}
{"text":"There are not that many delivery options around here and I'm not a huge fan of pizza. I ordered from Donato's on one of those days when I just didn't feel like going out or cooking. To my surprise the pizza was delicious. I loved the thin crust, the flavorful cheese and the well seasoned sauce. In a word tasty. The salad and wings are delicious too."}
{"text":"One of my absolute  fav pizza chains. The chicken Mariachi is my absolute fav pizza.  It has spice and a cooling sour cream on the side. I know, your like what? Sour cream? Well its spicey enough that you need a cooling agent. It tickles the tummy and your esophagus if you like it hot ask for extra jalapenos!"}
{"text":"The meatball sandwiches are absolutely delicious, as well as their pizzas (not doughy at all).  However, the only problem I have is that this place is extremely over priced, and the service can be slow at times.  Over all, I highly recommend giving  this place a chance if you have the financial means."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Charlotte (my opinion).  The thin crust is really good- it's like a giant cracker.  The sauce is not too thick and relatively sweet.  Very generous with the pepperonis- they cover the whole pizza.  Wait time is also super short.  Call ahead pick-up usually gets a pie in 10-15 minutes.  

If you live in an apartment, delivery might take a while, but I guess that depends on how intuitive the building numbers are (mine sucks).   There's that, but pick-up is usually flawless."}
{"text":"I love Donato's Pizza (as far as pizza from a chain comes).  It's in a pretty cool building, although the seating area of the restaurant is quite small.  I love the thin crust pizza.  If I'm ordering out from a nationwide chain, this is my favorite."}
{"text":"Donatos makes great pizza!

Donatos serves up one of my favorite pizzas of all time - the thin crust bacon pizza!  Devilishly good!  The first time I tried Donatos, I was fixing a friend's computer in Lakewood.  She rewarded me with a Donatos thin crust bacon pizza and I will forever be in her debt.

The thin crust pizza Donatos serves is the shit.  You gotta try it.  You're gonna love it!  Forget what your cardiologist said for one day and try the bacon thin crust - you'll thank me."}
{"text":"Food is good. I got the buffalo chicken sub and garlic brick bread. The bread is delicious! However this is the first time I ordered from there and they messed up my sub. I asked for no tomatoes or green peppers and a substitute of banana peppers and onions instead. Instead they sent me one with green peppers and tomatoes. It's still okay, just disappointed that I didn't get what I paid for..."}
{"text":"Donato's hit the Charlotte area a few years back and probably came in a little strong at first instead of building a small area.  The dust has settled now, but fortunately they still deliver to our house.

Pizza is a personal choice and Im not here to arguer the merits of one style vs another, but as far as chain pizza joints go, I would have to say that Donatos is our go to pie.   We usually order the Founder's favorite (spicier) or the Pepperoni Zinger with fresh mozz.

I would stay away from the salads, nothing too special here.  The regular wings are a touch on the small side.   I do have to say that the Apple dessert is one of the better desserts offered by a Pizza chain.   

For my money, Donatos is a cut above the other chains."}
{"text":"This is the deal. On the whole, I'm really not that \"into\" pizza. As an American, I know that's considered sacrilege for some. Truth be told, it's just a rare occasion for me to crave pizza or for it to impress me. Well guess what? Donatos changed that last weekend!

We ordered two pies for delivery: The Works and Very Vegy. Both were fantastic. The housemade sausage on The Works is delicious and I really enjoyed the unique topping of banana peppers on the Vegy. Speaking of toppings, both pizzas were loaded. No skimping here, and sprinkled almost to the edge of the pies. And that crust! SO good--not too thick, not paper thin, and with a hint of cornmeal that gave it such great flavor. Nom nom. Donatos knows how to make pizza that is craveable, even for this very occasional pizza eater!"}
{"text":"I've been getting pizza here for quite sometime it's great tasting pizza crust is not too thick ,and toppings are great . Try the wings excellent they cook them the right way a little crispy. There's a manager there named Darryl very customer oriented manager takes care of business . I had a limited break this evening and got my food prepared just in time and I made it back too work in time. The dining room is fabulous spacious take the kids order a pizza and sit in the nice dining area. Kudos Donatos"}
{"text":"We love there pizza here. We always get the thin crust. There are not many donatos left in Charlotte but we will continue to come to this place!!! We ordered a pepperoni, mushroom, onion pizza and it's great!!"}
{"text":"Ordered approx. 9pm. 1 large the works, big don italiano sub, cinnamon bricks street bread, and a deluxe stromboli. Order arrived almost an hour later, cold pizza. Cold stromboli, and burnt brick street bread. Weak stromboli.....Unacceptable in every way possible 31 bucks and I tipped over 3 bucks. NOT GOOD."}
{"text":"Donato's is good! They have thin or thick crust pizza, yet I suggest sticking to the thin!! The topping selection is great and the salads are also very good!! The service is pretty helpful but sometimes slow!"}
{"text":"Order was exactly what I asked for. I put emphasis on well done wings, and they delivered them that way. Employee taking the order was helpful. Pizza taste great. And delivery driver was nice. Delivery time 30 min, actual delivery time 20."}
{"text":"We are long time customers of Donatos in Columbus and Grove City but this Donatos (Cleveland-Shaker Heights) tried to sell us a load of crap that their chicken wings will have a darker color because of how the skin cooks. The so called manager, the night of June 22, 2018, spoke over me when I was trying to explain to her how burnt the wings were and then snapped at me that it would like 45 minutes before they could get another order put to us. New manager needed at this store along with better cooks."}
{"text":"I remember long time ago I saw this place on Undercover Boss and my head said, \"ooh, I need to try this place.\" So when we moved to Charlotte and found out there was a location here in town we said yes, please.

However, our first visit is sadly our last visit. I just was not impressed with the pizza or the price and the serving. Super thin crust which I actually love but the sauce was not as delicious as I read in other reviews and I was just left feeling like I wasted my money and my time on this.

Pizza should make me feel warm and fuzzy and happy when eating and this did not just do it for me. 

The employees were okay. The girl ringing us up was new and wasn't able to place the order for the pizza how I wanted. Instead of finding out how to do it, she told us we couldn't do that way. In the end, she asked a coworker after our order was placed and they were making our pizza and indeed found out she was wrong. A little late right?

This donato's is inside a food court that is shared with other business but the tables right in front have red pepper flakes and parm cheese shakers on the tables. Tables were not the cleanest and it was pretty empty in there."}
{"text":"One of my favorite pizza places. Took quite a little detour off of the turnpike to get Donatos, but we like it that much.

This is a nice restaurant. Looks to be fairly new. The staff was very friendly. 

The pizzas didn't take long to arrive and they were delicious, as usual."}
{"text":"Not too many Donatos in my area, but I'm willing to drive out of my way for one of these pies. I ordered a Hawaiin pizza: think thin crust, pizza sauce, pineapple, cinnamon, almond slivers, ham. Just heavenly. A large pizza was $15 though which satisfied the 3 of us. Interestingly, they cut their slices in to little squares not the usual pizza pie triangle. For me, this is definitely worth the calories"}
