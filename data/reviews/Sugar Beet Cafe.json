{"text":"This is a  little way out of town, but worth the visit.  It is a little gem attached to a gas station.  Food is nice and staff very accomodating.  If you have to wait for a table they have hot coffee outside that you can have for no charge."}
{"text":"I don't think it's necessarily a bad thing that I am skeptical about trying out a restaurant that is attached to a gas station. So when my husband kept singing the praises of this relatively new little diner in Fairview, I didn't pay the attention that I should have and didn't try out this little gem until recently. 

Due to it's location in a former Waffle House, Sugar Beet is designed in the classic diner style- with a breakfast bar in the middle and booths around the perimeter. It is tidy, with minimal decor, and its appearance really gives no indication of what kind of food you might be in for. 

The first discovery that excited me was that the menu offered a nice selection of smoothies. The next delight was free-range eggs and a selection of meat alternatives, such as tempeh strips. I was not in a truck stop after all!

I ordered the huevos rancheros ( I am failing to remember the actual name of the dish, but you get the idea), which arrived with avocado strips, an excellent homemade salsa with a hint of smoked flavor, and beautifully-seasoned homefries. My husband ordered the breakfast burrito, which arrived as TWO burritos (no skimping on portions here). Our companion ordered the cornbeef hash, which he maintained was the very best thing on the menu. We were stuffed, but diligently ate every last bite. 

 Sugar Beet is not all about breakfast, but you can get it any time. Lunch items, in equally generous portions, are offered as well. I will be going back to this tasty place very soon with the hope of sampling enough of the menu to turn 4 stars into 5. Those of you tired of fighting your way through the crowd to get a decent Asheville breakfast can slip away to Fairview for a real treat. But, don't wait too long, because the secret is most definitely out!"}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME. We only just discovered it upon moving to Fairview but had I known about it before we would have been coming a long time ago. I'm so glad it's so close to my new house & I can see us going there quite a bit. The service is great & they always have good music playing too. The food is AMAZING. Try any of the eggs benedict specials & the burger is pretty delicious as well.

Update: This place closed. I am still in mourning. RIP Sugar Beet Cafe. I hardly knew ye."}
{"text":"yes, It's a short drive if you live in Asheville. yes it used to be a waffle house. YES, it's delicious and worth it!  Granted, my 5-star rating is valuing it on its own merits; not whether it is the most fantastic restaurant I've ever been to, but for what it is, it's perfect. Friendly staff each time I've been.  I like what they have to offer on the menu, the food and the baked goods are FRESH, same goes for the coffee, and the prices aren't bad either.  I love having breakfast here."}
{"text":"The food is amazingly tasty for a restaurant attached to a gas station. Make that for any restaurant. I eat here generally once a week and am never disappointed with the food or the service.  A great place."}
