{"text":"Choosing between ice cream and French fries reminds me of the time I was forced  to choose which one of my children would die. Thank you, Sweetie Fry, for inflicting your tasty horrors upon my mouth.

Over and ou-- Hmm? Oh, shit, I meant \"dye.\" Like, dye their hair. Sorry, sorry. It's these goddamned homophones, y'know? Ugh, I swear they are the wurst. But, no, I meant the time when it was Halloween and my son Ronny wanted to go as Selena Gomez, and his brother Donny, bless his heart, wanted to go as Demi Lovato, and of course the both of them are as blonde as their father is. That was back when Frank had just gotten laid off and we only had enough money to allow one of the boys to get their hair dyed for their costume. Boy, did Donny have a fit. That's right about the time when he stopped loving us. Started sassing back all the time. Frank and I cried so hard when we decided to have him killed in that staged carjacking. Really, it was one of the hardest decisions we ever had to make. Almost as hard as the choice between the gourmet ice cream and divine French fries available at Sweetie Fry. Thank God they're open til 1 am on Saturdays; that kind of convenience really affords me plenty of time to make a well informed decision."}
{"text":"If you like peanut butter, you HAVE to get their peanut ice cream with banana/jelly sorbet/coffee/chocolate/anything. It's amazing!
I have yet to try their fries, but they always look delicious! Definitely a must-stop place in Cleveland"}
{"text":"Have you ever been at Wendy's and \"accidentally\" dipped your french fries into your Frosty only to realize that the combination is actually kind of amazing?

Totally speculation, but I'm pretty sure that's the inspiration behind Sweetie Fry. It's a pretty simple concept that you're probably jealous you didn't come up with yourself: french fries and ice cream.

The ice cream is creamy, rich, and flavorful. The offerings include traditional flavors like vanilla, cookies & cream, etc. as well as more interesting flavors like maple bacon and goat cheese. You can't go wrong. You also get a \"Sweetie scoop\" with every order - a mini scoop on top that lets you sample a flavor for next time. What an awesome idea. 

Fries are totally awesome. Pizza fries, chicken tender fries, funnel cake fries - the list goes on. 

A great cozy little spot."}
{"text":"I went to Sweetie Fry as the +1 for a Yelp event.  The experience left me impressed with the establishment, but I'm unlikely to go back.  As a food experience I'm confused what void in available restaurant selections is filled by a place that serves fries and ice cream.  They obviously put a lot of effort into producing a quality product, in particular I thought the ice cream was excellent - lots of flavor and not overwhelming sweetness.  So if I do wind up back here it'll be an after-dinner stop."}
{"text":"We got a deal here from Living Social. Tried the pizza fries, which were a little underwhelming and hard to eat. We saw some waffle fries going out that looked really good, so we'll probably try those next time instead. 

As far as the ice cream goes, the flavors were great. We tried French Toast and Chocolate Stout. Both flavors were spot-on, but both also had large ice crystals in them. :( Kind of a rookie mistake in the artisinal ice cream world. 

Also, there was a ten-year-old kid sweeping up the floor and wiping tables, which didn't really seem right."}
{"text":"$9.90 For 2 cups of great ice cream we ate on this really beautiful day on a bench on the street.  HOWEVER, the counter guys really pushed getting a tip.  Service was ok, but the only time a tip has ever been suggested to me for ice cream to go.  Really not sure I like the idea of going back"}
{"text":"If you are going to charge $12 for French fries, they better be good, Hot, and consistent. These were not.  
It was not terribly crowded last night at 8pm. There was only one customer already at the counter.  I'm not sure what the girl who took my order did, since I needed to repeat it to the boy at the register. I paid, for tax on a to go order by the way, and was told to wait in the back.  
After the guy ahead of me got his fries, I started to watch the clock since my to go ice cream was now hopelessly becoming soup.  Young kids kept chatting at the window, with whomever was back there. After 15 minutes more, I stood up and went to the window. The guy seemed shocked to see me, and he handed me my fries that had been sitting there.  Although he said they were fresh, they were cold, hard and had no truffle oil. I threw them and the ice cream soup away.
 I've had Sweetie Fry fries twice before, and they were great.  I was really looking forward to the same and was very disappointed. A local told me quality falls off when the owner isn't there. Well, owner you should have been there."}
{"text":"My day was centered around visiting Sweetie Fry today as I wanted to totally treat myself to a gluttonous lunch.  I had to wait until they opened (2:30) but it was no problem as I hung out at Phoneix Coffee, right down the street.  I introduced myself  to the owner, Keith and was treated to sample after sample of all of the AMAZING flavors that he had to offer.  Pumpkin flavors will certainly steal the show this time of year and his small soup pot of salted caramel should not be missed,  he took the time to put caramel onto a small spoon for me to sample.  Goat Cheese with honey and walnuts was my choice after trying everything.  My head was reeling after so many wonderful samples.  Vegan-non dairy fruit sorbets are present for some nice variety and you can tell they stand behind the perfection in each flavor!  I can only hope that the strawberry sour cream will be there the next time I visit.  The color and flavor of this one was so fresh and reminded me of strawberries that we would pick and eat at the local strawberry patch in my hometown.
After enjoying a perfect basket of fries with gorgonzola cheese and tabasco sauce, I was ready to commit to a few flavors of ice cream.  
What was the most refreshing thing about my visit was the enthuiaism of the owner.  He is on to something here, especially if customers are so valued as I was!"}
{"text":"I've only been once so far - but was very impressed!  The ice-cream was fantastic, I had goat cheese with walnuts and honey.  I had friends with and they were also impressed.  One was 9 years old and decided the pizza fries were worth it - for sure!  Small space inside but if the weather's good, it doesn't really matter.  Great staff, friendly and good with kids.  

Great alternate place to go with friends but especially nice when bars are not an option."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. The fries are served in a huge portion that would be good for two hungry people or three light snackers. I would recommend the pizza fries. The ice cream is some of the best I have ever had in Cleveland. The owner went to the ice cream school at Penn State, and let me tell you, whatever he paid for tuition was well worth it. Try the maple bacon and the french toast, both are incredible."}
{"text":"Good Stuff!!! Fries were pipein hot! The French Toast ice cream was extremely good and perfect for the hot 70+degree day we had. But I did have to add a lil bit of spice a lil dab of chocolate chilli ice cream will do!! Beware tho hot days brings lines out the door"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to get ice cream. I went two nights in a row for their goat cheese ice cream with honey and walnuts. YUM!!"}
{"text":"Nice people, cute store, so-so ice cream and fries. Inventive ice cream flavors (french toast! strong coffee w. cocoa nibs, goat cheese!) but they don't quite live up to their promise. We found the flavors not intense enough, and perhaps not as creamy as you'd want for fancy ice cream? Nothing wrong with the fries, but kindof pricey for what they are, even with the fancy fixins. Still, a perfectly nice place to hang out in the neighborhood on a summer night."}
{"text":"I tried Sweetie Fry out last week and it's a cute little place. Definitely a good place to grab fries and ice cream (how can you go wrong with that?). The fries were good cooked to order and were very crispy without being hard. The ice cream was pretty good too. Overall, I like the place."}
{"text":"What a great neighborhood ice cream spot. Not only do my kids get to try amazing flavors, but they feel like they are part of a community instead of just a patron at a chain place. The flavors are rich and creative. I have yet to try the fries - I usually just go for the ice cream. Although, every time I see someone with an order of fries, I'm tempted to ask for just one!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Simple, straight forward, and awesome food.  This and east coast custard are the two best places on the central east side for ice-cream. 

The strawberry, cookies and cream, and peanut butter & jelly flavors are all great.  Also, get a toasted pecan made fresh."}
{"text":"Chili Chocolate ice cream = heaven!  Open until the middle of the morning = heavenly!  No greasy fryer smell and fun environment."}
{"text":"FRENCH FRIES: I've never had them so I can't comment.

ICE CREAM: AMAZING!! So soft, and flavorful!! The small \"sweetie scoop\" is the best so you can get 1 scoop and get a bonus small scoop of another ice cream. My favorite is the NY Cheesecake with a sweetie scoop of the Strawberry & Cream ice cream.

ATMOSPHERE: not a big shop so it can get crowded, but it only shows how much everyone loves the place.

All in all, a great place to get some ice cream!!"}
{"text":"FOOD:
What gets better than a place that serves just ice cream and fries! The fries are awesome because of all the interesting dipping sauces. And the ice cream is even better. I always get the interesting flavors with my favorite ones being the goat cheese, the maple bacon and the French toast. 

ATMOSPHERE:
The place can get crowded especially at night, on the weekends and come summer time. The layout was a little odd with the pick-up window being in the back and kind of hidden. There isn't a large sign to let people know the pick-up window is back there, and you can easily miss your name being shout out when it gets super crowded and noisy. So if you ordered some fries, remember to walk pass the small sitting area to the pick-up window in the back to get your order."}
{"text":"I'm pretty sure Sweetie Fry can't go wrong. (And this is after one visit.)

I know everyone was excited about Jeni's ice cream and I was too, but something about the addition of french fries catches my attention even more.

When I missed out on the stand Sweetie Fry had in Coventry, I cried a little inside. The promise of maple bacon ice cream close to home had sifted through my fingers. I was going to go without ever knowing what Sweetie Fry was like for the rest of my life...

And then!! Sweetie Fry moves into this really cute and sweet location on Lee! Perfect! I went for the first time on a Saturday and we were a bit early, so we ran some errands and came back at 12:02, since the door said they open at 12. Door locked. GASP. Then, a man let us in and told us they don't open for another half hour, but we can come in and sample some ice cream. Immediately, the owner struck up conversation with us and began trying to pair ice creams with our personalities and other tastes! It was so fun! The girl behind the counter was just as helpful, suggesting her favorites and good \"sweetie scoops\" (a mini scoop of another flavor on top of your first choice. cute and good for people such as myself--bad at decisions.) to add on to our regular orders. Once the owner heard that I love goat cheese, he went and got his box of goat cheese shipped from Wisconsin and showed me the gigantic mouth watering hunks of cheese. I had to try the ice cream and of course, that's the one I settled on! The key lime pie was eerily similar to a piece of pie and ended up being my second choice, but my sweetie scoop choice was the cinnamon--definitely not like Big Red; delicious! 

Unfortunately, they weren't making fries since we came in early, so we didn't get to try those, but I'm sure they're amazing. I'll be coming back for more of that goat cheese ice cream, for sure! And definitely returning for some of the maple bacon, which they were out of."}
{"text":"Only been here once and it is the place I think about every day. Why? Why is it that fries and ice cream are the thing I crave the most now? The gorgonzola dolce tabasco fries were great! Very strong flavor- good stuff. I now have tried some of the other fries and they were not quite on the flavor meter to the level of the gorgonzola dolce fries.

Goat cheese walnut honey ice cream was killer. Creamy and delicious goat cheese with chopped walnuts then honey hand drizzled over it. The strawberry sour cream had an incredible texture and flavor. Not a big fan of the other flavors I have tried. Give me Mitchell's dark chocolate over theirs any day.

I downgraded this to three stars because every time I come there lately (twice in the last few months) they are sold out of their best flavors.  I did have another order of fries and it was just not on the level of the Gorgonzola fries. Still wish them luck. Just keep some stock.  The one day literally half the board was sold out. If they are that busy I am happy for them but sad for me."}
{"text":"Stopped by after dinner at Brennan's Colony because I saw it being set up over the summer when they were giving out free stuff to drum up business, and I'm really pleased.

You get La Gelateria size servings for La Gelateria prices, but I'd say the flavors here are MUCH better. The hazelnut ice cream comes with caramel (i think) coated hazelnuts in just about every bite, and the maple bacon ice cream has MASSIVE chunks of candied bacon that put The B-Spot's bacon apple caramel sunday to shame.

The service was friendly and the space was very well done and the only complaint I'd have would be that its too small, but then again, there will probably be chairs on the sidewalk, or kids sitting on the sidewalk if there aren't.

Haven't had the fries, but someone in front of me ordered some truffle parmesian fries that looked and smelled amazing despite the small portion size. I mean they're fries. no matter how fancy they are, they're gonna be cheap. but who knows, maybe they'll be good enough to warrant another star. Though I still think that the price might keep them from being the tops.

A worthy addition to Cleveland's excellent ice cream shoppe reportoire."}
{"text":"Love the ice cream, didn't try the fries yet but will definitely be back, finally an ice cream place with in walking distance"}
{"text":"FINALLY! The Eastside has somewhere to go late-night on the weekend. And what would I ever want more than ice cream or french fries after a night out? Hmm I know...BOTH!

I'm what you would call a chocoholic. Admitting it is the first step right? Well, if Sweetie Fry's Deep Chocolate flavor is wrong, I don't wanna be right. It is just out of this world. And, what's that you tell me? I get a sweetie scoop too? Well, don't mind if I do because I also happen to be a big bacon fan and the Maple Bacon flavor with REAL bacon bits in it is the perfect top off on a scoop of Deep Chocolate.

Now the french fries. You can't really go wrong with french fries, but you're definitely in for a treat if you're having gourmet french fries. Three different styles, multiple toppings and tasty dipping sauces mean that there's a combo for everyone.

And guess what else? Sweetie Fry has dog treats in a jar on the counter! So bring your four-legged friend along with you! I know where to take the dog for a walk now!

The owner, Keith Logan, is obviously very passionate about making people smile (umm hello, he picked pretty much the happiest career in the world). He was so friendly and just a cool guy. I will be back on the reg because there is not a single bad thing about this place in my opinion."}
{"text":"Personally, I don't think my review really counts, as they are always hopping.  I hate the selection,  Ice Cream and Fries.  There isn't one healthy thing in there.  But the staff is friendly and knowledgable about their products, even though my cariologist would scold me for eating here.  To me a fry is a fry.  Artery clogging.  But the rest of America isn't worried about this... Slow service at times"}
{"text":"IF you're looking for relatively unique and equally tasty ice cream, this is your place.  If you want to end a meal with salt and sweet treats, this is your place.  The ice cream is made fresh daily, the fries are made fresh to order with homemade dipping sauces, and the enjoyment of these things is pure and delicious.  The staff is patient, attentive, and nice.  They sell pints, but I think I would prefer if they sell gallons of this deliciousness.

Must try the strawberries n' cream and the apple pie ice creams."}
{"text":"Came to this place the other night with my wife on a swing through the East side.  I had been here before and liked it in a 4 star kind of way.  Service was nice although she didn't offer to see if my wife wanted to taste different flavors.  We got the sweet potato fries which were thin, salty and tasty but were disappointed by the grittiness of the ice cream.  Overall it was ok but if ice cream is going to be half your menu then it better be fantastic.  Jenny's is better in my book."}
{"text":"A trip to Sweetie-Fry is a fun treat. Great selection of icecreams, and a nice vibe. The icecream is not as perfect as Jeni's, but it's still delicious."}
{"text":"Great little spot, friendly service and outstanding food(fries & ice cream)
Recommendation: Parmesan truffle oil fries and pepperoni pizza fries. AMAZING!!!"}
{"text":"Ice cream...amazing! Fries....very good!

Upon coming into the restaurant, we were greeted with attentive service by the owner and an employee who was working there. They encourage free samples on the ice cream...and I indulged. The goat cheese and honey was fantastic, and the peanut butter/chocolate was great. I ordered the goat cheese and there was a \"sweetie scoop\" of peanut butter/chocolate on top. This is a small scoop of another flavor on top of the one you ordered.

The waffle fries were tasty. Cooked to order. I had the masala dipping sauce, which was bomb dot com. My friend had the parmesan and truffle oil, which I sampled and enjoyed thoroughly

They have a wonderful atmosphere, the restaurant is on a small corner and you can see everything that goes on in the kitchen."}
{"text":"I am a FRENCH FRY FIEND. I love love love french fries and any fried potato variety.

I was a bit surprised with a small shop with this concept of french fries and ice cream.  The shop is small with maybe 4 tables total, the setup is comparable to 

The fries are perfect on their own with nice crunch on the outer shell with a soft, mashed potato texture on the inside and just the right amount salt.  My mouth is already watering as I write this.  You have your choice of 3 styles: shoestring, sweet potato shoestrings, WAFFLE FRIES (I love waffle fries), and wait for it.... FUNNEL CAKE FRIES.

Their dipping sauces will put the french fries over the top with various choices and \"gourmet toppings\"!!  Their choices include sauces like lime chile curry, vanilla icing for the funnel cake fries, barbeque, tiki masala curry etc. (The shoestrings are a bit better for dipping into the sauces.). 

Their gourmet varieties are french fry servings for two- with pepperoni pizza fries, Parmesan and truffle fries, chilli cheese fries, etc.  I can't wait to get their pizza fries (my arteries are slowly clogging at the thought of it).  

Their fries are a bit pricey ($4.85 for a regular and $5 something for a large plain fry), but definitely worth a try.  The sauces are $.85 each.

I have not yet tried their ice cream or funnel cake fries, but that will be for my next visit, after my double bypass."}
{"text":"So, we have craft beers, right?
Well, now, we have a place for craft ICE CREAMS:)

Sweetie Fry, on Lee Road in Cleveland Heights, is a neat little corner spot full of tasty. When I stopped by, I'd only heard that the owner had studied ice cream making abroad, and had brought his \"mystical knowledge\" to the states to try his wares on the masses...

Lucky for us:)

Firstly, I was greeted warmly by the owner and his sole staff member, who showed me the options available. After some debate, I decided to indulge a secret whim...I got the maple-bacon. Yep, and this isn't your fakey soft-serve spiked with syrup and a few bacon bits, no...

This was tasty, fresh, and he even added MORE bacon at request. In addition, for free if you like, you can get a \"sweetie scoop\" on top, which is a decent sized sample of another flavor. I picked the Pumpkin Cheesecake, which was so VERY cheesecakey, you'd be hard pressed to know the difference between an actual slice. He had a variety of other flavors from fruity to chocolate-peanut-buttery, all of which looked very tasty:)


The fries are great too; simple, fried up fresh in a light oil, and served with a variety of sauces (I heartily recommend the Marsala, for that french-fried East Indian experience:)

The parking is limited to street or a nearby lot, but it's worth it. The seating is also small, but as you would expect for a treasure like this, it's small, intimate and cozy. For a snack, an indulgence, and just a nice spot for that ice cream fix, give Sweetie Fry a try...oh, and next time, I'm bringing my Sweetie with me:))"}
{"text":"I absolutely adore this place, especially the concept of the sweetie scoop (a teeny cute free scoop of a flavor you want to try, but not buy..yet). The small metal spoons they use as testing spoons is also a plus (no harm to the environment!)

Their flavors are very original and taste so creamy and smooth. I especially like the goat cheese and honey flavor, but it may be a little strong for other people. The cheesecake flavor is also a must try. 

I have been here many times for ice cream, but have only ever had the fries twice. I tried the pizza fries and the truffle fries. I love that they mixed the flavor of the truffle with something as ordinary as french fries. These are definitely my favorites. It may sound gross, but a small dip of ice cream on the fries just pairs so well. 

The pricing is a little steep however, but I think worth the taste."}
{"text":"This place is so amazing. Gourmet ice cream and fries = a WINNING combination.

We came here on a Sunday evening at around 9pm, and the owner was still around. He is the nicest man! Apparently, he is a corporate man-turned-ice cream specialist. He gave us all free samples to try his different gourmet ice creams. They are very hearty and creamy and good. With any scoop of ice cream, you also get a little free \"sweetie scoop\", which is a tiny little scoop of any flavor you like. That in itself deserves a 5.

And the fries.... I love me some fries. First of all, if you order the entree fries, they come in a giant basket smothered in amazing toppings. We had the chili cheese fries.. drool. My friend had parmesan and truffle fries... also good! The pizza fries were a little on the intense side.

You can also order different dipping sauces for the fries. My recommendation... get the masala curry one. Who knew that curry and fries could go so well together?? 

Finally, the sweet potato fries are really, really really good.

Go to sweetie fry!"}
{"text":"The kid behind the counter,  the guy in back, the parmesan truffle fries, the butter marsala sauce...Holy awesomeness"}
{"text":"You can tell how great a place is by the line outside. And let me tell you, the 10 times I've been here, there has always been a line in front of Sweetie Fry. 

This place is one of a kind! I love their unique ice cream flavors, like goat cheese honey walnut, french toast, & maple bacon. All of which are freakin delicious! Btw, if you pair the french toast with maple bacon, it's like a breakfast but in ice cream form! How cool is that?

 The fries from here are also pretty freakin awesome. I've tried the garlic parmesan fries before and have not forgotten about the dish since. 

I definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"One of my new favorite places in Cleveland! Great to stop by during hot afternoon runs because they have a dog water bowl outside - then I come back after for a treat for me! Love the sweety scoop because you get a bonus flavor! A unique spot that I hope sticks around. Definitely check it out!"}
{"text":"Pretty sure most people won't complain about the size of an ice cream scoop but holy obesity, Sweetie Fry...can you tone it down a little?  Other than that, inventive flavors (had the banana, with a \"baby scoop\" of peanut butter, while my husband had the cookies and cream hot fudge sundae) and while I didn't try the fries I looooove the quirky combination of the two.  Also, the baby scoop is a genius idea.  Let people know what they're missing so they'll just want more."}
{"text":"The shop is cute and has a local feel, and you can watch ice cream being made behind a glass wall, which is neat.

All of the ice cream flavors sound great, except that they were out of approximately 5-6 of the maybe 20 flavors offered. We sampled most everything and the flavors were good, but the ice cream is icy and has a weird mouth-feel. When it melts, you can taste the heavy cream and butter fat. Not great ice cream, but not terrible either. The hot fudge tastes homemade.

We did not try the fries, and again, they were out of pretty much everything except their regular fries. We will go back again to sample the fries. All in all, just an okay experience."}
{"text":"Fries and ice cream ... Homemade and great ... Awesome concept"}
{"text":"The fries are crisp and very large portioned. The pineapple upside down ice cream tasted exactly like the cake. Def a fan :)"}
{"text":"This place is straight fire.  The ice cream is amazing.  I had the New York Cheesecake topped with Honey and Walnuts; wow did it taste so good.  One of my friends had the funnel cake fries which were also excellent.  Very unique ice cream flavors that are decently priced.  Excellent service.  The best ice cream I've had in the Cleveland area thus far.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"We happened upon this place while in the area for dinner. It is new to the area and was delicious. They have a great blend of unique and classic flavors, so it will appeal to the adventurous and traditional ice cream eaters. The owner was especially nice and let us taste different flavors. 

We didn't get to try the fries (to full from dinner) but what a delish combo, sweet and salty. Yum! Worth the money, we paid less than $5 to share."}
{"text":"Their chicken parm fries are AMAZING. Really great chicken tenders with marinara and cheese on a bed of French fries. I can never get enough! Ice cream is tasty and creamy. Lots of interesting flavors. Also, all the kids who work here are just awesome!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times, but this is the first time that I am reviewing.  My daughter's and I visited Sweetie Fry this past weekend.  The line was out the door (good sign), but the wait wasn't too bad.   I think that they could have used more help.  There was only one person dishing up ice cream and a cashier who, I thought was inappropriately dressed to cashier, so I definitely wouldn't have expected her to help dish up ice cream.  She had on a strapless romper (shorts) and sandals.  Anyway, I opted for the strawberry cheesecake which consisted of cheesecake ice cream and strawberry sauce on top.   For my Sweetie scoop, I chose the sour cream strawberry, which reminded me of a sorbet....tangy, but good.  The cheesecake ice cream was good too.  My daughters enjoyed their choices, as well....salted caramel, I think.   I have yet to try the fries but will sometime in the near future.  All-in-all great concept.   Just a thought, maybe have the staff wear logo'd t-shirt that is also available for customer purchase/promotion."}
{"text":"I was pretty excited to see what the restaurant would do to turn fries into an entrees but was a little underwhelmed with the outcome.  Maybe it's just what I ordered but it seems like there's be something else to try besides just adding some cheese or a chicken tender.

I could see going back again to find out, if for no other reason than to get another ice cream, which was delicious."}
{"text":"No complaints. The chicken parmesan fries were great and the French toast ice cream. I will be going back. They should consider milkshakes."}
{"text":"Had the parm and truffle oil, and bacon and cheddar fries. Both were quite good. 

Also ordered the apple pie ice cream with a \"baby scoop\" of the peanut butter and jelly on top. The ice cream was very, very good. I would recommend ordering a small or kid's portion on the ice cream because the flavors are a bit overwhelming (read: sweet) and a larger portion can be overkill."}
{"text":"Wow! What a great find. We got the pizza fires/ bacon cheese fries and funnel fries. They were all amazing. I think the funnel fries are a must for anyone. They were melt in your mouth amazing! Great services and such a cute building."}
{"text":"So sad to learn of Sweetie Fry closing. This was one of the quirkier joints that I was proud to have in my neighborhood. I mean... who else serves gourmet fries with handcrafted ice cream? Seriously!? The fries were \"impossibly good\" and the ice cream was creative. Keith's artisan skills really came through with some of the off the wall flavors like strawberries with sour cream, goat cheese, and maple bacon. They were really good. On their last day, I decided to stop by 15 mins before they closed and snatch up a couple of pints of whatever they had left. Got some Turkish Coffee and Coconut. I was VERY disappointed...



... while I was eating it when I realized that it would be the very last time I'd be enjoying this treat from Sweetie Fry. I really hope Keith just takes some time off to regroup, draw up a new plan, and come back even stronger some time soon. It is businesses like this that shape the unique characters of our neighborhoods and we need them to succeed! Hope to see you again in the future, Sweetie Fry!"}
{"text":"I'm not quite sure what the hoopla is for this place.  It was okay.  We started with the Parmesan & Truffle Oil Fries and thought they were fine.  Nothing great and we've certainly had better.  We then tried the French Toast and Key Lime ice cream.  I did like the French Toast, but the Key Lime was way too tart and it was almost too hard to eat.

If you're in the area and want to grab some ice cream, definitely stop by, but I wouldn't go out of my way to make the trip."}
{"text":"To start, we are ice cream lovers.  After reading the story on the website about the journey to start sweetie fry, we were very excited to try it.

The ice cream wasn't bad, but it didn't live up to what we were expecting.  It wasn't creamy and actually had a more icy taste.  Flavors are okay, but nothing exciting.  It was average ice cream, and not worth the money. Needless to say, we will be saving our weekend ice cream trips for somewhere else."}
{"text":"I sat next to a mom on a plane who was rationalizing with her daughter in the adjacent row that if she would hold out on the in-flight snack purchases, they would go to Sweetie Fry  that night after the plane landed.   I figure if the power of the place was enough for a kid to wait through a 5 hour flight for, it must be special, so I asked and was filled in on the power of this Sweetie Fry.

We came in around 3:30 on a Saturday, and the place was packed.   I honestly think that must not be normal as it took over 30 minutes just to get an order of fries.   Every seat in the place was taken, and all but two seats were people hungrily waiting for their fry plate.


My husband had an ice cream and thought it was average to above average, but he's an ice cream snob.   We split a large fry three ways with the dipping sauces, and the butter masala was the only sauce that was noteworthy."}
{"text":"I really want to love this place because I always love to support local businesses but I just feel it's overrated and just not that good. the ice cream is too sweet and the fries to salty. The concept of this place is amazing and the interior is very cheque and creative but the food didn't wow me at all."}
{"text":"OMG. The ice cream is so unbelievably awesome here. You have to try the french toast. Its so good. The ingredients are all natural. Very clean and warmly decorated. Service is outstanding. Oddly enough they serve French fries too. An odd combination but so many unique varieties. This is such an original concept. I'll be back again and again."}
{"text":"I really do not know what you could dislike about this place. Delicious ice cream with a range of types. The french fries are also really good, and they are always coming up with something new to do with them."}
{"text":"I'm sure it's fairly rare for ice cream or fries to not be delicious, but Sweetie Fry makes both of them perfectly!

First of all, this place doesn't smell like a fryer at all, which is very important to me. I hate going somewhere and feeling like I can't go anywhere else without washing my hair first.

The fries are great - we tried the pizza fries and the waffle fries with a variety of dipping sauces. I preferred the waffle fries to the regular-cut pizza fries, but the pizza fries were covered in cheese.. so maybe it's a tie. The dipping sauces were all really good, but my favorite (and probably the table's overall favorite since it was completely gone at the end) was the something-chipotle sauce. Yum!

I tried the maple bacon ice cream with a sweetie scoop of the goat cheese ice cream, and both were amazing! In the end I kind of wished I had gotten the goat cheese ice cream with a sweetie scoop of maple bacon, but I'm sure I'll have plenty more opportunities. =)

The service was super super friendly, and I love the way this place is decorated. The fact that Sweetie Fry is only ten minutes away from my apartment might mean trouble for me..!"}
{"text":"Yup, it's the crazy-genius fries & ice cream combo place.

The parmesan-truffle fries were great.  Other places offer fries with truffle oil & parmesan cheese, but I think these are the best I've had.  The fries themselves are really good, plenty of fluffy, freshly grated parm, and really aromatic truffle oil.

The ice cream?  It's excellent.  Great mouthfeel, powerful flavors, and really well-executed.  Turkish coffee was literally like a creamy frozen cup of turkish coffee (grounds included).  Mmmmm."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, amazing fries and even better ice cream. The owner talked to everyone and was open to suggestions. The place is small, but that's part of the charm."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Very nice, relaxed environment to just chill and eat, and great staff too. You walk in, ask to taste whatever flavors you'd like, and they'll give you a small spoon of that ice cream. Tasting spoons are metal: +1 for environment. Also, when you get your ice cream, you get an extra mini-scoop of any other flavor you'd like, so you can try more! 

I ordered the pumpkin pie ice cream (includes graham cracker crust) with a mini-scoop of ginger ice cream on top. BOTH WERE ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS. 

The pumpkin was well flavored, not cloyingly sweet; if anything, there was a little too much cinnamon, but it wasn't that big of a problem. The ginger was also delicious. It was almost fruity in taste, but very gingery without the heat. 

We also ordered sweet potato fries. These were shoestring-like and very good. There's a sauce and water station to wash down your yummies. The cup of ice cream looked small to me, but it was REALLY filling... maybe because the ice cream was dense? We chilled for a long time after finishing our food, but the staff didn't kick us out even though they were already in the process of closing up. I'd definitely go back! And try the maple bacon next time. 

Don't remember how much it was, but definitely less than $5 for ice cream, if not half that price."}
{"text":"I am a fan! What a smart idea - Fries and Ice cream.  Waffle fries, might I add! Or sweet potato fries, if that's what you fancy.

The dipping sauces are great.  I tried the Indian Masala and the Curry Lime.  Both were amazing, though I actually think the Curry Lime beat out the Indian Masala by just a tad.  Waffle fries were okay by itself.  Fried to a nice crisp, but the sauces definitely made it outstanding.

This place reminds me of Pomme Frites in NY.  So happy to find a replacement in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"Dropped in here for some dessert on a Saturday night.  Place was pretty busy during our visit.  All members of our party got some ice cream, and were thoroughly impressed.  The ice cream is very rich, and clearly made with quality ingredients.  They even add a sweetie (small) scoop on top of any flavor you choose.  Before we left, we were amazed watching one of the employees making some caramel.

Very curious about the various fry baskets, so will have to come back to check those out."}
{"text":"Love the vibe - cute, friendly, local - what an awesome way to spend a leisurely Friday evening :)

ice cream x fries is an interesting combination, and makes for great contrast. 
Waffles fries were ok, the Indian Marsala dipping sauce was the highlight. My (Indian) friend said it tasted familiar... like home :) and fries with siracha was my awesome discovery of the day! - glad they had that where the ketchup and stuff are.

Ice cream flavors were adventurous, the crunchiness of the bacon bits was what made my maple bacon ice cream worth it - wish there were more bacon bits though. and the tiny baby tasting scoop (they had a name for that?) on top - what a great idea to offer this as a standard. I might have to get the goat cheese or the strawberry sour cream next time :)

Saw them add oreos to make the cookies n cream ice cream - love seeing food prep in action. 

Portion sizes are big.. for a snack, but I can't justify myself eating ice cream and fries for dinner haha... now i'm left with choices to make - ice cream or fries for my next weekend snack? and who's up for sharing my fries?

(btw, props to sweetie fry for making me bit the bullet and write this - I just couldn't decide, for the last few months, which place to start my yelp reviewing journey with...)"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try sweetie fry since I moved to the area back in December. Unfortunately they keep later hours as most people probably don't want just ice cream and French fries until later in the day. Every time I wanted to go it was too early.

Yesterday's weather was good enough for a stroll down lee so after a lovely dinner at Lopez we decided to walk on over to sweetie fry.

I am so glad we did! I ordered the cookies and cream with hot fudge. Their ice cream is incredible. I think that it's my favorite ice cream now. $3.75 for a cup!!

Will return!"}
{"text":"Fries and Ice Cream, that is a delicious combo and they do them both very well. It's safe to say these are two of America's favorite foods and why not combine them both into a little restaurant? Great idea!

The fries have several topping choices, like big toppings smothered all over. It will fill you up for sure, does a good job on the overall quality as well. They are accompanied by your choice of dipping sauces, make sure you get a few, it is worth it..  

The ice cream is rich, really impressed with it. I would suggest trying a few flavors at a time, they all are worth trying.

Overall great experience here, friendly staff, great food, and free temp tattoos, love it."}
{"text":"Ok, a little indulgence can be fun.  Two fun, indulgent foods, ice cream and french fries, brought together in one place.  Add exceptional service and quality of product.  Add a fun environment.  You have Sweetie Fry.  Great place to go after school or work, just to chill out and have fun.  Wish them success."}
{"text":"Sweet, happy place in town. I live the tiny 'sweetie scoop' you can add to your order. What a great treat!"}
{"text":"This place is truly amazing.  It's really an absurd concept:  a store that sells fries and ice cream.  And yet, it's absolutely brilliant.  Moreover, the food is delicious!  I haven't really tried the plain fries, but I have had the parmesan truffle oil fries, the chicken parmesan fries, and the gorgonzola/hot sauce fries, which were all fairly tasty in their own ways.  Admittedly, the chicken and fry combinations seem a little more like chicken fingers that just happen to be on top of fries, but I really can't complain since it's tasty :D  The ice cream is excellent quality, and they seem to switch up their flavors fairly frequently.  They let you sample whatever flavors you want, and they'll also add a small extra scoop of any flavor you want on top of your ordered scoop of ice cream.  The staff are all really sweet as well  Finally, this place is open to the odd hours of the night!!!  That never happens in Cleveland!  Total win!!!!"}
{"text":"Um, if you don't like french fries and ice cream we can't be friends. I love coming here because I feel cool supporting a local business-and-all. The ice cream tastes homemade and the flavors are intriguing. My favorites will forever be the strawberries and sour cream, maple bacon, and goat cheese (because I will eat anything with goat cheese. try me.). I usually get a scoop of my favorite flavor plus a sweetie scoop (it's a wee wittle cutesy scoop i.e. adorable) of something new (like Basil! or Black pepper!). Oh...I almost forgot to mention the fries. You can't go wrong with the pepperoni pizza fries or if you're feeling extra naughty try the funnel cake fries."}
{"text":"I was very concerned when I heard I'd be moving about four blocks away from this place. I'd only heard of it, but how can french fries and ice cream be bad? It can't. And it's especially delicious at Sweetie Fry.

I've somehow managed to only go here twice in the two months I've lived  nearby, but every single morsel I've eaten here has been amazing. The dipping sauces for the fries are delicious (Indian curry masala is my fave!) and the ice cream flavors are unique and delicious. I love the \"sweetie scoop\" -- a tiny scoop on top of your primary flavor - because it allows you to try another flavor you're afraid to get an entire serving of.

The only bad things: 1. This place gets really crowded, especially on weekends, and 2. I live too close."}
{"text":"One note, I do think they changed their late-night hours but I never went their late-night although I thought about it a few times...

So outside of this change this place is fantastic. The ice creams are out of this world. I can't believe how real and flavorful ice cream can taste. They completely succeeded there.

The fries are to die for. Both the sauces and the actual fries as well as the funnel cake fries are so darn good I crave them as a meal. 

My husband and I go there in the afternoons or on the weekend sometimes with our dog and the staff is always good about making sure we are comfortable or our dog has enough water or a treat, even though we're seated outside! 

Stuff like that touch of kindness and attention to your customer topped with quality food and a wonderful location give this joint our instant and loyal approval."}
{"text":"I love this place. Love. Love. Love.

The extremely helpful and patient ice cream scooper/order taker let us sample as many flavours as we want. It is hard to decide when every flavour tastes amazing. Finally, we decided to delay our decision and order fries instead. We got the Parmesan - Truffle Oil fries. In the words of a 14 year old girl - O M G. They were fantastic. The Parmesan was finely shredded and distributed well so we had Parmesan flavour till the very last fry in the basket. We got 2 dipping sauces (curry mayo and tikka masala sauce maybe?) and while they didn't go with the fries (our fault), they were excellent as well.

I ended up getting the French Toast ice cream and it was superlative. A close second was the Chilli Chocolate ice cream. Not for the faint of heart (or spice tolerance rather), the smooth chocolate ended with a lovely warm bite.

I took off one star because of 2 things:
1) limited seating. extremely limited seating.

2) the slowness in service due to only one person running the front. He was handing out samples, answering questions, taking orders and cashing customers out. as great of a job as the guy did, they really need to hire another person for the front to distribute the load. Especially since the space is tiny and a line forms quickly, making the space feel cramped.

I am not familiar with Cleveland as a city but side street this place was located on was a little scary. When we left, we felt unsafe as it looked like a fight was about to break out among a large group of men. However, this is not the restaurant's fault - just a heads up if you are planning to head out there late.

Sweetie Fry is definitely on my list of places to eat at when I come back!"}
{"text":"My sister, brother in law, niece, nephew and myself decided to be bad and go here for dinner.  Fries and ice cream for dinner is just necessary sometimes.

We expected to still be hungry after, but we were definitely not.  The entree chili cheese fries were the best I've ever had.  They don't give you a fork though, which I find odd.  That's not something you should have to ask for when you order something like that.  

We also got 2 large fries with different sauces.  The curry-flavored sauces were not my faves.  The BBQ mayo was amazing.  All in all, their assortment is not as exciting as some of the other frites places I've been, but I'm also spoiled in that department and I love my condiments.

The ice cream is the real treat.  My recommendation?  Get something you'd normally never try.  The goat cheese flavor was savory and satisfying.  The key lime tasted like I was eating pie.  The strawberry sour cream was creamy, sour, and fresh.

I wouldn't go back for a meal replacement, but I am definitely going back to try the maple bacon ice cream (it was out when we were there :-P)"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places for a late night treat. I haven't had any of the entree fries, but I have had the regular sweet potato fries and they are pretty fantastic. The ice cream is really the draw for me. It's one of the few places I've actually wanted to get the plain vanilla because it's THAT good. I love the \"sweetie scoop\" idea so you can try out small portions of other flavors. Also, the salted caramel sauce is really good."}
{"text":"Sweetie Fry, you are my sweetheart!

I've never had the fries here, so I can't review those, but OH THAT ICE CREAM!!! I don't know how they do it, but Sweetie Fry makes the creamiest, richest, most flavorful ice cream! They always have unique, unexpected flavors, which turn out to be surprisingly good, like cilantro-lime (thought this combo was only for gucamole? Think again!) and goat cheese-honey! My favorite flavors are peanut butter, which has a great, intense peanut butter flavor, and the chocolate raspberry marmalade. Just thinking about them is making my mouth water!

The staff is always so patient, allowing you to sample however many flavors you want (which is a total necessity given that their flavors are sometimes outside-of-the-box). I appreciate that they take the time to prepare the bite with all the toppings listed on the menu (like pouring carmel and peanuts over your sample of goat cheese ice cream) so that you get an accurate impression of the flavor. I also LOVE the fact that you get a small \"sweetie scoop\" on top of your order, so you can test a new flavor out (to prepare yourself for your next order, of course!).

Definitely give Sweetie Fry's ice cream a try if you are in the area!"}
{"text":"Great ice cream/french fry place near home! I've been here twice now and I love this little shop.  

The service is always great.  They have a variety of not so standard flavors that are all really yummy.  I've had the NY cheesecake, Mango Sorbet, and Strawberries&Sour Cream.  All awesome!  I shared the NY cheesecake but I can see how it would get very rich after you eat half of it.  Don't forget to get your \"sweetie scoop\", a tiny scoop of any other flavor for free! I also tried the waffle fries with the masala sauce-- soo good! And they also have different hot sauces so you can make your own sauce.  

Can't wait to go back and try the sweet potato fries and funnel cake fries!"}
{"text":"On more than one occasion, I have lamented and wondered at the lack of an ice cream parlour in the Coventry - Lee area. Especially one that serves flavors outside of the 'Vanilla, Chocolate, Superman' (VCS) spectrum. There's UDF but that's definitely bang in the middle of the VCS spectrum. Then there's Tommy's where the milk shakes are pretty amazing but sometimes, you just want an ice cream cone. Or two. In Sweetie Fry's case, I'll take four...please.

Anywho, all the lamenting came to an abrupt end on July 2nd when Sweetie Fry - an ice cream cart located outside Phoenix Coffee on Coventry Rd -opened for business. And yesterday, I finally had myself some Sweetie Fry ice cream.

Sweetie Fry sells hand crafted ice creams and sorbets. On the blackboard menu yesterday: Maple and bacon, cookies and cream, chocolate, vanilla bean, mint chocolate chunk, peanut butter, strawberry sour cream, lime sorbet, mango sorbet. 

We tried - maple and bacon ice cream (mmm..mm...mmmm - there's a chance that it will become husband's weekend 'brunch' staple) and strawberry sour cream. One taste of the strawberry sour cream and I was hooked. That's what I wanted. I knew it. And then the ice cream girl opened the freezer and I saw the mango sorbet. It was the golden yellow color of a perfectly ripe mango (a perfectly ripe alphonso mango to be exact). I had to get it. I did. It tasted like a perfectly ripe alphonso mango. It was AWESOME! *drool* Friend got some peanut butter and some chocolate ice cream. The peanut butter tasted like real peanut butter and the chocolate was decadent. 

While we were swooning over our respective ice creams, the ice cream girl said something that included the words 'soon...open...Cedar Lee'. Wait...that's a five minute walk from my house!! Hurrah!! Can't hardly wait...

As of now, find Sweetie Fry on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/SweetieFry"}
{"text":"I've only tried the ice cream, never the French fries.  And it left me wanting more, and I don't mean that in the good way.  The servings are small.  Like teeny tiny small. And then they top it off with a \"Sweetie\" scoop.  Which is teeny, teeny, tiny small scoop of ice cream.  Are the flavors creative?  Yes.  If you want goat cheese ice cream, this is probably a place you're going to like.  If you like the good old standby's like Rocky Road, Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough, etc., this would not top my list."}
{"text":"The family and I were there this weekend, and loved it.  The fries come out piping hot, fairly large in portion, nicely flavored (not overwhelming), and surprisingly non-greasy.  I don't think the intent is to eat dinner here, but some of the fry orders could easily be confused with a full meal (pepperoni pizza fries, anyone?).

The ice cream is delicious.  Being all hand made, it's surprising to see so many flavors on the menu, which I think regularly changes.  Everything from some standards like Mint Chocolate Chip to the more innovative and interesting like Maple Bacon and Chili Chocolate.  And be sure to ask for a \"sweetie scoop\" on top when you order.  Word of warning: the Chili Chocolate is very good, but the chili is definitely not hidden.  It will come out and bite you late in your tasting (in a good way).  I have to highly recommend the fruit flavored sherbets.  We had mango this trip, and I believe lemon from the Sweetie Fry cart on Coventry.  They're so good, and those are only going to get better and more refreshing as the temperature outside heats up. 

Food was 5 stars, as was the shop and staff.  As such, I almost feel bad leaving a star off for this, but they were out of a number of ice cream and fry types which was a bummer.  Truly a product of their own success and, frankly, who would expect weeks of 75° weather in Cleveland in the middle of March leading to a rush on the ice cream shop?!  Regardless, there was plenty to choose from, and the family and I really enjoyed it and will be back.  Can't wait to see what interesting flavors of ice cream and fries are yet to come.  I'd suggest giving them a ring if it's outside of their posted hours.  For example, Yelp and their web site say 1-10pm on Sunday, but we were there early and found them open."}
{"text":"Visited Sweetie Fry again today, for some ice cream. I was able to taste many of their offerings. This trip, the chocolate was available. Deep, rich chocolate flavor. Creamy! I tried many of the others too. The owner, Keith, is passionate about the ice cream and it shows in the flavor profiles of the ice cream. My staples, mint chocolate chip and chocolate are delicious, the mint being very minty. Although I'm not a fruit person, the key lime was a standout. It is crisp and refreshing, light. Great on a hot summer day. Definitely worth a visit for the ice cream. I did not sample any other items this visit so my review is for the ice cream this time."}
{"text":"Sweetie Fry is great for a quick escape from reality.
I love the atmosphere and the people that work there are really nice.

The ice cream is good, but it's a stretch to say that it's amazing. Same goes for the fries. I think the one way in which they could really improve the place is by adding milkshakes to the menu."}
{"text":"Oh my what a list of flavors this place offers!  Sure it gets busy but what do you expect with a unique establishment such as this? 
The ice cream server was so pleasant and made the experience all the more better when we visited here for our first time. What the heck is a sweetie scoop? Well, they give you a tiny little scoop of another flavor to add on the top of your ice cream! How cool is that? 

I chose the Strawberry and Sour Cream for my main dish and added the Maple Bacon with Waffle as my Sweetie Scoop. Never had anything like this before and it was such a pleasant treat.  Bacon actually tastes good in an ice cream. Who knew?

We will be back soon to try out the fries.  I am definitely looking forward to that!"}
{"text":"The ice cream is artisan and delicious and fries are better than McDonald's, but I don't get the hype - everything is so overpriced! I'd go to Mitchell's for better ice cream, and B Spot for Lola fries. Is the concept of combining ice cream and fries worth the premium price? Not to mention the constant line out of the door!"}
{"text":"You can never go wrong at Sweetie Fry.  This place has an incredible selection of ice cream flavors that range from creative to classic.  My go-to has been their mint chocolate chip, but I've enjoyed every single flavor there so far.  The french toast ice cream and maple bacon flavors taste like they came straight from the breakfast table.

For anyone craving something salty, go for the pizza fries.  They're a cheesy delight and perfect for sharing.

This place has been our go-to for the last year anytime we're craving something sweet.  There's great service, a free Sweetie scoop whenever you treat yourself to a scoop of ice cream, and fantastic weekend hours for late-night snacking."}
{"text":"One of the neatest and sweetest treats you'll find around. Their homemade ice cream is absolutely amazing! Combining french fries and ice cream is one of the most unique desserts you can eat. For some people it might sound a little different, but trust me..Sweetie Fry won't let you down!"}
{"text":"I mean, it's fries.  And ice cream.  How can you go wrong with that? (P.S. No, you do not dip the fries into the ice cream.)

The fries... taste like fries, nothing too special.  What's best about the fries though, is the dipping sauces.  My friends were all over the curry marsala sauce.  The bbq sauce blended well too.

The ice cream was pretty good, and they give a little \"sweetie scoop\" of whatever flavor you want on top of your ice cream order so you can try two flavors at once.  We really liked the mango sorbet."}
{"text":"WOW! Sweetie Fry is serving up some of the best frozen treats in town! They make all of their ice cream in house, from scratch. You can literally see the owner making it. they have an incredible selection of ice creams that are unique, tasty, and of course - creamy! i tasted the french toast, peanut butter fudge, granola, and deep chocolate raspberry marmalade. the salted caramel sauce is incredible!! and the service is tremendous."}
{"text":"Finally, someone put two and two together and came up with the best combination restaurant ever. Ice cream and fries, yes please!

The ice creams here are wonderful. The maple-bacon is syrupy and sweet. The goat cheese with honey and walnuts is wholesome. The mango sorbet is light and refreshing with beautiful color. The key lime pie is sugary, bright and peppered with crumbly pie crust. You're also encouraged to sample any flavor you'd like, and a sweetie-scoop on the top gives you two ice creams to enjoy together. 

The fries still leave a little more to be desired. Sweetie Fry specializes in toppings for your fries, which I think takes away from the joys of a well-salted fry and a sugary swipe of ice cream. The pizza fries are good--just eat them before the cheese cools--and the hamburger fries were pretty much a basket of fries with a deconstructed hamburger dumped on top. Ok, but not what I was hoping for.

Awesome ice cream, ok fries, great way to spend a hot Sunday afternoon."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Great customer service, delicious ice cream and delectable fries! The first time I went there I got a regular deep chocolate with a caramel sweetie scoop...Yum! The second time I got the NY Cheesecake with strawberry mixture in it. That was also good but chocolate was still my favorite. Recently I decided to try the fries and OMG the pepperoni pizza fries are sooo good!! I also got the chocolate chip cookie chunk ice cream and a root beer float. Overload I know but with so many delicious options it really hard to limit yourself.

Each time I went the customer service was on point. They gave me and my friends suggestions and even let us try as many favors as we wanted. Overall Sweetie Fry deserves 5 stars."}
{"text":"What a difference six days and a different employee makes!.

Went back today a few hours earlier than my last visit. I was surprised it wasn't packed on a Saturday (early) evening. It's \"warm\" (about 42 degrees) so I thought it would be hopping. Yet I as able to park right in front and walk right in and order.

I was able to try Key Lime, Peanut Butter and Black Pepper today Yes, Black Pepper ice cream and believe it or not, it was so delicious and spicy and tasted JUST like black pepper but with a decadent, rich sweetness - unreal!

The Key Lime was AMAZING and the Peanut Butter was good, tasted like Reese peanut butter. 

I ordered a large French Toast and I got my little scoop on top this time (without even asking)! I thought perhaps it was because I ordered a large but my friend ordered a regular sized ice cream and received a small scoop as well.

The guy working there today was a TOTAL delight! His name was Michael and he was funny, personable and patient while we tried out our flavors. He suggested that we try the Black Pepper as it was a brand new addition and we're glad we did!

A much better experience so I had to be fair and update."}
{"text":"Carbohydraterie par excellence. The ice cream is fresh and the fries Continental in this friendly neighborhood munchie relief station plucked out of Brooklyn. Kid and hipster friendly."}
{"text":"Stop. I've died and got to heaven. Considering that I would like my last meal on Earth to include ice cream, fries, and some sort of cheese that might be a legit observation. Not only was this place the most ADORABLE shop ever they have GOURMET fries and ICE CREAM. My two favorite food groups. If I had my way, the only two food groups that should really count. 

Went here for a Yelp event and they got me hooked for life. It's a good thing this place is pretty far from me or I would be a) broke and b) gain 100 lbs. The ice cream quality was beyond amazing and had me reminiscent of Jeni's ice cream in Columbus. Not to be outdone the fries were equally amazing and I think that you should try them all. It would be unfair to ask me to choose my favorite. or even just one. :)"}
{"text":"Good location. Great food. okay Ice cream. The fries are better than the ice cream. And it seems when I do want a flavor they are out. I still need to try the funnel fries."}
{"text":"This place is nothing short of fantastic!  We were treated to a variety of delicious delights, from the sweet to the salty and something in between that could very well be described as \"sublime\".
Keith, the proprietor, warmly welcomed us into his establishment and then introduced us to GOURMET FRIES!  The ice cream was also delicious, and served in two generous scoops of each person's choosing.  
We sampled:
Fries: Funnel cake, truffle oil and Parmesan, pizza, bacon and cheddar and regular waffle fries with dipping sauces.  As for ice cream, we enjoyed: cookies and cream, coffee, maple-bacon and s'mores.  All were marvelous.  
We enjoyed ourselves here and most certainly will be back!"}
{"text":"We were coming back from the east side today which never happens so we decided to treat ourselves to Sweetie Fry. I was so excited because the first few times I went I was in loooove with this place and was just dying to get back. 

Unfortunately, I was disappointed. I mean, it isn't bad. It's actually pretty good, but today's experience was just not on par with the past. 

Biggest, almost inexplicable change - NO MORE WAFFLE FRIES!! I cannot understand this. They are just no longer on the menu. These were like angel tears in the form of fries and the reviewers raved about them so I just didn't get it. I asked the kid behind the counter why no more waffles and he said they kept having the waffle fry cutter machine break and it cost too much to fix it. 

Ok, I get it, being a business owner is about making tough choices, but sorry, you've taken away a major plus about your menu. Those waffle fries were SO DAMN GOOD! Total bummer. Also the kid today didn't offer us the little scoop on top of the ice cream as usual. 

The fries were still pretty good, but I was really unimpressed when compared to my previous experiences. What a disappointment. I can see myself going back but no more going out of my way. :("}
{"text":"A place with only French Fries and Ice Cream - what a divine idea!  It's easy to find gourmet ice cream parlors, but gourmet french fries are a new treat!  

I recently visited and was immediately struck by the ambience of the inside.  Although the restaurant is enclosed, it has high ceilings and a pickup window which helped give it a vibe of being outside, particularly close to a fun beach location.  Whether it's the thought of gourmet french fries and ice cream that helped fuel the \"vacation\" vibe, I definitely got a nice break from reality when I walked in.  

I ordered the pizza fries with pepperoni and man were they yummy!  Crispy hand-cut fries seasoned with fresh herbs, perfectly melted cheese and topped with baby pepperonis, all with marinara sauce for dipping.  It was amazing!  I don't know why more pizza restaurants don't convert to serving pizza this way, it was a really inspired!  

This place warrants a visit, whether you order or just enjoy the ambience and drool over the menu while you're there.  No matter your tastes, sweet or savory, Sweetie Fry has something you will enjoy!"}
{"text":"This is our favorite place to go for ice cream. Charming little shop, great servers, and a wonderful variety of creative ice cream flavors. The sweetie scoop is an extra treat on top of your cone or bowl. Love the fact that I can try any flavor before I order. We've never had the fries cause were so addicted to the ice cream but we've heard they're fantastic too. Sweetie Fry has better ice cream and prices than their overrated competition."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS!! I like ice cream, ok ok, it's more like I love ice cream. I tried samples of about half of their ice creams. The employee was very nice and the place was packed. In the end, I got a scoop of vanilla bean and a scoop of key lime. I will be going back."}
{"text":"Why didn't I come here before????  Wonderful in house made ice cream with inventive yummy flavors.  I had the cinnamon ice cream with salted caramel sauce.  It was perfect!  I also tried the chocolate stout and it was fab.  I love that they use real spoons for tastings - no waste.  There portions were proportional with the taste (and calories, I am sure).  I can't wait to try more flavors and order some fries.  Also, the staff was super friendly and knowledgeable.  I couldn't be happier that such a great business moved into the neighborhood."}
{"text":"LOVE!!! Went to Colony for a birthday party this weekend and happened to look across the street on our way to the car. There was a line to street for Sweetie Fry. I REALLY wanted to try it so I made the boy wait with me. I'm not sure there was much choice in the matter -- after a few drinks who doesn't want ice cream .... 

They let you try as many flavors as you want and they are not assholes about it. My boyfriend tried three flavors and they were perfectly happy to oblige. I got Mint Chocolate Chip because, well, it's the best ice cream flavor ever. It was SO GOOD. On top I got a free mini-scoop of whatever flavor I wanted to try. I went with the recommendation and got Strawberries and Sour Cream UM, REALLY?!?!?! I wish I would have tried it first b/c I'm pretty sure I could eat any quantity ever churned. It was so good, creamy, delicious. The flavor was phenomenal. He got the Cookie Dough and was impressed with all the chunky delicious cookie in it. 

Needless to say, we were both VERY VERY happy with the ice cream and I can't wait to go back and try the fries!!!! Well worth the 15-20 min wait."}
{"text":"So good! The crazy kinds of fries they have here are crazy-delicious! And they made their ice cream on site. Yum!"}
{"text":"This place combines two of my favorite things: fries and ice cream.   They do both very well.  The pizza fries are, indeed, very good.  It's a terrific guilty pleasure!"}
{"text":"Fries and ice cream...what an amazing combination.

Went here last night with some friends last night. It's on the corner, and sits along the same road as Phoenix, Stone Oven, etc.

It's a cute little small ice cream shop, with large light bulbs hanging across, and their flavors written on a chalkboard along the wall. There were so many different flavors, ranging from maple bacon, french toast, lemon sherbet, peanut butter fudge, choc marmalade, to even dulce de gorgonzola. 

I ordered the regular size with two different flavors- the coconut and the stout(er) chocolate. They even offered a \"sweetie\" ice cream scoop, which is a mini scoop, so I got the lemon sherbet. Mmmmmm. My friend had the strawberry flavor which was really good as well. 

We got some waffle fries as well, with great sauces- masala curry and  something else. Mmmmm. Waffles and fries. What a great combo.

I liked how this ice cream was super creamy and interesting flavors. My only gripe was that there weren't many flavors where there were things in it to chew? And a tad sweet? But that's ok..the flavors themselves were good and it's a fun concept. The people behind the counter were really awesome to talk to as well.

So go get some sweets at sweetie fry, ftw!"}
{"text":"An absolutely fabulous establishment! Last night I gave the Milk Chocolate Ice Cream with Salty Caramel Sauce a go... and OMG I fell in love. It was sinfully delicious. If you happen to be in the Cedar-Lee Theater District, take a stroll. It is definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"Many many flavors. Love the way they deliver samples. I asked for some flavor that I now forget, but the server scooped a tiny spoonful and even added the extra stuff like a drizzle of honey, topped with some nuts. Great service. Too bad ice cream is still not as great as I would like, but then again, I am not that big of a fan of ice cream. Really did enjoy the strawberry and sour cream flavor. Disappointed with some of the other unique flavors. Ordered pizza fries, which were pretty good. Price is decent; I think a small ice cream and pizza fries ran us around $10."}
{"text":"Great ice cream, delicious fries, great staff, cute shop. Honestly my only complaint is the shop is too small for how many people cram into the place. Even its awesome hours havnt helped it being packed from open to close."}
{"text":"Omg.. The ice cream handed down from the gods. I swear to you this cute little shop does not disappoint when it comes to the ice cream. I love ice cream.. Like seriously and I seriously had a food gasm after tasting their French toast and cookies and cream. The flavors come together perfectly and I truly feel like this is some of the best ice cream in cleveland.

The name of the joint is almost useless.. Because I honestly think the fries are terrible and.. Just.. Blehh. I only tried them twice.. And it just wasn't worth their high prices for some bland gourmet. 

Sometimes I feel like trying the fries out again.. Two flukes could be possible.. I always think how can the ice cream be so good and the fries so terrible???"}
{"text":"I think the maple bacon flavor is a must try, but I'm just not that crazy about all their weird flavors. If you are more of a traditional person like I am, you can try some of their traditional options, but they may not be as striking as their top flavors. This place is also a bit pricey."}
{"text":"I really enjoy their unique ice cream flavor combinations, like maple bacon and french toast. The owner clearly has an eclectic, creative and adventurous palate.  However, the texture of the ice cream has not always been the best...a bit icy.  Not sure what that's about, but it's happened on more than on occasion and that's why I took off two starts  I have not complained, but if this happens again, I will ask for a replacement since perhaps the ice cream is being stored at an inoptimal temperature or something and at those prices, this should be perfect , rich and creamy.  I love the gorgonzola fries and the fries with confectioner's sugar.   The atmosphere is urban and trendy, fun and friendly as are the staff."}
{"text":"Unique collection of carbs. Always busy. Friendly servers"}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place, honestly. As a local I've heard about Sweetie Fry and how amazing it is from many different people...however after going a few times I can say that it is not as great as I had hoped. The food is overpriced, first of all. Sure the ice cream is homemade and the flavors are unique, but not worth the cost by any means. The quality is just okay, not great. The fries are very good but again very pricey. On weekends the place gets crazy crowded and there are only three or four tables inside. 
Overall I just expected more after hearing so much. It is a cute idea and a friendly environment but I think they should bump up the quality of the food if they are going to keep the same prices."}
{"text":"The owner was super generous with food and drink.  I especially loved the goat cheese ice cream (you gotta try it!)."}
{"text":"I've been to Sweetie Fry a few times now and have been underwhelmed. I really wanted to like it, but the flavors just haven't wowed me. The fries were average (tried once) and the ice cream was just ok. 

A nice touch is that you have the chance to try a \"sweetie\" scoop (a tiny scoop) of another flavor on top of your ice cream. 

I'm sure I'll end up giving it another try, but just haven't been impressed thus far. Sorry!"}
{"text":"Wow. The salted caramel ice cream and the goat cheese ice cream. Yum. And if you get some sweet potato fries to do in the ice cream? Even better. 

I'm the kinda person who dips their fries into their Frosty... so when I heard about this place, I thought it was ingenious. 

The two flavors of ice cream that I mentioned above had a great creamy, smooth, consistency. I also tried the French toast ice cream: for that one.. The flavor was spot on but the texture wasn't as perfect as the other two. Now, don't get me wrong, even the French toast was way above what you might get a a grocery store... But of the three flavors I tried, there other two were better. 

Next time I am in the area, I will probably go for some different flavors to try - maybe be more adventurous and try some of the crazy flavors - basil, etc. 

The only thing this place could do better is to be open on Mondays throughout the summer so I could go there after (read during) my husband's softball games!"}
