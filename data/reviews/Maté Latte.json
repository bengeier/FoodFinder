{"text":"Awesome service and and one of the only places I've found to get genuine Yerba Mate in MTL. Alvin was our server and gave the place a fantastic chill and laid back vibe. Will be sure to go back soon."}
{"text":"Yummmmmy !! Just had a wonderful crepe ... Banana Foster and a very good Tortilla soup and sandwich !

Cosy atmosphere , very nice team !! Really appreciate the attention to detail !

Stomachs are full... We are heading to the Pourquoi Pas Espresso Bar on Amherst.... We need an amazing latte to finish this meal !!"}
{"text":"The alfajores are to die for but this café offers a great variety of treasures: Empanadas, torta tricolor, quiche, amazing and creative sandwiches, homemade cookies, cupcakes, etc. All healthy choices that looked fresh out of the kitchen. Everything  looked good and it was hard to choose! Thankfully,  I was served by Alvin, whom sense of humor is amazing and he was very helpful with his suggestions. 

The place seems to be family/friends run by people from the neighborhood. Definitely gives it a \"home\" feeling. Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Walked in an checked out the menu full of waffles and crepes
Also eggs bacon yummy 
But I ordered a fresh baguette with butter 
A delicious cinnamon brioche 
And a macchiato 
All of this was amazing 
Couldn't wait for the next bite 
Get over here and enjoy"}
{"text":"Great neighbourhood cafe, super friendly staff and delicious snacks! Only negative comment, needs some improvement on the wait time..."}
{"text":"I opened a Yelp account just to review that coffee shop.   Been there 3 times, so I did give it a chance (or two!), but I will not go there for a fourth attempt.   The 1st time the coffee was not what we ordered and the server tried to make us take what she brought us and was kind of rude about the whole thing when we insisted on getting what we had ordered in the 1st place.  2nd time, coffee tasted diluted, not good at all for an espresso based drink.  Third time, server was downright rude about us taking our (well behaved) dog on their terrasse.  Apparently, there was a danger of breaking a table if the dog ever went crazy for some unknown reason.  She asked me, in a stern tone, to tie up the leash on the flimsy patio chair instead of the table.  The demand was reasonable, but since we did not appreciate the way it was said, we left before ordering.  There are a lot of good and friendly staffed cafés in NDG, so I will no longer give them my patronage.  I will also tell all my friends who live in my area.  It was that bad."}
{"text":"It's a charming beautiful place and the food is beautiful. Happy I found it as a spot for breakfast any day of the week."}
{"text":"Stayed in Montreal in NDG area and went here for breakfast two days in a row. Had eggs and bacon the first day and they kindly refilled my coffee without having to ask. Second day I was hungover and one of the girls suggested a Mate Latte (a green tea concoction with honey) which was nice. Had the waffles on my second round and it was wonderful. Friends enjoyed their crepes.

Good atmosphere, friendly staff and the owner Andrea has great taste in music. Really nice and family friendly place to chill."}
{"text":"Had the pleasure of visiting this cafe/bistro last weekend while visiting Montreal. Excellent coffee, with free refills, tasty muffins coupled with exceptional service. The food offerings are delicious, judging by the reaction of customers. Very unpretentious surroundings with pleasant and friendly staff. It is not often that you will find a cafe/bistro where the staff will actually bring your coffee to your table, but at the Mate Latte they do and with warm smiles. Staff are always in motion taking away used utensils and making sure that customers are satisfied. Congrats to the Manager, Andrea on having a service oriented team, good food and excellent coffee.

{"text":"Hmmm... we had breakfast here this morning, and yes it was absolutely tasty and the staff were super friendly... but I can't give it 5 stars:

It doesn't feel like a schmancy-fancy place, but the prices seem a little steep for what you get... my husband had the \"waffles\" and I had the \"crepes\", but what they really should have said is \"waffle\" and \"crepe\". Delicious, but not a speck of anything else on the plate -- no little orange slice, no potatoes, just a plain ole waffle and a crepe. 

I also find it hard to order on the spot (ie at the counter, before you sit down)... I'd much rather sit and have a coffee and contemplate the options... but that's my own mistake for not reading the reviews here first!!

I do give them points for taste though -- the waffle was light and fluffy, the crepe was delicious -- and the tzatziki, MMMMM. We ordered a side of potatoes for $2 extra and they came with the most delicious tzatziki dip ever. I was dipping my crepe in the tzatziki at the end just to get the most of it :) 

With one cup of coffee and one water our bill was $27 -- not saying that's outrageous, just that for almost $30 I'd like my breakfast to be a little more rounded out. Not sure we'd go back."}
{"text":"One of my favorite hidden treasures in Montreal! Such a great energy there! The place is family owned with friends helping so everyone is always so relaxed and happy which really rubs off on the patrons. The food is amazing, always fresh and different. Definitely try the Mate Latte, so good! Worth checking out and coming back. Thumbs way up, I havent found anything else like it."}
{"text":"Really chill place, friendly vibe, comfortable and accommodating. Had a super breakfast - great quality bacon, thick home-made whole wheat bread and extremely tasty coffee - among other things. Looking forward to making my way through their menu and just enjoying the atmosphere."}
{"text":"A great place to get a monster (sized) cookie and a latte and sit outside to people-watch. I was so impressed with the friendliness and great service of this place that I wanted to write a glowing review -- but was delighted to see that many others have already done so. I liked how there are unique things to nosh on at this cafe -- empanadas and alfajores (which were both delicious) to name a few. Seeing that so many people also loved the service and food here gives me more confidence that our positive experience was not just a fluke, and I look forward to returning!"}
{"text":"I love these guys! The place feels homey, the service is super friendly and the food is all home made and yummy. The only problem with coming here is that I never want to leave!"}
{"text":"This was the best breakfast I had in Montreal! Absolutely delicious, healthy, and super affordable. The barista was soooo helpful, and accommodated all your needs and wants. If you are picky, they've got patience. They had almond Milk lattes. Their hot breakfast, so delicious, and did I mention their waffles!!!! It's the cutest little nook. You will be surprised!"}
{"text":"Mate Latte is a great little cafe situated in ndg.  It has excellent food, great service and very friendly staff, I would highly recommend it to everyone!"}
{"text":"Charming little cafe in NDG.

Breakfast menu includes a a selection of waffles and crepes, baked goods, and \"typical\" breakfast items (e.g., bacon, eggs, toast, potatoes). We went around 10:30 on a weekday and they were also starting to put lunch items into the display case, including some amazing looking salads, wraps, and paninis. I was looking for something breakfast-y and sweet, so I ordered the Bananas Foster waffle and a latte.

The waffle was perfectly cooked with a crisp exterior and a soft and chewy interior. It was topped with a mess of bananas, warm buttery brown sugar sauce, and vanilla ice cream that, although nothing special on its own, melted into the butter-brown sugar sauce to form a next level creation. Yum. My latte had a bit too much foam for my liking, but was otherwise very good.

Service was friendly and casual. Prices were very reasonable. The decor was eclectic and inviting. I would definitely come back... Although I think I'd be torn between getting the bananas Foster again or to trying some of the other things on the menu =)"}
{"text":"Super charming cafe, very warm and welcoming place, staff is so nice and make an effort to get to know their regular customers, which is not something you see often in Montreal. Reasonably priced and pretty good food with a lot of fun throwback music. I like the beef empanadas (pretty authentic) and the alfajores (sugar cookie with dulce de leche- very generous with the dulce de leche). If you live near ndg I highly recommend this place :)"}
{"text":"I've been there countless of times! The coffee is great, the staff is friendly, and most of all, the food is delicious!"}
{"text":"Just moved to the Deeg, looking for a good coffee, found Maté latte, and glad I did, I asked for a macchiato and the charming lady suggested I try a cortada, (cortana?) can't remember, best coffee I've had in a while, coupled with a sublime meat empanada, (like a South American meat pasty) perfect combo of salt and sweet. Thanks for making my day Maté latte! Looking forward to trying other delicious looking items on the menu!"}
{"text":"I went there twice to get a decaf coffee but they were out so I could not sample their coffee.  My brother said their chai tea latte was the best he's had in  Montreal (he tried about 15 different places).    The place is good for working, the wifi is good and reliable."}
{"text":"Every so often, relying on Yelp reviews doesn't always pan out. This is one of those instances.

Came here for a Saturday brunch with the boo. Visually, the place looked promising: a full sidewalk terrace with folks seemingly enjoying themselves, cute interior, etc. Placed our order (a couple breakfast plates and coffees) with the cashier and took our seat. 

Waited for 5, then 10, then 15 minutes and realized we hadn't gotten our coffees. I understand places can get busy but this was ridiculous. I dunno, maybe acknowledge that they're swamped and our coffees are coming, or bring us some water or, something. 

After seeing an older couple take their seats after us and get their coffees relatively quickly, I went to the counter and calmly reminded the cashier of our coffees and she annoyingly went to make them. No apology or explanation. Our coffees finally came, after around 20 minutes. 

Our food came after around 35 minutes. We both got the breakfast plate: eggs, toast, potatoes, bacon, and dill sauce. The dill sauce was great. Everything else was solid. Worth the wait and the attitude? I'd say no. 

When the service is so bad that you don't really remember how good the food was, that's no bueno.

It didn't help that we were the only brown people in the place. Not a good look.  

Finished our meals hastily and decided to get the hell out of there. Even asking for our check and a to-go box was a cause for funk from our friend the cashier. Maybe she was having a rough day? Trying to have empathy here, but my gut felt some real shade. 

My advice: if you're not white, don't bother coming here. And even if you are, you still might get shitty service. I've had better experiences at Timmy's."}
{"text":"Very good latte. Pretty decent light lunch.  Friendly staff n ambiance. 
Wifi
Interesting street traffic.   Nice terrace in summer."}
{"text":"The staff ain't always friendly. It's happened a couple times where they seemed fed up or overwhelmed. However, the drinks and food are tasty and well priced with a few minor exceptions. It's my go to place when I can't decide what to eat or if we're on the go and need to eat in the car. The chai latté is also pretty damn good :)"}
{"text":"This place was a great alternative to the greasy Cosmo's staple.  Much better breakfast that came with some white sauce that I can't quite identify, but put this from a 4 star to a 5 star.  Service was great!  Friendly, looks like it's family run, which is always entertaining.  A great change from the same old that most cafes seem to offer these days, lots of unique offerings.  I definitely plan on discovering more of them."}
{"text":"I have only been here to eat once, but one time I was having a crazy day, needed to use the washroom and was so hungry, but had loads of laundry in the machines across the street. The lady at the counter was super sweet to me, and I promised to return. The food is surprisingly good for a cafe. I had their eggplant parmesan sandwhich, a veg soup and a glass of water. The sandwich was out of this world, so good, it squirted a big glob of it onto my lap. haha. The soup was lacking salt, but otherwise it was ok.
Very pleasant service, very pleasant surroundings. I felt very comfortable here."}
{"text":"OMG. Where do I start? My boyfriend and I drove up to Montreal from NYC for the weekend. It was our last day in the city and I wanted to get a crepe. Yelp to the rescue once again! I ordered the Dulce De Leche crepe with banana and whipped cream, my boyfriend had the banana foster crepe with nutella on the side. The crepes were perfect and the fillings were yummy. His banana fosters crepe was a little bit on the too sweet side for me, but still delicious. The people working there were very friendly and the rest of the food they had looked absolutely, gut-busting-ly, amazing. If I lived near this place, someone would have to roll me home every time."}
{"text":"We ordered the basic breakfast dish and the dolce de lece waffle. Basic breakfast was really good, the potatoes cooked to perfection. The dolce de lece and cream on my waffle was really good. For me, I prefer a little bit darker crunchier waffle. Still the cream and dolce de lece were delicious. What I think really makes this place nice is that you don't feel rushed out. It feels really nice to sip a giant latte and linger over the sun pouring in the front window. Great vibe and a really charming wait staff."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a smoothie prepared with fresh fruits. Staff is friendly and they have a DVD exchange"}
{"text":"1 star for nice people.
1 star for cozy quiet place place.

Thoroughly dissatisfied with this cafe. Service was slow and disorganized. Though they were nice they did bring us the wrong orders and we had to bring them back. The place was hardly full enough to justify that.

Service was so slow that no less than 3 people left before being served what they ordered in the one hour we were waiting.

The Latté I ordered tasted as if they reused the same coffee they used from a previous cup. I paid 5$ for warm milk essentially.

The empanadas were not heated long enough for the center to to be cold. Same goes for their wraps, never fully heated.

Avoid the chicken wrap at all costs. It is so spicy that all the other flavours are drowned out.

Would not recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"A bit haphazard, with slow, inattentive service, but a friendly place that has good food. 
 Our \"blueberry pancakes\" came with no blueberries in the pancakes -- berries came in a little bowl. 
 Cook said she doesn't like to put berries in batter because they gum up the skillet. Pancakes were still tasty, but we'd have preferred to know what we'd get before it arrived.
 Our scrambled eggs and bacon were nicely cooked, with very good home fries. 
 The only coffee is dark-roast. If you prefer a lighter roast, you won't find it here."}
{"text":"Nice staff, good coffee. Cute interior and homey feel. Large terrace (altho on a busy street with lots of cars passing). I recommend their iced chai!! Perfect amount of cinnamon with crushed ice."}
{"text":"We stopped in for a quick lunch. Service was fantastic, lunch was delicious. Even the carrot cake was phenomenal (and this is coming from a person who doesn't care for the stuff, but I couldn't help but sample my companion's!). Will definitely be back for brunch."}
{"text":"Found this great little cafe while looking for a different place in NDG - it was a fantastic little find.

I had waffles with dulce de leche (the real stuff, not the sickly-sweet kind you sometimes get) while the gf had the banana foster waffles - both were outstanding. There was a bunch of other food on display that looking great, including legit-looking Argentinean empenadas (I'm going to go back just to try them).

We had lattes, and the coffee was good (but not amazing). They were still better than most breakfast places in Montreal, so it's not actually a negative.

The staff were really friendly. They offered to combine different things from the menu if we wanted, and gave suggestions when we asked, which was nice.

They had a terrace-like setup of table and chairs out the front, taking great advantage of NDG's massive sidewalks - something I'll definitely be giving it a go on the warmer weekends."}
{"text":"Not bad. I've had good and bad lattes here. Lots of room, outdoor terrace in the summer. I'd go back."}
{"text":"Great affordable food.  No rush move along.  I was there for 4 hours and no hassle."}
{"text":"I finally got around to trying mate latte ! As a coffee lover I'm always on the lookout for cute little coffee shops. I really liked this place for its local friendly neighbourhood feel , people walking by saying hello to eachother and to the staff , friendly servers that make you feel welcome and cute homey interior as well as outdoor seating. I enjoyed the coffee (iced latte) and the ambience. A lot of people were there for breakfast or food as well (they serve your usual simple breakfast foods, empanadas , salads sandwiches etc ...) in addition to coffee and tea. I definitely would like to go back for more coffee and to try the food ! great place for a date or to spend some time with a friend or just to hangout alone with a book/laptop and a coffee. Places like this are one of the reasons I like NDG so much"}
{"text":"I walked in after doing the night shift, it was 7am on a Thursday morning. An older guy was sitting in the back and one woman was working behind the counter. She greeted me with a smile as low music played through the speakers. I explained I was tired and hungry and I had never been there before. She gave me multiple suggestions till I settled on a waffle with fresh fruit, whipped cream and maple syrup. I ate quietly by myself while she served me. It was so good. The fruit was fresh and delicious, the waffle was made on the spot, the whipped cream was light and the syrup was local and delicious. 

Matté Latté was so good that I brought my girlfriend back the next afternoon. The place was packed both inside and out and we were served promptly. Prices are high but fair for the portions and quality you get."}
{"text":"This is an amazing find.  Really low on the radar screen but boy can they deliver.  If your looking for a place that's low key with a down home living-room fell to it, then this is one of the best spots to pass the time in ndg.  Music, ambience, quality of food, portions, great service, all this makes it just a wonderful experience.  I arrived at 11 for a late breakfast, they don't make omelettes or reg eggs, but they incorporate eggs in most of their dishes.  I ordered an old fashion waffle and it was terrific with lots of butter on the side, and real maple syrup along with excellent Union brand coffee.

I will be back and I will tell all my friends about this place.  If you need a break from Starbucks, then try this out."}
{"text":"Une p'tite vite juste pour vous dire que la snob de café en moi trouve qu'ils se sont pas mal amélioré côté espresso et latte ces derniers temps. J'essaie de plus en plus de faire mes rencontres là-bas quand j'ai à faire des réunions vers l'ouest de la ville et en plus, l'internet est vraiment bien. Deux morceaux de robots d'extra!"}
{"text":"Jolie place avec choix santé des repas, decoration eclectique, agreable et tranquile pour un café et plus."}
