{"text":"Visiting toronto from Victoria I stopped in for lunch and ordered the Maki lunch special.  Wow the freshness of the sushi for the price you're paying is astounding. So delicious. I am craving the sushi as I write this review. So good!!"}
{"text":"This place does not appreciate repeat business.  I have been going here for two years, at first I looked past the garbage service provided by the ladies in there justifying it to myself as they maybe having a bad day.  This changed in my last visit two days ago when the short lady rolled her eyes everytime we made a polite requests for basic things such as napkins or spicy mayo. In addition to that she had the audacity to tell me that she will charge me for the excessive amount of rice they  lost their sushi with to fill you up.  Disappointment is all that came to me as I have always recommended this place but clearly my money is not good enough for this place.  In order for the lady to simmer down I had to give her a piece of my mind by reminding her that I am a paying customer and if their business does not feel the need to provide me the service that should be given when we are paying $18 (something)  dollars per person at a table of five then she just has to say so and we won't return here.  Everyone at my table wanted to leave because the service and food was horrible.  Save yourself and your company time and embarrassment by avoiding thus place.  In this email every place has the same offering it's the service that makes one place stand out more than other.  Which in this case does not exist and they will try to scam you by over stuffing your sushi with rice."}
{"text":"I live in the area and my boyfriend and I absolutely love this place and eat here on a regular basis. The service is always very fast, the staff are friendly, and the price is always affordable. Not to mention the sushi here always tastes great. The salmon sushi lover combo is my absolute favourite and I end up getting this 90% of the time :) Overall it is our neighborhood gem that we always rely on when we are craving sushi or don't feel like cooking :)"}
{"text":"This place has very good service, to start things off. The fish is fresh enough. And the food tastes good. The servers brought food and drink at a relatively quick pace.

However, it is brought down by its deficiencies. This place leaves two AYCE sheets on your table, and the reason why is that in their world, they believe that two sheets and dessert =AYCE. Asking for an extra sheet for more food is met with apprehension and a disingenuous attitude from the servers, who pretend to not understand you when they really do.

The rolls that are made after the two sheets were horribly assembled, filled with rice and slivers of whatever meat and vegetables in the roll. they also forgot some food, in an attempt to say \"we don't want to serve you any more.\"

Maybe it is the petite bellies of the regulars, or the restaurant's frugal ways, but this is not a place for someone that is looking for an AYCE restaurant. For a sit down or quick catch-up with a friend, where you are talking more than eating, then this place isn't so bad. For someone that is looking for a place that they can eat as much as they want without feeling being judged by the staff, look elsewhere."}
{"text":"I had the AYCE sushi, and was please with everything that I received. Not the best sushi I've ever had but very good. The price of $16.99 was a bargain for what I ordered (not usually as much of an oiker). My sister had an Oyako Don for $8.50 (which included soup and salad), and she was thrilled with it. I had a taste of it and next time I'll give that a try as I too thought it was excellent. My brother-in-law had the Salmon Teriyaki dinner as was pleased with it. We all thought the pricing should have been ranked as a single $ - as it's one of the better priced sushi places. Small and cute dining atmosphere. We all said we'd like to come back. It's a keeper. Large menu, with lots of good things to choose from."}
{"text":"This place used to be more popular and here's a few reasons why:

Service was better
Fried food was less greasy
the chef consistently delivered well prepared sushi

One reason I keep coming back is because I know this place and it used to be right beside my house. 

Service is awful now, god forbid you ask them for more water. The sushi is still not bad however, i've noticed that in rolls such as the spicy salmon roll, they will use chewy raw salmon which is just not ok. 

I think ordereding things off their non AYCE menu is probably a better choice"}
{"text":"This place really needs to employ more people. The 2 waitresses were unbelievably busy and it always took us atleast 10 mins to get their attention.. The service was slow. The food soooooo boring. Never visiting ever again"}
{"text":"I went in for their lunch special today.  One of the two rolls (spicy tuna) was less than fresh.  It tasted down right sour.  The soup didn't taste like miso at all.  In fact, it tasted like bleach.  I asked my server if I could have a new bowl of soup and she claimed the next one would taste the same.  I said it was my bowl that tasted like the bleach may have not been rinsed well.  She just said \"no\".  No, it doesn't taste like bleach?  I have worked in the restaurant industry for years and I would never just deny what my customer was claiming, taste-wise.  Instead of apologizing and trying to rectify the situation, she just gave me a look of, \"I don't care\".  


This is the first time I was unhappy with the service and food.  All other meals were enjoyable.  I was really disappointed and won't go back."}
{"text":"really great service and great fresh sushi. We didn't get AYCE just the regular orders off the menu. My sashimi was fresh and the assortment was great. In one sashimi order I got butter fish, white fish, tuna and salmon and no weird squid pieces. Great little place!!"}
{"text":"First time trying this place and got the lunch bento and maki lunch items ($15 for both and comes with miso soup and salads) no tax on pick up orders with cash  

Very generous with portion sizes ^.^

Everything tasted great. I read before that one person mentioned the miso was watered down mine was fine. 

Pleasant and fast service.

I didn't see anything wrong with this place and you definitely get more than what you pay for."}
{"text":"I've been really pleased with the take out and the sushi at Sakae. I should start with the disclaimer that I'm a vegetarian so I can't comment on the quality of the fish but my co-workers always seem pleased. It's become our new go-to sushi joint. 

They have a few things on their menu that you don't see everyday. Rolls wrapped in cucumber instead of nori have become a co-workers favourite. 

Personally, I'm impressed at the vegetarian maki available. Not the biggest selection I've ever seen but way above average and if you order the specials, it's also very well priced. And they actually have decent vegetarian specials!

The lunch service is prompt and friendly. 

We haven't tried the all you can eat menu yet but it looks impressive with a wide variety of choices but it does look a tiny bit expensive. 

Overall, this is a solid sushi spot to check out if you're in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Great salmon sashimi! Have only ordered through ubereats but I've never been disappointed by the food I've received"}
{"text":"Pros: 
- Cheap

Cons:
- watered down miso soup
- sushi overstuffed with rice 
- paper thin slices of sashimi 
- No A/C (was very humid and uncomfortable)"}
{"text":"Probably the worst all you can eat sushi experience I've had. The servers were friendly, but the quality of the sushi just isn't there. And I think they charged nearly $17 for lunch which is absolutely outrageous. I will never go back."}
{"text":"I've been to Sakae a few times now, twice for dinner and once for lunch, and it's been just fine.  There's nothing that blows me away about it, but I'm not a sushi snob by any means, so it's good enough to satisfy my occasional sushi cravings.  

At a cost of about $7-8 per roll on the regular menu, the AYCE option is actually a pretty good deal if you can eat at least three rolls.  As other reviews mentioned, though, they will charge you for any pieces that you don't eat, so do several small orders to make sure you really can finish everything you order.

I had lunch there today, and for $7.50 you get soup, salad and two rolls.  Really good deal as far as I'm concerned.

The servers are very sweet, and while they might forget to bring water over right away, they'll rush to bring it to you as soon as you remind them"}
{"text":"This is my favourite AYCE sushi place in Toronto. The fish tastes great, especially the butterfish, which is absolutely excellent. It's pricy for lunch (I think it's $16.99 on weekdays and $18.99 on weekends) but that's because there's no differentiation between the lunch and dinner menus, so the price doesn't change. On weekdays especially, it's a great deal since you're getting all the delicious sashimi and fancy fish that isn't normally included for lunch.

It's not as good as some Ã  la carte places, but as far as AYCE goes, I haven't found better in Toronto."}
{"text":"We ate there for the 2nd time this past week.  While the sushi is quite good and nice selection, the service was atrocious!

The server forgot our order!  We sat there for 30 minutes chit-chatting until we realized why are those people who came after us, already eating their sushi?  Well, it turns out, she had lost our order.  I was angry, fueled by hunger.

At that point though, they got their act together and served us.

Unfortunately, they made no concessions when it came time to settling the bill. They seemed to recognize their error but did  not give an inch!"}
{"text":"We got delivery from Sakae last night. Their menu has been tempting me all month. Delivery is free with orders over $20 and their delivery area is pretty big, bounded by Yonge on the west, Bayview on the east, St. Clair on the south, and York Mills on the north.

We ordered a hand roll set and a veggie sushi set. Both came with salad and soup. (I didn't order kaiso salad. Why did I not order the kaiso salad? Next time.) 

I have a bit of a beef (hardee har har) with veggie sushi, sometimes. If you see 'asparagus sushi' or 'spinach sushi' that is not described as a roll/maki, it's a lump of rice with plain veggies tied to the top of it with a strip of nori. It's... very bland and very plain, and too much to chew. I guess if the rice was really excellent it would be nice, but this style seems only to be made by places who really should be dressing up their rice more. These needed a dip in the soy sauce. I'll stick with rolls from now on.

The rolls were decent -- my veggie set came with yam tempura and avocado rolls, which are my favourite roll. These were a bit sticky and occasionally the yam seemed a bit too firm, but they were pretty tasty.

The sets are $9 and up and very generous. If you have a craving and don't mind if it's a little less than perfect, this is a good place to order from."}
{"text":"I love Sakae Sushi! A great family run business with caring servers. We live in the area and frequent Sakae for their All-You-Can-Eat menu and the servers have come to know our orders! Food is Always fresh, and for hungry families, this is a great deal! Love the Dynamite Rolls! Don't let the small space fool you!"}
{"text":"Amazing service! Reasonable prices and the best sushi I've had in this neighborhood!
Can't wait to go there again or order from them because they are only about 5 blocks from my place and they deliver!
Highly recommended!"}
