{"text":"Duo.D is proof that keeping things simple works best. A very straightforward menu, with a broad selection of wines. Can definitely recommend the Saumon Fumé Maison, Confit de Canard, Steak Frites, and Creme Brulée. Looking forward to going back for the rest of the menu. As others have mentioned, great ambiance and service."}
{"text":"We started with the smoked salmon, which was paper thin and obviously made in house. We devoured it! The pate was a generous portion, light, almost fluffy, and out of this world. The duck confit was amazing, tender, moist, delicious. My wife got the cod, which she loved. The creme brulee was heavenly, light vanilla flavor, crispy top with caramelized bits. The kids split the steak frites, and the nine year old told the chef \"This is the best meal I have ever had!\" which earned two thumbs up for the chef! The service was personal, and top notch. It isn't cheap, but it is worth every penny."}
{"text":"The food was excellent, however we did not quite enjoy the service. 
My mom was visiting me for my graduation so I took her on a two day trip to Montreal. I wanted to introduce my mom to some authentic French cuisine, so I picked this restaurant as it was highly recommended. The server was an elegant Francophone lady, however even though she was smiling I felt like she was wearing a mask the whole time. The menu was in French and I know very little French, so I asked her for recommendations. She was very impatient and seemed like she did not want to waste time on us, simply replied everything on the menu was delicious and walked away. We were the very first customers that day and the only customers for a while, but when I waved her over, she was busy with her computer and did not notice our needs for at least three times. Later, more diners got in and I observed the way she treated them was much more friendly. Maybe I was overthinking, is it because we are Asian or we don't speak French that lead to the difference in her service? I have been to many restaurants including a few upscale ones, and I have never felt being treated so indifferently."}
{"text":"Very friendly waitress, great food! 
The whole course was great. I don't really know why people complain about their service. Ours were amazing!"}
{"text":"Lors de notre anniversaire de 1 an, mon copain et moi avions trouvé un bon resto, à bon prix sur Notre Dame, mais nous nous sommes cognés le nez à la porte. Nous avons donc rebroussé chemin et nous avons opté pour le Duo. D, qui était sur notre route. De l'extérieur, ça avait l'air assez sombre, mais il y avait des clients, alors on a tenté notre chance, et nous n'avons pas été déçus!

La dame qui se chargeait de la salle (alors que son conjoint cuisinait) était fort sympathique et nous a proposé une entrée de tartare qui n'était pas au menu. Nous ne l'avons pas regretté, il était délicieux!

Pour les plats principaux, le canard confit que mon copain a commandé était impeccable, mais mon plat de morue sur une purée de pommes de terre et céleri-rave, avec des légumes sautés, le tout orné d'une cuillérée de sauce au yogourt et de caviar était imbattable! Tout était parfait! La cuisson du poisson était impeccable, la purée était savoureuse, et tous les éléments s'harmonisaient incroyablement bien. 
Restait à ajouter une crème brûlée pour le dessert, et nous étions au paradis.
10 mois plus tard, je m'en souviens encore!

Mon chum a dépensé plus que prévu, mais ça en valait la peine... de toute manière, cette année, c'est moi qui ramasse la facture!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were in town in early February, and were looking for places to eat in Montreal and stumbled upon Bistro Duo D on Tripadvisor. The excellent reviews were what drew us to this place, and we were not disappointed! We were extremely pleased with the food and the ambience at Bistro Duo D. The trek out to the restaurant was well worth it, even in the dead of winter.
 
We had the soup of the day, which was the cream of mushroom as well as the duck confit and the cod with coconut curry sauce. To finish it off, we had the creme brûlée  which has just the right amount of crisp on the top layer. We enjoyed the food immensely, and would definitely recommend Bistro Duo D to friends. We hope to be back soon!"}
{"text":"Much to my surprise this restaurant didn't say anything about whether a reservation is needed for dinner, but we got turned down by an unacceptably rude server, an old Caucasian lady while there were at least four tables available. My wife and I walked 10 minutes on a frosty -10 F evening, and that old lady still wouldn't even show any compassion and gratitude to customers like us. What can I say is this restaurant is very likely run by some racists, otherwise there is no rationale for such ruthless behavior. Period."}
{"text":"If there were 10 stars I would give them all to this restaurant. Food is awesome. Best steak frites ever in my life and there have been a few  
Owners make their own smoked salmon it is perfectly smoked. Try it"}
{"text":"Incredible meal and service. If available order: escargot, foie gras torchon, steak frites, steak tartare and strawberry shortcake"}
{"text":"Food and ambiance was great but neither of which could make up for the unbelievably rude server (old lady). The server's hostility ruined what would have been a great night. I have never been treated so rudely as a paying customer. Hands down the worst service we had in Montreal. Food deserved 5 stars. Disappointed with the service and will not be returning."}
{"text":"Wonderful and well run restaurant by husband and wife team. The husband is the chef and the wife runs front of house. We were looking for good french food and Bistro Duo D delivered. They have an excellent wine selection. For dinner we started with the escargot and salmon appetizers. My husband had a spectacular duck confit and I had cod that was melt in your mouth tender. We shared a chocolate mousse for dessert. I wish we had this place in our neighborhood."}
{"text":"Recommended by friends..and now it's my turn to say...GO TO THIS restaurant!! The food is amazing, the service impeccable, the ambience...do you hear me sighing?? Truly remarkable evening...a do not miss while you are in Montreal! If I lived there, this would be my go to place to take visiting family and friends and a blissful night out withy husband."}
{"text":"Awesome food, awesome service, awesome owners! This chef/owner has been the head chef in many of Montréal's best restaurants. And his wife is spot on in the service department."}
{"text":"Ordered the cod fish, DH ordered the duck confit. Best salad I've ever had! Sweet and sour but not too much either side. The atmosphere is very nice if you are looking for a wine and dine place. Loosing 1 star because the lady didn't give us a menu or tell us anything about the menu on the wall. She spilt water on the table without even saying sorry. Basically she ignored us for the most part."}
{"text":"I made reservations in advance, and came on time. The place has high ceilings, and tables are far and wide apart. French music playing in the background is nice and doesn't interfere with the conversation, the whole place is instantly lovable. Taste of the food? It's just great. We ordered Escargot, Liver paste, Asparagus, Cod, Veal fillet, Duck Confit, all were great. For dessert the popular creme brulee was sold out, so we opted for pudding chomeur and the strawberry shortcake instead, delicious. I would definitively come back."}
{"text":"What a fantastic dinner we had at Duo D! A two-person operation (at least the night we were there), both the food and service were impressive. The creme brûlée is probably the best I've had, and the overall experience deserves 5 stars."}
{"text":"I came here for a business trip in July 2012 and cannot stop thinking about how delicious it was.

I can't remember what we had except the DUCK CONFIT was the BEST I HAVE EVER HAD and I would fly back to Montreal just to eat it ONE MORE TIME! I have searched the earth for a better duck confit and have not found it. Hats off to the amazing chef!

TIPS- Do not forget to make reservations as they do get busy and the place is very small (small but a great atmosphere if you were on a date. Unfortunately i was with my boss so it wasn't as fun, but thanks for picking up the bill boss!!)"}
{"text":"We had an 8:30 reservation and got there early. They already had our table set up and seated up but apologized because the kitchen was not ready to prepare our order. They brought us drinks and we had a lovely time waiting. We so appreciated the special treatment that we had knowing that our food was being cooked just for us. We had the duck confetti and it was as others have said - marvelous. They offered a free per-appetizer and bread/butter, as we were waiting for our appetizer. 

The food was the best we had in Montreal, the service was superb, and the atmosphere was perfect for our anniversary dinner. I would highly recommend going  here if you have one meal in Montreal and you want French. Thank you for a lovely evening."}
{"text":"The best meal I have ever had. I will remember this place until the day I die. Thank you Catherine and Phillipe."}
{"text":"Awesome.  Visited with a group of 6.  Apps were escargot, smoked salmon, salad.  Mains duck confit. Veal tartar and cod.  Each person raved about the meal.  Awesome!  Service great.  Wonderful woman.  Had a great time and will be back"}
{"text":"Amazing! I came to this restaurant after having dined at Joe Beef the night before and the food was so much better! The server (a lady) was very knowledgeable and passionate about the dishes on the menu, and was also well versed in the wines. I had a bite of everyone's dish that was ordered at the table... appetizers: foie gras, escargots, cream of mushroom soup and french onion soup; the french onion soup was absolutely divine! Mains: beef tartare, duck confit, steak frites... the duck was the best I've ever tasted (skin was perfectly crisp and the meat was tender) and my steak was cooked perfectly - I'm not crazy about NY strip steak, but this changed my mind! Would definitely recommend this place, has a great atmosphere too and very cozy."}
{"text":"Suggéré par une amie, je ne connaissais pas ce bistro situé dans Griffintown mais finalement après avoir fait des recherches, j'apprends qu'il est côté selon TripAdvisor #3 sur 2817 restaurants à Montréal  (en date du 17/02/13) , c'est louche, il faut que j'essaie. Finalement, je comprends les bonnes critiques sur ce petit bistro. Beau & bon petit bistro français, bon service, belle ambiance ainsi que des prix abordables. Menu simple mais délicieux, que ce soit mon entrée d'escargots, mon plat principal, morue poêlée, sauce coco & curry et pour finir le dessert, crème brûlée à la vanille. Au niveau de la carte des vins, on peut choisir au verre ou encore à la bouteille. Bref, on y retourne !"}
{"text":"This was a treat for our group after long days of work on a visit to Montreal. The menu choices were rich, well prepared and nicely presented. The wine list is small but well chosen. Service was business-like, efficient when we had an unexpected extra person arrive. The decor is simple and seating could be more comfortable. But we could hear each other in normal conversation, no ambient noise/music interference. For a weeknight meal, this was a very pleasant surprise for the group. Personally, it was an indulgence to have the foie gras and the beef tartare, both delicious and in portions large enough to share."}
{"text":"Cod tastes delicious. Melted in your mouth. The waitress (old lady) service is terrible. Worst service in Montreal I ever had. But the environment and food are great.
If service was good, I would give 5 stars."}
