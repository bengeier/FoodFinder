{"text":"My fav place for 2 reasons 

1 Butter Brew!
2 Luke!  one of the nicest baristas I have encountered"}
{"text":"Great coffee, excellent food and the aesthetic of the place was so pleasing. The Wizard Meltdown and Butter Cream latte are a must try! Definitely coming back here again, great service as well."}
{"text":"Super cute coffee place! Harry Potter theme is so clever! I got an iced Nutella latte and my boyfriend got a hot latte. I normally don't like the way Nutella lattes taste, except for the one at Sambalatte, but was pleasantly surprised that it was really good! It was not too sweet at all! My boyfriend enjoyed his latte too. 

I would've given them 5 stars, but when My boyfriend placed his order and asked for raw sugar with his latte, the cashier said that they have it over there. We really do not like it when people tell us this, as it melts easier when they make the coffee with it.  We never have problems with this request at other coffee locations. 

Other than that, the coffee is really good! I'm glad I found another place that makes great Nutella lattes."}
{"text":"Great coffees and they make a great cappuccino!!!  Nice staff treats you with superb customer service.  I'm going back, soon!!!"}
{"text":"I wish there was a 3.5 star button. It's hard to call it 4 stars but I feel that 3 is too low. Obviously the decor is what everyone goes for, but it wasn't what I thought it would be. Nice vibe and would be my go-to if it weren't so busy all the time. Waited 45 min today and it's been open for a few weeks now. Had the Spanish latte due to the negative reviews of the overly-hyped butter brew. I enjoyed my coffee and conversation with friends. I love the idea behind it and it's genius for marketing and sales, but if it were mine, I would've gone a lot more in depth with the theme. Was a little let down by how unmagical it seemed, but it was a nice experience overall. Just didn't quite live up to the hype."}
{"text":"Finally had an opportunity to pop in to Bad Owl. It wasn't as large as I hoped but it wasn't teeny tiny. We were able to find a table at 9:30am on Sunday but by 11am it was packed. 

Tried the Lavender Latte and it was really really good!  They made regular whip cream just for my drink and it too was yummy. 

Tried the Avocado Toast and it was really good. I haven't tried avocado with egg before and I am STILL craving this toast 4 days later. Shared the order with a friend so we each had a slice. It was really good and I may have to pop in this weekend for another. 

Overall I enjoyed Bad Owl. I deducted 1 star because quite frankly I would rather come here than Starbucks, but their hours are severely lacking. So no morning stops for me when I have to be at work at 7am...when they open."}
{"text":"What a great little coffee shop! its a mix of Harry Potter and Dr. Who... The avocado toast was incredible and the drinks were made with care. I'm looking forward to the next visit for sure."}
{"text":"Excellent coffee and amazing atmosphere!

I am a huge harry potter fan and it is impossible to find anything harry potter themed unless you're in Universal Studios. The coffee there is pretty good but I won't replace it with my usual Starbucks. Although the atmosphere and the feel of the shop is beyond what I expected. Everything is super fun and alot of picture opportunities. If I am in the area  would 100% go again.

4/5 stars for the long line and slowness of service."}
{"text":"I would definitely recommend this place to anyone. The staff was friendly; the butter brew latte was incredible; there was a short wait time even though there was a line; and its Harry Potter themed (WUT). The only reason it isn't 5-Stars is because there's very limited seating. I actually had to sit outside and wasn't able to enjoy the atmosphere to go along with my drink. Other than that, it was a great experience."}
{"text":"Love the Harry Potter theme, I thought it was clever to have 9 6/8 on the wall, reduce it to 9 3/4.. super friendly staff. It gets busy around the lunch rush of course and they really held their ground. I come here often and always order the Charmingly Pesto and never pair it with same coffee, anything coconut I adore which they have for the coffee.. if there is a line trust me it is worth the wait"}
{"text":"Being a Harry Potter fan, obviously I fricking love this HP coffee shop!!! The staff is super friendly as well as helpful. The custom tables with hp quotes and overall decorations are unique, heartwarming, and fun! For coffee drinkers, the Butter Beer Latte is seriously heaven in a cup  and for tea drinkers, The Blossoming Beach Flower Tea is soothing"}
{"text":"This was my first experience at Bad Owl. I was not aware it was a Harry Potter themed coffee shop. I'm not an HP fan so the \"theme\" of the shop mattered very little to me. I was really looking for a new coffee place that wasn't Starbucks. 

I drove up to the shop a little after 7 am. It was hard to tell if the place was opened as there was no \"Open\" sign nor was there any times for the shop posted anywhere on the doors. There was 1 other car in the lot so I decided to get out of my car and go inside. 

They were, in fact, open. The guys behind the bar were very friendly and greeted me warmly. The menu was a little confusing and I was somewhat pressed for time so I didn't have a lot of time to stare at their big menu. I asked for just a drip coffee and was informed that their coffee maker was under repair. 

I was seriously going to walk out. WTF do you mean your coffee maker is broken? You are a coffee shop. I think the guys could tell I was going to walk and they offered to make me anything. One suggested an Americano. I've never been a huge fan a espresso without milk but figured since I was there, why not. I agreed to the Americano. 

They made the drink relatively quickly and it was inexpensive (a whopping $2). The guys seemed really concerned about whether I liked the drink, which I did. 

I would definitely come back to Bad Owl. Service and quality of the product were above and beyond. As for the décor, this was not my reason for visiting so the other posts that it was not HP enough mattered little to me. The price point was a super nice bonus as well."}
{"text":"First time I went , was on a Saturday of the opening week , and they had ran out of coffee completely . I went today super excited & ready to be consumed by a Harry Potter experience . Nope. They had maybe 3 \"Harry potter\" decorations, and regular coffee items you'd find at any other coffee shop . I understand it's hard to make it in the coffee business with Starbucks around , but I feel like they just used Harry Potter as a niche to get people in . They're nitrogen coffee was terrible & there butter brewed coffee was ok (not anything out of the ordinary )."}
{"text":"Hold the phone. How am I just finding this place. My brother told me about it and I couldn't believe I hadn't heard about it considering it was just down the street from my house. My husband got the Nutella Latte and I got the Nutella hot chocolate along with a chocolate croissant and a blueberry muffin. I'm pregnant hence the choices in food. Haha

The pastries were fresh and soft and oh so good.  The drinks... Well I chugged mine. It's that good. So excited to have found this place. Not to mention the interior is really cute."}
{"text":"This is a fantastic little café with delicious drinks and food. Ordered the Sweet Coconut Latte with almond milk: it tasted like coconut cookies. Very lactose-intolerant friendly! I asked to have it in a for-here cup and enjoyed hanging out with a friend here. Overall, a chill Harry-Potter-themed place to meet up at. 

Also, feel free to bring your laptop without fear - there are enough outlets for everyone here. 

Oh, and don't forget to enter your phone number at the register so you can earn points! They have a rewards system that offers things like 'one free sandwich', '20% off your waffles', etc."}
{"text":"Love this place! The food is made all in house with a shout out to John for the world's best muffins.  If you are lucky enough to stop in when there are muffins, splurge! ! If not the waffles rock too. The coffee is bar none. We drive from 30 min away once a week just to go here. ..passing at least 10 starbucks on the way. There is no comparison.  BAD OWL all the way!"}
{"text":"Great coffee and atmosphere but they don't have high chairs! Which I would get if they were just a coffee shop but they also have a full menu and I can't sit down and have lunch with my toddler or do meet ups with other moms here."}
{"text":"Love coming here but not a fan of the wait time. I came In and ordered their shot flight and a toast and had to wait 45mins for a toast. It was delicious and fresh when I got it, but don't think it should take 45mins for a toast. Will continue coming just not for food"}
{"text":"Love this place! my favorite is the sea salt and caramel nitro brew... From the tap! Great coffee shop with Harry Potter flare... espresso petronum! lol"}
{"text":"Great tasting coffee with lots of unique flavored lattes to choose from, tasty sandwiches and waffles, and a friendly staff! My favorite coffee shop in town."}
{"text":"Our First time here... Everything we ordered was absolutely delish!! We got charmingly pesto, bad owls BLT and nutella waffles with bananas. For our drinks we got the lychee cream pop and Nutella latte both so yummy. We will definitely be back again !!!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Love love love this place. I never thought I'd be a regular at another coffee shop because I work at a very large coffee chain but I'd gladly pass multiple locations to go here because the coffee is so fkin on point and so are the people that work here. Their madeleines make me so very very happy and their grilled cheese is what life is all about. My go to is usually nitro but some Sunday's they're out so Kyoto is a great option instead."}
{"text":"I love this place just because its harry potter inspired. I ordered a cappuccino and nutella banana waffle. Got my cappuccino right away, i waited for a bit cause i was expecting it to be hot, well not hot, kinda disappointing. I waited for about 15 minutes for my waffle to come. Again i expected it to be atleast warm but its not. I was really disappointed. The only reason why ill be going back here and why i gave it 3 star is because of its interior."}
{"text":"If you have not tried this cafe before you need to! I love this cafe! I come atleast a few times a week and bring everyone who is visiting town because this Harry Potter themed Cafe is so much fun.  I was very inspired meeting the owners and hearing their vision for the cafe. They  truly care about their product and customer experience. A Harry Potter themed Cafe intrigued me and upon first walking in the decor did not disappoint. From a payphone booth, to owl cages, to all the fun harry potter themed words on the tables, the cafe makes you feel as if you have entered a mystical wizardry world.

The menu is my favorite part. All of their drinks and coffee are high quality and there is a huge variety. I am not a big butter beer fan but it is a very popular drink. My favorite latte drinks are the Spanish latte, white chocolate coconut, and the Iced Mint Mojito which  tastes very similar to Phil's Coffee in San Francisco and is flavored with a real mint leaf. I tried there Sea Salt Iced coffee but was I did not like it so much. I could not taste the sea salt cream as I usually can at other cafe's and bubble tea places.

They have a cool coffee that is made from glass bottles that look like it came from a science lab. I also tried the nitro infused coffee, which is coffee infused with nitrogen. It comes straight from the tap and the foam makes it look like a Guinness beer. However the taste is awesome if you like strong coffee and it was so much fun as I had never tried style before.

The staff is very knowledgeable and friendly and you can tell they know what they are talking about. There is a passion here for great coffee and customer service and I am love coming here."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to come here for a while now and now that I have I am a little disappointed. I had really high expectations for a HP-themed coffee shop but this place didn't live up to the hype for me. 

The most disappointing thing for me was that I thought the place was going to have more of a HP atmosphere. I wanted to feel like I was in Hogwarts! Perhaps they could incorporate the different house colors into the store, or have the house flags on the wall or something. I was also expecting the drink names to have more HP references too - so far there's just the butterbeer latte. As much as I love HP, I probably won't be making the drive out there for another visit."}
{"text":"Heard a lot about this place from friends so we drove across town to check it out. The lavender latte was so good! Totally not what I was expecting. The only complaints I have are the long line we had to wait in (but it was a Sunday morning) and no explanation of menu items. We didn't really know what some things were. I'm guessing a lot of people there didn't either and that's probably why it took a while in line because people were asking questions. But this place has great coffee and pretty sweet inside with the Harry Potter theme."}
{"text":"The service was awesome, the employee's are extremely nice.
 I can't speak for the coffee myself, but my brother loves it. I can say that the tea is \"meh\" I got some strange Oolong mix, served in water much too hot for that type of tea. It tasted like normal quality Oolong mixed with overly fragrant flowers."}
{"text":"Found about this place because my gf is a huge fan, we both ended up loving this place the music is good it is so neat inside and the coffee is great, this will become a routine for us!"}
{"text":"This seriously is the most amazing little Harry Potter coffee shop ever!! The drinks are delicious and the avocado toast is the best!!"}
{"text":"I was very excited to finally try this place. It is basically a coffee shop with Harry Potter decor and a typical coffee menu. They also have sandwiches, soups and wraps. I got the Nutella latte and it was delicious"}
{"text":"Nice cozy atmosphere. Decent coffee. Interesting take on the HP theme. Staff was very friendly and made some wonderful recommendations. Would definitely come here again"}
{"text":"I'm giving this 3 stars because I am a huge Harry Potter fan and I loved the vibe so much.  For me, it sort of goes downhill after that.  First off the menu, as others have said, is confusing.  If it's a latte, it should have coffee, if it's a steamer, call it a steamer.  Kind of annoying to pay full price for a latte then to be asked, do you want a shot of espresso in that? Well, duh....then you paying way more  for a latte then you should.  I've tried several coffee drinks, most are fine.  My favorite drink, an iced coffee, I guess I don't enjoy all the gimmicky drinks.  I didn't like the pistachio because of the powdery stuff they put on top, it became globs of powder in my coffee, ewe.  But the flavor was great so I'll ask for it without the topping. The food, is pretty spectacular.  That said, is it the right place for $30 lunch? No. Not in my opinion. Overall I like it here, I just have a few personal issues with the menu/cost.  We will be back."}
{"text":"They served us a magical drink called: Disappointment...

Ordered two small drinks, both mochas. Both were cold, watered down and had no sweetener. Beyond substandard; it was \"awful in a cup,\" at $10, for both.

For all the HYPE this place generated, the atmosphere was also disappointing. No mood, no detail and a dirty environment. It was a boring, basic cafe with random Harry Potter decorations slapped here and there. No menu detailing! Don't just print out a basic piece of paper and slap in on a clipboard. Create a menu that's exciting to your guests and fun to read. They didn't even decorate their bathroom and worse still it was messy and smelled.

To top it all off, they were out of their Butterbeer Lattes, (the only remotely Harry Potter themed item on their menu,) AND as of 2/17/15 they ran out of coffee beans... No coffee shop runs out of the main product that keeps their business running...

Bad product, bad ambiance, bad planning...
At least it's appropriately named: BAD."}
{"text":"Ok so I think I'm being picky, I'd give it 5 stars if there was more harry stuff around. Or even more owl things, decor was kind of lacking and I went specifically for the HP ambiance. I had the mint mojito iced coffee it was really good except I kept choking on the mint leaves, would have been amazing without those chunks. All in all will probably be back."}
{"text":"This is quality coffee! I'm from Seattle and I know the good stuff, NOT the 'bucks. Owners Bailey and Yuzo have brought LA coffee culture, Kyoto drip style cold brew coffee and an array of flavors (Butterbeer!) that make any espresso drink worth a try. The MAJOR draw to this shop for me besides the coffee is its Harry Potter themed decor. Each table has either a quote or chapter folio designed into the wood finish. Platform 9 3/4 is also situated by the front door with Hedwig perched precariously staring at you. Their pastries are great and they have a LOT of different leaves perfect for pot of tea if that's your thing. They will soon serve beer and wine and savory foods I hear... Check this place out!"}
{"text":"On vacation visiting Las Vegas last week. We are huge Harry Potter fans so I was very excited to hear about this place and of course I wanted to try the butter beer latte. Awesome decor, busy with lots of people, so I had high hopes. During the wait in line I overheard a customer mention the butter beer latte had no caffeine. This is not posted anywhere. When it was my turn I asked the young lady at the counter if the butter beer came with espresso. She replied all lattes were \"with or without.\" Confused I asked again if she meant the drink came with espresso. The server rolled her eyes and replied, \"yeah if you want it.\" I asked if this cost extra and she once again rolled her eyes and said, \"it costs like 50 cents.\" I looked at the menu board and realized it was $1.00 per shot which would bump the price up by $2.00 for me - most 20 ounce lattes I've had come with 2 shots and I like caffeine. I wanted to clarify before I paid over $9 for a drink so I asked if was $1.00 per shot or if it was reduced to $.50. The server said nothing just glared at me and rolled her eyes a third time! She never answered my question. I was really embarrassed by the whole incident and knowing the place was busy I quickly ordered a small drip coffee to go. Really taken aback by the hostile attitude! 

I understand the butter beer may be a premium drink and cost more - no problem there. It's great the kids (and non caffeinated adults) have something fun to order. But in all my years of drinking coffee I've never heard of a latte without espresso so I don't think I was out of line asking that question. And I don't know why the server was so angry and snotty! The butter beer without espresso is a milk steamer not a latte. More importantly, the nasty attitude ruined the whole thing for me. I had planned to buy a Bad Owl tank top and get my son a hot chocolate. That's easily a $30 plus order gone, as well as any future service from me as we visit the area multiple times per year. This is the first negative review I've ever written on Yelp and I'm sad it is for a coffee shop with such a great premise."}
{"text":"Went with a group of friends to check out the hype of the Harry Potter themed coffee shop. I ordered the iced white chocolate latte, my friends ordered Nutella blended, mocha, and hot green tea. Everything was underwhelming. Prices were a little high for the sizes of the cups. I would rather spend my money at grouchies or Starbucks. The service was fine and the wait was average, but my drink was sloppy with coffee running down the sides. No one in the party will be returning to this place. I do commend their efforts in decorating with random Harry Potter related items to lure customers in."}
{"text":"For those coffee lover, this place has some good quality coffee beans (that without comparing them to costa coffee tho). You see, most of the time, local coffee shops has better coffee beans than commercialized ones. Definetly recommend this store to y'all."}
{"text":"Still packed after two weeks, good sign. Roasted almond latte was delicious. Overall service was quick and efficient. Will go back in a couple months and see if the line is shorter."}
{"text":"It's small, yet quaint, Harry Potter themed yet simply decorated. The butter beer latte is amazing though, creamy and delicious. Definitely will be going back."}
{"text":"Absolutely great experience with quality drinks. The espresso tastes perfect, and there are so many flavor choices. The atmosphere is exactly what you'd expect from a Harry Potter themed cafe, and it had my fiancé who is a huge fan of the series geeking out. Overall amazing experience with a great, friendly staff who make you feel extremely welcome. I'm not from Nevada, but I will definitely always make this a point to stop on my trip."}
{"text":"Great go to spot for coffee but don't want the usual (Starbucks, coffee bean, dunkin, etc) run of the mill coffee.  Also a great spot for breakfast sandwiches, I recommend the charmingly pesto chicken sandwich."}
{"text":"Great coffees, we had an almond croissant and a filled donut hole type thing. Both delicious. So cute inside. Harry Potter themed. We will be back."}
{"text":"The guys behind the counter are super sweet. The food was awesome as well. The waffles I had were warm and soft, the strawberries were fresh and fantastic. I don't like bacon so they switched it out for yogurt free of charge. The signature drink, butterbeer coffee was lovely. You can get it hot or iced. The atmosphere was warm, friendly, and relaxed. I highly recommend this place to every Harry Potter fan !"}
{"text":"This place is pretty dec. The coffee is great-I ordered the salted caramel cold brew coffee and it is by far my favorite coffee in the valley thus far. I love strong coffee and this coffee is super rich and balances out nicely with sweet cream and a dash of salt. I also tried their veggie sandwich and cream of mushroom soup-they tasted amazing!

I like Harry Potter but I'm not obsessed. I have to say the decor was cute, but certainly not as elaborate as expected. They have the Platform 9 3/4 prop set up along a faux brick wall and some Harry Potter phrases painted on the table, but not a whole lot else. Still a cute place though.

The staff are super friendly too! The only con is the items are a little pricey, but it's worth it because the coffee is great and you're supporting a local joint!"}
{"text":"Just... YES!

A great selection of coffee (I ordered the Salted Iced Nitro Coffee, great!) and some of the best pastries I've had in awhile (Chocolate Cherry Muffin and Peaches & Cream Muffin). 

The pastries had a biscuit / cake element to them that made them perfectly pair able to the great coffee. The staff was friendly and helpful. The establishment was clean and orderly. A great experience and all around satisfying coffee experience that I will definitely revisit.

Excellent!"}
{"text":"Great coffee and great food! We really enjoyed the ambience of Bad Owl! A must see if you're in Henderson!"}
{"text":"In love with this coffee house. Everything tastes so fresh and delicious. I'm also a huge Harry Potter fan so this made sense!  I want to try it all!!! Wish I had more hours in the day to hang out there. Must do for all HPlovers!"}
{"text":"My new favorite coffee spot! The staff is very friendly and the coffee is awesome! The lavender latte, defiantly worth trying! I was interested in their cold brew so they sampled me some. One of the best I have ever had, and I brew my own from home! I'll be coming back sooner rather than later!"}
{"text":"Maybe I'm biased because I am that HP super nerd... But I love the concept of this place. The decors were awesome! Coffee wasn't bad either.  The staffs were friendly and greeted us as we walked in. They have the menu posted on the wall which was a little bit hard to read so the cashier gave us some paper menu. They serve coffees, teas and some baked goods. 

We ordered Sea Salt Cream Ice Coffee, strong flavor.. Not too sweet either. Very good. The Nitrogen Cold Brew was also good. Very bold flavor! 

Unfortunately, the place was pretty packed and all the tables were taken so we weren't able to stay longer."}
{"text":"Finally made it over to Bad Owl Coffee today. This place is so fun! Great decor, super friendly staff and our Roasted Almond and Coconut White Mocha Lattes were out of this world! New favorite coffee spot. Great menu as well. Looking forward to ordering food next time."}
{"text":"So went to the grand opening at 7am. This coffee house is right next to Pei Wei. The entryway is adorned with a large curtain which I believe was a reddish color which gave me a feel of elegance. The Harry Potter theme was a nice touch because I enjoyed seeing something that was familiar to me and gave me a positive overall feeling. The size of the place is small and cozy decorated in a lot of warm wood tones and brown colors. The coffee was quite good and we thought it was even better than Starbucks. The pastries were fresh. We had several different types of bear claws and all of them were delicious. Everything was reasonably priced pastries were in the $3 range and the coffees were in the $4 range. The service was warm and friendly and they brought most of our items directly to our table. We got to meet the owners and they were both friendly and helpful. The location is really great as there's lots of other places to eat in the area as well as stores and shops. I would definitely recommend this place and we will definitely be coming back soon."}
{"text":"The ambiance was awesome, great energy. The coffee I ordered....nastiest thing I've ever tasted. I ordered the nitrogen infused coffee after reading about it online and was excited to try it. The presentation was so cute and it smelled nice. Huge disappointment. I love coffee, especially black coffee and can do without sugar. This coffee however, was just a no. The coffee itself tasted like a burnt pot of coffee that'd been sitting for 2 days. The taste sat with me the whole day and made me a little nauseous. The only thing that I actually enjoyed was my friend's drink which was the Blackberry mocha. I liked the place itself, just not the coffee I ordered. Will try again soon."}
{"text":"Never did get a cup of coffee. The line was so long and was not moving. They need more employees definitely. And no Wi-Fi."}
{"text":"Well as much as I love the concept of this place I didn't have the best cup of coffee. My feelings about this place is in the air still. The decor was very cool! My coffee was not hot at all which I was very disappointed. I was watching the baristas on bar and it didn't seem like they had any kind of flow and seemed like they were doing more stuff than they need to to make a cup. Just seems like another place to be filled with teens/young adults  and mediocre coffee. This place is still fairly new and seems to be working on the menu. I would come here again if I were on that side of town but wouldn't be a destination for me."}
{"text":"+1 star: iced matcha latte with 3 shots of espresso (good)

+1 star: hot butter brew latte (good)

-1 star: hot lavender latte (not good). There's lavender flavor, but coffee taste is not there.

-1 star: iced mint mojito (it's ok). There's real mint leaf for decor, the mint taste like mint surup. Coffee taste is very weak.

-1 star: nuttella frap (it's too sweet, like diabetes drink) such a disgusting overly sweet drink. Even for a 11 years old, he said his drink is too sweet and he doesn't like it. 

This place is overrated. Coffee flavor is not strong, the smell is not all there. Even starbucks coffee taste stronger, better and I'm not even a fan of franchise coffee."}
{"text":"The coffee selection is great and the atmosphere is very cool too (its a Harry Potter-inspired cafe without going overboard on the motif). The problem I have is with the beer selection. 

Yes, Bad Owl Coffee has a beer list too! BUT they don't seem to be doing a good job of keeping up with it. The last two times I've been there they have been out of or stopped offering multiple beers on the menu. Even the bottled brews on display at the counter don't accurately reflect what is available at that moment. Its frustrating when the thing you want is not available that day...its worse when your second or third choices are not available either, and its downright annoying when you go back the following week to find that nobody fixed the problem.

I know that there aren't many coffee shops that also have a beer list, and the beers they do have available are pretty good. But if you're going to be a coffee shop that also offers beer, don't half-ass it. Either maintain your inventory and update your menus, or just don't offer beer at all and stick to the coffee. I'd give this place 5 stars otherwise."}
{"text":"This is where you go if you want to be treated badly by hipsters too young to club. The coffee is overpriced but they'll ignore you for free."}
{"text":"Nice little hangout more for locals as there is not too much seating. Harry Potter fans don't get to excited there are a for cool things in there as you might see the sorting hat up on the back wall!  But just  another coffee place with a few themed items, butter beer latte was good and they do have food but was there for the coffee."}
{"text":"My niece and I were so excited for the Potter themed spot but its small, regulars take up all the seats and overpriced."}
{"text":"I'm not a coffee drinker. I am; however, a huge Harry Potter fan and there was a Groupon. We made the drive out even though we live all the way across town and I really wish this place was closer to us because I loved it. The decor is super cute (I had to explain a few things to my mom Harry Potter bf) and the service was very friendly. I loved the Butter Brew Latte (omg the owl) and the sandwich we got (Wizard Meltdown I think it was called) was delicious. I may start making excuses to come out this way just so I can stop back in!"}
{"text":"Well....the coolest thing about this place was the 30 minutes of fame I felt sitting next to the poorly painted, cheesy prop owl and luggage rack. Everyone that came through the door thought it was just the coolest thing they had ever seen and had to have a photo of it. So here is where I felt like Lady Gaga in the flash of the paparazzi. Anyways, the wait was long the aroma smelt of burnt coffee beans and when the highly anticipated coffee product arrived to our table my expectations were let down. The pistachio nut latte tasted like cheap amaretto coffee creamer with a hint of potpourri and the mocha latte made Tru Moo taste like Godiva! Not a fan of the place, decor, wait, price or product. Will not recommend or return :-P"}
{"text":"Awesome place! Love it here! Only reason it is a 4 instead of a 5 is bc it is a little pricey for sandwiches BUT their ingredients are fresh!!! So you will have to be the judge but you won't disappointed."}
{"text":"Quickly becoming a favorite for my husband and I. Moderately priced menu with lots of options. The staff is very friendly and great at explaining new things and helping with options. Cool Hogwarts theme and cozy little tables. It is a bit crowded and it can be a wait to get your order. New place and very popular so you can't count it against them, they do a good job keeping up. I'm a fan of the nitro coffee and my husband loves the Black Forest."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem! They have a rewards program which is a huge plus and every time I go there my drinks and food are consistent unlike other coffee shops. The ambiance is very relaxing and the baristas are always so friendly. This is my absolute favorite coffee/tea shop and I would go there everyday if I could."}
{"text":"Love this place My sister took me here when I was visiting from Socal The food is healthy and the Lavender Latte was my favorite"}
{"text":"Super cute place. Love Harry Potter theme. It's wonderful. Coffee was good, but I had higher expectations with it. Hopefully it gets better. I would want to hang out here more often than not still."}
{"text":"This place is great!! Fun and adorable cafe to work alone or to hang out with friends. It really has everything you need -- beautiful lattes, yummy treats, savory light bites. THEY EVEN HAVE BEER! And for seating there are counters with stools as well as more traditional bistro tables. Staff is nice. Good music that's chill but upbeat (the Cure, Sam Cook, alt/indie rock plus other more eclectic classics). The Harry Potter theme is a creative and cute bonus that transports you out of real life. Come check it out and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Amazing place are drinks where amazing employees were very helpful helpful  and friendly if you love Harry Potter you will love this place so cute"}
{"text":"Love coming in here and enjoying great crafted coffee. Great place to enjoy great coffee and conversation."}
{"text":"What's not to love? It's Harry Potter-inspired and the service behind the counter is friendly and timely. I tried the Nutella coffee drink and I will say it was the best I've had. I've tried the flavor at a couple other coffee shops and it just is never great. This one was! Not too sweet and still tasted like coffee.

The only thing is how busy this place gets. It's great to see, however, it affects little things like wiping down tables in between guests - which you might have to do yourself - and overflowing trash. Although the place was generally clean, we wanted to jump on a table because there was a good amount of people there. (Monday afternoon.) It was a situation where when one person gets up to leave, you pounce on a table if you want it! Time it right - definitely don't visit here on a weekend if you're in a hurry!

While you're here, try the macaroons - yummy! Also, word to the wise: Don't sit by the tables right near Platform 9 3/4. You will probably be in many a stranger's photo.

Accio coffee!"}
{"text":"First, I love the coffee. Second, the baristas are amazing. Third, the food is great. I was nervous about coming here the first time because I'm not a huge Harry Potter fan. I love that the Harry Potter theme is not overdone. I actually appreciate the decor. The woodwork done by Rick's Wood Rehab is pretty amazing too!"}
{"text":"Coffee is damn good. There is ample seating. Staff is polite and upbeat. There is room to grow the  vibe, however. Blasting the radio makes it tough for me to be in there more than 10 minutes. The jingles are absolutely ear splitting. I couldn't even escape with my headphones. Turn down the music and put on a playlist or Pandora or something."}
{"text":"Got the hot pistachio latte four times from here and each time it was different the last time was with my brother from another mother Jay next door to them,  today it was very weak tasted watery, I believe once when I got this in the past it had crushed pistachios in it and the last three times it didn't."}
{"text":"The line is insane. Like 24-people-deep insane. But if you can stomach the wait, the ambiance is awesome - Harry Potter everywhere! - And the drinks are great. I had the nitrogen cold brew coffee and the lavender latte. Both delicious. Lavender latte tasted like the coffee version of a London fog. Soft and soothing. The nitrogen cold brew coffee, however, was truly special. It tasted like coffee, but smoother. No bite. And with the creamy, no fizz, satisfying taste of a nitrogen beer. A true experience. Worth $4. Ps if you're gonna wait in the looooong line you might as well get more than one coffee drink!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite new coffee spots in the Vegas area. The quality of the coffee is very good, the service fast and friendly. I haven't had coffee this good since I was last in the Pacific Northwest. The decor is nice, and I'm told that it has a Harry Potter theme (I have no idea, as I'm not a fan, but I sort of recognize the font on the tables). I wish they opened a little earlier so I could hit it first thing in the morning."}
{"text":"Kyoto Cold Brew is Life! I thought Aeropress was the love of my life...then I met Kyoto!

Very good place to come hang out with friends, relax, enjoy a book, or work remote from your office.

Good selection of coffee shop music, yummy pastries and exceptional coffee!"}
{"text":"A quick drive away from my work this place has definitely becoming my go to place for my morning pick me up. Not expensive at all, basing my price range on the size and price range of Starbucks. Personal favorites include the Black Forest Mocha and Biscoff Cookie Latte. More n the sweet side, but you get that coffee kick, They also have a Mint Mojito Iced Coffee, similar to Philz Coffee back home in the Bay, definitely hits the spot. I'm also a chocolate croissant fiend, and the ones they have are soft and buttery and with just enough chocolate. My next coffee taste bud adventure will be the butter beer latte or the Blackberry White Mocha. Can't wait for my next trip over there!

The decor is adorable, and definitely for those in love with the world of Harry Potter. Service is always quick, and friendly. I love the sayings that are on the tables, and the white owl in the corner brings it all together. Quiet place in the mornings, great for quick coffee meet ups, some studying. 

This muggle approves."}
{"text":"I was visiting my family in Las Vegas and met my aunt here for coffee. What a delight! The shop was spotless, the staff friendly and inviting. Asked the person taking my order for a recommendation and was not disappointed. Will definitely be coming back! Plus, I'm a sucker for latte art :)"}
{"text":"Been here a few times and every time it is amazing. The food is Delicious and they have a variety of coffee and food.They have savory and sweet for everything. The vibe is nice and the music is not super loud its nice background music.I recommend this place to anyone who wants a yummy breakfast or lunch in a not so crowded place."}
{"text":"This coffee shop is amazing!! My wife and I stopped by here on our way home from Nevada, thinking it would be a quick grab and go but once we got inside we knew we had to stay longer.

The coffee shop is themed off of Harry Potter but has been open long before the first movie. They have clever names, \"magic spells\" all over, and even some spells written on the tables.

The drinks were not lacking either and everyone inside was very friendly. We can't wait to come back here again and try more magic drinks!"}
{"text":"Customer service is great. Their excited to work and have the right attitude .They also have small section of bake goods."}
{"text":"We are from out of town and around 8:45pm on Friday night we showed up. Google says it's open until 10pm on weeknights. Door hours said closed at 5pm all 7 days of the week. Doors were locked with employees inside just standing around laughing. Why would employees be there almost 4 hours after close? Having a late night \"meeting?\" It sure didn't look like it. We were not the only people who had shown up either, another woman was trying to get in as well. After planning out our whole day with this being our last stop we were very disappointed. Huge Potter fans."}
{"text":"This is a small coffee shop, but the coffee is delicious. I got the Kyoto cold brew and it did not disappoint. Cool decor with minor Harry Potter pieces in it. Definitely a must try if you are in the area! I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I went  to Bad Owl Coffee for the first time today with high expectations and was sadly disappointed. I ordered a drink and was given the wrong size, the barista kindly accepted fixed the mistake. When I was given the correct size the server had an air of self entitlement, which is probably why she is stuck in the back making drinks and not at the register. The drinks were good and there was a lot of diversity, but it's nothing that knocked my socks off. They don't do refills for house coffee, which was shocking, since most places do (even if there is a minimal fee). It was a little bit more on the pricey side. Personally as a Harry Potter fan, I was happy with the subtle accents of memorabilia. The one thing about the shop was that the temperature inside was hot. Would maybe go again to try another drink, but probably not."}
{"text":"Somehow these guys managed to get really good quality coffee among the catchy-fad theme. 

I had an espresso and the Kyoto cold brew. Cold brew was incredibly mild and clean and the espresso had so much going on. 

Also had a wrap that was great. 

If you're looking for quality coffee you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"So, when my social media exploded with news of a Harry Potter themed coffee place opening in Las Vegas NV literally days before I was to be in sin city, I had to add it to my itinerary.  
The line out the door testified to the success of the blitz marketing campaign.  Bad Owl Coffee had been open for exactly two weeks and there was a line out the door.  Good sign, right?

While we waited, we took a look to evaluate the Harry Potter-ness of the place.  There was a really really nifty metallic owl sculpture on the counter.  I'd have been happy to take that home and put it in my office.  A brick wall in the back with a Hogwarts Express sign.  Beyond that, a wooden direction sign back near the restrooms likely had familiar destinations, but I never actually got close enough to confirm that. The tables had themed words and symbols etched into them, pretty cool.  Definitely not in-your-face Harry Potter, but enough to claim a theme.  Fans will be pleased.

We made it to the front.  I was curious about the Butterbrew latte, particularly since it was the only drink on the menu that that gave a nod to the theme that had been so highly hyped in all the press.  Well, okay, they did offer a lavender latte, and there is a Lavender Brown character in HP.  I suppose I should give them that, too. Other than that, a typical menu of the same old  hot and cold coffee drinks and some nice teas.  
Okay, back to the front of the line.  I asked how long they'd been open.  \"weeks\", was the one-word response.  I don't know how, but she made \"weeks\" sound vague. Wow, I've been at new eateries and coffeeshops bunches of times, and they can usually tell you the day they opened.  They're  proud and excited and pumped. Clearly not the case with this young lady.  Fine, maybe she's had a long day.  I can sympathize with fatigue.  

So I let it go and inquired \"What flavor do you put in the Butterbrew latte? Butterscotch?  Or something else?.\"   \"Butterbrew is butterscotch and a secret flavor I cannot reveal.\" The response was flat, as if she'd answered that question a thousand times already.  She probably had,  but hey, every customer right now is still brand new. If you're already bored with it, then why am I here?   The shine of all that promotion was beginning to tarnish.

Of course I ordered the Butterbrew latte - that was why we'd come.  I told her I prefer my drinks not so sweet and asked for half the typical syrup.  She replied that there drinks weren't too sweet.  Okaaaay.  Then she asked, I kid you not, if I wanted the espresso shots in my drink.  I am taken aback.  What? Aren't their lattes made with espresso?  Well, yes, she explained, but sometimes we leave the shots out for children.  Excuse me?  I'm a middle aged woman and my companion was 20 years my senior.  Children?  Yes, of course I wanted the espresso shots in my latte. By now I am as close to speechless as anyone has ever seen me.  As we turn to the next spot to pay, she rolls her eyes.  Apparently she thinks un-hip women over the age of 22 who want espresso in their espresso drinks are blind as well as overly demanding.  Wow.

I loved that they had a chip-reader that worked - so many businesses are still working on that.  I didn't love that I was charged $2.00 more than the price on the menu.  Are coffee taxes that high in Las Vegas?  By now my companion was uncomfortable with the noise level and was eager to escape the chaos, so I just skipped the option to tip between 15 and 30 percent and signed the tablet.  I glanced at the tip jar, which contained three five dollar bills.  No change, no singles.  Five. Dollar. Bills.  Seriously?

My 12-second old latte was lukewarm.  I cannot taste the secret ingredient.  I cannot taste the espresso, though I saw them put it in there.  I can not taste any secret ingredient. I can taste butterscotch syrup.  Lots and lots and lots of butterscotch syrup.  Maybe it needed a mix.  I swirled the cup, took another sip.  Even more cloying.

For the first time in my life, ever, I threw away a six and a half dollar coffee drink.

So, final take?  The decor is as Harry Potterish as they can be without violating Disney copyrights, I suppose.  The butterscotch concoction is a nod to fans, but poorly executed.  The price is high, the coffee isn't that good. And apparently customers who aren't young and hip and extra attractive need not wander in. 

Good luck, Bad Owl Coffee."}
{"text":"I was not impressed by Bad Owl's coffee. It was basically an average cup of coffee! It was really cute inside with different sayings from Harry Potter on the tables. This is a nice place for studying and hanging out with friends. I really wished the coffee was better!"}
{"text":"The decor is splendid and the baristas are \"magical\" (forgive the pun). Honestly Bad Owl Coffee is a great place to go if you're ever in need of a creativity boost or just a nice place to meet up with friends. The drinks are unique and always up to par. The only complaint I have is the food. Each time I have ordered food, it has been quite dry and I end up throwing most of it away. I will continue to come back, however, because I'm addicted to the iced mint mocha and the baristas' radiant personalities."}
{"text":"It's a cute place, the Harry Potter hype is a bit much since it's just a lot of HP references in the names but everything is good and prices are fair for the quality."}
{"text":"Their butter beer latte doesn't come with espresso. I get it (but I don't because it's a coffee house). The layering of the latte required me to mix it myself (there's a first for everything) bit it's simply bc I'm not a fan of syrup on the bottom, then milk, the espresso on top in a distinct layered fashion (they were in a hurry and trying to be timely but a nice stirred not shaken would have been super). I also wanted to enjoy my drink there in a cute mug but didn't get the option of the mug, they put it in a to go cup. Also didn't care for how the tipping worked- everyone up in yo business and can see your pin code (giant number pad). Their 12 oz is equivalent to a Tall Starbucks (no caffeine buzz for me today). I got an overpriced coconut muffin at $3. I sat outside because it's a nice day and it's cold in the coffee house but there were smokers and really not a thuper nice outdoor atmosphere. Happy I came to check the place out but it's whatevs."}
{"text":"This place is wonderful. Great service and great coffee. I cannot wait to comeback for lunch. This is the lavender latte that I ordered, delicious!"}
{"text":"New spot for coffee in Henderson~ interesting decor...I am told its for Harry Potter fan....I didn't get that vibe tho, but I am NOT an HP DEVOTEE!
    The coffee was good, not great however they do offer cold Brew, next time I am in the area I will try it. 
    Servers very nice & friends however they do need to speed up service. Maybe they just got overwhelmed, the day i visited!,"}
{"text":"I like the idea of the Harry Potter theme. I ordered the nitrogen brew and it was served in a plastic cup and not a pint glass. I've had nitrogen brews at other places before and it is always explained to me at the coffee houses it is like a Guinness. Well, I've never had a Guinness in plastic cup always in a pint glass. The nitrogen brew would settle better in a pint glass."}
{"text":"Not a bad cup of coffee. A little overpriced, a little too small, but not bad. Nice employees and nice speciality drinks. Also the theme is fun but seems to be lacking in some areas, including the menu.

Coffee: 3.5/5
Price : 4/5
Employees : 4/5"}
{"text":"The first couple times I came here I was very impressed by the theme of the coffee shop, decorations, and the proximity of this place from my house. After coming for the third time, I realized the reality of Bad Owl Coffee.

The Drinks: 2/5
The first time I came to Bad Owl I decided to try to Butter Beer Latte and see what all of the hype was about. I was very disappointed with the Butter Beer Latte. First off, the price is ridiculous. For a 12 oz it's $4.40 and for a 16 oz. it is $4.90 which isn't too bad, but the cashier asked if I wanted espresso in it. Which I thought was strange because ALL lattes have espresso in them. That is what a latte is, espresso and milk. I was thrown off guard by his question, but just thought that maybe people don't like it with espresso. I told the cashier I wanted espresso in it and he charged me $1 more for the espresso. Which added up to $5.40 plus tax which came out to almost $6. I was in shock by how expensive it was. I got my drink and was dissatisfied with it. It was ridiculously sweet and I couldn't even taste the espresso. It just tasted like milk and syrup. 

The second time I came to Bad Owl was because I was convinced to give them a second shot. I tried the English Toffee Latte this time and It was good, but a bit too sweet. It was $3.95 for a small and $4.95 for a large.

The Staff: 3/5
I think it depends on when you go, but it's a hit or miss with the staff. They're either really nice and friendly or they don't want to be bothered. It's mostly the young high school looking workers that have an attitude where they don't want to be bothered. 

Overall:
The decorations are cute and all, but the place is really small and it is overpriced. I think there are many other coffee places you can go to without paying an arm and a leg for coffee."}
{"text":"Line went out the door and into the parking lot.  The place is decorated nicely paying homage to the Harry Potter novels however not all the staff were familiar with the characters so when we placed our orders using names from the novels, Bellatrix, (Moaning) Myrtle, Dobby etc, the spelling was incorrect or not pronounced correctly.  It took away from the experience.  
The drinks were well made and not too sweet considering the variety of sweet sounding menu items.  They could have been a little more creative with naming the drinks and desserts using more references to Harry Potter.  The only reference was the Butterbrew which they had ran out of by mid afternoon so we couldn't try it.  I had the Biscoff latte instead and it was perfect.
Check the place out but let some of the hype die down first."}
{"text":"I may be a little biased because I love Harry Potter, but I adore this place. It's so cute; they have amazing coffee, food, and such a helpful staff."}
{"text":"We like this cool vibe coffee hang out.  Good pastries and unique coffees.  The lattes are vast.  I had the almond latte and it had bits of almonds in it.  Be ready.  The biscoff is made with cookie spread.  Good for a big booty.  Tasty though!  We will come back repeatedly. 

Our next visit will be for the Kyoto cold press coffee and nitrogen cold coffee."}
{"text":"I love this coffee shop. I've had a variety of different coffee drinks and everything has been great. I also really like their selections of iced tea. As for food, I switch off between avocado toast and the almond butter toast. I can't decide which one is better! I've moved away from Henderson but I still consistently make the drive to this spot."}
{"text":"Roasted almond latte is soooooo Good and makes you feel great! I'm from out of town but will definitely come here every time I'm in this area!"}
{"text":"My hubs & I have been meaning to try this place for awhile... so today was the day.  We walked in and it was packed & surprisingly tiny.  I ordered the avocado toast and to my disappointment, they didn't have just regular drip coffee.  I like simple coffee, not the foo-foo, sugar filled drinks.  So I settled for the V60 Brazilian pour over.  My husband ordered just an espresso shot.  

When I saw the price for a pour over, I already decided I wouldn't be returning unless the taste was absolutely amazing; it was close to $4 for a small cup.

As we waited for our order, I looked around at the place.  They clearly didn't have enough workers for the day.  Several tables hadn't been cleared off of garbage for over 20 minutes and the trash was filled to the brim (it stayed that way the whole time we were there).  The bar top we got stuck sitting at was filthy, had spills, stickiness and food crumbs.

When we finally got our order, it was 25 minutes later!!!  25 minutes for a damn cup of coffee; the food came out earlier.  My toast was decent and the coffee had a good taste to it.  With that being said, the cons far outweighed the pros.  The price, long wait, limited seating & overall dirtiness of the place allowed me to mark this place on my list as a 'one and done.'"}
{"text":"I finally managed to go here with my siblings after a student-worker gave me a heads-up about this Harry Potter-themed coffee spot opened up. 
We went around 10am, and that was a decent amount of time before the place got crowded around 11am. Not kidding - there was a line from the register to the front door. 
The staff was all friendly, but you can tell that everyone was still trying to find a groove, especially when business picked up. Really patient too like when you're trying to decide what to order or need a flavor recommendation. Of course, I thought the setting was cute and appropriate. As for the food...
Definitely liked the Apricot Croissant/Danish, the chips that came with the siblings' breakfast sandwiches. The sister had this Roast Beef sandwich (Rosemary Foccacia bread with an Aioli spread), and that was yummy. Definitely enjoyed the bread. The brother had this kinda Ham and Cheese, and our fave part was the Artichoke Hearts and Tomatoes. 
Drinkwise, we would definitely drive 5 minutes away from the Starbucks in the same plaza to come here. I had a Biscoff Latte that tasted exactly like the cookie! The brother enjoyed his Matcha Latte, and my sister honestly liked their Lavender Latte. Next time, I'll give their Butterbeer Latte a try, even though it doesn't have a shot of espresso."}
{"text":"great tasting espresso, love the environment, very chill and relaxing, conveniently located, prices are great"}
{"text":"Being a coffee geek/enthusiast, my first instinct is to try just a plain cup of black coffee, hot or iced. It's best to try it black to fully taste the coffee; it's easier to taste the quality that way. My best friend is a Harry Potter fan so of course this was a must go for our Friday Night Adventures. We waited about 45 minutes in line and about an hour total by the time our drinks were ready...we totally 100% expected a wait because of how much coverage and buzz this place was getting all over Facebook, IG, Twitter, etc. 

My BFF got an iced vanilla latte, my other BFF got a jade mint tea, and I was going for an iced coffee. Get up to the register, and come to find out they they're not serving anything that's made via drip. I was a little disappointed at that so I went ahead and settled for a black Americano. I was VERY empresses by the quality of the espresso. Very strong! I love authentic, manual espresso.  The lighting fixtures were a super nice touch to the look of the place, baristas were very friendly, and the music was different, not exactly what you'd expect in a coffee shop. Taylor Swift?? Really?? Ugh, annoyinggggg! 

I definitely would like to go back again and try a few different things. The lavender latte, butter beer latte, and the one I'm dying to try, the cookie butter latte. I really hope they extend their hours soon. It would be cool to go back for an evening of Friday Night Adventures with the BFF."}
{"text":"As a huge potterhead, I naturally gravitate towards this amazing cafe! Their butterbrew latte is really tasty, especially when you add in a shot of espresso (patronum! Sorry, I had to). It honestly tastes better than the butterbeer they serve at Wizarding World!"}
{"text":"BOC popped up on the radar a little while back and so it was bookmarked.  The GF is a huge Movie-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named (MWMNBN) fan.  I could not wait to take her when we were visiting or passing through Hendo.  We even planned a stop at the beginning of March before we headed off to Arizona.  That stop did not come to fruition. Maybe it was magic that made this happen. Knowing what I know now...I am so happy.

So on April 1st (ironic), we found ourselves on the southend of the valley.  After running several errands, we decided to pay BOC a visit.  Having heard about the line, we were pleasantly surprised upon pulling into the parking lot and not finding one coming out the door.

After checking in with the handy dandy yelp app, I held the door open for the GF.  She entered and I followed.  Small was the interior and every table was occupied.  Some tables filled with groups and couples chatting.  At the other tables sat lap top campers.  I knew immediately the experience was going to be to go.

I looked at the menu even though I knew I was going to get an iced 20 oz. Butter Brew Latte.  The GF was going for an iced tea.  The service seemed rushed and was not very memorable.  It was the kind of service one would expect from some corporate coffee shops.  After the order was paid for, the GF and I took in atmosphere.  She has read all the MWMNBN books.  She has seen all the MWMNBN movies.  She even requested I see all the MWMNBN movies prior to taking her to see the finale.  We chatted about the decor.  Something was amiss and I asked her if BOC was an accurate representation of the MWMNBN.  She stated it contained \"elements.\"

The coffee eventually arrived. The tables remained occupied and a line had formed.  Without delay we were on our way.  I took a sip and found the latte to be super sweet.  I had been previously advised the size contained three shots of espresso. I never felt caffeines glorious effects.  I think I will just wave my wizard stick, cast a spell, and forget the whole thing."}
{"text":"A Harry Potter themed cafe?! Yes please. Also the smoothest coffee I've ever had. Wow."}
{"text":"As a Harry Potter fan I'm in love with this place. The butterbeer late is amazing. The staff is amazing. And the waffles......omg amazing lol. The cafe of my dreams!!!! I wish I could give this place more then 5 stars. The deserve 9 3/4 stars :)"}
{"text":"Fantastic Harry Potter themed coffee shop. Cozy with great tasting coffee, snacks. Wonderful service. I would highly recommend it. Nutella coffee is to die for. I can't get enough of it."}
{"text":"My new favorite coffee shop! Great atmosphere! And if you're a Harry Potter need, you will love the butter beer latte!"}
{"text":"Love this place great coffee and vibes, it is on the strong side though so you might shake a little"}
{"text":"Waited 20 mins for my triple espresso and matcha blend but the place didn't seem busy at all. 
The blonde woman with tattoos who took our order was no smiles and didn't even apologize. 
The girl making drinks was a bit nicer. But she poured me a triple espresso in a shot size cup and when I asked for a to go cup with a lid for driving she gave me a little attitude. Oh well I'm I supposed to chug down triple espresso like tequila? That thing is hot!
Espresso was good but the matcha blend was too sweet."}
{"text":"Not worth all the hype it gained on Facebook. Very minor decor , and very few HP themed items on the menu. Def not worth the drive from Vegas.
I got a butterscotchy something latte and it was good, but very small."}
{"text":"SO. AMAZING. love love love love this place. amazing tasting iced coffee (i got the butterbrew latte w/ added espresso), and a lovely decorated coffee shop!!!! if you love harry potter, THIS is the coffee shop for you!! i, myself, love harry potter, but i'm also a BIG doctor who fan & was SHOCKED when i saw that they had a TARDIS in their shop!!!!! overall amazing & i'm definitely coming here every time i pass through nevada/las vegas! love this place so so so much!!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in for the first time.  The shop itself is very cute, however my hot mocha was almost cold and overpriced.  The design on the top was cute but I don't think we will be returning.  We were not impressed."}
{"text":"I honestly had high expectations for this place but was not wow'd.
I was intrigued and lured in because ... Harry Potter!
The coffee is pretty good and they have a variety of flavors to choose from.
Was disappointed during my visit because they had no butter beer, which was one of the things I wanted to try and reason to come!
I was able to decide on Matcha Green Tea Affogato with Expresso & Salted Cream Nitrogen Brewed Cold Coffee. The affogatos can come with or without the expresso, but having it without defeats the purpose of an affogato! It was good, although it only had the hint of green tea -- would've liked it to have more of that distinct taste and flavor of matcha. The Salted Cream Nitrogen Brewed was interesting. Served cold, in a glass cup. Poured from a spouted barrell, strong foamy coffee, topped with salted cream - definitely a good caffeine kick, but nothing any other coffee shop can't fix.
My sister wasn't too impressed with her Matcha Blended (aka green tea frap), again because there's only a very faint taste of the green tea, she says she's had better.
My sister's husband definitely wasn't impressed with his drink. He got the Mint Mojito Latte. Every sip (with and without straw) contained big chunks of mint leaves, it was hard to taste the coffee itself. I don't know if it maybe wasn't muddle right or maybe too much leaves in general, but I don't think anyone would enjoy drinking leaves.
Love the decor details and theme though (ie. the full series of books, the table writings, the owl, etc), and because again, Harry Potter!"}
{"text":"I wish I could like this place, I really do. It's cute, service is good, but it's not enough to come back.

We got this coconut latte drink, and the more you drank it, the more it tasted like sunscreen. There are coconut beverages out there that taste like natural coconut, this wasn't one of them. 

I got the matcha affogato and it looked appealing but it didn't taste right. The matcha sauce was off somehow and the ice cream under it clashed, so while we thought it was vanilla, we realized it couldn't have been. 

I decided to give it a third shot and ordered a lavender latte. I drink many lavender drinks, caffeine and alcohol. One of my go to drinks is a London fog, I drink a lot of tea and coffee in general. So this lavender latte was different, it was a coffee latte with what I'm guessing was some lavender extract, the flavors did not blend well at all. I kept drinking it hoping it would get better, but it got worse the more I kept trying to force it.  This is partially my fault for not asking if this were a tea latte or an espresso one, but at the same time I've seen places put together some really weird combos and pull it off where the flavors complement each other.  I think this drink could be improved as a lavender tea latte.

Something we considered was the fact that we kept trying to order fancy things off the menu that sounded intriguing and played off the things we already liked. Their normal, non fancy, drinks might actually be alright. I kind of wish I tried something simple like a vanilla latte or a cappuccino to try this place out, since it was new to us. But 3 out of 3 orders were discarded instead of finished, despite our best efforts.

As for the decor, for a themed coffee shop it feels minimal. There are some nice touches, there is even a tardis door which was adorable (and unrelated), but I know some friends who are hardcore into the Harry Potter fandom who've decorated their own homes with more memorabilia.  If I hadn't known this was an HP themed coffee shop before walking in I wouldn't have known at first glance. I would have gotten it after ordering, sitting down, and looking around for a few minutes and then going ohhh. I don't know if there are copyright rules holding the shop back, but even displaying consumer available merch would help the theme go a lot further. Also, there was no inside seating so we sat at one of the two tables outside, which wasn't so bad on that particular day, but we just reached triple digit heat this week as I write this.  The place seems popular with students, or some groups of teenagers / young 20 somethings squatting in decent sized groups for a decent period of time while sipping drinks. More seating would be helpful to account for them.

1 star for coffee, 1 star for theme, it's the service that got it to 3. 

I live on the opposite side of town. There's really no reason for me to come back, or stop by if I'm visiting the east side. Really, we wanted to like this place more.  I'm hoping they see this review and consider these points, I hope they can implement some changes to improve their drinks more than anything, and maybe I'll give it another shot later in the future."}
{"text":"I came here specifically for the coffee, and after going back and forth and trying out different drinks, and different ways to have them, I finally found one that I really liked.  

Lavender latte, at first was waay too milky tasting. As with the other drinks I tried. Almost gave up, till  barista fam from another coffee shop suggested I try an add shot and change the milk choice.  Well that worked!  Tastes better with soy.. my issue is paying 6.98 for the smallest size cup.  Granted it's a specialty drink, but I pay that much for my healthy smoothie! 

Service is friendly, the staff works as a quick as they can. But as far as making drinks right, it's still inconsistent.  Tonight they forgot to put  the shot of lavender in my lavender latte! The owner is gracious enough to have drinks remade, but this time I didn't realize til we drove off.. sigh. 

Harry Potter inspired is the attraction here. My kids were big HP fans.  Me not so much..I'm just an old lady.  I just don't have a clue what smuggles are, and have no clue why almost every other customer takes a pic with the owl, but it's so cute to see all the excitement over this shop. Will it be enough in the long run? I hope so, cause right now the coffee ain't cutting it for me."}
{"text":"The butterbrew latte has a very delicious unique flavor. It was tasty and not too sweet."}
{"text":"Harry Potter theme. Menu unique and very tasty.  Avocado toast awesome. Toasted almond latte rich and flavorful."}
{"text":"I was thoroughly disappointed in the decor. I expected a Harry Potter themed coffee spot but instead its more of a sprinkling of Harry Potter related stuff here and there. I felt they just put up the minimum amount of HP decor so they could name the place bad owl. They could have pushed the HP theme way further and really made it stand out. O and there is a tardis...

I had the iced lavender latte which was very good but the serving was small for the price. The food is way over priced ($10 for a grilled cheese). I will most likely not return to the bad owl."}
{"text":"This is my favorite coffee joint in Henderson - because who doesn't love a Harry Potter themed coffee joint?! While the pricing is higher than most, the atmosphere and quality of drinks and food makes up for it. The baristas were super helpful with recommendations of drinks and differences when comparing one drink to another. Definitely pick up some avocado toast too while you're here - that was my favorite part!"}
{"text":"I was disappointed. I was expecting something more than a butterscotch latte,  which I can get at Starbucks or any other coffee shop. My brother went to Orlando Harry Potter world and told me that the butter beer there was amazing.  I was looking to be blown away. Nope. We drove from West Las Vegas. It's quite a way. I am a huge fan of HP. I feel like HP is a story that people of all ages loved. I felt like we were too old for the vibe there. Probably our perception."}
{"text":"I don't come here for the Harry Potter theme. I haven't even seen any of the movies. What I come here for is the Nitro! Best in town hands down."}
{"text":"Bad Owl coffee is probably one of my favorite coffee shops around town. It is quite unique with its Harry Potter theme which includes the interior and menu items. Very magical. The Butterbeer latte is absolutely delicious and so are the food choices. 
I've also had their Nutella latte which is also pretty good. The atmosphere is very relaxed and invites all types of people. Everyone that works there is very friendly and also with smiles on their faces."}
{"text":"This place has a great concept. 
I didn't like the face that my coffee was served in a plastic cup. 
Their food tastes good but it is not worth the money you pay for it. 
However I do suggest to go there for a nitro infused cold brew since not a lot of coffee shops have it."}
{"text":"Accio coffee! Made it by for soft-opening weekend and I love how well they executed the Harry Potter theme without making it gimmicky. I think playing the soundtrack would be a fun touch, but that might be overkill. Service was friendly and I like the fun menu options for butterbeer, lavender, pistachio, and grapefruit-ginger flavored lattes. They also have a pour over and nitro cold brew options for those who fancy themselves coffee purists. 

I tried the iced mint mojito latte and found it less strong and more milky than I'd expected- didn't quite hit the spot for my Philz craving, but will definitely pop by again to see how they improve as they settle in. Oh, and no need to use your Wingardium Leviosa spell- they'll bring your drink to your table when it's ready!

They currently have a few pastry options and croissants to munch on, hoping they add a food menu as time goes on: pumpkin pasties, anyone?! Mischief managed. ;)"}
{"text":"I so wanted to love this place, I mean its got the Tardis and owls everywhere...I love me some owls and Doctor Who, though the original series more than the new one they have now...I am off track...  ;)

It was alright, busy...

Went in there with a new friend I had met here in town, she wanted the pistacio Latte and told me I can get most drinks Veganized since I am transitioning (again) to Veganism.    

I ordered a Vegan version of butterbrew I believe it was called but told the girl I had never been there and she said, great, welcome, so far a good start...she asked what size I wanted and I said large and she said, this cup?   or this one?   I said, that one-The larger one...ok so then she asked if I wanted espresso?   I said, sure...?     Im new, I dont know...she nodded..

So...It was $14 for 2 drinks, I looked at the reciept after I left, I was charged $1 extra for the espresso...another $1 extra for the larger cup...Its fine but could she have told me this?    The drink is $4.90 but there is an extra charge for this cup and an extra charge for this espresso?    

I feel taken advantage of a bit since she knew I was new and didnt know how it all worked.   The coffee was OK--Nothing special and my friend Susan did not like her drink either which was made with milk so it wasn't because they were Vegan drinks, only mine was...she said it had no real strong flavor, I am sure that would have been another $1 charge to get some real flavor in there.

So...thats crossed off the list."}
{"text":"Bad Owl Coffee is always a spot I bring my visitors to, just because it's Harry Potter themed and does justice for an Instagram op. ¯\_(?)_/¯ 

The espresso drink selection is excellent. I love their Lavender Latte, but the MUST TRY item is the Butter Beer Latte (hello, Harry Potter, you just have to!) Their food is also really good, it's just too pricey for me. The sandwiches are served with a salad and a handful of kettle chips. 

There is a lot of tables and chairs for you to hang out or do some work, but most of the times I've been there, it was too crowded and freakin busy (good for them though.) The ambiance of the place is really nice as well; not only are you surrounded with everything Harry Potter, but they use natural light during the day. 

Two thing I wasn't too happy with is the volume of the music they play in the coffee shop and parking is a pain. Each time I've visited, the music was so loud I was practically yelling just to talk to the person next to me. The lot maybe big, but since every time I pay a visit it's busy, the lot designated for Bad Owl is always full.

Bad Owl is worth it though. If you're visiting Vegas and you're a Harry Potter fan, drive over to the coffee shop and enjoy a cup of Butterbeer. :D"}
{"text":"Prices are really high. Food was good, but not great value for the money. Try the waffle and the espresso."}
{"text":"Love the Harry Potter theme that's isn't over the top :) 
I'm not a huge coffee drinker so I typically order my cream with a side of coffee  so I went with the iced Nutella Latte. Wasn't able to taste as much Nutella as I'd like, but hey don't take my word for it. I'm a baby when it comes to coffee ! 
They also have a beer menu (fyi) 

Tons of different seating for the interior from a center bar to tables + chairs. 
Since it is in Henderson, I wouldn't make my way out specifically for this place, but if I were in the area I'd be down to try something else on the menu. 

If it were close enough, it'd be a chill place to get some studying done !"}
{"text":"Delicious food, delicious tea, knowledgeable staff and a super fun theme. The music is a little loud but not hard to have a conversion over."}
{"text":"I come every time I'm in town for work...for the avocado toast. The coffee is good too, but ricotta avo toast is where it's at! They have pastries and other breakfast and lunch items too."}
{"text":"Never mind the fact that this place is a Harry Potter fan's dream (that alone is worthy of 5 stars) but the food is beyond magical. The different selection of brews and food puts this cafe above everything. Highly recommend the Avocado toast with butter brew latte or biscoff latte. 

What a cool place!"}
{"text":"With all the hype I expected more from a place that is Harry Potter themed.  Decorations are minimal, I at least expected the house banners, perhaps some of the movie posters.  It reminded me of Spot Coffee out east only smaller.  The salted caramel iced coffee was good but comparable to others I had before, only smaller for the same price.  The pesto chicken sandwich I ordered was decent and certainly filling.  The meal cost me $15 (inc. coffee) not a place I would frequent.  It has its appeal, a nice place to work on papers or projects but a little cramped."}
{"text":"The decorations are high quality, but they don't try and overdo it. Atmosphere is nice and so are the drinks."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. Tried the waffles, which included a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Thought it was odd at first, but it totally works! Dessert for breakfast!"}
{"text":"Roasted Almost iced latte with almond milk... I die it was so good!! I was a little surprised by the price $5+ but I drank it and within the first half sip realized it wasn't roasted almond syrup.. IT WAS ACTUAL ALMOND IN THERE! tasted like an almond croissant.. in liquid form. So so so recommend. I am not  a potterhead.. but the theme was not overwhleming.. very cute. I shop at TJS every Saturday  (same  parking lot).. will be my weekend coffee stop!"}
{"text":"Went to this place to break free of coffee monopoly.  Neat theme friendly staff good coffee nice ambience (if you are into Harry Potter)"}
{"text":"Two times in a row! First visit was great that I just had to come back as soon as I could. But today, the lady named Sue who helped us did not seem happy to see and help her customers. With our purchase of coffee, we asked if we could all also get cups of water, you'd think she'll remember that, but we had to get up and ask for the cups of water again. Once MORE, we had to suffer her snooty attitude. This made us feel uncomfortable even more AND WE'RE THE PAYING CUSTOMERS AND IT SHOULD NOT BE LIKE THAT. After the good experience that we had here yesterday, this girl was ready to ruin that for us. But we were not going to allow Sue to ruin a good day. We did some running around today with the little sister from San Diego and after we found ourselves in need of some relaxation from the day's shenanigans, we decided to come again. 
There are more patrons here today and the music being played is from a vast of selections. The Harry Potter theme is a good touch & so different from the typical cafe decors around town. It's still a good place to visit IF SUE WERE NOT WORKING HER SHIFT WHEN YOU ARRIVE. 
Apart from the unhappy service that Sue gave us, it's still a good experience, although that little issue could be easily remedied by teaching Sue to be happier."}
{"text":"Although the theme of this coffee shop is very charming and appealing to Harry Potter fans (yes, I am one of them). The coffee is meh. 

My husband and I stopped in to check out the \"Harry Potter Coffee Shop\" as everyone calls it. We were excited but also skeptical that the hype had perhaps gotten our hopes up a bit too high. Well, the latter was the case. 

Although the decor did not disappoint the witch in me, the actual product was sub-par. The famed Butter-beer flavored drink was more caramel than anything else and the nitro brew was just, okay. We waited a very long time for our drinks and we were the only ones waiting, which seemed odd. 

Other than that, there is a very small amount of seating in the place, and usually it's populated by teenagers (understandably so). 

I would say, check this place out for yourself if you are a major Harry Potter but, but if you could take or leave the Wizarding World theme, I would possibly head somewhere else."}
{"text":"This coffee shop is okay, amongst other coffee shops they use arabica beans (the good stuff) but when I had tasted their 20% off iced drink on a Monday--it was almost bland. It was missing a kick to it and in the middle of my meeting I yawned! This place is also pricey my bill came out to $13.06 with the ice coffee and the croissant breakfast sandwich that I ordered. At Starbucks I never paid more than $10 for coffee and a sandwich which was almost ridiculously overpriced. The bad owl had a good idea of adding Harry Potter to it but inside I only seen a book shelf filled with Harry Potter books. I really wished the baristas were wearing some kind of hog warts uniform or the cups would at least have a wand as a straw . 

For a Harry Potter fan as huge as I am I guess I didn't see or experienced what I had expected."}
{"text":"This coffee shop is amazing. I got the Spanish latte and it was to die for. The service was fast and the food was amazing. I live 40 minutes away, but I still make the drive to my favorite coffee shop. :) I would just like to say thank you to the staff for the excellent service."}
{"text":"Me and my husband went here For brunch and it was delicious. We had the white lavender mocha and Earl Grey tea to drink. We also had Nutella and banana waffles, the BLT, 2 macaroons, and a beignet. All of it was so good and so amazing. I also love how it's Harry Potter Themed, loving Harry Potter myself. I definitely recommend to anyone that's in the area the food and drinks are amazing and if you love Harry Potter that's an added bonus!"}
{"text":"It's loud. It's dark. It's slow.  Everything is noisy equipment and hard surfaces amplifying noise. Chairs are hard and I watched person after person who came in after me get orders while myself and the three people ahead of me waited on coffees.  They try to say it's about the handcrafting but Mothership handcrafts too and takes half the time with two staff members than Bad Owl does with seven.  Baguette cafe takes less time and their two staff members have a whole hot and cold menu to produce as well as coffee.  

After nine minutes wait for an iced coffee it came warm and tasted mostly of milk.  I'm pretty sure I got charged extra for my coffee to actually have coffee but I sure as hell don't taste it anywhere in the drink.  And the price is much higher than just about anywhere else.  

Sure it's Potter themed but a good coffee shop it is not."}
{"text":"I came here with a group of friends who love Harry Potter, since it is a Harry Potter themed coffee shop. I expected it to be blatantly HP decorated, but the decor wasn't overpowering. If you know Harry Potter then you will definitely recognize all the accents throughout the shop. Platform 9 6/8, dementors, letters from Hogwarts, writing on the tables, etc. It still feels like a cool coffee shop if you aren't an HP fanatic, which I appreciate. The inside is dark and has lots of wood accents to give it a cool vibe. There are small and large tables to accommodate all sizes of groups. 

They have a wide variety of food and drink available. Mojito coffee? They have it. v60 brews? Check. Protein pucks and pastry snacks? Of course! The staff was very friendly and patiently waited for our group to order. I had the v60 coffee since I'm a big fan. It was decently priced and tasted good, but not great. The mojito drink has mint leaves in it, which my friend did't enjoy since it was difficult to drink with them inside. Every now and then a whole mint leaf would end up in the straw. If you love mint, it's your drink. If not, I suggest you try one of the other various menu items!"}
{"text":"Oh my gosh- not only awesome wizard themed decor but their food and butter brew are to die for!!! LOVE!!!"}
{"text":"Besides the fact that i am a huge Harry Potter fan... And that this place had been bookmarked on my yelp for months because well...it's related to Harry Potter....... And i love me some coffee.... This place was just your run of the mill coffee joint. Yes they did have nice decor where it referenced Harry Potter... But i guess with all the hype i was expecting it to be too much Harry Potter...as in \"OMG did the movies explode in here?!?!?!\". Honestly, i guess it could have gone either way...too much or too little.... And i think they went with too little... But the little touches that they had that referenced the books were cute. Ambiance (4/5)

Service and flavor... Was actually pretty good. I really didn't have much time as i was in a little hurry... But i did take time to go over the menu and the menu was not gigantic but they had your norms. I originally thought that i was going to get nutella latte... But the barista encouraged me to try the Biscoff and i am so glad i listened to her advice. I got the iced Biscoff latte and it was superb.  If you like Biscoff.... You will definitely love this drink. Service was 5/5... And the flavor of the Biscoff in the latte was a 5/5.... Flavor of the coffee was a 4/5.... Honestly i still have to say that the best iced lattes I've ever had are still at Dutch Bros.... 

If i am ever in the area again... Would i come here... That is most definitely a yes! :)"}
{"text":"Had a great experience @bad owl coffee.... the food was delicious... we ordered casear chix wrap, waffles with ice cream, breakfast crossiant some toast over eggs avocado and balsamic dressing and got butter beer latte for the kids, iced mocha, lavender white mocha, and nutella latte.. the lady who took our order was so patient with us.... we had no idea what to order... anyway...definitely going back... love that it's Harry Potter theme..."}
{"text":"Love their avocado toast and almond iced or hot coffee!!! It comes with actual pieces of almonds!!! I love their atmosphere and the customer service is outstanding!!! It's a little pricey but you get what you pay for!!!"}
{"text":"By far the best coffee shop I've ever been to. My sister and I are locals and come in almost every week because of the amazing drinks, food, and wonderful people. It has such a great community vibe and it's a great place to go with friends or get some work done. The people who work here are as sweet as can be and they make you feel like you are family. They are also brilliant at their jobs, making the best tea, coffee, latte, sandwich, avacado toast - whatever it is - it's delicious! They are very consistent in their excellent service which is part of the reason why my sis and I visit so frequently. Aside from that, if you are a Harry Potter fan, you have to stop in! Bad Owl is decorated with the coolest decor that makes you feel like you are right inside of the books and movies. It's a real treat. Another thing about Bad Owl is the great music! Every time we go in, the playlists are just perfect which makes for an even more amazing atmosphere. Bad Owl is magically, truly. You have to go! I promise you will not regret it."}
{"text":"This was my 2nd time here. The 1st time, I came solely for the fact that it is Harry Potter themed.  I had the Nutella Latte and did not enjoy it. It had very little flavor.  No coffee flavor.  No Nutella flavor. 
Fast forward to today... the world's greatest dog sitter is moving and since we have always wanted to go here together, we made a plan to meet and have some HP themed coffee. This time I opted for a White Mocha blended drink. This time, it had flavor but, sadly, not the kind you'd want. It tasted fruity. Like strawberry maybe. But definitely not like either white chocolate or coffee. 
My star is for the decor.  Lots of fun HP stuff that would make me spend hours there if I had a good cup of something to go with it. Obviously, there are yelpers who love the coffee so if you are a die hard coffee person, maybe you will enjoy it.If you love HP, you should definitely go and check out the decor!"}
{"text":"Way overpriced and even after tipping (total cost for 2 was $40), they never even took the time to come over and check on us while there for a business meeting (And Nooooo....... they weren't that busy).
BTW....... was there even any Lavendar in the Lavendar Latte?"}
{"text":"I just came here the other day and this little coffee shop is so cute! I'm not a big Harry Potter fan, but I just love how it's designed inside. So much detail!! Their staff is so friendly :)"}
{"text":"I solemnly swear that I am up to no good. 

If I wasn't visiting Las Vegas anyway, I might have traveled there just to visit Bad Owl Coffee, a Harry Potter themed cafe (with a TARDIS!!!). If you are hoping to enjoy a cup of coffee -- or butterbeer latte -- in the surroundings of Harry Potter lore, look no further!

At a quick glance it looks like a normal cafe, but on closer inspection you see all the small touches. The tables with quotes and spells from the books... the sign post with all the locations from the HP world... a brick wall with a Platform 9 3/4 sign hanging down, Headwig about to go through with the luggage... a reading nook with all seven books stacked neatly, waiting to be read... the menu loaded with HP references. This place is a dream.

I am happy to report that years after the last book and movie have been released, the cafe was packed with people in the middle of a weekday. Some were even dressed in Cosplay. :) But beware, it was packed with people. We waited in line for about 20 to order. The staff were very friendly and the coffee was great as well. I got a Butterbeer Latte with a shot of espresso (it is coffee free despite its name). Yum!

Mischief managed."}
{"text":"I stumble upon this local coffee shop while waiting for my dogs groomer to call me for pick up. To kill some time, I Yelped for a local coffee shop within the vicinity where I can try new coffee and have breakfast as well---and I found this coffee gem. 
I ordered their light roast Brazilian French Press  Coffee and paired it with their Bacon Croissant Breakfast Sandwich which comes with a side of yogurt which is really cool because I do love yogurt. I was not disappointed with my coffee, it was mild and full of flavor and my breakfast sandwich filled me up for the whole day literally!
I'm not a Harry Potter fan but I really like the vibe of the place---I like the atmosphere and also the friendly baristas!"}
{"text":"Apparently Bad Owl just opened and it has a Harry Potter theme. I couldn't care less about the Harry Potter thing, but I can catch the most obvious references. Anyway, the wife and I came here for coffee so let's talk about that. First of all great customer service with a hello and how do you do. Also genuine conversation in this day and age is a dying art. Questions about the menu were answered pleasantly and with knowledge. When I saw their menu, I knew that the wife was getting one of their signature flavored lattes. And she did just that with the coconut latte while I went with the Kyoto cold brew which they make with a special contraption that work with gravity to slowly drip one drop at a time slowly making for a highly concentrated brew. My coffee was certainly high on flavor and caffeine and I should be good for a while before needing another caffeine pick me up. Again the atmosphere was nice and clearly has a lot of Harry Potter things going on, but also some good tunes blaring. The wife and I have already planned future visits on this trip alone. I even enjoyed her coconut latte which means a lot coming from me."}
{"text":"Went here last weekend and the line was out the door but not too bad. Gave me and my date time to talk about the decor and how it was tasteful yet not overdone. Ordered the Butter Brew Latte and it was very tasty! Also had the Almond croissant which was good as well. Prices were not bad at all, typical coffee house prices. The pastries were a little higher than normal but when you combine a great atmosphere with great drinks, you really don't care about the price of the pastries. I would definitely come here again!"}
{"text":"Spanish Latte is my favorite made with sweet cream, tried some of the others which were good but little to sweet."}
{"text":"We originally made the trek out because of the Harry Potter theme.  We didn't have great expectations for the actual coffee.  BUT the coffee was wonderful!  Our go-to place each time we visit Las Vegas.  :)"}
{"text":"My 1st time there was a joy! Loved the \"harry potter\" feel to the place and ambiance. Drinks are affordable, tasty and worth a trip back!"}
{"text":"Harry Potter themed coffee house is so cute! There are a lot of different twists on your favorite coffee drinks. And the décor is very cute. (There is a Nutella flavored coffee there that you can't miss out on!)"}
{"text":"Great Food lots of variety!
Some of the portions are small. But everything is really good and presented nicely. Lots of variety of coffee drinks as well it's hard to choose from! Everything was really good! My new favorite place :)"}
{"text":"My friend told me about this place and said that I had to check it out because it was Harry Potter themed. I'm not a huge coffee fan, but she had me when she said Harry Potter. I'm a huge Harry Potter fan. The decor was just okay. I was expecting a little bit more. It would've been awesome if they made it more like a coffee shop that would have been in the world of Harry Potter rather than just the famous symbols painted on the tables and walls. The staff was very friendly though. They had a good variety of drinks, but they only have desserts and pastries as far as food. I got the lavender latte, which was okay, not to strong and not too sweet. My boyfriend got the butter beer latte with a shot of expresso, now his drink was way to sweet for me, but he said he liked it. I would try this place out again only to try their assorted cold brew coffees since I didn't get one on this visit."}
{"text":"Overrated.
I have tried this place serveral times since my initial review and I am continually disappointed. The drinks are over priced and over watered. No one should have to pay over $4 for a 12 oz lattee with no espresso. The waffles are just as, if not more ridiculous. A price for a waffle is $9.50. Even Tiabi isnt priced that high and they are famous for their waffles. For a little less than $10, we received a single belgium waffle.  It was far from special. The butter cream itself wasnt bad, but couldn't save them from their dense,  dry waffle and steep prices. 

I try to support local coffee shops but Bad Owl needs to change their recipes to match their price point. There is no distinguishable taste between their biscoff ice latte, sea salt cream iced coffee, and regular latte other than watery and somewhat bitter and watey and bitter. 

Luckily for them, I doubt they will lose business any time soon. People will come for the ambiance and minimal Harry Potter decor.

The establishment is clean. That is the only positive I can think of."}
{"text":"Such a good find in Henderson! The Nutella Latte is to-die-for, as is the avocado toast (looove the balsamic drizzle!!!). My husband ordered the nitro ice cream float which turned out perfectly creamy. I'm not a huge Harry Potter fan so most of the decor & menu references probably fall on deaf ears, but the atmosphere is great. Highly recommend for coffee or a quick bite!"}
{"text":"I do have to say they have a cute theme going for them, Harry Potter. I decided to get the Nutella blend and a muffin. The staff is friendly and it's a cute lil shop. Pros and cons are equally the same. 

Pros; Cute theme all around from tables and chairs to the decor. 

Negatives: limited parking and the pastries were minimal at best (because I went there at a busy time?).

Will I be back? Only if I'm on that side of town."}
{"text":"This place is outstanding! I'm a huge Harry Potter fan, and it's exciting to see references to Harry Potter here. Not as much as I expected, but still great. Our table said espresso patronum...lol :) 

The wait was a bit long, about 25 minutes, but we have to be realistic and understanding. The place recently opened, and a lot of the employees aren't very experienced with making beverages. As a Starbucks partner, I understand first and foremost what it's like to be a brand new barista. There's A LOT of pressure, and it's extremely fast-paced. Because this is a newer coffee shop with, I imagine, employees with little to no coffee experience, there WILL be a wait and some confusion. To everyone complaining about the wait, we were ALL new somewhere at some point. Cut them some slack.

As for the quality of the beverages, absolutely outstanding. I got a blended Nutella with no espresso, and it was great. I got a chocolate-covered macaron, too, and I would like to try the other flavors sometime.

Overall, the cleanliness, customer service, and quality of food/beverage were great. Speed will come!"}
{"text":"This place is so cute and since I'm a Harry Potter spaz I had to check it out. I got the butter brew latte with espresso and boy was it yummy!  I also go macaroons which were mediocre but the ambience is cute and the butter brew was worth it."}
{"text":"This place is very cute. I love the decor and the service was fast and the cashier girl was patient and helpful when I didn't know how to 'check in' to yelp lol. The discount was a nice incentive especially being my first time in there. As for the drink.. I ordered a butter brew late iced with no espresso and like a previous yelper described,  it tasted like milk and butterscotch syrup. It didn't taste terrible, but for the price I think they could do a little bit better."}
{"text":"I really think no matter what you order here it's all good! I can't get past the coconut latte for now so delish. I went by to read today and it was peaceful. The cashier also remembered my name, it's the little things! And duh it's Harry Potter to top it all off"}
{"text":"My Barista was named Shane. Best Latte in Las Vegas, NV so far! Tons of Latte flavors to choose from. I also order the ceasers chicken wrap. Now this wrap came out a little longer than I preferred, BUT the flavor and professional displayed of my chicken wrap made up for the time it took for it to come out. Would I come back for sure. Where iive it takes a good 25 minutes to drive to, BUT oh so worth it. And come on Everywhere in Vegas takes 30 minutes to get to hahahaaaa!"}
{"text":"How did I not come here sooner?!? As a Harry Potter lover, I loved the little HP touches found throughout this coffee shop. Bonus: They also serve beer! And, of course, there's wifi. They have a great selection of coffee and other drinks, as well as various food items. The staff are pleasant and efficient. It's a cute place to hangout with a couple of friends or go solo and get some work done. And be sure to look around and take in all of the HP details."}
{"text":"Went on a weekend afternoon. It wasn't overly busy. The coffee was good but small and spendy. Two of their largest coffees came to $14ish. The decor was cute but as a huge Harry Potter fan a bit of a let down. I thought there would be more. With the prices so high I don't see a return visit in my future..."}
{"text":"I had to check out the themed coffee shop! Had the butter brew hot, which seemed like a standard latte with butterscotch, but still tasty. My wife had a Nutella blended drink and we had some pastries. 

The Good - service was super friendly! They had some issues with the POS, but nothing crazy. The themes items were also nice. Not over the top, but enough to grow a fan base. Coffee program was nice, nothing too complicated. 

The Bad - the pastries I felt were only okay. Croissants are my favorite, but these could have used warming up as an extra service as they were a bit dried. This is a popular spot, so expect a wait to get your caffeine fix. 

The Verdict - definitely a fun stop if you are looking for something to do for a pick me up. Take photos, hang out with friends and support a nerd community."}
{"text":"The coffee here is very good! I wish they offered larger cup sizes, but I am a coffee addict and honestly could probably never get enough. The design of the coffee shop is very unique, I definitely recommend checking it out!"}
{"text":"My initial visit I ordered the Lavender White Mocha off of their signature latte menu. The baristas were all super friendly and happy...and how couldn't they be working in a Harry Potter themed coffee shop?! I've been coming in regularly for the past year and have explored a variety of menu items including their food. There is nothing I have come to dislike yet, great spot!"}
{"text":"Love this place! I usually go in the afternoons when I just want to relax and read a book with a cup of coffee and a warmed up butter croissant or almond croissant. They are a bit pricey just like what is expected with any good coffee shop, but even pricier than Starbucks. A medium flavored regular menu item latte with soy and croissant is like $8 and some change and Starbucks and $10 and some change at bad owl. But on the bright side they have better almond croissants and the latte's are delicious never overly sweet like some places, but I'm sure if you would like it sweeter they would make it for you. So it's worth the price but I can't go here on a regular basis. So far for me they have never taken too long with the drinks or croissant. They do take a long time with food since I believe they make it fresh, or at least it tastes like it, so if you are in a hurry stick with a drink. I really love the Harry Potter atmosphere as well it's so unique. The employee's are awesome too!"}
{"text":"This place has a cool mysterious vibe. Definitely a hipster kinda coffee shop. Teas and coffees ive tried so far are good but they dont have ICED TEAS only hot & with how hot it is in Vegas i feel like that makes no sense. Probably wont be back till fall"}
{"text":"I was obsessed with Harry Potter when I was a kid and still am. Going to this little coffee shop was worth the drive from Summerlin to Henderson. It's definitely busier in the morning and it starts to die down around 11. OI recommend the Nutella Latte Iced, or the Butter Beer Iced. Those two are my top faves."}
{"text":"Friendly staff. Drinks are awesome. I always get an iced toffee latte with extra sea salt cream. So yummy! And they have stamp cards. Would give it a 5, but sometimes the wait time is too long. Nonetheless, still a great place to try and check out for all the Harry Potter lovers out there!"}
{"text":"The environment, and feel of the place is very cool and I enjoy going here, the sandwiches are AWESOME and the menu is full. But the coffee just didn't taste right. No other way to put it than it just wasn't very good tasting. But the staff was very helpful and very kind to me and my friends."}
{"text":"AMAZING COFFEE!! Between the hand made syrups and the friendly owners, this place earned 5 stars from me. Wonderfully themed and a great experience for Harry Potter fans or just coffee snobs like myself!"}
{"text":"Great waffles n' coffee - great place to stop for a bite.  And slightly Harry Potter themed too for those who enjoy that sorta thing.  Very comfy neighborhood coffee shop - totally recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"I love coffee and Harry Potter so when I first heard of this coffee shop I knew I had to try it the next time I was in Vegas. It's in Henderson, close to my mother's house, but definitely not close to the Strip for most visitors coming to Vegas. The Harry Potter theme is not over the top. Going inside you'll see to the left, over a large high top
Counter table, a string of letters just like the ones sent to the Dursley's house. Right across from it is a brick wall and that says platform 9 3/4. From past pictures on Yelp I saw there used to be a luggage with an owl on top that resembles Harry's luggage, but the time i visited over the weekend it was gone. Also, different cute sayings are written over the top of the tables when you sit down. 

As for the coffee, I ordered an iced butter brew latte with chocolate croissant and my brother got the coconut mocha latte iced. I'm not too picky and a big fan of frappes and different flavored coffees so I was happy with my choice. It tasted just like the butter beer from universals studios. There were only a few other Harry Potter themed drinks/food but most were items you'd see at any other cafe/coffee shop. 

This place is a cute cafe with a subtle Harry Potter theme, close to where I usually stay in Vegas, so I would definitely come back and like to try their other offerings, such as their butter beer waffle. But for most who stay at the strip I wouldn't necessarily recommend making your way out to see it. Also, one star off for the price. Total for 2 small iced lattes and one chocolate croissant turned out to be $14 which is a little much for me"}
{"text":"Adorable coffee joint. Love the Harry Potter theme. The prosciutto sandwich is delightful when it doesn't have too much fig jam on it. I love the pistachio latte. The lychee soda is great as well."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge Harry Potter fan but I don't dislike HP either.. I'm just not a super fan who was drawn here because it was Harry Potter. But a coworker of mine asked me if I had been there yet. A themed coffee shop sounded fun and I had the extra time in my day to drive over to check it out so off we went (I dragged my boyfriend along). The shop is clean, and cute and has themed tables, some HP references on the walls, and the books stacked in the back corner. Its cute. The staff and owners were friendly and helpful with questions. We first ordered hot coffees and they were average. Don't get me wrong.. they were good, but I personally didn't need to drive across town to get them. The pastries were very good though. We got a coconut muffin and a chocolate twist (the chocolate twist is my recommendation if you don't know what to choose). Before leaving, we wanted a clod drink to go. I was told they couldn't make their teas cold (other than the house iced tea) because they use loose leaf. I have had loose leaf cold before many many many times so I am unsure if it's just their brewing equipment but I didn't argue. I then decided I would take the Apple tea hot BUT they were out. Sadness. We settled on their cold house brew iced tea. I personally need a sweeter tea and they added some syrup to help and it did. The iced tea was very good. We took those to go. I'll be back, but being across town for me, I wouldn't say this is my go to.. but if I am in the area then why not?"}
{"text":"Not a fan of Harry Potter, but definitely a fan of this coffee shop. The Butter Brew Latte with espresso was made to perfection. The chocolate croissant was huge and delicious. This is probably my new favorite coffee shop and I look forward to trying out their teas. AND they have Wifi!"}
{"text":"Butter brew latte was delicious! The beignets were super soft. . Little bit of a wait for my breakfast sandwich, everything else came right away."}
{"text":"Butterbeer and iced teas are delicious. The   service is exceptional  we will definately be back to try the food."}
{"text":"I had to try this place!!! Why? Because I am a coffee loving mama and I'm obsessed with Harry Potter. My two great loves in life, at one place! Inside, the interior was dim, with Harry Potter themed tables, and decor on the wall. Upon arrival everyone was friendly, and I already knew what I wanted ( Obviously the butter beer latte). They write your name on your cup like Starbucks, there was two sizes 12 or - 16 oz hot. I opted for the 16 oz, flavor wise - the butter beer latte is like a melted butterscotch flavor mixed in with espresso. I was happy with my choice, came in around early afternoon wasn't so busy, and got my latte fairly quick. Happy with the service, they didn't make fun of me for being a dork, taking photos of the place. Haha I will definitely be back if I'm on that side of town or if I have an itching for butter beer. ;) They also have a stamp card, so even better for a coffee mama."}
{"text":"Avocado toast was the BEST live ever had & Lavender Latte with Almond milk was Very good too! I prefer my ice coffee super cold so after 1/2 was gone I asked for a top off of ice and it was perfect for our drive to the LV strip."}
{"text":"I love bad owl, it does take a minute to get your coffee though and it's always packed. But that means it's worth it!"}
{"text":"Really cool little cafe/bar. I love their Harry Potter concept. I had the iced lavender white mocha which was very tasty. If you are more into beer and wine they have very unique offerings too. I like that it isn't loud like some other coffee places. I love supporting local places like this and you should too!"}
{"text":"This place is so cute and only a few minutes from Vegas area. I got a butter brew latte with soy and it was delicious! I also had the seasonal pumpkin waffles with butter whipped cream, and they were magical. Loved all the decor and the staff was very friendly too!"}
{"text":"Drove across town to check out this place. It's pretty cool looking inside. There's a bunch of good choices on the menu as well. I ordered a sea salt nitro brew and egg croissant  & my gf got a coconut white mocha and the Munster cheese vegetarian wrap. The total after tax&tip was around $40 which is kinda expensive to be honest but that's not so much of an issue. The annoying part was the girl making the coffee. She yelled out in the Resturant \"who ordered the nitro brew?\" \"Who is Kevin, it's going to take a long time\". I got up went to the register and asked what the problem was and the cashier was kinda apologizing for her coworker acting unprofessional. So I offered to just take a normal coffee instead but the coffee girl just kept huffing and puffing like she was so burdened by the situation. I think regardless of the reason why she was annoyed she shouldn't act like a kid. It could have been a machine malfunction, the fact that it was actually busy, or just the fact she hates making that particular drink. The point is it doesn't matter why she was acting immature. She is at work and yelling and making the customers feel uncomfortable. Ruined the visit. And the nitro brew wasn't good at all if that matters. I won't mention her name because I think it's lame to throw someone under the buss like that but I hope she isn't there next time I go in."}
{"text":"Had a latte and chicken pesto sandwiches for breakfast! Both items were delicious! Nice and helpful staff!"}
{"text":"I'm always skeptical with theme coffee shops because they emphasize more on the decor rather than the quality of their espresso.  We ordered a lavender latte and a Nutella blended frappe. The lavender latte had a very nice smell but the espresso was relatively weak.  The Nutella frappe was just bad.  Tasted like they blend some type of powder mocha with ice.  Couldn't taste the espresso at all.  Overall a trendy place but coffee was just disappointing"}
{"text":"The place is lovely but nothing out of the ordinary caught my eye. Service was a bit slow due to technical difficulties with automatic card machine. There was a lack of places to sit outside and was too crowded."}
{"text":"I came and had a hot Black Forest. Not as sweet as I would like, but the quality of the coffee and the syrup was EXCELLENT. No artificial taste to the cherry, which went down very smooth with the coffee. Great blend that had no bitterness, the way that you'll typically find with Starbucks. Absolutely coming back :)"}
{"text":"I thought this was a lovely little coffee shop! I haven't had the pleasure of trying their food yet but it looked delicious. The latte I had was very good and I will definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"Found the perfect opportunity to stop in on the way to the Hoover Dam with visitors.  We ordered the Breakfast Croissant, Wizard Meltdown, Chicken Caesar Wrap, the B.O.C, Butterbrew with added espresso shot (iced), House Ice Tea, and an iced coffee.  

The sandwiches were pretty good with a good ratio of meat, cheese, etc. The exception was the Caesar wrap which didn't have much chicken and wasn't especially impressive.  The Butterbrew wasn't overly sweet (in my opinion) despite what I had read here on Yelp!, but was pretty good.  I forgot to ask if they have lactose-intolerant options :(   Next time I'd like to try the other specialty drinks because my friends didn't order anything too crazy... Anyone could suck down a mediocre tea or iced coffee.

The theme (Harry Potter with a random Dr. Who item in the front corner) is pretty cool with some hilarious deviations (Platform 9 6/8) to avoid copyright issues (probably).  Overall nice atmosphere and they have a neat bench area for people using laptops/ hanging out to work.

We received a discount on our iced drinks for checking in on Yelp! but our food/drinks totaled $57.82.  A little pricey if you ask me!"}
{"text":"Roasted almond latte with almond milk. Found bits of real almonds in my drink. It was fabulous, creamy, and the almond taste was strong and pure. I would love to try other drinks although this almond latte will be hard to move on from.

Cute decor. You don't have to be a Harry Potter fan to enjoy the atmosphere. No one came in with a cape."}
{"text":"Love the ambiance of this place. Prices are okay and tried the coconut mocha latte which is pretty strong but alright for a coffee drinker like me. The staff who helped me does not look like he's having a good day though."}
{"text":"If your a Harry Potter fan and love coffee this place is definitely the place you need to check out. The staff are very friendly and will let you know what they recommend if you have a hard time figuring out what to order, of course my boyfriend and I had yelped prior to getting there so we knew what we wanted to try out. It was actually both our first time there so he decided to get the butter brew latte w/espresso since its been a hype and I got the biscoff latte. I was impressed with the biscoff latte, it was really lavorful that you could re taste the cookie butter which was surprisingly not too sweet at all. As for the butter brew latte the boyfriend wasn't really impressed. You couldn't really taste the flavor of the butterscotch which was disappointing but Im sure it had to do with the espresso being added to it. Hoping nxt time we will give it a try without the espresso."}
{"text":"Harry Potter + Coffee

They combined two of my favorite things in this world. 
I've been here several times trying different things each time and I have not been disappointed yet. 

Kyoto Cold Brew
Lychee Pop
Toast Almond Latte 
Flight of the Hippogryph 


-these are among a few that I've had before. 
All delicious in their own ways. 


Awesome themed coffee that is a must stop for Potterheads such as myself"}
{"text":"I stopped by bad owl coffee after hearing about their grand opening. It's located right at the corner of horizon ridge and eastern parkway in the k mart shopping plaza, and features a very modern and sleek interior inspired by Harry Potter.

The walk in entry is comfortable and spacious providing a clean place to savor the aroma and seating is plentiful. It felt very welcoming, both to muggles and death eaters alike. One of the first things I noticed was the Japanese Kyoto style coffee drip tower, which allows ice to slowly melt and filter through the ground coffee beans into a coil and collected, relying on a slow drip rather than heat to brew providing a lighter body and more delicate taste, yum!

Service is excellent and the owners were more than warm and welcoming first thing upon entering. The back wall of the shop also has a couple leather chairs for sexy slitherins like myself.

I got the lavender latte which was nice and smooth with a good sense of a floral taste that wasn't distracting to the bean flavor at all but rather, complimented it. Even Hermione's Obliviate spell wouldn't be able to erase that flavor from my mind.

If you need a clean and good spot to relax a bit, get away from that \"he who shall not be named,\" and grab a fresh cup, bad owl is best spot to do so!"}
{"text":"My family all managed to meet up here during our lunch breaks for maybe 4 weeks in a row. Great coffee, decent food selection. Of course, nothing is better than sitting in a Harry Potter themed coffee shop. Try the pistachio flavor...I can't get enough!! I only wish they had more seating. It's always busy and its often hard to find a place to camp out."}
{"text":"I love trying new places especially coffee shops being the addict that I am, but this place didn't really live up to all the hype.  Coffee was good, nothing mouth watering though. It was also very crowded, they need more seating and for being Harry Potter themed I expected a little more. I also ordered a sandwich that in my opinion was overpriced. Overall, the place is cute and the coffee is not bad but not my favorite, maybe next time :)"}
{"text":"Great place to study or hang out! Good coffee and fun ambience. The decorations were Harry Potter themed, and the staff was very hospitable. Got a little loud during the lunch rush so I had to leave but wouldn't mind going back!"}
{"text":"I visited Bad Owl a couple days after the opening. Let me preface this by saying I have never watched a Harry Potter film.

The decor was very impressive. Everything is tasteful, the flow is perfect and there is adequate seating (assuming the buzz isn't always this high). I enjoyed that they were able to incorporate the Potter theme, without alienating outsiders who have never watched the films.

The coffee was well balanced. I ordered an Americano and it was a perfect blend of acidity and smoothness. A little cream really brought out the rich flavor. I'd put the quality on par with Mothership, but the espresso is a bit less acidic if that is your thing.

The negative: The line was insanely long. I knew what I was getting into when I pulled up and the line was out the door. Being as I am an Americano drinker, specialty coffees don't jump out at me, so I can honestly say I wouldn't wait in a line this long again for another cup. However, Henderson isn't exactly filled with high end coffee bars, so I wouldn't mind waiting 10-15 mins on a leisurely day. The only knock I have, is that the staff isn't adequate at the moment for the traffic it's generating. A single cashier and 2 baristas isn't the most efficient setup.

While the line was an inconvenience, I can't deduct any stars. I wish a business nothing but success, and hope that the lines always remain. For my selfish reasons however, I'd consider this a regular haunt if the buzz ever dies down."}
{"text":"I LOVE Harry Potter, especially the wizarding world that JK Rowling created. So when my friend told me about this coffee shop, it immediately became a must-do on my next Vegas trip.

But the experience was somewhat disappointing. It felt like the coffee shop was kinda just bandwagoning on the HP hype. They do have some cute HP-related decor, but I expected it to be more Harry-Potter like, but I guess they would probably run into some copyright issues. But it's also kinda confusing how they have the door to the TARDIS at the front of the store on the right...

There were a minimal selection of Harry Potter-inspired drinks, maybe more Sandwiches with Harry Potter-themed names which I didn't get to try.

I ordered the Butter Brew Latte with soy milk (damn my lactose-intolerance), which I hastily expected to be like Butterbeer, but it's not. I also ordered the Matcha Affogato, which comes with a lot of vanilla ice cream and some thick matcha. But I think I would've enjoyed pouring the matcha myself, which I always thought was half the fun of an affogato.

I think my favorite menu item would actually be the Flight of the Hippogriff under their Signatures section. It's 4 different espresso shooters, inspired by the four Houses at Hogwarts and each shooter has a different color and flavor. It may be a new item because I couldn't find it on their online menu or any of the pictures on Yelp. I was only able to try the coconut-flavored Slytherin shooter though (SLYTHERIN FOREVER!). It didn't taste super coconut-y but it was still good, and sweet.

Basically, this Harry Potter-inspired coffee shop is a little far off the Strip (which is where most tourists stay) for what it is to become a regular Vegas stop."}
{"text":"Such a cute cafe. Love the Harry Potter theme. My daughter had avocado toast and I had a prosciutto sandwich on ciabata and an Americano coffee. The food and drink  did not disappoint. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the vibe of this place.  I'm a big Harry Potter fan so this was fun.  I had the iced butter beer drink delicious and the ham and egg croissant.  We had a really good time here."}
{"text":"The coffee at Bad Owl is incredible!!! No bitter taste like many other coffee companies. Be prepared for a long line but I promise it's worth it! My favorite is the white forest latte. My son & I love the Harry Potter decor. What a great idea! This is our new go-to coffee spot!"}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place, but unfortunately it was a disappointment. While the decor is nice, the coffee not so much. I was surprised to find out their lattes don't actually contain expresso. That's an extra cost and the last time I checked a latte has expresso in it. So I was put off by this because you can't call a latte a latte without expresso. It's called a steamer if it has no expresso in it. Just saying. This seems like false advertisement or the owners don't know anything about lattes/coffee. I don't know that I will return. I can get better coffee else where and actually get a latte that actually has expresso it in without paying extra."}
{"text":"Very cute place. Packed! We are here on a Sunday morning. I would think it's less busy during the week. Prices are higher than the average Starbucks but it tastes better and a very cool ambiance. We got a Nutella blended coffee and a mocha blended coffee. They are delicious. I think that if they ever open another shop, they'll want a larger place. It's too small here, but still an awesome shop."}
{"text":"Yeahhh! Great nitro cold brew and local pastries. We stopped by on vacation and were pleasantly surprised by the quality. Plus, I am a big HP geek and already had this place on my list to stop while in Vegas. The decor isn't cheesy, is perfectly HP, and the service is so friendly. 

I hope to be back soon. (P.S. They have a TARDIS)"}
{"text":"We had the Nitrobrew and the Butter Beer. Both were amazing! Super chill place to sit, drink and talk. The staff was super nice and friendly."}
{"text":"Wow. I'm a Harry Potter fan so that's definitely part of the allure. But I'm also a coffeephile and the coffee is just bomb. They make their own butterscotch flavoring. What?!  I want this place to be down the street from my house so I guess I'll have to work on my apparating skills. Or at least get my hands on some floo powder."}
{"text":"So I've been there a few times already and it's just ok. Some of the staffing there is not too familiar with Harry Potter. The drinks are pretty good, but are always running out of butterbrew and I don't think it's worth the 30+ minute wait. If you want to go there for the pastries, don't go there when it opens. The company they go through for their pastries is not opened at that time and they won't be there to make their delivery until after 7:30am. I have also noticed that when you walk in when it opens, they're not really prepared. They're still setting up the menus, register, equipment and their nitrogen coffee was not even setup yet. I think they may have opened a little too early and it looks like they didn't learn too much from the soft opening. 

I love to support local businesses, but it looks like they need to clean it up a bit. I will try again in about a month and see if there has been any changes. It's interesting to see how they will do once Starbucks opens up in the same shopping center."}
{"text":"It's pouring rain and 6 minutes until 8AM. I can see 3 people inside. One looked up and saw me asking if they opened at 8 and they ignored me. For a few minutes, totally ignored my knocking, my questioning looks. Didnt even acknowledge me to tell me that they will be open in a couple minutes or to hold on... nothing... pretended like I didn't exist and I've been wanting to go to Bad Owl for months. Sad that their staff ruined it for me."}
{"text":"Writing this as I dine . He acknowledged that I was first time customer with Groupon. Ordered 16oz lavender white mocha skinny with half the syrup, no problem there. He didn't ask if I wanted anything else so I said I will also get a breakfast sandwich . He said ok pick up coffee here and will bring sandwich out to me. Some of the details noted : Coffee is ok , Luke warm, the foam is thick and half sweet was plenty , I can't imagine full sugary syrup. Breakfast sandwich ready , called my name instead to have me get up from my table. Not impressed with the portion size for the price I paid, I will be positive of the fact that I am on mini cut so this would prevent me from consuming more calories . He gave me a fork and a spoon instead of a knife for the sandwich , not to mention the menu included fruit or yogurt with my sandwich which I didn't receieve.  Sandwich is ok little salty for me, if your salt sensitive, ask for no salt on the eggs since ham and cheddar cheese is already salty enough.  I didn't even bother asking for my missing fruit,  at this point the place just rubbed me the wrong way. (I was in good mood prior to coming here) What's with the Harry Potter theme? Didnt strike me as appealing to all customer base. If you like to study at coffee shops, I don't think the layout is the best for studying for few hours here. Overall if it wasn't for Groupon I would not come back again."}
{"text":"The cafe was really nice and cute, but I feel like this place was overhyped. The butter brew coffee was good but I've had better drinks at other places. However, if you love Harry Potter, I think this place would be worth the visit."}
{"text":"Cool Harry Potter themed coffee shop that my cousin told me about in Henderson!  My son loves Harry Potter so this was a neat road trip stop for him.  They have all kinds of concoctions including Butter Beer!!"}
{"text":"Hmnnn. It's a cute place for a potterhead like me but if you're looking for a good coffee, this is not the place. The butterbeer latte which is their beatseller taste like caramel water. The pastries here aren't that good too. Walmart pastries are even better. It's a good place to go once just to try but I won't be back."}
{"text":"Butterbrew latte! That alone was worth the trip from LV. As for the butterbrew cream they serve with waffles I had childlike fantasies about devouring it straight from the dispenser :)
The harry potter them is so cool. If you're a fan you'll want to check this place out. Even if you aren't a fan, you'll enjoy the food and beverages and industrial chic vibe here. 
The Siriusly Prosciutto was the best food item we tried. The waffles and veggie quiche were both very good as well. My only issue is that when cutting the quiche or waffles the paper liner tore exposing my food to the plastic basket/metal tray below. I'm a little more conscious of germs than most people though so. ..
All in all a DEFINITE 5 stars! Must visit!"}
{"text":"Cute little place, very small small but the decor was priceless. Loved the Harry Potter theme. Gotta saw my coconut milk Latte was quite expensive for such a small thing but , hey, I guess you're paying for the ambiance? Idk"}
{"text":"I will definitely update this review after my next visit. Hey, at least I plan to revisit right?! My first impression of the place was pretty disappointing. Maybe because I've overhyped myself too much. Brought my fellow Harry Potter-loving 7 year old son with me, and he was not convinced at all that this store was inspired by the movie lol. He said, \"maybe a little.\"

I ordered a small iced lavender white mocha. The flavor was pretty good. Not sure if there was supposed to be a hint of lavender because I tried so hard to find it on my palate. I also thought it was kind of pricey for a small, but I get it's a boutique coffee shop. 

I definitely want to come back to try some of their food and other drinks. Maybe when it's less busy. They're doing something right because it was a full house on a Monday afternoon. Couldn't really take many pictures as I wanted, because all the spots were taken. Also, I didn't see the Harry Potter-inspired luggage cart today as I've seen them in many pictures."}
{"text":"Finally got the opportunity to check this place out!! As a Harry Potter fan, I love the notes of Harry Potter influence! There are many places to sit, with cute quotes from the books on tables. I got the apple malt tea and it came in a teapot and was the perfect sweet treat. My boyfriend, who isn't a Harry Potter fan, also enjoyed the atmosphere and his Kyoto iced coffee. Thank you for such a great experience!!"}
{"text":"Homework heaven! There are butter beer lattes for the girls, half-priced Prosecco for mom and divine macarons in a dozen flavors! It's all packaged up in a comfy place with plenty of room to get homework done away from home!"}
{"text":"I highly recommend trying their Lavender latte its such a smooth tasting drink. That's typically what I get here. I also enjoy the environment because its real cozy. They do have a reward program where they send you texts with coupons which comes in handy, and they do have a Birthday treat just likes Starbucks does which is nice."}
{"text":"So this place has a few kinks. Of course, this place opened not even 2 weeks ago. We went on a Saturday, so I anticipated a long wait but I was so excited, I stalked Yelp, their Facebook and Instagram to be informed of any changes in their business hours, etc.

We arrived at 8:06am, approximately 6 minutes after they opened. On our drive there, I discovered from their Instagram that they were out of the supplies to be able to make their Butter Brew specialty. Que disappointment, but was still eager to try other things on the menu anyway. Previously had their Biscoff (cookie butter) latte, and it was AMAZING. 

There was a sign on the door that read 'Out of Butter Brew', so they do a good job at communicating. We walked in and the line was so long, it took us a few minutes to figure out where the line ended so that we could stand there without being in the way of the patrons at the tables. I asked a group of beauty school looking peeps if they were the end of the line and they kinda shrug-answered me. Guess they REALLLY needed their coffee to activate their personalities. Anyway, discovered that they were at the back of the line so we took our place in the back. 

There is a clip board that the menu is attached to. Pretty cool for those at the end of the line who would otherwise not be able to see an actual menu. 

The Harry Potter theme is strong. While waited in line, we saw person after person pose with the white owl perched in its cage at Platform 9 3/4. Some were even sporting their mustard and maroon Harry scarves. 

The wait turned out to be pretty long. Like, 40 minutes long. We chose a huge butter croissant, a chocolate chip muffin, a blended Macha and two white chocolate mochas, blended. They were pretty tasty. I gobbled up my croissant while waiting for my drink. Sorry 'bout the crumbs. For 2 pastries and 3 blended drinks (and with a nice tip), our bill was $26. Pretty on par with 'specialty' coffee places. 

The two identical white chocolate mochas were different in color (one was almost pure white like vanilla bean, the other had the coffee color and taste). Of course, the line was too scary to try to jump back in, and the workers were so frazzled because they were so busy, we decided it wasn't that big of an issue. 

Cool atmosphere, customer service was just 'OK'. The cashier was probably too stressed to crack a smile. The concept, theme and the product is brilliant, though. Side note: Umpqua oats oatmeal is sold here, and it looks like they are a local company- I'm all about supporting local business. 

Tip: If waiting in a massive line here, get the 'MSQRD' app and take a selfie using the Harry Potter filter. Align it with Platform 9 3/4 and white owl. *mind blown*"}
{"text":"Their Iced Mint Mojito Latte was good. 
The butter beer waffle was insanely good. 
The fact that everything is Harry Potter themed just makes it even better. 

The only thing I don't like is that they're way down in Anthem and I live a few miles north so it is out of my way to go there.... but it makes the treat all the sweeter when I do. 

I'd love to go there for coffee and not have a waffle, but I don't think that's really possible. Warning: the waffles are wonderfully addictive."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place of all time. I absolutely love the staff and everything on their menu. Their food is absolutely amazing, their coffee is the best I've ever had, and their craft beer selection is fantastic. I try to go after work and catch their happy hour because it's half off on drinks. Half off! I think I've filled their punch cards 3 times now. An absolute must go to place if you're visiting or just want to find a great place to sit and relax and have great food. Awesome vegetarian options as well. Thank you Bad Owl for being amazing."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place. I really did. I doubt I will be coming back however. I ordered the roasted almost latte. When it first came out, I immediately sent it back because the temperature was barely warm. The next one that came out was the same temp. Not wanting to complain, again, I just decided to leave and drink it. I was told that the roasted almond was one of their \"not so sweet option\". Well I'd hate to taste their sweet options because my taste buds were just over run with sugary sweetness. Also the music was way to upbeat for the Harry Potter theme the shop has going on. I might give it another chance if I am in the area, but I most definitely will not be making a special trip."}
{"text":"This place has an amazing staff and atmosphere (duh, it's Harry Potter!) but their coffee is pretty average and their butterbeer latte tastes like liquid popcorn. If I was to return it would be for the ambiance and maybe try some tea."}
{"text":"HAD TO GO HERE FOR HARRY POTTER THEME. ABSOLUTELY OBSESSED. That's the only reason I even went here. I don't even drink coffee.
Kinda far drive if you don't live in Henderson. I live in the south side in Spring Valley and it still took me 20min to get there. Its DEEEP in Henderson 
The décor is super cute and I can only imagine how it looks when it is Halloween. 
When you walk in, there is about 20-30 seats starting from group tables, to individual tables that seat 2 people. Décor is cute and not as Harry Potter themed as I would like but Im guessing due to copyright infringement.  There is the sign from the Plaform 9 5/8 ( 9 and 3/4 from the movie), a white owl (Hedwig), dementor hanging from the ceiling, and cute little writings on the table like \"everyday im muggling\" and \"Keep calm and use black magic\"- see pics
We had ordered 2 drinks
1) Sea Salt caramel Nitro Cold: Almost like Nitro Stout- Super chocolately and def wanna get the sea salt caramel (because Chocolate and sea salt combo is a def must do)
-Coffee infused with nitrogen, giving the coffee a sweet malty taste without any added sugar and served from the tap
2)Spanish Latte- Sweet cream and expresso- not super sweet- if you like super sweet drinks, this is not the drink for you. Doesn't come with ICE. Very creamy and again not super sweet cause I don't like sweet drinks. 

NEED TO COME HERE FOR HALOWEEN for the Haloween-esque and Harry potter-ish theme. Also the alchemy inspire coffee contraptions are my favorite!!"}
{"text":"OK so if your a Harry Potter fan this coffee shop totally caters to the soon to be cult classic. Harry Potter books, train sign, caged owl and messages on tables all reference the famous movie/book series. 

The decor has dark tones to represent the Harry Potter atmosphere. I felt it was neat and clean, would have a no problem sitting down for a few to drink my coffee. It is fairly small so come in early or you lose a spot. 

The only issue I had was there process...there was 2 people in front of me and it took almost 10 minutes just place an order, I literally saw 3 people working on the same cup of coffee. Come on guys, smarter not harder. The coffee itself was delicious, so if your willing to wait and watch the circus behind the counter it is worth it for a good cup of brew."}
{"text":"Coffee and Harry Potter? What more could a muggle like myself ask for? I've been meaning to come here for a while and finally decided to stop by for my daily caffeine fix! 

The cafe made me feel as if I was in a backlot at Universal Studios! The decorations are awesome and the place looks just like a movie scene! But with delicious coffee and pastries. The cafe is adorned in shiplap and includes memorable moments from the Harry Potter series like the Hogwarts acceptance letters, Platform 9¾, Hedwig perched in his cage atop Harry's luggae, and the hidden Dementor in the back corner. I love the theme!

I love Nutella (you're crazy if you don't), so it was only right that I order the Nutella latte and I'm glad I did. What genius thought of this? It was the perfect amount of sweetness! Also, I love the fact that Bad Owl offers more than just coffee. They also offer tea and if I'm not mistaken, I believe I saw a few craft beers and different wines. As far as eats goes, they have sandwiches, waffles, and a variety of desserts. Yum!

Can't wait to come back and try the Butter Brew Latte!"}
{"text":"Great coffee! Great service, yummy sandwiches. Lines can get long... But there coffee and staff are the best!"}
{"text":"My first time was last Tuesday and I was convinced by my best friend and one of the workers that the \"butter brew\" was the best drink. So I got that with 1 shot of expresso and I am DEFINITELY a new fan!"}
{"text":"I don't know how anyone can give less than five stars to such a well designed establishment (as well as their exquisite drinks and desserts).  Theme restaurants normally leave much to be desired however the designers of this coffee shop for us Muggles nailed it!  From the bookshelves to the floor to the walls to their menu I could see (HP fans or) customers hanging out until they close each night as the minute you walk through the doors you feel like you are on your way to Diagon Alley. Regarding their coffee beverages, you can't go wrong with the Butter Brew Latte (add a shot of espresso) or the Matcha Green tea latte and you must pair those with their hazelnut beignets. I wish they opened one of these in Summerlin....or had a portal like the one on Platform 9 3/4....just saying...."}
{"text":"Came here for the decor, and wasn't disappointed at all. The coffee and breakfast being delicious was just an added bonus. It's quite a drive from my house but it's so worth it!"}
{"text":"I feel bad to update this review (and not for the better either) but man....Bad Owl...what happened!?!? =(

Went here this past weekend. This will be my 3rd visit now. The line has significantly gone down a lot. No longer is the line going out the door. We still waited in line for about 15 minutes  but the wait was all inside the building. 

First off....they were out of the pistachio latte. It's been \"out\" for a good month now. It's not even on the menu anymore but the barista says they're out right now. I asked her is this drink permanently gone or you're just out? She said they're out. (But it's not even on the menu though.....okay......if you say so) So I ordered a small iced coconut latte and my boyfriend ordered a Spanish latte. What kind of coffee/caffeine do they use? There was absolutely no caffeine taste plus I didn't \"feel any caffeine\" in my body. Shit....even Jack in the Box coffee have more caffeine than this! Very disappointed. And I'm pretty caffeine-sensitive so it should hit my body but it never did. At almost $10 for two small sized drinks, I would expect it to be worth it. Nope, it's not. And even though it's listed as 12 oz...it's not. This cup was smaller than a Starbucks tall sized. 

They had a good thing going....key word: HAD. The drinks are disappointing now. If it wasn't a HP themed coffee shop, this update would have been a 1 star. There are plenty of other local coffee shops that makes way better drinks. (Sunrise Coffee, Madhouse Coffee and Holley's Cuppa are always my go-to local coffee shops.)"}
{"text":"Love the theme of the coffee shop!!! I love Harry Potter!!!! Decorations are adorable and coffee was good!!! I really enjoyed the desserts!!!! If you like Harry Potter and coffee it's a must to put on your list!!!!"}
{"text":"Happy Birthday to Harry Potter & J.K. Rowling!!

Was finally able to check this place out this morning and I had a great visit. The staff was friendly, and the food was yummy. 

I ordered the Lavender White Mocha and I enjoyed every sip of it. It sounds like it would be super sweet, but I was glad that it wasn't. Perfect balance of coffee and sweetness. They also have different types of milk if you're not into the regular kind. 

The boyfriend and I shared a cookie butter waffle, which comes with 4 quarters of a whole waffle, a scoop of vanilla ice cream, and cookie butter spread, maple syrup, and butter. It was really satisfying. It was sorta pricy though, $9.50. 

The table tops of all the tables here have different quotes or sayings on it. Most are very Punny! I would totally recommend this place for all Harry Potter fans!"}
{"text":"Love love love Bad Owl... the Atmosphere is rad, the customers are all in the Fandoms, and the food and beverages are phenomenal!! Cant say enough good things about the Siriusly Prosciutto Sandwich, and I cant stand most salads... but the side salad with this is Amazing!! Just tried the Butterbeer Latte tonight and I am definitely a fan!!"}
{"text":"Have been here several times, and i keep coming back! Im in between a 3.5- 4 stars as there was a little issue with my coffee (see below).  Coffee are made to perfection. If you are into Harry Potter, this is the place to be! The decor of this place is close to the movie! But other than decor the coffee and pastries are very good! They have some new items on the menu- must check out! 

this time i ordered the lavender and an almond croissant. Both were good except my lavender was not hot enough this time around. The next time ill be sure to request for extra hot! But overall its a nice place and staff are great and friendly!"}
{"text":"This place is a dream come true. I got the butter beer latte (the most popular drink) and it was sooo good. It wasn't super sweet & tasted like a normal latte, but thats what I liked about it!! I liked that it was just a normal tasting drink, nothing crazy! I would definitely order it again.

The place itself is so sick! What a great idea. The tables and wall decor is amazing for any HP fan. 

What I liked most about the place is that you can ACTUALLY study there. It isn't just a touristy spot. The tables have a nice size, there are wall plugs and the loudness level is okay. It is a little dark in there though. Thats the only studying con.

Overall, LOVED it so much!!!"}
{"text":"Been wanting to come here for a while being a Harry Potter fan. We got the Butter Beer Brew and Roasted Almond Latte, they are delicious. 
We also got a waffle with butter beer cream."}
{"text":"Love love love bad owl coffee great service, best coffee in my city, and cute local coffee shop but the new cups suck not only are they smaller but there uneven and lids pop off also was sad to see that bad owl cut ties with the old bakery other than that it's amazing!"}
{"text":"This place is wayyyyyy over-hyped. Service is slow. It took 45 minutes to stand in line and get two coffees. Staff is not very friendly and there aren't enough of them to keep up with the demanding line. The Harry Potter theme is lacking and then don't have a menu board. I've never seen anything like this. I got the Nutella latte and the biscoff latte.. The biscoff latte was great! The Nutella latte, not so great..burnt. This mischief is not managed. Hah..ha.."}
{"text":"The service was great, the Tea and macaroons were yummy, and it's spacious and clean for the facility size. 
They also serve alcohol, which made it even an option for more social situations aside from school/studying. I would definitely visit this place again."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Great coffee, excellent food, and good prices. The butter cream waffles are to die for! Harry Potter themes are all over the menu (think butter beer/ butterscotch flavor). Great atmosphere, and friendly staff. We will come back whenever we are in Las Vegas (although to be honest, we might just move in to their cupboard under the stairs.)"}
{"text":"Friendly staff as well as very inviting themed cafe. (Harry Potter) 
Music playing was oldies and classic rock, in general not loud so good place to relax and finish some emails from work.
I ordered Almond Latte to spoil my self since I generally eat low sugar/ low carb... Totally worth it!"}
{"text":"I've been to Bad Owl a few times. It's not in my neighborhood, but I like meeting friends there. The coffee is tasty - and they always have a good selection of seasonal beverages. The winter peppermint white chocolate mocha was yummy!  It's a cute (but small) cafe and a fun place to hang out. 

On my last visit I had some blueberry toast. It was HUGE and delicious. It was a giant slab of whole grain bread with almond butter, blueberry preserves, almonds and coconut. It was really delicious and filling. It is supposed to have banana, but I'm allergic. Any additional fruit and it probably would have been too much to eat. 

My only complaints are really minor, and not enough for less stars. 1. The mochas aren't ever hot enough for me. I like them super hot. And 2. The sizes feel a little small. I'm paying for higher end ingredients so I appreciate the cost, but I'd like a 20 oz large, not a 16 oz."}
{"text":"Love their lattes, can't keep think about it every morning! I want to try every single latte on their menu, soooooo good! Staff is friendly and this place is packed every morning - they must be doing something right ;)"}
{"text":"This coffee shop is in what seems to be a busy area throughout the whole day. It was kind of tough to find a parking spot when I visited. But hopefully it isn't like that all the time!

So anyway! Obviously, if you LOVE Harry Potter you should visit this place off the bat. The interior decorations did not disappoint. 

But I must say, the music selection was throwing me off. since a lot of coffee shops play similar genres, I came into this shop and thought, \"oh, that's different.\" It was jusomething you wouldn't normally hear at a coffee shop. lol It was no biggie though. Just my own little observation. I only came for the theme of the shop & most importantly to see what their signature drinks were all about! 

I ordered a Butter Beer Latte with espresso. One of the staff members would come out and call your name to hand off your drink which is nice.. Especially when it gets a little busy/loud. The drink was ok, but that's about all I can say, lol. 

As I sat with my friends, I realized a few people.. Not one, but, a few customers were complaining about their drinks being bland. Hmm.. Not a good sign. But the nice part was that they fixed it and made the drinks with adjustments to the customers' liking. 

This shop is definitely eye catching with their decorations and theme. But as far as drinks go, I feel they might need some work.. Or I just need to try more drinks lol."}
{"text":"Awesome, awesome, awesome. Great coffee.  Nice people. Didn't eat this time.  Will next time"}
{"text":"I think I overhyped this in my head. 

I ordered the Butter Brew Latte with a shot of espresso and the avocado toast.  Latte was pretty good.  Kinda sweet for my taste, but it was similar to the hot butterbeer at Universal, just with a shot of espresso in it.  Mine was kinda lukewarm which is a pet peeve of mine.  They plopped it on the counter with no lid on it then the lids they did provide were flimsy and popped off so the coffee spilled on my friend when she went to try it.  

Avocado toast was almost superb BUT it was cold, the eggs were cooked improperly (the whites were runny and the yolks were hard even though it said they were sunny side up), and the avocado was stone cold (which is why the dish was overall cold).  I'm not about that improperly cooked egg life, but if they are hot I can usually let it slide.  Cold slimy eggs aren't my dig though.  

Service is kind of bleh.  None of the employees knew what was going on and the layout of the store is inefficient: you order at the front of the store then all the way in the back an employee quietly calls out your name. Same for when your order your food only they half heartedly try to find you in the dining area.  Something needs to change there. The man who took my order was 100% disinterested in taking my order, which is fine, customer service is hard. 

I guess I wanted a more magical experience but it was only just meh. If for whatever reason I'm in Henderson again, I don't think I'd go back.  Once was enough."}
{"text":"Great, friendly service with coffee to match! Neat atmosphere and comfortable seating"}
{"text":"This place is so cute. The whole cafe has a Harry Potter theme with a retro design. I ordered a medium butter beer iced latte with espresso shot. It was $6.38, quite pricey for a regular caramel iced latte. I didn't taste the espresso, though the girl added whipped cream at no additional charge.  The drink wasn't special or mind blowing at all, just sweet. Overall okay, love the theme because I'm a huge fan of Harry Potter."}
{"text":"I went in around 8 am. No one else in there and it was quiet...my favorite. I was greeted by a friendly barista who briefed me on the popular and new menu items. He was very pleasant. I ordered the nutella latte and a hot chocolate for my daughter who is 2. Then I sat my happy a** in the corner cushy chairs by Hedwig. I loved it. My coffee was made promptly and it was delicious! My daughter's hot chocolate was yummy too and perfectly heated so she could drink it right away. Awesome! As time went by it started getting busier and busier. I wanted to order some breakfast but since it was so busy I skipped it. Seriously, every chair in there had a bum in it. It got loud, which I don't like when I'm in a coffee shop so I left. I like peaceful coffee shops.
The decor was lovely, I'm a huge hp fan! 
My suggestion would be to open more. Maybe it will level out the amount of traffic?"}
{"text":"This place is so cool! Neat, clean, Harry Potter themed! Who could ask for more! The staff was friendly, and the drinks were tasty! I can definitely see coming here on a regular basis and trying the different caffeinated beverages, and just hanging out in a cool atmosphere! I'll be back soon!!"}
{"text":"Not as Harry potter as I would have thought but there pistachio and butter beer coffee are fantastic.  Some of the best coffee I have had."}
{"text":"Love this place! Best coffee & lattes 
Everyone is friendly. Very clean inside. 
They get really busy with a line out he door. But worth the wait. Parking is tight. Open on Sunday's  is nice  as well.
Would definitely recommend"}
{"text":"Super cute place! Excellent coffee. I will definitely be returning try more things on their menu."}
{"text":"My inner teenager jumps for joy as I enter this Harry Potter theme coffee shop. I am freaking ecstatic! 

First time I attempted to come here the line wrapped around and I ditched the place no way I was waiting an hour for some coffee.

Than me and friends tried again on a Tuesday afternoon and it was a lot better, not as busy but once we got our order the line did start to form outside so we came in just in time. 

It's a very small coffee shop. Not many seats available but that's normal. We just took our order to go. Although I did order a Affogato and I wasn't able to get it to go so I had to hurry up and drink/eat it before we could head out. It was pretty good. The ice cream was creamy and with the espresso shot it went very well. 

My friend got the Biscoff latte iced which is basically Cookie Butter latte. That was soooooooooo damn delicious. It is on the sweeter side so getting the smaller size would probably be best. My other friend got the Butter beer latte iced which seemed appropriate considering where we were! That was pretty delicious also but sweet as well. 

I got a spinach quiche to go and I didn't really like it. My friend got a almond croissant which was uhhhmayzingg. Bomb!  

The staff were very nice. If I was in the area again I'd come back!"}
{"text":"I'm not a Harry Potter fan or follower, but I am pleasantly a fan and follower of Bad Owl coffee house. Their Blackberry White Mocha is on point and not oversweetened, so I typically order this latte but as a family we've enjoyed their breakfast items (fluffy hazelnut chocolate filled beignets, healthy overnight oats, and the hearty croissant egg sandwich)! Hands down a reliable and friendly place for consistency in taste, and great service. Proud regular here!"}
{"text":"The environment was great and the drinks were alright, but was a little disappointed that they didn't add whip cream to my blended drink, but were adding it to every other drink, it's sort of an expected thing. The employee making our drinks was talking to friends the whole time while making the drinks, it was hard to maneuver around them and hear our names to get our drinks.. But otherwise the place is very cozy."}
{"text":"My favorite coffee shop in Henderson! This Harry Potter themed shop is a must see if your in Vegas or Henderson. Their drinks are fun and taste great. There food is also delicious! During peak hours on the weekend it is hard to find a spot to sit but luckily I have never not had a hard time getting a spot! It's the perfect place to come and bring your laptop to get work down, or also to meet up with a friend to catch up. I come here about twice a month just to taste out different drinks and I have never found one I did not like."}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere, especially if you're a Harry Potter fan. The coffee is excellent, and they have  some really cool specialty drinks. The Black Forest Late was excellent."}
{"text":"Honestly, where can you go wrong with a Harry Potter theme inspired coffee shop?! I've heard about this for a few years, but decided to come once the \"hype\" had gone down to make my own decision, which is- I like this place! 

I'm a Harry Potter fan (I was the Harry Potter club advisor at my school last year and my science classroom is Harry Potter themed) and this place is decorated Beautifully! From the tables, decor, platform signs, to the drinks and food! 

I definitely recommend an iced lavender white chocolate latte, but I tried the iced Nutella and that was delicious also! (However, I did have to add water to mine because the lavender white chocolate was just a littttlleeee too sweet for my taste). You may want to try their butter beer OF COURSE, but I did not do that. Anddddd the food is actually very well made and tasted delightful! 

Don't forget to check in and receive 20% off your iced drink and remember to take photos! Why not take good ones when Harry Potter world in Universal is still 4 hours away! Get your fix here :)"}
{"text":"Phenomenal coffee **( Automatic 3 stars
Cool @$$ decor * star #4 
Great service * Star #5 
Price -* subtracts one star unfortunately

We were helped as soon as we entered the business. Immediately you get a vibe for what kind of place this is. There are couples and groups of friends scattered throughout the business. You get the fairytale feel instantly. 

I'll start by saying I'm not a coffee snob. In fact a thick cup of the 7-11 junk is usually good enough for me. This was very tasty but it's hard for me to pay primo prices for coffee. It's a solid spot overall, just be prepared to pay for the experience."}
{"text":"So disappointed. Coffee was mediocre. Decor was awful. If you're going to advertise as a Harry Potter themed coffee shop have more than just a stack of suitcases and a sign hanging. It was a whole bunch of missed opportunities. Waiting in line for 15 minutes just to order and then having it ready immediately made no sense. There was only one person behind the counter that seemed to know what he was doing. My boyfriend ordered the cold brew coffee, then was told there wasn't enough. Then he ordered the nitro and had to wait even longer because it ran out. It was just such a disappointment."}
{"text":"The coffee is very good. I like unique shops that aren't chains. People say in their reviews the drinks are \"bland\" but I think that comes from the people who want an overly sweet coffee drink. Yuck.. I personally like to taste the actual coffee and I think the drinks were great. The coffee was strong and delicious without being burnt or bitter. Love how the flavors weren't sugary or artificial tasting. Had toasted almond milk latte and an awesome coconut muffin! They were out of few drink flavors, probably need to work on ordering enough stock eventually. They were crazy busy, tables scarce, and everyone is held up at the counter looking at a small paper menu .. That's the thing they REALLY need is a big menu on the wall or above counter! Hopefully that happens, it would speed up people's decisions."}
{"text":"Went here with my 11 year old son, yesterday. We were recommended to go here as we were waiting for his code class to start that is a couple of doors down from this place.  We walk in and I notice how the lighting is a little dim but comfortable. Before we order, I escort my son to the rest room and he is in awe of the place for some reason, that I am oblivious to.  He goes into the bathroom, which is only for a single person at a time. This goes for the women's bathroom, as well. Then I hear him through the door, \"Oooooh...! I get it...!\" As he comes out he says, \"Dad, this place is Harry Potter themed...! Get it, \"Bad Owl\"...?\" His excitement is due to him being a Harry Potter fan as he completed reading and watching the movie series a month ago. (Clever)

The décor is brilliant and their versatile menu is just as surprising, as well. They have a really good food and wine menu on top of their coffee menu. One of the wines that I noticed that they serve is one of the popular Pinot Noir wines out there: Meiomi. (Legit)

We look through the menu and see the various waffles, lava cakes and sandwiches  that they serve and other items, but decided to go with their grilled cheese, The Wizard Melt. It is served on rye with parm , mozzarella and a mild cheddar. What intrigued me most about the grilled cheese was that it also had avocado inside of it! It also came with a delicious small side salad. Nice consistency and transition of the crunch on the outside of the bread transitioning to it getting softer as you bite more into the sandwich. Not overly gooey, the guac was a very nice compliment to the rye and cheese.  I was delightful and a very welcomed surprise.

I am not a coffee drinker but will give it a try next time I am in, but what I read from the reviews was that it is pretty good.

My review on the food is a cross between health conscious mixed with some sin to it. The Blueberry Almond Butter Toast  and maybe one of the lava cakes that they serve is something that I do want to try when we come back.

The service was great! The staff were polite and personable.

There is free WiFi, as well.

Definetly looking forward to coming back, but I think my son is looking forward to it more."}
{"text":"Love the Harry Potter theme! They could do so much more, though! But, I enjoyed the little details!
Tables were dirty, coffee was weak, and very overpriced for the size! 
Staff seemed nice. 
Unfortunately, I don't plan on returning."}
{"text":"Great drinks, great food, friendly staff, and fun Harry Potter ambiance! If you check in with Yelp Bad Owl offers 20% off your iced or blended drink. I love a good deal and I love this place!"}
{"text":"To start off, this cafe is a little bit too overhyped. Even as a Harry Potter fan, I was disappointed. Service was great when it comes to seeing smiling faces, but a let down when it came to honesty. My friend asked what were the best drinks and all the cashier could say was all of them were really good. We understand that as a worker you need to sell the products of your place, but we wanted an honest answer. 

My friend decided to get the Mint Mojito Latte because the cashier said that it was her favorite. It tasted terrible. The Mint Mojito was basically just strong expresso with mint leaves. Literally, mint leaves. The taste of both items mixed together was so strong and it didn't blend well. None of my friends liked the drink, even those who love mint flavored things.

The second drink we got was the Almond Latte. This drink was slightly better than the Mint Mojito but it wasn't the best. You don't taste the almond flavor at all in your latte until you're crunching the tiny bits of almond in your mouth. It didn't bother us that there was almond chunks, it bothered us that the almonds and latte didn't blend well either.

Lastly, I decided to try the Butterbrew Latte, which is what most yelpers recommend. In my opinion, this is the best drink we tried all night, and my friends thought so too. The nice thing about this latte is that you can get it with or without the expresso. Without the expresso, it basically tastes like milk tea. The only problem I had with my drink was that about 3/4 of my cup was filled with ice, so I didn't feel like I got my money's worth. Unlike the first two drinks I mentioned, this drink uses butterscotch syrup for flavoring. 

Overall, this is a decent place but I will not return unless I crave for some Butterbrew Latte. This cafe tries to be different by using real ingredients rather than syrup or powder but most of those drinks end up tasting bad.  Service is okay and the wait isn't long if you go at night."}
{"text":"They are out of the Butter Beer syrup, so if you're planning on coming today for that reason, you might want to hold off.  Line is also out the door, but our drinks are delicious."}
{"text":"Very cool coffee house. Great quality...I tried the Spanish coffee...Amazing! And red velvet waffles."}
{"text":"4-stars despite the exorbitant amount of time it took for their *Charmingly Pesto* sandwich to come out. The time it took was nearing 30 minutes, so I opted to have it as take out instead. The very busy worker was great about changing this up for me. I enjoyed it later at the airport (somehow made it), and it was charmingly good indeed. I had also ordered the *Lavender Latte*. Mild on the lavender, but creamy and enjoyable. It was busy so the latte art was rushed, but that's no biggie. 

You could say that this shop is a tourist trap since it is Harry Potter themed and very grabby for those just coming from the airport or on their way there (like me). They don't seem to have their Butterbrew latte anymore or at least they didn't when I popped in. In fact, the only Harry Potter themed coffee product was their 'Flight of the Hippoglyph' which was like a flight of 3-4 espresso shots, so nope. It should be noted that their 'Kyoto' cold brew was very recommended. It's brewed for 16 hours and supposedly very strong. I'd say check it out, but make sure you have a lot of time on your hands."}
{"text":"This place is great! I'm not a Harry Potter fanatic but the atmosphere was very cool.  I got the avocado toast with a glass of Moscato.  The service was fantastic. I was able to sit at a bench near power outlets so I can work on my laptop. Just a very cool place. Looking forward to coming back and bringing people!"}
{"text":"Be prepared for a huge wait lol.  30+ min wait yesterday for over two hours and no tables
 =\
 I arrived a few min before the friend I was meeting so that I could have a few moments to fan-girl in private, however not much fan girling happened as the places was totally packed, and while the decor was nice, the over all Diagon Ally feel just wasn't there as I had hoped and imagined. That being said, the decor was \"okay\" and missing several key elements to make it amazing. There were some parts that I love and others that were a huge let down. 

Coffee was pretty good but the wait for it was not, nor was the wait to order.

The biggest disappointment was the Barista was clearly not a Harry Potter fan as she looked at me confused when I requested my coffee be labeled as Mrs. Malfoy, and then the barista who called my order couldn't figure out who it was by reading my cup. Seriously though- somewhere like that, with a specific theme, the employees should definitely be knowledgable about the topic even if they aren't a super fan like myself."}
{"text":"Super cute idea. Everyone loves Harry Potter! Ordered the Matcha Latte. It was bold in flavor so I really liked that. The designs were nice and cozy. Tables each had a quote on them related to Harry Potter. Can't wait for the place to expand. Seats can be taken quickly."}
{"text":"Quaint coffee place that just opened up recently. Would enjoy more Harry Potter themed stuff, but the coffee was good and I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I feel like they just went to the Halloween store and found some decorations that would fit. I don't feel the concept was completely thought out. 
The drinks could be improved. The lavender latte was almost savory but didn't have a good flavor. It was also not hot but more luke warm. The chai tea latte was a basic chai. The butter brew latte was super sweet. The sizes are ridiculous for the price. Their large is like a Starbucks medium and the lids don't fit on the iced drink cups. They leak all over. It hangs over like a sombrero. Beware of tipping.  I selected no tip but it charged three dollars tip. On top of already expensive drinks. The large drinks we ordered (really more like medium drinks) were almost six dollars a piece. Honestly I would skip. Our group is composed of huge Harry Potter fans but we wouldn't go back. It doesn't even feel Harry Potter themed."}
{"text":"Harry Potter + Local grounds + Nerd Culture = A whimsical caffeinated adventure. 

Bad Owl is a great new coffee shop located in Henderson and to be honest we really needed a dedicated coffee brewing spot that wasn't a Starbucks. With Mothership Coffee Roasters far down the road and Tangerine cafe being more like a lunch cafe, having a dark unique coffee spot is just what the neighborhood needed.

If you're a lover Harry Potter you will most likely get a solid magic wand as you as you walk-in and see the décor, it's set up like the train station (Platform 9¾) that and Harry and crew descend upon when heading to Hogwarts. Faux bricks, \"Hedwig\" the owl, and random stacks of luggage can be found in this place along with a great coffee bar and sweet some snacks. 

This spot keeps it local with coffee from Colorado Coffee Roasters and has all of the coffee shop favorites; espresso, lattes, iced coffee and even some nitro brew on tap. But when you come to Bad Owl Coffee you need to get something off the specialty menu, how about a Butter Beer Latte with an extra shot, yes please. This is a very smooth latte that doesn't have an insane sweet taste and is a great coffee option for someone, like myself, looking for a lightly sweetened and very creamy hot coffee drink. They also have a slew of other unique beverages...

- Lavender Lattes w/ house made lavender
- Spanish Latte w/ Sweet cream and espresso
- Mint Mojito Latte w/ mint leaves muddled into sweet and creamy milk
- Cookie butter latte made with real cookie butter

You get the point! 

Free Wi-Fi, tabletops covered in spells, and a chill vibes. I'm in! - Sippius, Slurpius, Maximo!"}
{"text":"Eh. I'm from out of town and came here excited as a Harry Potter fan. I got two cups of tea and it was $10, way too expensive for tea and for the quality. The staff were friendly. But despite lots of staff it was pretty slow (line was not out the door) and also pretty dirty inside. 

The loud 90's punk music didn't help - kind of a half-hearted stab at a Harry Potter theme, and mediocre everything, at best. The decorations were fun. Overall, nothing to go out of your way for."}
{"text":"I was super hyped to go because i LOVE all things Harry Potter.  But once I passed the awesome decor and took my obligatory photo by Platform 9 3/4 I was less than impressed by their drinks.  I came with 7 of my family and friends so we all tried something different and none of the drinks stood out.  They were either too sweet or their flavors didn't mix well together.  I'm willing to give this place another try only for their awesome theme and decorations, but add an owl and some HP references to a Starbucks and it would be a better spot.  3 stars only because their decorations are noteworthy!"}
{"text":"I'm a huge Harry Potter fan so when my friend told me about this cute spot in town, I had to check it out. Of course when I finally decide to go, the Groupon that I have been eyeing forever now is no longer available. Go figure. But that won't stop me
from going. Ha.

I got here early around 8am and it was fairly quiet. Maybe two groups of people in here at the time. The decor here is so cute. Love the rustic feel too. So many Harry Potter memorabilia. Very cute.

I ordered the Chestnut Toffee Latte. It came out pretty perfect, no sugar needed. Then when I got my coffee, I saw someone else' food order and I decided to get the same thing. I ordered the Breakfast Waffle. Waffles were very fluffy. My kid loved it with the butter, no syrup needed. A nice surprise was the yogurt, which I didn't know what that little side dish was until I tasted it. It was vanilla yogurt with pineapple jam. Quite tasty. And it reminded me of a pinã colada yogurt. Yum! The eggs were done too well for my taste. I wish it was a sunny side up with a little runny yolk. I may have to request this next time.

This place filled up pretty quickly by the time we left. Harry Potter fans must stop in here for sure. 

All in all, this is a cute spot. The staff is nice and helpful. Bonus, they offer craft beer and wine too. Who would have thought? I'll be back!"}
{"text":"The Harry Potter theme drew me in to this coffee shop the first time I went. Bad Owl Coffee has a charming atmosphere and a great beverage menu. I love the Nutella latte and the butter brew latte with an added shot of espresso. While the pastries they serve are great, I wouldn't give the sandwiches another shot. This last visit I tried the wizard melt, which sounded great, a grilled cheese with three different types of cheese and guacamole and tomatoes. However the sandwich wasn't hot and the cheese wasn't melted, which was surprising considering the wait. Every time I have been here the staff has always been extremely friendly and helpful. Aside from the amazing coffee and overall ambience, they are a part of the reason I keep coming back."}
{"text":"Came in today to get a coffee and my daughter a waffle. I had asked for the sauce to be put on the side because we had a little bit of a drive home and i didnt want her food to get soggy and mushy. When we got home, to my surprise the worker put the sauce on the side but had NEGLECTED to put a freaking lid on the container. All of the sauce ended up spilling all over and making everything soggy. How could you forget a simple thing as a lid! Wont be going back here again"}
{"text":"Well, what can I say if you love Harry Potter obviously this is the right place for you. I heard wind of a Harry Potter coffee shop but when I walked in I was to surprise still to see it was actually a Harry Potter coffee shop. The decorations are done very well it's very elegant yet still with the theme. 

I asked the lady taking orders what she would recommend and I was a little disappointed when she kind of did not know what to tell me I ended up with the butter brew coffee I believe it's called and it is delicious!! 

 I do however think that the employees here and we need a lesson on customer service and friendliness this is an exciting business and I think they need to be excited about it and have a bit more of a conversation with customers."}
{"text":"The coffee is to die for, if the Dementors don't get you first! I tried some butter beer and fell in love, while my friend ran around the coffee shop having a nerd fit. Super adorable and definitely returning."}
{"text":"Even without the chatty (but friendly) cashier, lines were still long. I would recommend putting a star or something on the menu to indicate best sellers. The wait to pay is longer than the wait to get the coffee.

Lavender white mocha is popular, my friend ordered it and said it was good. Lavender was subtle and she was happy with it. 

I've been to three different coffee shops in LV and ordered Nutella lattes... All 3 disappointed me until I tried the one at Bad Owl. It's a bit too sweet for me, but bad owl captures the Nutella flavor perfectly and blows out the other 3 coffee places, illumilatte, sunrise coffee, and the human bean."}
{"text":"Ugh took me long enough to finally visit Bad Owl. 
I did not come here for the coffee, but I came to check out the Harry Potter decor. 
(The cafe boasts a pretty decent selection of wines and food as well if you're not much of a tea or coffee drinker.) 

I ordered the smallest size of the Butter Brew iced latte and the Belgium waffles ($9) with Butter Brew cream ($5). The waffles comes with a tiny cup of butter, two cups of maple syrup, and a cup of one scoop of vanilla ice cream. As for my final verdict, the latte was alright and the waffles were quite good. You have the option to add espresso to your latte -which I said yes to- and it was a bad choice to pair it with the waffles. Once I had the waffles and then took sips from my latte, boyyy was it bitter! One of my friends had the Pistachio latte ( and I wanted to steal her drink instead.

All in all, my friends and I had a wonderful time. There's a high chance that we'll be coming back :-)"}
{"text":"Well, the mad hype and mad rush is over! I couldn't be happier!! 
I love hanging out once a week (sometimes twice) and having my latte served in a nice mug with beautiful art thanks to barista LUKE ! 
My new favorite is the lavender latte. I am trying everything so it's possible next month I'll have a different favorite.

Seriously , the staff here has been awesome , the drinks are wonderful and I love the coziness of Bad Owl."}
{"text":"This place was amazing. I'm a huge Harry Potter fan myself and I love what they did with the place. Needless to say I will be back here for the coffee and for the atmosphere. It is a little crowded when I went because it has gotten pretty popular.

I got the hot butterbeer latte. It's amazing! It's a must have if its your first visit!"}
{"text":"Great hip place. Harry Potter themed. Maxing staff and service. Great Nutella Latte. The coffees are a bit strong for me in general. Wifi. And they have board games which is awesome"}
{"text":"Really cute coffee shop. The staff is friendly and polite. They play pleasant not too loud music. Coffee is pretty good. Definitely give it a try."}
{"text":"My first time here and I like it. I like their decor, their coffee selections, their simple menu and most of all their hospitality.

Decor: if you're into the rustic wood, industrial pipe etc... you will love this place. I am not sure how often they start their cold brew but when we were there they started a new brew and it is very cool to watch whether you have seen ice cold coffee brewing or not. And if you're Harry Porters fan, it is a plus to check this out, I am not (sorry!)
Caffeine: they have a variety of exotic coffee. Some of them take between 4 to 24 hours to brew; including cold brew. I was working my way down the coffee menu starting with V60. Others include Kyoto Cold Brew, Nitrogen Cold brew and Barista Cold Brew. The barista gave me a small cup of Nitrogen Cold Brew and I LOVE it, my fiancé is not a coffee drinker and she loves it... that is something. 
Simple menu: I am not a big fan of a huge menu that takes hours to navigate through. But don't mistake it for not having enough to choose from. 
Hospitality: the barista took time to explain me the different type of brewing they have. Knowing that I love coffee, he even suggested a few places closer to where we live since I stated that this coffee shop is a bit far for us. Yet, I don't think it will stop us from coming as my fiancé loves it and she does not like most coffee shops. If she picks this coffeeshop over a boba shop to go to study, you have to check it out. 

Update: while we are still here studying/working, the barista brought out sample of the Kyoto Cold Brew and Ice Cold Brew for us to try (thank you!). If you love the acidic in your coffee, this your type. I feel like the Kyoto is bit more earthy. I still love the Nitrogen more, it feels really smooth... like dark beer. I know it is a strange comparison but you just have to try it and love it."}
{"text":"Ordered through uber eats. Everything we had tasted amazing! Ham egg and cheese croissant awesome, prosciutto and goat cheese toast amazing, and of course cookie butter waffles sooooo good! We actually went to the restaurant before and I dunno what we ordered, but it wasn't awesome... this time it was awesome! Oh and coconut white mocha amazing!!"}
{"text":"Cute little place and it really has great coffee! Friendly staff, good service and the likelihood of me making this a place to meet is great!"}
{"text":"Huge fan of cold brew coffee, get it every where I go, and let me tell you they know how to do a cup of cold brew. Also, their nitro brew is amazing as well. I recommend adding a bit of the salted cream, out of this world. Their coffee is genuinely so smooth it doesn't even need sweetener. If I was rating the service alone, 5 stars +++. Everyone is so nice and genuinely just seems to want you to get the best cup of coffee. Me and my boyfriend went and got cold brew, Spanish latte, croissant and sandwhich and it came to about $35.. Definitely not cheap and the only reason I had to deduct a star! Just for a cup of coffee though, it's comparable to any other decent coffee place."}
{"text":"Harry Potter- and owl-themed coffee shop with outstanding Apple Malt Tea in a neat teapot and a good butterbeer latte. There are a lot of interesting flavors and pastries that we want to try next time, and the staff was incredibly friendly, even on the exceptionally busy grand opening."}
{"text":"Yummy latte. Nice atmosphere. Wished they were open later but definitely  coming back."}
{"text":"My wife told me adopt this Harry Potter themed coffee house called Bad Owl. We found ourselves in the area and we're excited to swing by and check it out. 

It is a small venue nestled in a strip of businesses. As we walked through a wall of nicotine that is outside the control of the business, we entered into another world. The decoration is on par with the theme. We didn't make it far inside as there was a long line. We were passed a clipboard with a menu to help expedite the process. The regular coffee options were available with some teas and small food acutramants. The drink that jumped out at me was the butter brew latte. My mind was made up. 

We waited in line for 15 minutes and waited an additional 8 for our coffee. The staff Is friendly and nice and eager to answer any question you have. Once your order is placed there is no sense of urgency to crank out the joyous nectar the make. Our drinks were made and handed out. My butter brew latte was exactly as I imagined. It was good as I sipped it and looked for a place to sit and take in the experience. There was nothing available so we left. 

The coffee was good and worth a try if you're in the area. As we left the line was out the door. As I checked in I observed other yeplers shared a long wait time in line. Hopefully they will get quicker as time goes on. I will revisit the establishment in a month and hopefully I can give it more than 3 stars."}
{"text":"Found this place through Groupon and it sounded interesting and I think I got over excited for a new coffee place but even more so a Harry Potter theme one I figured let's go try it.  Luckily I got the 2 Groupons for $10.  This place is too pricey in my opinion.  The bill turned out around $23 for 2 coffees,  1 tea,  a chocolate milk and a few mini donuts.  The lavender latte was a big no.  Tasted like medicine.  The butter brew was way too sweet.  I ordered a hot tea lychee peach- which was $4.50 way too expensive for just tea.  The menu stated loose-leaf tea.  It was a tea bag...  Although the concept of the coffee shop is nice it's not somewhere I would go back to."}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere of this coffee shop!  Coffee flavors and menu offerings are unique and service was much more personal than larger chains.  KUDOS to Bad Owl!  Love the place!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here while on our trip in Las Vegas. The friend we were staying with recommended the place.  Harry Potter fans, you are in for a treat!

I have never read a Harry Potter book, only seen maybe a movie or two, but without a doubt, this place feels magical! From the details in the decor to the menu items, I could tell that there was a lot of thought put into this cafe. I had an iced roasted almond latte, which was 4/5 good and my boyfriend treated himself to an afternoon stout. 

This cafe wasn't particularly special to either one of us because we're not major Harry Potter fans, but there were definitely some fanatics there. I would recommend Bad Owl Coffee to my wizard friends!"}
{"text":"I've been searching Henderson for a coffee place that isn't a chain and doesn't feel like it's in a strip mall. For those from Las Vegas it might not be obvious why that would be a goal, because here, mall and strip mall vibes tend more to be the rule than the exception--but for people who love or accustomed to thriving downtowns and like to support high-quality locally and independently owned shops, restaurants, cafes, cute coffee nooks, and other businesses, you will completely adore Bad Owl Coffee. And so will anyone else, as far as I can imagine!

A rare and refreshing cultural, aesthetic, oasis. 

It is in a strip mall -- but that's totally ok, and feels worlds away.  The interior is at once handsome, airy, and welcoming.  The walls are a mix of barn siding and what looks like grey brick, and the floors are super nice wide-plank wood.  This is one of the first places I've been here without fluorescent lighting (with the exception of spendy posh restaurants) -- instead there's very hip/sleek but at the same time vintage/rustic lighting fixtures that look like something....maybe out of Harry Potter? And guess what? If you haven't already gathered...this is a Harry Pottered themed coffeeshop. What?! Yes, seriously. 

Harry Potter isn't something that's ever been my thing, but that's ok -- not a requirement -- but if you are, there are lots of cool little references (e.g., sign above the kitchen:  Wizards Welcome --Muggles Tolerated-- ).

The latte is the best I've found since leaving San Francisco. The \"Charmingly Pesto\" sandwich -- ciabatta bread, chicken chunks, garden-fresh pesto, juicy avocado, roasted red peppers, melty cheese -- was outstanding. 

Air conditioned to the *perfect* temperature on this 115 degree day -- which is saying something, since many places here are cooled to the painful temperature of a meat locker.

Strong wifi and good tunes -- super friendly, helpful, kind, and knowledgeable staff -- what more could you want, really?  

I live about 4 miles away, but suspect this will be my go-to spot herein."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge coffee fan but I've gotta say everything I tried here has been AMAZING!! Love the decorations and atmosphere everyone really seems to love it too. Yes there's a long wait but it's only because it's worth it! Just go when you're not in a rush because you'll want to enjoy your coffee/tea there. This time I tried the green tea affogato and omg it's so good!! It's a little strong because it's with a shot of espresso but the ice cream makes it sweeter and sooo good! This is definitely my favorite coffee place"}
{"text":"Today was truly a treat. The staff was beyond friendly and fast. It's a Friday during the work day so I didn't experience any of the long lines that have been described. I liked my iced lavender white mocha so much I was contemplating ditching the Almighty Starbucks. I can't ditch the bucks due to multuple locations and drive throughs...And, I usually drive my sleeping baby around and get caffeine to keep my sanity. My husband enjoyed his nitro cold brew and described it as unique. This is nice of his because he usually nods and says good or ok or grunts if he doesn't like it. It is definitely for dark coffee lovers with no sweeteners or cream/milk. 5 stars for service, cleanliness of facility, and tastings of beverages. I expect I will become a regular. Especially since I now know they have sandwiches. Excellent theme and wonderful atmosphere."}
{"text":"went to their soft soft opening on saturday and it was great.  the tea we had was really good and the butterbeer was amazing.  can't wait to come back once they open"}
{"text":"Today, April 1st and Fred and George's birthday, I was out confusing the muggles, so I thought this would be a great place to stop. There was no line but all the tables were full. Good atmosphere, not over done on the HP theme (bad for me but good for the muffles I guess) loved the tables as you can see from my pics. I ordered the lavender latte. The fact that there is no actual coffee in the drinks is perfect for me because I don't need any additional caffeine in my life. Siriusly. It was herbal. As others stated, herbal NOT floral. Eh. I should've ordered the butterbeer latte I guess but I don't think I'd drive all the way back over here for a second visit."}
{"text":"So I decided to drive across town to try this new bad owl coffee shop. When I first arrived, there was a line out the door and down the sidewalk a bit. It's what to be expected on opening week and definitely being Harry Potter themed. So after about a 30 minute wait I get to the counter. The lady there was very helpful and friendly. She recommended a couple drinks which I bought both for myself. They were very efficient and got the drinks out really fast. 
     The only reason why I have this place 4 stars was because of the amazing service and decor. I would have liked for the coffee names and pastries to have a more creative Harry Potter is name to them. Overall though with the actual coffee beverages, I'm not impressed at all. I ordered the iced butter beer latte which just tasted like a caramel frap with maybe a hint of butterscotch. I've had butter beer from the wizarding world of harry potter and I was expecting this latte to bring me back memories of that magical moment, but it didn't. The biscoff was pretty good, but nothing extravagant. I feel anyone can get this flavor and kind of coffee anywhere else rather than driving across town for it. It reminded me too much of Starbucks. I for sure would rather drive out of my way for dutch brothers. Sorry bad owl. I probably won't be returning."}
{"text":"This place is awesome and worth the drive. Not only does it have decorations to thrill the Harry Potter fanatic, but the food and beverages are delicious. Plenty of seating and not overly busy. 

I got the love mint late - perfect blend of sweet mint with espresso, haven't seen this late anywhere else before either. 

I also got the pumpkin waffle with butterbeer whip cream - which is the reason why I ordered it. The cinnamon pumpkin batter was perfect with the cream cheese syrup! The fresh fruit that came with it was a perfect addition :)"}
{"text":"New fav place. Love the coffee and breakfast here. Love the mint latte and breakfast croissant"}
{"text":"Coffee is good very interesting menu better than Starbucks. The only thing is the people that work there are rude I asked about some drinks it was like I was bothering them very rude always looks like they hate when people come in . But great stuff coffee is good just need to improve there customer service"}
{"text":"I was really excited about this new coffee shop because of the Harry Potter theme and the decor looked really great. I had the coconut latte with almond milk, and it tasted really good. However, for the amount of coffee you get, the prices were way too high. $4.90 for a small latte seems a bit much, and that's before you add almond/soy milk for $0.55 

I think the novelty of the shop will definitely bring business, but unless the prices go down, I don't think it would last long. I know that I won't be returning very often, which is sad because it's so close to my house."}
{"text":"The atmosphere and staff was fun, the signature Butter latte was amazing. Any real HP nerd would love this charming shop!"}
{"text":"Wow, I love this place.  The environment and ambiance of this place makes me forget I'm in Las Vegas.  The Harry Potter concept is fresh!  The customer service is 5 star!  I'm not into the big corporate coffee chains, I love supporting small businesses like this.  
Now to the drinks...
I had the butter beer latte and it's so delicious!
I think I found a new coffee spot."}
{"text":"This is like a mini trip to Harry Potter World without the long drive and the price tag. The coffee shop is cozy with a whimsical touch throughout. They also have some custom made drinks, including homemade syrups and a roasted almond latte with ground nuts in the drink. This is a great escape from reality with good coffee to boot."}
{"text":"Had the pleasure of dropping in here on the date of the 20-year Harry Potter anniversary! Cool decor, good black coffee & fast wifi. Can't ask for much else. Looking forward to trying their food next time I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"The service is good and the salted cream nitro keeps me coming back. It's a cute local cafe where you can sit and poke around on your computer and sip the morning away. Don't be afraid to ask for specifics like \"half sweet\" on your coffee drinks. They're happy to oblige or make recommendations."}
{"text":"The coffee is great really rich and creamy!"}
{"text":"this is one of my favorite coffee shops! the interior design is amazing and comforting. the drawings on the coffees are beautiful as well"}
{"text":"I had a hot vanilla latte and it was good (but it could have been a lot hotter). It is so nice to have a coffee shop in the area that is not a chain. It is on the expensive side but I look forward to frequenting this coffee shop and trying out more menu items as well as supporting a local business owner."}
{"text":"Very cool spot.  Reminds me what Starbucks used to be. Yummy cappachinos and quiche.  Love the atmosphere"}
{"text":"Had a cappuccino. The decor is cute and worth to check out for all you Harry Potter fans. Knocking down the stars cause the cafe lacks variety in their food. There are not options for everyone here. It's also ridiculously cold in here. As for the other drinks I'm a health nut and try to stay away from refined sugar drinks and foods. Also another reason I knocked the star down."}
{"text":"Lines are long. Somewhat slow at register. Drink selection pretty good. Party of 4 with 4 macaroons and specialty coffees $35. Pricey $$$ and a novelty for Harry Potter peeps...."}
{"text":"I have wanted to visit Bad Owl for years now so it was great discovering that it was just across the street from Bro's new apartment! No excuses not to visit now.

It was the perfect mix of busy but not too busy when we arrived around 2pm. Bro and I ended up ordering iced mint lattes and Mimi, a mocha. Be sure to smash that Yelp check-in button as I was able to get 20% off the iced lattes. Our drinks were quickly and expertly prepared and there was not a dissatisfied person in our little crew. The iced mint latte was delicious, right down to the mint leaves at the bottom of the cup. Mimi enjoyed her mocha as well. 

The Harry Potter vibes were fun -- obviously trying to avoid a copyright lawsuit (Platform 9 and 6/8, anyone?) but still close enough to delight any wizardry fan coming in for a delicious drink."}
{"text":"Yes they are fairly new, but they really need to get they're stuff in order. They made me wait an additional 30 minutes because they had to refill the Nutella bottle!? Wtf why not just pour it in. Anyway they had blended my drink and it was just sitting there waiting for Nutella I saw the guy pour some espresso then the Nutella arrives and wait ... The Asian lady (I assume is a manager or owner) pours in 4 additional scoops of ice to my already blended drinks .. Am I seeing this shit happen??  She makes 4 drinks instead of 2 and they taste more of ice than anything else.  The lady then gives the first two drinks to a customer who just had placed the order. I was so furious I wanted to throw the drink at this lady. Expensive watered down drinks with only 1 shot of espresso for 4 drinks. I was so freaking mad after waiting in line 1 1/2 hours I get this crap drink. I only went to take my sister which her drink was great ( hence 1 star) she received hers in a timely manner.

I would like my money back!!!"}
{"text":"Iced rose almond milk latte goodness! 

Anything rose flavored, I'm all over. I should probably start a list so I can keep tabs. The coffee. A small 12oz has two shots of espresso in it. I was running on two hours of sleep but needed something to keep me up while my boyfriend was down the street at St. Rose. I'm glad I asked how many shots of espresso were in the drinks. Normally there's two in a small and medium and three in the large. Here there are two, three, and FOUR-- make sure you double check if you're used to Starbucks' espresso pours. 

I was worried about asking for almond milk as it sometimes ends up tasting gritty but they use quality stuff and it was very smooth. I asked for my beverage half sweetened, and overall was completely impressed. 

Not too many tables and while they're cute they've VERY small- it would be hard to do the typical college books all Willy Wonka sprawl. Wish I didn't live so far!!"}
{"text":"The muggle in me had to stop and check this place out while on a day trip to Vegas. This place is nicely themed...they recommended the Spanish Latte, yum. I also ordered the traditional Belgian Waffle with ButterBrew creme, my girls devoured it."}
{"text":"Went here last night to get a lavender latte and OMG I can't wait to go back! The staff was super friendly and the coffee was to die for. 10 THUMBS UP"}
{"text":"AMAZING COFFEE. Atmosphere is cozy and geektastic. staff super friendly, food was great. They had warned me prior it was a 15 minute wait which I did not mind at all. I had the Padfoot Pumpkin Waffles, perfection! And i loved that the whipped cream was butterbeer flavored! Will definitely visit again! :)"}
{"text":"Not great customer service. Not enough employees to even help the amount of people walking in the door."}
{"text":"This place has fixed the early problems and is now one of my favorite coffee shops in town. Great cappuccino!"}
{"text":"Food is decent. 
Wait is long to order.
Small tight space.
Some orders were forgotten. 
Order chocolate croissant of which was charged for. Later sever bright out croissant with dipping chocolate sauce since they ran out. Have 20% discount card to return. 
Drink spilled they were kind enough to replace. 
They need more support staff and larger space. 
Would not come back."}
{"text":"Delicious coffee, great decor, and nice ambiance with the Harry Potter theme.  The coffee itself was delicious but takes a while to make.  The prices are the biggest problem, where they range from $4-7 for a regular cup of coffee, latter, or tea.  This is strip prices because of the supposed Harry Potter theme.   I personally don't think that you can charge an extra dollar just because the latte is \"butter beer\" flavor.  I most likely will not be back but it's a nice gimmick."}
{"text":"I'm updating my review because after the 10 or more times that I have been there I have realized, I just don't like Bad Owl.

The place is small, the lines are long and it doesn't even have Harry Potter stuff. 

I've gone there multiple times and have liked the coffee less and less. The flavoring is always inconsistent when I go unless Mike or Teddy are making it. They do a good job and take instructions pretty well.

I like their grilled cheese sandwich but that's about it. So, I only go to this coffee shop for their food.. weird. 

The staff is very nice so that is their plus 1 star."}
{"text":"Fun, trendy venue with awesome coffee and good eats. They have beer and wine, too. A great place for remote work when you need a change of scenery. Definitely worth a visit!"}
{"text":"Waited in line and this girl kept talking and talking and talking so.....I got out of line sat down and decided to film her. She wouldn't shut up talking about personal crap. Very bad service. Think twice before coming in."}
{"text":"Employees are very friendly and it's so quite. Good for studying. Will definitely book mark for our next visit."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS place , it's amazing . Who doesn't enjoy a cup of joe to make your day much better . WELL THIS place can give you that and more , I can tell they take pride of what they do . They have a menu for their specialty drinks , they also have NITRO brew coffee and a 9hr brewing coffee machine , and if you don't know what flavor or the different type of coffee bean they can help you by you buying a FLIGHT of espresso Is something to try ! This place has a very welcoming feeling and mood lighting and mood music to relax and enjoy if you sit there and enjoy the ambiance while you are working on your school project or work project in your laptop or just simply enjoying the company of your friends and family. IF you are a BIG fan of Harry Potter or dr WHO , you will definitely enjoy the decorations and you will understand them . The staff is very great and friendly and they want to make sure you will enjoy and have an awesome experience of that cup of coffee or tea whether you will drink there or take it to go . Is A MUST TRY !!"}
{"text":"I came here to meet someone whom I connected to through the Bumble platform...It's a great place to bring someone, you've just met because the place has a great vibe, cool decor, the service is good and friendly and they even have a beer and wine menu (in case you're nervous). My new friend ordered the quiche which was tasty (not the best ever but not the worst either), we both ordered an iced green tea matcha beverage (can't remember the name) with almond milk it was very tasty. The people at the table next to us had what appeared to be avocado toast, and coffee in a press which looked wonderful!  I had instant entree envy and when I come back, that's what I'll be ordering!! Hopefully with my new friend at my side!  Lol:)"}
{"text":"Great coffee and great conversations. They have alternatives for people who are non-dairy. 
And I love the Harry Potter theme of this place!!"}
{"text":"So today is the 2nd time giving this place a try only because I wasn't too impressed the first time.  This second time, I got super lucky with the line.  There was only a couple of customers in front of me which was better than waiting 15 min last time.  I can't rant and rave about the \"Harry Potter\" décor because I don't know too much about Harry Potter, so I'll just skip to the service.  The first and second time I went in there were only 3 workers at the counter.  The register person who takes your money and grabs your \"pastry/dessert\" if you ordered any and then either one or two people making drinks.  I honestly think the register person shouldn't handle the pastry even though he use tongs to grab the pastry to pack or to warm up, he doesn't actually wash his hands in between customers.  Registers shouldn't prep food unless they wash or at least sanitize hands prior to.  And I feel that while the register person grabs food, it slows down the order taking process.  They should hire more baristas.     

The first time I came, I wasn't sure what to order.  I went with what people were saying was \"popular\" like their Butter Beer Latte.  Tried it, wasn't too impressed.  Just butterscotch flavor with milk.  I ordered their fruit tart.  While the flavor was good, the tart crust itself was hard as a rock.  It was just so hard to even penetrate it with a fork.  I literally had to pick up and bite into it.  After that experience, I just had to give it another shot.  Looked at their menu again before coming the second time being sure I ordered something I was more familiar with when I go to a Starbucks or other coffee shops.  The second go around I tried the Blended Bar, Matcha.  It was okay for me.  And I also tried the mushroom quiche.  That was pretty good.   Heated, the pastry was flakey and flavorful.  

My cousins from Colorado wanted to try this spot out, and when I asked what they thought, there weren't impressed either.  My cousin's words were, \"The wait time wasn't worth the mediocre drink.\"

So with all that being said, will I come back?  Maybe, if I'm in the mood for a blended drink or quiche and it was the only coffee shop and when there is no line.  Happy Eatings or Drinking!"}
{"text":"Very neat Harry Potter inspired coffee shop. Cool vibe/good energy. The customer service was great. The cashier and baristas were very friendly as well as fast and efficient. Ordered the lavender latte and am hooked! So good!"}
{"text":"Cute little coffee shop with very tasty coffees. I've had the lavender latte - which is completely different from the lavender latte I've had at Makers & Finders in downtown (hint, hint: go to Makers & Finders). Another time I had the salted caramel which was waaay better than the lavender latte I initially had. I would've never known this was a HP themed coffee shop. I don't watch Harry Potter but I love me some coffee. There's really nothing spectacular here, I've yet to try this butter beer latte that people are raving about. Maybe next time I'm in the area, but I wouldn't go out of my way."}
{"text":"Love love love this place! A bit crowded since it's still new but the staff is very efficient and friendly. I ordered an iced butterbeer latte and my friend got the Blooming Beach Flower tea. Both drinks were delicious. The decorations are super cute and each table had something Harry Potter related written on it such as \"Wingardium Leviosa\" and my favorite \"Expresso Patronum\". On our way out, I decided I wasn't caffeinated enough and ordered a lavender latte to go. I enjoyed that way more than the butterbeer latte. Will definitely come again."}
{"text":"I really love the concept of this place. Not overly Harry Potter themed which helps appeal to all instead of just to Harry Potter fans  (of which I am one). The layout is a *teeny* bit awkward and cramped but the dark, mysterious/magical aesthetics totally make up for it (HP fans: think of a classy, spiffed up version of the Leaky Cauldron, and you'll understand). 

I personally loved the coffee I've tried. A bit overpriced but it's still good. I have tried the Black forest mocha latte, blackberry white mocha latte, and the lavender white mocha latte. All delicious 

Definitely worth a try, but due to price and location I can't frequent it as much as I'd like, but it's perfect for a weekend day when you can tromp around and enjoy the experience"}
{"text":"This place is pretty cool. Cute HP decor and they have a decent selection on their menu. The only reason I knocked off 1 star is because we ordered the lavender white mocha, which I was pretty excited to try especially since the girl taking our order hyped it up as well. But as soon as I tasted it, there was not even a hint of lavender, and it just tasted like a basic mocha coffee. It's a very calm environment and could definitely see me coming back to try other items and just do some work there because it isn't too insane or loud, at least not when I went."}
{"text":"You know those Werther's Original hard candies that your grandpa keeps in his pocket? Okay...that's exactly what the butter beer latte tastes like. No joke, for realsies. This is the drink that evidently led flocks of people to converge and apparently was also sold out for days at a time. Maybe a brilliant marketing ploy? Law of supply and demand? Or perhaps just the latest viral like white vans and whoever Daniel is. This too, shall pass -- The lines seemed to calm down anyway, or at least in the latter part of the day when we went.

Disclosure: I've never been into Harry Potter, nor tried to be. For those that are, Bad Owl's howling your name. From an outsider's perspective who knows nothing about the wizardry, I did like the dark brick affectation and the follow-through of its motif. Refreshing to see something OTHER than the minimalist hipster, too-cool-for-school vibrations that some of these newer coffee shops tend to exude. Yay on being different.

**The gear-grinding (no pun intended): Lattes = expresso + milk. Why oh why would you name an item on your menu a \"latte\" if there's no expresso in it? You're telling me I'm paying almost $5 for a 12 oz. glorified milk and an extra dollar if I want the expresso part? Don't fool me with your wording and ask me if I want an \"extra\" shot either if there's not even a single one in the first place. Truth be told, I couldn't even taste the expresso even though I did opt for the \"extra\" shot, and I'm caffeine-sensitive, too. Boo on extortionate pricing. 

I'm not sure if this is the case for all their lattes. If so, coffee's way overpriced along with their bakery goods. You're paying for the ambiance and novelty."}
{"text":"Yummy coffee! I loved the lattes!"}
{"text":"This place is far, far away from where I live, but whenever I have the time and the energy, I make the effort to enter a teeny little piece of magic in Henderson. The iced butter brew latte is pretty good, along with the siriusly prosciutto. It's a good place to study or to relax in a magical atmosphere, so long as there aren't loud teenagers plaguing the place (I had that unfortunate experience one time, but don't let that stop you from coming at least once)."}
{"text":"Bad owl is a pretty nice coffee spot, but my fiancé and I both weren't very happy with our drinks. I ordered the sea salt iced coffee which was really strong and didn't have any hint of sea salt. He ordered the mint mojito but it's so over powering with mint it's hard to enjoy. The cafe is very well designed in the Harry Potter theme but is really dark compared to the glaring Windows and light that comes in. We also bought food which was delicious. The prices are pricy. Between us two it was about $35 for drinks and food"}
{"text":"I'm not a Harry Potter fan.  In fact, I've never read the books or seen the films.

I do love coffee though.  Bad Owl delivers fantastic aeropress brewed coffee and cold brew coffee (and espresso drinks, of course).  The staff is very friendly and the pastries are excellent.  I had the chocolate croissant twist, which was incredibly good.

This coffee place is a great addition to the Vegas Valley."}
{"text":"It's a cool place, I'm not into Harry Potter though. Really expensive here for simple stuff. Place for hipsters"}
{"text":"Great coffee. Great service. The line was out the door, but hopefully it balances out a little more as time goes on. I love the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh! I checked in too but have to comment about the theme: Harry Potter!! Just now got into the books (I know, late) but anyway LOVE it!!"}
{"text":"This place was super cute and the coffee was A+. The line was super long as their POS system needs some tweaking but other than that the service was fast after making our order. I tried the Butter Brew while my boyfriend had the Nutella Brew. Both were awesome. Maybe once the crowds die down we will make another trip!"}
{"text":"I love Harry Potter and when I heard about this place I was very excited! The set up is nice but I did not like my briscoff latte. At first it was bland and then they added more flavor to it, then became too sweet. So I highly recommend not to get that. Although I did try my nieces matcha affogato and that was delicious!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now and must say it's one of my fave spots to grab a drink and relax.

I am a huge Harry Potter fan, and I absolutely love how they pay homage to the franchise. The tables have magical sayings on them, and there's various decorations throughout the shop, such as a sorting hat and bookshelf with all the books. Right now, there's even a Christmas tree and dementors with Santa hats on them. The bathrooms also have a \"this way to the Ministry of Magic\" decals on them.

My favorite drink - well, really the only drink I've tried - is the Butterbrew Frap. I definitely need to try the rest of the things on the menu, though, because it all sounds absolutely amazing.

If you're a fan of the HP franchise, you will appreciate it here. It's the perfect spot for a first date, catching up with friends, or studying. 

I'll definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"I went here while I was waiting for a nearby company to fix my computer. This is a cozy place. I had a coffee drink called the honeysuckle. The guy who made it was able to substitute regular milk with coconut milk and it turned out deeeliiicious!!"}
{"text":"The staff is so friendly and sweet. The waffles and Nutella were delicious. I had a Hops rising by squatters beer bomb. My girlfriend had a jasmine blueberry tea also delicious I tried. Will most definitely be coming back. I love that it's Harry Potter inspired"}
{"text":"Labor Day and hubby been home with our baby the entire day so he wanted to get out.  I suggested we check out Bad Owl.   All three of us enjoyed it!

Infant daughter - She was soaking in her surrounding and was a good girl.  It was spacious here so we got the corner to ourselves.

Me - I got the iced coffee with sea salt cream.  I loved it.  The sea salt cream brought out the aromatic of the coffee.  Was the perfect amount of cream to coffee.  I was wired.

Hubby - Got the nitrogen cold brew and was served in a fancy stem glass.  This is meant to enjoy there.

I do wish the selection of pastries is wider than what was available.  Anywho, I would go to Bad Owl any day over DD and SB."}
{"text":"Coffee was just ok.  Nothing to write about.  Pleasant workers.  I'm not running back so fast."}
{"text":"I've been here several times to pick up stuff.  One time I picked up this Nitro coffee drink.  It looked so good!  That I just had to try it.  I'm not a big fan of spending $5-8 on just coffee.  I couldn't remember the name of what I wanted, so I explained it to the girl that was at the counter.  (She's good at her job) She knew what I was talking about.  So I ordered it.   It came, I think it was only 12 oz.  But it looked just like what I wanted.  My I took my first sip........Then my second sip......I had to add sugar!  And honestly it wasn't worth $5.00 it was ok, I was disappointed.  And I went to another place in the area, just to get a regular coffee!  No I wasn't going to go back there just for a regular coffee.  But there is something else on the menu I want to try.  So I will be back......No it's not coffee!"}
{"text":"This was a big risk--to use a theme that is so beloved. But after our second time here, I think they nailed it. The decor is cool for the fans, and the coffee is actually so good. I was worried that it would be all about the gimmick and not as much about the coffee. I had a nitro the first time and a mocha this time. Both were excellent. Hubby got the V60 both times and said it was perfect each time. The biggest surprise was the food. I got the Siriusly Prociutto (AH-maxing) and Hubby got the Wizard. The location isn't convenient for us, but we'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Love the ambience and decor of the place...great place to chill with good friends. The coffee itself was ok,I ordered the butter beer. This place gets 4 stars because of it's unique theme."}
{"text":"Coffee is great, service is hit and miss. Standing in line because the cashier is chatting about the weekend with the lady in front of me for 7 minutes was a bit much. The coffee and snacks are excellent, they need to up there service game."}
{"text":"Harry Potter? Never heard of him, sounds like a cool dude though.

I do not have the fandom that others might from reading the J.K Rowling books but I can say with certainty that this is a pretty cool place to grab a cup of coffee.

I think the best part of walking into this place looking for my iv of caffeine was how kind the baristas were. You know how people are before they get their drip so being overly peppy would have been over kill, but the people behind the counter are just the right amount of friendly and happy. 

I could tell from looking around watching other people snap pictures that this little spot was Yelp worthy. 

We ordered a cup of coffee, a hot tea and a couple pastries and everything was tasty and tasted fresh. I would suggest coming here during the week as opposed to the weekends where the line can be out the door."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times to grab some coffee and a quick bite. For a coffee place, their food is delicious every time. I needed to leave a review today because not only are their drinks strong and well balanced, their service is even better. I ordered avocado toast (the perfect amount of avocado, balsamic, and gorgeous over easy eggs) and it took the girl a bit longer than normally to prep it. She came out with a free float for me, in addition to my drink and apologizing profusely. She even gave me a coupon for next time! That speaks a lot to customer service, because to be honest I wasn't even upset in the first place but she still went out of her way to make sure I was happy!"}
{"text":"As a mild Harry Potter fan I found this place enjoyable. I enjoyed the subtle references but liked how it wasn't over the top. They also have a LOT of coffee drinks so there's definitely lots to choose from. I actually really enjoyed their nitro with sea salt cream. 

This place isn't cheap, but the service is top notch. When I ordered a drink and didn't like it, they let me switch it out for another one for no problem. The staff is really friendly and the service is really quick. 

I'd definitely recommend this place for Harry Potter fans, and recommend it for coffee aficionados as well. If you're neither of those, you may be underwhelmed."}
{"text":"The Harry Potter theme is wonderful! The coffee...not so much. After waiting in a long line, I asked what beans they had available for V60. The clerk told me that they weren't doing pour-over at that time, which is baffling to me. I settle for an Americano and a cold brew. The former was mediocre -- only slightly better than what you'd get at a Coffee Bean or a Starbucks. The cold brew was good. Still, I greatly prefer a cup of fresh pour-over and was disappointed they weren't doing any, despite V60 being on the menu. Unless a big Harry Potter fan is visiting from out of town, I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Went here 2 times. On the first day during the Soft Open around 9AM and at night after 7PM. For my second visit I initially came in the morning around 9 on President's Day. A mistake on my part as the line already reached the door and I had just bought cheese at the store that I wasn't willing to let melt for a latte. Since I don't live across town, it wasn't an issue to drive back. After looking at pictures of the line on Yelp, I realize now I avoided the worst of it.

Had an Iced Lavender Latte on both visits. The Lavender is strong, a stark contrast to the one I had at Sambalatte where I squinted my eyes wondering if there was even any Lavender in it at all. I remember telling the guy who works there I liked their syrup and appreciated how flavorful it was. 

Even though I sometimes get coffee in the morning, I consistently get it at night which is why I haven't back since they posted on their social media they were closed at 5 (I tend to go after 7 because of dinner). I remember they initially advertised that they would be open til 10, but I haven't seen any post indicating they were changing their hours to be longer. 

I hope they consider adding a 20/24 oz size because while 16oz is fine, I like to get my money's worth when I'm already putting $5 towards a drink after tax. Hope to also see the hours change back. I don't care if they close at 10, but even 7 or 8 would be great."}
{"text":"This is my favorite coffee shop on the planet! Best baristas, best food, and it's a bonus that it is Harry Potter themed! I think the owner must be my long lost soul sister or brother. 

Follow the spiders!"}
{"text":"Coming here, there was so much hype because of it being Harry Potter themed. I ordered a lavender latte and no bit of lavender taste at all. The overall atmosphere of this coffee shop was lame. Nothing to spectacular. You could see behind the wallpaper. It didn't seem like it was put together very well. If I were to ever come back I would just order a regular coffee. To pay top dollar for a speciality coffee that isn't really special is a waste! Out of all the coffee shops in Las Vegas, this one is not on my list for recommendations. 

The staff was nice and they got the order out in a quick fashion. Just not impressed by this place at all. If they made the speciality coffee more flavorful that could make a difference. They really tried to make the place look as authentic as possible... to the point where it wasn't at all. 

Overall bummed about this place."}
{"text":"This place is adorable. The baristas are friendly, it wasn't too crowded, and I loved the Harry Potter decor! I had the mint mojito (which I don't think I'll have again: too sweet) but it was well made. The prices weren't too ridikkulus but they were a bit high."}
{"text":"It was nice, but for a themed coffee house, you could barely find any hints of a theme. I just felt I was in another generic coffee house"}
{"text":"Staff is super friendly.
Had a chocolate croissant and almond croissant which were both soft and delicious. Ordered lavender lattes no espresso.
The drinks were really flavorful, and you can really taste  and smell the lavender!

As far as decoration goes, bare walls with very little decor, no Harry Potter ambience quite yet; just a good coffee shop with good stuff."}
{"text":"Love this place!!!!  A wonderful variety of themed drinks and food.  I don't know what more to say than I was impressed from beginning to end.  I am very critical of cleanliness because I am a nurse and the Bad Owl definitely passed the test."}
{"text":"Love this place! Their iced coffee drinks are quality. I usually get the Iced White Mocha Lavender Latte- highly recommend."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place but was disappointed. The wait was not worth it at all. 2 drinks and a croissant for $20!! Way overpriced."}
{"text":"As a huge Harry Potter fan, I was super excited to check this place out ... and was majorly disappointed. The HP decor seemed minimal (in a nutshell, dementor, owl and signposts) and the butter brew iced latte I got was more ice than anything else (and nothing compared to the frozen or non-frozen butterbeer at Universal Studios). Didn't try the food or other drinks so can't comment on them. However, if you're coming here for HP, be prepared for minimal Potterverse."}
{"text":"I had been wanting to try Bad Owl Coffee ever since I heard there was a Harry Potter themed cafe in Vegas. My friend and I stopped by in the evening to get a drink and had a great time at this establishment. When you walk in, everything is Harry Potter-themed... from the signs to the artwork to the quotes painted on the tables, the beauty of this place is in the details. The barista was very friendly and helped me order the best drink for my tastes. I ordered a butterbeer latte, which I was told is their most popular drink, and I totally see why. It was sweet, but not too sweet, and had just the right amount of butterscotch. It also had a beautiful floral design on top and somehow they incorporated pink dye? I'm not even sure how this happened, but I was very impressed. The only thing I didn't love about this place (and I'm nit picking here) was the music, but it was not enough to deter me at all. I will certainly come back here next time I'm in Vegas!"}
{"text":"This place is my go to coffee  shop.  Typically when I go to a new area I like to try all the independent coffee shops and I usually don't go back to them unless they make a huge impression and during my 2 week stay in the Las Vegas area I have been here a whopping 4x. 

What initially drew me to this place is that it's Harry Potter themed. I absolutely love Harry Potter and I love how it's not over the top in decorations. It's subtle and only real fans really recognize the references.  The Baristas are very nice and helpful when I asked them questions about the menu and I gotta say my 2 favorite drinks are the butterbrew latte (does not come with espresso so make sure to ask for a shot) and their mango pop (which is like mango soda with ice cream- think root beer float) the food is also amazing I got the avocado toast for breakfast and it was very flavorful and filling. 


This has become a staple for me when I visit the Henderson area!"}
{"text":"This place is warm and friendly with a great atmosphere.  The coffee and food are good, maybe just a little short in selection, but it seems they are expanding their options. A favorite olace of mine to sit and sip on a hot tea while people watching."}
{"text":"My wife was told about this place from a friend, so we decided to try it out on Saturday 2/20. Arrived about 830am and it was packed, i stood in line for roughly a hour, which if it was just a normal coffee shop, i would have never done. But there was something about this place that drove me to want to wait in line to get a cup of coffee. 
Not sure if it was the theme of the place or the fact that they were so busy, and the fact that everyone was in a great mood even though the steady stream of people was never ending.
Anyways, they have a great selection of coffees for a very reasonable price, the pastries are fabulous again the prices are well below what i was expecting.
There was a total of 3 people in my party, we all got a large flavored coffees, (unfortunately they were out of the Butter Beer Latte) and a pastry, with 20% tip out there door it was $39, which was very reasonable in my mind.
The establishment was very cozy for the amount of people waiting to be served as well as people that have been served. As long as they keep up the great customer service, keep the prices reasonable, i can see this place really taking off, because really who doesn't love anything to do with \"Harry Potter\"?
What would make it even better is if they were playing the HP soundtracks instead of music, they should also, throw some TV's on the open walls and play on a constant loop all the different Harry Potter movies.
We will definitely be going back, Gotta try that Butter Beer Latte!"}
{"text":"The coffee was really good. What surprised me is how good the breakfast waffle was. This was a pleasant surprise on this trip through town. I think we will return tomorrow morning before we leave."}
{"text":"Had the butter brew latte, very good and not overly sweet. Enjoyed the atmosphere and the baristas were very wonderful helping me decide on a drink."}
{"text":"We have been waiting for years to come to this coffee shop, the last time I came was when it first opened and the line was out the door. This time, it has been open for awhile so we were able to get in for lunch and get a table. I ordered an iced butterbrew latte with espresso added and my husband ordered an iced coconut white mocha. For food, we ordered the avocado toast and the siriusly prosciutto sandwich which had fig butter and goat cheese! I love that combo of flavors!. Food was delicious and so was the coffee, my husband's was a little too sweet, but it was still good, and of course decor in the shop was great. We love Harry potter and coffee and it was cool to see the 2 themes blended so well and have amazing food and drinks at the same time. We will be back next time we are in vegas."}
{"text":"I'm in love!! Now today was the grand opening so it was a little swamped but the coffee was amazing ;-) The decor was perfectly suited...just nerdy enough without being over the top!"}
{"text":"It just keeps getting better. New sandwich offerings and the one I had (pesto) was fabulous. 
A consistently inviting vibe and another beautiful latte are making Bad Owl a stand out shop."}
{"text":"Didn't even know what this place was called, just knew I wanted to go when it was described as a Harry Potter Cafe.

Located in a bustling shopping center, this cool little coffee shop serves up a mean cup of caffeine while giving the inner geek in you something to gawk at while you're waiting for your drink. It's not over the top with decorations, but they things they do have are pretty clever: flying mail above, dementors propped up near the ceiling (not sure if it was because it was Halloween or if they have these year round), and even a little Platform 9 photo op.

Aside from the cool decor, the coffee itself was really good and the staff were really friendly. My only gripe was that when we ordered some drinks to go, they put the cold lids made for whipped cream on top, and those aren't the best from preventing spillage while you're driving!

Lots of tables inside and free wi-fi if you're trying to get some work/studying done. I'd definitely recommend to check out and you're in the area!"}
{"text":"Had Matcha Lattes! !!!!! Even though I am not into Harry Potter I did get the theme and they did a great job. Wish they had more outside seating though."}
{"text":"If you're a Harry Potter fan, you will find this cafe super adorable. My friend wanted to drop by, so we made the slight detour on our way out of Vegas back to LA. Worth it! Just the decor alone was delightful.

Super chill and quiet spot, great for studying, catching up with a friend, or potential first (nondate) date spot. 

Bonus: they also serve wine and beer.

Did not have any of the food, but they looked like they had a nice menu of eats. Just had a plain iced coffee, and I liked it. 

Would I come again? Sure!"}
{"text":"Nice quite spot with a fun environment and great coffee/sandwiches. Tried the pesto and was definitely impressed."}
{"text":"Today...
Philthy reviews.....the Henderson Version of the Philz Coffee Mint Mojito Mocha....

Mint mojito latte....ever since I bought my first one in Cupertino, I've been addicted.  Bad Owl's version was a good rendition.  While Philz has a delectable sweet creaminess to it that was somewhat lacking in this version, its minty taste was noticeably present in every sip.  I did enjoy this and do try to make an appearance when I'm in town."}
{"text":"Very friendly and helpful staff.  I had the blended Nutella and a peaches and cream muffin (warmed up) .. omg! Both amazing!  Highly recommend this fun Harry Potter themed coffee place!"}
{"text":"A cool cave like coffee shop that reminds me of Harry Potter. Amazing macaroons. Good selection, fun colors, a variety of flavors and they're all amazing!"}
{"text":"Had a really good experience here, which is impressive given it's like their first week. Decoration is impeccable, Butterbrew coffee is delicious. The place was busy but not crazy. The pastries looked good AND HUGE but I didn't see any Potter themed foodstuffs, they mightve sold them all. I would've bough them all myself.

They also seem to take their coffee very seriously, I saw brew selections I haven't seen since Seattle here, but many choices were sold out, probably because this place has more business than any infant coffee shop could expect."}
{"text":"This was second visit. First visit got order wrong and made nonfat drink with Nutella. Second visit line to door so waited 20 min to find only have whole milk. Seems ridiculous on Sunday morning.  There is a grocery store in the same parking lot."}
{"text":"Biscof latte = cookie butter latte, delicious, by far the best drink I've had here and I have had some good ones.. I'm not sure where they get their baked goods but the chocolate croissant  was  great although it would have been better warmed up which I didn't ask for but probably could have.. great atmosphere with it's big nod to harry potter & super friendly &  helpful staff

Had to edit and take away one star.. I understand it's not that common but I'm sure they occasionally get guests with a baby.. have they not though about installing some changing tables in the bathrooms?"}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE! 
Friendly atmosphere, best theme on earth, amazing food, bomb drinks. 
It's really great cause they can customize stuff here, aka vegan friendly (:"}
{"text":"As a Harry Potter fan I was very excited to come here. I was even more excited that my coffee was delicious and the food was superb. Excellent coffee shop. The Harry Potter decorations were tasteful and not over the top. Extra points for having a TARDIS! Looking forward to the new one opening on Rainbow."}
{"text":"There has been a lot of talk about this place on Facebook mainly because it's famous for the Harry Potter theme for the coffee shop. I dig the whole attraction. The setting is comfortable like Starbucks. There's lounge chairs, stools and tables for dine-ins. Even if it's just for studying or work to conversations. 

As I walked in, I expected a long line of customers flowing in because of the hype and talking going around about this place. Advertisement through word of mouth and media sites spread fast. I ordered my items through a menu that was posted on a clipboard which was near and creative. They have fresh pastries and snacks out on display and updated coffee machinery along with an updated ordering system. You can tell this place was Hip. 

People say they don't like the coffee too much but only go for the experience. They either say it's too bland or too sweet. But I personally love it. I'm a heavy coffee drinker and I love mines sweet. They do make they're coffee strong, so that's better when it comes to drinkers like me. You can actually tell them how u want your coffee, so it's really up to u on how ur coffee is made done right. If it's bland, that's you have options to put in your own cream and sugar that they provide on the counter after they serve it to you at the pick up end. 

Location is close to my house so it's a nice spot for me to go and pick up a cup of coffee on the way to school or study there when I have time."}
{"text":"Super fun coffee house, took my friend from out of town who is a huge Harry potter fan and she loved it.  Service was great and everyone loved their drinks.  The decor was very well done and was a cool spot to hang out."}
{"text":"Stopped by on their grand opening. They added a few additional Harry Potter decorations! And the butter beer latte is yummy! You have the option of having it with the espresso shot or not. It's not too sweet but personally I would probably add an extra shot next time."}
{"text":"Cool place. Had the nitrogen coffee...sooooooo goooooooood. Can't wait to have it again. Only complaint is really long lines and wait."}
{"text":"The coffee is good, I'll give it that. I could care less about Harry Potter though so I can't commit on that. I do like the quotes on the tables. The employees are very friendly but the prices are out of control. $6.80 for a large coconut milk latte? Really?"}
{"text":"Well,well,well what can I say. It's been a cold,rainy day so a tea sounded just right. To our disappointment all their tea pots (which we really liked) supposedly broke so we got our tea in a standard paper cup. How can all teapots be broken??? At least the flavor of the tea was good.
The first time we went there it was 25% off all pastries. Well today that only applied for breaded pastries. It doesn't make sense does it? $12 for a cup of tea and a little piece of cake sounds a bit much."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I LOVE this place. Best coffee we've ever had and I love the chicken caesar wrap. I really love the latte art they put on my lattes too. I'm a huge Harry Potter fan and this place feels so magical. Love looking at all the cool decorations and at Christmas time they even put Santa hats on the dementors, haha so cute. This coffee house is amazing and just makes me so happy. \"Espresso Patronum!\""}
{"text":"Their iced matcha latte is freakin' bomb!! I had it with a shot of espresso! The vibe of the place is also pretty chill which is why i love going here. I also like their spanish latte! They also have nitrobrew! if you're a coffee addict, you should definitely try out this place."}
{"text":"This cafe is awesome! Being a Harry Potter fan I love the theme and how well they decorated the place! I got a matcha latte and acai toast. Both were yummy and not too sweet. They have a good variety of food, pastries, drinks/coffees available on their menu. I will definitely be coming back here again and maybe a few more times!"}
{"text":"I had been meaning to try this place but it's 45 minutes from my part of town. We were running errands nearby and it was time to break for lunch! The shop was clean and cute. We ordered Americanos and 3 of their lunch choices plus a waffle entree. The food wasn't fast but we enjoyed a card game and barely noticed. The food was good and quality worthy of the price tag. For $10 you get a well made sandwich on a gourmet bread. We ended our visit with butterbeers to go. Wow they were really tasty! Different from the frozen ones at Harry Potter but really close! I was offered a shot of espresso in mine, go for it! I'm glad we stopped by to see it."}
{"text":"Sticky bun was hard as rock. It was still hard to eat even after being microwaved. Microwave was not even offered at ordering though. They don't seem to care once they got my money. Wished their customer care was as good as the interior design."}
{"text":"Ok, I went back a second time a few days ago.  This time to try the Lavender Latte.  It was good but the Blueberry muffin - I'm not sure if I'm more impressed or offended!  I've been told I make the best & this one could pass a blindfold taste test!  Have one, you'll understand.

Then today a friend of mine came into work with a 12 oz Kyoto cold brew & let me try it.   He poured about an ounce into a cup for me.  The first sip was brutal and caught me off guard.   I have never had anything like this.  It had an edge to it, almost like a sip of alcohol but once you get past that there's a potency & depth there that makes you want more.   I went back for another sip & it had the same kick.  I think rather than say I like it I can honestly say I respect it. This is a coffee to sip not a latte to chug.  After just that little bit I was wide awake & clear headed.  An acquired taste perhaps?  Medicinal coffee?  I'm not sure but dear Owl could you consider selling this in a 4 oz. size?  I could never finish a 12 oz and would be wracked with guilt if I ever threw any of it away!"}
{"text":"Great coffee and pastries.  Way to expensive  and the location  is a bit difficult when heading to work.  Service is great."}
{"text":"I went here because I heard the whole cafe is Harry Potter themed and hoped to see my childhood come to life. I was very impressed by the decor at the cafe, they really put hard work into putting potter references everywhere. The actual coffee however is kinda meh, and I wish they served actual Butterbeer flavored drinks."}
{"text":"I'm new to the area and was looking for a good place to get some coffee and do some reading. The staff is very friendly. The ice coffee I got woke me good! Good tables and lounge chairs to sit in. Free wifi"}
{"text":"This place is brilliant! I took my little sister here and we told them our name was \"Remus\" and \"Lily\" and that we were best friends. It was the best little mini-fictional vacation. The people working were pretty nice, and they helped pick out a great drink for both of us"}
{"text":"Wow...I've been wanting to take a step into the wizarding world for a few months now and I finally made it!!! This place offers a glimpse into where Harry Potter shacks up for the night to study about dark potions and their effects on muggles. When he doesn't possess a spell to keep himself awake a Butter Brew latte is exactly what the Professor ordered!!  Top it off with a Belgian Butter Brew cream waffle and you too can feel the effects of a coffee inspired patronus!!! Thanks guys I'll be back!!! I recommend wizard wands for coffee stirrers!!!"}
{"text":"We were so excited to see this new coffee shop open up. Imagine our disappointment when we drive all the way from North Las Vegas to find the place CLOSED. We were meeting friends who drove from the southwest part of the valley. A bit of advice...if you are supposed to be open certain hours, do so. Being on television is no excuse from a business standpoint. If the owners have to be away, have an employee in charge who can keep the place open or have the television folks come to you. Given the distance, I doubt any of us will be back."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great atmosphere, coffee and free wifi. I'll take this place over Starbucks any day!"}
{"text":"Came in 10 minutes after 7 am and they had nothing to eat because their baker wasn't in yet. . Asked for whipped cream on my drink but they were in too much of a hurry from just opening the store to remember. 
The coffee was really good.. but I had to stop at an alternate coffee shop to grab breakfast before work. It would've been better if they were prepared to open at 7."}
{"text":"Only thing better than the coffee is the atmosphere. Harry Potter themed where you can also get local brewery beer, wine, and food. Happy hour 3-6, half off alcohol."}
{"text":"Best Coffee Shop in Henderson/Las Vegas!

I have been to tons of coffee shops locally and they are all basically the same, with the exception of Bad Owl.  First their egg sandwich is actually made onsite. Unlike StarB's where everything is pre-packaged or so many others where they microwave the egg.  Bag Owl actually cooks the egg.  Probably the best egg sandwich I have ever had outside of my own home.  Next the drinks my friend had a latte and I had the chai tea both were amazing.  The chai tea at StarB's is tasteless unless you add a flavor to it  The Bad Owl's chai actually has a cinnamon flavoring that was subtle and enjoyable to drink.  The customer service rocks! The two young ladies behind the counter were friendly and spot on with their service. I live 17 minutes away from the Bad Owl but am willing to drive for great customer service, tasty chai and an amazing egg sandwich!"}
{"text":"my most very favorite place for coffee! its amazing! the waffles are fantastic and the atmosphere is so cool! i drive from north las vegas for their butter brew coffee! such a cool place"}
{"text":"I'm a huge Harry Potter fan so of course I like Bad Owl. The coffee is definitely better than most places. I try to stop in anytime I'm on that part of town"}
{"text":"Extremely friendly staff. Great Apple Peach tea. Better than Starbucks and DD combined. Nice atmosphere. You don't have to be a HP nut to enjoy the decor and ambiance. It's been a long time since finding a coffee shop I enjoy. Will definitely be a frequenter."}
{"text":"This Mrs. is a huge HP fan so we had to check it out while we were in town. Definitely a cool place. The drinks were great as was the service as well.

We dig the Tardis on the wall.

We cant wait to come back and try it again."}
{"text":"After hearing everyone and their dog rave about this new Harry Potter themed coffee shop, I decided to join the bandwagon. I love the concept but it's over hyped in my opinion. 

I came here on a Sunday morning and was greeted by a long line. Didn't mind the 20min wait because it gave me some time to look around the shop. I'm not a Harry Potter fan but I can see how some die-hard Harry Potter fans would go crazy over a shop like this. 

Service was alright. Line to order was moving slow but once you order, drinks comes out fast. Open kitchen so you get to watch them make your drink which I liked. 

Like I said, I am not a Harry Potter fan so what stood out to me the most wasn't the Harry Potter decor around the shop, but their Kyoto cold brew coffee system on the right side of register. It makes their kitchen area look like a chemistry laboratory. There is a big chunk of ice at the top but as the time passes by and ice melts, ice water drips down the glass pipe and filters through coffee and finally makes a cold brew coffee. Too dope!

I decided to get the lavender white mocha iced. Coffee wasn't too strong but it had a strong lavender, floral taste to it which I didn't quite enjoy. Personally, I feel their lavender white mocha is an acquired taste.  I also got to try sea salt nitro brew which I believe is made with nitrogen and has a velvety consistency. Too strong for me and I didn't like it too much. I'm not much of a coffee drinker so some may like this. Just a side note that sea salt nitro brew only comes in one size. 

It's one of those first and last visit. I wouldn't come back again."}
{"text":"Over priced and Overrated.  My wife is a big Harry Potter fan and wanted to go here.  For three meals and three drinks, I paid over $45.  The food was delicious, but considering that we basically got two waffles and a sandwich; that's just too much money.  The signature drinks, were underwhelming to say the least.  There was a small list of signature lattes and two signature drinks... that's it.  I would have expected everything to be Harry Potter inspired, but it wasn't.  Finally, the decor was ok, but I really think they missed the mark.  This could have been a whole experience, like instead of walking through the front door, you could walk through a phone booth or fireplace as you're \"transported\" into the cafe.  The coffee bar could have been made up like the \"burrow;\" cobbled together cabinets and such.  The tables kind of ramshackle like you'd find in the Hogshead.  Instead, half of the decorations looked like recycled Halloween decorations.

Pros: Food was Great
Cons: The signature drinks, lack of inspiration to include the food and decor, and the price."}
{"text":"Definitely came simply for the fact of the Harry Potter theme, but loved the coffee and servers! The two girls working were so sweet and funny, making our time enjoyable. My coffee was great. I got the Nutella latte hot and it was creamy and smooth! Loved it! It's far from me, but whenever I'm around I will definitely be back =)"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! For Harry Potter lovers and muggles alike there is something for everyone. The teas are hand-stuffed in cute little tea purses and the coffee flavors are equally unique and delicious. The space is comfortable and inviting and will certainly bring back all your favorite HP memories through its creative and relevant decor. Come experience the magic for yourself! (Ps. No wand needed)"}
{"text":"I try my best to write non-biased reviews but this is going to be hard. I pretty much think anything with Harry Potter is AWESOME!!

I visited here with my boyfriend yesterday, 3/13/16, around noon. The line, as expected, was out the door. The tables were also packed. The wait to place an order took a long time, around 15-20 min. It didn't seem so bad though since we made friends in line who ended up buying our drinks. I guess HP fans are just cool like that :)

Once we placed our orders, which were one hot butter brew and once iced butter brew (both with espresso), we only had to wait a few minutes for our drinks to be ready. The iced butter brew was mine. It had good flavor but I thought it was too sweet and only drank a few sips of it. However, I'm one of those people that dislikes the butterbeer served at the Wizarding World of HP at Universal Studios so don't let this review deter you from trying the butter brew if A. you're a Harry Potter fan and/or B. you like sweets. I will suggest getting it hot though because it was REALLY good like that! Like really good. I kept stealing sips from my boyfriend's cup.

The decor was cool and of course I'm a fangirl so I really appreciated it. I would really love it if this place were bigger though. You really can't enjoy the space because it's too small and currently too popular.

You've got to try this place out if you're a Harry Potter fan or even if you're not, just for the delicious hot butter brew. I give Bad Owl four stars for this yummy drink, the novelty of the theme, and the friendly staff. It's far from me so I don't see myself going back unless I'm in the area. I'll travel far for food, but no so much for coffee, even if Harry Potter is involved. If I am in the area, however, I'd stop in to try something else on their extensive and interesting menu."}
{"text":"I found my new coffee spot! Moving from La to Vegas wasn't that bad at all! The first thing I did was to look for a nice go to coffee shop and tada!!!! Credits to yelp ha. :) This place is really really close to where I live, to a hospital and to a lot of restaurants so that's a plus. Also, if you love Harry Potter then you MUST go here! It's cozy inside. Such a nice place to study,organize your planner,read and/or whatever it is you need to work on, you can do it here! First time I came here I was greeted by two friendly baristas and decided to get the BUTTER BEER LATTE and CHICKEN PESTO SANDWICH. Food and drink were both bomb although the Coffee didnt make me feel buzzed lol jk! I had the lavender latte and mint mojito the following days. For the mint mojito, they put fresh ground mint with whatever amount of espresso you want so you could really taste that minty flavor. However, I think my fave is the lavender latte. Well because you know you gotta have one fave drink right lol ;) P.S if you check in, you get 20% off your entire bill :) uhhhmmm yes of course I recommend this place and Im actually going back tomorrow for my morning coffee hehe!"}
{"text":"Still continue to be amazed here and with magic and caffeine too! I needed coffee since I was dragging this afternoon and remembered that this fantastic coffee house was over here.  Now tiredness gone I am ready to continue the rest of the day. I love this coffee place. It is so quaint and welcoming. It is such a great place to come and caught up on work which is what I'm doing. I ordered a Spanish Latte and now can salsa the rest of the afternoon away."}
{"text":"Way too expensive. You are paying for the atmosphere. It's not a casual hang out. Too dark. Starbucks is opening up in the same center. That may put them out of business. When u are more expensive for a cup of coffee then Starbucks.......and the coffee is not that great. Not horrible, but not great for what you pay."}
{"text":"I've been hearing the buzz about this place for a few weeks now. A new local coffee shop that is Harry Potter themed.

Yes you read that right Muggle.

Being the Die Hard Potter fan that I am I have been dying to go.

Yelp says they close at 5:00PM but we got there at 5:30ish and there was a line out the door. No literally there were people patiently waiting for their turn inside wrapped around this small store front.

Now I understand that this place is new and everyone is super excited so I did expect a bit of a crowd. I did not expect to wait in a line outside the store for thirty minutes. 

I didn't like that they didn't have real menus posted just some dirty papers that everyone's hands had been all over. 

They only had one \"semi-Harry Potter\" themed drink and that was a Butter Brew latte and of course they were out.

I think it's a cute enough idea and as much as I really want to support local business and as much as I love anything Harry Potter if I'm being honest with myself I probably will not be back.

For $5.50 I can get a drink I truly love made super quick at Starbucks. I hate to say that but it's true."}
{"text":"100% blown away by my experience at Bad Owl. Not only was the decor awesome but it might have been the best coffee I have had since I can remember. I ordered the Nitro Brew with Sea Salt cream and it was absolutely incredible. You don't necessarily have to be a Potter Fan to enjoy this place, People were coming in and saying to the employees taking their order \"I don't know anything about Harry Potter but I heard you have the best coffee in town. 

Absolutely recommend this to anyone!"}
{"text":"Went to the Bad Owl Coffee for the first. I told the girl, Amber at the counter that it was my first time coming in. She was very helpful and sweet. I ordered the Nutella latte and it was the prefect temp and not super sweet made by John. It was prefect. My friend order the Padfoot's pumpkin waffles and when it came out it had nuts on it. Which he is allergic to. Alex instantly made him a new plate without nuts. I would recommend this place to anyone in the area. I will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Killer service.  Not pretentious, I got the sea salt nitro.  Killer!!!   It was slammed on Sunday so I didn't stand in the 20 person line.  But mid Monday morning was perfect.  The vibe is hipster Harry Potter if you can imagine that.  Cool Harry Potter elements mixed with lots of industrial / Edison style lamps.  I will be back next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"The coffee is really great, the theme is fun but not over the top and the wifi is great.  They also serve really good pastries (especially the almond croissant).  My only complaint is that the music is WAY too loud and it makes it hard to have a conversation or get work done."}
{"text":"So I came here after a meeting to get some school work done and was super excited because, duh, it's Harry Potter themed! If there's a place to feel remotely like a (ravenclaw) HP student, it's here right? 

As soon as I walked in, I was greeted by the nice baristas and warm scent of brewing coffee. The walls and tables were decorated with HP quotes and spells and kind of reminded me of Potions class with the overall dark color scheme. However, I immediately noticed the Doctor Who phone box on the right corner of the shop. I am a huge Whovian so I definitely appreciated it, but it was awkwardly placed and kind of random?! 

As for the coffee, I of course tried the famous butter beer latte. I mean you can't go wrong with their signature drink? Wrong. It literally tasted like hot milk with caramel drizzling and a HINT of coffee.

Overall, if you're going for the ambiance and nostalgia of HP, it's worth a visit - just make sure to greet the DW phone box on your way out lol. As for the coffee, it's a bit underwhelming and you'd be better off elsewhere."}
{"text":"I have no idea what to say, they said they were open. So I drove all the way across town only to find a note on the door saying they won't be there until 2pm. Let's get this straight, you open a new business, and you go and do something else without having a staff there to take care of customers while you do this news thing. I find it inconvenient and unprofessional in a way. I could see that a good business practice is to keep to your schedule, have a staff to handle your regular business hours, and do these special events with other staff. It's not cool! 

Now, if I get to come back this way, all the way across town, we will see what this is like. But for now, I think it was a very unprofessional move on your part. Be better equipped to serve the public during and always during the hours you say you are open. I wasted my time to visit your shop, and you can't have the decency to be open as your hours clearly state online, that's the bit that sucks and you probably don't care enough to see my point. But, I'm not the only person who drove in and was in the parking lot, waking up you our doors to see the same note. We all should have walked up to experience the hype of your shop with a staff there, not closed."}
{"text":"It was cool little place. The only thing preventing my return is the fact that I'm never on that side of town. 

So the menu has soooo many choices, and my wallet wouldn't allow me to spend 6 bucks on iced coffee. So, I opted for the most talked about thing on the menu which was the Butter beer latte. I don't usually do the whole sweet coffee thing, but i was definitely happy with my choice. i feel as though the taste was spot on.. \"a little bit like less-sickly butterscotch\" JK would be proud. For being at the mercy of copyrights, I think they did an ok job of bringing the magic to life.

I've traveled for coffee before, I wouldn't put this place on that list.If i could find a reason to drive back out there believe me i'd give this place 4 stars. Maybe Firewhisky????"}
{"text":"When I'm in Henderson, I always have to stop by. There drinks are phenomenal and so is there sandwiches!"}
{"text":"Cute little cafe based off harry potter. I got the iced lavender white mocha. Very good, I also got a avocado toast. Delicious! There is a few more coffee flavors I want to try, so definitely will be going back."}
{"text":"Sea Salt Iced Coffee was a great choice! Loved the balance.of salty, creamy and sweet. Great ambiance and friendly staff. Line can get long as the staff takes the time to go through the menu and answer any questions you might have."}
{"text":"Service, presentation, taste, EVERYTHING was amazing!  I had the avocado toast and it was delicious, cheers!"}
{"text":"There was a very long wait when my husband and I went on a Monday afternoon at 4. There were no seats available and there wasn't even a menu posted up for you to see. It was being passed around on a clipboard. 

Being a die hard HP fan, I wanted to check this place out badly. I was highly disappointed. There were maybe 7-10 things of HP in there. They just threw the decorations and said they were a HP themed coffee shop. Needless to say, I have bigger plans for a HP themed nursery room for my unborn baby. 

However, their coffee was delicious! I love coffee shops like this that truly have good wholesome coffee and they have nailed that!"}
{"text":"Stopped by twice since it opened to see a line literally to the door---I like a cup of joe as much as the next, but waiting in line for 20 minutes, the line barely moving, we left.  Need to hire a wizard to get that line magically moving... Why can't 3-4 baristas make 20 drinks in less than an hour? Well, being total Harry Potter fans, my daughter and I stopped by yesterday and saw there was only a couple people in line. Totally geeking out over the cute Harry Potter themed tables, we ordered an iced lavender latte and butter beer latte. The lavender latte was floral and sweet, but a little too much for me. The butter beer latte was heavily sweet, thick and like a decadent dessert. Tasty, but a whole one might be too much for me. 
The decor is not too gimmicky as I thought it might be, I was happily surprised, superbly executed with wizardly flair."}
{"text":"I try and go here every time I'm in the vegas area, I wish we had one in socal because I miss it so much! cute harry potter decor, very helpful employees, amazing food, and there's something for everyone when it comes to the drinks. so good!!"}
{"text":"Yuzo and Bailey are awesome and so is their team, especially the barista Alex. I love the Lavender latte and I adore the fact they value quality ingredients to make a superb product, especially if it involves heavy cream ;) I am excited to continue supporting a local store, and can't wait to see what's to come!"}
{"text":"This place has a cute atmosphere and delicious coffee. I'm used to always getting espresso and almond milk but the roasted almond latte is soo good I can't resist! Free parking and lots of places to sit. Also a very friendly staff so that's a plus!"}
{"text":"Best tasting blended Matcha Latte I've ever had! Not too sweet, just right. The Nitrogen coffee was unreal, first experience with this style of coffee and definitely impressed. Very creamy and smooth. The Almond Toast was delicious too! Staff were extremely friendly and pleasant! The menu is different and has something for everyone. The cafe environment is cool and inviting."}
{"text":"I freaking love this place! I love Harry Potter I love the people who work here, I love the coziness, it's just amazing. 
The salon I work out love to have morning meetings before work here and they welcome us with open arms every time. 
The food is to die for. The drinks are amazing. I freaking love their chai. Their avocado everything is perfection. 
Anyways. Don't question yourself. Just do it, go to bad owl. Haha"}
{"text":"Honestly the coffee and food were really good quality and delicious! I ordered an Americano and the Nutella waffles, and holy crap they were delicious. It was also a great vibe which is important to me in coffee shops, being able  to sit leisurely  with friends, or study.  The reason I'd say 4 instead of 5 is because if you are coming here for as a die hard Harry Potter fan to experience the theme, it's a bit underwhelming."}
{"text":"Nice coffee shop! Themed after Harry Potter, but more on the subtle side thankfully. Little references are placed around here and there. Don't expect any cardboard cutouts of your favorite characters or anything.

I had the sea salt cream nitrobrew. It's infused with nitrogen and comes out of a tap. Nice and smooth, like a Guinness! Tasty too! With the coffee I had the chocolate chip croissant twist. Had some pastry cream in there with the chocolate chips, yum! 

The place itself is nice and clean, but small. They seemed super busy, too, so come with friends to help with table hunting!"}
{"text":"Awesome place. The Harry Potter theme is well done here, not too excessive or juvenile. Staff is friendly and accommodating, even during a noon rush with a malfunctioning ice maker and repairmen around them!! They were on point. 

Now for the product: coffee. I'm a pistachio fan so I tried the latte and it was beautifully crafted. Equipped with a foam design, the flavor was mellow and delicate but not in need of more sweetener. It was just right. The macarons are EXCELLENT. Whoever makes these, knows what they're doing. I recommend the passion fruit if you're into fruity flavors. Their sandwiches are also not bad albeit a bit pricey. The prosciutto and fig is a good one. 

Overall, Bad Owl leaves a GOOD impression. Will return!"}
{"text":"All the seats were taken when we arrived, but there was no one in line thankfully. As much as I wanted to check this place out as soon as it opened, I didn't want to deal with the lines that everyone complained about. But I also wanted to get here before it shut down for copyright infringement.

I immediately went for the iced butter \"brew\" latte (looks like they already switched the name from butter beer) and my fiance got the white forest latte with sea salt cream. I didn't add the espresso in my drink so it was basically a delicious milky butterscotch drink which I was fine with. His drink tasted just like eating a forest cake, so being able to drink a cake was amazing. 

Besides being a Harry Potter fan, I love the dark decor. I want to decorate my house with all the rustic furniture they have here.

I'm more of a tea drinker so next time I'll explore that part of the menu."}
{"text":"I love their coffee. The service is great, great atmosphere in the shop. I saw some foods that they brought to other customers and it almost had me drooling. Will definitely be going here for all my coffee fix."}
{"text":"Went here today. I had to look online at a menu to figure out what's inside each coffee..the menu at the store just states each coffees name, not whats in them. I had the almond milk latte, which you have to ask for \"expresso\" for coffee?? Its a latte? Shouldnt it already be coffee?? I didnt like it much. My mom ordered butter beer latte no \"expresso\" which tasted just like butterscotch. 
The main dissapointment was the size of the cup for how much you pay. A \"regular\" cup is the same size as starbucks mini extra small cup. Thats rediculous for $5!!! I can go to starbucks and get a grande for the same price for more coffee and it tastes better! Never going back here"}
{"text":"Worst customer service. Waited 47 minutes for avocado toast and when I asked what was taking so long the register said she forgot to print the ticket and forgot to give it to the kitchen. I then waited 15 more minutes for them to make toast. Great concept, terrible workers. Super upset and disappointed"}
{"text":"We had our team pow wow here this morning coffee was amazing and great atmosphere!! Love that Henderson has a moms and pops place!!!"}
{"text":"Good strong coffee. Tucked away in a corner shopping center near TJ's and unfortunately a Starbucks. Super friendly atmosphere, and less busy than the aforementioned SB."}
{"text":"I love exploring around town & finding new coffee shops to go to. This is definitely one I will be going back to. The girls at the front were unbelievably friendly, not only that but their coffee is delicious. I love the design of the shop & it's not crazy busy so you can hang out, do homework, or have a bible study (which I did). Great place!"}
{"text":"Pro: Iced Butterbrew Latte with expresso has to be the best butterscotch drink I've ever tried! Seating is very limited but customer service is excellent! Very attentive m!

Cons: 

Decoration: 3/5 it is done to the bare minimum I was expecting to see more of the Harry Potter magic come alive.

Food: avocado toast was okay but the pesto sandwich was delicious until we found 2 (i believe) eye lash hairs and to me it wasn't that bad to see that but did stop us from continuing to eat it."}
{"text":"During a recent Vegas trip, I made sure we stopped here for coffee. I had heard good things from friends and who doesn't love a good themed coffee shop. Upon arrival, it wasn't really busy inside - which was nice. I ordered the Spanish Latte (condensed milk was used as the sweetener) and the pumpkin waffles. My husband ordered a hot Butterbeer (which has no espresso) and my sister-in-law ordered a caramel latte and a donut. I loved my drink - it was one of the best I've had in a while. Even my husband loved it and was super jealous. (His drink was good but really sweet. Like a butterscotch steamer.) The waffles were good but nothing exciting. Too many sauces/sides - butter, syrup, something sweet, and Butterbeer whipped cream. Overall, I'd definitely come back for the coffee. Additionally, the inside is cute and fun."}
{"text":"You know those things that you have to do once, but you don't ever go to do twice? That's how I felt about Bad Owl Coffee. The Harry Potter- ness was nothing more than some stenciled spells on tables and the famous 9 3/4 wall, but not much else. There is a cute nook with the books toward the back, but that's it. Where's the Harry Potter music?! Where's the Harry Potter themed uniforms?! I want MORE. If you're going to go themed, go all the way!
There aren't many seats so it's not a place you can go to study. There is a large communal bench table which would probably be your best place to go unless you want people to give you dirty looks for taking up one of the limited tables. Also it's a little dark so if you're doing paper studying... eh. ALSO the two tables I sat at were WOBBLY. No way will I get any studying done at a wobbly table. 
The coffee drinks were fun and good. If you have a friend in town (by town, I mean staying in Henderson- I wouldn't make the trip from the strip) by all means meet up for coffee here. 
ALSO no poke stop here, bummer. :)"}
{"text":"I liked it but too many people just sitting and taking up space. Good drinks glad to see they have beer now. Nothing too out of the ordinary and good service. Would like to give one more star but just can't seem to get past the ordinary food, I get the Harry Potter thing but that's about it."}
{"text":"Bad owl coffee. Wow! they bake their pastries in house every morning. The chocolate croissant twist was to die for. I tried the iced lavender latte. I liked it but think I will opt for regular latte never time. Their signature drink is the butter brew latte and they have a variety of other fun lattes. check in and get 20 % off an iced drink of your choice. They offer very high quality coffee, free wifi, and fun decor themed around Harry Potter without being over the top. Definitely give bad owl coffee a try."}
{"text":"In now for large Americano with 6 shots and lots honey. Just right here with actually a large size to go cup. Lovely Lass attending. Nice setting and seating area. I'll be back again for sure."}
{"text":"Super cute place with Harry Potter deco! They have soo many coffee options, especially for me since I'm lactose and not a coffee drinker due to caffeine. I got the ice mint mojito I think decaf with almond milk, was very good!"}
{"text":"My complaints about Henderson's poor quantity of local owned business have finally been heard! And we now have a new coffee shop in the area that's brewing a lot of attention

Setting: Located in the Kmart plaza on Horizon Ridge and Eastern, it is behind the jackinbox/bank by the pei wei. A sign on the outside that screams super cool, has an aesthetic treat for those interested in the dark arts, lightning bolt scars, and magic. HARRY POTTER THEMED! The interior is like a cocktail bar you'd find somewhere in diagon alley. 

Service: I was greeted by a young guy during their soft opening who was cordial and very excited to be a part of this experience. A gentleman who brought my coffee to me, appeared to be the co-owner and was especially kind. Offering to bring me sugar, cream to my table, a back rub, but I had to decline.

Coffee: The main three blends to choose are sumatra, ethiopia, and brazil. I chose the Sumatra v60 which honestly is the best coffee i've ever had! You could really taste all the mild notes of blueberries with barely any acidity. 

Drip: Your traditional coffee machine

V60: Is a type of pour over that achieves a faster brew utilizing a larger opening for water through the filter that requires steady pouring to achieve the desired flavors.

Aeropress: A device that supposedly yields coffee with smoother taste and lower bitterness by utilizing ideal water temperatures, and gentle air pressure.

Kyoto: A giant apparatus that utilizing ice and a much slower brewing process to filter out all the acidity from the oils of the coffee beans to bring out a much richer, acid free brew. (Not available when I was there)

Overall: This is a great place for people who can really appreciate unique brewing methods to bring out the best flavors of coffee. Not a place to study but more geared towards couples or groups wanting to just spend some time together."}
{"text":"Came here with my cousins to try the coffee here. They loved it and I loved it. We got the same thing the butter brew latte except one of my cousin got the ice one. The flavor of our latte was excellent. I drank all of it. The decorations inside was very lovely and unique. If this place was closer to my apartment then I would go here more often but due to its location I can only go once in a while if I'm in the area. It's about a 20 minute drive from my place. Hope they would open more locations up."}
{"text":"Fantastic and friendly service, great coffee, delicious pastries, and awesome ambiance. We tried the roasted almond latter, the butter beer latte, and a caramel macaroon. So good! We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Coffee is delicious definitely will be back it's super chill in here. Everyone seems super nice and I love all the Harry Potter decor"}
{"text":"Major props to my husband for noticing this coffee shop last weekend while we were driving down Eastern. We decided to stop in yesterday and we were oblivious to the fact that this was the grand opening day. Whatever they've done to advertise is working because the place was packed. The line was to the door when we arrived and stayed that way until we left.

The shop is apparently Harry Potter themed. I didn't catch this at first since Harry Potter isn't my jam, but I like owls so I can appreciate that aspect. I liked the overall design of the shop and the colors they chose. 

Even though the shop was crazy busy the staff was still very friendly and not acting frazzled. The woman handing out the prepared drinks was thanking everyone for their patience with the long wait. 

The menu offers a nice variety of items. They have several offerings for true coffee devotees. The latte selection is impressive and they have some really unique flavors. The pistachio latte and lavender latte are what initially intrigued me enough to stop in. I'd love to return for tea as well because they have several delicious sounding tea concoctions. The pastry selection was limited yesterday, but I wonder if that was because they ran out of things with how busy they were. 

I had an iced pistachio latte, passion fruit macaron, and caramel macaron. The pistachio flavor was very bold and required some heavy stirring to get the taste to be right, but overall it was a good drink. Both macarons had great flavor and the consistency was correct. It's rare that a macaron is the correct consistency so I really appreciated that the macarons were done right. My husband had an iced mint mocha which he really enjoyed. He said the mint was more subtle than other mint mochas he has had, but it was good.

I'll definitely be back to try more of the fun lattes and teas."}
{"text":"Best Cappuccino coffee in town. 
My wife loved the Almond Roast. 
Pleasant atmosphere, including the music. 
Glad we came across the Bad Owl."}
{"text":"No need to wait for your acceptance letter from Hogwarts, just come to Bad Owl Coffee to escape the muggle life!  

Bad Owl Coffee is located on Eastern and Horizon Ridge, in the K-Mart shopping center.  Walking into the place was like magic, Harry Potter decor everywhere!  Each table had it's own unique phrase, whether it be Espresso Patronum or the Deathly Hallows mark.  I loved the Platform 9 and 3/4 wall! It made me want to grab a cart and run through it.  The atmosphere is amazing for anyone who loves Harry Potter!  

If it wasn't Harry Potter themed, I wouldn't see myself coming back.  I got the Roasted Almond Latte.  What's cool is that they ground almonds into it to give it some texture.  The idea sounded great!  However, when I got my coffee, it was lacking... The latte was a bit bland, just warm, and the texture of the almonds didn't impact the flavor.  The almonds weren't grounded well, it felt like I've been chewing on them for too long.  We tried the Butter Beer Latte and the idea of what it should taste like versus what we actually had, was also underwhelming.  It wasn't overly sweet like the Secret Menu Butter Beer at Starbucks, but it didn't leave you wanting more.  The teas were also following the same trend as the lattes.  The Apple Malt and Jasmine Blueberry tea smelled better than it tasted.  We thought that maybe the tea bags needed to steep longer, so we waited...and waited.. and well.. It was still the same.  

Maybe we ordered the wrong stuff?  But at 8 AM, I'm looking for something to wake me up.  I wasn't able to get a good caffeine buzz from anything that I tried.  I would come back to hang around some Pure-Blood fanatics!  I noticed a lot of the customers getting the Nitrogen Coffee.  Maybe next time, I'll skip the fancy lattes and take my coffee (Sirius) Black."}
{"text":"This place is THE CUTEST!!!!! It is Harry Potter themed and you definitely feel like you're at hogwarts when you step in. I haven't been here since they first opened and they've added more seating and decorations. They also serve wine and beer now which is a huge plus. Definitely a cute place to have a wine night. They have the best coffee shop menu and the best prosciutto Sandwhich I've probably ever had. Their menu is pretty extensive but their staff is friendly and willing to help and make suggestions. I love their nitro cold brew coffee. They also have Caradito which you don't really see in vegas. Today I ordered a gourmet pb and j which was recommended to me. Get here early, there's usually a line mid day."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try out the Nutella latte here, so when I finally stopped by this place I had to order it. I'm gonna keep it simple. After waiting in line for 5 minutes with only one couple in front of me, then waiting another 10 minutes for my latte and calling my order out with a name that was nowhere close to sounding like mine (i was a little irked at this point) I grabbed my latte, got in my car and left.. I took a sip of the latte and it was ROOM TEMPERATURE. I don't think I've ever gone to a coffee shop that served a lukewarm drink meant to be hot. If the barista knew it was just sitting there, he should have known better to make a new one. What added to the disappointment was the price. $6+ medium size lukewarm latte."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere & great staff! This coffee shop a far drive for me as it is deep in Henderson and I live on the opposite end of Vegas, but definitely worth a visit at least once, especially if you love teas and coffee.

I'm not sure who helped me the night I went, but it was a girl with a Finding Nemo tattoo on her arm. She was personable and extremely helpful --she gave us (my friends and I) all great recommendations based on our conversion. I was super picky since I am caffeine-sensitive and didn't like cinnamon, and she went through the menu for items that I could have. I ended up getting the butterbeer (hot) which was pretty good, but definitely way too filling for an post-dinner wind-down.

I'm interested in coming back here if I am ever on this side of town! :)"}
{"text":"The waffles were the best! Served with buttercream and ice cream:) My kids loved the fun decor and butter beer"}
{"text":"For a Tuesday, midday, this place is still pretty packed with college students and others with odd work hours. I didn't have to wait in line too long-- with a couple in front of me.. but after me a 10 min line had built up.

The butter brew latte with espresso tastes like any other flavored latte with a butterscotch aftertaste. It's delicious but not what I was expecting in terms of a super Harry Pottered drink. I think I'll make it a point to not get the espresso shot next time just to give it another shot.

The place is definitely a cool spot to hang out if you have plenty of time to kill. I'll definitely be back.. likely mid week to avoid crowds.. to try their Nitrogen Cold Brew, one of their specialty lattes, or espresso. 

P.s. I've heard lines are hit or miss. On the weekends the wait could be up to 40-something minutes. For someone whose an avid Harry Potter fan and keen on the Wizarding World of Harry Potter at Universal... I think you might be disappointed if you're only coming here for that theme. Aside from a bunch of signs.. it looks like a normal hipster coffee shop."}
{"text":"I freaking love this cute little spot. I only ordered one thing cause I wasn't hungry so I got the butter beer coffee. Oh my gosh!! I keep raving about this place to everyone. I have to admit it's the best coffee I have ever had. I can't wait to go back to Vegas to visit! Cute set up too for us Harry Potter lovers."}
{"text":"I don't even drink coffee, or normally like it in general. But this place has me hooked hooked on their cold brew! And I drink it black! I haven't tried their food yet, but they gained a repeat customer, so breakfast here is in the near future."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and cute Harry Potter theme. 
It was early and I kind of ordered the first thing I saw on the menu. Roasted Almond Latte. It sounded good for a chilly morning...but when I received it, I was shocked that there were actual almonds in my hot latte. Personally, it ruined the drink for me and I ended up throwing it out before I could finish it.
I wouldn't mind going back to try out other drinks hopefully without nuts in them!"}
{"text":"I enjoy stopping by for some good coffee. I usually order iced coffee with lavender and soy.  I enjoy this location and try to stop by often."}
{"text":"Great Harry Potter themed coffee shop. 

Great place to sit down and get some work down while having great coffee and food. 

Service was great!"}
{"text":"Coffe was killer, I told the barista what I liked they made a recommendation and was spot on, they have cold oats which is one of my favorite breakfasts and they were delicious. Great ambiance and decor. Cool little joint."}
{"text":"Looking for a book lover's coffee shop? Well here it is! This Harry Potter inspired coffee shop brings in the elements of the series with a hipster flare. The design of coffee shop is classy and chic with base tones of greys, silver and black. They have a labtop bar and small tables with Harry Potter quotes with coffee puns, to chat with your friends or just read a book! I have ordered several times the Toasted Toffee coffee and even tried their buttery, fluffy waffles! Super tasty and scrumptous! I am not a huge Harry Potter fan but I do share an appreciation for the artistic renderings of the literary arts. (P.S. You should listen to the audio books with Jim Dale on the Harry Potter series!) The only thing that is unfortunate is that it closes early around 6pm. So completely different from other coffee shops, this place rates a number one in all areas from atomosphere to execellent coffee!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice so far since it's near the office. each time, I've been lucky to beat the crowd that everyone was talking about.  it truly does get busy and seems like the line is always slow moving. im not sure why, maybe because of the cashier?!?  it doesn't make sense, but people have been patient.  

I've also had the pastries, which were good. I enjoyed the nitro brew that came out of the tap.  prices are the usual pricey coffee shop prices, no surprise.  overall, I would easily go here vs. starbucks, etc. if you're lucky to beat the crowd, stay and enjoy.  the barista's are friendly, the cashier lady is ... ok.  since location is close to me, i'll be back.  if there's a line out the door, be prepared for atleast 20-30 min wait."}
{"text":"Bad owl was awesome! I ordered the lavender ice coffee and my husband got the Nutella iced latte. Omg so good and they were all so nice. The decor is amazing. I can't wait to go back. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"This is a neat little coffee shop in Henderson and a great place to stop by on the way to Hoover Dam or The Strip. The place is Harry Potter themed, well at least the tables are. However, other than that there was no real magic about it. Everything was quite more expensive than I expected....even more expensive than most specialty coffee places in California! (I'm from California). 
I would suggest, only go for the coffee.. I bought some pastries, but they warm it up by microwave. I got the nitro cold coffee, which was extremely smooth and dark and rich. It was like a good stout without the alcohol. My boyfriend got the butter brew latte. Okay, BOC, just call it butterscotch milk! The latte didn't even have any coffee element. With already being just milk and paying 4-6 bucks for just milk, you don't have espresso?? You have to ask for a shot espresso, which obviously they would charge. I wondered why they asked do you want a shot of espresso. When he got it, he was disappointed that it was called a latte when in fact it was just a cup of milk. So I had to ask the barista why they called it a latte, etc, and got a free shot of espresso."}
{"text":"Super cute coffee shop. Really small and intimate, and people here are super friendly. They're willing to help you explain and choose a coffee if you've never been here. The Almond coffee is delicious and the macaroons are pretty good. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere! Plus they have the best americano!! I add a little coconut flavor to it and some half and half...tastes like an almond joy."}
{"text":"Cute coffee shop, a bit busy for 4:15pm in the afternoon. There were only two people working so my latte took quite some time to be prepared. I would def. Return just not when I was pressed for time."}
{"text":"What an amazing place.. great coffee great company... Thank you to Jared our barista for the flight of the \"Hawaiians\" espresso shots experience..."}
{"text":"If you life coffee and Harry Potter then this is the perfect place to be. Great ambiance and staff, coffee is good. I suggest the butter brew signature late. So if your coming into town or leaving it's great destination to grab some brew."}
{"text":"Lavender latte: I loved it. If you don't like lavender tea, you won't like it. Its definitely not for everyone, but it's for me for sure. 
Butter Brew: I got this for my kids. My 4 year old hated it while my 18month old tot love it. My hubby and I both enjoyed the flavor. 

Atmosphere: the decor was cute. It reminds me of the movie more than the book. Not that I'm against that. Some tables needed clearing up, but they were very busy so I don't hold it against them. If you're looking for a quaint coffeehouse, this won't satisfy your need. It's busy! 

Service: superb! Very friendly and quick. I waited a bit to order, but my drinks came out faster than I expected. 
Worth my time for sure!"}
{"text":"I wouldn't care if they were Harry Truman themed instead of Harry Potter. The important part is that their coffee is fabulous. The Nutella latte is amazing."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place!  As a huge harry potter fan, the phrases/words on each table made me chuckle as some of them brought back memories of the story.  I had the Roasted Almond latte which was made with small bits of crushed almonds which was very different to me and I loved it! The owners Annie and Yuzo were very friendly and attentative on my order.  I mentioned that I had to limit my carbs and sweets so they gave me options of almond milk, soy milk, less sugar, etc.

It didn't have a syrupy, artificial flavor taste but instead a very natural almond taste plus small almond pieces per swig.  Not something I was used to but I much, much prefer this now.

My best friend had the jade green tea latte and her description was perfect, \"this is exactly what a green tea latte should taste like.\"

Her husband had the V60 (euthiaopian) and loved it.  The caffeine definitely woke him up but it tasted smooth and wasn't overpowring.

The atmosphere was very relaxing.  It's lightly lit inside so it had a nice, calm, relaxing and \"chill\" ambience.  Excellent place to bring a small group of friends to talk the afternoon away or to pick up a quick drink.  They also have snacks and pastries if you get hungry!"}
{"text":"Maybe I'm biased because this entire cafe is catered to Harry Potter fans. Or maybe it's the TARDIS door I missed when entering on the right hand side. However, no matter where I looked I could find no wrong here. 

Let start with the menu, each item is filled with punny items from Harry Potter, which made me chuckle so much it took me a hot minute to order. I ended up getting a lavender latte and their bacon grilled cheese with goat cheese and no guac. One of my friends ordered their nitro cold brew as well as their Hogwarts house espresso shots and the same sandwich as I did. And my other friend just got the breakfast platter. 

Once again I could see no wrong here. There are games they have stored on the bookshelf, along with the entire Harry Potter series. Each table has a different quote from the books, where we were able to play while enjoying our food and drinks. 

We played a card game based on \"never have I ever\" and enjoyed our time there. 
The Harry Potter shots are each a different flavor. Gryffindor being cinnamon, Ravenclaw is rose, Hufflepuff is butterscotch and Slytherin is coconut. My absolute favorite was Hufflepuff... but I'm also biased for my own house as well. 

That sandwich though! That was delicious. I did end up eating half of my friends sandwich and honestly, the guacamole just doesn't fit. There is already the creamy cheese on the rye bread with their delicious bacon, and the consistency of warm guacamole is just not as appetizing. 

I absolutely loved my lavender latte. They make the syrup in house and it's delicious. Unlike most establishments the flavor is not lacking or artificial tasting.

Thus place is a wonderful place to hang out, have a bite and just chill around!  

Happy Eating!"}
{"text":"I had a Nitrogen cold brew and my daughter an iced vanilla latte, we both LOVED our coffees , we'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Visited a few times now, haven't been happy with any drink I've gotten and for a Harry potter themed shop I expected more wizardry..."}
{"text":"Such an unique and fun coffee shop here in Henderson! I'm not a huge Harry Potter fan but still found enjoyment in the theme of the shop, they have little messages on tops of the tables and a little Hedwig in the lounging area. Over all the atmosphere is rustic yet sleek. 

Now on to the important part, the coffee! They have a good assortment of different coffee choices that are familiar and some that were unique to me. I asked the barista what was the most popular and he replied with the \"lavender iced white mocha.\" So of course I had to try it.  It ended up only being around $5 and one of the best coffees I have ever had! It was so yummy! I definitely will be going back."}
{"text":"This is good coffee!! Lots of options. The coffee tastes rich and quality. Their menu items are unique and tasty. This atmosphere is comfortable, modern, and Harry Potter inspired. I recommend this spot for homework, meetings, and just to hangout in general. The service is great everyone is very friendly and personable."}
{"text":"Our Uncle came into town and said he wanted some real coffee. We heard good stuff about Bad Owl Coffee. We asked the cashier what was good and that was game over. 

We tried the Nutella latte and lavender white mocha. It was a game changer. 

Service was excellent, coffee was !

We will be back.

I want to try a quiche and a roasted almond latte."}
{"text":"All my dreams came true when I discovered there was a soft opening for this place! Baristas are ultra sweet, coffee is amazeballs (try the pistachio latte), and the atmosphere is very welcoming. They have these awesome lamps hanging, Harry potter themed decor throughout and a dope soundtrack. Wasn't too busy when we stopped by, and they even brought our drinks to the table. Will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"They have a huge selection of speciality latte flavors and some really unique ways of brewing coffee. Their pastry selection is pretty standard. I love the Harry Potter theme. It's a fun place to hang out. I tried the butter beer latte, but it was way to sweet for me. It basically taste like butterscott. My favorite latte flavor there was the almond latte. It has chunks of almonds in it and isn't too sweet. My hubby loves their nitro brew there."}
{"text":"Very cute ambiance and the breakfast food any tea was great as well as the friendly staff. Will definitely go again."}
{"text":"Super cute coffee shop with a Harry Potter theme. Place is located in a shopping center with a good amount of parking. There's lots of small tables and a couple of longer, bigger tables. The small tables have different cute sayings like Caffeine Managed, etc. play on Harry Potter quotes and coffee. There's music playing but still a good place to study or meet up with friends.

I got the roasted almond latte that has almond bits on the bottom. It's a bit strong, comes with 3 shots of espresso, I would opt for 2 next time. My fiancé got the butterbrew latte which has no espresso but you can add. Both were good and were around $5 each for a large. The butterbrew tastes like the butterbeer that they have at Universal Studios! 

Atmosphere is chill and the coffee is good. I would definitely come back when I'm back in the area!"}
{"text":"This place is soooo cute, especially if you are a Harry Potter fan. I had the Belgian waffles with nutella and bananas--amazing! Came with maple syrup, butter and a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream on the side. I also had the Secret Iced Tea which was an unsweetened black iced tea with floral notes. My only complaint was that the service was kind of slow--line moves very slowly and the food took a long time to come out--so this is not the place to go for a quick coffee or meal. Also, it is pretty pricey. I guess part of what you pay for is the ambiance which is great."}
{"text":"Coffee that actually tastes like coffee and all within a neat atmosphere of friendly staff and people.
So many options to choose from but anything with salted caramel gets my vote! :)"}
{"text":"This place rules!! Harry Potter themed. Righteous coffee. Delicious baked goods. Not much else they could do besides have a drive thru. We will definitely be back. Delish! Espresso Patronum!!!"}
{"text":"I'll probably be back here...for the coffee.  The mediocre food isn't worth the high prices they want for it.  They need to hire more people, this place is obviously super popular, and there was constantly a long line the whole time I was there, and all the employees looked like they wanted to have a hysterical cry (and I don't blame them).  Everyone was really super nice and friendly though, despite the obviously high stress environment.

Lattes were delicious.  I was worried they were going to be way too sweet, and mine was maybe about 20% too sweet for my taste, but they definitely weren't syrupy or badly made.  They did get mine wrong, but it was another flavor I wanted to try sometime anyway, so I just let it go, and it was tasty.  Lots of interesting flavors on the menu.  The menu isn't quite as awesome as Grouchy John's, but this is still one of the better coffee shops in town.  Their nutella latte is better than Sambalatte's, IMO.  And I'm definitely swayed by the awesome theme."}
{"text":"If you want to be under the spell of premium coffee in a charming themed coffee shop, visiting the Bad Owl is a wise decision. If you are my Yelp friend, you are aware by my check ins and reviews that I am usually under the spell of coffee. In the past couple of weeks I had been following the updates on this Harry Potter themed coffee shop that was opening on Saturday, February 13, 2016 in the Kmart themed shopping center at the northwest corner of Eastern Avenue at Horizon Ridge Parkway in Henderson. 

   Right off the bat, the Bad Owl is wise to location location location. It is a chirp away from spectacular restaurants including Blaze Pizza. As I drove into the shopping center I noticed that the Bad Owl already has the Green Mermaid as a nemesis. When I drove by the empty pod near Arby's, I saw \"Coming Soon Starbuck's.\"  With that said, the Bad Owl will have to have a good spirit to share the limelight with Starbuck's. From today's experience, I spent a couple of hours under the spell of a good owl. 

    Today was the official Grand Opening of the Bad Owl and my day off. I could afford to be indolent and spend a couple of hours here. I'd enjoy a Roasted Almond Late then a drip coffee with butterscotch syrup. 

   When I walked into the relatively small shop, the Grand opening scene was a laid back pandemonium. There was a line that twisted around to the entrance of a room bordered by grey brick walls around a wood colored floor. It felt like I was in an event where the community was celebrating the newest coffee shop. When I waited in this line, I was more optimistic than impatient. I was disheartened when the nearby Galaxy Coffee shut down, and was becoming optimistic that the local coffee shops could coexist with the chains. If I had gone online when I was on line, I would read that in the summer that Bad Owl plans to add craft beer and wine to their menu (Barnes & Nobles is considering the same move). 

   The theatre of the Harry Potter theme kept the customers and yours truly entertained. I am not really a Harry Potter fan but a fan of imagination and animals including owls. Inside this room of imagination my eyes roamed toward the large Bad Owl logo over the tables to the right, to the Owl statue in a cage placed on a tower of suitcases in platform 9 1/3, and toward the back chairs arranged around a display of Harry Potter books. This theatre of Harry Potter theming transformed me from Henderson, Nevada to Great Britain. 

   There wasn't a sleepy moment in the Bad Owl. The caffeineated beverages kept me awake despite the fact the dim lighting could put me asleep if I was enjoying wine in the later hours. Just like an owl, Mad Owl is open later than many of its competitors. The roasted almond late that kept me up, was delectable. It is nice to know that I know of another spot besides E Cafe in Fashion Show to appreciate caffeineated almond based late drinks. By the time, I revisited the counter for a drip coffee with butterscotch syrup, there were far less people near the Owl statue. Around 5 pm the pandemonium died down. This was stamp two on my card that could lead to a complimentary beverage. There was a moderate delay from time of order to when the batista delivered it to the chair. I exchanged lost time for a freshly made delicious cup of Boyd  coffee. 

    As I walked from the back two plush chairs around the display of Harry Potter books toward the exit, I passed the long counter with the orange hanging lamps to the right and a display case that will present a sundry of desserts in the future then the two long common tables; and toward the left I passed a half dozen circle tables engraved with Harry Potter sayings and the charismatic owl statue. By the time I left the door and looked toward Kmart, I had the feeling that I will be revisiting the exact scenery. Delicious Coffee and imagination create an OWLsome spell to be under for a couple of hours."}
{"text":"The cutes coffee shop I've been too....drinks are delicious, customer service is AMAZING! I will definitely be back to try more."}
{"text":"This is our first time coming here and we ordered a Iced Brevé with 1 pump coconut. We've been looking for a coffee shop here in Vegas that is similar to the Brevé in Seattle. We've been to several already and this is the closest to that Brevé! Finally! Yes"}
{"text":"Such an adorable vibe!!!! I can't wait to come back and order different items from the menu! The macaroons are amazingly delicious! And the service is exceptional. I will DEF. Be come a usual customer!"}
{"text":"This place is truly a hidden gem!  Not only do they  offer a quality delicious menu, but I can't say enough about the awesome staff!  Their recommendations were spot on. The surroundings are really cool. Even their music choices were spectacular. Can't say enough good things. I'll be back often"}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere, excellent customer service, yummy food. Looking forward to trying new things here."}
{"text":"Do you like Harry Potter? Do you like coffee too? Great! This place has both and has good customer service. I was greeted right away and immediately I knew I wanted to try the butter brew latte, but I wanted it with coffee. In this case, the gentleman explained to me it will be 3 shots of espresso in the medium size I was getting. Works for me. Also, there were some chocolate croissant samples out to try, but I passed for now. It did look good though. They also have some macarons and other baked goods in a case. I'll give that a try next time, but I'm here for the homage to Harry Potter. Cute, fun, a little Halloween like, but not too cheesy. It's actually well themed- decorated. The tables with some catchy Potter references are clever. My drink came up pretty fast and was tasty. It's different for sure, but in a good way. I would describe it like a smooth butter vanilla coffee. The place is also very clean and there is plenty of parking. Definitely would recommend checking out."}
{"text":"I decided to try this place because of the good reviews and wanted something different then Starbucks, I must say the coffee was delicious. I will definitely come back. 


We ordered the Chai Latte and Butter Brew latte ( hot ) it was so good. I liked how their coffees aren't so sweet like Starbucks. It's like a perfect combination. Also the beignets were really good too."}
{"text":"THIS IS THE HARRY POTTER CAFE YOU'VE HEARD YOUR FRIENDS & COWORKERS TALK ABOUT

Bad Owl puts an adult spin on your childhood fantasies and really brings your adolescent dreams of studying at Hogwarts to life. They're not too over the top with their theme though. Some flying letters up above & Platform 9 & 6/8* off to your right welcome you to the wizarding world and if you're up for it the barista's will happily make you a butterbrew latte to complete your stay. 

I ordered a lavender white mocha that was quite good, but tasted none like lavender and Matthew ordered a London Fog at the recommendation of our barista. The London Fog was a cup of Earl Grey combined with steamed milk. It would've been perfect had it come sweetened, but that was nothing that a tear & a flick of the wrist couldn't fix. 

If you're not in the mood for coffee or tea (and you have the liberty to do so), Bad Owl also serves beer and wine! On Thursday's, they offer bottles of wine at half price, so grab a cutie & head on over. We may even see each other there!"}
{"text":"I loved the atmosphere here, I'm a harry potter fan so it definately appealed to me :) 
They have a pretty big menu for drinks, most are good, some are kinda odd (you don't know of its good or just weird lol) 
I have tried the butter brew (their take on butter beer), the coconut latte (which is my favorite so far), Spanish latte ,as well as most of their teas.  All good, the butter brew gave me a tummy ache but is my sisters go to. 
I want to try the lavender latte, but am too anxious to try it since it's a weird concept.
Oh and the teas here fantastic, pretty good variety of old classics and exotic ones you didn't know existed!
The only downside is they quite often have a line out the door, bit they are pretty quick. Most I have ever waited to order was 10 min.

Definately a place to try!"}
{"text":"We wanted to come visit while in Vegas for dance nationals and to show our foreign exchange student since he adores HP. The Toasted Almond latte and Butter Brew blended were yummy and certainly did not disappoint. The Nutella blended was far too coffee and not remotely tasting of Nutella--for my teen this was a huge let down. 
The major issue was the waffles. We ordered three Nutella and banana waffles at 10:57am. At 11:28, I asked if they were ready yet. My mother who ordered ahead of us already had hers. I saw other sandwiches come out of the kitchen but not the waffles. The response was that they have one maker. I understand this fully--we bake waffles. However, I am not sure of any waffle maker that takes more than 5 minutes max per waffle; most are around 3 minutes cook time. About five minutes later, we got the three waffles but they did not have any bananas. My daughter asked for the bananas and was given a cup with four thinly  sliced pieces for all 3 waffles!!! These waffles are $9.50. We were patient. We fully expect when paying that we got the product description. I would not recommend purchasing food here. The waffle was good but cold. The Nutella was a slight drizzle in a cup. 
All in all, go for coffee and that's it. :)"}
{"text":"Cute place, great service, yummy food and drinks though a bit overpriced. Would come back."}
{"text":"My mom and I decided to stop in on our way to Vegas. One of the best decisions of our trip. Their Vanilla Lattes are absolutely amazing! We each had TWO! Which is saying a lot because I am actually not much of a coffee person. We also had some food while we sat and enjoyed the decorations. She had the egg and ham sandwich and I had the grilled cheese. Both meals were delicious. We will definitely be stopping by next time we come out this way!"}
{"text":"As a diehard Harry Potter fan this was a terrific find. I love the little Harry Potter things around the shop as well as the drink/food names. They also have a Tardis around so if you like Doctor Who (which I do as well as HP) it's an added bonus. A bit far from where I live but I love it & will be back!!!!"}
{"text":"After finding Bad Owl on yelp, my husband and I checked it out on a Saturday afternoon. They were crazy busy and the barista's were helpful in ordering our drinks. The iced mocha was great, as was the Nutella latte. The chocolate macaroon was a great little treat. Calm, quiet atmosphere, highly recommended."}
{"text":"This place is located on south eastern. 
Came here just to grab coffee. Came in and was impressed by the Harry Potter theme. For someone who is not a Harry Potter kinda person, it was cool. 

They have a lot of options at this cafe. From expressos to lattes, and food options like breakfast, waffles and sandwiches. 
The service is great and the order taker takes time to advise the ingredients of the order and if additional options are recommended. She even makes sure that your cup has your name spelled correctly.  
I ordered the breakfast croissant, butter latte and Nutella latte. They were amazing! I would totally return here because this place is really detailed with their lattes and it's hard to find a place like this in vegas."}
{"text":"I have had this place bookmarked for the longest time and I finally got to check it out this weekend. The location is in the same plaza as the El Pollo Loco and a few other places and was definitely not that hard to find. Parking space is a bit tight too but I found a spot right in front.

The establishment is a bit more spacious than I thought it would be - there are tables both in and out and two high table with plenty of seating. Harry Potter decorations everywhere! If you love HP I would definitely recommend coming here, even if you just want to grab a quick bite to eat! I also recommend coming here to study, it's very quiet and they have WiFi and outlets! (And a bathroom if you need to go!)

There are a selection of items on the menu such as sandwiches, espresso flights, teas, waffles, and even WINE! I gave up drinking coffee a few months ago so I was kind of sad that I wasn't able to try how good their espresso drinks are! Luckily they had teas and other non-coffee drinks such as Butterbrew, Chai, and Matcha. I asked the two employees which they preferred.. chai vs. matcha. And I decided to go with the Chai! I did not get their names but I was told that they make their chai in-house so I was excited to try it out. The drink came out quick and I loved it! It was very cinammon-y. 

My friend and I were there for a while and we moved from the inside tables to outside and the employees were nice enough to check up on us and also bring us some waters.   I cannot wait to come back and study and also try their waffles!"}
{"text":"Fun place !! Funky and steam punk style. I do agree with other reviews, that they need more harry potter themed decor besides a bunch of old suitcases and sticker decals. I had the pistachio iced latte it was amazing and very strong . We had yummy cookie butter waffles, (they took forever to make our food), small portions of food but actually it was just enough in the end. Iam giving this place 3 stars because, my waffles were served with ice cream; one big scoop just sitting there on my PLATE OF FOOD melting away all over my waffles. They did not offer me a spoon, so im sitting there, eating ice cream on a plate with a fork! At there prices we shouldn't have to beg for silverware. The employees are snooty. This place is a good idea in theory i just don't think its there yet. Im gonna keep trying tho, i will be back."}
{"text":"Their butterbrew is a must-try! Their Belgian waffles are perfect combination of sweet, salty, and crunchy. To top that off, it's Harry Potter themed!"}
{"text":"Can't say I'm a potter fan, but a coffee and tea lover, so a new coffee shop in the neighborhood is always exciting. I ordered an iced almond milk latte and was thrilled when I tasted it. Neat ambience, pleasant staff, and good coffee. I'll be back to try the variety of different brewing styles they offer!"}
{"text":"Absolutely adorable  The staff (particularly Amber) was seriously just the sweetest cup of tea! She even gave me and my son a photo shoot which was just a lot of fun, delicious coffee and fun atmosphere. Perfect mommy son date"}
{"text":"It's cute, they've tried to turn it into a Harry Potterish coffee cafe. The day we went the a/c was broken, so it was Hell-O HOT, so I felt really bad for the staff, but they were all still really nice and in a good mood. It's all the way across town from where I live, so unless I was in that part of town, I wouldn't be going there regularly, but lots of looky-loos snapping pics when we were there. If I lived in that part of town, absolutely, I'd probably hang out there. The coffees and teas we tried were good, kind of like Starbucks, price wise too. We tried the waffle w/butter beer cream, that was a little overpriced at $9.95 for a belgian waffle w/ice cream and butterscotch whipped cream, but nice atmosphere and staff. They were wearing cute shirts that read \"coffee managed\" on the back."}
{"text":"In LOVE with Bad Owl Coffee. Got myself a blended Matcha drink with almond milk. To my surprise, they added coffee to it rather than matcha alone and it was really good. My fiancé got an Americano which he said was really strong (in a good way). Yuzo, the owner, is super friendly and was very helpful when I had questions about their menu. Definitely can't wait to come back and bring my die hard HP fan friends with me."}
{"text":"GREAT! The line was long but that's the first sign that a place is great! I got the white chocolate lavender latte. So great! I love the Harry Potter theme as well."}
{"text":"I have gone to this place and I was a little disappointed. I love what they are trying to do with their Harry Potter theme...but I believe they could've done a lot more and the place is so small so there's only so much you can do. the drink I got was okay I guess."}
{"text":"Sometimes Starbucks can get so repetitive and you just need to try something new. Well that's what I did and I was very pleased I gave this gem a try!

[Environment] This coffee shop is COOL! The decor, feel and setup really reminds me of Harry Potter. It makes me feel like this is a spot where all the student wizards gather to do homework, chat, meet and enjoy some delicious coffee! Well done with the decoration! Love it!

[Service] The staff are friendly, kind and knowledgable. They have great recommendations and suggestions. Very patient with you looking through their big menu of selections and prompt with making which ever drink you desire. I was very pleased with the service.

[Drinks] The coffee here are very true, they just aren't loaded with milk and sugar to hide the amazing taste of coffee but I could really taste the what their coffee has to offer. Good bodied flavor and nicely roasted. Note: They also serve alcoholic beverages! So if you are needing something to \"wine\" down you day...they have it! Sadly I haven't tried the alcoholic beverages but maybe my next visit I will.

Overall, this a really neat place and I really recommend. If you're looking for something different and a cool spot. Check this place out! \"I'm a wizard Harry!\"

[ See it, Taste it, Yelp it! ]"}
{"text":"This place always have great tasting coffee. And only 1 of 2 places that carry amazing almond croissants! The wait for the coffee is always a little longer, as they always seem to be busy! For good reason. Have yet to try their food, but honestly for good coffee, this is the spot! I always get the pistachio latte, with espresso added! SO GOOD!"}
{"text":"overpriced for small portions and mediocre drinks. 
The mint mojito coffee drink was not for us, and the Nutella latte didn't taste anything like Nutella, the food was actually pretty good but still overpriced.

The cafe itself was cute, and well furnished. The staff was friendly, but unfortunately we probably won't be back because even though the theme was cool I'm an avid coffee drinker and i don't go to a coffee place to look at their decor. 
Three stars for the food being good, the cute/clean shop and friendly staff, but dropped two stars because the crappy coffee and price tag."}
{"text":"All of the raves from around town talking about Bad Owl. Here's the verdict:

Their food is not good. We ordered a sandwich each, and while \"home made\" is nice, this is a little too far. You remember when you were broke at home and hungry and decided to throw together whatever you had in the fridge and make a sandwich? And maybe some of those ingredients weren't in the prime anymore? Bingo. My sandwich had straight lunch meat on it, clearly of the low quality found in a plastic bag style, wilted lettuce, greasy toast, and a decent aioli. Do not recommend there food.

Their coffee, however, is pretty good. I can speak to their Kyoto Coffee. More expensive and smaller than you'd expect, just add a little cream to stave off some of the (very light!) acidity and you've got a cold brew that won't just give you a huge boost of energy, but a refreshing \"Ahhhh\" as you drink it down.

Three stars due to high price of low-quality food."}
{"text":"Tried it one time just to try.  The small coffee shop is very cute and trendy. The coffee i had was actually amazing!  Only reason i took one star off is because of their pricing.  I have never paid so much for a cup of coffee before and the only reason i wont be going back is due to the insane price of a cup of flavored coffee even though it was pretty yummy."}
{"text":"I like this spot for the decoration & delicious coffee. This is a good hanging out spot to chill for me. I got the coffee which is recommended by its popular & it came out like the way I expected, not too sweet & strong cold coffee. Their teas taste fruity but not sweet as my customize. I heard about the sandwich here & I will try more on my next visiting"}
{"text":"Every coffee I've tried here is excellent. The staff is super friendly and has great energy. I love the modern decor with a Harry Potter theme. This is my new morning coffee stop. Blows starbucks out of the water!"}
{"text":"I was really excited to check this place out since it is Harry Potter themed.

When I arrived the line was almost to the back of the shop. With it being so new it is very popular so be prepared to wait in line for around 20 minutes. I went at 1pm usually a not busy time and it was crowded. 

I wanted to buy a gift card for my coworker since it was her birthday coming up and she loves Harry Potter. Sadly they do not yet have those available. Hopefully one day they will since they are missing out on those sales.

I ordered the Butter Brew Latte which is a butter beer inspired drink. It is a top seller since everyone wants to order something Harry Potter themed. It is made with butterscotch and a secret ingredient. It was pretty good. They also have a nutella latte that would I like to try at a later date. It is on the more expensive side but then again any speciality coffee shop is. 

It's very hispter coffee shop and lots of cool Harry Potter references. A must see for any fan."}
{"text":"The Harry Potter themed decor was very nice; I ordered an iced biscoff latte and a croissant breakfast sandwich, the latte was ok and the sandwich was pretty good. A bit expensive though, for a coffee shop."}
{"text":"Visited this here while visiting Henderson and wow!!! Amazing food, atmosphere and people. I can't wait to come back"}
{"text":"I support that they're representing Harry Potter. I love it! That's why it was way busy here in the beginning. Good job. I waited until it died down, plus, its a far drive for me. 

I definitely have more drinks to try, but one of the girls told me her fave drink is a mocha with some lavender. So, I decided to try it out. I love lavender, so I had to do it. She convinced me...sorta. lol. I need to go back for the matcha! 

Anyway, it wasn't too bad. The lavender mocha was pretty good. 10 POINTS TO...the girl are the cashier for recommending. Heh heh. 
Also tried my brother's pastry, and it was pretty decent too. Nothing to rave too much about. 

The ambiance is pretty legit. I wanted to bring my wand with me when I went, but I think that's too much. So I wore my big, black \"witch\" hat. (I was having a bad hair day) There was, of course, references to everything harry potter. From platform 9 3/4 with the cart and the owl to each table having something engraved about the movie or characters. 

I need to come back and try some of their signature drinks. I just wish it wasn't on the edge of the earth. So far!"}
{"text":"This place has incredible decorations and everyone is so nice!! The coffee is incredible as well! My husband and I got the waffles. They are made to order. The presentation is awesome and the waffles themselves are incredible! We live in Louisiana, and I wish we had one near us! I love Harry Potter and this place is awesome! Highly recommend! We hope you have many years of success!"}
{"text":"I have come here three times to get a good feel for the place before I wrote a review.  Well, after spending about 90.00 over the past three visits, i can tell you, Bad Owl is a bad ouch on my wallet.

1.  Harry Potter - OK, so you know I have read the books many times and have seen Sorcerer's Stone about 12 times.  The Harry Potter theme at this place was a bit, well underwhelming. It is a bit of a gimmick.

2.  The Menu - Wow, what a choice and what a confusing choice as well. OK, I admit I am an analytical person and like a nice organized list.  Having the menu on clip boards with paper that is rolled up, or on the wall in handwriting and artsy and fartsy, actually made it difficult for me to read.

3. The coffee - Ummm, where are the large cups?

a. Hot Mocha Coffee - not bad
b. Nitrogen Cold Brewed Coffee - From the tap, kind of like Guiness.I found it to be okay.
c. Kyoto Brewed Ice Coffee- Okay, if you put a fine wine and a drinkable wine in front of me, I would not know the difference.  This brew was something I failed to admire.
d. Lavender Latte - Really? I think not.
e.  Butter Brew Latte - A bit much.
f.  Chocolate Croissant and Macarons - We wolfed these all down.

Overall, the coffee was very creative, just not coffee. These are interesting flavors, however, challenging to create a strong following.  

GK Says, a unique experience with good coffee.  If you want great coffee, Grouchy Johns has something special!"}
{"text":"Coffee was good and there was lots of fun Harry Potter decor! The staff was friendly. It's still fairly new though, and since it's the only Harry Potter themed place around, it was SUPER busy. We waited in line for just over an hour. Wouldn't have done that if it weren't a Harry Potter place. :) 

They were sold out of butter brew, though, which was very disappointing, but what can ya do? We'll  come back in a month or two to try butter beers, once the newness madness of it wears off a little."}
{"text":"I came here to do some work on a Friday night at 6:15ish. I assumed they only had coffee. NOPE, they have CRAFT BEER too. Ya girl was hyped when she picked up the clipboard menu at the register and read that there was a craft beer section.

I had a mental debate...well I'm here to do some homework... then the devil on my shoulder said \"but you did write your best papers in your undergrad under the influence.\" I gave in and decided to order a beer instead of a latte. 

I asked the barista/bartender what his fave beer was, he mentioned something about a golden monkey, so I quickly replied, I'll take it! He rang me up and said that's $4 and some change, and our happy hour ends at 7pm. WHAT? Ya'll Harry Potter coffee slangers got a happy hour on craft beer? He replied with, yes its $2 off. I immediately decided that I will be coming here from now on instead of the Starbucks .02 miles away. Let's just say the beer had hints of banana and goodness.

Thank you Bad Owl! I was able to complete my work, drink some delicious beer, draft some wizardry within my homework and feel great all at the same time. I will definitely come back have a beer and try your coffee."}
{"text":"The baristas here are super friendly! I've been here multiple times and never been disappointed. The environment is relaxing, and I would definitely recommend this place to anyone especially if they love Harry Potter."}
{"text":"Really really delicious coffee and sandwich!! I had the nitro brew with sea salt and it was amazing. The boc signature sandwich is full of flavor and tasty. The staff is also incredibly helpful, warm, and inviting!"}
{"text":"Very Harry Potter themed. Very well done. 
Wish there was a little more 'housing' themes. 
That's not the reason for the four stars. 
My girlfriend ordered two things that said was something flavored one way, but she tasted something completely different. 
I was content with my biscoff almond latte. The black currant macaroon was a bit sour, but I didn't know what to expect. So, it was good. 
This place is super hip. Super Harry Potter. And a little over rated. 
Good coffee. Nice baristas. Cool theme."}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't written a review for this spot yet? 

So we have been twice. I was super excited when it opened, because I have heard so many great things about this place. The line was always out the door, so we waited a few weeks.

The decor when you walk in is really cool. All Harry Potter stuff. My favorite is the Snape tribute table. My daughter loves the stuffed owl. 

My husband and I both ordered the butter beer latte, since everyone and their mom has been raving about these. I opted for no espresso for either of us. YUCK. It tasted like milk with a shot of buttescotch in it. I normally like butterscotch, but not mixed with milk. 

The second time I went, I don't even remember what I got. Must not have been memorable. 

The decor is cool, the staff is really nice, and the area where they make the drinks is really cool to look at. The drinks are just meh. I'll stick with my chai lattes elsewhere."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff. That was the 5th star for me! Great atmosphere! Look forward to going back."}
{"text":"Definitely a good atmosphere. We stopped in to use wifi when we were apartment shopping. Grabbed an iced coffee and a few macaroons. Definitely wasn't disappointed!"}
{"text":"Cute cute cute interior, Harry Potter theme and good coffee. I got the iced americano and it was delicious :)"}
{"text":"????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????^_^
?????????????????????????"}
{"text":"If you go on the weekend, then be prepared to wait. I came back for the second time today & had the Butterbrew latte w almond milk. It was soo good! The pastries are a little pricy, but they're worth it!"}
{"text":"This coffee house is Harry Potter themed and my 12 year old son loved it. The staff their was awesome.....twice! They created great drinks for us, then my son spilt his drink not more than 30 seconds after receiving it and I ordered a new drink expecting to pay for it. Nope. No charge. Great place. We will be back for Breakfast."}
{"text":"Decided to try the coffee shop again. This time I tried the blended Roasted Almond Latte, which was really good! They use real almond butter giving it a nice nutty flavor. 
With that said, I'm still not 100% sure how big of a fan I am of the shop. I still think they are over priced ~ $1 more than what other coffee shops would charge. And I'm not impressed with how crowded and cramped the space is and how slow the line moves. After being open for several months you'd think they'd have gotten a grasp of quick and speedy service. While I liked the latte I think if I had to pick between this and another local coffee shop I'd prob go elsewhere so I could have a comfy place to sit and sip my coffee and because I typically don't have an hr to wait to order and receive my drink."}
{"text":"A fun Harry Potter themed coffee spot with a loyal following of regulars around reading books, working on laptops or enjoying each other's company. I was introduced to the Affogato (espresso over ice cream) here and my life was changed!! I know they didn't invent the drink but they executed it flawlessly."}
{"text":"The service here is always great and they make you feel at home.  They use your name like a friend would and are very genuine!  Pastries are amazing and the coffee kicks Starbucks ass!!  Won't be getting my coffee fix anywhere else!!  Bad Owl for life!!"}
{"text":"This place was okay. Sad this place didn't live up to the hype. Came in at 530 on a Tuesday and it was ghost town. I was starving but they have no real food, only pastries... My only option was a muffin. I asked for an apple malt and the guy told me to hold on and check if they have it... Then I ordered a muffin and the guy was like oh idk what kind these are so I just picked a random one LMAO even though they were all marked... I asked for a almond one and he was like oh wait that's banana. So after three attempts I was like okay fine. I sat down and he's like oh so it's for here then... Yeah???? They also put a table in front of the menu how awkward

It was really confusing how to order. There's no signs and wasn't even sure where the line formed. They also don't have their WIFI posted in plain view, a girl next to me had to tell me it when I got up to ask, they should put it on their menu board. The prices are okay at most, cheaper than Starbucks. Their pastries are fairly priced too. 

The interior is really cute except for the cheap sterilmate Walmart trash can in the front... Yikes! Also it's SOOOO cold in here like wtf. And such slow internet... Nothing would load or took 5 minutes. We eventually gave up after waiting 10 min for a webpage to load."}
{"text":"This place was so cute!! I love the Harry Potter theme, and the coffee was delicious. The only gripe I had was how the breakfast sandwich was presented. I got the bacon cheddar quiche and it was amazing!! It came with a light salad on the side. My boyfriend got a breakfast sandwich which came with a little shot of yogurt. We ordered to dine in and mine came on a plate. But the sandwich came in a plastic basket with the yogurt in a plastic cup. I just think they should have given plates for both. But everything tasted great! We will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"So we drove all the way out here from NW Las Vegas because we are huge Harry Potter fans and couldn't wait to try this place. Upon arrival everyone was friendly and served our coffee in a timely manner. I also have no complaints with the quality of the coffee. We both had Nutella Latte s with almond milk and they were well done and the espresso doesn't taste burnt. Quality stuff. My complaint with this place is simply the fact the it's a \"Harry Potter theme\" but the only Harry Potter decoration they really had were a couple of signs here and there. I would've really liked to see the theme taken to another level. I don't know, maybe have the staff dress in HP robes or something? All in all it would get a higher rating if the Harry Potter theme thing was thought out a little more."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is amazing, if you love Harry Potter and Doctor Who, this place is worth visiting. The menu has a lot of fun to offer as well with wizarding  world inspired food and drinks. As for the coffee, I'd say it so so. Now I'm no coffee expert but it's just not my cup of tea. If you really enjoy more of a strong coffee flavor then you might like this but the espresso is just too strong for me. If we go back I will be asking for one or two shots rather than the three they put in the medium lattee. The staff was kind and were willing to answer questions and make accommodations. Overall it's good to see a unique and fun coffee shop in Vegas which is overflowing with chains."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place and their Harry Potter decor! Although there was a bit of a line and wait to order coffee, the staff was extremely nice and apologized for the wait. My boyfriend and I didn't mind waiting because we read all the reviews on how great their coffee is and was eager to try it out. I ordered the butter brew latte and my bf ordered a biscoff latte. My bf loved the biscoff latte and my butter brew latte actually tasted like butter beer from the time we went to Universal in Florida. One thing I recommend is that if you're a HUGE coffee junkie like me.. Order the butter brew latte with TWO shots of espresso. I overheard the girl in front of me say that she needed another caffeine booster since her butter brew latte with just one shot of espresso was not strong at all. Overall, it's a great coffee shop when I'm in the area. I'll def be coming back for sure."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Harry Potter themed ambience, great coffee, and friendly staff. My favorite drink is their Sea Salt Cold Brew, occasionally I'll have the sea salt nitro which is amazing as well. They do serve food here as well, their avocado ricotta is delicious! Great place for breakfast/lunch."}
{"text":"Pros: Great atmosphere, very trendy and good customer service.

Cons: The drinks and menu weren't Harry Potter inspired.

Cost: $3.95 for a small ice tea

Experience: We were coming back from Utah and this was FINALLY my chance to try this Harry Potter inspired cafe but boy was I disappointed. Don't get me wrong, it's a nicely decorated, and it's a trendy cafe spot like all cafe's these days but it just wasn't as innovative with the theme as I thought it was going to be from the videos and pictures on social media.

Literally looked at the menu and no word play or even trying to resemble the magical world. So ordered a iced tea because it is Nevada and summer. Lol it was good.

Conclusion:
You're not missing out on anything but it is a good place to do work and if you need a cafe this is a place to go."}
{"text":"The cold coffee drinks are great and the atmosphere has a Harry Potter theme without being too kid like. We have been back here several times and the service has always been wonderful. They do have some sandwich and salad options."}
{"text":"As much as I use YELP  for advice on great places to eat or have a wonderful cup of coffee I'm really bad about taking the time to write a review but that changes today as I hope to share with others my wonderful experience at Bad Owl Coffee. As a Las Vegas native I'm always looking for locally owned and operated small businesses to support. Upon entering the door I was immediately transported to the wizardly world of Harry Potter  so without ordering anything that was an automatic plus. I began taking pictures to show to my adult daughters who really LOVE anything Harry Potter. The very sweet young lady that helped me I must give 5 stars to her alone!! I explained to her it was my first time there she was patient, professionally and friendly. I ordered a Biscoff Latte which was 
D-LIGHTFUL!!!! I asked for my coffee in a mug because I love to see the artwork and my taste buds were so very happy the 1st cup was gone in minutes. I opted to order a second cup and a grilled cheese sandwich that I added prosciutto to and let me tell you the second cup was super cute and ever so yummy but the sandwich was pretty Amazing!!  I will be back and I hope this review will encourage those of you who are reading it to do the same!!

{"text":"A Harry Potter coffee shop. It's wanderful! I love everything about this place, except the drinks. Hence, the not so perfect rating.  After visiting the Harry Potter theme park in Orlando last year, I was going through butter beer withdrawals.  To be honest, the butter beer here hot/cold/blended is not the same. It's made inconsistently and they need to work on this. It's either too milky, shy on butterscotch, or sickly sweet (could not finish and tossed it!).  

I love lavender drinks and I can't say I'm a fan either. My drink was so distracting with the amount of lavender tea leaves present with every other sip. I had to spit it out every time I came across one. Please strain your tea better. 

The Black Forest latte had an overall good taste, but was heavy on the milk and diluted the cherry flavor. 

The almond latte just was boring and I wouldn't order it again. I did not like that at the end there was a glob of almonds at the bottom. 

Have you tried their baked goods here? Amazing! I absolutely love the coconut muffin. I must find out who bakes these. 

The staff is nice and I understand they are still working out the kinks. I had several drinks re-made due to lack of communication from cashier to barista. For example: I asked for blended and got iced. I ordered Black Forest latte and received Black iced tea. 

With mediocre drinks and long lines, I think it's best to come back when they are more experienced.

{"text":"Bad Owl Coffee is a coffee shop themed after \"Harry Potter\" its bound to tickle any Harry Potter fan to a frenzy after all they do have Butterbeer Lattes. 
The latte itself was pretty good it wasn't as sweet as I though it would be, and it had a Butterscotch creamy flavor.

Unfortunately, the rest of the food and beverage wasn't as fantasy themed as I hoped it would be. By no means does that diminish, the quality of the coffees they taste awesome.  
The almond latte, is made with real almonds and the Nutella Latte is chocolaty with a hint of roasted hazelnuts.  

Bad Owl Coffee also has an expansive tea menu, as well as, desserts, pastries and sandwiches I haven't tried any of the food yet but I couldn't pass up the desserts. 

The chocolate lava cake is so luscious and decadent easily one of the best desserts I've eaten. The cake is not made in house but they receive them fresh by a local company Terri Sue Cakes. 

The ambiance is decorated nicely, set up after the scene of Platform 9 3/4 train station. Also a cool statue of Hedwig the Owl and a stack Harry Potter Book collection. 
It's pleasant cafe environment to chat with friends.
The staff are nice people and deliver good service my only thing is when it's busy it can get disorganized. It's still a new shop, so I'm sure they'll work out the kinks."}
{"text":"What a fun little spot! Their menu is very original which is something I look for when going to a coffee house. We got the butter brew latte with coconut milk and the Nutella latte with 2 chicken pesto and mozzarella sandwiches. So good!! And the service was up to par. Alex (same as me :) ) was so nice and friendly and welcoming! Which again is something I look for when trying a new coffee house! Inside is cute and quant. They offer board and card games you could play while sitting at a table and their wifi is free. Overall this place was a great find. Bad owl coffee you just got yourself a new regular!!"}
{"text":"All I can say is wow! Best iced vanilla latte E V E R! And freshest shot of espresso E V E R! Loved this place definitely coming back!!"}
{"text":"2016 Yelp 100 Review Challenge -     22/100

First heard about this place through Facebook. I went a week or two after their soft opening... hopefully to avoid the long lines, but when we got there was a long line out the door. haha! DUH. Come on, Michelle. Definitely a good sign for them. Luckily, I was with my favorite people and we got to catch up on a few things. 

Anyways, I'm not a huge Harry Potter fan, but the friends I was with are. I was excited to try this place out because I love coffee and tea and I love businesses with a creative twist. 

When we finally got inside, the decor was amazing. Harry Potter theme was well executed, a spot for HP fans to pose for their social media photos. Even though I'm not a HP fan, I loved the decor. They also had fresh orchids by register, one of my favorite flowers. 

There were also bakery items and healthy snacks, bananas and fruit near the register. Nice touch, great for healthy foodies. 

I ordered the Lavender Latte, this one I was excited to try because after reading their menu online, I found out it's made with housemade lavender. As I ordered, I asked if there was any way to make it less sweet or no sugar as I was watching my sugar intake because of health reasons, borderline diabetes. The cashier had no idea how to answer the question. It seems that she was stressed out, couldn't handle the lines of people and just wanted her work day to be over. Nice one. Customer service could use some work here. I forgot to ask if they could just make it as a tea and not a latte. F-it I just settled for the Lavender Latte. 

It wasn't bad, but I had to sip it slowly. It was still sweet for my taste. Plus, they used Vitamin D whole milk (it has tons of sugar). I tried the Butterbeer Latte but it was my first time trying it so I can't compare to the real deal Butterbeer. My lavender didn't have any tea leaves in it, but my friend's drink did. I had no desire to finish mine, and I must have wasted half the latte. 

Disappointed with the drinks and service, my friends have went back several times and the drinks still need work, so I don't know if I'll be back again. It's a shame, because I really wanted to like this place."}
{"text":"We absolutely loved this spot. Coffee was UNREAL. Perfectly delicious. The vibe inside is very modern and upbeat. We will definitely be coming back when we visit Vegas."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I come here all the time and we love it!!! We are currently making our way through their menu. Their coffee is delicious and if you are hungry they have delicious pastries and sandwiches!  I don't drink coffee much, but when I do I go to BOC!!!"}
{"text":"As a David Lynch/Twin Peaks devotee, I came across this café only to find out it varied from a distinctive literary reference: Harry Potter. A book series that I find way too simple to read, which is not necessarily a bad aspect. Though, I would much rather use up that time to stimulate my mind with imploring in the works of founding figures of existentialism, medieval discourse on nature, what have you.

Alas, I digress, I had an okay sensory experience when ingesting my cappuccino. However, it was not anything too impressive in comparison to the ones I have had in Wicker Park, Chicago. The soy was nicely steamed, which resulted in a full, rich structure. Further, it gave the proper sweetness, instead of a simple flat taste as regular soy would.

An exposed brick wall, zany light fixtures, steel pipes, and Harry Potter-inspired decor throughout gave Bad Owl a funky and trendy atmosphere. Perhaps, I am only saying that because I have always been fond of the rustic industrial appeal. The employees were all lovable. I complimented their café's music compilation and it turns out that it was a personal soundtrack constructed by one of the staff members. I find indie rock cringeworthy and a tad trite now, but sipping coffee whilst jamming to Radiohead brings back memories to my youth years - when 'indie' had not fully lost its genuine meaning.

I cannot give this a proper review because I have not tried that many nourishments/beverages the menu has to offer. Overall, for the time being, I had a great experience and I find myself returning!

'til then, evanesco!

{"text":"I went in here yesterday afternoon, I believe this was my third time being here . I actually love this place and have never had a bad experience until yesterday . I went in with a friend and ordered there new pumpkin latte, I'm vegan so I asked the guy who took my order if I could substitute milk for almond milk, the guy who took my order was very rude, I know having to do something out of the normal order is so hard to do but I'm sorry ! Anyways he asked another worker if that was okay and the other worker said yes . I asked two times if the substitute milk was the only milk in the latte and he said yes, I'm sure he just didn't know the answer and was to lazy to ask . Fine, the other gentlemen who actually made my drink was very very kind, I didn't catch his name but he was awesome ! After I was done placing my order I stood where they make the drinks and the other guy who was making my drink asked me if I was lactose and tolerant because there is a pumpkin ingredient they use that has milk in it and he wanted to know if it was okay to use that ingredient and I answered that I am actually vegan and no it's not okay to use that ingredient, he then continued making my drink, and asked me how my day was going . Then gave me my drink and said \"here is your pumpkin latte veganised \" he truly turned my bad experience into a really great one ! Sad I didn't catch his name . & my latte was delicious !! Thank you to whoever you were to actually take the time to make sure my drink was exactly how I wanted it ."}

{"text":"Not much to it being a \"Harry Potter\" themed spot but the coffee is definitely like no other and the pastries are beyond delicious."}
{"text":"Great coffee wonderful service they also have baguettes. Love the different flavors of coffee they offer and the Harry Potter theme."}
{"text":"Harry Potter, Schmary Water!  I've been waiting and waiting to check this place out and what a let down! Like seriously a let down.  I wanted so badly to love this place as I loved the Harry Potrer series! Not only did I actually read the books, I actually enjoyed the movies too.

They have a cool them going on but that's where it ends. I had hoped for some of the Harry Potter music or even the movies playing in the background.  Nope!!! 

This place is just not organized.  I walked in and there was one guy in front of me. He'd ordered an Affogato and croissant.  It seemed like it took the cashier 10 minutes to work on his transaction that ended up declining! Not to be a total a-hole but it's a coffee shop and people have shit to do! I had to get back to work.  Why am I ranting? Well friendly cashier girl likes to bs.  She also decided to get his croissant and warm it up for the guy. I think that's nice but did she really have to stand there playing with her pretty long hair while it was heating? I don't know, maybe?  My point is why didn't she ring him up and take his payment?  She literally made us wait while she heated his order.  Then his card declined! Oh my!  Finally it's my turn.  I order my muffin and decaf latte.  Apparently it takes 3 male baristas to make one affogato!!! Yes, all 3 guys were working on making the guy before me's order.  Now I'm a little more annoyed but maybe scooping ice cream and making a shot of espresso is challenging.  I remain quiet because guess what?? I'm next!! Or so I thought! One of the 3 baristas hands me a drink but doesn't call me by my name.  Guess what??? They made the drink of the person after me! WTF!? I kindly mention it and am told that my latte takes longer to make than the butter beer latte or what the hell ever the gal had ordered after me.  Mind you I ordered a decaf latte. No special shots or half caf sorta thing.  

Ok let's move on to the good.  The latte was actually really good. It wasn't bitter at all and really smooth.  I was very happy with the flavor.  The muffin wasn't anything to write home about.  It was a muffin with toasted coconut.  

I would say the drink I had was above average.  They need to speed things up and stop with the 3 dudes making one persons order."}
{"text":"If you're a Harry Potter fan I suppose this is 'cool'. The baristas were friendly, but not the most helpful. It was my first time there and I did mention this to the girl. I didnt get a \"Try this, its our most popular\" or \"What tastes do you like?\" 

So I just got some toffeenut latte thing? It wasnt hot. And the pastry selection is seriously sad.

But, the place was extremely clean, cool deco, and did have a large amount of traffic in the 20 minutes I was there. There's usually a line whenever I have passed but me personally, would probably never wait in line for it."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed Bad Owl! Considering that Yelpers have clearly felt a certain kind of way about the wait, I will say 1st that my husband and I walked in at 1:44 and sat down at 1:56 with our coffee and tea. Also, yes it is a Harry Potter theme however NO, it's not overdone. I think that it's just enough for those to enjoy, who don't necessarily care for Harry Potter but enjoy a quality coffeehouse. It is also enough if you do like a Harry Potter, let's face it, if it was any more HP it would start to feel like a haunted house, less is more. The 4 is for the lack of a greet when we walked in, I think that it is very important to greet customers with a quick hello, it makes the wait painless! Overall, bravo Bad Owl!"}
{"text":"I solemnly swear that I am up to no good...

Who in Las Vegas hasn't seen photos an ads for Bad Owl coffee? 
For the last couple of months, we've been bombarded on Facebook with images, and \"coming soon\" messages.
Several friends have been here, and have given mixed reviews.  Some loved it, some hated it.  

I'm a huge Harry Potter fan.  I've read the books several times, and can practically recite the movies.  My husband loves the franchise as well, so it was a no brainer that we'd stop by at some point.  

I've wanted to come out since it opened, but the shop is on the other side of the planet, or so it seems.  
We found ourselves out here the other night, however, after picking up our roommate from work, and we decided to stop in. 

We were lucky enough to go fairly later in the evening, so there were no lines out the door.  The place was pretty busy though, with only a table or two that were open.  

I have to agree with some other reviewers here on the decor:  Well done. There are lots of Harry Potter references, but nothing too blatant, and its understated enough to come off as fun, and not hokey.  Signs for platform 9 3/4, with Hedwig and suitcases...tables with references like \"I must not tell lies\", the deathly hallows symbol, \"Wingardium Leviosa\" and more...I like it.

We ordered an iced butter brew, and a lavender white chocolate latte.

Prices aren't too bad at all for drinks.  Food seemed a tiny bit steep, but I can't really comment on price for quality, since we didn't eat anything.  Next time.  

I chatted with one of the kids working on the coffee and learned that they are being trained on latte art from Mothership Coffee.  That is cool.  Local shops helping each other instead of competing really makes me happy.   I asked the kid if he'd throw some latte art into my to go cup, since they usually only do it for the mugs.  He was a little self conscious about his ability, but he did really well.  I thought it was beautiful.  

As for the taste of the coffee: its nice.  Its much better than Starbucks, in my opinion.  The butter brew was good:  not as sweet as the Starbucks secret recipe.  My lavender mocha was good too.  I'd have liked a touch more lavender, but it was still really good.

Improvements?  Not many that won't be solved as they are open longer.  My only \"complaint\" about the place is that their menu is on a piece of paper on a clip board.  It would be nice to have some kind of large board behind the counter to look at instead of a clip board...but its possible that this is still in the works.  

Bad Owl has the potential to be a truly magical spot.

{"text":"This place has is located in the Trader Joe's--At Home Decor Superstore shopping plaza.  

Looking for place on Eastern to hangout and grab a good coffee and a bite to eat, come here! Bring your laptop and do what you need to do. 

You have some pretty good options for drinks. They are not open late..until 9pm during the week. But still come by drink some caffeine and get some work done.

The interior has a creative whimsical interior.  Nothing too crazy but kind of fun. 

Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I love the environment. It's laid back and the drinks are delicious. I'm hoping to try their food and their butter brew. I love this place."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have come here almost every week since it's opened - and have tried something new every time. We are obsessed. There's only been a couple of times where we have NOT had to wait in line, but it's always been worth the wait. The staff is so friendly, and energetic. 

If you're looking for some energy the nitro iced coffee will really REALLY get you going. We got the sea salt caramel.

Butter Brew latte is a MUST! 
My go-to is matcha anything! Matcha Affogato - with an add shot, matcha latte, matcha iced! 


I haven't found a tea that I like yet, but I hear rumors of an herbal tea!!"}
{"text":"Try their chilled nitro coffee. So smooth and delish."}
{"text":"Very charming and cozy eatery. Great food and drinks. Lavender latte and toasted almond latte were delicious. Easy parking. Great service. Harry Potter decor a plus, but coffee is the star."}
{"text":"This place is a joke, drinks that don't exist in the Coffee world. Drinks always come out at 130* degrees. Not worth coming here all the way here if you ain't patient. I like the wall decor"}
{"text":"I trekked all the way from Northtown to Hendo just so I could visit Bad Owl Coffee, which has been on my radar since forever. I had high expectations of this Harry Potter themed coffee shop, and expected to be spirited away with wizardry magicalness. Instead, I was mostly underwhelmed with the sparse Potter knick-knacks strewn about the coffee shop. The theme just wasn't executed as well as I had hoped. 

But let's not forget about the coffee! I went with a sea salt iced coffee, which was pretty good but comparable to a typical iced coffee offered by any other coffee shop. My husband went with the nitrogen cold brew, and said it was just OK. The macaroons we tried were great, but definitely on the pricey side for the minuscule size of these tasty treats. 

The only issue with the service regarded the Yelp check-in offer for 20% off iced drinks. The cashier said the offer wasn't valid for our order (even though I ordered an iced drink), but decided to honor the deal anyways. This wasn't really doing us a solid since the offer clearly stipulated it was applicable to iced drinks. Whatever. 

I'm glad I checked this off my to-do list, but I don't think Bad Owl warrants a return visit.

{"text":"I really? like this business and had a great experience?. I ordered the Chestnut Toffee Latte. The service was okay but the setting and ambiance? of the coffee?e shop give?s my review one added star. Please open up a location closer to UNLV on Maryland PKWY there seems to be lots of space for new businesses to grow and thrive. Especially a coffee? shop so that students can get together? socialize, study, or just need a cool vibe place to chill."}
{"text":"Made a quick stop here tonight. Very cute lil coffee place. The workers were very accommodating and customer service was on point! My friend didn't like her coffee because she thought it was supposed to be warm, so they gladly switched it for her. I ordered the Mandarin Silk tea with soy milk and honey! It was delish, it has a very light, vanilla flavor. A little honey makes it perfectly sweet. 

There wasn't as much Harry Potter decor as I thought there'd be...it's pretty simple, like you don't instantly think \"this is a Harry Potter themed place\" until you see Harry's owl. They just had a few quotes from the movies and a Platform 9 and 6/8...(Yes, 6/8..I wondered what was up with that, lol.) The workers also offered us Easter eggs with candy because of the holiday! :)"}
{"text":"Love the lattes here ! Really amazing customer service.  Loctaion is great. Perfect place to go with a friend for a meet."}
{"text":"Cutest place. Food looks scrumptious. Harry Potter fans will go crazy here. Wanted a hot green tea, but alas only blueberry or pomegranate. I'm too simple for this fancy schmantzy joint. Nitro coffee is the bomb. Very millennial generational spot."}
{"text":"I've only been here three times. 
1st time: It was on a Saturday and we arrived around 8:20pm, they close at 9pm. Everything was great! Food (we shared Belgian Waffle Buttercream), coffee (but not a big fan of the cold nitro brew, but loved the Roasted Almond Latte), the staff, the ambience... 
I was so happy and satisfied. I told my Husband that I want to come back the next day and bring my parents and our baby.
2nd time: Sunday (the next day), we got there around 6:40pm, not knowing that they close at 7pm on weekdays. So we all decided to just order to go. We came inside and both of them behind the counter had an uninviting look. I showed my parents the menu and ask them which one they want. It took them a bit to decide as they can barely read the worn out menu. Again, saw the faces of both people behind the counter with their unfriendly look. So we finally ordered our coffee and the Belgian Waffle Buttercream, but the guy told us that their kitchen closes 30 minutes prior to clossing. Devastated.... 
If they're not going to be happy to have customers close to their closing time, then why don't they just close the shop early then? Since they no longer have customers inside anyway. Also, seriously? Kitchen closes 30 minutes prior to closing? Then just close the whole shop 30 minutes early. Newsflash: do they know that coffee drinkers are not just teenagers and/or people under 30? My parents are 60+, they love to try new coffee flavors, that's why they came with us, so I'm sorry if it took awhile for my parents to order, being new customers and unfamiliar with the menu. Maybe if they invest on a better menu that can't get worn out easily. Even I, can barely read the tiny worn out letters on the menu.
3rd time: I insisted to come back here because I love the coffee and the food, even though it left a bad impression to my Husband, since we're moving to southwest LV area and it might take us a long time before we can come back. The staff were nicer this time but they can improve on being more upbeat (like, hey! Welcome! We love new business and we like everyone!) rather than dull (like hey.. welcome. I'm glad you're here but I don't care if you leave since we're already successful and we got a lot of regulars here already)."}
{"text":"One of the things this city is lacking is themed cafes. It's quite nice to be able to relax, enjoy a hot or cold drink and not be in a rush by choice while being in a different world - Hogwarts. Owl in a cage, Platform 9 3/4, Quidditch, lightning bolt scar...espresso patronum!

There's a few reasons why I stopped going to chain coffee shops: they butcher my name (I mean it's not unique like LaQueefa), DBs in line who think they have more important things to do than you do, and the drinks are boring and there's not enough caffeine to wake up from the snooze fest.

I prefer going here in the morning. There's always an empty table so, you can eat a quiche/ cake/ macaron/ pastry/ cookie/ tart and drink your beverage. The morning crew are friendlier and they take the time to make sure they don't put stuff you are sensitive/ allergic to in your drink. It's the little things like that that means a lot. Definitely great service! I've tried their quiche, strawberry tart, chocolate hazelnut cake, passion fruit jasmine tea, Nutella latte, and Nutella blended.

They also have butter beer latte, lavender, pistachio, Biscoff, matcha, etc. They sell shirts and tanks too. You pay for novelty...and for the afternoon crew to butcher your name in case you get a kick out of that."}
{"text":"Awesome local coffeehouse.  Great food and service.  Thanks for opening near my house.  I'll never move"}
{"text":"What an enchanting establishment this has ever been my pleasure of stumbling upon. The roasted almond latte was a ride that really took the snitch. And macaroon magical as it was tasty. Staff was extremely friendly especially the barista Austin. Will recommend to all my friends especially all those traveling through. I will be back for another enchanting time soon!"}
{"text":"The best coffee with excellent selections including an eclectic variety! The Harry Potter theme is fun for all and a nice way to connect to the books and movies without having to go to London to the British Museum exhibit. The baristas are experts and very friendly!! We love coming every time we visit."}
{"text":"Mediocre eclectic hipster spot, that's all this really is. At the price points you are offering the cafe items at - you should get a lot better quality and portioning. The pastries were dry and partly over cooked (locally sourced from a bakery I imagine). The seating is terrible and not good for kids - parents if you have little ones (toddler-infant), it will be difficult - and that's if you can find a seat. The staff was boring, unwelcoming and had barely any familiarity with menu items. All in all this is just another over-priced \"cafe\" taking advantage of the area average income and leaving out anything that could resemble the \"i plan to go here 3-4x a week scenario. 

Oh and flimsy plastic ware while my Avocado Toast barely fits on this slender cheese board - you're kidding right? 

Please do something to improve your business - I'm tired of giving large corporations like Starbucks my money but I won't pay for a less than pleasant experience."}
{"text":"LOVE. The theming here is super cute and very harry potter centric. We got a lavender white mocha and a coconut white mocha and both are SUPER yummy. Deffinately will be coming back again!"}
{"text":"I gave them 2 stars just because the idea is cool but their coffee is terrible. I got the iced pistachio latte, I tasted no coffee what so ever and an overwhelming amount of pistachio. My wife got the butter beer latte, couldn't taste the coffee at all in it either. The line was out the door. I get its brand new and popular but they should've prepared and hired more staff. Not to mention the cashier didn't know much about any of the drinks and had no recommendations."}
{"text":"A coffee house that cares for the craft. 10 mins from Anthem. Love the clever Harry Potter ambience."}
{"text":"Hearing that there was finally a Harry Potter themed coffee shop was incredibly exciting!! I went in there and the closest thing on the menu to anything harry potter was the butter brew which they were out of, of course! But they made me a close substitute ans it was delcious:) however, i hope that given time and a rise in revenue will broaden their horizons on the theme, it was kind of plain to me and theres so much you can do with the theme they chose. Overall, coffee was good but not something i cant get anywhere else and the theme was lacking just a bit but its still worth a shot to anyone who needs a coffee or is a harry potter fanatic like myself:)"}
{"text":"My go to place to take a break from the world. I always get the lavender latte and I've tried all the food items and AHHHMAZING!!!!!!!!!!! The customer service can definitely be amped up way more to make it feel more homey, most times it's short staffed but they Harry Potter theme and the vibe is absolutely perfect. Definitely a nice study, date, or just chill."}
{"text":"I look forward to stopping in here on my way to work. The lavender latte & butter croissant are the perfect start to my day. Don't think I can do Starbucks coffee ever again. 

Love the decor!"}
{"text":"Man is the coffee good here.  The ambiance is pretty cool too.  The coffee is a nice dark roast and very flavorful.  The barista was very helpful and nice.  He seemed to enjoy working there.  Definitely on the craft side, not a Starbucks.  You can spend time relaxing, doing work, and enjoying the eclectic nature of the shop."}
{"text":"Great staff and great coffee, just a little pricey is my only complaint. Try the pistachio latte it's amazing."}
{"text":"I admit, I came here for the aesthetic and possible Instagram worthy photo. Their staff was accommodating and didn't mind waiting on us to choose our drinks. Even helped us. It may sound stupid, but in a world of everyone rushing, it was nice to receive some patience. 

I settled on nostalgia and ordered the butter beer iced drink. 20% off iced drink with yelp check in! Best way for me to describe the taste would be an iced coffee with a hint of caramel. It tasted light on the taste buds and I would definitely love to return for more!"}
{"text":"I finally made my visit to Bad Owl Coffee.

Bad Owl Coffee opened up not too terribly long ago in Henderson as a Harry Potter themed coffee shop.  Naturally, I was intrigued.

There is a line.  Hoo boy, there is a line.  People love their Potter.  But to their credit, they kept the line moving continually.

The place is decked out with all things Hogwarts (and a TARDIS, but I'm not one to complain. My British pop culture love has many facets), and it's done very well.  The place does look nice.  The references are both numerous and subtle (loved the owl cage), so whether you're a fan of Harry Potter or just coffee in general, it works both ways.

After hearing so much about it, I decided to try the Butterbrew latte, and it was really good, and went well with the chocolate pastry that I had.

We only stayed a little bit, as seating is limited, and we wanted to be fair to the still growing line of coffee hopefuls, so the missus and I ate our breakfast, and went on our way.

We plan on going back in the near future.  It's in Henderson, so it's a bit of a drive for us, but I'd love to come back and check out the place without the crowds (if/when that eventually happens).  I really enjoyed the coffee, the service, and the overall atmosphere.  It's fandom tastefully done, and the nods make it a fun experience past your average coffee spot.

(I expect they will be nuts to visit when the next book and movie come out.)"}
{"text":"I had an Australian style hazelnut wet cappuccino (I think that's how he described it). It was honestly amazing.  After tip $6.00.  Not worth $6.00 and I felt like I was not welcoming or almost an annoyance as a first time patron."}
{"text":"Finally got to come here and try Bad Owl Coffee!  It is ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!   I had the Nutella Latte, mom ordered the Pistaschio Latte and my daughter ordered the Butterbrew Latte blended!   I am so glad we made it and will stop everytime we come through from Arizona!"}
{"text":"Visiting the area and a family member recommended this place. Love the atmosphere, quite and cozy, could have used more softer chairs but overall it's a lovely place. I ordered Roasted  Almond Latte Crushed almonds steamed into sweet milk with espresso. Loved it!"}
{"text":"Cute cafe with great calming ambience. It also serves delicious coffee and espresso drinks! 

I got the butter beer with a shot of espresso (it's a flavored milk steamer otherwise aka no espresso in the original drink) and it was pretty good! Butterscotch flavor I think, and milk was steamed well with nice quality layer of foam on top. Good fundamental speciality espresso drink making :) 

Also got an aero press for the Ethiopian blend which was super smooth and delicious. 

The almond croissant and other baked goods are from Bonjour. the almond croissant was gigantic but served with a fork and knife which I never needed for a croissant before but needed it for this one. 

I love the ambience of the cafe too. Free wifi, plenty of seating, good natural light so it's a perfect place to get some work done. 

The service was very friendly and knowledgable too. Gave me good recommendations on coffee and came by to check up on me while I was seated. 

Also the light Harry Potter theme was super cute. Not overdone and added a wonderfully cute touch. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I had such a great experience here. 

I've heard about this place from a family friend and tried to go twice the first time was unsuccessful they were closed. The second time I went they were open! As we walked in it was a very cool urban color theme with winks of Harry potter. I ordered the butterscotch iced coffee and all three of the macaroons. It was amazing!!! Id recommend this place to any one any age, it has something for you.

I cant wait to go back. I live on the opposite side of Vegas and the drive is well worth it!"}
{"text":"Overall, I really like this place. I've been here a few times & the food and coffee has all been pretty tasty. Coming from a huge Harry Potter fan/ nerd they could definitely do a little more with the decor- hopefully at some point they will. Try the Nutella latte & the cookie butter waffles! Both are extra delish."}
{"text":"These guys have potential but need to work on efficiency.   Not their fault that they underestimated their popularity and chose a terrible spot with insufficient parking but they make the experience worse.  I waited 20 minutes in line and then another 25 minutes to get my drink.  No coffee is worth this much of my time.  Nice people but no thank you!"}
{"text":"Am I too old for this?  Probably.   But, as I ponder this question while sipping on my Butter Beer Latte next to Hedwig on a table that reads Espresso Patronum, I realize I don't care one bit.  Excellent coffee.  Fun concept and the friendly staff.  I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time today & ordered the nitro cold brew coffee. So good! Love the vibe & decor. Very original. Can't wait to return to try more!!"}
{"text":"For sure, without a doubt the most AMAZING coffee shop I've ever been to! The service, the music, the drinks, the food, the entire atmosphere, everything is nearly perfect here. I'm a local(and yes indeed a Harry Potter fan) and find myself here nearly every week. Never had a bad experience. A bit pricy, but still, if you love great coffee(natural tasting, not artificial tasting) or teas, you have to try this place out! I promise you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Recent first visit at Bad Owl.  Great atmosphere, excellent lattes and delightful pastries to go with your coffee.  I ordred a roasted almond latte and found actual almond slivers at the bottom of my cup.  Sooooo delicious that I can't wait to go back and have another!!  Bad Owl is a local, independently-owned business and it's obvious right away that it is NOT a run-of-the-mill corporate coffee house.  Did I mention excellent service?  Yes, the service was indeed excellent!  Hope to have this gem in the neighborhood for years to come."}
{"text":"QUITE a lovely environment with dark woods and bricks, Harry Potter's Wizarding World style decor, a few games and books in the bookshelf. The menu options (food and beverage) are unique and delicious!  Sometimes things are sadly unavailable, but there's absolutely something else delicious to try in substitution~!!
The staff has been very polite and welcoming.  If you find yourself visiting at the particular hours when a man named Jake is working, he is the most knowledgeable and perfect barista!"}
{"text":"Best coffee I have had in a long time! The staff is friendly, the atmosphere is relaxing and different, I'm so glad I finally got to try this place!"}
{"text":"I went about an hour before closing and most of the tables were full. No line to wait in like a lot of the other reviews say on here, but that probably because I went so late. I ordered the iced lavender white mocha and it was good. Definitely different than anything I've ever tasted. Price is a little bit more than Starbucks but I think it's way better quality coffee. The place was decorated well with a Harry Potter theme. Not too over the top but enough to make a Harry Potter loved like myself enjoy it. I didn't try any pastries but they looked delicious. Wish they were open later for students like myself who are tired of going to 24hrs Starbucks and waiting for somewhere to sit. Definitely would come here again."}
{"text":"Heard about this place and was a bit intrigued... Well worth it ... The atmosphere was great ... The staff friendly... The butterbrew was sweet but delicious ..."}
{"text":"I love my coffee and was thrilled to read about Bad Owl Coffee in the Henderson View.  Hubby wanted the \"Kyoto -- Traditional Japanese iced coffee, brewed for over 16 hours\".  We even skipped our morning brew at home and waited until 8am for them to open shop.  Sadly, when we got to the counter, we were greeted with \"I'm so sorry, we ran out of Kyoto but can I get you something else?\"  Seriously?!  I mean... ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!!  You just opened!  The pastries display case was empty too... hmmm... 

By looking at the reviews -- looks like this place is always running out of one thing or another.  I get it if I'm going into a coffee shop late in the evening and everything is sold out but this is first thing in the morning!  We love to support small businesses, but this is Unbelievable & Unacceptable!  Help Us, Help You!  Carry products that you're advertising!  It's as simple as that, right?  :-(  

Maybe I shouldn't have waited until 8am for my caffeine fix... Bad Owl-- BAD!  :-(   SMH."}
{"text":"Coffee great. Atmosphere amazing! Employee not so great. I didn't feel very welcomed and for such a cool spot and theme you would think the employees would be more friendly. But it's a must see and try! If you haven't been yet you MUST go!"}
{"text":"I have to say, my friend told me this was a harry potter cafe and I am not a fan...so I automatically lowered my expectations a bit.  However once we got to this place, the only real complaint I had is that there is always a line! The atmosphere was relaxed and nice.  There are a few harry potter themed beverages as well as signs around but honestly it's not crazy ovet doing it on the harry potter motif. I had a delicious lavender latte here, multiple times now, as well as a mint mojito latte iced. I know it sounds weird but the espresso followed by a refreshing mint flavor was actually very good. Be prepared for sticker shock, pastries start at 5 bucks and go up from there. They didn't look awesome enough for me to waste  that kind of money! 

 The inside is very nicely decorated and spacious, but don't expect a table if you go during busy times. You may have to wait for one. The staff here is very friendly and knowledgeable from my experience,  I have noticed other people saying they are not so smart or opinionated,  but i thought they were fine. 

Overall I will definitely be back to try more options from this place and was glad we had stopped by in the first place.  Excellent brew, good selections and good atmosphere."}
{"text":"I just stop by to check and see this harry potter style themed cafe. I would say the ambiance is not perfect for those who like to study because when I went there it is busy and noisy. I ordered butterbeer infused with coffee,  it like it so far  Its like starbucks."}
{"text":"Reviewing as a first time guest. Service was fantastic. Coffee was delish and food was fresh and hot! 
Prices are high, however we came here for the experience. My daughter is a BIG potter fan and it was her bday today. The atmosphere was perfect and will definitely come back. 
The bad reviews I think are abit harsh on businesses like this. 
Be open minded, see the menu prices ahead of time and enjoy the surroundings. Good place for a Starbucks replacement. Thank u"}
{"text":"I love it here. The decor is great, each table as a Harry Potter theme. The pricing is incredible. Oh, and the products are fantastic! I tried the Spanish Latte the first time I went, the next day I had the Butter Beer latte without espresso and we tried the Jasmine blueberry tea. Overall a very pleasant experience."}
{"text":"Pretty hip place. If you are looking for a place out of the norm (Starbucks) this is the place. We ordered iced Nutella, and Butter Brew lattes. The Butter Brew taste like a Carmel macciato, mostly milk. The Nutella tasted like a iced mocha latte. Now on to the breakfast croissant... AMAZING! This buttery, flaky, fresh egg, and ham creation is so good. At first I thought, wow 8.99 is a little much for a breakfast croissant from a coffee shop. But let me tell you folks, this is worth it! It's completely fresh ingredients and you can tell! The cost for everything together plus tip, came to $38. A little more than what I usually like to spend on breakfast, but overall the experience was great. The employees we're very friendly as well."}
{"text":"As a tremendous Harry Potter fan, this coffee shop is literally a dream come true to be existing in Vegas! The whole theme is very unique - an intimate, modern coffee shop with a nice classy touch of Harry Potter decorations all around! My boyfriend and I went here on Valentine's Day & surprisingly it wasn't too busy, but we were a bit saddened by the fact that they already ran out of the Butter Beer Latte! But it was expected since it was their grand opening weekend. What I did like was the fact that they gave us a sample of the Kyoto Cold Brew & the Nitrogen Cold Brew before making our decision! 

We ended up ordering the Matcha Latte and the BF ordered the White Mocha Blend. Both were absolutely delicious & would highly recommend!

We live in Summerlin so the drive is pretty far but it sure is worth it! If only they could open a shop in Summerlin, I would definitely be there everyday! 

If you're a huge HP fan like me, then you'll feel absolutely at home at Bad Owl Coffee. Definitely 5/5! :)"}
{"text":"While Bad Owl Coffee has a cute Harry Potter themed gimmick going on there is nothing magic about this mediocre coffee bar. The wait was way too long for an ok coffee. Also, I tried to order the nitro cold brew, which should have been a quick pour. Fair enough they make the drinks in the order they are placed, but after waiting for them to make drinks for three other people I watched the baristas struggle with the nitro spouts for 10 minutes until I finally interrupted them and said I would have something else. At this point the four people behind me had got their drinks and two more received their complicated latte drinks before I finally received my average iced coffee. The barista was apologetic about the wait but I'm not impressed enough to come back. If you are not in a hurry or don't care about efficient service you might like this place."}
{"text":"I love this coffee shop.  It reminds me of my favorite one at home in Pittsburgh. Very unique space and awesome decor. A great place to get work done or to meet a friend for lunch. 
The lavender latte is my favorite and I also like the French press coffee. The sandwiches are good!"}
{"text":"This place has a really cool concept but it's kind of high priced for what you get. I would go again for the vibe but not for the products they offer."}
{"text":"Great coffee! Everything from breaks fast to lunch to drinks and even more beyond that! Great place!"}
{"text":"When I first heard of this place, I was excited. Harry Potter theme coffee shop?? I got to go!!

Well, it's pretty far from where we are (Summerlin), but we were close, so we finally got to stop by!

First impression, ooo! And then, as i kept looking around, it was very underwhelming. There's a cute spot with the platform 9 3/4 (but it was actually written as a 9 6/8 lol) with luggage and Hedwig sitting on top. And I'm the corner there's more suitcases with the Harry Potter book collection there.. But that's it!

If it were me..... I would have the coffee bar at the back of the shop, and have long long tables running the length of the restaurant. And chandeliers of different heights hanging from the ceiling as if they were floating.. But that's just me.

As for coffee, I ordered the sea salt ice coffee and it was just OK. Tasted watered down. Not a fan. 

I probably won't come back all this way to come here for the coffee, but its good to have experienced it."}
{"text":"The butter beer latte was very good (and something different)  but everything else seemed very sweet ...and the milk was a bit \"burned\" 

I would like to see a \"kids menu\" (with smaller drinks & hot coco and  some choc chip cookies 

The choc croissants had the littlest amount of choc I have ever seen. 

My \"hotter head\" loved the decor and says she wants a job ;)"}
{"text":"I made my first visit the other day to see what the all the hoot was about.  I know absolutely nothing about Harry Potter so the decor was lost on me.  I enjoyed a Spanish Latte albeit it was pretty sweet as was another drink that my friend ordered.  The most exciting thing is I plan to go back to try their cold brew and this shop fills a void as there was no independent coffee shops like this in the immediate area."}
{"text":"Good coffee, fun atmosphere, nice staff. Everything about it makes me want to come back and hang out more."}
{"text":"Wow, what a great place! I tried the Lavender Latte and ordered it in a mug and was so pleasantly surprised when it was brought to my table--a perfect rosetta poured by the barista, Luke. The milk was steamed just right: not too frothy and velvety smooth. The flavor of the lavender sort of reminded me of a dirty chai latte... aromatic but not overbearing or overly sweet. The atmosphere of the cafe was great and the whole staff was friendly and helpful even though it was a busy Saturday afternoon. Don't let the Harry Potter theme fool you-- Bad Owl Coffee means business. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Came to check out this place because I'm a Harry Potter fan. It's new on the map so it was a bit busy and seemed like a lot of newbies like ourselves. Very cute decor and good amount of space to hang out. 

But unfortunately what won't make me return was that I didn't care for the selection of food items and my almond latte was luke warm at best. So was my husbands coconut latte. Also which I didn't care too much for the taste."}
{"text":"Excellent coffee English toffee latte is my favorite very consistent tastes greats every time."}
{"text":"This place is so great. Just be prepared to wait. The baristas are quick, but this place is busy for a reason! Great coffee and great service! The atmosphere is terrific too!"}
{"text":"What a cute coffee shop! Harry Potter themed and also has butterbrew lattes! (Espresso additional $) Really enjoyed the butterbrew latte. I haven't had butterbeer (not really beer) since the first time I've tried it during the grand opening of the Harry Potter themed park in Orlando, years ago!"}
{"text":"Awesome place and great coffee! Feels like a little hidden secret. I'm not a Harry Potter fan but I'm sure people that are love it even more. If you are in the area and need some coffee stop in. I got the biscoff latte, it was a great pick me up feel like it could of been a little sweeter though. This is for fans of real coffee not watered down flavorless stuff. I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Cool spot with a Harry Potter theme. Had the Nutella Banana Waffles & a nitro cold brew. Workers were friendly and the shop was clean, modern, and quiet."}
{"text":"This place rocks!! Great service and great coffee!! I will come back here again and again. Nice ambience"}
{"text":"When we walked in there were 5 people in line in front of us. After waiting 25 minutes we finally reached the counter where we were told it would be 20-30 minutes to get our coffee. When I asked why the long wait I got a sigh and an eye roll followed by being told that they were really busy. Of the 5 people behind the counter, one was making coffee and the other were standing around doing nothing.  I have no problem waiting at a place that is really busy. I start to get annoyed when I'm waiting and the employees are standing around doing nothing.  I won't come back when you are rude about it."}
{"text":"Was actually turned off when I realized it was a Harry Potter-themed cafe, but was then informed by a local that it was a great place for a cold brew (not an easy thing to find in Vegas, surprisingly). I didn't fan girl out over the decor or dedication to the theme, but I did fan girl out over their sea salt cold brew! I love me some sea salt foam!"}
{"text":"Cute coffeeshop, good espresso (not quite up to Desert Winds level, but solid), friendly staff. Some of the customers are a bit on the jovial side. The music isnt too loud or offensive, and it is a pretty good place to study."}
{"text":"Chocolate coconut macaroon was so good!! The coffee beans used here taste very high quality (not a burnt taste) Lots of amazing flavor choices including white chocolate lavender, pistachio and almond with ground almonds in it yum!!! Staff were knowledgeable and service was great (quick and friendly). Love this place"}
{"text":"What attracted me to this place first was the name and logo.  I love all things owl!

After doing some light research I see that's it's a Harry Potter themed place.  Being a \"light\" Potter fan myself, I've become even more intrigued.  

I check out the menu, hmm.... interesting...

I must say it was a great idea to come in.  It's decorated nicely.  Like a dark comfy cafe.  The theme is subtle enough that you may not even notice if you're not in the know.

The coffee was great.  Probably the best lavender latte I've had as of late.  I ALWAYS order a lavender latte if it's on the menu.

The everything avocado toast was great as well.  It was beautiful and tasty.  Rich but served with a lime to cut that richness.  Toast, toasted perfectly.  

The service was good.  Accommodating and friendly.  The food came out a little slow but everyone in front of me ordered food so... 

I just wish this place was closer to where I live.  Well worth the trek though."}
{"text":"This is so cute and quaint. I definitely recommend this place if you're looking for good coffee, but don't want to deal with loud environments. Perfect place to study, relax, or even hang out with friends. The employees here are so friendly, and the entire establishment is beautiful. Felt like I was really in HP World."}
{"text":"I've been here two times already, first time it wasn't so bad, tried the Lavender Latte and it was good the first time, the second time I went and got the same thing it wasn't the same. I've worked in coffee for 10 years, I love it and I cherish coffee and tea, I love the food and beverage industry. But with a lot of coffee joints, the one thing that seems to stand out the most is consistency. Of course, this place is new so of course I'm going to give it a few tries! I actually like where this coffee establishment is located, let alone they finally put a local coffee shop close to home instead of traveling into the worst construction areas! I do have to say the blended Nutella beverage is good, super smooth!! 

Of course I'm going to come back and give this place a few more tries! Hey! Everyone has their good and bad days, it's what makes us human!!"}
{"text":"Love this new coffee spot! Lots to choose from. Great customer service. Yummy pastries and I've had the butter brew latte and Nutella latte so far- very pleased"}
{"text":"A café + Harry Potter
Do I have to keep elaborating? This place is adorable! Yes, total fan service but I can't help it.
My experience: I ordered the ButterBrew (hot) and friend ordered one of their teas (iced). My friend asked for it sweetened but we were not prepared for it to be that sweet! She asked the barista if it would be ok to try it unsweetened and they whipped her up one no problem. (Thanks guys)! My drink was awesome! Hers I didn't care for sweet or unsweetened but lavender is a weird flavor for me."}
{"text":"This is a cute little trendy place with great Decour. I have not had their food but have had the coffee many many times. It is so much better than Dunkin' Donuts or Starbucks. This is really good true coffee with great flavor.  I like the atmosphere here too."}
{"text":"We decided to take our 3 kids who all adore Harry Potter to the Bad Owl Cafe. It was cute and had nice touches from the books and movies. The kids loved pointing out all the decor and reading the quotes. The kids mentioned they wished they played Harry Potter music mixed in with the other music choices. The staff is very friendly and fast. Before we finished ordering 4 drinks my first order of the Biscoff latte was ready. It was very yummy. Slightly Sweet and smooth.  My husband got the iced Butter Brew..omg... delicious!! And perfect for kiddos with no espresso unless you ask for it to be added. My son got the decaf Iced Coconut White Mocha which was sweet and strong on the espresso side and daughter got the decaf Lavender Iced Latte. It was good but I couldn't taste the lavender at all. My little guy gobbled up his blueberry pastry and I didn't even get a taste but it looked scrumptious. All in all it was pretty good. We will be back again."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place, I love Harry Potter so much! But it's too crowded to be a chill, relaxing  coffee shop to hang out in. To me the coffee is mediocre.

What I didn't like much was the service.. 
I came here with my younger brothers and they don't drink coffee. My 8 year old orders a butterbeer with just milk and I swore it had coffee.. Tasted like it and it was brown. I asked the barista and cashier 3 times and they kept saying.. No it doesn't have coffee. They finally made me a new one they said \"just in case\" and the new drink's color was white! The first one they gave us was brown, they saw it too because you put the lid.. I really didn't appreciate them lying about it the first place, especially when I asked multiple times if they're sure there's no coffee.. Obviously they knew because the color was different . The butterbeer flavoring is clear and it's just milk base. My brother has ADD and it was 8pm.. No way I was giving that kid some coffee. 

Either way, it's not a coffee place I'll go to unless my friends from out of state want to go visit. It's a cute place with pastries and a good amount of flavored coffee."}
{"text":"First time I went there was a couple of weeks ago...the decaf cappuccino was fabulous!!! My only complaint is it is pretty expensive, but so is Starbucks.  I definitely go back for another cappuccino!"}
{"text":"Best lavender latte in the city. Lattes are strong and sweet. I love strong but not burned, creamy and sweet lattes. I can taste the lavender. I prefer my lattes on the sweeter and more flavored side. Most places don't put enough flavor in their lattes, but this one is the perfect mix.Staff is super nice. Service is fast. Salted caramel macaron was okay."}
{"text":"So my review is not so much a coffee review -- however here it goes...

My Mom comes to visit probably 4 times a year and this is here Favorite coffee spot! 

So as it was Mother's Day on Sunday and her birthday was on Saturday I decided to go in and get her her favorite coffee! (I'm Late every year)

I wasn't sure if they sold bags of whole bean coffee, but I walked in anyways! It was Saturday morning about 10:30am and the place was a buzz and the parking lot was busy busy busy! Which is always a good sign! 

Walked in and there was a line to the door... so I thought I'd walk in and scan the surrounding shelves.... no coffee... so I waited back in line.

Glad I did because right near the register near the menus Was a little sign that gave me info on coffee beans whole or ground and bag size info plus the various options to purchase!  Yay!!!! 

I ended up buying 3 bags of whole bean coffee all different selections... so Mom could enjoy all of them and then I purchased the cutest espresso cup and saucer set! Was adorable! Perfect for her!!

The service was great and super friendly! 

Maybe next time I'll stop by for a coffee and a bite to eat... cause the plates of food whizzing by while I was in line looked Delicious!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely must see for Harry Potter fans of all ages. Try the Butter Brew latte if you're looking for a non coffee option. I loved the Spanish Latte, it was creamy and really tasty. Desserts were amazing, we tried the almond croissant and strawberry tart. So delish! There was a line out the door when I arrived at 10:30 this morning and it never died down. Not many tables but they move people through at a good pace so something opens up right when you need it. Definitely going to visit again."}
{"text":"Simply Amazing. Very kind owners. Very delicious food. My personal favorite is the Nutella Donut Holes  Need I say more?"}
{"text":"Nice and clean location. Ordered the Nutella Frappe. I was dying to check this place out for awhile considering there was such a huge hype about it being Harry Potter themed. I still have my personal favorite coffee shop I prefer to go. I voted 4 stars because they didn't have a big selection."}
{"text":"Met up with some friends here after a Harry Potter convention in Vegas. 

The cafe is also Harry Potter themed, which is awesome! 

They have themed food and drinks, Harry Potter books, a platform 9 3/4 (although for legal reasons theirs says 9 6/8), Harry Potter quotes and related things on the tables, and a sign in the back pointing to all the different places in the books. 

It's a relatively small cafe, but really nice to just hang out in and talk over coffee. 

I had the sea salt iced coffee. It was a bit disappointing because I didn't taste any sea saltiness or caramel for that matter. I did taste the butter brews and those were amazing. Also had the Charmingly Pesto sandwich, which was surprisingly good albeit a bit expensive. 

It did get quite crowded here when we came and there is only one register, which seems like a bit of an issue. They should really take drink orders in advance of the register like they do at Starbucks. 

Overall though I'd definitely recommend this place to Harry Potter fans and mildly interested coffee fans. ;)"}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place so much but it was a total let down. I brought in my Harry Potter loving kiddos for a butter beer. I had been hearing advertisements and people talking about the fun Harry Potter coffee house and how you could get butter beer there. We waited too long for help, I didn't see butter beer listed on the menu so I asked the employee if they did serve it. He said he wasn't sure but he could make something up. I was confused but happy to give it a shot. $4 per drink later, not a clean table anywhere, and a half an hour wait when my kids were brought cups of milk with ICE and butterscotch syrup. We did go in August, but come on, ICE in Milk with syrup?!?!?! Totally not even close to butter beer. If you are going to market yourself towards a Harry Potter crowd there had better be some training with employees and at least a normal attempt at a butterbeer."}
{"text":"Went here last weekend.  Staff was wonderful.  They were really accommodating especially since we arrived right before closing time.  The cafe is very cutely staged (there was a doctor who reference that made this whovian's day).  We got iced butterbeers and they were good and comparable to universal studios which I just had the previous week.  Honestly tons of props to the staff.  They made me want to come back and tell all my friends and family to go."}
{"text":"Allllllllways.

What a little treat to pop into Bad Owl Coffee. I love Harry Potter and the references and decor are subtle enough that you could bring your muggle friends and they might be none the wiser! 

For how intimate the space is, it doesn't feel cramped when it's busy. It's packed with students studying and folks working remote (like me!). The counter is easy to find and the staff was really nice.

I ordered their cold brew which I wasn't a fan of. It was really bitter like it had steeped for too long. I normally drink it black but I asked the gentleman behind the bar for some creamer and he was very accommodating. They rotate the beans for this, so perhaps I might like it on another visit. Noted for next time. My colleague ordered the Butter Brew latte but added a shot of espresso. It's a specialty drink but more like a steamer since it's steamed milk with butterscotch. It was sweet, delicious, but not my cup of coffee.

We split the Charmingly Pesto sandwich and it was a hit for us both. Lots of flavor, super meaty, well put together. I acciod that right into my belly."}
{"text":"Coffee was good, and service was quick. However, the amount of people in there made it uncomfortable to move around or enjoy the atmosphere. I understand the business couldn't help with the amount of people, but I wish there was outside seating, or the seating arrangements somehow where configured better. The people in line kept brushing past our table. I felt like every so often I had to scoot in to accommodate the crowd."}
{"text":"Coolest coffee shop everrrrrrrr!!!!! 

My husband thought the names of the coffees weren't \"Harry potter\" enough so he suggested a few to our barista on our 2nd visit here. Very embarrassing lol. Voldermocha was probably his best one. He also thought it would be funny to put our coffee/waffle under the names Harry, Potter, and Hermione. 

On our first visit, I got the Kyoto cold brew coffee and my husband got the nitrogen iced coffee. As we sat in this cool place drinking our coffee, we decided to also get the matcha waffle to go. 

I enjoyed my husband nitrogen iced coffee more than the Kyoto cold brew I had ordered on our first visit so when we went back a 2nd time (in like 3 days), i ordered the nitrogen coffee which even LOOKS cool, almost looks like a Guinness! 

My husband had a mocha this time (hence why he asked for a \"Voldermocha\") and we also ordered the red velvet waffle to share. Our son ate all the ice  cream pretty quickly before he got started on the waffles, which were delicious! I think I preferred the matcha one, only because it was a little different than your normal waffle. Both were def good tho, nothing disappointed us here. 

Service was great, ambiance of this shop was awesome, and the food and coffee were delicious. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Okayyy.... I've been to this shop a few times now. I have had the Butter Brew Latte hot and iced. It's a 10 out of 10! 
Second drink I tried was the Lavendar Latte. Initially you taste coffee/espresso and then as the drink cools the Lavendar comes through. It's the perfect combo of coffee-lavendar. Want the Lavendar to come through even stronger? Cut out the espresso or add Lavendar. Simple. 10 out of 10. 
As for my FAVORITE drink: the Pistachio Latte!!!! Holy smokes this drink is delicious.  It smells like a sweet desert. It's so aromatic. I wish I could capture the smell in a candle. ((((Heaven)))) 

Harry Potter Fan, Dr. Who Fan or not You have to check this place out. Their menu will have something that you'll like/love. 

Lastly, their desserts and pasteries are to die for. The macaroons, chocolate croissants, chocolate swirl croissant and the almond croissant are AmaZing. Fresh daily!!!! 
Give this place a try! You'll return. :) 
To the staff- you guys rock! Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"Came here for Mother's Day.. Line was long.. had the Coconut Blended Coffee.. Yummy .. A little pricey, but worth it.. I have been back several times for just that Coconut Coffee and the Bear Claw..I wish it was a little closer.. Going there is worth the drive & the wait, When I want to treat myself.."}
{"text":"When I saw that there was a Harry Potter-themed coffee shop in Las Vegas, I made sure to check it out the next time I found myself in the area.

They have a great check in offer: 20% off an iced drink. After the Las Vegas heat that I had endured all weekend, an iced drink was very welcome. I ordered the Lychee Cream Pop (a new menu item), which is like an Italian cream soda with puréed lychees. It was good, but the cup wasn't filled up all the way. There was about an inch of room at the top. It was not enough drink for $4.40.

I also ordered the Wizard Meltdown sandwich (another new menu item) with the mixed greens. The sandwich is a cheddar, mozzarella, and parmesan grilled cheese with tomato and guacamole. It was also good, but not very hot. There was still cheese that hadn't melted, so they happily heated it more for me. The mixed greens were fresh and crisp, and included plenty of arugula, which I love. It only comes with balsamic dressing, which was very good, but I was craving ranch. Overall, I don't know if it was worth the $9.25.

All of the employees were friendly. They happily discussed what traffic I might hit on my way home and wished me safe travels."}
{"text":"I'm rarely in Henderson, so when I find myself with an extra hour and already this far from my side of town, I figured I'd try a new coffee shop :)

As far as Harry Potter goes, this place is fun yet understated. The decor is just HP enough to get fans what they want but without being super overt and feeling cheesy. Also, the \"coffeehouse music\" is strong here, with mellow Coldplay, Kings of Leon, and acoustic covers of 80's love songs....

Otherwise, this is just like any other coffee place. Will say they have a good hot tea selection and if I had been staying to study I would have made use of that. Their iced tea was only OK and while they have some pastries, food options are limited. 

Overall, this is a 3.5 star but I'll bump it up for the ambiance. Service was friendly :)"}
{"text":"I was not impressed went in expecting Harry Potter it was a little bit but not crazy over the top. I ordered the butter brew latte I was not impressed with the coffee at all. We did not try the pastry or other menu offerings but not impressed with coffee at all."}
{"text":"The. The2mw is cute. Dr Who and Harry Potter I believe. Are they related? Customer service is awesome. The coffee isn't so much. I had to go bsck a second time to check it out once more."}
{"text":"Great choice instead of iHop! Coming to Vegas so oftenly from Laughlin we look for new places and this one came to mind and we were so happy with our decision. It was an awesome themed place and definitely a must see for all wizards and even muggle fans of Harry Potter!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite stops when shopping on Eastern. They have a creative menu, excellent coffee, and a cool vibe."}
{"text":"Iced Coconut White Mocha Coffee with almond milk was so good. It's kind of on the expensive side, so make sure you check-in for their 20% off coupon! 

+ Friendly service
+ Quick turnaround
+ Awesome decor 
+ Delicious coffee 
- Expensive 

We got in and left within a few minutes. If you're ever in the area, check out this Harry Potter-themed coffee shop! The decorations were pleasing too."}
{"text":"A friend of mine took me there for a coffee a couple of days ago. What a great place! We got some almond cappuccino! It was huge, very pretty and smelled so good! I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"I don't know how I found this place on Yelp, but I'm so glad I did because I am a bigtime Harry Potter fan. I bookmarked it and insisted that my husband and I get our coffee here during our next visit. We found ourselves there on a Saturday morning around 9:30am and it wasn't too crowded. 

I was overwhelmed by the sheer options of lattes and other warm beverages. Yelp was offering a 20% discount for checking in on iced lattes so I decided to do an iced latte to help me narrow down my choices, but it didn't help much. My husband ordered a hot coconut latte and he loved it!!! It's hard to impress this man with much but he thought his latte was excellent. We also shared the croissant breakfast sandwich and we both liked that as well. 

I loved the subtle homage this place pays to Harry Potter. It's a cool place that both kids and adults can enjoy. I wish we had a place like this closer to where we live."}
{"text":"This place is very cute and a must-see for any Harry Potter fan. it's small and crowded but the decor is perfectly suited with cool accents from the stories. The drinks are delicious and the food? Wow. I had the SIRIUSLY PROSCIUTTO and it was super delicious. I definitely want to come back to try other tasty offerings, but first things first and my favorite character Sirius Black sandwich had to happen."}
{"text":"I have been here twice. The first time when they first opened and I waited 25 mins for a mojito iced latte and a butterbean latte. I couldn't decide and got both......it was good enough to come back!

Fast forward a year later this place is still booming and now they are offering food!!! I was so excited and so let down :(  coffee is still amazing! But the food is nothing impressive. I ordered the waffle, it was super well done and super crispy. Looked better than it tasted. 

Also, random, but the lids don't fit on their cups and people were accidentally spilling as they were picking up their coffees.

Also-they do have a current Groupon 6$ for 10$"}
{"text":"This place is my new favorite coffee shop! The ambiance is very relaxed and casual while the mood is fun and fantastically themed. For all the Harry Potter fans out there (such as myself) this is a must visit place! The ButterBeer Latte was perfectly blended, and it got to me quick! The staff are adorable and friendly (and didn't judge when I had my geek out moment)! The Blueberry Tea was delicious and came in the cutest Tea pot whit little Tea cups as well. Not only was it beautiful but it included a tiny candle underneath to keep it warm for the duration of our visit. Bad Owl Coffee is utterly amazing and I WILL be back often!"}
