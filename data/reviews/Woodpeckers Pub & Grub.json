{"text":"Didn't like their pizza to begin with but my wife did so she ordered from them again. Went to pick it up and found out they charge an extra dollar for cc, had they told my wife over the phone I would have said cancel it. Picked it up anyway, got it home and the one pizza was wrong. My wife took it back and when she got home we had it next to the other large we ordered. Now either it was a medium or a very small large. My wife now says she is with me in not ordering from them again."}
{"text":"To start off, I haven't been here in almost 4 years.  The place still looks the same. When you walk in it smells like beer, desperation, and cigarettes. On the other hand food was good. I had a Rachel like sandwich called \"the woodpecker\". Came on a hoagie bun with a decent amount of fries. 

Bottom line food is good, I just don't appreciate some of the staff walking around smoking like crack addicts. It's one thing if you go and do it out of site. But when you're wiping a table down for the next customer to dine at with a rag in one hand and cigarette in the other it's a little disgusting."}
{"text":"There was only 12 people in the place & it took 45 minutes to get a sandwich & an hour for an appitizer. This is the 2nd time this has happened to us. Don't think we will be returning. Hire a good cook!"}
{"text":"The worst atmosphere of any bar around. Full of bros n wankstas. Can't get a beer here without getting mean mugged by some 20 something loser trying to prove he doesnt have a baby carrot."}
{"text":"It was really good! I got a steak salad and it was huge and delicious! The only thing I didn't like was the smoking"}
{"text":"Love Woodpeckers. Great wings!  Reasonable prices. I personally like the laid back atmosphere. I find it to be relaxing on a Friday night after a long workweek to come and unwind."}
{"text":"There are lots of things to like about Woodpecker's:

1)  MC friendly, good ride destination for a summer evening.  Love getting to sit outside on their roomy elevated patio.
2)  Complete bar that is very \"current\" on selection
3)  Sandwiches are really great - love the different breads
4)  Nice starter selection, deep fried pickle wedges and green beans...  YUM
5)  Clean restrooms

I was the only non-sandwich of the night.  There were some lovely sandwiches served:  Philly Cheesesteak, Fish, and lots of burgers (which they will only serve well-done).  Clearly salads are NOT their thing.  Next time I'm in Rome, I'll get a sandwich!

Service was pleasant, but vague.  Yes... um... just...  well, vague."}
{"text":"This review is based on the food because I did not eat inside. This is the closest restaurant to the place I traveled to for work this week.  So we ordered take-out, and it was definitely a great meal.  The cheeseburger was large, flavorful, and juicy while still being well done.  It was on a ciabatta roll, which was not overly chewy as in sometimes the case.  The fries were hand cut and crisp.  Will I order from here again?  Absolutely, and so should you. I hope to find out what else they offer.  It may not look like much from the outside, and who knows about the inside, but the food was excellent."}
{"text":"Good place to go to drink on the weekends. It is a smoking bar. Usually have a dj on the weekends. The crowd in there can be a little shakey sometimes. I've seen multiply fights in this bar before."}
{"text":"First time at this place. Food was fantastic. Burgers are delicious. Well done and juicy. Fries and wings delicious too. Loved the diversity of the crowd. People from all walks of life. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"I had pizza & wings.  Wings were very good.  I think the bartender called them \"Inferno\" flavor.  The pizza was good too, which is surprising since it's kind of a roadhouse style dive.  Just goes to show that local businesses can still put out quality food.  It's a smoking bar, but thankfully no one was smoking so I didn't leave smelling like an ash tray.  I'd definitely go back."}
{"text":"Probably the best \"Bar Food\" in the area.  Love the wings and sandwiches.

My biggest complaint is the smoking.  If this place stopped catering to smokers, their business would increase 10 fold. The only time we eat \"in\" is summertime and we sit outside.  Any other time we take out.

They really should reconsider their smoking policy."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of chicken wings. This sports bar and restaurant is #1 in the AK Valley if that's you're thing. The craft beer selection has been improving and they have a decent selection of draft beer at reasonable prices. We probably average eating here once a month. Good atmosphere, newly remodeled, clean restrooms, lots of televisions and they have DJ's and live music on the weekends (The only down side here is smoking is allowed but they have a great ventilation system). I was able to tour the kitchen here when it first opened and it was very clean and organized.( all systems were in place for food safety). Service is always great, the wings are always perfect and fries are fresh hand cut. Woodpecker's is located right beside the Penn State New Kensington campus. Overall a great sports bar for the location.
