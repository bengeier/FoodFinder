{"text":"What can I say...the beer is flowing at Helio Basin Brewing Co. My favorite is the Robust Porter. 
I order a beer-braised pork belly taco. OMG!!! The Robust Porter with the beer-braised pork belly complimented each other very well. This is one place I will definitly will be coming back. 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Like this place and the owner. But, when I am told about my \"mouth\" and offending customers. 

As a neighborhood patron who spends money and tips, I won't be back. It's a brewery and if you are that offended by language there are more things in life to be offended about like...the state of our educational system, the fact we don't care and throw everything away than swear words or fingers. 

It's an insult that the owner had to have a \"talk\" with me and I won't support this brewery. It's large enough if you get offended move or go elsewhere. I spent many times there and I have other places I can go without that nonsense and better food 3 miles down the street and a patio."}
{"text":"This really hurts to write such a scathing review, but sometimes an honest opinion needs to be put out there. I enjoy visiting all of the fine breweries that have opened in the valley over the recent years. Most are good, some are truly great, while a few are just plain awful. I typically give a new place a couple of months to be open before I stop in so that they can work those initial kinks out. I believe they opened in April/May. I have been here twice; once a few weeks ago on a Friday and the other night before heading to a show at The Rebel Lounge.

Let me begin with the highlights:

DÃ©cor: 3.5 A very nice wide open space with a big bar and  large windows that give a look into the brewery. A very nice vintage vibe that is comfortable and inviting. Like others have said here, the stools leave a lot to be desired. 

The beers: 2.5 Nothing too exciting here. The IPA is solid, but just pretty typical. The Summer Ale was OK. The Milk Stout was very good. And I have not had the Scottish Ale that everyone is raving about because I am not a big fan of the style. My additional wish, besides wanting them to improve on the quality, is to increase the number of selections. They had more guest taps than their own made beers. You're a brewery, act like one.

The food: 4 Now I know several ppl have complained about the limited menu, the lack of a kitchen and the pricing of the items, but what ppl need to understand is that they are a brewery, not a culinary destination. Some breweries don't even serve food. I actually enjoyed the charcuterie selection and also felt that the pricing wasn't that unfair. Most places that serve these types of boards offer predetermined items on a few items. Helton provides a sushi type menu where you can select the items and assemble your own board. Everything is sliced, weighed and assembled within view of the bar. All the meats and cheeses were fresh and of great quality. 

Service: 1 When I was here a few weeks ago, it was fairly busy and I found a seat at the bar. 5 minutes to get a menu, another 5 to asked what I wanted, 10 minutes to get a beer in front of me, sat with an empty glass for another 15 miutes....see a trend here? My tender was short on conversation and seemed a little put out to be bothered to bring me another beer. The other night was much better. I sat at one of the long tables away form the bar. I didn't get any food, but my tender was very attentive with good conversation skills. She was quick to take my order and had excellent follow up when my glass was near empty. It was also dead at 6 o'clock on a Friday night, so I guess that could say a lot. Typically this type of service would render a 3 with me except for one little thing. On both visits I had items added to my tab that I did not order. Now, I can excuse the one on my visit a few weeks ago seeing as they were pretty slammed and could have very easily been an oversight. The other night, not so much. It was dead and there was an extra beer onmy tab that I did not order. My server apologized SEVERAL times, which made the entire thing not seem right. I'm not saying they are doing this intentionally....but I kind of am. Shady to say the least. I just wonder how many other ppl notice and say something.

Other MISC stuff: -1  I make a point not to grade location, parking, etc. These places make the best of what they can after making their product. One thing I will point out from my most recent visit was the owner consuming multiple beers behind the bar and in view of the customers. I observed at least 3 pints consumed while I was there for nearly 2 hours. I'm not saying this is wrong, but that's a lot to consume while on premises. The least he could have done was come out and mingle with his paying customers and get a vibe and some feedback. 

11 points, minus 1= 10/4 catagories=2.5
I'll round up to 3 in hopes that they get their shit together and address the glaring deficiencies. I'll be back, but it won't be for quite a while. Would I recommend someone to visit Helton right now? No way. Take your money and go the extra 1.5 miles to Wren House Brewing. They don't have food, but their beers  and service are far superior and they won't try to get you to pay for something that you didn't order."}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere.  I feel at ease and comfortable.  We sat around the bar and enjoyed talking with other customers.  The server was friendly and chatted just enough to help us feel welcome and informed about the beers.  The Cuban sandwich was excellent and was a perfect pairing for the beer choice.  Thanks!  We will be back again."}
{"text":"There was a man standing right next to our table who was showing people around and then just stood there next to us talking to them. It was really awkward and made for a poor dining experience.  Not sure if he was the owner?  But they don't seem to cater to customers. The decor is sparse and every table is high with high stools to sit on not very comfortable.  Everything else was just ok. I don't think there's anything particularly special about this place that I'll ever be back"}
{"text":"Great vibe, great beers, great cheese & charcuterie and great music! What more could you want from a neighborhood brewery that you can walk too?  Welcome to the neighborhood Helton Brewing!!! It's about damn time!!!"}
{"text":"I threw a retirement party for my husband last Saturday at Helton Brewery and what a fantastic venue this was!  I wanted a memorable time for my husband and Helton was more than exceeded my expectations. I called around trying to find a venue but everything was so expensive and not very accommodating unless you had a lot of money to spend.

Alyssa the GM and the staff at Helton could not have been more attentive to my needs. From the first contact on the phone making arrangements to the hugs goodbye. I was so impressed with this venue the ease of accommodating our group and the fun atmosphere.  The food was fantastic the beer was top notch and Brian the owner was so very nice to our group, he even offered and hosted a tour of his brewery, AWESOME!!!  Now that was a bonus!

Helton is a wonderful place to have a gathering no matter what type.  The employees are so nice and willing to do whatever needed to make the customer happy.  We had plenty of room, it is very clean and food excellent.  Helton is a true neighborhood gem  Again, thank you for a wonderful time!!  Oh, yea, our favorite was the Nitro Milk Stout it's wonderful!!

Teri, Krystal, and Vinny :)"}
{"text":"This brewery is top notch. Don't listen to me try it I'm sure you will agree. The staff is awesome sweet and attentive. The beer is meticulously brewed, with artful creativity. Great beer, great meats and cheeses."}
{"text":"After driving by many times I was glad to see that it was open, I stopped in to try their beers, they had quite a few guest beers and only one of those own. The sign said they had 4 of those beers but only the \"Scottish Ale\" was available. The Scottish ale was very good, but it took about 20 minutes to get it. And it was a Tuesday night, most of the bartenders were having long conversations with people at the bar that they seemed to know personally. Not too friendly with those they didn't know. 
I only had one since the vibe was kinda awkward, and since they only had one of their own beers on tap. I didn't feel like paying 6 bucks for a guest beer. 
I really want to give this place another shot but I think I'll try to go for Happy Hour in a couple months."}
{"text":"Mid week drop in for a pint and a board.  Nice flavorful IPA started the evening followed by the sausage board with nicely toasted bread, cornichons and artichoke hearts.  Finished with a great Dark Munich Lager.  Ulysses behind the bar did a great job.  Enjoyable social setting for a sip and a bite.  Cheers"}
{"text":"Helton Brewing Co. is a much needed fresh take on the brewery scene . When I visit a brewery I'm not looking for TV's and loud music but instead a great tasting beer and good conversation with friends and this place has it all. I will be a regular."}
{"text":"WOW!! This place is awesome! Not just for the atmosphere either. That by itself is worth coming for. The brews are amazing! If you're into Scotch ales the \"Scotch style\" is nearly perfect. Neither side over powers and you don't have that aftertaste when a Scotch ale is out of balance. Great relaxed hang!"}
{"text":"Such a cool place! Happy hour good. Wine in a 12 oz.can for $7! ...so 2 glasses of! Nice repurposing touches. Great addition to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Been here twice. I'm still waiting to give an opinion on the beer. The first time they only had the Scottish Ale, not really our thing, and this time hubby had the IPA which he described as so so, not hoppy enough. I will give them more time to get all that sorted out. 

That said... THE CHAIRS ARE AWFUL!!!!  The yellow is cute, but that's it. They have to change out all the chairs. No matter how big or small your behind is, they are super uncomfortable."}
{"text":"Beers are subpar. Chairs are uncomfortable. This place is more concerned with their merch than the quality of their beers or comfort of their patrons. Pass!"}
{"text":"Great brewery, great beer, cool place. Surprisingly slow for the area but I think that has everything to do with the lack of training. I bought a growler and asked basic questions that I didn't get an answer for regarding the product, pricing and specials. Having worked for one of the best hotels in the world myself, I know the importance of training and product knowledge, and this place could be A LOT better if they put customer experience first rather than just having a good product. They need to remember that they are in the hospitality business, and unless they pay attention to \"customer service\" first, they will never be as successful as they can be. Don't take me wrong, the place is phenomenal and cool, the beer is great, and I'm a customer for the long haul if they focus on the customer satisfaction."}
{"text":"Great concept but clearly still working out opening jitters.  If you aren't patient give them a couple weeks to dial it in before trying."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite brewery.  Great beer options ( I enjoyed the Kolsch and the Strong Pale Ale so far), but having excellent wine as an alternative was unexpected and a really nice surprise.  The spaces are great and I love the new lounge area that opens up to outside, especially this time of year.  The service was helpful when we needed some guidance on what to try next. I can't wait to go back for more!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the Scottish Ale. I was starving when I got there, was kinda bummed there wasn't a food truck out front! I could have used something more to go with my beer. I can't wait to go back once Brian puts on a Hefeweizen - those were my favorite by far, especially for summertime."}
{"text":"What a great new addition to the neighborhood. I met the owner and I knew right away this place is going to be a success. I can't wait till the weather cools off."}
{"text":"Interesting mix of rustic ambiance along with a fresh look, and the beer selection and light fare to compliment them is equally good.  Had their nest and cheese board, and ordered extra JamÃ³n Serrano because it's absolutely buttery and fantastic.  Great little new place."}
{"text":"Just moved into the neighborhood and have been systematically checking out the breweries. Helton is very, very good.

We came midweek, so parking and service were good. We sat indoors, but there is also a massive covered space for games, big groups, etc. Decor is that rustic industrial thing that's popular these days. Very clean and inviting.

Beer: Exceptional. My wife had the sake gosa and thoroughly enjoyed it. I tried the Scottish ale, the oatmeal coffee brown and the rye pale. I actually loved all three, which rarely happens. Awesome.

We're pescatarians and ended up splitting a salad, nachos and pretzels. All good, but not on the same level as the beer. We are folks that like good food with our drinks and that's what keeps this to four stars instead of five. 

As others have suggested, if a touch more thought were extended to the menu, this place would be hard to beat. It'll still be in our regular rotation, though."}
{"text":"I drive by Helton every day as I'm coming and going from my neighborhood. It took me a few months to finally make it in and I wish I'd done so sooner.

The staff is fantastic and recognized me on my second visit. I've tried a flight and my favorite by far was their Nitro Milk Stout. The pilsner was another favorite.

On my last visit I ordered a build your own cheese plate and was more than satisfied with it.

They recently added more space to hang out and that area is a great addition to the bar area. They have events every month and I'm excited to try their beer tasting class one of these days.

Great place to meet up with friends or stop in for a growler fill on your way home!"}
{"text":"It truly pains me to write a review this bad but sometime the truth just must be told. So, the cheese and charcuterie was actually quite good. The good news ends there. They only had one of their own beers on tap and don't can/bottle anything if theirs even though the website shows 4 brews with can artwork...very misleading. The staff was a mess. It took, without exaggeration, 20 minutes for them to properly charge my card.  I mean at least if the vine was rad or the guest beers were solid it could have redeemed itself but it was just a fail. Should have definitely waited to open."}
{"text":"Cool place, good beer, and great meat & cheese program.  Read some of the other reviews that weren't so positive and was surprised.  Think people need to note they're not going into GB or BJ's chain brewery, bar, and grill.  Was kinda bummed they're website wasn't updated with beers on tap as they were out of the Scottish ale, but I think they'll get those kinks out.  Need to be a little lenient on brand new place that's most important job is making good beer with a cool atmosphere.  Usually we bring food to breweries, but they have their own snacks, so might be a little awkward to BYO.  Happy to have another great local brewery in town near DT PHX!"}
{"text":"Awesome spot. Great beer, killer food pairings, fun crafty atmosphere. Really nice addition to Phoenix. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Stopped here on a self guided brewery tour my husband and I made for the weekend and loved it! There were plenty of choices including a delicious barrel aged cherry stout and boysenberry sour that would keep us coming back. We enjoyed sitting at the bar and talking with the friendly staff as well as going outdoors to play shuffle board. They also have pool tables, corn hole, jenga, and darts for entertainment. Plenty of shade and sun. Great for big groups as well. Found out that the owner/brewer is from Indiana which is where we are from as well! Definitely would recommend stopping here. Best brewery we went to in the Phoenix area!"}
{"text":"Love the vibe! Fantastic space, clever atmosphere. Personable, pleasurable and great beer! Just stopped in for a quick edamame and a nitro and was pleasantly surprised. If you're in the area stop by it's definitely worth your time!!!"}
{"text":"Great place! The food menu is simple but really good.  Panini,  waffles,  cheese boards,  are all amazing.  You can't go wrong.  The beers, its a brewery, are winners.  They carry about 7 on tap, so not a lot, but all are well done.  Milk stout is very wonderful.  Can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"Having concluded my first visit, I thought this place was great!  They had a great lineup of beers, complete with some staples (pilsner, stouts, pale ales, etc) and some seasonals (boisenberry sour, imperial cherry stout, etc).  Very large space with lots of outdoor space as well.  Nice to see that they were actually open for lunch during the week as well - that's something that is becoming more rare as most breweries don't seem to open until 3 pm on weekdays during the summer.  

Staff was friendly and personable, beers that I had were good (sour and stout).  Food was good too - not an extensive menu, but there were definitely options.  Will return when I'm in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Great beer, wine, food, and ambiance. All in just one place. Oh, and also great service. Officially a satisfied customer and looking forward to coming back as many times as possible"}
{"text":"Helton Brewing Company is a great new additionto the Phoenix beer scene. Cool vibe throughout, ask for a tour! The IPA just released is super solid, can't wait for what's to come! Stop in, enjoy a good beer and say \"hi\" to Brian. 

PS: definitelytry some of the awesome cheeses offered!"}
{"text":"Phenomenal service, great atmosphere and the scotch ale..... Let me tell you future Helton patron,  it'll blow your socks off and if you're not wearing socks it'll blow the next closest garment off."}
{"text":"The furniture says, hey fat people you're not welcome here. I'm a big guy but I'm half the size of many walking around and there is no way I'm getting my ass in those badly balanced machine shop chairs. Get some comfort man be nice to big peeps they buy beer."}
{"text":"We went back to Helton for the first time since it opened (all about those second chances) and it was really cool! They still seem a little understaffed but they have a cool menu and they have a large selection of beer, as well as a nice selection of wine. It was a great experience and we will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"We stopped by here to try the Northeast IPA which we found via the untappd app. The brewery is very trendy-looking with lots of games. The inside bar is cool looking with some neat wall decorations. Outside is a nice little patio with game such as corn hole and darts. We sat outside to enjoy the warm weather. 

The beer is pretty good. We had the Northeast IPA and the cherry stout. Both beers had good flavors and were not overly bitter.

All-in-all Helton Brewing has a great decorated layout and some pretty decent beers. A cool trendy place to have a good time"}
{"text":"My first time checking this place out and I was extremely pleased! The atmosphere was perfect. Not loud or congested. It was peaceful and relaxing. Im not a beer drinker but after tonight I will be! The staff was friendly and knowledgeable. I loved the fact that I could purchase wine, beer, cheese and more to take home with me. Truly a pleasant experience!"}
{"text":"Delicious Scottish Ale. Better than Kiltlifter, which is such a staple in Phoenix.

Their other beers all tasted quite good. Very clean brewing. Looking forward to trying the new Dark Munich Lager.

Met the owner, Brian, and Assistant Brewer, Ryan. Both seemed like great guys! Really hope Helton does well here in Phoenix."}
{"text":"I'd have reviewed this place sooner but I hadn't yet figured out how to deal with the brewhouse loyalty issue. I'm over it. This isn't a one-horse town.

I just love this place. First, let me start by saying that their IPA is world class. Said more accurately, it compares favorably to any of the standard setting West Coast IPA's. It's tied for first as my favorite IPA in state and that's truly high praise. It's as good as any IPA in it's style brewed anywhere.

But maybe more importantly, all of their beers are so good that more often than not I get their 10 beer flight. And this comes from a die-hard hop head. Anywhere else, I'll almost never get a porter, stout, Brown ale or anything but a pale ale or IPA. I'm no cicerone but I've been drinking craft beer for 26 years and have been brewing my own beer for about six years. I was going to stop talking about the beers but I have to mention the pilsner. Look man, I've been to Oktoberfest in Munich and let's just say this pilsner always makes me exclaim an embarrassingly loud \"Wow!\" when I take the first drink. Give credit to Brian Helton, the brewer and owner for such excellent craftsmanship.

Okay, next and briefly, the food. The savory Belgian waffles are to die for and the Panini's are outstanding. But I came here for the beer...

Lastly, the people. The owner and brewer is a class act. Friendly and humble, I won't give details (we can't have everyone expecting such favors!) but he once did me a solid that may have seemed simple to him but was a big deal for me and damned unique. And there's one particular employee, Jurgen, that continues to surprise me with the extra efforts he makes and his overall awesomeness. 

Lastly, buildings and businesses have energy, a vibe, and this place gives off the vibe that it's all made and served with love. Do yourself a favor and check this place out.

PS: the growler and keg prices will likely surprise you - in a good way."}
{"text":"This is an amazing Brewery. You have to try the sampler flights and the Double Double Northeast IPA will knock your socks off!  The popcorn has such a unique flavor and taste that our table couldn't get enough.  Hadn't expected to eat but my wife and I split the Cuban sandwich and it was terrific.  The service was great and we will be back!!!

Thanks Helton Brewery for a memorable Sunday afternoon!!"}
{"text":"Me and my gal came up for spring training from Vista CA. We found Helton brewing on a local Google search. Let me tell you we were not disappointed one bit! Greeted and served promptly by the friendly bartender. After about 15-20 min of sitting there we were greeted by one of the brewers Marshall. This man went above and beyond to ask if we wanted a quick brew tour since we were from out of town. We gladly accepted. Guy knows his stuff and presents it to you so well that you understand it as well. I mentioned I was a home brewer but am actually a brewer at a local brewery in my city and this dude knows his shit! All their beer is fantastic! If you have not visited this place yet it is a must for brew enthusiast of all stages. Thank you Marshall and Helton brewing for kicking me and my gfs vacation off right! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"We walked in 40min before closing, the waiter told us it's past last call but he'll take us in. We just ordered drinks, he rushed our order, rushed our bill, rushed us out of the place and was pretty rude during normal conversation. The Helton IPA was one of the best IPA's I've ever had, but it doesn't matter how good your food/beverages are if your business doesn't value customers at a fundamental human level. I live around the corner and was excited to have a local bar to call home, but unfortunately it was a waste of time. Don't waste your time and money here."}
{"text":"Fun place to hang out! This was our first time in. It's a big open space, very casual vibe, and an easy place to chill. Service was good. You can do an 8 beer flight for $15 which is most of the beers on the menu. It's awesome to have that option so you can try lots of stuff. There were some I wasn't a big fan of, but that's not surprising since I was trying some styles that weren't my favorite. Overall a good selection. There are a lot of games to play, including board games, pool, darts and jenga. We played a couple of games of battleship. Overall a good place to go for a beer and some relaxation."}
{"text":"Stopped by while out shopping on a Sunday!  Cheese board and beers were yummy.  Roomy location but parking limited.  Will stop again."}
{"text":"Helton's beer list is very straightforward.  They don't put crazy twists on classics, just focus on brewing recognizable beers.  Their food menu is fantastic - I highly recommend the sandwiches and paninis.  Prices are fair an affordable - 2 beers and 2 sandwiches for less than $40.  The atmosphere is what is truly worth going back for.  They have large indoor and outdoor areas, board games available, live music, pool tables, etc.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"We had a \"meh\" experience here over the weekend. The grilled cheese and sugar waffle both were rather dry and the beer selection was limited. I had a small pour of wine for $13 and just felt like the whole experience was a waste. However, me being a not- typical beer drinker may have been the issue, but I just wish they had more options for both food and drink."}
{"text":"Fun spot with a great outdoor area with games. When I first came here they had mostly IPA's on the menu, I'm not a fan of IPA's so I went with their Scottish ale which was pretty good. On my second visit I had their seasonal cherry sour which was also good, I hope they make it a mainstay for the the non IPA lovers so we have some more choices. We were with friends and had ordered the charcuterie board for 4 which was awesome! I would return just for the board, it had goat cheese, cheddar, sausage, chorizo, and two entire savory waffles which were so delicious! We also had the duck fat popcorn which was super flavorful. I will definitely return and hope that they add some less hoppy beers to the mix."}
{"text":"Service is better!!! We got flights and love all their beer!! The cheese options are good! Can't wait for the waffles!!!!"}
{"text":"This review should really be more like 3.5 stars but that isn't an option so I went with 4! 

We stopped in for a quick beer after the DBacks game around 4 PM and they had a decent crowd. Some of which seemed to be regulars because they were getting their growlers refilled! We sat at the bar and waited a few minutes to place our order. The ambiance is fantastic, I love the decor! The best part, they're opening a beer garden that will be dog friendly this Fall!

They have a small variety (4-5) locally made beers (right there on site!) and some wine options as well (great for the ladies!). I ordered the Pilsner and it was good, not the best beer that i've ever had but I love that it is locally made, so that makes it better. ;)  I would LOVE it if they added a wheat beer to the mix. They don't have a full food menu but do have a GREAT variety of cheeses and meats to choose from if you need a light bite. We didn't eat but would definitely consider a charcuterie board in the future. 

The main reason for my star rating is the overall vibe. The music was slow and it seemed really quiet and lacking fun energy. Since you basically go for the beer only, I think some upbeat, mingle friendly music would be a great addition to the place! 

We will be back with our new sheepie pup when they open the beer garden to give it another shot!"}
{"text":"The beer was awesome. Great IPA and oatmeal stout. Food menu was overpriced... $9 for a grilled cheese. But I'll go back for the beer!"}
{"text":"Good beer. Place is just opening but so far everything is awesome. The rye pale ale is good stuff. Place is going to get better and better as they expand their food menu and stuff."}
{"text":"Despite the fact that they don't open until 3:00pm, don't be nervous to arrive right on the dot! (No judgement allowed here, man! I work 5am-1pm daily). Within minutes the bar was well-seated with a variety of people. They had those that like wine, beer, stouts, and were just there for a lunch and a growler. 

The music is perfectly pitched: not too loud, not too quiet. The lighting is dim and perfect for a hot summer day. The wifi password at the moment is \"milkstout\" but is always subject to change. If you're shy like I am, you'll appreciate that I gave out the secret. 

I opted for the special: a beer and cheese pairing. They gave me the milk stout and a goat cheese. It was delicious! I've never paired a beer and cheese before, but they hit the nail on the head with the two. It interested me to see what a goat milk stout might be like. It could go horribly right or horribly wrong, but the flavors were amazing together! I ate it by itself, but next time I'll grab some of the cornichons and house-marinated olives. Their menu is a dream for someone like me that could live off of cruditÃ©s.

The milk stout was fantastic! Their beer is so nice and cold. I can't stress enough how important it is in AZ to serve an ice-cold beer and how rare it actually is to get one. It was cold until the last drop and I'm a slow drinker. It wasn't a very strong or dense stout which I appreciated in the afternoon.\

I'm excited to come back here and get a slew of the accompaniments with my cheese pairing one week. 

TIP: Great for the beginning of a small craft brewery hop as they have food and many of the ones nearby do not."}
{"text":"In the east Phoenix/Arcadia area of town, there are three microbreweries that make up what many valley brewing fans dub the Beermuda Triangle.  Those three include Helio Basin Brewing, Wren House Brewing, and Helton Brewing.  I've personally been to all three for beers in the past, but only recently have been taking in the full food and drinks experience at each.  Wren House doesn't serve food, but they are arguably the most fearless about their brews (their collaboration with Little Miss BBQ on a Pecan Porter beer was especially amazing).  Helio Basin also has great brews and employs a world class chef in Tamara Stanger, elevating brewery food to a whole new level.  Today was my first full experience at the western most brewery in the triangle.  I arrived during Happy Hour on a Wednesday, looking to find out what sets Helton apart.

Helton is easily found on the northwest corner of 22nd Street & Indian School.  Brian Helton is the founder and head brewmaster of this incredibly spacious brewery and pub.  The location's footprint takes up at least 10,000 square feet with a roomy inside bar and seating area for at least 60 or so inside.  Plus a giant covered space outside (similar in feel to The Yard) for at least 100 more.  The building was an old warehouse that Brian and his crew have done a great job turning into a great space to entertain gatherings both big and small.  As I said before, I've had some of Helton's brews in the past and can speak highly of some of their everyday offerings including their Northeast IPA, Pilsner, and their Scottish Ale.  The last time I was here I also had one of their savory waffle offerings and really enjoyed it.  So today I just got a single beer (a 10 oz Pilsner) and focused on the food menu.

It should be mentioned that the food menu displayed on Helton's website is not always up to date.  Which is a shame because there were a couple of items on their website that were not available during today's visit (the Chorizo Mac & Cheese and Autumn Waffle in case you're wondering).  Nevertheless I looked to make the best of the visit with a three course meal.  First up, their Popcorn.  Why?  Well according to their menu they mix theirs with truffle salt and duck fat.  I was intrigued.  It certainly came in a portion that would be big enough to share with a small group.  But the flavor was that of, well, just typical popcorn.  I certainly picked up on the salt, but barely a hint of any oil or buttery fat that I would've anticipated.  It wasn't bad, just a disappointment given the description.  For my main dish, I was looking for an item that was unique to Helton.  The Scoobie sandwich at least on paper seemed to be such an item.  A beef sandwich smothered in house made pilsner cheese sauce and covered in pepper rings.  It's somewhere along the lines of a Chicago beef sandwich or a Philly cheesesteak.  In any event, it was a tasty sandwich and that beer infused cheese sauce was dynamite.  I also really liked the toasted bread they used on the sandwich.  Last up, I was looking for a dessert item.  And there is but one dessert item on the menu.  Their Sweet & Salty Waffle.  This one is infused with salt and two types of sugar (and I think perhaps caramel as well) and served with a syrup on the side for dipping.  The texture of the waffle and sweetness of the syrup were just right, but honestly the flavor of the waffle itself was pretty flat.  I feel like a little infusion of fruit or some other component would elevate this a bit and would even pair better with beer in this fashion.  But not today it seems.

Total cost for my beer, the food, tax and tip came to $30.  After having been here a few times it seems like Helton is still trying to decide exactly what it is.  They clearly know what they're doing on the beer front, but the food side of the business seems to be somewhat of an afterthought.  Maybe that doesn't matter to their everyday clientele.  But for a venue built to draw such huge throngs, I would think they'd look to elevate that part of the business in order to grow.  Its okay if they'd rather just be a brewery like Wren House or if they wanna go all out on food and beer like Helio Basin.  But Helton seems conflicted and caught somewhere in between.  I'll still come back here for some good brews from time to time, but for now I can't say the food menu is anything more than a passing interest."}
{"text":"I stopped by here with a few work friends to check out the beers here and we were not let down! I ordered an IPA and it was the most delicious IPA I've ever had! My friend ordered a beer flight and every beer on it was delicious as well. Our server was friendly and while we were here we received a tour of the brewery from the owner! He was extremely nice, down to Earth and clearly loves brewing beer. Based off my interaction with him I would recommend this place 100 times! Not only do they have good values here but I believe their beer is brewed with love! I'll definitely be back"}
{"text":"So, I really don't want to be negative person but, I really do want to see this place here for many many years. I all for supporting small and local. I love the idea behind this place but, my first complaint is that their seating is very very uncomfortable. I'm a lite beer drinker. I love cheese and sausage. But, even there lightest beer is still too strong/dark. I love the idea of craft beers but, nobody has seemed to tackle a good craft light beer. Now, I know most craft beer drinkers don't feel my pain... I know I'm just drinking piss... but I like it. Many, many people like it and that's why lite beer exist. It would be awesome to walk into a place that doesn't narrow down its clientele because if the Seats were comfortable and you had a good lite beer I coukd easily come spend a few hundred dollars a week on a regular basis. Instead I spent 12 and probably won't be back."}
{"text":"The second stop on our brewery tour last weekend was Helton!  I couldn't decide on which beer to try, so my husband and I opted for the beer sampler...great way to taste everything and decide what you like best.  We ordered a sausage plate and a cheese and charcuterie plate...quite nice!  Watch out for the savory waffles though...so very spicy!"}
{"text":"I gave this brewery/restaurant a try last year and completely forgot to post about it. I remember that the glass of wine was a bit pricey for the amount of given in a wine glass. I believe I ordered a Cheese Panini. The ciabatta bread was a bit tough and really didn't have much flavor. I often pass by and never see a crowd -- I'd love to give this place a try again to see the changes and upgrades. I really want to love and give this place a try even though I'm not a beer drinker."}
{"text":"My fiancÃ©e and I came here on a Friday around 5:30pm, so the rush hadn't quite hit yet. We sat at one of the tables on the outskirts, unsure if we order there or at the bar. However, we were promptly greeted by a server who was quick to take our orders at the table and bring our drinks out. The bar was near full, but the tables around the taproom were still mostly vacant. By 6pm it had started to fill throughout more of the taproom. Our server remained attentive the whole time, she was friendly and provided valuable recommendations on what to order. I had the Scotch Style and the Northeast IPA. Very different from one another but both great. Will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Excellent beer with a varied selection - including guest taps. Unique and delicious food options and friendly service."}
{"text":"Water is self-serve. Other than that, a decent pale ale. Gotta cheese it up next time I guess."}
{"text":"This place is great! They brew their own beer and the nitro milk stout is delicious. However, if you're a woman with a backside, don't sit at the bar. The chairs squish the booty!"}
{"text":"Once I finally got a beer it was very good. Service however nonexistent. Never got a menu watched servers walk by clueless.Wasn't busy . I hope they get it together .Nice space good beer."}
{"text":"Best local brewery I ever been to in phoenix. People that works there are super nice and respect me as a deaf person. I love that. There are some workers that know sign language. I loved it! Perfect for Deaf community."}
{"text":"Was so excited for this spot to finally open and to try it. A beautiful bar and space, very helpful patient server. But otherwise underwhelming. They only have three of their own beers on the menu, including a milk stout which seems like a strange offering when it's over 90Â° outside. Bummed they don't offer any beer flights but our server let us taste several beers. Loved the rye pale ale but had a hard time finding a second beer I was excited to try. Charcuterie plate was great, but they nickel-and-dime it. Meats and cheeses are $2.50-$3.95 each for a one-ounce serving with no accouterments. It's $2.55 for a side of crackers, which includes about 8 small crackers. I'd prefer that they just let you pick 2 or 3 options and plate it up with nuts, crackers, etc. Glad I tried it, but won't be rushing back."}
{"text":"We came here yesterday to try Helton for the first time, and it was a great experience. If you like lighter beers, I recommend the Pilsner, it's really good! The bartenders are super helpful as well and will give you good recommendations based on what you like. 

This brewery has a very cool atmosphere as well, if you pay attention to that kind of thing :) it has a good look and design, and they sell a lot of cool merchandise! The patio looks really fun too, I'll definitely come back when the weather is nicer to check that out. 

All of the beers are reasonably priced, but I did see that you can get $1 off by following Helton on social media, which I thought was cool. I'm sure they are very nice about honoring that - yesterday we used a visa gift card we had, and their machine didn't take it so the bartender just went ahead and bought our beers for us! I thought that was super nice of her, we couldn't believe it :)"}
{"text":"This is one of the best breweries in Phoenix.  The beers are always clean, well balanced, and on point.  The atmosphere is casual and relaxed, with a huge patio space.  The menu is smallish, but everything is well executed, and they have a few vegetarian options.  Their servers are friendly and engaged, even when the place is hopping.  

The Valley breweries have really upped their game in the last decade, and Helton tops the heap.  It's obvious that the brewers are highly skilled and love what they do."}
{"text":"After my first visit with crappy service, I found myself back here about 4 months later. Around that same time, other Yelpers had also commented on the lack of service. 

This time was a whole new experience. We were greeting quickly, and bartender was attentive  for the entire time we were there."}
{"text":"Decent beer and good waffles. Service slow though even with no crowd. Good place for meeting though. Imagine the set up to be fun during evening hours."}
{"text":"Ok, this may seem harsh but first off....if you open a store, there should be some basics in place.  

1.  I though the ambiance was rather flat.  There's just nothing \"going\" on.  I don't think there was any music playing, if so, it wasn't noticeable.  No TV's.  Nothing to keep you busy.  I'd recommend one of those bar boxes with the games.  A TV.  Music (turned up a little).  

2.  6 dollars for a draft...on Indian School and 24th st?  I'd expect that in Scottsdale.  I've had quality beers, and can appreciate a fine crafted beer, but I can't stand places that charge 6 dollars for a draft beer, even Scottsdale.  And no, it has nothing to do with being cheap, it has to do with price gouging.  The mark up is outrageous.  Sun Up has quality drafts at much more reasonable price.

3.  The menu is horrible.  3/4 of a menu of cheese?  It's not a wine bar.  This was a horrible decision by whomever.  Beer increases appetite...enough said. Panini and beer?  Good lord.

I understand working out the kinks, but as it is, I see this place closing if it stays the same.  The one reviewer writes \"great concept...\"  What is the concept?  Serve beer, have tables, and offer cheese?  Hmm. Ok.  

I see this place as being greedy.  It's over priced.  They clearly want to serve food that doesn't require a kitchen so that they can keep the cost of the establishment at a bare minimum.  This tells me they could care less about the customer service and just expect to get people to come there and pay inflated prices for beer and a sliver of cheese.  Sorry, but I'll pass."}
{"text":"Amazing! The food, atmosphere, everything. I was here Saturday for a late lunch and this place really screams Phoenix! 

The food is outstanding. I had the Thai Tacos, not only delicious but and very well prepared!

I will definitely be back"}
{"text":"The service, decor and relaxed atmosphere gave this place an extra star.  The prices are very reasonable and the staff are friendly. 
the ipa and milk stout were both good.  the pale ales were not bad.  I am not a fan of Scottish ales and this one did not help to change my mind.  great price on growler fills.  Worth coming in to try a flight.
Alley was very comfortable on their cool floor."}
{"text":"Overall impressed with this place. 5 of their own beers on tap plus a handful of guest beers, create your own meat and cheese platters! Great service, awesome atmosphere, beer selection is good. Love that they have events like beer and cheese pairing classes and yoga in the brewery! I look forward to coming back and seeing this place develop !"}
{"text":"This place is right up my alley. No, really, it technically is right down the street from my house, and that is both good and dangerous. It's kinda like a little kid living across the street from the ice cream shop.

I discovered this brew house about two months ago. Now it's my go to meeting spot to catch up with friends and spend time with my real estate clients (sorry Starbucks). 

My fav list (in order): IPA, Scotch Ale, & Milk stout. it's a tough call though. All of em are delicious and hearty. One of the things I like about the beer is the fact that the alcohol level isn't scant. Nobody likes to have to drink double the fluid for the desired effect. 2 pints at Helton will squash any bad day with ease. So get on down to Helton and give it a whirl. 

Next up for me: gonna get me one of those growlers to take home....."}
{"text":"First time here not very impressed.  I guess they were preparing for a party and their customer service went out the window.  Felt like I was begging for a beer at the bar for 10 minutes with out a bartender in sight.  On the bright side the NE IPA was very good."}
{"text":"Been waiting almost a year for this place to open - had been coming by the building when I was down this way at Wren House or Phoenix Ale.
Missed the grand opening last week, but got here as soon as I could. 
First impressions - the outside of the building is as low-key and as industrial/generic old school commercial as it looked a year ago. The only differences are that there's now a sign and the windows are clean. Inside, it's definitely very hipster and appointed with a combination of 60s doorways and windows and framing, wood paneling distressed wood walls black painted ceiling, open ceiling duct work, and big J shaped bar with wood top. There are plenty of tables if you don't choose to sit at the bar.
It's a big building, and the brewing facility is behind the windows at the back of the seating area. Looks like there's plenty of room back there to expand in the future.
They only have one of their own beers on tap right now, the Scottish ale, and it's a pretty decent beer. It's got some complexity, with little bit of bourbon taste sweet mall to toasted malt and there's even somewhere in the back There's  chocolate or cocoa.
I arrived here at noon on Sunday when they opened. It was already packed. People drinking beers, as well as having some of the food that they serve here. While they serve wine as well I don't see anybody embarrassing themselves by ordering one. While I wouldn't call it kid friendly, there are kids here as well.
I'm going to give it a ranking of four stars, but I'm a little concerned that they don't have their own beer, and it's a little too upscale hipster to suit my taste.
Let's see what happens over the next couple months as they mature a bit.
Update two weeks later: back to see if they have more of their own beers. Two this time, and am having the IPA. The IPA is solid, uncompromisingly bitter, little malt note. No one drinking wine, promising. One ~80 year old guy wearing a straw cowboy hat, having an old school Coke from an old school Coke bottle. The guys next to me talking about pizza and caramelized onions.
Am back again, it's July, and the patrons are as mixed as before. The Helton Rye Pale Ale is excellent, and well worth the visit just for that pour. There are strangers (to one another) striking up conversations at the bar, people playing board games, and generally seeming to be comfortable. Mandy, behind the bar, is pleasant and attentive."}
{"text":"Another place I'll be adding onto my list of places to come back to every time I'm home for the holidays. We arrived here about 15 minutes prior to them opening and they let us in. I'll start with saying the decor is great, they've really kicked it up a notch. We had the Board for 4 and the beer flight and all I can say is WOW. The board is priced at only $28 and is enough to make 4 people satisfied when it's paired with their beer. The cheese they choose for this is every bit of delicious and those stuffed waffles and meats are also amazing. My favorite beers were the ones of the lighter variety, but honestly enjoyed all of them. Staff was friendly and the music was pretty darn good too! This would be a great joint to check out at night with friends."}
{"text":"I'm a sucker for breweries that have areas for you to play in while drinking beers. Helton looks like a car garage turned into a brewery, so there's a ton of open space for you to drink beer and hang out. On the outside portion, they have couches, chairs and two pool tables. They also have table shuffleboard, darts and even large jenga. It's truly awesome at Helton! 

Only got to sample their two IPAs and I definitely preferred the Northeast IPA to just the regular IPA. 

Highly recommend for groups who just want to have a good time!"}
{"text":"Doesn't get any better. Lining up some four ounce tasters to see what's in store for next weeks tap lineup at the Grape. Helton Brewery is leading in the creativity side of new beers in the Arizona marketplace. It's a pleasure to support their growth."}
{"text":"It's exciting to have a brewer in town that knows his craft like a momma knows her baby. A must for anyone who appreciates truly hand crafted beer. The lemongrass saison is unique and well rounded to a wide variety of beer drinkers. The nitro milk stout knocked my flip flops off. I could do the back stroke in this stuff. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Finally made it in to Helton. The exterior definitely doesn't match the interior. Open, nicely done. Looks like changes are still int the works, but overall   Very enjoyable. 

The beer was great. Staff is knowledgeable and friendly. I came for the beer and returned for the food. Two words...savory waffle. Holy crap. It is amazing. The meat & cheese boards are fantastic. Reasonable prices with generous portions. Oh yeah, duck salami. Came back a few days later & enjoyed the Cuban sandwich as well. Nothing disappoints. So glad to have found this gem in my neighborhood."}
{"text":"I can't  say enough! Great service, great atmosphere and loved the charcuterie! Oh! And how could I forget the amazing brews they offer. The IPAs rocked and the Scottish Ale was delish."}
{"text":"Very cool atmosphere. The food was phenomenal. I highly recommend the cheese plate with the waffles! Wine selection is decent. Only strange thing is water is self service..when I was looking over the menu to decide on a drink I asked for water and the waitress told me it was in the corner. So I had to set down the menu to get the water then decided. Kind of off but other than that this place has great potential."}
{"text":"I've been waiting forever for this place to finally open.  Stopped in a couple of Fridays ago on my way to a Dbacks game.

First of all, the parking is really tough.  They have a small lot in front and some side parking on the street to the east of their building.  These were all full and a friend of mine had to park across the street on the other side of Indian School.

They did a nice job with the interior decor and you can look into the brewing area.  I sat at the bar and ordered their IPA.  After about five minutes I looked around and wondered where the bartender and my beer where?  Then I saw that the beer taps are in the far corner of the room about twenty feet away from the bar.  The bartenders need to take a roadtrip and back just to pour and serve a beer.

The IPA, however, was very good.  Well-balanced with a nice hops bite.  I'm looking forward to their other beers in the future."}
{"text":"I stopped by driving to my hotel... you know me..I can't drive past a brewery! I ordered their Milk Stout on Nitro 6.9% ABV...this was smooth as a Brazilian hair weave! Semi sweet chocolate notes and roasted coffee..yum!! And a 6oz beer was $3.50...winner winner chicken dinner!!"}
{"text":"We enjoyed this brewery. The beer was solid. Good IPA. We came on a weekday around 1?  Only a few customers there. We got served quickly. 
We went outside and had the entire patio to ourselves.  We played pool and darts and it was great.  Awesome outdoor area 

Will definitely be back and will bring out of towners by to experience a great AZ brewery!"}
{"text":"Good beer, wish service was a match. Very snobby bartender. She made visible eye-rolls whenever we asked for something. Won't be back."}
{"text":"The ambiance and beers were great! I love that I was able to bring my child, enjoy some beer, and play some yard games. I felt like I was in someone's back yard. My favorite beer was the nitro stout, then the blackberry sour."}
{"text":"One of the best breweries in the valley! Great people, awesome atmosphere, killer beers."}
{"text":"Ok I hate these types of reviews. However, they are important to help businesses when they are lacking in certain departments. Rude waitresses..clearly they have a preference in men over women when giving good service or any service at all. Such a bummer - will definitely spread the word to my friends."}
{"text":"Taproom designed to support education through taste. They have a monthly schedule with anything from vino & canvas painting, tap takeover, beer school and summer meltdown parties. 

There are many items to keep you entertained while with your friends there are pool tables outside."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem! It capitalizes on the beer n' cheese experience. They really know their cheeses; my palate and taste buds were mesmerized as I was sampling all the glorious dairy delicacies. The crows dairy fresh chÃ¨vre goat cheese is mind blowing; it's like the cotton of cheeses. Paired with a nice Scottish style ale and a warm, welcoming environment, this place really wrapped up a unique consumer experience."}
{"text":"This is our third brewery stop today and we are really enjoying the beers, the food, and the ambiance! We ordered a couple flights of beer, popcorn, and a charcuterie board for 4. The board is a fun and unique board with a savory Belgian waffle. Yum! We have enjoyed sampling the Helton beers and to be able to try a few guests beers has been fun too. 

Can I tell you how much I love this space? It's bright and great for large groups. We can't wait to come back and bring all of our friends."}
{"text":"This little gem is a great find, and I say that having been to many of the great microbreweries in the valley. They have a fantastic list of regular beers including a Pilsner which isn't a common find. What is even better is the food menu! You can always find decent pub fare in most of the breweries around, but usually you need to know your way around the menu to avoid the duds. This menu is limited but terrific - panini, meat and cheese boards, and sweet or savory waffles! You really can't go wrong, it's evident plenty of thought and care goes into everything and the staff is knowledgeable and friendly."}
{"text":"Cool new place.
I like the industrial feel in the place and the friendly staff.
I love that they serve sandwiches and meat and cheese boards.
Unfortunately, the night we went, all the house brews tended to the bitter, which is not my preference. The bartender did inform us that they have previously brewed a sour and a Belgian (my faves), so I guess we just mis-timed it. The Red I did try was definitely drinkable, though.

Overall, I am a fan of any craft brewery, especially in this neighborhood. I'll be back to sample more beers.

Note to Mr. Helton: your chairs are the worst. Please get something more comfortable if you want people to sit and hang out."}
{"text":"Did a little brewery hopping a few weekends ago & came across this gem on Yelp & we were not disappointed. Its in a interesting part of town (for me at least) and they mentioned it used to be a car garage. The staff were super nice & helpful, we got a flight and enjoyed it very much. They even recommended to us somewhere to check out afterwards. I cant wait to go back."}
{"text":"Great beer, but the food isn't so great. 

If you're looking to just drink and hang out, this is your place, but this isn't a place to go and eat. The food is mediocre and a bit over priced for what it is. I was initially so impressed by the simple menu because everything looked so tasty, but the reality was a let down. We got a charcuterie board which was fine. Nothing too special (though it did have waffles) and it was a bit mismatched. There were good things in it, but it was not really cohesive. Then we had sandwiches and chips. The chips aren't made in house, but are a Costco-generic type and the sandwiches are on flavorless, hole-ie bread with humble amounts of other ingredients. It was so hard to just get past the bread. 

Really want to love this place because they do and amazing job with their beer, but I can only like it because their food just isn't worth it."}
{"text":"Great find. Yummy small plates including savory waffles and Mac and cheese. Amazing beers. Love the nitro milk stout and red velvet cake imperial. Fun space to visit especially when it is nice out. Indoor outdoor seating."}
{"text":"So sad! I live up street and waited for this place to open. Well, they serve like two items as far as food goes and these are not even an actual meal. This would be fine if you could go there after dinner for some drinks but this place closes at 9pm!!! That is the time some non-trendy restaurants close but if they want to survive and cater to the clientele of this neighborhood, they really need to make some major changes to their operation. Only plus is the beer but I can go other places for that and get food and stay a bit to meet with friends. This owner needs to wake up. Everyone I have spoken too has complained about their hours and lack of food!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite breweries in Phoenix. Great beer and great service, I love the IPA and the Scottish Style Ale."}
{"text":"Helton has a very modern country theme to it. Fun place to go chill and have a drink. They have a pretty good range of beers and wine. Didn't have any sours, but not many places do. Good food with a pretty simple menu so not too overwhelming."}
{"text":"Great selection of beers that are true to their styles. The bartender was very attentive and even though we didn't eat, they had a great selection of cheese to accompany the beer. I first had their Pilsner at State 48 Brewery in Surprise, so I decided to come check out the actual brewery for myself."}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere, space design, and friendly owner and staff. Our timing must've been good as we were able to get in on a brief tour of the facilities. The few beers they had on tap were solid and I can't wait to see what else they come up with. I was also told that they'd soon be expanding outdoors with a beer garden, so that should be a welcome arrival. They did seem to be slammed both times I was there, but the staff seemed to respond well under what I'm sure was an uncomfortable amount of pressure to perform."}
{"text":"Helton and Wren House are my neighborhood breweries. I live pretty much smack-dab in the middle of both. What's really cool about Helton is that you can see the whole brewery and geek out on all the equipment. 

They also recently opened the patio, which is a great spot to hang out and waste away an afternoon. 

Anyway...Helton has been brewing great beers from day one. There's a style for everyone. I'm big on IPAs and the house IPA at Helton is great, reminds me of some of the West Coast staples from Knee Deep or Modern Times. My favorite Helton beer however, is the Northeast IPA, which sells out pretty quickly. Get on that if you're lucky enough to be there when it's on tap. 

Oh, and growler fills are a smokin' deal. A 32 oz refill is around the same price as a pint (that's for a fill, the new growler will cost a bit extra). Can't beat that price for fresh locally-brewed craft beer."}
{"text":"First visit but not my last.  Solid start for a new brewery... Crisp Pilsner with a touch of malt, Rye Pale Ale was excellent, balanced IPA, and a Scottish with a nut brown finish. 

Food is limited to charcuteries, but as long as they focus on the beer I won't complain"}
{"text":"We stopped in after dropping a bike off at Western Honda.What a surprise.At first, were expecting a burger brewery,. Like all the others in town.Nooo. Sample flight will get you where you wanna be with flavors, add a meat/ cheese board.  And your good !!!- we will be back! Atmosphere was cool mellow for Saturday afternoon.--- nice."}
{"text":"Like some of the cheeses they sell and the beers they brew, this place needs some time.  It feels a little off for some reason.  I don't know if it's the odd dÃ©cor and setup, the bad acoustics, or the beer but I feel like if I come back in a few months it'll be better.  The beers were just ok.  The flight started with a pilsner that a day later I'm still trying to decide if it was really good and crisp or a Miller Lite clone.  I'm leaning towards the former so that's good.  The milk stout on nitro was smooth and was a tasty end to the flight but the middle 4 weren't very memorable.  

I've heard great things about the brewer here and genuinely look forward to his future creations.  Next time I'll pair the beers up with a meat/cheese board.  Maybe that'll do the trick."}
{"text":"What a great addition to the neighborhood. I could go on and on about how amazing the beer is and the growing menu options - love the panini selection and charcuterie but what sets Helton apart is they are connecting to the community through education and inviting others into their space. I hope I get to join one of their Bottoms Up Yoga classes, a pairing class or whatever they come up with next! 

Kudos to Helton for having great beer, great food and creating the community connection!"}
{"text":"I had been waiting for this place to open for months and the date finally arrived! The place was packed which is to be expected for an opening night but equally due to the quality of their Scottish ale which I can tell you scores way above the competition in the area (Kilt Lifter included)! In addition to the brewskis, Helton also has paninis and charcuterie boards that look absolutely appetizing! This place rivals the surefire breweries I depend on in my home state of California. I can't wait for their other beers to come out and will definitely be back as I work right across the street. So happy to find a place close to work as an excuse to avoid rush hour and have a quality craft beer.

Brian Helton knows what he's doing and you can tell it in the integrity of the brew. Come check it out!"}
{"text":"I had to be out of my home with 3 dogs during realtor showing. Supper nice people and Surprised at how good their IPAs are. Back again today had lunch and surprised to have one dollar for each beer with delicious food. If you haven't come yet you need to come try it out"}
{"text":"I'm visiting from San Diego and I tasted a few but really like the IPA. it is crisp and hoppy with the perfect amount of carbonation. Olivia the beer tender is very friendly and the food smells great!"}
{"text":"Stopped to do a beer flight here with a beer buddy and was very nicely surprised.
The beer selection was really nice.
We did eat also and the cheese platter went perfectly with the beers in the flight.
Will definitely be back for another visit sometime soon.."}
{"text":"Amazing brewery, very Seattle northwest feel, great food, good atmosphere, games, have to give it a try! I have had over 1000 beers and they know what they are doing with all their beer!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite go to spots! It's so amazing having a local brewery just minutes from my home! There's not a lot of places like it around; THE BEER IS MADE RIGHT HERE! This is a production facility with a front of house, and now some great food selections! Keep in mind, while this not a restaurant but a great variety of food items and beer and wine are available! The outdoor patio/beer garden is a great place to hang out and enjoy your libations. I love bringing friends, family, and colleagues here for any occasion. I also love that the beer garden is smoke free! If you hang out regularly or schmooze just right you can get a tour of the facility as well! Great happy hour, amazing place all around. You'll probably see me soon...(or tomorrow)"}
{"text":"Stopped in the new local brewery after a long walk at the Phoenix Zoo Lights. I was so very impressed with this brewery. Very low key, dark, clean, and friendly!  We did the entire sampler and picked our favorite, the black IPA, and filled up a growler.  It was only $9 to fill up a growler. Best price I've ever seen for a brewery! The sampler was non expensive at all too. 

After ordering the growler the bar tender was nice enough to take me to their back room where the beer is being brewed. He explained about the expansion of the beer patio and was very friendly about the brewery and any questions I had. 

Overall Helton is a much welcome brewery in the Phoenix area. Great prices, super nice service, and just a cool vibe. We went on a weekday so I'd love to see it on a weekend. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Love this place, every time I love it more and it's becoming the spot the place. First of all great beer and the menu has majorly improved.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"Met some friends here for Happy Hour and really liked it!

It wasn't all that crowded when we were here, but despite the fact that the inside is pretty big/open there's not a ton of seating. There was five of us and we got the last table. There's a really nice looking HUGE patio, but when your here at around 4 o'clock in June that's not happening. 

I had an IPA that I really liked (the Northeast IPA). I believe during HH pints are a dollar off. I also had there canned wine, which is great during HH. It's 12 ounces (so two glasses) and I believe $7.50. That's a great deal! We also split one of there charcuterie plates, that was yummy. Standout items for me were the waffle (which I would like to try more of from this place) and the sausage. 

Although I didn't take advantage of it, this place really does have great deals on growlers. One of my friends who I was here with picked one up the following morning when she picked up her car and was pleased. 

I'll definitely come back (especially when the weather is nicer to take advantage of the patio)!"}
{"text":"Captivating menu including many fancy meats and cheeses +Every beer on tap is delicious = the combinations are endless!! I will definitely return however the uncomfortable zero option seating suggests \"don't stay long\"."}
{"text":"Great beer. Great ambiance. Attentive staff. Go to Helton, you won't regret it! I don't like beer but there IPA was delicious! :)"}
{"text":"I concur with some of my fellow yelpers that parking is not ideal for this local brewery,  but I do love the industrial,  minimalist decor of the joint. It's pretty ideal for catching up with friends whether you have 2 or 10 in your party.
The service was attentive and efficient,  and the overall ambiance was friendly. One thing I will discount Helton on is their beer selection. They had a few guest beers on the back,  but as far as their self made selections go the list was rather limited.  I had a pilsner,  which was good for the plainer beer it is, but I'd like to see some more creativity with their lighter brews. 
If you stop in I would implore you to order the charcuterie items. The selection of cheeses and side items are vast,  with a lot of complex flavors. On my board I had raspberry infused chocolate pieces, perfectly acidic pickles, and sumptuously fatty Jamon... And that's not even mentioning the cheeses! Their blue cheese \"smokey blue\" is so soft and buttery,  it plays perfectly with the cheeses sharp flavors. Their was another cheese... Goose something... that was my favorite. Soft and mild at first with a pungent farmy finish. I'll definitely be back, I just hope they expand their beer list."}
{"text":"Love this place, you pull up and are kind of ummm, yeah ok Ill give it a try.  You walk in and the place is awesome.  Large bar for about 20-25 people to sit and taste some awesome beer!  I haven't had one I didn't like.  Very small menu, i prefer their meat and cheese tray followed by the Cuban sandwich, but your in this place to accompany the beer not to eat the food.  Don't get me wrong the food is very good but the beer is better, and that is exactly the way a brewery should be.....

You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Great beer selection with something for everyone.  Had a nitro stout and a rhubarb sour and both were well done. Yes, strange combo, but it worked.  Giant nachos with homemade guacamole and a unique BLT.  Awesome and knowledgeable service.  Billiards, darts, cornhole I'm cooled open air space outside and games to play inside.  Looking forward to a repeat visit!"}
{"text":"Basis for my starred ratings (which skews heavily to the food or drink):
1 star:  Never again.
2 stars:  Poor food, poor experience, extraordinary measures in order for me to come back.
3 stars:  Average, nothing really special, nothing particularly bad.
4 stars:  Very good, would definitely return.
5 stars:  A favorite, one of the best.

First time visiting and I'm a fan - of multiple things.

First, very happy that Troy and his wife found a new home here with the meat and cheese counter.  We were huge fans of theirs when they had Wedge & Bottle and were excited to hear that they joined the Helton team.  Their cheese selection (especially American cheeses) is well curated and they pick decent meats to match.  Tonight, had the special cheddar board and it was fantastic.  Especially the addition of the Cabot, which I miss from my days in Vermont.

Second, the Helton milk stout.  It is a nitro milk stout, so naturally, comparisons to Left Hand.  This one is very good.  It is milkier than Left Hand, same level of chocolateyness, similar mouth-feel, juuuuust a hint of bitter at the end.  It is, generally, sweeter than Left Hand and it made for an excellent dessert after our dinner.

So based on these two things alone, I give them the benefit of the doubt and say 4 stars.  I say benefit of the doubt because they've only brewed 2 beers so far - the milk stout and an IPA.  Hoping and waiting to see new and great things coming from here."}
{"text":"Great beer! Such a great atmosphere too. Gotta try the Munich Lager, full flavored with subtle, sweet notes that last. We tried a flight of the house beers and then ordered pints of the milk stout and lager. Our only complaint? The chairs!! These things have to go. We may have stuck around for hours if there was somewhere a bit more comfortable to sit...these stools will be the death of this brewery."}
{"text":"We went here tonight to check out the cheese and charcuterie and it was excellent! They also served wine from a can, and surprisingly, it was very good. I would highly recommend!  Troy, Krista and company are all helpful and knowledge. A great place to take family and friends!"}
{"text":"I think they opened a bit early without being prepared. I was kind of disappointed that they only had one of their own beers on tap. I was happy that they did have one of fates stouts on tap that I did want to try. 

Beers are a bit on the high side of pricing. Food selection was very very limited. Nothing really there that could hold anyone over. Lots of cheese variety. Although, I don't find myself staying much longer to enjoy another beer if the food is not there to keep me there. May be a nice place to catch a beer and bounce to your final destination. 

Service was very nice for us. We were attended to right away and periodically checked on. 

I think once Helton brewing works the kinks, it will be a better place to attend."}
{"text":"Good beer. Small menu, but good food. My only complaint was that the music was kinda blaring out of a not so great sound system."}
{"text":"Helton ya the best IPA hands down. The brewery has a great atmosphere and an awesome patio with pool tables and fuseball. We will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"I had stopped here right after having a few beers at the Wren Brew house down the street and I really liked that there was ample room to sit and chat with friends. The place was a bit dead but the beer was good and the staff was very friendly. They offer several cheeses and meats you can order which is a nice touch for a tasty salty snack while you sip on a well paired beer. I'll be back and check on this place again hopefully it will be a bit livelier."}
{"text":"Came back finally a few months ago . They worked out the kinks and Brian the owner was on hand to give us a tour behind the scenes . Very personable . Also the patio is now dog friendly . Stellar !"}
{"text":"Checked out Helton Brewery last weekend and wasn't disappointed. The interior of the beer tasting lounge is great for groups and really well decorated. The only serve cheese and charcuterie options which we tried and it was great. I'll definitely check it out again!"}
{"text":"I continue to be blown away by the Beer these guys are putting out. Get there. Take the journey through the Beer offerings."}
{"text":"My friends and I LOVE this place. What a cool jewel on Indian School. (Oh dang, that rhymed!)

Their selection of beer is awesome and completely custom brewed on site. The back of the bar has these cool, repurposed french doors mounted so you can see through to the fermentation tanks. Then, on the side of the bar they've got this giant covered space with huge roll up doors with a pool table and shuffleboard. I ended up meeting one of the owners, and she was so excited telling me about all the reclaimed lumber and furniture that's been carefully hunted for and given a new home. This kind of attention to detail is something I appreciate and want to help thrive.

But enough about the place, let's talk about the BEER. You've got to try the IPA's. Grab a sampler and find your favorite. I loved the black IPA. And if you find the flavor that you can't live without, they sell growlers! We're definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere here at Heltons. This brewey was the first stop for my dad's birthday brewery hop. There was 12 of us to start and tried all beers on tap. We also tried several items on the menu such as their savory waffles and pesto panini. We all agreed that it wasn't 5 stars, the beers were okay and the service needs help. But we will try this place again in the near future."}
{"text":"Sign me up! Sad I discovered this place during my last go at Phoenix. Darts, YES. cornhole, perfect. Pool? Okay sure. Hahah. It was a great night. Had the chicken sliders, Cuban, and pretzels. Can I just get a shot of that pretzel cheese tho? BOMB. 

This place is awesome. And I love the staff! Super inviting. And answer all of our questions. Didn't mean to quiz the menu but they naileddddd it!!!

PS WATER IS FREE!"}
{"text":"I just happened to be driving by after dropping off my yelp friend, Amad, at the airport.  It was destiny.  I was planning to take the next exit but it was closed so I took Indian School and went  east and there it was.  I did a you turn and there I was.  I had been planning to check out this place anyway because I am a huge fan of their pilsner.  After the pilsner I ordered a sample size of a few more but the pilsner was my favorite by far.  

I  looked at the menu which had a Cuban sandwich.  I love a good cuban sandwich but it is hard to fine a good one even at Cuban restaurants.  This was a great one.  Bread was awesome, toasted perfectly, right amount of cheese, pickles and mustard. A little messy to eat but well worth it.  

The place has the typical brewery feel to it, almost like a small warehouse, main room with the bar and another big room next to it.  Very friendly staff too.  Menu was kind of limited by I'm happy with the Cuban.    Now I don't have to go to Miami for a great Cuban sandwich!"}
{"text":"Ok so this review is based on my visit during the first weekend of opening. I was reluctant to stop, but I'm from out of town and my sister had heard about this place. 

The Scottish Ale was so delicious! Kuddos to the brewmaster... It was so good in fact, I tried to come back the next day to get a growler, but was disappointed they didn't have their own growlers yet! Well I guess it was a 1 time experience for me since I live in California. 

Don't forget to try some cheese too while you're here. They have a good selection of niblets, but don't expect a full kitchen offering appetizers or entrees."}
{"text":"Super laid back brewery, rustic vibe, good beer, attentive smiley servers. Beer smart. Lovely neighborhood vibe, but edgy enough for a guys hangout. A+++. I'd come here again and again. Basic Pilsner is light and refreshing but with good flavor (no bud light here, sacrilege). Tried their sake gose, yummy crisp almost white wine-like finish. I love sour, so if you do too, their boysenberry will make you pucker up. Flight of 8, 4oz pours are $15. 16oz $6, 10oz $3.50, reasonable prices. 

Didn't get food this time, but will come back to try out their grub."}
{"text":"I love Helton Brewing Co.! Our central Phoenix neighborhood has been crying out for this type of establishment. On-premise, and freshly brewed beers with a wide variety of styles. Excellent food and service in a polished industrial atmosphere that includes games and outdoor space. A local favorite!"}
{"text":"I had very high hopes for this place, as it is so close to my house. Decor, food, and beer were all good, but the service is what has hindered me from ever returning. I came with a party of four, and our waitress was probably one of the worst I have ever encountered. I work in the service industry, and I try to give everyone a fair chance because I understand the pressures of working in a fast paced restaurant. This experience was inexcusable. Our server refused to serve a member of our party because she did not deem his ID \"acceptable\"...even though it was a state issued ID card with the birthday, name, and picture all clearly present. When questioned she said it was her own personal rule, and not one of the companies. In my experience that isn't standard or usually accepted, but ok..also conveniently there was no manger present to be spoken with at the time. I wanted to love this place, but honestly our server made the experience one of the most unpleasant I have ever had in the service industry."}
{"text":"Helton is a cute little brewery with some tasty beers. I tried their nitro porter.... yum. I wish they had a sour or wheat on their menu, but I'm sure it'll come with time. I can't wait to visit again to try their yummy looking sandwiches!"}
{"text":"Awesome neighborhood brewery! Food menu is limited, focus is more on the beer. Great dog-friendly patio with yard games!"}
{"text":"This place had excellent beer and fun shuffle board for us to play after a day of baseball watching! It wasn't super busy on a Saturday in May but that could be because there were like 3 other events in Phoenix at the same time. Really need to go back it's just further from home! It's in a sort of random shopping mall strip on Indian School."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday evening for a friend's birthday party. They have a great space, good drinks, and it wasn't overly crowded. It's a fun place to hang out at with a great of friends with a bunch of games and seating on the patio.

While they only served small plates/appetizers, the nachos with pork were really good. Wish they had a more expansive menu. I would have loved to hang out here longer, but ended up leaving to go get a proper meal."}
{"text":"My husband and I attended a soft opening event here last night. Overall, we had an excellent experience! We live up the street, near Indian School and 32nd Street, and have eagerly been awaiting the opening.

The place was pretty full when we arrived around 6:30, but we were greeted and seated quickly. I love the feel and decor of the place. I'm not sure what these industrial buildings were in a previous life, but they had to have done a ton of work to get it to its current state. I loved the large U shaped bar. I only had two minor complaints about the environment: 1. The seats in the yellow chairs are a little shallow. I'm an average sized person, but I would assume a larger person would be pretty uncomfortable sitting in these chairs because they just don't offer a ton of space for your butt. 2. I sat in a seat facing the bar/kitchen. Like I mentioned above, the interior is beautiful, but my main view was a large blank white wall in the kitchen. It would be awesome to carry over your decor theme onto that wall so everything flows nicely together, and there isn't that disjunct big white wall space.

Though none of Helton's brewed beers were available last night, they had some good local and other craft beers on tap. My husband had the Sun Up Trooper and I had the Underwood Pinot Noir (canned wine from Oregon). Both were good. I've never had canned wine before, but I really liked it! It was a large amount of wine for only $10.

We chose a varied mix of cheeses, meats, and fixings for our charcuterie board. The marinated olives and the pickles were super tasty and flavorful. The tart cherry jam had a very unique flavor. It was spiced and sour all at the same time, never had anything like that before. The Toscano and the chorizo were excellent! We also really liked the ChÃ¨vre goat cheese, the pimento cheese spread, and the blue cheese. The food was filling, but not overly heavy. I'm looking forward to seeing future pairings with their brewed beers.

All of the staff we encountered were very friendly and also knowledgeable. The server that delivered our food knew about everything we had ordered, and told us about where it came from. Understandably so, the service was slightly slow because of the volume of people and it being a new establishment. Honestly, we barely even noticed because we were really enjoying the drinks, food, and atmosphere. So I don't really fault them much there. I loved the little book that our check arrived in, very cool detail!

We definitely are looking forward to visiting again! I think this place is a great addition to our neighborhood."}
{"text":"Love it, love it.. Local beer and great service. Funky bathrooms and nice murdering(tree trunk )  coasters.  Nice mustache bar tender! Own brewed beer ! Neighborhood smells like beer."}
{"text":"Great food friendly staff and AMAZING patio setup! 4 swamp coolers and completely shaded for comfortable hangouts outside! They are dog friendly and even have a local dog bakery's (dogseatingcake) treat hand made with their own spent grain on their menu! Great for work happy hour or a get together with the friends and family. They are always putting on fun events and raising money for local charities! Me. Helton and his crew do an amazing job and put out a great name for themselves!"}
{"text":"Ernest just let me in early, and made a recommendation of the Northeast IPA.  I may be in love.  This place is beautiful inside, and I can't say enough good things about the service, the people and the fantastic beer!  Dixie is as sweet as can be!  Service with her smile when I was early is welcome on a hot day!

Keep up the good work and you'll go far!!"}
