{"text":"I eat here for lunch most days. Food is always good and so is the music. The burgers, the specials and the fish and chips are always fantastic."}
{"text":"Let me just say I worked here for about two weeks and had some great insight to what happens in this bar behind the scenes. Such great insight I quit after working barely four shifts because I could not handle how this place was managed.
Firstly, the servers will get you unnecessarily intoxicated and charge you for more than you actually order. I have seen this happen many times with my own two eyes.
On top of that, the servers will also \"pretend\" to take shots with the customers. They will fill their shot glasses with water, and charge the customer for an expensive shot of vodka. Also seen this happen many times.
If you feel like this has happened to you, please understand that this is in fact extremely illegal and you can take action against the bar for serving you past a point of intoxication and also falsely charging you. If you are served too much at a bar, get in your car and get a DUI or in an accident, you CAN sue this place. 
Secondly, the kitchen and back room are absolutely disgusting. I wouldn't be surprised if some kind of rodent got a taste of everyone's food before they did.
Thirdly, the management here is absolutely insane. I was denied my paycheque and verbally harassed with extremely vulgar language and unnecessary yelling.
Also in my time working here, I was warned about this place by at least 3 different customers. At least three different customers came up to me to tell me that something is seriously wrong with this place, which unfortunately I found out the hard way.
The staff works while intoxicated. Most of the staff is on drugs, which explains why they mess up orders or do things unprofessionally. And although it's illegal, the servers will serve customers past a point of intoxication - even if said customer is driving home. 
Everything that happens in this bar is disgustingly unprofessional, unsanitary, and gross. If you order a drink, ask for no lemon wedge because a colony of flies lives inside the place where lemons and limes are kept. I wouldn't be surprised if this place has never before had a healthy and safety check. The back room is so disgusting I barely wanted to put dirty dishes back there, nevermind eat the food that comes from the kitchen. 
If you work close to here I highly recommend finding another bar that at least has some class, it would be worth the extra drive and at least you won't be eating sewer food and getting charged for more than you order. 
That's just my two cents, though."}
{"text":"I've never been for lunch or dinner, what I have gone for, is happy hour during the summer.  Sitting on the patio, having a few beers, and eating cheap food.  For the prices, I'd choose this little pub over Boston Pizza across the street.

Happy hour has your typical bar menu, wings, pizza, calmari, nachos, etc. and everything is half price. The quality of food is good (for bar food), and you can gorge yourself on fried goodness, cheese and all the things that will go straight to your gut and waistline.   

It's a bar, I'd say decor and cleanliness is comparable to a Firkin establishment, but common now, you're not really going to a bar for sanitary reasons right.  If you want a more restaurant type atmosphere, I'd suggest Boston Pizza, Montana's and Kelsey's nearby.  If you want a more local bar with more of a \"bar\" atmosphere, TV's and just want to kick back with some friends to have a cold one, McFiggin's isn't a bad joint.

DISCLAIMER: If you're expecting happy hour, I'm not sure if they have the happy hour menu everyday and throughout the year. I only go in the summer to sit on the patio.  I suggest you call ahead to confirm. 

I'm having a hard time remembering exactly which items on the happy hour menu were great, and which to avoid, but next time I go, I'll be sure to make a list and update this review."}
{"text":"I go out to Hoodoo's on Friday nights for the WPT's amateur poker league. 

(BTW: Everyone is welcome - both players that know the game and those that want to learn, Sign up by 7:30 pm to play in a Texas Hold-em Tournament, It's completely FREE to play and you can win prizes!)

The establishment itself is alright - Decent size, booths and tables in an area aside from the bar area, pool table, juke box, patio, plenty of free parking. Food prices are fair and so far the taste of the food has exceeded my expectations. (Try the Hoodoo Hogie if you like beef - it is really good!)

What I don't love about the place, and why it doesn't get four stars, is there is just something about the energy of the place that's funky. I know that sounds strange but it's something I cant quite put my finger on but... well, it is my review so there. ;) Also the volume of the music is WAY too loud for the number of patrons in the place. If they could turn the dining room volume down a few notches it might make it more enjoyable to be there."}
{"text":"So bad the lady and I laughed when we left.

Server was repeatedly asking for our drink order after we had made it, she would bring back food we didn't order that was meant for another table, and after taking our second drink order she was outside in a van making out with someone in a van.

The food wasn't that great, and we were given our bill before we were asked so we just paid and left.

I wouldn't recommend this place unless you want a laugh.

even though it was more a waitress issue than the food, the food still wasn't the best."}
