{"text":"I recommend This End Up to anyone that is in the little portugal area. The Burger known as the \"Better Mac\" is absolutely amazing. One of the best burgers in the city. Staff is always nice whether it's takeout or sitting down. The wings are also pretty fantastic done KFC style (Korean fried chicken) highly recommend this place it is fantastic. Fish tacos are also pretty good and fries are solid as well"}
{"text":"We finally decided to head to This End Up. I had the Better Mac and a Hibiscus Grenadine soda. It hit the spot so perfectly. Even their ketchup is homemade and it is awesome. The service was great and it really made me feels like my money was well spent. I will be back. For sure."}
{"text":"Without a doubt their Better Mac is one of the best burgers in town. They also make killer fish tacos and wicked cocktails with house made syrups. A super fun vibe with rocking food, a must visit."}
{"text":"When I walked into This End Up and the waitress looked like an anime character, I was sold. Anyone who can serve me a bad ass 'wich and have kool-aid color hair is my kind of someone. The beer and booze selection was top notch, esp for a place that's maybe got 8 tables (the menu is one page; the list of liquor is four--you do the math) and the chutney burger I got (suggested by the beardedflanneledsexyman bartender) was SO GOOD. I mean all those capitals, readers. And, dudes: if you're tyna find some cutie to take to one of the many live music bars/ dimly lit Portuguese bakeries nearby, go here. Legit there were only cute twenty-something girlies talking about their hookup problems. You could be the next gossiptopic! And, if not, at least you've filled your belly up with the most delectable of nosh food. This place is way, way more than alright. Six stars."}
{"text":"Visiting TO from Vancouver and came upon this quaint place.  To my strange vegetarian food likes there was a fair size veggie mains area and I chose the blta with real maple bacon instead of coconut chip bacon.  The sandwich was good, but the highlight were my fries that I had Dal added to...  Mmmm so good and I'm certain I will be craving these fries from afar now."}
{"text":"I'm so lucky that I live only 1.5 blocks away from this restaurant because I love this place! It has a great atmosphere, the servers are all friendly and lovely and the food is consistently amazing.

I love that This End Up always includes interesting flavour combinations for all of their dishes. For example, when I was eating meat, my favourites were the Chicken Thigh Banh Mi which comes with a blue cheese sauce and the Basa Fish Po'Boy which comes with a delicious lime sauce.

Now that I am a vegetarian, I appreciate that they can substitute all their meat burgers with their mushroom veggie patty. Their selection of vegetarian dishes is great as well!

I will always be a regular of This End Up!"}
{"text":"Fantastic burgers here. I also tried the fish tacos, they were good but I think I enjoyed the burger more.  They make their own condiments there, which is pretty cool and tasty.  I would recommend this place if you want a fancier burger joint but don't expect a greasy spoon here.  The decor is quite nice here."}
{"text":"I've been to This End Up twice now - on the recommendation of my co-workers.  I work around the corner, so its nice a close.  Both times I had the burger - so I will write my review based on that fact.  

OMG - the Burger is amazing!  Tasty as all heck!  And done to perfection... they put sauce on it which appears to be thousand islands dressing, and they add cucumber, and onions.  Its perfection on a bun.  The fries are pretty awesome too.

So if you are in the hood, and looking for a decent lunch take-out option ... ya!"}
{"text":"My boys love this place for this fish tacos and the \"better Mac\" - it's their signature burger - word play on the Big Mac.  I had the fish tacos here in the past and they are delicious - the type you get at grand electric. 
The only downfall is that 1 order is 3 tacos and you can't just order 5 or 7. 

I had the Baja fish sandwich - called the Po Boy. 
It was amazing :) 
Best fish burger that I've had in a very long time. I should have taken a pic, but it was so good that it didn't last long on my plate."}
{"text":"Seating: 
You enter and you seat yourself. They did greet us however they did not consistently greet every customer and you can see a lot come in confused as to whether they should wait or seat themselves. 

Service: 
Service was good. There were house specials and the server made recommendations on most popular items and her preference.

Food: 
The fish tacos was nice and crispy however the tortilla was soggy and it ripped when I picked it up. The taco overall was good but lacked flavours. I would recommend seen  lives for fish tacos, by far my favourite place. 

The chicken thigh taste like a KFC fried chicken in a Banh mi... Which was kind of weird ... 

The pork belly was delicious! A must try. The meat was tender and juicy. Very flavourful. 

The Kimchilli fries was tasty, more chilli then kimchi though. Even though I'm not a fan of kimchi it's worth a try.I'm not a fan of the fries itself they were soggy. 

The salad was nice and refreshing with the cucumber, a good side for all the fried food! 

Drinks: 

Raspberry lemonade was their house special with choice of rail. Delicious and refreshing. Tastes like it sounds.however there seem to be little to no alcohol taste in it. Which maybe a good thing for some!

UPDATE: SECOND VISIT

Service: This time around they greeted and also told us we could swat ourselves. This time seems more consistent as they did the same with every incoming customer. 

Food:
The BBQ pork skewers with peri peri sauce was their daily special and it was amazing. The pork was moist and the peri peri sauce had a nice kick. DEF MUST TRY!

Pulled beef shoulder poutine was another special. The beef is nice and tender, when combined with the cheese it just melts in your mouth. FOODGASM! 

The basa fish po boy taste like a filet-o fish from mc Donald's without the tartar sauce. The fish is nice and soft and the pickle comes through really nicely. However without the tartar sauce I felt like it was missing some flavour. 

The chutney burger is a nice and filling burger. The pork belly and the chutney works really well. The burger is juicy and very tasty. If you're hungry, this is worth a try! 

OVERALL, I would recommend this place for sandwich lovers! People who love a twist to their classic sandwiches. This is def a hipster spot! I STRONGLY RECOMMEND TRYING THEIR SPECIALS!"}
{"text":"After being rejected by countless restaurants due to reservations, we ended up here (no pun intended).

It's a tiny restaurant with a very warm decor.  Some might find the spaces a little tight but imo I think there's enough space for comfort.  I would not recommend this place for groups larger than 4.  You might have to wait a while for connected tables.

They have a small menu but has something for everyone.  I ordered the fried chicken thigh sandwich ($14) with fries.  The chicken wasn't too oily and the texture was perfect.  The sandwich bun was a little hard for me to bite on though; I prefer the soft buns.  Their fries are really good, similar to NY fries.  

They have a pretty good selection of wine and cocktails.

The food and drink are a little pricey, but I guess that's expected if you want quality food and service.

I would probably try the burger next time if I do come back.

Cheers!"}
{"text":"What a fantastic and cozy place!  I went with a part of 6 for dinner and cocktails.  We were welcomed by a very friendly and accommodating waitress, who took the time to explain the menu and drinks to us.  Everything, including the condiments are house made and very tasty.  The food was fantastic and presented beautifully - I highly recommend the Fish Taco's.  We ended our meal with apple fritters from San Remo's Bakery - so delicious! 

I can't wait to go back and try more dishes.  Thanks This End Up for making Girl's Night so FUN!"}
{"text":"Great food and family friendly.  I went with my son ( 2 years old ) and another couple with their child.  The food was solid and reasonably priced.  We had the wings as an app and the Chutney Burger with pork belly was awesome.  The portions are able and the staff great."}
{"text":"The highlight of This End Up is definitely its menu! A nice variety of options, but far from simple dishes. The service was also really friendly and efficient. Great sit down place for small groups or a date.

Recommendations:
- Chutney Burger
- Make a reservation if you're going at a busy meal time"}
{"text":"This End Up is one of my favorite new restaurants in the West end.

It's quick, casual enough for a sandwich with a friend at lunch, but nice enough for a drink and light dinner date. It's also got reasonable prices ($12 for sandwich and salad/fries), daily specials (pulled pork tacos and last time I was in), a happy hour on Saturday early evenings (2 for 1 pints), and the food is great.

I've had a bunch of the sandwiches, but my favorite is the Basa fish Po'boy. It tastes like a really good Fish Fillet from McDonalds. I mean that in a positive way. The fried chicken thigh and roast beef are also quite nice. The burger is a monster and goes well with the shoe-string fries.All the buns are really good.

The side salad is a dense arugula with cucumber, fennel, and sesame which is one of my favorite in the city. 

Only thing I don't like in the place is the photography on the walls and that the late night menu doesn't really have any sandwiches."}
{"text":"When a friend told me about this place,  I wasn't sure if it was a sit down restaurant or just a grab and go place. When I arrived there it was better than I expected. I had \"the better mac\" with fries and a salad. I was blown away at how fresh and hot everything was. The burger was juicy and just the right size. It actually tasted like a big mac only way better. The fries were hot and cooked perfectly and the salad was fresh and delicious. Service was great amd so was the atmosphere. I can't wait to go back. Hopefully less hung over next time."}
{"text":"Love love love This End Up - one of my favorite go-tos in the city. The food is big, fabulous, and playful, the staff are friendly, and the atmosphere is trendy but welcoming. I love the Bigger Mac (upscale twist on a Big Mac) but everything we've tried is great, and the specials are updated frequently.  If you haven't tried it - you should!"}
{"text":"Ventured down to the Federal for brunch as I wanted to share the yummy Caesar experience with my gf's. As I walked over to meet my friends who I had dropped off before searching for parking, I noticed a few plates that were drool worthy from patrons within This End Up.  I pulled my girls from the Federal and advised that they glance at the plates of the couple seated at the window and decide if we should head in or not.  Without saying a word they both went straight in after looking for a split second. 

We had the cali-coco BLT, mushroom barley veg burger, and cobb salad with extra bacon (this was a mistake, they give you a healthy portion of lardons, and smoky Caesars. It was all so good that I decided to order the mushroom barley burger for my vegetarian daughter and the hogtown cubano for her bf.  This boy hardly eats.  At first glance, he was worried about whether or not he could finish the sandwich so I set aside half the sammie.  After his first bite, he eyed the half that I set aside regretfully, so I passed it back onto his plate and his eyes lit up like it was xmas.  Needless to say, he finished the sammie.  Later that night, he asked where it came from and what it was called so he could taste it again soon.  

To summarize - I strongly recommend the cobb salad (without extra bacon), the smoky Caesar, hogtown cubano and the mushroom barley burger.  The cali coco blt was meh."}
{"text":"I came here with a friend for lunch.  The place has a very laid-back, clean and cozy vibe. 

I ordered the better mac and my friend ordered the fried chicken thigh burger.  Both were really yummy.  As the name suggests, the 'better mac' was actually a better and more succulent version of a big mac.  The special sauce used in the burger added a juicyness that ran throughout the whole double patty.  The fried chicken burger was very BIG with substantial portions of fried chicken used on each side of the cut sandwich. It was fried well in the sense that the batter was thick and crispy with a kick and the meat inside was tender.  The spicy sauce that they provided also had a lot of flavour, though it was not all that spicy.  A huge bowl of fries accompanied each meal. We were very satisfied ; )"}
{"text":"I am incredibly lucky that this awesome little shop is so close to my house.  It's so close that I find myself here probably a little TOO often.

Honestly, I couldn't have higher praise for this place.  I've never been disappointed with anything I have tried here.  

My go-to is The Better Mac, which they recently re-vamped...and made it even better than the original version that they had.  It's two 4-oz patties of delicious ground sirloin (I recommend getting it cooked medium), with pickles, lettuce, their version of the 'special sauce', and your choice of American or Cheddar Cheese.  Personally, I do the cheddar.  Always get it with the fries.  Oh...their fries.  Always delicious, and served up with a smokey ketchup and mayo.  Mix those two together and now we're talking.

Their fried chicken thigh sandwich is delicious as well.  The chicken is super crispy, and served up with a spicy bleu cheese sauce.  Heaven on a bun.

They always have great sandwich specials as well.  And their cocktails...oh...their cocktails.  They do a drink up right.  I can assure you.

Run, don't walk to this place.  It's on the small side if you are eating in, so if you are going with a big group, call ahead and make a reservation.  They do take out as well, which is an option I take advantage of on a regular basis.

Fave place on the Dundas West food scene....hands down."}
{"text":"Just perfect.

Service was excellent - attentive, informative.  Ambiance was nice (loved the art on the walls) and the seating was great.  Drinks were phenomenal - boozy, with all the best ingredients.  We shared the pork rinds, mixed meat and picked veg, and the Frito Pie.  I liked everything, although the meat and veg was the standout.  Prices on the menu include tax.  Finished it off with a boston cream doughnut that was TO DIE FOR.  

Would come back again, as a destination out of my way even, for the drinks and to try more things off the menu.  Very pleased!"}
{"text":"Very nice place. Accidentally stumbled upon this place for brunch.
Small little hipster place with great service and specials brought to the table on a blackboard. Our server was very friendly, she took our drink orders and showed us the specials.

We got 2 drinks, the smoked Caesar which was unique and I quite enjoyed the smoke flavour. It was spicy though so if you can't take the heat, it may be wise to choose another drink. We also got the raspberry lemonade. Taste was good, but the alcohol was very light and barely noticeable.

The food came at a good speed. We had the Baja Fish Taco's for the table. The taco's had great flavour, very light and refreshing. You could seriously taste the freshness of the fish and not a mouthful of batter.
We ordered 3 of the sandwiches: Pulled Pork Rendang Banh Mi, Hogtown Cubano, and the Fried Chicken Thigh. Personal favourite was the Hogtown with a delicious pork belly inside. The other two were also wonderful, the pulled pork inspired by the Vietnamese Banh mi was well made with good balance from the pickled veg and the Fried Chicken was full of flavour, a bit on the salty side however and reminded me a little of KFC.

The sides were great as well, the fries were great but the kimchi fries lacked a bit of kimchi and had a lot more of the chilli. The salad was my favourite; lightly dressed but very refreshing with the cucumber.

Overall I would give this place a 4.5 for great, delicious food and service. Food wasn't 100% but very close and for the price it is definitely worth it. If you love sandwiches and places that put a cool twist to them but still tastes good, then this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Amazing place. The burger is awesome, the decoration is awesome - everything's clean, and the attendants were super friendly and courteous. I got the The Better Mac and it was one of the best burgers I had. Absolutely recommended."}
{"text":"I wish there was a better word for ppl who are obsessed with cats and food porn bc hipster seems so corny to use for every restaurant in the city haha. Food's good here, Better Mac is great, my salad was whatever but I ordered it so my fault. Soda is good, service is obnoxious as usual, the end."}
{"text":"Brockton pork belly burger... Very yummy. Good cocktails selection, like the ambiance and the staff is really amazing. If you are in the area you should go."}
{"text":"The food was very tasty, the service quick n' friendly and atmosphere lively. The veg sammie is my fave. Will definitely come back for more! I plan on having every single cocktail on that menu. :)"}
{"text":"When this place first opened up, I came with a friend but was unable to eat almost anything as they had few vegetarian options at the time. 
Recently came back thinking I would just have a beer, but was pleasantly surprised when I ordered the lentil fries - could very possibly be the best fries I've ever had in my life. Also I believe they were something like $6 and very good portions - could be a meal on its own."}
{"text":"PROS: The food is great, and more restaurants should list prices tax-in.

I always get the Basa Fish Po'Boy ($14) and the fish is ample and done to perfection.

For those afflicted with SSS disorder (Side Selection Struggle: we are all affected and will stand strong together) a.k.a. hate choosing between fries (what you really want) and salad (what you feel like you should pretend to want) - the side salad is a refreshing arugula/cucumber mix that is definitely superior to the meager greens that usually accompany sandwiches, if that helps.

CONS: I wish there were more vegetarian options besides the lone California Club sandwich. And drinks are teeny-tiny for the price."}
{"text":"So good that I wish we live close to here!

I had the fried chicken thigh burger, and the chicken pieces were so big and spills out, that my bf thought it were extra chicken pieces 'on the side' of the sandwich. 

I tasted all of our sandwiches, and I like each and everyone of them! The 'better mac' and the 'chutney burger' was also really delicious. The fries were piping hot and the salad side was also really tangy and good. 

We were seated at the bar and it was slightly hard to have a conversation over the relatively loud music, and the price is slightly on the expensive side. That said, I know I will still be coming back for more!"}
{"text":"This place was really out of my way, I actually had plans to be elsewhere later but seeing as this might be my only shot to hit this place I had to due place closing.

It's a really small place, didn't help I was sitting across from the washroom but what can you do. 

I order the better Mac which is suppose to be their signuate. Usually I don't go with signature till a second or third meal but I don't have that option

The burger did mimic a big Mac but better hence the name juicy 4 oz double patty and what you expect from big mac, toppings.

The fries were too salty and beer was mediocre but overall a good filling meal"}
{"text":"Amazeballs. 

Chutney burger was incredible and definitely get their fries. We couldn't decide if they were a vessel for the smoked paprika ketchup or vice versa. 

Burger, fries and salad, tea = 16.00 after 18% tip.

YUMMMM"}
{"text":"Visited today (April 22 2013) around 2:00pm, wasn't sure what to expect, but heard good things about the fried chicken thigh sandwich.

I must say it was DELICIOUS! I loved it, I compared it to the one at the County General, and there is no comparison. This End Up all the way.

Also had a fantastic Ginger Soda, see my pics.

There was some miscommunication with the kitchen regarding my order and it took about 20 minutes longer than it should, as I was off work today, I had nothing to do, and didn't mind in the least. 

The chef/owner? came out to personally apologize for the delay and gave me 50% off my bill, 
Wonderful Service and they have earned a repeat customer.

I really enjoyed the decor and the bartenders were very friendly, also super clean restrooms.

This place is awesome

Go Please.

They didn't have dougnuts today, as San Remo Bakery is closed on Mondays, where the doughnuts are sourced. I have heard awesome things about these doughnuts, so I will be making a stop at both places quite soon"}
{"text":"I'm always up for new places opening up in this neck of the woods. Stopped in and managed to get a table on a Saturday night so ordered up a few pints, a poutine, and a burger. The interior of the place is cozy but actually kind of tacky with a mish mash of stylings including what seems to be almost cliche nowadays in the sense of antique signs and such on the exposed brick walls.

It took a while to get our food and when the burger came out, despite it being ordered Medium Well, it was literally bloody to  the point that after biting into it the bottom half of the bun was a soaked up red blood color. This would normally deem a 1 to 2 star rating in itself but they were apologetic, took it back and made it the right way and even comped a couple of the pints to make up for it so I'll give the place on the whole a 3 star final tally as their intentions are good and they owned up to the mistake. The burger still isn't even in my top 5 in the city, but I'd say was good enough for its price tag to deem worth it if prepared correctly."}
{"text":"Food was great, would definitely come back for the food. 
Loved the \"chili fries\". Portions are great and great flavours.
Burger was great.

What caught me off guard were the drinks. The prices didn't reflect on the drinks at all. Some of the drinks were just full of ice (to give the illusion your getting allot), and then other drinks were just so \"watered\" down.

Definitely come here, enjoy the food and order wine or beer instead!"}
{"text":"My wife and I used to have a go-to place on Roncy for a last minute date or those days when you just don't feel like cooking. This place is not evolving with the times so  we were excited to find a new cool place in our hood \"This End Up\".

You immediately feel welcome and comfortable upon entering. The staff and managers are very friendly and willing to stay and chat or explain the menu and specials. They play great tunes in the background at a reasonable level, a big deal for me as I like the ability to talk to the people at my table and not yell.

There are great food and drink specials everyday. As a beer drinker I especially like the $5 pint special. I have a problem paying $9 for a premium pint (I'm half Scottish, what can I say). The food is excellent. The Baha Fish Tacos are amazing, you get 3 huge tacos with red cabbage slaw and lots of cilantro. Throw a bunch of house made hot sauce on them and BAM! I've had their Mexipacho soup, a play on Gazpacho with a chili flavour and tortilla crisps, YUM! The Pickles and Sticks are a great starter. House made pickled asparagus and olives with grilled sausages. The Chicken Pops were an unexpected surprise. 3 drumsticks with a spicy Asian flare.

There are quite a few more specials I've had that are not on the regular menu that were great.

Glad to have you in our hood \"This End Up\"."}
{"text":"Sorry, I was underwhelmed by the fried fish po'boy...particularly after a photo of it in the Village Post left me salivating for a taste. It just didn't come together for me, and it certainly didn't feel like the gourmet sangwich I was hoping for.

Ditto the \"Pickles and Sticks\" (pickles and grilled sausages) which sounded so damn promising!

My negroni also wasn't anything to write home about.

BUT I'm still giving them 3 stars because: the pork rillette special was very good; the Clover Club cocktail was delicious; and the service was friendly."}
{"text":"Oh my. What a great little place that serves well-made food.

I was a bit disappointed with the chicken wings, but that is maybe because it was overshadowed by the amazing buger. 

$12 (tax included!) for a 7 oz. BURGER and an excellent side salad??? Such a good deal. The side salad is not a pathetic bed of mixed greens and a simple vinegrette. No, this side salad is arugula-based, and tossed with lightly pickled cucumber and fennel. The dressing is aromatic and sesame-y. The burger was large and the flavour was great. 

The PORK BELLY BANH MI had a really distinct smokey flavour, unlike any other smoked meat I've had. 

For drinks, we had THE MUTT and THE RAMONA. Both were boozy and decently-priced. 

The winner of the night was definitely the burger. Burger snobs should give this one a try."}
{"text":"The food is creative and delicious. I had a smoked meat sandwich and it was succulent together with an unusual salad of pis-en-lits and pickles. It is comfortable, clean, friendly and the service is prompt."}
{"text":"This End Up belongs to the category of fairly casual restaurants that are actually trying hard culinarily that will eventually move Toronto to the same category as Chicago and other major American cities.  

The VIBE: Casual, trendy, a little hipster, but not overwhelming.  Little bit of retro with specials on movable chalkboards.  The seating is rather limited. The couple times I've been there, they've been configured for a large group which left maybe 5 or 6 other 2-4 tops.  Quite a bit of bar seating as well if you're with a small group..nice noise levels.

The FOOD:  Well, this is generally where they shine.  They're both being a bit adventurous and turning the flavor up a few notches on old favorites. The fish tacos, while a bit pricy, shine from the tasty fish in them.  The kimchili cheese fries are disgustingly delicious as they sound, and the chicken wings have some nice heat to them, plus real chickens were harmed in the making.  My friends raved about the chutney burger.  On my last visit, I ordered a burger special and was somewhat disappointed...for making a big deal about asking how my burger should be cooked, I found the patty to be rather dried out and limp, as if it had been par-cooked some hours in advance (we were the second group to arrive that night).

The DRINKS:  This bar knows their cocktails.  They're using SHRUBS* for godsakes!  
*A SHRUB is a cocktail mixer in which the flavor of a fruit or herb is extracted using vinegar...it's a cool notion if you haven't tried one.

The drinks here have always been great, and I've ordered off-menu classic cocktails without an issue.  This task has been quite an issue for a lot of Toronto restaurants, which either lack a standard ingredient library or have poorly-trained mixologists.  You don't have to worry about either here.  

The Beer selection is pretty underwhelming.

OVERALL: I'm starting to really like this place.  I still can't tell if they take reservations or not, as I've gotten conflicting answers...so give it a try.  It's casual, not too expensive, does some interesting and generally tasty food, and does a mean cocktail!"}
{"text":"I got the Burger Week's burger which has a pork belly topped on top of the patty. It was extremely delicious! It smelled and tasted like bacon but better because of fatty pork belly! I can't say much about their regular burgers because I only took a bite of the Better Big Mac and it tasted decent to me. The fries were also addictive! I ate my own share and my friend's! I'm very interested in trying their other burgers if I get a chance to come by this place again."}
{"text":"I like this neighbourhood joint. It's small and quite busy so I hope that continues and they make it for the long haul. My only real complaint is that they close on Tuesday's!

Food is lovingly prepared here. The fish tacos are to die for. Really nice pieces of breaded fish served with a purple cabbage slaw, creamy mayo and slice of lime on lovely soft corn tortillas - yum! I crave these often and rarely go for anything else. The rest of the menu is pretty meat heavy but I've taken both my BF, my BFF and an out of town BFF there and they all loved their meals. The burger, the sandwiches, the fries, all get rave reviews. As I say, this food is made with love! And the prices are fair.

The cocktails leave a little to be desired for me. Perhaps I'm just a purist but an $11 caesar seems crazy to me and I didn't like the seasoning at all which is what I'm assuming cost me the extra money for it. The wine selection is quite good and I'll stick to that from now on. 

It can be a bit chilly in the front half of the restaurant when the door opens and closes frequently but in the summer the windows are completely open making for a nice Dundas view and casual meal.

I wanted to add that my BF thinks they have some of the best wings in the city - and he's kind of a wing snob so he does not dole wing praise out lightly!"}
{"text":"Great food! Neat variety of sandwiches that are all done well. Sides are also great (fries are perfect, and side salads are sizeable) and the alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks are definitely worth trying. We brought a large and eclectic group of people here once and everyone loved their food. 

They also take reservations, which is rare in this neighbourhood and very much appreciated."}
{"text":"Tried coming here for lunch at 11:40 on a Wednesday but they don't open until 12:00. REALLY!!!!! That has got to be one of the stupidest things I've heard from a restaurant. I have gone against my standards and wrote a review without even trying the food. I ended up eating at the the federal a few doors down that was busy at 11:40."}
{"text":"3.5 to 4 stars 

VIBE 
I really like the non-chalant, cool laid back vibe here. I also really like the vintage signs they have in the back. It's really inviting here. The owner, Karen, is also really nice and came over to talk to us and tell us her favourites on the menu. 

WE ATE 
Chicken Wings - they had a bit of a spice and a kick to them. They weren't TOO spicy but spicier than normal. They were good but I think it would have been better with more sauce. 

Oyster Po Boy - I don't think I've ever had a po boy sandwich before and an oyster one at that. It was fried. I did like the combination of the flavours of the ketchup and the mayo but maybe the actual main star was missing for me. This one was a miss for me. 

You can get fries and a side salad for a little bit extra. These were great! The fries were crispy with just enough salt on them and a good portion size. The salad had a lot of cucumber, which I loved. It was refreshing and light. 

Frito Pie - this is their version of nachos and it works! It was a really nice surprise. All of the flavours hit the mark and the portion size was on the smaller size. 

WE DRANK 
The Shoutout - cachaca, amaro, pimm's, pineapple, lime - this had a good kick to it. That said, it was not as boozy as the mojito.

The Mojito - I think this is one of the strongest mojitos I've had! I also like that you really do get value for your money here with the portion size. Ours was 2 oz for $10 served in a mason jar. Cute touch. Nice surprise. You can get basically double the size for $18. 

*I would love to see Sangria on the menu and think they would do it justice. Especially if small groups come here in the summer. Or maybe I'm just craving sangria? 

OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK 
I do also like that you can get a number of the menu items for late night. The bar feels like a cooler version of a pub. I would definitely recommend this as a casual date spot and I think it's perfect for a first date. It's not trying too hard but it cares."}
{"text":"Delicious burger! I got the Real Mac. It was like a McDonald's Big Mac in a way but much better and healthier. They freshly grind their meat so you can get it medium rare. Delicious! Salad, fries... So good! 

As for drinks, I got the most expensive glass of wine on the menu and it was okay. Kind of disappointing actually. I would've liked to have tried their cocktails.

I highly recommend it for their burger. The accompanying salad and fries were also quite delicious."}
{"text":"One of the best burgers I have ever had in Toronto, I would recommended this place for anyone looking to sink there teeth into a burger and fresh cut fries. The only reason I don't give this place full stars is because of the lack of beer choices, other then that this place is KILLER!!"}
{"text":"Cool vibe, and cool music here at this end up. Hipster, Dundas street crowd and other looking for good home comfort food. The fish tacos were the star. Soft velvety fish inside and a soft shell tortilla topped with avocado and shredded beets. The Bah Mi sandwich disappointed with dry meat, and a poor veg to meat ratio. We also had the fresh watermelon juice- lemonade. A great date spot or couples night out.

{"text":"Ordered the burger here not expecting it to basically replace one of my favourite burger joints in Toronto. Burger came up within 10 minutes of ordering and was a little on the rare side of my medium asking, still all good. Lots of flavour, the fries even had a smokey taste to them - awesome! Girlfriend had the vegetarian and was extremely pleased. Burgers can also be made vegan (the bun had egg in it). 

Beer was a little bit pricier at a base price of 6 bucks (50 was on the menu) going upwards to 10 for the nicer brews. The cocktails look great, and even had a cocktail special \"Meyer in a mason\". Yup, a cocktail in a large mason jar - I'm extremely into that.

Must go, will be heading back here frequently with even more frequent trips to the gym."}
{"text":"This year, I was only able to go to one restaurant for The Grid's Burger Week. After plowing through the list participating restaurants very thoroughly, we finally picked This End Up, a cute little sandwich joint in the west end of the city. The place seemed very popular for the weekday lunch crowd. 

I tried one of their spring cocktails - aptly named Spring Rose ($8) with lillet rose, ginger, lavender syrup. While my friend commented that it smelled like soap, I personally really liked the gingery kick and didn't mind the floral notes. 

The burger week feature was the Chutney Burger ($5)- 3.5 oz of fresh ground chuck, pork belly, aged white cheddar, umami mayo, tomato & apple chutney, and arugula. $8 will also get you a side of fries, which were thin, crispy and absolutely addictive! I ordered a side salad instead of fries for an additional $4- arugula, pickled fennel and sweet onion, cucumber, toasted sesame seeds all doused in a tangy house vinaigrette. Given the fattiness of my burger, I was glad to have this salad to provide a bit of nutritional balance. 

Now, onto the actual burger! The first thing that struck us was its small size. I guess it was significantly smaller than the other $5 burgers we've had at burger week last year. But in the end it didn't really matter because the flavours certainly made up for its size. The patty, although perhaps a little more cooked than I would've preferred, was amazingly juicy, and a huge slab of pork belly added a new dimension of delicious fattiness to the whole burger. I would not have been able to finish the burger if it was any bigger! Nevertheless, it was absolutely delicious and entirely satisfying. 

On the whole, I had a very enjoyable burger experience at This End Up, and would definitely come back to try out other sandwiches!"}
