{"text":"This place rocks!  My clients and I were looking for a place to eat dinner this week and Soul Cafe came up.  They have eaten there many times and were complimenting the uniqueness of some of their dishes.  We all decided this had to be the choice if I have never been. What a neat colorful place tucked up in North Scottsdale.  Lots of color and beautiful artwork.  Food with a Mexican flair!  I had one of the best Bloody Mary's in my life!  Served with jalapeno vodka and hot bacon, unbelievable!  And for dinner a Mexaloaf (meatloaf) with a kick.  More bacon, corn chips and salsa mixed in topped with chipotle sauce on a bed of mashed potatoes.  This is now one of my monthly returns when i come to town."}
{"text":"What a treat! Stopped in for breakfast and we had the red chili omelette and my wife had the wet burrito. Great atmosphere, but the food was fantastic! We are definitely coming back, and very soon. Do yourself a favor and put this restaurant on your list when in the area."}
{"text":"You must try the shaved ice here!  The cafe was mostly full on Friday night.  After ordering at the counter (cash or debit only), I was given a buzzer that buzzed when the order was ready.  There is a table where you can pour your own water.  I wish this would catch on at Second Cup or Starbucks.    At first, I thought $7 for a small shaved ice was overpriced but that idea quickly disappeared.  Unlike the standard bingsu you can find at many of the cafes in the Yonge and Finch area, the ice here is light and fluffy.  Somehow the flavour is evenly mixed into the ice so you can still taste it at the bottom of the bowl.  The mochi has the perfect level of chewiness and complements the red bean powder and ice well.    The small size came with two spoons something this good is not meant to be shared!  :)  Just order two smalls so you can try another flavour.  Parking at this small plaza can be a mess at night since there is a pretty popular Korean restaurant next door.  You may have better luck parking at the school a few minutes walk West on Drewry.    This is the perfect summer dessert and I will be coming back."}
{"text":"My son and I tried to have lunch at Soul Cafe recently on a quiet Thursday in August.  I had been here previously with friends and the food was good, so I returned albeit somewhat releuctantly.  The reason I was unsure of trying Soul Cafe again is because the service was so poor on two prior occassions.  The third time was worse than the previous two.   My son and I left before we could order - we waited 15 minutes without menus, water or even a greeting after we were shown to our table.  The restaurant was perhaps 1/3 full.    I approached the hostess and she returned my request for menus, service, with a blank stare.  I approached the waitress who was just standing near the hostess stand and she responded with a facial expression that in words I would not type.  There are so many good and friendly atmosphere restaurants in Scottsdale - try them, and avoid this unless you want to be ignored."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service every time! Best fluffy pancakes, plain are my favorite. Love the green chili"}
{"text":"This was my first time at this restaurant I thought it would give it a try The food prices were reasonable the menu was a good size Our waiter some young fellow named Kenny did a wonderful job with us he was very bright and smart not to mention Hilarious The place was fantastic we had a great time I would recommend this place to anybody"}
{"text":"Soul Cafe is a great find!  The food never disappoints each time I go to this restaurant.  My favorite is to go on Wednesday nights for their Fried Chicken plate special.  The chicken is so tender and non-greasy.  They also have a fish special on Friday nights as well.   They have great entertainment too.  It is so nice to find a place with great food and live music.   I've only visited for lunch and dinner, but friends of mine have told me their breakfasts are great too.  I was told their Chilaquiles are out of this world.  I will have to check it out."}
{"text":"A very poor experience. We took our son in law for a birthday dinner. We go to Soul Cafe often. And we were  excited to introduce him to the place via all u can eat fried chicken. Yet tonight everything was off. Very poor service. Extra fried chicken took 20 minutes. Waiters attitude was flip and absent. Plus there were very few people there. So no excuse for poor service. We were disappointed."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch today and got the Arizona cheesesteak with some sweet potato fries. Everything was perfect. Now I'm waiting for pie!  Great experience."}
{"text":"I have been here twice for dinner. The first time was great and though expensive, I probably would have given it four to five stars based on how good my dinner was that night (scallops and dirty rice). I recently went on a Saturday night with a large group of people however and had a bad enough experience that I won't be back. About half of our party thought their food was 'ok' (including me). The other half said it was good. The other problem was the ridiculously blaring music in this tiny place. You couldn't hear each other talk despite yelling and this is in an expensive restaurant! We complained and were told it is music night and they have a dance floor. Well the place was about 25% full and no one ever danced. Maybe if they turned down the music they would get more customers on a Saturday night. I won't be one of them though! I would have given it a 4-5 on first visit and a 2 on second so it's now a 3."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and such a cozy place to dine casually and listen to live music too!  Everything we have tried from pizza to pot roast to green chile stuffed rigatoni is amazing!  What a gem here in Scottsdale! We go on Thursdays and love love love listening to live music by Marley Taylor!  Soul Cafe is my favorite restaurant!"}
{"text":"Well, my favorite breakfast place just joined the mundane!  The quality and service still remain, but my favorite part of eating there, the weekend menu of surprise breakfast dishes is dead, the new menu is just like other breakfast places.  Please bring back the weekend imagination!"}
{"text":"Got off to a slow start when our waiter didn't realize we had been seated in his section.  I predicted he would come up with a cover story about not knowing why our waiter didn't come, but that he would say he would take care of us :)  He was young so we will forgive him for not knowing this is a common excuse used by waiters.  Once we finally got service the rest of the meal went well, with prompt friendly service for the remainder of our meal.    We both ordered the special banana pancakes and enjoyed them.  Oh by the way they are huge, we wished we had just split an order and tried something else along with them.   The menu had a variety of creative breakfast options and they all looked good."}
{"text":"Food was great but the service was terrible. My friend and I sat for 15 solid minutes waiting for recognition. I finally asked the hostess to send someone over to clean our table and perhaps offer us water and coffee. When the waiter finally came over, it kept going downhill.  No refills offered on coffee. Forgetting to put our order in. Orders coming out at different times.  Everything took forever. I live in Scottsdale and will head back to The General Store for coffee. Best service up here, hands down."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night and was immediately seated.  This place was quite busy during our stay, most customers will tend to stay for a long time and chat.  Personally I don't think it's worth the wait if I did not get a seat.    Though the service and staff was very friendly,  the food was not so great unfortunately.  Our party of 4 ordered 2 different flavor bingsu, it was nothing special, just a few different toppings on top of the shaved ice. Some other bingsu I've tried go the extra mile and offer more toppings at the bottom of the plate, however this one did not.  The portion size is decent, a small is shareable for a party of 2 for average eaters  Overall this review is strictly based on the bingsu.  Soul cafe your ordinary dessert place, worth a try if you're in the area, but probably wouldn't come back a second time though."}
{"text":"Lots to like about this restaurant.  Went there for their Friday fish and chips special.  Menu looked really good.  They had very good music that night.  Good craft beer selection and wines.  Have to go back soon, but it is out of town but a good choice for locals in north Scottsdale."}
{"text":"This is the best breakfast ever! The pancakes are to die for. Iced coffee so perfect .  The owner, Eric, is so sweet and accommodating! Can't wait to come back, probably tomorrow."}
{"text":"The best buttermilk fried chicken ever and this is coming from a girl who does not typically like let alone order fried chicken! No one, I repeat no one has a better breakfast north of the 101!"}
{"text":"This is our most favorite place; the food is always consistently delicious; Service is always impeccable.  We have our favorite Bartenders, Conner & Sean.  They are the Best.  Everyone we take there just raves about it and are so glad we shared the dining experience with them.   I Love Fish Friday's.    Keep up the good work Soul Cafe."}
{"text":"Eric was AMAZING, the breakfast was unbelievable. We had the lemon ricotta and strawberry oatmeal pancakes and the wet burrito.  Super super super!"}
{"text":"I come here for breakfast every weekend, Pancakes are giant, fluffy and amazing. Try the corn beef hash too. Great!"}
{"text":"We have enjoyed Sheila's food for over two years, always delightful!"}
{"text":"I have been here twice now on my last to visits to Arizona. They have not let me down! They have an amazing lobster mac and cheese! Their mojitos were pretty awesome too! Def will be one of my stops when I'm in town!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! They offer indoor and outdoor seating, and only a 5 minute wait time. It has a low-key hipster feel to it, with dimmed lighting and opened spaces- cement and wood material with rustic colors, yet a higher-end feel. The service was great! Jena was our server and she was sweet, quick, checked on us periodically, offered her opinion on drink and food choices, and was overall great. Definitely a great place to come for brunch, especially to feel a little private but still apart of a good crowd! I recommend the coffeetini and the heavenly hash- both to die for"}
{"text":"Amazing Chilaquiles & eggs. Fantastic service and a great menu. I would have taken a picture but it was so good I ate it before it crossed my mind!!! This is a must try."}
{"text":"Staff were more concerned about carrying on their conversations than waiting on their customers.  The food was okay but the kitchen is very slow. Everyone here needs training an attitude adjustment and management. Too bad."}
{"text":"Very good chicken, the food is very good and the service is OK. It's a good day atmosphere. The live music is a little too loud but you can try to sit away from it."}
{"text":"great food, exellent staff, nice atmosphere...recommend this place"}
{"text":"Eric was an amazing server! We were able to try the amazing lemon pancake even though it was 30 mins after breakfast.the food was really good, large portions and very unique!"}
{"text":"The food is outstanding and creative. Try the granola and raspberries pancakes for breakfast.  Dinners offer unusual sauces and delicious combinations. Try the halibut cheeks. The only downside are the prices which seem a little high."}
{"text":"Several people in our party ask to substitute and they said yes, but my wife cannot have jalapeño corn cakes and they refused to even offer mashed potatoes when they did offer to others.  Mahi Mahi was dry and over cooked.   Everyone else liked their food but their prices have gone up a lot.   No soup nor salad  with meal.  No bread served either...cost extra."}
{"text":"Just discovered this place for breakfast.  Fantastic selection of true Southwestern food, and a great staff.  Can't wait to try out the dinner menu!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Gets packed on Sunday's for good reason! Food is consistently good, service is prompt and welcoming which is sometimes a problem for gay patrons and their version of Eggs Benedict is so bomb!"}
{"text":"First time trying this cafe after dinner. Ordered a apple cinnamon tea and shared a strawberry shortcake with a friend. The cake tasted like your average, however I did like the strawberry jam that was inside (possibly handmade?). Nonetheless, a decent place to grab yourself a drink and dessert. The decor seemed to be outdated (walls had marks on them etc.)"}
{"text":"Arrived here with high expectations due to a few coworkers high spoken words about their menu and service. We had an unreal dining experience tonight at soul cafe. Enjoyed the clams, olives, blackened mahi mahi, and blueberry pie. Our server Eric, assisted in making these menu choices with excellent ingredient description and a genuine review. Service and food truly could not have been any better. Needless to say, expectations were met and surpassed! We will return to try out the other menu options that made it so hard to choose. Can't wait! Thanks again Eric and Soul Cafe."}
{"text":"We waited an hour an ten minutes for our food.  Sadly, when it did arrive (after 3 requests to speak to the manager) it was close to being inedible.  The scallops arrived cold and with grit in them.  The medallions were very overcooked and dry.  The lamb was like shoe leather and didn't come with the proper side dishes.    There are so many other good restaurants within 5 miles of this place.  So my advice . . . . choose someplace else to eat.  You'll be much happier."}
{"text":"Great customer service. Dog friendly patio. The best gluten free lemon ricotta pancakes the size of your head. Maybe bigger. So so good!"}
{"text":"Where do I start? First of all you must order anything with the green pork chile on it! Oh my. Last time we were in we ordered a tub of it to go home with us. It is fantastic and I could literally eat my way out of a bowl of it. Second of all the pumpkin pancakes are out of this world and I'm not normally a fan of pancakes, so that's saying a lot. We've always had great service every time we go. The wet burrito is to die for (and of course it's covered in the green pork chile). We have two 5 year old daughters and they are always treated well; the servers bring them special kid forks and coloring books with crayons. We highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant twice now and I will definitely be back and highly recommend it. I originally went to Soul Cafe because the band WHAT4 was playing there and I love to hear them play. But I will be going back for the band AND the food! Plus the service was excellent. The staff was incredibly helpful, friendly, and quick, even when they were busy.   The menu has a good variety and changes so you can experience something new each time you go. There are feel good favorites and then there are some fun twists on old standards that must be tried. The green chili smothered ravioli is delightful! My husband and I made the mistake of sharing it and fought over the last bite. We also tried the shrimp caprese pasta, fried chicken, margherita pizza, and the scallops with asparagus mint risotto. Each one was delicious!  What set this place as one of my new favorites is the way that they treat my toddler. Toddlers are not always a restaurant's favorite customer, but all of the servers would smile or say hi or give him a high five when they went by. They offered him a coloring book and crayons. And then something I have never seen before happened. Much to my AMAZEMENT they brought out a toddler fork and spoon with his (delicious) macaroni and cheese. That was incredible!! That they would think of their littlest customers in that way really shows the care that they put into their business and sets them apart.  I will also mention that it was very clean, including the bathrooms. Always important!  Cafe Soul is a great spot that we can go with the kids or as a date night. The atmosphere, the staff, the owner, and most certainly the food make this a place that I would feel comfortable recommending to even the pickiest of people."}
{"text":"Definitely get there early! We had no wait, but had to sit in the bar...no complaints here as i tend to gravitate towards the bar atmosphere anyway.  I had the lemon ricotta pancakes, which were fluffy and delicious although WAY too much food! Side of bacon was complimentary to the sweet ricotta. Just the right amount of salty to balance it all out. 2 $6 mimosas weren't bad either, but get it without the Chambord, it unnecessary.   Hey had strawberry granola pancakes with eggs and bacon. Pancakes were \"ehh\" as he said, and like mine WAY too big. Couldn't even finish half! Bacon was delish but eggs were clearly carton egg beaters. you could tell by the coloring and the watery trail they left on the plate.  Over all, its a nice little spot, that seems to be a hidden gem of sorts, we will be back and will probably split pancakes next time! $50+ for two breakfasts with mimosas was a bit much but now we know splitting a plate is adequate!"}
{"text":"Major, major screw-up and no explanation given.  On a busy night we waited 1 hour and 45 minutes for our food, talked to our server twice and the manager twice. The 2nd manager conversation (after 1 1/2 hours) was \"if you give me 15 minutes I will have your food\".  After waiting an additional 20 minutes we still did not have food.  The manager offered $50 comp cards but were of no value or interest as all of us were from out of town."}
{"text":"I love everything about this place and wish I had found it sooner!!! Probably the most fun breakfast in Scottsdale. Have also tried lunch and dinner...never disappointed....Great food and service!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast! Try the Lemon Ricotta Pancakes - yum! But bring your appetite, they were huge!"}
{"text":"Soul Cafe is one of my favorite places to eat.  When in town, I make sure to visit at least twice. Why? the food is phenomenal. It's home cooking with a twist, it's got Soul. Today, after a bad day, I stopped for breakfast,....at lunchtime. They were more than accommodating, the whipped up the best omelet + a heavenly biscuit. I was transported home to mom making something special knowing I had a bad day at school.  At night, I love the trout, and I'm not a fish person, but its one of my favorites along with the martini's (always creative and fun)! The food lacks inspiration? NOT! I travel often to major cities and have the opportunity to try many things and the Soul Cafe still ranks on my top to go foodie list ;)"}
{"text":"Thanks to Restaurant Week, we managed to make our way to the cafe. Their prix fix menu for Restaurant Week included many gluten free options, & there regular menu had plenty more. Very attentive staff, relaxed atmosphere & live music on a Saturday night."}
{"text":"Loved our server, Christana. Lovely young lady to talk to, outstanding service, efficient, knowledgable on the menu, and made great recommendations. Every other table she was at seemed to be enjoying her as well. Our breakfast was pretty yummy, however we will not be back. Busy Sunday and \"Chef Sheila\" must not be able to handle it because our experience was ruined by the constant SCREAMING that was so easy to hear from the kitchen. Our table was not even that close to the kitchen either!! Profanity and just top of your lungs yelling, made me pretty uncomfortable and I could tell others around felt the same. Pretty disgusted to know some employers think it's okay to treat employees yet alone another human like that. Upon leaving I asked the hostess about it and she confirmed it was the chef and said things get stressful and that's how it's handled. Common Sheila, it's called respect."}
{"text":"Ordered the fish and chip Friday lunch special.  Hands down the worse and strangest fish I've ever seen.   They served small strips of fish that were hard solid masses, the fish was an off putting beige color, the texture was chewy more like beef then fish.  The accompanying waffle fries were ok, pale blond in color, so not very appetizing but tasted ok.  A small side of cold slaw was also just ok. The  waiter described this dish as flakey white fish and one of their most popular items.   So, I'm not sure what happened here...I can't believe anyone could have found my plate of food editable.  Too bad as the batter was tasty and was they only component of that dish that was done well. Being with others dinners it's hard to say much, but did tell the waiter the fish was not right, he took my plate and said he'd show it to the kitchen, we never heard another word, and the item was shown on the bill and charged at full price. Also we were told no deserts are offered at lunch, (I was still hungry) they are only prepared for dinner, unless there were \"leftovers\" from the night before.  We never heard back about any leftovers.  Had to laugh, leftovers is not a word you often hear at a restaurant.....but that might explain the very strange fish....leftovers! Other dining companion had salad, with dressing on the side, it was okay but she did need to ask for a different dressing as the one offered was too thick to pour, the texture was like mayo, so again it was unappetizing.  She said the salad was ok.  So all in all, in my opinion, a poor showing by this establishment."}
{"text":"Great menu selection. Different than the ordinary traditional choices. I had to try the seasoned meatloaf wrapped in bacon... Yum From others at our table I tasted the buttermilk chicken breast and the salmon - both were excellent. Can't wait to go back and have breakfast someday."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to the Soul Cafe Wednesday evening for the first time.  From the moment you step in the atmosphere is really great.  We immediately liked the vibe.  Mark, a live musician, was playing music, and it was just the right volume. He chose songs that any age group would enjoy. It was a great surprise. Our incredible server, Eric, recommended fantastic dishes and was warm, welcoming and attentive. We had pretzel bites as an appetizer. I had salmon as a main course and my husband had the fried chicken.  All of which were delicious and something we would definitely come back for. I guess we didn't leave enough room for dessert because we hear their pies are scrumptious too but we couldn't eat another bite.  We can't wait to go back again.  Ask for Eric if you go.  He's really amazing!"}
{"text":"The best Bingsoo place ever! I've been to LA, NY Korea towns and their Bingsoo places. Yet, Soul Cafe beats them all. Must try! The new owner knows what she is doing!"}
{"text":"Upon making a reservation for Mardi Gras, we arrived on time and waited for 2 hours for our food. The waitress did not answer to our needs. The manager said they had run out of rice. They continued to state our food was coming out while other parties came, ordered, ate and left. Their only attempt at compensation was a bottle of wine. We never received our food. We will never go back."}
{"text":"Hostess tried seating us in six person booth, front of performers, music so loud you couldn't hear her response when we asked for a different table. We were informed that all free tables for two and four away from noise were reserved. Not a problem, but we had a reservation. We left and hostess didn't apologize or try to offer alternatives. Suggest that if you go, be specific at time of reservation as to where you want to sit. Poor experience and staff showed lack of interest in service."}
{"text":"Good restaurant overall. Breakfast is there best meal. Thankful they are in our neighborhood."}
{"text":"We LOVE this place. Found it by accident on afternoon and have returned 3 times in the past 3 weeks. Large portions of delicious appetizers and main dishes. Tried the seasonal dessert \"death by pumpkin\" ...Awesome. 4 people could easily share this dessert. Found our service attentive without being bothersome.  Other than $$$$ restaurants this is #1 in our books."}
{"text":"Pretty good food, but its overpriced.  The burger is big, but $13 is a bit much for a burger and fries.  The regular sandwiches come with plain potato chips, we were charged an extra $1 for fries with no warning.  Really?  An extra charge for fries with a chicken sandwich thats already $10... with no mention of the upcharge.  Not sure why these 'neighborhood' places feel like they have to charge so dang much.  Overall the food was pretty good, but too expensive.  Probably won't be back.  Maybe the next restaurant to move in there will be better."}
{"text":"I live 1.5 miles from this place and now regret not coming in sooner.  Our server, Eric, perfectly timed our service and was not bothered by our lingering over coffee on Saturday night while we enjoyed the music.  The food was exceptional.  Don't forget the pie."}
{"text":"I absolutely love their breakfast! Their pancakes are fantastic and huge. Other favorites are the wet burrito and the crazy cowboy...the pork chili verde is amazing."}
{"text":"A long time customer, having migrated with Sheila and John from the initial Carefree Highway location, I am delighted that this once small restaurant has blossomed into the ultra-successful neighborhood jewel that we see today.  At first I was skeptical of the relocation; on her signature Wednesday buttermilk chicken night, we'd see six or seven tables and maybe a few folks at the bar.  Fast forward to last Wednesday: we arrived a little after 5 and John apologized saying they were totally booked until after eight o'clock.  The bar was full.   It happens that John was able to put us in a table in the bar, which area we normally avoid.  However our bartender/server Vince, and alter ego Conor, redefined great service.  The servers here are all terrific, but these guys were something else.  Utterly attentive, accurate with our orders and congenial to a fault, they made us feel as though we were the only guests in the crowded bar.   Of course Sheila's mastery of all things edible causes people to return again and again.  And it's become more classy and intimate as time goes on.  But I think what makes Soul Cafe the great restaurant it is today is more than that.  It's people like John and Vince and Conor that make the place special.  I look forward to greater success in the future and I'll be sure to make a reservation on our next visit."}
{"text":"Decent breakfast. Bacon blueberry pancakes are good.  Biscuits with sausage  very good. Chilaquilles so so. Coffee and service ok."}
{"text":"Loved the inside and ambiance. I ordered the white pizza which was alright. I had a hance to try the green chili which was alright as well. Service was decent and friendly. Prices were a little steep but being so far north they have to compensate I suppose!"}
{"text":"Last night had my first meal there and was very impressed! First, kudos to Eric the server who went out of his way to make our experience great!  he even \"danced\" a bit with my 94 yr old mom!   loved the live music! THE food was fabulous. we had the clams casino which were baby clams with seasoning  and different from what I am used to. back east clams casino was with marinara.  then the crab cake as an appetizer was very good with snow crab but needed more dipping sauce.   also had the marguerite flatbread. wow what a huge portion!  took some home and very fresh buffalo mozzarella !  dessert was fresh peach pie with homemade crust and a nut crumb topping! also a large portion.   only complaint was the salad.  I ordered a roasted golden beet salad. I got an ordinary red beet salad. When I asked they said that's the way it's always done.  I sent it back.  I was not asked if I wanted a replacement and the manager who was IN THE ROOM did not approach and say anything like \"I'm sorry. would you like something else\". we sat there for a full 10 min before I caught the waiter and asked for dessert.  our bill was $73 including two glasses of wine. and no charge for the salad.  oh btw I showed them in the menu it said Roasted Golden Beet Salad."}
{"text":"Great food! And live music on Saturday night. We were dancing on the patio with our dog LOL.  Desserts were homemade and yummy. We have been here for breakfast too. Excellent place! Nice patio for the dog!"}
{"text":"Soul Cafe offers BIG portions. The food tastes as good as anyone might expect but the real allure is the portions. Expect to ask for a box because you'll likely be taking home what you can't finish.   The restaurant is clean and feels very open with a modern decor and use of natural-looking wood.   Our party went here for breakfast and the server was not keeping up with the coffee requests. It seems we were waiting for the coffee to finish brewing before they could fill the carafe and bring it to the table."}
{"text":"Soul Cafe is one of our favorite places to eat breakfast. Well worth the drive to get there. If you like Chicken Fried Steak, try the Crazy Cowboy covered in green chili pork gravy, it's the best in town. I also love the Soul Mosas,their spin on a mimosa, with Chambrod and a blackberry."}
{"text":"Eric was an awesome waiter, the live music was so real and fun, and the food was delicious. Can't wait to come back! This place is a hidden gem in north Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, friendly staff, excellent fiod. We  cane for breakfast and we will come back again."}
{"text":"This was the best breakfast I have ever had. The environment of the restaurant was perfect and our waiter, Eric, made the best pancake suggestion (get the lemon ricotta pancakes)! The food came or quickly, but was still delicious. We cleared our plates entirely. I would definitely recommend stopping here for any meal."}
{"text":"My family and I had breakfast here. Food was great, HUGE portions and tasty. Even the mixed fruit was wonderful with kiwi, blackberries, blueberries etc. nice ambience too. The kids menu was awesome and they had some very interesting breakfast dishes. I had the raspberry granola pancake which was very good.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"The owner is a wonderful lady. We went in for the first time and she stopped by our table. She asked how the food was and even had us try the wonderful chicken since we did not order that....superb! We will definitely be a returning customer."}
{"text":"OK, we have been to Soul Cafe many times and have found it to be pretty good.  This last time, not so much.  Loved the ham on rye every other time I've had it here, but this time the bread was really stale.  After eating almost half the sandwich, I asked my waitress to please put the remaining ingredients on a piece of FRESH bread.  Guess what - it came back with stale bread again!  Most likely will not go back."}
{"text":"Every time we've been here we've had terrific meals. If they have the lobster Benedict on the menu it's a must order. The pancakes are some of the best we've had. We normally go there for breakfast and 8:30 seems to be the time where it gets really busy."}
{"text":"I went to Soul Cafe and was more than pleasantly surprised.  The live music created just the right atmosphere.  On the night I went, a band called What4 was performing and they were tremendous!  The live music is what really makes this restaurant stand above others.  The food was also delicious. I ordered the salmon tostadas, and boy were they tasty! I highly recommend checking this restaurant out, especially when What4 is performing."}
{"text":"Not pleasantly greeted, empty dining room yet wanted to seat us at the first table by the door. My mom was on crutches, no attempt was made to help her find a comfortable seating area. Server was very unpleasant, zero manners. House keeping was going on as we attempted to enjoy lunch...moping, dragging chairs and tables. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Easter morning made more perfect by the Carrot Cake pancakes at Soul Cafe. I'm still thinking about them!"}
{"text":"As a frequent guest, i have come to expect good food and service. Last night i brought my family from out of town expecting a wonderful meal. Unfortunately extremely dissappointed. I had the tenderloin with blue cheese risotto, the meat was tough and dry the risotto had no flavor. My daughter pointed out a bug flying by ,the waiter only came to our table once after we were served , daughter had mexiloaf, not good again meat dry. I was really embarassed by the whole experience. Will sadly have to scratch this place off list to take out of town guest.."}
{"text":"Excellent local spot for breakfast seekers in N Sctsdl serving up scratch cooking. Their signature pancake selection beats any other location in the valley with their fluffy lemon ricotta taking the top spot in my book. Other omelettes look great and their menu of house specialities serves up delicious looking southwestern fusion flavors. Go support our #locals !!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best pancakes I've ever had! I tried the bacon blueberry pancake and the lemon ricotta pancake. Both very delicious and cant go wrong with either. Flavors were spot on. My wife tried the B.S. Omelet and it was the lightest omelet I've ever experienced. Most seem very heavy with the amount of ingredients they have in them. But this was fresh and light but fulfilling.   The service was great also. Waiter was friendly, funny and knowledgable of the good. Recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"I've only had their breakfast, and it's been delicious every time.  The crazy biscuits are ridiculously good.  My daughter (who is 4) loves their chocolate chip pancakes.  The whole family leaves happy."}
{"text":"First time here,  for a mid week lunch. Not too crowded,  not too noisy. Very pleasant.  Wait staff was very attentive and friendly  without being too intrusive.   The menu had typical lunchtime fare such as a variety of burgers,  salads,  cold and hot sandwiches. Each of our party of four ordered something different.   The food was excellent - and huge portions !  Every plate looked like it could feed a family of 4! In fact i ended up splitting a bacon burger with my wife and boxing my own order for later.   The salmon orange salad looked particularly good,  and our companion raved about it.   I look forward to coming back for an evening happy hour or dinner because we could see the outdoor seating area and it looks like a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"We have been coming to the Soul Cafe and its sister location Heart & Soul Cafe on Carefree Hwy for years. This is my first review of the location on Pinnacle Peak. The service has always been great with a sense of familiarity and attention that makes you feel like they value their customers. The quality of the food is very high, with fresh ingredients that are prepared with tasty seasoning and cooked to order. Today I had the heavenly hash for brunch, which includes a variety of veggies (diff types of potatoes, squash, asparagus and peppers) along with bacon bits, tenderloin pieces, all topped with 2 eggs, a spicy gravy and your choice of English muffin or toast. Delicious. I highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Wow - I've had a much different experience - VERY POSITIVE - than the negative Recommended Reviews . . . We have been going to the Soul Cafe for more than a year. We go Sunday mornings for breakfast.  The only place I know that has WONDERFUL gluten free pancakes!  Blueberry and granola, apple, and raspberry - you'd never know the difference - so tasty and BIG, not to mention reasonable price too!  Every time we have gone on Sunday we see the chef/owner Sheila hovering over the dining room once or twice and I've spoken to her many times - a wonderful chef who really cares about great food!  As for the negative reviews - its a busy place and the good news is most of the wait staff are young and bubbly - the bad news, most are young and bubbly, so that why I think a few people have had a bad experience - some of the wait staff are not the most experienced . . . But we have never had a bad, slow, or disappointing meal, EVER.  I highly recommend it . . ."}
{"text":"Brunch today was fabulous we did not make a reservation and had a party of 6 our wait was only a few minutes.  We were served our drinks quickly the spicy Bloody Mary and the raspberry mimosa were our favorites.  The bacon and blueberry pancakes are fluffy and delicious pay the extra for the real maple syrup it's worth it.  The portions are extra large so split a meal if your not starving."}
{"text":"Love this place! We need these kind of great businesses that put out great food with diverse  exploding flavors; and where the owner actually cares enough to come out from the kitchen and talk to the patrons so she can please. If you have a problem  { which can happen in any business, especially a small restaurant because sometimes people just don't show up!) I guarantee The owner ( Shiela ) wants to be aware, she'll make it right. Thanks Soul Cafe' for all your hard work and great breakfast ,lunch and definitely Dinner..... love the entertainment too!!!!"}
{"text":"Great dinner at soul cafe. Eric was a wonderful server making recommendations and checking on us frequently. Highly recommend this place for a date night. Great live music Wednesday through Saturday ."}
{"text":"This place is amazing and I can't believe it took me 5 years to find it! The lemon ricotta pancakes are so delicious and the breakfast sandwich. Coffee is really good too. Definitely recommend & I'll be going back soon."}
{"text":"I ordered mango and injeolmi shaved ice, the injeolmi is fine but the mango taste not really fresh, feels like canned fruit."}
{"text":"Yummy! Everything delicious! Server Eric was terrific. Giant portions, great to order different things and share! Best pancakes in town..."}
{"text":"Eric did not steer us wrong with the lemon ricotta pancake and  chilaquiles and eggs!!"}
{"text":"This place is interesting and worth giving a try. The food is great - no question about it. The only issue we have is their dinner prices are high given the ambiance and casual feel. $25-30 for a cafe type feel is a tough sale in an ultra competitive market.  We spent about the same here as say Sassi which is an impressive dinning experience. Other than price, I question why there is no sign on the building and the owner does not even invest in a website - not a good sign."}
{"text":"Excellent! First time here, clams casino were the best clams I've ever had the sauce they are in is amazing. The steak tenderloin melted in my mouth, was delicious. Great service and even greater food. Will def be back."}
{"text":"What an utter disappointment. After waiting for over an hour for salads and flatbread the manager told us the wait for food on Fridays is 40 minutes. Was that meant for us to feel better about our wait. The salad was drenched in dressing and barely edible. One main course came out cold. The other main courses were less than average. Our waiter was apologetic.  Too bad the manager couldn't care less. We will surely tell others not to waste their time or money. So very disappointed in our experience."}
{"text":"The fish and chips basket was SO good! The fish basically melted in my mouth. And this is coming from someone who doesn't care for fish ;) And the key lime tart was incredible. I will definitely be back :)"}
{"text":"I'm not a breakfast person but when I came to visit my sister to Arizona she brought me here and I so love their breakfast menu. I just order some meals with out the eggs and it's the perfect plate for me. For those who love eggs would be A++. Oh and don't forget the pancakes, this another thing I don't like but here I love the huge apple pancakes they are to die for. Very delicious!! This is my favorite place to come have a tasty breakfast and I know this cafe has way more to offer."}
{"text":"I've never been a big fan of shaved ice desserts.  Maybe because I always go to places where I'm just eating flavored ice and only taste cold syrup ice.  My friend highly recommended this shaved ice dessert place so I decided to try.  I'm so glad I came, this place is delicious.  Thumbs up!  Food:  We tried Injeolmi (soybean flavour) and strawberry shaved ice dessert.  It's a huge bowl and taste really good.  Big enough to share and enjoy together.  The strawberry one was very refreshing and tasted like strawberry ice cream.  It came very nicely presented.  Both were good, but I liked the injeolmi soybean one more.  It is very unique and nicely paired with almond.  It's taste is enhanced with mochi bits inside that adds to the texture of the dessert.  Overall, this dessert changed my view of shaved ice desserts.    Atmosphere/Service:  Big place where you can come as a group.  it is a self serve place so you just order at the counter and pick it up to your table.   Tip: They get busy at night so make sure you come early.  There is limited parking so carpool if you can."}
{"text":"In small plaza off Yonge. Perfect spot for a cool treat on a hot summer day."}
{"text":"We brought our friends from New Jersey here for breakfast on Friday (for the first time), and it was a hit!  Three of us ordered Chilaquiles & Eggs and hubby had the Redeye Gravy & Eggs.  Everything was delicious, but have to warn you that the Chilaquiles really had a kick -- we had to order milk to calm the tongue down.  I'll ask for less green chili next time. Our waiter, Eric, was super helpful and even suggested we order the Lemon Ricotta Pancake to share at the end of our meals...... glad we did ...... soooo good!  Though they are PRICEY (each meal should have been $2.00 less), we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great little North Scottsdale restaurant! Super eclectic menu and good vibe. Great breakfast. Hidden gem in the area and locals frequent this place! Semi casual but kinda upscale vibe."}
{"text":"Yummmmmm great food and fantastic fun service! Eric was our waiter and he was really fun and made great food and drink suggestions. Can't wait to come back for breakfast but we had dinner and it was great - fried chicken & pork loin were fantastic. Wednesday's are fried chicken special night."}
{"text":"Basically your neighborhood back up kitchen. Reliable for good food service with outside seating so can bring your dog.  Wednesday night is all you can eat buttermilk fried chicken which is always moist and Friday mites is fish fry. Live music is a little loud for the space."}
{"text":"First visit to Soul cafe breakfast was great had the breakfast burrito but also tried the lemon pancake which was light and fluffy(excellent) plan to return and try some of their other offerings. We all had to Take a doggie bag home portions are very good and Everything was very fresh."}
{"text":"This resturant is amazing! My hubby had the shrimp and grits dare I say its better than what I had in Nawlins......the Raviloi was excellent! Please do yourself a favor and get the Key Lime Pie for dessert.....gotta come back for breakfast!"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite restaurant for comfort food. The buttermilk fried chicken is dee-lish. It's only $9.99 for eat all you can on Wednesday nights. I signed up for emails and now I see there are specials almost each night. I'm definitely going back and taking the family with me. My co-worker says the breakfasts are great so we are planning to eat there this weekend. How nice to have a great neighborhood restaurant we can just walk to!"}
{"text":"Soul Cafe is my favorite bar, and Connor is the best bartender ever, although Jake and Chris are terrific also.  The bar area is very congenial and friendly, and the food is always excellent.  The chef has a special on 3 or 4 nights of the week, with really great pricing.  My favorite is the deconstructed chicken pot pie, which is an unusual combination of white meat chicken, silky mashed potatoes and a pastry topping that is like a floating waffle.  Other favorites are the steak and frites, the salmon, and the pizza/flatbreads.  And for anyone who loves live music, Soul has great entertainment 4 nights a week.  Great crowd, great food, and great music.  What else can you ask for!"}
{"text":"The chicken was fantastic and the only reason I offered three stars. The service was appalling. We waited 15 minutes without any service at all - not even an acknowledgement- until I had to go and ask the hostess for a waitress to come to our table. At this point the table next to us had already had their order taken.  There were numerous incidents that occurred while we endured the hour long wait for our food. Starters with undercooked raw food, brussel sprouts undercooked, bread asked for not delivered, my meal was delivered 10 minutes AFTER everyone else's (which remember we waited an hour for).  We asked to speak with the manager 3 times until he finally appeared. We explained the situation about the service and the mistakes and all he could do was ask us if our server was rude to us. A completely defensive attitude and inability to even acknowledge our experience. As I understand it, he is the son of the owner which would explain his entitlement. There was no apology, no offer to take any of the items off the bill, no offer of anything at all except for a slightly bemused smirk on his face. He couldn't of given less of a shit. He is clearly unaware and has zero understanding of customer service or how to deal with people.  Of course the bill arrives without anything taken off it. But honestly at that point we decided to salvage the rest of the evening - having actually enjoyed the chicken and each other's company. I would not recommend this restaurant"}
{"text":"Researched options in a time crunch and thought I'd give them a chance. But the vegan food I asked for from the Yelp menu links are not updated for their seasonal menu and unavailable. Too disappointed to reassess. Went hungry instead of spending the $35 I planned to spend there. Too bad. Update your menus!"}
{"text":"The gin martini at Soul Cafe made by Sean is by far the best in the valley. A must visit!"}
{"text":"I went here for the first time today. We had lunch, and I was very impressed. I usually expect complete and utter snobbery from North Scottsdale, but that didn't happen. At all.    Not only was the BLT Salad with Buttermilk Chicken as good as it gets, but it was also reasonably priced for the amount of food I received. It was $12.99, but two people could have easily split it.  The chicken was obviously made very close to my consumption, and it was perfect. It might seem a little silly to rave about chicken in a salad...but it tasted so homemade that I felt like my Grandma was moonlighting in the kitchen.  I can't speak for any other dishes, as my dining partner had the same as me, but I asked to take a look at the Dinner menu, and it was vast.  The server also told me about the Wed. night $9.99 All-You-Can-Heat Buttermilk Chicken. This surprises me in such an upscale neighborhood, but he said it's packed every Wednesday night, and also every Friday night when they have the same deal but with Fish & Chips.  I think this place is the real deal...no snobbery, very clean, open and bright, friendly staff, and down-home cooking that doesn't care if you drive a Bentley or ride a bicycle."}
{"text":"Tasty and authentic Korean patbingsoo. Expensive and portions are not very large.  They have roughly 5 types if bingsu. We tried the one with mochi, and red bean. It was authentic and tasty on a hot summer night.   Free wifi and lemon water available at the countee. They give you an electronic buzzer that vibrates when your order is ready! This is exactly how it goes down in Korea so 4 stars for that experience!"}
{"text":"Great place for bingsu, but it can get very busy at peak hours. It's mostly self-serve, super casual, and great for desserts after dinner. Parking is free and surprisingly not as limited as the other food places in the area!  My favourite is the Injeolmi. It's a sweet and decadent mix of soybean powder, condensed milk, almond shavings, and mochi.  Overall, the bingsu is a good price to portion ratio. I recommend sharing one large between (at most) 3 people."}
{"text":"I'm very hesitant to brag about this place too much in fear that it will become \"discovered\".  My wife and I had breakfast here last Saturday after meaning to come in for quite a few months.  We grabbed a couple of bar stools and were immediately welcomed by the bartender.  We chose the Wet Burrito, Apple Pancake, and something healthy (I don't remember because it was my wife's choice).  Nursing a couple of Mimosas we engaged in lite conversation with the bartender as he did with others at the bar.  He was extremely personable and definitely had the flair needed for the job.  We all watched with amazement as he churned out one Bacon Infused Bloody Mary after another.  Each was its own beautiful masterpiece.  When our food arrived we were both taken back by how much food was in front of us!  Wow, we were in for it.  The highlight for me was definitely the apple pancake.  It was huge but lite and had just the right sweetness balanced against the saltiness from the butter.  Delicious!  The burrito was great too and definitely had a good kick to it.  My wife raved about her healthy whatever that was.  We will definitely be back!  Total bill was $40 including the mimosas."}
{"text":"So happy to have found this place! The Mangorita was delicious and the sandwich was amazing! I really can't say enough positive about this restaurant. I will definitely be back during my stay. Eric was such a witty and helpful waiter too; the service was impeccable."}
{"text":"Had breakfast here 10/23/15. Greeted and seated very quickly. Coffee was brought right away and refilled regularly. The food was really good. My sister and I wanted to try a couple of different items so we shared the lemon ricotta pancakes and chilaquiles and eggs. The pancakes were delicious, light and fluffy. I would have liked a stronger lemon flavor, but that's just my taste. The chilaquiles were not quite what I expected. I was thinking two fried tortillas with the eggs and green sauce on top. Instead, it was more like pork nachos with eggs. This dish is very messy to eat and was especially difficult to share. The taste tho of the green sauce was wonderful but spicy. Our server was very good and attentive. Would definitely give this restaurant a try for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Great brunch!  They always have interesting specials and seasonal offerings that keep the menu dynamic.  The service is always very good and the bloody Mary's are very good!  They have a few cool brunch drinks to try out.  The chef and owner Sheila, specializes in a lot of Southwestern flares to the food and I've tried many special plates and am always very satisfied.  The crowd is relaxed and casual.  I look forward to going on a regular basis!"}
{"text":"We have been at Soul Cafe several times since this review and now visit regularly about once per week.  It is so nice to find a local restaurant where the chef is the owner and does most all the cooking.  This is an exceptional find. Delicious offerings for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Dinner menu varies depending on what ingredients that the chef/owner can find. Green chili breakfast selections are the best I've ever had. Flatbreads fresh and delightful. Service has been faultless. Oh, almost forgot the key lime pie. Mouthwatering! And only available if freshly prepared. And sometimes with a ginger snap cookie crust!  I am making this local restaurant my very favorite choice for myself, my wife, friends and family. Can't wait to taste her fried chicken next!  Reasonably priced, exotic drinks, nice decor, super easy parking. You won't be disappointed.  P.S. We since had the fried chicken.  Excellent!  Reminds me of my mother's, and that's saying a lot!"}
{"text":"Breakfasts are amazing.  Try their pancakes, the granola raspberry one is so yummy! Ingredients fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"2nd visit.  This time Eric was my server. Excellent food and service.  Extremely accommodating with my very limited diet.  I visit from Pittsburgh every six months and will be back every visit.  Love!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in after a hike for breakfast and it was great! The jalapeño cheese sauce on the eggs Jared was perfect, and my friend had the BLT bagel. Both dishes tasted amazing and were worth the money as they were very filling! The fresh squeezed orange juice was also a nice treat."}
{"text":"Four of us went to soul cafe to listen to the wonderful music of \"Street Line\".  While there, the server Eric was very disrespectful to us and had an attitude.  We decided not to order a big meal, just appetizers and salad. Since we didn't order a dinner, he had an attitude.  He even told our friends that \"this is a restaurant and you need to order food\", since they wanted to wait a bit before ordering...we all planned on ordering food, but to have the nerve to tell us that.  And since we didn't order dinner, he was very angry that we didn't.  And to top it off, he must have told the owner that we didn't order a \"dinner\" and she gave us dirty looks.  Isn't it about the customer and what they want?  Then he told us that the restaurant will get full of people....yeah, right, there were many tables open.  I think he wanted a $200.00 tab, thinking he would get a big tip.  Well, he would've gotten a nice tip, but not with that attitude.  He lost future customers and will never go back.  If you go there and don't order a \"dinner\" expect a big attitude.  Just beware!!  I never go to a restaurant and not tip, but he wasn't deserving of one."}
{"text":"Before being served two excellent salads (I had the Cobb, my mom had the Salmon Orange Salad, both really really wonderful), my mom ordered the daily soup not on the menu: Kale & Sausage. One sip and a coughing fit because the soup was so unexpectedly spicy, I moved the bowl away from her. When the salads were served a couple of minutes later, I told the server she could take it away, it was much too spicy. Surprisingly, the server offered no apology, made no offer to substitute something else, nothing more than \"ok\".  Then we were charged $5.99 for the soup with no discussion whatsoever!  What the hell??? Is that the level of customer service that's reasonable after a $50 lunch? sheesh"}
{"text":"SO GOOD! great breakfast place!! Warning: the pancakes are HUGE!!!! each order comes with two, & there's a huge selection of pancake types, Apple cinnamon, blueberry, lemon ricotta, etc. & they can all be made gluten free!!! our server, Eric, was fantastic! Super friendly & fast service. Super reasonable prices for so much food & there was still food leftover after we all were moaning from full bellies! Another positive that they have green olives with blue cheese- my fave! & there were no questions asked when I wanted a few on a stick! great first breakfast in our trip to Scottsdale & I know we'll be back before the week is up! Highly recommend to anyone looking for breakfast!!!!"}
{"text":"I visit this place with my friends for shaved ice. The one with the rice cake tastes the best. My friends and I did not like the blueberry (which uses frozen blueberries) and the one with cream puffs. The servers are friendly, and the atmosphere is excellent. I would recommend this place to others."}
{"text":"Why aren't there 6 stars? The food here is amazing. They even serve pie and ice cream for dessert, which isn't advertised and it's AMAZING! I had the special tonight, beef borguignon pot pie! Other dishes I have had were equally great. Try it."}
{"text":"Busy dessert spot in the Yonge and Finch area. Soft bingsoo ice shavings in a variety of flavours, fruit-based, coffee/chocolate based and korean/japanese styles.  We had a group of 8 on a sunday night around 8pm and the place is full. We have visited Soul Cafe before and we all enjoy the Injeolmi flavour. It's korean style shaved ice with soybean powder, rice cakes, condensed milk and almond shavings. The ingredients are intertwined throghout the bingsoo and it's not overly sweet. The large size is probably good enough to share for 2-4 ppl.   Restaurant is mostly self serve and gives you beepers for your orders and you have to return your dishes to the front when you're done.   Note: parking is limited in the plaza"}
{"text":"Having moved to this neck of the woods 2 months ago and being breakfast fans, we finally decided to give this a try after Church. First, we were pleasantly surprised by the plentiful seating both inside and out. The menu was thorough for all breakfast cravings with a little bit of twist to most dishes. We thoroughly enjoyed our breakfast and will be back to try dinner sometime soon!"}
{"text":"Amazing brunch menu! So many options - multiple omelet choices, pancakes, and other breakfast entrees. I could not resist trying the \"crazy biscuits\"! Well worth the calories...2 biscuits, one with sausage gravy (so good!) and the other with pork green chili (good, but not \"famous\"). My mom ordered the raspberry granola pancakes... WOW. It's hard to say pancakes could trump a splurge of biscuits & gravy, but I think they won! Do not miss the soul-mosa!!! (their take on a mimosa)"}
{"text":"Fantastic service and even better breakfast!  Unique menu items. I had the lemon ricotta pancakes and they were awesome!"}
{"text":"Soul Cafe is definitely my go to place for bingsu. My friend and I got their green tea bingsu and it was so good! It's not too sweet and the ice was so smooth and creamy. Gonna try a different flavour next time!"}
{"text":"Came too late for brunch.. Boo. But wow what a great lunch, still had the bacon Bloody Mary very tasty! And I had a Brie sandwich while hubby had the blazing burger which he enjoyed very much. Sat outside on the patio and it was a very enjoyable date ;) we will have to come back to try breakfast!"}
{"text":"Superfijne plek met lekker echt Amerikaanse ontbijt. Van heel gezond, tot heel veel, tot behoorlijk vet. De koffie is gewoon dus geen capuccino's, lattes, of flat white. Gewoon een slappe Amerikaanse bak. Maar het Soul Cafe is zo gezellig ingericht, met planten en cacti, terra cotta muren, schilderijen aan de muur en vriendelijke oudere dames."}
{"text":"This is our favorite breakfast joint! Their pancakes are TO DIE FOR. Make sure you come hungry as their portions are XL! Love their unique menu and that there's something for everyone. We are regulars and have never received slow/bad service. We've only had to wait maybe once for a table and it was 10 minutes max on a busy Sunday."}
{"text":"This place most certainly lives up to the reputation !!! It was worth the drive all the way from East Mesa !! Wish it was a little closer ... But we will most certainly be back !!!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I come here a lot for their shaved ice. We usually go with the classic Injeolmi bingsoo. We tried the large size once, but it was way too big for the two of us (I think a large can easily be enough for 3-4 people). The small size was perfect for us.   The price was pretty fair: $7-8 for small and $10-11 for a large. They have other stuff, like coffee, tea, etcs. But we only come here for their shaved ice. No credit card for orders less than $20. You can use debit card though.  The place is just a simple cafe, nothing too special in terms of the ambience. The workers are friendly as well. It's a nice to place just relax and chat. I"}
{"text":"Amazing food! Every time I come here I'm surprised how much food you get with your order. Delicious food with hefty portions. Great atmosphere and great staff."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic breakfast! Chilaquiles and Crazy Cowboy as main dishes were fresh, well prepared and spiced perfectly.--everything tasted \"clean\".  The chef clearly cares about every plate that gets delivered.  Portions were gigantic.  Speaking of overeating.....at Eric's suggestion, we shared a lemon ricotta pancake.  Ethereal, tender, just sweet enough--what breakfast dreams are made of.  Go there now!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Just visiting the area this week...the restaurant was just around the corner from where we stayed.  I had the roasted veggie omelet.   It came with a mixture of different types of potatoes and 9 grain toast.   Delicious!  I couldn't finish it.  The toast could have been crispier.  We did have to wait for our server at times....didn't understand that as there were very few customers. Very clean restaurant."}
{"text":"I've been bringing the wife and kids here religiously 2-3 times a week since they opened for two reasons it's one of the only breakfast joints near Troon where we live and the pancakes are great.  Over time we have made friends with the servers and they do a great job for us.  We really liked this place and highly recommended it to all our friends until now.  We have noticed a slip in food quality and a massive price increase.  The owner has been making huge revenues off an already pricy breakfast menu and sometimes to many customers.  Apparently the greedy woman doesn't appreciate her customers she just printed a new menu and raised prices for an omelet to $13.00.  Hence a breakfast bill for us of $114.00.  Hope she buys something nice with that because this is the last time we ever come here.  Congratulations you just lost several thousand dollars in revenue from us as we easily spend more than 700.00 per month here now.  $8000.00 plus annually nice job pencil that and this review into your bottom line.  Do you think your customers are idiots the cost of eggs, bread, pankakes, is almost nothing compared to the bill.  FYI your food is good but not that great it's fricken breakfast and we had runny eggs and a messed up order today to go with our huge bill.  We are immediately telling all our friends to boycott your business.  They have improved the layout and removed the delicious purple potatos from the plate.    I hope she makes more money"}
{"text":"Hmm... I'd say the non-fruity shaved ice here is better than most dessert spots I've been to, specifically because they offer a variety of different & unique flavours. Such as black sesame, injeolmi (classic), tiramisu, coffee, and more!!! Also, there's free parking in the plaza which is great for its location (located on the busy streets of Yonge & Finch).   We ordered the black sesame bingsoo and the mango bingsoo. I didn't enjoy the mango bingsoo as much because there wasn't much to it for its price. It came with pieces of frozen mango, grapefruit and mango ice cream. You could tell they used frozen mangos because they just don't taste as fresh. Perhaps it might've tasted a lot better with some syrup! Also, the mango bingsoo here didn't have much of a difference as any other place. However, the black sesame bingsoo tasted so good - partly because I love black sesame ice cream!!! It went so well with the almond flakes and the shaved ice.   I love that they use a milk base for the shaved ice so that you're experiencing flavour throughout the whole dessert. The workers were very friendly and efficient with making our bingsoo, less than a 5 minute wait!"}
{"text":"Good food. Stay away on Sunday mornings unless you have a lot of free time and don't mind waiting and waiting as it is very crowded. When you finally get seated you then get to wait and wait for your food. This is an excellent example of a restaurant that has a demand that far surpasses its supply.   By the way, bring your favorite fly swatted to fend off the flies while you are waiting and eating. But at least the food is good."}
{"text":"Bacon Bloody Mary is to die for! Eggs Jared is scrumptious! Shawn is a stellar bartender!  My favorite spot for breakfast  Oh - and they're dog friendly!"}
{"text":"Had dinner here close to Christmas with a large group and the waitress was great about dealing with all of us. Hubby and I split Sal's Bowl of Balls for an appetizer-very good. I had a fish entrée that is not currently on their website menu but I believe it was cod, spinach and taters-was very good. The fish was not overcooked and was delish. Wish I lived closer. The cocktails were excellent as well."}
{"text":"First time trying Soul Cafe for breakfast.  Service was very poor as it took 45 minutes for my kids food to come and another 10 for mine.  Everyone on the patio was waiting similar times.  Food was mediocre at best.  Bacon in the blueberry bacon pancakes was undercooked and sparse with a side of cold eggs.   The  biscuits and gravy were fair.  The chicken fried steak was fine. If you are looking for a good breakfast I would recommend JJ's nearby or Over Easy on bell."}
{"text":"Always great food! Just wish they had better iced coffee. Staff is always friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Slowest wait ever. Second time here and waited over an hour just to get food. The food is amazing, but don't know if we will all be back due to the slowness. Another table just walked out due to the delays..."}
{"text":"FOOD IS AMAZING. Service is awful!!!   Got a table for 6 on the patio and even though our food was delicious, I cannot give this place my normal 5-star rating with such poor service.  Our menus were only brought to our table after I asked the hostess AND server for them.  Our waters were ALWAYS low. And we heard a manager (maybe owner?) yell at a 16 year old bus boy right next to our table.  However, props to the kitchen!! Eggs Jared (eggs Bendedict) is definitely a favorite. Chilaquiles IS AMAZING. Salmon omlette is okay, but doesn't compare to the other two dishes.   I will probably be back, but definitely on a slower day."}
{"text":"Great pancakes, burrito, biscuits, green chili, jalapeno bacon! The chef/owner is AWESOME and Erik the server will make street your experience is wonderful."}
{"text":"We were visiting from Carson City and had heard about how special this place was.    Service: Bar - nice selection of different spirits, wines and my favorite beer. I like to drink the local stuff when I travel and that got them a point.  Had the IPA.  My friend had JW BLK label and it's hard to mess that up on the rocks.  The other had a Cosmo-on point + as it had a solid pour.   Wait staff - very good.  Constantly checking to see how our experience was, she knew the food was very good as we were not talking.  Great eats.    Food - my wife is Italian and this place has some really good Italian.  In particular is the eggplant parm and the breaded fried chix!  My wife didn't make it but sent her pics, \"looks like my grammy's style\".  (Shhhh it was better, she won't read this review)  Desserts - we had cannoli and a mini scone.  Both were super fresh and tasty!  Prices are reasonable.  Wish we could have been here for longer to try another session.    You are lucky to have this place in your backyard!    Almost forgot the musician.  Classics and nice background ambiance."}
{"text":"Shaved ice here is pretty expensive. Tasted good, has good service. Can stay for a long time if you buy something."}
{"text":"I have been eating here for years and have never been disappointed! It has a neighborhood atmosphere with creative great tasting food! Love this place! If I could give a suggestion it would be to change to a different coffee bean. The coffee has a bite to it but it is not a deal breaker!"}
{"text":"Delicious dinners. I chose the salmon and my husband selected the AZ medallions. He said just the right amount of heat.  My salmon was perfectly cooked and the sauce was flavorful but not overpowering. Our server, Olivia, was helpful and took good care of us. Dessert- had the gluten free chocolate cake which was delicious.  He had peach pie. Both great choices.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"My friend and I use to meet here about once a month for lunch. It was a favorite. They had a caprese sandwich. Loved it. they stopped making it which was disappointing. Tried a couple other things..not really that good; I almost choked on the bread it was so dry. Today the sandwich not good...bad cheese.  The soda was flat. We ask for new cokes and it was flat..... My friend said today, \"this place has kind of went down hill. I think we need to find a new favorite.\"  I think the changed hands or something...don't know but it is just not as good as before! Won't be back."}
{"text":"My husband and I have always been BIG fans of Heart & Soul Cafe so when the Soul Cafe opened last month we were THRILLED to be able to have a 2nd location to visit.  The Soul Cafe is now our FAVORITE as it is more upscale yet very warm and cozy and we love the atmosphere that seemingly makes the food taste even better, if that is even possible? As the food has always been FABULOUS at Heart & Soul.  Still with me, atmosphere enhances my dining experiences and the atmosphere that Chef Sheila has created at her new Soul Cafe is beyond wonderful.  We have now had the opportunity to visit Soul Cafe 4 times this month and last night's meal is especially memorable for the delicious fried chicken and the amazing desserts.  Since we just got back from Charleston, SC earlier this month, we can honestly say that Chef Sheila's fried chicken rivals anything we have tasted in Charleston!!! (and that's saying a \"mouthful\" as Charleston rocks fried chicken!!!)   Last night we decided to bring home our desserts as we were too full to eat them at the restaurant : my devils food chocolate cake with pecan caramel sauce and my husband's peach cobbler were OUT OF THIS WORLD DELICIOUS.  And we both had to share each other's dessert as we could not decide which we liked better!  I cannot rave enough about the food, service and atmosphere. YOU WILL LOVE IT. And all this at a price that is too good to be true! What's not to love?!!!"}
{"text":"Visited their recently opened location in pacific mall. Honestly   nothing special about it. Had the mango shaved ice."}
{"text":"BEST BINGSOO EVER.   To be completely honest it's the only Bingsoo I've ever had and fell in love with it since. Tonight we ordered the Mango bingsoo and Injeolmi bingsoo, both in large size and shared between 3 people. Their prices are reasonable for a dessert of that size, $10.90 for the larges each and smalls range from approx $6.90-$7.90 each. These two bingsoos in particular are my favourite and are absolutely delicious. The way they make their shaved ice is super light and fluffy, it melts immediately as you take each bite.   For the injeolmi bingsoo, they have a light almond powder(?), with almond slices and a sticky rice pastry adding extra texture to the dessert. I find it quite thoughtful that they layer the toppings so you're not stuck with shaved ice after eating all the toppings from the top layer.   For the mango bingsoo they have mango ice cream, huge mango chunks around, peeled grapefruit slices to decorate but also to add extra flavour. The combination of the two bring out a sweet, tanginess especially after a hearty meal!   Overall impression: I really appreciate the consistent quality every time I come, granted it's my fourth time coming ordering the same desserts. The portions were more than enough, 2 large orders for 3 people. Although the setting is self-served, we didn't require anything beyond the desserts that were served but the staff were friendly and seemed helpful anyway. The overall atmosphere is great for chatting and I would most definitely come back again !"}
{"text":"Great restaurant, atmosphere, service, food were excellent! This was our first time here on recommendation of a coworker. We went for breakfast. Eric, our server was amazing, made fantastic food and drink recommendations. I had the chilaquiles, which were perfect and we ended our meal with a lemon ricotta pancake. We will be back for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"We've tried this restaurant twice during the last three weeks. It's somewhat expensive for breakfast but we thought it worth it the first time we visited. The first time the food and service were terrific and today it was barely mediocre-to the point we almost walked out.  The sign of a great restaurant is seamless service and the quantity and timing of the kitchen's output on a busy day-not an average day. Stay away from this place on a holiday or when the place is very busy and people are waiting for tables.  The kitchen could not keep pace with demand today, the  new waiter dumped food in my lap and had to be told to comp me something, our order was wrong, came in stages, and portions were cold and undercooked. Even people around us were aghast and some waited for their breakfast orders for 45 mins. The table next to us sat for 15 mins without their order being taken. While all of the servers were polite, some of the servers are very experienced and some are newbies and not well trained, which is management's fault. Father's Day is a day to to be well staffed.  I'll be trying somewhere new. Today's experience was unacceptable."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere.  Good vibe. Kids menu items were delicious, yes I had more than one bite.  The portions are huge and some (just some) items seemed over priced. Will be back, not for the lemon ricotta pancakes, they were very good but very rich.  You can tell that good quality ingredients and thought goes into the food and overall presentation."}
{"text":"We went here on a Saturday mid morning. We were seated right away which was nice. The waitress was super friendly and since it was our first time there she took the time to explain the menu and tell us about the restaurant. We had no idea, but they serve dinner there too and have live music nightly! The vibe is already nice and laid back, so I'm sure it's a really nice dinner experience here as well. I ordered the 2 good two be true and got a plain pancake and the lemon ricotta. I love lemony things, but was unsure of the ricotta..I figured wth though...I'm gonna just try it. Well, I tried it and I didn't care for it. It had big hunks of ricotta in it, and I just wasn't a fan of that type of cheese I guess..Oh well. The plain pancake was very yummy though. It comes with eggs and bacon too. They give you what seems like 4 eggs!? And I forgot to mention the pancakes are as big as a dinner plate, if not a little bigger. BRING your A game and your appetite! It's too much food in my opinion, but hey...all in all we enjoyed breakfast as a family. Next time we'll sit outside on the nice patio :)"}
{"text":"I have been to Soul Cafe a couple of times -- only for breakfast -- and I have to say that it's ok. The reason (and yes, it is the ONLY reason) I keep coming back is for the pancakes. Yes. I really love the pancakes. My father really loves the bacon and blueberry pancakes. So if we want pancakes, it's over to Soul Cafe.   I have, however, ordered other things for breakfast and nothing stacks up (pardon the pun). The food is surprisingly bland.  I'm not sure why, but everything that I have ordered has been meh. I really expect more from the location and the menu, but I keep getting bland bland bland which is why I now only order the pancakes.  The other reviewers aren't kidding either with the hit or miss service. This last time was the best service I have had and the server told me I \"wasn't allowed\" to substitute pancakes on my daughter's kid's meal (even though I have done that every time I've been there), ended up getting her meal wrong anyway and it only took about 30 minutes for our food to come (it was not packed)  I have always found the staff to be nice enough, but be prepared for disappearing servers (no, I mean seriously... where do they go? This has happened more than once) and a long wait between ordering and service."}
{"text":"Good place to sit and chat with friends over some Bingsu and tea."}
{"text":"Have always wanted to eat here for breakfast but found myself here for dinner.  After my experience I dont think I would hesitate to eat breakfast/lunch/dinner here.  For an appetizer I got Sal's bowl of balls which quite frankly was awesome.  Just really delicious meatballs in a delicious sauce.  Another person in my party got the oysters rockefeller which he said were absolutely phenomenal.  For my entree I had the buttermilk fried chicken which came with mashed potatoes, a great gravy and no idea what the rest was because I didn't care.  The chicken is boneless, which is something I truly appreciate and let me tell you it was absolutely delicious.  While it is a bit pricey its a pretty large portion and high quality all around.  Service was spot on the entire meal as well.  Will without question be back!"}
{"text":"Amazing!! Best food, service and atmosphere we've experienced in a long time. This is a must for the discerning diner. Be sure to ask for Erik. He will steer you right. The manager pays personal attention and the bar staff has delicious drinks. Don't miss this place!"}
{"text":"Two stars for effort.  Nice place and staff is friendly.  Food is bland and lacks inspiration . My wife ordered the Champagne Strawberry Chicken, which had literally no flavor.  Paying $18 for plain chicken in soupy orzo is not my idea of a nice meal.  I ordered the Mexaloaf, which tasted like the meat inside a chimichanga from a cheap Mexican restaurant  I am also pretty sure it hung out under the heat lamp for quite a while, as it was incredibly dry.  I don't think Soul Cafe will be around long."}
{"text":"Great service, the food is great , they have free wifi and it's very pretty and cozy , the prices are a little high but everything else is very convenient and I definitely recommend it"}
{"text":"Holy cow what a great breakfast great service wonderful we will be back also the mimosa served next to our table was huge great great place"}
{"text":"Went here during breakfast week and it was the best decision I could have made! The breakfast burrito with a bloody Mary!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in the north valley. Great food with many choices. Love to sit at the bar at this restaurant."}
{"text":"We have driven past this place so many times...finally stopped in for their Pizza Special (Tues nite). OMG!! Everything was wonderful! First, the staff could not have been nicer..we sat at the bar (pizza special, remember?!) and the bartenders were very friendly, sincerely conversational. The house wines were decent (included in the pizza special) and the salads were good also. The flatbread pizza? Divine!!! Good size, 8 slices, lots of cheese, fresh Parmesan, spinach, fresh tomatoes ...great, and homemade!!  Then, they have homemade PIES!! We really were full (salad, wine, ample pizza) but homemade pie ALA MODE!! We ordered Rhubarb..to go. The bartender say it's awesome. The rest of the menu looks great too and not too expensive.  Live music Wed-Sat."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place 5 stars because the Injeolmi bingsoo is to die for! The only thing is that it's a little pricey."}
{"text":"It's a good breakfast but you pay for it. I have a hard time spending almost $20 per person with a coffee or juice and tip."}
{"text":"Today's breakfast quality was less than average. Our food arrived in a timely manner by an attentive server, this time. The servers are all very nice, but sometimes the food takes too long to get to the table. My omelette was dry and lacking in any seasoning or flavor. The eggs were like rubber and the toast and potatoes cool. My husband wasn't thrilled with the red-eye gravy and eggs. I think the description on the menu is different from what you get."}
{"text":"Sat 3/14/15, 8:00 pm. This was our last attempt to eat dinner here. We are locals and the restaurant is very convenient, We have been for dinner 4 times since it opened and every time there is an issue with long waits for food, food prepared wrong or the complete wrong order. Tonight my wife ordered the duck and was served the salmon, we then waited for the new order which was served raw. It was sent back and returned over cooked and the fat not rendered. My wife was comped a glass of wine and a house salad while we waited. Our first order took over 30 min to receive without bread or anything. I believe the $26 charge for her ruined duck should have been removed but was not. Stick with the breakfast!"}
{"text":"Love eating in the bar area,  the bartenders make it so fun, and treat us great...food is always yummy!!"}
{"text":"Great spot! Have seen the ads but never made it in. The crazy cowboy was great, the verde sauce was so good it doesn't need the gravy. Some like it hot was all kinds of yummy. Emily made sure the great drinks were flowing. Can't wait to try dinner there with wonderful Michael David wines. All they need are some Lodi Zinfandels. Great art also around the restaurant"}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for restaurant week.  This restaurant was amazing.  I am a picky eater and send back food regularly, making my husband want to hide under the table.  This place was AMAZING.  You will not find this food anywhere. Unique recipes, inspired and delicious. My appetizer was a scallop with pickeled jalapeno with thinly sliced orange.  The spicey jalapeño mixed with the tangy orange was a delicious heat coupled with the cool orange was just a delicious flavor profile. The presentation of every dish was so pretty too!  I had the crispy duck for the main course, a nice size portion of crispy and juicy duck with this amazing cherry chipotle sauce! The roasted creamy parsnips was coated in a crusted breading that was just happiness on my tastebuds.  For dessert I had the chipotle chili brownie with avocado ice cream.  The chili brownie was crisper on the outside and soft with a nice chewy inside. Avocado ice cream sounded weird, but surprisingly it was pleasantly yummy! The place has a nice casual unique ambiance, friendly staff. Hands down my new favorite restaurant.  They switch up their menu seasonally. Seriously try this place. The food is YUMMY!!!!!! If I could pick more than five stars I would."}
{"text":"Cozy location for desert! If you're craving bingsu, this is the spot to be at.   Although, the location can get very busy so try to come before or after peak hours.  Warning: The portions are pretty large! Getting a small is enough for two people to share, large if you're feeling up to the challenge.  Free parking in the area with lots of space."}
{"text":"I have been here at least a dozen times for brunch and while it started off with me loving this place, it has gradually gone downhill. The last few times I seem to get stuck with the same server who should not be in the service industry. She is flat out rude when you ask for things and today when we asked why our food took almost a hour to come out, she abruptly told us \"it's a Sunday. The busiest day for brunch\". We realized its a Sunday (thank you, Captain Obvious) and had made reservations. The tables who were sat around us were served first, even though we were sat well before. I honestly think she forgot to put our order in. No apologies for the delay and no updates, just \"it's a Sunday\". She might as well have said \"deal with it\". Also, they used to have mini cinnamon rolls and scones on the menu for appetizers but have stopped that- really disappointing because they were delicious! The food is good here and they have amazing pancakes but the juice is not fresh squeezed and their water tastes bad. With so many great brunch places around, I can easily find another place to go, with better service."}
{"text":"Ordered a waffle with fruits and ice cream and a sweet potato latte.  After waiting more than 15 mins and seeing everyone who came after us get their orders, went up to the counter and asked about our order.  Worker said they were making our order but saw her write down our order as we were asking where our order was.  Waited another 15 minutes to get our order.  Sweet potato latte was good.  The waffle that was supposed to come with fruitS came with 5 pieces of bananas, so asked if it was supposed to have more fruits.  Worker said sorry and added some strawberries and frozen blueberries. Needless to say, the waffle was a huge disappointment.  Also, they drenched the waffle with liquid sugar which made it way too sweet."}
{"text":"Last year I went to Soeul and had shaved ice in a famous cafe called \"Sulbing\" and I might have to say that Soul Cafe provides the same quality as Sulbing. If you have never tried Shaved ice before, i would recommend their Original Injeolmi Favour. I have tried different Shaved ice from different country and i must say Korean Shaved Ice is the BEST!!"}
{"text":"This place is great!  My husband and I stopped here on a whim for a quick breakfast/brunch after flying into town for a week's stay.  We were pleasantly surprised.  The food was fresh and had lots of healthy choices, my bloody Mary with jalapeno bacon was to die for!  We both had egg dishes, I had the farmer's market and my husband had the fitness burrito, both were good.  The service was excellent, we sat at the bar, and they were very attentive and friendly and were happy to change one of the TVs for us to be able to watch the basketball game we wanted to watch.  It isn't inexpensive, but fairly priced.  We will be back on our next visit to Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"I am not sure where to begin.. I will definitely not come back. Waitresses never greeted us when entering so we just stood at the door then just decided to go sit at a table that just got evacuated. Waitresses didn't even come to hand is the menu but that's okay since we knew exactly what we wanted so I got up and ordered. As we were waiting for the order, another waitress was go from table to table wiping down the tables, even the one where a couple just sat down at right after us but skipped over us and went along wiping down the other tables. We had to ask them to clean it down because the previous people made a mess. Another thing that bothered me was how the interior decorator were all clashing and off but that is not the main reason why I am rating a single star. I mean if I could I'd give it 0.5. We ordered the bingsoo (red bean shaved ice with fruit bits), I'm korean and I've ordered many bingsoo from various locations and I'd have to say, this was by far the worse, no offence. Hope others have a better experience but mine was pretty disappointing."}
{"text":"One of our favorite places for weekend breakfast in North Scottsdale. We can usually get a seat quickly, the staff are SUPER friendly and accommodating to our dietary restrictions and the menu is FANTASTIC!! Generous portions, healthy options and they offer gluten free, which I always appreciate.   Yesterday my friend tried the snickerdoodle pancakes and wow, talk about Yum. The smell alone made my mouth water. Oh and the staff pay attention to details. Like my side of fruit...all nicely cut and placed in the bowl with care. (Yes, I notice and appreciate the details Soul Cafe chef:)  I've been here a couple of times for dinner as well and I've always been impressed. Just really good home cooked food, with flavorful ingredients and healthy options.  In a town full of chain restaurants, Soul Cafe stands out from the rest and seems to just keep getting better and better."}
{"text":"Neighborhood location I happened upon by chance. Truly enjoyed the six dollar happy hour Manhattan, followed by the butternut squash enchiladas. Service was impeccable! Just wish I had time to try the desert the Keylime pie looked wonderful"}
{"text":"Come here all the time, they have an actual chef who makes all the meals everyday, all week whose fantastic. Everything's always really great and fresh tasting. The staff I've dealt with are great 98% of the time (I've only had one sever one time who was just plain odd and incompetent but haven't seem him back here since, everyone else is wonderful and knowledgable) I had one incident where they ran out of the meal i ordered after i waited an hour for it (they were VERY busy in their defense) but the chef really made it more than right by covering all our drinks for the night AND gave us a $50 gift card (she couldn't cover the tab because someone in our group had already paid for the meal and had to leave)  It can get a little loud with the live bands on the weekends but nothing worth taking a star away for. I would definitely recommend it, especially the mexaloaf, its addicting though so you've been warned!"}
{"text":"The portions are big and the food is good. Sometimes I don't like the spice combinations they use, but that is dish dependent."}
{"text":"Popped in for a late lunch 3:00 pm with my beautiful daughter and 17 yr old granddaughter.  Restaurant was basically empty. A couple people at the bar and one table leaving.  The hostess suggested we sit at the only table with out a table cloth immediately in front of the door. Our server did not welcome us, intro herself or make any conversation or recommendations. We quickly ordered. Approximately 15 mins after we ordered the server returned to ask what the third person in our party ordered. It was not complicated 2 Orange salmon salads and one strawberry spinach with chicken and an order of sweet potato fries. 30mins later our salads arrived no fries\" they will be here in a few minutes\". The orange salmon salads delicious. It's too bad the staff does not back up the chef.  Maybe they should close in the afternoon if they do not care to provide a nice dining experience. Waiting for server to come back with check. Yawn....zzzz"}
{"text":"Really delicious desserts, ice cream and waffles. Well presented and fresh. Nice staff and good decor."}
{"text":"OVERPRICED. A salad that is $12 for greens, olives and a few veggies is a little out of control. No protein or any special additives. A four peaks beer was $6.5, they don't even sell their beer for that. The question always is, would you go back?  No."}
{"text":"Was in Scottsdale celebrating my sister's wedding, and decided to throw a small, casual lunchtime shower in her honor. I booked a reservation at Soul Cafe because it was close to a Millennium Day Spa, where we had pre-wedding appointments booked. The restaurant was fairly quiet, and we grabbed a table on the patio.   Excellent service from the start! Our waitress was sweet, accommodating, and had great recommendations. Everyone's food and cocktails were super delicious! I ordered the BLT Salad and a Basil Lemon cocktail. I can't praise the food or service enough. So happy we chose to celebrate her special day here. My sister had a great time, and even hugged the waitress to thank her as we were leaving!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for breakfast and was not disappointed.  Wait staff was great.  On top of everything.  I ordered an omelet and the taste was fantastic.  Definitely plan to return.  Just won't order the orange juice because it was almost $7 for one glass .  It was nothing special just orange juice.  Thought it was way over priced."}
{"text":"Tucked away in a little plaza that is quite busy, Soul Cafe is definitely a standout for Korean shaved ice! The cafe is moderately sized with adequate seating and a chill ambiance. There are a selection of desserts from waffles, to thick toast, smoothies, and of course bingsu! Having ordered the mango shaved ice, I was disappointed to find that there were frozen mangos, opposed to fresh mangos; considering the large sized one cost $14 including tax. However, moving past the frozen mangos, the shaved ice has an excellent powdery consistency. Not only that; the shaved ice is more milky tasting than watery. I was pleased to find that toppings were not skimped out on; there was a ton of mango, grapefruit, mango ice cream, and this interesting sweet creamy sauce that was adequately drizzled on top and at the bottom of the bowl. By far, that creamy sauce is what made the bingsu, as there was more than enough, and it made the shaved ice milky in flavourful. Besides the frozen mangos, by far the best bingsu I've had in awhile! Worth checking out and trying the different flavours and drinks!"}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this gem for breakfast one day  and have gone back for dinner twice within a 10 day period!    The food is amazing.  The chef can truly create dishes where the flavors literally explode in your mouth.   The service Staff are very nice; you can tell they truly want you to have an enjoyable meal.    Scottsdale foodies....you must try this lovely restaurant."}
{"text":"We stepped outside the box and decided to try somewhere new! So happy that we did! Soul Cafe is great. We have eaten here 4 times now for breakfast on the weekend. Hmmmm, I love the Eggs Jared but instead of an english muffin, I get avocado. I also tried the Italian Fritata, delicious and fresh tasting! My husband gets the Chilaquiles and loves it, great spice and flavor. My son gets the biscuits and gravy, yummy! He eats every last drop. I always steal a couple bites of the gravy and it has lots of sausage and good flavor. A great place to try! My only suggestion is to clean the place a little better, the walls in the booths need to be wiped down regularly, lots of splatter on them."}
{"text":"Excellent bingsoo!! Average ambience. Self served environment but staff are nice.   Came here on a Saturday afternoon. Their Injeolmi bingsoo (Korean milk shaved ice with glutinous rice flour) was very good!! The powder is very flavourful and there were some Mochi as well. Sweetness of nice is just right and the ice was NOT MELTING AT ALL which is common at some other bingsoo places! We ordered a large and it was quite enough for the two of us. The decor is basic and nothing impressive. It was a little cold in the store but overall the experience is great. I am looking forward to come back again and try other flavours."}
{"text":"I only come here for breakfast and brunch - and it is incredible every time !!  The quinoa omelette with mint, strawberries, and ricotta cheese is outrageously good.   My sever Eric was attentive even though I was the only person outside and was busy inside.  He was friendly and prompt and talked to me about dinner specials coming up for a future visit."}
{"text":"Awesome food.  Best Chilaquiles in Arizona.  Lexi hooked us up.  Even had a visit from Sheila."}
{"text":"Had dinner Friday evening with my 4 small children, husband, and mother. As usual, we had a wonderful experience with delicious food. In the past I have only dined at breakfast and it has always been fresh, unique, and delicious. Dinner was the same experience. Our waiter John was great and brought my kids food out ASAP. My husband had the meatloaf and thought it was delicious, my entree was the lobster ravioli and it was spicy and tasty. We will be back!"}
{"text":"This is not a bad casual spot to hang out in, though it is a bit on the sketchy side. They had a small selection of teas, cakes and italian sodas. There were a couple of low couches (a throwback from the cafe craze of the 90s?) and some tables that were full of young people doing computer things together. There was also a TV showing K-pop, which was helpful when we were trying to explain Gangman Style to one of our less enlightened friends.   Prices were good, and so was service. You have to get your drinks from the counter when they're ready, but the owner did come by later and give us a bowl of popcorn, which was a nice touch."}
{"text":"Got to give it five stars great service,  perfect creative menu with good size potions. Food was amazing, love the coffee , great patio .. This place is got it right, it's worth a extra few bucks."}
{"text":"We had brunch today at the Soul Cafe in North Scottsdale with new friends.  It has earned ample good reviews (two years as best breakfast in Phoenix Magazine).  The name of the restaurant suggests an African-American chef preparing real \"soul food\" of the type we used to get in Los Angeles at Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles.  That was not the case here (remember--this is North Scottsdale!), but our food was excellent, nonetheless, and created by a chef who has a pasion for great breakfasts.  Only real complaints were a long wait for food (about 20 minutes) and iced tea that needed to be stronger.  But let's get to the good stuff. My wife ordered the ham and asparagus omelet and raved about how tasty it was--although it was way too healthy sounding for my heat-seeking palate.  I got the Crazy Biscuit, which was a large biscuit split, half covered with pork sausage gravy and half covered with green chili, covered by two eggs over easy.  A liberal add of Tabasco Sauce and I was in Foodie Heaven--the roasted potatoes on the side were great, also (just needed a little Tabasco).  Our friends split two blueberry pancakes the size of small hubcaps--smart move!  Only a serious trencherman could have polished those babies off!  They reported that they were outstanding.  Soul Cafe is a bit pricey (most items on the breakfast menu were $10-$15) but the generous portions make a doggie bag or sharing a prudent move."}
{"text":"Great breakfast !!!! Lemon stuffed pancakes were great but too much for one person to eat.  Everything else was delicious.  Definitely going back."}
{"text":"This is a great find! We love the atmosphere, the green chili was the the bomb, as was everything else!"}
{"text":"This was not the worst Cobb salad I have ever had, but is not the best.   The mixed greens were fresh although the rest of the salad components were rather sparse. The chicken was not so good. The slices, when I bit into the slices felt like there was a hard edge or rind on it. Not appealing at all. I was so disappointed as this place has the best fried chicken."}
{"text":"LOVE this place. My boyfriend and I drive up here often solely for the lemon ricotta pancakes. Not only are they the most delicious pancakes I have ever eaten, but they are huge and filled with giant dollops of ricotta (the best part); And they come with your choice of sausage or bacon. They are a must try! You can even order a single pancake if you feel you need a smaller portion. The steak hash and the Benedict are also delicious if you're looking for something more on the savory side. The mixed colored potatoes are both eye and taste bud appealing. It's usually pretty busy in here, even on weekdays but have only seen the line out the door once (which is a good thing!) We've never been for dinner yet, but it's in our to try list!"}
{"text":"Gotta say that the food was outstanding, reasonably priced, and cooked to perfection both times I visited.  Service was spot on. Can't wait to try it again.  Update.. went 2 more times since my first review.. same quality food and service. Had a tuna salad sandwich, excellent preparation on a multi grain bread that was a perfect match.. highly recommend this place.."}
{"text":"Went there on a Friday night with some friends. They have a good number of tables and the place is fairly good size. Tried 3 different desserts amongst us all, I really liked the brick toast  which was basically a 2\" thick slice of egg bread with condensed milk and whipped cream and milk. Fantastic. Also tried the blueberry cheese cake and la roca chocolate cake. Slices were good size and for the price was pretty standard compared to other places. The brick toast though was definitely better than other places and would Def try again. The service was pretty good. The ladies behind the counter were very nice and welcoming."}
{"text":"Great after Christmas brunch experience today due to the delicious food and our server Eric! I had the Bacon Blueberry pancakes, which were outstanding. Eric suggested one of the specials with spicy chili verde for my wife, which she loved. We will be back again soon! David R."}
{"text":"Went to this place a few weeks ago with some girlfriends. The staff was really nice and attentive. The food was delicious and I loved their drink selection! I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I am writing review on behalf of my dad. He LOVES this place. Every time we have guests visiting from out of town he brings them here. He loves their fried chicken special. I enjoy the place and food but not nearly as much as he does. All the servers know him and treat him well, I think that's a big part of the reason!"}
{"text":"This is a great little place with fabulous service great food snd prices and many opportunities for regular customers to be appreciated with discounts snd rewards sometimes the wait can be long but the food is always great"}
{"text":"Loved the BS Omelette and soul-mosa's.  Service was attentive, efficient and friendly. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Delicious & homey  ! Best pancakes ever . Try the lemon ricotta stuffed pancake holy cow !!"}
{"text":"Eric was our server today, great and very accommodating! Food was fantastic!! Birthday breakfast meal for our 14 year old!"}
{"text":"Great food, interesting menu, informative servers, nice ambience.  We ordered an appetizer, salad, entree, and dessert to share and had pretty of food. Key lime pie was great. Sat at the bar to watch NCAA tournament and enjoyed chatting with the barstaff. Would definitely return again."}
{"text":"so, thanks for the offer of fried chicken all you can eat for $9.99.  but based on our last experience in your restaurant, we shall not be returning any time soon."}
{"text":"This was our third Sunday in a row.  If the twins eat, they get an extra star and the twins love this place.  This is the kind of place you like having in your neighborhood.  It has great breakfast/brunch items.  I almost always order the italian frittata with light cheese.  The twins have eggs and they share a pancake.  The pancake is huge, the size of a dinner plate.  My hubby loves the jumbo wet burrito and they have been nice enough to drench it in red sauce instead of green.  Today, they even made it for him since they did not have it available.  Service can be a little sketchy, but I think they are trying to find the rhythm.  I am glad they are open and I will keep coming back for more brunches."}
{"text":"I have really fond memories of eating Korean shaved ice when I was in Seoul. I had tried binsu in Seoul around 6 times at different places. And I'm happy to say that Soul Cafe is the closest you will get to an authentic Korean Shaved Ice experience within Toronto, or probably the whole Canada.  In Korea, Sulbing is probably the most well known shaved ice brand. There's also Mealtop, and some lesser cafes. Injeolmi (soy bean powder) is all the rage these days so I recommend that first. Comes with soybean powder, condensed milk, small pieces of rice cake. Coffee is another popular flavor in Korea. Red Bean is the traditional one (patbingsu).  Anyways, compared to Korea I actually don't find Soul Cafe expensive at all. One of the places I tried in Korea was called Artisee. They charge $15 (15000W) for a 2 people portion. Sulbing charges you over $10 for 2 people portion depending on the type. The cheapest I had was at a university fair for $4 for single portion. Surely $6.99 for a single portion is not outrageous to get an authentic taste of Korea. Quite reasonable!   Most surprising was that they do take out in a styrofoam cup.   I don't really have any comments on their other menu offerings. There doesn't appear to be anything special. The cafe itself is alright. Not the most upscale cafe out there. And thankfully not as flamboyantly girlish as Cafe Princess near Finch."}
{"text":"I looooove shaved ice, but one thing I don't like about shaved ice is that it gets too chunky and later too watery. Traditionally, shaved ice is made out of, well, ice -- a frozen form of water. But Soul Cafe make their shaved ice with milk. So instead of this chunky, watery mess you would normally get, you would get this soft, delicious frozen milk, topped off with your favourite toppings.   I absolutely love injeolmi, a powdered soybean mochi that tastes amazing on its own. But add them to these frozen milk shavings? YES PLEASE! It creates such an amazing flavor, I can't stop thinking about it. We ordered a large for 2 people, and we demolished it because it was just that good.   A hidden place, but if you find it, you will have a good time. I promise."}
{"text":"Best breakfast place around. Nice outside laet friendly patio, good staff, and their lemon lancake and Rancho heuvres are amazing."}
{"text":"Had to wait an hour after our reservation. Did not offer a coffee during wait. Went to another breakfast place down the road"}
{"text":"Soul can't be beat for the most delicious, innovative breakfast and brunch dishes!  Been going there for years and never disappointed!"}
{"text":"Wow, The best breakfast potatoes I've ever had.  I was in a hurry so I just had a couple of eggs and some potatoes and it was absolutely delicious. Very friendly and attractive staff. I plan on using this for breakfast more in the future."}
{"text":"Delicious from apps to 'serts. Bacon tater tots, sals bowl of balls, Arizona tenderloin, short rib ravioli, homemade peach pie. The menu has variety but there was no entree under $20. Food was cooked perfect! Would go back."}
{"text":"Great food but servers are very rude and sarcastic. Our server Emily was rude about our table having separate checks. She accidentally put someone else's item on another check and instead of a quick fox (I'm in the restaurant industry so I know how simple this is) she just said to my friend, \"can't you just cover her tip instead?\". One of our friends put $45 cash for food and tip and she came back saying only $25 was in there. She threw a $20 from her book at him and said I'm not trying to steal your money just keep it, picked up all our check books and left without saying thanks for coming in etc. If this were on my our employees they would be gone. I wish she didn't collect my check book like that because I was ready to change her tip to zero for how rude she was!"}
{"text":"Best Lobster Benedict Happy Easter. Service was outstanding food excellent and atmosphere perfect. Thank you for making our Easter brunch tradition so special to include our four kegged Nana."}
{"text":"Generally, the food is good. Some dishes, like the fried, stuffed squash blossoms, were excellent. The pork chops were on the dry side but the side dishes to the pork chop were excellent. I enjoyed the R&B live music & if it wasn't for that, I wouldn't return. Kat. a hostess, was very nice but the manager bordered on rude. I had made a reservation over a month ahead, confirmed the night before for a specific booth & called to let them know we would be 15 min late(40 min drive). This was for a 30th birthday celebration for my son who flew from Atlanta for the occasion. Even though the manager was informed of the above, he gave away our reservation. When I informed him of all the above & that I was unhappy, he merely grunted. They did nothing to compensate for his actions & did nothing to help celebrate the birthday, not even a candle. I loved the music but would not recommend this restaurant & we shall not return. Margaret Roback"}
{"text":"Soul cafe is such a cool little niche spot with a very original menu. Have to try the veggie grill omelette or the blueberry pancake. Julie our server was awesome ! I will be back"}
{"text":"Hostess station seemed a bit overwhelmed this morning, but we were seated within a few minutes.  The young girl that took us to our table never muttered a word or made eye contact with either of us. A tad strange for a hostess and first person of contact in an establishment.  Our server came over after a few minutes and took our drink order.   We decided on the Wet Burrito and the Chilaquiles.  The pork green chile on my Chilaquiles was so hot I couldn't enjoy it and my over easy eggs were clear around the edges.  I've never had a bad meal here, today I was a little disappointed.  Our guests had the blueberry and bacon and lemon ricotta pancakes, always delicious and favorites of everyone.  The coffee rocks!  For anyone that likes their coffee leaded, this is the coffee for you!  Even though I had only a few bites of my meal I am definitely going to continue being a regular here, the vibe is chill and the food is awesome!"}
{"text":"Yay they finally got McCallan 15 at the bar. We love their food. The only complaint I would have is that their hostesses are not very skilled at trying to fit guests that don't have reservations. There is one gentlemen that works there on some of the same nights and comes to our rescue and works us in."}
{"text":"\"So expect to pay about $20 per person, excluding drinks\", intoned the PBS host of that dinning out PHX show. Ha! Funny stuff.   We enjoyed ourselves at Soul Cafe last night, but everything was very fully priced. Maybe it's just the area, several places have failed in this exact location over the years. Just because you're a few miles down the road from Troon, sometimes businesses think they can put their thumb on the scale.   I use to work up on Pinnacle Peak for four years during the Great Recession and every day it seemed as if another store or expensive eatery was closing it's doors. It was very depressing. Well, that's clearly in the rear view mirror, so just ignore the market being down 500 pts today. LOL  The three of us came to Soul Cafe for their advertised Happy Hour. It's really just their regular Dinner menu, less $2.00 off any of their drinks (even if you are in seated in the Bar area). After we sat down and saw the menu, we said what the heck, the food was suppose to be good.   We started off with the Claims Casino $12.00 and the Pretzel nuggets $8.00. The Little Necks were cooked perfectly in a garlicky sauce (photo).  The pretzels were good too. But Guldens mustard, really?  So that was $20 just for the appetizers.  For our Entrée, we ordered the Arizona Medallions for $26, Mexa Loaf for $21.00, and Buttermilk Fried Chicken for $21.00. All were very good. Now if you read my good Yelp buddy Aileen B's review (which we didn't before coming), you'll see that all the prices went up $2.00 to $4.00 after the TV show aired last year.   But the first rules of restaurant management is to price the food at three times cost. Here, well, we'll just call it market prices. I do believe the Claims were a bargain at $12.00, as were the two beers at $2.00 each and the Mojito at $6.00.   Our total tab came to $112.32 including taxes, but before gratuities. We asked for three boxes for our food and my daughter asked if she could have a little more gravy for the Chicken.  That was a $3.99 up charge.   So in summary, good food at a full price. Service was prompt and very professional. If we had realized there wasn't a formal HH and came for dinner, but instead sitting in the restaurant, we probably would have enjoyed ourselves.  Three Stars, A-Okay and I call your attention to both Aileen B's and David G's reviews and any written post the April 2014 PBS show."}
{"text":"I came here on a Monday afternoon with a friend. This is kind of like a self-serve place  (Wasn't expecting that). We ordered the seasonal Honeydew Shaved Ice (12.99+tax) at the counter, paid and then the worker gave us a buzzer that vibrated when our food was ready. Then we found seats immediately since it was not busy. About 5 minutes later the buzzer vibrated and we went up and picked up our order.  The shaved ice tasted like plain milk and melted very quickly that it became like soup with honeydew balls and a Melona bar. It wasn't bad but it wasn't anything special. The portion was big and could feed 3 people and it was one size only; large.   I'd probably come back and try other shaved ice because I heard the other desserts were amazing."}
{"text":"We came here last Sunday evening because I was craving for some shaved ice! As we stepped inside, there was no AC so I was fanning myself while waiting for our order.  We ordered the injeolmi bingsoo which is like powdered dried bean(?) Correct me if I'm wrong. It had little bits of mochi inside and almond slices. It was honestly just awesome! The ice texture reminds me of the shaved ice in Taiwan. It's not like slushy ice which I hate. Great way to cool off! For a small bowl, it was around $8. But I think it's worth it."}
{"text":"I have been a big fan of this restaurant until this evening.  I had loved the fish and chips, but tonight the portion was measly and the chips were frozen fries instead of the waffle ones.  For the price, which I use to not mind because the food was exceptional was a rip off. Kids pizza was down right nasty.  Unfortunately, this neighborhood gem has turned into a huge disappointment."}
{"text":"One of my favorite menu is the bingsu or crushed ice made with milk. Try the korean traditional Injeolmi bingsu, and you will love it."}
{"text":"Go for the pancakes & also enjoy the top notch service. We have made it a post workout habit with friends and the four of us have enjoyed every meal: lemon ricotta pancakes, heavenly hash, the SBT omelet, and almond joy pancakes. Even their ice coffee is consistently refreshing & bold."}
{"text":"Reservation at Soul Cafe on Wednesday night. Not aware they had Chicken Special for $9.99 which resulted in a crowded, noisy, and cold atmosphere. The server finally was available after the crowd left. All you can eat if you could find the server. Wife ordered scallops - 3 small scallops with sauce for $28.00 - the size of appetizer. The restaurant charged extra for more gravy, potatoes , bread & etc. Booths were uncomfortable - the restaurant requires a remodel ! Also had to call due to an extra credit card charge of $120 after notified by Text from card company - the charge reversed Scottsdale has many fine restaurants -  Soul Cafe is in dream land believing the business is 5 Star  !"}
{"text":"Went here for dessert with some friends. It was a cold night but we were craving some bingsoo. We ordered two bingsoos to share and they were good. I liked how they layered the ice with the powder so that you got a good ratio to the bottom.   The part that ruined our experience was the service. There was one female staff who would call out orders as if she was angry with everyone. Anytime we needed to interact with her, it was obvious she was not happy that she had to serve us. As well, although we did go on a cold night, the interior was quite cold. We tried to warm up by getting some hot water and were met with attitude from the rude staff member. We ended up leaving because our feet were frozen due to the lack of heating in the space. It was also our first time but we noticed it was self serve so when we left, we tried to return the tray but accidentally put it in the wrong area. The rude server made sure we were aware that we did it wrong by angrily telling us where it should go. Although the bingsoo was good, will not be returning as there are many comparable places in the area where service isn't so sour."}
{"text":"The desserts are great with affordable prices but the waitresses should be more welcoming to the customers. As soon as we walked inside and sat down, they didn't even bother to say \"Hi\" or give us the menu. It looked like we didn't exist; is it because we're not Koreans? When Korean customers came, they greet them."}
{"text":"First time here. Had the lemon ricotta and a blueberry pancake. Both bland and tasteless. The bacon was dry. The presentation on the plate was a bit sloppy. The coffee wasn't that good and the prices are high. $13 for a pancake breakfast. Chatty waiter who tried to skimp me on my company discount. Too much competition in the area for expensive, subpar food."}
{"text":"They have the best presented bingsu ever! I got the watermelon one and it was beautiful, took a while but you can see the details and amount of work it takes to make it. We had it on a very hot day and it was super refreshing! I recommend sharing it since it's quite big, overall this place is very solid for bingsu and has a lot of variety!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is fantastic!  The portions are very generous for both the kid and adult meals.  Their Bacon and Egg spinach salad was delicious.  Their fried chicken was very moist and tender and their mashed potatoes very creamy and flavorful.  The chicken tenders for children is the same recipe as the fried chicken. The pomme frites were very crispy.  The Mac and cheese on the kid's menu was also very good,  with abundant cheese sauce.  We are from Denver and will definitely return the next time we are visiting Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Wow, oh Wow! What a great breakfast venue! Easter Sunday I was expecting a total $hit show but lo and behold we were seated immediately. the bloodies were flowing and the delicious coffee was taking the Sat night edge off. They were busy but our service was spot on. My hash and eggs was one of the best I have ever had. Are those chunks of meat in my hash? Why yes there are! Solid 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Well, I just found my new favorite breakfast spot in Scottsdale. The food I ordered this morning was the opposite of bland, actually bursting with flavor. It was like layers of tasty goodness. On top of that, the tables, bathrooms and floors were clean. Also no grime on the syrup bottles or silverware. Add a fun and on the ball waitress Sherry and you got a home run. What more can you ask for? This place deserves a 5 Star rating, it has a fun feel. Only wish we could have met the owner, there's always next time.  04/16/2015 Made it back finally for dinner. This has been the most all around best experience meal of the vacation. From the moment we walked in the door and the air smelled tasty. Got seated immediately on a Thursday at 5:30 PM. Appetizers and meal were top notch. Like the hostess said, \"There's not a bad choice on the menu\". The high point was the entertainment. The in house one man band was incredible. Everything he played was good and right on track with the crowd. He even took requests. I don't know how he did it, but, his Neil Diamond was spot on. He could totally turn into a Neil Diamond cover artist and pack the place. Still loving this spot. All the best."}
{"text":"Brunch is amazing here! Came on a Sunday and got seated right away. Wonderful seasonal specials as well."}
{"text":"This is simply the best breakfast place. The best pancakes I've ever had anywhere ever. The bacon is delicious green chili is the best I've ever had. And the service is terrific especially our favorite Sherri. My grandchildren love and look forward to going there as do I."}
{"text":"Another Yelp fail. This place is not far from home but i finally decided to stop by based on Yelp reviews. First advice,  don't order the Risotto Buttons. Described as an exquisite dish wrapped in mozzarella & filled w sausage,  nothing better...only if it was true. Too much excitement. ...it was just another soft fried rice ball. I asked for a warm drink other than regular coffe or tea, and I got laughed at saying : \" that's pretty much it\"! I advised there are things like Irish coffe, and suddenly creativity hit. Then you got the owner, tidying up all night long right in front of us without even whispering a hello. I did see her greeting out some people but we didn't have that same courtesy. She must have enough customers, & set for now. Up until that moment I was considering giving it another try for breakfast, but now not so sure, but I do wish them the best."}
{"text":"My wife and I went with a group of eight.  We went reluctantly, because I KNOW she said she didn't like the menu.  But she did, and it was amazing.  Her selection was halibut with cauliflower.  As good as the fish was, the roast cauliflower with olives and pine nuts tasted even better.  My lamb was very good, too. And there are several other items on the menu that will bring us back again.  Plus the service -- as I said, we were in a group, and our server provided separate checks as requested.  Friendly and accommodating.  What more could you want."}
{"text":"A couple of hair strands on my food! Very noticeable, too! I could hear the cook complaining in the back about the incident.  This is my second time in this establishment and the very last."}
{"text":"Had breakfast there this morning. It took about 10 minutes before the waitress came to our table. There were 5 of us...we ordered 2cups of coffee and the rest ordered water. 15 minutes late we got our drinks. She then came back in another 15 minutes to take our order.  Then that took another 15-20 minutes (omelets).  We had to get our own silverware. Oh, did I forget to mention that the restaurant was about 1/3 full. Even tho the food was good, the horrible service ruined everything. Was grateful the place wasn't full!!  We might still be there:)"}
{"text":"Disappointing. I read the other reviews and thought I'd try it out but none of it lived up to the hype. I had the lemon ricotta pancakes - not great. I feel like the pancake batter was poorly made and not tasty. My husband got the chilaquiles - again ok but nothing special.  The vibe of the place is definitely southwest and they had some interesting sounding things on the menu, but after the first disappointing try I wouldn't give it a second chance."}
{"text":"I loved this place! For the Yonge and Cummer area, this place offers free parking lol. I had their injeolmi bingsu and it tasted just like the one we had in Korea! Service was friendly and atmosphere was very casual. Went around 930pm on a Friday night and wasn't too busy. It did get busier as we left around 11pm though. Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"North Scottsdale Gem that never disappoints. Clever menu that changes often with specials to reward regular customers. Generous portions and great  deserts make it a favorite with locals.  Ask for our favorite waiter Chris, he will take care of you. Come hungry and make a reservation.  Live entertainment on the weekends rounds out the picture of a well run establishment."}
{"text":"We waited 50 MINUTES before getting our food! The waitress didn't even give us a heads up that the kitchen was running behind or let us know that the wait would be almost an hour before we would get our food. My friend who has years of waitressing experience politely suggested to her that it would be considerate to tell guests up front if there's a long wait. She said it was the hostesses job to inform the guests. She went on to say that Sunday's are the busiest and 40-50 minute wait times are normal. How does she expect the guests to know this if it was their first time? We also spoke to the manager and nothing, not even our coffees were comped for the inconvenience. I've come on Sunday's before and never waited so long to get my food. It would have made a difference if the hostess and waitress made us aware of the delay prior to waiting for a table and ordering our food. TIP: in addition to asking the hostess how long it would take to get a table- ask them how long the wait is to get your food. I definitely won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Great food, great atmosphere and great service!  Music can be a little loud at times if your are trying to visit with friends       Love this place!"}
{"text":"Always a great sign when a place serving a certain ethnic cuisine is frequented by people of that ethnicity. I saw Korean grannies eating here, so there's a checkmark.   I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say bingsu is the best shaved ice dessert out there. No slushy mess, no neon coloured sugar syrup. Just fluffy, creamy goodness. Soul Cafe opens the doors to this exotic snowy paradise and lets you experience it in a dozen different ways.   Along with bingsu, they've got some other types of desserts like brick toast, cakes, and waffles. Also, they've got a variety of drinks, the most unique of which is the sweet potato latte which is definitely worth an order. Seriously, guys, it works. Sweet potatoes make good beverages!   But of course, you're here for the bingsu. Soul's got an amazing variety, some fruit based, like mango, strawberry, watermelon, and some flavoured with other things like coffee, green tea, Oreo, tiramisu...My favourite is the Injeolmi which is made with condensed milk, soybean powder, almonds, and chewy little mochi pieces. It's sweet, it's nutty, and the difference in textures creates something surprisingly complex.   We also tried the honeydew bingsu, which is an impressive concoction served inside a half melon, covered with melon balls, and topped with a whole Melona like a sword in the stone. Refreshing and perfect summery treat.   Service here is polite and quick. They may have forgotten my rose tea at first, but they brought it out quickly and with a piece of complimentary cake. Can't say no to free cake! Now, if only the crazy diagonal parking was just as friendly...  (34/100) - 2018"}
{"text":"I checked this restaurant out on Yelp before visiting and saw that it was on the pricey side for breakfast but the menu sounded good so we went. The raspberry granola pancakes with bacon were very good and a large portion also, but I was disappointed to see that the prices were even higher than what showed on this website ($11.99 instead of 9.99).  My husband had an omelet with spinach, bacon, tomato and cheese. It came with a few potatoes and one slice of toast. It wasn't much above average and also pricey.  So, be prepared."}
{"text":"I haven't tried much here, but what I have had has been really good. The Wild Alaskan Salmon with Jalapeño corn cake and mango salsa was delicious. I order that with a side of potatoes to make it even more spectacular. I also ordered a lemon drop from the bar and it was very well made. I look forward to trying more well made food from here."}
{"text":"Absolutely great place for breakfast... Highly recommended and has a great selection of options to choose from and a nice outdoor patio."}
{"text":"The brunch has delicious options!  Be warned the portions are large. I don't expect to take leftovers from breakfast but that has happened. We have learned though it's best to order just one breakfast meal and add 2 eggs then it is a meal filling enough for 2 people.  Our savory suggestion is the crazy biscuits it is so good because one biscuit is covered with a white sausage traditional gravy but the other one is covered in a green pork chili they are both really good. The second suggestion for the sweet side is the bacon and blue pancakes deelicious!  Or if you can't decide which pancake you can get the option where you pick to 2 different pancakes.   They have wonderful syrup.  The the only downside is there's usually a wait."}
{"text":"I'd come back every day for pancakes if I could! Our group was relatively large and the service (Eric) was speedy and super friendly even with our two little ones, making them feel at home. The Raspberry Granola pancakes were huge and amazing, and the pork green chile special spicy and delicious. We'll gladly go the next time we're visiting"}
{"text":"Was very excited to go to this new restaurant in my neighborhood......UGH   If you want bad/rude service this is your place!  Sat at the bar for 10 minutes (there were 5 people total at the bar) without anyone but the owner even making eye contact.  Owner was too busy filling her glass with wine to be bothered with a customer.  I asked to speak to the manager and of course the bartender was the manager.  I asked if they were under staffed and she said no why?  I said it would be a great location to open a bar and she said she would be with me in a few minutes.  A few minutes??  I sat there for 10 without even a wave.  The guy sitting next to me said you come there for the food not the service.  Is it too much to ask for both?  Dont bother!"}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this little dessert shop while I was in the area. Decided to try the injeolmi shaved ice and REALLY enjoyed it! The shaved ice was really fine, it reminded me of sesame flakes. The toppings to shaved ice ratio was perfectly balanced, and I love the blend of soybean powder, almond flakes, mochi and condensed milk.   The servers were also very nice. Upon placing your order, they'll give you a buzzer which goes off when your order is ready.   Dessert places are a dime a dozen in this area, so I was really pleasantly surprised to have enjoyed this place so much - I look forward to coming back to try more!"}
{"text":"Server was non existent, coke was flat, chicken over cooked, bacon raw. No one ever checked on us to see if we were okay.   I would give them negative stars  if I could.  I don't recommend this restaurant!  Servers name was Brian"}
{"text":"The food was tasty and the value of the fried chicken was fair. The service was good. But, the was a hair in my biscuit, gross."}
{"text":"Worst restaurant in the valley! Service and food were horrible!! We ordered a Cobb salad they brought us a different salad we ordered steam clams they brought us clams that were frozen we shared a dinner and then got charge six dollars to split a plate if that's not adding insult to injury I don't know what is. Worst place  in the valley we eat very find restaurants all over the valley don't waste your money or your time going to this low class place!!"}
{"text":"Great place. Nice drive to Pinnacle Peak Road. Super friendly staff. We had breakfast. The \"Some like it Hot\" is really good. The menu calls them \"small\" corn cakes, but they are plate sized. The jalapeño bacon is really good, nice smoky flavor and spicy. My hubby had the \"Wild Western\" omelette, very good, the cheddar cheese in the omelette were slices rather then shredded. He loved the potatoes, and the fresh fruit cup is amazing, fresh strawberries, blackberries, grapes, kiwi, orange slices. Great coffee too. We'll be back, would love to try dinner. Also they welcome pets and even have a pet menu."}
{"text":"Soul Cafe is located in North Scottsdale. They offer a large breakfast menu and the also offer lunch and dinner most days of the week. The atmosphere is energetic but also stylish and colorful with interesting artwork on the walls and lots of drapery in the dining room.   I tried the Salmon with Corn Cakes off the Arizona Breakfast Weekend Menu. The eggs were poached nicely and I liked that the corn cakes were light and fluffy and seemed oil free. The salmon was little chalky. I would stay away from salmon here. The jalapeño cheese sauce was nice and creamy but very mild with flavoring.   My husband had the Tres Locos. It was an enormous plate that contained three tortilla cups. One was filled with spicy beans, another was beef chili, the last pork chili and they all sat on a rainbow of potatoes that included sweet potatoes. My husband liked the bean filled tortilla cup best best because it was spicy and flavorful.   Service was very good as our server was speedy and efficient."}
{"text":"Was excited to finally get to this place for the brunch that my in-laws have been raving about and it was not disappointing. Came in for Father's Day last weekend and left full and happy.  They had a special Father's Day menu which included what ordered, the beer cakes and brats. These were delicious. Beer infused pancakes with an orange glaze/syrup that was super sweet and super delicious. On the side was a tasty brat pretending to be a breakfast sausage. Who knew that a brat I would an awesome breakfast treat. It was.   My little guy managed to take down most of a plain pancake (he's only 10 months old and those things are big!)  A few other people I was with had the heavenly hash and had nothing but good things to say.  The only reason I don't give this place 5 stars is the food times. I took almost 45 minutes to get our food after we ordered. Granted is was Father's Day and they were busy but that still seemed a bit long. Otherwise the service was great.   Look forward to eating here again in the future."}
{"text":"Everything we had was amazing! We went for a Sunday Brunch and there was no wait although they were crowded.  We had great service and the owner Alma came out to check on us after our meal.  The order was 2 Crazy Cowboys-Chicken fried with a green chili sauce which had fabulous flavor!  A Mediterranean omelette and a Vegetable omelette. My only complaint is that no one ordered their amazing looking pancakes. Guess I'll be back for that!"}
{"text":"My wife and I visit Soul Café whenever we come to Scottsdale. On our most recent trip we had breakfast there three times. The food was great and the Jalapeno Bacon Bloody Mary is the best in the city in our opinion. Our server each time was Eric who is awesome. Highly recommend this place. We just recently saw the dinner menu which looks great and we can't wait to come back and try some of those meals."}
{"text":"Update: I have been in here many times now - to where I have had every type of pancake they have - and they are all AMAZING. Seriously the best pancakes ever and the syrup makes it perfect. I love this place for breakfast. If there's a pancake you don't see on the menu, you can ask for it and they might make it for you. I often ask for a regular blueberry pancake in the \"Too good to be true\" (pick 2) entree and they always make it. I've upgraded this place to 5 stars because since I've been in many times, the food is always awesome, the service is great, and they are friendly. Best pancakes EVER. No joke.  One of these days I need to make it in for lunch or dinner!!  Original review: So tasty! I just ate here for the first time - came in for breakfast. Got the Too Good to Be True (any 2 pancakes/French toast + 2eggs + 2 bacon or sausage). $12.99 (before tax + tip). I got 1 lemon ricotta pancake and 1 blueberry pancake; 2 scrambled eggs; 2 bacon (although I asked if I could have 1 sausage link and 1 slice of bacon, but was told no..which I find really strange..which is why they lose a star...). But anyways, these pancakes are amazing. They are huge and so good. They might be the tastiest pancakes I've ever had. The scramble was good and the bacon was thick, hearty, and good quality.  But, I'll definitely be having those pancakes again. Plus, they are so big, I have an equal portion for leftovers for tomorrow morning - WIN! Also, the restaurant is nicely decorated and modern; good atmosphere; and the staff seemed pleasant and friendly. All in all a great place. I'll have to come back and try dinner - their menu looks good.  Glad I came in today - I almost went to another place, but these guys open at 7:30am and the other place not until 9am and I didn't want to wait, so I made the decision to try this place out! Awesome!"}
{"text":"Honestly one of my favourate bingsu places ! I took my boyfriend here for the first time, and we got the green tea shaved ice, and he loved it. So we're definitely coming back & comparable to the bingsu cafes in Korea"}
{"text":"A nice spot for a regular to come to.  Consistently good!  I hadn't been there since the remodel and was pleasantly surprised. Much more open and roomy."}
{"text":"Food is average at best! Plates look not  appetizing, and lock in basic plating skill!!!!!!!. Breakfast dishes are not good! The large pancakes covering the entire plate are not attractive both in taste and looks! When it comes to food often enough bigger is not better. Attention to details is the key!!!!!!! Did not like the fact I was served my food by a young man wearing baseball cap (absolutely disrespectful, not only to me but the entire establishment) Don't feel the need to be back any time soon!"}
{"text":"Our server was incredibly good.  I don't say that because she was exceptional or anything, it's just that with myself and three women at the table, it was weird that she spent the majority of her eye contact on moi.  Not weird you say? Well yeah, it is. First, I'm not good looking and, a fuckload older than her.  Second, the three other women were ordering shit like their lives depended on it - so this made it difficult for her to figure out who was pony'ing up for tonight's dinner.  And finally, she touched my shoulder. I think she wanted me. Badly.  Ok, not so much, but let me have my fantasy, would'ja?  Service sold this place.  It was impeccable."}
{"text":"Great food, and great bartenders! The reason for the three stars is there's a particular brunette waitress who once told a group of six of us she wouldn't be able to give us that much attention because she's so busy and we should come back later and just today I heard her talking badly about her table of patrons to another employee. She was complaining about the small food order they had placed."}
{"text":"Had breakfast here. Food and service was five stars. Giant homemade pancake great selection of breakfast plates something for everyone. The 4 stars is due to music if that matters to you at all...I was expecting some groovable soul jams instead something like pop."}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot in Grayhawk. Love the banana quinoa pancakes!!!  Good service. Amazingly unique menu. Huge portions, so be prepared to share or take home leftovers.   This is my new go to brunch spot and I'm thrilled to find a place I love in North Scottsdale rather than old town."}
{"text":"First time here. Went on father's day. Said 45 minute wait (expected for the holiday) but only waited about 20 minutes.  Good sized portions and had food served in only about 10 minutes.  Got chilequiles, ham brie asparagus omelette and apple cinnamon pancakes. Pancakes are huge. The bacon bloody Mary bit pricey but good.  Little bit more $ than an Ihop but much tastier.  Recommend it."}
{"text":"Love the music, food, service and the energy. Such a lovely place. Thank you so much,  Helena K"}
{"text":"Amazing!!! I can't believe I finally found it. I had an awesome experience with Korean shaved ice (patbingsu) in montreal.  food: 5/5, the injeolmi shaved ice and the hot grapefruit tea are the best in the menu. the shaved ice is like having snow. It doesn't melt immediately like the ones many are familiar with and the toppings are awesome. They actually put chunks of peeled grapefruit that you can scoop out to eat as well. just delightful   service: 3/5, self serve but they are nice overall  ambience : 3/5, wide seating but the chair could be more comfortable.  price: about $10 per person. somewhat pricy for dessert but totally worth it."}
{"text":"Interior is nice. Charming patio. Menu is nothing really unique.  I was disappointed that they only had regular coffee, no Americano's, not even an Espresso machine which seems odd this day and age for a \"Cafe\". For not looking to busy, service was pretty slow. The roast beef and pastrami sandwiches were good. Server was very nice, but seemed like they were having major issues with the cooks in back getting things done right and in timely manner. No water at tables and took ages for unripe tomatoes. What sandwich place doesn't have Dijon?"}
{"text":"I don't *love* this place, but I really, really like it.  Don't have any interest in fried chicken? Me either. But THIS fried chicken is just ridiculous. Your eyes will roll up in your head as you wonder what magic wand they waved over this chicken. It's SO good. We bring out of town guests here and they always laugh and agree. (\"I don't ever get fried chicken! But if you say so... OMG what is this stuff??\")  There's also the super-delicious short rib ravioli. Yuuuummmm. Wonderful, inventive cocktail menu.  Lots of good stuff, but only 4 stars? We've had some strange, awkward, reeeaaally slow, borderline- rude service here. It pains me to say so. Not just once, but a few different times. Also some GREAT service. I guess that's the issue, it is inconsistent.   They have many fish and shellfish items on the menu, some excellent, some are not. I do appreciate the variety and weekly specials. Also love it when the chef comes out and asks for sincere feedback. She's into making fab food for everyone!  Love that.  Recommend!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night with my boyfriend. I love Korean shave ice:). The place was crowded but not too packed. We managed to find a table right after we arrive.  Overall the place is clean and the staffs are friendly. Price is similar to other shave ice places. I would recommend everyone to come try it out!"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time this morning for breakfast, loved it! Love the vibe inside , very relaxing. I got the Italian frittata, which was tasty.....and huge, I'm writing this at 6pm and I'm still full! And their roasted potatoes, holy delicious, I could have that as my meal alone."}
{"text":"Best place to go for patbingsu, hands down! They are the original injeolmi patbingsu place and for a reason, they do it right! Staff are super nice and friendly too."}
{"text":"The food is well worth the wait on weekends! This was our second visit. Eric, our waiter, is top shelf! The menu is both unique and interesting and executed well by the highly skilled staff. Sheila, (both Owner and Chef), came out personally and checked on our breakfast. We will return!"}
{"text":"I've gone a couple of times..one for brunch & one for dinner. I've been surprised both times! Going in & not knowing what to expect made it even better/easier to choose on the menu.  Huge pancakes with bacon induced bloody mary is a great combination!! Be ready to saddle up to the table with their huge, tasty flapjacks! They thought of lil details and did have sugar free syrup available.  Dinner is another great option with various twists on their dishes. Buttermilk chicken with mashed potatoes & vegetables hits the mark pretty close for this southern raised boy! Only one suggestion...try homemade biscuits that aren't so dry, no matter how much butter you throw at them. Just a thought...  Overall, our party was well taken care of on a busy night with the manager/owner even checking on guests to ensure they're enjoying themselves. Lil touches and new twists make this spot a good but unique place to grab a bite!"}
{"text":"Love this place especially for breakfast!  Their pancakes are spectacular and shareable!  And love their jalapeño bacon!! Nice dog friendly patio too!"}
{"text":"I have gone to  the Soul Cafe at Drewry and Finch a few times before and I am glad a new more convenient location has opened up. The new store has a more trendy feel to it, with a very clean white look.  My friend and I got a large red bean shaved ice to share, which comes with vanilla ice cream, red bean, and injeolmi. A large for 2 people is definitely sufficient so there is no breaking the bank here. If you have a sweet tooth, you will love the shaved ice.  I have tried injeolmi and matcha at the other location and they were delicious too. The other flavors look enticing but I have not ventured to try them yet.           Service is place an order, and then recieve a buzzer that will buzz when your order is ready. I honestly have no complaints, I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Went for the fried chicken promo and was not disappointed.  The chicken was outstanding!  My husband had his chicken with the mashed potatoes and veggie, but, I really appreciated that they offered the chicken over a salad.  The salad included lettuce, bacon, avocado, blue cheese etc., and was a perfect balance for me as I try to stay away from carbs (as if fried chicken doesn't count, haha).  The drinks were also well made and delicious.  Best of all, the price is very reasonable. I would have given them 5 stars, but, they offer an \"All you can eat\" chicken special, but after an hour of waiting for his second plate (the first held only a few  pieces of chicken), the second plate never arrived. We finally asked for the bill as we were drinking more than we wanted and had to drive home.  In fairness to the restaurant, they were fully packed, and the servers couldn't have worked any faster or harder. Maybe in conjunction with offering \"all you can eat\" they should add more staff to handle the flow.  We plan on going back next week as a customer next to us told us the hamburger was excellent."}
{"text":"We got the waffles with everything on them. I have to say that the waffles (in spite of the ice cream, whipped cream, etc.) was extra good! Definitely a place to check out if you're in the area. The fact that it was super crowded when we came in at 10 is a testament to just how good it is."}
{"text":"Don't go here....not even if you're curious.The first time I went I ordered a Arizona Steak and cheese. It was described as being on \"French Bread\". What I got for about 12 bucks was a big ball of \"Mush\" and a side of ruffled kind of chips that seemed like they were pulled from the bottom of the bag...and not much of em! There was no French Roll..it was a mish mash of tasteless slices of roast beef and a messy goo of cheese and topped with some kind of soft spongy sweet roll. I went back again thinking maybe something else would be better. I ordered a Grilled chicken sandwich that also comes fried. It wasn't bad but wasn't great. I wanted fries with it and got a mix of soggy sweet potato fries and average tasting regular fries. I didn't want a \"mix\" but wasn't sure what \"mix\" meant ...my bad for not asking. Listen, this sandwich was like 13 bucks or more with tip and all that...It wasn't very filling...I expect better bread on these sandwiches and better quality sides at these prices! I'm not even going to mention the service. It would take too long and I no longer have the energy to keep typing..thumbs down"}
{"text":"My husband and I went for breakfast today . . . didn't even know it was reopened as Soul Cafe because the Harvest Cafe signage remains on the building??    Our meals were amazing!  I had the Chiliquiles with a delectable green chili sauce and lean pork over corn tortillas with eggs and cheese on top.  My husband had the blueberry bacon pancakes - huge and flavorful - blueberries and bacon galore! The breakfast menu was abundant including quite a few spicy dishes, which I love!  Service and prices were good.  Will try for dinner soon!"}
{"text":"Have been there for breakfast and lunch and liked it. Reasonable prices. We had dinner there tonight and it was just awful. Live music so LOUD you couldn't talk at all. Terrible. And not that good. The singer wandered through the small restaurant singing like he was some star or something. DO NOT go for dinner and you'll be fine."}
{"text":"Normally give this place 5 stars but way too long wait for our reservation (25 minutes) & food this time around. Food & cocktails were great like always."}
{"text":"My daughter and I have been wanting to try lemon ricotta pancakes. So we yelped it and Soul Cafe came up. We have nothing to compare theirs to, but we will probably be comparing others to theirs. It was very good!    The coffee and service were also very good.  A bit pricey overall, $40 for 2 breakfasts and 2 coffees, but we'll be back to try other items."}
{"text":"Good food entertainment and service. Very nice place and will return. A little pricey but my wife likes our date nights and want to make her happy!"}
{"text":"Finally, a breakfast place who is not scared to use spice!! Thank you soul cafe and Eric who recommended the wet burrito! So delicious!! The lemon ricotta pancakes had way too much ricotta, but all is forgiven because the actual pancake was fluffy and delicious! Request Eric! He is the best!"}
{"text":"My 2nd visit here   This place has some ups & downs.  I'll start with the good stuff first.   Fantastic location very easy to find !  Lovely decor with lots of seating options  The hostess was the best! She was so friendly and made sure my to go order was correct   Chocolate chip pancakes  were the best I've ever had ! They're not on the menu but that was not at problem at all,  they whipped them just right up.    Eggs were very fresh and fluffy bacon  was crisp and sizzling hot  The downs   The bartender was chatting at length with another customer and completely ignored me even when I said hello/ excuse me not once but twice.  I waited so long for a simple mimosa, by the time the chatty bartender VINCE even acknowledged me my food order was ready to go and he even gave me the wrong drink ugh I was so disappointed   However on a positive note the owner decided to call me after seeing my picture that I posted of Vince the bartender ignoring me and apologized she was so sincere & genuine that I'll most definitely be back but no mimosas from there ever again."}
{"text":"Had lunch there and was quite pleasantly surprised when the kids chicken tenders came out.  They were awesome and the serving size was very generous!  Best chicken tenders I've had!!  I had a salad which was fantastic!  The menu had a great variety and I will definitely be going back!  Great atmosphere and great food!"}
{"text":"The food was great. The Bloody Marry was amazing. Eric was very kind. My new favorite place."}
{"text":"Never knew Soul Cafe was also a dinner venue until recently. So happy I found out.   First, in the two times we had dinner there we had Eric. He had a terrific knowledge of the menu and combined with very engaging personality.   Next, both times we dined at Soul Cafe we had pork chop dinner and blueberry pie for desert. Both were wonderful.   If you on the fence you need to try Soul Cafe for dinner. You should not be sorry."}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE! a little more pricey - but SO worth it! My boyfriend got the bacon bleu pancakes and they were seriously overflowing from the plate (amazing!)  I had the chilaquiles which were also delicious! loved the atmosphere as well."}
{"text":"Soul Cafe is creative and inspired. It has breakfast lunch and dinner and will knock your socks off morning, noon or night. We have been regulars since she opened her first location over seven years ago. Most recently we had the unbelievable pancakes with blueberry and bacon or the lemon ricotta and I had the Frittatas which were to dream about. If I was a drinker I would have tried the morning contain list as they looked mouthwatering and unique. The lunch menu has the best burger in town and an addictive strawberry salad that you can add salmon or grilled shrimp. She is one of the few restaurants that does not overwhelm her chicken or tuna salad with onion. For dinner I highly recommend fried green tomatoes and her seafood is always fresh. The food is fresh and her food quality is outstanding. You will love the variety and creativity of this restaurant. Not to be missed."}
{"text":"Saturday night was our second time to Soul Cafe and what a disappointment. My husband ordered steak and I ordered the pork chop. I had ordered it the previous visit and thought it was pretty good. This time,not so much. The chop was so raw that I don't think it was even on the grill long enough to do anything except make the criss cross grill marks. Couldn't eat it. My husbands steak was the same......totally raw. We could have sent it back but the waiter never came to check on our meal. The place was very busy. Maybe too busy if they obviously can't handle a crowd. We brought out meat home and cooked it more but the pork was too tough and the steak was flavorless. It must be a good restaurant to have such a following but something was definitely wrong that night."}
{"text":"We dine here a few time a month. Everything we have had is tasty! They have a full bar and outside seating. I especially love the southwest flair on the menu items."}
{"text":"We'll start with the positives: lovely atmosphere, cute little place and nice patio on a beautiful Arizona Spring day. And I was happy they could seat us right away, on a busy Sunday morning. The staff was friendly enough, and pretty prompt (until the end of the meal, when we kinda got forgotten). But... The food you get for the price you pay is ridiculous. I got a side of fruit for $5 thinking that would be a decent amount of fruit, given the price. It was the TINIEST \"bowl\" of fruit I've ever seen at a restaurant. The prices in general were quite high for a breakfast place, even for scottsdale! Then my husband got a burrito, which was quite bland, and was sitting in a lake of a watery liquid of some sort (it was NOT like a sauce it was supposed to be in or anything- it was supposed to be a dry burrito), therefore making the tortilla all soggy. My husband's theory is the burrito was frozen and they microwaved it on the plate, causing the frost to turn to this liquid all over the plate. A little unappetizing, to say the least. Well, we can say we tried a new place... And will not be back :("}
{"text":"I don't like going to favorite restaurants because it seems like you get short-changed at Restaurant Week. Not so at Soul Cafe. Thank goodness we could not resist the proffered menu. Our meal was off the charts. I started off with the Fried Green Tomato Caprese , DH got the Scallop Rockefeller---both AMAZING! Followed up with 2nd course: DH got a Gazpacho that he said was the best part of his entire meal---he wanted to bathe in it!----and I got the Brussels sprout salad, which I did not love. Too much texture for me, but the dressing was delicious. For our 3rd course, DH had the filet mignon over a blue cheese risotto and port wine reduction and I had the seafood paella. Butter my butt and call me a biscuit! UNBELIEVABLE! We wanted to finish with one of the half-baked cookies for dessert, but there was no room. Our service was excellent--as usual--and the band was great! Chef Sheila rocks our world---as always. And somehow, in all the craziness, she had time to come out and visit tables and be her usual sweet, personable self. Soul Cafe---A+++++!!!"}
{"text":"Went here twice while on vacation and LOVED it! By the the best breakfast in the Scottsdale area. Be sure to order there pancakes, service was also incredible our server recommended some entree ideas to us (we ordered some of them) and we were not disappointed, such great food!   Don't forget to order dessert, key lime pie is amazing!"}
{"text":"I'm so glad to find a place that serves legit injeolmi bingsu. The shaved ice was in the texture of snow, and in between the layers were almond slices, mochi bits, and condensed milk. Then, the entire thing is covered w/ roasted soybean powder, which gives it a nutty flavor. Of course, nothing can replace Sulbing, but it's comparable to many other ones in Korea."}
{"text":"To be honest, I did not really have high hopes for this place because my parents have lived across the street from this location for years, and we have seen multiple sub par restaurants come and go from the area. However, I was looking for a nearby breakfast place to go to with my family, checked out the Soul Cafe menu, and was impressed! Anywhere with some good, healthy, and meat-free breakfast choices is always exciting for me haha. We were seated right away when we got there, the restaurant was not too busy as it was a Tuesday morning. Our server was very sweet and did a good job. I ordered the vegetable omelette without goat cheese, and subbed gluten free toast. The server made sure to ask if I was allergic to cheese (I'm not), but I thought that was good of her to check. The omelette was made with egg whites, which I liked! Also it was loaded with vegetables which was great. Sometimes I'll order a veggie omelette from somewhere and its like all egg with just a couple chopped veggies. So the omelette itself was quite good, not totally amazing, but I enjoyed it. The best part was the rosemary potatoes, yum! I ate all of my food, like before my family was even halfway through theirs, which says a lot. I'd love to come back on a day when I don't work so I can enjoy one of their alcoholic breakfast drinks. Or maybe to try lunch! It was a cute little restaurant, I was impressed."}
{"text":"OMG! This place is amazing! The bacon blue pancakes and apple pancakes were so yummy! Service was great and the folks really cared about us! Definitely highly recommend this place!!!"}
{"text":"We had a great time and would thoroughly Recommend this restaurant. Food was great, we had the Special, fish and chips, that tasted fabulous. We were surprised that the Reed family was Entertaining and that made it more than special. Would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Love this place for breakfast. A very solid spot for a meal.  I have only eaten breakfast here and each time I did was great!  I love their Chilaquiles & Eggs and Granola Raspberry Pancakes.  Did I mention their mouthwatering Mimosas and Bloody Mary's!  Yum!  Very enjoyable atmosphere...friendly staff and friendly fellow patrons."}
{"text":"Brunch is a must! Ricotta pancakes, bacon, side of hash browns and great service.. Have to come here, there is no place in the area that has all of the above!"}
{"text":"Why would you be open when you don't serve food? Lock your doors if you're not serving food. Stopped in for a late lunch and was told I could drink but not eat."}
{"text":"Someone sat next to me at one of the flight two months ago mentioned how great his dinner was here and I should try.   Finally I had time this week to try here for lunch and I enjoyed my salmon salad.  Located at north Scottsdale, liked the way they decorated inside (have this North Scottsdale feel to it). Server was friendly and seemed to enjoy working there but she was a bit slow. My iced tea stayed empty a bit longer than I wished.   Really liked citrusy taste of the salad dressing, salmon was cooked just right, perfect portion size for lunch.   I couldn't find what he (the person from flight) recommend on lunch menu, I should come back for dinner someday."}
{"text":"I was here on Monday and the food was unreal! Had the best waitress named Kim, so fun and enthusiastic! made our time there very enjoyable and will be back very soon to see her!"}
{"text":"First off, this is a hidden gem that I cannot believe I did not know about! I mean I have lived in the area for almost 10 years and I don't know how long they have been around but I am sad that I am just now learning that they exist. I was here this past weekend after my workout with my fabulous friend Lauren who said \" hey wanna get breakfast and bloody mary's?\" Hmm YES PLEASE!! Soul Cafe has the best bacon bloody mary's I have had to date and Sean, the fabulous bartender (who also gets extra love for being a Cowboys fan) took great pride in making those delicious drinks for us. However let's not forget the food as I had a dish called \"Some Like it Hot:, which consisted of the best savory cakes, extra crispy bacon and eggs I have had in minute! I wanted to be greedy and finish all of it but sadly I couldn't. Taking it home was not an option as I am not a fan of reheated breakfast. I also learned that they reprint their menus weekly I believe as it changes that often since everything is fresh. How cool is that? Will I be back? You bet will! If for nothing more than to sit at the bar and drink bloody mary's!"}
{"text":"Menu is diverse with above average quality.  That said, kitchen seems to be overwhelmed when more than 5 tables full. Be prepared to wait 30 minutes for your brunch, lunch or dinner. Yes, we tried all 3 to be sure it was not an isolated issue. It's possible the menu offers too many options for their kitchen ability. We wonder if the old staff went to the their new location as it wasn't always this slow. Good food but terribly slow."}
{"text":"Nice comfort food! Not always consistent but for the most part food is very good. Weekend breakfast is killer and their fried chicken is awesome. Very good service."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped here for lunch.   They were just finishing the breakfast period and about to start lunch so we had the option of ordering from either menu.    I wanted lunch so we placed our orders.  Unfortunately, when they transition from breakfast to lunch it must take some extra time because we waited a long time for our meal.    The food itself was good.  I had the Salmon Sandwich (a little overcooked) and my husband had the Chicken burger (very flavorful).   The buns were fresh, the portions were large and the fries were good.  Our waitress was very friendly and is clearly a fan of the food - she raved about the breakfast as well as our lunch selections.   We'll be back but only if we can avoid the kitchen's transition period."}
{"text":"The food here was super good our first and second times but the third time we took out two meals and were disappointed. It was the fried chicken and the"}
{"text":"Cute place! Love the decor! Staff so friendly and the food was wonderful!! Everything looked good will be back to keep trying the rest of the menu for sure!!  Went for breakfast but want to go back for dinner also!"}
{"text":"My new favorite place for Brunch. I love the gluten free oatmeal pancakes. Delicious food, friendly staff and great service. Casual environment very comfortable."}
{"text":"I ordered the Injeolmi shaved ice and love it, however it didn't have any red beans in it :( Texture and flavour was great tho. However my friend got the coffee flavour and we both found it too sweet."}
{"text":"Had brunch here on a Saturday and it was so good! I had the Eggs Jared and a side of French Toast and though it was way too much food I couldn't stop eating it! It was a great atmosphere and was decently big inside which it doesn't look to be from the front. I'll definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Went with friends to the Soul Cafe this week. It was so good! The ambiance was nothing special but the food and service were outstanding. Our servers were friendly, helpful and very accommodating. I had the Arizona steak sandwich which was excellent. Another of the group had a fried chicken salad which was loaded with chicken and looked delicious. The portions were large and the prices were reasonable. What's not to like!! Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Great cafe with best bingsoo in town! Awesome place to sit and chat! Their place is clean with renovations done a month or two ago. A cafe worth visiting in North York!"}
{"text":"Came on a Sunday at 11am and by noon still no food. My thoughts are if you are open for breakfast then have an adequate number of cooks and servers or food runners available. Sat at bar and witnessed multiple people complaining that shared our fate, some asking for a manager that never showed. Sad part is food is great but service,even though friendly, leaves a lot to be desired. Oh and did I mention that my wife, after am hour wait received the wrong order? No correction was offered outside of \"they must be out of it\".  Update- they did apologize and poured my wife a mimosa and comped her breakfast order. That being said the pancakes were amazing even though not what we ordered :-). My tres locos was outstanding as well."}
{"text":"Soul Cafe doesn't offer children's menu options, vegan options are minimal and carry out menu is limited.   Many of the reviews are not published. Beware. Only the higher rated reviews are posted. My husband posted a 1 star and it never was posted. We too have been disappointed recently with their menu options , menu portions and pricing of menu items.   Too many restaurant choices in Scottsdale . Soul Cafe Not good for families with young children."}
{"text":"I went here after receiving a spa treatment down the shopping center at Millennium Spa. My services came with a gift card for Soul Cafe and I'm so glad because otherwise I may not have stopped in. I got a delicious salad with chicken, avocado, peppers, etc."}
{"text":"The sandwich is amazing here and so is the grape fruit tea! Love coming here especially the snow ice flakes! Great price and a great place to come and hang"}
{"text":"Uber friendly staff that made a few modifications to menu offerings to better fit my pallet. Food selections were spot on and breakfast was great. Shall return again for breakfast. Can't comment on other meals 'cause haven't been."}
{"text":"Wonderful breakfast.  Had the Jumbo Wet Burrito which was excellent despite the unappetizing name.  The ricotta lemon pancakes were light and the only reason I didn't finish them was because I was full from my half of the burrito.  Staff were incredibly friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this intimate restaurant not far from my rental. As a first time diner, I enjoyed the quality of food and service. Visiting from the Florida Keys- the key lime pie was the best I've had anywhere!  No lie. Will be back for sure. Had the salmon and corn cakes- awesome and a salad special with butternut squash also very tasty!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants! Breakfast is amazing Raspberry granola pancake, and bacon Amazing!! Dinner... Buttermilk Chicken Dinner too die for! Best ever! Buttermilk Chicken"}
{"text":"Great service and atmosphere.  Food was very good as all the combinations worked!  We will be back."}
{"text":"I came here with my Korean church youth group about a week ago, and we ordered a bunch of different  (Shaved Ice Desserts). The blueberry one and the strawberry one were really amazing and tasted kind of like an icecream sundae! These two are good options for those who really loves sweet and fruity flavours. I was also able to try the  (Injeolmi- which has Korean rice cakes and sesame poweder). IT was also really good as the rice cakes were chewy and the powder added a nice flavour to the Shaved ice, but the sweetness was more subtle. So if you like your sweets to be mild than I would recommend this!"}
{"text":"HIGHLY RECOMMENDED: We've been to Soul Cafe now twice.  Once for dinner and most recently for a Sunday breakfast.  During our first visit, we enjoyed a nice dinner on the patio shortly after Soul cafe opened.  We had the fortunate opportunity to enjoy meeting the owner and chef Sheila.  She is a rock star!  Her food is epic and her personality is contagious!  Soul Cafe has plenty of patio space featuring 2 separate patios on 2 different sides of the establishment.  We swore we would be back and frankly, we waited far too long to return!  We recently had breakfast here last weekend.  The first thing that stood out is the glaring question, why have we not been here more often?  Soul Cafe is not only delicious but it also has a killer vibe and energy to it.  We were put on a short waitlist and passed the time briefly at the bar.  My wife ordered a Bloody Mary and it looked amazing.  Big, bold, garnished with BACON!  Hello?  Bacon belongs on a Bloody Mary and Soul Cafe flat out nailed their Bloody!  About 30 seconds after our dining party received their drinks, we were seated.  This was the first time I have been inside.  The inside is decorated very nicely and it flows.  We had a party of 8 consisting of 4 adults and 4 kids for breakfast and we were waited on quickly.  Everyone ordered a variety of entrees.  I ordered the berry and yogurt bowl.  I was not pleased with the added cantaloupe only for the reason that it is the only fruit I will not eat.  I politely sent it back and the waiter was super cool about it.  This was totally on me and I am grateful that the waiter didn't make me wrong or feel weird for this.  My wife ordered the spicy \"pancakes\" and they are delicious.  They are so good, after tasting them I wished that I had ordered them myself.  I don't recall what the other family enjoyed but they all raved about their breakfasts.  The kids ordered something that they enjoyed,  it kept them busy and the left full....  good sign!  We have friends that brunch at Soul Cafe regularly and they always send us happy, smiling pictures enjoying the Moscow Mules!  You cannot beat this place for breakfast, lunch and dinner!  Bottom line, we will be back frequently!"}
{"text":"Eric and Juan were our servers. We came here for our anniversary. Never heard of be place until we yelped it but I'm glad we did. My wife had the house salad and I had the salmon on corn cakes. Absolutely delicious. I had to refrain from licking the  plate. For dessert we had the peach pie. Delicious! For drinks I had the blueberry rye. Very tasty. We sat next to the live guitar player. He was great and not too loud. The servers made the experience enjoyable. Very friendly and made recommendations if we come back for breakfast, which we will! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch with an old friend because I'm constantly being told that it's amazing. I was not let down. I had a phenomenal brie sandwich there. The environment is nice and calming. There's a patio. I love that you don't feel crowded here. The tables are spaced well - they aren't just trying to cram people in. I'd REALLY like to try brunch here one day. I hear it's top notch. I've also been told that their special brunches (mother's day, Easter, etc.) are amazing and reservations should be made if you want to get in - ALWAYS a good sign."}
{"text":"The BEST pancakes I've her had. Definitely get the bacon, blue pancake. Also, had the Heavenly Hash with filet that was amazing. Bloody Mary was just spicy enough. Our server, Lexi, was extremely knowledgeable of the menu and she didn't steer us wrong on recommendations. Can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"All I have to say is................. LEMON RICOTTA PANCAKES!!! We have to go back in a few days for a second dose of these delicious pancakes. Not only are they the best pancakes we have ever had out, they are huge. Two people can share."}
{"text":"I love this place for breakfast. They have massive fluffy pancakes, the best jalapeno bacon, unique breakfast cocktails. I've been here countless times and have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"For three years I have seen this restaurant, perfectly in my back yard, but every time I look inside or glance the menu I just didn't pull the trigger.  Well I should have.  Soul Cafe is steadily cooking up some flavorful food.  My wife and I finally went in on a recommendation of some friends.  These friends are new to AZ about the same time as us and coming from Chicago they seem to have the same food expectations as my wife and I.  So today we visited for a late lunch.  I was impressed by the sandwich descriptions, notably the Arizona Cheese Steak and the 4B's & 1T but I was looking for something lighter.  I chose the Mahi Mahi Fish Tacos following another Yelp reviewers advice and my wife ordered a Tuna on Sourdough.  The Mahi was perfectly done and clearly a fresh cut of fish as it had beautiful color, firmness and mild flake.  Soul Cafe chars a the edges of the street taco shell that gives the dish a light smoke.  That smoke is then well balanced with a slaw highlighted by a fine diced apple. My wife's tuna fish salad on sourdough was perfectly toasted and the albacore had a mild flavor that typically you cannot get from canned tuna.   I didn't ask, but I suspect the tuna is fresh as well.  My only negatives have nothing to do with the food.  The interior restaurant decor is bordering on tired and drab; like the decor of a home built in the late 90's.  Some paint and new chair/booth fabric would go a long way.  Also, the staff act and are dressed below expectations.  So much so that the waiter who presented to our table was initially mistaken for the busboy as he never identified himself as the waiter and like the other staff here (granted it was the end of the lunch service) had dried food splatter on his shirt and waist apron.  We were in a hurry so this review is limited.  If you read my other reviews, we typically go to restaurants with a small crowd and sample the menu extensively.  As we return, I pledge to update this review and get through the menu in time.  The hostess mentioned that breakfast and brunch are the restaurant's real strength.  I can't wait."}
{"text":"My girlfriends and I wanted a new place for happy hour and tried Soul Cafe.  Only alcoholic drinks were offered during happy hour.  We decided to order from the menu.  Atmosphere is nice, food is tasty and service was good.  Our server was very attentive and friendly.  We ordered mac and cheese with lobster, salmon tacos and a salad.  All were yummy.   We wanted something to munch while we were waiting.  They charged us for a few pieces of french bread....really?? I do wish they offered tapas or happy hour deals because there were a number of items I would have liked to try."}
{"text":"We had been to Alma before they closed, but this was our first time at Soul Cafe.  The service was phenomenal.  Our server gave us nice recommendations and even made up a special appetizer for us that was not on the menu.  He also went out of his way to make sure everything was great.  We sat outside and although it was a hot evening, the misters kept us comfortable.  My husband ordered the mahi mahi over dirty rice and it was delicious.  I had the butternut squash enchiladas.  They were fine, but next time (and there will be a next time!) I will try something different.  We also had the key lime pie and it was wonderful - especially the crust!!  This would be a great place to bring out of town guests as the menu is so unique with great southwestern flavors.  Looking forward to trying Soul Cafe for breakfast!"}
{"text":"Second time here, after being so very impressed our first time round.  The overall feel of the restaurant and the breakfast menu is southwestern. The various wood accents and flooring - the  copper ware and copper toned colors, the art work on the walls that resembles the slot canyons, all blend beautifully together to complement the menu.  Our first visit we tried one of the \"soul creations\", the \"Crazy Biscuits\".  A large and fluffy biscuit topped with an amazing pork sausage gravy and a green pork chili. Both were incredibly flavorful. And the side of roasted potatoes was a combination of different types such as sweet potatoes and purple Peruvian , seasoned perfectly.  I would say that pancakes are the staples here, because they are beautifully executed, and so behemoth that your family of four can feast on one order.   Amongst all the selections such as blueberry bacon and  Lemon ricotta pancakes and the \"some like it hot\" with corn, zucchini, cilantro, red pepper, jalapeno, we selected the lemon per recommendation. And wow they were more mind blowing! The creamy cheese blended with lemons actually oozed out between bites. Between the three of us, only half the pancake was consumed.  That leads me to the next: portions are very very generous. You can easily order one item off the menu to share, and spend the rest on their delectable morning cocktails.   \"Soul's famous bloody Mary\"  with a house made jalapeño infused bacon vodka mixed with souls Mary mix, topped with jalapeño bacon and a Bleu cheese stuffed olive is a must for Mary lovers. Lighter offerings are the \"Sunrise\" with grey goose and l'orange, Grenadine and oj.   Average cost of a breakfast entree is $12-14, but worth the money with portion size and superb quality.  Service has been very quick and efficient, everyone seems to know the menu, and all staff are attentive.  Soul features all you can eat chicken night with buttermilk fried chicken, fish fry's, pizza night, and a number of other specialty nights. Sign up for their VIP email list. You will always know about new menu items and specials as well.  I hope to make this place a regular destination for our family, since we have only visited for breakfast."}
{"text":"SOUL CAFE is a snazzy southwestern-ish cafe that is modern yet eclectic. Unique artwork dresses up the walls and the giant bull skull with the even larger rosary upon its head is awesome! The bar was full of brunchers and early lunchers; we fell somewhere in between.  For a Saturday the place wasn't too busy, which in turn, let us experience attentive service at the bar. I love the jalapeño bacon Bloody Mary served here, the  Mr. Went with an original. He did not love his. Too much mix for him he had to order an extra shot. Minus the star for being charged after we said that the Mary was not quite contrary ( no offer of a re-make ) $8 for the Bloody Mary, $7 for the extra shot left him feeling kinda meh. His tune changed once he received his breakfast lol! He went with the Crazy Cowboy and that got him moaning sounds of mmmm mmm goodness! The only publicly acceptable moans haha! I tried their lemon ricotta pancakes, totally loved them! Portions were huge I didn't even put a dent.  Great time, great food! A place to take a friend/love that appreciates creative and hearty food. A 4 star, \" better than most, let's make a toast\" to Soul Cafe!"}
{"text":"I have always reserved multiple Yelps of the same place for occasions when I think that the service and food has remained at the same level or better than the original shout-out.   It has been a bit over two years that Peg and I first went to this location, shortly after it opened.  We had been going to Heart and Soul (the original mother ship) for years and were thrilled that Sheila et al were coming to the 'hood. Since that time, we have been going minimally 3 times a month (breakfast and dinner).  This last Wednesday, one of our regular nights, we again were enjoying the fried chicken special. This special has been incredibly popular, for good reason, because of the ongoing, consistent great food, service, and fantastic price. While this special is incredibly under priced, the remainder of the menu is very reasonable and worth every penny.  We have been pleased to take first-timers who are now supporters. It is like introducing good friends. If you have seen (or can find the episode) of  Check Arizona in which three people critique restaurants, it will not surprise you that Soul received excellent reviews. Chef Sheila was interviewed by Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives (via Guy Fieri and The Food Network).   Breakfast and lunch are served daily with dinners on Tuesdays through Saturdays. I strongly recommend that you try this place...and support our local talent.  This is one of our top 5 for breakfast, and dinner as well. While not in the area for lunch...the other meals are stellar....why would lunch be an exception?!  Dr. B"}
{"text":"Tasty, unique breakfast options sets this place apart from the sea of mediocre breakfast options out there.  Everything was on point.  Excellent service as well."}
{"text":"Personally I think it's a little over priced for soul food.  But I had good company.  So it was wonderful.  The fried avocado balls appetizer was very good.  The dinner entree portion is generous.  But I like their pie the best.  Individually made mini pie that's big enough to share between two people.  The blueberry pie is very sweet."}
{"text":"Dear lord are the Jalapeño Bacon Bloody Mary's amazing.  Great way to wake up and get started in the morning.  Yes, morning can be 1:43pm if done right. The food quality is great, consistent, and priced reasonably."}
{"text":"I've been to a few places now for bingsu and this place is not bad. While limited, their menu has a few items that I haven't seen at some of the other places, such as Sweet Potato Pizza, Waffles, and Toast.  My friend had the Injeolmi bingsu, a more traditional offering, and I had the mango. This version added grapefruit for a contrast of flavour and colour. It was good but I've had better.  My friend didn't finish hers. I think she said something about too much condensed milk. I tried it and it wasn't bad but injeolmi just isn't my thing. I'll stick to mango and other fruits."}
{"text":"This is my favorite breakfast spot. Not a quick before work type eatery, but a come when you are hungry, sit back, relax, and enjoy type. Have a morning cocktail, they are worth  it. Honestly you can order any item on the menu and be satisfied, at least I always have been. The chef confidently pairs and constructs dishes to delight. Unless it's an allergy you are worried about, don't subsititute, just enjoy the art on your tongue. Of note, its secret is out, so I recommend making a reservation. Ambiance tends to be one with energy so I prefer mornings to enjoy when my energy level is also high. Try the specials, they are stunning!"}
{"text":"In terms of Bingsoo- it was alright. Nothing too special from the other Bingsoo cafes.   This cafe is self serve so in terms cleanliness it wasn't the best. The tables were sticky, however, they were nice to help us wipe it and everything.   I would recommend this place if you are in a large group to chat and eat. Not a place to study cafe, more of a group chilling cafe"}
{"text":"THE BAD:  Me and a friend decided to give this a try after a another referred us. It was a Sunday morning, close to noon....and let me tell you...it was PACKED. After a long hike, standing for about 65 minutes is not what you want to do. I don't know if this place takes reservations, but it took a while. We were patient though. For all you impatient people, you should think about that.   THE GOOD:  The food, definitely made up for it though. The pancakes are unreal, along with the maple syrup! Coffee was OK. I was very content afterwards due to the quality/preparation of the food and customer service. If I'm ever around the Scottsdale/Fountain Hills area...I will find myself here most likely, and you should too!"}
{"text":"Thanks to Eric, our awesome waiter,  for the menu suggestions! We loved the lemon riccota pancakes and bacon blue pancakes! We will definitely be back! Great service and great food!"}
{"text":"The pumpkin pancakes were awesome with cranberry syrup!  Sat out on the patio with my family and eat a wonderful Sunday breakfast!!  The food is always awesome!!"}
{"text":"We went there for lunch on the weekend. we both had sandwiches; one chicken salad and the other tuna salad. I wanted soup (it was chilly outside) but they don't have soup. What??? They don't have SOUP? That's cray cray! So we had irish coffees instead to warm us up. Did the trick!  Honestly, I make an amazing chicken salad and a really, really good tuna salad. Their versions beat mine. I left the restaurant humbled, but with a doggie bag so I could dissect the sandwiches later to figure out their secret.  I'm ashamed to admit that I ate the experiment before I had a chance to accurately determine their ingredients. I'll be back. Oh, yes, I'll be back ! Buahahahahaha!"}
{"text":"Limited menu, but what's on it is good for both breakfast and lunch; they do offer daily specials. Decent Happy Hour. Two patios, bar, and kid friendly."}
{"text":"Soul Cafe is one of my north Scottsdale favorites. I've lived in the Grayhawk area for 5 years and love this casual dining restaurant for every meal of the day. The chef comes up with tasty food combinations each week so the menu never gets old. My family loves the Wednesday night all you can eat buttermilk chicken. My wallet does too!  Friendly service, good food and great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"I really like Soul Cafe. I used to go to Original Breakfast House but they stopped accepting credit and debit cards, so I've chosen to spend my hard earned dollars elsewhere.   Soul cafe has excellent food quality. Their chicken fried steaks and green Chile are excellent. Pancakes and sausages are great. Sometimes the wait is a little bit long, but it's well worth it."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch with my family, and oh man the food and drinks are amazing. The heavenly hash is awesome, so is the biscuits and gravy. Most importantly of all, however, is the Bloody Mary. The Bloody Mary is amazing and comes with all the desired fixins! Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"I had only been to the Soul Cafe two times before and actually enjoyed the food and service.  Unfortunately, my third experience was a nightmare.  The food was delicious but the service was horrendous.   One of the waiters was rude and inappropriate.  The other waiter was rude, rude and just plain rude.  When the bill came, they left off a major part of the food then proceeded to present us with a second bill.    Some us didn't get the food we ordered and then the waiters tried to argue with us about what we ordered.  It was a disaster!  Have no intention of returning."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and even better food! Came here for breakfast for the first time this morning. The staff is friendly and helpful. The food speaks for itself! Try the lemon ricotta pancake!!"}
{"text":"This place is always packed especially on Sunday for their brunch but the wait is always worth it.  My wife and I travel from North Peoria just to eat at this wonderful restaurant in North Scottsdale.  Our server Kaitlin was awesome and always kept our drinks full without having to ask.  She was very genuine with us.  We always come back but will request her from now on."}
{"text":"Great place! The food is out of this world and the service is spectacular! I definitely recommend Soul Cafe!"}
{"text":"went there for a dessert round and we were not disappointed! we ordered the black sesame shaved ice and their injeolmi toast which was perfect for three people to share. the black sesame shaved ice was really creamy and there was so much flavour of black sesame, which i always appreciate and loooooove! injeolmi was really yummy as well - had a subtle sweetness and perfect for those who don't crave extreme sweet things.   service was very friendly and quick - though it was a packed cafe at 9pm, they got our food out in 15 minutes. they also give small bowls out w shaved iced so you can share with your friends without dipping your spoon in the bowl. will definitely be visiting again!   parking was rough though! we luckily found a spot by the edge of a row of cara but pretty sure the row of cars weren't in proper parking areas"}
{"text":"Late review. Came here with a few friends a couple weeks ago after Korean bbq. Great place for dessert when you are craving something sweet after a hearty Korean meal.   On an early Friday evening, the cafe was already pretty packed. We were able to grab a table. We ordered a small green tea shaved ice. The portion is decent enough to shared among the three of us (but we were pretty full), but in general I would recommend to get a large to share.  It was the first time my friends tries Korean shaved ice, and they were impressed.  I liked that it was not too sweet and I love the mochi!   By the time we left, more people came in. Some were not able to get seats. So keep in mind to come early for a table on a friday."}
{"text":"Great restaurant, great service and great food. This place was amazing. They serviced authentic Mexican dishes, with multiple recco's and answered every question we had."}
{"text":"The pancakes are large and are probably the best item on the menu. Coffee was excellent. The omelets are just average. If you are looking for a breakfast joint, try Egg and Joe or First Watch."}
{"text":"Our favorite local spot. Conor and Sean are great behind the bar and always make us feel welcomed. Great food and very friendly atmosphere. Lobster mac and cheese is excellent when available. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"We visited this restaurant on 11/6 for lunch.  Our order of Cobb Salad and a hot pastrami sandwich took 40 minutes to get to the table.  We were just standing up to leave when it arrived.  We had already gotten an apology from the server but no real explanation for why such simple dishes were taking so long.    The salad was at nearly room temperature and the sandwich was only luke warm.  Neither was remarkable with the pastrami seemingly thrown on the plate in an unappetizing manner.  This is very common run of the mill food - nothing special at all.  There was little care taken to honor our choice of going there for lunch from the time it took to get the food to the temperature of the food.  It had clearly sat around for a while before we got it.  Rarely have we ever had to consider leaving a restaurant.   You put customers in an awkward spot when they've ordered food, asked you to prepare it, then you lose interest and put people in the position of considering walking out.  Just wonderful customer relations.  Perhaps you may want to consider repairing your web mail portal so you can get responses first hand ?"}
{"text":"Delicious food the serving takes a little while but once it comes you will forget about that and indulge in the delicious food!! I live this place and I go with my family 2 kids 2 adults and we love the place it is tasty and the waiters and waitresses are incredibly nice!!"}
{"text":"I love this spot! Its so good and the portion to price is pretty fair. Would go again. Got the injeolmi flavour and black sesame. I really like that they layer the sprinked flavoursing inside the bingsoo as well."}
{"text":"Great little place. Food was excellent. Great portions for the price. And the staff from waitress to hostess are beyond excellent and friendly.  .... Edit ... I've had to drop this to a 2 star review. At one point this was a great place, but last 2 experiences especially the last were abysmal. Went in for brunch, they must have been under staffed, took a while to get a server (should have been the first sign). But after that the food took over an hour to receive. There was never an apology by the manager or anything. No one managing expectations. By the time we realized how bad it was we had already waited 30-40 min."}
{"text":"Two issues: the food was undercooked and the music was way too loud. I ordered duck, and had to saw through a piece to try it. It was a little dark in the restaurant, so I used my flashlight and looked. Yep, it was raw. My friend had asparagus and it, too, was not \"al dente\" - it was almost raw.   I sent the duck back and it came back acceptable. Not bad at all. But the other problem was the music. The guys in the back were jamming enthusiastically, and conversation was impossible. We weren't even that close to them, either.  It was not a comfortable experience and we did not linger over the meal. Maybe that was the point. The place was full, so others may not have minded the music.  I hear it's good for breakfast and lunch, and I may try one of those. But I would never go back for dinner.  If someone at the restaurant reads this review, please don't contact me. I've had that happen and it makes me not trust Yelp."}
{"text":"Was looking forward to a leisurely Saturday breakfast with friends.  We decided to sit outside it was chilly for Arizona asked waitress to turn on heaters.  She said she would get someone waited 10 minutes and we finally went inside to ask manager.  As our coffee arrived creamer was chunky so asked for new cups.  Menu was great we ordered and was halfway thru meal and found d 4-5 possibly beard hairs in food caused whole table to loose appetite.   Asked to speak w manager his reply \"worse think that could happen was not sincere!  12 dollars was taken off bill and we all left nauseated.   Terrible service which does show w terrible management.   Ask for the hair and eggs special!!"}
{"text":"We have been here numerous times for lunch.  The BLT Chicken salad is a favorite as well as the salmon salad and spinach, strawberry salad.  I also like the way the prepare the corned beef and coleslaw sandwich.  I've never had anything there I didn't like.  The dinner menu has some delicious choices and certain time of the year they offer an all you can eat buttermilk battered chicken which was excellent. The wait staff is always friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"During my 4* birthday weekend with my girls we stopped here and had an awesome breakfast! The owner and our waitress Sheri were AWESOME!!!"}
{"text":"AMAZING BREAKFAST!!  Food takes a long time but they tell you that up front because it's all made from scratch...ours took like 45 minutes but they comped the meal so it was fine and they were nice about it.  Yeah, they messed up the order obviously but the food was SO AWESOME I would go back.  It is a bit pricey though...just fyi"}
{"text":"I am always on the lookout for a great breakfast joint and I may have found exactly that! Here are a few reasons why Soul Café should be on your short list of must visit brunch spots in North Scottsdale!  - You can bring your fur baby! Yep, their patio is dog friendly! - Service was friendly and efficient - Soul's Famous Bacon Bloody Mary lives up to it's word! It really should be famous, one of the best bloody Mary's in the valley. -  They have a super diverse breakfast menu, there is something for everyone!  So, go and order a famous bloody mary... I ordered the Some Like it Hot which was two small sweet savory cakes made with corn, zucchini, red pepper, cilantro, jalapeno, and onion served with two eggs and their jalapeno infused bacon which was pretty flippin' fabulous and eat and drink yourself into brunch oblivion."}
{"text":"Yes! Wide variety of breakfast options. Humongous tasty pancakes. Full bar. Upscale decor. Will return often."}
{"text":"I've tried a several bingsu spots ever since it became a craze and I saw loads of posts on it flooding my Instagram. This spot was reccomend by a Korean friend and is my favorite spot for Korean bingsu! The serving and presentation of the various bingsus are not only picture worthy but worthy to be enjoined and shared... or not shared if you're sweet tooth needs satisfying! The cafe's location is quite cozy as well as spacious unlike The Cups or Snow Time, I also feel that the bingsus here are more loaded and packed with toppings in comparison to the other bingsus spots I've tried. My two top favorites are Coffee (the textures from the cereal crunch makes it that much more fun to enjoy) and the Matcha (loaded with lots of chewy mochi!) Am happy to recently learn that a location has been made in pmall on the lower level which isn't too far from me, though it's a walk in spot rather than a sit in cafe."}
{"text":"Never a problem when I come here for Sunday brunch. Always prompt service, friendly and warm interactions, and the food is always on point. I've probably had almost everything on the menu and haven't had a single complaint. The chilaquelas are a solid choice! So is the crazy cowboy. All pancakes are bigger than your head, my favorite being lemon ricotta. Any dish with the green pork chili is the shizzle!"}
{"text":"WORST restaurant experience I've EVER had!  I was so excited to try this place since it's walking distance from my house & owned by Heart & Soul Café (which I really enjoy).  This restaurant is going to give Heart & Soul a bad reputation if they keep doing business they way they are now.    We went this morning with friends that were visiting and about to leave town.  The waitress wasn't very attentive which would have been fine if we would have ever gotten our food.  We ordered right away since we had 2 infants with us & our company wanted to get on the road.  We waited 1hour 15 minutes for our food (which we never received).  After about 30 minutes the waitress completely stopped coming by our table so we had no idea what was taking so long.  We all had empty drinks & never got a coffee refill or anything.  We finally tracked her down to ask what was taking so long & was told the kitchen just received a bunch of tickets at once & was backed up but all of the food was starting to come up.  There were only 4 of us, but for whatever reason tables of 2 were coming after us & getting their food.  I had a direct view into the kitchen & they were SO disorganized.  The kitchen staff was fighting & yelling at each other (loud enough to hear in dining room) & wait staff was going in yelling at them. It was very unprofessional because it was all in view of our table & we were listening to their fighting the whole time we were sitting there.  We finally decided after 1 hour 15 minutes & absolutely no communication or service from our waitress that we had to leave.  The babies (who were being angels) were starting to get restless & our friends were past when they needed to be on the road home.  When we told our waitress we were leaving she just said sorry then walked into the kitchen & yelled 'don't make the food for table 30'.  So after all this time we receive nothing but the word 'sorry' & find out that they STILL hadn't even made our food.  The restaurant was not near busy enough to even begin to make an excuse for having not even made breakfast that had been ordered over an hour before.  Then the fact that nothing was even said to try and make things right when we left.  I will be very surprised if this place is in business long. They had an opportunity to be a great neighborhood breakfast place & I would have loved for it to be but I will never go back here after the poor service we received on so many levels."}
{"text":"Three of us came here for dinner. We were caught between the lunch and dinner service. Twenty minutes to go, we decided to have lunch. All three of us ordered a hamburger. I ordered the the Bacon Blue Burger and it's 10 oz patty. The burger was so-so, it's the rest of the condiments that rescued the burger. Wasn't sure what came with the burger 'cause the menu didn't mention french fries. The fries were a mixture of potato and sweet potato, cooked just right, not limp.The burger didn't have very much grease so the bun stayed dry and manageable. The price for dinner is pretty pricey, so we'll stick to breakfast/lunch."}
{"text":"What a wonderful experience!! I expected delicious food but not the exceptional se  We started our evening with the Brussels sprouts appetizer which was delicious as it was laced with bacon and dried cranberries in a yummy glaze. My husband and I split the bacon and egg salad and the squash enchiladas. The flavors were wonderful! My brother had the meatloaf. Thumbs up!!  Pies are their specialty and so we had to share the apple pie with a sweet roll inside al a mode. The pie crust is the best I've ever had (except my mom's) and I'm going to try their pot pie in the future.  Now the service! Wow!! MacKenzie was our server and was attentive and friendly....then Eric the chef/manager came over and delighted us with his passion about their food, customers and employees! Soon others came by to welcome us and thank us for coming. When we left we felt like friends!!   I recommend Soul Cafe and we will return soon!   We had so much fun at dinner that we returned the next morning for breakfast. We had another wonderful experience. My favorite breakfast when I go out is pancakes and so happy I had the combo pancake dish. My husband enjoyed his chiliquillies! Once again, I recommend for breakfast too!!"}
{"text":"After a 2 year absence due to a bad experience, we went back with friends.  We had an \"acceptable\" night.  Service and food was OK.    We probably wouldn't good there on our own but if friends wanted to go there, we wouldn't object."}
{"text":"Excellent in every way We love the Friday fish special The breakfasts we've had were always great Had the trout last night and it was outstanding Never have had a problem of any kind The place is always full"}
{"text":"Although a friend recommended this place, our first visit to Soul Cafe produced some positive and negative results.   Positives: Great atmosphere- clean, neat, and friendly.  We arrived for breakfast and were promptly seated - which was great for a Saturday morning. Our server was Amanda (AWESOME!). Service was great. Amanda brought us coffee and water, gave us time to order and was friendly, helpful and quick! Our food arrived fairly quickly -  a definite plus. Amanda also returned several times to refill our coffee and to check to make sure everything was OK. We could not ask for a better waitress!  Negatives: Food is pricey, especially for breakfast. Two omelets (one was $12 and one $13) and two coffees was $33 and change, add a tip and we were at $40 dollar breakfast. Yes, I understand it is Scottsdale, but if it wasn't for the service, it would have been a total loss.  The food: We both ordered omelets - my husband ordered The Works and I ordered the Mediterranean Sausage. Both were bland, bland, bland. There was spinach and red pepper in mine but I did not taste either. The feta had a tad of a flavor when I ate a piece separately and the sausage only hinted at what could have been an awesome dish, however, overall, the omelet was not even close to expectations. My husband's only comment was that it tasted like he was eating nothing except for the bits of raw onion. Even the rye bread used for the toast was tasteless. On a good note, the little side of potatoes were well cooked and they had a tinge of unexpected sweetness.  The only reason we might return is to taste the pancakes that so many reviews rave about. If we return, we will be sure to request seating in Amanda's section."}
{"text":"I am sitting eating the Blueberry pie as I write this. It has the perfect crust, and is served with ice cream! Our server Eric was extremely attentive and helpful making recommendations because it is our first time dining. I got the avocado pasta and my friend got the blackened mahi. The mahi is some of the best I have ever had. We will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"WOW!!  Its about time a unique and delicious restaurant moves up in our area!  I mean there are many wonderful restaurants up here that are great.....but....Soul Cafe has great, fresh, food with reasonable prices, and they offer a very unique menu that we love! The menu they offer is very special and different from most, the salads sound fantastic!  My husband and I have been to this restaurant 3x's this week.  2x for breakfast and tonight for WEDNESDAYS FRIED CHICKEN!  It was amazing.  Of course I ordered the country gravy on the side....but I could not resist using most all of it!  And its ALL YOU CAN EAT....the portions were large, so neither of us could possibly ask for 2nd's! We enjoyed every bite!    Breakfast is also amazing!  The pancakes are so light and fluffy.  My husbands favorite was the burrito, it was huge and he ate it all up!  My son-in-law ordered their famous BLOODY MARY....and is was the most unique yet outrageous bloody mary I have ever seen or tasted.  I tasted his and had a hard time giving it back!  I would have ordered my own...but normally I never really go for a bloody mary!  go figure....delicious!   To top it off, the staff offers excellent customer service and the Chef herself has been out every time we have been there making sure everyone is delighted with her food!   I can't wait to go back and try out the salads!  I noticed the price point on the salads is also excellent!  I am already thinking about which salad I should try first!  They are all up my ally!  Kale and beets.....or the WEDGE.....or....hum...yum!   I highly recommend this restaurant as it offers something most restaurants don't.....a very unique menu!"}
{"text":"We've heard great things about Soul Cafe...we went there Tuesday Dec. 20,2016...at 11:19 am we asked if we could have lunch...the server told us they do not give lunch menus out until 11:30...seriously??? Train your staff better....Jack in the Box has better service!!! Maybe the server should have told us...\"lunch isn't available for 11 minutes if you're willing to wait\"...but NO mention of that...."}
{"text":"I've been here twice.  My first experience was awful.  After being seated for 15 minutes and having at least 5 different servers all make eye contact with us as they were tending to people who had been seated after us, my husband, daughter and I walked out.  The second time we went, the service was only marginally better.  The server was okay, but only good enough to get a \"c\" grade.  Never once did she or anyone else even ask how our food was once delivered.  She made it seem like we were an unwanted obligation.    I will say that the food is truly amazing.  The green chile pork is wonderful and the have the best mimosas I've ever drank.  There are so many items in the menu that I'm excited to try but only if the level of service improves--it definitely sets a negative tone for the entire meal.  Can good food be ruined by bad service? Without a doubt!!! I will give this place one last shot and hope that the third time I a charm."}
{"text":"This is the second location for Soul Cafe in North York. They offer Korean shaved ice (bingsu), which is a refreshing, slightly milky, fine ice, loaded with various toppings such as matcha, black sesame, injeolmi, fruits, etc. This location is slightly smaller than the original, but feels a bit more modern.  It's serve-yourself cafe where you order and pay, then pick-up at the counter. My friends and I each ordered a small bingsu, the flavors were coffee, injeolmi, and cream puff. The injeolmi (soybean powder) also had bits of mochi, almonds and condensed milk, while the coffee one came with a scoop of coffee icecream, various cereal, and chocolate sauce. The one I got was the cream puff one. It came with a mountain of frozen cream puffs (tastes similar to costco cream puffs, which I really like anyways), whipped cream, one strawberry, and a lot of condensed milk. It was one of the sweeter bingsu. I usually don't like sweet things, but since it was something cold, I wasn't too overwhelmed by the sugar. The amount of cream puffs they put on the small is definitely enough to satisfy two people.  Overall, I had a great time. White was the main color in the cafe so the whole place felt bright. The atmosphere is very casual, there are some students doing homework there and taking full advantage of the free wifi."}
{"text":"Returned for my second visit yesterday.  After some indecision as to where I was going to sit (outside, or in?), I first asked to be seated outdoors, because soon the weather will be too warm to do so, but the noise from passing motorcycles made me want to move indoors.  Besides, it smelled great inside!  Crystal sat me at one of the tables near the entrance, by some windows (like I wanted), next to the bar.  I immediately noticed that the multi-page menu was replaced by a double-sided one sheet menu, and I especially noted the increase in prices!  And they weren't 50 cents here, $1 there, either.  The same two pancake dishes that cost $9.99 four days ago were now $11.99, and the Chicken-friend Steak & Eggs that cost me $10.99 then now costs $14.99.  What was going on??  I figured if a place was going to significantly raise their prices, then there would be a jolt, no matter if it happened the day after I first visited, or just yesterday morning...  I had just checked-in with the Yelp app when Crystal delivered the cup of coffee I'd ordered and gave me a few minutes to look at the menu.  I placed my order of pancakes, mix-and-match of Lemon-ricotta and Granola-raspberry, and the Crazy Biscuits.  When Crystal left to input the order, I noticed that their Two-Good-Two-Be-True entree (two pancakes of your choice, \"but not Bacon Blue,\" two eggs your way, and two sausage links, or bacon strips) would've only cost me an extra $1.  I quickly thought that I probably would not have wanted the eggs anyway, since I had two entrees coming, but it would've been a good chance for Crystal to upsell... It took about ten to fifteen minutes to receive my food, and were they lovely to look at!  I wondered, however, why the lemon-ricotta pancake was presented to me upside-down, especially since it was the topper to the two-pancake dish.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/soul-cafe-scottsdale?select=CMd7lJGfGp8YdWFJn6TTkw#CMd7lJGfGp8YdWFJn6TTkw  I understand that the scoops of ricotta looked lovely this way and probably would've gotten destroyed if flipped right-side up...  Tasted just as amazing yesterday as when I first had it four days ago!  Same results with the Granola-raspberry... Just wished the price hadn't increased so much... why??  The Crazy Biscuits were delightful, as well.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/soul-cafe-scottsdale?select=L34DPTxzCgE3Z8OYDy2Kaw#L34DPTxzCgE3Z8OYDy2Kaw  The green chili pork topper blew the sausage gravy away, so I suggest you try the pork gravy first before moving onto the chili pork.  Actually, what I suggest it that Soul Cafe just re-vamp this dish to be a split biscuit topped with green chili pork, and save the pork sausage gravy for the Chicken-fried steak & eggs entree.  Service was a bit lacking, and I was told that it was due to another server not showing up for work.  It was an hour before my cup of coffee was refilled, and that was after I requested for one and had to wait another ten minutes for Crystal to do so.  I saw many more people come in for breakfast yesterday, and there were not enough servers to deal with the influx of people.  Three stars' rating only for this visit, and that's because of the increase in pricing and the waiting for a refill-- I saw other servers walking around that could've come by refilling coffee...  It was half a day later, when I perused through my DVR titles that I noticed Soul Cafe was featured on the latest episode of \"Check Please! Arizona.\"  The mystery of the increase in prices explained!!  I fell asleep after watching the first episode I had taped (CPH, Sofrita).  Guess I'll watch all about Soul Cafe's bacon dishes and drinks tonight.  Congrats on being featured on the show, Soul Cafe.  I just hope that the increase in prices will allow you to up your customer service quality to meet the demands of your new-found fame."}
{"text":"I was a bit shocked at some of the negative reviews because our experience was very good. I should mention I did not pick up the check so I did not pay attention to prices.  My Eggs Jared was very good, and I am especially fond of bacon as opposed to ham on eggs benedict.  My wife raved about the hash she ordered.  My other friends enjoyed their dishes as well.   Service was good. Atmosphere was fine. We sat at a booth and the four of us were comfortable."}
{"text":"Came early with friends after dinner on a saturday and glad we did. By the time its 7pm people starting to come in and there's not a lot of tables nor seats available.   We ordered the strawberry  and the injeolmi shaved ice deserts. Both are highly recommended.The shaved ice texture is sooo smooth and you will really enjoy the different flavors. The strawberry tastes refreshing while the injeolmi is a unique flavor for me. Love love the mochi pieces.   Will come back to try the other flavors next time"}
{"text":"Food is great!!!! Ambience is terrific....but food took forever to come out...wasn't too busy and we shared one plate to order...had to box it when it came out and leave. Bummed."}
{"text":"Atmosphere was great, very friendly staff. Breakfast was still being served when we arrived around noon, which was perfect. The pancakes were huge, and I love how they have a lot of different kinds. However, they weren't as flavorful as other crazy pancakes we've had. For example, the lemon pancakes barely had a hint of taste of lemon, and the apple pancakes just tasted like normal pancakes with apple chunks in them. I'm the type of person who likes the flavor of the pancake to be all throughout, without being too overwhelming. The chicken and french toast was delicious, but the chicken was a little dry for my liking. Omelets and egg-based plates were great. The biscuits and gravy had a spicy kick to them, but were very flavorful and good. Would still definitely go back, though."}
{"text":"One of my worst experiences in life... first no credit, second mocha tastes was sweet and as you can see in the picture there is a chunk of coco powder in the bottom of my drink. They used such a bad tea bag for our tea. For the dessert they microwaved it. I came here because of high reviews, very disappointed! First and last time here"}
{"text":"Out for a new journey in breakfast land and decided it was time to try out Soul Cafe.  Please come with a very empty stomach!! You walk into a hip southwestern themed restaurant that is tastefully done.  Everyone was friendly and accommodating from beginning to end.   Now about the main part, the food. Attention to quality was a focus here.  We ordered the Biscuits and gravy, Too good to be true and Bacon blue pancakes.  The biscuits and gravy were good. My only negative was it had too many thick hunks of pepper but for the normal person it might be ok. They use a spicy sausage which is a nice twist. The pancakes were delicious. Big and fluffy and the bacon and blueberries were a great sweet/salty taste in your mouth.  I appreciated the higher quality of bacon they use because I am a picky bacon lover.  Over all a really great place to eat and enjoy your atmosphere at the same time. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I had a massive plate of blueberry and bacon pancakes - a delicious mix of salty and sweet maple syrup with crispy edges and chewy center. Eggs over easy and marble rye toast were well prepared. Beautiful interior and friendly staff."}
{"text":"my wife and her friends have been back twice and I have to share she loves the food!"}
{"text":"Great food and service. But never come here, especially for breakfast, if you aren't very hungry or can't take leftovers home with you. Massive pancakes - loved both apple cinnamon and raspberry."}
{"text":"Probably the best injeolmi(?) in Toronto, not to mention how reasonably priced and the cafe's providing ample toppings while layering the condensed milk between shaved ice.   Their other menu options are great, I tried their matcha bingsu, which I also thoroughly enjoyed. They also provide other treats if anyone isn't in the mood for some Korean shaved ice (but who actually isn't?), they carry La Rocca cakes as well. I've been eyeing their sweet potato cake so I'm excited to go back. Can't recommend enough!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed the food and had excellent service. Hubby had the steak medallions, I had the clams in a white wine broth, my son had the daily special pumpkin bisque and fries. All wonderful. Definitely recommend this place, and again, fantastic service."}
{"text":"This place has AMAZING food ! The chef is very creative and we have never been disappointed.  We have been here for breakfast, lunch and dinner, each one was exceptional.  I will admit that if you are in a hurry, it's not the best place to go.  The service at times can be a little slow, but on there behalf, they are becoming so popular that it is hard to stay on top of the crowds.   I can honestly say that we come here every sunday after church and wouldn't go anywhere else....even if service sometimes is a little slow ! It's well worth the wait !"}
{"text":"Excellent!!! Our waiter Shawn was great! Food portions were big and everything we had was YUMMY.  The music was fun and a nice surprise. Cocktail list was very unusual and all the ones we tried were good. Starters- bacon wrapped shrimp, pretzel nuggets and Brussels sprouts were DELISH! There were 6 of us and we all had something different. Frid chicken, flat iron steak, salmon, filet all our main courses were very, very tastie. The decore could use some work but, you soon overlook that  once you start eating. We'll be back next time we're in town."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to try this place out this morning, and that was a great decision!   The staff were attentive, helpful and friendly. The portions were HUGE and delicious! I ordered the bacon blueberry pancakes and barely made my way through half of the dish! It did not disappoint!  My husband ordered a breakfast special and could not believe how much food came out! I would definitely recommend and come back again!  Come hungry and leave happy!"}
{"text":"Had breakfast after church near the bar- ordered the lemon ricotta pancakes, which is served with a side of bacon, $13. You get two monster pancakes, so I definitely recommend sharing. I have a very healthy appetite and couldn't finish one of them. We also ordered regular pancakes for my friends daughter, which with 3 large cakes and a side of bacon or sausage. The portion is enough for an adult. Coffee was good, and they have several flavor cream options, which makes me happy. Only downer is the bacon was extra greasy. I don't drink bloody Mary's, but they looked tasty."}
{"text":"This place is nice and cozy with their sofas, artificial flowers, stuffed animals and home like decor.   We ordered 2 large hot real grapefruit tea. It came with real grapefruit pieces enough to be at least 1/2 of a grapefruit. Very worth the $5 spent on the drink. It wasn't actually tea though, but instead water with honey. So don't be fooled by the name.   Will come here again to try other things on their menu when I'm in the area. Great place to have a girls day out, not to mention this place is All-Day Brunch. Gotta love brunch!"}
{"text":"I ate these desserts for the first time. I heard these are very popular in Korea! It's very delicious. I went there with my friends. We were 4 people and we ordered two! They have two size, small and large! Large size is very big I expected! It was too much for us! I didn't eat cheesecake at this time, but cheesecake looks so delicious!! I'll try it next time!"}
{"text":"We can after seeing a yelp review. The shaved ice was really good. We had the injeolmi and the watermelon. It was soooooo tasty. The watermelon was very refreshing and the size was pretty big. We got 2for 4 people.   I would definitely come back"}
{"text":"Absolutely an excellent choice for brunch. Food & cocktails were deliciously on point! Cant wait to go again :)"}
{"text":"The Best Bloody Mary you will EVER Have!!!! The food is Excellent/..!We have never had a bad meal.... yesterday I tried the fresh greens salad, with feta cheese and Wild caught Salmon!!! YES IT REAL WILD CAUGHT SALMON; I knew it was wild from the first bite... NOT farm raised... It was sooooo good, will definitely be one of my go to's when I come back here again for lunch... Love that it's off the beaten path... Friendly staff. Very low noise level so you can actually have an uninterrupted conversation!  This is one of my most favorite places for lunch!"}
{"text":"Amazing food with pleasing ambience in a neighborhood eatery. Staff is friendly and seems to remember your favorites. Kind of hits it all: great cocktails, interesting and fun food and amazing breakfast too.  PLUS.....They permit dogs on patio!"}
{"text":"This place rocks! I always have the jumbo wet burrito for breakfast! Almost as big as your forearm, packed full of amazing breakfast burrito goodness, smothered with spicy pork green chili!. I swear its health food and keep you going all day! Try the pancakes too! You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Read other reviews so don't think I need to go into the decor, other than open and not cluttered. Tables acceptably spaced.  Live within a mile of this restaurant and don't know why we've never been before today.  Stopped for a late lunch.  It was hot outside, which really affects your appetite.  Husband I split pastrami sandwich, swiss cheese, dollop of coleslaw, side  of potato salad and pickle.  It was on a sweet bun that I prefer rather than rye. We loved it. Even though we split, I couldn't finish my half, big serving of pastrami!  Tried to go on a Sunday previously for a late breakfast but it was so crowded we didn't want to wait.  If it's that crowded they must be doing something right for breakfast in spite of the negative reviews I read.  If Soul Cafe reads these reviews--want to compliment our server, Eric.  Promised him we'd come back at dinner to have the pork chops that he highly recommended.  Will do Eric!"}
{"text":"French toast and bacon were good. The choclate pancakes were amazing & The service was excellent our server was Eric!"}
{"text":"This place was...all right. I'm not sure what they're looking to be. A ladies-who-lunch spot? (Pretty lucrative idea in this area.) A bar? (Huge Coors Light banner out front...wtf?)  One thing for sure, the menu was bor -ing. Huge snooze. There's nothing wrong with classics but throw me for a loop once in a while!   My boyfriend and I weren't very hungry, so we split the grilled veggie sandwich. Not sure why it's labeled as a veggie \"burger\" when it's grilled eggplant, onions, red peppers, tomatoes and provolone all stacked together. It was tasty, although there's no way anyone could eat it without a knife and fork, especially if they kept the chipotle mayo on--which we kept on the side. Their twist on fries was yummy: regular, purple and sweet potato chunks.   Service was nice but I thought it took too long for one sandwich when there were only 2 other tables on the patio (one that had already eaten) and 2 inside.  Nothing mind blowing, nothing terrible."}
{"text":"I recommend their potatoes and grilled veggies for sure. The service was amazing and our server Julie was the best"}
{"text":"Walked in and they seated us with no reservations.  Wednesday is their half half all you can eat fried chicken and mashed potatoes!  Right up my alley!  Wedge salad was awesome and service second to none with a smile. Get here early as they get busy"}
{"text":"Amazing food. The chef/owner Sheila is friendly and welcoming. The whole staff makes you feel welcome. Conner the bartender makes the most yummy drinks and treats you like family!The music and atmosphere is just what one needs to unplug and refresh from the busyness if life.."}
{"text":"I'd give them a 4.5 really, everything was amazing and superb service from Alberto. The only downside is the price, but you definitely get what you pay for. On quality and service I give them 5 stars.  Scrolling thru the negative reviews, they are almost all because the name led people to think the place serves soul food. Reading through the menu should clear that up.  I had the giant wet burrito. It is giant, it is good, and the Chile sauce is excellent.   They were very accommodating and attentive  to my wife's dietary restrictions. She got the blueberry pancakes. The pancakes are huge, light, and delicious, the best I have had in years.  Two thumbs up for this place!!!!"}
{"text":"Was looking for a close by breakfast joint and stumbled upon this little gem. I don't know why I had low expectations but they really came through. Service was fantastic, our very enthusiastic waitress gave us high fives after our order....apparently she was very encouraged about the process. But she was a delight! I had the country fried steak with green pork chili and rosemary potatoes. SO tasty. I also had to have the jalapeno infused bloody mary and the jalapeno bacon. For those spice connoisseurs: get these things. The bacon was unlike any bacon I have ever tried before. I didn't even think it was possible for bacon to get any better than it already is. This place nails it. Also the bloody mary was one of the best I have had in the alley. Excellently made and garnished. Hats off. The meal was a little pricey for 2 people but the portions are big so it's justified. Will definitely be back, thanks guys!"}
{"text":"Soul is a great place to eat and the service has always been nice and friendly BUT a special thanks to Kaitlin for the nicest smile and best service we've had really great service!"}
{"text":"Soul Cafe is a terrible value for dinner.  The price point per person is about $35 for food and a drink, and the food itself as well as the wine list is very good.  What kills it is that the interior is way too casual, the service way too unprofessional (you may think it's entertaining to have Fran Drescher as your server, but trust me after a long day that voice is the last thing you want droning on about today's specials), too slow and too inattentive.  Too many other diners dressed in wife beater t's and cutoffs at 7pm on a Friday night.  For some reason there were many tables with children running around (literally) and crying babies, so maybe families could enjoy a meal there if they can afford it?"}
{"text":"Yummy yummy! I ordered carry out breakfast this morning and was blown away. The eggs, bacon and especially the breakfast potatoes were amazing! This place easily ranks as the best breakfast In the Phoenix metro area. Can't wait to go back and try lunch or dinner!"}
{"text":"Such an interesting and delicious menu. Portions are large and quality is high. The strawberry mint quinoa (I know, sounds weird) omelette is fantastic, fresh and light. The pancakes are humongous and deeee-lish. Bloody Mary is incredible. Today we are trying bagel breakfast BLT and BBQ pulled pork and eggs. I will update.  Really top notch for Scottsdale. Lots of flavor."}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times, twice for brunch and once for dinner. This place is awesome. You can taste that the head chef and cooks are passionate about what they make. The chilaquiles, sausage, gravy and biscuit dish, and bloody Mary were super tasty! I wish I could come here every weekend for breakfast and for dinner. For dinner, The clams casino and steak tenderloin were excellent. The inside is big, not a whole lot of patio room. The service was great too."}
{"text":"Outstanding breakfast.   I double dare you to eat both bacon filled pancakes plus two eggs.   Impossible, even though they are delicious.   Great coffee and service. A bit on the pricey side, but such good value. Cannot wait to return."}
{"text":"The food is not bad but it is extremely overpriced unless you like to pay for the furniture. First of all I called an hour prior to us arriving asking if there was a happy hour just to get there and be told there was not one on Saturdays. After paying 100 for pizza and meatballs I am pretty disappointed in my experience. My husband ordered the meatloaf and it was good."}
{"text":"I'm a fan! The Bingsu is delicious and reminds us of the ones we had in Korea. Prices are very very reasonable and the small size is big enough to share with someone else. They have many interesting assortments of desserts and free parking in front of the cafe! Will definitely come back in the future."}
{"text":"The service is excellent, the potions are great and the food is outstanding.  The Chef/owner is a genius.  Great creations and has the highest respect from staff and patrons.  A rare accomplishment.  HIGHLY recommend."}
{"text":"An unexpectedly delicious restaurant in North Scottsdale. I have been here 3 times so far, all for brunch and it's always packed. Fortunately each time I have been able to snag a seat at the bar (so I can't speak for service at the tables). The bar staff is pleasant, but they can be fairly inattentive. I know they are busy, but 10 minutes for a \"hello\" and 15 minutes for waters seems extra slow. The food is delicious, the kitchen can also be slow, during one visit we waited almost 50 min for food. I suggest going in when you have plenty of spare time, have a mimosa and try the heavenly hash - it's soooooo good! Cheers!"}
{"text":"We have now been here three times and each time the food has been very good. The menu offers some very interesting and traditional items....but they are all served with a little bit of a twist.  We have never been disappointed.  The ambiance is great...very eclectic, which is very fun and relaxing.  The staff knows the menus, which is always a plus.  This will also be a great place to take out of town guests for something different."}
{"text":"The Soul Cafe is trying, but unfortunately they are not yet succeeding.  What they appear to be trying to be is a fine dining experience with a casual atmosphere and an interesting menu that leans towards comfort food.  The prices reflect this, but there are problems with every aspect of the restaurant.  1.  Ambiance - the Soul Cafe is new, clean, and attractive.  The tables, however, especially in the main area, are extremely close together.  They have put a small band (2 players) and a tiny dance floor in the middle of the space.  When there is music, it is very loud in parts of the restaurant and virtually inaudible elsewhere.  Where it is loud people try to talk over the music and the result is a very noisy eating environment.  Whatsmore, the music consists of standard ballads and is just a touch better than the piped-in variety  2.  Service - they didn't have our reservation, so I showed them the e-mail confirmation.  \"Oh\", they said \"Open Table - we have trouble with them.\"  I noted that it was their choice to put Open Table on their website.  The response was to put us on the list of people without reservations - at the bottom of the list.  We had to call the manager to even get a table.  Once we did, the waitress was formally polite but generally uncaring and inattentive (for example, no water; did not replace our used silverware after the appetiser; generally nowhere in sight).  All of this might have been overlooked were in not for #3.  3.  Food - the menu is interesting but the execution is ... well, it's poor.  For example, the trout was totally unseasoned and bland.  Someone had made the shrimp-wrapped bacon by slapping a piece of bacon on a shrimp and burning it -- no sauce, no flavor -- could have been done by a five-year old.  The flatbread was soggy, the cheese was tasteless, the pepperoni was tasteless (they use the large deli-style which is not as heavily seasoned as the smaller format).  I guess it takes talent to make a totally flavorless pepporoni pizza, so you could say they have a talented chef.   My advice: keep the building, lose the music, spread out the tables, train your servers, get real cooks, and create a reservation system that works.  For now, the second star is only because of the effort."}
{"text":"making this place a habit.  everyone there is so nice too.  kim always has a smile.  Vince is fantastic"}
{"text":"No chance we'll be returning. From start to finish, our dining experience was terrible. I'll just give some quick highlights-- waited 10 minutes before I finally went inside to get my own menus. No water was given to us on a HOT morning. Our waitress was the least friendly person on the face of the earth. waited 45 minutes for our breakfast. Food was not good.   It was a very disappointing experience. There are too many brunch places in Scottsdale to return."}
{"text":"they have this new snowflake ice machine, so their bingsoo taste like sulbing!  I'm lactose intolerant so I don't really drink milk, but I have to have their bingsoo even if that means I get sick. injulmee (rice cake) bingsoo is the best. their Dojima roll is also very tasty. their sweet potato pizza is not actually a pizza, it's a pizza toppings on tortilla but I actually like how it's super thin crust lol."}
{"text":"The food here is great. I have gone for breakfast & always ordered pancakes. The lemon ricotta ones are the best. I like the atmosphere. The servers are very friendly."}
{"text":"Tried the Melon Bingsoo and it was sooooo bomb!   Soul cafe is self serve - you basically seat yourself and go to the counter to order. When we ordered the melon Bingsoo they had told us there will be a 15-20 mins wait. They then gave us a buzzer.   The bingsoo was huge! For the price of $15 I think it was really worth it. You get the shaved ice in an actual melon. The melon was super sweet and ripe.   Unfortunately the shaved ice melted super quickly. Maybe after 5 mins, we were already spooning water."}
{"text":"First time eating at Soul Cafe.  I had the lobster ravioli and a wedge salad.  Both were delicious.  Service was really good.  I enjoyed the band but very loud for a restaurant.  I would definitely go back next time I'm in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Great evening of food and wine. I had the mexaloaf and wife had the duck and sausage cassoulet  Connor and rest of staff at bat were great."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch on a saturday and It was very quiet there. Music playing was really bad. Type of music that makes you want to bang your head against a wall instead of listen to it. The restaurant itself looks nice and our waitress was very nice.   Food was not good. Margharita pizza was floppy and wet and the dough was a roll out Pillsbury pizza dough. Chicken burger was okay was just lacking flavor. The cold grilled chicken sandwich was just alright the bread was quite floppy and came with ruffle brand chips. Everything was just so-so it seemed like they use poor quality ingredients. Pretty disappointing considering the reviews. Weird dj showed up too, adding to the bad music."}
{"text":"Hate to be a Nancy, but my experience was not the best.  Went Saturday for Brunch.  Waited 10 minutes before water or coffee were offered or anyone came over to greet us.  A table that was seated behind us was waited on before our drink order was taken.  When our waitress took our order I asked for vegan options, which she stated I could choose from the sides menu.  No offer to check with the kitchen or see what could be made.  Fine, I ordered some sides and my partner ordered a burrito.  When our food came mine was wrong and the burrito was nowhere to be found, just a pile of eggs on the plate. Lol like what? Our waitress was clearly annoyed when we asked for our food to be fixed.  She didn't come around enough for me to order an alcoholic beverage, which I would have.  It was just very poor service from the beginning.  There are so many places to go for brunch, I honestly would never go back or take anyone there."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time this afternoon. I had a tasty tuna sandwich and my boyfriend had the burger that he really enjoyed as well. Our server Juan was very friendly and attentive. We will be back to try out the breakfast selection!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast and wonderful staff! We came fifteen minutes late for breakfast and Erik happily accommodated us.. food was delicious! Highly recommend the lemon ricotta waffles and I'm not a waffle person.. they were amazing:)"}
{"text":"First of all, the name does not represent the restaurant well.  The decor and menu are very southwest.  The name is not.  The place is nice looking enough.  The menu is interesting, altho very pricey for this kind of neighborhood spot.  Average entrees $21-$25.  We went for the Wednesday night all you can eat fried chicken special.  The chicken was quite good, as were the mashed potatoes, but I did not like the corn at all.  But that is just my personal taste.  The price is excellent at $9.99, however, they nickel and dime you into paying extra for a biscuit or extra sides.  The only all you can eat item is the chicken itself.  Which I guess is okay, since that's the most expensive part of the meal.  The worst part tho was the service, hence the 2 stars.  Our waitress Emily was the most unfriendly waitress ever.  She never smiled or made us feel welcome.  She was never to be found, which was actually good in this case, since we didn't want to see her.  She was snarky and made us feel uncomfortable. She basically ruined our evening and would prevent us from going back there a second time."}
{"text":"We had our Christmas Party at Soul Café last night and it was truly amazing.  From the food to the service everything was perfect.  The music was great and that just added to the whole ambiance.  Sean our server was excellent.  We live in the area and frequent this restaurant at least twice a week. Everyone from the owners, chef and servers are top notch.  Everyone at the office said it was the best party we have had.  Thank you to everyone at Soul Café."}
{"text":"Went to this eatery for breakfast. Delicious food. Excellent service. Great value. Will definitely be back. Thank you for an enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"Without a doubt they have one of the best breakfasts being served in Scottsdale! I love this place. The food is always great and the people there are always friendly. I would highly recommend this as one of my favorites!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to take the time to review this place as I really enjoyed it and the fact that I used to Yelp to find it. It was my first time at this restaurant as I was visiting Scottsdale for the weekend, from Santa Barbara, CA. My friend and I stopped in on a Saturday morning for breakfast. We sat outside and enjoyed a mimosa while our service was prompt and courteous. There weren't many people there and our food came out quickly.  I ordered the lemon ricotta pancakes and subbed scrambled eggs for the bacon/sausage it came with. The eggs were perfectly moist and delicious, unlike some places I've been where dry, over-scrambled, tasteless eggs are the norm. The pancakes were amazing! I loved the creamy dollops of ricotta cheese and lemon curd throughout. The only thing I would suggest is to make them a little smaller. It comes with 2 plate fitting pancakes. They could probably do 3 smallish ones and it be enough food; they are definitely filling. I just felt bad because I couldn't eat them all and it seemed like a waste to throw the rest away. Aside from that, bravo! If I ever venture back to Scottsdale, I'll happily visit here again!"}
{"text":"My husband and I go for breakfast every weekend and we have never been disappointed.  The food is consistently fantastic and the service is excellent.  The blueberry and bacon pancakes are fabulous.  My favorite is their french toast.  Wow!!!!! They use cinnamon bread that is to die for.  Yummy!!!!  All of their food is fresh and they use the best ingredients.  Their patio is dog friendly and they are so wonderful to our dog, Bentley."}
{"text":"This cafe seems to have a large selection of hot drinks, cold drinks and desserts. We ordered one rose tea, one chrysanthemum tea, one americano and a piece of tiramisu cake. They were quite pricey because the bill came to $20. They ask you to make your order, pick up your order then return your tray back to their counter yet they will ask for a minimum tip of 13%."}
{"text":"Went for breakfast this past Tuesday ... it was just \"fair\".  We were seated in a booth near the bar.  The Summer Olympics were on their TV over the bar and in competition with the loud rap (?) music.  We got up from that booth and went to the back of the room to get away from the \"noise\".  There were only two other tables with patrons.  We ordered our food and waited what seemed a lengthy period of time for breakfast.  For whatever reason, this restaurant doesn't seem to be able to serve HOT food???? The food is tasty enough .... but it's luke warm at best.  We've eaten here several times and I don't ever remember having had a HOT cup of coffee.  This was at least our tenth time in and we are giving up.  It was our hope that this place would succeed as there are so few good breakfast places available in the area.  Heart & Soul (on Carefree Hwy) owned by the same person has similiar problems ... not sure if the stove/ovens don't work or the food is left out waiting too long to be delivered to tables.  At any rate, it's been difficult getting good, HOT food served to us.  Management needs to get their act together ... although the food is \"tasty\" .... if not served hot ... or if it takes an overly long period of time to receive ... then your customers will move on elsewhere.  We noticed the wait staff has a tendency to stand around when business is slow ... they should be \"cleaning\" ... i.e., wipe the bathroom mirrors a couple times throughout the day, replace the tablecloth at the Heart & Soul location in the car booth instead of having people eat off the same cloth as the people before them.  Have the wait staff sweep up the crumbs/food from the floors when it's not busy.  As we were at Soul in the morning hours, I'd suggest to their staff that the bathrooms be checked before opening and on an hourly basis.  It would have been nice to have been able to use a sanitary paper on the toilet seat ... but the dispenser was empty.  I'm sure there hadn't been that many female customers in that day to have used them all.    This establishment's pricing warrants more for our money.  We eat out often and these two places don't meaure up.   The music/TV should be lowered so it's not so annoying.  People like to converse when they're eating and at times it's been almost impossible to hear ourselves think.  Maybe by losing us as customers ... you'll take some of our comments and improve the quality and service of your business before you lose all your customers."}
{"text":"I have a love hate relationship with Soul Cafe. The food, when you finally get it, is excellent. My wife and I love everything we've ever ordered from here. The servers are all very nice and attentive.  So please go to this restaurant as you won't regret it from a culinary point of view. Why no 5 stars, you ask?  Because of the delay in getting your food from the kitchen. And nothing more than multiple apologies and coffee refills with no adjustment to the bill. Two weeks ago my wife and I went for dinner. 30 minutes after ordering we were informed that of all coincidences another waiter put in the exact same order from another 2 top, which confused the kitchen and cancelled our order. Apology, apology....and 30 minutes later we get our food. We return last Sunday for brunch. 30 minutes after ordering we are informed that the computers went down, they lost 6 orders, and alas, our order was one of the lost orders. Apology, apology.... and 30 minutes later we finally get our food.  When I finally get the food, I had bacon instead of sausage. I informed the server who started to grab the entire plate. I quickly told him how long I waited and if he wanted the bacon he could take it, but by no means was he taking the rest of my food. I wonder what creative explanation we will get the next time? I just don't understand what's going on with the kitchen, but we are going to take a break from Soul Cafe for awhile to give them a chance to work things out. Or at least come up with more excuses for late food."}
{"text":"Had another fabulous brunch at Soul Cafe on Mother's Day this year (second year in a row).  The mimosas are wonderful and the Ham, asparagus and Brie omelette delicious!  Then, I had some of my husband's Lemon Ricotta pancake...the best ever!   And the service was amazingly good with a truly packed house.  I guess everyone agrees it's the place to go!"}
{"text":"Disappointment 3 times out of 3 - third time was not the charm.  Inconsistent quality of dishes, some were okay and some were terrible/inedible, mediocre service  and I really don't see what the fuss is about.  Nice location and love the outdoor spot, but with so many excellent choices in the area, I won't be trying again until new management or my amnesia sets in."}
{"text":"Breakfast is to die for! Great people! Owner is so nice and our bartender Shea is awesome! It's our Sunday spot!"}
{"text":"I came here for the first time. It's sort hidden in the back corner of a plaza north of finch on yonge street. My friend took me here as she knows some of the people that work in the cafe. First of all, it was a nicely decorated place and it reminded me somewhat of cafes in Seoul. You order up front and pay right away. When your order is ready, they call it out and you get up to pick it up. There are several tables so it's enough seating for a decent crowd. I don't remember if there was ventilation, but it wasn't overly hot or cold. There were a few bugs here and there from people opening the door and the humid weather. It bothered me only when they flew near me. As for the food, we ordered 2 small bingsu; one was the oreo and the other the injeolmi. Personally, I like the injeolmi as oreo is not much to my taste. I also can't really eat ice-cream so I avoided that one. I love the injeolmi powder. It's has a subtle sweet and nutty taste to it. The deok was nice and chewy and well-coated with the powder. I do wish they had drowned it even further with the powder, and given a few more pieces of the rice cake. It's pretty close to what you get in Korea, but obviously a tad less. The price was alright as it came to less than $20 for both. We also ordered drinks and they were good too. They have a pretty good selection of drinks and bingsu, so I would come back again when I'm having another craving."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant last week with my girlfriend and her roommate. First off, this place really is \"Wooohoooo! As good as it gets!\" I was enthralled to see that type of ambience that this area/restaurant offered. Pinnacle Peak is a gorgeous area with breathtaking desert scenery. Soul Café takes the word \"café\" to a whole new level. I had no idea that it would be that nice but it was pleasantly taken aback. I went here for dinner and I guess it just opened up for that time of night. It is usually a breakfast and lunch time place. But still, the dinner was phenomenal! I had the steak and fries! Great portions and reasonably priced for a place that exquisite is something to be found there. No more leaving still hungry because you got an expensive steak that took you spread five bites over the entire dinner! The live music~the best part of the evening~ was performed by a regular group called \"WHAT4.\" I believe they play during the day as well but their music set the mood singlehandedly. They literally can play ANYTHING. I found myself liking songs they performed better than the ones on the radio, etc!! Some songs I solely liked because they performed. The musicians were very friendly and was a great duo!! Sure they has lots of success! Definitely something to see if you haven't already! They were not distracting and played any request you wanted. Songs from The Beatles, Fleetwood Mac, to current hot songs. They are very talented indeed! Again, at 13/10 rating for me!"}
{"text":"Careful...the menu online is not the same as in the restaurant. I wanted the \"Light\" options and a few other things on the online menu but when time to order at the table nothing was available. I only came to try this place for certain items listed online."}
{"text":"This was the perfect place for brunch! Eric was our sever and was awesome. Delicious food!"}
{"text":"This place is awful...and sooo Scottsdale. Service is slow and uneven, prices are exorbitant, and the food is average at best.   Here's why: Starting with the specials menu, the chef is so full of herself that there is a warning at the bottom of the specials menu that you better try it her way or risk your food taking forever. Well, your food is going to take forever anyway so why not let them know how YOU want it. Whatever happened to \"the customer is always right\"?  Now on to the server who asked me if I wanted more water when my glass was empty and we hadn't even received our food yet. Really?  Weird food combinations: The specials menu listed a Quinoa, Mint, Strawberry omelette. Mint and eggs...I should have known better. Instead of a little mint on top of the eggs it mixed in and overbearing. Best of all there was no Quinoa to be found in the omelette.  It's 100 degrees outside? Unless you're going to sit on the patio you better bring a winter parka! They keep the AC set at meat locker temperature so you freeze your a** off. Plus, if your food was hot when it was served it won't be two minutes later.  Add to that the prices are, well ridiculous. Two breakfast entrees and one iced tea for $30 bucks plus tip, for slow service, cold food. weird combinations and a Prima Dona chef. No, Thank, You. We will not be back."}
{"text":"Very disappointed last night.  Have been there before a few times and 4 or 5 stars with great food and music.  Yesterday they seated us promptly.  Tablecloth was dirty so the hostess took it but never brought another.  No big deal since the table itself was clean.  Promptly brought us water then nothing.   Totally ignored after the water.  Sat there for 15 minutes, right next to the music act (outside seating, beautiful evening), and it was like we were in a different dimension, invisible to the help.  Got up and left and on our way out a guy who looked like a manager and the hostess just smiled politely and were clueless.  I assume they were understaffed but if that is the case someone should have at least told us rather than letting us sit being ignored. Too many great PHX restaurants so won't go back. By the way, I am not a complainer and have never left a 1 star review (or 2 or 3 star for that matter)."}
{"text":"Combine the great weekly specials with quality, fresh food, enjoyable entertainment, great service and reasonable prices and this will easily become a favorite place to eat in north Scottsdale.  The Wednesday special is a must if you love fried chicken and homemade mashed potatoes.  Their breakfasts are home cooking at its best.  Can't miss with this restaurant.  It is such a friendly, neighborhood gem."}
{"text":"Great service and food! Big serving sizes for sure!! Ambiance is cute, has a southwestern theme."}
{"text":"food was great! eric our server was great and social, made our experience a great time!!"}
{"text":"This place offers great breakfast and dinner options.  It is comfortably casual.  The food is very innovative while still being approachable.  Their breakfast is fantastic and rife with gluten free options.  The service is friendly.  I'm a regular."}
{"text":"We love this place!  Great food and drinks.  The bloody Mary's are super good, but the star of the show is.....  The Crazy Cowboy!  Country fried steak with green chili verde pork.  Ridiculous!!!  I have a suggestion for the owner \" Oh Sheila\". The patio. Needs big pots with flowers, misters, and the clear over head lights at night to make it a go to patio.  It needs atmosphere!  Your inside looks great.  Let's bring that outside for those of us patio seekers...  Nice job on the food..."}
{"text":"Lived in the area for 2 1/2 years and never been to the Soul Cafe.  That will all change now.  Had brunch yesterday and it was excellent.  Food was outstanding and the service was even better.  Seemed very busy and a lot of energy.  Bar was packed at 9:00 A.M. on a Sunday morning! We will be back!!"}
{"text":"I feel like I should get a free t-shirt and my photo on the wall, after finishing that!   -Bretters  Well, Sunny did say \"no naked carbs\"... so I think the bacon and blue pancakes meets that requirement.  Once I heard the tale of such a pancake, I knew I had to make it mine, being a blueberry fan from way back.   Thinking the portion size would have been smaller, I also augmented my order with a side of the jalapeño infused bacon.  What a sheer delight that was, not too overpowering... like baby bear's porridge, it was \"just right\".  If you like the bloody, then try theirs, as they take that jalapeño bacon grease and muddle their vodka in it... for a taste like no other.  I was so impressed with the pancakes, and how much they served you.  No wonder you get a full bottle of syrup on the table... you just might need it, there captain.  They also have a lemon ricotta pancake, which I'd try next weekend if the place wasn't so far away... and if I wasn't putting on weight like that one time I used those misprinted Deal A Meal cards"}
{"text":"OMG!!! I wish I could pick this place up and take it back home to Chicago! Everything we had was delicious - lemon ricotta pancakes, blueberry-bacon pancakes, farmers omelette and heavenly hash!!! The soulmosa and coffeetini was delicious too!!! The service was OUTSTANDING!! We had the best waiter - Eric - you can tell that he loves his job and passionate about what he does and the Soul Cafe!! Will definitely be back next time I'm in Scottsdale!!"}
{"text":"So friendly, good food, great atmosphere. Moving to the area and looking for \"our place\" this is definitely on the list of places to frequent. Love it. Thanks Eric for the great service, outgoing personality and welcoming spirit!"}
{"text":"Ordered a small size of Coffee Shaved Ice for $6.99. It was very good although it was quite overly sweet for me due to the amount of the espresso sauce added on top. The coffee ice cream is also so good that I don't really like coffee flavor things but I still enjoyed it, probably because the coffee flavor was not that strong in the bingsoo. Because it was so sweet that a small size was enough for me and my friend. Another thing is that chewing mochi is a part of the toppings but there was exactly 2 pieces of mochi in my bingsoo unfortunately, a little disappointment here. Perhaps I will order the injeonmi one next time in order to get more of that chewing mochi.    Service is efficient as I got my order within 5 minutes waiting. The cashier was very friendly and smiling all the time. It was kinda self-serve thing as you pay and pick up your order whenever the bell they gave you rings.   Overall, I will definitely come back to try other flavors and highly recommend it."}
{"text":"I went to Soul Cafe on a weeknight  to catch up with a friend over a wee bit of tea and dessert. I liked the idea of the sofas. It gave the place a homey and comfortable feel but that's pretty much all the positive things I can say about this place.   I had a Higgins & Burke Tea and a slice of green tea cake. At  $1.69, I thought the price of the tea was way too steep (pun intended). The green tea cake was absolutely horrible. It was so old, it tasted like fridge!     Things I liked:  - The casual \"Central Perk\" ambiance  Things I hated:   - Old cake  - Only accept cash"}
{"text":"This is the only place that I can go...where I can reconnect with living in general...I'll tell you why...this is owned by people who can cook and who care about feeding you the very best they can. Sheila is a goddess in the kitchen and I have rearely seen a more caring staff than her own....so blasphemy when I read the nasty reviews which truly don't belong here...  There are many places that you can go to for breakfast. Trust me that as a foodie, this is the very best one you can go to...Bacon Blueberry pancakes...who would have thought of such as naughty yet delicious combination ???  the best part is it doesn't stop there...Soul Cafe is open for lunch and dinner to.  I keep updating my review yes...because I truly believe in this restaurant not only as a place to restore yourself, but to reconnect with yourself thru the deliciousness of its food.  And no, I am not a shareholder, investor, family member. I am just a foodie, making my way thru the Soul Cafe menu and I am making great headways although I am stubbornly stuck on some favourites like the fitness frittata (even better with extra vegetables and a side of green chili)...Shame on me, I often get the fitness frittata with a single bacon blueberry pancake...just oh hum...to mess up my diet just a little but it's well worth it to me.  Give this place a chance will you...you will be glad you did. This is one of the most creative menus I have seen in years in a casual cafe and Chef Sheila keeps reinventing herself daily, never too happy to sit on her laurels..."}
{"text":"Always great food. Duck breast is one of my favorite meals ever...extremely creative and the presentation is beautiful. Also adore the scallops."}
{"text":"My favourite spot for Korean snacks.   Bingsoo is my fav. Love the fact that there grape fruit drink is made with real grape fruits along with the chunks of grape fruits inside! (Must try for summer, so refreshing) The honey dew drink is the artificial honey dew, but it's basically a melona popsicle made into a slush, so yummy! And their white grape drink again is made with really blended down grapes.   So yummy"}
{"text":"My lemon ricotta and apple cinnamon pancakes were AMAZING, but the service was horrible.  Very very slow, and maybe the waitress was not experienced enough to figure out what I need before I asked for it.  For example, she sat my group which was a table of 3, and only had one menu for about 5 minutes before she brought out another one.  Also only had two sets of utensils before I asked for another setting.  5 minutes after she delivered my pancakes, I had to ask for syrup.  If the service was better, I would have rated this restaurant with a 4.  Maybe next time."}
{"text":"Amazing brunch had the crazy cowboy and the jalapeño infused bacon bloody mary  everything completely on point"}
{"text":"Amazing breakfast lemon ricotta pancakes are delicious! Chili pork and Chipotle beef also amazing. So glad we stopped in and thank you Eric for excellent service too!!"}
{"text":"I cannot read Korean but I know what is an Excellent food photo!  When I saw that Korean Shave Iced Photo (Patbingsu), I know I want that! I point and I scream and said I want that!  Patbingsu ($4.99) is just so perfect for any hot summer day. Fresh fruit, Red bean, Condensed Sweet Milk, Rice Cake, Ice Cream and of course some Shaved Iced!  Soul Cafe is quiet and peaceful. Not as fancy as a dating spot but great to have some quiet time and enjoy a coffee and some sweet.  I will definitely be back for some more Patbingsu. Happy Face!"}
{"text":"My wife, niece and I were craving pancakes today and so we headed out to Soul Cafe since they have the best ones in the area. We got there, sat down and asked for breakfast menus, only to be told that they aren't serving breakfast at this time -- oh no! Eric, one of the waiters, must've seen the look of sadness in our faces and felt pity on us because he made the pancakes happen! BOOM! That is awesome customer service!! The owner even personally came out to let us know that she doesn't mind making the pancakes and we were all giddy with excitement. I had a Bloody Mary (really good) while we waited for our food. A few minutes later and we were served with glorious yumminess that \"hit the spot\". If you haven't had their pancakes you need to try them. Not only are they delicious, but they're HUGE! I personally love the bacon+blueberry flavor - yes, it sounds odd, but trust me, you'll love them. Kudos to the staff - Eric and Alanna in particular for making our day and to the owner for being so flexible. We will definitely be back many more times and will recommend to everyone!!"}
{"text":"SInce my previous review we have returned many times. We went for dinner and had a fantastic meal. The reason there is no web site is because the chef changes the menu frequently. I get it.  I also finally tried the lunch menu and there are a bunch of good things to try. The cheese steak. The pastrami. The tuna. The salmon sandwich was UNBELIEVABLE. (it doesn't really need the bacon) There isn't anything I would not try again. With some lunch meals you get a cookie. (sometimes you have to ask) It is divine. It is chocolate chip, white chocolate chip and butterscotch chips all mixed in a dough. I'm telling you- this is a place to try.   Regarding the picture below about your preferences taking the kitchen more time, you need to know that the chef does it all. She is the owner and chef. She personally makes sure everything goes out of the kitchen right. Also know that this is a new place and they are still working out service kinks."}
{"text":"The experience truly depends on the service you get. The hostess was nice and friendly upon our arrival, engaging us a special we were being seated. This made us think this would be a great bring. Then came our server who had an attitude like he could not be bothered. I asked for cheese on my scrambled eggs and he wrote it down wrong, not making eye contact or really acknowledging that I was speaking. I asked him if he got it and then he wrote it down correctly. There was a fly that plagued us from the time we sat down and his response to seeing it was \"Sorry about that fly\" and walking away without any attempt to do anything about it. We also noticed a dead flies on the windowsill next to our booth that no one bothered to clean up. That fly continued to plague us to the point that we decided to leave rather than chatting and catching up. We were never checked on, simply offered offered boxes and the check after a while. I'd like to go back and see if there is a better experience with a different server and service. I noticed one guy who was singly very friendly and personable. Like my friend said, \"If you don't like people, don't be a server and spread your bad attitude.\""}
{"text":"Great Food!! Great Bar!! ... This place is very consistent when it comes to the quality of there food and customer service. We usually sit at the bar because they have a couple TV's and Connor behind the bar is the man... He's always fast and knows everything about the meal your thinking about ordering. Go for the Arizona Medallions... SWEET!! Have a good selection of beers but a great selection of wine. Get the coconut shrimp first... YUM!!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here 4 times now; once for breakfast, twice for lunch and once for dinner.   Each meal has been very good and I have never been disappointed.   The wait staff has always been very friendly and courteous and the food is always served hot and delicious.  Serving size is appropriate ... not too little and not too much.  I would certainly recommend Soul Cafe to anyone looking for a great meal in the North Scottsdale area!"}
{"text":"I might dare to say this is the best shaved ice I had in Toronto!    I normally have the Chinese/Taiwanese variety uptown or in foodfests and it's quite different from this Korean version (patbingsu). Small is a good size for 2!  Flavour: Ordered the classic Korean injeolmi flavour (small ~$7), which has these soft chewy bits of tteok (rice cakes/mochi), almonds and dusted with roasted dried soybean powder. The flavour is unique, it's not the usual flavour of fruits, red bean or matcha. It's light, not too decadent or sweet, which makes it so good. I almost chose the other flavours instead because it came with ice cream. But it's not necessary, it hits the spot even without the heavy cream.   Texture: Fluffy snow crystals as opposed to sheets of ice crystals in the Chinese variety I usually have. Maybe it's just me but the crystals here seem to melt less quickly (perhaps we finished it so quickly!). The crystals have a slightly sweetened milk flavour. I don't like how in other places they drizzle too much condensed milk/syrup on an already sweet base or icy sugary water. This one is just right. But I'll definitely come back to try the other flavours.   I also ordered the lemon tea for ~$4, kinda pricey for some hot water, honey/sweetener/syrup. It was good though, packed with lemony flavour and the slight bitter zest of the peel. But this is lemon water... WHERE IS THE TEA???? Please confirm in the picture. I will over look this because of the generous amount of thinly cut lemon slices, which does add to the labour. But can you even call this tea in the menu?"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the first visit here.  Food was really good, Bloody Marys good, but they didn't offer a chaser.... wtf?  Get real!!"}
{"text":"Great food. Salmon Orange salad is fantastic. Just have 4 stars because service is slow."}
{"text":"First time there and it was a pleasure. Delicious food, helpful and friendly people. Coconut shrimp was the best we ever had likewise the fried chicken. Desert was also excellent. We'll be back soon"}
{"text":"The Soul Cafe has a variety of very unique menu selections, including bacon pancakes.  I for one have never had them but, they do sound interesting.  I usually just get pancakes; either the apple or the blueberry.  The pancakes are huge and delicious!  However, I've also had some of their omelets, which are also extremely delicious. Ive been coming here for a few weeks now and have only great things to say about them.  I highly recommend the Soul Care to anyone who likes breakfast food!"}
{"text":"Cute little dessert cafe. It's in a quiet part of Yonge Sheppard. They have a variety of cold desserts, mostly shaved ice.  The Green Tea and Red Bean shaved iced desserts are both really good."}
{"text":"We got the injulmee bingsoo, which was alright. I liked the squishy cube things in it, but there was waaaay too much shaved ice, which sort of overwhelmed the rest of the dish. Maybe that's just how it's supposed to taste though and I'm just uncultured. The place was pretty busy so they must be doing something right! I could not get their wifi to work though."}
{"text":"I had an americano and their tiramisu cake here. The americano was pretty standard and pricier than normal. I wasn't that impressed.The tiramisu cake was pretty good though. It was nice and fluffy. Still, the portions were kind of small for the price. Also, there's a buzzer system to pick up your order which is convenient. The order took oddly long for 2 teas, an americano and a slice of cake. The inside modern although there's not a lot of seating. This place is good but not worth the prices they charge and the small portions."}
{"text":"Outstanding Food and Service.  The short ribs ravioli was magnificent as was the lobster rigatoni. Fantastic desserts as well.  Key Lime and blueberry pies. A bit pricey, but a great experience yet again."}
{"text":"I came in and had lunch today. I am sorry that I missed the brunch time. Several of my friends have raved about this place for breakfast. I had the special; fish, shoe string french fries and slaw. It was okay. The service was okay. This is a spacious restaurant with plenty of indoor and outdoor seating options and an extensive menu. It is in a prime location with plenty of parking."}
{"text":"I had a really poor experience at this restaurant. We came in at 3:45 on a Saturday & we were told by the hostess pizza & salads were the only thing they were serving. When our waitress came to help us we inquired about this statement. She said pizza, burgers & salads were the only things being served. What kind of restaurant tells customers they are restricted to only 3 options of their vast amount of choices on the menu?   I ordered a cheddar burger. My girlfriend got the strawberry salad. 40 minutes later, (yes 40 minutes for a burger and a salad while the restaurant was empty) we got our food. I ordered the burger medium but I received it very very well done. Burnt.   Not impressed. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"The ambiance was fairly comfortable and it was a very clean environment. I got the patbingsu and the proportion was pretty big for the price that I paid."}
{"text":"I came here for Sunday breakfast when my family was in town and everything was great!   I ordered the fitness burrito and it came with a pretty good spinach tortilla wrap. I also had a side of the famous lemon ricotta pancake and it was amazing! Definitely give that a try if this is your first time here.   What was even better than the food was the wonderful service! Our waiter was very friendly and on top of everything.   Can't wait to come back and try something else on the menu!"}
{"text":"Great menu. Expansive wine menu.  The fried green tomatoes are excellent and worth the wait   The key lime pie is absolutely to die for.  Best Key lime pie I've ever had and I'm a huge fan."}
{"text":"My friend and I had a yummy lunch here yesterday coupled with fun service from Eric.  I know Soul Cafe is all about breakfast-but we had lunch.  My gf had the pastrami sammie which she loved.  I noshed on the Grilled Chicken Burger-and while it might sound healthy and run of the mill-it was actually scrumptious-with cheese, bacon and avocado and a great toasted bun.  Do lunch-you will be happy!"}
{"text":"I've only ever been to Soul Cafe for breakfast and have NEVER been disappointed. I typically order the chilaquiles. PHENOMENAL. The green chili with the pork sauce is on point. Lemon ricotta pancakes? AMAZING. The bacon jalapeño Bloody Mary is about the most delicious thing I've ever tried. They offer gluten free option on their food as well, but don't allow substitutions on their menu items, which could be an issue for some people; certainly not me.  Ambiance is great. Usually a wait but not for more than about ten minutes.  All around awesome joint! Definitely one of my favorites."}
{"text":"My favorite Breakfast place in Scottsdale!..Met the Chef and owner very nice person, and so as the people working here. Great atmosphere and great food!.."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! Have been for both lunch and breakfast and both were amazing! I can't wait to go for dinner! Rumor has it their fried chicken is incredible...Can't wait to try it! I love that the food is common comfort food, but done in a fun and refreshing way! The servers here are so friendly! Have not had a bad experience at all!"}
{"text":"I love this breakfast place! Coming back for many years, it hasn't changed a bit.. I ordered the\" to good to be true breakfast with pancakes and bacon, and my husband had Crazy bescuit and gravy. Excellent food and fantastic atmosphere."}
{"text":"I got the mango shaved ice. The mango I think are frozen because they did not taste like fresh mango. I took off the mangos from the shaved ice and just mixed the mango ice cream. It was not worth the money since the taste was disappointing."}
{"text":"If there was a sixth star to give this resteraunt we would! My girlfriend and I ate breakfast here this Saturday. Everything from the atmosphere to the food and the great service was OUTSTANDING!! Starting with Blood Mary that is Jalepeno bacon infused of course. Wow!! Then I had the chicken enchiladas with eggs a side of jalapeño bacon and OH MY GOD the Lemon Ricotta pancake!! This IS by far the BEST PANCAKE EVER!!! Considering my old favorite was the Protein pancake at U.S. egg. This one is hands down the BEST!! IT DOESN'T NEED SYRUP it's soooooo good. We'll be back next Saturday for sure!!!! Oh..  and Jessie was a great server too. Must have her section please.  Christopher Wilson"}
{"text":"Great for dinner or breakfast with excellent service. Fir dinner I recommend mango salmon on corn cake which is subtle and delicious.  Breakfast: I see why they are known for their lemon ricotta pancakes! At first glance they look just like a large pancake but the pockets of Leon ricotta are delightful. The omelets have all fresh ingredients but u feel the best omelet in town belongs to the way butters prepares theirs."}
{"text":"We've eaten here Many times for Breakfast, Lunch & Dinner. Service is always good, and the food is usually Great; but Not so much today. It's about a 20 minute drive & I really had my heart set on a Hot Pastrami sandwich (which I've gotten here before) and today it was just so-so .... It took forever to get our lunches, only 3 tables of customers at the time. Maybe it was because they were just starting the lunch menu, as breakfast hours just ended. Prices go up & portions go down, must be due to change in the minimum wage. For $12 and to have hardly any pastrami on the top & bottom, just lots of coleslaw in between, plus the potato salad usually has a lot of celery & red onion, but not in the scoop that I got Just Disappointed. I asked the server if she thought my pastrami looked light, she shrugged her shoulders. The lack of consistency ticks me off. \"I guarantee Chef Shelia didn't make my sandwich\" is what I told our server. Anyway, today was just not worth the drive nor the money. Would have quietly mentioned this experience to a manager on our way out, but didn't see John or Maureen, so I decided to just put it here! Not sure if we'll return any time soon."}
{"text":"We ate lunch at Soul Cafe yesterday.  \"We\" being my mother, a lady we just hired to help me care for children post surgery, and our 6-month-old baby.  We were seated promptly, but we sat there for about 10-15 minutes without anyone even coming to our table to great us, take our drink orders, etc.  I got up to ask the hostess if there was some confusion as to which server was assigned to our table or some other difficulty.  Immediately, a server came over, promptly took our entire order, and came back with our drinks.    Our food came out incredible quickly, and it was the best lean pastrami sandwich I've probably eaten in my life.  However, we felt forgotten again as it took entirely too long to receive the bill once we had finished our lunch.  Solid food!  Service could stand some improvement. Terrific unique atmosphere including the light fixtures.  (I've included a photograph)."}
{"text":"The Soul Cafe was not what I expected. The name alone implied there would be Soul food but that's not the case, at all. I wasn't at all impressed with the taste of the food. I had the Fit chicken wrap and tri colored potatoes and fruit. The wrap was not my favorite; not very flavorful. My companions pancakes were tasty though. The service was pretty good. Nothing to write home about but the staff was friendly and attentive as they should have been. What surprised me most was the cost - $51 + tip would have been better spent for a nice dinner. If you're price conscious like we are, be careful when ordering.  My tri-colored potatoes were extra. The sausage my companion ordered with the pancakes was extra and the very small glass of mimosa was a whopping $8! I did like the look of the place. I felt it was interesting and bright."}
{"text":"Very happy to have found this place after realizing my beloved Cups closed down at the Yonge St location (why!!!!).  This place was quite a surprise - nicely tucked away from the main street, they serve pretty much the same flavours of bingsu as Cups but at a fraction of the cost. For the same price you'd pay for a small at Cups, you get the large bowl. And well, for the price of a large at Cups, you get a super gigantic bowl here.  Tons of great flavours like injeolmi (mochi bits!!) but I think next time I'll try the honeydew. I kept glancing at other tables that had bingsu inside half a giant honeydew!   This place has tons of seats as well so you can come with a date or a large group of friends! However, later in the night, it was quite packed and loud inside and my friends and I basically had to yell at each other to continue our conversation. Totally acceptable though, for the excellent valued bingsu you are getting!  Other than bingsu you can get tons of drinks, ice cream, waffles, and crepes! This place has a much larger selection of menu items than Cups too!"}
{"text":"Had guest in town, and decided to have Brunch at Soul Cafe.  We had dined here approximately 2 years ago, just forgot about this restaurant.  I am glad we decided to come back. We definitely were not disappointed.  Service was excellent.  Had the applicious pancakes, chilaquiles, and the classic breakfast.  All I can say is the food is very good.   Will definitely need to come back and try their dinner."}
{"text":"The Bloody Mary, jalapeño bacon, Crazy Cowboy and especially the service were all amazing.  Can't wait to come back"}
{"text":"This is my go to spot for pancakes. Lemon Ricotta and blueberry pancakes are my favorite but you can't go wrong with any of them. The portion size is huge! Enough to feed two people easily. I always take half home for next day. Their breakfast burritos are delicious too. Ample seating inside and outside (dog friendly) with friendly and fast service."}
{"text":"First visit review: 5 stars The outward appearance isn't anything special but indoors was nice. We came for Sunday brunch which was amazing. The staff was very welcoming and warm. Parking was super easy. We tried the lemon ricotta pancakes and raspberry granola pancakes which were the best pancakes I've ever had. The Tres Locos special was so unique and flavorful...unlike anything I've had before. The roasted potatoes were a welcome change from hash browns and done very well. We are definitely coming back to try the rest of their menu!  Second visit review: 4 stars Came on a Saturday for breakfast. Tried some different pancakes this time and was not as impressed. Wish I had stuck with the lemon ricotta pancake or raspberry granola that I had the last time. The coffee was okay, but not great. The staff was very nice both times. Nice family atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great food, just a little spendy. I had the Mediterranean omlette. No complaints, absolutely great. Good service too... Shawn even brought my buddy a manly glass for his Mimosa (lol). Great experience over all, but our tab came to $125 for brunch and a few cocktails for 3."}
{"text":"Lexi was an amazing server and our dinner was fantastic! My daughter had the kids chicken and fries- it was a huge portion and it was homemade! So good! I had the BLT salad (with balsamic vinaigrette)... Yum!!! I had key lime pie - big, but so yummy... I took the other half to-go! And... The green iced tea was DELICIOUS! This place is not the same owner as the Heart & Soul Cafe -- the Soul Cafe is FAR SUPERIOR in every way to Heart & Soul. Highly recommended!! We can't wait to come back for breakfast!!"}
{"text":"Went to Soul Cafe today for the first time with co-workers and we all loved it! I had the grilled vegetable salad w/chicken in a light balsamic dressing. It was huge and delicious. The waitress recommended I get the chicken warm rather than cooled since it is a warm salad which was perfect with large pieces of asparagus, zucchini, peppers, onion and eggplant with a mix of greens. The others had the caprese salad sandwich, hamburger and margarita pizza all were large portions and looked great and they loved it. Comfortable booths and nice atmosphere and friendly efficient staff. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"In Scottsdale this week and got to experience Soul Cafe. Although not what I expected from the name and location, this \"cafe\" was a very pleasant surprise. We made dinner reservations, but I'm not sure that reservations are needed. The tables were covered with cloth tablecloths and mini centerpieces. The soft music and decor resulted in a casually elegant ambience. We were the first customers for the dinner crowd, so we got a lot of personal and pleasant attention from the Manager -- which was nice for visitors! The Addictive Strawberry Salad was fresh and tasty. While there was a varied menu (seafood, land and pasta), we ordered the Buttermilk Fried Chicken and although it needed to be seasoned more, it was a large sized portion, well cooked, plump and juicy. The accompanying vegetables were flavorful. Drinks were good - I recommend the Margarita del Sol. This review would not be complete if I didn't mention the blueberry pie a la mode that my husband went crazy over. If you are ever in Scottsdale, I would recommend a trip to this restaurant; they're open for breakfast, lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"Love the food, love the food servers & bartenders, love the funky music...been here a number of times at request of different friends and never been sorry.  Came with the dogs for breakfast outside on the patio...fabulous.  Pancakes that even top my husband's and that says alot.  Friday night is fish night so reservations are a must.  They close early but it's turning out to be one of our \"go-tos.\""}
{"text":"Soul cafe?! Oh god what can I say. Went with my husband for a nice brunch. My god was I disappointed. My scrambled eggs literally had what looked like a pubic hair. GROSS!!  I explained that to Sheila the owner and she was very rude about it. She explained that it was my own hair and called me a bitch under her breath. So unprofessional!   I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Went for Breakfast. I was a little worried because I have to eat gluten free and that's always hard. But, the waitress was so helpful and they will make anything they have gluten free for you by adding GF breads, etc. that they have freshly baked from a local bakery. I had the Bagel Breakfast Sandwich Gluten Free. Excellent and delicious. My husband had their version of Eggs Benedict. He said it was very good and loved the spicy, cheesy sauce. The service was excellent and friendly. Prices are good. It's very close to us so we will be back for breakfast and now lunch."}
{"text":"We just discovered this fantastic place!  The food the the best and with the variety of choices you can't go wrong.  Wonderful service and now we go there weekly."}
{"text":"Best Bloody Mary around,  fantastic pancakes, omelets, and everything else. Great place for breakfast or brunch with a very friendly and cool atmosphere. Recommend it to everyone"}
{"text":"Sunday breakfast at Soul Cafe are the best! Even though my choices don't change much from Sunday to Sunday, the bacon blue pancakes are super delicious, every single time! Of course, have to have the lemon ricotta pancakes once in a while, as they also are yummy (and I get them gluten free!!). But the best part of this place is the service!!!! From the wait staff all the way to the chef!! Friendly and cordial - service is for sure their focus! Love it! And of course ... have to check out the cool clothing they sell next door!"}
{"text":"I have been going to Soul Cafe regularly now for a couple of months. Service is always good- Kari is excellent- and the Wednesday fried chicken special is exceptional and quite a deal. But hands down this is the BEST breakfast place around. Creative menu and scrumptious taste! The Chilaquiles and eggs are a flavor fest and the breakfast fried chicken makes my heart flutter. Can't say enough about Soul!"}
{"text":"Appitizers were great bit over priced. Food was just warm when served. Mashed potatoes were under done & hard. Charged for bread ($6). I would not return. Friends Birthday celabration & most restaurants would give a celabration desserts but not this place."}
{"text":"Don't let the name fool ya. Think mex-cowboy inspired breakfast/brunch dishes. There's definitely no deep down south \"soul food\" here.  Vibrant ambience and decor with bright wall colors, cowboy/girl and Native American inspired artwork throughout. A large circular bar sits in the heart of this restaurant and it was slammin, especially for a Sunday afternoon. I was pleasantly surprised by their choice of music - instead of country, they played Motown classics. Seemed a little bizarre for the ambience but I'll take it any day.    It was a busy Sunday afternoon, yet they managed to fit us in with no wait. Our server was outstanding - engaging, attentive, fun and silly to top it off. Food was great. I see why people rave about it. Lemon ricotta pancakes lived up to the reviews. Triple play daily special consisted of three tortilla cups with eggs and different bean/salsa/chili fillings. Each had a unique flavor and each was a little spicy and delicious. Make sure you try the jalapeño bacon! Several kids meal options available. The one we ordered had eggs and ham, came with rainbow potatoes, and was a great portion.   Not the \"soul food\" I'm used to but still a great experience, fun environment, with unique dishes."}
{"text":"From the moment I walked into this joint my heart sank!! I have found my soulmate brunch spot.  Before I came in, I perused the menu and fell in love with the amazing brunch food variety.  AND THEN BOOM, I had no idea they would have a menu of specials when I got there.  I had the Cherry Almond pancakes, HUMONGO (HUGE)!!! Super DELICIOUS and surprisingly sweet enough that I didn't need syrup.  Magnifique!! The decor is great and the staff friendly.  I can't wait to go BACK!!"}
{"text":"We came to Soul Cafe New Year's Day and slightly hungover but definitely hungry for brunch. They had great service, very attentive and helpful. Our only mistake was sitting by the side door where a cold breeze kept freezing us every time it was opened. Moving on, I ordered the best meal there, chilaquiles and eggs. I wholeheartedly loved this dish as it was on tortilla like chips with green chili stew and eggs. Almost like a breakfast nacho but way better and so flavorful. I rarely finish my meals, nor am I a huge breakfast or brunch fan. I ate this entire meal, it was that good. It was a unique dish and some of the best green chili pork I have had recently. It is also a very artsy place and would be a great restaurant to take a date or family. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Loved the location, the patio, the service, and especially thE HABANERO BACON BLOODY MARY!  We ordered the Tex-Mex pancakes which were delicious! And the Chicken Fried steak, which my bf thought was just OK; he left over half of it and he never does that."}
