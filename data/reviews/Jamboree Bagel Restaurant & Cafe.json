{"text":"I went here with my fam, the service was outstanding, the staff were very friendly and the cookies were awesome. It was so soft and delicious...and this was at 6 PM on a Wednesday night before Thanksgiving. If the cookies were this good, can't wait to go there for breakfast and try some bagels and donuts."}
{"text":"Husband ordered the Combo Reuben and loved it. The bagel I ordered was delicious. Service was friendly and fast. We will keep this place in mind as a lunch spot."}
{"text":"We visited Jamboree Bagel last weekend for breakfast and were really impressed.  The size of the coffee cups alone sold me!  Not the small 6 or 8 ounce cups you get other places, this was a healthy 12 or 14 ounces which was perfect. Less interruption and less making it perfect with milk & sugar. We both had Breakfast Bagels and they were delicious. I recommend this place for any meal. We'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Very expensive.  Cookies hard as a rock. I would definitely go to Einstein's before I went here again."}
{"text":"Food was good and the prices were fair. I got the classic eggs Benedict with the home potatoes. Meal comes with a bagel as well which was a welcome surprise!"}
{"text":"Thought we would go get a quick sandwich, but got a full meal. Good food and service. The deserts and donuts  looked inviting, but was full. Next time"}
{"text":"Amazing! I got a turkey sandwich on rye with their veggie cream cheese and it was amazing! The cream cheese had fresh veggies in it and it was very cheap! Also bought 6 bagels can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"Super thrilled to have found this gem! The menu has something for everyone. The food was fresh and tasty. The restaurant was so clean and inviting. Staff was attentive and knowledgeable. Can't wait to introduce my family to Jamboree! They are going to love it!"}
{"text":"I'm giving them 5 stars. Not only because of their friendly service but as well on their food. Its delicious....  Not only do they make bagels but also donuts, sandwiches, Philly cheese steak sandwich and thier amazing pizza bagel. Definitely recommend them and will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Fam and I went there a couple of times now and every time we go, they staff are always friendly, courteous and outstanding customer service. The pastries are delicious and looked pleasing to the eyes. They have more than just bagels. They have a pretty good amount of various food and desserts. The price is very cheap compared to the size of the pastries. We are going back to try the other desserts. It's worth going if you are close by Ann Rd & Centennial off of the 95."}
{"text":"Good food friendly staff. Great forest cake. Ivette was great. Had the chicken sandwich"}
{"text":"We were running an errand in the neighborhood and saw their sign and decided to drop in for a quick breakfast bite. Had a delicious omelet with fresh vegetables and a delicious homemade bagel & cream cheese. Fantastic customer service and great price point for the quality! Highly recommend if you are in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Not busy but waited 20 minutes for our order. They were just talking a lot- then got both orders wrong. These two wrong orders taste decent so- 3 stars."}
{"text":"We love the food.  Why are you closing?  We told me daughter and she burst into tears.  Always great food and great service!  We are going to miss you!"}
{"text":"Walked in for a quick bite to go and was greeted by an amazing pastry case and fresh bagels! We had the jalapeno, asiago, and chocolate chip bagels. We also bought some of their bacon cream cheese and an eclair. Everything was delicious. Can't wait to go back and have a meal there!"}
{"text":"As the name suggests, Jamboree is a great spot to get your bagel fix. They have a variety of fresh-made rings (boiled for the NY taste!) and house-made schmears, which always make a great breakfast. I enjoyed the Super Egg (egg + everything seasoning) with scallion. I did not notice a lox sandwich on the menu, which is my usual go-to.     They offer lunch and dinner service, as well as a case of pastries (didn't see black and whites) and various daily breakfast plate specials. Several reviews compare this spot to Bagel Cafe, and I can see how this is a smaller alternative to consider if you live in the area. I can recommend this location but it's a bit out of my way to come regularly myself.  TIP: Grab your bagel and schmear to go, then pop by Aware Coffee en route to the freeway!"}
{"text":"Stopped here this morning for breakfast and had such a great experience!! I just moved back to Vegas from New York with a new love for bagels. Their everything bagel with scallion cream cheese was delicious. Tasted like the cream cheese was freshly made this morning and same with the bagel. The chocolate glazed donut was delicious!!! Everything was so fresh we will definitely be back. When we got the check I was surprised, the prices are great for the quality of food you're getting! Restaurant was clean and service was quick and friendly!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place because of the pictures and reviews, but I did not. My husband and I ordered a brownie truffle cake ($5), tiramisu ($5), and macaroons ($2 each). None of them were good. The brownie cake tasted like it had been sitting in the dessert case for a week. The frosting was crumbling and tasted artificial. The tiramisu was dry and curdled. The macaroons seemed to be little clusters of coconut  extract. I don't know if they make their own desserts, or if they order them but either way, something needs to change."}
{"text":"Hubby and I stopped in for breakfast after seeing great Yelp reviews and wanting to try something new. We ordered a bagel with egg, cheese and bacon and the steak and eggs with home fries ~ DELICIOUS and totally tasted like bagels back home (NY)!! The service was great, the coffee was huge and we enjoyed every second. We'll definitely be back soon to support a local business owner!!"}
{"text":"Family owned business. Can't wait to return and tell everyone! Bagel Cafe has some competition!! Food is sizable and delicious!! They are relatively new. Service great too!"}
{"text":"This place still seems to struggle with consistency. Best not to go on Mondays because the girl behind the counter ain't cuttin it. She never asks or tells you what sauce or side salad comes with your order. The burger is really good but they still refuse to use a higher quality bun instead you get a bun that looks like it came from the store that cost .99 for an 8pk. I ordered a fried chicken breast sandwich. Breast being the key word. Only to find it was 2 fried chicken tenders instead. I guess tenders are technically breast pieces. There was more batter than chicken. This place could be better they are cutting corners obviously. I'll give them one more try but not on a Monday. The Tuesday lady is way more knowledgeable and the food id way more consistent."}
{"text":"We love this place!! So delicious! It has fresh bagels and so many more options for lunch and dinner!!"}
{"text":"2 stars only because the food and service itself was great- my issue was the overall flow of everything. I walked in thinking I'd see a variety of bagels- the bagel section was small and little unit next to the wall that I couldn't even read. They have more donuts than bagels (which all looked like heaven by the way ). Not only that but there are tables right in front of them and there was a family sitting there enjoying their breakfast and I felt like I was on top of them while trying to pick a bagel (sorry family).  There is NO menu when you walk in. The nice hostess came up to me when I was in line and asked what I'd like to order- \"uhhh do you guys have a menu?\" She apologized and went and grabbed me a little menu pamphlet. Once I ordered there was no place to wait without being in the way and stepped outside then came back in. I know this place is new and small, but that's my 2 cents. The experience was just awkward but the food was great."}
{"text":"Traveling from California we wanted a delish yummy bagel shop and we found this spot and it was AMAZING!!! Hands down best bagels I've tasted in a long time!!!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. East coast style deli with really good bagels , donuts , breakfast lunch and dinner options. The desserts are impressive. Staff is friendly. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Dinner was delicious. I had the stuffed cabbage and he had chilli fries. Great conversation with the owners. This is a perfect addition to Centennial Hills."}
{"text":"As an Elite member I love to support smaller, non chain restaurants as often as I can which his why I've wanted to try Jamboree's for a while now!  Everything out our meal and experiance was perfect!!! Truthfully I wish more of my experiences were as good as this one.  Today we tried three menu items and thanks to the Yelp Review Special we received a free doughnut. The staff was really sweet and made us feel like we were regulars. We ordered the Biskets and Gravey, the Breakfast Croissant Sandwich  (sauage with american cheese), and a kids menu chicken fingers.   1. The biskets and gravey were a 4/5 for me but a 5/5 for my daughter. The sausage is really really good and the gravey has just the right amount of pepper and salt. The biskets are fantastic. I'm going to try something different next time but would definitely recommend trying this if you are lover of B&G.  2. You guys, the breakfast croissant sandwich was very best breakfast sandwich I've eaten in Las Vegas (...yes I paid for my meal and yes, I'm still telling you it was THAT good!!!) The croissant was the perfect amount of crispy but NOT DRY!! I chose sausage and I'm so glad I did!! For $6.50 I will never bother going anywhere else. Also comes with the most delicious fruit bowl. 100% I must try.  3. So my daughter turned 10 last month and we are going back and forth between the kids menu and the regular menu. Today she chose the chicken fingers off the kids menu. She and I were both pleasantly surprised. You know how sometimes kids meals just come out gross .... this was not the case at all. I hate to keep saying that everything was \"the best ever\" but realistically after one bite my daughter said \"these are the best chicken fingers I've ever had\" . The French Fries are what I think of when you order fries somewhere. Fresh and crispy. P.S. for all you ranch Fanatics you have got to try there's. Oh my God delicious!! Thank me later   Can't wait to come back back and try all their other goodies. I didn't even get to talk about their pastries and fresh bread! That's for the next post!!"}
{"text":"Don't go there people  The worst service not fresh food rude customer service  Employee speaking Spanish between them  If I can rate them zero I will"}
{"text":"Came here last week for lunch and a bagel and was pleasantly surprised! Food was yummy, bagels were delicious and doughy, and the desserts were very good. Service was excellent and we will be definitely be coming back for the breakfast!"}
{"text":"Stopped by here and ordered a breakfast special which was a bagel sandwich and coffee and my hubby ordered a pastrami sandwich on rye bread. It came with fries and a choice of a salad. I have to say it was a lot more food than I expected. We came home with leftovers. It's only been open for a short two months, but I hope it's successful as the food was good, the prices were reasonable and the experience was pleasant. Wide variety of sweets and I am looking forward to future visits as they offer breakfast, lunch and dinner and are close by to be a convenient regular place for us."}
{"text":"If you like bagel cafe you'll love this place. The chef left bagel cafe and opened his own shop. Better prices and the same great food. Right around the corner from our house. My wife and i love New York style bagel and deserts.   Also open 6am-8pm   Thanks guys keep up the good work!!!!"}
{"text":"Nice to have a good deli in the neighborhood. Great bagels and fresh pastries. Nice Rubin sandwich. Great friendly service. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Great food. Great service! My new fav spot. Make sure to try the cannoli's."}
{"text":"This place is great. I'm so happy to have it in my own neighborhood! The house-made bagels and donuts are SO good. I ordered a veggie omelette with hash browns. I was delighted at the generous portion (had to take half home) and the food was delicious! Amazing looking desserts! They even have a great selection of Kosher options. I'll be back! Often."}
{"text":"Awesome family owned place to eat bagels and donuts are amazing. The lunch items are really good. They have an awesome selection and very nice."}
{"text":"Awsome place to have breakfast nice portions of food for a good price the cofee taste yumm fast service very sweet workers and delicious cakes"}
{"text":"First things first the food is awesome, 4 stars for that, but three stars for inconsistency. The first time we came here my girlfriend and I ordered 2  cheese omelets with sausage. The lady in the front told us that the meals came with a drink and also asked whether we wanted our sausage on the side or in the omelet. We got specialty bagels so they costed extra. My girlfriend didn't get charged for the cream cheese or the bagel. And I know this because my girlfriend and I paid separately and she paid 11.37. Her meal consisted of a cheese omelet with sausage ON THE SIDE , with a raisin bagel and strawberry cream cheese. My meal consisted of a cheese omelet with sausage INSIDE, with a plain bagel with jalapeño cheddar and I paid 14.37, they both came with drinks. So I got charged 3 dollars and more just for a specialty cream cheese? Seriously?  I don't understand why the prices were different. I even had to check my bank statement just to make sure I wasn't trippin.   The second visit, which was 1/27/18. Both our meals costed 11.37, ordered the exact same thing and when I asked the cashier if it came with a drink she said no. She handed us our food and asked if we ordered anything else but the bagels weren't in the bag. She would've forgotten our bagels if we didn't ask for them? Also, she didn't ask if we wanted our sausage inside the omelet or on the side. Won't be back for the breakfast if the consistency isn't worked on."}
{"text":"My Mom and I decided to give Jamboree a try tonight and I'm sad to say we were disappointed. I had the chicken noodle soup and my Mom got the Rueben with corned beef. My chicken noodle soup was missing a key ingredient-the noodles. Our server never came back to check on us (and we were the only customers there for the majority of our meal) so I couldn't even tell her this. Our drinks were empty and eventually my Mom just got up and filled them herself. Her sandwich fell apart as soon as she got it and she had to eat it with a fork and knife. We took desserts to go, so hopefully they are good. My soup was good but would have been better if it actually had the noodles I was expecting. The service was severely lacking. We waited A LONG time to pay our bill and order the dessert. If our desserts are good maybe we'll pop back in for dessert, but I don't think we'll dine in again."}
{"text":"The service is friendly and welcoming. I walked in craving bagels and realized they have a full menu. I ended up ordering the best club sandwich I have ever eaten and their fries are amazing!"}
{"text":"Stopped in the other night to check out this new place. picked up some pastries cookies cupcakes. Staff was pleasant and friendly.   Took everything home and enjoyed it later and 2 days later. Still fresh and delicious. I can't wait to try the cannolis. They were out when we were there.   I am so glad we went in and we will be back.  The only downfall is they sell Pepsi products."}
{"text":"Wow, Very nice place with excellent bagels, breakfast and lunch offerings. I am here at 8:30 am on Tuesday and it should be packed. It looks to be new and the center is still under construction. This place makes all the bagels and bread fresh and the kitchen is open. Fantastic find. Come check this small family owned place out.  Chef Marc highly recommends.  I had the classic eggs benny, coffee and toasted sesame bagel.  I will also take home some pastry"}
{"text":"Extremely impressed absolutely love this place excited to have it in the neighborhood. Just had an amazing breakfast sandwich this morning can't wait to try all the goodies and the many many menu selections- Soup Sandwiches breakfast etc...wow"}
{"text":"Had breakfast there on Sunday it was delicious. Went back tonight to try a dinner Sandwich and that was also fantastic. The macaroons are to die for. Thank you guys for such great service"}
{"text":"Life changed for us the day this place opened! It's a weekly Sat. AM stop for us. The BEST bagels, incredible flavored cream cheeses, delightful danishes and desserts, and servers who are equally as sweet. Give it a try."}
{"text":"The cigar was amazing!  I got a dozen donuts and they were really good!  I would defiantly go back."}
{"text":"OMG!!! What a gem!!! Amazing service what great food and there prices you can't beat!!! Every single thing even the cannoli crust to the cream cheese in the donuts is made from scratch.wonderful place absolutely wonderful"}
{"text":"I saw the post on the Nextdoor app about this place. I admit that I am very snooty when it comes to bagels, cream cheese, and donuts. I usually only go to Weiss or bagel cafe. I went in this morning and got a dozen bagels (which is really 14), three 1/4 quarts of cream cheese and and apple fritters. I have to say I was extremely pleased with everything!! Whoohoo! Honestly, the bagels at Weiss and Bagel cafe are just a tad better. Also, they have salt bagels which are my favorite. But Jamboree didn't have salt bagels. However all of that is minor. Overall the bagels got 4 out of 5 stars from me, the cream cheese was delish and gets 5 out of 5 stars from me and the apple fritters..... well they get a 10 out of 5 stars from me! Literally the best apple fritters I've ever had!! I'd also give the service 5 out of 5 stars. They're a new small business to the area and I definitely plan to support them more! Can't wait to try some more breakfast items. The breakfast sandwich was recommended. So I'll try that next."}
{"text":"A breath of fresh air in the Northwest!  A deli close to home! Great prices, excellent service and amazing food!  The bagels are fresh and homemade! Salads are huge! Soup is creamy and flavorful!  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Had a bagel and a cake slice from this bakery. The bagel was fine. The cake was over sweet and did not taste homemade but rather chemical filled. It was an okay experience but probably nothing I would crave."}
{"text":"I was disappointed. Ordered the salmon and everything bagel with bacon and the bagel was plain. The bacon tasted strange and was rock hard. The beef dip was OK, but I didn't receive the 3 specialty bagels I paid for. Wasted $30 but now I know it's not worth the effort with so many other places to eat at on centennial drive."}
{"text":"They just opened and we stopped by to check it out. Everyone was so friendly, we felt like part of the family. We only picked up pastries this time, but we'll be back for fresh baked bagels and bread as well as breakfast, lunch, and dinner - and more pastries too :)"}
{"text":"Awesome food!! I'm so glad this place is doing well. It's nice to see a family run place succeeding! My husband had the French toast. He said it was super yummy. I had poached eggs with bacon and toast.  My eggs were cooked perfect.  I would recommend this place and we definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Bagels are great but what kind of bagel place is closed on SUNDAY!?!?!?!?!?!? Come on you need to be open on sundays that's when everyone wants bagels!"}
{"text":"I would like to know if the people posting these reviews are family members/drunk or on drugs! Went here this morning for breakfast, our coffee came out with bubbles in the mugs when my mom asked the waitress where the bubbles came from she said it happens when she pours the coffee. No thanks. There are 8 tables and 6 people working there they are so disorganized one girl runs around doing everything. They put all of the food in their microwave before they bring it out so it seems like it just came off the grill. They must have forgotten to do that with my moms pancakes because There were cold. We had to get up and refill our own drinks. Food was okay not great. We will not be back"}
{"text":"Went on a Monday. Big mistake because they are closed on Sunday, baked goodies didn't look too fresh. Got the pastrami sandwich, it was tough and dry. They don't make their own pastrami. Omelet was OK, but didn't look like they used fresh eggs, maybe egg beater. Asked for chicken soup, sorry not today. Some items on their website are no longer on their on site place. I really wanted a bologna sandwich, but not on the menu. Place is very simple looking. The bagel tasted ok, but nothing like Bagel Cafe. Sorry but I won't be back."}
{"text":"Always on the lookout for a new place to try.  My first time here.  Clean place, friendly staff.  Couldn't decide between the cheeseburger or the corned beef.  I said to myself if the burger is good I'll be back to try more.  Looks like that's what I'll be doing and looking forward to it!  Got a doughnut for my yelp check in, I gotta try their huge cheesecake next time!"}
{"text":"I am so glad there is now a quality bagel shop close to my house! Went in this morning and picked up half a dozen bagels and one of their cannolis. The bagels were definitely fresh. I went home and has one immediately. Perfect blend of texture, in a new York style bagel. The young lady who assisted me was VERY polite, helpful and professional. Their prices are right on par with other homemade bagel shops, and they do 14 bagels for $12.50.  I will definitely make this place my new home for fresh bagels. The cannoli  was ok... still looking for a place that does a nice big, crispy shelled cannoli! But for bagels... this is the place"}
{"text":"We ate here for Breakfast, I had Eggs Benedict which where so delicious my favorite. As for the desserts were yummy with coffee. Three days later I went again... everyone is so nice and its very clean and has a nice vibe. Will return soon! Highly recommend. Perfect place to enjoy your meal."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service, save room for some yummy dessert too! The portions are big. Had the club sandwich, it was excellent. We also had a Greek salad. Very good indeed."}
{"text":"Yum! These bagels are insanely fresh!  A coworker picked up a dozen bagels and brought them into the office. I couldn't believe how fresh and delicious the bagels were! Later in the week, I stopped in to pick up a bagel to go. The service was super fast & friendly!   The prices are pretty awesome too!!! Will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"This place is pretty amazing! Good service, good music and decor, small little neighborhood place. Bagels are super fresh and perfectly toasted. Bacon and cheese omelet with home fries was perfect. Sausage omelet lacked a little flavor and hash browns were way too salty but still good. We also ordered biscuits and gravy which were so yummy. Great variety of bagels and baked goodies like donuts, cookies, cakes, cheesecake, etc. We will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"I am sooooo excited that a local deli opened in our neighborhood !!! The everything bagel and scallion cream cheese was tasty. The cups for Coffee are nice and big ! I got a latte the second time and it was sooooo good! Really enjoyed myself. My husband loved his food too! They also put cartoons on for my children to watch!!!"}
{"text":"Went in to try some desserts, they had a nice selection and good price.  The black and white cookies and tiramisu was great! Place is very clean too!"}
{"text":"Wow what a little gem.  Came in on a Saturday,not very crowded, got served right away.  Very friendly wait staff. Food came out quick, and excellent.  Had the pastrami sandwich on an onion which was really good with a cup of cream of cauliflower soup which was also very good. I will definitely be back to try some other stuff"}
{"text":"The best Bagels , amazing bakery  fresh product friendly services!!! We will back definitely!!"}
{"text":"Great little bakery/ deli we have here. The place is relatively new (3 months from what I was told). The inside was clean and organized. I was craving a donut so I only had a couple donuts which were delicious but after looking over the menu, I'll be sure to be back to try their sandwiches and soups! Very happy to have the here in the north west area"}
{"text":"Terrible restaurant they didn't have any dinner items and we went at 5 they said they had no dinner items left no turkey no mashed potatoes then we ordered stuffed cabbage they brought us corned beef and cabbage and so then I ordered a cannoli I'm Italian it was the worst cannoli I've ever had do not recommend this place and they've been open for and a half months I don't give them 6"}
{"text":"Well the two stars are for a clean restaurant. Sat down for 15 minutes and was never acknowledged by the waitresses who kept walking by. Its a shame, with all these good reviews we were excited to try their food, but we ended up leaving hungry and went to another nearby restaurant."}
{"text":"Ordered chicken noodle soup  and rice pudding, the soup was one of the best i ever had. And the rice pudding excellent i rate this place a 5"}
{"text":"Wow this is a hidden gem snuggled in a shopping center strip in north west Las Vegas area.   Let's start with the staff, wow they are amazingly nice and attentive.  We felt completely welcomed and not rushed at all!!  The food, everything I tried was delicious. All their food is made in house which always has my stomach!! They have bagels, donuts, pastries, cookies, cake and even cannolis.    The facility is clean and comfortable. Very nicely lighted and welcoming.    If you are in the area stop in for a yummy in the yummy vanilla latte!! Made with love"}
{"text":"Bagels are amazing and as close to a real NY Bagel as I've found here. Bonus that they also have other favorites like B&W cookies, Rainbow Cookies and Rugula, and other baked favorites that are hard to find. Came in to grab bagels to try out for my husband and I and very happy with selection and service. Staff was friendly, bagels were excellent and I was able to surprise my husband with his favorites. We will be back often as soon!! We miss NYC, but this place makes some of the food cravings more attainable. Can't wait to come back and try with my MIL when she visits in a few weeks for breakfast or lunch."}
{"text":"Stopped in to try their water bagels and they are the Best we have had in Vegas. We also got a couple of their homemade donuts which are great. All the cakes looked excellent too."}
