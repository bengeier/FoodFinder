{"text":"Went back to this resturant, and again the food and Service were exceptional. I ordered the 'Soup of the moment' several time and they were amazing.  
The servers were efficient and professional, I would definatly recommended this place to friends and family."}
{"text":"I visited this restaurant on Wednesday, March 31st while staying at the Hilton for a conference.  The decor is lovely, modern, and great background music conducive for dates.  My two colleagues and I were quite hungry, and the waiter promptly served bread and drinks.  The menu has great choices....I decided to take a chance on the jumbo lump crab and avocado salad appetizer.  We also ordered truffle pizza with arugula salad.

The crab appetizer was served in a cylindrical design with a tomato broth.  This dish did not work for me.  First of all, no crab lumps...just stringy crab.  Clearly not fresh.  The avocado was quite bland, and the cilantro was too strong for the dish.  The tomato broth was intolerable.  It was a complicated dish that was not executed well.

The truffle pizza was pleasant and earthy; however, the arugula was too strong for the subtle flavor of the pizza.  All in all, it was just OK without the arugula.

For the entree, I ordered a baked black cod dish with mushrooms, beef fritters, wine emulsion, and creamed leeks.  I felt the $32 price was a bit steep for the serving size; however, it looked delicious.  I took a forkful with everything on it to get the full flavor...and the verdict is salty with a hint of dull.  The cod looked great, but as I bit into it, the texture was off...a bit undercooked.  The textures and flavors didn't work for me...the food was not fresh...but the one consistent theme was salt.  My co-worker only finished half of her bacon wrapped chicken dish.

All in all, don't go for dinner.  However, for breakfast, the buffet is a great choice at $28.  That's why I did not give it a 1-star."}
{"text":"Usually when you read a review you expect to hear about how the food was, service, cleanliness of the place, etc.  Unfortunately, we never got a chance to experience any of that.  Let me explain.

My wife and made reservations to have lunch here and showed up 10 minutes early.  We were promptly seated and waited...

and waited...

and waited...

The restaurant was about 50%-60% full and I noticed that an older group of people that were seated before us just got their water and made their order and we had already been seated for 15 minutes!  

After another 5 minutes we just got up and left.  20 minutes spent waiting and a $4.50 charge to park downtown.  

Thank you Tundra for literally absolutely nothing."}
{"text":"Came here on Friday for lunch.  Ordered the salad with chicken to start which was alright, nothing great but not bad either.

What did me in was the Kobe beef burger.  Loved every bite of it.  The beef was cooked perfect, not overcooked but good enough for a burger.

Will definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"We ate here on Christmas Eve with visitors from out of town.  We had booked reservations based on the menu on-line, but when we arrived (and after we were seated) we were provided with a fixed menu from 2012.  OK - it's green to recycle the menu - but not the food. 

The salads were sparse and bland, but since we went primarily for steak we tried to be optimistic that things would improve.  The steak was tough, dry and unappealing in appearance and taste (it even looked tough - think of cartoons where shoe soles are served).  The toughness and texture were unfortunate characteristics complicated by the lack of steak knives (and service).   There is nothing I can recommend about the food.

I can't recommend the service either.  I'm not the most sophisticated diner - but I'm also not the most inexperienced.  I have friends that are servers and know it can be a tough job - so I try to be understanding while remembering that, well, I am the customer.  The only positive was the hostess.  

Our server started out mediocre at best.  He provided basic service while giving the impression that he was being slightly inconvenienced.  Which seemed odd since there were very few other people there.  We confirmed that the fixed menu was the only option and made our selections.  I can say this - he did eventually bring the food to the table.  Other than that we never really saw him any other time and by the time we were done with dinner and ready for the bill - I was ready to tackle him on site as he walked by and wrestle away the bill to which he seemed to have grown so attached.  We waited.....so....long...

The final insult was that someone else at the table grabbed the bill instead of me.  Because we were talking and anxious to leave, the bill was paid with a generous tip (holiday cheer from this person I suppose) and we got the hell out of there.  Later it was mentioned that given that it was a fixed menu, the bill seemed awfully expensive.  Perhaps we paid another table's bill?  When I was told the amount, we emailed Tundra for a copy of the bill.  They provided it (actually, promptly).  Upon closer examination of the bill, gratuity was included automatically.  We didn't expect this as a party of only four.  It would've been nice if after seeing the obvious mistake/over tip our server confirmed we meant to leave the extra amount.

Finally, I emailed the manager and expressed my disappointment with the experience and about the lack of communication from our server who did not earn the outrageous tip.  I never received a response and that sealed the deal for me.  We won't return and won't recommend Tundra.  Overall a poor experience."}
{"text":"Stayed at the Hilton for work, and we ended up having lunch at the Tundra on the first floor. 

I had the burger, and I thought it was really good.  Overall I was happy with the meal.  I was seated with 15 others, and two folks did comment that their beef was over cooked, was medium to medium well and not medium rare."}
{"text":"This is pretty much the typical boring hotel restaurant.  As a breakfast buffet destination it's better than average;  The eggs, meats, and juices are all quite good, same with the meats  - the baked goods were a bit pedestrian,  

Sadly, breakfast is as good as it gets here.

The restaurant tries to present modern Canadian cuisine with lots of atypical proteins; bison, venison, etc, but the prep doesn't match the hype.  There is a uniform blandness to almost everything and a curiously unappealing note to many of the sauces.  

Service is of a pretty high quality, although the servers seem intent on positively reinforcing the decision to have dined there - not something that is typically necessary.

If you're staying in the hotel, enjoy breakfast at Tundra by all means, but do yourself a favour and walk a few blocks to a much, much better option for dinner."}
{"text":"Went there for winterlicious lunch. Hostess and all other people, we had to deal with, were super nice, except for our server. He came up to us with no any greetings and his first words were explaining what the soup of day was. It took me some time to get used to his accent so i had to ask him to repeat. And oh my, he started giving me an attitude every time i asked something. Then he brought definitely not our order (let's say we ordered #1 out of 3 choices), he brought #2, then he brought #3. At that point we decided to change our table/server. 
The hostess, the manager and our new server were pretty nice and accommodative. Food was on point and perfect size for \"three-course prix fixe menu\" (ordered vegetable potato soup, beer braised short rib and chocolate s'more ). 
Apparently, place gets really busy during lunch time, so we waited half an hour for the bill. The whole \"lunch experience\" took about 2 hours which is way longer than i planned. 
Overall, if rude servers don't get on your nerves or you feel lucky not to be served by our first server, Tundra is worth trying."}
{"text":"Wow. Service is terrible. If I wanted to pay $20 for a meal and be ignored - I would choose somewhere at least warm and not in a cold lobby. Sat for 10 minutes without even a hello. No thank you from the waitstaff when paying. 

If you aren't 100% immobile - do not come here. Walk somewhere else, anywhere else. 

This is what I get for not wanting to leave the hotel. That's what they bank on I suppose."}
{"text":"YELP Please allow for negative star ratings. 1 doesn't do it!

I guess I need to coin a Yelp phrase for \"food moron\", which I appear to be tonight.  I read all the reviews and still came here.

I've been at this hotel for 3 weeks now and managed to avoide this place.
I figured I'd have a few drinks tonight and wait for a guy I'm working with on a project in Toronto.

First off, I will never in my life meet a server that will care less than the bartender that waited on me did tonight.  People often say \"I don't care\" but you know they do even if it is slightly.  
This is the person in this world that does not care.

I ordered a beer and thought get a few of what they referred to as \"tapas\".
I ordered a Brie grilled cheese with bacon and tomato and some sweet potato fries.

I waited quite a while-ok fine! no problem!  The food arrived and I immediately thought about throwing it at someone.  Both items stone cold and when I bit into the sandwich there were sundried tomatoes that were uncut so the entire filling slid out and it was virtually inedible and very tough to chew.  I left half of this very small sandwich. 
I figured...OK moving on to what looked like great fries.  Stone cold..Not warm but COLD.  

The waiter came over and not at any point did he enquire about my meal or my lack of eating it.  he just took the plates that were filled with food and moved on.  I'm a little puzzled still what happened.

I like this hotel but my god this restaurant is so far beyond terrible it is bordering on criminal."}
{"text":"First winterlicious experience of 2014, and I am a fan. The interior of the restaurant very nice however, greatly dislike how they have the computer station for hotel guests to use right at the entrance of the restaurant, kind of tacky! 

For dinner I had the calamari, steak, and creme brûlée. The calamari was alright, very lightly seasoned. The steak was great, very good quality, and the sides were not so bad. The creme brûlée was amazing, probably one of the best I've had in Toronto. The food presentation was beautiful, and creative. However, portions were a bit small. 

The atmosphere and ambience of the restaurant was good. A very nice place for a first date, or to come to a classy and fancy dinner. The server was good, and fast, although a bit lacking in communication. Also the debit machine was not working, which was a bit annoying. 

I would definitely like to come back again in the future."}
{"text":"Kevin is excellent in customer service. Very knowledgeable in cuisine and wine. A must for dinner reservations as well as cocktails....."}
{"text":"There seems to be a shift from rabbit to venison. The winds of change is sweeping through Toronto restaurants, but the storm seems to be at it's very weakest at Tundra.
..haha, get it?

So after figuring out which Hilton this restaurant was located in, we were sat by an overly warm Maitre'D. She knew me by name the moment she saw my arrive from the front doors of the hotel, but disappointingly, that was only because the place was near empty.
I wasn't impressed with the decor, or the seating we were given. It was for dinner, yet she sat my party near the breakfast buffet station.
Our waiter looked like he just got off work from Eddie Bauer. 
The menu was limited, and nothing particularly jumped out at me. 
I ordered the Bison, and so did my friend. I forgot what we got as the appetizer, but it nearly did just the opposite. It was remarkable that I was still hungry for the entree afterward.

The wine I ordered was amazing, but that's to no credit of anyone other than the winery.
At one point, the waiter tried to convince us that hotel dining is becoming the new trend, as opposed to restaurant dining, because restaurants had to worry about rent as well, so their attention is not fully devoted to the food itself...whereas hotel restaurants don't pay rent..yada yada yada. I think he was looking for an opportunity to practice his English.
Unfortunately for him, he said this in the presence of my Bay Street friend, and we all know how unforgiving that breed of yuppies can be.
I thought she was going to bite the waiter's head off. 

I'm not impressed. 
Tundra, whatever storm they're cooking up, it is still unremarkably a hotel restaurant."}
{"text":"**Review of the Tundra Bar only**

I had stayed at the Hilton recently and at that time, the Tundra Restaurant and Bar was closed for renovations. I thought to myself to try it when it re-opened, and had the perfect opportunity yesterday as I had to attend a party nearby. I decided to meet up with my boyfriend at the Tundra bar as I was very hungry.

The décor is modern etc... I really liked the high ceiling and the table that we sat had these divine comfortable cushions. The bar menu is quite extensive and when the waiter asked for my drink order, I told him I was ready to order the spicy salmon roll and prime rib burger with an extra order of cheese. The rolls had a tempura shell and it was freshly made as it was still warm. It was very good. I devoured my burger in 1.5 minutes (timed) as that was how hungry I was. No talking. No small chat. Just me chomping.

I ordered a glass of wine at $28. Exorbitant. There were some wines per glass priced at $35 (barf). I mean...downtown-Toronto-bar price-gouge much?

All in all, I really enjoyed my time at Tundra bar. The atmosphere is not douche-y at all. The high ceilings and open-airness of the bar make it spacious and large. It's actually quite casual so no need to feel underdressed at all going to some downtown bar. Service was very efficient and endearing - our waiter kept asking if everything was okay but not intrusive. Probably, the man saw my crutch and me devouring my burger (with bits of bread and meat flying all around Tazmanian-Devil-cartoon style) and thought, poor girl, doesn't get out much but is ordering a glass at $28 so...yes ma'am!"}
{"text":"Ate here for dinner while staying at the hotel. The Indians/Blue Jays game was on at the bar so I figured I'd watch from the restaurant rather than my room. 

They offered a fixed price menu tonight which was all quite good. Butternut squash soup was tasty, short rib perhaps a little too much bite in the sauce but otherwise good. Crime Brûlée was good but small. 

Biggest hit - and this seems consistent across many reviews and review sites - is the terrible service. I've been sitting here ready for my bill for an inning and a half. Literally with an empty table in front of me.  That's crazy bad, almost like they were trying. 

Too many good options here to come back."}
{"text":"The first time I came here, I would have rated it 4 stars.  Then, I returned twice and both times were very, very disappointing.   It had to do with the food's taste as opposed to quality.  I don't know what has been going on in that kitchen since 2007 but something just isn't jiving.  It is hard to explain, but I had no desire to eat the food on my plate after one bite.  If you can go from ravenously hungry to repulsed in one bite, I think that says it all."}
{"text":"I ate here in July during the Summerlicious event/festival/whatever you want to call it. They had a good menu, and the food was impressive. It was a bit blah because although our waiter was a darling, we were on the first floor of the Hilton hotel and the atmosphere wasn't anything spectacular. We were there on a quiet night, so that may have been a contributing factor as well."}
{"text":"This was one of the worst bars/lounges I've ever been to. A friend who was in town and I stopped in for a quick drink on a Saturday before going out for dinner and the place was packed. Nothing wrong with that at all, but staff accordingly! Not only were they obviously short on bar/wait staff, they weren't apologetic about it at all, and made me feel as though I was pestering them to get a drink. By the time they came over I just asked for whatever their house red was, and the guy said, \"No, you have to pick one from the menu\". Never had that happen before!

The atmosphere was uninspired and I couldn't wait to finish the drink and leave. Nothing about that place made me want to stay and spend my money there."}
{"text":"Wine is way overpriced or at least compared to what I usually pay in the states (here= $18 for 8oz). Went here out of convenience and not wanting to go out in the cold. Entree was good and a decent size. Was excited to see creme brûlée on the dessert menu but utterly disappointed when it arrived. It's possibly the smallest and most expensive creme brûlée ($12) I've ever had in a restaurant."}
{"text":"I arrived in Toronto for a business trip and ended up at Tundra because it was the closest place to eat other than Ruth Chris. The ambiance is pure business hotel lobby and I wasn't expecting much from the food. I was really surprised. The menu was locavorish and quite interesting. I had the whitefish with spaetzle and cabbage. It was perfectly cooked, fresh and delicious. Even the dessert had an interesting presentation. The cocktail was tasty and the bartender made it to my specs. My service was efficient and friendly. I'm really surprised at the mediocre reviews for Tundra on Yelp. I had a very positive experience and would recommend it to other business travelers."}
{"text":"Food was lukewarm at best, and overpriced for what the dish was. It's currently Winterlicious in Toronto, but I was not even offered their Winterlicious menu despite the fact other tables were choosing off this menu. 

I found the service varied by table- better and more prompt service if you were dressed like a professional and older. I am a professional as well, but was not dressed like one when I ate here. People who were seated after me were approached by a server and given drinks 10 minutes before me. Way to make assumptions about people's status. 

I only ate here because I stayed at the Hilton, and I was pressed for time. Lesson learned, better to avoid hotel restaurants if at all possible."}
{"text":"We live in the city about 10 minutes away and wanted a nice break after a long work day and walking home after work. 

The vibe of this lobby lounge is very, very dour.  

They have a *diverse* service staff which you think would be welcoming to all people's but sadly not.  A smile or eye contact seems to be a commodity rather than a courtesy. 

Our server was \"Grace\" but there wasn't a trace of grace or kindness in this woman. 

Maybe she had a bad day. We all do. But geeze...
We seemed to annoy her just being there. 

All the staff just seemed to be in the wrong profession. And never a smile on anyone's face.  And not because they were busy.  It just seemed to be the norm. 

They had a music duo the night we were there (piano, guitar) which was the only reason we stayed. They were seasoned professionals and very good. 

Thank gawd for the distraction. 

On the other hand the cheese tray and charcuterie board were very lovely, with savory rustic choices and an inviting presentation.  

Sadly, the food had more personality than the service staff or the room..."}
{"text":"I almost didn't want to come here because the reviews seemed lukewarm at best.  But then I noticed most of the dates of the reviews were older.

The host was smiling and very friendly.  The staff was very attentive.  People checked on me often.  I selected the winterlicious pre-fixe menu - which is Toronto food fest promo at a lot of restaurants.  The food was quite good compared to the reviews.  I see the point some people made about it being a little bland - but it turned out it was just a little under seasoned for my taste.  A little salt and pepper and the flavors really shined through.  The side of buttered cabbage that came with my entrée was some of the best prepared cabbage I have ever had ever.

I will eat here again the next time I stay at this hotel."}
{"text":"Not great, not bad.  The Toronto Hilton bar and breakfast nook is like a normal hotel joint.  No surprises here."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant :) My husband and I come here on special occasions from time to time, and recently I also did a menu tasting for my dad's birthday. I've tried their winterlicious menu recently too. Service on the whole is pretty good - sometimes it takes a bit of time to find our server to get things, but it could also be because the restaurant is busy at times too. Ambiance is great, it's not too loud even though i'ts located in the lobby, and the lighting and decor of the restaurant was quite clean and not too bright. The food itself is great. the flavours go really well together, and usually I don't find the food too overseasoned, which tends to happen a lot at restaurants. There are always so many components on the dish, but when paired altogether, it's quite cohesive - I love the combinations! The dishes are usually plated beautifully (you can see all the photos I've put up). Their chicken is quite juicy, and the braised short rib/pork belly dishes are so good. I don't think I've ever tried anything I didn't like yet. I would say consider menu tasting if you really want to see the potential of the food here at the restaurant. This place is definitely a treat for me whenever I feel like having a delicious meal downtown :)"}
{"text":"Service was inconsistent and slow at times, food was fair. There are definitely better choices available."}
{"text":"I had a friend staying at the Hilton and we went to Tundra for drinks on a Saturday night around midnight. The place was almost empty. Not a hoppin' night spot, but it is a nice place to talk. The server was professional and courteous. When we first sat down, he said \"you guys look a little young, do I need to check your ID?\", to which we burst into laughter, and he seemed a bit embarrassed and didn't actually make us show ID. They do a very nice martini. I hadn't seen this friend for a long time and we had a lot to catch up on, so our waiter allowed us to stay as long as we wanted after closing (we just had to settle the bill first). It was sorta nice to have the entire bar to ourselves!"}
{"text":"I went for lunch with a colleague yesterday. If you only have an hour to eat steer clear of this place it took 20 minutes just to order our drinks,  and 5 minutes for them to show up. Then our server who barely spoke or understood English was busy socializing at the bar with the other staff that was doing nothing for over 15 minutes. We had to go get her to order our food! We should've left then.

The carpaccio was bland and flavourless. I had the steak and salad which had French fries mixed in with the salad! I swear the cooks must have been stoned one night and thought \"hey man, salads like healthy but fries are delicious. We should totally like make a frenchfry salad it'll be delicious and healthy!\" (Read in stoner voice)

We then had to chase our server again to request water as she never offered any so I decided to ask for the bill then so we could finish our meal before the leafs won the Stanley cup.

All in all lunch took over 90 minutes. Way overpriced and not structured to accommodate people attending for lunch breaks.

I will admit the resturant looked very nice and the hostess was very pleasant. If management gave half a damn that resturant has potential for for now I give it one star and will not be returning."}
{"text":"They do a wonderful breakfast buffet.  The breads, meats and jams really get the day going.  Coffee is too strong.  Also did salad and cheese plate for light dinner.  Very good female server.  Prices in Canada more than make up for any exchange differential.  Tundra is not higher in the prices I'm finding in Toronto"}
{"text":"As I stayed in the Hillton Toronto, this is the place for my breakfast. It is a typical American food, and the choice is quite limited. You will have eggs, beacon, sausages. Nothing much. They run the menu all year long."}
{"text":"Great service. Chicken fingers were the best. Caesar salad also really good."}
{"text":"I really loved their food and desert was also amazing my desert came with their house made pistachio chocolate! Oh my gosh!! I think i am in love...."}
{"text":"I went to Tundra as part of their sumerlicious menu for a pre-theatre dinner and enjoyed the experience. I certainly didn't find the problems with the service that others have experienced. We arrived late for our reservation due to traffic and had a short deadline because we wanted to make it to the theatre in time. They accommodated us and did not make us feel rushed at all. The food was very good as well. I had the 
crisped wild ocen perch with mediterranean salad with a mocha tartlet for dessert. The atmosphere is very spacious and open"}
{"text":"Decent for a hotel bar/restaurant but not over the top. I only came in for desert so I may update this review in the next few days after a dinner. 
The desert menu looked pretty good but I ended up with the crème brûlée. It looked gorgeous but unfortunately it didn't taste as good as it looked."}
{"text":"I gave 3 stars because it wasn't aweful or anything but at the same time...nothing really stood out for me. Very bland and typical...The experience was pretty boring. Hostess didn't even smile. Staff seemed really busy, my table was missing a cutlery despite making reservations for 3...so we waited...and waited...

The server didn't really explain the meal when they arrived. But I guess they didn't have to because it's winterlicious? I don't know...

But ya I mean, again the food wasn't terrible but don't think I'll be coming back here. Nothing really to look forward to. 

Oh and we mentioned that we parked inside the hotel but apparently they don't give discounts for customers which I think is BS. (Umm Paid $24 for like about less than 2 hours?)"}
{"text":"The food does not deserve the price, especially the salad is not tasted. Restaurant located in Hilton Hotel and the atmosphere is good."}
{"text":"Stayed at the Hilton this past weekend. Decided to come down to the bar for Lunch. Had a great Cosmo and ordered the sliders. Sliders were delicious. 
Also came dined on the restaurant side the following morning for breakfast. Decided on doing the breakfast buffet. Wide variety of things: Fresh baked muffins and breads, oatmeal, cold cereals, fresh fruit, double chocolate pancakes (delish), chicken sausage, bacon, eggs, tea/coffee, and juices. 
I recommended dining here if staying at the Hilton. Great food and service."}
