{"text":"Went here for a birthday we were a group of 22 people and the service was good. It's not a big restaurant but it's great in the summer with the terasse. The pizza is very good cooked in a wood pizza oven with nice thin and tasty crust. The gnocchi poutine is a must have soooo delicious with the cheese, sauce and braised veal. They have a pretty large selection of gelato which is great to enjoy on the terasse on a hot summer night. The only thing that was negative was that we were sitting close to the pizza oven and our section was very hot.   I would reccommend this place and definetly go here again for a nice pizza....the prices are fair and the quality is good."}
{"text":"Excellente pizza au four à bois. Nous sommes allés sur l'heure du lunch pour un anniversaire, nous étions 9, le service a èté très lent et plusieurs n'ont pas eu leur repas en même temps. Encore une fois, la bouffe excellente, mais le service ...nous sommes restés 2 heures et nous n'avons pas pris de café car il fallait retourner au boulot."}
{"text":"We had a delicious meal here. I got the pasta special of the day and it was pretty good, but the star was the carbonara my partner got. He talked about it all the way home. The gelato was delicious for dessert as well. Fully recommend this little place."}
{"text":"1 thing to say! EVERYTHING is amazing!  but those pizza dough fire oven baked MOZZARELLA/NUTELLA balls! Leave me speechless"}
{"text":"Came here with kids based on yelp reviews. Apparently we had to make reservations, yet were seated and all worked perfectly. Place gets busy, but things flow quickly as food does not take long to get on your table. We had margarita pizza and pasta carbonara. Flavors were rich and of decent portion, service was stellar. Def worth a try if you are around."}
{"text":"My favourite restaurant in Anjou. They have a terrace facing Jean-Talon agree it's not the best view, but you're still eating outside. You can't go wrong with their pizza. Their gnocchi s poutine is to die for!!! You'll dream of it after trying it. I always go for lunch, expect to spend an hour 30 minutes. The gelato is also amazing, quite pricey, but it's a good treat in the summer."}
{"text":"Très bon et sympa.  Ambiance chaleureuse.  Un peu dispendieux."}
{"text":"An acceptable place to have a coffee and gelato or grab a quick byte in the area. Nothing really impressive about the place but atmosphere, food and service are OK."}
{"text":"Great wood burning oven pizza."}
{"text":"Truly wonderful food - above and beyond standard Italian fare to the freshest, most robust and delicate ingredients and flavors. Friendly prompt service even though they were super busy to capacity and we didn't have a reservation. Speak English and French. Great experience."}
{"text":"Franco Kano Reviews: 1. Food was Incredible, I was very skeptic about eating in this area and my expectations were met very easily. Good portion sizes and reasonable prices 2. Pizza's range from 14-18 dollars. They are personal sized with 4 big slices on each plate. Menu is organized from cheapest price to most expensive 3. Great salads, pizza and pasta with quick service 4. Location is great, you can sit inside or out, not too loud unless there are many people inside. 5. Parking on the street is feasible  6. I've had many pizza and pasta in Miami but this place was just as good if not better  7. Very family oriented"}
{"text":"First time and definitely not the Last Had amazing calamari  The pizza was to die for  I was thinking about ordering a 2nd it was so good  And to top off my supper a delicious gelato made by master ice cream makers Zak and Papi are the secret to their amazing pizza"}
{"text":"Love love love! Seriously a hidden gem! The service is on point, the food also , however I do recommend reserving because when there's a large group , the restaurant gets full fast."}
{"text":"First time to La Bella Italiana and definitely not the last. This restaurant has great potential!   Service was excellent, our waitress was really nice and always smiling.  The decor is simple and pretty. There's a good ambiance with great music.   The food was amazing!! My friend and i shared plates. We first got a salmon tartar that was quite tasty. Then we ordered the \"caprino\" pizza and we both loved it so much. After finishing the first pizza, we decided to order another one and we had the \"bella italiana\" one, also very good.  My friend and i were very much impressed by this italian place. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I'm not from Montreal, but I went there to visit. I was looking for an Italian restaurant that would be worth visiting, after being unsuccessful in my previous choices. I'm very happy I chose this place. The waiter was incredibly nice and patient. The food was fantastic and delicious, and it didn't take that long. I would definitely recommend La Bella Italiana."}
{"text":"Gnocchis (faits maison!) au gorgonzola mémorables... Autant que la pizza au four à bois. Les frites étaient vraiment excellentes. Je regrette de ne pas avoir pris un dessert... Ce sera la prochaine fois!"}
{"text":"Kind of upscale, kind of casual. Came later before closing but the staff was accommodating and seated us quickly. We ordered a pizza to share which was out in 15 mins tops. Waiters spoke english and french which helped (we're dumb Americans). It seems that this place is known more so for its gelato which we didn't get to try unfortunately due to the time. The pizza was very good, crust cooked well though it could've been cooked through a little more. Toppings were fresh and had great flavor from the sauce. It was served with this interesting pickled peppers blend which once topped on a slice gave it a rich peppery flavor.  Sangria was good, made only a few fruit on top and in a decent size for the price.  Overall would return and recommend this place. Try the gelato though because I couldn't :/"}
{"text":"Solid option in the area that is open late and family friendly. Now in the heart of Saint Leo the italian needs to be good and the gelato has to great. We came with our new born, friendly, fast and reasonably priced. For sure we will come back if we are in the area. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I can't believe that I have been to the Bella Italiana numerous times and never reviewed it.  La Bella Italiana originally started as an ice cream place but evolved over the years into a full blown restaurant.  If you're in St-Leonard and in search of some classic Italian comfort food then come here.  They do the basics like pasta and pizza and always have a few daily specials.  It is a pretty casual place and can get busy easily so you might want to consider a reservation if you're coming on a Friday or Saturday night.  When it comes to the antipasti it is the standards that you would expect from any Italian restaurant.  While I usually start with a basic salad sometimes I'll mix it up and try something else.  I really like the meatballs here.  They are tasty and juicy and will remind you of the kind your nonna used to make.  I typically go for the pizza here because while the pasta is pretty decent I find the pizza is what they are best at.  They use a wood-burning oven so the crust gets crispy and has a smoky flavour to it. My go to is the pizza with mushrooms and I always enjoy it.  Since they have been in the ice cream business for so long you can expect a sizeable gelato selection when dessert roles around.  The gelato is okay but certainly not the best I have experienced in Montreal.  I can't comment on the other desserts since I haven't tried them.  The service is generally speedy and the prices are reasonable for the area.  If you are in St-Leonard and in search of some good Italian food then this is your place.  I always enjoy myself when I come here for supper."}
{"text":"I just had the best Italian meal in a very long time. I'm full. Ordered the Eggplant Parmigiana. Tres delicious!! Calamari was very good and the Caeser salad was excellent. I will be coming back. I don't understand why it's 4 stars. This place is worth visiting!! Tres Bon."}
{"text":"Good good and good service. My party of 2 adults and 3 kids enjoyed the pastas and pizzas. Will go back again."}
