{"text":"On our way back from the library my friend and I decided to check this place out. It was cheap enough $1-3 per item, comparable to a Superstore/Metro bakery. Unfortunately the quality is about the same and the consistency even worse! All the tarts are cloyingly sweet. My face puckered up like it was anti lemon or something. I think they have something with sugar producers the way governments have deals with ethanol manufacturers, I don't know... all I know is unless you're having coffee with it, it's pretty tough to eat. Speaking of tough the steak in the \"steak and cheddar wrap\" was literally tough and falling apart. The canned mushrooms didn't exactly help the flavor either. The chocolate croissant had some cheap, bitter, and very grainy chocolate in it and was still as week old corn beard. All in all a terrible experience I do not hope to have again."}
{"text":"Easily the best Portuguese tarts I've ever had. Even better than the tarts I had while in Portugal. The rest of their baking is delicious and beautifully prepared. 

Also, super-friendly and very nice owners.

Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"A wonderful surprise in Whitby! This is a sure fire hit with the ladies who would like a cozy place for a cup of coffee or an afternoon tea accompanied by tasty assorted patisserie.

The patisserie here is perfectly executed, which is not too sweet, hence allowing the different exotic flavors of sweet orange, almond, amaretto, chocolate, & cream etc. to come out. 

At first glance the patisserie reminded me of shiny gems as they sat in the store display case. When I tasted them they tasted freshly made, the sponge & creams were spot-on! 

Don't let the previous reviews dissuade you. One can't judge the place on the sandwiches alone, which by the way came to us in hot & freshly baked bread.

The place is clean & bright, & the servers were attentive. Will definitely be back for more especially the patisserie!"}
{"text":"A place like this in Toronto would be pretty good but being in downtown Whitby, it's probably the best place for food you can find. I've come here many times for their custard tarts and cakes. That being said, probably like it more than most since its similar to the sweets and pastries I had when I was younger."}
{"text":"Good place to have breakfast but if you're looking for some great Portuguese pastries, this place has a great variety to choose from."}
{"text":"Mind blowing? Not really. But decent breakfast/brunch, and good pastries - at least the natas I had.

Sandwiches are well priced, a tosta mista (which is your classic Portuguese grilled cheese and ham sandwich) goes for $4.25 you can get a solid breakfast for under $10 here.

Downsides:

1. No refills on \"Canadian coffee\" - I can understand other coffee drinks, but man, get a coffee pot and offer free refills on the basic stuff.

2. Service is really slow - I think though that's mostly because they're busy. And busy is good. It's not unfriendly, it's not ineffective, it's just a bit slow.

Overall, I think this place is somewhere I'll patronize regularly, because good coffee, good custard tarts and cheap tosta mistas work for me. And it's closer than Nova Era in Ajax is to home.

Perfect? Nope. Solid? Yes."}
{"text":"They may make good custard tarts, but consistently bad reviews on service and cakes.

1 star for the horrible service experienced with the baptism cake. That's just inexcusable to spell God wrong."}
{"text":"There is such a mix of quality with the products here that it can't justify more than two stars. Some of the cake slices and cheesecakes are delicious, but others are just too overly sweet, and for some reason plastered in what they call \"whipped cream\" but in reality is edible oil. Edible being used loosely...

To me, for a bakery that purportedly makes good cakes, it is a crime to use edible oil. And until they change I will look elsewhere for such products.

That being said, their savoury items are nice, I particularly like the sausage bread and ham & cheese croissant.

There's a fair sized seating area if you want to eat on the premises, with two TVs showing CP24."}
