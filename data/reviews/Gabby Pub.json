{"text":"AVOID!!!!!  Myself and a friend had dinner here, he ordered off the breakfast menu (ham and eggs) and I ordered the fish and chips.   Service was slow to non-existent. meals were served without any cutlery and when I requested some, only I was supplied with any, my friend had to ask seperatly and wait even longer.  Food quality was terrible, the ham was poor quality and over cooked and while the fish wasn't as bad the batter wasn't quite restaurant quality.  That was the end of my dealings with Gabby but my friend went back the next morning to give it another chance. When he went to put cream in his coffee he found that the packet had expired and now half resembled cheese.  Long story short if you are looking for a nice meal go next door to Fry Basket, if its a bar you want, there are many others around that are better."}
{"text":"This is based on my last visit few years back.  Before owner was changed, it was my go-to-place. After then, forget it.  I and my wife were impressed with their cutlet combo so we became quite regular here for long time. With our hefty complement over and over, we came here with my sister's couple and parents without knowing the owner changed meanwhile. Ordered cutlet combo, which comes with pork cutlet, fish katsu and hamburger steak. Then, got pork cutlet only so asked to correct it.  Don't be too surprised with what happened.  Waiter, who seems to be the son of owner, came back to me and asked whether I ordered correctly. Wow, what an excellent customer service...  Really impressed!  It wasn't the end of story. That waiter (yeah, it was him again!) took our dishes with angry inhale. He left pork cutlet outside while chef was preparing for other two missing kinds. When the dish was served, pork cutlet was really cold... As owner and chef changed, the overall quality was really bad, too.  Absolutely MEMORABLE dining experience :("}
{"text":"I've been here many times but in here because my employee cashed his cheque beside. This bar is boring. It only has Korean music. Food is ok can get it everywhere. Price us not cheap for what it is."}
{"text":"I used to go to Newtonbrook Secondary and Midway was a good place to go for lunch. Its not close to the school, in fact you had to walk through Centrepoint mall and down the street to get to it.   Sometime in the last 3 months, Midway changed owners and changed names which i hadn't known till i got into the Restaurant and noticed a difference. It's now called Gabby pub.  My friend and i sat down for a meal since i was a big fan of how midway used to make the all day breakfast. No complaints, the food was still as good, although im not used to the way the current chef makes the scrambled eggs and potatoes but safe to say, the food is still delicious.  They close pretty late at night so its definitely a good place to stop for a quick meal if you're off work late and kinda hungry for all day breakfast."}
{"text":"Probably the worst service i've had for years.  The waiter was a disaster. We asked for small plates to share as he was passing over the food to us. The waiter smiled like a creep and said \"Do I have four hands?\"  Is this guy FOR REAL? I am determined to never return and would warn everyone not to go.  The food was okay. The price is high."}
