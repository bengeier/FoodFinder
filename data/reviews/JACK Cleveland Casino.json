{"text":"This review is only for the buffet. It was a weekday and I ventured downtown with friends for the $10 buffet. I was very excited to go, since I have friends that rave about the place all the time. It was a special promotion, since it was so cold outside. Normal price $26.99. The deal was too good to be true! Unfortunately I was disappointed with the quality and selection. I'm not trying to be bias, but the \"Asian\" section was the best. The green beans are highly recommended. The beef was too rare for my taste. Tinted my vermicelli red :(. I enjoyed a taco, but I felt I could have made the same thing at home. The bakeries were ok, but I do recommend the ice cream. I hear it is home made. They have a variety of flavors. My favorite was the coffee.   Maybe it was a bad day for the buffet. I may come again, but not for $26.99. If you gamble enough ($$$) the buffet is free..."}
{"text":"Overall Jack Cleveland Casino does the trick.  I was headed there strictly for the poker room. The room is spacious offering many 1-3 NLH games 4-8 LH and when requested larger stakes. The room is packed with televisions to view from any angle. The only downside is having to pay 4 dollars for a Coors light while playing."}
{"text":"Gets a little crowded and the limits are slightly high for cleveland, overall good time and Kristin behind the bar was fantastic! Sometimes the garbage overflows the trash cans and there is literally a pile of garbage on the ground. Could be a little cleaner but I have fun and the garage is a great addition."}
{"text":"Have visited several times through the years.  Objectively, one's enjoyment is greatly driven by expectations.  * It isn't Vegas and can never be Vegas.  The drinks aren't \"free,\" because they can't be by law. * The parking situation is difficult, because of the urban location.  Plan ahead and understand the prices and playing requirements. * The buffet is far closer to Golden Corral than Vegas, but is of reasonable quality for the cost. * Enjoy the non-smoking environment.  What a treat for those who have suffered in other places...  Of paramount importance to me are the gaming conditions, particularly with regards to Craps.  I am happy to report 10X odds and a reasonable $10 min bet.  Dealers were friendly and efficient.  I think they offered the All Small/All Tall bonus bet, but am not sure.  As for slots (which I don't play), expect an average return of 93% (per Casino Player reports).  Won't be better because of the lack of competition.  Particularly in conjunction with a trip to the nearby sporting venues, it provides a well-needed few hours of diversion."}
{"text":"A BIG SHOUT OUT TO DAN GILBERT and the Horseshoe Casino team. The place is amazing. Excellent renovation with great care keeping the historic building true to its character. The staff went overboard to welcome everyone and the city of Cleveland really shined. The casino staff is still getting its sea legs and only a portion of the tables were available but those that were are packed and folks were having a blast. Cleveland will be proud when the place opens to the public next week. Will be a good addition the the growing and expanding downtown scene."}
{"text":"Worst place you can possibly go. We walk into the casino, get carded and they scan our ids, take pictures and we're extremely rude. We then go and sit at the $5 table, she gives me chips and then tells me I have to put $10 out. What??? We then go to leave because we weren't going to play and get to the parking person after being there for 30 minutes. She tells us $25!!! It says $6 clearly on the sign. She tells us we have to read the sign. We ask to speak to a manager and she says you can go walk to talk to the manager. She was throwing rude comments constantly while we sat there in a yelling match. We finally throw her $25 and she says she is going to call the police on us. NEVER GO HERE. NEVER NEVER NEVER. THEY STEAL YOUR MONEY ALL THE WAY THROUGH. COMPLETE BAIT AND SWITCH."}
{"text":"They don't let you give a 0 star rating? Boo.  They took my \"hotel\" reservation for $350 for 4 people and never said they didn't even have a hotel.  Pathetic.  They relocated me almost a mile away to some other place in which 4 of us had to share a king sized bed.  Two people just left.    I'm sure it was so they could get a kick out of watching us carry our luggage past the blackjack tables looking for a hotel that doesn't exist.      Go to another casino. They one stinks."}
{"text":"Went here just to gamble my friends remaining $30 voucher. After losing the money in about 15 minutes on the expensive tables, we proceeded to leave only to find that parking was $40. We didn't even stay an hour. If they had put up a sign on the way in we would have parked elsewhere, but it was too late. Don't waste your time/money. This place is a joke."}
{"text":"Spent a few hours here in May 2013.  Overall Casino was very good.  Did not have as many older style Slots that I like - too man multi-liner jobs.  The Poker room though was very good!  It was one of the best Poker rooms I have ever played in - even beating a lot of them in Vegas.  If you play Holdem you will love this place.  Good dealers, and excellent over all service.  Very helpful staff."}
{"text":"Cleveland Cavaliers fans should all give ourselves a big round of applause! Cavs Majority Owner Dan Gilbert has delivered BIG TIME on his promise of making The Horseshoe Casino a World Class Establishment.  Also, Dan Gilbert has helped put Cleveland on \"the map,\" because the Casino has breathed new life into our city's tourism and economy.  Legend has it that Gilbert was giving his wife a birthday party, in a Detroit Casino, when a couple of visiting Cavs fans recognized him and said it would be nice to have a Casino in Cleveland.  Those fans planted the seed, which he bought back to Cleveland. Then the rest of the Cavs fans (and Clevelanders) rocked the vote to make the Casino a reality here. And what an absolute Gem it is!  Although this is just \"Phase I,\" and another brand new connecting (Phase II) Casino will be built in the future--the old Higbee Building never looked more beautiful.  The Casino consists of three levels--which contains a Food Court, several Bars, an Upscale Buffet, a World Series of Poker room, a private Lounge (for High Rollers), and a host of Slot Machines and Table Games.  I love the Cleveland-themed pictures, murals, and portraits of our sports legends, professional team logos, and famous celebrities who were born in the Cleveland area.  Be sure to sign up for a Total Rewards membership (with your valid photo ID), at one of the Customer Service desks located on each level.   Upon membership, you will receive lots of nice perks (as you accumulate points, when you use your membership card), ranging from free parking, Gift Shop discounts, eligibility for daily promotions, and free or discounted food and beverages."}
{"text":"Totally mixed reviews here...As a Diamond member i want to give a good review, but some of the dealers and coaches could take a customer service class. Playing for three hours at a time, would it hurt to get asked for a free lunch. I typically play minimum 25 dollars a hand at most all carnival games, the coaches know how long you play, and they never offer anything. Just once in a while would be nice. Also, there are a handful of dealers that are just terrible, and what is sad is that many of the regulars say the same about them all. Just having worked in customer service for over 20 plus years, this is the main area the casino is lacking, and its really only with a handful of coaches and dealers."}
{"text":"We have decided to visit downtown Cleveland on Saturday early afternoon. Our plan was to eat lunch in one of the restaurants  downtown ( not at the casino since we did not care for their food) and than go to the casino. We have parked at the casino parking lot. After 1/2 hr of searching for a lunch spot, we have discovered that all the places that were recommended to us were closed for lunch. By now starving, we have decided to forgo casino and go to Ohio City or Tremont for a lunch.  1/2 hr of disappointing search has cost us $25 in parking fee. ( by the way, sign listing their fees is a long, small print info. After you try to decider the fee, other cars start honking behind you and you are forced to get in. No way out of that one. ).  It will be a while for us until we visit downtown Cleveland again after this bitter pill. Great job Horseshoe Casino making sure you or other downtown businesses will not see my $$$$.  Looking at the other reviews, this has happened to your other unhappy patrons as well. Way to learn from your mistakes."}
{"text":"Nothing is the same as it was with total rewards. The new J.A.C.K. Rewards stinks. You have to run $333 dollars thru a slot machine or $1000 thru a poker machine to get your parking comped. Who has this kind of money? Not me. You could play for a hour at table games to get your parking comped but they changed the blackjack odds from 3 to 2 to 6 to 5 on the lowest limit tables. This is the worst casino ever. PA blackjack rules are 10 times better. My old card would get me free valet anytime. My new card gets me $20 dollar valet on weekdays and $25 dollar valet on weekends. This is just plain nuts. You guys lost a good customer."}
{"text":"Went last night for the last time. I swear the benefits have gone way down since the total rewards program shifted to the Jack casino. The machines eat up your money and never pay out. We spent the night hoping for a bonus on several machines and only got one. I swear before Jack took over this place was way more fun. What especially annoys me is how much you have to play to park now. It's 10x longer than before. I'm going to stick to playing in Vegas at real casinos."}
{"text":"Stopped by for an hour to check out the new casino. Very nice. The parking on a Sunday was $25, so we played the slots for 30 minutes after signing up for the Total Rewards card so that we could get our parking validated.  We spent $35 on slots so that we didn't have to pay the $25 parking fee. Hmmmmm... Overall we had fun."}
{"text":"I miss horseshoe. No real free play. Buffett is always the same and closes way to early. It should be open for late night gamblers. You can't get a drink on slot machines. Waitress are always hanging out at the tables or in a corner."}
{"text":"Walked around here for a bit. It seems clean and well run. Much bigger than I thought it'd be. Didn't get a chance to play any games"}
{"text":"I like this casino!! It's classy and plenty of security. The service is good too. People are friendly and helpful. It's nice"}
{"text":"Everything you'd expect from a casino. Lots of people paying money to play video games that let you win about as often as the lottery does. That said it's beautiful inside and a great place to warm up if it's cold out. It's quite possibly one of the nicest buildings in Cleveland, which may be a little bit sad.  The buffet is bomb if you play enough to get it for free, otherwise I'd pass on it."}
{"text":"God awful, was way better under Caesar management.   Do not waste your time or money."}
{"text":"Why I Will NEVER Go Back to Horsesoe  The slots are tight there but the table games are ridiculous! On the first floor, the blackjack and roulette are so crowded and people are waiting like vultures to pounce on an open spot. They refuse to open additional tables. Then, when some of the upstairs pits open, they take forever to get started even though they keep saying \"five to ten minutes\". The limits are too high. You're hard pressed to find a $15 table. My friend and I each had $$$ in our pockets and walked around for TWO hours trying to find a blackjack or roulette table to play on. I think I'll go to a casino that WANTS to take my money."}
{"text":"What a dump!!! By far worst casino in the area. Tight cramped all new machines with no good classics. Since its opened they have had a constant revolving door of games and once I find a machine I get into the next time I go its gone. Obviously they only do good with table games because there are several on both floors and always too crowded. Horseshoe is also the only casino where I have gas the homeless ask me for change while I'm playing. One night I had a woman ask me if I would give her two dollars for her 20 dimes. Really. The biggest thing against it it the nonsmoking and when you go out to smoke the security yells at you to go down the block to smoke. They don't give wristbands for under 40 so you have to re Id everytime you smoke. Ill take 500 and can only manage to lose a hundred because there is suck a lack if diversity in slots. You have to walk a city block from the parking to the casino while being harassed for change. And you better have a players card and earn 15 tier points and remember to print your reciept or you'll have to pay $25 for parking. It's sad I live 20 minutes from it and would much rather drive the two abs a half hours to wheeling island. The horseshoe buffet is excellent. I think I mite actually go there just for the buffet. In my opinion keep going to wheeling mountaineer Seneca or motor city."}
{"text":"I have no idea how to private message you. Is there a email, Facebook, text number, etc...that I can reach you at?"}
{"text":"Never ever accept one of their \"trips\" they trap you in the middle of nowhere with no option to leave early even when you get sick and have to go to the ER. We go on trips all the time and have never been more miserable! Do not accept any of their offers"}
{"text":"Great spot to take a piss after you've had too much to drink.  Don't be a fool and actually gamble here."}
{"text":"Having been to Vegas a couple times, I felt I had a solid benchmark to which I could compare the Horseshoe Casino in Cleveland. I live in Cleveland and being often disappointed with the nightlife in this city, I found myself quite surprised the first time I went to the Horseshoe--it was a lot of fun!  There are many accessible bars (although those used to Vegas will be very disappointed with alcohol prices).  There are some solid dining options available as well, including a local favorite where I am from: The B-Spot, a Michael Symon restaurant that serves up some killer \"burgers, brats, and beer.\"  I am not a very seasoned gambler, but there is an assortment of slot machines and video poker throughout the casino as well as a large amount of table games.  However, on the busy nights, open seats at the low-minimum tables can be hard to come buy (as long as I am discussing minimums there is a high-roller area as well). Finally, the Horseshoe Casino in Cleveland offers many exciting promotions including free giveaways that sound too good to be true but are in fact legitimate: I have received a free hammock and food processor at this casino before even beginning to gamble. They also offer parking promotions related to the time and money you spend gambling in the Casino.  So, all-in-all, the Horseshoe Casino in Cleveland is a good casino and can be a lot of fun.  It is in the middle of the city, it is brand new and aesthetically pleasing, and can be a good time.  HOWEVER, I have been treated, on several occasions, with near UNACCEPTABLE DISRESPECT and RUDENESS by the casino staff and their security officers.  I do save this comment for last because I believe the casino merits a visit and is one of the more fun things to do in Cleveland (and considering the \"gamble\" that Cleveland has taken on the casino, I would like to see it succeed).  But for me personally, I do not believe I will be spending any more time there because customer service and certain members of the staff are simply apathetic, disrespectful and rude. After my most recent experience with being treated disrespectfully after having thrown my money down the drain at the Horseshoe Casino, I called their customer service line and asked for an apology (for the rude treatment, not for having lost my money).  I did not want compensation, money or any other kind of promotional offer, only an apology for wronging a regular, paying customer. The customer service representative told me to \"sleep off\" my frustration and proceeded to hang up.  My final verdict: The Horseshoe Casino in Cleveland is a good casino in a good location with good dining, drinking, socializing and gambling. However, the people that work at this casino are rude, disrespectful, and completely apathetic when it comes to customer service, all to such a degree that I do not see myself returning again."}
{"text":"The staff was amazing.  A lot of the staff had on Cavs shirts. It was awesome to see them proud to support their city. The dealer taught us how to play black jack and showed us the hand motions as we played. Even the patrons were friendly and helped us. We actually won a little money. Great atmosphere. Safe and inviting. Good priced food and drinks are worth the money. Nice bartenders. Fun slots. Affordable."}
{"text":"BEWARE the Buffet is HORRIBLE!!! Got there right as it opened for dinner and everything was cold!! The food must have been sitting out way before it opened and everything tasted awful!! There was no tongs or service spoons at most food  stations, Did they want us to use our fingers???GROSS. Told the manager and he could of cared less!! This place has gone downhill since it switched from the Horseshoe to Jacks!!"}
{"text":"What do you mean I have to pay for my own drinks??  You drank me for free, Horseshoe Tunica. I didn't write a review for Tunica, but I didnt want anyone to know I was gaming on the redneck riviera. I had FUN at the horsehoe in Tunica MS, as well as any Binon/Caesars property. So again, and not at the slots, here at the tables, why am I paying 4 bucks a beer? And since I am tipping, why aren't you paying attention to me and keeping em coming? Meh. I won a little bit but didn't stay long. This isnt a loser's rant. I might have stayed longer had I not felt that the entire place was set to take me. Weird vibe. But Cleveland is my hometown, and I'm a total rewards member, so i'll give it another shot."}
{"text":"It's been a year now and I have been quite a few times.  Everything below is still true except blackjack is now $15 mins most of the time and the price of drinks went down.  $3 for a draft dortmunder, although there is a rumor that they might go up again.  Staff is still polite and it's a good stop during a night out on the town. I thought I would add some insight into the poker room which I neglected the first time.    Poker - There is a good crowd on Friday and Saturday nights.  15-20 1/2 no limit tables, 3-4 2/5 tables, and some pot limit Omaha tables for the crazies.  You earn a whopping $.25/hour in comps.  Gamble for 6 days and you can finally get that pizza you have been saving up for.  Dealers are good but not Vegas pros. Tip them if you win a hand, don't be cheap.  I usually play 2/5 no limit and the faces at the table become familiar.  There are always some new faces though and always someone trying to give their money away.  There is a high 10% capped $6 rake and a $1 take for \"promotions\" when the pot hits $10.  It is the steepest rake in all the land, so 1/2NL is tough.  The $1 goes, at the time of this posting, mostly to tournaments.  A rip off if you only play cash games.    Still a 4 star place.  Vegas, it is not, but good for C-town."}
{"text":"This casino is a joke. If you're looking to celebrate a special occasion (bachelor/bachelorette party etc.) definitely go elsewhere. Went there tonight with a group of friends, ready to spend money, to celebrate a special occasion and was treated extremely poorly by the staff. My friend was sexually assaulted in front of the security team by a random inebriated stranger and they just stood by and did nothing.  Steer clear of this place ladies! If you find yourself getting harassed by drunken fools the security and cops will just stand by and let it go on. Mark L and his team are very rude, and they do nothing. They clearly cannot sort through their clientele correctly and let a bunch of creeps in. Take your business elsewhere. Stay safe!!"}
{"text":"Buffet review:  Very good quality food, expertly done, with very broad choices in four styles:American, Asian, Italian & \"Shuffle\" (variety). Cook-to-order choices, way above average food and wait staff  Wait staff brings drinks, clears table frequently and help in innumerable ways--be sure to tip them for they really deserve it). Based upon experience so far at weeknight dinner in January, 2014.  $25/person.  Spend few minutes getting free club card on casino floor and get $2 off/person and priority entry.  Huge dining area, very attractively decorated, divided into small areas for pleasant ambience. Located level beneath casino floor.  I believe parking is free with the above club card with valet parking.  At least driver in our party found it to be so.  Gave valet big tip as a result.  Net result:  saved $ on valet versus self-park."}
{"text":"These people are thieves.  I don't go to the casino expecting to win.  But I asked an attendant to hold my machine while I went to the restroom.  They said they could.  I came back from the restroom to find no attendant and my $200 gone.  They said they'd help, then left me sitting at the machine for 2 hours.  I got the impression they were just waiting me out.  Absolutely awful experience.  I'd recommend taking a road trip before gambling here.  Unethical.  As an update, they left the information for me to contact them.  I did and never received a reply.  They do not care about their customers at all."}
{"text":"Sadly it seems that the solution was to remove the video games that were at the bar and replace them with the standard video poker games.    This is a total bummer as I enjoyed playing the video craps while sitting at the bar.  I have no idea if the glare issue is fixed b/c I now have to sit over in the big circle to play the craps.    Totally bummed about this and will probably spend a lot less time at the casino now."}
{"text":"We went to the Horseshoe for my wife's 30th birthday tonight.  We were at the casino for about an hour and had one drink.  We went outside to have a cigarette.  Today was real Cleveland winter weather, and the Horseshoe apparently doesn't clear the area in front of the building.  Snow, slush and ice everywherem  Upon re-entering the casino 5 minutes later, the \"bouncer\" said that my wife was drunk because I held her hand while we walked down the stairs (boots and snow) and refused us entry.  When I asked if we could just walk to the Renaissance hotel through the building, they said that we'd have to walk around (almost 2 city blocks in the snow and wind).  We will NEVER go there again.  Wish I could give a zero star rating.  They have no idea what customer service is."}
{"text":"You are waiting for everything. The casino cant hold or keep up with weekend volume. But its good because it keeps me from gambling that much longer! lol Diamond lounge is nice but once again service is extremely lacking! Why are there 3 or 4 people at the front door checking cards and only 2 bartenders? Service is lacking. Stood at the diamond lounge bar for 18 minutes and then walked away. Its not the staffs fault, they are doing their best. The management is the problem. Food court style dining, you feel like your in a mall! I only go when they give really good comps but overall I feel the horseshoe is a waste of time. If there was another option for table games in NE Ohio I probably would not go to the Horseshoe. I would have given a 1 star but they are providing jobs to many clevelanders. This is just my opinion."}
{"text":"Hello, It may not be suitable for everybody, meaning it requires the C or K status to enter but the food at the Library (Diamond) lounge is simply delish!! It's of real good quality as is the people who make it happen every single day. I thoroughly enjoyed it last night (or I was hungry, LOL...) especially when I am a sucker for Vegetarian Minestrone Soup. Keep up the good work guys!!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff at the Horseshoe CLE make it a fun place to visit.   Have had the buffet several times and really enjoyed the variety and quality.   Our waiter named John is customer focused and has the best laugh that cheers up everyone at The Spead.    Hope to visit again soon!"}
{"text":"Not a gambler casino person but got roped into taking my 79 year old father in law there to play poker.  Pluses: Very friendly helpful staff. All you have to do is look like you need something and BAM! there is a staff member.  Interesting interior since it is the Higbees building. Decent prices at food court choices. Ate at B Spot. Friendly smiling staff and pretty good food. Clean restrooms.  Minuses Parking sucks. There was some type of giveaway of free slot monies that wasn't advertised. Connected self park lot was full by 1 pm and valet was limited to VIP.  Parked at a nearby cesspool parking lot. Price was right but difficult with someone in a wheelchair.  Homeless people begging outside entrance exit. Cloud of smoking patrons outside the entrance exit. Waitress uniforms.....seriously. They are awful. Only a very young nubile body could pass in those things. And there seemed to be a lack of those on duty today. Gift shop in odd place. Couldn't find it.  Comparing amenities to Hollywood in Columbus...I like Columbus better. Free easy parking, more spread out, free soft drinks and coffee.  Overall, I hope my father in law's hankering to play poker is satiated for awhile. I would go again though.  The other option is Erie PA but apparently they have smoking and \"non smoking\" which isn't non smoking at all. This doesn't work for someone with COPD and using oxygen. Hmmmmm....that's a thought if I get tired of dealing with my father in law. Haha!"}
{"text":"If it were possible to diagnose a company as being bi-polar, the Horseshoe Cleveland Casino would be patient number one.  To sum it up, it seems like every time they take one step forward, they end up taking two steps back.  We'll break it down by different categories:  Overall look and feel: (4 of 5 stars) I will give them credit.  They took the old Higbee Building and made it look good.  It's definitely got more of a \"traditional\" feel versus the new contemporary look a lot of casinos are sporting these days.  Lots of gold, marble, chandeliers, etc.  Good clean lines.  It kept the feel of the original architecture, which always gets an A in my book.  The only downside to the first floor, is that the table games are literally butted up against a wall.  So close that you can only walk single file past the roulette table and the Mississippi stud pit.  Not good for flow.  Especially on busy nights.  Game selection: (3 of 5 stars) I'm not a huge slots player, but unfortunately I find myself playing them more than I would like, mostly because of the availability of table games.  I have been there too many times when all the tables are filled in one pit, while another pit sits closed.  I know it's tough to forecast crowds, but this is the only casino I have ever seen that consistently has full tables, and won't open more.  That is equally as true in the poker room.  I've been up there more times than I can count when there are 13-17 people on a wait list for a game, and they refuse to open a new table.  I don't know if it's lack of dealers or what.  I can tell you I have left because of the frustration of seeing 20 people standing around waiting to play, and they won't open new tables.    Payouts: (3 of 5 stars) I suppose this is subjective.  Here's my general rule of thumb.  And this goes for slots or table games.  If you bet really low limits, you will never make money.  Period.  So when I hear people complain about the slots being too tight, or why don't you have more $5 blackjack tables... it's really a moot point.  If you are betting $5 a hand, or 25 cents a pull, you should just count that as entertainment money.  You'll never win.  For the bigger spenders, I have seen the machines pay off (I hit for a little over $600 on a $3 pull).  I also have seen people walk with several thousand at the 3-card and 4-card poker tables.  Those people were typically betting $25 a hand or more.  Are their slot machines any tighter than anywhere else?  Probably not.  You just see a lot of complaints from low limit players that think their $20 should net them $1,000 in return.  Sorry guys, it ain't gonna happen.  Food: (4 of 5)  As part of the deal with the city, they don't have any full on restaurants to compete with what's nearby.  They have three casual joints: Corky and Lenny's, Rosie and Rocco's, and B-Spot.  They are all three somewhat affordable, and have pretty decent food.  For a quick bite, you will always be able to find something here no problem.  They also have a buffet downstairs, which can be really hit or miss.  I have had great meals there, and equally bad ones.  Again, bi-polar.     Comps/Rewards: (1of 5) Here is my biggest beef with the Horseshoe Cleveland.  In year one, I earned Diamond status; which initially came with awesome comps.  Free nights at the Ritz, free buffets, free slot play, free trips to Atlantic City, access to the Diamond Lounge.  It was really nice.  Then, out of nowhere, they all just stopped.  To the point where my comps were almost patronizing.  No rooms, a single buffet a month, $5 in slot play (when it used to be $100), no trips, no gifts, no anything.  It was so peculiar, that I went to the Total Rewards desk and asked what happened.  They said they have a computer that decides comps, and they didn't know what to tell me.  Curiously, I asked some of the other Diamond players I knew, and sure enough, they were cut off too.  I can only assume that they \"wine and dine you\" hoping that you'll get hooked.  They then must assume that they think you will come play regardless of how they treat you after the honeymoon phase.  It got to the point where I started visiting other casino's (Mountaineer, Wheeling Island) just to see if all comps had stopped everywhere.  Within a week of my visits to each, I was bombarded with comps and offers.  So apparently this is just a Caesars issue.  Overall, I liked the casino during year one, but since then, they have developed this \"we're making enough money so we don't have to take care of you anymore, because there's someone else walking in the door to take your place\" attitude.  As a small business owner, the customer service experience is paramount to retaining customers.  They will more than likely keep their Seven Star Members (those who spend $100,000+ a year) but I can't see them keeping many of their middle income players, and maybe that's just the way they want it."}
{"text":"I just called today to book a room at one of the cleveland hotels and when I called VIP services she informed me that I couldnt book a room. She said that the hotel has a rating system from 1-9 and I was rated a 7 and I couldnt book a room even if I paid for the room. That is UNBELIEVABLE to me because I am a Diamond member and I have stayed at the Ritz free before and didnt have to pay anything. I wanted her to check and see if I had any offers for a free room, and if not what is the rate for for the 2 nights that I wanted, and she said that I couldnt book a room even if I was paying. That is unheard of, and I will be talking to management about that because that has never happen to me before. I was willing to pay for the 2 nights, but to not be able to get a room period, is very upsetting, and the hotel was not sold out. I hope that this never happen to anyone else. My husband and myself was trying to celebrate our wedding anniversary, very upsetting. When I go to the casino I spend my good hard earned money and to not be able to book a room for a special night for my husband and myself, makes me very angry. I have never had a problem with horseshoe until now, and I wont be coming back nor making reservation."}
{"text":"I was very surprised at this casino. Being from out of state (Oregon) I expected it to be filled with cigarette smoke like the casino's here. But I was pleasantly surprised. The place was extremely clean and smoke free. The employees were all very friendly and I had a great time. The drinks were good, the slots were tight but I would definitely come back the next time I am in Cleveland and I will recommend it to my friends."}

{"text":"Visited last Friday and found the whole experience to be outstanding.  The building has been most tastefully redone with just enough reference to its past while making it into a useful place for today.  The ability to access Tower City and the Rapid station are great features as well.  While not a big gambler the casino did seem to have a good selection of machines and table games and all staff that I encountered were most friendly and helpful.  The main reason for my visit was to eat, so I did.  The Spread buffet had a wide selection of foods including the usual casino favorites and some other items like boneless short ribs with mashed potatoes and a delicious sauce to grilled salmon with wild rice.  While the buffet did not have the overwhelming size and extravagance of the typical Atlantic City or Vegas restaurant it was certainly well done and did not disappoint.  When I left the building around 6:00 there was a steady stream of people entering and lots on the sidewalks headed toward the doors.    I will be back and proud to show off one of our newest attractions to my out of town visitors!"}
{"text":"The fucking worst. Not the place, the place is great! But KEN.... the security entrance man or whatever. Would not let me in with a valid paper ID. cause they don't allow it... which is fine. But the whole time he had a constant smirk on his face and was being a genuine DICK.  Ken should be fired. That's my only comment."}
{"text":"I went here today just to check it out as I've been wanting to see it since it had opened but never had the chance till today.  I'm from the Pittsburgh area so there are plenty of casino's around here now and prefer Vegas over any of the local casino's.    The slot machine selection I feel is very limited and lots and lots of dollar machines and not so many quarter machines.  Yes I know play big to win big but I wasn't there to walk out with thousands of dollars and anytime I go to a casino I don't expect to win thousands of dollars.  Also at 11am blackjack and roulette were 15 dollar minimum.  I can see 10 dollars but 15 seemed a little bit pricey for me so I stuck with the slots.  I had a good time and overall not a bad place.  Parking: So I pulled into the parking garage and parked and guess I misread something because when I went to leave it was 25.00 dollars to park there and I was there for a little over an hour!!!  Are you kidding me??  There are plenty of other options for me here in PA so I will never come back to Ohio again to gamble and to pay that ransom to park at the parking garage.    Food:  Didn't eat while I was there so can't really say much about that nor did I order any drinks while I was there."}
{"text":"Be aware that after 4pm the parking is 25 no matter how long you are there. We were there for 30 minutes! I feel violated. Literally paid a dollar a minute to be there. First time there, last time there. Don't go."}
{"text":"I LOVE Cleveland.....like really LOVE Cleveland.  And it makes me happy that Dan Gilbert seems to love Cleveland as much as I do! With that being said....anything that was getting as much hype as the new casino was, I definitely needed to check out!   So this past Saturday, arm and arm I went with my husband to brave the crowds at the Horseshoe Cleveland.  We met up with my two bosses for a night of hopefully winning big!   We got there around 9:30 and started waiting in line.  We got told it was going to be about a 3-4 hour wait, but that if we went inside to the entrance near Foot Locker in the lower portion of Tower City, the wait was only about 1 - 1.5 hours.  We thanked the extremely nice security guard and traipsed our way inside.  Once we got in line inside Tower City, the line was moving quickly.  We were in the casino by 10:30! Our wait was only about 45 minutes after we went inside! I wish I could find that security guard and personally thank him!   We immediately went upstairs to the food court because we were dying of hunger and we all chose Rosie & Rocco's.  My breakfast pizza was amazing and I will definitely eat there again.  B Spot was crowded and Corky & Lenny's didn't really sound appetizing.  We even caught a glimpse of Rocco himself! I was going to say hi, because I've seen him many times at Fahrenheit, but he looked busy, so I stayed away! In case he reads this, Hi Rocco!! :-)   After eating, we decided to try out hand on the slots on the first level.  We found that the drink server call button especially neat and we immediately ordered drinks!  We tried our luck on the penny slots to begin with and completely struck out! But we all kept in mind that the house always wins!   After doing those for a while, we went upstairs and had much better luck at the quarter slots.  I stuck $5 into a machine and walked away with $50! Overall, not a bad return on investment! ;-)   My boss won almost all his money back playing the quarter slots.  We've already decided that we'll be playing those when we come back!   The staff is extremely nice and very helpful.  Some of the cocktail waitresses might have been past their prime, but hey, it's Cleveland, not Vegas!   My only real complaint would be that parking was $25, BUT you can get it validated inside the casino and it'll be free then.  My husband forgot to grab the ticket, so we were out $25, but you win some and you lose some!    Overall, it was a fun experience, and as long as you aren't going there with the intention of retiring tomorrow, you'll do fine! I think it's a great addition to downtown Cleveland and they were able to keep some of the magic that made Higbee's so...well.....magical!   Thank you so much to Dan Gilbert for believing in Cleveland, seeing that many people downtown on a Saturday night was amazing!"}
{"text":"Excellent service! As soon as we walked in we were personally escorted to where we needed to go! I would recommend going here to anyone visiting Cleveland as we were!"}
{"text":"I must say it is about time!!!  I had the chance to visit a while back and I really enjoyed myself.  The one thing I did miss.........WHICH I WILL GO BACK........Is the food and the buffet.  Very impressed with the atmosphere and I still find it hard to believe its in CLEVELAND!!!  HOW COOL IS THAT.  I really think this is going to be a big part to beginning the rebuilding of CLEVELAND..... Didn't have the opportunity to hit the tables but I promise you next time I will............  Welcome to Cleveland Horseshoe!!!!"}
{"text":"Came here, out of towner; figured I'd be up against the regular players & regular dealers. My figures were true. Played no-limit & chop pot came straight on the board vs. KK; dealer tried to pay the whole pot to KK; called him out and then shifts the majority of the pot to the regular? (which he tried to give the whole pot to), why? I called them out. I tell the floor man and zero help. No review of surveillance, zero help. Be careful when you come here. Watch for card placement, taps, bends, etc. which dealers and floors could care less about. If you know what you're doing, you'll recognize the play. Dealers too. Shady, Stupid or Suspect, pick one."}
{"text":"Lunch Buffet = Kid in a Candy Store!!  Oh. My. Goodness. I loved all the food! I love buffets because you get to have a little scoop of everything and then go back for your favorites. The lunch buffet is split up into food varieties: Asian, American, Salad, Dessert, Italian, a Carving Station and one called Switch (this might be incorrect but it's something along those lines) this one switches out every other day of what is offered.  My favorites of the day were the Butternut Squash Risotto (and i tend to dislike risotto), The Kielbasa- I added the red cabbage to mine and the Bread Pudding (tasted like heaven in my mouth).  Oh and everyone must check out the rotating Gelato!   I have decided I need to go back for both the Breakfast and Dinner buffets to find out which one is the ultimate best.   *Quick Tip: Get a total rewards card firs ton the 2nd floor and you will save $2 on the buffett."}
{"text":"This is an update from my last review. They have certainly made it right, from the last visit, i spoke with Shawn and she was a true pleasure to speak with, as she apologized for the last viist and invited us back to give them another chance after the change over. The food was much improved upon, since the change to JACK. We came on seafood Friday,  a very nice selection of seafood items. Steamed mussels, several variations on shrimp, fish, raw oysters, crab legs, etc.  The only item that I felt lacked was the crab legs, they weren't very hot. Overall I was very happy with the new restaurant and we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Well its a casino but nothing great about it. The minimum bets are $10 and the drinks ARE NOT complementary! I was drinking vodka tonic and they were $5 just fyi. I thought the casino itself was nice looking but nothing really to keep me coming back. Also its right by a very busy bus stop or transfer location so there are always a ton of people standing by the front doors.   I still had fun here but been to way better casinos."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with my experience here. My fiancé called the Casino and were told that our $35.00 parking fee would be waved for eating at the buffet. (We were only visiting for dinner). When we get down to the buffet we had to wait in line for about an hour and there were empty seats everywhere. So I decided to go up to the front to ask about how long it might take and the hostess basically ignored me and turned around and started yelling to her coworkers about how annoyed she was that \"people\" kept coming up and asking her about the wait. Long story short, we finally make it into the buffet area and were seated.  We had to wait about 10 minutes before we were even brought water. We finally got to the food only to find that it was not great. The fish was very dry. In all honesty the two things I really only enjoyed were the gumbo soup and cocktail shrimp. For the price of the buffet here and income of a casino I was expecting much higher quality food. We were also barely acknowledged by our waiter, and some of the other waiters were yelling slang to each other in the dining area. Very unprofessional. To top off our \"not so good experience\" we were told that we could not be refunded the $35.00 parking fee. But wait.. That's the only reason we parked there when we could have just payed $10 in the next parking garage. So $75 for a not so great dinner. We definitely won't be returning any time soon. I'd say the casino should step up there game in the dining department."}
{"text":"Overall the place is quite nice. They did a really nice job renovating the old Higbee building. The buffet is pretty good as well and the dealers I would say are above average (very friendly and knowledgable)   However, there are some main components which led me to my rating. The unreasonably high table minimums during off peak hours (example would be a $15 min on 4 card at 11am), the cost of drinks are too high relative to the surrounding bars ($6 for a weak captain and coke - I know they can't be free, but shouldn't cost more to drink there than going to a bar), and the number of servers when at the table is low (sometimes it takes up to 15 mins to see someone come by and ask for beverages - not always but on occasion)  Place always has people and is pretty decent, but overall not too impressed."}
{"text":"What you'd expect from a casino. The bars are definitely above average. Check out TAG! Ask about battle of brews special and try something local.  The Spread buffet is amazing and IMO would compete with and top many Vegas buffets. Yum!"}
{"text":"I enjoy playing here. I've always had pretty good luck. Friendly staff. Good comps. I love the smoke free environment."}
{"text":"I'm having a difficult time choosing a rating for Horseshoe Casino. I enjoy my time there because I like to gamble and it's close to my home. The people watching is pretty great. I live nearby so it's convenient for me. I\"m glad it's here as I like having it as an option. But...  I wish there were more lower limit table games available. I'm echoing the sentiment of most reviewers. I'd play the tables more often if they had lower limits as I'm not super experienced at some of the games, and not looking to learn at the expense of a lot of $.   The parking is less than desirable. If you don't gamble for 30 minutes or play poker for some period of time, you're paying for your parking. If the main parking garage (connected by a sky walk) they use is full, I have ZERO idea where you're supposed to park to be able to utilize the \"free\" parking. The Horseshoe references a second parking location in their parking directions online, but I don't see any details about it.    I would love it if they had escorts available to parking garages/lots in the area (upon request). (I get that this isn't necessarily feasible.)  I made a bunch of $$ the last time I was there (thank you 3 card poker table!) and while standing in line at the cashier I became nervous realizing I'd have to leave with all of that cash on me and walk through an empty Tower City and outside to an outdoor parking lot. It was late so there wasn't anyone else in that area. Usually I leave with NO money, so I guess I hadn't given it much thought before.  When we left through Tower City, I didn't see any security personnel in Tower City or on the way out to the outdoor parking there. I am more actively worried about safety here as opposed to any other casino where I only feel the need to be somewhat aware. Perhaps that's my perception and perhaps it's wrong, but it's how I feel nonetheless.  I don't want to have to pay for valet parking (starting at $20) for that peace of mind.   Ohio law doesn't allow casinos to offer free drinks. DISLIKE. Stop c-blocking my (free) buzz, Ohio.   All of the employees I've talked to have been friendly. It can't be an easy place to work, so kudos to those that can put on a smile.   I've eaten at B Spot and Rosie & Rocco's but not at the buffet or Corky & Lenny's. B Spot was less than impressive and Rosie & Rocco's was okay. I'm not a fan of buffets so I'll probably only go if someone else really wants to do so. I wish there was something less meat and potatoes-y to chose from. I'd love to see a Momocho type restaurant there, or a (quality!!) sushi bar.   I like going to the Horseshoe Casino regardless of my complaints above, and will continue to do so."}
{"text":"The chic checking ID's on the skywalk area around 7 last night was awful. The line was backed up and she was accusing everyone of having fake ID's. They need to get more security to check ID's on a weekend and when they request a manger it should be timely."}
{"text":"Caveat: we only used this for parking for a Cavs game. Pros: right next to Q arena with indoor walkway. We parked on 4th floor so could go right into arena and it was prob less crowded than other entrances.  Cons: ok, $50 is a lot to park; more than we've paid for parking at Oracle in CA but it was snowing and covered parking was way to go. The biggest negative is they had ONE cashier manually processing payments when you left garage. No way to pay at a station and use a paid ticket to leave. So every person in front of us in garage was in a big pine that took 45 mins to leave garage. Why weren't there more ways out or more cashiers or newer technology to take tickets automatically."}
{"text":"You will be IDed and will have your purse checked. Also, drinks arent free, but they are very reasonably priced, i feel as if im inside of a mall or a hotel lobby in here. To say its narrow, small, and hot as balls is an understatement. Most unique casino experience of my life. they barely have tables, mostly slots...but hey if you get hungry go check out the food court..and a buffet. did i say i felt like i was at the mall here? because thats what it also felt like, but im going to take a wild guess and say everyone from cleveland comes here on a saturday night because the rest of the city was dead."}
{"text":"I came here Saturday night (peak hours). The line for the buffet was around 30 minutes. It was $25.99 or $23.99 if you signed up for their free membership card.  I also got a free coffee mug for signing up for their membership club. The line to sign up for the membership club was around 15 minutes so yet another line.   They had table games but it was so crowded you could not find a seat at them.  The slot machines were also pretty busy but I managed to find a seat and play.  Most of the slot machines have a beverage ordering electronic menu.  The beverage service took about 5-10 minutes per drink. The juice was free but the red bull was $4.   Overall I had a good time.  This place is small and crowded but I have heard they are building a larger one nearby and they will convert this smaller one into a casino for the high rollers."}
{"text":"do not gamble here!!! you will lose. this place has gone downhill and when you think it can't get worse it will....take the drive to detroit, erie or columbus where you can actually win"}
{"text":"We came here when the casino first opened as horseshoe and it was VERY crowded and hard to get on a table. We've since came back under the new ownership and our experience was more enjoyable. The decor changes are better and not as tacky. We were able to get on any machine or table we wanted without a huge wait. Overall we had a good time and can't complain."}
{"text":"Too much money for a buffet only to eat seniors low budget food no taste at all water down yuck food sorry you need to really fine real food to cook and season it up some"}
{"text":"I heart the CLE and I think the casino is a fabulous addition.  We walked in around 2:45pm-ish on a Sunday (mid-Indians game that we left because it was a scorcher in that sun!). I was pleasantly surprised that there was no line, the boyfriend and I waltzed right in. I ooh'ed and ahh'ed over what I imagined were the old Higbee's doors (they were gold and fancy and looked historical\"ish\" to me, but what do I know), and then made my way down the stairs to greet the guard - who *carded* me, thank you sir!  My eyes were then dazzled with gorgeous sparkly chandeliers, a lot of bronzy gold and clear bedazzled lighting - so fabulous! Yes, gaudy - but an understated gaudy, if that even makes sense. I was also super surprised that the casino has windows! I mean, windows? In a casino? I'm not saying you can see straight outside, but they definitely let sunlight in, like real sunlight! I love it, but I thought casinos were supposed to make you lose track of the time of day?  We stopped at the Total Rewards counter to pick up replacement cards (I guess I had one from Windsor and the bf had one from Vegas). The lady at the counter was super friendly, literally some of the best customer service ever - engaging, friendly, funny.  The bar on the second floor reminded me of Vegas, looked fancy, had a shiny, blue, faux-*snakeskin* chair - I was in love. Upstairs on the third level was the World Series of Poker room and the Diamond Lounge which looked elite, illustrious, and had a hint of mystery (yeah, probably because it was cloaked behind doors). But, that's where my Vegas comparisons have to end...  Will the real Cleveland please stand up?   To start, there was an odd line at the second floor bar - a pretty darn long line. And you know what else there were? Total DBs surpassing the line by simply standing at the counter instead of in line... ok, yes that's how you normally roll at the bar - but something irks me about ignoring everyone else you can SO obviously see standing there AND then the bar staff helping the line cutting idiots first. Maybe I was just foolish for standing in line. Anyways, when I finally made it to the bar the vodka cranberry and Malibu and diet I ordered came to $9.00. I was pleased with the price and the pour. Keeping the alcohol on a CLE budget, kudos, Horseshoe. As we circled the casino, we meandered through the \"High Limit\" room, and what did we find there? $1 Slots! What? Yes, there were $5, $25, $50, & $100 slots, but $1 in the \"High Limit\" room? Only in Cleveland. To top off the CLE-esque-ness, we stopped by the ticket redemption machines on our way out and were greeted by a casino employee instructing us to stand in line because out of the SEVEN ticket redemption machines only ONE had cash available. Yup, sounds like the CLE to me, strapped for cash.  As far as food goes, we tried to peruse the buffet, but didn't get quite a good look - you can find it on the basement level of the building. Not sure on pricing, but I'm sure like other casinos you'll pay a pretty penny for the \"all you can eat.\"  On the second level you will find the tiniest food court ever - which make sense, they want you gambling, not shoveling food in your face. Nonetheless, there are two delicious true Cleveland options - Corky and Lenny's (deli) and BSpot (burgers).  Quick Hints:  1. Parking is $15 in the casino's garage but it's free if you gamble for 30 minutes and spend like $45 bucks (I think), you just need to get it validated.  2. There's a TON of 2 cent slots, the place is running rampant with those - definitely can gamble on a \"budget.\"  3. No smoking, no free alcohol. Sorry, you're not in Vegas anymore, Dorothy. Sad face.  4, I've heard that table betting limits go up based on the number of tables filled - but I can't confirm that.  In all, during my whole visit I was in awe. I couldn't quite wrap my head around the fact that a place like this was really in Cleveland. It had its rough edges, but that's what I love about the city itself. The Horseshoe Casino was just keeping it real."}
{"text":"I play 1-2 PLO here twice in week.  1.dealers and floor person are oweful here . If you report it against regular player they wont do a thing .  2.dealers are like dumb. 80%"}
{"text":"The buffet at the casino is just that.....a buffet.  Nothing over the top.  I ate at Corky's in the food court last week and got sooooo sick.  Was not in the least bit impressed.  Never mind I was out of work for a week.  Food poisoning perhaps?  Not cheap either.  $16 for a sandwich meal.  Never again eating there."}
{"text":"This place is not worth all of the trouble. First, the elevator to the pedestrian bridge was out. Mom can't do steps. We had to go in and out and finally I sweet talked a valet to give us free valet (normally $25).  Non-smoking is nice, but this place wasn't any better than any other casino I've ever been too. I'd rather have saved my energy and driven a little farther to the newer Hard Rock Casino."}
{"text":"Not a gambler by nature, only came here because a friend wanted to check it out and I was a little curious. The place itself was packed with all sorts of people and a bunch of slot machines and a few roulette tables,Blackjack, and poker tables.  I played a few slot machines and it was oddly relaxing just casually playing a few games and hope to win a decent amount of money back. I wanted to play blackjack but I discovered it's insanely expensive to play along with poker and roulette so I never got to play it while I was there which was disappointing.  Overall it was okay, though if I were to ever come again I would have to play with more money than what I had when I came and I personally don't think this is the kind of place to go to on yourself and it's better off with friends."}
{"text":"I'm giving it 5 stars because we made some money here! I am my boo's lucky charm, and we ended up winning $400 in black jack. Free parking in the structure if you play for 30 minutes. It's fairly small, but pretty clean and a lot of different kinds of tables and slots to play."}
{"text":"Crowded Lying pit boss Tried to charge us $30 to park after being there for an hour and dropping a decent amount of cash... the only saving grace was a floor manager who saw my party was visibly distraught after trying to deal with the idiot pit boss."}
{"text":"I was here a few days ago on a weeknight. Surprised that table mins were $15 and $25. I donated $40 on slots playing the Hee Haw game. Tightest slots EVER!!!! Never once got the free bonus plays.  Eventually got the courage to play blackjack and after about an hour made $75 profit. Some drunk next to me dropped $900. Very entertaining. Place was clean but very hard to get on a table. Got the free parking voucher at the rewards kiosk."}
{"text":"I am not a huge gambler, but do like to play Blackjack when in Vegas or AC. My big problem with this joint is that the table limits are crazy. When I went, the lowest was $15 and there was only one table, the rest were $20 and up. IMO, they need several $10 tables so casual players don't have to spend the mortgage money to sit down. As an example, at a $20 table, I would have to sit down with at least $500 to stand a good chance to make a few dollars. Screw that."}
{"text":"Meh.   I'm not a big gambler so I know places like this aren't really for me anyway but I usually have fun at casinos. I've been to the casino in Buffalo and to many in Vegas. I know I can't compare this to Vegas so I'll compare it to Buffalo:   The location SUCKS. Tower City has seen better days and I don't think it's a great idea to attach this to a dying mall. I have heard that this is \"phase 1\" and a separate, bigger casino may be built later. Perhaps then I will like it but in Buffalo, it was a cool building that was somewhat impressive. Very pretty and could be seen from a distance. This casino is easy to miss.   It's also got very low ceilings and nothing impressive inside. This is also due to the location. Casinos should have high ceilings, I think, and something visually interesting inside.   My final point, which some people wouldn't mind, is that there are only tables and slot machines. Some casinos have other games, like electronic poker that you can play with $5. I really hate slot machines but don't want to have to use $20's at the casino so there was literally nothing here that I wanted to play.  I'd love some other electronic games here."}
{"text":"Ok.... So I'm 30 and my ID was expired, and they didn't let me in, but they called the supervisor and he was not a nice man.... Tall, heavy set, white hair, white mustache.... Very condescending and had a \"smart\" tone the whole time...... Ok.  Tell me no but don't attempt to make me feel like an idiot for the whole exchange."}
{"text":"My first visit to the casino was on a Friday night last September during my birthday weekend. We had dinner at Brasa Brazillian Steakhouse on W. 9th St. then proceeded to the casino for a night of gambling.   We parked in the parking deck and had to go outside in the rain to wait to cross two streets to get into the casino. Once inside, we stood in line while they checked everyone's ID. There was a Cleveland Indians game that night which was rained out causing many game-goers to go to the casino to supplement their evening. You could hardly walk through the place for the people.   I am a blackjack player and wanted to find a table. All the tables were full and all but one had $25 minimums. The other, which is the one I would've played, had a $15 minimum. We turned around and left without doing any gambling due to the fact of the amount of people in the place and high table minimums.   I decided to give it another chance yesterday on a Saturday afternoon.  It was nice to enter the casino from the parking deck via the skywalk, keeping out of the elements. Parking is free after 6 PM.  During any other time, if you have a Total Rewards players card, it is free if you have 30 minutes of tracked gambling time on your card. You must swipe your card at a promotions kiosk to receive your parking voucher.   Once inside, their was no waiting in line. The skywalk brings you in on Level 2. I headed straight for the buffet as it was a little after lunch time. The buffet is on the lower level. You get $2 off with your Total Rewards card. The buffet is layed out much like that of a Vegas buffet or any other casino. The food was typical of such buffets as well. Not good. Not bad. So so.   After lunch, being the blackjack player I am, I headed to the blackjack tables. There are tables on Levels 1 & 2. They were about half and half as far as the minimums are concerned. $15 and $25. All the tables were full with people waiting to get on one. There were about four on each level that didn't have a dealer. Why wouldn't they open them and reduce the wait time for a table?    I decided to play a slot machine while I waited for a table. I put $20 in a penny machine and blew through that in less than 5 minutes. That was the end of that.   I waited a good two hours to get a seat at a $15 table. The cards being dealt were horrible. No one at the table was having any luck. During the hour and a half I was at the table, there were only three blackjacks dealt. I blew through $300 playing the minimum and got up and left.   Tight slots. Bad cards. Long waits   The casino layout and decor is nice."}
{"text":"I was a frequent visitor of Horseshoe Cleveland and a regularly Tier 2 Diamond status earner as well as on my way to seven stars this year. I was converted to \"C\" status when Jack took over and within 2 weeks I earned my \"K\" status.   I have yet to enjoy an experience at the JACK since they rebranded, and in the dozen visits I've made since the change, each visit has gotten worse.   Let's start with facts on the differences in comps and benefits. I regularly received free play coupons in the mail, those added up to $150-$200 total per week, now I get $20 free play every 3-4 days. I also received fair comps everytime I would go after losing or winning my fair share. 2nd visit after the rebrand, was told after shelling out $1200 on the craps table, that they no longer do food comps, and if I wanted to have the pit boss call upstairs and make a big deal about, \"maybe I could get a comp\". Received an annual trip to Vegas with airfare covered, not anymore... Buffet provided me one comp for myself for a window of less than 10 days. Used to get 4 free buffets a month in vouchers, don't bring your friends anymore, they can pay.  Now for the tables... Tonights visit was the worst in this fashion, they had it down to 2 craps and 1 crapless craps table, both traditional craps tables were full, the only spot open has a 3 foot diameter sticky spot on the carpet which hasn't been fixed as far as I know for a month considering I got stuck in that same sticky spot that time ago (first time I had sandals on and it literally pulled them off my feet, it was so sticky). They obviously needed to open another table, instead we were packed in like sardines...   The staff has also been impacted by these changes by what I can only assume is a drop in the volume of visitors since the change, which translates to less tips, not to mention what seems to be the uncanny ability to not win at any table anymore (haven't left a winner once in the dozen visits since rebrand). They seem disinterested and saddened by the state of affairs.   Last but not least, drink service still stinks (same when it was horseshoe).  I'll end with what I can say is the only opinion in this whole review as everything stated above is all facts...  My \"K\" status isn't worth JACK, and I'm finally at the point of wanting to save for fewer occasions to visit the casino, and it won't be the JACK that I'll be visiting.  P.S. I thought it would be interesting to compare, but also since the rebrand I've been offered a free trip to Vegas and other places Total Rewards for almost every weekend this entire summer with tons of comps included, obviously the competition wants my business and I feel more inclined to oblige them, than my hometown Casino...BRAVO JACK!"}
{"text":"A casino is a casino, and they are mostly all the same.   They are usually a swirling and somewhat intoxicating atmosphere of carnival lights;  along with being very loud, and dare I say, an interesting sampling of humanity. The trick is that you should always come properly and mentally prepared with the knowledge and probable reality that the cash you arrived with will soon be parted from your ownership. With that being said, I am not a gambler, so after I sacrificed  $5.00 to a ravenous slot machine, I went for the food as I had originally intended.   During my visit in Cleveland, I had been told by a few people that the buffet at the casino was pretty decent. I looked at a few reviews here on Yelp beforehand, and deducted that it looked promising.   Unfortunately, when we went, we encountered a buffet spread that ended up only offering average and unimpressive food choices along with it's overblown price.   For about $25 a person, this buffet didn't offer anything really special.  I was led to believe that for such a hefty price they would offer extra and exclusive items like crab legs etc,....at least that is what I was told.    After all was said, tried and done, I really wish I would've picked another restaurant in the downtown Cleveland area because I had heard there were several other decent choices.   Oh well,.....I guess you live, (you eat), and you learn.    ** If you do decide to give the casino's buffet a spin, it could be a potential gamble, and it also might not be a winning gastric experience.         ;o/    ** Puns intended."}
{"text":"it's not Vegas, but for Ohio, it's pretty cool. major plus is the smoke-free policy! there's def. a lot of people watching  here!!"}
{"text":"Disappointed in the lack of comps/Freeplay. Other than that, it's a casino. Nothing special. My husband was approached by 2 different people begging for money, one outside and one while inside playing. My friend was approached by one also. You would think security would be able to do a better job of keeping this away from the patrons."}
{"text":"I am not a gambler, but what a beautiful place to see. If you are visiting Cleveland as a tourist then you must at least stop by this unusual sight. It was very alive even on a Thursday afternoon. I don't know of any other city that has a Casino right in the middle of the downtown area."}
{"text":"1st time today! We decided to go early Sunday morning for a breakfast buffet and gambling. I have to say \"The Spread\" buffet was on par with some of the better Vegas buffets, and it should be at 23 dollars per person for brunch. At 10a.m., there was a good selection of both breakfast and lunch items. Everything was fresh,hot and well tended to. The casino overall was easy on the eyes.Lots of dark woods and subdued crystals. No table games for us this time, but table minimums were $10 at the lowest. They were packed. Played lots of slots and video poker. Won bits here and there but ended up down.Loved ordering my dirty martini right from the keyboard of my machine. A few glitches still showing, parking voucher machine down, some long lines to get players card, but overall nicely done and certain to be another boost to Cleveland tourism. Well done Mr. Gilbert, thanks!"}
{"text":"Decided to stop by while we were visiting family that lived close by.  Highly recommend checking out their website in advance so you can get free parking.  The minimum requirement really wasn't bad.   I personally love any monopoly or wizard of oz slots, so I immediately searched for them.  They didn't have the most recent versions, but I was still happy with my options and came out making a little bit of green.  Husband played roulette and craps.  I guess the buy-ins change throughout the day depending on traffic, so if you want smaller buyins, visit earlier.  I'm pretty pleased with the experience and plan on returning the next time we're in the area."}
{"text":"Went here a few times during my business stay. Dealers were friendly and on top of things. Table side drink service was good but slowed down after last call. Hey, some of us still need coffee so we can make it to the breakfast buffet :) while on the food subject, this is my only complaint. After 11pm there is no food, not even a pizza or hot dog stand."}
{"text":"Was having a great time playing craps with other players for over 5 hours until Michael V. came into town with curse words that should never be heard by staff and a voice so loud that it made me and others stop playing.  Michael V was rude, abrasive, and obnoxious, and instead of being gentile to his customers engaged in fulminations best suited for WWE.  For shame."}
{"text":"i have been to the Jack about 8 or 9 times over the past few years, most recently today. My impressions are that the Casino is generally clean, attendants and wait staff are available, the Market District Buffet is generally OK as long as you get a discounted price. The Slots are the tightest machines I have ever played. It is easy to go through 100-150 dollars with very few \"crumbs\" along the way. I don't expect to win (maybe occasionally) but to just watch the money go down with every pull is very frustrating. Parking or valet complementary if you play enough, a nice plus (although it does not make up for the Slots)."}
{"text":"Although my recent experience was not the best, due to my phone being stolen. I want to commend the security team at this location, being from another state I filed a report after attempting to track my phone and the location being shut off (along with the phone being shut off) I knew someone had taken it. Security reviewed cameras and made every effort to help get my phone back; today I received a message that they had in fact retrieved my phone from the thief! Again, not the best that it was taken but it's expected when I either dropped or set it down somewhere. I really appreciate the efforts by Dominique and her security staff at identifying and catching the guy who did this when he foolishly returned to the casino days later!   The casino itself is set up much differently than many other casinos I have visited; and I've been to Las Vegas and Atlantic City among other stand-alone casinos. Not ideal and definitely not functional, but that's not the fault of those working there. Everyone I encountered was friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Food selection was just okay! Everything was pretty cold by the time we got to the table!  Wouldn't waste my money again, the price is a bit high for taco's( taco shells not cooked), pizza, individual chicken pot pies (nasty) and some horrible salad bar! Save your time and money!"}
{"text":"the table limits are too steep for alot of people; usually $15-25 even during the day.  that's outrageous for a new and... urban casino that might need the business of lower middle, lower class, and senior folks.  they need to start $5 tables now, especially in off hours, say 3-11 am!!!  but the service and attitude of all employees is a+.....  finally,  the buffet is the best in town:  excellent and wide selection, excellent quality, lots of healthy stuff incl. fresh veggies, fruit, and even gelato!  they have sugar-free desserts too, if you need them. the value before 2pm is good, only $15 or less and.... if you play for a few hours they will probably discount this or even... give you a free meal! after 4pm, the price is $25.   the buffet is the only good value there for food and i highly recommend it, even if you're not a gambler. skip the food court-  it is overpriced."}
{"text":"We visit here several times a year, particularly for the buffet, which has very good food.  Unfortunately, the machines eat up our money very quickly without paying out.  In Las Vegas we played a Britney Spears machine, which was 50 cents a spin and paid a lot of bonuses.  I was excited to see a Britney Spears machine at the Jack; put in $10.00, and pressed the buttons that said 1 and 50.  That should have meant 50 cents a spin, but it was actually $1.00 a spin and I got zilch.  In one minute, my $10.00 was gone."}
{"text":"MEH is the understatement, I had been here back when it was the Horseshoe and the name change has caused a dramatic decline in the casino.   For starters, I was previously a diamond member under total rewards, and have since been downgraded to a C member...what does that even mean?  Second, the buffet was absolutely aweful. Im not sure if they fired the previous chef team but i legit only tasted clumps of what seemed like salt in ALL of my meals. The wait staff was rude and rushing, you could tell they werent toally into the new change either. The security at the door made me look like an ass because my picture is of me when i was a good 50lbs heavier and he legit made me take out 7 other forms of ID, just to get in. smh. i should have taken that as a sign.  The atmosphere is dead, the vibrancy that was the horseshoe has since dissipated and turned into just another run of the mill casino."}
{"text":"Since this is the ONLY game in town, the limits are way too high. I play craps and Black jack and the games on weekends are $15 to $25 minimum. Forget that.   The place itself is very nice to look at. A repurposing of the old Higbee's building that would otherwise have sat there empty.  The small food court is ok although skip Corky N Lenny's. Overpriced, greasy, and not tasty at all. If the mall is open, go there. Same quality and much less expensive."}
{"text":"My first time at a Casino and I can say I really enjoyed this place. The staff here were very friendly and took their time explaining some of the table games to me. Only lost $80 but I had a lot of fun and would go back again. I didn't get a chance to check out the food but I will next time. It's a nice and clean place, staff seemed to enjoy their jobs and security is around but do not make the place uncomfortable. I'll return!"}
{"text":"This is a very quick \"snapshot\" review, so please keep that in mind as you read on.  Boyfriend and I had tickets for the Indians game tonight, so after taking the Shaker rapid in, we headed for the casino to get dinner and a peek at the casino.  We thought we could get in by the casino door near Brooks Brothers (inside the Terminal Tower), but a guard said that was an exit only, and that we had to exit Terminal Tower and enter at the Public Square entrance.  No problem, it is just around the corner...but I wondered about the inconvenience when it is snowing or raining hard?  The entrance off of Public Square surprised me...it was filthy!  The cement looked gross, like no one had thought to give it a power wash, especially during an opening?!?  I was not expecting a red carpet, but this looked more like a sad back entrance than a \"welcome to our new casino\" entrance, IMO.  We were greeted warmly Upon entering, and found our way to the 2nd floor for the 3 eateries.  Kudos for keeping the choices local, BF chose the B-Spot and I went for the meatball sub at Rocco/Rosie's.   The area around the 3 eateries is small - I can see during peak times, tables will be in short supply.  My 9$ meatball sub was ok, but not great...lukewarm temp, not as seasoned as I usually expect.  The noise volume was so High that I had to double check with the person taking my order at Rocco's that he had it right...he tried to make small talk with me about the casino but I could not easily hear what he was saying.  I am NO where near needing a hearing aid, so that tells you something about the noise level.  We tried a couple of slot machines, won less than we played, but but not by much!  Overall, it may not be my cup of tea, but if it makes Cleveland more of a tourist destination/attraction, I hope it works."}
{"text":"First and foremost, I want to say that the people watching here is EPIC.  Beyond that, it's pretty nice for a casino.  Feels modern and not *too* cheesy although it's kind of hard to have a casino and NOT have some chintzy decor.  Also, this casino doesn't quite have that \"desperate\" feeling that a lot of other, older, established casinos seem to have.  I'm not a gambler so I won't speak to the gaming aspect of things but I think this casino does a good job of drawing people in who aren't looking to lose money at the slots and would prefer to drop their hard-earned cash at a bar.  The bar areas here are loungy and well laid out and it doesn't feel like everyone who works at the casino is giving you the stinkeye bc you want to sit down somewhere that isn't connected to a machine or at a table.   I could totally see myself coming in here to grab a drink or two before venturing on to some other bar."}
{"text":"Doesn't compare to Vegas - No Megebucks - Bartender skipped me a few times and went to other people when I was tipping more than the people he was serving."}
{"text":"This is a beautiful, shiney, and relatively friendly casino in the heart of downtown Cleveland.  It's new,so it was very busy when I was there on Memorial day. There was no shortage of slots, but table games and video poker games were hard to get at.   I found the rewards card to be a bit dissapointing, but the long line to obtain one went fast, so kudos for that. If you want free parking, you need to get a card, and earn 30minutes of play on it that day. To me, that wasn't as easy as I thought it would be,since after an hour of leasurely, but constant slot feeding, I was under 30 minutes counted. I'm guessing they only calculate the time the wheels are actually spinning, because they certainly don't count what I would consider my \"play time\".   The buffet was mediocre, in my opinion. Im sure it's better for meat eaters, since they had prime rib and some seafood, but after having a beautiful looking pasta dish that tasted stale and tasteless, and sub-par fixin's elsewhere on the line, it was clear that this $25 buffet was no better than the local Super Moon, which is half the cost and equal in variety. They did have an impressive ice cream selection, for a buffet. I wouldn't go back (unless it was a comp)."}
{"text":"Nonna Pazza - Item #1, this is called one thing online yet another on the menu there. By far the worst seafood anything Ive ever eaten and for $18 the biggest disappointment. 1 sea scallop, 2 shrimp, 2 very small clams, 2 mussels that tasted weird with bits and pieces if calamari.. in a little bowl of cook spaghetti.. the worst. I should have asked for my money back. Staff was excellent!!"}
{"text":"Total bs!!! Cleveland got hustled!! All the comps are less than Total Rewards were. Free play is impossible, no more beverage service from machines and no more free parking. Was absolutely misled about every major aspect of this takeover."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service I have been a diamond level status since the place opened and already half way into the year already at diamond status. An employee made a mistake on payout in poker and floor was called surveillance reviewed and still got it wrong after gaming commission got involved it was finally corrected. For my troubles floor offered to put $50 in reward credits on my account then about 20 minutes later came back and said he couldn't.  All around handled horribly by the poker room floor, dealer, table games shift supervisor and surveillance. Live near by and still going to make the drive to go elsewhere prefer Hollywood Columbus anyway."}
{"text":"My guy and I were at Jack Cleveland Casino Fri, June 10, 2016 because we had a Buy1 Get1 The Market Buffet. It was Seafood Night for $36 per person. It was not worth the expensive price for the Buffet.  What Seafood Buffet? The Snow Crab legs were small, dry and some were empty. The Seafood was: Mussels, Cocktail Shrimp and maybe salmon. If its supposed to be Seafood then where was: Tuna Steaks, Red Snapper, Grouper, Swordfish, Talapia etc? All of the food was old and dry. The Fortune Cookies at the Asian were stale. The Items that were Prime Rib Frozen custard.  The ONLY Good is Promotions for slot play and that's not even good."}
{"text":"Worst casino in the Miami Valley. Haven't won anything but lost thousands. It's a disgrace how their slots don't pay."}
{"text":"I attended the \"Controlled Demonstration\" opening last night, and I have to say I was impressed. I'm not really a casino-goer, but I am a big supporter of the city of Cleveland and it's great to see everything getting built up lately. With two whole floors of gaming and an upper level for poker and the Diamond Club Lounge, the old Higbee building is much more spacious than it may appear from the outside. The most popular games were craps, blackjack and roulette, but others were available for play as well. For the slot lovers, there are 2,100 of varying types scattered throughout the two main floors - some classic and some progressive. If poker is your thing, there are poker video slots, tables and the high-stakes games, in a fancy room of their own. Finally, for those extreme big spenders, there is the Diamond Club Lounge on the top floor, only open to Total Rewards members who've earned between 11,000 and 100,000 credits a year (100,000 credits made up from only video poker would equate to $1M).  Even though only some of the tables were open and not all of the slots were working, we still had a good time. Most of the dealers were professional, fun and knowledgeable, while the rest of the staff was very friendly and helpful. Multiple employees asked if we had questions or needed direction, and someone was always readily available if we needed an explanation of a slot or how to order a drink from your game.  If you're looking for a drink, there are multiple ways to get one! There is only one bar on each of the main levels, each tucked away into the side. Drink prices were very reasonable, although I doubt they'll stay this way. You can also order from floating servers, or even use the feature on each slot machine to request the drink of your choice (the servers actually prefer this, as they know exactly where to find you). Unfortunately, Ohio law prohibits providing complimentary drinks, so that may just be enough to help keep prices low.  As far as food is concerned, there is an all-you-can-eat buffet on the bottom level (coming right in from Tower City) priced around $25, or a food court two levels above. The décor was nothing too fancy (just a food court), but the selection was great. The three restaurants included Corky & Lenny's (deli), Rosie & Rocco's (\"fast Italian\" by Rocco Whalen, owner of Fahrenheit in Tremont) and B-Spot Burgers (Cleveland's own Iron Chef, Michael Symon). I enjoyed a delicious marinated tomato salad from Rosie & Rocco's, and noticed they had a wide array of ready-made upscale pizzas available for purchase. The food court may be a great place to stop in for a quick bite, even if you don't gamble!  Overall, good first run and a nice time had by all. Besides gambling, I imagine the casino will be a good place for the masses to mingle, drink and eat. Me, I'll be people watching and enjoying the sights :-)"}
{"text":"The interior design is beautiful and the proportions are slightly larger than life. Warning: the ATM fee is $6. The institution is well run and I thought that the service persons were all fairly professional."}
{"text":"I really liked the layout of this casino. There are a decent amount of table games and plenty of slots with a wide range of betting amounts. The food at the Spread buffet was pretty good. There are plenty of options to choose from. My only problem with the buffet was the workers. They would yell across the room to other workers and act very unprofessional. Luckily our waitress was very kind and attentive, but we were still surrounded by the workers yelling at each other. All I heard from them were complaints about working and just fooling around in general. I would never spend that much money again (although the food was good) to be surrounded by unprofessional and rude workers. I will be back again, but not for the buffet."}
{"text":"The dealers are sub-par, there are no comped drinks, and the place is rather small.  I don't buy the Ohio Law excuse for not comping drinks.  They could at least offer drink discounts to players who are gambling a lot, but then they would not make as much money.  I have not tried the food because it is quite expensive, yet I have not heard many good things."}
{"text":"My family and I visited Jack casino on a weekday night after a particularly bad day looking for a brief respite from real life.  When we entered, we were greeted by a casino that was NON-SMOKING. If you are a non-smoker who has never been to a casino before, I understand that you may have some difficulty understanding how wonderful this is, and it may not be due to casino rules but rather law, but it makes for a much more pleasant experience than your average casino.  I mainly played craps; notably, I came to the casino not expecting to win, but I had a wonderful experience nonetheless. The dealers were pleasant and lighthearted, and they dealt with any cranky players with a genuine smile.  The auxiliary staff at the casino was also helpful and pleasant, and I especially appreciated that new members receive a free t-shirt and a free bet at one of the tables.  Notably, when I was there, there was an issue with the computers that prevented parking validation, but this was dealt with in a graceful manner as well; they simply made parking free for all patrons, which I thought was a lovely gesture.  My only complaint about jack was that I would love to see 1 or 2 craps tables with a $5 minimum bet, particularly on a weekday night (I was in the casino from around 10 pm to 3 am), but this did not extremely negatively impact my experience.  The next time my family visits, we will absolutely visit Jack again."}
{"text":"I wish the Horseshoe Cleveland Casino buffet would change there salad bar to an actual salad bar with lots of toppings & dressings. Then it would be worth going."}
{"text":"They asked me to private email them regarding the buffet on 8/24, because they wanted to speak with me, I did do that, and here it is Wednesday the 30th, and still they never responded."}
{"text":"MAUREEN LOVES THE CASINO.   Yes, ^ just happened. Where can you go on your lunch break for a slice of quality pizza or a milkshake? The Casino. Where can you find the best people watching in CLE? The Casino. Where can you gamble on a Wizard of Oz machine, only to blow a $20 down the drain? The Casino. Where can a 30 something go and get carded like they are 21 at 11:30am? The Casino.   The next time you are downtown or in from out of town, you should pass through especially during the holidays. Grab a slice of pizza and join the resident gamblers for a play or two.  ***make sure you become friends with Diamond Club status members - drinks cost less and taste better."}
{"text":"THis place was alright, wasnt as good as i thought it would be we were only their for a short period of time..But it was cool..Packed..Not bad lost all my money in the judge judy game..ha ha ha i mean it was okay i guess.."}
{"text":"It was fine over here. For those of you complaining about not getting drinks, there is a button on the machines you can hit to call a server and they will come to you."}
{"text":"Rosie & Rocco's  Had the Cavatelli & meatballs.  Good size portion but the sauce needs work, no taste. Meatballs were good. Also had the Penne with chicken in a parmesan cream sauce. Again a good size portion, plenty of chicken pieces but the sauce was very bland.  Probably changing this sauce to an alfredo will give this dish what it needs."}
{"text":"This is the second time we have been here, if you are coming to play slots there are so many to choose from! The table attendants are rude, my fiance played two hands and decided to just play slots, but I guess you'll have that if they don't enjoy what they do. Only complaint I would have is the service to get a drink is SLOW I waited over 25 minutes at the bar near the blackjack tables, there were three bartenders and they did not have a rhyme or reason of how they went in order, one lady didn't circulate the bar, just stood on one side and kept serving those people, there was a male behind the bar, who kept saying he couldn't help us, he wasn't bartending, but he was behind the bar the whole time so what were you there for if you couldn't pour drinks? We will definitely go back, but just for the slots, not impressed with the tables or service this time! Also shoutout to Cleveland PD who was working that night, a young officer who had been on the force for three years stopped and talked to us and was very nice, and there was a drunk and disorderly woman in the bathroom, the officer who was in there arresting her was very patient and professional as well as the security guards from the casino who came to assist."}
{"text":"Proceed with caution: the lack of police/security presence and the abundance of pan handlers outside the casino creates a very uncomfortable and unsafe environment. The casino used to keep it under control. It's is very scary entering & exiting at night. I love the fact that I usually leave a winner. However, my safety is not worth the money."}
{"text":"Cold and depressing. I've been to a few casinos around the country, and this is by far the worst. Save your money and avoid at all costs."}
{"text":"Considering it is the first, and only, casino in downtown Cleveland, I am not going to grade Horseshoe too harshly. That being said, I think it's a standard casino that merits a only a once-a-month visit if you are not a gambling addict and are just looking for fun.  Things I like:  -24/7 Corky and Lenny's, best corned beef and swiss sandwiches ever -Close proximity to W.6th - just a walk away after bars close at 2:30 -Free parking (if you gamble...)  Things I don't like:  -$15 minimum on blackjack tables on most nights (c'mon it's Cleveland - there should be $10 tables available) -Mixed experience of dealers (at least at the blackjack table) -Mixed experience of pit bosses -Last call at 1:45 am (I know it's a city/state rule, but....)  Ideas for improvement:  -Nightclub in the casino to attract more people (not sure if there is room) -Needs to be events for a more social atmosphere, it seems dead a lot of the times"}
{"text":"This casino was crappy. Apparently you only get free NON alcoholic drinks while playing. Good way to keep people playing. Will not return."}
{"text":"We were here the night the Miami Heat were in town so we were expecting big crowds. It was busy but nothing crazy. For me it's just kinda hard to get all excited about a casino in Cleveland. It's very nice inside and I liked the layout but the whole time I was there I felt like something was missing. It didn't hit me till later that night what was missing. Typically in casinos you hear random screams when someone hits. Never once did I hear anyone getting excited. It was full of a bunch of depressed looking people throwing away their kids college fund. The other thing I noticed was the only place we noticed Cleveland Police was at the craps table watching the dope boys shoot dice.  We had fun, I won some money and we'll be back but it's just not what I expect out of a casino. I hope they build the new bigger and better one but I doubt thats actually going to happen."}
{"text":"Welcoming Atmosphere.  Better value for lunch, but still good.  an array of choices, ranging from Thanksgiving dinner to a taste of Italy.  Overrated Ham hocks   great dessert choices  come hungry though"}
{"text":"Being from out of the area I thought this place was pretty awesome! We took the RTA from our hotel right to the station and took an escalator up into the casino! So cool. It was poppin on a Saturday night and a lot of people were really drunk but I can't say I wasn't guilty. A lot of fun. Getting a cab out of this place was crazy hectic though."}
{"text":"Cleveland has a casino, and there was much rejoicing...well, I'm sure there are some people that are rejoicing, just not me so much. My wife and I paid the Horseshoe Casino a visit on a Sunday afternoon in November and it was OK. Let me start by offering some disclosure - We aren't big gamblers. We prefer to burn our money in a fireplace where we will at least provide us with the benefits of heat and ambiance. Don't get me wrong, we like playing some penny slots as much as the next guys, we just don't get into it.   My first impression was one of sadness. This magnificent building now transformed into a noisy den of one-armed bandits and felt-topped money takers. Now I'm way too young to have memories of Cleveland's old Higbee's department store, but as soon as I walked in I could feel the ghosts. They were everywhere.  I'm sad for the fading past of our great cities and the grandeur that they once held. I could feel the memories of this old building, the well-behaved (because parents were parents back then) children by their mother's side, her white-gloved hands clutching a purse as they walked through the store. I can only imagine how Higbee's would have looked this time of year right after WW 2, decked out in holiday dress, people not afraid to call it Christmas. I bet it was amazing.  So back to the casino, it's exactly what you'd expect. Three floors filled with a myriad of ways to separate you from your money and leave you with nothing to show for it. Hundreds upon hundreds of slot machines in every conceivable theme. I saw Iron Man, Lord of the Rings, dolphins, wizards, shrimp (there seems to be a lot of nautical themes for some reason) and your basic machines with cherries and bells. They are loud, really loud, but the seats are comfortable. They do want you to stay in the seats, so it makes sense.  There are table games like poker, craps, roulette, and blackjack. It doesn't smell like a casino as there is no smoking. I actually missed that smell. The smell of stale tobacco and broken dreams. I feel the same way about diners. Anyway, I'm getting so damn sentimental in my old age.  There are bars where you can drop $8 on a cocktail and a buffet (called the Spread) and food court on the second floor where you can eat away the depression that's starting to sink in once you realize you just blew $300 and that the ATMs in this place bend you over for $5 in service fees with every withdrawal. Food options include a fast-food version of Michael Symon's B Spot burger concept, some deli fare at Corky and Lenny's, and Rosie & Rocco's for light Italian. Not bad for a casino.  There are gobs of people, oodles of old ladies with visors and giant sunglasses and plenty of suspicious behavior. There are creepy guys that will sit next to you while you're at the slot machine and stare while you play. WTF? There are more guys that stand around and watch, casino voyeurs in their baggy pants and hoodies. I love being cased while I'm gambling. What's missing is a personal touch, friendliness or general human courtesy. Sure, the wandering cocktail waitresses feign politeness as they scurry by and the greeters by the entrances make smalltalk, but the general population is pretty oblivious. They don't care that you are there, they don't see you and the casino is for their use only. Get out of my damn way. Not specific to this place, just social commentary, really.  I guess as far as casinos go, Horseshoe is holding its own. It's not Vegas, so don't get your hopes up. It's still a casino in Cleveland. A step above Detroit? Maybe, still no free drinks while you gamble (free non-alcoholic beverages at the bars, though). I doubt we'll be back, just not our thing. Besides, it's a bummer. I still look at the old Higbee's building and weep for it. It's still beautiful on the outside but it's soul has been removed by the proton packs of the casino developers."}
{"text":"What a sad depressing place. At one point I wasn't even sure if I'd be allowed into the casino after the guy working the door spent forever going to town on my ID before finally handing it back and wishing me good luck.   I'm not against casinos. I really enjoy going to Vegas and playing craps, poker and sportsbook. This place doesn't do sports (which is a state rule I believe) and the minimums on craps are way too high, especially for Cleveland of all places. I'm not interested in dropping $10 per bet at 2pm on a random weekday. The poker room looked like the one redeeming corner of JACK, though I didn't have enough time to really play on my last visit.  Even if I was going to spend my money here, it looks like the rewards program is independent and not even affiliated with any properties in Vegas where I'd be able to redeem rewards. No thanks."}
{"text":"This is a decent casino and the payouts are good. The only complaint I have is that it's tough to get valet or parking when the cavs or Browns are playing. They really should look into purchasing more parking lots."}
{"text":"This casino went unbelievably downhill when it went to JACK.  It's as if no one at JACK observed how to properly run a casino when it was the Shoe. You'll need to be a good student in Calculus to try and figure out JACK's promotional kiosks.  I waited in line 25 minutes to get a simple parking validation.  The food at the buffet is horrible and employee attitude seems to be sour too.  Good luck in getting a drink if you are sitting at a slot machine.  I have been there three times since the changeover and it actually seems to be getting worse.  I will find other options for my gambling dollar."}
{"text":"The casino os really nice.  I came here for my 21st birthday and have been coming here since. Great atmosphere. Security is great. Food is ok too. I heard the buffet is excellent."}
{"text":"I went to Horseshoe Casino Friday of opening week. We arrived about 7pm - with an Indians game downtown and the Rite Aid Marathon the same weekend, I expected a line, but we walked right in. (Note: there was quite a line later in the evening, so for the first several weeks or on a game day, get there early!)  If you didn't know this space used to be Higbee's department store...well, you'd never guess. They stayed with a sort of art deco theme that really plays up some of the best features of that old space. I loved the crystal \"chandeliers\". :)  The space is bigger than I expected. Big enough to get lost in, especially on the second floor. Tons of slots - from what I saw, most are low wager (1 to 2 cents, minimum wager of 60 cents to $1.20). Seemed like the slots were pretty \"loose\" when we got there, but by the end I couldn't win to save my life. Tip: when you're up, collect your ticket and start over. :)  You can order drinks right from your slot machine via a touch screen menu. Sweet! Still have to pay cash, but drinks were very affordable - $3 for a glass of house Pinot grigio. The servers (and the staff in general) are super nice - when I gave one of the girls an extra tip because she had to go get change, she was floored.   Food court, with Rosie & Rocco's, BSpot, and Corky and Lenny's is on the second floor. The buffet - which is supposed to be stellar - is on the lower level. I didn't eat there on this visit...next time!  By the time I left around 11pm, the crowds were thick. Tables were crowded, and there were lines for some slots. If you want to play a certain game, get right behind the chairs and let others who approach know that you're waiting, or they'll cut right in front of you. Seriously.   The parking deck is free if you play for 30 minutes and have enough \"tier credits\" on your Total Rewards card. I had an issue with my card - my credits didn't save... I'll have to figure this out...luckily my BF's card didn't have the same issue, so this perk saved the $25 parking cost. You swipe your card in a kiosk in the casino or in the valet reception area of the garage. Tip: check your credits BEFORE you leave the casino. The parking staff can't help.   The parking deck was my only complaint. Again, this was a busy weekend in the CLE, but it took almost 90...yes, NINETY...minutes to get out of the deck from the 5th floor.  Overall, I will certainly return, after the crowds have died down a bit and the wounds to my \"fun money\" fund have healed. My next trip to Vegas will be to explore the area and see some shows instead of sitting in the casino. ;) I'm just thrilled to see downtown look like a \"real\" city, with folks walking around and enjoying an area that has been slowly, but steadily, coming back into good graces."}
{"text":"This is an absolutely average casino. First thing to comment on is this size - about equivalent to a strip mall, which is small. However, there are a decent amount of table game options (craps / blackjack etc.)  The locals say this place is hard to win at, but that's just degenerate gambler talk.   The dealers and pit bosses aren't even close to the same level as AC or Vegas.  The people in this place were a little shady. The worse bit about this place is that there are no free drinks when gambling. Crazy to pay $3-8 bucks for a drink when gambling. Also you can not tip in chips - that is some real BS."}
{"text":"I am not much of a gambler, but I stopped by this casino following a Cavs game and really enjoyed myself.  There is food, a nice bar, and a fair amount of tables and slot machines.  I love that there is no smoking in this casino!  I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Well im not really a gambler so i probably shouldn't have walked in the door, but my great Uncle was a buyer for Higbees and i have fond memories of the old Higbee store.  Sigh...so sad to see whats become of my old friend.  I did see where they tried to preserve some of the architecture.  And maybe if I were a gambler I would have appreciated it more.  Their staff was friendly and the place was packed and so they are definitely bringing people downtown."}
{"text":"No free drinks and then it was $15 to park.  Didn't feel fun, more like they were trying to get every nickel out of me."}
{"text":"I'm not from around here and I thought the casino was hard to find. The parking was a mess. But when I finally found it, it was very nice. It was a week night, but there was a live DJ and the crowd was not out of control. There is more than enough slots and tables to gamble at. The buffet was a little pricey, more than I expected, but it was excellent. Got to try a little bit of everything until I got stuffed. The desserts were somewhat disappointing, but I was full at that point anyway. All in all, I had a great time and walked away with some money in my pocket"}
{"text":"I don't really gamble but I had a bit too much fun here, possibly because my cousins and I had been drinking for a while beforehand and possibly because I actually came out ahead. I know that slots are completely random, but I always throw in $20 just to try some dumb luck, and actually ended up netting a few bucks.  the best part of the experience was the combination of cheap beers, drunk patrons, and a DJ pumping out the freshest in 90s hip-hop. talk about unbeatable people-watching!"}
{"text":"For starters, come here expecting to lose money. Casinos always advertise winnings, but for each jackpot winner you've got tens or hundreds of losers. The house ALWAYS has the edge.  Table minimums here are ridiculous. They start at $10 for most games. However, blackjack is where they get you. They advertise having $10 tables with 6:5 blackjack payout (which should be illegal), but most of their tables are $15 min or $25 min, way over what most people can afford. Blackjack here is hit on soft 17, double on any two cards, split up to three hands, and no surrender. Blackjack pays 3:2 on all non-$10 tables.  My biggest beef is the lack of free parking -- and the lack of parking, in general. During peak hours, mostly after sporting events or concerts, this place is packed. Every seat by a slot machine is filled and table game is full despite high table minimums. The only way around this is if you play for 30 minutes and you have a JACK Card, then parking is free.  Which brings me to my next point. JACK Rewards are a joke. Once they bought out Caesars' share in the joint, they created their own rewards program. What are the new rewards? Instead of possibly earning discounted rooms in Las Vegas, now one can get 10% off on select casino merchandise. Oh my God, who the hell cares? *said in Peter Griffin's voice*"}
{"text":"Horrible  Wish horseshoe was still here.  It takes 1000 pts to earn free parking.  Approx. $200 worth of spending just to earn free parking.  What a joke.  Horseshow you had to send about $60 to order to earn free parking.  This place will fade eventually, bad decision D. Gilbert, bad decision."}
{"text":"Visited August 2013  We ducked in here due to rain. We ended up playing some slots & had a fun time. It was very crowded but I'm sure it was partially because we went on a Friday night & it was raining. My husband ordered a drink & it was only $4...we were shocked!"}
{"text":"Playing the slots was good entertainment!  Although I didn't go home with extra money, I was able to play a long time before losing my $20.  No smoking environment was a great plus"}
{"text":"First review ever and I had such an awful experience, I feel obligated to say something. BE AWARE! When parking, the cost is $25 after 4pm.  I'm not going to join their club because I'm not a gambler and I don't live here. We were here for the Indians. We're originally from Ohio though. We wanted to see what had been done to the old Higbees. Maybe try some slots which we did. I felt sorry for the lady taking the parking money because she must hear some crap because of this ridiculous policy.  We arrived just before 4pm left at just after 5pm and WHAM! I was willing to pay the 6 bucks or whatever but $25?? Screw them and don't go. Ever.  Jim Stone, the parking manager I guess, was a total douche and could've handled it by taking my six bucks and realizing we might return someday. Uh, nope. Instead he threatens me with the Cleveland police.. Stay classy Cleveland."}
{"text":"Went there for New Year's Eve. Party favors such as hats and noise makers were advertised. However those were only given to vip guests. A dance party was advertised but in real life the dance party was in about a 10x10 area next to the bar. So that was garbage. The bar was very disorganized. A bartender took my drink order but a woman started yelling that she was there first... Which she was not. But the bartender made her drink before mine. My Long Island was mediocre. There was supposed to be a rap group there but We never saw them. Oh and there were only two scents we could smell all night. Either farts or weed. That's what the casino smelled like. We ended up leaving before midnight. Slots were fun. Stayed away from the tables. It would have been better if everything was as advertised."}
{"text":"Horseshoe Casino is the jam.  LOTS of single women pumping alimony into the slot machines, and weird people without limbs posted up up front of dumb games.  I like the ultimate texas hold Em table - i play a lot of Hold Em and so this is my spot. I wish the blinds were always at $5 though, it gets kind of pricey. Free coke, water and coffee, which is nice.   The layout is killer and very psychedelic. I would like to go there on acid or mushrooms and play the Wheel of Fortune slots because I think it'd laugh my head off.   Some of the servers are cute, others are really demented. It's funny to watch trust fund kids and drug dealers pull out a bunch of money when you sit down and then immediately lose it all in one swoop.  Recommended to go on a monday or Tuesday in the middle of the night (say 2 a.m.) alone for maximum ego damage and 'what am I doing in life?' effect."}
{"text":"This isn't your Vegas Strip Casino, nor is it intended to be.  So just have some realistic expectations and you should have a great time.  They have done a nice job of keeping the JACK Casino clean and safe since it opened.  It houses a fairly nice poker room on the top floor that has plenty of cash game and tournament options for all kinds of players.  The dealers are a good bunch and being Cleveland, they get to know the regulars pretty well.  There are plenty of TV's throughout the property to keep up with all kinds of sporting events etc.  The foodcourt isn't anything special but it has enough options for people who don't want to leave the casino and dine at one of the 20 amazing restaurants within a half mile radius of the casino.  Parking is made pretty simple with the attached parking garage the offers a walking bridge connecting to the casino.  If you do pretty much any gambling, you can have your parking stub validated.  This is a great, simple, entertainment option in downtown Cleveland and compliments the city very well."}
{"text":"Not properly staffed on big days in Cleveland, like Friday night home opener & St Pattys.  Show up and the placed is packed with people sitting at tables waiting for dealers, people willing to give their money to Cleveland but no one to take it."}
{"text":"Two-and-a-half years ago, I reviewed the MGM Grand Detroit in honor of Issue 3 allowing casinos in Ohio.  Now with Cleveland's casino finally open, it's time to see how our city stacks up.  Overall, I think Horseshoe Cleveland does the best it can with limited space and other restrictions and is a welcome improvement over many of the casinos in the region.  FOOD - In brief, the 2nd floor food court is overpriced:  $13 for a Corky & Lenny's corned beef sandwich, $9.50 for a Rosie & Rocco's sub with 3 rather plain, regular-sized meatballs, and $5.50 for a NY-style slice of pizza from the same.  Add to that the sparse available seating, and I wouldn't recommend the food court for workday lunchers looking for a place to sit down.  Don't expect Las Vegas quality and selection from The Spread buffet in the basement, but it's miles above Presque Isle's pathetic attempt, arguably better than Seneca Allegheny's Thunder Mountain Buffet, but not as impressive as Palette Dining Studio at MGM Grand Detroit.  The Sunday brunch ($22, including my iced tea) had the usual brunch buffet fare and was disappointing except for the bacon carving station and the Asian station with some decent fried rice, char su pork, and General Tso's chicken.  Dinner ($24) had the heaviest food, but again, nothing remarkable.  Like most buffets, you leave thinking about how much you ate rather than any particular item you had.  The exception may be lunch ($14), which offers a decent value.  Judging by the line to get in, many senior citizens of Cleveland agree, so expect to wait a bit unless you have a Diamond or Seven Stars Total Rewards card.  The lunch offerings were similar to, but a bit lighter, than dinner, with one of the stations offering sandwiches and wraps instead of entrées.  CASINO - Structurally, I love the first floor with the big columns and large chandeliers, all adding a touch of classic elegance rarely exhibited in casinos.  There are 6 craps tables with limits I've seen as low as $10 and as high as $50, usually settling on $25 at peak times and $15 off-peak.  All the craps tables offer the major benefit of 100x odds, though you won't usually see anyone putting more than double odds behind the line.  The tables are almost always full--the dealers need to start making room for those looking to play by moving the folks who are only spectating.  The first floor also has some carnival games--3 and 4 Card Poker, Mississippi Stud, and Ultimate Texas Hold 'Em--along with blackjack (Hit Soft 17), which were all at $15 limits during non-peak times.  The rest of the first floor is filled with plenty of 1¢ and 2¢ video slots.  I spotted 10 very popular Quick Hit penny slots and some traditional $1 slots with terribly low progressives of $2,500 and $1,000.  The less impressive second floor looks fairly ordinary by comparison and is packed with machines.  Again, lots of 1¢ and 2¢ slots, but also some Blazing 7's and similar variants with $2,500 progressives at 25¢ and $10,000 at $1.  8 25¢ Wheel of Fortune slots were very popular and continually occupied.  Video poker is on the second floor, though all pay schedules were under a 98% return.  There are tons of single-line VP machines:  25¢ 6-5 Bonus Poker (96.87% return), 20-12-10-4 Deuces Wild (97.58%), 8-5 Jacks or Better (97.30%), a row of 8-5 JoB Sequential Royal progressives (97.53%), 8-5 Double Double Bonus (96.79%), and $1 9-5 Triple Double Bonus (97.02%).  Multi-play VP is tucked into a corner:  5, 10, and 25¢ 6-5 JoB and Bonus Poker Super Times Pay (95.26% and 97.14%), 3 50-play 6-5 STP machines, as well as 2 popular 100 play STP and 3 Double STP machines that I couldn't get a look at.  Finally, the table games on the second floor mostly had limits at $25 with the addition of 2 mini-baccarat and 2 pai gow poker tables.  Blackjack is still \"Hit Soft 17\" except for the $100 tables in the high limit room that did not permit mid-shoe entry (though one dealer said the table could vote).  The high limit room also had slots ranging from $5 to $500, VP at $5 and $10, and 3 STP $1 machines.  I liked the fact that the high limit room had at least a little bit of daylight peeking through the closed curtains along the perimeter walls.  The top floor has a 30 table WSOP-branded poker room with games and waiting lists conveniently accessible via the Bravo Poker Live app.  The Diamond Lounge has some of the nicest furnishings I've seen among VIP rooms--better than the MGM Grand Detroit's Platinum lounge and even the Diamond lounge at Caesar's Palace.  Unfortunately, the lounge does not have its own bathrooms and, due to Ohio law, the bar inside still can't comp alcoholic drinks.  I've tried to cram a lot into 5,000 characters, but the bottom line is that I found Horseshoe Cleveland (pleasantly smoke-free, by the way) better than Presque Isle, Seneca Alleghany, and even MGM Grand Detroit.  I would still rank it below Harrah's New Orleans and the Atlantic City and Las Vegas casinos I've visited."}
{"text":"Big casino. Food selection isn't great. Tables were high $25min. There aren't any free incentives, like drinks. Drink prices were moderate $7 for a coffee with shot of patron xo cafe. Parking was free. Not sure why though because there was a parking attendant."}
{"text":"Busy!!!!  Went Friday night for something to do as downtown was ABLAZE with activity! The Rock Hall was on FIRE and so many people kicking Clevelands tires and it was a great night to be a Clevelander! The place was packed and we all just kind of found our way to what entertained us and had at it! I tend not to be a gambler but on a night like that it was just part of the fun! Yeah EVERYONE ROCKED!"}
{"text":"Tonight I saw a woman get sexually assaulted in front of security and they kicked the woman out. Mark L was in charge of security and he should be ashamed of himself. Horeshoe Casino is a joke. Don't go there unless you want to get  sexually assaulted."}
{"text":"I thought all casinos kinda cater to their customers, but not at Jack Casino in Cleveland, they don't want anything to do with hospitality.  These are the issues I have with this sh** hole Pay for parking Pay for drinks - if you can find a server Bad food Boring Atmosphere Rude staff Dealers cant count to 21!!  They took my bet when I had 21, that should never happen.  If I was the pit boss, that dealer would be using a calculator at the table every hand- Your'e fired! Simply put, this is just not an enjoyable casino and if you are looking for a good time in Cleveland, go somewhere else!  UPDATE: Jack Casino tried to reach out but there is no way to respond or private message them.  They have all if my contact info.  If i hear from them i will update"}
{"text":"Pros: -No smoking (driving out of state meant smoke filled casinos) -Won some money -Clean  Cons: -No food other than the buffet which I did not want to spend $25 for (dinner price)  I had a lot of fun :)"}
{"text":"Vegas in Cleveland?  Not exactly but it is a casino located in the heart of downtown Cleveland.  If you like Vegas, come here, you'll save on the airfare.  I've only been her once and I can see myself coming back again.  The waiters are old and beat, but whose there for that, all I want to do is play blackjack or hit up the slots.  Overall it's a pretty nice place considering how old the building they put the casino is.  There are many entrances into the casino, so if a line is full go around via the mall entrance.  So far I've yet to lose money.   Thanxs Dan Gilbert!"}
{"text":"First time brunching here, or going to the buffet in the casino at all. The only reason I give it four stars is because the seating and layout felt very crowded even though the lines for food were short and quick.  But the food was on point. The omelette station made REAL omelettes, with real eggs, not just liquid eggs with toppings folded into the middle. Prime rib was cooked to perfection and could be cut with a dull fork. There was also a spinning ice cream wheel with at least 12 flavor. Every single station was manned by someone who knew what they were doing, gave out great portions and was happy to serve. Also. 3 dollar mimosas! For about 23 bucks it's definitely worth it, just come hungry!"}
{"text":"Its shiny, new and not cheap place to drink.  Its still packed in the casino and kinda has a narrow feel when you walk in.  The dinner buffet is $25.00.  Not sure as they have different prices for different times of day.  Pretty sure a bottle of beer is $6.00.  I feel sorry for the cocktail servers as every person was complaining about drink prices then I saw these girls getting no tips.  They dont make the prices folks...TIP YOUR WAIT STAFF"}
{"text":"I think this is the worst casino I have been to.   1. Parking is a mess, I found a street parking. But some people may not want to do that. 2. It is cramped inside, very tight quarters with always someone walking by way too close. 3. High table limits expect $15 and bumped up to $25 during busy times 4. Part of 3, the players will run through the $25 as if it were $5, don't expect them to drop the limit with this trend. 5. Table games near entrance, not a fan. 6. Looks like a store that added a casino, worst decor I have seen. 7. If there is a game, it will be a zoo. 8. If Thistledown or Northfield gets table games, no one will come here for sure."}
{"text":"I did not gamble at this casino at all. I showed up just for the buffet! The food is nothing like what you would find in Las Vegas, but it is slightly better than most other casinos. The buffet has seven stations, including salad, Italian, American, Asian, shuffle (which switches from meal to meal), carving/rotisserie, and pastry. I would recommend stopping in for a bite."}
{"text":"DEPRESSING.  The downtown is pretty dismal in Cleveland.. This does nothing to add to the image/excitement, just a mediocre/below average casino.  Bunch of sad faces wasting money on low/no payout machines and tables."}
{"text":"Ohio's first casino! So here's the thing... if the horseshoe casino was in Vegas, it would probably be a 2.5 star. But compared to the Montreal casino, this place would be a 5 star. Compared to MGM in Detroit, I'd give it a 3 star. Therefore, I ended up with a 4 star.   I am pleased with Ohio's first casino. I expected this place to look dull and tacky on the inside,but they really did a good job making it all classy. So here's my full review:  Casino(3.5)-- the good is a tad small. It's about 2 floors tall and probably takes forever to even play at a table. I tried to get in on a Saturday and although the wait didn't seem to bad, we left because we didn't think it was worth it. Finally came back Sunday lunchtime and got in without a wait but it was just packed at every table. Slots were empty though! Overall though, this casino is built really classy and I'm definitely coming back to gamble soon!  Sunday brunch buffet (3.5)-- I recently went to the Montreal casino buffet and paid $26.. & it sucked. When I heard the Horseshoe casino Sunday brunch was also $26, i was expecting some really crappy food. But guess what? It's not bad! There's different sections-- Asian, Shuffle, Desserts, American, Italian, Salad, & Carvery. Here's what I think about each section:  Asian (3.5)-- The broccoli & beef was really delicious, so was the seaweed salad, stir fry noodles, cha su, and kimchi. Amazing huh? The Asian food was fairly authentic. However, i felt like it was missing stuff like spring rolls, dim sum food, and maybe sushi. The most disappointing part was one of the dish was General Tso's Chicken. C'MON horseshoe casino, REALLY?  Shuttle (4)-- this section features just random selection and it was surprisingly good! The pork and potato hash was great.   Desserts (4)-- So many selections! It was great! I wish there were more cakes though.   American (4)-- this was cool! They had small baskets of fries, some sliders, it was really pretty darn good.   Italian (3) -- I was at the italian area every second to eat as many mussels as my stomach could hold. Only upsetting part was there was only 1 pasta selection.   Salad/ Carvery- (4)-- Decent with many different selections!"}
{"text":"This casino almost makes me want to live in Cleveland.  I only came to play poker a few nights and I had a great time.  First of all, it's a solid $1/2 game as in it's not some stupid $1/2/2-4 game like they have in the Bay Area (people who have been to Bay 101 will know what I'm talking about).  Secondly, the non-alcoholic drinks are free (again, California sucks).  And third, the dealers and regulars were really nice and fun to hang with.  There was this one guy (Bob) who kept busting me up with his never-ending string of boats and flushes, but it was still a great time.  The casino was clean, it wasn't too crowded, and everyone was having a great time.  They have regular tournaments too.  Also, I randomly went to the buffet in the basement and it wasn't too bad.  The staff there was also really friendly.  Seriously, these people work in a buffet and probably don't get many tips, probably don't meet many nice people, and probably don't make a lot of money.  Yet, they're just lovely and helpful all the time.  I seriously miss the Midwest!    Well anyway, the Horseshoe is a great casino and hopefully it stays that way."}
{"text":"EH...Been here multiple times hoping the next would get better. Black Jack dealers are not friendly and tables are tight. Still a fun place to go before or after Cleveland events and as a escape of reality."}
{"text":"I guess Casinos are the new black.  I've frequented Atlantic City often when I lived in Philly.  And I've been to Vegas... and lost... and play poker at my friends house.  So I'm no expert on casinos.  But walking through here I would have never thought I was in the middle of Cleveland.  Plenty of tables and slots.  You will get carded at the door if you look under 30 which is kind of weird.  He asked to see my ID and I thought he was joking.  Oh well I'll take it! :P"}
{"text":"Mom and I were driving back to Detroit from Mentor, Ohio and decided to check out the Horseshoe casino.  I loved the lay-out of the casino and the selection of games.  Parking was very complicated and expensive but that could be because I didn't know how to navigate the complex city streets and where the best parking was.  We parked at the casino parking lot and had to pay $15.00 for about 90 minutes of gambling.  There was only one person taking the money to let people out so we rang up $ just waiting in line to get out of the parking structure.  Back to the good part...the actual casino.  I thought this was a fun place to play slots.  For the non-slot players there were plenty of tables to pony up to.  We did not eat here but the bottom floor had a buffet and coat check.  The top floor had non-buffet eating.  I think there were 3 floors to gamble on.  There was a very wide selection of games with a chance to play all the denominations.    We were only there 90 minutes but we had a chance to play a lot of slots and didn't lose too much $.  I would like to return but first I'd study the streets and figure where is the best place to park without being so aggravated and costing too much $."}
{"text":"I'm pretty happy with the Cleveland Hoseshoe.  My winning is only at about 50% on the slots, but I didn't really think I would break even across multiple visits, so it's a plus.  The slots and video poker games are great.  Everything is new and in great working order--no old clunkers or second hand games here.  There's also more than enough slots and video machines to meet the attendance demands.  The attendants are also great and very helpful.  My only complaint is that servers bringing drinks to slot players requires cash--they cannot take credit cards.  5/5 Stars for the slots.  The table games are actually plentiful given the size of the casino and the attendance levels (65 tables in all).   I've never had a problem getting a spot for any of the games.  There can be waits, on occasion, but nothing major to where you simply can't get in to play on a given day.  The dealers are all really great, too.  The casino did a great job training their folks to be knowledgeable, courteous, and exciting when the time calls for it.  What kills me are the reports that people haven't been tipping the dealers--if you win anything, tip your dealer at the end of the hand/play!!  I noticed some folks complaining that the buy in for a hand in some games is too high at $25.  Minimum bets vary depending on the time of day.  During the peak hours, $25 is fair and limits the playing to more serious people.  During the off hours, you can get a much lower buy-in.  But I don't think I would suggest playing a table game if the buy in of $25 seems too high--these games can get intense and the pot can grow quickly--you need to have more than just the buy in to play the games.  Even if you plan to play a $5, if $25 is all you have, get ready to lose that real quickly.  Gambling isn't a good idea if you don't have a good wad of cash to play for a decent amount of time, IMO.  The tables get 5/5.  The  poker rooms are something that I can't rate--it's just not my scene.  I've had a few friends play the poker rooms and they said the experience was great.  The rooms look to be quite popular and well run.  I think the bar is the biggest downfall of the casino--there's just really no good drink options.  The selection is just way too limited for the price and it's disappointing.  I can't go in there and enjoy a good Bourbon or Scotch while I play some games since they only have two whiskey options.  I'm not expecting to find 60 taps of beers and every vodka known to man, but I wouldn't mind being able to have even a few decent options from the bottom, middle, and top tier of alcohols.  With that said, the service is fine.  I give the service staff 5/5 with the alcohol scene a 2/5.  The buffet is good for a buffet, but I'm not a buffet fan.  As far as buffets go, looks good, has a ton of options, and it's not an arm and a leg.  It sometimes smells a little too institutional for me down there, but that's my only complaint.  The staff in the buffet are friendly and welcoming.  I'll give it a 4/5 since the staff is great.  The food court is ok, but it's just not enough.  Yeah, it's great that they put some Cleveland originals into their tiny food court, but it's all essentially fast food only done with good ingredients.  There's no good sit-down restaurant option.  Cleveland has a ton of great food, and I don't want the casino to detract from our amazing restaurants, but at the same time, it doesn't have to completely forgo a sit-down establishment that servers high end food.  Adding another great restaurant to the scene isn't going to shut down East 4th, for example.   I give the food court 3/5 only because it's just not enough.  The food itself is fine.  Overall, I like this place, but it I also have to complain about how it just doesn't feel like its part of the city.  When I go to other casinos, I can get spa treatment, fancy food, maybe catch a show, etc...  This place is just gambling and some food/drinks.  That's fine, since Cleveland has plenty of downtown options--it's not like going to a casino in the middle of nowhere that absolutely must provide frills to keep people happy.  However, I think there's a lot of opportunity for the casino to partner up with the playhouse, local restaurants, and other retail stores in the vicinity as a means to grow business and help casino visitors experience all the great casino frills through Cleveland's local businesses."}
{"text":"A very pleasant casino with a great mix of table games and slots...and you can't beat having it right here in downtown! The buffet is good, if pretty standard for a casino and drinks are perhaps a little bit more than I'm used to at casinos, but well poured, and the bar upstairs is quite ornate. Employees are all polite and professional; not the normal gruffness I found in Vegas or Atlantic City.  Altogether, a great surprise to find in down town Cleveland now."}
{"text":"It's cool as far as casino's go... parking across the street unless you want to pay $12-15 for valet. They have a craps area which was definitely the place to be. It's smoke free,,, which is great for all of us that do not smoke. Drinks were a little pricey for a casino, other than that- a good time."}
{"text":"Just not any fun! Went on a Wednesday and on the bus And could not wait to leave.Did not hit anything!"}
{"text":"Probably one of the worst casinos I have been to. When the dealer says \" this is just like yesterday, everyone was losing\" you know to never come back."}
{"text":"I worked on the campaign to bring the casino's to Ohio, so I feel a part of personal pride with the Horseshoe. I think it is a great set up with plenty of tables and slots for all. The poker room is outstanding. The food selection is great. I feel the comps are appropriate.   The only thing that I still just cannot get over is the table mins. And everyone who goes there says the same thing, and the casino has no reason to change it. People still play at those mins. But you are pushing out the small fish who just want to get some entertainment for a couple hours. On a Sunday morning, the craps min was $15!! Get out of here! I would never see anything that high on the Vegas Strip on a Saturday night, let alone a Sunday morning?  I am really hoping that when Phase II is completed, there will be high min tables and low min tables.  Also, I am really hoping to get into a World Series of Poker Tournament in Cleveland! I was really disappointed when it was canceled due to the legal issues. That will be a great event."}
{"text":"For the three months of the year that we call summer, Lake Erie, the Metroparks and restaurant patios are the place to be. But what do you do for the other nine months when you have to drag an umbrella, parka, and ice scraper around at all times? You go to the casino.  The casino will keep you warm and happy no matter what season it is, but it really is a great place to go when the sun is no longer shining on our little town. It's full of games, restaurants, bars and most importantly, fun!  I love to play Craps and I can always manage to squeeze onto a table. Whether that's because I am more petite or more pushy is up for debate. I know enough about Craps to get me by, but the dealers (is that what they're called if they aren't dealing cards?) always guide me when I am not sure of the rules.  If you are going to eat here, I would 100% recommend the buffet. The food court is okay for something quick, but the quality and selection are both better at the buffet. They have to have at least 8 different food stations, each offering 10 or more dishes each. And I'm pretty sure there are at least 10 flavors of gelato, too. I didn't even get that far because I was so stuffed from my first few plates.  One thing I will recommend to those who want to avoid losing TOO much money (though, it is inevitable on those terrible, bad luck nights). During the week and weekends before 8 or 9pm, the minimums are usually lower (around $10). After 9pm on weekends and I would imagine also on big event nights (sports games, concerts, etc), the minimums are probably going to be higher. So plan wisely!  Don't forget to get a rewards card, too. Depending on how much you play, you may get some vouchers redeemable for cash to play with at the casino!"}
{"text":"Terrible casino, and the other reviews are correct:  it's only gotten worse since it was re-branded. At night, the casino area still feels sketchy and isn't well lit (especially to the northwest) despite the renovation of Public Square.  This is a BIG problem because the JACK re-brand changed the free parking requirements:  you must now spend the equivalent of $333 or gamble for a minimum of one hour at a table in order to receive free parking in the attached garage. (I finally got an employee to admit that it takes 1,000 points and that you earn 3 points for every dollar lost.)  There is very infrequent cocktail service to the tables and other games.  The clientele can be awful on nights without other downtown events - homeless people frequent the bars for free soda and hot chocolate.  They do have cover bands and djs on weekends, which is festive.  The dealers and servers aren't the best, but they are trying for good customer service whilst management is clearly not.  Anytime someone is indifferent or rude at this place, it is inevitably a supervisor. I think the table minimums are often too high for the market, but that's the casino's prerogative.  For out-of-towners, you should know that Ohio does not permit smoking in the casino nor can the casino give away free alcohol."}
{"text":"Yeah, weird place in a way. Not bad, but it is ok. First time here today and really wasn't impressed. Seemed like everything was old and that they used an old building and turned it into a casino. We walked across the street from the parking garage and found the casino. The signs leading you to the casino were a little confusing when you get off the elevators at the garage. We had to stop and ask a couple that were passing through of where to go. We had to leave the garage, go outside and cross the street to the casino.   Overall I've experienced better. Yeah, I know its not fair given that I've been to many other local casinos and Vegas to compare this place to. To me it seemed like the place was very dark and gloomy. Nothing too exciting."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times, for things other than gambling. I don't gamble so a casino visit is kind of counter intuitive! As non-Las Vegas casinos go, this one is pretty nice! Fairly upscale but not over the top like Las Vegas. I've tried a few of the food venues like B-Spot. See my other reviews for that. I won't review the gambling experience because I have never gambled here. Drinks are reasonably priced for a casino and for the ones I've tried, they were good! I accidentally broke a glass in the lounge and they were quite attentive to get it cleaned up quickly. The staff I've interacted with have all been very friendly. Also, as a non-smoker, I appreciate not smelling smoke anywhere I went."}
{"text":"This place was great, bigger and mlre eventful than the one in cincinnati. Upon returning home, I had returning coupoms for free play amd points"}
{"text":"The customer service is so lacking here. They have this card you are suppose to use but I've used it, with thousands of dollars and have brought many people here and haven't gotten a thing. I didn't need anything, the casino pushed me to get it! Total waste of time.  I stopped using it, what's the point.  When it first opened some coupons but nothing now. Annoying. Couldn't even get a room one night, late.  Most of the dealers are good, the drinks can take awhile if you are at the card tables. The bartenders on both floors (first and second) are good, fast.  Don't eat the food on the second floor restaurants, even the pizza is bad! I want to say good things and like it, I hope with the new management they step it up."}
{"text":"This casino is disgusting. Looks dirty, was crowded and didn't have a huge selection of games. The parking lot is also a disaster. The casino is also attached to the rattiest excuse for a shopping mall I've ever seen in my life."}
{"text":"First I should start out saying that I used to go here when it was still a Horseshoe casino and liked it much better. The casino is clean and non-smoking. The bartenders at the video poker bar are more concerned about themselves than customers. I sat with my fiancé for over 2 hours and sat with an empty drink for the majority of the time. The bartenders were telling each other stories from across the bar instead of interacting with guests, and refilling drinks or at least asking if we would like another. I think the players club could be better as they don't offer as much free play or comps which would be fine if the slots were not so tight. I usually play video poker and slots and have been here multiple times with multiple people and every time we usually don't win anything at all. I think this casino could be much better with better dining options and offering more with the players club. My fiancé go to Las Vegas at least twice a year and have better luck on the strip than here. In addition, we prefer MGM Grand Detroit to the JACK."}
{"text":"3.5 not a 4, but better than 3 :)   I have only been to the Horseshoe Buffet twice, once for lunch once for dinner.  First time I was treated to a weekday lunch.  I was pleasantly surprise at the buffets scale (this ain't no China Buffet here!)   I have never been to Vegas or any other casino buffet so I have no baseline for comparison, but trust me, its pretty long !!  Actually a bit too long for its own good as both times I sat at one extreme end, and its a hike to walk the length. This might not necessarily be a bad thing as you can eat, AND walk it off all in one trip :)  The lunch selection is supposed to be less than the dinner, I didn't even notice, it was overwhelming both times.     The lunch is far less expensive than a dinner @$24.  we went around 7:30-8 pm on Sat night.  We were seated right away, but not before being snapped at by the buffet police who I suppose was directing traffic in the hallway?   There are two lines, one apparently is for \"through traffic\"  the other is for the buffet wait line until they can seat you.   Come on people, even the BMV has a sign so you know where to stand (or not stand)  put one up, and I'll stand there.      The food selection is gut busting, you'll need to walk the line a couple of times to evaluate what you want more ....the prime rib, or turkey with gravy and stuffing ...I had the prime rib ....very good with excellent selection of temperature (done-ness)  I like my meat slightly red and it was dead on perfect. There were some ends, and I sure wish I could have sank my teeth in those, but too salty for me but . I also had some shrimp, with fried rice and chicken, very good. The other half said the beans were good (she's a bean critic)  other than that, I didn't hear much from her aside from one slight comment, \"if this thing had sushi, it would be perfect\"   And I agree, but of course it would have to be good sushi !!    There are MANY selections, from salads to Asian, from pizza to ice-cream ... and the overall experience was nice,a bit much for a buffet ( based on dinner cost)  the food overall was good but not as hot as I would have liked it . I'm not sure if it was the due to the travel time  to walk the full length of the line, or low temp of the food to begin with ?   Parking is the downtown killer  for me though ...we lucked out and found a street spot, but if I had to pay $25 to park, I doubt if I would go back.  I'm not gambler so getting parking perks is out.  I can't understand how hard cities work to get you to come into the city, then make it as hard and expesive to park when you actually go there?? !!    After the power-chow we walked around a bit to look at the casino. Its dressed up real nice for the holidays and is very clean and most employees are friendly and helpful.  We strolled into the high-roller wing just in time to see a guy pushing hundreds into the $100 a pull slot machine !!   100 ...200....300....as his VERY angry wife looked on while loudly voicing her disdain for him. We hung around long enough to see a few more hundred  slip through his fingers almost like they were evaporating.   (he left shortly afterward)    NO KIDS ...its a CASINO"}
{"text":"My sediments are the same are the ones that are most recent. Had a poor experience on a Friday night. Rude servers and talking to someone about it is an absolute waste of time. Much friendlier atmosphere at Northfield and it is closer for me so just chalking it up to a bad experience and lesson learned not to visit there in the future.  I also notice NONE of the folks that gave the poor rating to the casino have replied back to say that they were appeased when they were asked to contact the JACK casino so they can address the matter. I'm don't expect all of them to do that but you would think at least 1 person would if the casino was making a sincere effort at trying to fix these things. I know I saw on Facebook someone called and made a token gesture but according to them the person from JACK was just going through the motions like it is a routine incident for them. That right there tells me as others said they don't care about the players it ONLY about the money!!"}
{"text":"I really appreciated the service from the friendly staff.  The dealer at my table was gracious and humorous. Typically, casino staff don't give me a second glance because I'm a young adult. I genuinely appreciated that the staff here didn't subconsciously undermine me because of my age.   The decor was also very beautiful- the chandeliers were stunning. It was a very glamorous casino in my book. By no means is this my first casino visit, but Horseshoe Casino really wow'ed me over.  UPDATE: I am impressed that the manager of the casino keeps up with the yelp reviews that they receive (and settling negative reviews/increasing customer satisfaction). Just updated their rating to 5/5! :)"}
{"text":"We will never visit this establishment again. Every time my husband comes here he never gets his parking pass and has to go to promotions to get it. We went there today and we thought \"Lou\" was going to help us and fix the problem but she just called us later to tell us the same thing that the original person told us that we were playing for 17 minutes. My husband was playing the electronics craps game for 2 1/2 hours with his card in the whole time.  He would've got a parking pass no matter the minutes of play because he got well over the points he needed he needed to get a parking pass (250 points )because he is an \"A\" member. I asked Lou who to talk to because it was not right (what she was saying about what she saw on the computer) and she hung up the phone. I told the man at promotions counter to check the video feed from security to see that we were there playing and  also told \"Lou\" that on the phone. Although we still received the parking pass it is the principle that they were assholes and we will never go there again! We will go to West Virginia, Pennsylvania, and Vegas more often."}
{"text":"This was the first casino I've been to and I love it. It's always crowded, but very clean. The architecture of the building and its decor is so pretty; also, the arrangement of the slot machines and tables was very well thought out. I really like the atmosphere of the bars and how fast you're waited on by the servers if you order from a slot machine. The whole staff is very personable. I love downtown Cleveland in general, and I think this casino adds a nice touch."}
{"text":"I live less than a mile from this place and just checked it out for the second time since it opened.  Now Im not a gambler so I judge casinos on drink comps and the freaks I get to watch gambling.  This casino is pretty laid out..still kinda looks like the old Higbees (I used to do all my Xmas shopping here as a kid).  Different floors with lots of gaming tables and one armed bandits!  I always seem to hit the same bar.  Prices this time were 5 bux for a bottle of Millerz.  Last time (on a weekday) it was cheaper.  I played a few slots and tried roulette for a few spins too.  Literally pissed away 35 bux in 15 seconds..lol.   Id rather get me a 40 and a happy ending massage with that kinda scratch!  ;)  But anyways..sign up for that rewards thingy..they already emailed me a code for free plays!  And im by no means a bawla!  I recomend getting a good buzz on in the back of a seedy El Camino and check this place out...maybe gamble a bit and soak up all the freak, zombie gambling types.  Fanny pack and wolf sweater optional..."}
{"text":"I'm so happy that Cleveland has this casino. What a great way to increase traffic downtown! This review is mostly about the AMAZING buffet we had. They do have a food court but I highly recommend trying the buffet. It was beyond my expectations. They had anything and everything you could imagine and it was all delicious. I didn't dislike one thing that I tried.  My favorite was the Asian station, the pierogies and the desserts were delish! I thought this buffet was better than the buffet I had in the Vegas at the Bellagio which says a lot. Hands down 5 star cuisine!   Overall, I think the casino is nice but it's nothing exceptional. They do have a lot of slots and table games but I think the minimum bets are way too high. Especially when you visit on a week day. They should only have a high minimum during the weekends. Whether you gamble or not, definitely check out the Casino's buffet. And come hungry!"}
{"text":"Had fun at the casino.  Check your bar ware . I was served wine in a dirty glass.  Yuk."}
{"text":"LADIES GAME SHOW EVENT Sunday Feb.12 2017: Had a wonderful time.This was the most fun I've had in a long time.Everybody was laughing and having fun. The host Mike,did an awesome job.Just wanted to say THANK YOU!!!  I also want to thank Malea, for being so kind and helpful."}
{"text":"\"Cleveland gambling\" sure why not the city gambled for years with Dennis Kucinich (the most tumultuous in Cleveland's history) Give it a few months for the casino to work out all the kinks and I say why not- give it a whirl.  I think I saw bones thugs and harmony at the $100 min crap tables.  Parking could be comped but the line for a club card was ridiculous, the icard must of been produced by Apple.   An ample amount of tables and slots, but some out of service  I hung out in the \"High Limit\" room only 5 people could keep up with me, the drinks were strong.  I was up 14k and living life,  I was having too much fun to quit and not only did I lose 2k I lost my left christian louboutin red bottom shoe.  Dan Gilbert if you find it just display it on the wall next time I come back I will autograph it.  ATM fee's are $4.99- really!  the Chicago Airport has fee's for $1.50 (yes I use a ton of cash) I don't like being tracked. Well only on yelp!  the decor- well it's Cleveland Gaudy and 10 years set back from the rest of the World...Mi Mi from \"Drew Carrey Show\" must of been the interior decorator.  I was pissed they covered those amazing marble floors and wooden escalators from Higgbee's   would I go back,  effin ey I would....shot calling big ballin!"}
{"text":"Had a great time with my wife there. Got a free tshirts , free $13 to start and won $95 my 8th spin. No smoking made it tons better than a crappy Indian casino. I wish we had one at home. Maybe not the biggest, but I love it there. If you are in Cleveland, check them out!!!!"}
{"text":"I had such a great time at the casino, that I nearly forgot I was standing in an old department store.  All of you younger gamblers will not have that problem!  ;-)   The casino is very clean, and the service is great everywhere. The best part is No Smoking! You don't get that smoky smell all over your clothes like in a Vegas casino. I don't gamble much, but when I do- I am a blackjack kind of girl. Once I found the dealer I liked best, that was my gig for the night. A little action on the $25/hand table, and I won a nice little bit of loot, too! We'll definitely go back the next time we are in the mood for a fun night at the casino."}
{"text":"The worst.Very limited selection,overpriced at 25 bucks per person.The turkey was so dry,you couldn't even bite into it,not edible.Taco bar..no meat.Questionable meat in the Chinese food,so I skipped that.The roast had a ton of fat,and was also dry.So since there wasn't really anything,I went back to the Italian section as a last resort,the pasta was hard and dried out,the soups were bean with ham and clam chowder,no vegetarian option.everything was lukewarm to just plain cold.the dessert bar looked awesome.That was an illusion,cakes decorated to be gourmet,were the similar to tastycake,dry,sugary,not good.The cheesecake was like any cheap buffet cheesecake,like that Jello no bake.20 min after we left,I turned ghost white,and the room started spinning.I had to leave..too early,and had to pay another 25 bucks for parking! I was sick all night.I called to let them know the following day,they seemed unimpressed,said thanks and hung up...very unprofessional..."}
{"text":"The atmosphere at this casino was great and if you play for 30 minutes the $35 parking is free.  It was the first time that I had played virtual blackjack and I really like it.  The staff was very helpful and friendly nor did we run into any smoking on the premises.  I am not sure if smoking is allowed, but glad we didn't run into it.  The casino is place right across the street from the basketball court and down the street from the ballpark, which is why we were in town.  If you are in Cleveland then I would recommend stopping by for a little gaming."}
{"text":"Been here twice, once with grandma~ the selections were ok at that time. The salad bar I like it a lot. Fresh and lots of choices."}
{"text":"Came to the casino for lunch. Yes, lunch, not gamble. They have a buffet in there that is so amazing! There are so many options. If you have the casino member card, the price for the food is half off. The place is clean, food is always coming out and being replaced, staff is friendly and awesome. I wasn't feeling well that day but was excited to finally eat there. I got 2 plates of food. I only took a pic of the second plate. I had a craving for fried chicken. And they even had asparagus. I LOVE asparagus. The chicken was cooked perfect. Not dry, juicy and the breeding was amazing. Not really greasy either. My other plate had mashed potatoes as well as some Asian chicken and rice. It cost about $10 or $11 dollars and then the drink. I usually drink water. There are tons of places to sit. And if you walk away hungry from there then something is wrong! Totally not like all buffets I've ever been to! Fluffy people seating friendly!!"}
{"text":"Bad security and customer service. I played the mechanical Roulette game, put $ on black and 13 and after the hit it showed me the win and then went in error mode. Customer service said the bet was cancelled because of the error? The floor manager stated it must have went into error before the bet won but thats 100% not the case the ball dropped and showed me my win and before the money slid my way that's when the error hit. I'm guessing if I lost it would have took my money. I had plans to come up over the weekend with friends but after being treated like a idiot I'd say that's not happening."}
{"text":"After one trip I thought my bad experience was a fluke, but multiple trips later and it has become a trend  1) incorrect payouts. Pay close attention, as multiple times at the Craps table, I had to stop and point out I was short changed on a bet  2) 4 out of 5 dealers are not talkative/rude/condescending. Some love taking your money, others love pointing out the second you pick up the cards a moment early. Just overall not friendly  3) lots of people loitering about. To the point of not feeling safe with a large amount of money   4) tons of fine print. I swear my free bet said stays on the table until it lost, but after one win, off it goes!"}
{"text":"I'm not a big gambler, unfortunately. I've been here for events and random late night hang outs with friends. Oh, and a bachelorette party. Every time it isn't amazing, but it also isn't horrible. Just MEH! What I do appreciate is the staff. Very friendly and helpful. Even the dealers are entertaining and social, which is great for a hover-er like me. I'm always the one just watching... Never playing!"}
{"text":"It's a nice casino lots of good games lots of tables good food lots of security inside need more outside lots of people always asking for money but it's a good place to go just go with some one else or a group so gooooooo win some money  and have some fun"}
{"text":"It's a beautiful casino with very, very, very tight slots. Unfortunately, every casino in Cleveland is tight! Save your money and go to Vegas!!"}
{"text":"I am shocked at all these bad reviews, I was in Cleveland this weekend for a wedding and couldn't wait to hit up the Casino.  I love Vegas and love a casino wherever I can find one.  I was pleasantly surprised at how large the casino was, brightly lit, little restaurants, tons of machines.  I wish I would have been able to go back Sunday before we left for home, what a fun place with live music upstairs.  If I ever make it back to Cleveland I will be here."}
{"text":"No. No. No.   I've been to many different casinos (even the small town ones) and this place just doesn't even measure up.   No free drinks when you play... That's a first. Lol  Service here- don't even expect much....  Only went to visit a friend in Ohio and wanted to stop by... Never coming back.  Only lost 2 bills but losing it here just made it worse!"}
{"text":"Nicest of Cleveland Casinos, in classic Higbees Dept store building Very good buffet. Only complaint is they cater to high rollers ie wait for J & A cardholders is half hour, while C& K cardholders is immediate"}
{"text":"We bet it all on red.  And lost. Bad luck aside, this Horseshoe is clean, lively, and centrally-located."}
{"text":"I thought this casino was great. They have a plethora of slots including my favorite...CLUE! We didn't play tables because they were rather crowded. We went after an Indian's game so it was PACKED. They offer a parking deal where if you gamble for 30 minutes and spend approximately $75 parking is free. You must be a member of the players club. There was a line to join so I recommend doing it before the game. I thought it was fabulous that they are a smoke free casino. Love it!!! The employees were all very friendly and they kept it classy. We will be back!"}
{"text":"I wish I had wrote a good review for the Horseshoe before now because when I 1st went there it was nice and clean and the workers were nice. Now it seemed like the staff is gone. The Bathrooms were so clean but now they are down filthy."}
{"text":"This buffet is awful!  When it was the Horseshoe everything was fresh and they had mussels a crab legs.   Tonight thing had been sitting to long, potatoes were hard and corn on the cob was fit for feeding livestock!  Terrible, terrible!"}
{"text":"We were at this casino when it was the Horseshoe and when we came back to see what it was like as the JACK casino, there wasn't much difference but they got rid of a good amount of slots and replaced them with the themed slots. They added more card tables which is always nice, especially lower priced black jack which I've always been a fan of. They did some minor changes to make it run more smoothly which I think it is working, but for some reason it just didn't have the same vibe. There was no band like every weekend the Horseshoe had and there was no real decorations or anything that made it feel like you were at the old Higbees. Overall, it's a good casino, just nothing super special."}
{"text":"I'm not really a gambler, so I was forced to come here against my will by my family who loves to gamble whenever we're in Ohio. I parked it at one of the bars and enjoyed $5 cocktails during happy hour (Sunday - Thursday from 4-7 pm), which I quite enjoyed. The bartender was very concerned with making sure I had fun and recommended a number of places nearby that one can go and see if you have friends/family who are into gambling."}
{"text":"The poker room was fun.  Took about 15 minutes to get on a table.  Laid back atmosphere.  It was my first time playing no-limit at a casino.  I was a bit nervous but the staff and dealers were cool and the nerves quickly turned to aggravation because of my decidedly mediocre play.  My bad.  The waitresses were quick to take orders I almost forgot to mention."}
{"text":"Visited while on a trip to Cleveland and I really love casinos, but my first impression was not the greatest.  I felt that the players club desk staff was extremely rude and reluctant to answer my questions.  I have never been treated like that before, and finally found a young lady to answer my questions after getting snubbed by two previous employees at the desk!  They did have a good selection of machines and I did get some good play time in, drink service was quick and easy through the machines.  The bathrooms were very difficult to locate and not very well attended to.  They were pretty dirty."}
{"text":"One of the nicest urban casinos of ever been to.   It has over 64 tables and 30 poker tables and 2000 slot machines  Are usually play poker and didn't have to wait too long for a table.  One drawback is the highest limit they spread was 2/5no limit  The staff was very friendly especially a slot attendant named Diana and a host name Eric."}
{"text":"As someone that has been to Vegas a few times, I really wasn't expecting much out of a Cleveland casino.  When I stepped in, I felt like I was across the country in LV.  I didn't gamble here as I was feeling cheap, but did spectate.  The dealers were all very professional and the drinks were well priced.  $3 for a beer is not too shabby!"}
{"text":"Parking is a lot of money and the spaces are tiny.  Slots are new and top-notch.  Too few table games, minimum bet I saw was $25 for blackjack, which is ridiculous for this city.  Food court looked goofy.  However, the decor impressed me greatly as being unusually tasteful and not obnoxious."}
{"text":"It was alright I suppose but was my least enjoyable casino experience I've ever had so far.  Staff were curt at best and nothing really stood out to me as being memorable here besides that which isn't good.  The place was clean and modern looking which was nice though.  I wouldn't avoid it in the future but I'm not likely to go out of my way to return either."}
{"text":"Be aware of their weekend parking rate.  If you don't have rewards they charge you $25.00 and we were only there for an hour.  Yikes!"}
{"text":"They did a great job on this casino. It looks upscale and everyone, from the doorman to the guy who gave us our loyalty card, was super nice.     I usually go to presque Isle and rivers edge casino about once a month, but this casino did a better job.  The machines are newer and the environment is completely smoke free!  New game banks were being added even a month after they opened. We didn't have any trouble being able to find a game to play.  My only disappointment was that there was no HOT HOT Penny games!  I usually make bank on those!   I can't tell you how happy I was to see downtown Cleveland bustling on a weekday evening.    Food: There is a huge buffet, food cafe's, and of course, downtown Cleveland."}
{"text":"For a small casino, this Horseshoe is pretty nice. Most of the staff are friendly and helpful. The little food court they have has some really good food like Corky & Lenny's and B-Spot that gets comped after you lose a bunch of money. The buffet isn't bad either. I just found out I can get comped for my favorite Vietnamese restaurant half a block away... Saigon. There's also unannounced drink specials that I like to take advantage of. I hang out here about five nights a week and it's a cool place to be social and watch sports. The upstairs bar, TAG, is fun for the sports fanatics. There's also an Asian area for all the Baccarat and Pai Gow Poker players."}
{"text":"Top reporting revenue casino, Worst player rewards and Comping? I'm confused!   Horrible rewards and pit-bosses! It's ashamed that I live in Cleveland but drive to Toledo because the 90 minute drive is worth choosing Hollywood over horseshoe. In the poker room I have had hands ruined by incompetent dealers who showed cards prematurely. Mistakes happen but it's the way they are managed that gets me. The floor was called on several of these occasions but they don't do anything about it. The red haired guy asked my opponent on one of the scenarios if he would've called my bet before the river card was prematurely showed. He said yes, of course he said yes with his pocket pair that was lower than the board. Why would he say no and lose his $500 that he won from the river giving him a set to beat my pocket Aces! Good Job, red-haired man, whatever your name is!  Other than just the instances in the poker room there are many other reasons I choose Hollywood over horseshoe! Free parking at Hollywood but most importantly you are treated like a top dog when you play table games! Horseshoe never comps me or rewards me. $15 free play? lolol Good job Horseshoe but Hollywood blows you out of the water! You're petty rewards are an insult to how much I bet. Four $15 free plays  from Horseshoe or five $100 free plays and four $100 Shell Gas cards all in one month. Plus I never pay for a meal up there. Why would I choose Horseshoe ever again? They bring in the most revenue in every monthly report but give out the least to their players. Insulting! No Thanks! See my review of Hollywood Casino if you want to be treated the way you should!  If I have a reason to throw a few extra stars on this review I will update it but I doubt that happens since I haven't been there in over a year since I started driving to Toledo and Horseshoe has completely stopped sending me rewards or even post card  announcements or any mail of any sort for that matter to even attempt to get me back. I went from Platinum to Gold at the Shoe but I am on the 3rd tier of Hollywood's reward program. I'll get a free cruise soon :)"}
{"text":"In the 7 or so months since it became Jack concern I have probably gambles a total of $50 here. i come strickly for the buffet.   Simply put, it is amazing. You can get it for 8$ for Lunch and $15 for Brunch/Dinner w/ their lowest level Loyalty card. I like to think of the buffet like this: Golden Corral except very very high quality and with even more variety. I mean that in the best way possible.  Food is fresh, unique, and wide in variety. The corn beef has at brunch has large chunks of actual corned beef, so much better than the canned crap I'm used to.  Speaking of Brunch, it's almost the same as their dinner/lunch, but it has breakfast options. High marks for the Biscuits and gravy.   Overall, this is the best buffet of any kind in the whole of Cleveland. Well worth the trip downtown."}
{"text":"I've gone in this casino probably a dozen times since it opened, but after yesterday I won't ever return.  The Good: the inside is quite beautiful -- an homage to Higbees.  Their grand-opening celebration consisted of huge fan-fare.  Be sure to check out their digital projection show on the exterior of the building at their grand-opening on YouTube!  The Bad:  Almost no pay-outs on the machines.   Rude security, which unfortunately is the first thing you encounter upon entering.   They are not much for pleasant greetings, which of course would be the exact opposite of what an entertainment complex is designed for.   Last night I had a Cleveland Police officer throw me out for holding my umbrella under my arm as I showed my ID to the check-in officer.  She claimed that I almost hit her because of the way I had it under my arm.  I told her that I was merely trying to take my ID from my wallet to present to the office, but she continued to yell at me for not paying attention and demanded that I put the tip to the ground as I continued to wait for my ID to be returned to me.  To make a long story short, I asked her how I was supposed to hold my umbrella and access my wallet and ID with one hand.  She threw me out!!  The Casino is wondering why its business has diminished every month since its opening.  How about harassing police officers that have nothing better to do than stand at the entrance and protect the world from dangerous umbrellas!"}
{"text":"How can a large business with such a high revenue intake NOT have wheelchairs for their handicapped patrons? A standard wheelchair costs roughly 80-120.00 dollars per chair. You can literally get them from Wal Mart. When we asked if we could please have a wheelchair to use, we were told they were short on wheelchairs that evening and had none to loan. On a slow Thursday night? What happens during the busy nights? If it were just myself having to deal with this I might just have let it go, but I became acutely aware I was not the only patron who was physically challenged and having a difficult time maneuvering the vast spaces of this casino. People on crutches. People limping badly. We didn't see a single person even using a wheelchair that they had not brought in themselves  On top of that the staff was dismissive, rude, and unsympathetic.  I may have actually spent more time and money here had there been SOME sort of accommodation for the handicapped outside of the valet parking, which was marvelous. There wasn't even any gratuitous seating for people who might need a break from limping unless it was at a machine and heaven forbid if you weren't focused on playing the game the seat belonged to without having someone in an uproar. At the very least, you should provide some benches for people who need a break between the limping and spending money.   I think, perhaps, Mr. Gilbert is spending more time focusing on the Cavaliers than he is the people who are patronizing his establishment. This was my first time visiting the Jack Casino and it will definitely be my only visit."}
{"text":"Its shiny, and I like shiny! I'll admit I'm on the casino bandwagon! It's awesome because between my boyfriend and my grandma, someone always wants to go!  I'd opt for the lunch buffet. It's half the price as dinner and the food is just as good!  You can find me on the slots or being reckless on roulette, but I hear that the blackjack tables are where it's at.   Disclaimer- I've never been to another casino so I have nothing to compare this to, thus the 4 stars! Ill update if I ever make it out to Vegas!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here to kill sometime before one of the recent NBA finals games and I was expecting this place to be lively but....crickets...  They do a thorough ID check when you enter the facility but I had no issues getting in.   I played blackjack with a cool guy with a Cavs championship ring on and as can happen when you have a \"hot table\" we became \"friends\" real fast. This included fist pumping and pounding like we were brothers from another mother.   Black jack paid 6/5 I believe...  So...not the greatest atmosphere but nevertheless, cool to have a casino in a downtown area since we don't see that in California..."}
{"text":"Sad and depressing. Well, Ohio you had an election and you voted for this, so it's not Dan Gilbert's fault. The only reason to go is for the morbid curiosity factor. I kept walking around thinking, this was the set for \"The Christmas Story\" and now its a shiny piece of garbage."}
{"text":"We won some and lost some... but we all came out on top AND the perks customer representative compted us 35$ because of a slight inconvenience we experienced.  The blackjack tables are all usually 10$ and up, so we stayed away from them. Just a hint... the high stakes machines were hardly in use and we won big from a few of them."}
{"text":"Speaking objectively as a person that's had some ok times there, and won their fair share of money from the place. Shitty buffet, craps tables dealers don't know shit.......The casino cheats their customers, the drinks are watered down if you order from the tables, but not if you order from the bar on the 2nd floor. Sadly it's a pitiful Phase 1 Casino and it shows! I want the fancy Phase 2 that the voters voted for. Often unprofessional and argumentative table bosses. Only good things I can say is security is top notch."}
{"text":"I find myself going to this casino with these high expectations every time, yet getting disappointed 9 times out of 10. To start, I find a lot of things they do to be repetitive and unnecessary. ID's are checked and scanned upon entrance.  However, it seems like every time I want to buy a drink the same thing happens and they ask for my ID. Isn't it 21+ to even get in? I mean.. aren't there other things to worry about than underage drinkers? It'd be very impressive if someone under 21 got in past security with the hundreds and hundreds of cameras watching. Hell... at that point they deserve a drink if they can pull that one off.  Last Saturday I was there and played blackjack for a good 3 hours.  When I had trouble swiping to get my \"free parking,\" I went up to one of the pit bosses and she said I was only clocked in for 18 minutes. I don't see how that is even remotely possible. She asked \"didn't you give your card?\" Well first, yes I did. Secondly, half the time I had to ask the pit bosses to get me in when I joined another table (brought chips). The one pit boss on the first level was more concerned about ass clowning around than doing his job.  I used to get coupons in the mail all the time for \"free slot play\" and \"free buffets.\" I have not received anything in a long long time.  Although, my playing habits have not changed or indicated that I shouldn't. I do however get mail from the Horseshoe for coupons addressed to a person that doesn't live in my house nor do I know (as I have lived there 3 years) and prior to that an elderly couple for 60 years. I'm very confused.  I am only a platinum card player but I spend a fair amount of money at the Horseshoe casino and get treated like a hobo.    Newsflash: Blackjack payout is awful. BUT WAIT, you can bet $100 on the sucker bet (oops I mean side bet). Give me a break.  A week or two ago I was playing there with my fiancée. He wasn't playing, however I was. He was sitting at the blackjack table next to me, as it wasn't too busy. Long story short the cards aren't going too hot so I gave him some of my chips. He touched them and slid them into the players circle. The dealer gave me a hard time saying \"no back betting.\"  Umm excuse me? This is one I don't understand because my fiancée touched the money. As far as they are concerned it's now HIS money. I don't see how that would be any different than me handing him a $50 and him buying in and playing. Or me sliding him 2 green chips and him playing.  Also, it takes forever and a day for the drink waitresses to come by.  Also, nobody can properly play blackjack.  Lastly, the Horseshoe doesn't give 2 shits because it's basically a monopoly. They can screw people over and get away with it because if you want to gamble you don't have much of a choice unless you want to drive to Columbus or Toledo.  They have you by the balls."}
{"text":"The food was good but slightly pricey. Service was great! Ronnie was on the spot with our drinks and refills! The prime rib was AWESOME! Management came around and checked on tables to make sure we were enjoying everything and that was nice. I would definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"This was our first time at Jack's Casino and it will be our last time. We parked in the self parking garage and did not see any signs that stated it was event parking. After we lost money at the casino and I know we chose to go and gamble the issue is the parking fee. Since they were having a concert that evening which we were unaware since we are from out of town the rate was outrageous. We gambled 1 1/2 hours and then left to be shocked at the $40.00 parking fee. This is robbery... Shame on you Jack's  Casino management. We are from Las Vegas and never did we have to pay at parking in a casino parking garage, never. If you go to Jack's remember to save some money when you need to leave. I have to leave at least one star that is as low as you can rate a site , my opinion is a minus 10 stars."}
{"text":"Casino right downtown? What's better than that!! Yeah, I have found myself in another casino drinking martini's late into the night. This three level casino is right next to the arena and ballpark so if there's a game going on, expect tight tables. They do have a lot of table games as well as slots, and the bars are unique and serve up some nice cold kettles! Hey, you're in Cleveland, what else are you going to do? Sorry Cleveland, this Toledo born guy hates the cold and snow!  PS Drinks aren't free!!"}
{"text":"Love and hate this place. When they first opened, I'd come in from out of town and win some cash. Now I just go there to donate money to the cause, lol. Been here a lot at peak times, off peak, holiday, late night, etc. Everyone is always friendly and you don't get that sleazy feeling once you're in there like you do at most casinos. Poker attendants are great and the diamond lounge is exactly what it's supposed to be. Even tried the buffet once. A little pricey, but you can't go wrong if you're looking for a place to play cards (also the only place)."}
{"text":"Casino aint bad  if dont get bothered or harassed by the hordes of panhandlers and bums that invade the place. Bad enough I cant win, then I have a bums following me around scrapping for any penny they can get. I've been going here since it was the horseshoe. This problem is getting worse and worse and security does nothing"}
{"text":"Tried this buffet for the first time. A friend that works downtown had gone to lunch and recommended it. She said was very inexpensive ($7 with a discount) and actually very good.   Went on a Thursday night and had no expectations. The salad bar was very clean, fresh and the desserts and Asian food looked good. The prime rib was good as well (but fatty), chicken was bland and fruit/vegetables were crisp. I also tried some pasta and it was not that impressive.   The buffet areas were clean from food, heated or chilled very properly and no crossover mix of food items in the displays.  For the circumstances of being a Casino, overall it was decently mediocre. Food items were hit or miss. I would like to try it out for lunch to see the difference. I was able to speak to one of the cooks randomly and he said that they pay top dollar for the ingredients and everything is made from scratch which I would agree based on the desserts ."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped in the Horseshoe last night to scope it out.  It was really nice!  We were pleasantly surprised to see a) how nice the casino was, b) how full the casino was (with people), and c) there were no lines to get in.  There were so many people gambling that I felt like I was no longer in Cleveland.  This is a good thing!  The tables were full.  I could barely get close to them to see what the minimum bets were.  We checked out the buffet, but did not eat.  It looked pretty decent, but the prices, $13.99 for lunch and $23.99 for dinner, were steep.  Then we checked out the High Limit room, but no one was in there.  It was $25 to play slots!  I'm not much of a gambler, but this is still a great place to hang out!  The Higbee building looks beautiful both on the inside and out.  It looks better than I've ever seen it before in my 35 years living in and around Cleveland.  Go Cleveland!"}
{"text":"Took my sister who is having medical problems.I asked for a wheelchair at the entrance to help her with the walk.They said they didnt have any.said they were all stolen.After a one hour walk to gaming over the bridge she was exausted.Lost.Upon leaving we tried to get a wheelchair again.same story.we had to go over the bridge one couch at a time while resting.When we arrived at the valet station the woman working there asked why we didnt have a wheelchair she said they had them there.Later found out they were for special customers[friends and relatives nobody white]I WILL NEVER STEP FOOT IN THERE AGAIN"}
{"text":"I'm really bent out of shape about the parking situation. I'm from Detroit where we have three casinos and all of which do not charge a fee to park. While visiting Cleveland, we decided to check out the jack casino before we headed home. We pulled in and got our member cards and asked how to get our parking validated. Turns out you have to gamble a minimum of $250-$300 just to be able to park your car for free. $40 is a steep price to have your car parked, spending your money in their establishment for 2 hours. Never again!"}
{"text":"So I want to talk about a few issues. I have been a C member for a while and currently hit K status which I may not maintain but lets talk about the first issue. 1. The VIP lounge (library) while I cant confirm what status everyone in there is I can confirm seeing multiple hostesses on their phones or simply just not checking cards. I \"donate\" my share of money to recieve these perks and will bet you 10 pulls on a $25 machine there are plenty of non C and K in there eating the buffet and not even getting drinks..I do understand there are guests of these members and I also have brought in friends and we get many drinks but these individuals devouring the buffet and probably not even J members is getting out of control....lets fix this ASAP and make our paying members feel like the Library is a perk not just another downtown bar for anyone...also have drink prices gone up? Why am I being charged one price downtown and another at Thistledowns VIP?   2. Buffet.....where has the prime rib gone during the week and the salt and pepper shrimp has shrunk in half its size....the buffet is pretty good overall and the wait staff has always done a great job!  3. So I got an invite to a slot tourney recently and thought I would try it out just to see if it's anything I would do again....probably not. So my time was around 1230 and the line was organized and I finished 3rd for my group. Soooo I couldnt see if I made the cut until 5! I understand they want to keep you there to spend money so I took the bait, here is the issue. At 5 it was like a pack of 80 wild dogs all huddled around a small board with names and credits of the people going on to the next round. Lets just say it was chaos at its finest with people using cell phone flashlights...I gave up knowing I probably advanced but couldnt deal with the disorganization.....lets try this....a 65 inch led tv on a stand cycling through the names a credits almost like an airport flight board....everyone can see it and problem solved!   Btw I never write reviews for anything so hopefully a couple people will find this helpful"}
{"text":"What opened as a gem in downtown has fallen into disgrace.  The facilty is not being kept up.  The staff still does not understand what is going on.  I had a $50 comp on my card and the Total Rewards agent claimed I used it already.  After a explaining again and agian I had not she figured out I was correct and apologized.   From the urine stained tiles in the mens room, the litter of plastic cups left behind and not picked up to the broken soap dispensers what a fall from grace.  The food court is sloppy and not cared for.  The best is $25 to park on weekends if you don't gamble for 30 minutes.  Compared to Toledo's Horseshoe is a dump.  I certainly won't compare it to anything outside of Ohio becuae that is just too obvious.  I know you promissed this is a temporary but I am sure its the one and only.  Sad."}
{"text":"Just your garden variety casino, with an unreasonable $25 parking fee. Beware if you're only a casual player, it's not worth it. My first visit was my last."}
{"text":"Came last weekend after hearing what an anomaly it was to have a Casino right in the heart of Cleveland.  I figured it was a must see, so my bf and I stopped in after dinner.   The casino itself is beautifully crafted, with fun odes to Cleveland and Ohio in general, but also a luxurious Vegas vibe with well lit bar and VIP areas, stages, and more.  Gambled a little and wasn't having much luck... the slots were no where near as loose as other Casinos I've been to in San Diego.  Maybe I am used to that vibe, because I really didn't hear a lot of \"fun stuff\" going on.  They had a promotion drawing for electronics and the announcer sounded bored over the speakers. Oh well...  My bf and I signed up for their players card, at most casinos we have been to (other than Vegas Casinos), signing up for a card will offer some type of free play or promotion.  Not here.  The lady taking care of us promised we would receive emails about these types of things...but being that were were only visiting it didn't matter.   We still made the best of looking around and playing a bit. I thought it was pretty cool to have a casino in the happening part of town, as most casinos in San Diego are on reservations out in the boonies.   I've experience better mostly because, I did not appreciate getting grilled at the front door because of having an out of state ID.  I do realize that it is their job and the integrity of their casino rides on making sure no one underage gets in, but instead of scanning my ID, the lady in front felt the need to inconvenience my bf & ask for his ID again so that she could compare them detail by detail.    Sorry lady, they are not the same ID because the CA drivers license was redesigned years ago, and mine is the \"older\" design.  The fact that door staff would not be trained to know that and make me feel awkward before I even step foot in the establishment definitely turned me off.  It was only until I offered to show her my passport that she deemed my real, authentic CA ID passable.  Hey, I guess I should just take it as a compliment that I look youthful, ha!"}
{"text":"Maybe it was just the time of day we were here but there were pretty much NO tables open. There were buses full of people streaming in and the tables were packed and they just had TONS of empty tables that weren't open. We were there for about four hours and unless we wanted to play the $50 tables, we didn't have a chance at a seat. Had a burger in the food court area...not impressed."}
{"text":"I only come to casino's on vacations.  And I generally only come with my husband, but I was feeling lady luck leading me to this casino.  I am glad she did.  Not only did I win about $400, I had a great time.  For those who complain about the excitement level... It's Cleveland.  Not Vegas.  Not Atlantic City.  Not even Reno.  It's a smaller casino in the downtown area of a major metropolitan city.  It's not fancy, but its fun.  When I came the staff at at security area were so kind.  I bought a glass of wine at one of the beautiful bars.  Not only was the wine reasonably priced, the staff were so friendly.  Maybe it was my lucky day, but I won a lot at the slot machines.   You can actually breathe the air in this casino.  It's not smokey and disgusting like other places.  They have several buffets and a burger restaurant in addition to others.    It's a great place to spend a few hours in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"This casino was not as bad as I thought it would be. First of all it's non smoking which is great . Also it was very clean. THere were tons of security guards which made me feel safer then I felt at any other point during my downtown Cleveland stay.  The bads,.,,well there's a lot of homeless people hanging around outside, the casino tables have some shady characters at them (we called one of them the pimps and homies table) and like any casino, there are obviously people that spend way too much time there.   There was a nice assortment of games, quite a few roulette tables , a high roller room and vip bar upstairs as well as a tournement room on the top floor."}
{"text":"Was there last night for the Cavs game. I was not impressed at all. Half of the tables were closed on a finals night with a bunch of people down there. I could not even squeeze into a table if I tried and on top of that they're moving everything to remodel which is obviously a good thing to keep up but during a Cavs final game and having stuff torn apart just doesn't seem very customer-oriented. I have eaten the buffet plenty of times before not what it used to be was a lot better when it was the Horseshoe Casino about 7:30 they quit putting out fresh food and it just sits there. However the staff is very friendly and very personable which made the trip worth while."}
{"text":"I visited the Jack and their parking garage multiple times over the weekend. It was a pretty good experience overall, but had several frustrations. I was in town for the NCAA Wrestling tournament and this casino was a great diversion in between sessions.  This was the first time I visited the Jack since it was changed over from the Horseshoe. While I enjoyed my times on the tables and thought they gave decent odds, I do not think they scheduled enough dealers to open enough tables. Disapointing when you consider they knew they were going to have an influx of people from the tournament and St Patricks Day. In my opinion this was poor planning by management and as a result I had to wait for around an hour four seperate times  to get a seat at a table for either 10, 15, or 25 black jack. Considering I was gambling for 15+ hours combined between my visits, I spent 25% of my time doing nothing.  I did think the employees, dealers and waitresses, were friendly, but found they switched out dealers too frequently at the tables. At the same time it seemed they did not have enough waitresses to attend to the tables as I only had the opportunity to get a drink at the tables an average of once an hour. Had there been more waitresses available, I probably would have spent double on beverages. I had to get up multiple times and reserve a spot to get a drink which was disruptive and disappointing.  I did enjoy the Grill on the second level in the food court and ate there several times. I thought the burgers, dogs, and tacos were tasty and appropriately priced. I did not like the computer/kiosk ordering system as people unfamiliar with the kiosk took twice as long to input an order as a well trained employee would have taken at a register. When you have a long line, each person ahead of you ahead of you adds up or compounds an unnecessary wait. Also on Saturday afternoon there were two kiosks out of order for at least a half hour forcing guests to use only one kiosk for two restraunts.  I parked in their garage on Friday and Saturday and spent 40 and 50 on parking. Considerring I was in their casino gambling for at least ten hours those days I felt I was overcharged and exploited on the parking.  The Jack does have a rewards program that I was placed into based on my previous membership at the Horseshoe. I was not told about this on Thursday or Friday morning at either 15 or 25 blackjack tables i was playing on by the dealer or pit boss.  I will go back and give them a try again and hope that I have a better overall experience the next time I am in Cleveland."}
{"text":"I breezed through here with a friend when I was last in Cleveland.  We spent about ten minutes inside, just checking things out and getting the lay of the land.  If you've been to casinos in other locales that are friendlier to smokers (Vegas, New Orleans, etc), you'll notice right away that no one in the Horseshoe is smoking, nor is there that kinda-smells-like-cigarettes smell.  The place is brand new, so it's super clean and bright.  All the employees were smiling.  My opinion is that this place is built to accommodate way more people than were present when we went through (a Tuesday night, so not surprising).  The buffet area - downstairs - was HUGE.  There's a bar on the main floor that had about a dozen people or so.  About the only thing that seemed close to full was the poker area.  My buddy told me that this Horseshoe's poker area is one of the largest in the world.  There were dozens and dozens of tables, and practically all of them were full.  I mean, it was a sea of people seated in semicircles with a tuxedoed dealer in the middle of each.  Alas, I was not in a position to gamble, and we'd already been drinking for a while, so we moved on without sitting down anywhere.  I may be back, though..."}
{"text":"I'm a pretty infrequent gambler but I do end up at the Horseshoe fairly often. It's my go-to lunch walk destination when I feel like getting carded for a quick self esteem pick-me-up.   I don't have much to add for purposes of this review: it's a casino, it's clean, employees are friendly and helpful, and it's a fun place to take out of town guests. The buffet is great for group lunches.  Tip: make sure you sign up for and use the Total Rewards card... Even though I'm not a high roller, my whole upcoming hotel stay in Vegas got comped. Awesome."}
{"text":"Worst valet experience ever. The attendant gave me a hassle parking my car. I had to spell my last name 3 times. When he still couldn't spell it I handed him my husband's card to copy the name off of.  He is a K player--their highest level. The valet guy told me I could not use my husband's card. I told him I am not using it, I am using it as a reference to spell the last name. He began to laugh. I cussed him out. At the end of the evening, when we returned for the car we asked to speak to the valet supervisor,  Jim. I explained what happened and when asked to describe the valet attendant I described him as a white man with facial hair and a thick foreign accent.  The supervisor yelled in front of my children that I should not describe someone as having a foreign accent and told me that I am a bad example for them.  Needless to say, I will never go there again. The casino has gone down hill fast after changing from the Caesar's Horseshoe brand to JACK. It is more than obvious that they have no idea how to operate a casino and do not care about customer service. Do not waste your time going there. Try the Hard rock Racino in Northfield.  They know how to treat customers."}
{"text":"I don't really gamble so if I win $1, I am happy. I went here twice after Indians games this summer - loved it. Of course the first visit the Indians had won an amazing game after 9th inning game winning run and I was feeling like a WINNER, so we went to casino and I proceeded to lose all my money.   The second visit, Indians won again and no lessons learned I went back feeling that magic - and actually WON. Up $60, I left happy.   They have tons of slot machines and tables. It's very busy on Friday nights, at least when I went. Crowd was a heathy mix of regulars, baseball fans and weekend warriors.   The casino is a nice space, never went to buffet or little food court area, but the bars have a good selection of drinks.   Use the parking lot next to public square off like w. 3rd, it's cheaper.   * Still kinda wish Higbee's (Dillard's) was around, loved holiday shopping downtown in the 90s!"}
{"text":"As I walked through the Horseshoe, I couldn't stop thinking of 2Pac on his final, fatal night at the casino when he stomped out that guy. Horseshoe definitely has the smell of a casino. It kind of smells like metal coins and conditioned air. I don't know if that conspiracy theory is true about pumping weird air out to hypnotize people and make them spend money freely. My friend played a slot machine called \"Whale Song\". The game seemed pretty cool. The whales sing. I love all of the dumb slot games with stupid gimmicks to make people play. I went here a couple times after it opened but have been staying \"out the way\" lately. Well, trying to anyhow. One night I took the 26 down Detroit home. That was really convenient. WHALE SONG IS THE BEST!"}
{"text":"My buddy and I came up to check out Ohio's first casino and it didn't disappoint at all. Every employee we dealt with was great, they smiled and helped us find something or wished us luck playing.   My buddy did run into a little problem, we were playing penny slots when he wanted to order a rum and diet he ordered one from the touchscreen. We saw a waitress come by with a tray of drinks, but she didn't stop. My friend ended up canceling his drink order and just waited till we got out of the casino to drink.   If the Cincinnati Casino is anything like the Cleveland Horseshoe Casino, we are in luck..  Not to mention I love the Casino was smoke free."}
{"text":"I started to give four stars but I just didn't like the selections or the food in the food court.  Other than that, I can't complain.   It's not Vegas so the drinks aren't free.  However, the drinks are cheap and there's a nice bar area, almost like a lounge, on the second floor.  The service was great too.  Myisha was so good that I came back the next night too but I didn't see her.   The only game I played was blackjack.  The dealers rivaled those in Vegas. The vibe was good and I won a little money too.  While I'm not much of a gambler, I would come back just to hang with friends."}
{"text":"K well came here with hubby he was playing in a tournament.   Well first of all the good things about this casino is the slots are new.  The casino is really busy which is also a good sign.   Bad news is there is food at only 3 places.  So unless u like pizza, hot dogs or any other greasy garbage this is your place.   In Detroit my hometown the casino provides coffee, soda, and water as complimentary.   Here u can literally die of thirst.   No one offers water and I have been here for two days and not one drinking fountain.  So I'm not impressed with this place at all.  If u can't even be comfortable playing what's the point."}
{"text":"I finally checked out Cleveland's casino. It was pretty busy, on both levels. The place was clean though and the crowd okay. The staff at the cashier's desk and the Total Rewards desk were efficient. The bartenders didn't show a huge interest in the patrons. The upstairs bar - all 9 kegs were tapped. Unlikely? The downstairs bar service was slow. The waitresses coming around to the game tables only take cash - no chips and no credit cards (even though they use an iPad to take your order). The lack of accepting chips seemed to be a point of confusion for people - recent change I think... If you park in one of the 2 self-park lots (I chose the one on W3rd and Superior across from the Renaissance hotel's self-park lot) and have a Total Rewards card (Free to sign up) you get free parking for up to 24hrs if you earn 15 Total Rewards Points while playing any game (it's more about the accumulation of 15 points than playing for just 30 minutes as is more readily advertised)."}
{"text":"Great little casino in the heart of downtown Cleveland! Being from the southwest ridden of Native American casinos with strange gambling rules and roulette boards with cards instead of a wheel and ball, this place was a pleasant surprise. We gambled and drank and partied before the Cavaliers game last night, we were able to walk (indoors) from the casino to The Q arena and watch the game and come back and gamble some more! Will be back today for Sunday football!"}
{"text":"Been coming here a lil more often lately. The place has come a lllllooong way from when it first opened! No bad experiences. They've been friendly and service oriented. No issues getting a cocktail or four. No machine issues, I mean besides the fact they take my money and I don't win!! :) I've won some and lost some. In the grand scheme of things I dare say I'm about even with the house, right now! Buffet wasn't anything fancy but it wasn't bad. Quite a few options. I'd eat there again."}
{"text":"Three levels of fun here at the Jack Casino. The feel to this place is fun, almost cozy, which isn't a word I would use to describe a casino but this one has that feel. Actually one of my favorite casinos I have been in. You always know where you are and getting lost isn't as easy as other casinos. They have slots, table games, poker, and I'm not sure about a sports book. There are multiple bars and restaurants and the staff was always welcoming."}
{"text":"Good buffet for dinner, although the line moves a bit slow.  I really love the Asian selection, especially the kimchi!  We were a bit disappointed with the desserts this time, since there was no cheesecake :(   However, we will of course be back!  Casino was fun and lively!  Of course, I didn't win anything, but still had a blast!"}
{"text":"I miss you Horseshoe!  The change was a complete downgrade!  From the cheesy t-shirts that the employees wear, to the dwindling perks, non existent comps, tightest slots known to man and dismal gift giveaways.  I used to get $160 gas cards, now I get a JACK glass set worth $20!  You can no longer request comp vouchers for food from your host...not exactly sure what hosts do now?  The morale is so LOW, you can just see it on everyone's faces.  I was sitting at a slot machine when I overheard a slot attendant talking to another slot attendant joking about the fact that someone just won a large jackpot and how JACK was going to send them home because they couldn't afford to pay them now.  The slots used to treat me well when it was the Horseshoe...you had to pump them with money but they would eventually pay out.  I had (11) w-2s last year with huge jackpots...since the change I have 1 for a measly $1500 jackpot.   The slot machines just EAT your money.  The buffet is awful, empty food containers, luke warm food and takes about 20 minutes to get your drink.  Plus the cashiers don't even value the King players and often skip over the Kings standing in line.  I won't be back...I had finally had my fill.  I don't think this casino is going to make it.  The past two weekends have been EMPTY.  Sorry Gilbert but you ruined a great thing!"}
{"text":"Cleveland, Ohio is a horrible city full of terrible sports teams (go Lions!). Not only do I favor the Detroit sports teams, I also favor the Detroit Casinos (and every other Casino on this planet).   Visited my buddy from Cleveland this weekend, and had to stop by the Horseshoe, soon to be JACK casino. I have to say, this place is horrible. I don't mind occasionally losing a bit of money at the gambling hall, but I hate losing it and having a bad time. I played at several blackjack tables (wtf is with the high minimums here!!) and noted there to be only one dealer that made playing a good experience, and no, I am not necessarily meaning just winning. Some are just rude, have fun with no tips bro.   The decor in the casino wasn't bad, but on the outside you wouldn't even know it's a casino. Strange place. The drink prices here are above average. The clientele of this place is terrible, and I frequent the Detroit casinos. The people who go here are rude and obnoxious. At every table I played at, there was at least one person who was loud and encouraging other players to play against basic strategy, or people with no personalities. I wasn't suprised by this, based on the fact that half of these people actually are Browns fans, and a quarter of those people probably at one point were excited by Johnny Manziel being drafted.   Also, this place charges for parking. WHAT? They actually charge you money, so that you come and give them your money. These people must be mentally ill who regularly patronize this casino. In Detroit, parking is free all day, every day, and we actually have sports events worth attending. Greektown (soon also to be JACK) offers free parking all the time to Players Card holders, but charges on game days for non card holders. This place makes you play for thirty minutes? Good luck! You will probably lose ten times what parking would have cost. Just pay it.   I am glad I went to the Horseshoe casino, but I have zero plans of ever returning to this establishment."}
{"text":"This place is just not worth it. I would give them two stars based on my overall experience, but having to pay $25 for parking when I'm used to casino self-parking being free, irritates me enough to lower it to one star.  When I went on a Saturday night at 6:30 p.m., the parking lot was packed and we ended up having to park at the top part of the exposed lot in the rain. Even then we had to do some zigzagging to figure out how to even enter the casino.  Once we were in the casino, I looked for an electronic roulette table (my favorite game) only to find out they don't have any. On top of that, the roulette tables with dealers have $15 minimums and are PACKED. I prefer $5 minimums or less, but really wanted to play, so begrudgingly tried the $15 minimum roulette table. The dealer was super rude, and as soon as I bet $20 on red (and won), I got out of there as fast as I could.   Too bad I didn't even break even with winning $20 since the parking was $25.  Absolutely no reason for me to come back here."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. We just stopped in to say we've been here. Not impressed at all. Every person from the security guy to the people who supposed are in charge were rude. We got yelled at for trying to find a restroom.   You're all not Vegas treat your patrons with respect."}
{"text":"Very nice casino with great decor.  Needs more table games as they get crowded and fill up rather quickly."}
{"text":"Ohio's first casino, and it's right in the heart od downtown!  It is always packed here!  I don't gamble, but I like to go to see my friends and family and people watch lol.  But this is a very nice casino that is nicely designed.  I wish that the parking was attached, so that I wouldn't have to walk to my car (doesn't feel safe when it's late at night and if I'm alone).  It is nice that they do offer free parking if you play for 30 minutes or if you are at least a Diamond Club member.  There are two nearby lots for free self-parking, one of which is an indoor garage.  They are each located on opposite ends of the casino, which is nice because it opens up your access to another area of downtown.  They also offer free shuttle service between the parking garage and casino.  They have a small food court with Corky and Lenny's, B Spot and an Italian dining option on the second floor.  In the basement, they have the buffet which is very extensive and has a variety of cuisines: Asian, Italian, American, Southern, carving station, dessert station and more!  Their prime rib carving station is delicious, and they have pretty good Asian cuisine.  If you play the house table games for long enough, you can ask a manager for food vouchers (hint hint!).  This casino always has giveaways and raffles, where you can win big money for slot play, cars and gifts!  They definitely make it enticing to keep coming back! This casino isn't very big, even though it is four levels.  But I heard through the grapevine that they are building a much larger facility in the flats, and that soon this location will be limited to just certain games. The only other downside is that they don't give free drinks like Vegas!  But I am pretty sure that it is a state law that you cannot give free alcohol, unless they are sample sizes.  However, if you are a Diamond Club member, there is a lounge on the top floor, where you can get cocktails for only $2, and I believe that non-alcoholic beverages are free (don't quote me on that... I ordered one cocktail and one shirley temple, and it was only $2!)."}
{"text":"I grew up in Vegas and have been to Atlantic City. I now live in Colorado and have been to the mountain casinos here. Casinos in Connecticut, been there.  I absolutely love old Vegas, I'm talking 70s Vegas when I was to little to gamble. We would pass through the casino to get to the coffee shop to have breakfast with my grandparents. They had people placed at the doors of the casino to open the doors for you.When you walked in it was breathtaking. Chandeliers and velvet, It was dripping in luxury!  I worked downtown and on the strip. I have been to plenty casinos. Boy have things changed today!  I don't understand how people can say anything negative about this place. I can say we took a cab so I cant talk about parking,  Well, the only negative thing I will say is the min bet at the tables is $15.00. Who do they think they are, Vegas? lol!  Oh, how can I forget...you have to pay for your drinks. Really!?! You are putting all your hard earned money in and can't even get a free drink.  From the moment the doors were open for us we got the best costumer service I have seen since \"Old Vegas\"! We were looked at in the face and talked to. Every employee who came in contact with us smiled and talked to us. It was an amazing experience! The best part was when my husband won $1,000 playing .25 cent Wheel of Fortune slot machine, Not to mention the great service at the buffet and buffet manager Sherry who treated us amazingly! Did I mention I was up $75.00 in roulette after two hours.  We loved The Horseshoe!"}
{"text":"Omg, a smoke-free casino. What a rare and beautiful thing. Extra star for that.   Great location, walkable from stadium and convention center. Nice repurposing of what used to be a department store.   They don't have the latest slot machines, and it seemed like the whole first floor had only animated penny machines. But there is a digital table games area and you can find quarter reel machines and the kind you can choose denominations of 25 cent - 50 cent - one dollar. I didn't see any higher limit slot machines.   The food options seem sparse, but I didn't eat there and there are plenty of options nearby.   Went in with $20, came out with $150. And didn't smell like cigarette smoke. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I won money on the electronic craps game. I got my drinks quickly. The place is pretty and smoke free. All these things make me happy. The parking garage was seriously confusing though."}
{"text":"So golden!  Blingy!  Fun!  Busy!  (i broke my arm so thats the summary)"}
{"text":"Oh the delima... How to give a good review to a place that left me grumpy? Here goes...  The Horseshoe Casino in Cleveland is beautiful, very clean, great service, yummy drinks and great food options. We always love to eat at Michael Symon's B-spot inside the casino. Love that it's a non-smoking facility... We never leave stinky like other casinos.  Here's the grumpy part... I NEVER win any cash money! I always play the quarter slots and commit to only spending $100 when gambling. Every dang time we go here I walk out with empty pockets. No Lady Luck for this girl.  This won't stop me from visiting Horseshoe Casino... Just wish that someday I could win big money big money!"}
{"text":"This place is full of street wanderers outside. If you can get past the smelly outside then you will rewarded with a fun atmosphere inside. I was there during a weekend midday and it full of people. It's a worth a visit if you're in town."}
{"text":"This rating is for their poker room. I don't play any other games in the casino. If I could give a zero star rating I would.  I play a lot of poker across the country, and this is by far THE worst run room anywhere in the US. 90% of the dealers are not customer friendly. They have to pool their tips so there is no incentive for individual dealers to give good service. I tip the minimum just because I feel sorry for the dealer not because of the service. They have cancelled  to host a WSOP circuit event twice in last two years. In my opinion, it is because they don't want to spend the money and effort since they don't want to cater to poker players. I don't understand this as the poker market in Cle and NEO is huge. The rake they charge and the promotions they run for poker are embarrassing. I get more rewards and promotions at other casinos I have to travel to that cater to poker players. Lastly their daily tournament structures are bad. Little value in playing them in my opinion. I avoid the casino at all times unless my friends from out of town force me to go BC they want to see it. I wish I could go back in time and change my vote for ohio casino's unless they enforce  two casinos competing in the same marketplace. At least competition would force the casinos to listen to customers and compete for their business. It works for the slot play in this town."}
{"text":"I'm glad that this Casino turned out as nice as it did but they really need to expand it and put in more tables. You can hardly move around in here on weekends, if you can stand to wait in line to enter.  Good luck trying to get in on a table, and bring plenty of money cause they don't have any $5 tables!!"}
