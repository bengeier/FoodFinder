{"text":"NY style pizzas. One of the best I've tried outside of NYC. The XL pizza is huge (20\") and a great value. The crust is thin and has the right amount of chew to it. The sauce did the job, although I'd prefer it with a little more punch. Had a nice layer of cheese without being too much.   The white pizza is also delicious. Comes with ricotta on it just like they make it in NY.   So skip the chains and treat yourself to a real pie."}
{"text":"A very good pie for the price.  The place is a little pizza shop in the country.  My friend lives out there and had the pizza twice.  Nice thin and crisp, but chewy crust.  Perfect sauce to cheese ratio.  The wings are also a value for the price.  The pizza only comes in 8 cuts irregardless of the size of pizza.  Thus the pieces are huge.  Not much info is available online, but the place is open seven days a week, even though I read online that it isn't open on Sundays.  This is not true, as I ordered pizza there today (a Sunday.)  What do I mean by great value? A large pizza with pepperoni and 10 wings was $14!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in the area!  The days/hours may vary because the owner is also the order taker, cook, and cashier.  The everyday pick-up special is a Large, 16\"/8 cut pizza, with one topping, for $7.99.  The thin slices are huge, and the pizza is usually on the well done side.  The pizza has a medium amount of cheese, a light amount of sauce, and a great garlic flavor.  The wings and cheese steak subs are also popular choices.  Sometimes other menu items are unavailable due to shortage of ingredients."}
{"text":"This place has the best slices of pizza in Pittsburgh. We drive over a half hour just to get a few slices from Ferrari's.  Its a perfect representation of mammoth east coast style slices.  I am eager to try their Sicilian pizza.  Prices were reasonable.  The old dude that runs the place makes me a bit uncomfortable, I always send my husband in for this fact. ."}
{"text":"Great little pizza shop, thin crust and overall great pizza.   Has steak and cheese hoagies for 5 bucks but if he's  slammed he only makes pizza which is inconvenience at times"}
{"text":"Pizza is really good/ very close to excellent.  The crust is thin, but not too thin.  It's so great to see a small business like his do such a good business in the era where online app ordering from mega-corporate franchises is the norm.  Just watching him make an order and you can tell he takes pride in his work.  The white/ricotta pizza is awesome. The best pizza in North Huntingdon by far."}
{"text":"The crust is really good, and the price is right for their slices. What happened about actually putting sauce on a pizza???"}
{"text":"Decent pizza but I can do without the side order of attitude, but the owner is a prick, getting all pissy because you ask your total...and treating you like garbage and giving you attitude because you don't have a menu in front of you and you ask to order the pick up special with an additional topping...is it really hard to give a price? And obviously I'm not the only one who thinks he is a jerk... he's like the soup nazi from Seinfeld..."}
{"text":"! I sent my wife in to get the pizza and the old dego wop asked her if she ordered extra anchovies like the 80's movie Loverboy. What a douche bag. Stay away because he can't keep his dick in his pants."}
{"text":"Great New York Style pizza!  I get pizza by the slice here often and the slices are huge.  Calzones are quite tasty here as well.  If you're driving on 30 near the North Versailles/North Huntingdon border, you have to stop in here for a bite."}
{"text":"I have eaten a lot of pizza from Napoletan wood fired at Le Pizziolia(sp) in Mt Lebanon to generic Pizza Hut/Dominos and tons of variations in between including various locations in Italy. Plus I make my own dough from scratch with Caputo 00 flour ( from Penn Mac) and know how to let it work and gain flavor over 3 days. That being said, I find this pizza variation a little above average for quality but a total bargain pricewise for the size of the pizza you receive. Mine was $14.50 for medium, two toppings, extra cheese and would easily feed 5 or 6 people or 3 teenage males. Slicing all sizes into 8 pieces just is wierd to me......there is no good reason for it and it just causes extra work when you get it home. Holding a full slice may work for guys, don't think most women are up for that messy challenge as the pizza drips oil.  Toppings are sparse to me....a little below norm and the sausage is nothing great. Again, since i make my own sausage from scratch, I have pretty high standards. The best thing you can say about the sausage is that it is not the little peas sized stuff a lot of places use. The sauce is not objectionable but not remarkable either as I am sure it comes straight from a can. The cheese is good quality. I asked for extra but to me, it was not as much as I expected. I think Conforti's (ex-Vincents) near the Giant Eagle in NHT  is superior to this for two reasons, quality and taste of dough (a sourdough style with huge fluffy bubbles on the crust) and quantity and quality of toppings (put on by the handful).  The sausage used at Conforti's and Vincent's is bulk by big chunks and had good basic but strong anise flavoring, you do pay a huge premium for Conforti's compared to run of the mill places. Confortis also  does not deliver like this place does not.   This prodiuct should satisfy those with the craving for New York style thin pizza. I am not sure I would drive miles for it like many who have reviewed it here. I drove miles for Vincents in Forrest Hills for years even though he smoked while making your pizza and had a loaded revolver on the counter beside him.   This place is a true one person operation, so keep that in mind when ordering. No frills here.   Don't bother to look at the \"menu\" posted here....it is obsolete.......this is a thin pizza place period. I aksed for Sicilian thick crust and he said he was \"out\". No sandwiches, no wings, no salads."}
{"text":"Totally out of control, delicious pizza. The thick crust is my favorite but all of the pizza is amazing. Know what you want and don't be surprised if he's out of something. Just roll with it. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"We have been searching for this pizza for along time. Thin crust, actually done well and not under an under cooked dough ball. Freaking awesome Jersey style pie. I am impressed and happy to have found my local pizza shop."}
{"text":"Authentic NY-style pizza is hard to come by in the Burgh, so when I found this place I was pretty thrilled. Huge, delicious slices for mere pocket change. I don't say this lightly, but this is my favorite spot in Pittsburgh for pizza. More than worth the occasional 15-mile drive it takes to get to Ferrari's from where I live."}
