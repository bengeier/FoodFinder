{"text":"Red Line Grill offers mouth watering meals and portions that are fit for a King!!

Cleanest restaurant in Surprise and the quality of customer service is unmatched!

Family friendly environment is big bonus too.

The bar offers incredible selection of customized drinks with all the sporting events.

The waiter signed me up for their VIP Club by texting RLAZ to 51660. It saved me 15% off my bill too!

My family's favorite new spot in Surprise"}
{"text":"I visited the red line Grill half a dozen times and the service has always been excellent the food outstanding and the overall atmosphere excellent"}
{"text":"So sitting here 45min now. Still no food but hey the 2 tables that came 25min after us already have their order. I knew we should've walked out when the lady who came to sit us acted like a b$&ch and treated us like we were an inconvenience. Cause hey the next few people she seated she was much different with.

When I say we have 5 and a baby why would you ever offer the bar as an option when it's clear the dining room had more than enough seating. Place has seriously gone down hill since the last time we've came here. This might be the last time we do. Even though we enjoyed the menu.

Oh and getting charged for an extra cup of coffee isn't nice either. And when you ask for a manager nobody ever shows up. Not even worth my time trying to get them to adjust the coffee off."}
{"text":"This business has been open for just about two weeks now but to see a good family restaurant that truly cares about their guest is amazing! The owners are always around making sure everything is good and it's rare to see owners actually work hard in their business! Home cooked quality food and trust me you can taste that the food was made with love because it's so delicious!!!! Surprise really needed a place that you can go get a home cooked meal and drink for less then 10$!!! Talk about a great deal! Everyone must check this place out because it is truly worth it!!!!!"}
{"text":"We ate at the Red Line Grill right after opening and ate there again tonite for the first time since then.  I gave it very high marks the first time we ate there and hate to only give it mediocre ratings tonite but it was quite disappointing.  Not the food but the wait time to get our food.  I know it's Friday nite but even though there was plenty of waitstaff and it was very crowded it seemed quite disorganized and a lot of rushing and frazzled looking waiters. We had a very nice waitress who was very busy and I don't blame her for our lengthy wait for food.  It appeared everyone was waiting a long time therefore I have to assume it was the kitchen?  I don't know that much about running a restaurant but our food was delivered at different times and after quite a long wait even for a Friday nite.  I'm glad they are doing so well and was glad to see the crowds but we won't go back on a weekend night for sure.  I had the baked catfish and it was very good.  All the food was so no problems there.  Our waitress was apologetic and without asking removed some of our food costs to apoligize and I appreciated that.  We will go back as its convenient and I do think the food is very good but they need to work on busy nights and being a little more organized and getting food out in a timely manner."}
{"text":"Ate there for the first time the other night. The corn beef sandwich was good as well as the cole slaw. My only criticism would be the rye bread. It was like soft white bread almost gummy when eating it and the crust was soft. Not like rye bread at all. They need to change vendors.  Otherwise it wad a good experience."}
{"text":"They were very busy as they had a car showing going on.  Got right in and waitress did her best.  Order actually came up in good time.  Pastrami sandwich was very good !  Hamburger was good.  Carrot cake had good flavor but extremely dry!!  I wanted to give it back because if was so dry!!  Desserts wrap up the meal and need to be good!!!   Unfortunately the big piece of carrot cake was very disappointing.  May or may not go back."}
{"text":"Straight-ahead, what-you-see-is-what-you-get, basic diner. I had barbecue beef sandwich, although I ordered the sauce on the side which means I got meat that hadn't been simmered in the sauce - don't know what the normal sandwich is like. The french fries appeared to be of the battered type, which I thought tasted very good. My son enjoyed his all-you-can eat spaghetti. I'd go again if I'm in the area for a ballgame someday later on."}
{"text":"I really hope this restaurant is successful! In Surprise, so many come and go, (mostly with good reason).

There was no wait, and I was able to seat myself. I found a nice table, situated so I could see the morning news on the TV. The place is very clean, and large enough to accommodate a busy morning rush. I was immediately greeted with a smile by my server, Sheila. She brought coffee, and had my order taken very promptly. The service was fast and very friendly. I ordered the corned beef hash and eggs, with hash browns and toast. When I approached the restaurant, I absentmindedly missed the Daily Specials sign out front, and so when I ordered this, the server let me know that it was on special. Score! It was brought out after a not very long wait, and was steaming hot. The food tasted fresh and delicious. I was expecting the normal canned corned beef and hash (which I also enjoy), but this was chopped corned beef, that I could tell wasn't you're normal hash. I asked, and sure enough, the corned beef was made in-house. It was a nice departure. My coffee never got cold, as it was topped off quite often. I left with a full belly, and no complaints!

Overall, the experience led me to recommend this new restaurant to friends. Good luck in Surprise, Sheila and the Redline Grill!!"}
{"text":"Food was really great, we all loved it however, my sister was declined to be served alcohol because the servers had never seen an out of state ID, with a change of address sticker. Possibly coming back, but the attitude and lack of knowledge in a professional environment needs to change, thank you."}
{"text":"The food here is very good, we took the family for breakfast and we loved it.
We had a skillet and the kids had pancakes with fruit. 
It was a great experience to take the family here, will be back for sure. 

Good service and staff was friendly."}
{"text":"We walked in and noone greeted us. It took several minutes for someone to drop off a menu without greegting us or asking us if we'd  like something to drink. Needless to say we walked out. The sad part is they had many staff members and the place was almost empty."}
{"text":"This is the second time we visited this new establishment. It was past 8pm so we didn't expect to wait and we weren't wrong. We were sat immediately. What I quickly realized is that it was a wrong choice for for different reasons. Apparently, they were out of vegetables.

The veggie of the day is corn. Corn is a grass and considered as much a carb as bread There were no alternatives. No other fresh vegetables. The other sides included a potato, fries, rice, slaw, etc. Nothing that can be considered low carb, or paleo, or AIP, etc. I chose their anemic house salad and asked for a double size to compensate for the fact that I am not getting a full meal. The salad arrived with oversize Iceberg lettuce, thick cuts of red onion, a few cucumber halves and some mushy cherry tomatoes. Next to it was my salmon. For $14. 

Salmon was good. A little tough on the bottom but tasty.

I just find it odd that the menu completely ignores commonly accepted alternatives to white carbs. Sweet potatoes are easy and have a long shelf life. Roasted veggies are easy. Broccoli is ridiculously easy. I feel like I grossly overpaid for a piece of salmon and a terrible salad."}
{"text":"Huge amount of food. Very friendly and quick service. Yummy and very sloppy bbq beef sandwich on a bun. Had to eat it with a fork because I couldn't pick it up 'cause there was so much sauce on it."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying the food was very good!  The atmosphere is  automotive. It was OK. I wasn't expecting the meals we had to be as good as they were looking at the place!
 Pleasant surprise! Great food. Great service. Try this place. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I have been to Red Line on 3 different times....1st time for breakfast, food & waitress Debbie was terrific.  Next occasion was for 9 people who got specials & breakfast.  Waitress n/very friendly, got irritated when we told her soups just warm but we ate it.  When 3 people got listed specials, they were cold, they replaced w/new meal, still n/heated through!!  3rd time for 2 people for lunch, we were ignored for 20 mins, finally got grumpy waitress, food n/hot!!  Service terrible.  We will n/be returning to this place!!"}
{"text":"This is a really nice place. Lots of parking. You can sit on the bar or cafe side. The people working here are really nice. The drinks were good. I had a leaded root beer float ( vanilla vodka yum ). My husband had an Irish coffee. For dinner I had the 1/3 lb burger with blue cheese and bacon. It was so good. Lots of cheese, crisp bacon and a nice soft bun. My husband had the BELT. It's a BLT with an egg. It must have been good because it didn't last long. The fries and onion rings were crisp and delicious.  It wasn't busy when we were there, but once the word gets out I'm sure it will be busy. Lots to choose from on the menu. Good basics and breakfast too. We will be back."}
{"text":"Updated: WOW Demetri, I went to the races a couple weeks ago and ran in to Mike...all I have to say is wow! You really need to give him back his race memorabilia especially his fathers! I usually only believe half of what I hear but WOW! He showed me all your correspondence, and all the proof he has that you were in fact partners, contrary to what the \"new ownership says\" (your brother, mother and father) 
I can't believe you stiffed him on 40+k for building the place! Not only stiffed but scammed! Totally makes me sick! Don't count on my support in Surprise! Its sad we loved this place before you guys split. The difference is really noticeable. The worst was the fact he said he was going to picket (to get his memoribillia and payment)and was getting a permit to do so and then you put a restraining order so he can't  near the place? That is a constitutional outrage! My wife and I will be intouch with his attorney  as we were introduced to Mike by your mother as a partner and the \" owner of all these beautiful things you see on the walls\""}
{"text":"Went there twice, service was very slow both times...and I was sitting at the bar.  There were only about 8 customers this last time, but the bartender couldn't handle the volume.  At one point she left the bar for a while, and no one was covering for her.  When she finally returned, we gladly cashed out."}
{"text":"We went Sunday for first time.  Yum!  The Reuben and fries delicious!  We will return.  Sunday morning probably worst time to go after church...but was worth the wait."}
{"text":"Amazing place! Really great breakfast with a super nice staff. Bloody marys with bacon garnish, what's not to love???

Seriously though, this is a great place and i can't recommend it enough"}
{"text":"I was undecided where to eat and noticed this location had a new tenant Red Line so I thought I'd try it hoping it was good and would do well. Based on my one visit I really wonder about the other reviews. 

Stopped around 5:30 Friday in the bar area. Nice bar and seating and bartender was friendly. I knew it wasn't the place to order a vodka martini but I did any way (up with a twist).  Smallest ever and with a lime. Switched to a bottled Kilt Lifter since tap selection was limited. 

Nothing on menu jumped out at me so got the fish fry special. I expected some variation of home battered white fish like everywhere else around here. I got what appeared to be uniform fillets from a box and not totally cooked. The side veggies soggy and tasteless. The fries were ok. 

Two stars because it's new, I only had one thing from the menu, and I wish them well but I'm unlikely to ever return."}
{"text":"Red Line Grill has the most wonderful food here! This place has so much comfortable seating, you can watch tv and it is a big business! They have more than enough room to for you to go eat!"}
{"text":"Saw some positive reviews and decided to give it a try for breakfast this morning. Absolutely horrendous service. We waited 15 minutes for our server to even come talk to us, and another 45 minutes for our food, which was greasy and flavorless at best. The servers on the bar side of the restaurant were unprofessional, and there was a man who I can only assume was a manager who I observed being extremely rude and condescending to a table of older folks who said they had also been waiting a long time for their food, as they were there before us and didn't even have their food by the time we got ours. I then saw him reprimanding other members of the staff in front of customers they were serving while we were walking out. Not a good first impression and won't be back."}
{"text":"Went into Redline Grill today for Mother's Day breakfast with my wife.  This was our fourth visit to this restaurant.  The first three times, the food was good (not great) and the service was so so.  The big issue in the past with breakfast is when I ask for the bacon to be fryered (dipped in the fryer to make it extra crispy) it has never happened.  Today was no exception, even though I went out of my way and told him what fryer the bacon meant in restaurant terms.  He even reiterated that I wanted it extra crispy.  When it came out it was average cooked at best and still limp.

As it was mother's day I decided not to mention it but left all four pieces I paid extra for on my plate for Nathan, our waiter, to see when he came back to check.  He was oblivious to the fact the bacon was untouched and asked if there was anything else we needed.  We said no and asked for the check.  Mind you he never came over after we received our food to ask if everything was okay.

He came back with the check he said he took 25% off for the long wait for our food as there were several parties in the restaurant which was nice of him to do but, again, no mention of the bacon that was still on my plate uneaten.  Actually, the wait time for the food was not an issue at all from my perspective, but I accepted the 25% off because of the bacon issue.  This brought the bill down to $15 and change.  He took our card and came back with the credit card receipt and left.  When I looked at the credit card receipt it said $24.07, nearly $9.00 more than the actual bill he presented us.  

When he came back I told him I left a note on the bill starting that his tip could be found in the difference between the bill we were presented and the credit card receipt.  He looked confused, trying to figure out what happened, but never offered to call over a manager to correct the issue.  Normally I would have tipped him 20% of the original bill price for good or better service and he would have received a $4 tip on the $15 bill.  In this case, we left following this without giving him a tip  as I felt he had already received a $9.00 tip on a bill that would have been roughly $20 before he took the discount off.  I can tell you that in the past ten years or so, I have only left without any tip at all on two other occasions and we eat out several times a week.  And you have to really suck to get less than 20% tip from me.  You have to really piss me off to get stiffed.  Today he really pissed me off with the overcharge.

Still, not offering to do anything to correct the issue as we were leaving, I told him to let his owner know that we would not be returning to eat there due to this situation.  He let us walk out without saying anything else. 

It's too bad as we have been trying to find another good alternative to Nick's Diner II as I love to eat there but like some variations and options and have yet to find any place as good as Nick's II in Surprise. There are some that are okay but not nearly as good as Nick's.  I do not work for Nick's, have friends or family that work there, nor am I an owner or investor, I just like to get good food and service for a fair price and the way I ordered it without being ripped off.

Prior to today, I would have rated Redline Grill a three star based on past performance.  After today's situation, I wish I could give them a zero.  They do a good business and I am sure a lot of people like their atmosphere, food, and service, but for me, I will drive on down the road next time.  Now it will be interesting to see which amount my credit card actually gets charged.  Will be correct the charge to my card to the bill he presented with the $25 off or will be pocket the extra $9.00 for himself.  I should know in a couple of days after the charge clears my account."}
{"text":"Amazing food ! Decorations and restaurant theme is really cool ! Defiantly brings this place to life !"}
{"text":"We had lunch at Red Line Grill, and it was so good. The portions are huge, and the food was excellent. I had a prime rib sandwich, and the prime rib was a solid piece of meat at least one inch thick, and so tender. The service was friendly and welcoming. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"We were looking for a place serving homestyle Christmas Dinner and that would be reasonably priced.  We found it here. The prime rib was excellent and the home made soup very tasty. Portions were a nice size. Prices were midrange and a good value.  Service was good. 

Their menu is quite large not unlike a diner. Their breakfast options are diverse with names around states and car. The theme is based on auto racing.  

Finally, I always hear the complaint that all the restaurants are chains.  This one is not and is a true family run operation. Mom and the two brothers were present and came by to say hello. 

Worth giving  them a try and hope they succeed."}
{"text":"Thick cut Flat iron steak was grilled to order, and very tender. Came with grilled onions, peppers & Swiss cheese on a sub roll for $13.99 Also had a half pound burger to order with grilled onions on grilled Rye and sweet potato fries for $11. Yum! Can't wait to return.  Menu is extensive. They serve breakfast from 7-3 pm. The offer sandwiches,salads,  seafood, dinners, home made shakes and homemade pies. Waited a bit for service and the meal but was well worth it!  Had to bring home left overs.  They also offer a senior menu for $9.99 with several choices."}
{"text":"I found this hidden gem by making a wrong turn.  Looked fun, so we went back for lunch.  The Rueben was fantastic, generously put together.  I added sweet potato fries and the server asked me how crisp I wanted them!  They came out exactly right.  My wife had a great looking salad.  The service was ace, not pressured. Brianna even made sure we never had to ask for refills.  A great place for lunch, just off Bell near Reems.  Looks like a great bar to take in a game, too."}
{"text":"Good food in Surprise! Yay! We had breakfast- sweet potato pancakes and am omelette...which was fantastic! The service was great too. Everything that opens in that corner there doesn't seem to last long, but I REALLY hope Red Line does. It was a little pricey, but when I saw how much food you get...wow! Two people could share an omelette-they are absolutely packed with filling. 

We will be back!"}
{"text":"I have heard about this place from several friends. So I decided to try it out and see for myself. I was surprise about this place. I been there a couple of times and have enjoyed it both times. The first time was in the dinner area and it was not noisy, but the next time I was in bar area and that was a better fit for me. That side was the better of the two. I will go back again, maybe for breakfast..."}
{"text":"Sunday am 10:40.  Chose to sit on patio nice day.  3 people came by to get drink order.  Finally manager brought coffee no water which we requested.  A guy (Jesse) came by to say that person over there would take our  order --nope.  Finally Jesse took order.  People whose order he took after our got served and poof Jesse disappeared..  finally manager asked if we had our order taken we said yes but no food.  He went inside to find Jesse finally after another 10 minutes arrived with our food.  Food not bad but service this day --  our first time-- pathetic.  Food quality did not justified to us our returning to this place"}
{"text":"This place started out great, but they have changed there prices without warning. Not cool. They changed the alcohol prices as well.
Service is really terrible especially on the weekends it's powered by mommy and daddy for there little boy..
Food is OK but not for the prices don't see this place sticking around for much longer the word is out.. Nicks is a better alternative"}
{"text":"Was here for breakfast a few weeks ago and had a delicious meal ...heading back today to try some lunch . I thought the service was great and the atmosphere was nice . Quiet enough to have a conversation without the acoustic issues of some other local places. 
Looking forward to lunch ."}
{"text":"Great place, friendly staff. Much better than the restaurant it replaced. I've posted pictures of the food and the menu with descriptions. If you get cold easily though and it's not mid-summer, being something long sleeved because I was cold!"}
{"text":"The food was so good that I almost licked my plate!! Went here for dinner and had the senior chicken fried steak and the gravy was actually home made!! Hard to find s place that still makes it from scratch. The meat was tender enough to cut with a fork. The salad was fresh and dressing delicious. My husband had the open face beef sandwich and he said his was also very good. Prices were reasonable as well. 
Support this business so they survive as they were not very busy when we were there. That's a shame as it's hard to find a place with good food that's not a big chain."}
{"text":"Aside from dandy service from bartender McKenzie, this was a thoroughly mediocre experience."}
{"text":"Great service and the decor reminds me of a 50s diner.   We had a mix of breakfast and lunch,  tacos with eggs for breakfast and a hamburger cooked order. Nice family place,  nothing fancy but a nice warm feel."}
{"text":"After driving by many times, my better half and I decided to try Red Line Grill.

When we entered for lunch, the restaurant was a ghost town.  All except a local drunken man passed out on the bar.  Zero other patrons.
That should have been our sign to leave.

Food was absolutely not made in house.  Smelled of plastics and rubber.  Wait staff, ended up being the owners Mother, was quite abrupt and rude.

After talking to a few friends, we found the overall concensus to be quite negative.  Many other options in the neighborhood"}
{"text":"Pretty standard for Westside sports bar. Nothing exciting on the menu. Had a burger and it was cooked properly and fairly tasty. The service was average. The only real downer was the A/C that didn't really work. It was about 85 degrees in the dining room. The pie case is really weird for a sports bar."}
{"text":"It's my new favorite!  We have eaten here 4 times in the past month and everything has been wonderful!  The potato skins are by far the best I ever had."}
{"text":"Awesome skillet breakfast!  Tasty Bloody Mary too.  Highly recommend.  Meat lovers skillet + gravy = heaven."}
{"text":"The get one star because the food is actually really good. That's if you can actually get there to eat. I never known a business to close at random times. I went there on a Saturday night and they were already closed by 9pm. I called there yesterday to see if they were really going to be open until 10 like it says on here. The person who answered the phone informed me that they be doing last call at 8:45 and closing early. When you do finally manage to get them when they are open. The service sucks. Last time we were there the server took or order and never came back to our table until it was time to pay. We had to track someone else down to get refills and condiments for our food. I really like food but hate the service and the lack of consistency with the closing times."}
{"text":"I don't get it. If you think this place truly has great food please get in your car and drive 20 miles east. Stop at ANY restaurant and eat there.You will see what I mean. In any other city this place is 3 stars at best. I want this place to succeed but they need to please, try harder! The only thing we got that was actually good were the fries and beers. Everything else was awful. Fire whomever came up with the recipes and hire someone who knows good food. How about someone who knows knife skills? They didn't even cut veg right! No real chef who cared would ever allow that crap in their kitchen. I know I never did. This place could be good with a few major tweaks. They just need someone who knows to help them get there."}
{"text":"Love Redline. It just opened and we will be coming back. Food was great, atmosphere is great. It has a beautiful bar. Can say that they have the hottest wings in Surprise. If you want to start a fire in your mouth try the Formula 1 heat   Warning have a large glass of milk close by.  We will be back to try breakfast & lunch. Oh and the desserts are all homemade."}
{"text":"A lovely family owned buisness . Food very good and awesome quality. Everyone who works there is a delight. We definitely recommend trying this place out!!"}
{"text":"Not to bad of a place. Food is pretty decent. The spaghetti my dad had his comment was the parmesan cheese was \"interesting\" the waitress kept our drinks up pretty good. Not a bad joint."}
{"text":"Great service, really good food - the catfish (for the price) should come with 2 pieces and not 1.  Jessie was great and the pie was yummy!  So glad to have another local-owned restaurant to chose from in the sea of chain establishments in Surprise."}
{"text":"The service at Red Line is FAR better than the service at the previous deli that occupied this location. The manager is very friendly and always comes over to talk to us and give us hugs (very out of the norm for today's world). We have started frequenting this spot every Sunday for breakfast and definitely have our regular dishes. There rarely if ever is a wait, because I think most people are hesitant because of the experiences with the previous deli owner and his unwillingness to hear any type of feedback.  

I always get fresh toss with a side of home fries and  my partner always gets breakfast with extra meat. Always tastes great and we are always happy when we leave!"}
{"text":"Had lunch there today while I was on that side of town working, sat at the bar and was helped promptly by a girl \"Mackenzie\". Awesome server, fast polite and friendly...
Place was super clean and food was fantastic..I will go there again and hope too get the same server, as she was one of the best I have ever had .."}
{"text":"It's a decent place but nothing memorable. We have had both breakfast and lunch here. Breakfast was good and I would come back for that. The club sandwich was disappointing."}
{"text":"Had a late night dinner at this establishment, very good customer service. My dinner was excellent and well prepared. Everything at this establishment is made from scratch and is NOT processed food. Had the turkey sandwich, It was amazingly delicious! I will definitely be coming back to try there breakfast!"}
{"text":"Ate here last night. 
It wasn't terrible. 
They have a few things they need to sort out but that's to be expected for a new place. Waitstaff seems a little confused about the menu, food took awhile to come out and was a little cold and over cooked. 
Like l said I'm sure they'll work  these kinks out over time."}
{"text":"Not impressed. The burger was not great, the grilled chicken sandwich had some bad pieces and the gyros was bland and not authentic at all. Server said she gave us ketchup (to go order) but we actually had 15 packets of mayo. Had to eat our onion rings and fries without ketchup. The jalapeño poppers tasted moldy! So weird...."}
{"text":"Went last Sunday for breakfast at 9:30. Seating in the bar only since the dining room was full. Got drinks right away, then sat for 20 minutes waiting for someone to take our order. Finally the bartender came to take our order with our supposed waiter. 45 minutes later we asked where our food was as others had come in, eaten and left. The bartender checked and said something happened and she would 'put a rush on it '. We said to forget it and left. Obviously very unorganized. Won't go back."}
{"text":"I went to the red line grill this morning for breakfast and the food was excellent! And my waiter Nate was cute and courteous."}
{"text":"We had a great experience.   Talked to the owners for a long time.  The food was very good and we will be returning.  We always try to support family owned business."}
{"text":"Great spot... Bartender and wait staff seemed very attentive. Great place to stop. I tried the wings and they were good. Glad to see another spot to stop at in Surprise."}
{"text":"Great surprise! Came for lunch and had the club sandwich. Bread was toasted perfectly. Unlike some places where the bread is dry when toasted. This was not. Used thick cut bacon and was excellent! But the fries were how fries should be cooked. Crispy on the outside and soft inside. Some of the best I've had in a while. Also kept seeing dishes go by and saying I want to try that. Wife had the Cobb salad which had tons of chicken and bacon. 
Also has a huge breakfast menu. Will definitely come back and try that"}
{"text":"Great environment. Awesome food. Service is always spot on. I wish more people knew about this place."}
{"text":"Solid place and the server Debbie, was excellent. The manager was happy to sit us outside after I said I wanted to, after bringing our Dog (after a Vet appt). The staff was great, professional and accommodating, as I will definitely be back to this location. Also the food was hearty and home style cooking too with huge portions.

You have to try this location!

{"text":"My favorite Saturday morning tradition. Leanne is the best!breakfast is by far the best.  Great addition to Surprise!"}
{"text":"Had the opportunity to eat here a couple of times. Breakfast was good. I had a pancake, with hash browns and eggs. On a previous visit, I had the stuff tomato with chicken salad. Also had a cup of chili beans.
I expected the stuff tomato to be a salad. It was a large tomato stuffed with chicken salad, with peaches and onions on the side. The chicken salad was actually very good, and the peaches were amazing. I wasn't that impressed with the chili beans, to many beans for my liking. Food is decent, the decor is fun, and the servers are nice.
Now, they tend to have people working there  are having their kids there also. So kids are stirring up a commotion, they don't want to be there. If they can figure how to handle that, the experience will be better."}
{"text":"The food was very good. The ranch is homemade so that is a plus. The portions are large. I wasn't blown away by it. But I don't have any complaints either. We will go back."}
{"text":"Hello I went there today and had suck a great time the server Samantha  did a wonderful job if you get her you will see"}
{"text":"Just found this place and the hot buffalo wings are slightly smokey and taste great! Will be back for 50 cent wing Wednesday's!"}
{"text":"A great place for grilled foods.  I will be back this week to try the \"liver & onions.  The menu has a nice assortment of favorites."}
{"text":"Just had my second meal here in a week - and I'm a fan.  Breakfast on Sunday featured possibly the best California omelette I've ever had, with breakfast potatoes and FRESH fruit!  The coffee was great, too.  Then tonight I had the cabbage roll dinner special with corn chowder - all was delicious.  This is a family run place, and I've already had the chance to personally compliment Dad (the owner) and Mom (who clearly provides inspiration for the quality of the meals).  Really happy with the service, the food, the whole experience.  The only negative? Once word gets out about how great this place is, there'll be no more getting in without a wait."}
{"text":"Philly cheese steak sammich was incredible! Excellent cut of steak, no gristle, large portion. Plenty to choose from on the menu.  My Wife had the Spinach Salad and she raved about it. Very good food, enjoyed the patio seating although the music may have been just a little loud . Great service, Great prices too. Breakfast menu looks very inviting so that's next!!"}
{"text":"Amazing food! Great waitress! I had the gyro and I was blown away at the authentic Greek taste for a diner! Prices were decent as well!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed dinner and beers for a reasonable price. We will return. Had to move to the far side of the bar as we didn't expect music and wanted to talk. 

Liked the place enough to come in the next week for breakfast. Lots of food and yummy biscuits and gravy. Just enough spice and chunks of sausage, which is rare these days.

Last, the service both times was super. Servers were friendly and took my husbands jokes in stride (LOL)."}
{"text":"Went back to this place again last week. Had the boneless wings. Absolutely horrendous. Worst wings I've ever had. Not hot, all breading, didn't even taste like chicken. Won't be going back here ever again."}
{"text":"Dropped by the Red Line last night for a couple drinks and a light dinner. The place looks great and so happy they kept the large horseshoe shaped bar. Plenty of big screen tv's and a nice open well lighted atmosphere. Talked to the owners, Dimitri and his mother are the nicest most personable people you could ever meet. They seem to have a great business plan regarding both the brand and menu! Speaking of the menu when you go there a must have is the SOUP! Whatever the soup of the day is try it, they are all made from scratch. Talking to MOM about her menu she said we want to be like your home but we do the work!! Comfort food at its finest. Love the Vegetable beef soup and had the Ruben as well. This is one our new hangouts. PS they also have homemade pies and cakes check out the desert display, I gained four pounds just walking by it. Give it a try, they just opened up so I'm sure there will be growing pains but not from what we experienced. Best of luck!"}
{"text":"Just checked out this place and was really impressed. Service is great! I'm a car guy and the theme of this place is hot rods and race cars. Tons of TVs with many different games up made it fun to watch. They have darts and various things to try. 
Try the wings with maple bacon sauce! Yum"}
{"text":"Had a great time last night at Red Line Grill! Gilson and I headed over about 6:30 last night and had a very nice dinner there! Huge place with a massive sports style bar, large televisions in every room, and a very friendly staff. Menu was very nice with everything from B-fast to a wonderful dinner menu and great selection of cakes and pies! Even some wonderful Greek food! 

Anyone who is in the NW part of the valley needs to stop by and check this new restaurant out! Easy to find and LOTS of parking!  Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Really cool place to bring my wife and kids to hang and great food. This is our second visit on 2 weeks and they remembered us and our first orders impressive! They are clean and mildly entertaining not too over the top. I would recommend redline to anyone who wants to hang with friends or family or even alone it's such a chill atmosphere. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Came here multiple times with friends and family while visiting Surprise. The food was excellent for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. The menu is surprisingly (see what I did there) extensive, and the chefs are awesome about modifying any order. The portion sizes are killer as well, and the food has a level of freshness and taste many levels above your typical American grill fare. Great place for families also, with three distinct seating sections. Would definitely recommend for anyone visiting the area, or for any locals who have not been"}
{"text":"Wow! Hidden gem in surprise! Our new favorite breakfast spot. With a large patio to the north, diner-style seating, and enormous bar, everyone's comfortable.  Large, huge breakfast portions! Gotta try the sweet potato pancakes!  

The \"classic\" is a great deal with three eggs any style with two sides!  I get mine with bacon which is amazing! Thick-cut, smoked bacon and they give you four pieces! Only $8.99 for three eggs, home frys, a sweet potato pancake and four slices of bacon?   Hell yes!

This is one of the only places in Surpruse where you can enjoy an adult beverage with breakfast.  They have a full bar and it's open all day.

The service is always on point.  I sure hope this place sticks around because we really enjoy it."}
{"text":"My mom & I LOVE this place. The fish is excellent, along with their corn beef & Reuben's. The liver & onions are great. Will totally come back again. The wait staff are exceptional!! Great place!!"}
{"text":"We heard good reviews about Red Line Grill so wanted to try it out.  We arrived around 7pm for dinner, and found a really dirty restaurant - tables un-bussed, dirty floor, dirty bathrooms.  The service was incredibly slow, even though there was a table of waiters and/or management sitting in a corner.  We ordered several items, including the Reuben sandwich, which was just awful.  One of our party ordered a salad and it arrived with lots of lettuce but other items sort of thrown on top.  He didn't bother finishing it.  The fried were greasy, but we were so hungry that we ate them, and had indigestion later.  All over, we were sorely disappointed with food and service and cleanliness.  Too bad, as we would like to like this restaurant."}
{"text":"1st time here. Had the states best Bloody Mary with biscuits and gravy breakfast. 
Will become a regular. Staff very attentive and facilities immaculate 
Well worth my drive to visit"}
{"text":"Had a delicious lunch there today.  First visit and can hardy wait to go back. Family owned and operated by a extremely nice Greek family.  Our server was Nick...a wonderful young man, ( one of the sons ).The portions are very substantial and the menu extensive.  Comfortable booths, also tables.  It's light an bright and sparkling clean. The sports bar is separate from the restaurant.    Had the chicken fried steak...delicious...another friend had the baked catfish, she said  was excellent and the third lady had the pork chop...also delicious.  Extremely generous salad ( two of us had salad ) One had the huge bowl of chicken noodle soup.  They have only been open for two months.  I wish them much success!"}
{"text":"We went there for the first time last weekend on Friday night and it was really good. Our party of 10 sat in the bar and we were promptly served, all the drinks were cold and spot on. I had the fish and chips and it was absolutely perfect. Coleslaw was really good, portions are huge. Hubby had a Gyro and he liked it very much. Others in our group seemed happy and satisfied. Will definitely go back again."}
{"text":"I was here for vacation and yelp suggested this place for breakfast. I just wanted basic eggs/bacon so nothing fancy.  We decided to sit outside because it was nice out and quieter than being inside. We got our drink order as we sat down and then were forgotten for the rest of the meal.  After our server dropped off the coffee she disappeared and never came back. We finished our coffee and wondered if anyone would be coming to get our order and contemplated just leaving altogether.  Another server showed up but didn't notice our empty cups.  He took our order and started to walk away so we had to stop him to ask for more coffee. He dropped a carafe off and brought us our food when it was done.  He didn't bother to bring any condiments out which we noticed sitting on other tables.  We had to get sugar from another table as well because that wasn't brought to us.  It's little things like that on top of being forgotten that made this a negative experience. I wished we had the other server who was waiting on the other outside tables because she was on it.  We watched her come back and check on her customers several times. We just got the short end of the service stick."}
{"text":"Oh my Surprise AZ we finally have a good place to eat !! Fresh , really good food ! Clean , nice staff . Love the wings. Try it u will be surprised how good it is ."}
{"text":"I wish I lived in surprise cause this place is awesome!! Whenever I find myself out that way I stop in for a bite and a pint.. food is amazing and you couldn't ask for better service.. shout out to Bree the bartender.. Everyone in the area should check this place out.."}
{"text":"One of the best sports bars in Surprise. I haven't had a bad meal out of anything I've tried. Taco Tuesday's steak tacos are great, Wing Wednesday is great also. Prices are fair and not overpriced. If you're a fan of a sports bar, stop here and you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"After reading the great reviews, we were really excited to try the Red Line Grill.  What a disappointment. The service was really slow.  We watched an entire episode of AFV before our food came.  We both didn't get what we ordered and when we pointed it out, the server said \" Oh, I am really sorry.  We are training a new cook and I will let him know so it doesn't happen again\".  ???  We are retired restaurant owners from San Francisco and we would never have responded like that.  The food was just ok.  We won't be returning."}
{"text":"Decided to Check this place out since it's gotten good reviews. Service was great but the food was just OK. We came here on a Tuesday night wss no crowd, So there wasn't a wait. We started with cheese sticks which were overcooked because they came out very very Very dark with a lot of the cheese already squeezing out. I ordered a hamburger made it a bacon cheeseburger and Kayla ordered the philly cheese , she was not very impressed she said the meat was dry. My burger was just OK , but it's really hard to screw up a burger . I may come back and tried again but right now I'm not real sure. I only write this place 3 stars because the food was just mediocre."}
{"text":"Great service, great food, great atmosphere! We went for brunch, I had the California omelette. It was delicious! I loved the car theme. And the country music!"}
{"text":"We ordered burgers that were supposed to be medium done and they came well done, very dry burgers. I love BBQ sauce but this is the first time I've ever had any that tasted so awful. We told the waitress when she asked if we needed a box that no as the burgers were not medium done and that they were to dry and rubbery. She comes back and said they took 15 percent of the burgers as they wanted us to come back! Are you kidding me?? Only 15 percent ( $1.60 off each burger!) no thanks, definitely not coming back here"}
{"text":"I have been eating here regularly since moving to the area. I am rather pleased with the food and service. Being a car guy - I also like the various LS engine parts and whatnot hanging on the walls.

The breakfast omelets (I like the Iowa) and the French toast is good. I also like the Club Sandwich and 1/2lb burgers.

I cannot comment on the bar side, as I always prefer to sit on the normal side.

The only real complaint I have is they allow smoking on the patio area. As someone who is allergic - this was quite the surprise when I was sitting outside and another customer smoked 7 (yes, 7) cigarettes during the course of my meal."}
{"text":"Ordered the Reuben as I heard from a prior visitor that it was the best she had ever had. That's a pretty tall order for me coming from NY. It's was freakin' excellent. Not fatty and they make the corned beef there. The bread it comes on is not grocery store bread either. A tad thicker, but it has flavor and makes the sandwich. Also ordered the  wings with an Old Bay rub. Very flavorful and didn't need the dip. Highly recommend this place especially as more restaurants don't do the cooking anymore and just use frozen or prepackaged products."}
{"text":"From the time we walked in the service was great. It was very busy, but we were seated right away. I had the Philly cheesesteak at it was great. Fries were crispy not soggy and our kids loved the Waiter. My son and husband had the chicken fried steak and the both said it was awesome as well. We will definitely be back. I hope this restaurant succeeds."}
{"text":"Love this place! Excellent food, prices and customer service. The best part is very kid friendly, I love how my kids got served 1st too. We tried breakfast and lunch and all 5 of us had no complaints as everything was cleared off their plates. :)"}
{"text":"I don't know why we waited so long to try this place but glad we finally did!!  Our server was very attentive and the portions were both plentiful AND delicious!!!  Can't wait to come back soon to try their lunch menu."}
{"text":"I will never step foot in this establishment again!! Earlier today someone posted on a Surprise FB page about their bad experience with the service today and the owner \"Stefania Maridaki Papamatheakis\" seemed to not care for the critique and out of no where states \"What I'm talking about negative. We are here talking about what a lady thought was bad service and a child is in the hospital dying of cancer\"  After making excuses and denying poor service she stoops to shaming and guilting people for complaining by bringing up a dying child (who was never mentioned in any other post or comment BTW) I also posted a screenshot of some of the post. When you get complaints you should try to turn the critics into fans but they are choosing to attack the guests and try to guilt us into feeling like horrible service is ok."}
{"text":"Went there for early dinner. Wife had the grilled chicken sandwich with sweet potato fries. She really enjoyed it. I had the corn beef sandwich with regular fries. The sandwich left me an \"oh well\" feeling. Regular fries good! Service good. Server good. I would not have the corn beef sandwich again. Let me say it was really tender, but no pizzazz."}
{"text":"The cafe had a nice menu with plenty of options. My wife ordered a Philly sandwich and my rubin was the Best Rubin sandwich EVER! Their sweet potatoes frys were the best we have had. Must have been home cut. Nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Nice Saturday meal!  Great Pastrami and the special of ribs and chicken was super tasty.  We came by since we first heard of them at Taste of Surprise.  Not too many people in there for a Saturday night which makes me hope they can stick around.  Service was excellent, great variety on the jukebox and the decor was charming."}
{"text":"Great food but service was slow. Only 2 groups in restaurant but took 10 minutes to have our order taken after drinks.
NOTE TO OWNER.  We almost left before going in because you looked close.  All the shudders on the restaurant side were closed. Combine that with tint on the windows and the place looked deserted.
UPDATE:
Went back this morning for breakfast.  Outstanding service from Jesse!  Excellent food again."}
{"text":"Great variety of foods on the menu. Breakfast served till 3pm, would like to see all day.

Prices are reasonable. 

Hostess was outstanding.  Server was just so so. 

We went for lunch Sat. 10/14.
Will probably return... Hopefully a different server... LOL"}
{"text":"This has become my FAVORITE place in Surprise! ... For Breakfast, the home made corn beef hash has LOTS of onions and green peppers in it, and price is right. (If you get the side dish, make sure to ask for the extra veggies.) ... For dinner, their beef chili with onions is GREAT! ... They've got Lagunitas IPA on tap, with pitchers for less than $7. (It's not a big selection, but Lagunitas is one of my favorites, so who cares about the rest of the selection?) ... The staff here is GREAT, especially Brianna, one of, if not THE best bar tender I've ever met ANYWHERE! Her work ethic is AWESOME! ... There are a number of other VERY attractive people working here, as well. ... The restaurant and bar area are spacious, the bar is U-shaped, so you can see who's at the bar rather than staring at a wall of booze. The place is VERY clean and well appointed. There are several activities here if you get bored. ... The co-owner, Voula, is VERY nice and is a Great Chef, as her husband is cool too. (I have to ask his name.) ... I've met several very interesting people here (customers), and it's a very \"social\" clientele. ... I can easily spend all day here. ... If you're into TV, there are over a dozen of them! ... Only drawback here is I have to work on my computer a lot, and sometimes the music is really loud (even during the day, but not always), but that's what earplugs are for!"}
{"text":"Friendly service. The server was great.  The food was average. My husbands medium well burger with a hard fried egg came well done with a runny egg.  Totally backwards. The clam chowder was really good and the fries were good.  The fried cod was a little over cooked I think. This was our first time here, not sure if we will try it again. Not bad but there is better out there.  The place is also pretty empty for a Friday night at 6:45."}
{"text":"Awesome.......this is our new favorite restaurant in Surprise.  At last a family owned place with nice servers instead of the crappy chain places with their bad attitudes and blah, overpriced food.
The first night we came we had wings,  club sandwich and spaghetti,  kids had chicken strips and Mac and cheese.....fantastic. 
Second night,  we had the mozzarella sticks and chicken strips, followed by a 1/2lb Burger with avocado, egg and cheese....best Burger in town. 
We absolutely love this place...and the kicker......it's very inexpensive.  Family of 6 with 3 kids.... $75 before tip 
Pay this place a visit......you will not be disappointed"}
{"text":"I really wanted to be blown away by this place, I have been coercing my wife for months to give it a shot. We finally ventured in for breakfast last Sunday... I hate it when she is right.

First, I must say the staff and service was VERY timely and attentive, they were friendly and smiling and we have no gripes whatsoever about the service. We had a few snags in our dining experience however... first, half of the coffee creamers were frozen solid, which means they are keeping them cold, but maybe that they did not pay very much attention when putting them into a bowl and bringing them to the table, overlook-able, but worth mentioning. The portions were a good size, and the Toast was thick, fresh, and a pleasant surprise, no problem there. Biggest let down was my wife's biscuit being dry and crumbling apart, which was a let down, seeing as how it looked like it was made in house. 

I thought the food was ok, maybe borderline good, I got a meat lovers omelette and it had A LOT of meat in it, which I will never complain about, but it really felt like if was just some scrambled eggs folded over the ingredients, not really \"built to order\" omelette-like, if that makes any sense. The hashbrowns were buttery, but probably could have been a little more \"browned\" on the outside...it was a big serving, so I was happy, I swear I'm not a foodie.

Like I said, I wanted to really like this place, but it didn't do it for me this time. I might try again and sit in the bar area for some football and breakfast next time and maybe it will change my mind. Kudos to the friendly staff, I hope to see you again and be wooed."}
{"text":"Breakfast was good, but it's tough to screw up eggs, hash browns and toast. I was the only guest there for the duration of my meal at 830 on a Monday morning. A little concerning being that it's located near so many retirement communities. I'll give it one more shot though."}
{"text":"Came in to try the food today the bacon was amazing highly recommend. Do yourself a favor and request Lee Ann  server"}
{"text":"Had a great breakfast! Fantastic food at a great price! Happy hour from 11-7! They have great hash browns, and dress up the food. Check it out, I don't think you'll be dissapointed!"}
{"text":"Went here a couple times for brunch.  Good food, acceptable price.  I always enjoyed the chili &/or wings, although my wife enjoyed most of the skillets.  Nothing I would stay away from."}
{"text":"Breakfast this morning. We started w/ the smoked bacon ribs. They tasted like smoked ham on a rib. Very moist and flavorful, my first time having them, I really enjoyed them. We also had a half order of the biscuits and country gravy. The biscuits were light and flaky. The gravy was good but could use more pepper and a bit more herb flavor. P had the corned beef hash. The waitress asked if he wanted peppers and onions, he asked for onions but there weren't any upon delivery. No big deal, he still enjoyed it. The home fries, sour bread toast and eggs were all spot on. I had the chicken fried steak, eggs and hash browns. Steak was standard, good but not great due to the just average gravy. I asked that my hash to be extra crispy. When the waitress was delivering my plate she noticed they were not crispy and said she would be right back w/ my plate. The cook had taken the hash and dropped them into the fryer. Although they tasted like the potato sticks from the can, I wasn't too bent. I would just suggest not doing that again as a standard practice. I had ordered a hot cocoa but never received it. I actually forgot about it so no big deal. Overall I consider it a good meal and will return. I always give new places a pass as long as the food is good, just kinks to work out. All the waitresses were super friendly and hard working. The decor is pleasant."}
{"text":"Wow, love it! New everything. Wife and I stopped in for dinner and because it was before 4 pm the full staff hadn't arrived yet so the 2 servers had their hands full but it wasn't a problem, lots of TV's, I'm glad they gutted the place and started fresh, Archies was a bit dated and showing age. Had a good experience, try it out."}
{"text":"I have yet to actually sit down and dine. But I don't think I'll get the chance to. I bought a Groupon and tried to go on a Wednesday around 7pm and the doors were locked. I then called about a fight they were showing and they told me 20$ a person. I showed up and they raised the prices to 40$ a person. And they didn't even have any seats open.. 40$ a person to stand and watch a fight..."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here to grab a quick lunch. He ordered a regular gyro and I ordered chicken gyro. Along with our food came peppercinis (My favorite btw!). All was going well, our gyros were good for an American version. Then...I made a horrible mistake. I decided to bite into the peppercini, this thing was putrid. The only way I can describe it is it taste and smelled as if it were soaked in a trash can filled with urine. (I'm not joking). The juice has fallen on my plate and the putrid odor was so bad that I could not finish the rest of my food without wanting to vomit. I informed the owners mother and she proceeded to smell a peppercini, then made the same horrible mistake I did. SHE TOOK A BITE AND SPIT IT OUT! Overall food was ok, service was fine as long as you aren't expecting much it's a good place to grab a quick bite. But please, don't eat the peppercinis! Hopefully they will dispose of those vile things ASAP."}
{"text":"Great service. Waitress, Kimberly, seated us and took our drink order right away. She let us choose where to sit and was friendly the entire time. Also, very efficient and checked in at the right times. Menu is expansive with great choices. The mozzarella sticks were tasty and came with meat sauce so make sure to say no meat in the marinara if you can't have it. I personally like meat sauce. We also ordered fries for $1.99 extra with the appetizer (mozzarella sticks) and they gave us a lot of fries! Fries were tasty, too. We also ordered the gyro sandwich with onion rings. Onion rings are delicious! Top 3 I've tasted. The gyro meat was really good with crispy edges and the pita bread was also tasty and butter toasted. We will definitely come back. Service from Kimberly=5 and food from cooks=5."}
{"text":"I dunno with this one.  Been here several times after it appeared in the old Archies location.  Some prices are a bit much.  Service (and food) is better in the morning than in the evening.  Would be great if they would serve their breakfast menu all day, as I find it to be their high point.   Hopefully it will get better and stick around, they seem to have good intentions, server attitudes are really hit or miss though."}
{"text":"First time here we will be back 
So good forgot to take pics
Liver and onions
Chicken fried steak gravy mash potatoes clam chowder 
Had my fav Wycliffe champagne on
Happy hour 
Senior discount 
all good 
Excellent service Kimber"}
{"text":"To start with, I am giving four stars because I have only been here for breakfast...yes breakfast (three times), so I can't really give a five star rating.

This is a racing theme restaurant and the decor is done tastefully in red/silver diamond plate. There are car parts and signs scattered about and the restrooms are the Pit Stop. The Pit Stop divides the place into two sections; a traditional sit down dining space and a bar area complete with dart boards, jukebox, and of course the bar. It is a clean space, which I thoroughly appreciate.

About that breakfast:

Their \"classic\" plates are served with three eggs, and two sides of your choice. To that you can add a variety of meats (burger, corned beef hash, gyro meat, etc...) and I guarantee you won't leave hungry. They also have a choice of skillets, omelettes, waffles and other fare-- plus you can order lunch any time.

Be very careful with the wings, \"hot\" here is a lot hotter than the average wing, and they get hotter to the point that you may not be able to eat them. I prefer this to bland \"hot wings\" any day, and you can always order medium, a dry rub or one of their sweeter sauces (sweet chili or Greek for example).

We have sat at the bar every time and the service there was exceptional.

They have nice Bloody Mary's with bacon in them, but they need to have more bacon ready. 
We were a group of eight, and they had to start cutting the bacon into pieces which is just lack of preparation.

We will definitely be back, even though this is a 12 mile drive for us."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a midweek breakfast last month at this new place and loved it. Great price and good quality food for what we ordered. The server seemed a bit busy and maybe overwhelmed but u would never knw it with her service! She was friendly and attentive. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Had a great Reuben for dinner then game back for a Greek omelette for breakfast. I recommend both."}
{"text":"Great choice for breakfast. Menu choices for the budget conscious and for those who are looking for creative combinations. Our experience with the servers have been great. A lot of good personality."}
{"text":"Went to watch a band play on June 2nd. Food was good, bar area is good sized. Location also has an attached dining area. Theme of the place is racing and has a cool atmosphere."}
{"text":"Everything we had here was fantastic. I got the Steak sandwich and it was moist and delicious. My dad got the Liver and Onions and said it was the best he's had in Az. His order came with a huge bowl (not a dinky cup) of beef vegetable soup. It was outstanding. We will return to try more things on the menu here very soon."}
{"text":"We ate here last night, Samantha was out waitress and was really nice, she came around often, and when the adults were still deciding what we wanted she suggested putting in the kids food order  first. Which was a great idea for the starving children we had with us. The dinner was good, no one had any complaints about the food. There was just some little things the resulted in 4 stars! I really enjoyed that this is a local restaurant in surprise and I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Service was slow this afternoon. We had hamburgers my husband order the 1/2 lb and I went smaller. They were the same size :(. Onion rings were good. Soda tasted off. Ordered extra crispy bacon for my burger sadly it wasn't even close."}
{"text":"EXCELLENT!!  PERFECTLY cooked comfort food!  We have found our new favorite place!  We had country fried steak and liver & onions at our table.  We have to go back to try more things!"}
{"text":"What a fabulous find this was tucked away right off Bell.! The first time we went it was curiosity that brought us in and the search to find a great place to have breakfast. First of all the waitress Debbie was one of the best we've had here in Arizona. She made us feel welcome , took care of all our needs and had us laughing to boot. No , a waitress alone can't bring people back, but when you have a great waitress, delicious food and fair prices most likely they'll be back. It's also nice to see owners on the premises and interacting with their customers .this is a winner!"}
{"text":"We have been here three times for lunch and every time it has been great. A bowl of soup that I had to split and have the rest at dinner along with the other half of my Cobb salad. My husband loved his omelet. Great service and great food. Maybe I'll go back tomorrow."}
{"text":"What a hidden gem!  We went for lunch and had excellent food.  My husband had chicken friesd steak and I had a turkey sandwich.  Huge portions and delicious!  Fun decor and the service was excellent.  We spoke with the owner who was very pleasant.  The huge Bar on the other side caught our eye on the way out.  We will definately go back to check out happy hour and game day fun!"}
{"text":"This is a neighborhood diner. Went there for the first time last night.  The place is fairly large and auto themed. Service was very good and friendlly. The food was good, not great but good. We had the motzerella sticks that were served with a marinara sauce for dipping. Then a hamburger and a gyro sandwich with fries and onion rings. Everything was fine. The onion rings however were outstanding, great light batter freshly cooked. I've been to several such diners in the area and they all are about the same. You get good food, nothing fancy, good sized servings and a pleasant experience. If you want a farm to table place, this isn't it but for what it is, it's ok."}
{"text":"Fun place! Food is good as well as the service. Flat screens all around. Desert looks great but alway too full. One day soon....."}
