{"text":"Having read raves I decided to eat at Sea Witch on a quiet Lunch hour. 
There was  only  one other diner and about five staff.

No big deal being served , right?

Not that there was much effort to break off conversation and speak to me as I waited for a welcome. Finally ordered and having confirmed with the pleasant cashier that yes I would like tartar sauce, I was then asked by two different servers if I happened to want tartar sauce. 

It seems that the staff don't pay much attention.

 I told the last one that I had been asked twice already and received no reply, though in the end the sauce was supplied.

Pacific haddock was tasty but more batter than fish and the chips were lukewarm, far from piping hot as they need to be for taste and texture.

Slackness kills reputations, the decor and concept are good but the execution left much to be desired."}
{"text":"We order the 2 in 1 halibut with poutine and slaw on the side.  The portion is huge.  The slaw and poutine tasted good, especially the slaw was seasoned well.  They gave us and extra piece of fish as one of the piece was small.  The fish tasted fresh and meaty and it went well with the tartar sauce.  I did find there were a little bit parts of the fish was dry.  The service was good as the server were knowledgable to explain how each of the fish tastes. They only accept cash. visa and m/c."}
{"text":"The portion is huge but mostly fries and less fish. Coleslaw and tartar sauce needs to be ordered as a side. This can make their less expensive dish $10 go up to $15+. The sides should be included. The fish and chips definitely needed the tartar sauce to help cut all the grease. It's ok, not sure I'd go back."}
{"text":"We decided to try this place out after hearing so many good reviews. We got an order of halibut and chips at MP which was 17, yeah a bit steep however it was delicious! 
Service was very good and I have to say definitely the best in the city thus far, I use to be a huge fan of harbord fish and chips but Sea Witch was epic! The fries were really good - definitely fresh oil. 

For me it's the little things like the way the server was packaging another order for uber, the care they put speaks volumes and it certainly shows in their food.
I'll be back!"}
{"text":"This place is HANDS DOWN the BEST CHIPPY IN THE CITY (despite not having mushy peas) - The staff have always been friendly to me (I live 2 streets away) since day one, their Chips are DYNAMITE delicious, their onion rings are heavenly... The cod & halibut are off the charts... Homemade gravy & coleslaw are always a good extra! Just come here and enjoy. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Excellent fish and chips.  I'm from the UK and have lived in Toronto for 16 years and this is the only one that finally nails it.  Fresh, great quality fish and chips and good portions to justify the price, which turns out to be very reasonable based on what you get.  Well done.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"rip off

i ordered a take out halibut fish and chips meal and what i got was a box full of fries and a tiny piece of fish for 18$ ."}
{"text":"Good customer service. Decent prices. Ordered the haddock and chips, chips were ok. Nothing special. The batter on my fish wash insanely thick, and heavy... I couldn't finish my portion of fish, I literally dug unbattered pieces of fish out because it was so oily... the batter doesn't taste like fish and chip batter either, not very well seasoned and tastes like Tiny Tom carnival donuts... overall not the most pleasant meal but the fish was fresh from what I could tell, probably won't be dining here again though."}
{"text":"Nice place. Friendly people

I like the fries... Thick cut. Fish was good, but slightly small. However I like the place and the food"}
{"text":"St. Clair west needed a place like this. I got the halibut and rings which were delicious. The fish was cooked perfectly with a lite batter just the way I like it. It came with a tower of rings that were also lightly battered, there is nothing better than ordering battered food and tasting what's inside rather than the batter on the outside. The service was quick and the staff were very friendly. Check this place out, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Sea Witch tonight for dinner.  I'm suuuuuuper pregnant and today is actually my due date.  Pretty exciting.  Pretty pumped to eat some fish and chips in our new 'hood.  Celebrate what is possibly our last day as non-zombie parents.  Happy day happy day!

Walked up to the door of Sea Witch...slowly because I'm as big as a damn house, and the dude literally locks the door in our face.  Just looks at us and shrugs.  Seriously?  Seriously?!  It was exactly 8pm, and a couple of non-preggos with fully functional bodies walked in an were seated not one minute before us.  I just couldn't get there fast enough.  It takes me 10 minutes to get out of bed right now.  Cut a girl some slack.

Cold, dude.  Cold.  So thanks for making this hugely pregnant woman cry on her due date (because fat preggos cry over literally everything).  Now I'm at home waiting for delivery pizza, and will never come back to Sea Witch.

Also to the dude that locked the door in our faces and just shrugged like 'whoops, the door is locked foreverzzzzzz', I hope that you're a woman in your next life and get super fat and people are mean to you."}
{"text":"Huge, truly huge portions. The best coleslaw I've ever had. Perfect fries and fish that come straight from the fryer to your table. And the staff are friendly and truly courteous (which is harder to find these days). A nice range of customers: older folk, hipsters and families with little  ones. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Shared a two & one haddock fish & chips, so many chips (even though it was supposed to be a small portion)! Chips are some of the best we have had in a while, and the fish was SILKY SMOOTH!!!! Fried to perfection, and huge as well! 
Great staff, very friendly and warm! Some of the other diners were elderly, some with kids, a great mix of folks! 
Small, cute restaurant, with some bigger tables in the middle if you had a bigger party."}
{"text":"The batter was like half a cm thick so I couldn't taste anything other than oil. Everything was just saturated in fryer oil.. Waste of a good fish in my opinion.  Service was amazing so 3 stars for that."}
{"text":"If you are a Fish and Chips connoisseur, you will love this place. Great fish and chips. Fresh cooked and crispy. No yucky greasy taste. Great fries just made from fresh cut potato. Best fish and chips I've had in a long time. The coleslaw and the tartar were basic and only okay. The star here is the fish. 
Love the decor and the staff were friendly. This is a great spot."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Had the haddock and chips, onion rings and coleslaw.  The batter was amazingly crispy, the service was super friendly. Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"Try the char sandwich and the halibut poutine. Right now!

I've been in a few times and Sea Witch has never let me down. I've tried a number of items on their menu and they have surpassed my expectations every single time.

The portions are very generous. I rarely can finish a meal by myself, but the prices are very reasonable for a fish and chips shop, which tempts me into getting too much every time. They do have an option called \"Two and a Few\" for an extra piece of fish with fewer chips, which I'll likely get next time. If you're looking for something a bit lighter, the chowder is perfect for satisfying your fishy cravings. 

The decor is quaint and there is plenty of seating for such a small place. Everyone I've met on staff has been lovely!

A restaurant like this was long overdue on St. Clair West."}
{"text":"We enjoyed it!  The fish was excellent - nice light tempura-style batter;  the  fries were good, not amazing but good.  Love the decor, which features a lot of upcycled old wood, including pews from the recently deconsecrated church nearby.  Definitely fills a niche in this neighbourhood!"}
{"text":"Great service, fresh excellent fish and chips, cute decor... reasonably priced- what more could you want? Love this spot!"}
{"text":"I won't be visiting again, was very disappointed. The fish was mostly batter and over cooked and hard, u don't get enough tartar sauce for order and if you want more you have to pay for it, the only good thing about this place is the fresh cut fries. I will make the drive to golden crisp on weston rd anytime I feel for fish n chips."}
{"text":"My gf and I went in, after hearing great things.

We had the onion rings and split the 2 and a few. We were very full. .Ffish was breaded perfectly and very tasty... The onion rings were the stand-out winner. Try the rings for sure.

Service was excellent, and there were a LOT of staff on hand. Very refreshing for this neighbourhood. 

Will be back for sure, but only as a treat... EVERYTHING is deep friend, but that's what you go for."}
{"text":"I don't like writing negative reviews and so give places three tries before I do.  Try #3 was last week.  The chowder was glumpy and bland--too much flour and not enough fish.  The fish was edible but not memorable.  They seem to use a panko concoction for breading but because it's slow to get to your table, the crunch goes out of it.  The fries are o.k but again, slow service means they're a bit limp by the time they get to you.  Oh, and the coleslaw--flavourless, with a back-of-the-fridge-for-several-weeks texture.  For two people, the bill comes in at over $40 and it just isn't worth it, especially when there is much better food for less in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Pretty tasty and fresh. The good thing, the chips are piping hot when served, and fish size is a good portion.  Prices are comparable these days to other spots -if you want Halibut you're gonna pay more, but for the price point you do get a good size.  The fish has a golden crunchy crust.. Me, personally im more of the softer, lighter batter, (for example - served at high street fish and chips), each to their own. However, the flavor was good, not too greasy. Clean establishment and friendly staff."}
{"text":"The fish and chips are good.

The chips are fresh cut potatoes.

The poutine is not good, so stay away from that."}
{"text":"The food was very good but the service was horrendous! I walked in 30 minutes to close and asked for a table for two. As soon as I was seated, the lady at the front started to complain that I was given a seat so close to closing. This already put a sour taste in my mouth as she made it quite clear that we weren't welcome in her establishment. But what happened near the end of our meal, is not only the reason for this review but also the reason I will never go back nor recommend this restaurant to anyone!

A man came in roughly 5 minutes to close and wanted to place an order. The guy at the front asked what he wanted. He replied fish and chips. The gentleman was being fairly loud but it wasn't evident to me yet that he was intoxicated. The server then clarified the order and told him the price and asked if he had money. This was somewhat rude, but I understood given the situation. He then explained to the gentleman that he needed to step outside and he would come and get the money from him. This is where it went downhill. 

The server rather rudely explained that he wasn't allowed in the restaurant due to his intoxication, but he was still willing to give him his food if he waited outside. At this point the lady behind the counter stuck her nose in to see what was going on. She very clearly did not know how to handle the situation and started freaking out that she could not have him in her restaurant and that she could not serve him. She went back and forth between allowing him to be served but rudely decided to kick him out of the restaurant instead. This man did not act out at all, he was intoxicated and simply wanted a meal!

After being kicked out, the staff had a quick huddle and the woman who kicked the gentleman out was smiling, proud of the work she had just done and her staff were laughing! Of course the gentleman came back in, yelling now about what she had just done to him. Which is totally understandable given how she handled the situation. That man would not have made a fuss had that woman not treated him the way she did.

After the whole situation went down, a customer called the lady over and told her how impressed she was with how she handled the situation. Clearly neither of these two knew anything about hospitality and customer service. What bothered me even more was that this was \"Good Friday\", an extremely important day in the Christian religion and what I was witnessing was so disheartening. 

My advice simply would be, work on your service and hospitality. The food is great but that service is the reason I wrote this review!"}
{"text":"Tasty, crispy battered fish. Best fluffy onion rings I've had in the city. 
I appreciate that they tell you how long the wait is.
Their fish and chips rival Poppies in East London. The only thing I miss is mushy peas, though I may be in the minority there! 
 Also, unlike some others I respect closing hours. Please, the people who work in restaurants have lives too and businesses have hours for a reason."}
{"text":"A tip for the wise: come hungry.

I had the pickerel sandwich with chips, and my partner had the halibut cakes, also with chips.  The fish portions are pretty big, and the chips are the thick-cut steak frites style.  My Significant Other also ordered a side of the curry sauce (also pretty big) for the chips.

The fish is really crispy, which is how I like it.  The sandwich is served on what seems like a ciabatta-style bun, with a sweet tartar sauce and pickled onions.  All in all, the taste combination is excellent, however, the onions can at times seem a bit overwhelming.  Next time I might ask for them on the side.  The fish cakes were a decent size, and served with a side of the same pickled onions, although minced.  The curry sauce was an excellent accompaniment to the chips.

We went on a Wednesday, so it wasn't very crowded and we were able to get a seated right away.  Service is fine; it isn't doting, but they are attentive.  All in all, this is so far some of the best fish and chips I've had in the city.  I'll be going back."}
{"text":"Toronto has no lack of good fish and chip shops.  The ones that use beef fat to fry are very far and few between.  Penrose is gone.  Malt and Salt is very far east.  But, the Sea Witch; bravo!  You know how to fry things.  

We had halibut, cod, fries, and onion rings.  The onion rings were OMFG perfect.  I LOVE LOVE LOVE onion rings and very few places make a good one AND give you enough of them.  The batter was great.  I wished the fish pieces were bigger for the price.  Also, I have had much better quality cod at the Abbott.  The fries were tasty. ( I have a preference for thicker chips).  The tartar was made in house and quite good.  No nasty wing's packets here.  I like the decoration of the place, and the various mags and books to read.  The staff are all cool, hip, and friendly.  I will definitely be back again for those onion rings, even though I don't live in the hood."}
{"text":"Clean, cozy, yummy little fish & chips spot with good selection of halibut, haddock, cod & pickerel. Best F&C I've had so far in Toronto; 3rd best in Ontario. Warm decor with interesting books along the walls, booths, and a long wooden table down the middle perfect for families. 

Hubby & I shared the HADDOCK 2 & 1 (2 big pieces of haddock + 1 order of fries) +upgrade to POUTINE & 1 order of SLAW. Delicious!!  Large, thick pieces of flaky fish with puffy-crispy-golden batter that ranges from delicate to crunchy without being overly greasy.  POUTINE served blistering hot with melty curds and well balanced gravy (not too dark, not too salty, not too fake-beefy). Fries nice and chunky (but not too chunky), just wish they were crispier. Next time will ask for EXTRA crispy. SLAW was also great (not too vinegary, not too creamy). TARTAR SAUCE seems house-made (tasty but a bit thin).

Staff (owner?) were warm and knowledgeable. Really happy to see the ***OCEAN WISE*** partnership logo on their site!   Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Possibly the best fish and chips you can find in town. Fish is fresh, the batter tastes amazing and is perfectly crispy, the fries are delicious and portion sizes are huge for the price. My only complaint is that there is too much batter on the fish and there are pockets that do not actually have any fish, just plain batter. Do not underestimate the amount of fries you get with your order! We ordered two pieces of fish with one fries for two people and it was more than enough."}
{"text":"Paid $17 for the halibut .. Small portion of fish and the batter was chewy ... Plate was full of fries that it actually turned me off my meal .. Everybody was sending back a full plate of fries .. Don't you think maybe you over portioned ?? Tarter sauce was good .. Service meh .. Paid $30 with tax and tip for myself .. Not impressed ..skip this place .."}
{"text":"As good as as it gets. They fry in beef fat.  The fish is fresh cut & likewise fresh cut potatoes for the french fries. To die for onion rings. Fresh coleslaw. Their own tartar sauce (real mayonnaise, buttermilk, sweet pickles). Professional and friendly staff."}
{"text":"The best fish and chips I've had in Ontario and the best coleslaw I have ever had. Everything is so fresh and made in house from scratch.

I liiiiiike."}
{"text":"Sea Witch is wicked! (See what I did there?) I live in the area and went for 6pm Friday night. Incredibly clean inside and decorated to make you feel as if you're dining with the crew under the decks of a fishing boat. Seat yourself. 
Service: fantastic. She (I wish I knew her name) was pleasant and greeted our table immediately with waters and menus and offered to \"go over the fish tastes\" of the menu. My kind of lady!
Options: also fantastic. Classic halibut, pickerel, haddock, cod, catch of the day...it goes on. You can get fish & chips, fish a la carte, \"2&1\" fish and chips. Can you tell I love this place?! Strictly based on the way it was described, the \"more buttery\" Pickerel lured me in. And chips. My boyfriend ordered 2&1 haddock and chips. Mine was, you guessed it, fantastic, and my boyfriend's even more so (expected, since haddock is a more classic fish fry!) Next time I will go with traditional halibut, but I was not in the least disappointed with my catch. 

Pro tip: 1 order of chips is plenty to share, if you want to save your heart health and a few $!

Soft drink options also lovely & they're working on getting their LLBO. Then they'll be unstoppable! 

Enough talking about it, go 'sea' for yourself! (I did it again ;))"}
{"text":"Love them F&C's sum good, y'know. So me 'n the wife wiz some glad when the SeaWitch opened! The Arctic Char is the best, and their \"Two & a Few\" keeps the carbs down! NOT that the fries aren't durn tasty - far from it! - but us landlubbers must watch our ballast...also, they've GOODNIGHT slaw (but where's the mushy peas?)"}
{"text":"The perfect hangover cure. Delicious fish and chips. If you need to be comforted by food, this is the spot."}
{"text":"This was a little gem found nearby a job we were at.  The staff was very accommodating.  We were told the trout and mushroom appetizer were not to be missed.  So we ordered and they were both spot on.

One of my new fav spots to get a fish and chips

Come hungry... Battling the sea witch can fill you up.

Enjoy

The books table side are a nice touch!"}
{"text":"This is one of those hipster places that gives an air of pretension to something that should be anything but (this is why I'm knocking off a star.) The fish was good - crispy on the outside, tender and moist on the inside. Interestingly, the fries are the real piece de resistance here. Unexpectedly delicious, thick cut with just the right amount of crispness and greasiness. I'd be interested in trying a poutine here which is one of the few non-fish offerings on the menu. Pro tip: you only need one side of fries between two people. Trust me. Overall: it's good. I'd go back."}
{"text":"I ordered ubereats from this place given that it was marked as being the best fried fish in Toronto which it most certainly was not. The fried fish was soaked in oil, oil gushed out with every bite and dripped down my hands it was pretty gross and inedible, I could feel my arteries clogging and the fries were really thick and mushy. I also ordered the slaw which was salmonella in a bowl. It had definitely gone bad I smelled it as soon as I opened the container and the taste was even worse. Ive actually never ordered rotting food before so this was pretty shocking. The house chowder was OK in comparison with everything else but very lazy and reminded me of school lunches with frozen veggies and leftover fish, definitely not worth the price and I'd be embarassed to claim it as the emblematic dish of my restaurant. This place really needs to raise its standards and perhaps invest in a new refrigeration unit or think about making slaw daily. The only positive thing about this waste of money meal was the tartar sauce which was pretty good. Do yourself a favor and skip this place definitely not worth the calories or the money."}
{"text":"I couldn't understand why my sis was going on and on about it (and she's British) because I thought well all fish and chips taste good. This is a fact, however some fish 'n chips taste better. The deep fry is so beautifully done, it's like an art. The chips are great, too. 
I'll be honest - only had it for takeout so can't speak to the quality of the sit-down experience but food-wise it's a definite gem if you like deep fried stuff, which, I mean, you should, really."}
{"text":"We don't often provide five stars but Sea Witch is well deserving of this rare designation.  
Of course the food is excellent and reasonably priced.  Most business would be fine to stop there but Sea Witch goes further by also using Ocean Wise fish. 
Top this off with the fact that the business employs many locals who each provide fantastic customer service and you have a business anyone should be proud to support.
Great job!"}
{"text":"I live in the area and whenever we're for a lack of groceries this is the perfect place for dinner!  Recently came in on a Tuesday, they have special deals on Tuesdays and Thursdays for family sized meals. 2 pieces of haddock, one piece of cod and a big plate of fries for $26.99, what could be better? 
We paid the $3 to upgrade to poutine and it was definitely worth it! Real cheese curds here, folks! Honestly the best fish and chips in Toronto, perfect batter, thick chips and the best coleslaw I've ever had. I usually hate coleslaw but I could eat a whole bowl of that stuff any day! 
No more sad fish and chips from a pub for me! Sea Witch forever! Really proud that this restaurant is part of our community!"}
{"text":"One of the Best Fish and Chip places in Toronto.  I love the variety of fish you can pick from.  The service was great.  They give you a large amount of fries with your order. I had pickerel and chips.  I had a great experience."}
{"text":"Sea Witch is the first chippy I've found in the GTA that does authentic chips.  The chips are cut properly and fried perfectly 10/10.  The fish is equally as impressive. My partner and I ordered the halibut and haddock.  Both were generously cut, battered and fried just right.  The halibut was very fresh and meaty and the batter was nicely seasoned.  We wanted to try the onion rings but were told they are off the menu during busy times on the weekend.  Portion sizes are huge...one order of chips can easily be split between two diners."}
{"text":"Perfectly cooked fish, light crispy batter, not greasy at all.  Great fries and a fun selection of drinks.   Good atmosphere - there's more room for seating inside than you might think.  Note that he fish pieces are huge - we each had the 2-piece dishes, which was way too much food for lunch.  A terrific new fish and chips place."}
{"text":"YUM! Amazing halibut crisped to perfection with chunky fries that hold their own. Clean tasting oil, best tartar sauce I've tried, and cool vintage Boylan sodas to pair. Very good slaw, loved the atmosphere and kind staff. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"It's a bit pricey but SO GOOD! I think it's my favourite fish and chips ever."}
{"text":"If you are in the mood for the delicate fried arts, seafood and spuds (aka. Fish and Chips) this is the place for it.
 
Sea Witch focuses on the old fashioned ways of frying, with full flavor, quality ingredients and special preparation. Adding a hint of modern creativity, the results are noticeably different and very delicious.

Halibut is the name of the game here, as it should when you batter any fish. However, the option is yours, you can go with haddock, cod, arctic char, pickerel, if your heart's desire.  In a sandwich, a la carte or with chips, that's your call too. The fish is Ocean Wise certified and everything here is fried in Beef tallow for full flavor goodness.

On my tasting menu:

The Witch's Brew, Fish Chowder with Pickerel. Very filling, creamy with chunks of veg and fish. 

Onion Rings were almost donut-like. Giant rings, lots of flavor and very crispy. Almost meal worthy!

The Classic Halibut Fish and Chips is a model version of what FnC should be. The batter is crispy, light, flavorful and not overwhelming or greasy. The halibut is fresh, tender and moist. The combination is perfect, the chips add to the experience. The tallow really does work on the spuds, making them beyond addictive. Overeating will occur.
 
Overall, Sea Witch brings the FnC game. Everything was great, fried well, prepared well and served with a smile. A great place to stop in and share a meal."}
{"text":"consistently the most incredible food
portions are great
staff are so friendly"}
{"text":"I've ordered for pick-up a couple times now and the person taking the order on the phone is always very pleasant and helpful.
The order is always ready by the time they tell me to come for pick up.

I always order the Halibut and the Cod, although the Halibut piece seems to always be smaller than the other fish; I feel like less is more when it comes to fish and chips! No one really needs massive pieces of fried fish and a large order of chips for a meal.

I'm a fan of both the fish but have always been a fan of Halibut for its lighter and buttery flavour! I sub the chips out for their amazing battered onion rings and got poutine instead of just regular fries. I got it to go so I felt like it needed a little more gravy as the bottom of the fries lacked the goodness but it's totally understandable as it did come in a cardboard box.

Overall, I enjoyed the meal! It didn't make me feel gross or anything for having so much fried and greasy food, the oil feels \"clean\" if that makes any sense."}
{"text":"Went after reading reviews as it's kinda in my hood.  

Take Out Service:
Friendly and he suggested I buy the coleslaw.  Got home and coleslaw was missing from bag.  Called them to advise and was told they would remember me and give me a coleslaw next time!  Ha.  Really?  Most restaurants will go out of their way to correct error and deliver it or at minimum refund the credit card for the missing item (sometimes more).  I just wanted my money back for the slaw (and tip) as I never originally intended to buy it anyways.  That option was not given in this digital age.  Wont go back to get my slaw.  At least they were apologetic over the phone I guess.  

Food:

Fries: were avg thick cut Fish and Chips fries.  Nothing to complain or to rave about.

Onion Rings:  had a tasty batter, but I would prefer a bit bigger onion inside or slightly less batter.  The batter to onion ratio was a bit too much for my taste.

Haddock: Decent portion of meat for the price.  Batter was crispy even after 15mins of driving probably because it was packed well (it was able to breathe).  However, a bit too oily, and that is the most important part for me in a fish and chips joint.  I think it's the style of batter used.  And some prefer this style.  I prefer a less spongy batter as it will result in less oily bite.  

Coleslaw: never got it.  :(

Taking away the coleslaw screw up, I really can't understand the 5 star ratings on this place.  I guess the city has a lot of lacklustre fish and chip joints in comparison.  Heritage Fish and Chips in Brampton/Milton still gets my vote for tastiest / best value but too far for most cravings since moving to the city.  Oh well, on to the next one and hoping Heritage opens a place in the city."}
{"text":"This is my go to fish and chips restaurant, I have been there several times, and the quality has been consistently excellent.  This is all they do and they are the best.  Friendly service too.  We also tried the chowder and it was awesome."}
{"text":"This is a rather new place in my neighbourhood. They have a good selection of fish and i have tried cod, norwegian cod, and pickeral. The fries are excellent and theres lots of them. I usually get a roll and salad, without fries. They put alot of sauce on the roll and i have started to get it without the sauce. Service is excellent and prices very reasonable."}
{"text":"Craving fish and chips the usual halibut and chips and an order of beer was almost perfect expect for the crap customer service.  

Our server seemed like a passive aggressive old cow whom clearly needed to be put out to the pastures.  It was near the end of the day but it's your job and you should do it right. Didn't appreciate being I.D'd but in most cases i would've been flattered but she did it clearly to be rude. It was as if we were unwelcome at her establishment and needed to be rushed out.  This broad looked to be training someone new.. hopefully her replacement because clearly she is old and tired to be dealing with people.  

Food was good and tasty none the less but that rudeness is memorable even days later writing a review.  Never been treated like that longer than I can remember.  

I will say thanks for the extra piece they gave us (free of charge) but I wouldn't anticipate coming back.  Thanks but no thanks."}
{"text":"I generally HATE fried fish but my boyfriend was dying for some and they don't have much else so I went for the least fishy one (cod) and fries. I was blown away! The fish tasted GREAT and the fries were awesome. It didn't taste too fishy and wasn't to greasy I felt bad afterward. The only reason I gave them only 4 stars is because we ordered out and they didn't give us any ketchup, which would have made it all even better. I'll definitely come back here next time I'm in Toronto."}
{"text":"I won't give this place 5 stars... ONLY because they don't sell/serve mushy peas.

Aside from that - NO COMPLAINTS! Honestly!

Their chips (what other people on here call 'fries') are TO DIE FOR.... You'll feel like you're at the chippy back in England. Yes, that good!

Haven't had their fish yet but will soon when family comes to visit.

And check out the collection Britpop-era record sleeves under the counter.. Pretty impressive :)

Lastly.. The staff are super speedy and kind."}
{"text":"... and having been back again a few days ago, I will leave my rating as 3-stars. The service was faster this time and the food was okay, but I really don't find anything special about it. I had a bowl of the Witch's Brew chowder which was pretty good, and the coleslaw that I missed the first time. Overall, I would say that the food is on par with other places that I have had fish and chips, although a little more expensive than some. I might return if in the area, but wouldn't travel across town just to go back."}
{"text":"I went in to Sea Witch for an order of fries, and I asked if they offered any mayonnaise based dips for fries, and the guy behind the counter laughed and was like \"No, we don't have any dips for fries\" in a condescending way... and then continued \"we're an authentic fish and chips restaurant, we don't sell things like that\". His tone was super rude and snobby, and I felt embarrassed because he sort of went on about it, trying to convey what an 'authentic' place it is, and that I am clueless that I might think they would offer something like that. The funny part is that now, a few months later, they sell like deep fried pickles, or some crap like that, with a dill mayo dip. Like, it's really not a huge deal, but I don't know why that guy was so insecure and pretentious about his restaurant's authenticity, and now they're selling whatever. I wasn't going to say anything about my experience until I saw the random pickles and dill mayo on their menu."}
{"text":"My wife and I are from England. Whenever we have a craving for a taste of home we and get fish and chips from here (with the gravy and curry sauce on the side). There are usually some interesting kinds of fish on the menu, but we normally stick with the haddock which is perfectly cooked. I like it where the ends of the battered fish curl up into crunchy goodness but the fish it's self is still soft and light. 

The chips are also very well done. Soft and fluffy on the inside with a little crunch on the outside. The potatoes are cut into chips with a machine from the UK which ensures the chips are random sizes and creates scratchings (not the pork type. This may be a term from the midlands only, but I'm sure you can google it) which are a sign of a real chippy in my mind. Also they serve beer. What's not to love!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, friendly and prompt service. One of the best spots in the city for British style fish and chips."}
{"text":"You live in a neighbourhood for 25 years and no one opens a chippy. Well good things should never be rushed. This place has been opened only a couple of weeks and I've been three times as have my neighbours. The batter is crispy and thin and perfect. It's got just that right amount of grease on it to kiss your finger tips and give you something tasty to lick off in between bites. 
I'm not a fan of tartar sauce and I like HP sauce with my F&C, so they are ordering it in. I'm a haddock girl I grew up with it and I eat fish suppers with my hands. 
Most places when they open the first month can't get it right and need time to settle in. The food is flawless. 
Let's talk chips. I like big fat jooby chips, lightly seasoned with salt and slathered in malt vinegar. So basically I'm in chip heaven. Skins still on, some folks don't like this I love it. 
So on my next adventure to Sea Witch we will again be dining in, but those beautiful looking onion rings will be on my agenda. 
If you haven't been yet, get there."}
{"text":"Stopped in for some take-out, but ended up eating in.
Atmosphere is cute & homey, with an open kitchen, which was bustling with take-out action the entire time we were there.
I had the halibut and my husband had the haddock. I love the sweetness halibut has, and the batter was not overpowering to this somewhat delicate fish - husband liked the haddock very much. Tartar sauce is fresh & tastes homemade, which is a HUGE plus for me!
Will definitely be back through the winter, I really liked eating it fresh & hot (most fish & chips are take out, or outdoor seating).
Prices are pretty good.
Overall, a nice, little gem :)"}
{"text":"Looks like we've finally found an awesome fish & chip place in Toronto at last. 

The service was fast and professional. The restaurant is nicely decorated, cozy and clean. The fish was battered and cooked to perfection. Served with a very generous amount of chips.

If you're in Toronto and love fish & chips, I highly recommend you visit This place"}
{"text":"I treated a friend out to dinner here. Sea Witch specializes in fish and chips, it is a small business with the owner working on-site and cooking!

We ordered the halibut cakes for appetizers. I love these - very fresh and the perfect size! I ordered the cod which tastes more buttery. My friend ordered the classic Haddock fish and chips. We also got gravy on the side. The portions were MASSIVE... so much food... it was perfect. I recommend sharing these meals! 
The coleslaw was new to me, it was very purple and leaned towards the sour side. Very different.

The BEST service! Our server was very knowledgable, she explained the differences in the types of fish and taste to expect from them. It was incredibly helpful! One of the cooks were slicing potatoes into French fries, this attracted some kids. It was adorable as he explained his process to them. The owner was very friendly!! I could tell he cares about his customers and employees.

Our total was about $50, the prices were very reasonable with fish and chips starting at $11.

I highly recommend Sea Witch for families with young children. Good food for sharing!"}
{"text":"I have had better, I can not lie.
I'm questining all of these positive reviews, to be perfectly honest.

The batter on the fish was soggy, and the fries weren't crispy. They were soggy as well. The price is fair, as fish in general can be pricier than crap you buy at a chain .. But I wouldn't return to this place.
Fish & Chips have to be pretty special to return, and this, isn't a return-kinda-place IMHO. Sorry."}
{"text":"Pickerel is one the best fish in town. Haddock is not so bad. Their big serving of french fries are the best!!!  The place is incredibly clean! Servers are friendly. One thing that is a rip off is that they charge you a dollar for a mayonnaise..are you kidding me??!!!!"}
{"text":"Nice spot on a lively stretch of St. Clair. Wychwood streetcar stop. Friendly staff. Huge portions. Really tasty haddock and chips. Attention to excellence in both fish and the chips. Would have loved a glass of white wine with it!"}
{"text":"To start let me simply say.. You NEED to go here.  Their menu is very small offering only several different types of fish cooked in the classic fish & chips style but they know what they are doing and do it spot on.  They do a HUGE take-out business (sadly i am too far away to be able to do takeout since you really need to eat fish and chips as soon as they come out of the fryer to get the optimal experience) and  dining area is very small so depending on when you arrive there can be a bit of a wait for your food.  They cook each order individually ensuring that the fryer is not over crowded so that your fish and chips instantly sear a nice crispy crust ensuring none of the food is ever greasy.  The portions are large both for your fish and your chips so you definitely won't leave hungry."}
{"text":"Overall a decent fish and chips place. This could have easily received 4 stars if their quality was more consistent.

I was a bit under-impressed the first two times I ate here. It is not that the food was bad, but there was nothing special about them. I always had haddock chips and fries, and the portion was very good for the price. The chips had quite a lot of fish, but that was pretty much place. Nothing really special.

I guess the third time's the charm. Same price and portion, but the quality was very good. The haddock chips I got again were very crisp without being too oily. Also, the quality of the fish was very good.

Their service has always been very good though. Friendly and casual, which suits well with their restaurant."}
{"text":"I have literally just signed up to a Yelp account purely to write this review for Seawitch. That should give you a fair idea of the superlatives I am about to unleash. 

I am 27 years old. At 22 years old I moved to Canada from Scotland. I love it here, but there are two things I miss almost as much as family. Glasgow curry and a good Glasgow fish and chips.  Finally one of those issues has a resolution! And I can't believe my luck that its a five minute walk from my house. And its so good I just had my second one in 5 days. 

This is the real deal. If you're British and have been searching for a decent chippy, this is it. If you're Canadian and want a slice of ACTUAL British authenticity come fill yer boots here. The fish is excellent, - fresh, and the batter is perfectly crisp, and not too thick. Refreshingly free of grease too. So, Seawitch has one half of the equation down to a tee, but I've had decent enough fried fish in Canada before. Where Seawitch takes the trophy as the only truly authentic chippy I've found is in their chips. \"Chippy\" chips (ask any Brit what this means) are one of a kind. They are not found in pubs. They are not found in high class restaurants. They are not found at McDonalds. Up until last week, I thought they were only found in a Great British Chippy. Now I can add Seawitch to that list.  I can't explain a \"chippy\" chip very well to be honest - slightly softer than usual on the inside, but still slightly crisp on the outside, but with a unique almost peanut-ty taste.  This is the only place in Canada to my knowledge that can legitimately call itself a British chippy. 

PS the 90s British CD covers embedded in front counter are a very nice touch.  Would be nice to have them playing in the background!"}
{"text":"Amazing fish and chips. Best one I've tried of all of Toronto thus far. I must say it's better than Icelands fish and chips. Regardless great plate, cheap, and staff are very friendly. Definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"Went on Sunday for lunch and found this place to be just Meh. The place wasn't even busy, was able to walk in and sit anywhere. The lightening in this place is kinda dim. The menu variety was great offering different types of fish along with the pricing. However, my favourite, Halibut was marked with \"MP\" which means monthly pricing i think. Halibut Fish & Chip was $17! kinda pricey if you ask me but i was optimistic about it. The Halibut Two & One which consisted of 2 fish and chip was $30! (which is what i ordered lol). 

I found the chips to be just mediocre and some of it salty. I guess they didn't toss it around properly or long enough to get the salt evenly. The fish portion was quite small and had lot of batter on it. It was nice and hot but not dripping with oil which sometimes happen. 

My friend got fish and onion rings for his meal. The presentation of onion rings was neat as they stack the onion rings on top of each other. However, the onion rings were covered in a lot batter and the onion itself was a small very thing ring. Clearly the batter overpowered the onion. 

Verdict: The food was just meh with small portions and kinda pricey for me. I won't be coming back here again."}
{"text":"Finally! A much needed addition to the neighbourhood. There was good and there was bad. First the bad: Coleslaw...meh. I'm not a creamy coleslaw fan but even with that being said I think the slaw was a little bland. we tried the chowder and that left my family with the same feeling...meh. The place is only open two weeks so they're still working out the kinks service wise but mostly on the good side.. The fish was nice. Good crust and still moist in side. The fries as well, great, Portion size was good too.So all in all a positive experience. Room for improvement but overall thumbs up."}
{"text":"I have gone back twice since my first 5 star review and I unfortunately have to downgrade this place.  First time I had it, it was great.  Crispy fries and chips.  Both times since, it is still OK, but...just OK.  For some reason, the fries now taste more dry and stale.  Less crispy.  The fish is still decent, but not as good as before.  Not sure what happened to this place.  I used to make it a point to come here when I was in the neighborhood, but now, I am not sure if I will go back.  It has become just another fish and chip place.  Nothing special."}
{"text":"Ordered:
2 haddocks and chips;
onion rings.

Damage: $26.

Verdict:
Reasonable in price; generous in fries.
Fish were substantial even with its thick batter.
Onion rings were more batter (oil) than onions (not worth the $5 price tag since I like to eat more onions than batter).

The batter itself was thick/crispy-tasty/greasy.  

Fries were chunky and homemade.

Next time, I will skip the onion rings.

Other fish and chips places may display cheaper ($6-7) prices for white fish ($9-$12) for cod/haddock/halibut BUT cut the fish in slender slices.  

This place gives thicker cuts of fish.

TIP:  Eat your order with a cup of tea (rather than with a softdrink), it will help with digestion after ingesting the oil from the batter."}
{"text":"Me and my friend went here last month for dinner.
It wasn't too busy and we both tried their halibut cakes and then some fish and chips.
I didn't really like their halibut cakes but my friend loved them.
I thought the fish and chips were good. It was just a lot of food. More than I had expected.
Our waitress was really nice and after the meal we met the owner who was also kind.
It's a nice little option on the St Clair West line and I also believe they do takeaway."}
{"text":"Yesterday my boyfriend and I got take out from here and we loved it. I had the halibut and chips and he had the cod. The portions were huge! When we got home the food was still piping hot unlike most take out options that we go for. We will definitely be back (hopefully very soon!) to try some of the other menu items!"}
{"text":"I worked next door at Wychwood Open Door and got  come here once during my lunch break. I had big hopes for this place. I love their mural, though that shouldn't be a reason to expect great food from a restaurant. Their fish and chips wasn't stellar and it took ages to cook. I pretty much spent my entire lunch time waiting. The staff seemed bored though were friendly."}
{"text":"We ordered fish and chips (haddock and cod). The first few bites (or really, chomps, since those are big-sized portions you're diving into) were awesome - the fish was fresh and 'juicy', while the batter tasted almost like unsweetened crispy donut (a good thing). So after the first few bites, I was all ready to give Sea Witch a 5 star rating and anoint it as one of the best fish and chips places in the city.

And maybe it still is for some people. But after getting through maybe a third of my haddock, and after my wife got through a third of her cod, we were just so overwhelmed by the amount of batter and ready to give up. Now I know I said the batter tasted good, but this was a bit too too too much. We ordered the slaw on the side (not bad, not amazing) and started wolfing it down just to get a different taste, but the batter wouldn't be defeated. Eventually, it overwhelmed even the fish, which is unfortunate because, again, the fish was really good (taste and quality). 

Now this may be just personal taste, but I'd much rather have the fish as king in my fish and chips. At Sea Witch though, the batter seems to be the star."}
{"text":"I usually have the Haddock and chips because I love it but it has stopped me from trying other fish like the pickerel. Lol"}
{"text":"Ordered for take out, and although the person on the phone was clipped and busy, they were still friendly. It was ready in 15 minutes, as they promised. 
The food itself is really good. I ordered the haddock and fries. Huge portions. I couldn't finish all of anything. The batter is definitely fairly heavy and prominent, so if you prefer a light batter this may not be for you. It's so crispy and delicious though, I'm not sure how you'd be disappointed. The fries were a good thick cut and flavourful. 
I was so full after this meal!! The single order will likely fill you up, but you can get a double order, from what I understood. I felt fine afterward, not heavy and gross like fried food often makes me feel. 
Absolutely give Sea Witch a go!"}
{"text":"Visiting Toronto for a day and somehow ended up here. Lived up to the high reviews on Yelp. The food was delicious and the service was great. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Fish & chips are delicious, as well as the fish sandwich. You get A LOT of chips. The staff have always been very attentive & friendly from take-out to eat-in. The coleslaw is some of the best I've had, and you have to get the curry sauce on the side for your chips!"}
{"text":"Amazinggggg
 I was walking down st Clair and got hungry so popped in this cute place w a bar window view. The waiter and cooks greeted me as they cook right where you can see (so no funny business lol) ...everyone is beyond pleasent .the waiter gave me a brief description of all the menu items to help as there are a few different types of fish. I started w the clam chowder..only 6$ for a great hearty serving. Which is the best I've ever had so flavourful and rich. I also got mini cakes w chips so happen I chose here for lunch"}
{"text":"As you settle yourself into Sea Witch Fish & Chips, you'll be able to smell the rich aromas of the food they are cooking openly. 

I ordered the Haddock Fish & Chips. It only took around 10 minutes for them to serve me my order and they were kinda busy. My whole plate looked gorgeous and it tasted delicious. The fries are thick and the haddock was fried to perfection. The haddock given was a big enough size for me. Eat in moderation, you'll be able to savor each bite more. It's a good thing I didn't order the Witch's Brew (Chowder) because it filled me up and I didn't eat anything the whole day. 

I believe I made the correct choice choosing Haddock over Halibut because I was certainly pleased with the Haddock, it was wonderful.

The service staff were very friendly and checked up on me regularly. They noticed I drank all of my water before I did and filled it up after.

Btw washrooms are located downstairs.

Overall, Sea Witch Fish & Chips is my favorite Fish & Chips joint."}
{"text":"ok gave them the benefit of the doubt and gave them a second shot. Even worse than the first time. Came into an empty restaurant with a small child was told the 3 of us could not sit in a 4 seater and that they would have to move us DURING our meal if a 4 came in. Second time around was just as chaotic and the service was just as unfriendly and condescending as the first time. Out of town family member tried to use an American visa debit card (basically a visa) and was repeatedly told it won't work and they won't except a debit card, until the visa finally worked. My son dropped a fork and I asked fir a clean one and she yanked my clean one out of my hand without even asking which one was dirty. Horrible customer service, but the food is good. Won't go back unfortunately, but may try take out if I'm craving fish and chips."}
{"text":"Hugh servings.  First time I had fish and chips in Toronto.  Better than I expected.  Batter was light and the cod was firm but very tasty.  Fish cakes were a tad on the dry side but came with pickled onions.  Surprised that I was charged for my mayo.  First time ever anywhere I've been charged for a condiment.
Wine pricey,  should have ordered a beer, good selection."}
{"text":"Five-star fish, five-star fries.  The two and a few is a huge portion.  Fish sandwich - just bun, tartar, pickled onions and fish - is a standout."}
{"text":"Update:  This place is usually amazing.  Great fish and the BEST rings you will ever have - anywhere - by far, and they now have deep fried breaded mushrooms, and they have AMAZING tartar sauce, and dill dip too.  (Hey guys - how about adding some Shrimp sauce/seafood sauce?)

I changed my rating back to 5 from 4, because they are USUALLY great.  It's just too bad that on Friday and Saturday evenings they are too busy to cook their onion rings - because those take up way too much space in their busy deep fryer at those busy times.  And - sadly, they don't deliver the amazing onion rings - because they turn from the best you've ever tried - to soggy during the delivery trip from store to your home.  Shame.

Updating my review again:   I hate inconsistency.  And it bugs me that one time this place is GREAT - OUTSTANDING - and the next time the service and food is - meh.

The second last time I was there I was just blown away.  The onion rings were BY FAR the best I've ever had - anywhere.  They were AMAZING.  And the fish was great too.  Great batter.  Excellent.  About the best you can get - but, then, the last time I was there - things were not nearly as good.  My last visit found the batter (on rings AND fish) to be very thin - and disappointing.  (I asked the cook about this on my way out the door - and got a lame response: \"maybe the humidity in the air ....\")

And the SERVICE!  I just have to vent a little.  I gave my order to the woman who seats people, and didn't see the waitress nearly enough for her to notice that I probably would have liked a refill on my water glass - that didn't come until I was finished my meal.

I know I'm whining - like Trump whines like a 'whiny little #$%^' but don't you just hate it when the food is spectacular one time - and you go back and it's NOT the next time?


Previous review:

I've been back a couple of times, and waited longer than I thought necessary for food again on one of those visits.

The first time I had the onion rings I was amazed.  They were the best I've every had - anywhere.  They were crispy on the outside and hot and moist on the inside.  Absolutely wonderful.

Unfortunately - the second time I had rings they were not as good.  But they deliver them to your table on a unique stack piled like the tower of Pisa with a stainless steel rack that piles them high - but I immediately dump them into a smaller pile to TRY to keep them bunched together so they stay warm long enough to eat a few of them.  (Because - like most food - when they are no longer hot - they are no longer ANYWHERE CLOSE to being as good.)

I tried the trout.  Didn't like it - but if you like trout it just might be good - I can't really say.

Their fish is among the best I've had compared to other places.

And the food is fairly expensive.

Update:  I went back again - and the waitress was helpful about the onion rings getting cold VERY quickly - and the Halibut was nice - but I STILL don't understand why it takes so long for them to prepare the food.  It seems to take them 15 to 20 minutes to drop a little fish in the fryer.  I just don't understand.  Still - great food."}
{"text":"So excited to have a new (and unique!) restaurant on St. Clair West. 
We had the halibut and chips, and both were delicious.  The fish was perfectly cooked, and the batter was light and crispy.  The fish to batter ratio was perfect. 
There were far too many fries for one person to manage - next time we will go with the two piece and share the fries. 
The decor is fun (ship inspired + upcycled church fixtures) and the staff are really friendly - we will definitely be back soon!! 
Thanks Sea Witch, for anchoring on St. Clair!"}
{"text":"My husband and I had lunch here yesterday. We didn't have the kid with us but were happy to see that the place is kid-friendly, with a children's fish-and-chips option as well as crayons and colouring books for dine-in use.

My husband ordered the cod sandwich, which featured a huge piece of fish between what looked like a Portuguese bun, and I had the halibut cakes with chips. There were a lot of chips on my plate, enough to share, and both of our orders included pickled onions (either as a topping or a side). Nice touch!

We were also given a sample of the coleslaw, which had a pleasantly light and fresh taste. (The Stockyards across the street still has the #1 slaw, with its fennel and seasoning, but the slaw at Sea Witch was perfectly suited to the fish. A good clean balance to the fried food it accompanies.)

Our server was friendly and funny, moving things along despite having a lot of tables to handle. It wasn't cheap but it also wasn't any more expensive than you'd expect for the size of the portions, the quality and the atmosphere of the restaurant. (Stylish yet practical with nods to British culture, especially when it comes to all the album and 45 sleeves hung along the counter.)

We're happy to have Sea Witch in our neighbourhood and will be back."}
{"text":"I have high expectations of fish and chips and am normally disappointed, but not this time! I had the haddock and chips and my partner got the 2 and 1 of pickerel. Both of us were impressed by the quantity and quality of both the fish and chips. 

The customer service was also excellent and although we ordered for take out I would consider eating in next time. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I got invited to a media tasting at Sea Witch (@seawitchfc) on St.Claire West and frankly I pass by so many times but never notice this place before. The small neighborhood restaurant has a very simple menu with 5 fish of fish &amp; chips or sandwiches to choose from (Halibut, Pickerel, Haddock, Cod and Arctic Char). Nothing fancy, just a few sides to choose from.

Chef &amp; Owner Kevin Kowalczyk spent many years at Penrose Fish &amp; Chips, so he knows a thing or two about fried fish. All the fish are fried and fries are fried in beef tallow here, the secret to the golden crisp batter.

Although the entire place look like reclaimed wood / furniture, love the contrast of the red tiles at the front which make a perfect backdrop for the fish &amp; chips.

The Witch's Brew (House Chowder) $6
~ This was definitely the star of the night which was filled with big chucks of fish and not too thick not too thin. Haven't had a chowder I like that much for a while, everything was just right.

Onion Rings $5
~ Nice big tower of thickly battered onion rings

Halibut Cakes
~ The fish cake was crispy on the outside and flaky soft on the inside and served with a side of pickled onion or you can switch it to the house made tartar sauce instead.

Halibut Fish &amp; Chips $15
~ Halibut will always be the classic choice for fish &amp; chips. The batter on mine was rather soggy and the fish a little bit overcooked but when I asked others, theirs was perfectly crispy so I guess it was just my luck. 
~ Fried old school style with beef tallow for extra flavor. 
~ Apart from halibut, you can also choose from Pickerel, Haddock, Cod and Arctic Char. Although they try to be Ocean Wise as much as possible, it is just not possible for the complete menu keeping the price in mind. 

Home made cookies at $5 per pack.

The Great Jamaican Old Tyme Ginger Beer definitely had a kick to it. They are also working on a alcohol license since who doesn't crave for a beer with all the deep fried goodies.

Verdict:
~ I would gladly come back for eh chowder and halibut cakes
~ Great location and love the relax decor which make it equally great for take out or sit ins.
~ Can;t wait until they get their liquor licence, nothing better than a beer with that fish and chips"}
{"text":"Amazing.  I've been wanting to try this place for a while now and have to give the Haddock and Chips 5/5 .  4/5 overall because they didn't have my beer :("}
