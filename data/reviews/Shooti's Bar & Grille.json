{"text":"Let me tell you what happened to day at this bar.  Me and my husband went down for pizza.  The first thing I saw was BOOBS.  This blond bartender was hanging out, I thought we would of seen more then we wanted.  We then found out we were sitting next to the owner.  What a PIG. I have never heard such a bad mouth. Every word was f..k. He was  telling the guy he sat next to about the blow jobs he got from that blond bartender that worked that day shift.  Then about a half hour lateR  here comes his wife. She is a nice lady.  the Pizza We Got Was Burned.  We Will Never Go THere Again.  Its Turning Into The  Big Dogs Bar.  No Woman Should Go THere.  The Owner Was So Drunk. We Are So Sorry We Went There.  I Think A Bartender Does Not Need To Show Her BOOBS To Get A Tip....."}
{"text":"First time here.  Place was really nice and well taken care of; very clean.  Nice, grey decor with a large bar area and many high top and low tables.  Very friendly staff.  We sat at a table and our waitress (bartender) was very quick and really nice.  Super helpful and friendly.   Had the best stuffed mushroom caps, ever!!  The French dip was really good and so was the philly steak quesadilla my fianc√© had.  We will definitely be back and tell our friends about it.  If you were here prior to remodeling and new management, give it another shot!  You will be happy you did."}
{"text":"This is a perfect neighborhood bar. The establishment is clean and has a great look. Service has been excellent every time we have stopped in. They serve food, with huge portions for a great price. Cold drinks and friendly staff!! Glad we stumbled upon this place!!!"}
{"text":"Great local bar with great food!  Stopped in for a bite and a cold one and one of three bartenders was quick to take our order.  It took a bit longer than expected because of the crowd, but the fish I ordered was enough to feed two people.  All giant TV's high def and just a fun crowd.  Met the owner and his wife who were very accommodating to see a new face. They invited us to stop in again.  I am glad I stopped and will be back again for a good time.  Heard they have bands from time to time."}
{"text":"Nice place, nice service, great atmosphere, clean, very good place to go bring your friends food drinks dancing, we met some friends there last night had a great time actually had an awesome time,, deafly a five-star my book. I recommend this place to anyone that wishes to enjoy them self."}
{"text":"Horrible.  I've eaten here on numerous occasion.  And tonight was absolutely the last time I will ever place an order Ordered two dozen wings for take out. Got home and they were still steaming hot!  YES!!  Opened up the container to find barely cooked wings.  Still white skin.  Called and they asked we bring these back. Which of course we would. My husband brought them back asked that they not simply recook the wings we brought back (which was their intent) but cook new wings.   Finally get our wings home to find all I can explain as \"f-u wings\".  They were cooked crispy (which I like) but - they were so crispy there was hardly any meat on the bones and full of nasty veins."}
{"text":"Ok, so I decided to give Shooti's another chance, and I'm happy to say that I'm glad I did.  It was a totally different experience this time around.  Service was prompt and efficient (we sat at a table near the bar), the crowd was more of what I would have originally expected - a mixed age group ranging from mid 20s all the way up to (what I'd assume was) around mid to late 60's, the owners/managers were on point and obviously keeping everything running smooth, and we ordered food again and it was great as well.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because they allow smoking in the building.  Not that I'm a prude by any means, but when you're there with your husband who quit smoking a year ago and, as any ex smokers will attest to, struggles everyday with cravings, sitting inside of a smoky bar makes it difficult.  I'm sure a lot of people don't mind this, and I used to not mind either, but it does make it a little stuffy and I honestly got home and smelled smoke on my hair and clothes, which kind of irritated me.  But that's really the worst thing I can say, and like I said, I know that that opinion doesn't apply to everyone.  Regardless of the smoking rules, we had a really good time and left with no complaints.. way to redeem yourself, Shooti's!"}
{"text":"Actually really tasty food for being bar food! Service was good. I wasn't a huge fan of the band playing but otherwise it's a fun environment and the crowd was mixed ages."}
{"text":"I will say this, the place appears to be pretty clean on the inside. It's a divey-type bar, but the cleanliness and the overall size of the bar make it much more appealing than your typical \"Yinzer\" establishment.  Smoking is still allowed in this bar. I realize that some people will seek out a place they can smoke inside, I just avoid smoking bars like the plague. I didn't know prior to arrival it was permitted. They do have a pretty nice ventilation system over the bar that makes it less noticeable while you are inside- but I still smelled like an old bowling alley when I got home.  The food was pretty decent for bar food. I'd suggest their soups, wings, and quesadillas- the nachos left a lot to be desired.  Service was pretty decent as well. It took a while to be greeted since we sat at a table and not the bar- but to be fair, the bartender was the only one serving, and when she made it over she did a great job (even though we weren't drinking, which I know is a pet peeve of bartenders). The cook also came out and asked us and the table behind us if everything was good-I thought that was pretty nice.  I don't live close, but if the bar became non-smoking, I wouldn't hesitate to visit again."}
{"text":"Great food and exceptional service but I think the air conditioner has been broke my last few visits. Super uncomfortable!"}
