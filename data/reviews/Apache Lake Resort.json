{"text":"At the lake this Fathers Day weekend, 6-18-16.  The bathrooms have been cleaned. (I was there 2 weeks ago and it was still nasty). I not only saw them cleaned in the morning, they were checked in the evening as well.  Wonderful, so much better than the last year.  The stall walls have been cleaned.  The showers have no mold on one, way less mold on the other.  I wasn't completely grossed out at all this weekend. Woohoo.  Thank you and please keep up the good work. It is appreciated. 

2014 & 2015: I haven't seen any reviews on the marina bathroom, not the hotel. I didn't want to give it a bad review if I had been there just once.  After several visits over the course of two summers it gets a one. This is NOT a 1 visit review and they were short staffed, no excuse. Easily said the womens is nasty/disgusting and the mens I hear is worse. I must have missed their annual cleaning. From the looks of it, it isn't cleaned quarterly or semi annually.  The showers: fist size wads of hair, hair on the walls, water always on the floor, mold everywhere (not an exaggeration), no where to put your things while your in the shower. You have one hook, so hopefully you can figure out how to get your towel, changing into clean clothes, changing out of dirty clothes, your shampoo and items on that one hook. If you drop anything it's trash cause the floor is so gross. They really need to figure out the water on the floor issue, my thought would be lower the shower rod or get longer curtains, under $3 fix. 
Stalls side: toilet paper on the floor, shit smeared on the stall walls (not one stall, several), broken toilets. Someone had dropped a pad paper backing on the floor, it was there for 4 days. The toilet paper had been restocked so I know they must have seen it. It would have taken less than 5 seconds to pick it up. Yes, the person that dropped it should have! The hygiene container hadn't been dumped in no telling how long, OMG, it stunk like there was stuff in there for months. Now broken tiles in the middle of the walkway which are really sharp. I only imagine how bad the mens is. Late one night my husband stuck his head in & yelled for me to see if I was still inside, he talked about much better the womens was, the mens was really really disgusting. It only takes a few minutes to run a broom or a mop through it. No money or effort is put into this bathroom. It does have a good supply of toilet paper, thank you for that. 
Let me also say I am a small town farm girl not some prissy city girl. I do have some type of clean standards and the marina bathrooms are off the chart disgusting.  

The restaurant is very good. The lake is nice. People need to be more conscience and not RUDE about driving fast on the dirty road and making the dust roll. People are camping close. We have a boat in the marina but there is no need to dust out those poor campers. Someone needs to grade the road.  If the resort is ever having money problems, do it yourself. Rent a dang grader and grade it yourself.  Once a month, from the resort to Roosevelt asphalt then back, your done one round trip."}
{"text":"I don't understand why this place has bad reviews. My wife and I camped here for 2 night and it was only $10! It was a great deal! All the staff were very helpful! We stayed at jacks cove, which was a little more secluded camping area, so when our car got stuck in one of the dunes, they graciously came out to help tow and pull it back. Cathy was especially helpful! The lake itself was beautiful and clean. We canoed and found varied fishing spots. We caught one small mouth bass and many bluegills. You can build campfires right at your campsite too! It was a great experience!"}
{"text":"Bring your own sheets, wear flip flops in the shower, check your shoes for scorpions, try to be drunk by the time you want to sleep it's a lot easier crawling into the bed that way. I'd recommend brining your own sheets and pillows. 
First day they didn't have any water. The rest of the trip they never had hot water, even though they told us several times that they would have it fixed by the next day.  
The TV has about 6 channels none of them come in clear, the TV is from the 90s. 

You don't come here for the rooms, you come here for the lake and then question why you didn't just camp by the lake. If you want AC maybe bring your tent into the room, you'll feel cleaner."}
{"text":"WARNING: do NOT take the 60 out to Apache Trail (unless you have nerves of steel to drive down the side of a cliff on a sketchy one lane dirt road with rock outcroppings likely to take out the side of your trailer or large vehicle.) 
I highly encourage you to come in from the north and come in from beeline highway (87) and then south on the 188. Thought still dirt (and according to the GPS much longer) it takes less time and is far less nerve-wracking.

Just spent the weekend at Apache Lake, GORGEOUS views, you won't be disappointed there. 

I have to give it three stars as the drive was atrocious and the camp sites were not much more than a big dirt parking lot with hook-ups. I encourage you to check out party cove and take a jump off the cliff (work on your upper body strength first). 

There is a small store and a place for ice, though not quite a \"resort\" you will have a great time and find it to be quite secluded (surprise... 14 miles of dirt road).

All-in-all a decent weekend, something I encourage you to do at least... Or only... Once!"}
{"text":"Used the lake as a jump off to hike Reavis Ranch and ended up coming back every chance I can!"}
{"text":"In the middle of nowhere down a long and dusty highway, you will find this old \"resort\" and campground that has pretty much been the same place for the past 20+ years. Sure it is a bit run down, and in dire need of a remodel. But the Apache Lake Resort doesn't need to be flashy, up to date, or even that clean, because Apache Lake itself is really why everyone wanders out here. 

In fact I would argue that staying here at the \"resort\" is a form of \"glamping\" that you hear so much about these days.  And what is wrong with that?  Sure it is not up to Hilton standards but would you really expect that in the middle of nowhere? 

In addition to accommodations, there is a small bar with a few food offerings and a convenience store for campers.  Nothing offered is spectacular from a culinary perspective, but it can serve its purpose of filling you up in the right circumstances. It's also nice to have a place to buy ice nearby!  (If you have ever been camping you might appreciate what it means to have good ice at the ready).  There is an outside patio with shade and a nice view of the lake, if you happen to be looking for a spot to chill and enjoy a cold one on a hot summer day. 

They also have boat rentals, which tend to go quickly, but if you manage to get one you can have a great time on the lake for a reasonably affordable price.  That is the primary  advantage to making the trek to this lake, versus the closer (and paved) Canyon Lake, which can be a mob scene on crowded days.  

Overall if you like roughing it \"a bit\" and avoiding huge crowds, then you might like it here. Four stars!"}
{"text":"One of the greatest camping values in all of Arizona. Imagine tent camping for only $5 on a beach within 2 hours of downtown Phoenix. The Apache Lake resort also has some very modest accommodations and space for RVs. There is a Tonto area there near the store called Crabtree wash that has a nice swimming area for kids.

The staff is nice and friendly and they have a bar with an old shuffleboard table that I played on in 1972. When you drive the Apache Trail you will drive on great solid hard pack dirt road that just about any vehicle can make. The road at Fish Creek is very narrow and very steep and if you have 4x4 it's a good work out for your 4 low shifter."}
{"text":"It's a hidden gem with a fun vibe.  The motel is older so don't expect a new hotel, and you won't be disappointed.  After a day on the water we kick back, play cornhole and have a good time on the lawn of the motel.   Amazing service at the front desk, amazing food in the restaurant, and Ian was an amazing waiter.  The worst thing is the road to get there, but its worthy the washboard one lane road."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE Apache Lake, it is a \"Diamond in the Rough\"!!!  

I find the employees to be very pleasant and helpful....

I've been in most of the motel rooms, which have always been clean and some have the best mattresses for a great night sleep!!!  

The food is always EXCEPTIONAL.....Yummmm!!!  

I've met the owner's and they are Amazing and so inviting, they've always made me feel so  welcome when I'm there!!!

I totally recommend a visit to APACHE LAKE!!!"}
{"text":"Apache Lake Resort is a family owned and operated business. I went bow hunting out there and stopped in for breakfast. The food was great, service was excellent, and the view was phenomenal! Came back for dinner and drinks at The Big Horny Sheep Saloon and had a blast with Mike (bartender) and all the locals. Need WiFi but I'm not going to ding them a star, Mike said it's part of the \"remote experience\". Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"I go out to Apache Lake Resort each spring.
I love it out here.
The restaurant isn't to bad.
The rooms are ok.
And it is off the beaten path.
So there are not a lot of people that drive out here and stay here.
That's why I like it."}
{"text":"Apache Lake is beautiful and so much fun. This review is specifically for the \"resort.\" 
Fortunately, when you're at the lake you don't have to spend much time in the rooms so I will keep this short and sweet... BRING YOUR OWN BEDDING and try not to touch anything. 
You have been warned."}
{"text":"Oh baby, this is my favorite lake in the entire state.  It's positively gorgeous here.

I spent my summers as a kid at Apache and to me, it's better than any staycation at any of the resorts in town.  Skiing, wake boarding, tubing - so much more fun than any lazy river!  Jet skiing all day and waking up with every body part totally sore and sunburned, frizzy hair, a tad bit of a hangover and grabbing a cold beer with breakfast, ready to do it all over again - that to me is the perfect idea of summer.  

I've been here twice already this summer and I plan on spending every weekend I can here.  Typically, I'm a camping girl and love to camp.  However, I grew up on this lake with all the comforts of having a trailer until they tore them down in 2002.  So, I am accustomed to certain amenities (like A/C) when I come to the lake and I stay at the hotel instead.  The hotel is acceptable.  Ten steps up from camping.  We spend all day out on the lake, come inside for a nice cold shower, throw on a sundress and head to the bar for some drinks, meet up with old friends, laugh, dance, make out.  SO.MUCH.FUN!

**Pros 
Camping
RV hookups
hotel
restaurant that cooks the best biscuits and gravy I've ever had in my life
bar
store
wet slips for $12 a day
gorgeous scenery that makes you happy when you look at it
party cove
boat storage
incredibly, incredibly friendly people working here
It's too far away for all of the douchebags in their daddy's boats to come visit

**Cons
haven't you been paying attention?  There are none!"}
{"text":"We went in June so by noon it was too hot to touch anything and we bailed north. Nonetheless, not a bad spot for paddling. The lake itself was pretty desolate however the shoreline was full of families blaring music and such. Not the most peaceful spot if you're a paddler looking for that kind of scene. I made a little video review of it here:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jgm0huanXg"}
{"text":"Food and service was amazing. The crowd was easy going and I can't wait to go back! It is well worth the drive and you can't go wrong staying at the hotel. Gotta love the superstition mountains."}
{"text":"We were fortunate to find this restaurant while out exploring scenic State Route 88. The road turned out to be much slower than we had planned so Apache Lake Resort was a welcome lunch stop. Six of us visited and ordered from the menu. All enjoyed their meals. The menu has a variety to choose from and the dining area has lots of glass facing the lake. We would dine here again."}
{"text":"The store was kept clean the grounds were very clean the employees were very kind and nice we went into the restaurant to have a hamburger and fries the waiter had a great personality the food was awful. I could see us going back to buy things in the store and visit the lake but I just don't think we will ever return to the restaurant part."}
{"text":"A customer service disaster beyond compare!
The staff are completely unorganized and unhelpful. Several different staff members gave conflicting information and some were downright argumentative. The grounds are incredibly shabby and almost appear abandoned at times. They do not offer many common services to guests and I wouldnt bother asking about reservations."}
{"text":"The restaurant food is absolutely delicious! ! Well seasoned, not overcooked, highly recommend burgers, trout (for breakfast lunch or dinner!), asian chicken salad, chicken fried steak, and the over-easy eggs are perfecto!  Don't stop to eat in Tortilla Flats - wait another 1/2 hour and you won't be disappointed!  Plus they have a full bar and are way less busy. You can eat outside with a view of the lake."}
{"text":"This was our second trip to Apache lake with great friends!!! The dirt road from the 60 is a little challenging but well worth it.. The mountains are beautiful that surround the lake. We stayed in the hotel which there is not much to them but who really cares you go to enjoy the lake and have fun on the boat doing tubbing, wake boarding ect!!!!!"}
{"text":"I grew up fishing on Apache lake, wanted to visit the lake and do some fishing. The road to the resort was just as I remembered. The store restraunt and bar have a great atmosphere made even better by the great group of people that work there. The rooms show thier age but are clean and comfortable. For the best lake views stay in bldg B and C."}
{"text":"I've stayed at the Apache Lake Resort a good number of times over the years. It's been pretty much the same, as far as accommodations and service go, for over 20 years. It's a great value for the money. If you are looking for Marriott stay you'll be disappointed. It's an old hotel but it's clean. It has character and I would call it \"homey\". If you're paying less than $100 to stay on the lake what do you expect? If you are a dainty, choosy, fussy, picky, fastidious germ nut and a high maintenance complainer steer clear. You can sleep in your vehicle or camp. Leave this place to those of us who take life as it comes and can enjoy our experience at the lake as it is. And if you choose to ignore this advice quit posting and whining. It's obnoxious."}
{"text":"We stopped here for lunch while making our way up the Apache trail. The original plan was to have lunch at tortilla flat but the place was packed,  even on a Monday, so this was our plan b. The restaurant is actually called Jacks Landing but it is in the same building as the resort's main desk and the little general store. When we arrived we were the only customers, which was a bit odd.  \"The Shining\" came immediately to mind.  We were told by the resort cashier across the hall to grab some menus and seat ourselves,  so we did.  I'm pretty sure our server was also the cook,  but I suppose maintaining a proper staff at a place like this so far out is probably not so easy. He was nice enough though.  The menu offered a variety of things. We tried the southwestern chicken egg rolls which were surprisingly good,  but the nachos were a let down. Burgers were average but the onion rings and chicken strips were great.  They offer a wider menu at dinner but lunch turned out to be satisfactory overall.  Nothing to write home about but generally a decent option when exploring this beautiful area."}
