{"text":"Love this place. Excellent food, great prices and friendly staff. I've been here a number of times and always pleased.  T. Goody"}
{"text":"Great neighborhood location.  Small, friendly, good food and service.  Not a spacious but adequate.  Many basic homemade specality items.  If you have the time to enjoy the visit  it is a great place to visit"}
{"text":"I would only rate the food 2 star but I love the atmosphere. If you ever seen those old photos of highway cafes or the old Norman Rockwell's 30s art, this is the real day representation of it. Like I said, the food is the normal breakfast fare, nothing extraordinary except you get FREE coffee with your meal, unheard of right. Now it is not Starbuck's coffee but hey its free so you can't really complain about it. The service is great, this old waitress who is quick as someone 1/2 her age. I just like to hang out and look around and read my paper and eat. If you are really expecting some great food or even good food, then this is not the place for you. Food is okay and that is about it, but rest is five stars to some people, if you like modern, this is not it."}
{"text":"I have worked for the City of Mesa for 11 years and never knew this was here. Great staff, great food. I mean, cmon! They have a hillbilly breakfast! Feels like the Midwest. They treat you great! Will definitely be going again!"}
{"text":"I normally love their food but today the eggs were cooked to much and the ham also over cooked making it dry.  I definitely will be back,  service always good. May of been am off day for the cook."}
{"text":"We came here for breakfast on a Sunday morning. The diner was small with limited seating. The wait staff has to squeeze between chairs to wait tables. The food is country style and is delicious. They have a few unique dishes. After a short while, vintage cars began parking out front. This is a weekly breakfast group that drives these classics to the diner every Sunday. If you don't mind tight quarters, it's worth checking out."}
