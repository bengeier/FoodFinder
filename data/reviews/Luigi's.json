{"text":"This place was amazing. It reminded me of the little cafes I ate at in Italy. The pizza was to die for. We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"The sausage pizza was very good.  The crust was thin but not too crispy - which is how I prefer my thin crust.  I'm no sausage expert but they say it's house-made and I believe them.  It tasted good enough to be such.  The pizzas are a lot of food for a good price, and if you have a light appetite, they can easily be shared. Hopefully the pizza is this good every time - other reviews note inconsistency in that regard, which sucks, because my pizza was one of the better I've had in a while.

The meatball pasta was a flub however.  The tomato sauce was overabundant and way too acidic.  The pasta was overcooked in some places and undercooked in others; about half of the pasta was what I would call properly cooked.  And the meatballs were mostly flavorless and mediocre.  The sauce issue is odd because the sauce on the pizza had just the right amount of sweetness, and I'm sure it's the same sauce.  I would be reluctant to order any dish off the menu where the sauce isn't tempered by massive amounts of cheese and other ingredients.

A companion's prosciutto pasta was delicious however.  It's the only pasta that features a non-tomato sauce, and they should change that.

The decor seems to be suffering from split-personality disorder.  Industrial-style exposed ductwork?  Yep.  \"Rustic\" Italian stucco from the homeland?  Yup.  Classic pizzeria-style red-checked table cloths? You betcha.  It's pleasant enough but they may have been trying too hard.  Scratch that - they were absolutely trying way too hard.  The only thing missing is translucent-green plastic squiggly things hanging randomly from the ceiling.  And fake tuxedo shirts - oh wait.

Overall, Luigi's is a nice addition to the area, but not a transcendent experience by any means.  A typical Food Fight restaurant."}
{"text":"I always go to luigi's when I wanna eat pizza bc it's always delicious but this time not so much..the pizza was dry, Overcooked. The tomato sauce was gone. And the manager told me(he talked to the chef) that it was because the goat cheese dries the sauce... Are you kidding me? The tomato sauce dries when you overcook the pizza. And the pepperoni slices where dry also! 
Don't know what's worse the manager's attitude or the pizza. Disappointed. 
The cheesecake is pretty good though."}
{"text":"We wanted to like Luigi's.  Had been looking forward to trying it out. We felt all but forgotten while there. With small kids, we order our food fast so ordered the drinks, appetizers and pizza at once. They were out of 2 of their 5 appetizers. Appetizer came out just fine but then didn't see the waiter for 30+ minutes until he came with the dessert menu.  This is when we realized our pizza had not been made. After an hour of waiting, got our pizza and drinks refilled once (by then they were half full of water from the ice melting).  Pizza was decent but not good enough to overcome the poor service."}
{"text":"I ordered an $11 pasta dish from this company for delivery through Eat Street. When it came in a delivery container, I was beyond disappointed when I opened it up. For the $15 I spent with the delivery and tip, I got 4 ravioli noodles and barely enough sauce to cover them. I will never order from here again. When I contacted the store I recieved no response. Horrible customer service."}
{"text":"So after browsing at the nearby Sequoya library I stroll over and order a pepperoni pie. Waiter was pleasant, even chit chatted briefly. Small place but rhe seating was comfortable. I chose the wood bench but it was soft and curved to my spine. Felt like a massage.

So my pie comes and it looks homemade. The cheese is everywhere, sliding onto the crust edges and off it. But that doesn't perturb me in any way. I dig in.

I'm in love with the crispy, cornmealy crust. It's thin so I get to enjoy not having a mouth full of dough. Instead I get a mouthful of golden, crispy goodness. And it's greasy folks. At first its that good kind of greasy. After there's only a quarter of pizza left I start thinking about fat and calories so I take a napkin and soak up the grease. I'm guilty pleasuring with this greasy pie, but I don't want to fall into total depravity. 

The last slice is soggy from the grease but I still ate that bad boy. So I take one star away for that."}
{"text":"First off, this place is extremely family friendly.  At this point in our lives that is our number one priority when dining out.   Everything else takes a back seat!

We visited Luigi's for the first time on Saturday evening.  We went with another family.  So... 4 adults and 4 kids under the age of 3.  We arrived at 5:30p and had to wait about 30 minutes - the restaurant was packed!  Not a big deal - it was a nice evening - pletty of areas close by for the kids to walk/run around.  

The food was really good!  The adults shared  a salad (fancy), and a couple of pizzas (sausage and the special that day).  We really enjoyed the thin crust.  The kids menu offered pizza and some pasta options.  The kids portions were generous and reasonably priced.  

Our waitress - i forget her name - sorry! - was great.  She was attentive, but not pushy.  She also had a good sense of humor, which really helps when dealing with 4 children under the age of 3.  

The place was filled with a nice mix of people - families and couples, young people ,as well as, those with more grey around the edges.  The noise level was appropriate.  The concrete floors are a God send for easy clean up after the kiddies!

Luigi's will definitely get put into the rotation for our weekly family dinners out and about.

As Yelp says...  Yay!  I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"Ate lunch there yesterday, the pizza was fantastic.  The crust was crisp, but not tough, with fresh, flavorful toppings.  Service was also fantastic. Gretchen was my server.  She was very sweet and helpful."}
{"text":"I tried this place twice. It is pretty uneven. Service was choppy. Cheerful but our order was slightly wrong both times. It was quickly corrected. The pizza is OK but the crust is paper thin and the portion small. One pasta dish was great, the other was overcooked and dry. 
So I see potential but some adjustments should be made. Pizza Brutta nearby does a similar style pizza much more successfully, and Cafe Porta Alba does better with both  the pizza and pasta.
The dining room was cozy and inviting. I hope they work out the kinks because I am really happy to have a restaurant in this location."}
{"text":"I'll admit upfront that I am writing this review shortly after visiting Luigi's where I did drink a significant amount of wine. But we had a great time sitting outside and wanted to express my enthusiasm straight away. The staff was very friendly and the food was good.

To go into detail about how outgoing the staff was, the waiter went across the parking lot to the Chocolate Shoppe Ice Cream store to make our chocolate pudding cake 'a la mode'. The cake was very good. 

In conclusion: Pretty Good food (well above average Madison pizza), Very personable and outgoing staff, and a great all round experience."}
{"text":"Not sure why this place has 3 stars, we live a few blocks away so we come here often. The service and food has always been awesome, hands down my favorite Italian place!

Update: ordered the prosciutto tortellini I always get (my favorite) for delivery, and I'm not sure if it was the container they put it in, or if there was just barely any food, but it seemed like there was nothing in there, and it's typically such a huge order. It was rubbery and a little bit too brown, so they obviously had it under the heat lamp for way too long. Had to take a star off of my review, so disappointed! :("}
{"text":"Wonderful pizza with fabulous service
With definitely be visiting again!"}
{"text":"Pizza was good. I wonder why the water had such a strong taste though. Did not like the water."}
{"text":"I received a Food Fight Restaurants gift card from a friend. After reading the mixed reviews, I still ended up deciding to try Luigi's above the other restaurants. We initially went on a Saturday night. There was a 45 minute wait and we had plans later that night, so we left and decided to come back the next day. 

We returned on Super Bowl Sunday around 2pm. The place was very empty and we were seated right away. We ordered the garlic cheese bread and 2 pizzas: Pepperoni and the Whadayacallit. The garlic cheese bread was awesome! The pizzas were just okay. They weren't bad but they weren't very memorable either. 

You may like the pizzas more than I did, they just weren't my favorite. 

Since it was practically empty when we were there, the service was okay, but I can see it being slow on a busy night."}
{"text":"Fantastic meatball sub! Came with a side salad at a reasonable price. Unfortunately, I didn't get the full experience of the restaurant, as I dropped in between mealtimes, and just got carry out for myself. The proprietor, Matt, was very friendly and accommodating. I look forward to going back to Luigi's and bringing the whole family"}
{"text":"Heads up: the gluten-free pizza is not actually gluten-free. If you have an intolerance, don't take your chances. You will get sick."}
{"text":"My previous experience with Luigi's delivery was decent enough (except for a delivery guy who complained about how his brakes had just failed), so I thought I'd try again at 7:30 on a recent Monday night.  I ordered a sausage pizza and one of their salads - pretty simple order.  The man on the phone told me \"it'll be about an hour.\"  Okay, no problem; delivery takes a while.  Sometimes they're early, though, so I started looking at my watch after about 45 minutes.  Nothing.  Still cool; an hour's an hour, right?  

8:30 comes and goes.  A little less cool, but maybe the delivery person got lost.  

8:45.  The hanger has set in.  

9:00.  An hour and a half is not the same as \"about an hour,\" so I call back to check on the status and get a generic voicemail.   I double-check the webpage to make sure I got the number right - what business has a generic voicemail? - and see that they close at 9 p.m. Sunday-Thursday.  Uh.  So...where's my pizza that I ordered well before close?

I call back a second time and get a very harried woman.  I explain that I'm checking on the status of an order.  She confirms my address, then tells me that \"it should be there literally any second.\"

When the pizza finally showed up - at 9:15, an hour and 45 minutes after I ordered - it was beyond cool.  It was stone cold.  

Not worth the wait."}
{"text":"Hooray!  At last a restaurant within walking distance.  Luigi's is good.  We tried salad, pizza and pasta dishes.  I am very particular about pizza crust -- always hoping for that  New York/New Jersey thin crust, which is thin but flexible and tears rather than crunches.  Luigi 's comes pretty close, with nice slices of mozzarella and basil.  The pasta may not have been cooked in salted water, which left it bland.  Further, the pasta was a shade over cooked for my taste.  All in all, Luigi's is a much welcomed and tasty addition to the neighborhood!  Can't wait to try the paninis and the make your own cannolis."}
{"text":"Full disclosure: Outside of occasional visits to Gino's East in Chicago and Pizza Lucé in Minneapolis, my usual pizza M.O. is to pick up a pie at Papa Murphy's on the way home from work. My visit to Luigi's last night may change that. 

It's not that I don't like pizza. I just tend not to use my carb splurges for that. Happily, the crust at Luigi's is a carbophobes delight: razor thin, but flavorful and baked to perfection. We went with our usual (pepperoni and sausage), since my companion and I can rarely agree on other ingredients. The sausage is billed as \"house made\" and tasted wonderful. The pepperoni was...pepperoni. And the tomato sauce had just the right kick - not bland, not too spicy.

They have a nice selection of red wines - all for the same price. I love that they come in a quartino size - which is about a glass and a half. I always seem to want more than one glass - but not a full two. This was just enough that my companion (who isn't a drinker) could have a couple of tastes, too. 

The service was attentive and friendly, but not overpowering. And our pizza, the wine and a lemonade came to just over $20 (not including tip). Very reasonable for a mid-week dinner out. 

We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I have now been to Luigi's twice and I enjoyed it both times. The food was great and the staff did an awesome job!  If you like GREAT Pizza, served in an friendly, cozy atmosphere , then you will enjoy it as much as I do."}
{"text":"I had heard good things about this place and was looking forward to checking it out. In the end, the experience was just average. It's like this place hasn't reached it's full potential. I went with my Mom and we shared a carafe of white wine. The wine was not served very chilled which was disappointing. I ordered a small salad with arugula, mozarella, prosciutto and melons with balsamic dressing. It tasted good-but it was supposed to be an arugula salad and there was a lot of regular lettuce in it. The dressing was delicious. I think the presentation was a bit disappointing (the cheapy bowl it came in and the way the ingredients were cut up and thrown in) but overall it tasted good. I ordered the truffle oil fontina pizza and it was very good. My mom ordered the pizza with mushrooms, red onions and spinach and was disappointed in hers because it didn't have enough tomato sauce. Overall Luigi's was good - not sure if I would rush back. The prices make it affordable and they have outdoor seating which is nice. However, I think there are areas that can be improved to make it an excellent place."}
{"text":"I really like the salads, especially the fancy salad.  I also that there are gluten free options.  The pizza is yummy too!  The staff are always very welcoming.  They also have a great lunch special which includes a salad and slice for around 8 bucks."}
{"text":"Not sure why anyone would give this place a bad review.  Great crust and sauce..... And they deliver.    This pizza place was exactly what the neighborhood needed."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza! The atmosphere is casual yet a bit fancy. This is the first time we have had Luigi's but it is now my favorite pizzeria. The pizza was mouth-watering and didn't hurt my wallet."}
{"text":"I could squeeze the grease from a slice and use it to top off the oil in my car."}
{"text":"I have driven by this restaurant many times and always wanted to try it.  Well tonight we decided to try it.  We were sat right away.  Then proceeded to wait almost 20 min before a waiter came to our table.  When they finally showed up they were apologetic.      Since we had been waiting so long we already had our orders ready.  Our drinks and app came out quickly.  We got the garlic knots.  They were super tiny and very bland.  Not worth it.  What we ordered as our entree was the porky pizza.  And after an hour of waiting and being told several times it would be right out.  My husband went and found the waiter to see if it was close to being ready and surprise surprise no it was not.  So we said forget the pizza paid for what we had already had went to another restaurant for dinner.   We will never go back ever.  I wish there was a rating in the negative!"}
{"text":"Sat outdoors and had great iced tea and fantastic pizza.  Wait staff was really nice and atmosphere was just right."}
{"text":"Wonderful white sauce pizzas!!!! Fresh ingredients and the sausage is the best!
Red sauce pizzas  not as great.love the thin crust...reasonable price and great customer service"}
{"text":"Super quick service, a cozy atmosphere and delicious pizza. This place is great! My boyfriend and I came here for a date on a Saturday night without a reservation and were seated right away. I ordered a glass of Chardonnay and was pleasantly surprised with how much wine they give you (no such thing as too much wine). 

We ordered the Garlic Cheese Bread to start, which was yummy and cheap. And for our pizza we chose the Florentine pizza. I really enjoyed their white sauce, it was super creamy but not too rich. Sometimes white sauces can leave you feeling kind of gross but this one definitely didn't. We both loved the pizza, only complaint I had was the crust got a little soggy. I like thin crust pizzas that retain a little bit of crunch. 

Did I mention that they give you crayons and put a big white piece of craft paper on top of your table? That was pretty fun."}
{"text":"Luigi's has been one of my favorite places to eat since moving to Madison 3 yrs ago. I've eaten in and had delivery many times, but I probably won't ever again. On Thursday evening, I ordered delivery (directly from the Luigismadison.com site). The order was placed about 6:50pm, and the confirmation indicated it should arrive around 7:20 (I live only about 4 blocks from the restaurant). My family and I had had a challenging week and weren't up for cooking. The weather was nasty, so comfort food from Luigi's seemed the perfect option. When our food hadn't arrived AND we'd not received any calls or emails explaining the delay by 7:55, I started calling the restaurant. I don't know if others were having the same problem, or what, but all I got was a busy signal for more than 5 minutes. When I finally got through (a little after 8, and already more than an hour since placing our order), I was told the food was out for delivery and should be there any moment. It was almost 15 minutes before it actually arrived--again, I live less than 3 min from the restaurant--and when it arrived (an HOUR later than promised) the food was cold and the order was wrong (we'd ordered the vegetarian version of the spaghetti pie, but there were 2 huge meatballs and very little actual spaghetti in the dish). 

We received no explanations, no apology, nothing."}
{"text":"Love, love, love! What a wonderful addition to our little Sunset Village, not to mention the fantastic location adjacent to popular local shops we frequently patronize & our beloved, green Sequoya Public Library. But I digress. The pizza here is generously sized, beautifully presented, quickly served, and most importantly, authentically prepared, and oh-so-delicious. The service is prompt, friendly, courteous, and professional. The other night we wound up having a very interesting conversation with our server. We love to meet new people and this guy was interesting, educated, articulate, and friendly. One of our fav places in the 'hood to be sure! Deserts to die for as well if you have room after all the fab appetizers & mains."}
{"text":"Less than 8 minutes away and you won't deliver because I am on the wrong side of the beltline. Lost a customer for making me feel less because of the side of the beltline I live."}
{"text":"Pizza and salads are good. Can be a little greasy. Here's my beef. The smallest pizza they offer on the menu is a 12 inch. If you have a gluten allergy, you can order a \"gluten friendly\" crust. They only offer one size for this-a 10 inch, for an additional $5. FIVE DOLLARS MORE! That's highway robbery. 

The gluten friendly crust is pretty good, but I will go elsewhere just on principal."}
{"text":"Love the pizza, extremely quick pickup and excellent quality. Always order dough knots, sausage pizza and the forgetaboutit, so good. Only 4 stars because they forgot the arugula at pickup!"}
{"text":"Always great, fresh food.  Great customer service.  We used the online ordering for pick-up, very easy to use.  I ordered something they were out of and got a call within minutes to help me select something else."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been enjoying Food Fight restaurants for some time and consider Tex Tubbs to be one of our favorite restaurants with Monty's Blue Plate also in the running. This past Saturday we had spent the day on yard work and then decided to treat ourselves. We considered the usual choices but decided we wanted to expand our Food Fight experiences and selected Luigi's. 

We went in with fair expectations based on our excellent history with your other restaurants we have visited, and were excited to see what your Italian restaurant offered. Sadly we were quite disappointed. The restaurant was tidy and relatively quiet. We requested a booth and were seated near the kitchen. Normally this is not an issue, but it did provide an excellent line of site to the staff leaning against and sitting atop the counters behind the main dining area. For the duration of our visit no less than 3 and up to 6 staff joined in this activity. Our server was quite young but was polite. He overcharged us for our pizza which I did not notice until we returned home for the evening. the food was adequate, but that is the most embellishing I can do. My husband had a pasta dish which barely covered the bottom of the bowl it was served in, while I had a 12 inch pizza which we shared in the end. The pizza while made to order, had a limp crust and soggy middle. The experience overall was completely underwhelming. I am disappointed to say that we will not be returning to this restaurant, and if it were our first visit to a Food Fight restaurant it would have spoken loudly for the others.  The overall feeling we left with was that a half hearted attempt was made by staff from the kitchen outwards."}
{"text":"Tried Luigi's for the first time last night. Pleasantly surprised to be seated almost immediately - at 6:30 pm on NY Eve! Good thing - there's no place to stand while waiting where you don't feel like you are hovering over someone's table. (This seems to be a characteristic of Food Fight establishments - but I digress.) Friends ordered Marghareta Pizza, I had the Sequoya on gluten-free crust.  We all thought the crusts could have been crispier - a little too doughy for thin crust. Sequoya pizza had TOO MUCH CHEESE and not enough of anything else. The described pesto sauce, olives, feta, red peppers, and artichokes were almost non-existent, and completely overwhelmed by a solid layer of gluey and not particularly flavorful mozzarella. ICK. Friends' Marghareta looked much more cheese-proportional and they pronounced it good.  Service was slow (to be fair, though,  they seemed short-staffed), not particularly friendly, and we had to ask for water, plates, and silverware after the pizzas arrived. I want to like Luigi's - it's walking distance from my house and a welcome addition to my neighborhood - but it did not make a good first impression. I'll try again, hoping  it was just an off night."}
{"text":"I think Luigi's may be my new favorite pizza in Madison. Reasons: 1) thin crust, light in the stomach, but still very rich and delicious. I LOVE the cornmeal dusted crust.  Luigi's is a great middle ground between Pizza Brutta, which is sometimes just too skimpy, and Glass Nickle, which is sometimes just too much. 2) The  Truffle pizza was divine. I love truffle and mushroom pizzas, and this one was perfectly balanced with just the right amount of truffle. 3) The Margherita pizza. I would never order this style of pizza alone, I prefer heartier options, but we were with a vegetarian. However, this was a wonderful version of this style of pizza. The tomato sauce was so rich and flavorful...it was just a lovely  pizza. I will definitely be back to Luigi's!"}
{"text":"My wife and I tried Luigi's tonight and were mostly unimpressed. Although there were several tables open, we waited better than five minutes before we could interest anyone in seating us.   Then we sat.... and sat..... and sat.... And were about to walk out when a server finally came by and asked if we were ready to order.  We asked if he might want to take our drink order first which seemed to irritate him.  He took our drink order and returned a few minutes later w/o the drinks and asked if we were ready to order.  I asked about the drinks and Justin, our illustrious server, said he was \"in the area\" and thought he could \"save some time\".  That pretty much summed up our service--whatever was most convenient for him. 
  I had the lasagna which was just ok and lukewarm at best.  However, they earned a second star for my wife's pizza--that was darn good.  When it came time to pay the bill, an observant server (NOT Justin) swung over and said that he had seen us looking around as if we needed some help and took our credit card
  Bottom line:  Although the pizza is very good, it isn't worth enduring the lousy service--there are much better choices around town.  We won't be back"}
{"text":"I've had Luigis at least 20-30 times since they opened, but the only reason I occasionally still get it is because it is the closest place to get a bite to eat at.  The quality and size of the food is very inconsistent.  The same menu items are never really the same twice.  The ingredients and recipes are good, but the pizzas have trended towards being notably overcooked on the outside and very undercooked on the inside.  I have a feeling that this is intentional, and that maybe they are trying to emulate \"NY\" style thin crust.  I'm not sure.  Whatever it is, it's rather sub-par.  It just cannot hold a candle to Cafe Porta Alba which isn't too far away.  Even something like Glass Nickle is really much better, but like I said sometimes I suck it up and order because it's so very close.

Another thing I don't understand was the decision to go to full service.  I thought the counter service was a plus for them, because I don't know about other people, but I tip 20% standard for full service, and $0 or $1 total for counter service, so the switch to full service ups the price significantly for me, making it that much less competitive.  I used to compare it against places like New Orleans Take Out, QDoba, etc when I wanted good food without paying for service.  Now I compare it with all other restaurants and it cannot compare.  The place was kind of designed around the counter service, so an error in judgement seems to have been made.  Also they really need new side dish choices with the sandwiches.  The sandwich I had once was great but the cold noodle salad was a true joke.  Luigis was a nice concept that has been poorly executed.  If/when a competitor opens nearby, they will lose half of their business unless they change some things.  Hopefully they will."}
{"text":"Some of the best thin crust pizza I have had!  Cute decor, lots of interesting lighting ( one booth has a light up disco ball), and daily specials.  
Fresh Sangria & desserts finish you off.  We had two different salads to start, mine had a bit too much dressing but not a big negative for me.
Prices were also very reasonable with $2 kids meals."}
{"text":"Went with our 3 kids. I had a pizza which was pretty good. Like a lot of Neopolatin  pizzas it was soggy in the middle but ingredients were fresh and good. My husband had the lasagna which was also good. 2 of my kids ordered from the kids menu. (3d is a baby) The tiramisu was the bomb! The only downfalls I have to mention is that I was surprised that are total was almost $70. Also it is kind of dark in the restaurant. I would of liked a little lighter and brighter but maybe that's just me.."}
{"text":"I really like this place. The staff are always friendly and memorable, and the food is great. 

The pizzas are thin with a perfectly crispy crust. My husband orders the sausage and adds mushrooms. It's really good. He eats about 2/3 of it and has a nice treat for breakfast the next day.

I really like their \"fancy salad\" with fresh  greens, bleu cheese, real bacon bits and avocado slices. So darn good.

The cheese bread has roasted red peppers, bleu cheese and bacon, topped with mozzarella. Wow, that's good stuff!

It's a cute restaurant in a handy location. Save room for ice cream at Chocolate Shoppe!"}
{"text":"We tried Luigi's last night for the first time and we were pleasantly surprised. It's a nice cosy place that could probably get a little busy on a Friday night however we got right in and seated right away. The hostess was great and took time to explain some promotions while getting us seated quickly. Right after that our very friendly waitress came and got us settled with our drinks and an app ( cheese bread, which was perfect) and came back and took our order in a nice timely manner. All in all we were in and out in ~45 minutes.

First things first, I don't care how old you are who doesn't love drawing on a huge sheet of paper with crayons? Why don't more restaurants do this? Our food could have taken hours to come out and I wouldn't have noticed. I had masterpieces to create. 

We ordered a 16\" florentine pizza which was probably a bit much for two especially after the appetizer. It was dynamite, I think the white sauce was my favorite part. Gave a great base for the rest of the flavors. I haven't got a clue what specific brand of bacon they use but it had a good smoky flavor that was hard to miss. Another notable, my girlfriend ordered wine which is usually a peeve of mine because it's usually some ordinary wine and you pay $8 for a glass when the bottle was maybe $13 to begin with. I'm not a wine drinker and I have no idea what the quality of wine is there BUT THE IMPORTANT PART IS they gave her enough wine to justify the price of ordering wine. So I was pleased to see that. Im sure that makes me sound cheap but it's always something that's baffled me. Luigi's serving size made me feel better about it

As we were leaving the hostess and every employee along the way thanked us and asked us to come back, and we will!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, excellent service.  Family friendly atmosphere.  The Seqouia Bomber pizza is to die for!  Splurge and get the double crust option, you definitely won't regret it.  Our server Brett was very friendly and attentive and made a great meal and experience even better!"}
{"text":"I really wish I could like this place a lot because it is conveniently located to me. Pizza is okay. Center somewhat soggy. Lasagna is okay but doused in sauce. Actually that's a theme, Arthur salad which is very good otherwise should be ordered with dressing on side. Nice casual setting. Service was great on one visit, bad at next."}
{"text":"Not worth the high price. Take your $65 for two pizzas, a 2-liter, and an appetizer and go find a better restaurant. 

The crust was like cardboard (dry, which was surprising given that we ordered fatty meats). Toppings are limited, and very extra (in the millennial sense of the word). I like arugula as much as the next customer, but not on my 'za. The meatballs that we ordered as an appetizer were decent, but, candidly, they could've been frozen specialty foods from a higher end mass production facility. The sauce for the meatballs was... a red sauce that I could've made.

The pizza we bought was delivered earlier than promised, but the driver was... unfriendly is too strong... standoffish? Yeah. That's the right word. 

All in all, not what I expected when this was the restaurant that came up tops when I Googled \"best pizza in Madison\"."}
{"text":"I have never had anything but excellent food and an excellent experience here. I love how the mood is set with the music and decorations ."}
{"text":"This review is for delivery. Pizza was not satisfying, and pasta entree was a very small portion--only 7 dumplings. Don't waste your money. Overpriced and underwhelming food."}
{"text":"Thought this was a decent place to eat in Wisconsin, when we took my girlfriends 92 year grandmother here and they would not even turn the heat on for her when it was 60 degrees in the restaurant. The worst part was when we arrived I used the restroom to and saw one of the cooks coming out of the stall after taking a shit, only to see him not wash his hands and head right for the door. Absolutely disgusting! I will never be back and I hope the next visit they get is from the health department."}
{"text":"A bit more expensive than I would like but the pizza is always fast and delicious. Kind of a thin crust New York style pizza if I had to characterize it."}
{"text":"Best pizza I've had for a long time. Crust is soft and crispy and just perfect. We ordered the sequoia bomber and sausage. The former had artichokes. My girl ordered it and I expected it to be meh but actually it was very good. The latter was just amazing. Wish they would deliver to MN.  Also, did not bring my tape measure but let's just say it is rare for me to be defeated by a \"12 inch\" pizza. Seemed large to me!  Brilliant place."}
{"text":"Service- 5 stars
Food- 5 stars
I accidentally walked in here, and they have the lunch special for 9.5 includes 6\" of any pizza on the menu and a salad. Overall it's a great experience, definitely recommend to friends! 
??????????????????????????9.5 ??????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"We had the Featured 12 inch Vegan Pizza this evening and it was wonderful! The 12 inch does not have a gluten free crust and the sauce has coconut milk rather than olive oil. I believe this feature ends on Sunday so you will want to head out soon. It really is the best Pizza I have ever had!"}
{"text":"Finally got to visit the new Luigis with my kids.  We went mid-afternoon, so it wasn't crowded.
Pros: pleasant ( we chose the cute booth with disco ball by the door), quick service, nice people, kids meals are super cheap.
Cons: kids food was cold. My Italian wedding soup was reasonably tasty (better after adding salt & pepper), but the orzo in it was mushy. I was hungry, so ate in anyway.

In sum, the kids were happy, but I've had better food."}
{"text":"I had heard so much about this place I expected five star food but not this night. Our small sausage pizza was over cooked and terrible. My meatball sub, which I normally judge a place by, had a great bun, nice meatballs and cheese but was dry and totally tasteless. It's the sauce that makes the difference and it just had no pizzaz.I hate to say it but subway has a better sauce than what I got here. In hindsight I should have asked for a cup of sauce on the side to dip it in. I do like them sloppy so that might have made the difference. Our other diners had a 16 inch pizza that was perfectly cooked and very good so the place can do it but apparently not every time. The deserts were fabulous so be sure to look at that menu. Last, a little pet peeve of mine, our server, who was very good, needs to stop asking\"how is that tasting \" everytime  she walked by our table. It got annoying after about the third time. So, its is a cool little place and was busy and cosy but on this night I was not impressed and would not rush to return."}
{"text":"Always searching for a lunch deal - that's me. Luigi's may become my near West side place to go when I am out doing errands and crave some cheezy fresh pizza and a salad.
Lunch special - ANY pizza at 6 inch size with ANY small salad for $8.99. That is a good deal when the pizza is truly handmade with fresh mozz.
I chose the housemade spicy sausage pizza and the arugula salad. Crust was thin and perfect really. (fyi- I am super picky about pizza crust.) Sausage was tasty.
 The salad was BIG for a small salad; it came with lots of caramelized onions, walnuts and fresh goat cheese.
While a 6 in. pizza would not satisfy my husband - for me it is exactly right for lunch.

Service was very friendly and prompt even though the place was busy at noon with 80% tables full and one large kid party.

Tables have paper covers and crayons- fun!

They were offering some fresh fruit Sangrias - which sounded awesome - must go back and try those!"}
{"text":"Their delivery is spot on.
Their mushroom pizza- delicious.
the other ones all have a weird amount of olives as a topping and I don't love that. 
Really good location and convenient for those living close by who need a quick, tasty, and easy (and slightly indulgent) dinner.
I do want to try their pastas one day!"}
{"text":"We ordered a couple pizzas to be delivered to our work, so I can't review being at the actual establishment. Nonetheless, I was impressed by their pizzas! It was my first time having Luigi's so I'm glad to add this place to our pizza options if we get any cravings. 

The florentine pizza was extremely delicious. The white sauce was creamy, but not too heavy. The roasted garlic can be overpowering at times, but I love garlic, so I can't complain. The fancy salad was easily my favorite part of the meal, which is surprising since I love pizza. The toppings on the salad were a perfect complement to each other. Can't wait to try this place again!"}
{"text":"This may be the best pizza I've ever had. And I've lived all over the country and world while in the military for 20 yrs.  It's in the ingredients. High quality, unique.  The pie is cooked just right.  Incredibly flavorful. 
I drive all the way from Sun Prairie once a week to get this pizza.  Amazing. 
Great, friendly service as well.  

P.s. Shocked that this place only has 3.5 stars on here."}
{"text":"I'm always disappointed. It's expensive and 3 out of 4 times I have not liked my meal. Portion size varies drastically, too, especially with to-go orders."}
{"text":"It's painfully obvious that Madison is not a pizza town- at least not a good one.  Tonight I had Luigi's for the first time and I will say it is a diamond in the rough!  The homemade sausage is delicious and the crust is just crispy enough.  The only negative was that the delivery took over an hour and the pizza was cold.  I will forgive that this time and order again!"}
{"text":"Excellent lunch spot in new development just south of University. Great variety of choices. Awesome lunch special combo of pizza & salad (and not just the basic stuff). Wish I had tried one of their beer choices."}
{"text":"Not quite Neopolitan style, but very close. The Bada Bing pizza was a flavorful astonishment (bacon!!!), and the salad ahead of time was fresh and dressed properly. The wine list is short but enough to cover your dinner needs. The server was quite attentive (and she volunteered to fix a problem with the meal for my child even before we said anything).

It was not fair to Luigi, but we noted the Chocolate Shoppe across the lot and skipped dessert at the pizza restaurant in favor of ice cream.  But, for you, you have the choice of either (or both if you're really in a dessert mood!) - Enjoy."}
{"text":"I've been to Luigi's a handful of times because it's in a great location, and I want it to be good so badly, but it falls short every time.

When you first enter the restaurant, expect to stand in the entryway (you will not be able to avoid hovering over other patrons while they dine during this time) for a couple of minutes before one of the several employees milling around doing nothing behind the counter deigns you worthy enough to greet.

The dining room is dirty, dirty, dirty. There were napkins and food beneath our table from the people who sat there before us, there was marinara caked on the bench, and salt and pepper from the shakers were spilled all over the table beneath the piece of paper that they use as a tablecloth. Word of advice: Don't use the Parmesan cheese on the tables. When I noticed a foul odor coming from the shaker on our table, I unscrewed it and found moldy cheese inside. (I would have given two stars if not for the mold.)

The food was alright. We ordered dough knots as an appetizer and were disappointed not only by the small size, but by how greasy and unseasoned they were. I have ordered them before and gotten large, fluffy knots cooked and seasoned to perfection, so I was really looking forward to these, but the inconsistency was disappointing. As far as the pizza, some slices were loaded down with toppings while others barely had anything on them, and the crust was cooked really unevenly. 

Our server was friendly but careless and slow; he walked by our table full of dirty dishes dozens of times before another server (not ours) got them out of our way, and we had to practically beg for drink refills. This wouldn't be that big of a deal if it were super busy, but it wasn't, and all of the workers seemed to just be lingering behind the counter, having loud, personal conversations. I was put off by how sloppy some of the employees looked, too. People working in food service owe it to their customers to look hygienic. Body odor, long and greasy hair that isn't tied back properly, dirty fingernails, etc. are total turn-offs for diners."}
{"text":"Luigis is either the best or they are way off. There's not really an in between. This is my go to for when I want to order pizza because I think it's a better option than glass nickel or any of the chains. I like the variety of luigis pizza, they offer many different options and unique combinations. The dough knots are also out of this world. I'd also like to add that I normally hate sausage but there's is delicious, I won't order sausage anywhere else. Now, I'll explain why sometimes they are off. Sometimes they'll mess up your order or food is undercooked which result in soggy crust or some raw dough in the dough knots."}
{"text":"Good thin crust pizza. We had the Dough Knots as an appetizer, the 10-inch Popeye Pie for dinner and took home a slice of the Italian Creme Cake. Can't complain -- all was tasty. Best part? The price. The cake was somewhat of a splurge ($6.50, but the slice is huge) - otherwise, it would have been a $12 dinner for two. 

We'll be back to try more pizzas.

We were there early for dinner on a Wednesday and it was not crowded (not shocking...). Our order was taken at a table, though several people came in to order to-go and went straight to the counter."}
{"text":"Uneven service, near room temperature food, long wait times - the Bada Bing pizza was nothing special and had sat for likely 20 minutes due to the near room temperature it was finally brought out at after over a half hour of waiting. 

The meatball appetizer was also not warm enough. It was brought out by itself with no silverware or plates for sharing, you have to ask for those I guess.

Very mediocre food and slow service."}
{"text":"What a travesty.  Sysco headquarters.  Ingredients were terrible.  Pizza, if you can call it that, was almost inedible and the kids pasta was worse than a cafeteria.  The interior was corporate and obvious.  They were running a raffle for a bike or something that was bizarre for a restaurant.  Terrible Disney-fied Italian."}
{"text":"Luigi's...........today was my first visit. Service, good! Salad, good!! Pizza, GOOD!!!!! Our server was lovely with just the right level of attentiveness. I ordered the Italian Chef salad and the personal sized Bada Bing pizza for lunch. Loved it!

The kalamata olives on the salad really worked and the pizza, wow! I'm a big fan of white pizza and this one was no exception. The crust was perfect, in my book, and the combination of bacon, fontina cheese and caramelized onions was sheer happiness in my mouth. I can't wait to try out more of their menu!"}
{"text":"Had the worst experience with delivery. Took 1.5 hours to arrive and then it did it was cold. The pizza was so salty and greasy. Got a refund but very disappointed!"}
{"text":"A typical food fight restaurant.  Nothing too great but also nothing that will turn you off.  I stopped in for a work lunch and they have a decent lunch special-any of their salads along with a 6\" pizza (any type) for $9.50.  I opted for the arthur salad (greens, corkscrew pasta, sun dried tomatoes, proscuitto, walnuts in a balsamic itralian dressing) and the spicy shrimp pizza.  Of the two, I preferred the salad over the pizza.  It wasn't overly dressed and liked how  all the ingredients tasted together.  The pizza was a bore.  It was advertised as roasted rock shrimp but they tasted boiled and very plain.  The spicy tomato sauce didn't bring the kick and it was all around a very average pizza.  Our server, knowing of our time crunch, was speedy and quick to the task.
Is it in the top 3 for pizza place in Madison?  No, probably not even in the top 5.  But for a quick lunch, it served its purpose."}
{"text":"We were promptly seated after walking in with another mom and her kiddo.

The server was polite and conscious. Helped recommend beverages for my friend and I. Kiddos could order their own simple pizza, or they could share an extravagant pizza.

We ordered the truffle pizza, originally came out saturated in truffle oil, and soggy or doughy, perhaps both. 

No biggie the server promptly requested the kitchen make a new one extra crispy, or put through the oven twice/twice as long.

Everything was delicious."}
{"text":"Long ago I gave this place 2 stars...I really wasn't happy my first few visits.  I didn't go a lot for a while but in the past few months I've been here several times and I wanted to hate it...but they really won me over.  I do enjoy it...quite a lot!  I still wish their menu had more items and variety on it but what they've got is solid.  The pizza is just tasty and seems to be of top-notch quality ingredients.  Ohhhhhh and the dough knots.....mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm. (Homer Simpson voice) dough knooooooooooots.

I also still wish they had a separate lunch menu.

Hey owners: the space next-door is opening...time to invest...expand the kitchen and thus the menu...add a bar...you'd be the bees knees...I'm just sayin'.

LOVE the mega-reasonable kids menu."}
{"text":"To be honest, I was very disappointed. I had high hopes for their restaurant week menu and I have found the other Food Fight restaurants to be exceptional, but the food was underwhelming and the service was pretty lousy. The fig and prosciutto flatbread app would have been really tasty if it didn't have such a cardboard-esque crust -- no flavor and over baked. Next came the pork and apple sandwich, which was in desperate need of a sauce of some sort. The thing was dry as can be, which was a bummer because you really have to try to mess up a panini! Lastly, the cookie dough cannoli. I thought this might be the redeeming dish because I've heard great things about them, but alas, this too was disappointing. My waiter, having admitted that he himself prepared it for the first time, put a measly squirt of the cookie dough, leaving me with mostly just the shell to eat. I expected there to also be marscarpone filling, but I was told it was in the dough. Sure. I find it hard to believe that this sad excuse for a cannoli is the dessert they are known for. Never mind the food, the service was just as poor. Every one of my dishes was brought out by a different waiter, sometimes even by the hostess who kept leaving her post by the door. I saw at least three groups leave because they didn't see tables and no one was there to greet them. All said and done, it was not worth the time or $15 by any stretch."}
{"text":"Had lunch here the other day for the first time. I had driven by countless times and finally decided to go there for lunch. I was not disappointed. The ambience was good, restaurant was very clean and the host was courteous and friendly. I met a friend for lunch and we both ordered the sausage pizza. 

I have to say that it was probably the best pizza I've had in years. The thin crust was crispy but not over cooked and it had just the right amount of cheese, sauce and sausage. The waiter was attentive but not overbearing. Prices were maybe a little in the high side for some but $9.50 for a small pizza seemed reasonable to me. I will be back...often."}
{"text":"We order carry out from this place regularly and love the pizza. Delicious, crisp crust, high quality toppings and super fast, less than 20 minutes for pick up. 
The staff at the counter is not overly friendly or attentive to waiting customers.
Eating and chatting seems to be their priority. Again the pizza is delicious but the presentation is very inconsistent. We have come to the conclusion that they have an A,  B and C cook. Sometimes the pie is well shaped and loaded with toppings that are evenly distributed. Other times the shape resembles one of the 48 states and toppings are few and mostly in the center.
If you are looking for fresh delicious pizza this is where you will find it."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza and great fresh mozzarella). Service left something to be desired. We arrived one hour prior to closing, and our initial service (getting drinks, taking our order, getting our appetizer) was painfully slow. Then it appeared that the wait staff realized that closing time was approaching, and the rest of the night we had incredibly speedy - borderline rude - service. As we walked away at five minutes to closing, I observed a waiter lowering an outdoor umbrella and nearly hitting a patron in the head.

The pizza was great, but I think I'll stick with take out or delivery from now on."}
{"text":"I have driven past Luigi's hundreds of times and read the mixed reviews here on Yelp and elsewhere, but on Friday I was out with the kids, with whom pizza and pasta is always a hit, so this time we finally stopped in. They were busy, but we didn't have to wait for a table. 

Unfortunately, we waited a while for the busy server and for our appetizers (although the entrees came out very shortly after the apps). The dough knots were well baked, crispy on the outside, chewy on the inside, with a golden brown, buttery finish and topped with parmesan. Good appetizer. The garlic cheese bread came out about 10 minutes after the knots. If it had been 8 minutes, it would have been perfect -- it was a tad overcooked. The marinara dipping sauce for both appetizers was fresh and thick, if a bit heavy on the garlic. . 

The kids ordered their $2 entrees (yes, I said $2 kids' meals!!!) -- buttery pasta and an individual cheese pizza (the sausage was $0.50 extra). The blood orange Italian soda was refreshing on this mild summer evening. I had a 12\" sausage & tomato pizza. The cornbread-based crust was crispy and the tomatoes were fresh if not plentiful. This pizza is more than enough for two people; I brought half home for my wife.

One star for fresh ingredients, one star for $2 kids' meals, one star for a 4/5* pizza and one for the excellent desserts (you can tell they're a sister restaurant to Hubbard Ave.). If you're expecting gourmet Italian, you'll be disappointed; for casual dining with a good variety and value for families, Luigi's hits the spot."}
{"text":"I really want this place to be awesome. We have been here 4 times, and each time it has declined. The crust is really really bad, which is unfortunate, because I think the toppings are good. Fancy salad is very good, but the large vs the small was mostly noticeable in price. The manager was extremely nice and helpful, every time, but everyone else acted as if they wanted to be elsewhere. Like I said before, I really want this place to be awesome. Unfortunately, it isn't even good. And I am hoping desperately for improvement, because it is very close to home and I would frequent it!"}
{"text":"Think: friendly, neighborhood pizzeria. 

Luigi's starts with 3.5 to 4.5 stars for doing a good job as a reasonable, sit-down pizza place with very respectable pizzas.

So in a city with an abundance of pizza offerings, is there a place for another pizza joint?

For Luigis's the answer is Yes. Here's why:

-Wide selection of different, yet inspired, pizza offerings - in particular, about half the pizza menu is white sauce pizzas. Consider the Bada Bing, which includes grilled asparagus,  caramelized onions, bacon (plus other toppings) on a white sauce.
-Sit-down dining; a great option for families or small groups that want something nicer than dining but not over-the-top
-Thin crust (corn-meal crusted) is an excellent option 
-Location: it's nice having an option on the near West side that's not HillDale or University Ave. Sequoya Commons also hosts the public library and The Chocolate Shoppe which makes for a great line-up for some quality family time.   

It's 4.5 but I'm rounding up since service is friendly and earnest."}
{"text":"\"The Goods\" pizza is delicious, and the 12\" serving is actually quite a bit for two people! We also got the half order of garlic bread, which was also surprisingly large. Our waiter was kind and accommodating. It was not busy at all on a Sunday night. We will try again!"}
{"text":"I love Luigi's (and I make homemade pizza, so I'm pretty picky). Their specialty pizzas make your pizza experience extra special/unique from other pizza places - I really like the white sauce options. Or if you prefer classic pepperoni, they can do that, too. It's a small, cozy restaurant and can get a little noisy at times, but it is family friendly so that's just the culture/atmosphere. Maybe not the quietest date night you are hoping for, but it's such sweet decor and the food is great - I say pretend you're in Italy and enjoy the humanity! Some of the best cheesecake and tiramisu I've ever had. Don't skip the dough-knots. They do carry out as well if you prefer."}
{"text":"Bland pizza no matter how many toppings they put on it. The mozzarella overpowers it all and the quality of the cheese isn't great to begin with. I had lost hope with Madison pizza before coming here and this experience doesn't change my opinion. 

2 stars for fast and friendly service."}
{"text":"Always get the Arthur salad - mixed greens, balsamic dressing, walnuts, some sort of delicious and salty meat, cheese, sun-dried tomatoes, and noodles. Sigh.

Sometimes get the dough knots. 

Have tried many pizzas. Favorites are Bada Bing and Fugetaboutit (green olives instead of kalamatas and no onions).

Have enjoyed carry out, delivery, and dining in equally."}
{"text":"A year ago I would have left a 4 star score but not today.  Recently Luigi's updated their menu, and the focus is now more on pizza.  Their pizzas are great but they have only 3 items under pasta.  There are many Italian restaurants in Madison that offer plenty of pasta options so having such a limited pasta section is not the smartest move.

Yesterday I went with 2 friends for dinner.  I ordered the spaghetti pie without the meatballs.  When I saw my bill I was a bit surprised to see they charged the same price for my dish.  If I knew that was going to happen, I would have asked for the meatballs on the side and given it to my one friend who is a meat eater.  Another disappointment was that they gave me a tiny (and I do mean tiny!) round piece of bread with my pasta dish.  What up with that?!

Otherwise, the food was good.  All of us enjoyed our meals.  My one friend commented that the pizza she ordered (chicken with goat cheese and onions) was good but not as good as Grandpas Pizzeria on Williamson St.  The appetizer we ordered, the cheese and garlic bread, was absolutely fab!  We all commented that it is probably the best cheese bread we've eaten yet.

I'll go back for sure.  The restaurant is small and quaint.  The menu is not cluttered which I prefer.  The prices aren't bad either.  For the 3 of us including tax came to $42 and change for an appetizer, 12 inch pizza, the Arthur salad, spaghetti pie, iced tea, diet pop and an italian soda.  Service was pretty good too."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely incredible. The food is amazing! I have had the best pizza of my entire life here. It was a special but it had olive oil, mushrooms, spinach, and more stuff on it. You could really taste the olive oil and it was so high quality and delicious. We went on a Tuesday night and we were seated right away but I have been on other nights and it takes a very long time. But, the food is incredible so I'm generally inclined to wait. Every waiter that I've had has been incredibly nice and helpful."}
{"text":"I've had Luigis now about ten times in the last year and I must say, I'm a fan. I've only had it for carry out so I can't speak of the table service. 

I truly believe that Luigis makes some of the best pizza in Madison, without a doubt! It's not Neapolitan and it doesn't pretend to be. However, it does sort of on the surface maybe a little bit resemble neapolitan pizza but with a real midwestern twist.

The pizza has been somewhat inconsistant over the last year (mainly in the first few months)  but I feel they've worked out all the kinks.

If you live on the near west side then I highly recommend calling ahead and picking up a double cheese (thick) baddabing to go, with a side of spinach and artichoke dip. Order doughnuts with dipping marinara as well, they make for a great little side.

I don't think I would be sitting down for dinner since I can't have a rum drink here. 

Either way, It's a great addition to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Luigi's is a staple for my wife and I. Their menu creatively pairs fresh ingredients that I would not normally have expected to go well together and doesn't just make them work, they are made to work very well. 

We've had perhaps a dozen pizzas from them and have not been disappointed once.

Their pasta is very good but not nearly so standout as their pizza (which I suppose is why it is Luigi's Pizzeria and not Luigi's Pastaria). 

If you have a hankering for some brilliant combinations that stray from your usual \"Sausage and pepperoni\" fare Luigi's is a must."}
{"text":"I was going to rate this four stars, but then asked myself \"why only 4\"?  And I had no good answer.  

I took a colleague there for lunch (his suggestion) and we both ordered the lunch special (small salad, small pizza) for $8.99.  And holy cow was that good!

First the salad.  I wouldn't call them \"small\".  It wasn't huge either, but for being 50% of the meal, it was properly sized.  I had \"the Arthur\", which was very tasty.  The roasted peppers weren't overpowering and the candied walnuts added a nice zest I didn't expect.  

Next, the pizzas.  The lunch combo comes with a 6-inch pizza.  While I could have eaten more, it was an appropriate lunch portion.  Since it was my first visit, I went with a standard Italian sausage 'za.  Gotta have a benchmark...  Oh my!  The crust... the sauce... the sausage... the cheese - it was all fantastic.  I *wish* I had more!!  My colleague got \"the rocket\" pizza, which looked really good (on the menu write-up as well as on the table).  I will get that one next time...

For me, this wouldn't be a \"grab a pizza on the way home\" sort of meal.  This is a \"I deserve a fancy treat for lunch\" establishment.  Lucky for me, I deserve treats often, and I will be back again!"}
{"text":"So my friend and I snuck out of work for a lunch date.  We called in a pizza order as we were driving so it would be ready when we got there.  We enjoyed a pizza that came out soon after we sat down.

Our wait staff was friendly and helpful to get us back to work in time for the afternoon.  Luigi's is a nice neighborhood gem."}
{"text":"Second night of having Italian so my review may be a bit biased. I had the lasagna which was pretty good but I cannot say it stood out to me as spectacular. My family seemed to enjoy their meals. I thought it was nice of the restaurant to give a fam member a piece of cake for free (his birthday)."}
{"text":"This a fun little gourmet pizza place.  Matt, the owner, is very amicable and will chat it up as he checks in on you.  

Been here a couple of times.  The pizzas are great, the salads are too.  Service is attentive and fun to interact with."}
{"text":"I went to Luigi's tonight, and, call me jaded, but although the small $3.99 'fancy' salad was really tasty (blue cheese, nice greens, toothy thingies) the bowl it came in was (as one poster intimated) like something from a garage sale (and as another posted intimated, it was like a big pile of hacked up stuff).   The B. B.  pizza  (I won't spell it, just as I avoided pronouncing it at the restaurant)  was a sumptious treat, with a vast sea of cheese on a flat, flat crust highlighted by bacon peaks and sweet caramelized onion hills - - the thing was delish.  The welcome from the staff, and the obsequious service (no choice but to tip 25%; actually in many ways stellar excellent), was something that normally you would be grateful for, except that it
 was WAY over the top ingratiating.  Like WAY.

Will I go back?   Yup."}
{"text":"So YUMMY! This place has excellent service, good food, and delicious pizza! It's something about the cheese that they use, that makes me want to drive from Chicago all the way to Madison just for their pizza."}
{"text":"I came to this place really wanting to love it. The decor is creative and kitschy. The atmosphere is fine. Ordering is done at the counter.

The kids pasta and meatball was very good. The arugula salad inexplicably came with greens, no arugula. The chicken pizza was too thin for my taste, and much too greasy. Does not compete with Belitalia, the best pizza in Madison, IMO. Wish it was better.

I did not take the leftover pizza home with me."}
{"text":"Quick service, nice waiter but food is quite mediocre. I ordered a prosciutto and arugula pizza. The prosciutto was so scarce that I barely feel it and the arugula was three days too old. I also ordered a salad and it wasn't great. They just put the greens and dumped some dressing over it. Greens were too dry and they didn't even mix it.  The garlic cheese bread was good but not enough for me to come too often.  I think that with just some additional effort it would be a nice neighborhood restaurant but not there yet in my opinion."}
{"text":"The first time we were here it was for dinner. It was very crowded and a bit slow but the pizza was delicious.

We came back two days ago for lunch. It was reasonably priced with the perfect amount of food for lunch! For about $8 we each got a small salad and a 6\" pizza. I got the bada bing and he got pepperoni and mushroom. 

I highly recommend the bada bing- it has bacon, fontina, white sauce, caramelized onions, grilled asparagus, and roasted mushrooms. YUM"}
{"text":"This place continues to raise prices and serve inferior food- my $14 pepperoni and onion pizza, with a handful of onions plopped in the middle of a few pieces the pie was cut into 9 pieces and the crust is black...Food fight is right! Keep serving this shit food and I'm gonna start a fight! Terribly inconsistent and the last time I was there the pizza man was in the bathroom with me and didn't bother to wash his hands when exiting-guess he couldn't read the multi lingual sign!"}
{"text":"Really liked this place! Friendly service and food was great. We had some dough knots for an appetizer, a sausage and mushroom thin crust pizza and split a spinach salad with a glass of sangria. It was all really good and came to a total of $36. We will definitely go back and try other pizzas and more sangria. Love frequenting locally owned places."}
{"text":"I'm not a \"foodie\", people, so bare with me.... this is going to be a \"normal\" review. I guess I could go into this review in chronological order...

The ambience of this pizzeria was 'pizza-y\". It was loud, a hand full of kids and the servers had those tuxedo T-shirts on. Kinda seem hokey. 

My 2 friends and I went here on a Saturday afternoon/evening. We had to wait 20min to be seated which is expected for a Saturday, So I'm not complaining. We had soda (also serve alcohol) and chatted while we waited. I was surprised on how small the menu was (one page, front and back). The waitstaff was funny and friendly but I hardly could get a refill on my drink. No problems with the pizzas or our order in general. I had a chicken pizza which was pretty good. We all had dessert, in which I had cheesecake. PRO- it was twice as tall as a normal restaurant slice of cheesecake. To-go boxes were needed for all. The price was average, maybe a tad above average. 

I'd have to say the whole experience (quality, quantity, service, price) was average. Thus the 3 stars. 

Would I go again? Yes, if I was given a gift card. 
No gift card? I rather go downtown..."}
{"text":"Went to Luigis this evening to check it out. Our family used to patronize this restaurant when it was located downtown near the square and always enjoyed it. But something has dramatically changed. My son and I ordered two different salads and both salads were excellent. I enjoyed the house viniagrette dressing as did my son. But we both were very disappointed in our pizza's. He ordered the pancetta pizza and the crust was overdone on the outside but inside was soft and underdone. 
I ordered the Margherita Pie and was very disappointed. It was salty and the crust tasted like it was made with \"Boboli\" bread from the supermarket. I am a huge fan of pizza, especially the so-called NY thin crust pizza. But this place does not qualify for that style of pizza! I will not return!

Madisons Pizza Brutta is still the best place in town for the real deal in pizza!"}
