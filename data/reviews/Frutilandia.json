{"text":"Speak Spanish food was great only thing is they don't have AC"}
{"text":"Will never go back first it's overpriced and second we ordered a Strawberry Raspado and Frozen Fresas with Crema they were awful, smelled rotten and the strawberries in the Raspado were rotten very disappointed"}
{"text":"Hidden gem in Mesa. Love stopping in with the kids and getting the Macedonia and strawberries and cream. Unbelievably yummy. Just wish they had a better location so you could sit outside with children and family and feel comfortable. Don't let the location fool you since it is in the rougher part of Mesa."}
{"text":"Never disappointed! Everything here is so yummy!  The staff is friendly, its always busy but they move really fast usually Pros: all of their yummy food & snacks  Cons: the place is to small now for all the people that come in  Always a good time!"}
{"text":"Love coming to this place!!! They are so good and clean the ingredients are fresh and made to order. I drive far to come here when I feel like having a little bit of home."}
{"text":"Wow, I'm really surprised this place has so many good reviews. I went for the first time tonight and did not care for it at all. I got the mango raspado and it really just wasn't very good. The mango flavor was very weak. It actually tasted like it had that sweet syrup on it that is canned fruit. Oasis is 10x better than this place. I thought I would try this place since Oasis is currently closed but I won't be back here. I'll just wait for Oasis to open back up."}
{"text":"This was a hidden gem for the longest time and I was very happy to see that they were able to extend their business to Superstition Springs. I came here once on a whim after a friend had suggested it. My first order and every order since? An Escamocha Especial. Chopped fruit, granola, honey, and sweet cream, topped off with a scoop of your choice of ice cream (vanilla every time, for me).   It is a little on the higher price side -however- the fruit is always fresh and delicious. Every time I have gone in, there are workers preparing fresh fruit in the back. Do not let the area of this location fool you. The shop itself has always been clean and sanitary when I have gone and the service is good, although the parking can be a bit of a squeeze at times."}
{"text":"First time trying something here. I chose the Escamocha with strawberries. Ohh so delicious. Light sweet cream with hint of honey, granola, raisins, and shredded coconut. Large container for $9."}
{"text":"The employees were rude and arrogant. For the kind of staff that they serve I think is too expensive -might as well just get yourself a meal. I bought a raspado there, and it was disgusting. Never waisting my time or money in that disgusting/unfriendly place. Ever."}
{"text":"The vampiros are really great and they are done fresh.  The Aguachile (Drowned shrimp) and ceviche are really good.     Be careful if trying to get a vampiro after 9 pm; they say they clean the machine at 9 pm even though they close later than that.  I do not recommend the Vaso de Elote because it tastes like it came out of a can.  The shrimp cocktail is also a bad choice."}
{"text":"This place specializes in desserts and fruit drinks. I made the mistake of ordering 2 shrimp cocktails and a cheeseburger combo. The shrimp cocktails hardly had any shrimp in them. I paid $22 for clamato, water, cucumber, and avocado. I had to go home to doctor up the flavor. I'll be making this at home from now on, and doing a much better and less expensive job of it. I ordered a cheeseburger combo for my granddaughter. The cheeseburger and fries were much better. The quality and quantity of the combo was very good. My only complaint about the combo was that we didn't receive the drink that was supposed to come with it. The cashier didn't ask what I wanted to drink and I really had my hands full with the grandkids and didn't think about the drink till I got home. If you go in with a buy one get one half off coupon, dont expect for them to take half off the second exact item. The cashier took 50% off of the least expensive item ordered. The employees were nice, but it will be a while before I go back to this place. I'll give it a second chance with dessert, but as I said before i'll make my own shrimp cocktail from now on."}
{"text":"Very good quality and good service as well as a nice clean establishment. I was happy with my experience and would recommend  it."}
{"text":"Saw the recent write up in the New Times, thought I'd make the trek to Mesa to check it out. I ordered the escamocha, which is chopped fruit, sweet cream, granola, coconut, & honey.   It comes packaged in a to go container which was a good thing because I couldn't finish the huge portion they gave me. Loved it! Will be making another trip soon to try the freaking carne asada fries!!"}
{"text":"Todo es muy rico pero carísimo.  La escamocha es mi favorita   Los raspados de guayaba están ricos.  La comida no la he probado pero tampoco se me antoja pues es un lugar más como para refrescos y neveria"}
{"text":"Love this place!!! Fruit drinks, Mexican snacks, smoothies, I haven't had anything bad."}
{"text":"This place was just what the doctor ordered on a hot summer day! So happy we took a chance on this place over coldstone. I tried the macadonia with coconut icecream... YUM!!!"}
{"text":"This is pretty much a clone of La Michoacana, they make several kind of Mexican dessert on-the-go; good flavors, not the best but just an average place for antojitos mexicanos."}
{"text":"Place is so good, everything was so good! Got the strawberries and cream and the watermelon, perfect way to end the week!"}
{"text":"Love this place!!! Tostada ceviche, escamocha, excellent, service everything delicious"}
{"text":"I usually love coming here. I love the corn, and any of the drinks really. However, I came last night to get 2 orders of corn and waited 25 minutes. What bothered me the most is that no one told us we would be waiting. A group of people who looked like they were either friends or employees came in and ordered several items and some corn as well. They all got their food before I could get even one order of corn. 25 minutes is excessive. At least come up to us and tell us we will be waiting, or offer some water while we waited. I would recommend serving your customers in the order that they come."}
{"text":"Well this is long overdue. It's been a month ago that I visited the place with my sister.... I just want to bring this up with the owners since, I really didn't like the way their manager treats people.  A very young lady was the one that was helping us, although \"Rosa\" who is the manager and seems to act like the owner  just looked at us and not even gave a welcoming smile.  ROSA, YOUR MANAGER, SHOWS DISCRIMINATION.  The reason I said this is for that reason-- she looked at us only and does not even help the young lady wherein  we ordered  3 things which needs preparing and no other customers were there.  However, when a couple of mexican ladies came in; oh,  Rosa was all smiles and welcomed them in and assisted them right away... That is when I asked the young lady if she was the owner, and I was told that she was just the manager.  I tipped the young lady and told her that it was only for her but she apparently said that it was a community tip jar.  Why would a person deserve to be tipped if she does not treat all customers the same way.  Also, I work as an operations manager for a restaurant with 5 other locations and I never ever discriminate on any of our customers. I, my managers, and crew treat new and returning customers the same way, regardless of what origin & color they are with respect and good accommodations.   I just hope you train your manager real well and not to  put her position in her head!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is friendly and clean the food is good the treats are better like the strawberries and cream omg so good."}
{"text":"Love this place for their wide variety and great choice of ice creams. Be ready to raise your sugars and gain some pounds."}
{"text":"Best place in Arizona especially the strawberries and cream I've been in 3 different times and it always great"}
{"text":"I love the fresas con crema here. I order the naturales and add granola. It always is really clean and cashiers really friendly. I look forward to trying out other menu items."}
{"text":"where can I start slow unfriendly service... I ordered a mangoneada lets just say it taste like tamarindo... and it's supposed to be mango the mango was not even ripe and raspado was tasteless  and very coarse and clumpy ice...I also ordered tostilocos huge portion but once again bland and tasteless will never come back"}
{"text":"Worst mango respado ever! The mangos were mush and didn't even taste like mango. The place was very clean."}
{"text":"What a rip off!!! We stopped in today for desert after dinner. $7.95 for a small plastic container of chopped fruit, 6 small pieces of watermelon, non ripe mango, cantaloupe, and 4 small pieces of pineapple. They don't even season the fruit. Family of 4 with small kids $22. I know this isn't a vendor on the streets of Mexico who serves fresh fruit cheaply, but this place can do much better than it is currently doing. Good concept, desperately needs a staff that is passionate about what is served. Not a young woman more worried about her cell phone then she is about serving paying customers. I am in shock with how much money they charge for a small container of poorly chopped fruit. Cut the fruit in Spears, season the fruit, serve politely to paying customers. This was more like a cold and sterile fast food experience than what I expect from a cocktail de fruita shop."}
{"text":"Place is really good I loved the tostiloco The watermelon was amazing as well perfect way to end the week"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a fresh fruit salad, look no further! Fruitilandia in Mesa has to covered. The fruit is mouth watering and refreshing. Every time I have been it is busy but the service is still friendly and fast. Great place for middle of the afternoon treat or after dinner desert"}
{"text":"The family stopped here and was really excited to try the offerings. I jumped right in with the Diablito but it was a bit much for me. As described on the menu, it was loaded with tamarind. If you are a novice in their drink specialties and/or don't enjoy a tangy salty profile this might not be the drink to start you off.  Other notes from a novice, the raspado shave ice is not Hawaiian style, it is more a course grind. The Macedonia has mango in the grind and is topped with ice cream while the Obisbo had no mango. Those were very accessible and enjoyable. The shop was clean pleasant and interesting and the service was friendly. We would definitely visit again."}
{"text":"I just moved from California and a friend recommended this place and I went today to try it out. I walk in and the workers had a \"I don't want to be here\" face. I'm assuming my expectations were a bit high, reading previous reviews... I exepected tostilocos... but I got some white washed tostilocos, oh and my horchata (rice milk) is literally cinnamon. Y'all need to try some real tostilocos instead of what they are serving at this place. Aside from that they're expensive... I did see some customers walking out with chamangos that looked decent maybe this place is not known for their tostilocos or horchata, but this is my experience."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places on a hot sunny day. Great customer service along with doing a great job keeping it sanitary!"}
{"text":"pues resulta que pedi una escamocha y al solicitarle a la cajera que no le pusiera cierta fruta ME COBRO un dolar extra, Al preguntarle por que me cobra de mas,  ella simplemente me dijo \" es que la estas pidiendo especial \" Ahora Diganme ustedes que carajo tiene de especial pedir que le quiten algo a mi comida y que por eso me cobren de mas, MUY MAL esos de frutilandia, personalmente le contare a quien pueda esta historia y AGUAS con pedir menos de la porcion por que se lo van a fregar."}
{"text":"Really delicious fresh fruit.  Amazing mix of toppings. Recommend strawberries and creme"}
{"text":"Read the raves on Yelp, was in the area and had to try the Macedonia.   It was a large cup filled with small cubes of mango, 1 strawberry sliced into 4 and placed as garnish, and 1 big scoop of ice cream. The concoction floats in creamy mango and ice. It as very tasty, excellent actually.   The only problem was what is called shaved ice was more like crushed ice. Also it was not cheap at $5.50. I will probably not return since RaspadosRico is closer to my home and a better shop in my opinion."}
{"text":"The fruit was wonderful and perfect refreshment for a night out. The sandia loca was a half a watermelon filled with many different fruit. It's enough to feed about 5 people well."}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place! He said it really reminds him of coming home from school and getting street food snacks along the way. The tostilocos come packed with cucumber, peanuts, cabbage, and we add the pork and rielito. The large is a full meal for 2 people. To finish up we get mangos in the sweet cream sauce. I deducted 1 star because I'm not a fan of reggaeton and sometimes when we go in it's playing so loud you can't hear the person next to you over the music."}
{"text":"We came in to get a Sandia Loca early afternoon, however, were given multiple excuses to deter us from placing the order. Although we agreed to 1) wait 30 min and 2) be served a smaller portion , the cook ultimately refused to make it because she wouldn't have enough ingredients for the rest of day. Overall, disappointing experience due to the poor customer service . Would not recommend the drive ."}
{"text":"Every time im by this place is a must STOP. Love the masedonia. I also love the customer service and how clean the shop is. Anything you choose is amazing."}
{"text":"Frutilandia is the best great tasting desert the best in town I totally recommend !!!!"}
{"text":"What a terrific unique place. This is truly authentic to Latin food and reminds me of a few places in Mexico. The menu has a variety of items and range from ceviche, salads, fruit bowls, ice cream, etc. stopped in to get a popsicle for my daughter and can't wait to go back and try more on the menu. I had to order the Sandia Loca after seeing the picture and am so glad I did. The orders do take 10-15 min to make since its all fresh but that wasn't a problem at all."}
{"text":"I love coming here! Love the delicious snacks! Good place to come relax and spend some time with friends and family!"}
{"text":"First time posting a yelp review. But been here 3 times already. Every time was delicious. Gotta try the following:  Duro c/Cueritos  Horchata/Rice Cinnamon Drink Jamaica/Hibiscus Drink Diablito/Rocky Point Tropical Shaved Ice Drink Sonoran Hot Dog Rancheritos Chips  Yummy"}
{"text":"I love this place! Very fresh, interesting and unique drinks can be found at Frutilandia. Best of all, there all very tasty! I had the cantaloupe and I highly recommended it. While I go for the fruit drinks, they have a virtual smorgasbord of things to snack on and eat including shrimp cocktails, ceviche, ice cream, chips and more. Very unique and worth the stop!"}
{"text":"I finally stopped at this spot.  I had been wanting a Raspado and decided to search for \"raspados\"on  Yelp of course. I was ordered a Masedonia, something similar to a raspado with mango, and strawberries, topped with a scoop of delicious strawberry Icecream  & lechera treat! Oh my... this place is sooo good! Definitely coming back :)"}
{"text":"Friendly service, fresh ingredients. Awesome French fries ! Large portions!  We will be coming back !"}
{"text":"I don't want this to be another 5-star to add to the hype, but this place really is pretty darn good. And cheap!  What we have here is a Mexican ice cream shop with some savory food items. Scoops of ice cream, shaved ice, combos of the two, fruit cups, and of course the lechera (sweetened condensed milk) on top of everything.  I had the obispo, which is a pick your own shaved ice and top it with your choice of ice cream. It's got some fruit in it, and a little lechera. It may not look big, but it's about $5 and probably enough to share. I also tried a little bit of the Macedonia, and it was also pretty darn good. Much prettier, with the sliced strawberries too.  I didn't try the warm food, and it would be tough with the place next door with a bigger menu. Perhaps they're the same, but you can order some basic Mexican quick dishes go go with your ice cream.  It's a nice atmosphere, very clean, and everything has dual English/Spanish translation. Lots of TVs, and plenty of small tables."}
{"text":"Excellent service, delicious shaved iced, and huarache loco. Very clean.  The prices were reasonable. I enjoyed it and will be back again."}
{"text":"This place definitely hit the spot! I felt like I was in mexico :) I would recommend the macedonia raspado with strawberry ice cream."}
{"text":"Este lugar es el mejor lugar para venir a comer un antojito de cualquier cosa que se te ocurra la gente te atiende muy bien y ademas todo esta bueno solo tuve que esperar 5 min para recibir mi orden y siempre son atentos aun cuando cometen errores que ea muy rato que suceda! La verdad recomiendo el lugar no te vas a arrepentir.   Bueno después de regresar por segunda vez esta semana tuve una diferente experiencia esta ves visite con mi esposa y pidió una escamocha y duraron 16 min solo para darnos cuenta que nos querían dar medio vaso pequeño con unos pedazos de fruta que hasta una de las empleadas se estaba riendo de su propio vaso de fruta así que decidimos cambiar la orden por una tostada de ceviche y tuvimos que esperar 10 min después de que nos dijeron que solo tomaba 3 minutos para hacerla espero que la siguiente visita no sea igual. Pero le dare otra oportunidad pronto.  Por tercera visita acabo de ordenar unas fresas con crema y el sabor esta buenísimo espero que la ultima vez que vine allá sido solamente algo que no va a pasar de nuevo acabo de cambiar mi review de 1 a 5 por la experiencia de esta visita."}
{"text":"Over priced drinks, to crowded. They need a better system to take payments . They also a artiste agua de mango and they never have it . Since they started using the machine to make their Mexican waters the pulp from the fruits are missing .. Overpriced and overrated"}
{"text":"Frutilandia is an awesome place when I'm craving seafood, shaved ice or fruit! Ya no tengo que extrañar los antojos mexicanos!!"}
{"text":"On a Sunday night, after 8, finding an ice cream that's open is a bit difficult. So while checking Yelp around the Mesa/Gilbert area, I found Fruitilandia and noticed I had bookmarked it earlier so my husband and I decided to try it especially after I saw some of the pics on Yelp.   We got there at around 8:45pm. The parking was pretty full and so was the store! Most tables were full, there was a line already and it was buzzing, all on a Sunday night!   While standing in line, we were looking at the menu on the board. It's a little hard to see when you're way in the back of the line. When we got to the cashier, and with so many options available, I decided to ask what the pic I was looking at on Yelp was and ordered just that. It was Macedonia. It's basically vanilla ice shavings with pieces of mango and strawberry served with mango juice and condensed milk and topped with ice cream. The drink in the pic looked like it had vanilla ice cream on top but when I asked the cashier, she said, strawberry ice cream also tasted great and so did the strawberry cheesecake ice cream as well so both my husband and I decided to try it with those one of those ice cream options.   When I checked in on Yelp, I realized they had an offer where you would get the 2nd drink 50% off. So the total was a little over $10! Great price for two huge drinks/desserts we were about to have.   The orders came out pretty quick. The taste, my oh my, it was out of this world. Just as the doctor ordered! This drink/fruit/ice cream dream satisfied every bit of craving I had for that night, I was over the moon. No wonder this place was packed!  Fruitalinda does not only offer drinks and fruit salads etc, they also have savory dishes such as a shrimp cocktail too! It's a nice change from your typical ice cream or juice bar; they have many options worth trying. They have limited branches in the valley so far so get ready to drive to get to them."}
{"text":"Great place to go with your family! It's super fresh, fast service, and very taste! I would recommend if you like Mexican snacks"}
{"text":"Went there on Sunday evening and it was so pax with customers.   Ordered Chamoyada that was very delicious.   Must mixed it before you eat otherwise get strange flavour.   It had tamarind favour at the bottom, middle was something quite salty and top of with fresh Mango and tamarind candy.   Once mixed everything together. It so yummy."}
{"text":"I've visited this place many many times.I love the fresas con crema and the Tostitos locos are very good too.Service is wonderful staff is nice and place is very clean and well maintained.Its a little bit pricey than other places but at the end it's well worth it , very authentic Mexican treats."}
{"text":"A great alternative and affordable but music is too loud. Also, I ordered fruta picada and it took them 15 mins to get my order ready. BTW, I was the first order when I arrived."}
{"text":"Wife ordered Macedonia, it was really good. I ordered Tostielotes and they took 20minutes. They use yellow corn instead of white like traditional Hispanic snacks do, so it tasted sweet. Not good."}
{"text":"Only place in AZ that serves these kinda drinks! Ordered the Diablito and the Chamango! Both were delicious! The Chamango could've been blended more into a slushy. Otherwise, it would've been excellent. They serve Thrifty ice cream! They also serve food like tacos, ceviche, etc.  and they have Mexican candy and chips!   If you LIKE their Facebook page, you'll get a free ice cream cone :)"}
{"text":"Yummy, Yummy, Yummy!  This place is great for a tasty treat!   If you don't speak spanish, good luck, I do a lot of pointing! It still works though!  I have noticed that it is sometimes a little inconsistent as far as how well it is made, but still delicious non the less.    My favorites so far are the Champango, and Escamocha when the fruit are actually ripe and not rock hard!"}
{"text":"Always get their fresas con crema and their carne asada fries. So Delicious! Super nice staff and food gets out on good time"}
{"text":"My fav place to get elote and raspados. The girls are always so nice, even when I try ordering in Spanish. There are tons of combinations for flavors so there's always something new!"}
{"text":"This place is never a disappointment! I always order the burger combo and the burger is always very soft and juicy. The fries are also very soft and hot every time. Leaves me quite satisfied and full when I leave."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Nothing better than a cold treat in the summer. My personal favorite is the Macedonia. I love the shaved ice mixed with the ice cream! Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"It is a very busy place but very pricey for the quantity of food gave a little bit of fruit for the price of the platter!!! Would recommend for a close place in the area"}
{"text":"My husband and i went to get two small tostilokos and one grande tostiloko. As we were waiting i noticed they were getting the ice cream for customers that were there. We were like they are trying to get those done first so they can make ours. Once we noticed they handed a customers food. We looked at eachother saying they forgot about us. Let me remind you we have alread been waiting 20 mins. We told they lady we think you guys forgot about our order.  She didnt even say sorry or anything. i wont be coming back here !"}
{"text":"Where on Earth can you get a double scoop waffle cone for only $3.50? You guessed it... Frutilandia. Other favorite included a delicious ceviche tostada for $3.75 and their various aquas naturales for $2.75 or $3.50. This is a fun place to stop.  It's a Mexican dessert shop with a lot of interesting options that you may not ever find if you only go to one style of dessert shop.  My 2-year old, my parents, all my friends and I love it.  Because the prices are good and the quality is nice, we stop there frequently instead of only occasionally.   Frutilandia has brightly painted walls, some games and music going.  It's good for the whole family or maybe even a date that you've been out with a few times already. See ya there!"}
{"text":"The best Macedonia in the world. The elote was amazing. I love all the food here. I wish they had one in Scottsdale so I wouldn't have to drive so far. The best dessert I've ever had"}
{"text":"This place is so good and I've only tried like 3 things so far. I'm determined to try close to everything on their menu at least once. When i do try everything i will post another review with all of my favorites. So far the fresas con crema is my favorite and the Carne fries were pretty tasty. The fries just needed to be fried up a little more so they don't get soggy so fast. Other than that this is one place i wouldn't mind stopping by at least 3-4 times a week for a treat. I also tried the diabilito and loved the tamarind shaved ice it makes a huge difference and if you don't like shaved ice this will change your life."}
{"text":"The best fruit bowls I ever had everything is fresh.and the hAve a good deal on the buy one get one 1/2 off..icome here all The time for ice cream super good"}
{"text":"Very good place they have a great selection of stuff everything's so fresh and tasty I always love coming here it's worth it"}
{"text":"Best Horchata around! A but on the pricey side but worth it! Also the mango raspado is good! We usually stick with these 2 items. Clean and yummy. You really feel like you're in Mexico while at this place."}
{"text":"Wasn't really impressed with this place the fruit was way over priced and the portion of fruit was extremely small"}
{"text":"I love everything about this place! I want to say that I wish they had the actual corn elote and not just the cup. But so good!"}
{"text":"The Fresca con Crema was delicious! Wasn't a big fan of the Diablito, though. It kind of tasted like a mouth full of tapatio and lime. The Macedonia was pretty good. Price was a bit high, though. 5.25 each!"}
{"text":"Strawberries and cream is my favorite! It is the perfect summer treat and I love that they are open late. The strawberries are always fresh and the cream is delicious. My kids have gotten their ice cream and it is also excellent."}
{"text":"Delicious and fresh! Cute shop just wish it was in a better area of town... The location is what will keep me from coming back including the odors you smell in the parking lot."}
{"text":"Macedonia was good but a little sweet for my taste. But will totally get it again! The chamango was alright not the best. The place has a lot of selection, I will mostly stop by when I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"First time I came here to try the drinks and I ordered a chamango and it tasted like chlorine. Yes I am being 100% fr I told them to make another and it ended tasting like Clorox again! I also heard other customers completing that it smelled and tasted like chlorine. I'm disgusted that this restaurant tried to poison the customers with chlorine! I recommend that you all do not come here!!"}
{"text":"Man o man! Fresas con crema! Can't wait to go back to try the many other flavors and treats on their menu. Super clean and bright decor! This is an awesome spot for raspados!"}
{"text":"A friend of mine absolutely loves this place and convinced me to go with her. She said her favorite item is the Macedonia.  She said everything is good and recommended what we will have on our next visit. The Macedonia was very good - sweet and fruity. When I was little my great grandmother used to make me what she called a barnyard soda - which is a Pepsi float with vanilla ice cream. This reminded me of that, but all fruit instead of soda. I had the strawberry ice cream scoop, she had vanilla. The drink was a mixture of mango, strawberry, pineapple and came with a spoon and a straw.   When we arrived there were three ladies at a table, but after we arrived the place was busy. Several people stayed, but others picked up and took out. It was constantly busy during our stay. Each Macedonia was $4.95 and well worth it. It was large and I wasn't sure I could = but I carried on and we each finished ours.   I felt very comfortable there and we stayed talking and enjoying our drink for over 2 hours. I will definitely come back and try more of the drinks since this is just two streets down from my apartment."}
{"text":"$13 for a small tostiloco and a 32 ounce horchata?! This has to be the best food I've ever eaten for me to come back.."}
{"text":"Best Fresas con cremas in town.. definitely the only spot to get fresh fruits..good food and perfect customer service"}
{"text":"This is the best place for any type of craving for sweets. They have the best corn I have ever true in my whole life. They need to open one in Scottsdale, it would be amazing if they did that."}
{"text":"Check in and you get the 2nd item 50% off. So bring a plus 1!!  This place never disappoints! I went here a couple nights ago and I got the macedonia with vanilla ice cream. The ice cream is so creamy! Pretty sure it's thirftys but I'm not entirely sure. It's similar. The Macedonia contained a mix of crushed ice, mangos, and strawberries. around $5.   However, my favorite menu item is the sandia loca!! I wish I had a picture! It's huge though! It's a huge watermelon that has other fruits in it and has a plethora of chamoy and tajin. I love that the fruit is covered in chamoy and has yummy Tamarind candy, peanuts, oranges, limes, and mangos in the sandia. My only complaint is that it takes awhile for them to prepared, but totally understandable.  People that have given this place less 3 stars- I highly advise you to give it another chance.  Staff is so friendly!"}
{"text":"First timer! All the way from San Jose, California. The fresas con crema were amazing as well as the fruta picada. DEFINITELY going to come back! Excellent service and the place is super clean!"}
{"text":"This place is the perfect place to satisfy my cravingsss! I love the Diablito and maybe even just some chopped fruit! It's a little pricey for my liking but what can I say the quality and service is great!"}
{"text":"Always have friendly staff and the are quick to make your order and open on the weekends"}
{"text":"Always get the Macedonia/Mazatlan has mangos and strawberries with vanilla or strawberry ice cream so yummy!!! Love this place"}
{"text":"Had the carne Asada fries, ceviche tostado, and ceviche in a Doritos bag. Everything was delicious and reasonably priced. We had a strawberry shake that was just ok and a strawberry ice cream concoction that was amazing. The ice cream is awesome!"}
{"text":"We just recently tried this place out. The staff was super friendly and helpful since it was our first time. The strawberries and cream was super good and my husband got the vanilla shaved ice with mangos, strawberries and ice cream. He loved it and I thought t was a lot better then mine! I do however think it's a little over priced but i would defiantly return!"}
{"text":"Best place to go if you're missing some authentic Mexican snacks! You can never go wrong with their fresas con crema!"}
{"text":"Pretty good selection of items, including food. Went in to get something cold since it was 108 degrees outside. I got the Mazatlan (it has a second name too), it was a vanilla raspado, topped with strawberry cheesecake ice cream (my choice), frozen strawberries and mango. It was a nice size for a little over $7. It was good and refreshing. Will definitely going again and something. So much too choose from."}
{"text":"Love this place, always come for some cacahuates con pepino, and OMG there so delicious. Keep up the good customer service."}
{"text":"This place always hits the spot, tropical fun drinks, elite, thrifty's ice cream, hot Cheetos with nacho cheese, asada fries. Nice, clean, updated. Great helpful staff."}
{"text":"Frutilandia is my FAVORITE place to go grab a snack or something to eat ...I honestly I can't have enough of their \"Carne Asada Fries\" they're my absolute favorite meal to eat , even tho i love everything they serve l recommend my friends and family members to try this amazing place! And for sure they wont be disappointed. Terrific customer service they have in amazing team that treats you like family. Can't wait come back to my fantasy world lol and enjoy something delicious :)"}
{"text":"Was a whole year ago when I tried this place but will return again to give it another shot as I remembered being intrigued by the selection.   Got the shrimp ceviche tostado and Macedonia. Ceviche awesome. Macedonia huge but I remembered there being too much of the syrup and condensed milk for my liking. It made it too artificial tasting and I couldnt really taste the natural flavors of the other things. Next time I'm gonna ask to keep it simple - fruit, ice cream, ice and light condensed milk."}
{"text":"Love the raspados with vanilla ice cream and lechera it is soooo good! I've tried at least half the menu and everything I've had was delicious and authentic to the snacks and treats you can get in Mexico. I love coming here with my kids! the staff is always helpful!"}

{"text":"Try the Diablito!  Great menu selection.  They have all the best mexican treats like duritos con chile y limon, shrimp cocktails, strawberries and cream, etc.  The prices are reasonable and service is timely."}
{"text":"Took the kids there service poor. Ask for nachos with cheese and jalapeños to go. Got home and they stole the jalapeños and my daughter orther tostilocos and they forgot the chamoy and salsa"}
