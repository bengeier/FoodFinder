{"text":"Loved it. We've been meaning to stop in for a bit because it's a new restaurant in our area, and we were not disappointed. The corn chips and salsa before our meal were addictive enough that we're planning to come back for nachos (fresh, warm corn chips and fresh, spicy salsa). My husband said the Paella is the best that he's had since he was in Spain.   The restaurant itself is bright and open, and the staff is helpful and attentive. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I went here for lunch on a Sunday. I thought it was strange for a Spanish restaurant that the vegetarian options were very limited. Usually I have a lot of options for bean and vegetable dishes. I mentioned this to the server and she kindly recommended a stuffed pepper with rice that was on the menu (I forget the Spanish name for it). Unfortunately the food didn't really look like any of the pictures I'm seeing on here. Presentation was poor and my plate was covered in cheese and a moat of grease. The food was OK but I was really put off by just how much grease and cheese there was and it gave me heartburn afterward (not from the spice because there was none). Honestly I feel like for the location and food quality their price point is WAY too high. It cost $90 for lunch for two with small starters and one drink each. The TVs were on playing sports the whole time so there was no music and it just sort of lacked atmosphere. If I'm going to spend $100 on lunch I don't want to listen to sports commentary. Pick one or the other. I might like to give this place another shot during dinner when there is a band playing."}
{"text":"Service was great.  Very bright and clean inside.  Nicely renovated.food was great.   Salad dressing was yummy.  All items on dinner menu are gluten free.  Great new place for SW Calgary. A must try"}
{"text":"Came in for lunch with my wife today. We were the only ones inside the restaurant but but the roads were really bad today so I can't  hold that against them for it being dead.   The menu is a bit strange, it a Mexican, Brazilian, Italian mix. We found the dishes we ordered to be quite greasy and oily and lacking a bit of flavor.  3 Stars"}
{"text":"Great Latin music, huge room, 4 tvs, food is excellent though the lunch menu dumbed down to Canadian foods, burgers. Etc  You can still get pozole!!!!  Live music in evenings some nights  Great service and you can practise your Spanish"}
{"text":"I don't speak Spanish very well. However, I love Latin music. It's so upbeat and incredible to turn the frown upside down. I appreciate it no matter how few words I understand.   I would give it 3 stars, but the owner was awesome enough to go out of his way to make room for myself and girlie. Hands-on owner +43 stars. He was dancing and having a great time when the band started playing. +84 stars. I learned a bit of Latin dancing. Apparently the guys don't do much in many types of dances. I still maintain that I rocked the joint with my amazing dancing.  Nelson and the band were awesome and had me making an ass out of myself doing the white boy dance.   The food was excellent. Chirizo and queso in one dish? OH YEAH! I love me some spicy chirizo tastiness.   It's there. It's loud. It's amazing for dancing and fun."}
{"text":"Great place since the upgrades. Been there a few times for the live music... Fantastic night for the locals!"}
{"text":"Need to work out the bugs... Like getting food to customers within 90 minutes of ordering (arrived at 5:30, just got our appetizer at 7:20). And stopping the music /tv from pausing every 10 minutes (and yet another awkward quietness as we wait for our food). In all fairness, our waitress seems a bit sketchy, first sign of trouble missing a club soda order for our three year old, but then remembering it out of the blue 20 minutes later. Then after waiting 40 minutes she comes back to tell us she effed up the system entry and so no food for antoher 30 minutes. It sucks. We had chicken empanadas which were presented well, they were okay, i thought for a moment of frozen pizza pockets. Still waiting for the main. If you come on a night when they have live music may help distract you from the excruciating wait for food. It smells good (the stuff delivered to other tables). The interior reminds me of small eateries we'd seen in Costa Rica, somewhat plain and unimportant, leaving the food to impress than the decorating, so a star for authenticity. Of course if i was going to make customers wait for hours to eat I would at least give them a remarkable waiting room. Oh my three year old just spilled his drink out of boredom, tv must be frozen again... Yes it is. The waitress is definitely the process breakdown here. If you come and your drink orders are taken by a middle aged caucasian woman with a smoker's rasp, just leave or move your seat to another section. Oh she's just come by to tell us she ordered us the pozole for our son, about 20 minutes after we asked about it, an hour after she explained no soup of the day for our son, occurring to us pozole might be a good stand in for soup and we better get him some food fast, makes me think she doesn't know the menu. We didn't order it, we asked about it. Specifically, how long would it take, and no we don't want the yam fries. WTF. Just as well, my son looks a bit pale from low blood sugar. Thanks Ms. Ditz we're so glad for your gift of remarkable prescience to order us food we didn't even know we wanted. Great, we've just hit our son's bedtime. \"Mommy I want some more food!\", as our waitress comes by to tell us 15 more minutes. I kiss my son for his magical timing. What an excellent day to quit smoking. Oh sh*t the Nascar race just ended, my son's become a time bomb without that distraction. Wait a sec, wasn't that race just starting when we arrived? What is that like 200 laps worth of waiting for our food?!?! I don't even like Nascar!!!! So hungry. Pozole's arrived! Not bad. A little bland, may need some more salt, it's got a small kick to it. Small. Would let you know how the main was but my battery is dying. Arrived with a full charge. Wish us luck. Oh wait. I can't believe this, just overheard her name. The same name we had decided for our unborn daughter. Wow. Back to the baby name blogs... Why didn't we just go to moxies?!   Back home and recharged, the main arrived at 8:25, it was the Venezuelan dish. It was tasty! Was not a big a portion as I thought, (from the waitress: 'oh, i thought the plate was bigger'). So a lot of the menu items contain slow cooked stewy meats and the attention and patience in cooking that stuff pays off... If you're preparing it for yourself at home and not simply sitting and waiting for hours for the server and kitchen to get their act together. Silver lining: while waiting you can distract your growling stomach by writing many online reviews. Big fail. Good luck."}
{"text":"The ambience here is super cool!! I think this is probably the best latin bar in Calgary!!. They have live music and the appetizers are great!!. Is a really fun place to go and have a great time with friends!!.. The cocktails are very good too!!.. I had the mojito and I really liked it... I'm counting the days to go back and have a fun time again!!"}
{"text":"Came here to try out the food based on a good friend's recommendation.  We got to sample quite a number of dishes as seen by my pics.  I loved the seafood Paella with the lobster. It was full of flavour and the lobster was done perfectly.  The prices are a little higher than in Toronto but is pretty much the same for all our dining experiences in Calgary.  Will definitely dine here when I come back to Calgary!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have wanted to try this place for quite a while. The first time we planned to go was September 1st, and unfortunately when we got to the restaurant (no reservation made), there was a sign on the door that it was closed for the long weekend. Very disappointing. We finally got back there a couple of months later. The place is quite large and open with nice decor and clean. The staff were very casual and friendly and there was great music playing at an appropriate level to still allow conversation. We arrived fairly early for a week day supper, just before 5pm, and there were only three other customers - all at the bar, which appeared well stocked. When we left at about 6:30 there was only one other table with customers, although they did have some people come for takeout while we were there.   They unfortunately did not have our appetizer of choice that day, but the lobster appetizer we did order was delicious. A bit on the small side with just a couple of bites each for $17 seemed a little pricey though. Our entrees were delicious with good sized portions and lovely presentation. The meat was tender and full of flavour. My husband ordered the Brazillian gaucho and when it came out on a large spit we were underwhelmed as the size of the spit made the serving size appear small. But it wasn't; my husband couldn't even finish his entree. I ordered the Lomo de Cerdo (pan roasted pork loin) and managed to finish every bit from my plate.   We had our infant daughter with us and they did have a clean highchair for her. The server was very friendly and we chatted briefly (just the right amount to be friendly without intruding on our night out) about what we had in common as she had an infant as well. Overall we came away having enjoyed our meal but found it overall a little expensive for what it was, likely due to the cost of the appetizer. We would go back and try it again as I'd love to see what the live music is like. I hope this place fills up more as it's a great addition to the area and I hope to get a chance to try it again."}
