{"text":"This was the cutest little diner I have ever been too . The waitress was the nicest lady ever . The food was insanely cheap but still amazing. I loved everything about it !!"}
{"text":"A cozy \"mom and pop\" cafe that is even open on the weekends............downtown (truly a diamond in the rough!)  Fresh ingredients and great home cooking at a reasonable price. Can't beat it!"}
{"text":"Living downtown and so close to the Colonial Arade I'm not sure why I never explored the arcade sooner, but there are some hidden gems inside including this small diner. 

This place is perfect for a quick breakfast - my standard is the No. 2 - 2 eggs, home fries, toast, bacon and coffee for 4.50! It's your typical hole-in-the-wall diner experience complete with bar stools. The food is tasty (ie. a little greasy but hey it's a diner) and it's cheap (supercheap by downtown standards). They open early (6 am weekdays which is key for me because I start work early AND they open Saturday which is rare for downtown sadly). Notably, minimum credit card charge is $6. Extra points for being literally next door to where I live!"}
{"text":"The best breakfast you can ever get.

The place is small and friendly, all of most it's very quiet. When you go there for breakfast you will feel so relaxed.

I haven't tried their lunch but I think it will be as great.

The best breakfast is the oumlet eggs with cheese and aside a sausage."}
{"text":"I didn't even want to give one star. I Visited PJs Luncheonette for breakfast and was acknowledged by the waitress to have a seat and so we did. Shortly after, an African American couple walked in and sat close to us. While waiting anxiously for service, our table was skipped by the waitress as she headed on over to the African American couple. She clearly walked past me and my fianc√©e twice. I think that is racism considering we are white."}
{"text":"As an out-of-town-er, PJ's was slightly difficult to find on an early Saturday morning when all of the other shops around it were closed. But once we located it, we were glad we did.

We had a seat at the counter, and were told that there would be a long wait until we would get our food. Not in a rush, we watched everyone's breakfast being made, which was a real treat. I had an excellent breakfast sandwich and my boyfriend had a huge plate of traditional fare.  The staff was super sweet and refilled our coffees at least 4 times.

My only complaint was that they took to-go orders as they came in, without adding them to the back of the pile, and people came and left while we were still waiting for our food.

If we ever are back in Cleveland for another wedding, we will be sure to stop by."}
{"text":"Nice little breakfast place inside a beautiful and bright but almost completely deserted building. The woman who served us was very friendly, but it took a while for food and coffee to come out. Neither the food nor the coffee was particularly good, but it's more of a neighborhood greasy spoon than a gourmet place. Go there if you're staying in the city, and don't want to subject yourself to Dunkin Donuts or Subway's new \"breakfast\" menu."}
{"text":"We stopped here for breakfast after just arriving in Cleveland.  Friendly and quick service, EXCELLENT prices, and delicious home-cooked food.  Both the atmosphere and prices seem unchanged over the last 30 years.  No complaints here!"}
{"text":"Ok fancy no but comfort food yes. If you miss your mom or time when things were easier this is the place.  I mean you can get a bologna sandwich and jello with whip cream. What says nostalgia more than that. Great prices and good food. The waitress was the sweetest lady ever!"}
{"text":"Only place open in downtown Cleveland for breakfast on a Saturday morning... so not many options.  I'm sure the food is fine... can't screw up eggs too badly... if you could actually get them served to customers!  The place is half empty, and my wife and I have been waiting for over 45 minutes for breakfast wraps... really!?!?  Only one guy working the grill, doing one order at a time... no multitasking.  There are two waitresses doing basically nothing, because the guys puts up an order every 10 minutes.  Ditch one of the servers and get a second short order cook who can crank out the order guys.... will not be coming back here... would rather get in my car and drive out of downtown to get breakfast next time I'm here!!!!  Steer clear unless you have a couple of hours to kill waiting for breakfast."}
{"text":"Sent to PJ's by the hotel concierge because they were the only place in the area still serving breakfast at noon on Saturday.  We were very disappointed in the recommendation.  although a very small place, the two-waitress staff was overwhelmed.  Our waitress told us to expect a 20 minute wait for breakfast.  45 minutes later, the food started to appear in waves.  The food was prepared generically, not to specific requests (Hard scramble, well done hash browns).  The bacon was shriveled to nothing.  The toast was thin with just a dab of butter.  Nothing here to remember except a long wait for sub-par food."}
{"text":"This place is dirty and the service is slow. The only plus is that it's cheap,  but you're getting what you pay for."}
{"text":"Great hangover breakfast!  This is the only place I know that is open for breakfast in downtown.  It's cheap, easy and the service is great.  It kinda reminds of the \"mom/pop\" places, where they get to know your name.  I was immediately asked, you guys are new here, how did you find out about this place.  Thanks to Yelp, it let me here.  Its right next door to my apt building so I will be back for easy quick breakfast on Saturday mornings :)"}
{"text":"The food is pretty good and reasonably priced for downtown Cleveland. Its quick if you forgot your lunch or need a little something to hold you over. The only thing I can say that is annoying is the extra 25 cents for everything. A tomato is 25 cents, some lettuce is 25 cents, onion, sugar in your oatmeal, it all gets rather tedious. The employees are friendly and will learn your name after going there just a few times. Nice little place to grab a quick bite or carry out a sandwich. If you use your credit card I am pretty sure you have to spend over $6.00. I would call and check before placing an order."}
{"text":"Came here because I'm staying in the Residence Inn next door and their breakfast is only until 9am. I'm working til midnight each night so being up that early is hard. So after waking up at 945 and wanting breakfast.... I headed over to PJ's. And I'm glad I did! There was one server helping everyone but she was NAILING it! Seriously the best pancakes I've ever had. Fluffy and a little crispy around the edge which I loved. Sweet buttery taste. I don't want to know how many calories. I don't care. They were great! I had scrambled eggs too and they were perfect. If you're looking for a good breakfast and quick and easy atmosphere come here. They are great!"}
{"text":"Not bad at all for a cheap breakfast, good portions and great prices!  They accept credit cards on transactions over $6 (kinda hard to do alone being so cheap! lol).  Nice little place in the gateway district nestled inside one of the arcades."}
{"text":"Cheap, fast, good, no-frills breakfast and lunchspot in the snazzy arcade -- and the wait staff was SO NICE. We were fortunate to have discovered it on our recent trip through Cleveland."}
{"text":"PJs is that good, old-fashioned diner from yesteryear.  You know, the kind that makes everything from SCRATCH.  It is a deliciious meal with the friendliest people anywhere.

THE PLACE in downtown Cleveland for lunch if you ask me!"}
{"text":"It's a small lil hole on the wall. he's been here for 35 years in this very same location. Love it. My kids liked it as well.  Two adults and two kids ate breakfast for less than $20. Can't beat that!"}
{"text":"I've worked downtown for almost 20 years and have seen the Colonial Arcade go thru many changes. I've walked past this restaurant more times than I can count and just never stopped in.  Earlier this week, the weather was nice and I was looking to get away from office, not looking for anything fancy for lunch just a simple salad or sandwich.  I immediately thought of this place based on having read a Yelp review.  I stopped in just prior to noon. The place was clean/tidy and the staff was very friendly. There were a few patrons that I could tell were regulars based on their conversations with the staff.   I was immediately seated and greeted by the waitress.  I decided to order the chicken salad platter.   The platter arrived shortly thereafter, nothing fancy, but everything was fresh.  A nice scoop of homemade white meat chicken salad, on top of iceberg lettuce leaves, surrounded by 3 tomato slices, a sliced hardboiled egg and a few dill pickle slices.  I also requested saltine crackers to accompany the meal.  All-in-all this was an OK meal, not extraordinary, but fit the bill based on what I had a taste for that day.  My total with tax , was just under $6, therefore this was definitely a deal.   I'll return to try some of the other menu items."}
{"text":"Good food, good people, keeping breakfast simple like it should be. Delicious coffee, too!"}
{"text":"How this place has not joined all the other out-of-business places in this arcade amazes me. I recently went as I wanted plain diner food and all the other choices range from Cambodian to Hungarian. 

Not much is more diner than a hot roast beef sandwich with mashed potatoes and gravy. The roast beef had an unpleasant taste and odor along with rainbows that I have had before from cheap processed meat. The mushy peas were canned and easily the worst I ever tasted. The potatoes and gravy were fine. 

I think the room's old-fashioned charm has a halo effect for the positive reviews. Perhaps it does make a mean breakfast. I will never know as one visit was one too many. And the woman who sits at the register is always glaring out the window. Very eerie."}
{"text":"Hold the phone, kids - these folks have bacon! And it's gooood bacon!!! I love this little gem in the 5th street Arcade. I've never had better pancakes and the service and energy in the place is so warm and inviting. Delicious, affordable comfort food for when you want to eat out downtown but don't feel like dealing with high prices, stuffy ambiance or attitudes. My boyfriend loves coming here!"}
{"text":"cute small luncheonette. came in for breakfast. $2 order of pancakes was great - only issue i had was they must cook it on the same griddle as omelettes or something because there were chives in my pancake. located inside the 5th st arcade."}
{"text":"Great little mom and pop luncheonette. The menu looks sparse but the staff assured me that they could make just about anything I could want. And boy did they deliver. 

Friendly staff, delicious coffee, and if you sit at the bar you can see how freshly made everything is."}
{"text":"Awful. Will never eat there again... Nothing is fresh... Applesauce from a jar, the burger I had came out of a metal tin sitting on the flat top grill and it was dripping wet... gross. Sitting at the counter is a scary experience... I witnessed raw bacon sitting on a dirty rag.... Enough said."}
{"text":"Staff was so friendly that I didn't care that they made my eggs sunny side up instead off over easy. Best way to described the food is \"awesome home cooking\". Cheap eats."}
{"text":"Tasty coffee, excellent food! The service is great and prices are unbeatable. A must go!"}
{"text":"Simple menu and cheap!  Looking for healthy or fancy, you better pass. Had the breakfast wrap & coffee. Coffee service could be better."}
{"text":"PJ's...a classic diner done well! 

Thank God for the Yelp app, or I'd have probably starved to death on the streets of Cleveland. I bolted from my airport taxi and into the loving arms of PJ, complete with formica tables, old-time-polite staff (I like it when people call me \"sweetie,\" ok? Ok), excellent coffee in classic brown mugs and a mixed crowd to boot. 

A group of dudes getting ready for work (one sporting an Indians cap, for good measure and to complete my experience, I'm sure), a family of 4 with an animated father, some businessmen powering up for a healthy Tuesday...methinks anyone is welcome. And if you happen to be dining alone, pull up a stool to the kitchen bar...perfect for solo diners!

$7.56 for...
*Veggie omelette with criss-crossed American cheese
*Side of sausage (3)
*Piping hot diner coffee (bottomless)

Tucked inside an architecturally interesting building with many odd shops...this is a diner diamond, get you some eggs, STAT!

*Cash only."}
{"text":"This place was great because it has the least expensive breakfast meal I've ever paid for.  I was staying at a nearby hotel and wanted something to eat that wasn't the overpriced breakfast the hotel was offering.  This was very close and I was $3 and change for two pancakes and eggs with orange juice.    Note that you won't be getting some foodie experience here, or fancy brunch type atmosphere.  Its very basic but that's whats awesome about it."}
{"text":"If you're looking for breakfast worse than what could be prepared at home then look no further. I'm only writing this review because I came here based off of WONDERFUL reviews posted on sites like yelp and trip advisor. Good lord.. What a waste of my time. I'm a bit of a foodie.. So perhaps this could be a factor in why I hated this place.. But come on... How can you mess up breakfast?? 
To make matters worse.. I coaxed my friend into coming here because I thought it would be good. We hadn't seen each other in years and we had to start off with this unfortunate experience. 

The eggs were slimey.. The sausage reminded me of microwaveable links my parents used to buy when we didn't have much money (gold n brown??).. And the grits were above and beyond bland... I don't even think they sprinkled salt in there. Not a pinch.. I swear. 

My friends meal wasn't any better. She didn't finish.

Honestly haven't had a breakfast this bad ever.. And I troll through all of the downtown cleveland mom and pop shops that serve it. 

This is based off of a one time experience.. Could have been a fluke.. But needless to say I'm not really interested in finding out if it was.

Oh and two stars because the pancakes were actually edible and halfway decent."}
{"text":"After hearing about Denny's attempt to persuade people to ingest the culinary abomination they call the \"Grand Slam\" by giving them away, I realized that I don't want to eat bad food, ever, even if it is free.  This is not to say that I will only eat crepes suzette prepared by a Cordon Bleu chef.   Far from it.  I appreciate a beautifully executed burger as well as a perfectly seared foie gras.

So I headed to PJ's Luncheonette for a real, delicious diner breakfast.  $4.50 gets you: two increadibly fresh eggs, prepared right in front of you, any way you like; three strips of crispy bacon, pressed flat to ensure maximum crispitudiousness; hashbrowns with carmelized edges, without a hint of greasiness; two slices of toast ;and great, hot, fresh coffee.

PJ's is fabulous.  It's the kind of place where your Gramps used to take you for a patty melt.  And yes, they still serve them!   It is scrupulously clean.  The waitresses are old school awesome.  They still call you \"honey\".  The food is just as good as when Gramps went there-- fresh, simple, inexpensive Americana.

Denny's could never come close."}
{"text":"Love P.J.'s! I have been eating lunch at least a couple times a month at this charming diner for the past nine years. It is such a sweet place with really special people taking care of you there. Our waitress, Darlene is great! Even when she is super busy, she will make it a point to stop by our table to catch up for a minute. 

The prices are beyond reasonable, especially for downtown. I love getting grilled cheese and tomato soup. But, hands down, the best thing they serve is the Friday mac and cheese. I have never found mac and cheese anywhere that comes close.  First of all, the cheese is flourescent orange, and the burned pieces from the sides of the pan, if you are lucky enough to get a little, cooks into a sort of cheese jerky that is actually delicious!

The only thing I would avoid is the \"Diet Plate\", which is cottage cheese with unset Jello scooped on top  - I made that mistake once, but never again!"}
{"text":"Comfort food at its best. Located in the Colonial Arcade it looks like vintage 1950's Americana. Formica table tops and a kitchen that consists of a grill and a fryer. The atmosphere fits you like a familiar old coat. The service is exceptional and the food. Roast Beef, Liver and Onions, Meatloaf, and Breaded Pork Chops are all done to perfection. Mashed potatoes like my mother made with the best brown gravy ever. Apple pie for dessert. Try it once and you will be back weekly. It's just that good."}
{"text":"It's disappointing that this place didn't come up at the top of the Yelp search when I was practically standing right next to it!!!  I asked a hotel front desk employee where to go for a good breakfast and was told that I had to try this place.

Wow!  Good old fashioned American greasy spoon.  Awesome food, great service, remarkable prices.  Looks like a dive.  Don't be fooled.

It is inside the Colonial Arcade on Euclid Avenue and is a MUST TRY!"}
