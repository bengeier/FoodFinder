{"text":"Order food through their site and got a confirmation email. After 90 minutes I called and they tell me they are closed."}
{"text":"This place used to be a purely fish and chips and it'snow developed a confused identity as an italian restaurant although they still serve fish and have a few italian dishes. Go figure. The fish and shrimp were so much better when it was only a fish and chips place that for me it was the \"it\" place for fish and chips. Now they seem to be straight out of a box and into the deep fryer. You're better off going to the market and buying some fish sticks. On top of everything, a teenage cashier got upset because I changed my order and actually sighed and rolled his eyes at me. The place itself is depressing and the only sign of life is a t.v. hung on the wall with the volume turned loud. Sad to say this, but Italian Spoon is officially on my \"never again list\"."}
{"text":"This place right here is amaze balls. Since I moved to Phoenix I have been ordering from here. The delivery people are quick and friendly. Plus when we order multiple orders from work, they have no problems with it and are still fast. Not to mention when I asked if you could put cheese on the fries they were able to do it, it's so good. The burgers got bigger and they now have an option to choose how you want it cooked! Highly recommend. Great munchies food."}
{"text":"Their ravioli w/ meat sauce is incredible, as are their fish and chips. I recommend the English style batter for the fish and selecting cod. Their fry seasoning is delectable as well.
A word of caution, if you don't see a sauce listed on your pasta, you need to make sure you tell them to add sauce in the comments section of the item when ordering online.
Speaking of online ordering, it's always smooth. They have a big delivery area, and I believe we're on the border of it. Deliveries take ~60 minutes, and the food never needs reheating.

1/8/17 update: Their standards have held over the last year, and we've never had an issue. The delivery people are always friendly, and the food is always fresh. Their cheese sticks have now become a frequent purchase. They aren't fancy, but they're always hot, crunchy and delicious. The same can be said about their shrimp. In addition the shrimp are around medium sized. I was happily surprised with that you get for the money, although I shouldn't have been. They've always done a great job, and after ordering nearly weekly for a year, I can still enthusiastically recommend them."}
{"text":"Ordered off of grubhub and it came right when it was suppose to. Didn't really know what to expect when ordering do to me never eating here before, but it was delicious. The burger was smaller which i like cause i didn't order a big burger for a reason. The ceaser salad with grilled chicken was my favorite and it was perfect. Also the side of mushrooms seriously are the best ones I've ever tasted they literally fall apart in your mouth. If ur a mushroom lover then you have got to try there's there GREAT! All around I'm a satisfied customer and will be ordering from here again :)"}
{"text":"Really good food....zucchini was fabulous as well as the mozzarella sticks and burgers!! Definitely ordering again!"}
{"text":"Ordered the Beef Ravioli, chocolate mousse and strawberry cheesecake for me and the hubby (delivered via Grubhub). Arrived within an hour. The dish arrived hot and bubbly and full of flavor. The dessert was fabulous! Very happy with food and the price was great, too!"}
{"text":"I ordered from Italian Spoon online through GrubHub.  The price was a little much, particularly given what I received, but the food wasn't bad.

My partner and I both ordered ravioli....  Each of the ravioli was about the size of the palm of my hand.  We were served maybe 6 or 7 each, in a red marinara sauce slathered with melted cheese.  It would have been better if I had garlic bread, but I was unable to locate an option to order it online.

We also had salad....  It was a typical salad - lettuce, tomato, cucumber.  All in all, pretty good.  Except for whatever odd herbs were tossed atop it to give it a funky aftertaste.  That, I could have done without.

If you're in a rush, too lazy to cook... whatever the case may be, Italian Spoon will do in a pinch."}
{"text":"First time order delivery, fish and chips, onion rings, were great, Sweet Potato pie had me craving for seconds. will order again ! yum Delivery was on time   :)"}
{"text":"Literally the worst restaurant I've been to since living in Phoenix. My wife I had still talk about how bad it was despite having gone there quite awhile ago. Our server was about 12 years old and began playing PS3 on the TV in the dinner area while we were eating. A portly older woman kept coming out of the kitchen with a wet white t-shirt, so that was impressive. Also, people kept coming into the establishment, but they never bought or picked up any food. Portion size were small and overpriced, and the quality was average at best. On a bright note, we still laugh about how terrible our experience was."}
{"text":"We ordered food for delivery through GrubHub and everything was going smoothly. We got a call when the delivery guy got to our apartments, he couldn't find the place so my wife went outside to find him. Upon finding him she proceeded to hand her the food over the fence because the gate was locked, this would have been ok but he began by just handing her the big bag and 2 drinks all at once. Once again, this would have been ok but he wasn't polite and didn't seem to care that she was in process of dropping a drink while he forced the bag into her face. We let that go, went inside to enjoy our meal. Immediately we saw that the ranch dressing for the fried zucchini wasn't in the bag. The item specifically stated it came with ranch, who can eat them without ranch anyways? Now I try not to keep ranch in the house because it's so unhealthy, so we quickly called the restaurant(trying to have them catch him before he was out of the neighborhood) and they said they would contact him. We received a call back saying that the drive \"can't make it\" back. The man on the phone then proceeded to say that he would call him again to see if he can do it on another delivery. He called us again to say that driver would NOT return because it is too far    -_- If you google maps it from my home to the restaurant, it takes 5 minutes... FIVE minutes! Are you kidding me? Too far? I gave you a 5 dollar tip and you can't stop and drop off some ranch? Seriously? Terrible customer service. They asked if they could \"hook us up\" next time. And to that I say WHAT NEXT TIME? I chose delivery for a reason, I cannot just go out pick up some ranch seeing as I don't have a car. This completely ruined our meal plans as we had to sit and play phone tag, hoping the delivery guy would be bring us what we should have been brought. We asked for a refund and they still wanted to \"hook us up\", we insisted on a refund. In the end we had to get it from GrubHub but we got it. We asked for a manger and were told he would be in later. We left a message for him to call us back and we still have not got a return message. For future diners, if you're getting delivery, I'd tip in cash so you know what kind of service you're actually paying for. That jerk didn't deserve my tip if I'm not worth his time. It's unfortunate because I REALLY enjoyed the food, we both got the shrimp & chips and they were delicious. They won't be retaining many customers with that level of service."}
{"text":"We tried a number of dishes and found everyone prepared beautifully. We were very thankful for the delivery service. We look forward to being at the restaurant to experience the ambiance. Two thumbs up, thank you."}
{"text":"For the money we love the food. Prices are very fair and this was a good find for us on the days we do not want to cook.
My wife who is from the South loves the Catfish sandwich!
Bottom line is you cannot beat the food for the price you pay!"}
{"text":"Read the reviews on line and decided to give this place a try.  The store is located in a small strip mall.  Nothing fancy.  It appears to be a family run business.  When we walked in at 6:99 PM there was only one person eating and he was leaving.  We almost turned around and left.  Fortunately, we were hungry so we stayed.  Great decision.  My wife had fish and shrimp with fries and a salad.  I had the raviolis and a salad.  Everything was great.  The fish and shrimp were tasty and moist.  The cocktail sauce and tarter sauce did not appear to be store bought.  They were great.  The salad was fresh.  The raviolis came to five on a plate.  They are home made as is the sauce.  Some of the best I have ever had.  I was afraid that I would be hungry when I finished as I am a big eater.  I was stuffed when I was done.  We are definitely going back.  If this place ever gets \"discovered\" you are not going to be able to get in the door.  In summary, not much atmosphere, but great food, great service, fair prices and friendly people.  Give it a try."}
{"text":"Discovered this place on yelp and decided to give it a shot. SUPER IMPRESSED! Salad was super fresh and full of veggies, baked ziti was delicious and so was the chicken parmigiana and the meatball sub. Great flavors and extra touches like the fresh baked bread on the sub. Even the mozzarella sticks and poppers were still hot and crispy. We're happy to have another great option for delivery and look forward to ordering again soon. Thanks Italian Spoon!"}
{"text":"We stopped by here Sunday evening and were the only folks there.  Simple clean place in a small strip center with about 7 tables inside.  We were able to get our food ordered quickly and split a Caprese Salad while waiting for our order for fish, shrimp and chips.  The food arrived promptly and was very good.  Breading was crunchy  and the cod was tasty. Next time in I will be sure to try some of their Italian food!"}
{"text":"They have 3 kinds of fish for the fish and chips. It's nice to have that option to choose. Their batter is a bit salty but tasty. I have not had the rest of their menu that they offer but I have been there twice for for their dish and chips. One thing would be nice if they would offer thin french fries as opposed to large wide ones. Just a suggestion for those who don't like the wide fries. Also more smiles to welcome the customers, I am a smile sucker and it makes a huge difference in the whole experience. 
I would not hesitate to go there again."}
{"text":"Orders delivery about an hour ago, AMAZING FOOD. my manager said \"Top notch food, very good quality\" we will very likely be ordering from here again. The frie seasoning was so delicious, the burgers were so juicy and cheesy it was just so good. Five stars, deliver was quick and customer service was plesant."}
{"text":"For the most part, I agree with the other positive reviews here. However, when I saw my order of spaghetti and meatballs being packed into a shallow, 7 inch round tin meant for leftovers, I knew I would be disappointed. Sure enough, I was. Although tasty, the serving size was just skimpy, even for a very moderate appetite. Props for having 2 nice sized meatballs, but for $10.25, I felt cheated on the pasta, which is still relatively cheap.
I blame the patrons who, in recent years, have complained of restaurants serving \"too much food.\" I knew then that I could kiss my \"leftovers\" goodbye, and that's exactly what's happened. Happy days for the restaurant business!
 Now, I have to make my own frikkin' lunch. Thanks a lot, numb skulls!"}
{"text":"I picked this place tonight based on other good reviews. I couldn't decide between the burger or fish & chips, so i got the small (2 pcs) order of fish - I picked cod, but you can choose your fish from cod, tilapia or catfish.-
And the 1/4 lb burger. Came with seasoned fries & THREE very good sized pieces of fish. I can't finish it all but everything was so fresh, hot and tasted great. Service was quick and friendly. Definitely worth trying if you're in the area. I'm looking forward to trying their meatballs based on reviews as well :)"}
{"text":"To all the ladies out there, when you order from this place, not only will you LOVE THE FOOD but when the delivery man Murad comes up to your door. Let's just say he's a beast, very calm and professional, he's also always spot on because I've ordered food from their all the time. Everyone else there is great, fantastic job. Always looking good Murad is, Also every time I go there the manger and the cook (Bobby) are great people Very entertaining guys and girls, Bobby and Murad look exactly alike, great workers. But that Bobby is not as much as a beast as Murad is. I will be coming back! Fish n chips are the best in town!"}
{"text":"This was my first time trying this restaurant and I have to say I am extremely impressed. The whole experience was pleasant. The lady taking my order was very kind and efficient. When I arrived the gentleman was very helpful and quick in getting my order. My whole order was correct and still nice and hot by the time I got it home. We ordered spaghetti and meatballs - delicious would order again. Came with two meatballs
Mozzarella sticks- these were good as well. Nicely breaded and crisp enough
I had a cheeseburger and fries. The fries had a special seasoning that gave the fries a good flavor. Burger was delicious and the lettuce and pickles were both very fresh. Excellent experience and we will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"I am aware that there will be some loss of heat and goodness since it takes an hour to get to me, I'm ok with that, I have a microwave. This is my serving order and I do like the food. The burger was the best!!!! I will order more from them, just wish the minimum delivery amount was a little lower, I know have to reheat my fish for tomorrow. Other than that... I'm ok with it."}
{"text":"Summary: OK food at a budget friendly price.

Ordered for delivery, that was great because of the variety offered. The food was OK. Nothing special stood out. I have a good size family, we had a couple cheese steaks, grilled chicken hero, fish and chips, and a 1/4 lb burger. Since it was delivered, the fries were soggy, but I bet they're fine fresh. The sandwiches were decent for the price. I don't feel like they were lacking in meat compared to the roll they were on, just a little disappointed with the size. But again, they were budget friendly. My oldest daughter loves fish and chips, she was quite disappointed. She didn't think it was seasoned well (she got the English battered cod).

Oh, and we were short a beverage."}
{"text":"Live just blocks from here and came once when it was Marilyn's Fish & Chips! Now it's the Italian Spoon - family owned and operated- extremely kind staff and open to modifications on menu items so we could taste both zucchini & mushrooms in one order so we didn't have two full orders. The menu items are so varied that it was tough to decide. Our to go order ended up with two burgers, mozzarella sticks and the chicken cutlet parmigiana with spaghetti & marinara sauce. Plus our custom 1/2 fried zucchini & mushrooms. Had a diet coke (no charge) while waiting!  Excellent food! The Mozzarella sticks were amazing and the burgers were excellent as was the Chicken Parm; we will definitely go back and highly recommend this place. All this for $28.00!!!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered the fish (cod) and shrimp combo with a side of calamari rings.  I placed my order for takeout.

It was just one guy working both the counter and kitchen in the evening.  He was competent and cordial.

Calamari rings were very tender.  The calamari itself had a slight sweetness to it.  I wish they would've included marinara instead of tartar sauce.  I will be sure to ask next time.

Fries weren't bad.  I appreciated the seasoning salt on them.  The taste reminded me of Red Robin's fries.  A few that were nestled next to the tartar and cocktail sauces (which I didn't eat) were a little cold.

Shrimp were very crunchy (Panko breaking?) and a decent size for the price.

Cod was breaded very lightly so it was more like a \"skin\".  No crunch.  Fish pieces were large and fully cooked.  It was served piping hot.  I would hesitate to reorder this though as I like a nice crunch when I bite into my fish, not the squish of what I liken to the basic original recipe coating on KFC chicken.

I do miss the clams that the previous fish and chips restaurant here had.

They need to get rid of the broken chair, but it was very clean inside.

I definitely got a lot of food for around $15 after tax and tip.  It's a deep fried calorie bomb, but the  food wasn't greasy to the touch at least (though the container liners were definitely soaked through with oil). You do get that very full \"I just ate way too much fried food\" feeling afterwards though."}
{"text":"Wow. Philly cheese steak was serene. Pepper poppers were perfect. Great prices, good portion sizes. Marinara spaghetti and salad was also good. Delivery took 50 minutes on a Friday night, they were very nice."}
{"text":"Dudeeee this place is awesome. I've never had anything that wasn't absolutely delicious. Really good grub spot and reasonable too. Chicken Gyros with extra crispy fries are a must! Double burger with everything and grilled onions is juicy and delicious. The mozzarella sticks are super good. If you haven't been here before it's defiantly worth a try."}
{"text":"Great yummy food!! Had my meeting catered. Bomb gyro's!! Cost was really cheap! My employees love the cod fish and the salad. I had I baked ziti ... Fresh food I love it!"}
{"text":"A friend a I visited this cute little joint the other day and we were both thoroughly impressed with the food and service! Friendly staff and the pasta we enjoyed was delicious! Will definitely visit again :)"}
{"text":"Really liked this place. Had something for everyone and the staff was super nice! The food was awesome we got the fish and chips and the baked ravioli. Those fries are sooooo good."}
{"text":"Finally an Italian place that doesn't put a premium on noodles! Great service, friendly people. 

I ordered Mozzarella Sticks & the Spaghetti and Meatballs. The sticks were fried perfectly and had a light breading on them. The Spaghetti was cooked perfectly and the sauce was just the right amount, the meatballs, although I could be wrong, seemed like they were of a frozen variety, but still good none-the-less.

In a block full of Italian places Italian Spoon fit the bill and the budget! Great place please go check them out!"}
{"text":"These guys are always awesome, but this order I forgot to say no mustard on my burger and the chef freaking called me on his own to ask me if I made a mistake knowing I always say no mustard!  I love these guys!!!"}
{"text":"Service was great. The place is small but clean. The Cod Fish and breaded shrimps were good. The fried pieces were not greasy or heavy. A light crunch. We will be back."}
{"text":"First time here, my wife and I really enjoyed the food. They offer many options, you could get a quick snack, or a full meal. It's a nice family place, they are very nice and polite, friendly!! We had the meatballs with pasta, and a cheeseburger and fries. It is also very clean, I am very big on clean restaurants, and this definitely meets my criteria! You should try this place when you are in the area!!"}
{"text":"This place has a bit of an awkward branding, but I really enjoyed it.

If you're not in the mood for the $12 \"gourmet\" burgers at the other places then give this one a try.  It's more like an old school diner with smallish burgers that are $2.65 each.  Nothing fancy, just basic, and really good taste.

I also got the gyro which was the same.  Very good, classic taste overall.  

The gyro, cheeseburger, and free refill drink (no fries or extras) came to $11.07.  Friendly staff, easy parking, big tables.  Give this place a try if you want a simple lunch or dinner that's tasty but won't break the bank."}
{"text":"I decided to order from this restaurant using UberEATS. I order a meatball parmigiana, Italian cream soda and a cheesecake. Over priced reheated food is all I have to says ! 
The meatball parmigiana was like 14 bucks, it tasted like the meat ball marinara from subway, which could have been cheaper and the cheesecake looks like the one from the assorted cheesecakes from Frys. 
I feel like this business just buys food from elsewhere, reheats it and just vamp up the price to make profit. 

Just got elsewhere and save money"}
{"text":"I like this place, not that they're great, but the pricing is decent, and you can order something that isn't Chinese food or Pizza... which is a nice change of pace.

I've had the hit wings, which are decent, the pasta is okay, and the burgers are decent.  The fish and chips (traditional and cornmeal batter) are both above average.

While the place isn't the best around, I would definitely recommend them if you live in the area and want something different delivered."}
{"text":"I found this restaurant through friends of mine and I can't even count how many times I've driven past it and didn't know it has the best fried fish I've eaten here in Phoenix until a few days ago. Although the name gives no indication that it's sells fried fish, they have corn meal and English pub style options for cod, tilapia and catfish.  I don't eat catfish so I was extremely excited that I had other options.  This is a friendly family owned restaurant and local, which was a plus! And in the words of Arnold Schwarzenegger, \"I'll be back.\""}
{"text":"I've never eaten here before and had a late craving for some Italian, but I was too lazy to go dine out. I ordered on Postmates and my food was hot as if I was at the restaurant and honestly was some of the best Italian I've had in a while. Definitely recommend because it's delicious and affordable."}
{"text":"We stopped in for lunch on a Saturday. We were promptly greeted, had questions answered and recommendations made, and received our food quickly. The chicken & broccoli penne pasta was delish (my hubby and I split it, which I am glad we did!), the side salad was larger than we expected, and our friends were happy with their choices of Philly cheese steak and baked ziti. We're visiting from our of town so it's unlikely we'll return, but we totally would if we were here longer!"}
{"text":"I just don't know how to properly convey how eternally grateful I am to Jay (I think his name is Jay, hi jay!!) for this pickup order of spaghetti and meatballs. It is delicious, two huge meatballs and flavorful sauce that coats everything but doesn't overwhelm the spaghetti. Plus I accidentally called when he was closing and he stayed open an extra 20 minutes to make my order, and was very gracious and just welcoming and kind in general when I arrived. Seriously great place for pickup!! So friendly and the food is so yummy!!"}
{"text":"Great food good quality for ur buck no one is perfect people make mistakes in restaurant so I always give somebody a second chance"}
{"text":"Delivery took over an hour after being quoted 45 minutes. The grossest fish and chips I've ever had in my life. The fries were cold and limp. My sister liked her Burger, though."}
{"text":"Had the fish & chips...VERY VERY delicious! I will be back again & again to enjoy the great service and excellent food. I had a takeout order and it was ready in a short time and stayed hot and crispy when I got home."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and always reliable- the best customer service..."}
{"text":"The food was not the best Italian I have ever eaten, however it was quite good and I would order again.  The only issue I had was the 1 hour delivery time."}
{"text":"I've only ever ordered delivery but all 3 times, it's been amazing. Speedy delivery and delicious gyros. The peach cobbler cheesecake is absolutely scrumptious."}
{"text":"This place is a gem! What a find! I was craving hushpuppies and did a search on Yelp. Basic hushpuppies are not an easy find.  Italian Spoon popped up. After taking a look at the menu we agreed it had something for everyone and boy did it. The variety on their menu is outstanding. It is a place you can go and never have to worry about someone not finding something to eat. Everything was made fresh and came out amazing. I had the catfish sandwich and I would absolutely have it again and again.  Our table also had the chicken fettuccini, a burger, wings and of course the hushpuppies.  Everyone was very satisfied. We are so happy we found this place and we will be back! I can't forget to mention, the service was exceptional! We went on Saturday night, it is a small place, we were the only ones in there, but we quickly realized, this is the goto place for people to pick up their dinner and go home as there was a constant string of people coming in to pick up their orders. By the way, you can't beat the prices!"}
{"text":"Fish and shrimp fried perfectly... Excellent coleslaw. Thanks for the directions on getting home 
avoiding freeway traffic guys."}
{"text":"Small but nice spot with good service. Good number of choices on the menu, good portions, and good prices. Really impressed with the cod and catfish - breading was very good. Definitely would recommend."}
{"text":"If you're expecting a fancy Italian dinner, you should re-tude your mood, dude. This is the place to go when you've ordered Dominos too much for their pasta and are a little ashamed to face the delivery boy again.

This isn't to bash Italian Spoon, they have great fast-Italian food. I got the fettuccine Alfredo and it was just what I was looking for. A heaping pile of noodles, smothered in fatty dairy, served piping hot."}
{"text":"Seriously, so so so so so (did I mention so?) delicious. Everything from okra, baked ziti, chicken, and pies. Best delivery ever."}
{"text":"The ziti was fresh, we came in late and the crew hung around to get us fed. Thanks team."}
{"text":"We just moved to the nieghborhood, so we thought we would give this a try. We are really glad we did. My burger snd her pasta dish were both excelent. The prices sre very reasonable. I would recommend trying it out. See you next time."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery, arrived before estimated wait time. Food is FRESH! Fresh, smells and tastes delicious. The Philly Cheese is on point. I will be ordering from here again and again! I LOVE finding new, 5 Starr worthy places in my neighborhood."}
{"text":"Love this place ! Small little shop very comfortable and cool setting inside ! The service was great and fast! Interesting and big menu ! I  ordered the bake ziti and 2 piece fish . When I got home the food was excellent and hot . Would defiantly recommend to try them out !"}
{"text":"Fish and chips...um the best I've ever had! Tarter sauce, which makes a classic fish and chips meal, is made fresh! I've had classic fish and chips in England, New England, South Africa and more, but this was by far the best seasoned piece of battered fish I've had to date! The Italian dish we ordered ( ravioli maybe??) was pretty good too, but that yummy fish ruined all flavor sensations after the fact!"}
{"text":"Ordered food, it arrived 25 min earlier than the estimated time. The food was still piping hot, everything was crispy, and all of the special directions were followed. Their prices are amazing for the quality and the amount of food you get. We ordered the spicy chicken wings, 2 piece fish and chips and an order of hush puppies. The catfish was a really good size, and the cornmeal breading was delicious!! The hush puppies were awesome, and I couldn't believe that you got 10 in an order! The only complaint was that the order of \"hot\" or \"spicy\" wings were extremely mild; although were still good and cooked as requested, my friend had to add her own hot sauce to them. I thoroughly enjoyed my food & will be definitely be eating at the Italian Spoon again, but next time I'm going for the 4 piece catfish!"}
{"text":"Ordered from this place yesterday (on a Monday night) because they deliver and we wanted to try something new. Our food took well over an hour to arrive from the time we placed our order. Food was below average - fish was chewy and fries were soggy. Baked ziti was okay but lukewarm. Price point was too high for the quality of the food we received in my opinion. Considering the wait time and price I will probably not order from here again."}
{"text":"Wonderful, hole-in-the-wall place. Possibly the best fish and chips I've had. It was fresh. The portions were perfect. And the price was good. Staff was very friendly and went out of their way to take care of us. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Ordered the fish and chips, side of onion rings, side of zucchini, and a salad. It was really bad. Picked it up - food was waiting when I got there. 15 minute drive from my house. Got the food back to the house - it was cold and soggy - not ONE thing was crunchy.  I even put a special note on every item asking for crunchy - on the fries I asked for EXTRA crunchy! They totally ignored all of it. 

Worst fries ever - soft and bad flavor. Fish was not only not crispy, but also not particularly tender. I noticed a few hard spots - sign of cooking it incorrectly. Very disappointing. :("}
{"text":"Fish is great, salads big and fresh and the staff is friendly. I had the Shrimp and Fish... served piping hot out of the fryer, crispy and delicious.

In would recommend this any time... but not when you're in a hurry."}
{"text":"Stopped here almost by accident, but was very pleasantly surprised. People were nice and welcoming. Food was great. Definitely a fortunate accident! Highly recommend!!!!"}
{"text":"we order from these guys all the time, good to see them now on yelp.  great food, large portions, great price and quick delivery."}
{"text":"The fish and chips here were great! They also have pasta which looked good as well. I am definitely going to try the chicken marinara next time. Found this place on yelp and I agree it is five stars."}
{"text":"I contacted Italian Spoon on a Saturday evening - 6:30 pm - and placed a very large order, requesting items from their family portion menu. Due to an unexpected and quite urgent family gathering, I needed a lot of food (good food), fast. (It is not my typical practice to overwhelm a local restaurant, nor to need to feed 25 people with little notice.) The EatStreet app interface said the order would be delivered in 60 minutes. 

The Italian Spoon called and said that an order this large would actually take 90 minutes. This was an appreciated call; I would rather know that an order cannot be fulfilled as is stated, than wonder where the food was. However, I said that if the food could not arrive in 60 minutes, I would have to order from somewhere else. They reassured me that the food would arrive in 60 minutes. 

That order - three, large, tray-size pasta dishes with salads and garlic bread and an order of fish and fries - arrived in 45 minutes! Impressed I am! 

Thank you, Italian Spoon. I appreciate your outstanding customer service, willingness to call to keep your customer informed and beating your stated time of delivery. 

We are one, large and satisfied family who is now a devoted Italian Spoon consumer!"}
{"text":"I have ordered from Italian Spoon (Delivery) 10+ times. Never disappointed!

Cheeseburgers are AMAZING. Fried mushrooms are a flavor blast and always fresh and crispy. The cheese ravioli was extremely tasty as well.

Delivery service is always top notch. Arrives 15-20 minutes early than quoted EVERYTIME (grubhub.com).

Love this place!"}
{"text":"Excellent food. Great prices. Good portion sizes. I can't say enough good things about this little gem. Wanted delivery and saw Italian Spoon. Definitely the best option out there anywhere for delivery.

Highly recommend the Philly Cheese Steak sandwich. I got it with a 6 piece jalapeño poppers and...just wow.

Will order from here anytime I'm wanting delivery!"}
{"text":"Just tried out the Italian Spoon!! What a pleasant surprise!!  I had the fish (cod) and shrimp and chips with a side cole slaw. My other half got the chicken and brocolli pasta.  Food was very tasty and it was very good!!  Give it a try!! Oh did I say, the place was very clean!!"}
{"text":"Had the Catfishes sandwich, my husband had the catfish & shrimp with fries & a side of hush puppies and fried mushrooms! Everything showed up hot & crisp,my husband was so full he had a piece of fish to spare lol which definitely won't go to waste :) Can't wait to try their other options"}
{"text":"The chicken philly was amazing. My boyfriend and his brother got burgers and both said they were amazing. Also got a cheesecake and that was awesome as well. This place is great and accurate about the delivery time. Very yummy."}
{"text":"I ordered some takeout from Italian Spoon and it was really tasty! I ordered penne pasta with crispy chicken and broccoli, which was better than I was expecting for Italian fast food and for the price. They also sell root beer and cream soda. For dessert, I ordered chocolate mousse cake--delish. Delivery was fast and the driver was very nice. I hardly ever order food delivery but Italian Spoon will definitely be on my shortlist."}
{"text":"Ordered using postmates. This restaurant is only 3 miles from home but I was home with my sick child so we called it in. The baked ziti was runny and the cheese was barely melted. Ordered fried shrimp and French fries for my daughter the shrimp was actually still cold from the freezer... and she wouldn't eat  the fries and fries are her favorite ...so nope nope nope"}
{"text":"Just tried this place for the first time because they deliver. It came pretty quick and the food was still hot when we got it. Perfect for an easy night in. We ordered the baked ziti which came out super cheesy and delicious and the philly cheese steak which was great too."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I ordered for delivery 10 mins before closing and they were super cool about it ! My chicken caesar salad was fresh and big enough for 2. My boyfriend had the catfish sandwich and ate it before I got a chance to take a pic lol he said it was . 

I'd give 10 stars if I could"}
{"text":"Fantastic little restaurant. Food was amazing and they smiled when we ordered food for 15 people to go! Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Hands down best mom and pop Italian restaurant!! Had the Caesar salad was sooooo good. Lots of cheese, croutons and dressing. Baked ziti was the absolute best. Lots of meat and cheese melted on top. Best customer service and what a great family. A lot of respect for this establishment and you guys have great food. We need more of these!! :)"}
{"text":"Tonight was my first time trying this place. I was looking for delivery and they delivered through eat 24 and postmate. They only charged $3.00 for delivery so that was already a good start since postmates often charge $7. I ordered cheese ravioli, grilled chicken ceasar and sweet potato pie. The ravioli was really good, had a good flavor, sauce was decent and it had both ricotta and mozerella cheese. The salad was blah, the lettuce was fresh and so was the parmesan but the the chicken tasted processed. It was bland and def not fresh. Since the salad itself was fresh this saved the salad I just threw the chicken to the side. The dressing was good. When I saw the pie I was nervous bit I still decided to taste it and to my surprise it was decent. It wasn't like mamas pie but it was good. I would try this place again. I probably would just order ceasar salad no chicken and the ravioli again. The price point was good as well."}
{"text":"Great food at a great price.  Some of the best cod fish and chips I have had in Phoenix.  House salad with balsamic was good too."}
{"text":"Average at best. The pasta was overcooked, the meatballs were not great, calamari was the only good thing. Disappointed in my experience."}
{"text":"Yum yum yum yummmmmm....

Ordered delivery,  and was happy when it showed up early.  I ordered a Philly cheese steak and a Ceasar salad.

The Philly was soooooo yummy.  The steak was very good,  and the onions and peppers were cooked perfectly. 

The salad was fresh and big for the price.  The one thing that was interesting was the salad dressing. The salad was soo big that it came with two Ceasar dressings. One was thick and creamy and the other was very runny. No big deal. I only needed one. 

5 stars because the food was soo good I couldn't stop eating until it was all gone.  The inconsistency of the salad dressing was no biggie.  I would eat here again."}
{"text":"I've only been here once. I'll probably try it again. I got baked ziti, it was good but the pasta was seriously over-cooked. The salad was okay - not super fresh but not bad. The bottled Italian dressing was disappointing."}
{"text":"We called for delivery on a Sunday night 16 minutes before close.  Not only did we actually get the delivery, it was REALLY GOOD!  Portion sizes are LARGE!  Enough for 2 meals.  The owner actually made the delivery for us and we were 4 miles away.  Highly impressed by their  great food and even better service!!"}
{"text":"On Sunday, December 4, 2016 we placed a $38.00 order (including tip) for wings and salads. What we got was barbecue wings with long strings of black \"human\" hair.

We called the restaurant directly to advise of the issue and was immediately verbally attacked by a woman stating how everyone there wear hair nets and how we must be mistaken. While trying to further explain our findings in the food, the women at the restaurant hung up on us.

It was at this time we decided to drive to the restaurant with our \"wings wrapped in human hair\" to show them the evidence and to request a refund or fair settlement. Upon entering the restaurant there was no one wearing hair nets accept the woman we think initially answered our phone call. While she was not wearing a hair net she was wearing a garment covering her head, but by her own acknowledgment she was not the cook.

Her tone changed from the abrupt conversation on the phone. To their credit while we were in route to their restaurant she did call back to offer a $10.00 refund. However, the damage was done and we will not support this establishment and suggest very strongly no one else should as well.

The professional way to have handled this issue would have been to apologize for the mishap and offer us a fresh order or refund. Instead the young man at the restaurant debated us over the issue and told us to leave. We did not raise our voices or cause a disturbance, but he still treated 

STIR CLEAR OF THIS ESTABLISHMENT!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for that home made style, this is it. The plates aren't elegant, the restaurant is small, but the portions are large and fatty, and the workers are very friendly and will get you whatever you need. 

My table ordered mozzarella sticks, fried calamari, seasoned fries, beef ravioli, salad, and spaghetti and meat balls. The appetizers came in a basket, burning your the roof-of-your-mouth type hot. They were both crispy, hot, and yummy; but nothing special - a small step up from your perfectly made freezer aisle type at home. I wish they seasoned the fries more. My beef raviolis (6) were were large, tasty, and smothered in cheese. The melted cheese was stringy, i loved it. Everything was good, not bad. 

Service was fast and attentive. I don't think I'd come here on a date; but if I'm craving some fast, comfort food for an affordable price, I'd come here.

{"text":"I was so excited to find this place on Grubhub and EatStreet yesterday, because there aren't many places that deliver to my job. However, when my food arrived, an hour and a half later (when estimated delivery time was 45-60 minutes), all of my food was soggy. I ordered the cod fish filet sandwich combo, a slice of cheesecake and a chicken parmigiana sandwich. The fish sandwich was completely inedible. The fish was under cooked in parts and completely dry and chewy in the rest and the entire thing was literally dripping with grease. I threw most of it away. Not to mention, it was not a filet at all, it was the fish pieces they would use with their fish and chips (I'm assuming) on a bun with no lettuce (as their menu promises). The fries tasted great, but again the entire order was completely soggy. The soda they brought was different than what I ordered and the delivery guy literally handed me my order and ran out the front door. A lady had called me right before he arrived to apologize for my order being late but that they were extremely busy today, but assured me my food would be fresh because they are made in the order of when they were going out for delivery.... she was wrong and there was no attempt made to give me a discount on this order or even my next. I haven't even the other sandwich yet, and I'm a little bit nervous to. The only silver lining in this experience was that the cheesecake was delightful! I may order from this place again just to give them a second chance and again, because so few places deliver to me but I was not at all pleased with this experience."}
{"text":"Be Cautious!!
My sister and I ordered everything from shrimp/fish dinner, fish/chip dinner, fried mushrooms, okra and cheese cake.
What a catastrophe. The food, excluding the cheese cake was inedible.
The shrimp/fish dinner had NO shrimp. So, for $12.99 I received one piece of fish.
The mushroom's were pure water inside. The okra was overcooked and tough.
I immediately contacted the restaurant and offered to respectfully return their conglomeration of inedible food products.
I was told a credit would immediately be given, but don't return the food. Imagine ?!?!
After two additional contacts the manager did not return my calls nor credit me, as promised.
The $50.99 spent on this nightmare was regrettable.
Friends, go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Had delivery from here on Sunday. They quoted 40-50 minutes and it arrived in about 45, hot and delicious by a kind guy in a Cardinals jersey. Mozzarella sticks, 4 pieces of catfish and fries, and white chocolate raspberry cheesecake. The mozzarella sticks were fantastic as was the fish. The fries were just average...but the cheesecake. OMG. So good. I will definitely order from this place again. I think next time I will try the cod.  Prices are reasonable... it was $23 for appetizer, food, dessert, tax, tip, and delivery fee."}
{"text":"All I can say is worst food ever. Ordered through Amazon, steak and cheese sandwich was mostly peppers and onions and very little meat.  Cheese ravioli, which I asked for extra sauce on were very dry and very few.  Baked ziti which I also asked for extra sauce on again were very dry and if there was ricotta and mozzarella in them, they were invisible.  The piece of mozzarella they put on top of the ziti was such bad quality it wouldn't even melt.  The fried zucchini and mushrooms were your typical frozen variety.  Mind you this was a $46. order and a first time order, you think they would have tried to make a  better impression. I usually don't bother to write reviews but a really hate to see any one else waste their money on this over priced skimpy food."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery through their website and \"EatStreet\" last night that took an hour and 35 minutes to be delivered. I was told the estimated delivery time would be 7:10 and the driver didn't bring me my food until 745. My mozzarella sticks and spaghetti were both cold, the cheesecake was so warm it had the consistency of whipped cream and they forgot the salad dressing entirely. Safe to say I won't be ordering from this establishment again"}
{"text":"I needed and quick and easy Sunday night meal, and I was grubby from doing work around the house so I ordered takeout and Italian Spoon was not half bad, and by not half bad I mean it was actually pretty good!  I always order too much food when taking out or getting delivery from a new place, afraid if I don't like my first choice I better have a backup.  In this case I didn't need it... 

My first choice was the chicken cutlet parm hero, it came on a really good roll and was the perfect blend of sauce and cheese! I'm glad I picked up because this has a risk of getting really soggy during delivery. It was about six inches so not huge but enough. I really enjoyed it and would order it again.  

My second choice was the 2pc fish and chips. I got cod and English Style for the breading. It came with fries. It was served with tartar sauce but I added a little malt vinegar at home. The fish was good quality white not grey and the flavor, well it was pretty darn good.  I'd already scarfed down the sandwich at this point so I could only eat one piece. I recommend the English Style breading though. 

I also got a half/half side of the fried mushrooms and fried zucchini. Nothing special here, standard bar food fare but again what I could eat, cuz I was stuffed, was tasty.  Feeling fat right now!! 

This is a great alternative to pizza or Chinese, the owners were friendly and it's clearly and family business."}
{"text":"I was house sitting and needed some food to be delivered. We ordered at 5:40 and it arrived at 6:30, if not earlier. The chicken parm and baked ziti was great. The only complaint I have is that I think I got the wrong dessert. I ordered the chocolate mousse and I think I got the other chocolate cake they offer. I took a pic because it still looks good and hoping someone will read this to confirm my suspicions."}
{"text":"Not sure why this place had such high reviews. we ordered  philly cheesesteak and Catfish sandwich,  would give them less than  a 2,,  the only good things we ordered was the fried okra.  we also order the cheesecake & Sweet potato pie, never seen a smaller piece of any rest. I have ever been too. I am sure there must be some great things on their menu, just not going to try again.. Too many choices in Phoenix area."}
{"text":"I gave them a try one day a few weeks ago, and have been a repeat customer a few times a week. They have a good selection of ways to prepare chicken (parm, gyro, sandwhich,etc) which i love. Good fries, mozz sticks etc. I love an easy, quick, family owned(i'm assuming) grill that is convenient. 5 star for being friendly, affordable, fast, and good."}
{"text":"Great food and love the spaghetti and meatballs.  Garlic bread is awesome. Delivery was very slow 1 hour 30min but they were busy and gave 15% off for trouble. We were from out of town and this was a great meal to have"}
{"text":"Wow. I saw the ad for this place for delivery on Yelp And decided to give it a try. I was very impressed. I tried the cheeseburger and I loved it I can't wait to try their wings next."}
{"text":"Ordered from here on Saturday night and was very pleased.  I ordered the catfish with fries, okra, slaw and stuffed peppers.  Delivery was fast and food was hot.  Portion size is large.  Will order again and try some pasta next time."}
