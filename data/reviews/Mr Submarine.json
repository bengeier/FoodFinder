{"text":"Mr. Submarine is my go-to sub shop when it comes to comfort food.  The Pizza sub is amazing and there is nothing that compares to it in the valley.  They are a locally owned business that make you feel like old friends."}
{"text":"Nothing fancy just great sandwiches made quickly by nice folks. They are moving next door soon so we'll see how the menu evolves."}
{"text":"You would just think with a name like Mr. Submarine that this would be the place to go for a submarine.  Sad to say, I'd totally opt for Subway.  The prices are reasonable but the choices are slim.  We're talking ham, turkey, Italian, that's about it.  I believe my sandwich came with the equivalent of one slice of deli meat.    If I had to pick a word to describe this place it would be lackluster.  Nothing special whatsoever.  They didn't even have any bread selection, if I remember correctly you could chose between white or wheat.  Which is the selection I had as a child, before people cared about bread.    A lazy, hungover mother could make a better sandwich for her kid to take to school in the morning... I know, because mine did all the time.  And we never called her Mr. Submarine, at least not that I can remember."}
{"text":"Solid four stars, as they are fast, friendly, and their subs are tasty!  As other Yelpers have noted, the choices here are nothing thrilling or exotic. I really like the pastrami, piled nice n high with some spicy mustard and jalapanos! So good.  I really like that I can stumble out of my house, walk down the block and receive the quality offerings."}
{"text":"So what can I say. This is my go to place when I am craving a rostbeef sub! For over 20 years I have been coming to this same sandwich shop. Still as good as before. No others can compare!!!!! Best in the valley. Not skimpy with toppings or meat. Bread is always soft. My family and I drive along way for these subs!"}
{"text":"If you're near the Biltmore area and want an authentic sub, head to Mr. Submarine. You don't get the \"sexy\" ingridients like avocado or truffels. What you get is an awesome sub with top notch ingridients. Seriously though, avocado on a sub??? Huh???? Their oil and vinnegar dressing is one of man's greatest achievements. It's so freaking good...(begins to drool.)   The service is always great and friendly. So if you want something real with taste to boot, then try Mr. Submarine."}
{"text":"Love this place! We have been eating here for years. Great subs, prices, service, and kids love it!"}
{"text":"Delicious. Ordered a classic Italian on white. The bread was delicious. Great deal."}
{"text":"I like going to this place because it has a very simple menu but the food is always good."}
{"text":"I laugh at the silly reviews. This is a mom and pop shop that has been in business a long time. Regulars like us keep the business going, and will continue to in the future. If you are complaining about the two choices of bread go to subway. If you are complaining about the ambiance, go elsewhere. This place is special to regulars and those in the know can tell you they dont have to have special breads, or a wall full of different subs to impress.  Try a meatball sub, the meatballs are great. Especially on Plain WHITE bread. I dont come here for the 10 types of bread or the 50 different sandwiches. This place is old school, and that's what I love about it. Rudy and Gloria are always fantastic. I drive out of my way to eat here. I live in the SW valley to trek up to 24th St and Osborn.  Support Your Local Mom and Pop Shop....!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great subs, been around forever, love it!  Thank You"}
{"text":"Bread is perfect. Meat is great. Basic sandwich shop with awesome customer service. Came in during lunch time. Seen what seems to be regulars which is a plus. They was right to there orders without them saying a thing.  I enjoyed my Italian sub and will be back"}
{"text":"I thought I'd head to Mr. Submarine for a quick bite since it seemed like the little speck of independent business floating in a sea of Subway.  Eh.  Anytime I've driven by it, there'd be no more than one customer inside. Much of the time it's empty (making me think that it's closed when it really isn't). And now I know why:  1) The dining seats kind of remind me of train station waiting areas. No music. It's extremely quiet. Kind of weird.  and  2) Next, the sandwich. White or wheat are the options for bread, and look just like Subway loaves, maybe a tad flimsier. Cheese is just that - cheese. One long strip of cheese. No indication of what kind of cheese it is. Just cheese. Some standard fixin's, but nothing that seemed better or different from Subway, and even less options. Turkey came from a pre-wrapped ball. And regular plain yellow mustard. Overall, the taste was basically like a Subway sandwich, but with less stuff in it. Cost was $6.50 for a footlong. Kind of steep for what you're getting.  Counter service was fine, quick, and courteous, and I thought Mr. Submarine was going to have something more going for it besides the fact it isn't a Subway.  But I guess that's the only thing."}
{"text":"Love the sandwiches! So happy to have found Me Sub by my house. Always fresh meats and cheeses, and fresh bread! So delicious!"}
{"text":"Checked out the new location for Mr Sub....  Great improvement on the seating and interior, excellent customer service, but I was hoping for an upgrade on the subs too... You've got the look to be a great sub shop, great Poor Bros Chips, so upgrade to boar's head or other high quality lunch meat & then I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I've lived in Phoenix since 2005. This is one of those places I drove by for years and years and years wondering how it stayed in business. It's super basic and has this big Mr. Submarine sign. In fact, it wasn't until 2014 that I finally was just like, \"you know, I want a sandwich, let's check it out. I bore of chains easily and I didn't want something from Sub Factory and variety is good.\" (I talk to myself in lengthy run-on sentences).  But, damn, Mr Submarine has good subs. I LOVE their italian sub. Whether its the 3 kinds of ham they use, how mom and pop it is or their pickles, its the best submarine sandwich I can find in this part of town and I make it a point to grab one whenever I'm nearby now.  So yeah, stop at Mr. Submarine, that sign wore me down eventually."}
{"text":"Have been coming here since 1979, always fresh and great tasting submarine sandwiches. New location just south of original on the SE corner is bright and clean and serves up the same great subs.   Now with salads and wraps there is something for anyone and since you build it the way you want it is always great.   Very nice friendly staff and great food for over 37 years, they have to doing it right."}
{"text":"Case# 25       Food of my childhood  I have been eating these subs since I was a little kid. My mom (R.I.P) used bring me here and it is one of the few childhood memories I hang on to. For those who do not know about this place as the food detective I will share a little background info from my case files to help you out.   Mr. Submarine is actually a small chain that really got it's start here in the valley in the early 80's. At one time the locations stretched from the east valley to west phoenix. With increased competition from larger sub chains ( Subway, Cousins, Blimpy, and Quiznos they were forced to limit their growth and use word of mouth advertising to keep customers coming in. This resulted in store closings and now only two locations remain open. When you try and compare a place like this to say a subway which spends big time money to advertise their five dollar foot long special, or their new breakfast sandwich there is no competition.   This place wins by a mile. Who needs a 5 dollar foot long that is served by some teenager who only cares about his shift ending so he can escape. No, I would rather have the owner there serving me a sandwich that he himself is going to eat for lunch. Don't give me slimy meat and dried out looking cheese. I want soft fresh bread with toppings that enhance the other components of my sandwich not cover it up! OK enough with the ranting, this place is a no frills type of place. No wraps or cookies. They offer the normal meat choices including ham, turkey, tuna and your choice of bread ( white, wheat, and sourdough).  No annoying jingles or sandwich Nazis (read my subway review), just good food, made and served by someone who cares about what they are selling you.  They are open Monday through Friday 10am to 10pm and Saturday and Sunday from 10am to 8pm.  They are a little more pricey than Subway but for a great sandwich and great service it is well worth the price.  Case closed"}
{"text":"A decent no-frills submarine sandwich - it's pretty simple. This place has been open almost 40 years and is based on a popular Canadian chain of subs shop, now called Mr. Sub back there. The ambiance of the place is classic 70's fast food, and not much has changed. The owner usually works the counter and is pretty friendly and seems to know all the regulars. This is NOT a gourmet or hipster sandwich shop. To be succinct, the sandwiches here are about as plain and simple as it gets - variety of cold cuts with some toppings and condiments, on white or wheat bread. There are also some hot menu items like meatball. The bread, meats, toppings etc are all decent. Not the best, and definitely not the worst. My main complaint would be the weak bread-to-meat ratio - I've gotten the popular Italian sub and found it to be more bread than cold cuts. I enjoyed it, but it left me wanting more.  Don't go with high expectations -this is a plain everyday local sub shop and their consistency and simplicity keep the customers coming back, who seem to support this iconic mom 'n pop location at 24th St & Osborne.  UPDATE: I've been several times now, because its conveniently located near my work. I have to say, the meatball sub is pretty bomb!"}
{"text":"Mr. Submarine serves basic-duty subs. This is the kind of spot that would have been wiped out by Subway in the 80's, but they keep it going. There's no innovation, just basic subs in a couple of sizes. Choose the meat and bread, whether you want cheese, and a few things to go on top.  I eat there whenever I'm in the area at lunchtime."}
{"text":"If this is the same Mr. Submarine that used to be at 19th Ave and Osborn, this place is is awesome. Rudy used to be the owner. Fresh bread, meats, cheese and veggies all the time. BEST BANG FOR THE BUCK. I used to work at the one at 7th Ave and Camelback, next to Hanrattys."}
{"text":"Just tried mr submarine for the first time and I must say I will be back again. I had a pastrami sandwich and the ingredients were definitely fresh and full of flavor."}
{"text":"Mr. Submarine is hands down my favorite sandwich shop. All of the ingredients are tasty and fresh. The best part of this place is the fresh bread. I prefer the wheat bread. I would recommend trying the BLT, but my all time favorite sub is the Italian salami. I often stop by for lunch, even during their busiest of times the services is exceptional and timely. Their new location is just steps away from the old shop. This new place still has the charm and authenticity of the other place. You won't want to go back to any other sandwich place after you have a sub from Mr. Submarine. They are also great for events I have catered from them several times and they always do a great job!"}
{"text":"We've been coming here forever, since back when it used to be in that little building to the north of the current building.  The subs are super traditional so not tons of fancy stuff but that's why I like it.  It's consistently good, the customer service is great and is a perfect lunch sub."}
{"text":"Great customer service but the subs are ordinary. The quality is similar to Subway. Yelp apparently does not like short reviews....it won't post unless I write a story. That's annoying!"}
{"text":"Overpriced subs. Good customer service, but subs are ordinary. Nothing special about this place."}
{"text":"I'm not much of a sandwich/sub person, it's not something a desperately crave, but I am a Mr. Submarine kind of person. Some of these reviews are right in saying that Mr. Sub isn't anything fancy and they are very simple subs. But guess what? There's other places that do fancy so if that's what you want then go elsewhere. I have been a fan of Mr. Submarine since 2010, I remember the year because one of my best friends took me here after school and her and her family have been regulars for years. Then I became a regular myself and now my sisters also goes here often. If you love to support local and family owned business with GREAT customer service then this is a spot you need to check out. Unfortunately I went to the \"dark side\" for a bit and started visiting a non-local sub shop, but I'm back and loving their new space.They may not be \"fancy\" but they're still good quality and it's a place where you can really get to know the people working there."}
{"text":"Sub I got was mostly bread. The bread is good but they barely put any meat on it and tasted like all bread. I got the Italian It was my first time and I noticed on the menu it said double meat for $$ extra and I did not get extra meat but should have because It tasted like all bread. I don't think I will go back."}
{"text":"Been a customer for years.  Love the new location and the addition of tortilla wrap and salad options to a simple menu.  The owners are wonderful and caring, food is fresh and delicious, and everything is always very clean.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Got a sub + chips for dinner. It was a little better than subway but I was disappointed they used pre-sliced meat. The turkey was ok but very wet. A bit skimpy for a 12\" sandwich. All of the meat was in the middle, the edges were just bread. They use thick and soft wheat loaf, a lot like Subway's bread. But it was too much bread for the ratio of meat. But I admit it tasted fine and wasn't excessively expensive. However I probably won't go back. For the same price, I believe Romanelli's is considerably better. They use better bread and have fresh sliced boar's head cold cuts and offer several kinds of cheese."}
{"text":"I've been patronizing this place since the early 80's.   Always good, always fresh and the owner is a great guy. I travel a lot and don't live anywhere near this place but given the opportunity, I will go out of my way to go here and get an Italian, double meat, double cheese, w/ lettuce, tomato, onion, oil and vinegar.   Now that's a sammich!"}
{"text":"This is a great mom & pop sandwich shop that I believe is better than Subway.  For the most part, their subs are basic but the ingredients are fresh and the place is a neat hang-out."}
{"text":"Very good sandwich shop. Small lil place but great sandwiches."}
{"text":"First time here and cant wait to come back. Only issue i had was deciding on which sandwich to get. The pastrami was absolutely delicious"}
{"text":"I love mr submarine! they are very similar to the mr submarine in Chicago, although they say they are not affiliated. Which they had more locations!!!! My guy loves the mayo and the bread the best. I love their cheese."}
{"text":"I have been coming to mr. submarine since I was a kid and the location on the west side was still open. I have since moved to California but when I come into town this is a must stop for me. the subs taste the same as they did when I was a kid. I love this place. best submarine place I have ever found!!!"}
{"text":"Disappointing... chose this one over subway, paid $8 for a damn dry microwaved pastrami sandwich..smh"}
{"text":"I first went to Mr Submarine in 1979 bern coming every since. Always great service and they always remember what we order even after months."}
{"text":"Over priced subs I ordered a 6 inch pizza sub and received a 4 inch cheese sandwich with tomato sauce no joke $7.49 with a 16oz water"}
