{"text":"You win some and you lose some.  That just about sums this place up for me.  Nice to see that a historic bar is still standing anywhere in the USA.  Too bad the food offerings seemed to be just about as old as the subway tiles and woodwork.   (I must say that I ate at the bar and didn't go down into the restaurant.)

Take a deep breath before entering and hold it until you get to the bar area.  The place smells like a college watering hole; maybe that's because drinks have been spilled on every inch of this place over the many years its been open.  Once you get to the bar you'll be drawn in by the woodwork, tin ceilings and friendly vibe.  Bartender was really nice and offered some suggestions when he realized the Newcastle line was frozen.  It must happen regularly because he sent someone downstairs to fix it and in about 20 minutes it was working again.  He even poured me a shot of this pomegranate lemonade mixture that was pretty tasty.

The menu didn't excite me but I have to say that most of the food I've seen so far in Pittsburgh doesn't do much for me either.  Opting for an appetizer, I went with this banana pepper stuffed with Italian sausage (hey, it sounded interesting).   It was forgettable, and smothered with marinara to the point of being overwhelmed.  Oh well, the beer was cold, the bartender was nice and they even switched the TV to my game in between periods of the Pens game."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick drink on new years eve about 3 pm . The place was empty . The bartender Chris was rude and very vulger . He made a crude sexual comment as soon as we sat down . We decided to stay for a drink anyway . After going a couple of choices we were told the bar was out of most stock . On New Years Eve ??? The Bartender kept complaining about his job and bosses for the next 10 minutes . We paid for our drinks and got up and left . Might be the strangest employee experience I had in awhile ."}
{"text":"I was recently in some training in Pittsburgh, and we came here towards the end of our class.

They had a sign on the curb outside that said they had \"the best prime rib\".  Now, I don't think I can say that they had \"the best\", but it was very good, and a pretty big serving too.

Our waiter (John) was exceptional, excellent service, fun personality, very knowledgable."}
{"text":"I like the 1902 Tavern.  It received the first liquor license in western Pennsylvania in 1902.  True, there are better choices and I'm essentially a non-drinker.

But, hey, what do you expect for bar food in Downtown?  I had a burger and fries which were as good as any I've had.  The best day to go is on any Thursday on \"Market Street Thursdays\", from June to August. Sitting outside, listening to the band while eating.

Not a bad place to be!"}
{"text":"Disagree with previous post. Went to 1902 tavern for lunch a few weeks back. To start the waiter appeared to be either on crack or speed. Second I was with a party of 4 that all ordered salads. I decided to go with the steak. Awful call on my part. The salad took 45 minutes to arrive, along with the cracked out waiter (who we hadn't seen for at least 30 minutes) The steak was total bullshit. Overcooked and cold. The salad had way too much iceberg lettuce and tasted like crap. I won't be back until Pittsburgh decides to clean up Market square and all of the vargrants that inhabit the area. Where do these people come from? and is there nothing better to do except sit around market square, smoke cigarettes and throw your trash everywhere so city workers can clean up after your filthy asses? My advice to you son, is do the same as your father, and his father did...get a job!!!"}
{"text":"Market Square was not quite what I expected. Maybe it was the fact that most of the buildings around it seem to be under construction. There were people out and about in the square and eating outside at the 1902 Tavern. The inside was as described by others. I ate at the bar and the bartender was attentive. 

The food is typical pub grub, burgers, chicken sandwiches, and the prime rib. There was some guy at the end of the bar drinking, watching the Pirates and going on and on about the prime rib to some other guy that had the misfortune of sitting nearby. Needless to say I had the Landmark Chicken Sandwich. It was good food. Not the best I've ever had, but good and inexpensive. My beer and sandwich came in about $13 before the tip. 

The atmosphere wasn't great inside the restaurant, but there weren't many people in there at all. This was a Monday evening."}
