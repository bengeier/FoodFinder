{"text":"Have visited this place three times, each time hoping it wouldn't be a giant pile of suck.  Unfortunately I was let down each time.

First meal was fried walleye.  Tough to go wrong with deep fried anything, right?  Wrong.  It seemed like the oil wasn't hot enough because the breading was like a grease-filled sponge.  All served up on chopped iceberg lettuce?  Weird.

Honestly can't remember the second meal.  But the kids ordered pancakes that were burnt on one side and dry.

Third meal was some breakfast skillet.  Menu item specifically mentioned breakfast sausage.  When I received my skillet, there was no meat.  Told my waitress.  We looked through the skillet together to find meat.  We failed.  She went to ask the cook what the deal was.  The cook assured her that the meat was mixed in with the gravy.  Fail.

Three strikes and you're out.

Have to agree with other review.  Huge menu full of mediocrity at best, crap at worst.

Now when I drive by I just shake my head and pray they'll go out of business so we have a chance a getting a better place in Monticello."}
{"text":"Went here on Sunday and ordered the special which was baked chicken, choice of potato and soup or salad.  I choose the salad and a baked potato.  First of all the salad is merely bag lettuce put in a bowl. Nothing more.  And it was room temperature. Yuck!  But the ranch dressing was good. 

 I loved the sweet tea!!

My Mom ordered the baked chicken too and when our plates arrived my Mom's was all dark meat while mine was all white meat.  How they choose that I do not know but my Mom was displeased with her chicken a lot.  The corn was down right awful.  It had some funky flavor that I could not figure out.  Obviously it had the canned taste but there was something else there.........

My chicken was good.  It came with a light gravy over it which made it all that better.  The baked potato....well how can you mess up a baked potato?  I'll tell you how. Only offer Country Crock margarine in those little tubs.  Do they know what that is made of???  Ugh!  It can kill you!! That stuff is gross.

I had to ask for extra napkins.  Another warning: Their napkins are thin and feeble and they only give you one. It disintegrates on contact.  

A few improvements would be: Stronger napkins. COLD lettuce for salad and try adding some cheese and tomatoes to spice it up a bit.  Ask if the customer prefers white or dark meat.  Get some real butter.  And get a different vendor for your corn because it is really bad.  Did it come over on a boat from China??

My server was great!!"}
{"text":"The staff was friendly and attentive. The food was good. I had the Reuben with fries and chicken noodle soup. The soup was fantastic, the Ruben was diced corn beef verses sliced, and was a little difficult to eat without it falling out on the plate. However, it was very tasty as was the fries. I was a little confused with the slice of tomato, pickle and lettuce that was on the plate next to my sandwich.

The restaurant was clean and spacious."}
{"text":"Wife and I were planning to eat at the 3 Ravens a couple doors down, but she reminded me that she doesn't like pub environments and dragged me a few steps away to Carmona's. We were the only patrons in the place, and I warned her what that usually meant. Nevertheless, we ordered the goulasch (sic) special and shrimp alfredo. 

As a rule of thumb, I steer clear of alfredo at diners. there is inevitably that pool of yellowy butter stuff gathered at  the bottom of the plate and the noodles are clumped together and rubbery. It really is one of the most difficult dishes for a diner to do well. But, that's what the wife ordered. 

Well, pleasantly surprised. the alfredo was fresh, light, and consistent. Goulash as well. Terrific dishes with ample portions. And, the space was bright and comfortable with incredibly tall front doors. If the rest of the food is as good as what we were served, this place has promise. Prices are very low. We walked away for around $20.

Only fours stars for two reasons. First, the TV. Such a great space should be paired with some nice music, not NBC. turn them off. Secondly, no garnish, vegetable, or anything in the dishes. Just pasta and meat. Entrees need some complexity, even if it's on the side. So in conclusion, I should listen to my wife more."}
{"text":"Menu seems all over the place, they have a wide variety but master nothing.  

I ate the Monte Cristo which was great, but the fact I got fries that was not informed were and extra $2 for a total of, get this, 15 fries.  $2....15 fries.   I get that since restaurants jacked the price of soda to the cost of a 2 liter per glass everyone stopped drinking soda at restaurants now they are charging $2 for half a potato worth of fries.  Seriously?  I could buy a bag of potatoes and make 4 pounds of my own fries for that amount.

Over all, though the food is good it is not worth the $5 for just a sandwich I could make at home."}
