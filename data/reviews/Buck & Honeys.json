{"text":"The food is good but very pricey for what you get. The waitstaff has always been very very slow and takes forever to just get your drinks. Everybody is always very nice though. The atmosphere is very neat, especially the outside sitting area. They always have some sort of live music going on."}
{"text":"My wife and her family went there for lunch.  Found a bug crawling out of  one of their salads!  Never going back to this place and telling everyone I know to avoid it."}
{"text":"Buck and Honey's is the best restaurant in Sunny P with excellent staff, great food, and all at a very good value.  I eat there weekly and have rarely had food that could've been better.  The drinks are always made well and served correctly, though I wish they kept a porter on tap all the time."}
{"text":"Take out just as good as dining in!  For the first time since they opened I ordered take out from Buck and Honey's and it was just as satisfying as eating there, except you miss the exceptional service you receive from Tom & Chris's crew!  Special shout out to Aimee and Beth, they rock!"}
{"text":"Not  a local resident,  was in the area shppping, looked up a place to eat with this app, decided to check it out..No reservation, was told better with reaervation...possible 45 to hour wait but hostess kept an eye to get us seated, so points for taking care of non regular customers as quickly as possible.didnt end being that long....Sat Prime Rib special, very good..worth the price..cooked the way you wanted, comes two sides..prime pork steak was also good..not a fan of apple sauce but didnt deter the flavor of seasoning..serving staff attentive to your water or needs...we would come back, if in the area again"}
{"text":"Food was excellent, and a very nice presentation of food!  I highly recommend the French Onion Soup!"}
{"text":"Pretty good food, but the fish tacos I ordered were rather dry and the wait staff was weird about us asking to switch tables (the one we were at had the sun shining right in our eyes.) But the service was friendly, and I'd probably go back. I would just make sure to sit inside the next time."}
{"text":"First I must say how wonderful it is to have such a \"top shelf\" restaurant in  small farming community like Sun Prairie.  The first time was a sensory flashback to fine dinning in New York City. I've been back four more times and not a single complaint except I wanted more. Gave three gift certificates away as Christmas gifts last year and again this year as well. The salmon and the Seared Ahi Salad are my favs when in the mood for seafood but nothing beats their perfectly grilled steaks. If you haven't been there, well your in for a pleasant treat. Oh ! And Romantic."}
{"text":"I've been here several times and while the service is pretty decent and atmosphere is enjoyable, the food is \"hit & miss\". I've had some great meals (chipotle chicken pasta is one of the best pastas I've ever had, and fish tacos were very tasty), while some meals simply just did not taste good. I had the \"mango chicken skewers\" recently and there was nothing \"mango\" about them as the description claimed - just 5 dried up pieces of bland chicken with a very odd \"peanut sauce\" which tasted way to much like plain peanut butter. I've had other experiences like this and have friends who have told me the same thing. I enjoy coming here because there are not a ton of local, non-chain restaurants in Sun Prairie, and I really do enjoy the atmosphere. I just wish the food was more consistent. Overall though, I would recommend this place to someone looking for a meal in SP."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with our trip to Buck & Honey's tonight. Service was poor - I had to stop our server to say we wanted to order drinks before he ran off. We ordered the calamari and it was over cooked and sort of burned crispy tasting. My daughter had the chicken Parmesan. The chicken was thin and soggy and she gave up after a few bites. I tasted it and would not have known it was chicken it was so bad. My wife's pan fried tilapia was also very thin and soggy. My seafood gnocchi was good although we got into a discussion about the fact that it's listed as an entree that gets two sides, but I was told when I ordered it that its so large it doesn't need sides. I deferred at first to the server, but then thought that for the price, I should get my sides. I was then told it was a typo and that that entree doesn't come with sides and that the size of it would make it obvious that it doesn't need sides. The server did say he'd honor the menu and bring sides at no additional cost. I'm glad they did because the serving of gnocchi was not that big. On top of that, we got a wrong side with my wife's meal, which they corrected. My daughter ordered a lemonade that she never hit that I had to ask to remove from our bill. The server never asked if we wanted another drink, and didn't think it was strange enough that we had full plates left to take away. He didn't offer boxes either or ask about desserts. I had the impression they just wanted us to eat and get going. It's a Thursday night and not terribly busy. Very disappointed. I will likely never return to Buck & Honey's because there are better options that are far less expensive."}
{"text":"Great place to eat and great live music!  Good family environment as well!!"}
{"text":"The food was very good. I had the prime rib sandwich and it was wonderful. The fries were ok. My son's mac and cheese was really good too. The service was pretty poor. The waitress didn't seem to care we were there. I'd give the food and place 4 stars and the service 2."}
{"text":"Excellent cod fish fry! The cheesey hashbrowns and coleslaw was yummy as well.
Quick service. Friendly staff. Fun atmosphere. Definitely one of my favorite Friday fish frys in Madison."}
{"text":"We had reservations for Friday night. We were seated right away. I had the catch of the day-salmon,green beans and cheesy potatoes.Salmon was overdone,only about 6oz and green beans were almost raw. I was very disappointed in quality and price $27 for the salmon. My wife had the fish fry which was good but not outstanding$14.the service was very good. I would not go back as there are so many other better restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"We have been here quite a few times for lunch and dinner on the weekends.  Food has always been terrific and their Friday fish fry is worth the trip, but we have had very hit or miss service."}
{"text":"Just had a really good dining experience at Buck & Honeys. Found it on Yelp when we were in the area, so thank you other Yelp reviewers. From the drinks, I had the Canadian Mule, to the appetizers- you've got to try have the B & H sampler- yum, to our main course, everything was delicious and we'll prepared. Our server was perfectly attentive without being annoying.  The owner stopped by to see how everything was. We will be back."}
{"text":"Food is good and the best fried cheese curds ever!"}
{"text":"This is a new place that takes over the building that was Beef O Brady's.  Fortunately, the only thing this place has in common with that dump (see review: http://www.yelp.com/biz/beef-o-bradys-sun-prairie#hrid:PWUMDnYBBVl_yj6oIV-V-Q/src:self) is the address.

Buck & Honey's is your standard American fare, but with a little zest.
The menu isn't huge, but offers your standard steaks, pasta, pizza, burgers, salads, soups, fish, etc.  I was told by the waitstaff that all the food was \"made from scratch\" and most of their stuff was local.

I had the Bomber's Special pizza (pictured) and it was fantastic.  It's your normal Wisconsin style flat thin crust pizza.  I don't understand the appeal to this style of pizza over normal pizza cut into triangles, but maybe that's just my NYC brain.  Either way, it was great.  People say that Anna's pizza in Sun Prairie is good.. this made Anna's taste like one of those Red Baron pizzas.  The pie was large, the cheese and veggies tasted fresh, and the pizza itself had a bit of heat to it which kept the flavor on your tongue long enough that you never lost the taste in between bites.

The decor is a bit fancy, but soft and inviting.  The staff seemed friendly and welcoming.

Seems like a big focus on local; the artwork on display features Georgia O'Keefe as well as other Sun Prairie history.  The owners are an old couple from the city.  In fact, Buck once owned farm land in the exact spot that his restaurant is located.

The redesign from Beef O Brady's is well improved as well.  They actually have an entrance and you dont have to go through the stupid little mall to get in.  They have turned that old entrance area into a patio style atrium (see pic) for dining.  

Lots of local beer on tap, some TVs in the bar area, and a little stage area for live music make it a great place to spend an evening.

It's in a bit of a weird location, so I hope they do well.
Can't wait to get back and try the crazy good looking dessert menu."}
{"text":"Just wasted $60.00!  I love fish tacos,  and I always try them when I am at a restaurant for the first time. Usually I'm happy with the quality and variety of flavors.   Not tonight! In fact, the fish tacos I had at Buck and Honey's were perhaps the worst I've ever had! They were over cooked, dry and unimaginative, but mostly overcooked!   Even an over abundance of the blas√© sauce couldn't help these puppies go down. To add insult to injury,  the waitress didn't even take them off the bill, so I had the pleasure of paying good money for a bad meal.   Don't think I'll be going back."}
{"text":"They have a modern take on fish fry. I was pleasantly surprised.  They vegetable didn't have much flavor.  But the fish was very tasty.  I'd try the regular fish fry if I went back on a Friday."}
{"text":"A superb menu selection. A casual atmosphere but a tad pricey. My selection were served promptly, and we're quite flavorful. Service was on par, so I wasn't disappointed. Had a really nice dinner overall."}
{"text":"Very hit or miss for me. The food is usually okay but the atmosphere and wait staff is what turns me off the most about this place. Its always jam pack! The tables are so close together and service is soooooo slow. The food is average but pricey for what it is."}
{"text":"We decided to try Buck & Honey's this past Saturday night. We got to the restaurant at about 7:30pm and were told it was a 30 minute wait. We agreed to wait and headed over to the bar. We ended up heading back over towards the door to sit and wait because there wasn't enough room at the bar - even to stand. We were in the way no matter where we were. After waiting about 45 minutes we were seated directly behind the band. The music was nice but we were very obviously there for a nice dinner as a couple and we couldn't even hear each other talk. 

The  large group already seated next to us was extremely loud, inconsiderate and drunk. An employee often went over to their table to visit and take more drink orders which led me to believe they were frequent guests but their tone and behavior was ignored. Out waitress was okay but she ignored the fact that we were obviously not comfortable in our environment at all. After having waited 45 minutes for a table, I was not about ask to be seated elsewhere because I was starving. 

We ordered cheese curds for an appetizer and also each ordered a steak - cooked medium. The cheese curds came out about 5 minutes after our entr√©es but they were very good - I wish there were more for the cost though. The steak was charred on the outside and completely red and uncooked on the inside. It was seasoned well and the sides were tasty but the steak was disappointing and I was pretty sure I would be sick the next day. 

I was most upset about the fact that all of this cost me around $70. I've heard such great things but have to disagree. I am very hesitant to give it another try but maybe on a quiet weeknight it could be better.."}
{"text":"What a great place.  Excellent service. Food is well prepared and generous portions.  Cocktails are always good.  Yes, it is a bit of a drive from Madison, but well worth it.  We will be back again and again."}
{"text":"We came here on a Saturday night and were nervous when we saw a live band setting up (the last few times we've been anywhere with live music it is always ungodly loud). They were doing restaurant week specials and my husband got the New York strip with bleu cheese, which was good. And the wine they recommended with it was a wonderful suggestion. I had the prime rib which was excellent for the price. Our food was served quickly, very quickly actually. Our server (Ryan) was excellent and we never went without water and plates were cleared away quickly. He also was quick to point out specials and it was $1 off glasses of wine when we were there. 

The atmosphere is nice, if not a bit eclectic. There's live music, but televisions are showing sports, but it's also romantically lit with wine pictures on the wall. It's loud but not so loud you can't hear the people at your table. In short, a nice place for a date night. We'll be back."}
{"text":"My friend Meg and I have been out here on a number of occasions.  We thinks it's the best fish fry in the Madison-area.  Tasty brandy-old fashioned sweets, fantastic batter on the cod, tasty cole slaw (although I don't really like cole-slaw).  Most notable are their cheesy hash browns which are the most delicious of all."}
{"text":"Buck & Honey's is one of the most consistently \"good\" restaurants I've ever been to. For those who are coming for a once-only time, you can count on a good meal and great service. For those who have been back time and time again, you know that the atmosphere and service make this a great spot to return to time and time again. 

Just knowing that they have a donation pizza every week ($1 proceeds going to a charity) and a Life Balance Menu (calorie/fat conscious menu) should let you know how much they care about their guests and community.

There is little I'd tell someone not to get... with lots of familiar, tasty items and more adventurous things that are also worth checking out. 

GO THERE."}
{"text":"In town looking for lunch saw the reviews on yelp.  Had the buffalo chicken crispy salad excellent combination of flavors blended well   Also had pepperoni,salami turkey sandwich crispy chewy bun with a special dipping sauce again flavors blended well  funny thing waitress convinced to order the most awesome cheesy hash browns and the meal came with appeared to be regular hash browns. She went back to the kitchen to get an order and found out they were out of the ingredients.  Now we have to come back. We think it was a setup."}
{"text":"Love, love, love B&H.  Food is delicious and beautifully presented without being pretentious.  At lunch I'm always torn between the ahi tuna salad and the berry scallop salad.  Dinner entrees are universally tasty.  Service is friendly and professional.  Plus, this non-chain restaurant is locally owned and a huge supporter of the local community.  You won't regret going to Buck & Honey's!"}
{"text":"First time going was last night for the fish fry. I don't do reviews but they deserved one. Food all around was delicious and we bragged about it to friends later on. Service was the best we've had in a long time and the drinks were strong. It's not the cheapest fish fry around, but very well might be the best. Highly recommend and will be repeat customers."}
{"text":"We have always been fans of B&H, love the atmosphere and food is always good although sometimes unpredictable.  We are vegetarians so often eat from the \"sides\" that are very good.  Last night I tried their new veggie centricity.  It was the best veggie dish ever! Absoultely delicious, unique combination of cauliflower, brussels sprouts (usually hate), slightly pureed cauliflower, and palenta. So good!  My partner had the side salad with a side of palenta and arrive as an entire meal, huge helping, wonderful!
Would love to see more veggie options like homeade veggie burger, Sammy you can do it!"}
{"text":"Friday night date night.
Fish fry.
Drinks.
Great ambiance and Bartender.

This is my second time here; we were in the mood for fish and decided to check out reviews and decided on B&H.  Once we entered, there was a bit of a wait (Friday night, no surprise there.)  The lady in front of us was all exasperated because her party had a 20 minute wait.  After she huffed off I greeted the hostess with a smile and said, \"There'll be just two (2) of us, we don't mind the wait and we'll be at the bar until you're ready for us.  The name is China, like the country.\"  In which she smiled and replied, \"I love you.\"  *chuckling*

I said \"hey, fellow service industry workers have to stick together; on and off the clock.\"

He saved me a seat at the bar and our Bartender's name was Kevin; my beau ordered the New Belgium Snapshot beer. I asked Kevin if he had any mint, he said not quite yet; next month for sure.  So I ordered a Hendrick's gin cocktail with muddled lemon and lime on the rocks topped with 7-Up.  He said, \"a woman who knows what she wants. Perfect.\"  

My beau ordered the Perch and I had the deep fried cod with the asparagus.  Awesome...

I will be back; hopefully it won't take another two (2) years.

You should go here.  Soon!"}
{"text":"I would say that this is easily the best place to go in in Sun Prairie.  We have been here about 6 times and it has consistently been good.  I have ordered steak, fried fish, entrees... it's all pretty good.  The kids meals are well portioned and the kids eat it.  They rotate their menu and the beer on tap - that makes repeat business worth while.  It can be pretty busy on a Friday night.  They have filled a need in town."}
{"text":"Stopped in for brunch on a breezy Sunday. Place was pretty full but we were seated right away by a very nice hostess. Waiter was pleasant, prompt, and knowledgeable. I had the eggs benedict, and while small, packed a good punch. One of those meals where you ate 'just enough' instead of being so full you couldn't move after. I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, local restaurant, owners are friendly, food is really great and fun too (sometimes they have unique and new items on the menu). Live music nights are fun. Always busy Thursday - Saturday so get there early or be patient in the bar. Crab cakes are delicious, for dinner: salmon or steak would be our favorite choices."}
{"text":"Keyword here: Firecracker Shrimp. For days. I mean, it is fantastic! The old fashioneds are pretty good too! I'd recommend giving this place a try. They have some creative seating arrangements and the food has always been good during my visits. We use their catering option for several corporate events as well."}
{"text":"Anyone who knows me knows that I looooove a good fish fry.  

Buck & Honey's serves up one of the best I've had. I ordered the cod and out came three good-sized pieces of fish. The batter was great: light, crispy and well-seasoned. Got cheesy hash for my side - thebomb.com. The fry also comes with a rye (?) roll and coleslaw. They were nothing to write home about, but fared far better than some other places. Beer selection was better than expected and the service was super attentive for a frantic Friday night

This place gets packed on Friday, so make a reservation or expect to wait at least 30 minutes. Despite the huuuuge space, you probably won't find a seat at the bar while you wait. I promise you, it's worth it. 

Sun Prairie wins again."}
{"text":"Darn good brunch, though wasn't expecting to spend as much. Maybe prices were jacked for Mother's Day. Whatever the price, I'm still tempted to come back for cheese curds and fish fry."}
{"text":"I want to give this place 4 stars and hope that someday I will! Our first experience was only decent but I did see more potential. First of all, I really did like the space. We were seated quickly in the room behind the bar, which was very dim. There was a live band playing and they created a warm, lively ambiance without being too loud. Onto the food.. we started with the sampler appetizer plate, as we couldn't decide between the firecracker shrimp and the stuffed dates. Both of these dishes were very tasty, I especially loved the dates! This plate also came with cheese curds and marinara sauce, which were fine. The marinara was a mystery at first, as the dim lighting really changes the color appearance of your food. Kind of trippy!! For our mains, my husband had the meatloaf and I had fish tacos with brussels sprouts. The meatloaf itself was the standout. It's extremely tasty and is served on a bed of yummy mashed potatoes. He ordered sweet potato fries as his side and while they were fine they definitely needed salt. My fish tacos were okay, but the tilapia did not seem to have any seasoning on it at all. The brussels sprouts were the biggest problem.. they were soooo oily and greasy. With each bite I got a mouthful of extra oil, which made them difficult to eat and impossible to really enjoy. We'll be back in the summer to enjoy the outdoor patio (looks like a great place to sip a cocktail) and hopefully the food will impress us a little more!"}
{"text":"Friday night fish Fri good. Cole slaw good. Husband hadsteak, ok.  Cheesy hashbrown fabulous"}
{"text":"A couple close friends were in town and we decided to try this place out. We got sassy cow cheese curds to share and it was def one of the best I had. Very stringing, right amt if grease and loving that texture. I don't even need any dipping sauce to go with it. I had the lands and sea which consisted of a 5oz filet and 3 scallops with mash and daily vegetable. I thought the filet was on the salty side and the medium looked more like well done.. Little disappointed until I tried the scallops which was surprisingly phenomenal! Super well seasoned to bring out the taste. It's tough to cook scallops since they are pretty bland. The sides are alright..nothing spectacular. I also had a strawberry mojito which was pretty yummy. My highlight of the meal was definitely the curds and the scallops. 

So why is this a 3 star? We were there on a Friday night and the band was playing.. Do they have live music every weekend? They might want to do a little better search next time when it comes to live music. The band that was playing was just terrible! Songs were out of tune and the lead singer was basically yelling his lungs out. Like a couple other ppl mentioned.. The service needs a little work. Our waiter basically asked whether we were done while my friend was still chowing down her food.. After we said that we are still working it, he followed to give us our check 5 minutes later. It was 9pm and after the dinner rush...so that was a downer."}
{"text":"I go here whenever I visit home from college. I have never had anything that I didn't enjoy from the menu. Staff is attentive and friendly, and our wait times are never long. The staff also has good knowledge of the menu which comes in handy when trying something new. Our family enjoys the food so much that we are having them cater my parents wedding."}
{"text":"Went to Buck and Honeys after hearing they won an award for best cheese curds in that Madison area. I will say the cheese curds were good, yet over priced. ($9 for 6 curds).  I order the chipotle burger. \"Medium\" burger was cooked well done (a bit dry for my taste). Homemade fries were good, but they were cold by the time they were brought to the table. Waiter was slow and we had to ask another person to get beverage refills. (Restaurant was not busy, just a handful of people around). Probably wont return - too over priced for the quality."}
{"text":"We are regulars...coming here at least once a month.  Why you ask?   Because Buck & Honey's is:
- Casual elegance
- Exceptional food made by a real chef...not just the \"run of the mill\" options
- Extended menu to include healthy choices
- Live music entertainment inside plus an outdoor dining area with its own music in the summer.
Sun Prairie needs more establishments like this!!"}
{"text":"Went to Buck and Honeys on a Saturday evening about five, had no problem getting a booth right away. It soon got very busy. We got a couple cocktail's, a tasty margarita and my favorite lemon drop martini. The food was to DIE FOR!!. Saturday night Prime rib special was juicy and we'll seasoned with garlic mashed potatoes and grilled asparagus. Sirloin steak was also very good. There was quick service with no problems. Will return soon!"}
{"text":"I have been to Buck & Honeys soooo many times. I can easily say, this is one of Sun Prairie's best restaurants. My parents live in the town, and we frequent here. Last night, they seemed to be understaffed for the day after Christmas. Our server was very friendly, but slow. We felt somewhat ignored, but this is not the typical experience here. My family shared the large Bomber Special pizza. The menu says it's only 14' but that is deceiving because it is very large/filling for that size. They have great pizza! There were five of us and we shared two apps (firecracker shrimp and sassy curds) along with the pizza, and we were all full/satisfied. I would also recommend these appetizers. Another thing i would suggest, is to try to avoid being seated on the right side of the restaurant that opens up to the other commercial space in this building. It can get quite drafty...many of us were sitting in our winter jackets. I don't think this is something the restaurant can control, but has happened to me twice there and it can be uncomfortable."}
{"text":"We are regulars and absolutely love it. The food is great. The atmosphere is comfortable and fun. The staff is top notch. We love the fish fry on Friday and the prime rib on Saturday. Brunch is pretty awesome too. My book club meets there monthly. We even had my daughter's 5th birthday party there. It was awesome. The kids ate pizza which was really great. They decorated cookies and had a blast. I really cannot say enough good things about this place. Fish tacos are great, steak is great, dessert is great and even has gluten free amazingly good options. Wine list is extensive and reasonable. They love to support local  business. But really a huge testimont to their success in my opinion is that their staff retention rate is amazing. We have been going there since they opened and still see a ton of familiar faces and better yet the staff cares about the customers and learns their names and preferences. We will be regulars as long as they have their doors open. We love it. Bonus points for my kids seeing Santa."}
{"text":"We've been to this establishment numerous times and the food and service are both consistently good (not great, but good). Love the creme br√ªl√©e and the filet mignon steak!"}
{"text":"We finally tried this Best of Madison establishment. Was early on a Saturday night when we were in Sun Prairie and decided to stop in. Prime Rib night, and though there were some really delicious looking things on the menu, the waitress recommended the Prime Rib. We both ordered ours medium. Jack ordered the French Onion soup to start. Wow, what a nice start. That alone may have been best ever! We also both chose the garlic mashed and the house veggie - corn, to accompany our entree, and good choice it was. Our prime ribs came out and the first bites were simple amazing. So many prime ribs taste like, well, meat. Theirs is seasoned to perfection, which is key. The manager visited just after those first bites and he noticed Jack's cut was overcooked for medium and said he'd replace it, that this was not acceptable. Jack didn't want to see it go back so turned him down. The manager took a percentage off the bill as an apology!
So, here comes the awards:
Best prime rib ever.
Best French onion soup ever.
Outstanding staff, knew their menu in depth

Key point - the manager knew exactly what we ordered when he visited us. He obviously checked before he stopped by. That is amazing service, going that extra step. Bravo. We will be back."}
{"text":"Great food!
Great people!
Good place for lunch. Love the Firecracker Shrimp tacos. Excellent fish fry.
If you get a chance to attend a beer or wine tasting, go for it. Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"I've been visiting B&Hs since its opening and have watched as prices have crept up and quality has gone down. Last week I was there with 5 friends; we began by sitting outside to enjoy the early evening, only to be driven inside by the crazy loud musician playing on the patio. Not even remotely possible to have a conversation. After ordering drinks and dinner, we waited literally 40+ minutes before we saw our food. Our drinks were also slow in coming. I had ordered the Ahi Tuna Salad, which historically I had loved (although it had been two years since I'd last had it--with a $2-3 price hike as well). When it finally arrived, I was instantly disappointed. The size of the salad was so small--it barely covered the bottom of the 'soup-style' bowl it was in! There were exactly 5 small, one inch square, flat pieces of rare ahi tuna placed on top. What a joke! $15 for THIS?!? I remember this salad being much larger with ahi tuna slices placed on top--not tiny little flat squares! The only reason B&H is doing moderately well is because it is the only decent sit down restaurant in Sun Prairie. Period. Skip this place and go to Salvatore's if you want good food made with care. B&Hs just doesn't care."}
{"text":"Had a private function here - beautiful space and the staff was attentive and friendly.  Not much here for vegan's and the kitchen didn't try to accommodate very well even though they had all the ingredients to make a great salad!"}
{"text":"Great service, really nice area, suburbs kind of area so not a lot of industrial noise or high traffic to worry about. The outdoor patio is spacious, has bags, fire ring and outdoor bar. Came here for drinks on a warm evening but would definitely come back for food"}
{"text":"The first time I tried to visit Buck & Honey's was in July. I came with my fiance an hour before the closing time listed on their website. We thought we'd get something light to eat on a weekend night. No such luck. The place was clearly in the process of closing and the kitchen had longsince closed.

This week, I returned hoping for a better experience. Heck, any experience! I went to Buck & Honey's with my mom for dinner. We were greeted by a very courteous hostess and our waitress was very smiley as she explained the myriad of specials. I had the potato soup and the tenderloin salad and my mother the tilapia with shrimp. Both were nice, but nothing to write home about. Our waitress, however, was nice enough, but very lacking in the ability to wait on a table. She was slow, never returned with things she said she was bringing, and left the appetizer dishes sitting on the table after 3 'check-in' visits. It was rather bizarre. 

In the end, it wasn't a bad meal. It was alright. We both enjoyed our food. But the service and the very noisy table neighbors, along with the rather high price, made us unsure if we'll give Buck & Honey's another shot."}
{"text":"Fish fry reminiscent of Culver's cod. Three decent sized pieces were heavy on the breading and the grease. Served with a rich and fatty glop of cheesy hash browns and a coleslaw swimming in mayo. The roll that came with the meal was quite good: warm and fresh-tasting.  If I do go back I will try something else.  Did not enjoy the ambiance of the indoor \"patio\" area, which was open to a mall hallway."}
{"text":"Let's start with the ambiance at Buck and Honey's. It's beautiful. Both inside and out. Indoors is modern, bright, wooden, airy. The restrooms are clean and smell fresh. The outdoor patio is filled w/flowers, plenty of tables with both gazebo and umbrella options for shade. It's a welcoming space.

As far as the service goes, it's a little more mixed. The hostess was friendly, seated us immediately, and brought us waters and menus. Then we waited. We waited to the point when we were just about to get someone or leave, when the waiter finally came over. From that point on, he was back regularly to refill beverages and check on us and I have no complaints. But it was odd, after we had ordered, a waitress came by to take our order. It seems like there is some confusion about who is working which tables.

Moving on to the food. Salads, sandwiches, appetizers. Fairly standard, but with some interesting twists which sounded good. For example bacon-wrapped curds. I ordered the TA's hot comby which includes ham, salami and pepperoni, green pepper, onion, mozzarella and sauce on a toasted hoagie. It was tasty but the green pepper and onion would have been much better if they had been sauteed longer and allowed to caramelize. (They were hot but needed cooked more). Also it was just dripping w/sauce. I think the sauce was a variation of Italian dressing and it was tasty but way too much. They even included an extra side of sauce, so I'm guessing some people must really like it that way. My companion had the smoked salmon super wrap which he did enjoy. It included lots of veggies. We both ordered the sweet potato fries. Overall, the portion sizes seemed a mite minuscule for the prices.

I'd go there if you are looking for great atmosphere, but I just wasn't wowed by the service or food."}
{"text":"Tried the restaurant week menu.  I had a taste of the Ahi appetizer (coming back for the full thing later), steak Gorgonzola pasta, and my hubby had the BBQ chicken and ribs.  The mashed taters and corn were also tasty.  Not a bad taste in the bunch and the meats were all done properly...no over or under-cooking."}
{"text":"I have never had a bad experience or meal here. Food is excellent and the service is great. Never had to wait long to sit down. This is a go to restaurant for me and my husband or when company is in town."}
{"text":"Bartender was fantastic only problem was value of my meal. $15 for a slice of lasagna is way over priced.  Some garlic bread would have been nice.  Very good beer selection."}
{"text":"My first time at B&H and it was a solid brunch spot in SP. The decor is festive and Christmassy without being overwhelming. I had the Dutch Baby with strawberries and whipped cream with sausage. The whipped cream wasn't my favorite, but there wasn't too much and it was easy to remove. Strawberries were fresh and the Dutch Baby hot and delicious. The sausage was also good. My mom had the Eggs Benedict with cheesy hash browns and very much enjoyed her meal. I tried the hash browns and oh lord, yesssssss. Get them with the cheese. Just do it. 
Bloody Mary was solid. Nothing stellar, but not in any way disappointing. Served with a pickle spear and two olives. 
Very friendly staff and excellent service. 
4 stars bc I only give 5 when I'm totally blown away."}
{"text":"This place isn't too bad. We were seated promptly even though our reservations didn't go through electronically. Service overall was average to good. They forgot to give us utensils so we ate our appetizers--firecracker shrimp and bacon wrapped cheese curds--with the toothpicks that was used to skewer the curds. Not a deal breaker. 

My wife really liked her shrimp scampi pasta. There was a lot of shrimp and she seemed to enjoy the flavor. I had the stuffed chicken breast with a side of broccoli. They mistakenly gave me asparagus at first, which actually turned out to be too chewy or too limp. The broccoli tasted great. The chicken breast itself wasn't bad, but not amazing. It was a decent dinner. I was hoping they would have burgers on the menu, but it looks like it was only available on the brunch menu. Maybe we'll come back here some time and try that."}
{"text":"We love dining here and our son loves live music nights.  We wanted to take advantage of their date night special and made a reservation for Thursday night after confirming with the restaurant that it was on Thursday.

I called the restaurant about 45 minutes before our reservation to see if they could accommodate us a little earlier since we had gotten our kids ready to go in record time.  Matt (Restaurant Manager) answered the phone and I am glad he did because he made the effort to confirm with me that we were interested in the date night special.  I panicked for about 10 seconds, but he made a quick judgement call and guaranteed that we would be true advocates (more so than we already were!) for Buck and Honey's.

We arrived and were taken to our table within minutes which was exactly what we needed, both Matt and his boss came by to make sure everything was to our satisfaction and offered assistance if we needed anything that night.  Truly exemplary service all around and was continued by Carrin, our server.  She had a great connection with our two children and made sure we weren't left wanting for anything.

We chose to forgo the usual Date Night wine list and opted for a bottle of the Chateau Ste. Michelle Reisling, which my fiance enjoyed more than me and I ordered a Barenjager Lemonade.  She ordered the Stuffed Chicken Breast and I chose the Pot Roast.  Both made perfectly and very satisfying.

When it came time to pay the bill, I had no qualms about tipping heavily and we look forward to visiting again soon!"}
{"text":"Ordered food for pick up and it was delicious! The food was well packaged and still warm when we arrived home. I would definitely order from here again!"}
{"text":"Everyone we know raves about Buck and Honeys.....Boys wanted Burgers so off we went as supposedly they had good burgers....

We must have been there on an off night.   Comment on the waitress as she was sadly unhelpful.....seemed put off that we got put in her section.  Tried to steer us toward the $26.00/ea entree special.... tho we were clear about wanting burgers....

Ordered the following...
BRUNCH Burger with cheddar medium rare.
Reg Burger Medium. 
Mushroom and Swiss Medium Rare.  

What we got...our types of burger BUT...
Blackened well charred well done, well done, well done and the thinnest burgers we've eaten.  

We added tons of ketchup to make it palatable...and most of us left burger on our plates....she asked how it was... I said, not good.  She didnt blink an eye and walked to next table.

We won't be back.  DOTTYS gets our vote EVERY time.  Wasted mula ....sad."}
{"text":"Came here today for lunch with some family. Be sure to make reservations. The service was slow considering it was not very busy late in the afternoon. There was very little staff around to assist us. Salads were okay. Entrees we're good, not anything special. Smells very weird inside the restaurant so I recommend eating outside. Also, there are very few booths so you will likely be sitting at a crowded table. Nothing special."}
{"text":"Went last night. Got the buffalo chicken wings for appetizer. Each of us got the fish fry with cheesy hash browns and cold slaw. Like every visit, I get an additional side of the Mac n cheese because it is that good. Bustling patio and live entertainment."}
{"text":"One of my go-to's for a sit down meal in Sun Prairie. Clean, warm interior and generally speedy and friendly service. Food is always satisfactory. Also features a great lunch menu that is available to-go."}
{"text":"Service is always excellent here.  The appetizers and food are delishious.  The mac n cheese pizza is quite tasty! I highly recommend this place for brunch, dinner or even just for a cocktail.  Sometimes they have live music.  And the outdoor patio is excellent with tables, heaters and a firepit.."}
{"text":"Stopped for lunch with my mom, and it's a quaint place but great atmosphere. I tried the Wisco, which is a gourmet mac & cheese pizza. It was delicious! My mom had a tasty looking pulled pork sandwich. Super friendly staff and clean restrooms. I will be back!"}
{"text":"I tried this restaurant during Madison Restaurant Week. Fairly tasty food and a nice atmosphere, although my entree portion was a big disappointment. 

I ordered the house salad, scallops/sea bass, and bread pudding from the Restaurant Week menu. Salad and bread pudding were tasty and well-portioned, and my scallop/bass dish was also tasty. I felt slighted, though, receiving a plate with two scallops, a tiny slice of sea bass that was the same size as the scallops, a scoop of risotto and some broccolini. 

Was my entree supposed to be a sample platter? I ate all of the protein in six bites. I can get the same quantity of seafood at Taste of Madison for less than $10. I paid $30 at Buck & Honey's.

I don't think I will return to Buck & Honey's, but I guess that's what Restaurant Week is for: try new restaurants to find which ones you like and don't like."}
{"text":"Ate here with a large group. The service was terrific and very accommodating. Friendly atmosphere and it felt like they were really happy to see us. The food was excellent. I had the walleye and it was terrific. My cousin had a pasta dish and she was very pleased as well. There wasn't one complaint among us."}
{"text":"This restaurant was recommended to us through friends and has a great reputation. We are new residents of Sun Prairie and have been searching for a good fish fry in this town. Due to popularity we arrived at an early dining hour for us - 5 pm. Good thing because within 20 minutes I overheard the hostess informing people it would be a 45 minute wait for a table. We enjoyed prompt service. Ordered draft beers, which were under $5 each. We ordered the broiled cod fish fry special, which comes with cole slaw and cheesy hash browns. The food was good, but not so amazing that I am willing to fight a crowd for it. We were seated at a high table near the hostess station, which was entertaining. While our server assured us \"no rush\" in finishing our drinks or paying the bill, the hostess was informing a party of 4 \"that is your table is soon as they leave\". We were rushed out. We will come back some time when it is a bit more low key. I don't understand 1) why people carryout from here - this is expensive takeout food, and 2) why people bring small children here - they would be very bored and out of place.

If you are coming here on a Friday or Saturday night, have a reservation or pack your patience for a long wait time.

We continue our search for our \"every week\" place in Sun Prairie. This isn't it."}
{"text":"The food gets a B + the service gets an A-. The beer was perfectly chilled, the martinis were excellent. Yes, I'd recommend this place. Very nice menu selection. Everyone in my group enjoyed the evening. By the way the music was good as well."}
{"text":"Save your money and go somewhere else. The customer service is horrible and the food matches it.  I ordered the ribs and I had to cut the meat off of the bone, the potatoes were cold too.   Not to mention the wait to get a drink was very long. If they change owners and management I MIGHT be back."}
{"text":"The main courses are expensive and that is usually what I am disappointed by. I have had good apps like the fried cheese curds and their side dishes and soups are good. The pasta, salads, and meat dishes I have got have not been very good. 

If you go, order the Firecracker Shrimp pizza. Delicious!"}
{"text":"We have been trying to get to this place for the past year or so after hearing everyone rave about it.  So finally on a Monday... not a tuesday...  a little joke for you younger readers...  we got here!  Let me tell you it was worth the wait.   The staff was knowledgeable and friendly when it came to answering questions about the place and reccomendations on thier menu.  
Great drinks and beer selection for you beer snobs.  Lots of wine choices for the ladies to choose from as well.  Nice big place that was very clean.  Nice ambiance.   And now for the main event what we are all waiting to hear about.   Drum roll please....  FOOD

The food was excellent.   We went with a group of 6 and everyone was impressed.  I had the 14 oz Ribeye cooked perfectly.  The Mrs. had Chicken Parmesan which our talented waitress recommended.   Kudos for that, tip just went up.  Ribs were killer and on and on.   Did I forget to mention desert.  Oh my.

Just go try for yourself and you'll see what everyone and now myself is talking about.  Well done B&H keep up the great work.  Nice to have a place like that in the area."}
{"text":"We went there for the first time this morning. The service was slow and confused.The music started and the seven people at our table had trouble hearing conversation. The food was overcooked,small in portion or cold. The only thing right about our eggs benedict (3 orders) was the eggs were cooked properly. The muffins were hard as a rock.The ham was wafer thin. The hash browns retained the rectangular shape when frozen and were tasteless. The two orders of asparagus were overcooked,mushy and cold."}
{"text":"Terrible food - drinks were too strong. We should have gone into Madison for the price."}
{"text":"The food was good, but our waiter was angry for some reason. It could have been because my in-laws (older) and 3 kids were with us. I promise you we are great tippers for that very reason, but he would not give us the tome of day. I Asked for a dinner roll to keep the baby happy and got some packaged crackers thown on the table. This is the 2nd time we have had questionable service here. Not sure when our next visit will be."}
{"text":"Food here is tasty if not on the high side price wise.  I had the Ribeye Steak and it was cooked perfect and they even had roasted Brussel sprouts on the menu!  Yum.  My friend had the scallops and berries salad and it was AWESOME looking and he said it was tasty to boot.  We had a locally brewed IPA and there was even live music (three guys playing ukuleles)  We sat outside as the weather was perfect.  Nice experience, would go back in a heart beat.  Service was top notch as well"}
{"text":"Buck and Honey's was recommended more to us, after moving to the Sun Prairie area, then anywhere else. I first ventured there for a \"girls night out\". We ordered half price martinis, I think it was a Thursday night. I enjoyed mine - the perfect margarita - salted rim, and wow did it pack a punch. We also ordered off of the \"balanced life\" menu. I had the salmon roulades. They were simple and tasty. I would order them again. My friend ordered the chicken skewers. Also tasty, and spicy, which was a good thing. We sat outside on the outdoor patio, the atmosphere was fantastic, comfy outdoor furniture, live music, great lighting. I enjoyed the atmosphere so much on my next date night with my hubby I insisted we check it out. 

It rained.

But, we were able to sit in the Georgia O'Keffe patio, and learn that G.O is from Sun Prairie! Who knew. Apparently, a lot of people, according to Facebook. 

I ordered the Salmon off of the \"balance menu\" it, again, was simple but good. My husband ordered lasagna. Full disclosure, his was better. :) It was meaty and spicy, and had a cream sauce alongside the red sauce that just made the dish. 

Overall, a great place to eat. Worth the recommendations."}
{"text":"Fish was good here. The bartender was a tad uptight though... I'd say for the price it's a great deal. As others mentioned, the fish is fantastic! Plenty of beers on tap. 

Buck & Honey's 5 Stars!"}
{"text":"We took the Friday to run errands and decided to stop by for some lunch.  We were in the mood for a couple drinks and fish fry... and this place delivers in a big way.  It has been some time since our last trip to Buck & Honey's, but this was a welcome return.  

We asked to be seated in the bar and ordered a couple Blood Marys.  The bartender obviously knows his craft as the drinks were very well-made.  We began with an order of cheese curds that could very well be some of the best I have ever had.  They were a perfect balance of crispy and gooey, coming from the local Sassy Cow Creamery.  We then shared a cup of New England Clam Chowder that was amazing.  It was not too thick and had just the right amount of seafood flavor with a great finish on the palate.  We had both ordered the fish fry on special, my wife had the fries and coleslaw while I went with the cheesy hashbrowns (on a recommendation from the bartender) with coleslaw.  We also ordered another round of drinks.  She went with the Wisco Mule (their rendition of a Moscow Mule) and I had a glass of Shiner Bock that was on tap.  

Everything was great, right down to the coleslaw which was not too thin and not too tangy.  The cheesy hashbrowns were perfect for the doldrums of winter.  I would recommend them to anyone.  And, finally, the fish.. the fish was the star.  Actually, this was some of the best fish fry I have ever had, and that is no exaggeration.  Fried to perfection, the batter is light and crispy, delivering heavy on flavor yet tender and flaky.  And not greasy at all.  

If I absolutely had to complain about anything, the fries weren't very crispy and lunch was a bit pricey.  But the quality of the experience is worth the cost.  We will definitely be back the next time we are in the area."}
{"text":"Decided to give Buck & Honey's another shot, and this time I was actually really happy with the experience. 

First of all, the restaurant is all decked out for Christmas,  with ornaments hanging from the ceiling. The effect is really inviting and charming.

This time, in contrast to previous visits, we lucked out with both a great appetizer and drinks. The Ahi App really stood out: it was creative, appealing to look at, and well-prepared. 

For drinks, I couldn't resist the Naughty Gummy Bear, which is garnished with boozy gummy bears. It's fun, legitimately tastes like candy, and why not?

The entrees were decent, but not amazing. I had the grilled romaine and tenderloin salad, which is kind of a giant deconstructed \"salad.\" It is an interesting concept, but ultimately a little clumsy. My companion ordered the Tour of Italy, which he described also as not bad, not great, but just fine.

Overall, that pretty much sums up the latest meal at B&H: just fine. One good experience doesn't quite outbalance 4 earlier poor experiences. However, this visit was a great improvement, and I am actually looking forward to coming back."}
{"text":"IMHO this is The best restaurant in Sun Prairie. We go here several times a month for lunch & dinner. Great staff, great food, great atmosphere. I love the light menu fish tacos and smashed cauliflower.  The creme br√ªl√©e is really good. Treat yourself and stop in."}
{"text":"This was one of those places I had been to once (over a year ago) and had kind of written it off because I can't even remember what I had and wasn't that impressed.  BUT, I was back last night with my team from work and we had made a reservation in the Bird Room (fyi comfortably sat 8 of us, $300 food/drink minimum to use).  My opinion of this place has now changed since my last visit.  After enjoying some of their delish cheese curds (not the best in town, but good!) and even better some Firecracker Shrimp, I ordered off their handy \"Life Balance\" menu and got the Chicken Gardiniera Medley dish with a side of their brussels sprouts.  Wow, I was expecting a bit bland (especially being a healthy dish) but thought quite the opposite!  The quantity was small; however the flavors were great and I LOVED the mashed cauliflower base.  The brussels sprouts were also very memorable and would highly recommend them.  My one negative of this dish would be the chicken which came served in bits (and there wasn't a lot of it) rather than nicely presented strips or something.  Ok so then there was the FLOURLESS CHOCOLATE CAKE.  For just $6 it was giant (and no shame I ate it all myself...a reward for the healthy entree, ha!) and definitely one of the most memorable desserts I've ever ordered.  Melt in your mouth and creamy - pure deliciousness.  Of course I had to take a pic of it.  After this 2nd visit to Buck and Honey's, I'd say I'd come back for sure!"}
{"text":"Went for a colleague's work anniversary with seven other people. First kuddo is THANK YOU for taking a reservation and having the table all ready for us.

The lunch menu is thankfully manageable - two pages with about a third appetizers and salads, a third sandwiches and a third entrees. It's nice to have a good selection but not overwhelming. 

The next thing I noticed is that they have some really interesting items. The bacon-wrapped dates are, as you can imagine, amazing. Thankfully they have an appetizer sampler so we didn't have to choose. 

My friend and I decided to split our meals to try two things. I ordered two fish tacos. They were as tasty as I've had, served in a nice taco stand with just enough sauce to make them decadent but not impossible to eat. The salmon wrap came cut in half (easy to split). It sounded really interesting on the menu, and while tasty, it reads better than it tastes; there's kind of a lot going on there and then they added the kitchen sink.

Service was pleasant and thoughtful and not overwhelming. I'd definitely return to try some more of those appetizers; I can imagine a plate of one or two as a meal."}
{"text":"Just no. I've been there once, we had reservations for a birthday. There was a menu already preselected which was fine but for the price it was a rip off
The only reason they are getting two stars is because I enjoyed the pear martini they have."}
{"text":"Great food and great service will keep you coming back to buck and honeys! 

They have a good drink selection and their food has always been wonderful. Fish fry on Friday night is the best in Sun prairie. Highly recommend giving this place a try."}
{"text":"We had an engagement party for my dearest son at The Barrel Room at Buck & Honeys this past Sunday. The food was great and the service was top notch. I wanted to make our traditional samosas and Chris Franks, one of the owners, very kindly offered a space in their very own kitchen for us to make them the day before the party. It worked out wonderfully. Samosas are one of the traditional appetizers in Pakistan and a  family favorite. I really wanted to incorporate a bit of tradition at this very important event of our lives. Thanks Chris and Tom for the beautiful event and appreciation for the culture! I couldn't imagine a better spot then The Barrel Room to hold this event!"}
{"text":"I've always wanted to try this place and I'm glad I did. It was a fairly busy Friday night and our friends' reservations were screwed up, but surprisingly, we were able to be seated in about 10 minutes. 

We ordered the bacon wrapped cheese curds (yum!) and firecracker shrimp (spicy, somewhat flavorful) for appetizers. I made the game time decision to choose shrimp scampi vs steak and I'm glad I did. They did not skimp on my shrimp and they weren't wimpy looking either. Loved the garlic flavor in the dish and I wouldn't hesitate to pick that again. My husband ordered the stuffed chicken breast, which didn't look exciting to me but he enjoyed it. 

Their brunch menu looked appealing so we'll likely come back and try those selections."}
{"text":"We have been going to B&H since it first open.  We've never had a bad meal.  It's well priced too.  I wish they would keep their calamari on the menu all the time.  It's been on and off several times, and being my favorite dish, it's a disappointment when we go and it's been replaced.  I would also suggest they keep their sparkling water (San Pellegrino or Perrier) cold.  That's not the kind of water you want to dilute with ice.  But other than those two things, I would give it a 5th star."}
{"text":"Great spot for the cheese curds alone. They use Sassy Cow and it is easily the best, dare I say better than Old Fashioned?!  They have some competition out here in Sun Prairie. 

We went for brunch and I have three complaints: not much variety for brunch, and they don't sell fancy coffee. No latte with my brunch, only regular ol coffee. The waitress reported that the new Plate N Barrel opening next door will sell fancy coffee but they only open in the late afternoon. That doesn't make sense to me. Our waitress must have been new, her customer service was off. She served my mom a soda that had garnishes she doesn't like because she can't stand the taste of lemon with her soda. She asked for it specifically without lemon.  A good server would have given a brand new soda. This waitress just looked at her and said something to the effect of \"oh ok, you can just take the lemon off.\"  To the newbs, if you want to wow with service it's all about the little ways you can take care of people. She got a full tip, we're not asses and it wasn't a big deal, but it caught my attention and made this a three star instead of a four star review. 

So for brunch we had the following:

Sassy cow cheese curds
Eggs Benedict
Crab cake Benedict
Two eggs, toast, hash browns, fruit, and crab cakes
A salmon burger

Everyone enjoyed their meal, but those cheese curds did me in.  I would go back to Buck & Honey's by my own choice and if my parents ever want to go again I'm on board!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here a few times. Service is always excellent. Menu offers variety that does not disappoint."}
{"text":"We went here with friends who live in Sun Prairie about a month ago and I have been meaning to write this review but keep putting it off. The experience though was so poor I have not forgotten it.

Our waitress had a very heavy accent and was difficult to communicate with making ordering somewhat frustrating. She did not explain any menu items to us, such as what came with things we ordered or how they were prepared and the menu was pretty vague as well. When we did try to ask about menu items she had no knowledge of how something was prepared and we had to suggest to her to find out. 1 person in our group has some dietary restrictions. We explained that. She treated the info as if she didn't care. That either she did not understand or maybe it wasn't her problem. Maybe she thinks that if you can't just eat anything you shouldn't expect to be able to dine out. 

The food was just ok. 

2 people ordered meatloaf and both liked this dish enough but said it was a little bland.

We had 2 kids with our group. A kids meal came with a burger and the side of Mac and Cheese it came with was in a small ramekin the same size that was given for a side of bar-b-que sauce for the other kids meal of chicken nuggets, seriously!?

The person with dietary restrictions was able to order Tilapia but could not have the sides that were available and the 2 that could have been had were not available and sold out of. No offer to reduce the price of this meal was made and this person in our group paid full price for a meal that they didn't receive half of the menu description of. If a place cannot provide what they offer because they run out it should not be the guests fault and should not have been made to pay full price. This fish was salty and oily.

The second dish with fish that was ordered was ok but the fish is greasy like they used too much oil to cook it and was runny on the plate.

The bill came and 1 kids meal was charged at $1 higher than the other. When asking about this the waitress didn't have an answer just said that it was. We also were charged for the kids drinks which could have been included if the waitress would have explained what actually was included when we all ordered. We went to a manager to get an explanation of the $1 extra charge and he refunded the $1 to us. Yes it is just $1 but why? Still no explanation and nothing on their menu shows a difference between the 2 kids meals that were ordered from the same price section.

All around not a good experience, for a place with such good reviews and talk about a real chef I expected better than something I could have gotten at a chain like Denny's or something. I expected better treatment and better staff. I did not expect to be ripped off."}
{"text":"Everything here was just average. Average burgers and average pasta dishes. Nothing set them apart from a standard chain restaurant. The prices were fine and the waiter we has was great but this is the kind of place I won't really seek out to go again."}
{"text":"let's start by saying this is our 4th visit to the establishment and they always sit us in the corridor outside the main restaurant. We are celebrating  both Mother's Day and my 64th birthday, what a mistake by coming here. Sat down and immediately the waiter took both our drink and dinner order. It is all downhill after that. Linda's salad was brought out, still no drinks and they finally arrived when she finished the salad. In the meantime we notice other people arriving and being seated, also issues with the meal for the couple sitting next to us. We start to talk with them and find out of the poor service they have received, also about the extended wait for their desserts to arrive. We watch a couple of young ladies who arrived 20 minutes after we have receive their dinners and we are still waiting. Finally someone stops by our table and asks how we are doing and I say we have not received our meals and have already waited 45 minutes. He leaves to check and then our waiter, needs to find a different profession, stops by to say he forgot to put our dinner order in until after we had spoken to the other person. Then the manager comes over and apologizes for the mistake and says he will cut our bill by 50%, let me say it should have been FREE. The meal finally arrives more than an hour after we ordered and suffice to say mine still wasn't completely what I ordered and didn't get corrected until the manager stopped at the table again. I could not wait to get out of the place and have no intention of returning. My wife said to me as we walked out that it was her worst dining experience EVER. Happy Celebrations for us, not quite."}
{"text":"Went for a quick brunch. Food is great , fresh and beautiful looking . nice environment."}
{"text":"Awesomely horrible place definitely will never be back. Thank you for showing what a restaurant is not supposed to be. Went here on a Monday night after movie because it was one of the only places open on a Monday. We arrived at 8:40 and were promptly seated by the bartender who stated that the kitchen was still open (it was not). A few minutes later the waiter came out with our waters and informed us that we might be able to get a few apps but the kitchen was closed. I get it if your not busy you can't wait to get out of there. But if you don't want business don't have hrs till 10pm and maybe lock your doors so no one looking for a late dinner stops in. Won't ever be back thank you!"}
{"text":"I had been hearing great things about this restaurant, so I decided to try it out for Madison Restaurant Week. It was alright, I don't know if I would go back. The steak was good, the appetizers were alright & the wine was good... But when isn't it?"}
{"text":"Fri fish fry...mmm...ok.  Culver's is better and you can have it anytime you want!!!"}
{"text":"We were waiting to be seated and decided to grab a drink from the bar. We stood there for 15+ min without being acknowledged at all.. Once he finally looked at us - the bartender, Charlie, was abrupt and rude. Maybe it was an off night for him but he displayed ZERO customer service skills. And frankly, made us and others feel unwelcome at his bar. Our table took over 40 minutes to be ready, and the bar should be able to accommodate those waiting. 

I worked in the restaurant industry for more than 10 years and being busy is one thing, being rude is another.. Do not come here at dinner time on a Friday night."}
{"text":"One of my favorites. Outdoor dining and entertainment in summer is best on East Madison or Sun Prairie.  Constant menu changes my only frustration. Keep the scallop pasta on there and I'd be 5 star."}
{"text":"We went here for the first time last night.  The d√©cor/ambiance is very nice.  The two people up front, who were obviously managers, were very polite.  However, our waiter did not bring us any refills or even ask if we wanted any.  At the end of our meal he tried to make small talk with us, but it wasn't really appreciated at that point. 
   
To start we tried the jumbo shrimp and cheese curds appetizer.  The shrimp was good, but the cheese curds were just meh.  

My entr√©e was eggplant parmesan served on fettuccine with cream sauce.  It was really good.  My dining partner had the ribs, they were not so good.  He stated that he had to use all the strength in his hands to tear the ribs apart.  Anyone who knows ribs, knows that the meat should just fall right off the bone, but he was gnawing at it, which is gross.  
A minor that was with us had the kids' cheeseburger.  The cheeseburger got a thumbs down.  I could have cooked a better burger at home for wayyy cheaper.
  
The three of us shared a teeny tiny chocolate cheesecake.  It was about the shape and size of a hockey puck.  It didn't taste like cheesecake at all.  It was just blah.  

All of our food arrived nicely arranged on fancy plates, however, minus the eggplant dish, that did not make this mediocre meal taste any better, and the bill after tip was 80 bucks for the privilege.

Buck and Honey's is ,indeed, in the old location where Beef O' Bradys was, and that place really blew.  Unfortunately, Buck and Honey's is only marginally better at this time, and certainly A LOT more expensive.  Perhaps with time, and a lobotomy they will improve."}
{"text":"I have never had a bad meal at Buck and Honey's. Whether it's Friday night fish fry that we are picking up and bringing home or a nice sit down dinner there, everything is awesome. The drinks are good and the wine selection is ample. If you like a good martini with your dinner then this is the place to go. My favorite meals are the fish fry or the land and sea (any combination). You also have to try the cheese curds, by far some of the best!"}
{"text":"This was our first visit to Buck & Honey's.  I have followed B & H's for awhile, heard several positive comments from friends, and felt like there was a certain \"momentum\" going on there.  We ventured out on an icy, week day evening to visit Buck & Honey's and learn more first hand.  I can't say it was the best experience - staff were chilly and aloof from the minute we walked in.  The place has a certain charm about it, with photographs of the old \"Buck & Honey\" farm lining the walls.  We started at the bar, an Old Fashioned (average at best), a mixed drink (mixed with regular coke when asked for diet), a Leinie's tap, and a Margarita (not so good, bartender added orange juice but didn't really make it palatable or offer another solution), so we didn't really get off on the right foot as the staff that collected our money seemed more interested in speaking and gossiping with their co-workers then welcoming us to the establishment.  Next we asked for a table and were seated adjacent to the front door - even though there were plenty of open tables and booths - so the chilly evening continued.  Our waitress was simply poorly prepared, leaving the table a couple of times to garner information just to complete our order. Annoying...to me another sign of poor preparation by management. The table ultimately settled on a few appetizers - dynamo nachos, quesadilla, ahi app, gourmet mac & cheese, bacon wrapped dates,  and some sassy curds. Bacon wrapped dates - good.  Ahi app - probably the best dish we were served.  Everything else, average at best.  Unfortunately the \"average\" then continued from the front door to the bar to the dining table, therefore I feel that I really can't rate the experience higher than poor, nor can I suggest that you give them a try...which I feel unfortunate about as they seemed to have a certain social media and online buzz...only to be quelled by an actual visit and the experience."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Really good food! I had the fish tacos and my girlfriend had the chipotle chicken pasta. Both were amazing. Good selection of tap beers as well"}
{"text":"I went here midday on a Saturday for lunch. The food was pretty good and everything on the menu sounded good. I saw some of the personal pizzas, and I will be back to try them! I had the chicken, bacon, ranch panini with sweet fries. The fries were seriously awesome. The panini was decent, but not great. It was just dripping with ranch; I couldn't even taste the bacon. The chicken was a little tough and could all come out when I tried to bite. My boyfriend got the jambalaya and slammed the whole thing -- it's spicy, be warned! The services and everything was great; I'll be back."}
{"text":"Gave it a try and would go back. Good service and the food OK.  Like to try the outdoor seating and a steak / mac & cheese. Pizza was really good, reminded me bit of Piasans from way back. AYCE mussels were OK  and the crab stuffed tenderloin friend had was quite good. Bread pudding was top notch.

pt II - went back . prime rib , bbq ribs, mac/cheese pizza and some apps were good but the service definitely dipped, although  they were bit busier. no more bread pudding on desert menu  because it was \"too labor intense\" ; per staff,  sucks.  
like to try their  fish fry;  but no real hurry."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch and was very underwhelmed. Service was poor despite there being not much of a crowd. Ordered a grilled chicken pesto on ciabatta and it was edible but nothing to get excited over.  Even the hand cut fries tasted like they had been sitting in oil too long. My wife had a club sandwich that had borderline burnt bread. Sorely disappointed and doubt we will be back."}
{"text":"Can't complain after my last trip to Buck & Honey's! The first time I was there was last summer, and we sat outside... chillin out maxin relaxin all cool... you know how we do. Anyways, went there again a couple of weeks ago with friends. Because we're lushes, we ordered a couple of tall glasses of wine, which was maybe a glass and a half and definitely the way I pour! Yup yup. 

I ordered the fish tacos for my entree, because since I moved back to Madison from San Diego, all I ever want are amazing fish tacos. I dream of them. To my surprise, these fish tacos were actually not too shabby!!! Who knew a little place in Sun Prairie would satisfy my craving! Definitely order them from the regular menu though, since the first time I was there I ordered them from the Life Balance menu, and those were just so-so (I seriously try fish tacos everywhere I can).

Definitely worth popping over for a casual night out!"}
{"text":"This review is for the Mother's Day brunch buffet that we recently experienced. We've been to this place quite a few times. Sadly, their better effort, a small-plate companion restaurant in the adjoining space was closed. Sun Prairie is not exactly brimming over with dining options and it's generally decent with even a few items that are quite good. I like some of the things on their app menu such as the seared tuna. 

But LORD GOD avoid the brunch buffet at all costs. First off, it's highway robbery. Really do not appreciate walking into a buffet-only set up on Mother's day and being pick-pocketed. The food on the buffet, while well varied, was uniformly terrible. Wilted salad, warm shrimp cocktail, HARD BOILED eggs benedict, rubbery, dry potatoes, cold and rubbery pancakes. Buffets suck and can make even decent restaurants founder, but if you have to have one figure out how to make the items to order, like an omelette station that makes the omelette. This buffet was just plain horrible. Unless you're the type who just loves going back for your seventh helping at a brunch, this is a TERRIBLE VALUE. 

So insult to injury - this thing costs like $30 a person! But wait it gets worse! They tack on an 18% gratuity for a meal you served yourself! Literally, the only thing a waitperson served us was a terrible bloody mary (tastes like out of the bottle Mr. & Mrs. T's) and a mimosa. Well, no problem, that's worth a $20 tip. Not. 

Three people for brunch, one bloody mary, one mimosa, one orange juice. $121.00!  We could have gone to Sardine and had their glorious made to order food and drinks for less. OUCH.

Go, have your firecracker shrimp - but my advice - avoid this over-priced buffet of bland, poorly cooked food at all costs."}
{"text":"Not bad Sun Prairie, not bad at all.

The bar experience was a little better than the restaurant one, so I'll start there. The bar area makes for a pretty homey atmosphere. Everything looks new and clean (unlike most places in SP), but with some unfinished industrial pieces to add some \"cool\" factor, or whatever factor it is that you get when you use raw construction materials in your final product. Add a small staged area for some live music and a few local craft options on tap and you really have the best spot in town to grab a beer with a friend.

There are a few dining areas that spread across the building, two of which are close enough to hear the live performers, but we were seated just outside of that in a sort of indoor courtyard for the complex. The walls were open to the inside of the building which was mostly empty aside from people coming and going to the wine bar next door. It was kind of a commotion in the hallway when I was there, with servers coming back and forth from across the hall over and over again, I would suggest you request to sit inside the main restaurant so you can hear the music anyway.

Everyone in my family liked their dinners and the service was pleasant. I had the French Onion soup as a starter which wasn't anything to write home about. It was pretty salty broth and the cheese was melted, not caramelized. I absolutely love French Onion when it's done right, so maybe I'm a bit hard to impress. For my entree though I split the Thai Chicken Pizza with my mom which was really good. We got the fourteen inch which really could be split by three very hungry people, so we definitely would have gotten the twelve if we had realized how generous the portion was. The peanut sauce had a surprising amount of kick and I also liked that they tipped it off with crunchy cabbage.

I was impressed that they were thoughtful enough to design a health conscious menu. My sister avoids gluten as much as possible and having a set menu of better for you options to choose from really puts Buck and Honeys higher on our list of options because of how easy they make it to dine out but stay healthy."}
{"text":"Great Wisconsin Food.

Awesome location and great atmosphere.

Food was tasty and service was great.

Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Went here for a late lunch. I've been wanting to try the place out for a while, especially after they won best of Madison cheesecurds!! 

Of course the first thing we ordered was cheesecurds. They definitely live up to some of the best in Madison! The flavor of the breading was excellent, but I could have done with a touch thinner breading. However I think it had to be this thick to hold up to the gooey, stringy cheese inside. Best cheese consistency of curd I've had in Madison!

For my meal, after a long debate of what to get (everything sounded so good), I got the tilapia tacos with asparagus. The tacos were very flavorful and the shells held up, however the juices inside were a little runny. The asparagus was a little salty for my liking, but then again I don't really like that much salt. My friend got the caprese panini and was a big fan. We also got a side of the mac & cheese and garlic potatoes for her son. He loved the mac & cheese! 

We both will definitely be going back to try more options, get more cheesecurds, and sit in the patio section!! Also did I mention there is an Elvis statue on the patio..."}
{"text":"We double dated here for Valentines Day. It was pretty mediocre. The main area was very loud with a live band so we were grateful to be in an annexed bar area that was much quieter. 

It took almost ten minutes before our server greeted us and another 5-10 to get our drinks. I was disappointed that they only had three beers on tap and settled for a Karben 4. 

We ordered the appetizer sampler. My friends were satisfied with the dates, the cheese curds were pretty average, however, the firecracker shrimp was criminally over-cooked with an unremarkable flavor. 

When we finally got our entrees. My husband's medium-well steak was cooked rare. My medium steak was medium-rare. Our friends steak was about right and the meatloaf was pretty bland, I was told. 

Overall, we paid $33 for each of our steak entrees, the least they could have done was cook them properly. I doubt we will visit again any time soon. It was too expensive for a meh meal."}
{"text":"I wish there was a way to give this place six dollars! We go here at least once a month and every single time the food is just absolutely amazing. The staff is perfect, the prices are exactly what you want to spend, everything is just off the charts with this location. You need to go here! This is a perfect place to take the family on a nice cool summer evening and enjoy the outdoor space with live music and entertainment. Or go here on a romantic evening with this significant other. Or a special occasion. There is no reason not to go here!"}
{"text":"Saturday night in August 2013, good waitress, mediocre food, terrible manager. Matt the manager had 2 menus w the same product at 2 different prices. Instead of honoring their misprint he insisted on charging the higher price. Result: a $139 bill without the 2 dessert cocktails and 2 adult couples that will never frequent the business again, all over a $4 misprinted menu and the dumbest manager I have seen in decades. Thanks Buck & Honey's"}
{"text":"This review is for the Loft private dining room that is located above the actual restaurant.  We were here for a 50th wedding anniversary this past Saturday and I cannot express what a wonderful time everyone had!  There were about 35 of us and I thought the room accommodated us perfectly.  The appetizers and bar were in the front room while the main dining was in the 2nd room.  There was a sort of rustic-industrial feel to the room that would do well for all sorts of events.  The lighting was great and the room held a comfortable temperature for the duration of the evening which is not easy to do with groups.

We had two servers assigned to the party and they were responsible for bar-tending and serving.  They both did an amazing job with our group; friendly, funny, professional.  The food was fantastic!  We all had an Italian side salad before the meal and then ordered off of a smaller, personalized menu.  My fiance had the salmon which I found to be a little too fishy but he devoured.  I had the NY Strip and it was honestly perfect; cooked well, seasoned well, good portion size.  The mashed potatoes were delightful but I'm never a fan of corn on the cob for a side - especially when the event is a bit more formal.  Something funny about eating with your hands in a dress and heals =)  

I, unfortunately, can't remember the names of the two women working our event but they really made the experience great.  It's one thing to have good food but if the service is mediocre, it's just another restaurant.  Kudos to them!! I will absolutely consider and recommend the private dining area and will make the trip to Sun Prairie to try the \"normal\" restaurant."}
{"text":"We were very disappointed.  My salmon was marginal, very small portion for price and fries were Luke warm and soggy.  My hubby's fish was mushy and not hot.  Overpriced, tables too close together in the far room.  The beer choices were good and my salad was cold and crisp.  We will not be going back."}
{"text":"Why, I ask, would you ever put a sugary red dressing (tastes like Western dressing) on walleye? The pork belly poutine was a better appetizer, but fries seemed reheated in a microwave."}
{"text":"Very fast service!!!  The bacon wrapped dates were excellent!!! Also a fan of the Firecracker Shrimp!!  A little spice to add to the experience!!"}
{"text":"Not bad but maybe I'm spoiled. Cheese curds were really good but the Salmon and Burger were mediocre.  Same with the Clam Chowder and French Onion.  Granted we were in there for lunch and it looks more like a dinner place but for the price of lunch I expect dinner quality.  Really not bad though just not great."}
{"text":"Highly recommend!  In town for our daughter's dance competition, my wife and I found the place because they were open earlier than 11am and served brunch. Walked in, and we're greeted immediately, sat at the bar. Clean, well lit...tastefully decorated, very asthetically pleasing. Staff was friendly and attentive. And now the food...phenomenal, great presentation and perfectly hot.  I had eggs Benedict with the cheesy hash browns. Wouldn't order it again simply because there are too many great thing to try on the menu. I'm sure they do well in Sun Prairie, but if I didn't know better this is a college town style bistro. Meaning it's as far from a boring small town restaurant as you can get. Only wish they were closer to home. Big shout out to TeAnn at the bar...she was great!"}
{"text":"We arrived @ 3:30 on a Sunday afternoon. It was not busy. we were promptly seated. Service was slow. we were told that they were serving dinner menu now due to Sunday brunch
We ordered beverages. When my bottled beer arrived I asked for a glass.  After waiting 10 minutes our waiter finally checked back and a second request for a glass was made. This time it arrived propmtly
We ended up ordering appetizers and pizza being disappointed that the lunch menu was unavailable. The pizza was good, very slow in coming. Did I say that it was not busy? 

The waiter did not check in with us or ask for a second drink order ( which he would have received).

Bottom line is, I cannot recommend this restaurant due to the service. Ouf food was okay, the menu is pricey, selection is limited and another diner rejected their order because it arrived cold


Neither I or my group will Return."}
{"text":"I ordered the perch and was very disappointed in the portion size. I was served six pieces of perch that were 1/2 wide and 4 inches long at a cost of over $20.  I addition I was shocked that my martini cost $10.  Service was very good."}
{"text":"Buck & Honeys is one of our favorite \"go to\" restaurants. Their Ahi app is my favorite along with the Firecracker Shrimp. We have never had a bad meal here. The employees are friendly and outgoing. Great bartenders as well! Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere.  Some fun outdoor seating options with live music on the weekends.  Staff consistently does a good job, very professional.  Great menu & they emphasize local products such as Sassy Cow.  You'll enjoy the experience, a local gem."}
{"text":"Disappointed... Great atmosphere & wonderful smells upon entering, but after that nothing spectacular.

Food was generic & plated very basically- unlike their website pics.  I had the Breaded Tilapia  & bacon wrapped shrimp with green beans & sweet potato fries. Boring, a little greasy, & salty. 

Sorry, way better options when I'm in the area..."}
{"text":"Best place in Sun Prairie. Good balanced variety. More expensive too but worth it."}
{"text":"We both ordered one of the chef's three course specials for $24.  Both 12 oz Ribeyes.  Mine is French Onion Soup, Brussel Sprouts and Sweet Potato Fries.
Hubs ordered Seafood Chowder, Garlic Mashed Potatoes and grilled Mushrooms with Onions.  Dessert is included and not even thinking about it yet! Lots of food.
I'm taking home more than half my entree!  I had to save room for 6 bites of rich and creamy Creme Br√ªl√©e.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"So... I'm here now, been sitting at a table in the bar area for about 15 min. At least three different employees have, literally, walked right past me without saying a word. Not one word. No eye contact, no glass of water, no \"Someone will be right with you,\" no \"GTFO of our restaurant,\" nothing. The only reason I'm still here is that I wanted to post my review while it was still fresh in my mind, and I also want to find somewhere else to eat before I leave."}
{"text":"I've been here several times and its just meh

The food is hit and miss. I've had some nice tasting meals here and others were just blah. For some reason they feel like they're a higher end restaurant that has a bar, where I feel like its just a little above average bar and sells decent food.  A few times I've been here the music was too loud and I couldn't even hold a conversation over it and left. 

On my last 2 visits I had the Grass Fed Bone in Beef Ribeye and the Prime Pork Ribeye. Both were ok, cooked as you would expect but nothing to write home about. I've had much better steaks for the same price at other restaurants. The appetizers tasted great but got very little for what I paid. 

I sat at the bar a few times where they never asked for my credit card until I was finished and ready to pay the bill just like I was at a restaurant. The last few times I sat at the bar with hardly anyone there they asked for my credit card even though I was eating a meal like the several tables around me. I'm very careful handing over my credit card for long periods as I have had it compromised a few times while traveling before. So just like a bar (not restaurant) they demanded my credit card so I handed it over. With only 12-15 seats at the bar it's not like you will lose track of who's, who especially when the POS (Point of Sale) system they use showed exactly who was in which seat."}
{"text":"Buck and Honey's is very consistent with their food, drinks, and the service! The patio is a great place to enjoy lunch, dinner, or drinks. They are very kid friendly. In the summer, they often have a live band, fire, bag tossing area, and much more on the patio. Hey, they even have Elvis!

Also, Suzette was super awesome, as were the other servers!"}
{"text":"Random impressions:

Great waitress (Shay), she brought ample honey and cream with our coffee (a rare occurrence), and was very personable. We'll go back due to her great service and friendliness.

The strip mall setting and atmosphere surprised me. For some reason, I thought it would be a more impressive place. The Elvis statue in the courtyard seems odd given the interior emphasis on huge blown up photos from the turn of the century. Music is fairly obnoxious pop, but at a somewhat low volume level so it was tolerable.

Shay was proud to let us know that the (huge) Sassy cow cheese curds we ordered were award winning. Served and attractively presented with ranch and marinara. The flavor is fairly bland and was improved by the ranch. Each curd required several bites to finish. Coffee is standard, neither outstanding nor bad. We realized we had no napkins or silverware so we grabbed them from an empty table.

They use a *lot* of plates. They don't always fit the dishes they sit under. My sandwich (their version of a club sandwich included both basil aeoli and guacamole) had waaay too much going on, I finished 1/4 of it and took the rest home. I ordered the Brussels sprouts as my side choice, but they were hard and tasted mostly like canned Parmesan cheese.

My son and daughter both ordered the chipotle steak eggs benedict, and both liked it. My son also liked his shrimp bisque. Neither really touched their fries, one had regular and one had sweet potato, neither were that good. We looked at the drink menu and found a preponderance of sickeningly sweet concoctions with graham cracker crumbs and cinnamon sugar and yeah...no. I'd have to say the best thing about our visit was the interactions with the waitress. It's a solid 3."}
{"text":"The appetizers and salads were really delicious however the main dishes were fairly mediocre. 

The ravioli dish was hard with a overly rich mushroom sauce. The fish which was prepared was curled and mushy from being over cooked. Stick with appetizers and beer during happy hour."}
{"text":"Our experience started off very accommodating and pleasant. We made a reservation for a booth and got it within a few minutes. Our waitress was very nice, though busy. However, it all went downhill once we placed our orders. We ordered the Friday fish fry. We received our order within 3 minutes. This tells me that the food wasn't made to order. The food wasn't very hot. The gourmet Mac & cheese tastes like Velveeta shells. The sweet potato fries were a bit soggy. The fish was not good; it was rather greasy. I'm sure they have some good stuff going on, but we don't plan on coming back."}
{"text":"We have lived here for almost a year now and have visited a lot of restaurants between Madison and Milwaukee. This place is hands down the best restaurant we have been to."}
{"text":"Popular yes, memorable no

If you are looking for a solid casual dining experience, I have no problem recommending Buck and Honey's.  I've not had a bad dish during my two visits to the restaurant.  So why the three star rating?  Well, nothing's been great either. While I enjoyed my entrees at Buck & Honey's the (buffalo chicken salad and chipotle chicken pasta), I probably wouldn't order them again.  The \"A-OK\" definition of the three star rating accurately sums up my feelings toward this establishment, so that's what I went with.

Things I liked:
* The service I encountered during both visits was excellent.  I experienced friendly knowledgeable servers and prompt, attentive service during both visits on very busy nights for the restaurant.  Props to Stephanie and Allison for a job well done.

* Sassy cow cheese curds.  'nuf said.

* The dinner specials are a great value.  During my first visit, my father got the Sunday prime rib special.  Three courses for $22 and he was extremely pleased with the quality of the meal.

* The bar staff at B&H is solid.  My wife enjoyed her spicy Bloody Mary and my red wine flight was a great value (very generous pours).  Beer section is above average.  The bar area was packed both times I visited.

Things I'm conflicted about:
* The French Onion Soup.  During my first visit, Buck & Honey's nailed the preparation of this dish.  It was the pure essence of caramelized onion perfection.  The soup had a touch of natural sweetness with a hint of bitterness.  The proportions of bread and cheese were perfect.  This was a dish to dream on.  Unfortunately, this was not the dish I received on my second visit.  The proportions were all out of whack.  Too little sweetness, too much bitterness.  Too much cheese, too few croutons.  Too much broth, too few onions.  While the second rendition wasn't bad, it was far from memorable.   Since the soup can be added to an entree for just $2, it's worth taking the chance of getting version one.

Things I didn't like:
* The portion size of the Chipotle Chicken Pasta dish is far too much food for one normal sized person.    Give me less quantity and more quality please.

* The mac and cheese pizza ordered by my daughter was the weakest entree of my two visits.  The crust was burnt and the pizza needed more of the Alfredo sauce.  My daughter who is a pizza devouring machine ate only half the pizza and did not want to bring the leftovers home.  If you are in the mood for pizza in Sun Prairie (or anywhere else in the greater Madison metro area), proceed with great haste to nearby Salvatore's.

* The other entree that fell slightly flat was the Buffalo Chicken Salad.  Like the pasta entree, it was quantity (lots of chicken and pasta) over quality (the onion was unevenly cut, so the larger pieces were almost raw).

Don't be scared off by the three star review.  As I mentioned early, this is a solid casual dining option.  But it is not a destination dining option for me.  The place was packed both times I visited, so Buck & Honey's is definitely doing something right."}
{"text":"I'm not sure how to rate this place. It was excellent atmosphere and food. The place is very busy so make a reservation. My one reservation was the food was too rich. It tasted excellent, however I felt like I was eating a pound of butter. My husband agreed which is super unusual. It would've been better if it was slightly \"lighter\" and not as heavy on the fats. I guess bottom line is don't expect something healthy unless you order a salad.

Since I'm already on the negatives, my other negative was the servers. Our server was very grumpy. She made a comment about a bus boy not doing his job and being \"that age\" - which my husband and I are young. The other servers were calling out to each other and giving each other negative feedback. Maybe it was a fluke.

Sorry to start with the negatives! Overall the food was good, with large portions. I would say it was not worth the price as a vegetarian. It is slightly more expensive than your regular sit down.

The location is new and has a wonderful atmosphere. It's very cute and perfect for a reception or party."}
{"text":"I never go out to Sun Prairie because of fear of chains, but we were going to a movie so we decided to have dinner here first.  Very good!  As the reviews say, definitely try the apps.  The firecracker shrimp is delicious and you will want to order more.  The variety platter is definitely not enough for 4 people, only has 2 bacon wrapped dates, which again - are amazing.  Exactly correctly prepared.  The cheese curds also good, and not greasy.  We did the apps and a pizza, which was ok, nothing special.  Next time, apps only!!"}
{"text":"Certainly one of the better eateries that Sun Prairie offers. However the atmosphere here is mostly what your paying for as the menu seems to be good but with a couple real standout duds. It's popularity will continue to hold as SP grows in populace and chain restaurants."}
{"text":"It's true folks, Sal's on Main St. isn't the only reason I drive to Sun Prairie. 
But it still remains my favorite for hitting the road. 
Here's what's up:

I'm more than pumped that Sun Prairie has a local destination for great food, but my last visit couple of visits were less than stellar. The most recent was around the time they were gearing up to open Plate & Barrel, so I wonder if I need to get back there and give these guys another try. Their beer line up is always stellar and they are incredible at partnering with the community, but my meal (meatloaf and taters) was cold and lacked flavor. I really wanted to catch the attention of our server, but I think her section was large and it was a while before she came back to check in. 

When I left that night I was a tad discouraged, but oddly when I reheated the leftovers, they were better. Maybe I just need to grab take-out and make my way back to Madison with their grub? Maybe I'm not ordering the right things?"}
{"text":"This was a restaurant that I had been wanting to go to for some time.  Having recently moved into the area, it was finally convenient.  Their poor service and overpriced mediocrity outweigh any reason I would have to return.

It started by us being given the wrong menus.  Instead of confirming them all, our server swapped them out one by one as we started asking questions.  By the time we ordered our entrees, it was obvious that our server was sub-par.  She was very crass.  During the meal, she also reached across the table multiple times, hitting two of us in the head.  Our drinks remained empty most of the dinner and our check came out nearly 10 minutes after she cleared the table.  The service was so bad, it became comical.

Service aside, the real reason that I will not return is the food.

We started with the cheese curds.  These were very good, which isn't surprising because Sassy Cow is amazing on its own.  This was the best part of our meal, but our consensus was that it was more due to the quality of the dairy and not the restaurant.

I also ordered a cup of the chicken tortilla soup before the meal.  The overall flavor was ok, nothing great, but it came out barely above room temperature.  Having an inattentive server, I wasn't even able to get it sent back before the main course came out.

Our entrees consisted of the lasagna, the prime rib, and a vegetarian dish that I cannot recall the name of.  Though, I wish I could remember that dish's name, it was the best of them all.  The lasagna was very bland and tasted like the meat wasn't even seasoned.  The prime rib came out under cooked (I ordered it medium rare) and was also very bland.  Seeing that it was some of the most expensive prime rib I had had in a long time, it made the unremarkable nature of it all the more apparent.

It probably goes without saying, but we ended up going elsewhere for dessert."}
{"text":"My husband and I just had the pizza from Buck & Honey's for the first time recently, so I HAD to post an update. We only ordered the Mac & Cheese pizza, but OH.MY.GOODNESS.

We ate it at least two weeks ago and my mouth still waters just thinking about it. They use several types of REAL cheese and serve it on a thin crust.

Mind = blown. I've had mac & cheese pizza before, but never like this."}
{"text":"My fiance and I went to Buck and Honey's today for lunch.  We expected that it would be pretty quiet at lunch time on a weekday (Friday), but we didn't expect to encounter such dour, inattentive waitstaff.  When we walked in, there was no one at the hostess stand- we waited a couple of minutes, some guy who appeared to work there wandered by but didn't even acknowledge our presence.  Finally, the hostess showed up. She didn't say hello or welcome, or even smile- just glanced at us and said \"two?\" in a flat, emotionless voice.  She started to show us to a table, and a waitress came up to talk to her, so the hostess told us to \"hold it\" so she could finish her conversation before showing us to our table.  Our waiter was also completely emotionless, barely talked to us, and never asked us how things were or if we wanted dessert.  He refilled our water once. When our food came out, it was the hostess who brought it out, but she clearly didn't know which table it was supposed to go to, so she wandered around looking confused until she finally figured out we were the only table who didn't have our food yet.

The food itself wasn't bad, but not stellar, either. We ordered a Thai chicken pizza to share.  It was decent- it was nice that it was on a thin crust, though the crust was really dry and bland with not a lot of flavor to it, so I kind of felt like I was eating cardboard with tasty toppings.  Overall it was ok, but really overpriced.  Definitely NOT worth $!9 for a pizza.  And definitely not good enough to overcome the mediocre service. 

It wasn't a terrible dining experience, so I wouldn't rule out going there again (maybe to try the fish fry?) , but I'd probably be more likely to choose somewhere else."}
{"text":"Came here before we watched a movie at the Sun Prairie theater without a reservation. It was expected we'd have to wait a bit but we were able to find two spots at the bar (full meal service is offered there)

We ordered some drinks and the firecracker shrimp to start. It was ok - the plating was a bit messy and I would have liked if the shrimp was a bit more crispy. Decent flavor but not anything too impressive.

For dinner I was excited to see they had a life balance (healthier) option. I ordered the salmon off of that and you had the option to choose two more sides. I got the broccolini and smashed cauliflower. The salmon was pretty good, cooked well and flavorful. The smashed cauliflower is the low carb alternative to mashed potatoes. (Mashed potatoes are my favorite food so it's hard to sub it out)... But they did the trick and went well with the salmon. The broccolini fell flat for me. Not seasoned or anything. Just long, steamed broccoli. Meh.

There was also live music because it was a Saturday. Me and the bf basically had to yell to be able to hear each other even though we were sitting like a foot apart from each other.

Overall three stars because it was just an average place for me. Nothing too good or too bad stuck out."}
{"text":"Not what I was expecting for a small town. Sunday brunch was fantastic, exactly what we ordered, nice size servings. Sat at the bar and had great service."}
{"text":"I have been to Buck and Honey's for lunch several times.  I had a feeling of \"it is nice but not special\".  My friend really enjoys dinner there so we made a plan for a night out.

She has a great picker for wine.  She has a favorite from Oregon state called A to Z.  It is a pinot noir and it is very nice.  We had the bottle.  We tried the bacon wrapped dates.  Lovely flavor with the smokey bacon, sweetness of the date, filled with rich cream cheese,  and a surprise bite of garlic in the center.

Our entree was the Steak pizza.  It was nice and my friend goes nuts for it.  It has too much bleu cheese on it for me.  I ate the part around the crust and sent my share to my friend's spouse.   

Dessert was a chocolate cheese cake with pomegranate sauce and creme brulee.  They were good and we had no trouble finishing them

What added a star from my last visit was the service.  From the host to our server to the staff delivering the plates...they were all kind and attentive.  Our server even gave us a heads up about the weather outside.  Much different than feeling like a burden to the lunch staff."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere, GREAT service too.
My husbands walleye was very good.. i had fish tacos which really were not the best.. will def come back and try again,hoping i just made bad menu choice!"}
{"text":"Been visiting B&H's since they opened. I would consider this establishment one of, if not thee best restaurant in Sun Prairie. They have a great lite menu, well prepared entrees, and make the best Thai Chicken Pizza. 
With that said, the offerings in Sun Prairie for dining are pitiful, so B&H's holds up well. They've  fallen a notch (just a bit) since their startup in food quality, but have added an outdoor eating area that frequently hosts live music. Along with a great drink selection.
Above Average"}
{"text":"My wife and I went to Buck & Honey's for lunch. The decor is nice and the place has an open feel. I had a sandwich and my wife had a small steak. The food was good to excellent. The french onion soup was on point though. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Not sure why I keep hoping this place will turn around. Went there for dinner last night and it was average at best, but the prices are anything but. 

I'll start with my favorite veggie, Brussel sprouts. The poor things were doused in so much balsamic that they were practically pickled. Moving on to the garlic mashed potatoes; they could have some balsamic as they had no flavor at all, not even a hint of garlic. As for the ribeye, it was also underwhelming. If I had wanted a TV dinner, I'd have gone to the grocery store."}
{"text":"We had a nice dinner experience. We tried the sample platter for the app. The bang bang shrimp in the app was delicious. I'd highly recommend. 

We shared a large pizza and were very happy. It was a nice thin crust pizza that was cooked perfectly. The veggie toppings were cut into large pieces, which was a nice change of pace from your average pizza. Overall, it was a very good pizza. 

The staff was friendly and accommodating. They had a musician playing acoustic guitar in the bar area which added a nice ambiance."}
{"text":"Stopped for lunch, server was extremely helpful!!  I had the Buffalo Chicken Salad and it was fabulous!!  We also had the Firecracker Shrimp App and that was also very very good.   I love Buck & Honey's, can be very hard to get a table on a Friday or Saturday evening but that just means they have good food and service!!  We will return!!"}
{"text":"I would give this place a 5 star if it was strictly on the food for it was excellent, but I have to give 4 star due to poor service on one particular visit.  GOOD: Food is excellent- During 2 different visits I tried the Sassy Curds which were tasty and had a sprinkling of bacon on top; the Ahi App which was delicious and stylishly presented; the French Onion Soup which was also delicious; and the Bananas Crepe Foster which was prepared perfectly.  The place is stylishy decorated and has a good amount of seating inside and a large open patio seating outside.  The service on 2nd visit was great. BAD: Only negative is during the 1st visit they had nobody on the floor to seat people and when the bartender observed us waiting to be seated (which the sign states \"wait to be seated\") he ignored us and walked away to the kitchen.  When he came back on the floor he was followed my a women who we thought was the manager and was going to seat us, but they both just looked at us again and said nothing so I actually had to shout across the room \"Do we just sit anywhere?\" and then they miraculously picked up some menus and assisted us.  Ridiculous and was during a weekend within a hour of them opening so they should have been prepared."}
{"text":"The food was solid.  The service was decent.  The atmosphere was nice and relaxed, however the food was not worth the price.  Total bill came to over $50 and that was with coupons.  Making the menu sound impressive doesn't mean the food has to cost an arm and a leg.  I ordered pot roast.  It shouldn't have been as expensive as it was."}
{"text":"We ordered food to go and were quite pleased with it.  One was a Chicken and the other Turkey.  The garlic potatoes were very good.  Meat was moist and tender.  Our friends had a pizza which appeared to have the garlic uncut as a whole on the pizza.  They chose not to eat that, but they said it was very good regardless.  Ambiance is good.  We will go back!"}
{"text":"Visited on a Friday and a Monday both around 6:30 and was able to sit right away. My server (I believe her name was Melissa) was amazing. I had the stuffed chicken the first time and it was phenomenal and then a steak with mushrooms and onions the second time. The mashed potatoes and delicious. And our appetizer, the B&H Sampler, was incredible. Probably my new favorite spot!"}
{"text":"This was not my first choice for dinner but that aside, this is a great place. Had the Bomber Special pizza and it did not disappoint. The place is hooping so I was lucky to find a seat at the bar. Great food, good service, what more do you need?"}
{"text":"This is a nice, chill place to eat. There's a little bar when you walk in. I've been here twice: once ordered a chicken wrap and it was ah-maz-ing- perfectly cooked and flavorful. There soup is also savory and delicious.
However, the second time I've came here I ordered the ribeye (their special for the day) I ordered it medium and it was dry, tough, and flavorless :(. My grandmother ordered the salmon and it was very fishy-tasting.
The service is great, friendly and knowledgable. 
Bottom line: this is a place for brunch. Do not order dinner-like meals here. Stick to salads, soups, and wraps, and you will have a nice time."}
{"text":"The food was AMAZING!  We went there for restaurant week and the experience was very delightful.  You always expect to be rotated out quickly during that week, but we didn't feel that way at all this year.

They didn't offer a lot in terms of a gluten free menu.  No worries though, you'll still find something (possibly with a substitution).  Something else that stood out to me was the available parking.  There's plenty of it so don't worry.

I definitely recommend this place due to the great food, great service, and location."}
{"text":"We have eaten at Buck and Honey's several times and have not been disappointed yet! Good food and good service!"}
{"text":"FRIED CHEESE CURDS!  These are the best cheese curds I have ever had.  I have been to the Old Fashioned and everywhere in between, nothing comes close to this place.  Sassy Cow Creamery is right down the road and they get the curds fresh daily.  They also make two dipping sauces in-house and they rock!"}
{"text":"What happened to this place? Used to have good stuff. Just came back spent $200 will never do it again. I always knowing going here I will dish out some cash but never had I left so disappointed before. Will not be going back. What a difference a year makes."}
{"text":"We tried this place for fish and were not disappointed.  The people at the hostess stand are very friendly and attentive.  Nothing I hate more than being ignored when you arrive.  We had a reservation, and were actually a little late because of traffic, but got right in.  We had both the deep fried and the baked cod.  It comes with cheesy hashbrowns, that we were told are only prepared on Friday night.  A little disappointing that there is no option for a baked potato, but the hashbrowns are good.  The fish, baked and fried, was excellent. Creamy style coleslaw was also good.  Your meal arrives all on a nice plate, no plastic cup of coleslaw, which I appreciated.  It comes with a warmed roll, that appears to be already buttered on the top.  I would have preferred some butter rather than being served this way, but it was an OK roll. They have a huge patio outside where lots of people were enjoying the nice weather, and inside is warm and comfortably decorated. Bottom line, good fish, good service, enjoyable dinner."}
{"text":"Decent restaurant...very busy on Friday night.  This restaurant menu is so similar to Bonfyre in Madison...they need some originality.  Decent beer selection and ok prices, seem a little high for being in sun prairie.  Service was good...fish fry was ok, but there are better in the area for sure."}
{"text":"Checked this place out last night for the first(?) time. I had thought I had been here once before, years ago, but upon walking in, it was totally different than I thought I remembered. So, maybe it was my first time, not really sure! :) 

Either way, it was great! The ambiance was very nice; Semi-dim, but not dark, lighting and tastefully decorated. We were greeted immediately and taken to a table. We sat at a high-top in the bar area, per request. 

The menu selection was pretty decent. The meals themselves each sounded amazing. Tuesdays they have a \"date night\" special - two entrees (from a pre-selected, yet pretty long list), and your choice of wine from another, smaller, list, for $44. Pretty good deal! 

We did not go with that option, though. The BF isn't much of a wine drinker. Instead, I chose a meal off their \"Life Balance\" menu. I thought it was really cool they had this option. Healthier meals, with calories and fat listed out. I got the salmon, with smashed cauliflower and broccolini. It was SO good! And very decent portion sizes for being a \"healthier\" option. The smashed cauliflower tasted like a mashed potato, creamy and flavorful, yet much better for you. I definitely recommend. The BF went with their meatloaf option, with the veggie of day, corn. It was a street corn flavor almost - really delicious. His meal also came with mashed potatoes, real ones ;)

All in all, it was an incredibly pleasant and tasty visit. Service was spot on, as well! Very friendly hostess as well as server! I will absolutely be back!"}
{"text":"This location use to be a Beef O'Bradys. They sure classes up the joint and surrounded the bar with a classier dining room. There's an extension of the restaurant into what use to be the old entrance and now includes a special dining room off to the side. For the kids there's a small arcade.

The menu is just barely higher priced for Sun Prairie but is really priced right to justify the excellently prepare meal.

While I was there, I could not get the WiFi o work even though I was repeatedly told it's the phone number for the restaurant. I can't really deduct any stars for that--after all you go there for the dining experience."}
{"text":"This is considered one of the best restaurants in this town which is not saying a whole lot since of course there are almost no good restaurants in most Midwestern suburbs. 
When you walk in, the vibe is all bar. 
So expect that. We sat in a corner booth and waited way too long for our simple order. 
The staff is pleasant enough and the place only gets loud when football is on. 
We had a macaroni and cheese pizza which was heavy beyond belief and can't be recommended. Also the fried Tilapia renders the fish pretty plain and unremarkable. Cheese curds are gooey and unremarkable. 
But enjoy the night out and appreciate the family history that surrounds this spot."}
