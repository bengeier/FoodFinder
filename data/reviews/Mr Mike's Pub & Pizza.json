{"text":"Mr. Mikes is your basic bar/restaurant with basic bar/restaurant food.  We had pizza and wings.  The pizza was fine as pizzas go but the wings were AWESOME.  If you are a fan of crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside these wings delivered.  The staff was friendly. Overall is was a nice experience.  We will visit again."}
{"text":"Very good food considering that this is a bar and not a sit down dinner restaurant. Always tasty and plentiful wings, pizza, burgers, wraps and salads. The food is always fresh. Could be a little cleaner overall. Not the best place for young teens and below, or even late teens just after the guys get off work."}
{"text":"Very good food, pizza is good, wings are great and they are big...only problem is sitting it very tight and quite noisy.  If your looking for a place to eat and have a conversation get your pizza to go."}
{"text":"LOVE going to Mr. Mikes.  This is the spot a few of us hit after cc skiing.  Love the atmosphere, never had anything but good service and love the food.  Never had an issue since we've been going."}
{"text":"I am still sitting here and I have been waiting an hour for a couple salads and a stromboli.  We have now been waiting almost an hour!!!  Definitely the last time we come here!!"}
{"text":"I've eaten at Mr Mikes several times and more than anything else, this is a bar. The food is good, but it's pupose is really being a bar.  I wouldn't recommend it if you have kids.  The wings are full size and very good.   If you go, be sure to try the nachos, they are great."}
{"text":"Standard neighborhood pizza place. I got the stromboli, my wife got a pizza. They were ok.   Atmosphere is a little crazy. We were there at 2PM on a sunday afternoon and the bar was full of people boozin HARD. Could have been an off day, I suppose!"}
{"text":"The food at Mike's is very good!  Wings and pizza are some of the best around.  I have one big issue with Mike's and it is of the service.  It is AWEFUL!  I've been in the industry for over 12 years and this simply unacceptable IMO.  The bartender's for the most part are really good.  I have gone on many occasions, either just 2 of us or in groups of 6 or more, sat and waited for 10+ mins to get any attention.  Most times after going to the bar and alerting them we needed a server.  There have been times when server's have looked over and simply walked the other way to hang out at the bar or go outside and talk on their phones.  If not for the food and the good beer selection, I would never return..."}
{"text":"We had wings the other night and they were wonderful. My husband loves there fried potato chips. Until he ordered them from here I had never heard of such a thing. We had delivery service everything came yo the door hot and correct."}
{"text":"Don't rely on them for food delivery, ever. Also, the kitchen closes very early even on the weekend. Extremely poor service.... I'll go elsewhere in the future."}
{"text":"As aways food was very good got a pizza with pep. I was surprised though with the service. Usually it really lacks here but we had a really nice girl that was very attentive."}
{"text":"Ok, so I'm gonna start with prob the best wings in the area-the sweet-n-hot are awesome.  Prices are on the steep side though I would say. Everything is always good though, so makes it worth it. My question is why are the bartenders/waitresses always miserable? If u don't enjoy your work, maybe time to do something else. Good pizza is hard to find in this area, they're top 3 for me."}
{"text":"Good food, normally come here for some great hoagies.. But lack of service and getting the meal right.. Have been sitting here for the past 45 min... Still no waiter."}
{"text":"My husband and I love Mr. Mikes! It is a nice local bar/restaurant.  We generally get the nachos & seasoned wings. We have tried other things, but those are the BEST!  The nachos are what you would dream nachos taste like, warm mushy/crunchy cheesy with the best taco meat, red onions, jalape√±os,  tomatoes and black olives. This pares nicely with the seasoned whole wings. The seasoning is a beautiful blend of seasonings that delight on your tongue!   Mr. Mikes has the best perfectly cooked wings in the area!"}
{"text":"Food including pizza has gone down hill recently.  The last pizza we ordered had very little sauce, so we sent it back.  The second one was the same, we took it home & threw it out."}
{"text":"Took the advice of a bank teller & stopped for lunch. The pizza is a 10 out of 10.   People seemed friendly and I would go back again if in need of libations or food.   Great little bar with atmosphere and bartender Lindsey was great. Good beer selection. Worth a try."}
{"text":"Very disappointing evening.  Took over an hour to get medium pizza, 8 wings and calzone.  The restaurant was not busy at all.  When we asked for plates waitress acted surprised.  When we expressed our frustration over the wait waitress was like do you want the manager she had no sense of care at all.  Manager offered 20 percent off.  Bottom line yes food was good as usual but really what is the excuse for a wait like that?  Have been there on a Friday when it's packed and never waited for food like that."}
{"text":"Horrible experience on Friday, March 10th at 6:30pm (didn't get food brought out until 7:15). It was not busy. No one acknowledged us when we arrived. I was with my husband and my son. I had to find someone to ask if we were supposed to seat ourselves. Once seated, it took 6 minutes before anyone came to our table. She asked what we would like, but we were never given menus. She brought menus and said she didn't  think she had kid menus,  but she'd check. She did not have any. I asked what the choices were, and she was not positive what came with it. She said it probably comes with Oranges and fries. We ordered 2 waters and a chocolate milk (took 20 minutes to actually get our drinks). My son's chocolate milk was white - until I discovered they didn't actually mix it up. We were not given any Silverware at this point, so I tried my best with the crappy straw.   When we ordered our food, it took a long time to arrive. My wrap barely had any chicken,  had a ton of cheese, didn't have the onions that were listed on the menu, but had the tomatoes I told her I did not want. Fries tasted like a bag of frozen McCain fries. My son's meal apparently came with a go-gurt. The pull tab was missing, so w couldn't open it. I asked for scissors.  She grabbed it to show me how to \"just try this\" because it's not like I didn't already try to open it. I also told her we needed Silverware and napkins at this point. She brought 2 sets and walked away and pretty much didn't come back until the end of our meal. I shared a napkin with my son for most of the meal. I was able to get her to get a couple more napkins. My husband used his pocket knife to open our son's go-gurt.   When the waitress came by she asked how it was. I said something like, \"Eh, it was ok I guess.\" So she said, \"Can you tell me what was wrong, because I'm kind of the person in charge of this whole place.\" I told her most of the things I listed above: specifically not knowing the kids menu,  my wrap issues, and her never coming back to open my son's go-gurt.   When she came back, she told us she gave us a discount, because we didn't seem happy with our food and said she hopes we give them another try. If this was a first time waitress on her first day, maybe. But to have these issues and then find out your server is the owner, no thank you. My husband will not let me live down this horrible restaurant choice."}
{"text":"I really like their wings here.  They are the big ones.  The sauces are really good as well.  This particular time I just went for drinks.  The crowd is a bit older than the places where I would normally go, but I was in town for a wedding and this is where the groom to be picked.  Still a good time and they had a decend beer selection."}
{"text":"We typically order from here once a month. My husband jokes about it and says \"good food but never get the order right\" and it's true! We continue to go back because the wings are great! This past Friday, will be our LAST time ordering from here! We had friends over, so we ordered a large pizza and the Bella's Party Platter, which is a large version of an appetizer sampler. We picked it up, and once we got it here, we realized that everything was terrible about the platter. The wings were burnt, the onion rings were Soo charred they were unrecognizable... I became baffled when we realized the potato skins were Empty inside!!!! They were potato shells, with not even remnants of anything inside. I decided to call because I wanted them to know that this 20.00 platter, was not completed when they sent it out for pick up! My frustration grew when the female manager got on the phone, I was very kind in describing my issue until her reply was \" you are wrong, I filled those skins myself\".. I laughed a little bit and assured her I had better things to do with my Friday night, than to call a bar and make up a story about potato skins. She Rudely demanded a picture, so I said \"sure, I will send one\"... Her reply was \"never mind, I don't wNt you having my cell number\"... Lol, ok... So how do we fix this, because now I am MAD.... She told me she doesn't believe this, so she is having a driver come to my house to pick up the empty shells so she could see...... I still (one day later) waiting for an apology... We will never order from there again! I cannot believe how I was called a liar over something so silly! If this bar does not care about customer service, well then they lost a customer!"}
{"text":"Mikes has great food , Great atmosphere, a place to sit down have dinner with your family , or kick back with a cold one ."}
{"text":"Pizza was pretty good.  Also had some stuffed banana peppers, which were pretty good.  Our server was very nice and yinzer.  However, I saw that two of the staff people looked absolutely out of it, as if they were under the influence of something.  Too, the bathroom was disgusting.  The toilet was stuffed up and about to overflow.  It was just gross.  Hence 2 stars."}
{"text":"Nothing fancy. Food is good. Barmaid was friendly and attentive.  Pretty hot waitstaff and servers. Good prices and good beer selection."}
{"text":"Mr Mikes needs to address some shortcomings with the food and management. Tonight I was disappointed for the second time in two weeks. My hamburger took over 30 minutes to come to table. It was overdone and almost inedibly salty. The waitress apologized and offered to replace it with something else. Or so I thought. The zucchini strips she brought were also overdone to the point that they were brittle. When the server brought the check, she said she was only authorized to deduct 20%. I asked to speak to the manager, she said they left for the evening. Further discussion elicited the news that the owner was in the kitchen. After additional jawboning the burger was removed. A week ago I had a scotch egg and zucchini to go. Both were inedible. Thanks but no thanks."}
{"text":"Disappointing first visit. A Saturday afternoon and the service was mediocre at best (not very busy at all at that time) just seems like the staff just wanted to hang and text or look out the windows. Though the server was pleasant, she never once checked in with us to up sell or ask about quality of food. Which, sadly, was not very good at all. The Cheeseburger 1/2 sub was more like Hamburger helper meets a sub role with fries. It was not cheeseburgers as it was broken ground meat, overcooked and bland. The other sandwich we had was a 1/2 steak sub that was really not even close to steak sub, it was overcooked dry meat and some fries on a sub. The costs were WAY too much for the items. The only positive seems to be a fair selection of craft beers. Oh and if you can look past the fact that the glass hasn't been cleaned in awhile please do help yourself to the popcorn. I guess its free, saw a few folks go up and get some but I couldn't get past the lack of cleanliness overall let alone that popcorn maker. I had heard so many good things about this place but for a sunny Saturday afternoon, I /we will never return. Go try it to see for yourself please. My opinion is only mine."}
{"text":"I am a fan for sure.  It was more like a 3.5 star rating because of the Thursday drink and wing deal.  If you buy a drink that is at least 1.50 or more, you can get WHOLE wings for 50 cents a piece.  Sauces are of course extra though.  The wings here are pretty well done, so if you don't like them that crispy, this probably isn't the place for you."}
{"text":"This place was horrible, customer service is the worst I have seen in a long time, the employees all go into another room and sit there a BS while the customers are out there waiting for service, the owner must be blind or just plain dumb, to let this go on. also the beer is way to warm, the mens bathroom is literally a couple feet from the kitchen, the kitchens is really dirty, I seen no one wash there hands when they were picking stuff off the floor or what not, it takes about 15 minutes to get a drink even if your the only person at the bar, that's how bad the service is,,,,, and the food sucks big time, burnt pizza, cold cheese poppers, STAY FAR AWAY ,,,,,,,,,,,, theses other reviews must be friends or family of the owner because believe me, I went there a few times to give them a shot and all the times I went there was the same, BAD, BAD, BAD......."}
{"text":"We've gone to Mr.Mike's for numerous years whenever we're in the area. However, upon our last two visits we found, to our dismay, the menu downsized. One item we loved (the Bus) is no longer available (ok there is a steak sandwich, not the same) and the pasta topped with a stuffed banana pepper is now a baked entree ().  The whole wings dusted with a side of the flavorful hot & sweet sauce are still superb though. That made us happy.  Love the pizza, too. The stuffed banana peppers had two peppers, (one the size of a jalape√±o) and were overpriced -- not worth the money.   The wings will keep us coming back. The staff, owners and clientele are friendly, attentive and make our visits very pleasurable. Our concern though is with new 'kids on the block', this establishment needs to step it up.  The kitchen is killing their business and the menu is lackluster . And this is stated with concern as we love to support local business."}
{"text":"This place is great they always have great service and great pizza!!!  The owner is always wonderful and pleasant! I stopped in and they were very accommodating as always!! I have to say if you have never been here you must stop in!! They have awesome specials and do their best to get you whatever you need!!                             Thank you for all your efforts!!!                                   April"}
{"text":"The food is actually pretty good, just your typical tavern food with an Italian flair and every time I have ever came here to eat I did enjoy my meal. The taco pizza is the best in town and there wings are great. So why 3 stars you ask........ the service. If you are in a rush don't come here, long waits at anytime lunch, dinner or even late with drinks it's a very slow kitchen......... but the food does make up for the wait."}
