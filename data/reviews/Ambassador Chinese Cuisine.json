{"text":"This restaurant has been open for around two decades.  Fifteen years ago, it was among the top three Chinese  restaurants north of toronto.  The main advantage here is the decor is high end tasteful.  

Also the dim sum wait for a table is among the lowest around here.  The servers are courteous and responsive.

The biggest drawback is that other than a few ok dishes like Peking duck, the food including dim sum are stuck between average and pedestrian.  

And the food is not priced average.  Not the most expensive, just a little high for the area."}
{"text":"I'm very pleased with what this restaurant provides in terms of service, food and comfort of seating. The Pecking duck is a must-try and they also have a good selection of dim sum. The food is fresh and tasty and the place is much cleaner and spacier than a lot of Chinese restaurants I've been to in the GTA. This is definitely one of my favorite restaurants"}
{"text":"This is one of my regular places for dim sum lunch and family dinner.  I know I can always count on Ambassador if I want to enjoy quality food and service.  The staff is always courteous to customers - the receptionist always greets incoming customers with a smile and staff always say \"thank you\" to the customers when presenting the bill (trust me - staff from some Chinese restaurants don't do this which I consider as very basic customer service)."}
{"text":"My family comes here for dim sum all the time, sadly not because of good food. This place is conveniently located, and they don't cram as many tables into the room, making it more spacious hence more comfortable to sit around. 

In terms of the food, I highly recommend NOT to eat anything shrimp related. Other things that have pork or beef in it are average and will fill you up. 

You may have better luck if you want any type of fried noodles, those are pretty good. :)"}
{"text":"After going to various dim sum places over several weekends, this seems like it's the best in Toronto. Everything was tasty, squid was fresh, I found the portions were actually quite big (like the size of a dumpling would be bigger than what you'd see at other places). I'm from Ottawa so for the same price that I'd pay back home, we got WAY more food at Ambassador and it tastes better too. Definitely visit if you're dim sum hunting."}
{"text":"I went there for a dinner celebrating the Christmas on our own as there will lots of parties thereafter.  Although the restaurant has been established for quite a while, it is amazing to find that the carpet is still very clean.

The waitress asked us for our last name and politely called us so.  When I foot the bill, I found that the bill was with my name on it.  Quite a touchy gesture.

It is a $$$ restaurant.  I browsed through the menu and found my dishes.  At the same time, I found them in the combo.  So I asked the waitress whether we could have it and she explained that we could, not just for the VIP members.

We ordered 2 different combos.  The shrimp fruit salad was tasty.  The shark fin soup and the other shark fin soup mixed with lobster were different in taste but both were exceptional.  The lobster steamed with garlic and green onion was the best as it was just done and the meat was so soft and delicate.  This could easily out beat any lobster restaurants.  The entrees which we ordered a vege dish and a sea bass, were exceptional as well.  The good thing was after the dinner I didn't feel thirsty at all.  I have been to other good tasting restaurants that have lots of MSG and made you so thirsty for the whole night.  This restaurant most likely used good seasoning.

The service was good.  The waitress always changed our plates.  One glitch was the Chinese tea can be improved to a better quality to match with its dishes.

Overall it is an exceptional restaurant"}
{"text":"Did NOT like this place at all. 

Horrible service and horrible dim sum experience. Items like steamed buns, came out soggy, and hot food came out as cold food. 

We didn't get served tea until we handed in the order form. Unfriendly waitress gave me the index finger multiple times when I try to get her attention. 

Maybe Ambassador is great before, but based on personal experience.. I think it's more like lunch at the ghetto part of China Town."}
{"text":"Simple but tasty Dim Sum, ordered from menus rather than displayed on carts. Above average quality and above average prices -- three of us ate a solid quantity of Dim Sum and the total was about $30 each, incl. tax and tip.

I'd be happy to go again, although I wish it were either closer or cheaper.

In many ways, menus are cheaper, but I can't help but wish there were carts anyway -- somehow it's part of the essential dim sum experience for me."}
{"text":"I like it here. The dim sum was pretty good, and orders came in quickly.  The food is just classic dim sum, without any fancy extra touches which I like. 
It's the pick and order kind from a menu (as opposed to carts--i don't even know where they do this anymore). 

Food for 11 of us was around $15 each, and we had A LOT of food."}
{"text":"Let start with the Bill :-) For 4 of us we spend over $90.00 plus tips over $100 total. Yes $100.00 bucks for 4.

The place is clean and the service was good. We got there around 11 am and our reservation was for 11:30. The place was pretty empty when we got there. Never a line up. By the time we left around 1. The place was quite pack. 

The food was not bad for 100 bucks dim sum. LOL. Mind you, I went to another place in Scarborough two weekend ago. We had 7 people and the bill was only 65 bucks. Hahaha. 

I would go back just because of the service and because its clean as I have mention. Dim Sum place usually a zoo on the weekend around GTA. Plus if you don't speak Cantonese good luck getting a seat even if you have # in most places. This place is the only DIM SUM place I have been where you don't have to be Cantonese to be serve :-)"}
{"text":"No better place in Toronto for consistent ,quality dim sum. Best I've had all over the GTA including Casa Imperial, Lai Wah Heen and Dynasty.  Excellent peking duck for dinner as well. I'm there whenever I visit TO and I'm usually coming from downtown."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner and I was disappointed.

Service was good initially, but as the food arrived the servers  disappeared. Perhaps because we got the corner table, they couldn't see us, but I had to get off my chair find someone to get the bill. Our tea was not refilled frequently enough either.

As for the food itself, it's similar to other places that I've been to. Our goal of the night was to have Peking Duck... it was good. I can't complain about the size of the duck. It was barely enough for everyone to have 2 servings. There is always a disproportionate amount of wraps to duck ratio... by the time we ordered more wrap, the remainder duck were already devoured since everyone was hungry.

Sweet and sour pork dish was disappointing. The pork was over fried.
5 Style Vegetable with Bamboo fungus was pretty good. Not too salty.

Overall I found the price quite expensive for the quality of food I got. I almost felt like they treated my friends and I as foreigners who never had traditional Chinese food before. I was quite disappointed.

P.S. I found this coupon for Peking Duck if you are still interested in trying it out... I only found this after the fact (http://www.dine.to/daily_specials_popup.php?RecordID=329&id=3126)"}
{"text":"They have a large selection of dim sum, but higher priced than average. 

I would recommend:
- steamed chicken and fish maw
- pineapple cha siu bun 
- The cantaloupe sago is a refreshing dessert"}
{"text":"best dim sum i've had in the gta!  i've been going here for years.

the restaurant is very clean and the food is not as greasy as other dim sum places.  the prices may be a tad higher than your average downtown dim sum place, but it's well worth it.  waits aren't too long and the service is quick.

i've only tried the dim sum plates, so i have no idea what the dinner menu is like.  stick with the dim sum and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"The dim sum in Richmond Hill/Markham, Ontario is far superior to dim sum in Chicago. Everything was made to order, fresh, and well-executed. The restaurant is large, spacious, and clean. The servers are friendly and speak English. Parking is a breeze. I can't think of any reason not to go here. Great dim sum!"}
{"text":"Outstanding service and pretty good food. Only issue was the constant uncomfortable hovering. I like that they're attentive but there's a fine line between being attentive and out right creeping!!"}
{"text":"It was not the best Dimsum I have had but it is a cut above the rest especially if you are used to Dimsum in NYC, 
We had Dimsum a few things I remember were Rice Noodle rolls with peanut sauce and The Peking Duck is a must try. Though there were more wraps than Duck. We had sweet dumplings. The wait staff wore traditional wait staff clothing that was clean.
Service was good and it was clean and the decor was nice. Highly recommend it for Dimsum. We did hear it is not as good for regualr Chinese meals but just for Dim Sum."}
{"text":"It breaks my heart to say this but Ambassador is running on \"fumes\" and its past glory.  For a higher end Chinese restaurant, the service and quality just isn't there on my recent visit.  We all know everything has gone up in price over last few years but if someone drops $50-70 a head here, how do you justify it when nothing stands out vs the moderate family oriented places all over Markham?  My biggest issue:  a typical 10 course dinner averaging $55/person should have a devoted attendee to serve out the dishes instead of everything being self serve.  Am I missing something?  It was not even a busy night when I visited w/ a big party.  Golden Court next door can still deliver overall and charges about same.   When I first started visiting Toronto 11 yrs ago, this was one of the impressive places then, very professional service and food quality that was 2-3 cuts above the typical."}
{"text":"Ambassador Chinese Cuisine is too pricey for my liking, but I have to agree that the food here is pretty good. I've come here numerous times and these are some of my favourite dishes.

Deep fried taro with pork and seafood: Ambassador's verison incorporates curry into the filling. The curry is subtle, but it's an interesting touch that makes the dish unique.

Crispy shrimp rolls resembles a longer and leaner version of the traditional spring rolls. It's served with a sweet sauce that adds a pleasant tang to the savoury roll. It's a playful, crunchy snack that's quite delicious.

Steamed noodle roll with deep fried dough: the balance between the velvety rice noodle and crispy, deep fried dough is perfect, and neither component is overly greasy. A sprinkle of chives and dried shrimps complete the dish with finesse.

Pan-fried noodle roll with XO spicy sauce: I love XO spicy sauce slathered on almost anything and rice noodle rolls are no exception! The rolls are fragrantly pan-fried and the sprinkle of sesame seeds and chives are great additions.

Steamed sweetened egg custard rolls: The custard rolls are moist and wonderfully (but not overly) sweet. 

Ambassador is a nice place to enjoy refined dim sum in an upscale, comfortable environment. Its steeper prices means the restaurant can't be my go-to dim sum place, but it's an occasional treat."}
