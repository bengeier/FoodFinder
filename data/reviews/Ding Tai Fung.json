{"text":"My favorite restaurant in the GTA, used to be, at least. I haven't been there since December 2005, so this is based on memory rather than current facts. 

It's very well-lit, very busy, and it's sometimes dangerous to walk from one end to the other given its crowdedness. There was never a time we did not have to wait in line, even on Christmas day!

I loved their Chinese dumplings. I loved their Shanghai-style nian gao, and their osmanthus flavored mini dumplings sweet soup (although that isn't really Shanghainese...?)

This place has nothing to do with the international Ding Tai Fung Inc. that's based in Taiwan. My friends went to the DTF in Arcadia and thought it's delicious. They need to come to this one in Markham that is Shanghainese, technically, to experience what the real thing."}
{"text":"Went here to try their Xiao Long Bao, they have three different flavors and all are very distinctive and flavorful. The flavors are your classic pork, if you are only going to order one this is the one to get. There is also crab meat, this is very unique and packs a sea food flavored punch. The final is scallops, this is like an in between of pork and crab meat."}
{"text":"Food: 4/5
Service: 3.5/5
Cleanliness: 3.5/5
Price: $$

We arrived with no reservation just after 4pm, so the restaurant was relatively not busy but still full of customers. The open kitchen by the back of the restaurant definitely caught our attention, as many chefs were making dumpling after dumpling.

The Dim Sum here seems to be served all day (yay!). I found the prices okay - nothing too cheap nor too expensive. There were many items that I had never seen or tried before so I definitely studied the menu for a good 10 minutes trying to figure out what to order. 

The ordering menu is all in Chinese, but the numbers correspond to their main menu, so it was relatively easy to order what we wanted. My main reason for coming to Din Tai Fung was to try their soup dumplings as I was very curious about them. But I couldn't help myself and order some pan fried dumplings as well, as they're my favourite. Hubby ordered a plate of sticky rice with shu mai as he loves sticky rice.

I found that most of the servers at the restaurant didn't speak fluent English, so asking for things took awhile. It wasn't anything difficult and ordering is really straight forward (just match the numbers!) so you won't have any trouble ordering. Overall the service was minimal; that is, they didn't check up on us too much, but we didn't need much else because everything was already on the table all set up.

#12: Inside the dumpling was very tasty and I liked this Dim Sum the best. It was very light but still flavourful. For some reason I expected the soup dumplings to be a little bigger in size, so I was slightly surprised at the size of them. Overall, the dumplings were really well made; hubby and I understood why Din Tai Fung was so popular.

#13: It was very juicy- the pork filling definitely gave it a big savoury taste and the soup broth was very delicious. We would definitely reorder both of the dishes! But I would probably try their other soup dumplings too.

#31: This dish I almost forgot to take a picture of! I don't have the full dish because again...we dove into it before I had a chance to take a picture of it. I managed to stop myself and take a photo of the last remaining piece before finishing it. Pan-fried dumplings are my favourite type of dumpling, so I couldn't resist ordering this. I was a little bummed that there were only 2 pockets for the price of $6.49, but to my surprise, the pockets were bigger than your usual dumpling, so each half piece of the pocket was big as any other ordinary dumpling. The combination of pork and chives are a big traditional classic, and the filling here was again, really delicious. Hubby and I really had nothing bad to say about any of our dishes because they were really good.

#21: These dumplings were huge! I had expected smaller pan-fried dumplings because that's the size I was used to for Dim Sum. Five of these were definitely enough for the two of us, and this dish was deemed hubby's favourite of all the dishes we had ordered. The outside was so crispy yet the insides were still soft and full of soup broth. That's what I found so cool? about this dish - I had never experienced a pan fried dumpling with soup broth inside until now...and oh they were so good!

#19: We ordered this on a whim last minute but I'm glad we tried it. At first, we were expecting sticky rice that we're more used to - wrapped in lotus leaf and stuffed with pork. however, what we received was quite surprising! It was in a dumpling form, and looked more like siu mai mixed with sticky rice. After eating all of our other Dim Sum dishes, I have to admit that this dish was our least favourite. It wasn't bad of any means nor not tasty; it was just something we weren't used to and we had too many delicious dumplings to prefer the siu mai. We later ate the rest of this at home and we found it good warmed up again. Would we reorder it again? Probably not.

Overall, our early dinner at Ding Tai Fung was really great! I could finally understand all the hype about the Shanghai Dim Sum restaurant and I definitely insist that you try it also if you were thinking of going. It was our first time trying Shanghai Dim Sum, and we're hooked. I wouldn't say it's my favourite Dim Sum restaurant in Toronto because in my books, Lai Wah Heen still holds the crown; however, Ding Tai Fung is special because it specializes in Shanghai cuisine and soup dumplings, something that many Dim Sum restaurants don't offer including Lai Wah Heen. The prices are more affordable than Lai Wah Heen though."}
{"text":"I used to take this place for granted when I lived nearby and now I miss it every day.  To think that some of these other restaurants are calling their  authentic is almost laughable when compared to the ones at DTF.  Their  and snow pea shoots are also amazingly tasty!  Sure, the wait can be long and the service could definitely improve but man, the food makes up for all of that!"}
{"text":"Whenever I'm in Markham, I alway go to Ding Tai Fung to quench my Dumpling cravings! This restaurant makes the best steamed pork soup dumplings! Its sooooo gooood and comes out hot and juicy the way i like it! They have a variety to chose from such as shrimp/pork, crab/pork or just the regular pork by itself. You can also see the cooks making the fresh dumplings everyday which is why they taste sooo good! Their brasied noodle soup is also excellent as well! They make their own home-made noodles which is even better because it less doughy and fresh unlike other places which use the packaged ones. Service is quick and environment is very clean, highly reccomended."}
{"text":"Their fried chicken was unreal, I would definitely go back for another. Comes with some sides too at an affordable price.  Dumplings were good too, lived up to the hype."}
{"text":"The soup dumplings are the best! The restaurant deco is very nice and clean.  We would definitely return here the next time we visit Toronto!"}
{"text":"I can't get enough of this place - especially now with the cold weather.  The siu long bao and dandan noodles are to die for.  The place can get a little packed and noisy like all authentic Chinese places so don't except fine dining here - just good food.  Come as a large group so you can try many dishes - you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Why is this restaurant called Ding Tai Fung, but lets everyone think it's part of the Taiwan Chain, Din Tai Fung (notice the extra 'G' in the name)?  The Din Tai Fung website does NOT list this as a location of the original.  They use the same Chinese Characters, but put an extra G.  I knew as soon as I saw the photos of the Xiao Lung Bao, as the original restaurant puts 8 per bamboo tray."}
{"text":"Not the best place for dumplings/food in my opinion. Prices are pretty high and food is meh for me. The siu long bao's and pan fried dumplings are not bad but I've had better. 

The spring onion pancake had too much flour, not enough onion taste ans not crispy enough. My family ordered the drunken chicken dish. This is one of my favorite things to eat but I was so let down how DTF served it. They only used sliced up chicken breast and the sauce turned into gelatin form halfway through the dinner. Not impressed. The only two things I enjoyed were the siu long bao and red bean pan fried cake dessert. 

Wouldn't come back here for good shanghai food and dumplings."}
{"text":"This place has still got it.  It was one of my first stops coming back home (there's no place like home!).  
Ever since I had their tan-tan noodles, I've been checking out places around Mountain View but nothing is as good as this place.  Tan-tan (or dan-dan on some menus) noodles are noodles in a peanut broth. Yes, it sounds a bit odd, but it's worth a try and one of my favourite dishes here.  It's not like peanut butter over noodles, if that's what you're thinking...just try it. If you like peanuts, I'm pretty sure this will be a winner. 

The other dishes - xiao long bao, green onion pancake etc are all still fantastic. 

Service is quick and the food is great - you don't know how good Chinese food is around Markham (and Toronto).  *heart*"}
{"text":"I love these xiao long bao (soup dumplings)!! A couple dollars more expensive, but we thought it was worth it.  The crab ones had quite a bit of crab meat, which was an unexpected surprise.  Plus you can watch as the employees make these dumplings at warp speed.  The atmosphere is very nice and clean.  Would definitely come back again next time we visit Toronto - unless they decide to build one in Houston's expanding Chinatown! =)"}
{"text":"After hearing how great \"Din Tai Fung\" is in Shanghai, China. I decided to drive up to have a taste.

This place is terrible. I don't even want to waste my energy writing this review, because we should of known this place isn't even the REAL \"Din Tai Fung.\" The word \"Din\" at this restaurant has a extra \"G\" in it!

P.S. Stop calling it Xiao Long Bao's, these are obviously \"Tan Bao's\" which translates to \"Soup Dumplings.\" Anyone that is Shanghainese that was brought up in Shanghai should know this.

P.S.S. This place should be closed down like those shops on Canal st. NYC for bootlegging the real Din Tai Fung."}
{"text":"China's famous dumpling chain has taken over the world for good reason. My absolute favourite place for Chinese food any place, any time. Xiao long bao, green onion pancake and Hong Kong style coffee reminicent of back home. I did question a few tables that were feasting on regular Chinese food since I was practically waiting for an hour to be seated and another 15 minutes to be served. Very picky with my hot and sour soup..not going to compliment just yet but I would totally reccommend it."}
{"text":"I wavered between giving Ding Tai Fung a 3 star or a 4 star.  In the end, I decided it was a 3-star Shanghainese restaurant + 1 star for the stupendous xiao long bao.  I've been here on many many many occasions and always come back for the xiao long bao.  All the other dishes, are, well, kinda average.  The pricing also makes this place slightly more expensive than your normal Chinese dining experience in the Markham area.  

But first the xiao long bao.  I cannot rave about this enough.  The dumpling skins are light with just the right amount of \"chew\".  Be careful when you take that first bite - if you're not prepared, you will end up with hot soup flowing down the sides of your mouth.  For that reason, I generally eat the xiao long baos in a spoon so that I can capture every last drop of that fat-filled soup.  Yum.  One order of xiao long bao between me and my partner disappears in several seconds.  I would recommend the crab meat xiao long baos as well - an extra $2.00 to the order, but very sweet.  

Outside of the xiao long bao, the other fare is good but average.  You can expect the standards here - red beef noodles, dan dan noodles, ground meat noodles, onion pancakes, etc.  They are all done well, but not spectacularly.  The noodles can sometimes be a hit and miss, with the misses being soggy noodles that aren't that appetizing.  I also found that it was priced a little bit too high for what you get.  For that reason, this restaurant would normally be a solid 3 star restaurant.  Good, but not amazing.    

As for service, it is efficient and pleasant, although I noticed better if you speak Cantonese.  

Bottom line: come here for the xiao long baos and an overall solid experience."}
{"text":"Consistently good dumplings in a very clean environment with fast efficient service. A must have are the baby soup dumplings, dumplings in chili oil and the pea shoot greens with King oyster mushrooms."}
{"text":"So, given the location of this place, it's not that likely I'll ever be back, but I have to review this place cos it's the best Chinese food I've ever eaten.

It's a little hard to find; driving thru the back roads of Markham we could have been (were?) out in the sticks, then we find ourselves in what appears to be an office park.  But then you turn a corner and you're in the middle of a big plaza with Chinese / Asian food places on all four sides.

The restaurant is heavily patronised by the local Chinese community, always a good sign.  Waited about 10 mins (c.8pm on a Sunday night).  The ordering system took a minute to figure out - you basically select your food from the menu and write the corresponding number on the order sheet.

For appetizers we ordered spring rolls and steamed dumplings; both excellent.  The meat in the latter was really good quality and juicy.

For main course, we ordered diced chicken w/ peanuts and paprika, sweet & sour fish and beef w/ Chinese broccoli, between 3 of us.
They were all excellent, especially the chicken dish.  Portions were generous without being ridiculous (you'll have enough for lunch left over).
Service was excellent and friendly, despite the 'local' nature of the place.  Good value too - $60 Canadian incl tip for three of us

If I'm ever anywhere near this place again I'm going.  I love Chinese food, however it often does not love me back, but nary a rumble this time - just pure eating bliss"}
{"text":"Amazing! mini xiao long baos have the best skin to meat ratio! So good!"}
{"text":"Probably the best soup dumplings in Toronto. But their other food is par at best. My spicy peanut noodle was kinda sad. not spicy and not nutty enough for me."}
{"text":"Extremely poor service! Don't eat there!

My family and I were waiting for a table for 4 for at least 20 minutes and the next table would've been our turn (our number is 68)
A man walked in with his family and asked what's the current number (67) . The man said his number is 64 and the hostess told him '\"we've passed your number but I can circle your number back.\"  I looked down and saw on the list that his number is also table for 4. I immediately told the hostess that since it's already now 67,  my family should be seated next as our number is 68. The hostess did not say anything and walked away.

Another ten minutes gone by and a table was available. The hostess called up 64 and my family and I were clearly upset.

We told her that this is unfair as number 64 already left the restaurant and we should be seated instead.  Another hostess came over and tried to help out her coworker and insisted that the guy had informed them that they needed to step out and will come back for their table 

I said this is impossible because his number wouldn't be scratched out if that is the case. They then said someone made a mistake and scratched it. 

The people who were waiting (all the tables for 2) even said this is unfair because number 64 left and that my family had been waiting for almost half an hour (with 2 toddlers). One thing for sure is we will never go back again if that's how they run their business."}
{"text":"Our friend recommends this place to us.

The restaurant is new and clean. The food is also tasty esp. their Xiao long bao. Their dim sum menu is a bit limited regarding the variety though. That might be because they are Chinese (Shanghai), not Hong Kong."}
{"text":"Never had soup dumplings before, they were very juicy and burst with flavour. Onion pancakes were so-so. Beef brisket noodle soup was also very tasty."}
{"text":"Siu lung bao, xiaolongbao, XLB. Whatever you call it (except don't write it in Chinese because Yelp doesn't process CJK characters) It's hard to believe that a whole restaurant can be built on just simply steamed dumplings filled with crab or Chinese ham and pork and soup. Ding Tai Fung is built on such an offering and it beats going all the way to the \"official\" branch in Arcadia, CA or New York City. We had a few other tasty treats: stir fried dau miu, the tender green shoots of the pea plant; Shanghai style rice cake, very good flavor; a delicate seafood soup. Since it's located in a strip mall adjacent to the deluged First Markham Place, extremely difficult parking on the weekends unless you go between meals or very early or very late. Be prepared to wait."}
{"text":"This is probably one of the best northern Chinese food in Toronto 

Dumplings are their speciality because they made it on site, In front of you in an open kitchen. 
Their homemade beef with hand cut noodles are good ..
Their onion pancake is great tasting snd flaky. 

Only complaint is the wait....man, you wait unless you book a reservation, 
The servers are attentive but they can be a bit abrupt during their peak hours, 

Food - great tasting, authentic
Service - good , not excellent
Value - great 
Ambiance - who needs that when they serve you home made soup filled buns for 5.49 

Tip: reserve a table and wear a thick coat in the winter because you may have to wait outside"}
{"text":"I used to like  going here for their food until I saw a mouse in restaurant.
sorry, just cannot get over it and have not returned since.  Too bad , cuz food was good."}
{"text":"Pros--
-Authentic soupy dumplings! The xiaolongbao is a must try. 
-The environment is clean.
-The food comes out pretty fast and waitresses are efficient. 
-The ordering sheet is in Chinese. However, the menu has English and pictures of some dishes. 
-There is a large window so you can watch the chefs making the dumplings. 

I recommend trying #11, 12, 13, 137.
11. Spicy dumplings. The quantity isn't a lot and is more meant to be an appetizer. 
12. Soupy dumplings with pork and chives inside. 
13. Soupy dumplings with pork and crab. This is my favorite! 
137. A dessert soup that isn't too sweet and a refreshing end to the meal."}
{"text":"One of the better restaurants in Markham, we must admit, but maybe not the absolute best. We always come to this restaurant as a large family, and the place definitely seems like a family/large group restaurant. We usually order their specialty, xiao long bao, which has yet to fail us. We also order green onion pancakes (oily but tasty), chinese doughnuts (flavorless [supposed to be like that] but a fun snack), various noodle soups (flavorful and not oily), and pan fried noodles and rice cakes (delicious). We recommend making reservations as the place is packed!"}
{"text":"Really good food, and it taste very fresh, as you see them make it in front of you, the only downsize is it is quite pricey. Don't order the dessert that looks like a big donut ball with powered sugar, that taste very weird, its the most expensive dessert there. Stay away from that. Order the classic flat dessert with paste inside"}
{"text":"On point! My friend took us here last weekend and it was just delicious. We had the green onion pancake, hot soy milk with crullers, 2 different kinds of soup dumplings along with pan fried ones and small dumplings in hot chili oil (my favourite), and a rather unique dish of egg whites with broccoli which I loved. This is a definite hit! I 'm craving it again"}
{"text":"I was going to give 3.5 stars out of 5 for this restaurant. In general, I like the dining environment and it is pretty neat.  You also get to use their wifi.  We ordered steamed buns with crab eggs and pork and chili sauce wanton. I am surprised that the taste is pretty comparable to the one I had in Shanghai.  But the Mei Cai Kou Rou (braised pork with preserved vegetable in soy sauce) isn't that kinda disappointing... I just ate the vegetables with the fried rice.  Honeycomb tripes are recommended if you can eat that.  In a word, it is worthy of going."}
{"text":"This is the best dimsum restaurant in Ontario, in particular for xiao long bao.

I have been to the upscale tokyo location of Nanxiang Mantou Dian (the restaurant which is infamous for the creation of the xialongboa dumpling). I have eaten the chef's special selection including sharks fin, abalone, truffle, crab ovaries etc. The most luxurious of xialongbao dumplings.. and I can say that the xialongbao in Ding Tai Fung are comparable in terms of taste. The ingredients are different, but the taste is of equal quality.

They are like little explosions of meaty goodness going off in your mouth. Go eat them now, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Not the best and definitely not reflective of their counterparts in Asia, but this will do for Toronto. The Xiao Long Baos are definitely worth the trek for a downtowner like myself, however, their other offerings tend to be pretty average or below average, especially for Markham. The wine chicken and the braised beef noodle soup are not worth ordering. The appetizers leave something to be desired as well."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place based on the other reviews but this place is overrated. I have 4 items the xiao long bao, that was okay, I've had better at various joints in NYC. The scallion pancakes were really good, crispy, flavorful not too oily. The egg roll things were pretty bland and the friend squid was chewy and flavorless. Local restaurants from Rochester NY does their squid so much better. When they say fried squid it is literally squid, batter, frier. I don't think they even bother putting salt and pepper on it. Maybe I ordered the wrong stuff. If there is a next time, I'll have to try some of the other dumplings that folks have reviewed here on yelp. For the prices they charged, I expected more. Also service was a bit terse, 1 waitress was super friendly and helpful, the other 3 dropping off food didn't say a word and just put it on the table and walked away...."}
{"text":"Had dinner here on a Friday night. Even with a reservation, we had to wait for a table coz the place is small and packed with patrons. I noticed a lot of non-Asian customers. We ordered the hot & sour soup, pork and crab meat xlb, veggie dumpling, fried tentacles, onion pancake, sweet & sour fish, chicken with nuts, shrimp fried rice, bread, and rice cake with red bean for dessert. I don't get the hype from my experience. 

The good:
Xiao long bao is very good! Thin dough, tasty soup and the crab meat one is delish!
Some unique menu items
Fast service

The bad:
Overpriced, tourist/foreigner pricing? Cost us $150 incl tip for 5 people!
Smaller portion
Food was okay, I tasted better
Hard to park close to the restaurant, a bummer when it's -30C windchill outside!

Good to try once at least."}
{"text":"Really amazing dumplings!

I was in Shanghai a year ago and had my first ever xiao long bao. Now Ding Tai Fung has them and they are as good as I remember the ones in Shanghai were. They come out piping hot and you are sure to scald your mouth on the soup inside them if you try to eat one right away. We also ordered the BBQ pork & green onion wraps, vegetarian dumpling soup (the the dumplings were so excellent that you forgot there was no meat in them!), the rice dishes were also really good. The pan fried Shanghai dumplings (wor tip) are also tasty and really filling.

I noticed that many tables ordered a dish with white medallions, maybe scallops, I'm not sure, but next time I go I'm going to ask what it is and order it! It looked like each one of those tables was really enjoying it.

This restaurant is in the Woodside plaza on Hwy 7 and if you've ever been there, you know how crazy the parking lot is. There is a large window in the back of the restaurant where you can see the cooks making the the dumpings - lots of fun even for an adult. We had a large group and so made a reservation but even with that we had to wait for our table to clear. The place is pretty packed on a weekend and if you don't have a reservation, be ready to wait for a table!"}
{"text":"Was craving soup dumplings for the longest time and decided to order take out. Bought about 50 for a party. I had to eat it as soon as I got into the car.. Man was it good! I can't tell which one is my favorite yet.. But willing to go in for a second visit to find out!  Once they got to the party and cooled down a bit it wasn't as good.  Soup seemed to have evaporated :(. Will return soon!"}
{"text":"Omg, the soup dumplings are fantastic! The flavor is just excellent!
I love the beef tendon noodle too! For dessert we had red bean paste dumpling. Sounded intriguing so we ordered and they were scrumptious! Everything about this restaurant is fantastic! This restaurant is probably ranked as one of my all time favorites! 
4 thumbs up (including my two big toes)!!"}
{"text":"If you love soup dumplings, a must try! But other than that, it's okay. Friendly service with a fairly big dining hall.

Din tai fung Markham is comparable to Din Tai Fung Taipei. Having been to both I must say we do our dimsum right. 

I've been to Din Tai Fung during brunch and late dinner time. They serve fresh made to order at anytime of the day you decide to come.

Soup dumplings are pack filled with pork, crabmeat, or whatever you decide to order. (There is one with beef and sticky rice, it was too dry for my liking)

Sui mai is a little different here. Not your typical thin yellow wrapping. Wrapped in their house made wrappers filled with soup and pork topped with shrimp. 

Their zhajiang was a bit of a dissapointment which is why the 4 star."}
{"text":"I dreamed about their food, oh what can I say, it's like Chinese food heaven!!!
The wait was awful but you gotto pay for awesome food, time and $$.

Please go if you are close by (even if you are not)"}
{"text":"Well well well, what have we got here?

Fried Squid: 5/5
Salty Soy Milk: 4/5
Spicy Dumplings: 3/5
Sweet Sticky Rice: 2/5
Savory Sticky Rice: 3/5

One ideal bit about soup dumplings is that the skin has to be thin or else you're just not having a good soup dumpling and is compared to eating a little bun instead. This place certainly meets the expectation and even excelled in that category. I've tried other places before and this really is by far the thinnest skinned soup dumpling spot I've had. Prices are okay, place is spacious, food is solid. The only disappointing thing is their spicy dumplings. It missed the mark but the rest of the items on the menu definitely pulled its weight and brings this joint to a 4/5."}
{"text":"This restaurant is my favourite for dumplings. I always try to come here when I'm in the area, but the lineup for a table is always crazy long. So try to make a reservation if you can."}

{"text":"Had a fantastic dinner at the Scarborough location which is super clean, spacious, and nicely decorated. We had a delicious meal. We were so busy eating I forgot to take photos. Our favourites were (surprise surprise) the Xiao Long Bao (pork soup dumplings) and the Shanghai Spicy Wonton (YUM!!) And the shrimp egg and ham fried rice. Eluded the Soufflé Red Bean dessert which was made fresh. My niece was fascinated by the open concept of the kitchen where she watched the men making all the dumplings. They were great and gave her some dough and she tried to make her own! She was thoroughly entertained. Overall a great dinner and we will definitely be back to try even more things in the menu because the dishes we saw going to other tables also looked excellent. There's also an epic Asian grocery store (Best Co) and the parking is free."}
{"text":"They removed my review last year. Again, I want to say that this place made my friend sick on bed for 2 nights and 3 days due to serious food poison.
 
I still remember what we ate: xiao long bao (steam pork dumplings) which were obviously not steamed well; wine chicken; etc.
We should've kept the receipt and do a formal complain. We learned our lesson this time.  

Later on when we pass by this mall again tried to look for another restaurant, I saw a \"dead bloody baby rat\" on its front door (see attached picture - but the site removed one of the two picture because one pic is the close up of a dead rat) You can imagine how clean this restaurant can be. People are still ignorant and just went straight into the restaurant not knowing a rat was on the floor! 

Enough said."}
{"text":"This place has some good Shanghai food. Its a bit pricier than average, but well worth it IMHO. Its very busy at lunch/dinner on the weekends though."}
{"text":"** DO NOT CONFUSE this location with the real Din Tai Fung in Asia***


As for the food its medicore and the soup dumplings on Spadina are probably better but this place is not worth the drive or the wait."}
{"text":"Why do I always order too much food here?  

This is my go to place for soup dumplings.  Every time I've come here for lunch, the food quality is consistent.  The variety of items makes it easy to order too much food.  Soup dumplings.. yes please, beef brisket noodle soup.. yes again,  pan fried dumplings, chive pancakes, hot and sour soup, noodles, beef pucks, the list goes on and on.  Why must I always order everything that looks good.  

How to stop myself from ordering too much.  The formula I try to use is 'number of dishes' = Y x 2.  Where Y is number of diners.  Never order more than 2 dishes/person.  The difficulty is following the formula.  Once again, I've ordered too much."}
{"text":"This is my \"go to\" place for soup dumplings, you can't get any fresher than them being made right in front of you.  It amazes me how this place is constantly busy, yet the service is mediocre at best and downright  rude in some cases when you are made to feel like you have inconvenienced your waitress when asking for a tea or water refill.  The dumplings are that good that I would  allow myself to disregard service completely just to get my fix.  4 stars, all for the food."}
{"text":"I am not an expert in Shanghai Dim Sum but by the looks of the long lineup each time I venture here, this place must be good.

The décor is cool in the sense that you can see the chefs making the dumplings through a window. Also, the place is slightly more upscale than your typical Chinese restaurant due to the nice washroom and table setting. 

I also found the service great!  The manager came to explain to us what each dish was about and took the time to help us select a set that will please our taste buds and yet, allow us to experience Shanghai Dim Sum at its best. I have had this sort of cuisine only once before in Hong Kong while on vacation. 

We ended up with scallop soup dumpling / chives dumpling / wonton with XO sauce dumpling / beef noodle soup / red bean pancake.

I LOVED the beef noodle soup (hello minced salted vegetable!) as the broth was just perfectly spiced! The beef was so tender and the noodles were chewy (yet soft). My second favorite dish was the chives dumpling followed closely by the scallop soup dumpling. I have to say that the wrap is AWESOME - not starchy but yet doesn't break apart. The wonton was ok but I didn't think the seasoning was as good as the other two (I could have eaten the others just by itself due to the excellent flavor of the stuffing). I guess I should have figured that out considering XO sauce was a component of the dish. As for the red bean pancake, I didn't like it (hence, no picture). I would get the puffy red bean ball next time."}

{"text":"Food was always good, service is a bit to be desired.  Price is a bit slighly higher than average Shanghaiese places, but I suppose with the higher quality, it is worth it."}
{"text":"Very disappointed to have family gathering in this place during my visit to Scarborough, Ontario.  
Service - 4 starts
Food - 2 stars

This place should not have the name of \"Ding Tai Fung\". 
Ding Tai Fung in Los Angeles, California taste 10times better.
Go some where else if you want to have some Xia long boa.  
Even other noodles dishes or sweet sour ribs, not good!
Just disappointed!"}
{"text":"This place is the best Shanghai food I've ever had. For those that have not had this type of food, it's great for sharing.

1. xiaolongbao. It is this tiny round dumpling with a piece of moist ground meat mixed with spices swimming in it's juices inside the dumpling skin. The skin is so thin and has just the right about of al dente. Perfectly steamed and always comes up hot. Goes really well with a little red vinegar and a touch a ginger. 

2. beef tendon with spicy noodles in soup. The soup base is so powerful and with all the spices. Few have noticed but this is one of the few places that put veggies in our soup.

3. preserved cabbage with pork and rice cake. This dish is sweet, and sour and salty and it just bounces off your palette like a ping pong ball. The rice cakes are nice and chews, pork brings out the sweet and the preserved cabbage add the sour and salty. It's perfect.

4. pan fried meat dumpling. It's exactly like the xiaolongbao but it's long with thicker dumpling skin and fried perfectly on the bottom. The stuffing is the exact stuffing they use in the xiaolongbao. This dish is so good. 

5. onion pancake. OMG it's crunchy! Salty and chewy in the middle. It's packed full of green onions, the most amount of onions I've ever had in this type of dish. My mouth just waters thinking of this dish. If you're not that hungry it makes a great snack. Just order take-out."}
{"text":"I went to this place 4-5 times only. Every time I said to myself I will give them a second try. But the same outcome.  They made the worst sweet and sour soup, it is totally dark black color, with a lot of soya sauce in it. There were no much ingredients inside. I also tried the sweet and sour spare ribs, I was so surprised that it was deep fry with a lot of flour. 
The dumplings were just okay.  I had much better Shanhai food from somewhere else.  Never will go there again.

Surprise that there were always a lot of customers inside this restaurant. I think people enjoy seeing the kitchen with glass window, people can see through how they make the dumpling.

They are also overpriced."}
{"text":"Good place for soup dumplings. Well any type of dumplings were good. My fav was the regular pork ones. We got the pan fried ones. The ones with buns. The noodles and fried rice were also good. Jelly fish was ok. Even the hot and sour soup was good. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Not bad-not extremely good either. Had regular dim sum foods there, nothing very special."}
{"text":"Ding Tai Fung is a very famous chain of restaurants originating in Taiwan, and it has a golden pedigree for its Xiao Long Bao Soup Dumplings. I actually did some research and found out that this particular location has no real affiliation with the iconic brand, but I was definitely expecting a lot from a restaurant that dared to pay tribute to such a famous restaurant.

    Now let's start with the dish that everybody flocks to when they think of Shanghai: the Xiao Long Bao soup dumplings. An interesting fact about this restaurant is that they make all their Xiao Long Bao wraps and noodles from scratch inside their open concept kitchen. I really appreciate the fact that this restaurant that takes their time to make these ingredients fresh, and I think you can really taste the difference in both the texture and the flavour. The filling was very flavourful and the soup just filled your mouth with satisfaction.  We enjoyed these dumplings so much that we ordered seconds!

    For the rest of our meal, we had the beef pancake roll, as well as the Shanghai stir fried noodles, the Jajangmyun noodles, and the stewed pork with preserved vegetables.  Overall, I would say that many of these dishes were under-flavoured."}
{"text":"Horrible service.  Very disorganized and the food took forever to come out...in fact, some orders never came out at all and we just gave up.  To top it off, after paying by cash they didn't return the change & receipt...they automatically assumed the tip, which would have been way too high given the experience."}
{"text":"Guotie is terrible. Xiaolongbao is ok. Annoyed by so many flies in the restaurant. As a shanghainess, can't agree that this is a Shanghai dim sum restaurant. Won't come again."}
{"text":"this place really sucks. xiao long bao were not good at all. the beef noodle soup was super bland. the beef rolls come cut and cold despite being still wrapped in foil."}
{"text":"Xiao lung bao compares with the genuine Ding Tai Fung version I recenty tried in Taipei. 

The service is above par for a fast-paced Chinese eatery."}
{"text":"My favorite stop in Markham on the way home to Montreal. Also some food shopping  in the same mall.  I love all the soup filled dumplings. All!!!  I ordered the Pork and shrimp dumplings and the Pork ones.  Broth was amazing inside the dumpling and the filling was very flavorful.  Just learn how to EAT these \"siao long pao\" properly, you bite the top first...then suck out the yummy broth!  Don't just BITE into it and spill the delicious broth everywhere.

Crazy busy, if you show up after 11AM on a weekend, you won't not only find parking in the lot at all, you won't get in for at least 30 minutes, and the waiting area is super tiny so you'll end up waiting outside."}
{"text":"This place had really good dumplings. I really enjoyed the dim sum items :
 - steamed soup dumplings 
-steamed shrimp and pork dumplings 

I tried a couple of other dishes and they were OK but this place is a great spot if you just want dumplings."}
{"text":"As a true Shanghainese, I honestly don't recommend this restaurant if you want to try something real Shanghai.
As soon as I stepped into this restaurant, I noticed all the servants seem to be Hongkongese or Taiwanese, and most of the customers look like not Shanghaiese, which gave me a bad feeling. The prices of the food are really overpriced! Usually in Shanghai, a serve of xiao long Bao is about 10 to 15 yuan, which is like 3 dollars in CAD, but here it's 8 dollars per serve. Even considering its Canada here, I still know some other Shanghai restaurants where the prices are more reasonable. Then we ordered a mini Xiao Long Bao, a fried dumpling(??? and a fried buns(????. When the fried buns came, I and my wife were scared, how can this thing called ????The fried dumplings were even worse. The mini xiao long Bao is also bad.

This restaurant is really a poor simulation of Shanghai dim sum. And the price gave me a feeling of the owner just want to make money and doesn't care the food itself. Don't even try it!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice now. Once with my parents who've spent a considerable amount of time living in Shanghai. I also spent a semester abroad in Hong Kong where I tried the Silvercord branch of the real Ding Tai Fung in TST (the first branch to get a Michelin star), as well as one of the branches in Taipei itself. I also had the opportunity to frequent some competitors such as Crystal Jade.

So at a high level, the Markham ripoff isn't as great as the Asian locations, but is still very good. Key differences from Asia are that it's significantly less busy in Markham, it has a much broader range of menu items, and it's cheaper - even on a purely nominal basis. In terms of the xiao long bao themselves, the soup is more oily and the skin isn't as thin/fresh.

That said, I reiterate that this place is very very good, and probably the go-to in the GTA. I've had the traditional, shrimp, and scallop xiao long baos, green onion pancakes, shrimp/pork shiu mai, shrimp/pork dumplings, spicy wonton, pan-fried buns, beef noodle soup, soy milk, fried dough, and some of the veggie items. Everything is consistently very good; it just doesn't 'wow' you after you've had it in HK/Taipei."}
{"text":"Great food and great prices are the top items here.  We made it over there for dinner on Monday night at around 7:15pm.  The entire place was packed and stayed packed until we left around 9pm.  This was just a great Chinese restaurant.  There were only two of us and we got about six items, which I will say was about one item to much.  We were both stuffed when we left.  Everything had great taste and good presentation.  If you have a large group I strongly suggest you giving this a try it is really a fun event with a large part as you can get a wide selection of foods."}
{"text":"Always crowded, even on a Tuesday afternoon -- usually a good sign. Dim sum is more expensive than surrounding places but is fairly unique and well worth the extra money. My favourite items personally would have to be the beef tendons with chili and of course the soup dumplings -- they don't skimp. Open dumpling kitchen so you can see the preparation as it happens.

Green onion pancakes are also tasty, but they can be a little dry, so put soy sauce on them before eating. The pan fried vegetable dumplings contain obviously high-quality filling and are stuffed.

Marinated bamboo is a little on the thin side, so hard to pick up, and a little mushy. Still a good healthy filler to eat inbetween dumplings.

Overall a good experience."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here this past Monday night and it was packed. Even groups with reservations were kept waiting, so keep that in mind if you plan on going.

Overall, we were pretty underwhelmed by the food. Maybe we ordered the wrong things, but everything was pretty mediocre and we couldn't figure out why everything seemed so expensive for the quality. 

We ordered the soup dumplings, shrimp & pork dumplings, pork buns, steamed Chinese broccoli, diced chicken fried rice, and the fried squid tentacles. We enjoyed the dumplings, which came out first, and then everything went downhill from there. All of the other dishes had some kind of issue with their preparation. The broccoli was really undercooked and difficult to bite through, but the light garlic sauce was good. The pork buns were also undercooked, and some of the bun was gooey as a result. The fried rice was bland, and there were maybe 10 pieces of diced chicken in it with way too much oil - and certainly not worth the almost $14 we paid. By far the most regrettable dish we ordered was the fried squid tentacles which were way too tough to be edible. They were really disgusting to us, and we love squid.

Needless to say, this place fell short of our expectations and did not satisfy our cravings like we thought it would. Although we enjoyed the dumplings, there were too many other misses for us to consider returning."}
{"text":"Hey! pretty good dumplings (Xiao Long Bao). They have an open kitchen where you see a bunch of people making your dumplings. 
The dumpling's skin doesn't fall apart and the soup is contained within.
I also like the soybean milk (get it sweeten). 
We also tried their bamboo shoots with pork, not bad. 
Along with some flat noodles. 

I would highly recommend this place if you are in the mood for some Xia Long Boa. I heard it gets very crowded easily, we came when they open so we didn't have to wait."}
{"text":"I ordered steamed pork buns (xiaolong), pot stickers (guotie), and fried pork buns (shengjian), all Shanghai style. The steamed ones were OK. Pot stickers were made in a northern China style and fried pork buns were totally different!!!

I was born in Shanghai and have had these for more than 30 years.What I can say is that they don't know how to make Shanghai style dim sim. And overpriced as well."}
{"text":"Yes, this is not the real Din Tai Fung, since it is a knock off with the extra \"g\" in the name, but it is a decent place to eat.  It is not nearly as good as the original I went to in Los Angeles, but it does satisfy my cravings while I visit Toronto.

The English menu is quite confusing, since they probably used a translator who had minimal English training.  If you want to know what to order, it is just the first 3 items on the dumplings section.  Yes, they did state them as \"steamed buns\", but they are not steamed buns at all.  The real steamed buns are at the end of the list.  These three are actually the restaurant's version of the famous Juicy Dumplings of the authentic Din Tai Fung.  While not quite as good as the original, they are the best this restaurant has to offer.

We tried a variety of dishes, from the fried rice, to the wonton noodles, to different types of dumplings  (the second of the pork and shrimp dumplings is actually the Siu Mai, while the first is similar sealed dumpling), everything was very average tasting.  Only the juicy dumplings were good.

The service was ok.  By Chinese restaurant standards, I guess they would be nice, although a bit inattentive.  The lines are always long.  I guess if I had a craving, I would return to this place.  Otherwise, I would wait to return to California for some more authentic and better tasting dumplings."}
{"text":"Let me just start off by saying that I am a white person that greatly enjoys Chinese food here, in Toronto, so I will not be able to provide any opinions on authenticity, etc. 

Nonetheless, being the gwai lo that I am, I really, really love this place. I've explored about 80% of restaurants in the downtown Chinatown and this place, on the outskirts of my Toronto existence is worth the travel ALL THE TIME even though I have easy access to some delicious Chinese cuisine much closer to home. 

This place is packed basically all the time, which is already a good sign and the dumplings are consistently delicious. The menu is filled with a large selection of pork dumplings but don't let that fool you because they also make delicious noodles (like Shanghai noodles, my fave) as well as a selection of rice and soups. 

I would advise to explore the menu and a few times we've just picked random menu items and ended up finding out about a new and absolutely lovely dish. Ordering some veggies is a great way to pace yourself if you're into eating lots of meat, which this place offers, no doubt. Also, the vegetarian dumplings, whatever is in them, are amazing. So order that too. 

This place is clean, quite organized and very quick. I've been in here when the place is packed and the line up is out the door and the wait was around 15 minutes, just like they promised. Their turnaround is astronomically fast and they clear and prepare tables within seconds. So the service is good. I bet it's even better if you speak the language though. 

This place is great for large groups and also for couples as they have tables of all sizes to accommodate their diners. You also see families dine here, which someone raises the bar for this place in my opinion. 

so just go and eat some dumplings and all will be ok with the world."}
{"text":"OMG! I finally found an acceptable soup dumpling place near Toronto to fill the soup dumpling void I felt since I left NYC with no access to Shanghai Cafe. I wish this place is downtown so I can go all the time!

The pork soup dumplings (xiao long bao) are great, the skin is thin and has a slightly elastic texture, the filling is moist and soup and flavorful (lots of pork fat in there). 

The other dumplings are good too but not super duper, we had the shrimp and pork Siu Mai which was 3X the size of a normal siu mai, the meat was good and shrimp is fresh but I found the wrapping a bit too thick. The boiled pork and shrimp dumpling was nice and again was significantly bigger than a normal size dumpling and the grilled pork dumplings were yummy.

A serious miss was the sticky rice and pork dumpling because it had practically no pork and the thick wrapping plus rice was a bad combo. It was carbs on carbs and was bland and had a displeasing texture.

The tripe dish was good, the tripe was tender and flavorful, but it was loaded with grease (it leaves oil marks on your plate and was literally dripping in oil).

Overall, the place is clean and the price is affordable, we were stuffed for ~$13 each. I will return for the soup dumplings and probably not bother with any of the other dishes. I just wish there was a downtown location and that they steamed the soup dumplings on Napa cabbage like people traditionally do (I like to use the cabbage to cleanse my palate) (they steam on paper here)."}
{"text":"Love it. Been a gold standard with our family for ages.

This place specializes in dumplings. Been part of a mixed family I feel bad for a Caucasian family that is exploring that ends up missing the focus of the menu, which is essentially the first two sections- skip all the usual recognizable dishes. They have all these various dumpling styles, which are similar but very different. 

Pan Fried, small, big, various centres. The cold tofu, sounds horrific, I love it. The pan fried turnip cake is groovy. What else....

Bring your kids, I send them to the window where the dudes are making dumplings, the kids get handed some dough and that occupies the gap before food comes. They also have a STUNNING aquarium. It's the size of a small computer monitor, but the owner has invested serious time on it; it is really deep in detail including live coral.

We've been there 40 times? 40 to go!"}
{"text":"My reaction when trying xiao long bao for the first time: http://bit.ly/TtLSId

I wasn't sure what I was expecting but the texture of the XLB surprised me. The soup inside was slightly thicker than I had anticipated. Wish I had eaten it sooner... by the time I started working on it, it was lukewarm temperature. My bad!

The green onion pancake was A+. It was not overly pan-fried and the inside was moist and chewy. One of my favourites!

Deep fried silver rolls came with condensed milk. The outer layer had a hint of sesame flavour and the inside was a little dryer than I'd like it to be. Can't really say it's my thing.

For dessert, we had mango pudding. This dessert is actually 3/4 milk pudding and 1/4 mango puree topped with a cherry. I found the milk pudding to be overpowering and couldn't really taste the mango. 

We also had pork and shrimp dumplings, pan-fried pork buns, spicy and sour soup with noodles and pan-fried dumplings. No complaints there... just average stuff."}
{"text":"No one can beat their Xiao Long Bao (soup dumpling) in GTA. The one-bite size is my favourite as the juice won't spill all over the table. Soy milk (hot, cold, sweet and salty) are good, can taste they are freshly made at the restaurant. Sticky rice roll (usually order with hot soy milk) is very good. Pan fried dumplings are also good, same for spring onion pancake. 

However, their noodles dishes are so-so, same for the main dishes. Food is a bit pricy and you have to be early to be ahead of the crowd if not making reservation. 

It is worth going once in a while."}
{"text":"If the spelling error is intentional, then that would explain the discrepancy in taste of the xiao lung bao (xlb) here and the din tai fung in taiwan, the original, and the ones in Hong Kong. 

The xlb in the taiwan stores are drop dead great! Hong Kong slightly farther away. But the ones here although good, are only passable compared to the ones in asia. The taste is quite off and the soup is too hot. A perfect bun/dumpling should be eaten whole. no bitting. if it burns, it is wrong. (sounds sexual or sensual? intentional .... lol...)

All the other traditional stuff here is also very canadian-ized and good but not great... eg, beef noodles (a taipei classic), minced pork noodles, tan tan noodles, long beans, snow pea sprouts, chinese gyozi (pot stickers) ..... all getting to the poor level as we move down the scale...

And i remember coming here since the early 1990's, so... but had never been to the taiwan and HK stores before, till recently. What u don't know ....

it was however still very good value compared to asia, C$80 for 5 people! (standard in HK is C30 a person) .. but no booze here... no license? the real din tai fung would never have allowed that!

Din Tai Fung may just have to sue...... LA and Settle appear to be the only two official north american locations!"}
{"text":"This is not the original / world renowned Taiwanese Din Tai Fung. However their prices is less than the original Din Tai Fung operating in the United States (I know because I been to them in LA/Seattle). You still get good dumplings, noodles and rice."}
{"text":"Ordered some Shanghaiese small dishes on a Thursday night, and would rate all the dishes as a 4-star on its tastiness.  The soup dumplings were good, but not sure if it would be worth any long wait compared to other decent but lesser-known Shanghaiese restaurants that does dumpling in house.

Service was so-so.  Chop sticks were sticky, and thought they could have brought out the dumpling first instead of after a vegetable dish...

We also noticed something in the kitchen that bothers us but might not matter to you.  We were seated inside 20' from the open kitchen, and we noticed all of the bamboo steamers were reused directly without being even rinsed first.  We watched the young chef who took a stack of used steamers, simply hand removed whatever was left, replaced it with a new sheet of paper and was sent right back to the dumpling queue!!

Food tastiness - 4 stars
Service - 3 stars
Cleanliness- 2.5 stars"}
{"text":"This is definitely the place to go for dumplings, the reviews are all true. Even a non-pork eater like myself, who is limited to two varieties of dumplings here is a huge fan, that has to be saying something.

There is some discussion on whether or not this particular Ding Tai Fung is actually a sister of the restaurant in Shanghai, and the other locations worldwide. According to their website, http://www.dintaifung.com Canada is not listed. Either way, my SO's Shanghai-living relatives give this DTF a visit when they are in town.

So what hasn't been said below?

- incredible \"vegetarian\" greens and leek dumplings. Even the non-veggie dining companions cannot get enough. 

- delicious braised bamboo shoots. We always order this first. Perfect with chili sauce. Their non-dumpling Chinese dishes are not bad either. There are shanghai style noodles, braised bean curd and some other delicious meals on the menu. The only thing I didn't like was a fried fish dish which arrived very mushy. Forgiven. 

- Fun for kids (and the curious) you can watch the dumpling-making live. There is also a fish tank with \"Finding Nemo\" themed fish species. Fun!

Ding Tai Fung is always busy. Be prepared to wait, and parking at First Markham can be difficult. Come at an off hours time."}
{"text":"As most reviewers already mentioned, dumplings are delicious. Go for the dumplings. Shanghai noodle was mediocre. 

A bit of a wait during weekend lunch,but it's worth it!"}
{"text":"This is our go to place for Szechuan, dumplings, and Singapore dim sum. Sure, there are other places that are better at some things but we've found this place to be very reliably consistent across the board. Mo Po Tofu, all types of dumplings, onion and oil pancakes, hot and sour soup, \"fish fragrant\" dishes, and Singapore style fried noodles are all our staple dishes and all sufficiently spiced (though perhaps the hot and sour soup could use a bit less starch). Service is snappy and the place is pretty fast paced and good for a quick 1/2 hour lunch."}
{"text":"Awful service! And the worst part is no one else seemed to be having the same experience , probably because I don't speak Cantonese or Mandarin. Will never go back food was mediocre at best. Besides bad service mediocre food at best."}
{"text":"Ding Tai Fung continues to be one of the most popular restaurants in First Markham Place Hwy 7 plaza.   During a weekend lunch time you're almost guaranteed to be waiting in line.  However it's popularity is justified since this restaurant delivers consistent quality.  

In fact, I find this restaurant's food better than what I had from an original Din Tai Fung location located in California, USA.

Props go out to our Canadian chefs in the kitchen

Everyone talks about the dumpllings.. ah yes - they are very good. steamed or pan fried they get it right.

But no one seems to mention this in their reviews, the fried rice.  I find their fried rice amazing!  It's 10.99 - a little more than one would think of paying for fried rice. It pretty simple in terms of ingredients but the use of fresh rice, the preparation and taste is of 'master yoda' level. I continue to order chicken fried rice whenever i go here. It's the best fried rice i've had this side of the universe."}
{"text":"This place`s pork soup dumplings is by far the best I've had. It gets packed very quickly so i recommend going early. You can also see them make the food so you know its fresh."}
{"text":"Recommend to try Crab with Pork soup Dumplings & Veggie Dumplings. 

Don't suggest other entree. Don't waste your money.

Will I go back  again !? Just maybe."}
{"text":"Last time we wanted to eat here and there was a long line up. We were early today so we beat the line. But this time eating here, I was not as impressed as before. Aside from the 'xiao long bao' that was good, the other dishes were only ok. The 'Shanghai-style Pan-Fried Minced Pork Buns' were not bad, it was still steaming hot when it arrived. The major disappointment was the dessert - Chinese donut wrapped with red bean. The dough was not puffy at all, and the red bean stuffing was still cold, like it just came out from the freezer and haven't had enough time to thaw. Not coming back here!"}
{"text":"Ordered a few dishes from here yesterday, food was okay but they come in such a small portion that u'll actually be disappointed. The food aren't great and not really the best Shanghai place I've been. The only recommend is the sticky rice side dish. The services are okay, places are comfy and nice."}
{"text":"One of the best places for xiao long bao, it's hands down my favorite item on their menu with tons of soupy goodness in each dumpling! I've been coming here for years. I do think something has changed, as they used to be better than they taste now...but they're still good enough to keep me coming back! The pork is my favorite version of it, I love the flavor pork grease and all! The crab version is decent, it's good if you want something lighter and less greasy, but if I had to choose only one it'd be the pork for me.

The other food items on the menu are tasty too, but nothing particularly amazing. To be honest if it wasn't for their xiao long bao I don't think I'd really have much of a reason to come here over one of Markham's many other asian restaurants. 

Be aware that it can get busy for dinner times, and you may have to wait quite some time for a seat if you do not reserve. Prices are reasonable, ambience is a little noisy but not overwhelming. They have a little glass section where you can watch the chefs hand make some of the food items which is pretty cool. Service was average but the food comes reasonably quickly, which was good because we made a reservation and were ushered to the back room where we were told there would be a time limit of 1.5 hrs.

TL;DR:  Great for xiao long bao and if you were having a craving for dumplings that day, otherwise there are other better options in Markham for asian cuisine."}
{"text":"I went with my family here for lunch last month. Food was good. Unfortunately, when we were paying our bill, we realize they are over charging us by 7%. We told the waitress politely, she tried to convince us that is how they calculate taxes in the restaurant. She continued to educate us about taxes while I have been here over 20 years!!!

So my sister went over to the cash to let them know. The person returned our money. However, my sister saw the cashier continued charging 7% more on other people's bills."}
{"text":"One of the best dumplings in town. But be aware that this place can get super busy for dinner so prepare to wait for quite some time. Their xiao long bao takes the spot light! Each dumpling bursts with soup and they were so delicious. 

We've also tried other items such as their shiu mai, pan fried dumplings, spicy wontons, green onion pancakes, Shanghai style noodles, sticky rice, spare ribs just to name a few. They were all tasty and flavourful. 

Service was quick and servers were attentive. Highly recommend this place but be prepared to wait in line."}
{"text":"I have been here twice now, the service is quick and the dumplings are delicious, especially the soup filled ones."}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp and tried it with a group for lunch. The food, service, and ambiance are all very nice. I will be going back again and again."}
{"text":"Quite busy here when we came on a Sunday.  Nice window area to see the cooks make the fresh dumplings. We ordered black bean beef sirloin, Shanghai noodles, chive pancake and sticky rice siu mai (which could have used more flavour).  But the best dish was the pork soup dumplings/xiao long bao that bursted with flavour in your mouth."}
{"text":"Best dim sum in Ontario!!! But you need to arrive when they open or you will be standing in line. Their noodles are exceptionally light and tasty. Worth the drive from Cambridge for lunch!"}
{"text":"This is a pretty small restaurant, so you might wanna get here right when it opens (like we did) to avoid having to wait in line.

The xiao long baos with crab meat were good, but one of the ones I ate had crunchy bits for some reason - maybe the kitchen did a bad job with getting the crab meat out? Whatever, it was a minor issue.

The steamed shrimp dumplings were so good, much better than I expected. Big and plump.

Pan-fried turnip cake was alright, a little lacklustre. Would not order again.

The pancake-wrapped beef rolls were better than those from Asian Legend, but took a really long time to make and came out barely warm. Would not order again.

Red bean fried cake was really good. Not too sweet, really crunchy. Worth to note though, we were served this dessert before the beef rolls, which annoyed me as I like to end my meals dessert, not have it served in the middle.

Service was alright, depends on the person you get though. None of my family members speak canto, but we managed just fine with english.

There are plenty of Chinese restaurants/dim sum spots in Richmond Hill, not sure if I'll be rushing to come back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Just to be clear, this Ding Tai Fung is not part of the famous chain that originated in Taiwan.  With that being said, these soup dumplings were pretty good.  The wrapper is thin and there's plenty of hot soup in each dumpling.  However, the filling seemed to taste sweeter than it should. The bean sprout leaves that we had in addition were delicious though!"}
{"text":"A big fan of shanghai food. Not exceptional but food is okay for the price.  It's nice to see that the dumplings are made fresh via the window where you can watch them being made as you order.  

Food: 
I like the dumplings, the dumpling skin and think and the meat and juice inside is good proportion.  However, other dishes like the beef tripe noodle was too hard and not flavorful.  Most items are average taste with some being on the oily side.  As such, it's a hit and miss based on what you order.  

Atmosphere/Service:
It can get pretty crowded during peak times.  However, service is good, they have lots of staff on hand to serve you.  Clean bright place."}
{"text":"First of all, I want to point out that if you are looking for authentic Shanghainese fare THIS IS NOT THE PLACE. It is run by Hong Kongers, and Hong Kong-Shanghainese food is different from Shanghainese food. However, the crab xiaolongbao are fresh and delicious. I would recommend the xiaolongbao for authenticity (as approved by the bf), but the rest of the dishes are most definitely Hong Kong style Shanghainese food. Being from Hong Kong myself, I am a huge fan of HK-SH food because it's simply what my palate is used to. I love the fried 'leen go' and the sweet and sour fish. I have yet to encounter authentic Shanghainese cuisine in the GTA (probably the demographics of the Chinese community) but what it offers in terms of Hong Kong cuisine, it does well."}
{"text":"I must say.....I had a huge craving of dumpling but I could not find any restaurant in GTA till I come here.
I am huge fun of Chinese restaurant in US, such as chicken lo main if you are familiar with it.

All the dumpling we tried was......OMG....AMAZING!!
Xiao long bao, Shrimp Siu Mai,  Hot and sour soup, and PAN FRIED DUMPLING....!!
Great portion.

Best Chinese restaurant in GTA. 

However, the last few time we visited was disappointing with the service. Most of the time,  all of the dish served pretty fast within 20 mins. Hopefully, it will improve their service next time because they forgot to serve twice of our dishes we ordered."}
{"text":"This is some knock off. Not the real deal. Sub par compare to the original ding tai Fung chain."}
{"text":"I came here for the soup dumplings as noted by the hype since it's the only spot for soup dumplings in the GTA...major disappointment. Not worth the price. I'd rate the other dim sum items higher if I tried them."}
{"text":"This is NOT the original Ding Tai Fung franchise! Although the food was quite tasty, the presentation of it was quite bad. I came here with my friend for lunch during weekdays and they gave us really bad looking xiao long bao. It looked squished and did not have its distinct folds. I felt like they gave us the ugly looking ones because we were not speaking Chinese and thought we don't know what traditional xiao long bao looks like. Very unimpressed. During weekends, the wait time was very long. I would rather go to another Shanghai restaurant than this one."}

Restaurant is quite spacious once you walk in, but holy moly it gets loud in there. Tables are placed very close to each other but that's sort of expected at a restaurants like this. There were 5 of us and we waited around 20 minutes for a table.

Ordered: Steamed Small Buns 5/5

* 6 Xiu Long Bao for $5.99
* This comes super hot and is filled with even hotter soup so be careful!
* Key to eating these are picking them up on the top folded part
* Bringing it over your spoon and take a small bite to make a hole
* Pour the soup onto your spoon, drink it and then eat the dumpling
* This was the way I was taught by my Chinese friend
* This is served with the vinegar + ginger slices
* Their Xiu Long Bao didn't have that peculiar pork smell
* Skin was on the thin side which is ideal
* Probably the best Xiu Long Bao I tried in Toronto so far

Ordered: Steamed Shrimp & Meat Chinese Dumplings 3/5

* 6 pieces of the dumplings for $6.99
* This is similar concept with Xiu Long Bao but with shrimp
* I forget if this had soup inside it
* This dumpling tasted a little too bland for me


Ordered: Fried Dumplings 3.5/5

* 5 pieces of pan fried pork dumplings for $5.99
* If you are trying out a dumpling place, you gotta try pan fried as well!!
* This came very simple, similar stuffing to Xiu Long Bao
* Dumpling skin was chewy and a little crispy on the bottom

Ordered: Deep fried baguettes 5/5

* Deep fried baguette served with condensed milk for $3.24
* This was something I tried couple times before and I suddenly had craving for it
* It's something so simple but so delicious
* Baguette is super crispy outside and fluffy soft inside
* Dip it in condensed milk and it makes perfect dessert for me
* It's pretty hard to mess up this dish

Ordered: Stewed beef in Pancake 3/5

* Dish of beef in green onion pancake for $5.99
* This is a pretty standard dish at Chinese restaurants
* A lot of the times I have this when I go to beef noodle spots
* I found their green onion pancake to be a little too thin
* Beef was well seasoned and tender, it would've been perfect if the pancake was a little fluffier.

Ordered: Shanghai Style Fried Noodle 1/5

* Stir fried shanghai noodles with pork and vegetables for $10.50
* I was all against ordering this at a DimSum/Dumpling spot 
* But it was my lovely sister who insisted we order this dish (cause she loves noodles)
* And of course, I was right...this noodle dish was a bad choice!
* Noodles were over cooked and way too soft
* There wasn't much meat or vegetables...or much flavor to this dish

Ordered: Sliced fish with chili sauce 2/5

* Steamed fish slices with chili sauce for $13.50
* Again, my sister's idea to order some stupid fish dish
* This wasn't as bad as the noodles...but still not good at all!
* I take this chance to say...older people know better :D
* Fish was quite bland and to be honest I don't really like steamed fishes

Ordered: Stir fried bean leaves 4/5

* Snow Pea leaves stir fried with garlic for $9.99
* This is always a must order for my family whenever we go to Chinese restaurants
* The only way to ruin this dish is over-cooking it but Ding Tai Fung did a good job

Ordered: Deep fried squid tentacles 3/5

* Small plate of deep fried squid for $6.50
* Someone please tell me why deep frying things make it taste so good
* I know this was a random order as well but I was craving it
* Also it's hard to mess up deep fried squid
* It didn't have any seasoning in the batter so it would've been nice if it was served with a dipping sauce

Ordered: Spicy Wontons 5/5

* Bowl of small wontons with chili sauce for $5.99
* These are tiny wontons made with pork
* This was really good with just the right amount of spiciness
* Wonton skin was really thin which soaked up the sauce very well
* Must order item!

Summary: Always listen to your elders, stick to dumplings and simple dishes at Ding Tai Fung and you will leave happy with fully belly. Xiu Long Bao and Spicy wonton is a must order and make sure you don't burn your tongue from the soup!"}
{"text":"take out. tried hot n sour soup - was ok. Pricing ok - not expensive but not cheap. very nice looking dining area."}
{"text":"The food is delicious, no doubt about that but it is expensive. The service is good. I recommend ordering the pork xiao long bao, red chilli oil wonton (I think it's called), and soya milk. The warm soya milk is only $2 for a really big bowl. It is a place that you have to try though, the only downside is the price."}
{"text":"I have been eating at Ding Tai Fung for years for their xiao long baos. I heard rumours that this is not the real location from Shanghai, and in fact, the real franchise is called Din Tai Fung. Regardless, the quality of food has me convinced this is the real deal holyfield!

I love their crab and pork soup dumplings, the pan fried potstickers, the pork and leek soup dumplings, fried chicken, shanghai noodles, and dan dan noodles.

My last visit, I tried ordering the fried chicken, and the waitress looked at me as if I was crazy and claimed \" we dont have fried chicken and we never sold it\". Thanks to Yelp, I found a photo of someone who had ordered the dish, showed it to her, and she embarrassingly corrected herself and claimed it was a chicken cutlet plate. Maybe she is trying to hide the secret that although Ding Tai Fung is a dumpling house, they make some BOMB fried chicken. It comes with a side of marinated soy egg, rice, pickled mustard greens, and chicken-corn soup, all for under $10?!!!

Come here for some tasty soup dumplings, which warm you up on a cold day. I highly suggest you let them chill in a vinegar-soy sauce bath before eating. I assure you, that you will burn the roof of your mouth and end up spitting everything out. Yes, they are that Hot and my friend did not believe me."}
{"text":"I visited for dinner today for the first time. The food was bland and tasteless. Not at all how I remember shanghai food."}
{"text":"With the name of such a popular restaurant worldwide, this place truly did not live up to the expectation and hype. I came here for dinner last week and was presented with subpar dishes and service. This wasn't the first time I have been to this restaurant, and if memory serves me right, they had much better food and service back then, although the last time here I was much younger.

This time around, I ordered their Steamed Soup Dumplings with Pork Filling (Xiao Long Baos), Braised Pork Chop with Sweet and Sour Sauce,  and Stir-Fried Bean Leaves with Garlic. 

The Xiao Long Baos were decent, but for a restaurant who is popular for their baos, I was largely unimpressed. The dumpling skin was good, but their filling had the texture of meat similar to frozen dumplings I can get at the grocery store. 

Their bean leaves were salty and did not have enough garlic flavor. The dish was sloppily presented and was small. 

Their pork chops were merely strands of pork enveloped in fried batter in a bland sweet and sour sauce. My first bite into the pork chops was just a mouthful of batter and a McDonald's French-fry-sized strand of pork. On closer inspection, it wasn't just one piece that was like this, they were all like this. Typically, sweet and sour pork chop is served as roughly business card sized pork chops coated in batter, fried and drenched in sauce, at least a from what I am used to. It was so bad that I had to send it back in.

This is when their services started going down hill. The lady that wore a different outfit, presumably the manager, started talking and pointing at our table with the servers. We stopped getting services from the servers. Our tea was never refilled, our dirty dishes never removed, and before we even finished, they brought our check to us.

Overall, very unhappy with my experience and will not recommend or return."}
{"text":"Today I learned a new term: xiao long bao. It's definitely my culinary term of the week. (Term of the month is still \"pintxo.\")

Headed up to Markham for Sunday dim sum not really knowing what to expect, having gotten used to downtown / Scarborough Cantonese dim sum. 

Found Ding Tai Fung after a few minutes of wandering up and down the crazy-huge strip mall -- a spotless, bright room, with nary a plastic tablecloth in sight.

Ordered way too much food -- about five kinds of xiao long bao and dumplings, which all come in orders of six, pancake stuffed with chives and pork, baby bok choi, Chinese broccoli, and Shanghai noodle soup. And yet the four of us finished almost everything, save for a little bit of the soup.

The steamed buns were superb. My favourite was the one with crab meat, but I wouldn't turn down any of them a second time. The Chinese broccoli was perfectly steamed, not chewy or fibrous, and not mushy at all -- and that's certainly not a sure thing downtown.

One thing this white boy learned: let the xiao long bao cool a bit so you can pop them in your mouth and really enjoy the broth, rather than burning your palate.

Oh, for another trip to Markham soon!"}
{"text":"Soup in soup dumpling too salty. Beef noodle was bland. Not living up to its reputation."}
{"text":"If I could, I would give this place zero stars. 

First of all, this place is in no way related to the infamous Din Tai Fung in Taiwan. The manager claims that all their chefs are from Taiwan, but what came out of their kitchen proved otherwise. The drunken chicken appetizer was still frozen when it was served and covered in clumpy jelly (clearly just taken out of the fridge). The bean curd was tasteless and did not come close to what I expected. 

Most importantly, the reason why I give them such a low rating is due to how my pork bun was still raw on the inside. We alerted the manager right away, and she proceeded to argue that this was how things were cooked in their kitchen. If this was a Beef bun, I wouldn't have reacted so negatively - it is a severe health hazard if ground pork is not cooked thoroughly. (Please see attached picture)

After we complained about the bun, service went downhill from there. It took us a very long time to even flag down a waitress to retrieve our bill, and when it came, we were surprised that they still charged us for the raw Pork buns. We just left the Pork buns on the table, as nobody wanted to get food poisoning.

I don't understand why this place is always packed. Nevertheless, if you want to avoid a trip to the hospital without paying for the reason of your trip, I'd say STEER CLEAR of this fake Din Tai Fung."}
{"text":"This is my all time favourite Shanghai dim sum place! This was the first location I've been to. There's a second location that they opened in Scarborough on Commander Ave. It used to be called Xiao Long Bao, but they recently renamed it to Ding Tai Fung as well. This restaurant actually originated in Shanghai and move it's way across Asia to Hong Kong and then to Markham! this one is quite similar to the one in Hong Kong. 

This restaurant is located in the First Markham Place plaza. It gets quite busy as peak times (lunch and dinner). There's usually always a wait for this place during the weekend. Parking can be difficult sometimes. That's the only down fall. 

When you arrive they usually provide you with a paper menu where you mark off the items you want. The paper menu is all in Chinese. You can ask them for the English menu and they will provide you actual menu. You still have to mark off the numbers on the paper menu, which corresponds to the English menu. They also have chefs that wrap and cook your dumplings right in front of you while you eat. There's a part of the kitchen that you can see through a glass window!

The hot and sour soup here is a must get! The medium feeds about 2-3 people and the large would feed about 3-5. It's so good that i would recommend the large! The next item you must get would be the xiao long baos! They come in units of 6 for $5.99. They are steamed pork soup dumplings. You usually eat them with vinegar, which is provided to you on the table. The beef noodle soup is also very delicious here. The soup broth is very delicious and tasty! The salty stick rice and green onion pancakes are also very good here too. They're cheap and fill you up!"}
{"text":"I love Shanghai food a lot, and this is the BEST restaurant in Toronto! 
I especially love their Dim Sum, it's just mouth watering! 
The service is super good, very polite with pleasant smiles! 
I always go there for dinner, and they even give me free dessert! 
The food /dishes they serve are FAST, YUMMy and HOT! 
If you go there during weekends, it's better to call and reserve a table, otherwise, you might need to wait for a long time to get seated."}
{"text":"Okay the food, but just good for meat-eat people.
And the services are so-so.  If you wanna good service , comfortable, and good clean restaurant, don't go there"}
{"text":"Ok, before you everyone get too excited about this seeing a Ding Tai Fung in Canada. this is not affiliate with the Michelin 1-star restaurant in Taipei, which deserves 5 stars in my opinion, whereas a 3-star for this place. 

This place \"borrows\" the name and menu from the original DTF. Food and service are not bad for what you pay for inexpensive. I agree with most other review that the steam buns and beef noodle are worth trying when you go there."}
{"text":"We went to Ding Tai Fung for its fame in the area. What we tried here was:

1 - Xiao Long Bao (a.k.a. soup dumpling, very famous item here!)
2 - Green onion pancake
3 - Snow peas sprout and black(or Chinese) mushroom
4 - Spicy wonton
5 - Pan-fried pork dumpling

Green onion pancake was bad - dry and floury. Spicy wonton was not spicy at all - the sauce holding housemade wonton was the mixture of soy sauce, vinegar, sugar, and red chili oil - I can make it at home. #2, 4 are not recommended.

However, we were impressed by Xiao Long Bao (please google it, if you never heard of it) :) and pan-fried pork dumpling because each dumpling has great meaty soup in full flavor. So tasty, next time we visit this place, we are going to order dumplings only. :)

Also, Ding Tai Fung is a nicely renovated clean restaurant (my boyfriend who usually doesn't like Chinese restaurants really liked the upscale ambiance here, including washroom). We spent $41, without tips. Yes we are going back for more soup dumplings!"}
{"text":"steamed dumplings...ey?

i came all the way from NYC to have these steamed dumplings! a dear friend recommended us to this \"not so little hidden gem\"...  Ding Tai Fung Shanghai Dim Sum - located in a busy Markham strip mall, 35 minutes drive from downtown Toronto....it's well worth the trek!! we found parking easily, but from my understanding...you'd have a hefty wait on the weekends here...

Ding Tai Fung is the only restaurant in the GTA specializing in Shanghai dim sum (also known as Xiaolongbao or \"little basket buns\")....differing from the widely available Cantonese-style dumplings and buns, the Shanghai variety is generally larger, brothier and focuses on a variety of fresh ingredients and big flavor...

the restaurant is clean, austere and is clearly all about the food....closely packed tables leave just enough space for the servers to squeeze in and out with the orders, while a bevy of cooks behind the counter rapidly prepare the dim sum for baking, steaming and frying...

you won't find any dim sum carts here, everything is ordered à la carte and made as it is ordered!!!  their menu, offering over 150 dishes, is as extensive as it is authentic...i'm just glad my taller half could read the menu!! 

our meal started with some piping hot jasmine tea and steamed meat dumplings ($5.99)....these large, crested dumplings are so big they require some effort to manage with chopsticks....these were my son's first! now i don;t think, he'd settle for less.....if you can get one of these in your mouth, expect an explosion of succulence!! the dumpling skin is firm enough to hold the broth yet soft, without being soggy...
 
my next visit to Toronto, i know where i'm going to first!!"}
{"text":"Ding Tai Fung is located in a very busy mall in Markham, finding parking is a hassle so if you don't mind the extra walk, I would suggest parking further near the old Cineplex and walking over. We arrived around 5:30 pm on a Saturday and this place already had a line going almost out the door. We waited around 20 minutes for a table, so the turnover is considered quick. Now onto the food: 

For two people we ordered: pork soup buns (XLB), Shanghai noodles with cabbage and pork, veggies (gai lan) with pork and the beef pancakes. I would say the only redeeming factors were the XLBs and the beef pancake, those were authentic and yummy. However the noodles and the veggies with pork were pricey for the amount of food you got and it was quite oily. I feel like I could have cooked the noodles and veggies at home myself and it would have tasted the same.  For the 4 dishes, we paid about $50 after tax and tip. 

Service was typical of what you would get at Chinese restaurants, speedy but not over the top. Would I return in the future? Yes, but I would probably order more of their dim sum type foods instead of noodles and stir fry dishes."}
{"text":"We used to come here often but the last time was unbearably slow service.  After 40 min - we asked about the our order and they said will be out shortly.  Sadly to say 20 min later we finally got our food.  For the high food prices, we expected better service."}
{"text":"Never a disappointment. Arguably one of the best soup dumpling places in the city, but my personal favorite. On par with soup dumplings that i get from Shanghai itself. I always bring out of town guests here to enjoy some soup dumplings. 

The setting is very clean and organized. There is a giant window so you can see all the chefs preparing the soup dumplings and steaming them in their kitchen. 

My go to soup dumpling is the pork one. They have a large variety, but the pork is my fav. It always comes out steaming hot, extremely fresh and delicious. I also get the pan fried dumplings as well, very fresh, very tasty. My go to noodle dish is usually the shanghai style fried noodles (biased because i love this dish in general). I also love getting the bread, either steamed or deep fried, dip it in the condensed milk and you're in heaven. 

Often gets busy around dinner time, lunch seems to be a good time to walk and get seated immediately. 

If you love soup dumplings, this is the place to be!"}
{"text":"Came in with high expectation because everyone's been talking about this place. My bf and I ordered the shanghai noodles, braised beef noodle soup (suggested on yelp, so I thought why not?), xiao long bao, and an order of sticky rice with pork siu mai. The shanghai noodles came out first, it was decent but i had better. Everything else followed out after. Let me tell you, the xlb was very small, the soup was leaking out because they broke it before we even touched it, there was barely any meat inside of it. Braised beef noodle was bland to the point where I thought I was eating warm water/soya sauce with noodles. At this point I just wanted the siu mai to come out with a bang..... it was all just sticky rice, drizzle a little bit of soya sauce and left over minced pork, wrapped up in a wonton paper... disgusting. Bill came out $60-$70, would rather go eat at a food court somewhere instead. A BIG DISAPPOINTMENT. NEVER EVER RECOMMEND TO ANYONE. Btw, half of them were wearing gloves while wrapping the siu mai/xlb in the kitchen and at the table beside us... what's the point of that? Oh and service was garbage. Waitress just tossed us our cutlery and dropping chopsticks everywhere."}
{"text":"I watched some YouTube foodie videos of xiaolongbao and I all I wanted to do was try it! Lol OK so I tried it and i burnt the roof of my mouth. I guess I was too excited. The other dim sums also burnt the roof of my mouth cause I'm just not a patient person! Moral of the story is...don't set your expectations so damn high so you won't get so disappointed! Oh and also, be patient when eating dim sum with soup inside cause that shit it hoooooot AF! 

I liked it. But did I love it all? Not so much. Not for all the hype around it. I like my 2.99-4.99 dimsum spots better :p but hey- maybe you'll like it more than me ;)"}
{"text":"Ding Tai Fung is my go-to place for whenever I'm craving xiao long bao! I don't know any better places for it

This location is huge compared to the one in First Markham Place. Although it's much larger, they still get packed! I usually like to come slightly before the lunch hour because thats when they get quite busy and people have to start waiting."}
{"text":"Soup dumplings are my favourite but it's not different or any more special from the other Chinese restaurants.  The meats pies look good in pictures but they're tiny and not very tasty; I definitely wouldn't order it again.  Spicy dumplings are good but they're tiny so order more than one if you're sharing with 3 ppl."}
{"text":"Our son had a craving for Shanghai buns. So even though we had already had dinner, we came by past 10pm for a late night snack. I explained we would only be eating the buns, and they had no issues with that. We first ordered the small buns. After we finished them, we ordered the large ones. I would definitely recommend the large ones instead of the small ones, because they can hold more soup. When you eat these buns, carefully place them on your spoon so you don't lose the soupy juice inside the bun. The skins are perfectly thin and they are freshly made to order. It satisfied the craving!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty fancy looking. We were the first table there but the place filled up quickly! And this was a Thursday morning.

The XLB's were good. Didn't blow me away but it was good. You could see a chain of Asian men making them fresh as there is a see through window. 

My family enjoyed the soy milk. The rice rolls with pork shreds was really good. It was perhaps the simplest dish but was also best. The lightly fried pork buns were good. 

The braised pork with preserved veggies was not good. The pork was mostly dry and hard to chew cause some pieces tastes like wood. The veggies tastes off too. I've had so much better than this in the Boston area. 

My friends always visit this place when they go to Seattle so I was expecting a lot. I can see why they like it so much. There weren't many places like this in Seattle when I lived there. However, I really think you can do better in the many Asian restaurants found in Markham. Try a smaller place such as Sam's Congee Delight. They sell similar stuff and it's very good!"}
{"text":"Crowded place with quick turnover of tables. The food was tasty, especially the soup dumplings. Manager is constantly walking around and all servers will gladly stop to get you something. 

Took away stars because they did not bring one of our dishes, checked on it and still didn't arrive. Not a problem to cancel the order though. Then, ordered a large dish of vegetables which when we approached the bottom of the plate, found a piece of paper at the bottom soaked in the sauce. Possibly the paper was the order printed on it, I hope. Either way, manager called over and easily removed off bill without mention or hesitation."}
{"text":"Though this is a long way from the original store in Taiwan (they are unrelated), Ding Tai Fung is the neighbourhood go-to spot for the little soup dumplings.  They are extremely busy around dinner time and you may be expected to wait a few tables in their tiny waiting area.  In their defense, the table turnover rate is fairly high and it may only be 15-20 mins to wait 5 tables.

I like their appetizer menu much more than their entree choices.  For starters, their soup dumplings (Xiao long bao) is a must.  Other than that, their pan fried dumplings and sticky rice is pretty good.  On the contrary, their noodle/rice entree do not impress.  The Shanghai noodle dish has been getting smaller and smaller with little to no presentation."}
{"text":"This place really is the best in the GTA for soup dumplings. My first experience with Ding Tai Fung was at the tender age of 16 at the original restaurant in Taipei, Taiwan... where I had 3 LARGE bamboo steamers full of meat dumplings by myself (growth spurt phase). No wonder this place was ranked as the top 10 restaurants to try by the New York Times (back before it grew internationally) and also had a special on CNN. Then, my craze for the dumplings led me to their location in Singapore and HK (TST location which by the way has AMAZING SERVICE!) I am glad we have one here, so I won't compare.

This place is always packed. I just come here for the dumplings. My way of eating the precious pouch is with two bowls - one for dumping out all the oil and soup from the dumplings, leaving the other bowl for me to eat the skin (first) then meat (second) with vinegar. I always have the fried pork dumplings (lots of oil), fried onion pancake, noodles with vegetables, white steamed buns with condensed milk and their lovely and fluffy shrimp fried rice as well. My family goes through 6 bamboo steamers full of meat dumplings. No shame.

This place is popular and I can see why. The only 'hate' I have with this place is how much it wreaks havoc on my 'weight' as I invariable stuff myself to the point where I have a muffin-top each and every time after a meal!

2/30"}
{"text":"Ding Tai Fung is a solid spot for siu long bao and choi pong hai. I don't like their soup noodle with the peanutty sesame sauce (not quite flavourful enough) but their rice bowl with marinated fatty meat and rice is serviceable. 

In the far corner you can see staff constantly working away making more and more dumplings! Their potstockers are OK but I find the skin a bit thick, there are definitely better places for that. If you're a banana Chinese person like me and can't read Chinese, either ask for a menu and reference the # to get what you want or ask for an english version of their ordering sheet.

One cool thing about this restaurant unlike most other Chinese restaurants of this type is that they offer hot & cold HK Milk Tea and Coffee as drink options along with soy milk."}
{"text":"Rule of thumb for any good Asian restaurant. You know it's a good and authentic Asian restaurant when all the servers are Asians and everybody who eat there are asians. Which is true for this place. The kitchen here is transparent so you can actually see how your food is handled in the kitchen, which is pretty cool.
We got a lot of dim sum for 6 people and the bill came out to be like I wanna say around 100 cad (don't quote me on that). So in my opinion the price is quite reasonable. The dishes we ordered include homemade soy milk, jellyfish, chicken soup, pork and pickled vegetables, fried rice cake, dan dan noodles, fried rice cake with red bean and last but not least, xiaolongbao. 
The xiaolongbao is obviously the signature here (or should be) because the restaurant is shanghainese dim sum. The xialongbaos are exactly the way how I think it should be done, juicy and aromatic. Traditionally, you are suppose to dip the xialongbaos in vinegar with ginger in it. But I mean, you don't have to if you don't like vinegar. You can eat it the way you want it.
The small beef pies are also very juicy on the inside. One of the pork pie with Chinese onions (or leeks) on the other hand, is sort of dry, but I think it's intended to be dry and oily. It's a nice contrast to the beef pie. 
I would recommend putting the spicy oil provided on the table on the jelly fish because the jelly fish on its own is kind of bland and so it tastes more flavourful with it. Also, that's the way how my family always makes it.  
This place has english menu. See photos below."}
{"text":"All reviews I came across raved about one thing, the steamed soup dumplings, and as it turns out, with good reason. I'm a dumplings fan and this xiaolongbao is one of those things you just have to try if you enjoy dumplings. It's quite a dish a have to say. 

The integrity of the wrapper is such that I actually made a point to leave one dumpling behind to check how long it could last without the soup seeping out. It didn't. I lost patience and ate the damn thing. I put the entire dumpling in my mouth to savor all the juicy goodness.

I guess that's the only thing I can remember about this restaurant. I ordered some noodles and some other dish which tasted so-so and is now lost in the depths of my memory.

4 for the soup dumpling. 3 for everything else."}
{"text":"I got take away from here and Congee Wong 2 stores down for an impromptu family feast at home. It has been a few years since I've had their food.
- xlb
- Steamed crab and pork dumpling
- Steamed scallop and pork dumpling
- Shiu mai
- Beef brisket noodle soup
Would've been nice if they labelled the dumpling boxes as we had to guess which was which when we got home. The dumplings were good but I've had way better beef brisket noodle soup. I remember the food to be much tastier tho...Maybe it's better enjoyed at the restaurant, but the house was only about 15-20 minutes away.
Service was fast and there's a lot of people waiting for a seat. 
Will probably return after a few months with the family but only if we can find parking - very rare ;P"}
{"text":"Amazing crab and pork soup dumplings (or xiao long bao).  Such thin wrapping and flavorful soup inside each one.  $8 gets you 6 dumplings.  Had the turnip cake and that was served hot and crispy.  Shorter wait if you don't mind sharing a table with others."}
{"text":"My family went to Ding Tai Fung on a weekday at 8PM - it was still soooo packed! Where do all of these people come from? We waited for about 30 minutes for a table for 3. We got around 8 - 9 items for the 3 of us and that was more than enough. We had ordered the xiao long bao, green onion pancake, beef pancake, salty soy thingy - its like a congee (ham dou jerng), wor teep (pot stickers/pan fried dumplings), radish bao and one other dumpling which I don't remember. I was pretty excited to eat here because I've heard good things about DTF but I definitely don't think the dumplings lived up to my expectation. Steamed soup dumplings are supposed to be very juicy on the inside. Biting into a good dumpling produces a little explosion of soupy goodness but these dumplings were definitely under-performers. No soupy explosion here. If you're looking for a mediocre but clean restaurant for dumplings, DTF is for you. If you're on the hunt for the best dumplings in Toronto.... PASS."}
{"text":"Looking for near authentic Shanghai dim sum? You've hit the right place! I'd highly recommend ordering everything from the menu but if you're looking for the more popular dishes try the special menu.

Highly recommend the deep fried bread with condensed milk!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place but I was disappointed :(  

Ordered the pork dumplings with soup broth inside but found the broth to be really oily.  Ordered the shanghai style dumplings without realizing they were mini white flour pork buns.  The green onion pancake was okay.  The dan dan noodles in peanut soup broth was kind of oily and tasted too rich - the noodles were disappointing to me too :(

Maybe we ordered the wrong things?

After venturing out all the way to Markham and getting hopelessly lost trying to find the restaurant, I was sad.

The restaurant itself is a beautiful and modern space.  The place is bright and clean with high ceilings.

Staff is friendly but there was a bit of a language barrier.  The manager has a bit of an attitude and was not very welcoming.

Oh well :(

By the way, if you are looking for this place, look for the cineplex theater (the most distinguishing landmark seen from Hwy 7) - its buried deep in that general area."}
{"text":"What's common between the Ding Tai Fung in Hong Kong, Shanghai, LA, and Taipei? Answer: they are consistently very good, actually exceptional! That's the DTF name.

Coming to the Ding Tai Fung in Markham, I expected the same. Well...it isn't the same. It missed the mark. We ordered 14 dishes and everything was good but not great! 

What makes a good Xiao Long Bao? For me, 1) needs to be juicy 2) meat cooks just right 3) skin is thin but not to thin where it will break easily 4) serves hot and 5) The top of the bun is edible...some are way too clustered together where I would not eat the top.

The Xiao Long Bao here met all 5 of my expectations but it just didn't taste \"WOW\"...like the other DTF in cities I mentioned above. Don't get me wrong. Food was pretty good but with the DTF name, it wasn't good enough.

The only memorable thing is the soup noodles (4 stars). Everything else was just....eh....2.9 to 3.1 stars."}
{"text":"When it comes to Chinese food, I'm not usually the biggest fan of buns, dumplings, etc... Actually, I usually avoid that stuff.
 So I was pleasantly surprised when I visited this place.
The xiao long bao are delicious. Nice and soupy (although I think I would have preferred a bitttt more soup ). 
The shao mai are definitely my favourite- amazing stuff! I make sure to order this every time. It is not too chewy or too soggy, and the flavour is just right.
Dan dan noodles are good too- but I've always been a fan of those, at any restaurant."}
{"text":"Good dumplings, good service.  Dumplings are fresh, with soup inside.  They are made LIVE, so is not pre-package crap, and they let you see while they wrap the dumplings.  Price is good.  Best in TO."}
{"text":"tasty xiao long  bao, dumpling skin so thin you can see the juices/broth.  
need I say more?

place gets pretty packed around dinner time, so plan for an early or late dinner.  enjoy."}
{"text":"Bad service, bad food. Every single thing we ordered, apart from the XLB, was below average. We had notified server that the chicken was too way too fatty and dry on the inside - she said that was normal and it's supposed to be like that... Very interesting response lol. Not sure why this place is popular.. there are way better restaurants who serve better XLB with better menu items."}
{"text":"Not sure if I came here on an off night, but the xiao long bao were not even that great. I've had much better at many other restaurants. They actually came to my table a little dry... and not very juicy at all. The restaurant was super busy too, so it was definitely NOT worth the long wait for a table."}
{"text":"Arguably the best dumpling place in the first markham place this restaurant is always busy. It gets its namesake from a famous Taiwanese brand but don't be fooled - they are not an official chain (according to some gossipy chinese ladies anyways). Their faux branding notwithstanding the soup dumplings, green onion pancake and pot stickers are reliably superb, as are most of their other dim sum items. However, venturing out of dim sum territory might be hit/miss. I've ordered shanghai noodles, beef n veggies, etc and they were, at best, average.  Best to stick to their specialities if you want to have a great dining experience."}
{"text":"I am shocked and disappointed in the quality of the food here, during our visit for dinner. I've been to DTF in taipei (original one) and the two locations in Los Angeles, this is the worse one I've tasted.  The signature Xio Long bao is just average,  not the great, but the other items that are staple signature dishes to order at other DTF locations : shrimp fried rice, vermicelli soup with bean curd, soup noodle with spicy and peanut sauce,  all tasted below par compared with the other locations, plus their pricing seem to be inflated( $13 for a small plate of shrimp fried rice and it's soggy.....)vermicelli is supposed to have flavorful semi-CLEAR colorless broth, instead it's tasteless and have a dark brown tint(looks like the broth was made with soy sauce and water, and actually taste similar to that), soup noodle with peanut sauce has blend taste and soggy texture at same time, without some of the typical important ingredients such as minced green onion and garlic as garnishes on the top... I have been to this location before years ago and it didn't seem this bad....tremendously dissapointed and is far below any other DTF locations while charges more then other locations... will not recommend."}
{"text":"If you check the Ding Tai Fung's international website, they don't actually have a branch in Toronto. This one is just a copy of it. To be honest, the Shanghai soup buns were alright, I've had better at Joe's Shanghai in New York's Chinatown. We also tried the soy milk in hot&sweet, savory, and cold. It tastes powdery? After trying this once and knowing what it taste like now, I most likely won't return."}
{"text":"It's not by Shanghai people, the dishes were expensive (especially the vegetables) and did not taste good. I grew up in Shanghai, i know the taste is very different."}
{"text":"I really love xiao long bao and this place makes amazing XLB!! The skin is so thin and the flavours are just amazing! Their pan fried dumplings and XLB is my fave thing to order. They also have mini XLB which are super cute and its pretty much comparable to the original XLB. The price is not cheap; but not expensive. The restaurant is very spacious so you won't have to wait long for a seat. They also have a glass window in the back corner where you can see the chefs making the XLB and other foods. I come here pretty often, especially for dinner with my family."}
{"text":"2.5 stars. Overpriced and just okay. I've definitely had better Shanghai food elsewhere in the city.

I don't really know what the hype about Ding Tai Fung is when the food isn't even that good. Perhaps its the brand name but whatever it may be, it's not even that good. 

We went as a family dinner for 6 and we got the Xiao Long Bao (2 types), Pot Stickers (x2), Shanghainese Fried Noodles, Stir Fry Rice Cakes with shredded pork and picked vegetables, Steamed Dumplings, the Pan Fried Buns and the Sliced Pork with Garlic and Chili Sauce.

The Xiao Long Bao (Soup-filled Dumplings) were so small and not very flavourful. The skin was thin but I found it too thin and broke very easily in comparison to other places I have tried. What's the point of having soup filled dumplings if all the soup will drip cause the skin is so thin? Mind you, I am very good with chopsticks and they still broke.

The Potstickers were good and crispy. To be honest though, it's not very hard to make potstickers crispy....so it was as expected.

The Fried Noodles and Rice Cakes were way too oily for my liking and by the end of the meal, we could see the pools of oil on the bottom of the plates. A very big negative.

The Sliced Pork with Garlic and Chili Sauce was average. Nothing special. I kept thinking about the variations of that dish I've had at other Shanghainese restaurants and how much better they were...

Service was acceptable for a busy chinese restaurant. 

This is not my first choice for Shanghai Food, not even close."}
{"text":"Ding Tai Fung gives a whole new meaning to the term DTF! Never have I ever been more Down to Fund in my life, and I plan to Fung many many many more times!

Arriving late in the evening on Sunday, I was so hungry that I likely would have eaten just about anything but DTF doesn't serve 'just anything', no no, they serve wonderful little dumplings of wonderfulness. With 14 yelpers hungry after feeding themselves nothing but wine and sweets at an Elite event, the portions were Dun Torn to F&^% each time another platter was placed down. Seriously it was like watching a pride of lions dispose with an antelope.

That being said I managed to get my chopsticks on quite a few of the tasty morsels, well lets be honest I muscled my way into those morsels and destroyed each and every item put before me. 

The meal was a blur but a few items that stuck out to me were the potstickers and the soup dumplings... thanks to everyone for the lessons on how to 'suck the juices out\" of these. I can proudly say I am a soup sucking sensei! But really, these dumplings had the normal potsticker meat filling BUT also contained a serving of Hot soup inside each. I was warned that putting a whole one in my mouth would lead to certain scalding of the mouth - thank goodness I listened, you peeps were bang on. 

We also sampled a noodle dish which didn't \"wow\" me, a green spinach dish and a spicy shrimp and peanut dish (too many peanuts BUT delicious). 

I wish I could have properly prepare for all the DTF'ing goodness I was about to enjoy this night....but rest assured I shall return Down to Fung @ Ding Tai Fung"}
{"text":"- go here for soup dumplings aka xiao long bao (pork is better than crab IMO) 
- things are a little expensive.
- they take reservations, so you might as well make them - this joint gets busy"}
{"text":"While the Globe and Mail may claim that the \"smart money\" prefer 369 Shanghai Dim Sum, they are incorrect -- Ding Tai Fung is still the best place for xiao long bao in the GTA. Yes, it is not officially affiliated with the world-renowned Ding Tai Fung in Taipei, but they are almost as good (I have tried both). Further, Richmond Hill's Ding Tai Fung is also very good at all of its other dishes, producing top quality Chinese cuisine for Chinese locals. The dumplings are executed with near-scientific precision, with the ratios of ingredients being measured with scales. To write off Ding Tai Fung just because they ripped their name off of a famous restaurant would be a terrible mistake."}
{"text":"I must be a glutton for punishment.  I said I would not go back and I did today.  Salty to the point of kidney failure green beans and pork, almost tasteless \"spicy??\" wontons, greasy onion pancake, pan fried dumplings that were thick and doughy and tough, they could have been cheap no name perogies from the frozen food section!  and no sauce for anything.  When will I learn.  Only thing was it is near the place I was visiting.  Also, everything, I mean everything is dumped on the table at the same time, so let's talk about cold food.  Oh yes, the one boring little XLB Soup dumpling I ate had NO SOUP in it.  Not a drop.  Did I mention the bill was $48.00 for 2?  This place is horrendous.  $10.50 for green beans too salty to eat."}
{"text":"As a native from Shanghai, I was really excited to visit this place for some Shanghai food. However, the food was not authentic at all. We ordered multiple dishes and non of them actually taste like how they would taste in Shanghai style. The meat in xiao long bao was pretty dry and hard, whereas it should be moist and tender."}
{"text":"Real, decent ShangHai cuisine for sure. Clean, nice and spacious interior too, which is a plus for Chinese restaurants. We ordered 1 plate of shanghai fried noodles ($12.95) and 3 steamers of pork soup buns (xiaolongbaozi, $7.50/6 in one steamer). Pork soup buns were only tiny bit smaller than ones in china but had good amount of meat, and the soup was good too. I'm from a part of China where food is more spicy, but i do know it's real shanghai food when the fried noodles are slightly dark in colour, tender, with non-bbq'd pork strips and slightly bland in taste, also the hot sauce being on the soft side with no aromas. These are not bad points, it's real ShangHai food!! Servers are kind, are definitely proper Chinese servers, they are patient unless you ask for stupid stuff, remember you came for ShangHai cuisine. Washrooms are very clean, big thumbs up. Overall it's a bit pricey but hey it's authentic and it's a nice looking, clean restaurant, and you don't find that combination in Toronto often. 

Also the BestCo supermarket 2 doors down is very big and cheaper than T & T, so it's a convenient place to have a meal before going home."}
{"text":"3.5
Be prepared to line up if you come during the weekends. This place is always packed. 
Their soup dumplings are good but more expensive than the average dumpling joint. 
What I like though, is that the restaurant is clean and you can see the workers making the dumplings through the glass window. Always a vote of confidence seeing people making the food right in front of you. 
I would avoid the pan fried dumplings. They are a bit greasy and makes you feel gross at the end of the meal. Stick with the streamed dumplings for sure."}
{"text":"This place is horrible. Soup dumplings are pretty dry, no soup at all. Everything else was not really good either"}
{"text":"This place is as good as good as its current rating (at 4 stars). Lacks in service at times, delivers on food. Great dumplings!"}
{"text":"This is definitely my favorite place for soup dumplings in the GTA. The dumplings are filled with delicious meat with a flavorful soup wrapped in very thin dough.

!!!!!"}
{"text":"Maybe I just came on an off day, cuz my parents told me that when they went with friends it was better than when they went with me, but my experience was nothing more than mediocre here. The much acclaimed xiao long baos, were actually below avg in comparison to my past experiences. Even though that wasn't a big deal, and the green onion pancakes were yummy (hella greasy though), I lowered the rating for this restaurant because of this one dish i ordered. Im not sure what the dish is called in english, but its was basically beef with special brown sauce in this i guess pastry/chinese tortilla outer layer. But anyways, the dish was totally ruined because the chef decided to DROWN the thing in sauce. 

Another grief of mine is the price vs. portion size. We ordered 5 dishes, and ended up paying $45, making it roughly $9 a dish. However at the end of the day we were NOT FULL. However we were too upset by the beef dish, and fed up with the mediocrity of the restaurant to order anymore. I think at this price, and for the amount of dishes i ordered, I should at least leave feeling full.

A redeeming factor was the service i think. We were greeted by a very kind hostess, and a waitress who was friendly and polite.

Overall, I'm not sure whether my expectations were just too high, or I just caught them on a bad day. But frankly I think that  a good restaurant should live up to their reputation, and perform well all the time. Unfortunately I have to low score this restaurant based on this one bad exp, but hopefully if i return, I'll be able to update it to a more positive review =)."}
{"text":"????????????????????????????????
??????????????????????????????????????
?????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"This is a copy cat restaurant, nothing like the real ones i've been to in Taiwan. not even close! I hate the fact that they just copy a famous restaruant's name and trick people to go eat there! 

this place has horrible service, n food is very avarage, atmosphere is like a typical chinese restaurant, noisy, bad service, and dinnerwears are often not so clean.

if i want steam pork dumplings(Xiao long bao)  i'd go to asian legend, it's closest to the real thing.( still not good enuff, but it's all we can get in T dot. and at least they decorate the place nice + decent service.)

Don't waste your money on this place."}
{"text":"Well, I'm half shanghainese.. and I loveeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee Siu Loong bao! :) aka Xiao long bao , AKA PORK SOUP DUMPLING?? 

God ! you must try ! its almost as good as the Shanghai ones!

Also love the Fried porkchop and rice ! comes with egg and some vegetable sides!sooooo yuummyy!"}
{"text":"We had the pork dumplings, green onion pancakes, the red bean pastry dish, and the beef meatball dish, and we enjoyed it all!  We will certainly return.

The service was prompt, and everything was very clean.

The clientele was mostly Chinese, but there were also a lot of white dudes with beards, so I blended in quite well. ;-)

Since it's at First Markham Place, the parking is a disaster as always."}
{"text":"dumplingasm..........crab soup dumplings with big chunks of real crab meat.....LEGIT soup dumplings!"}
{"text":"Not your typical canadianized Chinese food! I went with a Chinese friend of mine and she informed me that the style of cuisine served here is generally from the northern region. She also said that this is very authentic as opposed to a lot of spicy and sweet southern style cuisine restaurants that we generally see around the GTA. 
I had the famous soup dumpling and I wish I could eat a 100 of them. I also had the crispy shrimp thing that comes with lettuce (you top the ice berg lettuce with the shrimp) and THAT was delish! I wish this place would open a second location in the west end of downtown so that I don't have to trek all the way to markham to get it! I would have to say this is one of my favourite chinese food so far! Highly recommend. 

ps. the decor is nice and bright, somewhat modern, clean and new-ish. The servers are what you would expect at a chinese restaurant. there is a bit of language barrier but the menu makes it easy to pin point what you want and while the servers aren't the most attentive or friendly, they are efficient and get the job done."}
{"text":"Is this the same as the Din Tai Fung in Cali and HK? I'm not sure, but their soup dumplings are to die for and I really really wish they'd open one in MA. Knowing that they make fresh dumplings and seeing them made, makes these little pockets of yum that much better. Chive pies, panfried pork buns, soy milk and fried dough, rice cakes with cabbage and pork, pranfried dumplings, three cups chicken, scallion pancake, dan dan noodles I'm not even sure thats all we ordered. I just kept eating and eating. not too sure about price...gotta love visiting family haha! but I'm sure it was worth every penny :)"}
{"text":"I'm sure most people don't know this fact but this place has the same name as a famous restaurant in Taipei, Taiwan. The problem is that they sell the same soup dumplings but are not affiliated with the original DTF at all.  The real DTF is so successful, they have locations throughout Asia and beyond...  NONE of which are in Canada.  This gives the feeling of bait and switch.  Not cool.

The soup dumplings are good, but they don't compare to the ones in Asia (let alone the true DTF empire).  Is this the best we can get?  

Overall, the food is pretty average and most dishes are over-priced.  

This restaurant is overrated."}
{"text":"Portions are small, prices are high for what it is - exactly the same as any other mediocre Chinese restaurant. Everything is just so so average. Would recommend going somewhere else."}
{"text":"This is the best place for dumplings.. period! I have been to lots of Ding Tai Fung. The shrimp sui mai is tender and the wrapper is just thin enough to cover the pork filling. Also the pork filling they use is minced so fine that it addes to taste of their dumplings. Just delicate and delish! Their hot and sour soup is super awesome. 

I had lots of dishes here and each time it never fails to impress me."}
{"text":"I tried this place with a Taiwanese pal and had high hopes. Everything was tasty, but frankly, nothing wowed me.  I got three types of soup dumplings and all were tasty, but I see no need to go back with all the other amazing option that Toronto and the outlying suburbs have to offer.   We ended up ordering at least 6 dishes for the table and nothing stands out during a trip with several memorable meals.  In sum, a solid bao joint, but if you have to wait, I would just try going to the food court in First Markham Place."}
{"text":"WOW. The Siu Loong Bao (soup dumplings) are INTENSE. Wrapping is paper thin. I ordered the small ones because the big ones are too intense and burn my tongue :(. MMmmm...aside from the soup dumplings, everything else has the same meat in it. These dumplings are a must TRY."}
{"text":"This place has really good Shanghai food. 

I went in not expecting anything at all (thought of it as just a typical chinese restaurant) but was blown away.

Me and my friend ordered a few things.

A. Started off with Spicy Beef Tendons for appetizers, i'm a fan of this.
Love how they cut them up into square cubicles, it was delicious.

B. Then ordered the green onion pancake, it was delicious and crispy.

C. Next is xiaolongbao (Soup Dumplings), they came really hot (temperature) and the skin was nice and thin. It was perfect and full of delicious flavour. Ate it with red vinegar and ginger.

D. Red Beef and tendon spicy noodles soup. The soup was nice, it wasn't too spicy or anything and was just simply a delicious bowl of noodles. The noodles are really good too, i think they may be hand made.

E. We still had room in our stomach after this so we ordered the crispy turnip pancake. This, like the others was also really good, had it with a bit of red vinegar as well.

Overall it was a great and satisfying meal, definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Wow! Dumplings I'm a sucker for anything doughy stuffed with meat! First impression when walking into the place 1- it was at capacity 2- me and my girl where the only colored couple in there (usually the case) haha... However, although it was busy we were seated rather quickly... When we received the menu we were sort of confused only because we couldn't  understand the order sheet since it was all in Chinese :-| but after further investigation I deciphered the menu and realized you just match the number from the menu to the order sheet. Service was good no complaints, food was delivered fast and hot, still want to try the steam pork buns if they have them after all they are my favourite! The price wasn't to bad either.. So all in all a good experience and I will definitely be back.."}
{"text":"Hands down best place for xiao long baos in Markham! Not as great as the original Din Tai Fung chain from Taiwan, but this will definitely do."}
{"text":"I am a regular here so let's get that bias out of the way. Here are a few tips to help manage expectations:

- call ahead and put your name in the que it will save you from a super long wait when you get there. Make no mistake though, you will likely have to wait 10-15 mins at a minimum. They only have about 4 large tables to accomoddate groups larger than 6.

-they have English language menus, just ask

-skip the shrimp and pork shui mai, I find the \"skin\"/exterior too thick on this in comparison to the rest of their offerings

-80% of dishes have pork or meat, like most Chinese restaurants...so don't complain about it being skewed in the carnivore favour

-fried onion cake, steamed dumplings with \"soup\" and Pot stickers are staples here and a must try

Like most Chinese places the service here is not a priority. They will get you what you need but will likely not follow up or try and make small talk. They will expect you to get up and leave shortly after your food is finished. If you want a refill on your thermal tea pot, just open the lid and leave the pot at the edge of the table."}
{"text":"I should start off by saying that I love xiao long bao and have tried it at various places from China to New York, so my standards for count as good xiao long bao might be higher than most people 's. 

Impressions: it looks like a clean restaurant with fast efficient service and a glass see through pay off the kitchen where you can see the xiao long bao being made. 

The actual cleanliness of the restaurant might be an issue. I had to get new sets of cups because the existing ones had a disgusting yellow crusty thing on them. Waiter changed the cups very quickly and it was taken care of quickly. 

There was a long line up when I got there at around 1pm. Very busy but you can usually get service faster if you agree to share a table with strangers. 

I went there specifically in the xiao long bao so I ordered only the 3 xiao long bao. They have it in normal pork, crab filled, and mini. I was disappointed with the crab filled. The skin was great, it was made fresh, with soup inside but there wasn't enough crab or flavour in my opinion. I've had better. 

Next were the minis. Add others have said I found this a complete waste of money. Yes they look awesome but I could never get full on such small portions and other than their size and cuteness there wasn't much to recommend them. For the money, I would say the pork xiao long bao was the best. Again, it wasn't the best I've ever had but it was fresh and there was soup inside the xiao long bao. The texture of the skin was also good. Doesn't break and not to thick. 

O veal impression is just an okay. I drove a really far way to try this restaurant and if it were close I might think of revisiting but since it's so out of my way I probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Best xiao long bao in markham. Food is fast and service is acceptable. Be prepared to wait for a table."}
{"text":"Ding Tai Fung, instead of Din - was actually a nice welcoming to Canada. In Toronto, the area our hotel is has a lot of Asian restaurants. We were seated promptly after our arrival and were immediately given hot tea. The food started to come out of the kitchen only minutes after we ordered which shows attentiveness and efficiency.

Being \"Ding\" Tai Fung, their dumplings came out first and this was the best dish of the night. They were sooo juicy and hot, we ordered 2 more batches. The wonton mein was average, the soup didn't have any flavor resulting in a bland dish. The rest of the dishes were solid, the high being the dumplings, and the low being the wonton mein.

Our food came out quickly and our tea and water pots were never empty. The service was great for a Chinese restaurant, and the food was above average. Try it, why don't you?"}
{"text":"We ordered xiao long baos, beef noodle soup and stirfried pea tips. All were delicious!! However I have to give three stars as we found a cabbageworm in the peatips dish.."}
{"text":"Food tasted good and probably one of the best soup filled dumplings I've had but both my husband and I had tummy aches after eating the food.  Been there a few times but not sure what we ate that caused us to feel sick.  Because of that we are a little afraid to return.  It's also pricier than the other dumpling houses."}
{"text":"is good. dumplings and noddles are fresh made in the corner where workers are working behind a clear window.  cool"}
{"text":"It's really more a dumpling house. If you are used to cantonese style dim sum, this place will be a little different. The dumplings were good, but I wouldn't go here for dim sum. Maybe dinner."}
{"text":"Come on,  who hasn't heard of ding tai fung.

Siu long baos are honestly, the best little bite of food a person can have.  Only problem is..  As much as I crave their side dishes,  dumplings and everything else..  The price is on the steeper side..  So definitely not a place to come to every weekend unless you got some monies to spend."}
{"text":"4 stars for the xiao long bao (little steamed buns filled with soupy and meaty goodness) and the chive and pork dumplings
3.5 stars for the green onion pancake
2.5 stars for the thick sliced rice sticks, and sizzling tofu plate

If we had just the xiao long bao and dumplings, this would have been a solid 4 stars.  They're so good, delicious and flavourful.  Served steaming hot, I wished that was all we ordered!  The rest of the order was a bit meh... too oily, uninspired, and the flavours just didn't seem to blend properly.  The effort was very much obviously reserved for the buns and dumplings."}
{"text":"This place is sometimes not that consistent but is understandable since it is always packed. Most of the time their xiao long baos are pretty good. I'd say their dim sum options are better than the other dishes. The service is pretty good. Would recommend for sure."}
{"text":"I chant and cheer D.T.F at the top of my lungs prior to leaving the city. Whoever is lucky enough to come with me on such an adventure will rejoice the name Ding Tai Fung!  Some city folk may think its too far for dumplings but trust me its worth the drive to Markham! This is my go to spot for dumplings....I crave this place more than a pregnant lady craves her pickles and ice cream.  

Its like a ritual when im there i have my order down to a science! First comes out a bowl of the best hot and sour soup, then i have the spicy wontons i believe its 10a or 10b on the menu. followed by steamed chive dumplings. Then i have to contain my excitement  eek i want one right now ...the best for last ... CRAB AND PORK SOUP DUMPLINGS! it explodes like a volcano in your mouth ... beware not to give yourself blisters for it is as hot as a volcano ;)

other things i will occasionally order are green onion pancakes, beef pockets, shrimp and pork sui mai

Everyone who comes with loves it! 

D.T.F 4 LIFE!"}
{"text":"Everytime I come out to Toronto, I have to make time to come to this one place for their XLB. I remember coming out here in the late 90's when I first ate here, and I haven't been back for about 2 years, and they still still are as good as yesteryear.

The one thing that you have to try, if your going to just order one thing is their Xiao Long Bao. I usually go with the regular sized one's, but I also order the mini's as well, and the dumpling skin is paper thin, to the point of almost see-through! I even once was so craving for it in Toronto that me and my cousin drove up from downtown to get takeout, and each dumpling was still soupy good.

The place still looks the same, as in, clean, brightly lit, spacious and modern. Definately not your hole in the wall, but even if it was, I'd still come back."}
{"text":"Really large selection of dumplings to choose from, it's fun to go and choose a different type each time.  Hot soy was also quite delicious.  The shanghai noodles were overly greasy and swimming in a pool of oil.  The sesame desert dumplings were ok.  Would probably go back to just try out its variety."}
{"text":"This is a decent place for shanghai style food. The crab and pork soup filled dumplings are what everyone should try at this restaurant. The pork is smooth and the hint of crab and soup makes this dumpling burst in flavour.

Other things I had that were pretty good include the onion pancake and the pork bean noodles. I would take a pass on the pork fried buns. It was good but not my favourite.

The food is on the pricier side for dumplings but worth it for soup dumplings!"}
{"text":"i've been to the \"real\" din tai fung in arcaida, and although i love adding to the hype that its worth waiting an hour in line for, best xlb ever, blahblahblah...

this place is pretty damn good too. 

the xlb are somewhat bigger here. (if you compare them to din tai fung and most shanghai dumpling places around the bay area)

the fried green onion pancake is awesome. 

its pretty yummy here. The status quo in toronto is higher or better, than those XLB's in the bay area. in my humble opinion. its worth a mild 5 stars... 

my mouth is suddenly salivating."}
{"text":"Since my last review 3 years ago, I discovered that this DTF is not real! It's not a Din Tai Fung. It's a DinG Tai Fung! Haha.

It's still great though. The xiao long bao (XLB) are still a must get. They must filter the soup because they have the right amount of porky flavor! I've had XLB at other places since and they are so nooby - they have that dirty porky smell still.

The hot chili wontons are also great.

We went overboard and ordered 7 more dishes - not recommended for a group of 3 people. The most standout dish besides XLB was the egg white and white fish with a little tobiko. I had never had this dish before, but it was delicious. It comes out with a yolk on top and you mix it all together for a flavorful, smooth but lighter dish.

We also got the seafood casserole - the broth in this was great. We also ordered a few other family style dishes - they were good but not outstanding enough to write more about on this yelp review!"}
{"text":"Xiao Long Bao and the dumplings in chili are enough reasons to drive from downtown.  Havent been disappointed by anything on the menu"}
{"text":"Not the greatest price point at a dollar a dumping, but totally worth a try. My mouth is watering just thinking about how juicy and succulent they are. Green onion pancakes were also good however, It reminded me of the same ones as the ones I purchase from TNT. Overall slow service, and not a bang for my buck. I feel like I should come back to try out other items on the menu, because my one time visit just wasn't enough to justify this place at anything higher than 3 stars."}
{"text":"Best place for shanghai dim sum! Love their xiao long bao! Their mini one's doesn't taste as good! The ice tea is soooo good! Also you should try the braised pork and the porc chop with rice! Great place, fast service! It's a must everytime we visit Toronto!"}
{"text":"They just offer decent  Shanhai cuisine, and shame on them of stealing the most famous restaurant name from Taiwan, and copying their business style.

Their soup dumpling just decent, steam vegetable dumpling is also average, also tried their steam pork bun, that's no good, vegetable steam bun is sucks, you can tell is was frozen too long from the vegetable inside.

Their service? not good at all, we seat their 15 minutes, the waitress not even come to check if we were ready to order, after we finished every other orders, our stir fry vegetable is still not available.

No, I won't visit this restaurant again."}
{"text":"A good place to get little steamed juice-filled pork dumpling (Siu long bao / Xiao long bao). That's about it. 

Almost always busy, wait time can be long if you show up when everyone else does. Maybe people like to come here and watch how Siu long bao is made? -- yes, they make them fresh in the kitchen, and you can watch through a large window. 

Siu Long Bao is pretty good, quality consistent considering this place has been around ever since the First Markham Place Mall was built. There are several varieties to choose from as well - \"regular size\" vs. mini; different fillings meat or non-meat. 

Other starchy dishes (noodles, green onion cakes, rice cakes) and dinner offerings are meh to a-ok. If you prefer HK/Taiwan style of \"northern\" Chinese food, I think you will find the dishes and taste familiar. If you are more used to Shanghai taste like how they do it in Shanghai, probably won't like it too much. 

I give it credit for being there for a long time, keeping up the decor, maintaining decent quality and fairly good services (for a Chinese resto). Give it a try if you are in the area or have a crave for Siu long bao.

Not related to THE Din Tai Fung chain of restaurants that's been getting Michelin stars for their famous siu long bao."}
{"text":"Really love this restaurant.  The place is clean, comfortable and brightly-lit.  The XLB was excellent, as well as the chili dumplings.  The soy milk was good too, we had both the savory and sweet ones.  The sweet one is only lightly sweetened, my friend asked for extra sugar but I find it just right."}
{"text":"Known for its dim sum, the portions are somewhat larger than in other places and considerably greasier with thicker dough. The varieties are limited and ordinary. The prices per item are about double what you pay for similar items elsewhere. If you just show up, prepare to wait as they give you a number. If you call ahead you go to the head of the line. The novelty is seeing the items made through a window to the kitchen. The noise is considerable. They are popular so there are surely many who think this is good - the regular dishes looked better than the dim sum. Try those and skip the dim sum and let us know what you think. I will not be back unless you like it."}
{"text":"This is northern chinese comfort food at its best! Everything is prepared and cooked with care. You can tell by how finely diced the meat is in the boa and dumplings and how soft and thin the hand made boa and wrappers are made.
This reminds me of my childhood, the stuff my grandma would make on a long weekend. 

The atmosphere is also very refreshing, lots of natural light, modern, clean and very attentive service.

PLEASE open a location in Downtown Toronto, its not fair only the Markham folks get to experience this amazing restaurant."}
{"text":"Fantastic. The food was freshly made on site and it was so nice to taste all the flavours. You can really tell the difference. It was worth the trip from Toronto to taste this great food."}
{"text":"I hold a special place in my heart for Shanghai cuisine. There are two dishes I can actually read in Chinese and both are mainstays (at least I think they are... they're what I always order).

My friend and I met up for dinner, and we had the soup filled dumplings, beef tendon noodle soup, vegetable dumplings and some bean curd skin with veggies and soy beans that I wasn't such a fan of. Everything else was delicious, and came out quickly. Service is brusque but effective. There are more tables for 10 people than there are for smaller groups, so if it's busy and you're a table of two, you may have to sit at a table with other tables of two. 

We ordered enough to take home and the bill including tip came to $40. 

I love this place. I'll definitely be back again and again."}
{"text":"TBH I've heard a lot of people telling me that this Ding Tai Fung is a \"fake\" one. But I have to say that the food itself is not bad. The place is clean and I like their glass wall which allows you to see their kitchen. The wait time for food is a little bit long though. It's more on a pricey side compared to similar places ( I know some places offer siu long bao for 0.99 or 1.99) but I have to say it worth the $$ and wait."}
{"text":"The best dim sum outside of Asia.   It's better than the real one.  Gets busy so go early to get the best picks"}
{"text":"Came here on a Wednesday night. The restaurant itself was decently filled for a weeknight. The restaurant was clean and had a very modern atmosphere.

In terms of their dishes, I found their hot and sour soup to be moderately spicy but not at all sour. Their Dan Dan noodles were good and had a lot of peanut butter sauce but was a little too salty for my taste. Their xiao long bao was hot and soupy, but felt like it was lacking in meat. 

They're also not the cheapest place around town. For a table of 4, we ended paying $70.

A very average meal that did its trick in filling me, but I've definitely had better Shanghai styled meals for a cheaper price."}
{"text":"Love it. Don't go because I don't want to wait to get a reservation. Best dumplings in the Bay Area."}
{"text":"This is my go-to place for Shangai-style food and especially soup-filled dumplings. They make it fresh in-house. I usually also get the green onion pancake, the beef roll (wrapped like a soft tortilla in aluminum foil), and a few different varieties of dumplings. One of my favourite dishes here is their tiger prawns (cant remember the name of it but I'll be back there tomorrow for lunch so I'll confirm) that's around $18 and comes lightly battered and crispy with this light cream sauce and pineapples. It's just awesome! It's at First Markham Place which is such a busy plaza at all times so parking can be tough. It's also a busy restaurant so I try to go during odd hours."}
{"text":"I liked the fact that they had a open view into the dim sum room- to show that they are hand making these dumplings and buns and its coming to us fresh. 

The ambiance of this place is very upscale for a Chinese restaurant. Very modern furniture. Excellent lighting and spacious.

 The menu is a little tricky- as it comes in 2 parts. One is an english flip menu with numbers. They give you a giant piece of paper with all the items listed in mandarin. So it is easy to make mistake- as we did order the wrong item
The waitress however was nice about it and allowed us to cancel and they didn't charge us for the it.

The food was very authentic and fairly priced. The ribs with the bok choy were really good."}
{"text":"Okay, so it's not the real Din Tai Fung, but this imitation's a pretty darn good one. The dumplings are fresh, hot, and have the right amount of wrapping skin. Their noodles are excellent and are well pan fried. The scallion pancakes aren't overly fried and are savory.  

In short, they do all the basics very well. This place definitely can fool your brain into thinking you're at the legit Din Tai Fung places in Asia...or Arcadia."}
{"text":"There are some things on earth that every human needs to experience. The soup dumplings here are one of those things. 

They are not served anywhere else in the city with this kind of quality or consistency. 

There is a bit of a technique to eating it. So do your homework to prevent injury(it's freaking hot) and a mess. 

It's a bit far, but it's totally worth it. (Besides there are many interesting businesses around it and a mall with some hidden gems.)"}

(Seriously, I will offer a prize if anyone can get this one - if you know this song, send me a note)
--

So before DD Bra shopping at Walmart with Lauren M. (o.O) we needed some fuel.  Ding Tai Fung has been on my list of to do for ages and just haven't made it up there.  This day was the day.

The Xiao Long Bao (\"Little Soup Buns\") dumplings were as good as many of the places I had in Asia.  Definitely one of the better ones in the GTA area.  What worked perfectly was we ordered the spicy wonton which was sitting in a chili oil sauce with scallions that went perfectly with everything as a dipping sauce.

If it wasn't for the stupid parking situation at First Markham place, I'd probably be here more often.

(Because so many people asked me what this song was from the Elite Event: http://youtu.be/ngsZtWFCgAY)"}
{"text":"I miss this place!!  The sui long bow's....yummy!!  When you pick it up with your chopsticks...you will see a pouch form on the lower end of the bow...you see thru it...and you will see the juices trapped within...pop the whole thing in your mouth and let the waterslides begin...woohoo!"}
{"text":"Overated. The soup dumplings weren't spectacular, but decent. Do not order the jelly fish, they were tough. The service was terrible. After we were seated I had to flag down an employee just to get the menu. Then once we got our food....we had to ask for utensils. When we wanted to order more items...it seemed like we were annoying the staff. They did have a lot going since since there were 3 ladies waiting the entire restaurant."}
{"text":"I came with my brother and we were quite shocked at how many good reviews this place gets.
For a place that specializes in soup dumplings, I didn't find anything special or unique about them. I can essentially get the same thing at Asian Legend. 

We tried a variety of other dishes and nothing stood out. In fact, a little sub par. I had the dan dan noodle and the flavor is not there. 

Prices are \"ok\". Not too expensive. Not too cheap. The hype escapes me."}
{"text":"Coming from New York, I was excited to find another XLB place to try.  Not to be confused with the DTF mushrooming everywhere.  This is the one and only in Canada.  

They serve the same menu all day - all in Chinese characters so good luck ordering if you can't read Chinese.  My hub can read little but had to ask a couple of times for clarification.

The XLB were good.  The one with the crab meat is quite salty different than others I've had.  I don't think it's crab egg yolk, more crab meat (could be wrong translation when we ordered).  I like them but I still prefer Joe Shanghai in Ny better.  Theirs were very delicate since the skin is very thin but I wish there was more broth.

The highlight for us was the spicy crystal dumplings.  So good!!

There are other breakfast options like the salty soy milk, beef rolls and Dan Dan mien.  The Dan Dan mien came with a lot of soup - not the version we are used to and we didn't quite like it as much.  The noodles were fresh and chewy.

Service was really good - at least relative to service I'm used to in the east coast."}
{"text":"4.5 Stars. We came here for the soup dumplings and were not disappointed. Generally, at other restaurants, we prefer the regular soup dumplings w/ pork only. I must say, however, that the soup dumplings with crab & pork are one of the most memorable ones that I've had, so those are the ones we re-ordered. Additionally, we had the snow pea tips and beef noodle soup which were nicely done. Will definitely come back when I'm in town. Service was at times slow, but it is about what you would expect."}
{"text":"This place is one of my faves for shanghai dim sum! The restaurant itself is very spacious and bright. Lots of seating available. I think they only have one menu which includes dim sum at certain prices. You mark down what you would like to order on a paper menu and then the server collects it. 

My faves are the salty soy milk, the xiao long bao (sooo tasty!), and the black sesame xiao long bao dessert (like tong yuen but with dumpling skin). The beef brisket noodles are good too, they give really huge chunks of meat. 

The prices are reasonable and the servers are really attentive. I would recommend to check this place out if you are in the area!"}
{"text":"My new favorite Chinese restaurant!!  My hubby and I went at noon on Boxing Day and we waited for about 10 minutes.  It was busy but not stupidly busy with people standing everywhere like in other Chinese restaurants farther south in this area.  We ordered the crab and pork soup dumplings , fried squid tentacles, hot and sour soup and a shanghai spring roll.  Everything was delicious!!  Served up hot and fast, the service was efficient and zero problems.  Easily my newest favorite restaurant!"}
{"text":"Came here for dim sum when I was in Toronto with friends for a long weekend. Had an awesome time in Toronto. This was our last meal before heading back home!  One the line was looong ended up being a 45min wait even though we called earlier to rsvp for a table. 

The food was pretty good not your traditional dim sum. We got the sticky rice in a roll, the soupy buns (loved it!!), we had the scallion pancake. The buns with the condense milk (yummy), mini pork dumplings, beef stew with noodle soup, and sticky rice dumplings!

Service was okay."}
{"text":"Ding Tai Fung serves the best Xiao Long Bao (or soup dumplings) in the GTA. It is well worth the trek to Markham. The dumplings contains a savoury broth and pork. The skin is firm enugh to hold the broth yet soft (without being soggy). The dumplings are best eaten with a spoon so you don't lose the broth. The other dumplings and buns are also delectable. 

The restaurant is designed for efficiency. This is not a fancy restaurant, but it is a clean restaurant. You can see the chefs preparing the dumplings and buns in the kitchen through a glass window. 

Note that Ding Tai Fung is not affiliated with the Din Tai Fung in Asia (which originated in Taiwan). As an aside, Din Tai Fung in Hong Kong was awarded one Michelin Star - it is one of my favourite places to go for Xiao Long Bao in Hong Kong. It is clear that Ding Tai Fung (in Toronto) is trying to copy or at least draw inspiration from the Din Tai Fung in Asia. I would say that for the most part Ding Tai Fung has successful replicated the Din Tai Fung model."}
{"text":"No, this isn't the same as Din Tai Fung in Arcadia, CA.

It was still however, incredibly memorable. My taste buds were happy for days after this meal. We came for lunch on a Tuesday. The restaurant was packed but we were seated quickly. 

Service here isn't the best. The employees aren't attentive. You can't really blame them. There are way too many customers and just a couple of employees. They need to hire more employees. Our server looked incredibly overworked. 

Free Wi-Fi is available. The password is the restaurants phone number. Complimentary tea is offered. A menu and order sheet is brought to the table. You write down your order on the sheet and give it to an employee. Food comes out fairly quickly. Everything tasted fresh and was very flavorful. 

I love their Spicy & Sour Soup. Filled with all sorts of goodies and had a nice kick. There were levels of flavor in this soup that I usually don't taste in most hot and sour soups. Drool. The Green Onion Pancake was crisp, yet soft in the middle. Filled with lots of green onions. An oily but tasty starter. Their Shanghai Wontons w/ Spicy Sauce was so good that we had to get another order towards the end of our meal. The wontons had a delicate skin filled with tender meat seasoned to perfection. They are placed in a pool of chili oil and topped with green onions. If you enjoy spicy foods, this dish will finish quickly. 

Their XLBs (Xiao Long Bao) are a hit. Whether it be with pork filling or pork and crab, it's juicy and flavorful. The broth inside is clean and seasoned well. The skin is smooth with a nice chew. Dip your XLBs in some vinegar/ginger sauce and you're good to go. For any shrimp lovers, try the Steamed Shrimps & Pork Siu Mai. Big and beautiful pieces of shrimp. 

Though the service needs great improvement, the food is off the hook. Just thinking about Ding Tai Fung makes my mouth water."}
{"text":"Omg what a scam :( not the real DTF. Sweet and sour pork wasn't crispy OR PORK. Just gooey batter in super sweet canned pineapple sauce I'm so sad"}
{"text":"Not bad, the restaurant is pretty clean and spacey. The soup dumplings, pan fried buns and pot stickers are very good. However their other dishes lack in comparison. I would only come here for the soup dumplings. Service is alright, a bit better than usual Chinese restaurants."}
{"text":"I've been here plenty of times, so it's about time I wrote a review. Please note that this is not the real ding tai fung, I'm certain the real ding tai fung is 100% better. But this will do for now.

I came here with my family earlier today around 11. We waited about 15 mins, and we also found out you can make reservations. So we ordered a whole bunch of dishes including crab xiao long bao (4 orders lol), mini pork xlb, hot soy milk with fried dough, beef roll wrapped in foil that taste like patty (still good though), cold dried tofu and a few others. Everything was really delicious, but my aunt and uncle both agreed the crab xlb didn't taste quite the same and thought maybe din tai fung has switched to using imitation crab. I really don't know, I just know it was quite delicious :)

Overall, great place but come early especially on weekends because it'll be packed!"}
{"text":"Some dishes lacked flavour; especially, the spicy beef noodle soup. The broth lack substance. It was light and just too weak. 

The pan fried pork dumplings were okay. The skin was a touch on the thick side while the meat filling was okay. The Doull fill steamed dumplings were good. I liked them then best of all the dishes we ordered."}
{"text":"Went here last night, wasn't too busy at 630 on a Monday. This place is a guilty pleasure of mine, but my favourite dishes are probably the most unhealthy as well.

The three dishes that are a must (in my opinion) include the following:

1. Pan fried pork buns - comes with 5 per order, the buns are so soft and the undersides are pan fried making for a delicious bite

2. Green onion pancake - so crispy and full of flavour. Best I've had anywhere.

3. Pan fried pork dumplings - also comes in 5 and the undersides are perfectly fried. 

Just make sure you try everything with the red vinegar!"}
{"text":"Came here on Boxing Day, had to wait half an hour for a table.  This place was great 10 years ago but there are many better places now.  The food is not that great, only an average for most dishes.  Noodle dishes are not that great, some food courts are better.  Can not understand why so many people still come here, it's overpriced too.  Had the hot and sour soup, it was terrible, no wonder nobody else ordered it!  The only thing that is decent is the soup filled steamed pork dumplings but that is about it.  Service is terrible too, even by Chinese standards!"}
{"text":"Don't care what people say about this place I still Iove eating here. Especially the soupy filled dumplings. They are delicious."}
{"text":"Soup dumplings were good, but like other reviews said the other stuff are mediocre. We got the tan tan noodles and the sauce had a bitter after taste. The noodles were not very chewy and were on the hard side. Also got the pan fried meat buns and although they tasted good, was way too oily. I think Asian legend is way better than this place."}
{"text":"I love this place and keep coming back because they do a good job with their food for over 20 years.

Fresh, tastey, quality made inhouse, fair prices, consistent food

Favorites- steamed mini pork dumplings, chive dumplings, double broiled chicken soup, spicy jellyfish, glutinous rice rolls savoury, spicy shrimp, garlic snowpea sprouts, rice cake soup/stir fried, hot soy milk, pan fried pork dumplings

Before Asian Legend, this was my go to place for dim sum type chinese food

Tip 1 -  look at what other people are ordering
Tip 2 - it's not fine dining so don't expect Michelin star service and you'll enjoy your experience so much more
Tip 3 - They're packed on weekends and line up is long. Weekdays are much better for service."}
{"text":"just max out on dumplings here and u will leave satisfied! the giant pork meatballs are also awesome tho but it IS pricey ... so good eats but fair warning!"}
{"text":"Great new spot!! Sat right away. Green tea was already waiting. Servers were very quick and prompt. Nice open space with very pleasing and comfortable decor.  
Came for the soup dumplings, will definitely be back. The green onion pancake was also very good. Loved the pan fried pork dumplings and the rice with pork and mushroom!! Food came to $30 for two people. So full. The food was very good.  
Easy to understand menu and the servers were extremely attentive. 
100% one of our new spots. Will be back"}
{"text":"yum. Good prices, good food. 
On a rainy sunday evening, the wait wasn't too long for a table. 

They have 3 different kinds of xiao long baos, and they were super fresh and warm, full of juices. 
All kinds of shanghainese dim sum, and other main plates.

It was really one of the first yummy shanghainese places before asian Legend came about.  I'd come here all the time if it wasn't too far away. 

Best recommendation if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"If your looking for authentic Shanghai style dim sum, this is the place.  It's as good, if not better, than restaurants I've been to in Shanghai. 

The pork dumplings with soup have a thin dough and very tasty broth inside.  They are light and fresh, allowing you to eat a lot of them.  

The spicy wonton soup has a great combination of spices and a generous portion of bite size wontons.

The pork bun has a soft but not overly thick bun, allowing for a healthy amount of pork mixture.

The prices are more than others in the area, but the restaurant is clean and modern and the food is probably the best dim sum in Markham and maybe even GTA."}
{"text":"Went here for a late Sunday brunch and after having to wait 30 mins beyond my reservation time (so much for reservations), I was seated and promptly served. We ordered the spicy wontons, several dim sum including the soup filled xiao special. The pancake beef was lacking a bit in flavour and a little greasy. 
We did receive the twisted sweet dim sum even though we never ordered them ($3.95). They were good though. 
Final verdict--I would give myself time to wait upwards of 45 mins but would definitely come back and try new dishes!"}
{"text":"For the price they are charging, the dim sum here is a rip off. Only thing good from here is the Xiu Long Bao. But portion is still so small. I come here time to time because is close to my home. But for every visit the portion of meat shrinks. Especially the different types of Baos. All I can tasted is the dough, no juice from the meat or meat at all. I don't see a bright future for this restaurant. Hopefully the owner read this and change their way of operating a business."}
{"text":"What is up with First Markham Place stealing the names of well-established restaurants? Do NOT get this place confused with the award-winning international chain called DIN Tai Fung! See the difference? Sneaky ass Chinese people.

Regardless, the Xiao Long Baos were flavorful balls of pork wrapped in delicate skin, although not as soupy as I would have liked. Other dishes including stir-fried string beans, peanut dan dan noodles, and rice cakes were also good and not overly greasy as I find sometimes happens with Shanghainese cooking.

This place MIGHT do the real Din Tai Fung justice... unlike Tracy Dessert & the real Hui Lau Shan... (http://www.yelp.com/biz/tracy-dessert-markham#hrid:-zDt2JHvTJW8nfE6A35ONw)"}
{"text":"See my review of the original Markham Ding Tai Fung, and also Xiao Long Bao, which is what this restaurant was called before it changed to also be named Ding Tai Fung (guess to boost its popularity since it was half empty the few times we went?).

This one is more spacious and spread out than the one in First Markham Place. The service was good and attentive the three times we came. Less line ups and less loud here too.

Must recommend main dishes are the xiao long baos, and must recommend dessert dish are the deep fried egg white souffles with black sesame filling. A bite of it and the hot sesame flows out... So good!

One thing we noticed is that previously they only offered a Chinese menu, but now, they also have an English version. Improvement.

You can watch them make the little soup dumplings through the glass windows at the back.

Delicious xiao long baos, but cannot compare to the original Din Tai Fung in TW!"}
{"text":"I love the food and drinks here...Shanghai-style cuisine with some amazing xiao long bao, they really should be called \"little packages of heaven\". We also got some pan-fried dumplings, snow pea shoots (I think), and rice cakes with pork and cabbage. My boyfriend swears by their milk tea, and my lemon iced tea came with it's own little pitcher of liquid sweetener, which is a nice touch. We came at peak dinner time and had to wait about 10 minutes for a table which isn't bad. We used the time to look over the menu and decide what we wanted, filling out the form as well. I'll be back the next time I'm in Markham!"}
{"text":"This place is horrible! I heard so many people raving about Ding Tai Fung but honestly, not as great as I thought it would be. Everything seems to be very bland. No flavor in the soup in the dumplings!!

If you want good soup dumpling, go to Nan Xiang Dumpling House in Queens, New York! Trust me. You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Such great dim sum. Everything  that we ordered was very well made. Best Shanghai dumplings in town usually, I avoid pork because the quality is not great but they don't have this problem here. It is a long journey for me from Toronto but well worth it!"}
{"text":"*Worst Din Tai Fung*

I have been to Din Tai Fung in Costa Mesa and Del Amo (both in Los Angeles area) and this one just does not hold up. In LA the servers are very friendly, the meus are in english and they want to help you. Here they gave us a table in the back and then ignored us for almost a half an hour. They hadn't set the table, nobody offered us drinks. 

The food was very good, I had peanut noodle and xialong bao. The food definitely lives up to the DTF name, but the service is BAD. The other people who came seemed to be fine, but they only seemed to want to provide service to their asian clientele (racist?). 

I would not go back here, if you are visiting from LA or some other place in the US with DTF, I suggest reconsidering."}
{"text":"One of the more popular places for Shanghai cuisine especially their famous \"xiao long bao\" though it is also a bit on the pricey side for Shanghai food. Definitely the best xiao long bao around greater Toronto area however, for other Shanghai dishes I personally prefer Asian Legend. 

I find it rather cool that they have an open concept kitchen area where you can actually see workers prepare the xiao long baos and dumplings. I remember as a child I loved walking next to the window and watching them make dumplings. They even made a small bao in the shape of a bunny for me. 

This place is always packed so if you do come make sure you have an reservation and be prepared to wait even with one!"}
{"text":"First off, this isn't a Shanghainese restaurant like they advertise. Came here with my parents looking for good Shanghainese food that would remind us of home but was pretty disappointed. Food wasn't horrible, just wasn't Shanghainese. Guess we should have seen that coming as a large portion of the patrons eating there weren't even Asian and no one working the floor seemed to speak Shanghainese.

The xiao long bao was the closest to Shangai food and were pretty good. Make sure to eat the ginger that comes with the xiao long baos though. They make sure not to over cook the meat to keep it nice and tender but that means it may not always be fully cooked. I didn't eat the ginger and ended up getting diarrhea for two days, my parents did and they were both fine Q.q

The pig ears were pretty yummy - well seasoned and crunchy. The sesame tang yuan in the fermented rice soup was also good. 

We also got the wonton soup and the shen jian bao which were so so. The wontons had super thick skins and very little meat inside. The shen jian bao were more like baos with a thinner fried bottom, not like anything you'd find in Shanghai. Not bad but very different than what we expected. 

If I could re-order I'd just get the xiao long bao and maybe try some of their soup noodles and normal baos. All the tables around us seemed to be enjoying some type of soup noodle. 

TBH though, there are plenty other better restaurants I'd go to before returning here. We came in a little after 8pm on a weekday and had to wait 10 minutes before getting seated at a dirty table (I had to use the tea to wipe off all the sticky stuff left on the table). Still, not quite sure why this place is so popular with the locals."}
{"text":"Not the real deal DinTaiFung. At least I dont think this place is related to the original establishment in Taiwan and HK...

No doubt they have the best xiao long baos in Toronto. Filled with the right amount of soup.

Just don't accidentally spill/break the wrapper with your chopstick and eat it in one go.

Also highly recommend to order the fried egg white souffles with red bean/black sesame inside."}
{"text":"It is such a surprise to see that this  Ding Tai Fung is not as popular as the one in LA. I don't know why, maybe it's because the price is different. If I remember correctly, the portion was bigger, too. This place is clean and you can see how they make the dumplings. Of course when you go here, you need to order the soup dumpling. 

The first time we went here we ordered the Mini dumplings. Compare to the regular sized dumplings I think the mini ones are not as tasty. Silly of me, but the bigger ones let you taste the whole soup and meat more so then just eating more dough. 

The  service was always fast and pleasant. Well, as fast as they can make the dumplings. I don't mind the wait of less than fifteen minutes. Enjoy the soup dumplings, let the texture, the taste, and the fun of taking a small bite and sucking the soup out. Yummmmy."}
{"text":"Quality of the Food

I have been coming here over 10 years.  I think the fact that this place has been here since First Markham Place (FMP) was built is a statement of the quality of the food and service.

If you look at your neighbour's table, most likely they are ordering Xiao Long Bao (Soup Dumplings) and noodles.  I highly recommend it as their soup dumpling has never disappointed a picky eater like me.  A reminder to let it cool a few minutes when it arrives otherwise it will rip.

I also recommend ordering the war-teep (fried pork dumplings).  The skin is perfect (not too thick or thin) and the pork filling is cooked perfectly.  There's also soup in there.

Not many people order the fried green pancake which I can understand.  Price wise, you can purchase the T&T version and make it at home for the same amount of an order from here.  Unless you are really craving it, I would recommend purchasing it from T&T in the frozen section.

Noodles
This place is known for their noodles so order it!  In fact the artwork against the wall depicts the long strands of noodles.  I'm not sure if customers noticed that, it is perhaps a subliminal message to order it? =P  

I recommend ordering the beef noodle soup.  The noodles are always cooked perfectly and the amount of beef tenderloins is very generous.  I often cannot finish the beef tenderloins and share it with friends and family.  The quality of the beef tenderloins are thick slices and cooked perfectly.  I'm not too fond of the tenderloins (even though my mom lectures me it's good for my knee joints...) so often avoid eating those parts.  I've eaten other beef noodles at FMP and lets just say the beef tenderloins were thin, overcooked and cut 

Service


Overall"}
{"text":"I believe Ding Tai Fung loosely translates to \"dumpling heaven.\"

Post elite event, our sensei Jen K. suggested we hop across the street and chow down at DTF and boy am I glad she made the suggestion. As soon as we walked into this place and I saw the men behind the glass hand making the dumplings I knew I was in for a good meal. The place was pretty busy for a Sunday night but the food came out quickly (thanks to Jen k. and Wayne for doing the ordering). 

The stars of the dinner were clearly the Xiao Long Bao (soup dumplings) and the pot stickers. The soup dumplings were unreal, the dough was perfect, thick enough without being too heavy, and the filling was juicy and quite flavourful; totally worth me burning my tongue trying to scarf them down! The pot stickers were easily the best I have ever had; also filled with soup the dough was perfectly crispy without being greasy. Honourable mention goes to the radish pancake/dumpling things which had a good but surprisingly mild radish flavour also encased in beautifully crunchy dough. 

Our second round included knotted bread with condensed milk (really good, not too sweet), some really nice shanghai noodles, and a shrimp and peanut dish which provided some much needed crunch and a little heat from the red chillies it was cooked with. All in all a great meal, I will be back soon! 

The next time someone asks you if you are DTF don't think, just say yes!"}
{"text":"This is by far the best dumpling place I have been to in Toronto. I am a huge fan of Pork Soup dumplings (Xiao Long Bao) and I don't mean any less when I say it serves the best of its kind by a mile. Their other dumplings are very tasty as well (like spicy wontons, pork and chive dumpling, grilled pork dumpling, etc.). I always start off with their spicy and sour soup which has the right amount of spiciness and sourness. And order a side of vegetables (usually go with Chinese broccoli with beef)."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere and good food.  Parking is terrible around supper time and on the weekends."}
{"text":"This was a bit of a disappointment for me. While not normally a fan of DTF, this place appears to be a knock-off, and the soup dumplings aren't even as good as those of authentic DTF outlets. Even so, they are far better than the other dishes on the menu, judging by the noodles and other dishes we had, none of which were particularly flavourful. I think better can be had elsewhere and probably at more reasonable prices too."}
{"text":"Out of the Shanghai places available in Markham, I enjoy Ding Tai Fung's dumplings the most. Thin dumpling skin with juicy meatball inside. Their onion pancake isn't oily with a decent amount of onions unlike some where they taste only batter. Their gou choi dumplings are also flavourful and full of greens. Not the biggest fan of their stir fry meats but their fried rice and noodles are good quality and packed with flavour. 

Lastly, customer service here is great compared to many other Chinese restaurants. 

Try their sesame paste filled dessert dumplings, those are pretty good too. Not too sweet and has great sesame flavours as I believe they use real black sesame."}
{"text":"All Ding Tai Fung imposter comments aside, this place actually has really good dumplings - from their xiao long baos to their green onion pancakes, I would recommend them all. The sticky rice and pork siu mai is great and not overly dry as it can be at some places. I would recommend the crab meat xiao long baos over the regular pork ones because it's a little more flavourful. All the dumplings have paper thin wrappers and come to your table piping hot. The spicy wontons are bathed in a phenomenal meaty broth and spicy chilli oil. I'm drooling just thinking about the dumplings. 

However their main dishes were lacklustre. I had the fish fillet in sweet and sour sauce, which tasted like it was straight out of a food court. The fried green beans are oily and lack any flavour if you don't get any of the pork bits. 

Service was a bit rude, they told us we had to leave within an hour because the restaurant was supposedly booked out for the evening. It actually wasn't booked out, it seemed they just wanted tables to turnover quicker so they could service more customers. 

Despite the less than stellar service and mediocre main dishes, I would still recommend coming here to have their dumplings!"}
{"text":"Their pan fried pork buns have gotten smaller and the xiao long bao aren't as good as before.  They are saltier now (I've noticed this on my last two visits).  Still decent though."}
{"text":"The food is good. The price has gone up so high after the min wage when up. The major problem of the few times I went is when I give 10% tips I felt like they weren't happy at all. So two reason I won't  go again unless I have no choice."}
{"text":"what makes those famous \"xiao long bao\" the best here is the super delicate and thin wrapper that those chefs make (they make it on the spot in front of you behind a glass, and they are really nice and smile at you when you look at them making the dumplings) I like how the dishes here are small, so that I can try many different dishes at once even if i'm not with a lot of poeple. but the variety is not much...

I also really like the sesame dumplings for dessert! there's 2 kinds tho, The one I like looks just like a xiao long bao but filled with hot sesame inside instead, yum!!"}
{"text":"Heard a lot about this company, ding Tai fung. First time coming with a excitement to try their well known famous dim sum (especially excited for the soup dumplings). 

Slightly disappointed in the dim sum, it was lacking salt. It tasted very Bland. On the other hand, the soup dumplings was by far the best, the soup was incredible. 

The place was pretty small, but the service was not bad. As for the pricing, it was relatively reasonable, quite expensive for the amount we got."}
{"text":"Found this place by accident.  It is not affiliated with the one in Taiwan.  They offer reasonable price and fast service.  Shao long bao is very good.  The noodle in spicy beef noodle soup was hand made which is always a plus in my books.  I will definitely visit again if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"IF i want good xiao long bao , then I totally will come here for the soupy filled dumplings!
However, more and more often, I always get nervous that their dumplings are not cooked fully due to the pinky colour. I think that when I first started coming here, it was amazing but then the wait time and crowd always made me want to come less. 

Its a pretty big place because we could book a room and reserve a table for 15. Its great for big gatherings. 
i didn't enjoy the family style dishes that you can order in combo . I wasn't impressed with the special menu we ordered from but definitely just for dumplings and small dishes you order on the side is great!"}
{"text":"I was really excited to come to Ding Tai Fung and waited 2 weeks to actually make the mission down to Markham for just dumplings. I know this isn't the real one in Hong Kong and what not but it had the same concept. 

Upon arriving around 9PM it was not as busy as we got seated right away. The food had its ups and down so I can't rate everything as a whole;

Xiao Long Bao - I loved it, you can really taste the gingery broth inside the dumplings. The skin was it was soft yet chewy and didn't break the second I picked it up. Would definitely get again if I ever were to ever come back. 

Sticky Rice and Sui Mai - to be honest I thought it was 3 pieces of sticky rices and 3 pieces of Sui Mai but it was sticky rice in a dumpling skin in shape of a sui mai, I was so off and kinda sad lol. I didn't really like this dish, didn't really taste like much and it's pretty hard to eat. Would not recommend. 

Stir-fried Green Beans with Minced Pork - Super yummy and flavourful, not too oily like other places

Chicken with Green Onion - The chicken was cooked nicely but they cover the whole thing with oil and the chicken skin had a looooot of fat left on it (so sad because that's my favourite part of chicken) 

Customer service was kinda mehh, when the waitress came I asked for 3 cups of water and she gave me a side eye and said okay and I guess she forgot so I asked my boyfriend to ask for the water again and he asked in Chinese also, the waitress only came back with 2 cups of water :( 

Overall, if I could I would give it was 3.5 but I'll just give it a 4 instead of a 3 because the Xiao Long Bao was delicious. I don't know if I would recommend it to a friend to drive 40 minutes from Mississauga to eat but I would come again if I was in the area!"}
{"text":"As much as DTF has some of the best Xiao Long Bao in Canada...
My Family/Relatives or even Friends rarely if never suggest to eat here.
I'm not sure their reasoning for selection process but that's fact.

Another fact is I have a different preference for Xiao Long Bao.
Very weird in fact, since I guess I grew up eating Cantonese Dim Sum ones.
I prefer the Meat Filling consistency to be almost HK Meatball style.
Ones you feel very little texture on the tongue but much more bite/bounce back.
But none of those had the Thin Wrap or the fresh Soup like these.
I even prefer these to ones in Richmond BC.

Xiao Long Bao's are pricey in the overall Chinese realm.
I've started to think of it in line with Tapas, maybe that'll help a bit.
As a Shanghai restaurant, it doesn't fully cater to all the needs.
Have you ever notice it's only busy during the morning rush?

It's purely a one-hit-wonder but that SINGLE is all DTF needs."}
{"text":"Haven't been to this place for a long time and decided to give it a try since we were looking for Shanghai dim sum early Saturday morning. This is one of the restaurants in the First Markham Place mall outside. Wasn't that busy on a Saturday around 11am. We ordered the usual Shanghai favorites steamed siu long buns, fried silver bun with condense milk dip, fried Shanghai noodle, spicy beef noodle, steamed pork and chive dumplings, \"big beef roll\", hot soy drink and fried donut stick. Everything tastes great. A little oily but what you would expect for this type of fare. Nicely renovated inside and modern looking. Washrooms were clean and orderly. The soap ran out and I told the server and this was corrected immediately. Great for families and little ones. There were lots of dinner options that looked tasty. Good for those looking for a break from Asian legend. There are more items selection here. A little pricey but you pay for environment and service. Would come back again."}
{"text":"Love this shanghai joint! The shanghai dumplings are awesome and flavourful. I also recommend the beef noodles and for dessert- the sesame steamed bun (dumpling). The sesame paste in the dumpling melts in your mouth, definitely a different twist."}
{"text":"You hear this name, and MAN, you know you gotta go inside. DING TAI FUNG all the way!! This is a chain of restaurants that specializes in Shanghai food. Three words: ???(xiao long bao). Haha I find it kind of funny that it translates literally into small dragon bun. Another one of my favourites is the plastic-wrapped sticky rice contained dried strands of salty pork floss and strips of fried dough. Not every shanghai place has this dish, but it's definitely one of my favourites!

Yupp, there's always a long lineup here, so make sure you come early or get reservations. On a glass window, you can see chefs make all of the bread and dumpling items. I'm really surprised that the design hasn't changed or hasn't changed much over the years. I guess it's on the pricey side compared to other Shanghai places, but still delicious. However, if you have to compare this Ding Tai Fung to the Legendary one in Taiwan, I'd say man, this one can't compare to the one over there. 
Ding Tai Fung in Markham is GOOD, but for the price and food you get...I think there are some better places in Markham."}
{"text":"Your basic dimsum nothing fancy, but done well. Many dimsum places have a multitude of very fancy dimsums, but I beg to question their quality. This place has few, however the few that it has is of good quality. Notable are the Xiao long bao, the pan fried pork buns, and the green onion pancake - all very simple and delicious. Is it comparable to the original Ding Tai Fung in Taipei or Shanghai? I don't think so, however nonetheless, a good place to try dimsum with soup. The reason why I did not give higher stars is because I was asked at the end of our meal for higher tip. It's the first time it's happened to us at a Chinese dimsum place. So when you go here, be prepared to give double the tip you're used to!"}
{"text":"Amazing xiao lung pao! Can't get enough of them! I came here twice now and I love their dim sum. Other dishes are rather mediocre and small portion. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Still an excellent place. Came here on a weekday for lunch and it got busy. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I LOVE EATING DUMPLINGS. 
Ding Tai Fung is my favourite place for Xiao Long Baos and Pan Fried dumplings. 

Their Xiao long baos are so juicy, tender, soft... just perfect! Definitely reached \"umami\" flavour when I eat these. I love their pan fried pork dumplings too, they also have some soup inside - so good. I really love how their dumpling skin isn't too thick, so it allows the flavour to soak through instead of hard flour blocking the way.

Other than dumplings I highly recommend their bean leaves with garlic - it's super packed with flavour! And their fried rice which is so simple but very delicious. 

The dumplings are on the PRICIER side but that's why I only come here for special occasions. Coming as a small group of 2-3 the bill is around $60-80 dollars for this meal so be prepared to spend $$.

I would give this place 5 stars because the food is my favourite & the service is curt and straight forward but... they can give you glares if you don't tip to their standards. That's my only complaint. Food wise it's peachy keen but when it comes to price & those glares.. not so peachy. 

I love eating here because of their dumplings & I will continue to come here until I find a place that doesn't hurt the wallet too much & is as tasty!"}
{"text":"Seriously the BEST soup dumplings this side of the Pacific!  thin skinned dumplings that POUR out soup when you bite into it!

Their dan dan noodle is awesome!  also really enjoyed their hot and sour soup! it wasn't super thick the way some restaurants serve it!  Yummy chunks of bamboo shoots, black fungus, firm tofu - delish!

The last time I was here about probably 4 years ago and when I went last week - it was just a great!  there is nothing better than an awesome restaurant that is consistent!"}
{"text":"crab meat soupy buns were so good!!
all others met my expectation for Shanghai food. will come again."}
{"text":"Tried their set dinner menu for the first time. Everything was steamed and lots of tasty new options. Felt good after eating it."}
{"text":"Came here with a huge group of hungry hungry yelpers! 

I'm not sure what we ordered because the lovely Jenn K did all the ordering for us, but everything was delicious!

Especially the pot stickers!

Om nom nom nom"}
{"text":"First time visit for a dinner with co workers.  We got a lot of dishes ranging from soup dumplings, beef rolls, and few other rice dishes.  It was good overall but I preferred the soup dumplings at this other place called Shanghai 901.

Food: 3/5, they were all relatively good. The wontons in spicy sauce was the best dish by far.  The beef rolls were meh.

Service: 1/5, I made reservations but they didn't honour it - we had to wait like 30+ mins and they gave away another table of people that did not make a reservation.

Ambience: 3/5, clean place

Price: 3/5, it was $20 per person for a lot of food. Not too bad at all."}
{"text":"really good dim-sum!
i'm giving it a 3 star only cuz everything else on the menu are really hit-or-miss. not a lot of dishes have picture so I don't really know what i'm getting even with the descriptions. few times i ended up with pretty weird stuff. 
tips: don't try to be overly adventurous. stick with the dimsums"}
{"text":"Before coming to this place, I never really knew what Shanghai food was. What's the difference? Isn't it all just Chinese anyway? Well, like any other countries there are various differences in each part. I wouldn't be able to describe to you the difference but once you've eaten it, you can taste the difference.

I enjoy everything about this place. The soup dumplings are amazing. That's due to the beautiful dough that is made on the premise right in front of your eyes. I also love the fried dumplings that are slowly fried in a pan, perfect crispness on the bottom. Yum!

There's a large window that looks into the dumpling kitchen. Here you can watch as 3-4 men assemble those dumplings in front of your eyes. There are literally stacks of them just waiting to be cooked into deliciousness for you to enjoy. 

The beef noodles in soup are amazing. It has a slight kick to it but it's totally bearable, as I can't even take any spiciness and I can eat it. The Shanghai noodles are really good and extremely authentic. There isn't any sweetness to this sucker. 

The dish you must try is the one that I can't name for you. I apologize but this is what happens when you always order in Chinese. It's a Shanghai style dish that has cabbage in it and a dough like substance made from rice flour and cooked to perfection. It's honestly really good and a typical Shanghai dish, very authentic. One of my personal favourite is the sticky rice roll with minced meat shavings. It's soo good and I don't even like rice so there you go. 

It has gotten a little more pricey as the years have past and with their renovations they have adjusted their prices accordingly. But it's one of my go to restaurants when I'm in a bind and can't think of anywhere else to go.

Man, I'm hungry now..."}
{"text":"First off let's make sure we don't confuse this with the other famous chain that we know worldwide.    From what I know, this is a one off restaurant here at first Markham Place.   

Everything here taste delicious and very authentic.    So authentic that the ordering menu is in Chinese and the only way to figure out what you want to order is to ask for the menu book where there are pictures and English words.

I came here for a huge group for a birthday dinner.   Even with such a large group service was fast and efficient and friendly.   

We came here for dinner on a Saturday night which is probably one of their busiest days of the week.   I would reserve a table in advance.     

Every time I come here, no matter what I order the food seems to be always authentic and delicious.   So I am just going to tell you that it is pretty much safe to order anything off the menu and assume that it is going to be delicious.

Hi come here whenever I am craving authentic Chinese dumplings."}
{"text":"This fake Ding Tai Fung does not suprise me. The food quality and taste is not even close to the real one. It is pretty pricy and the food can be added with more flavor. The service was excellent maybe becuz the restaurant is not even if full on a Friday night. Soup dumpling was ok. Pork chop noodles was ok. Mini dumpling was terrible and dry. Snow peas leafs  was tooooo salty and over cooked and dry. Would definitely not come back. Even Asian legend is better than here."}
{"text":"The soup dumplings and pork buns are amazing!! Kinda sucks that there is always a line up before seating but I guess that says a lot about their food right?"}
{"text":"I came here on a Sunday afternoon during labour day weekend and boy was it busy! I am used to going to the Ding Tai Fung in Markham and it is quite oily compared to this one. I feel like the food, staff, and overall atmosphere is more superior compared to the one than in First Markham place. All foods came out hot and fresh. The tables and space were big. You have alot of room to turn and move your chair around without being scared you might hit someone or their chair. The xiao long bao was bomb. Skin was thin and the dumpling was filled with soup. It was 6.99 and it came in 6. The braised beef with noodles was also good, lots of nice beef pieces with good ratio of meat and tendon. The noodles are fresh made and I believe it was $8.99, portions were good. The shanghai pan fried rice cakes ($11.99) was also so flavourful especially with their chili sauce. The sticky rice which wrapped around the fried cruller, pork floss, and pickled radish( i believe ?) Was so so so good. The rice wasnt too thick and there were so much filling. But it was quite small. I think 3.99 for 3 pieces but the pieces were relatively small, maybe cuz it was so darn good. The spicy and sour soup was also good. Not too much ingredient compared to other places but still really flavourful. The last thing we got was a cold appetizer. Some sort of tofu/bean curd thing. Not really worth it, costs 5.99 and it was a bit bland. Overall I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"I agreed with some of you, the soup dumplings was not the best. BUT, it certainly above average compared to other similar restaurants in Toronto. A bit pricey menu. Very clean kitchen cuz you can literally see the chiefs inside doing the dumplings! Chicken soup was a bit too plain, I need to add soy sauce... lol. Generally you have to wait in line during weekends, but it's worth it.

Food Quality: Delicious
Service: Not bad consider they are busy
Overall: 4/5 Pleasure to eat their soup dumplings"}
{"text":"This is not the same one from Taiwan! Don't be tricked! 

This restaurant used to be good 10 years ago, but with the opening of more and more of these restaurants, this one could not keep up. 

Everything is very 'so so' and nothing stands out. I think my favorite is the fried rice."}
{"text":"I came here with family and ordered their Xiao long bao, the mini Xiao long bao, tendon, pig ear, and shanghai spicy wontons. 
The dishes were all very good, especially the appetizers and anything that is spicy.

However, for the amount of food, we felt that the prices were high, and we were still hungry after (so we got dessert elsewhere).

Make sure to reserve as they fill up fast!"}
{"text":"I've been to the locations in Taipei and Beijing so I was excited to come here. Unfortunately, the food here was not as good as I expected.

We got the regular soup dumplings, crab soup dumplings, and sweet vinegar ribs. The wait at 11:30 on a Sunday was more than half an hour. The food was cooked fairly quickly. The soup dumplings were good, but about the same as most soup dumplings I've had in Chinatown.

The sweet vinegar ribs were dispapointing because the sauce was mostly ketchup, like sweet and sour. The texture was good though--tender inside and crispy outside. Overall, the taste was ok, but it looked like there were better options for Chinese food nearby."}
{"text":"If you love dumplings and experience the whole Shanghai experience with being in a modern atmosphere check this place out at Markam Place on Highway 7.

If you don't like Pork Fat then slim chance you'll like the food here!

I have tried these foods:
Green Onion Pancake
Siu Long Bau (Soup Dumplings)
Shanghai Fried noodles with pork and Cabbage
Shanghai Soup noodles with pork and Cabbage
Peanut Soup noodles
Beef Rolls
Pan Fried Pork & Shrimp Dumplings
Red Bean Fried Dessert in a Egg White Cluster
Fried Pork Buns with Sesame on top
Vegetarian Chicken( Really it is called this in English but its beancurd marianated in sweet soy)
Jellyfish

In my opinion the best Shanghai Food I've ever had. The quality control is amazing and service is fast and efficient. I've been there at total of 15 times and is not dissapointed.  Food is fresh and the best part like everyone says is you can see the people make the cute little dumplings through a glass large window from where you sit. I have had shanghai food only in Canada in Vancouver and Toronto and by far the best. 

I don't think it gets better than that.  The reason some people don't like this place is because 1) they are picky 2) they don't like oily food 3) They have no idea what good Shanghai food \"SHOULD\" taste like.

Overall this is why my vote is 5/5 stars.

Food check. Atmosphere check. Cleanliness check (don't know what it's like in kitchen however.... Service check Prices check. You can't beat it if you can find a better place than this please let me know at onestylishbayb@hotmail.com

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite and go to restaurants when I'm in Toronto.  I've been to different Ding Tai Fung in LA and SF Bay Area, but I think the one in Toronto is my favorite.  I'm not sure why but some of my favorite dishes like the wide bean curd noodles is not available anywhere else.  Also, the scallion pancakes are delicious and not oily unlike other places I've been to."}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite restaurants in the GTA.  The food comes out really quickly here.  There is a huge glass window separating the kitchen from the dining area through which you can marvel at the towering pillars of bamboo steamers that overlook the chefs making the dumplings. I recommend the pot stickers, xiao long bao, and the dan dan noodles.  I'm not a fan of the green onion pancakes here and still think my family makes them better ;-)

Price is a bit higher than average but I have no qualms recommending this place."}
{"text":"The problem with naming your restaurant almost similarly to a popular institution is that you will forever be compared to the real one.  Their XLBs are not bad, but they are no Din Tai Fung.  

That being said -- if you're in the area and craving XLB, it should suffice. They serve both the pork and the pork/crab XLB -- I usually stick to the original pork version.  We went on a weekday so the restaurant wasn't crowded and service was attentive and friendly.  Save room for dessert (Fruit Jungle is next door!)."}
{"text":"Best dumplings in Toronto. Hands down. It's better than Mother's dumpling although those are pretty good too. We had a variety ranging from the classic little dragon shang hai ones, to pan fried and boiled. All were great.

Skip the Dan dan noodles."}
{"text":"So based on several recommendations, I've finally made it here.

Fresh hot delicious Shanghainese food. Basically your staples, soup dumplings (among the best I've had in the city), scallion pancakes (crispy, not to oily or doughy) and your assortment of noodles bowls (beef brisket/tendon is solid). 

So, overall, everything is top notch and by the massive crowds, very popular. Bright well lit open restaurant. So, by comparison, the soup dumplings were the best. But compared to say, Ala kitchen, (which is literally the building behind and across the street), the prices are about 10-15% more and the beef brisket and noodles are, dare I say, slightly tastier. 

So, I'd love to come here again but if it's crowded or I'm just looking for some noodles and not planning on the soup dumplings, I'll likely choose Ala first."}
{"text":"Visited during the week and it was packed on a snowy day.  We went past 1 and it was still packed.  Had to wait about 20min to get a seat.  The staff are a bit disorganized and not entirely very friendly.  However, I can't deny that the food was great.  The dumplings are good, especially the pork soup dumpling.  The price is decent.  It was a fair bit of a trek to get here for us so as much as I'd like to visit again, it probably will not be happening for quite some time.  I wish they would open one in Mississauga."}
{"text":"Don't expect like what you have in Taiwan. It is a totally different restaurant. Quite disappointed about the food quality and service. The restaurant is not clean, especially the tea pot and rest room.
I personally don't understand why it is so busy. Not recommended restaurant."}
{"text":"My coworker (who's from Shanghai) recommended this place during a business trip, and she's super-picky when it comes to chinese food.  That was my first experience trying these shanghai-style \"soup dumplings\".  While I've had it a few times since then, I gotta say I'm yet to find a bay area restaurant that can do it better.  

Tried the other dim sum items as well as some main dishes, and they were pretty good as well.  I particularly liked the fried pork bun, sizzling beef plate, and chicken w/ peanuts.  Service is not great, but no worse than most \"authentic\" chinese restaurants.

This is definitely one of those places I'll definitely keep coming back to whenever I'm in town."}
{"text":"Pretty good food and service.  Price seems reasonable.  You do leave with a full tummy!  A nice and fairly clean establishment to walk into.  However it can get a bit cramped if you're caught seated at a table in the middle of the place.  Close parking can be a b*tch to look for on a Friday eve or anytime during the weekend because of it being in the midst of First Markham Place.  Good luck folks!"}
{"text":"It's a copy of the real deal from Asia. Food is too plain and not like authentic Taiwanese style. Only good things to order here are sorts of dumplings. Dumplings are good."}
{"text":"Best xiao long bao in GTA. Not sure why so many bad reviews of people who say it's good or trying to compare to Shanghai or the real ding tai fung. We don't have any of those so this is as good as it gets and it's pretty good for Toronto standards. Nothing like this downtown."}
{"text":"This placed Was awesome. I don't usually have shanghai dim sum but I'm glad I did. The dim sum was tasty, big, didn't lack ingredients, and made to order.  Definitely a must try."}
{"text":"Coming from NYC this restaurant for breakfast is amazing! So delicious!!!! This location compared to NYC, NYC should be embarrassing. NYC location is so loud and dirty, food is 100% better in Canada."}
{"text":"Love their xiao long bao but that's about it. The other dishes are okay, and I actually prefer Asian legend more overall. Do not get their beef pancake rolls! Bread was so thick and hard to eat."}
{"text":"Food taste fresh and delicious! I love the dumplings! Very clean and good service. Really cool to see the kitchen staff working through a clear glass. Price is expensive but I would recommend dining here and I would go again."}
{"text":"Yes, \"Yay, I'm a fan\" to the xiao long bao at this restaurant. It's fresh, the skin is thin, the soup is mouth watering delicious and the meat was perfectly cooked. So good, we ordered another round! I wasn't the biggest fan of the minis, there wasn't any soup in them so I say go for the ORIGINAL!! The rest of the dishes were alright, I would not recommend the shu mai with sticky rice (unless your a gluten lover, not much taste but lots of soft and chewy texture) and I DO NOT order the red bean pastry puff, it just tasted like egg white. Prices were reasonable and the restaurant is CLEAN - a definite plus."}
{"text":"I love it !  The Xiao long bao , pork and shrimp dumplings, green beans and the green onion pancake! I highly recommend it ! Best spot for soup dumplings"}
{"text":"A tourist destination more than anything.  Dishes are relatively expensive compared to your average Shanghai restaurant.  

Outstanding things to try are their Xiao Long Bao - definitely top-notch with a thin skin and full of juice; these have consistently been amazing
many of their desserts are also very worth trying, since you won't find them often in other Shanghai restaurants!

Service is often mediocre and the waitresses often look annoyed or seem like they don't want to be bothered...

Be sure to go early or make a reservation though, since this place fills up fairly quickly even on a weeknight!"}
{"text":"Coming here on a Saturday night, Ding Tai Fung is BUSY and be prepared to wait at least 20-30 min.  Not counting time it takes to find parking. 
Not sure how long its been here for, but its popular among the locals and those who can't get enough of dumplings, soup dumplings, noodles, etc.  
Their dumplings are made on-sight, from scratch.  
Fortunately our wait was not too bad and as we sat, we knew what we wanted. 
They've got a great selection of food on the menu however it's not reasonably priced.  
Taste of their pork dumplings were at PAR, it definitely lacked flavor.  Soup dumplings were small but had a nice broth. Portions are sufficient and service was not the best.  
In addition to the soup dumpling, and pork dumpling, we order snow pea tips and warm soya drink which in total came to $35...hmmm.. 
Atmosphere is busy and if you're looking for a quiet and relaxing dinner I'd recommend somewhere else. It's like being in a market."}
{"text":"This place has amazing soup dumplings! My family and I visit this place every time we visit Toronto.  We also like the turnip cakes."}
{"text":"My family and I really like this place for soup dumplings and other delicious snacks.  The ingredients are fresh, tasty and authentic! There's always a line whichever location we visit. I highly recommend showing up early or super late if you don't want to wait."}
{"text":"This is definitely NOT the Ding Tai Fung from Taiwan, which is a Michelin-starred chain. Not sure why the Taiwanese restaurant giant hasn't filed a lawsuit yet against this place."}
{"text":"This stands as my top 3 when it comes to Shanghainese food....the food quality has pretty much stayed the same for many years which I hafta give them credit for...

Love the steam dim sum...ALL OF IT! the best thing is that when it comes to the dumplings, there are more veggies inside than pork...which is a huge plus because the other places there is so much pork, makes me feel like i'm eating fat...every single piece...the wrappings are thin and light compared to other places which don't care about it..

I love the veggie wonton in soup, its around $5.99 and there are quite a few pieces in there....fills me up! =)

As to the cooked side, not my fav. I think they do awesome in dim sum as thats what most people go for...

Go in for the dim sum and you won't regret any of it!

Have to agree with Jennifer K. that it is the top 3 Shanghai restaurants in the area!"}
{"text":"Been here a couple times in the past. The soup bun game here isn't as strong as their counterparts in Asia, but that's to be expected. Still a great place and a staple of FMP that continues to go strong over the years."}
{"text":"This place definitely didn't meet my expectations. The sui long bao wrappers lack the texture of the authentic ones, which tend to be a little thicker in order to contain the soup. But must admit their pork belly with pickled veggies was really good. They use home made picked veggies and not store bought. Wouldn't go back because it wasn't an authentic Shanghai experience for me."}
{"text":"Great Chinese dumplings. The food is always flavorful, fast and good. Some dishes are a bit oily if you are a health freak. If you order steamed dumplings, you will be fine, xiao-long-bao are simply delicious."}
{"text":"Came here in a group of 4 for Saturday \"brunch\" at around 1030. We must be early risers in this area because I arrived at 1020 and the plaza was virtually empty. The restaurant opened at 1030 and was pretty quiet until it started approaching 12. I've heard this place can get really popular so if you're like me and want to avoid crowds, come before 12. The place feels big especially with it's high ceilings and tables that are a good distance from each other (something I find rare in some Asian restaurants). There's also a cool window where you can look into the area where they make their dumplings

We ordered the following:
- xiao long bao (soup dumplings) which were great for the first dumpling but quickly cooled at which point you could really taste the oil and salt. 
- pan fried pork dumplings which were massive and juicy 
- Shanghai style pork buns which weren't but but also unremarkable
- green onion pancake which was pretty standard
- pork and chive pocket which I think has mostly chives
- Shanghai style sauteed noodles with shrimp which were good

Overall I think this place gets a lot of hype and while its still pretty decent, I feel like there are better places to pay (we ended up paying around 20 a person) for more amazing food."}
{"text":"I felt like a pig after seeing family and was hungry at 8:30 pm on a Saturday. We were in the area and decided to drop by.  We've been to the Ding Tai Fung in hwy 7 but was cautious as I know not all franchises are the same. I never even knew this was here so I was excited to see how large and inviting the inside was - perfect for birthday dinners and family dining.  I was greeted immediately from entering and was directed to the back for the take out counter.  Friendly and genuine service - good so far! 

I ordered Xiao long bao (little basket steamed bun) which are 6 tiny dumplings with a little soup inside.  It was exactly how I remembered it... moist with a decent amount of pork and that delocious perfectly balanced soup inside.  This is one of those dumplings you do not bite in half - you stuff the whole thing in your and pray it's not so hot you'll burn yourself! 

I also ordered wonton with spicy sauce (came with 10) and the spicy sauce comes on the size and tastes like it was made up of soy sauce, sesame oil, (maybe a little hoisin or sugar) chili and lemon or vinegar.. it was PERFECT!

Lastly, was the soy stewed pork & mushroom with egg on rice.  It was a chopped braised pork with soy sauce egg on rice. It was different from what I'm accustomed to at papa chang's but it was good! Portion size for 7.99 was ok.. 

The only reason why I can't give it a full 5 is I always look at a balance between price point and good food and the 3 items for $24 after taxes was a bit more than what I would expect.  Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"This is my go-to place for braised beef noodle soup. Very nice noodle texture and perfect broth, tender pieces of beef. Very nice!
They also have amazing \"xiu long bao\" (soup dumplings)
What are soup dumplings? No, they're not dumplings in soup. Rather, they are dumplings that have meat juice inside them. 

Price is a bit on the high side though reasonable.

It's in First Markham Place, so expect parking to be a complete nightmare. Come during off-peak hours whenever possible."}
{"text":"Yea I got fooled.  My eyes lit up when my friends told me we'd be hitting up DTF for dinner.  I ate there thinking it was a legitimate DTF chain from Taiwan.  However, as I started eating their staple dishes like the soup dumplings and spicy wontons I was not blown away.  I found that odd at the time but I was so damn hungry it didn't matter.  It didn't dawn on me at the time that this was not an official chain.  I found out later via interweb that it is a copycat.
The service was quite lacking as well.  It was very curt like a hole-in-the-wall Chinese place that just wants to keep the turnaround low.  Service at a legitimate Din Tai Fung is white glove and very courteous.
I hope Toronto has better to offer for Shanghainese and dimsum.  It would have been a 3-star review because the food was decent but the blatant copycatting of the famous name deserves a deduction."}
{"text":"LOVED their original soup dumplings, however, everything else was pretty mediocre.

This was my first time visiting Ding Tai Fung. With their reputation for having delicious food, I had really high expectations for this place. Unfortunately I was a bit disappointed at what they brought out for us overall.

First things first: Their original soup dumplings are a must-try. They are soooo good. I think they were $6.95 for 6. I had been wanting soup dumplings for weeks and these definitely satisfied that craving.

We also tried the slightly more expensive melon soup dumpling. That one was pretty bland and it really felt like they were missing something in that recipe. The two bowls of noodles we ordered, the ja jang mien and beef noodles, were both really bland and not enjoyable at all. 

The only thing that really had any taste in it other than the soup dumplings was the beef-spring onion pancake-roll. I'm not sure if it was the blandness of everything else, but this dish was so salty it was hard to eat.

The total came up to $45 for 3 people.

Overall: 4/5 for the original soup dumplings, 1/5 for the other things we ordered.

I would come back and just get a few orders of the soup dumplings, but I would probably skip the other dishes."}
{"text":"No wonder Xio Long Bao is not as good as the one I tried in other countries. It's a fake brand. It even has an extra \"g\" after Din. The world famous one is Din Tai Fung. Don't waste money there for Xio Long Bao and it's a counterfeit restaurant."}
{"text":"The pork dumplings steamed are fantastic even though i know that they're not healthy, but every once in a whille if I have to indulge then this is the place"}
{"text":"VERY busy on weekends at most times of the day. You can watch workers making dumpling after dumpling in the front of the restaurant which is pretty cool. I made a reservation but still had to wait some time. Service is typical of any Chinatown where it is slow, unless you demand it.

I ordered 4 orders of Xiao Long Bao and pork was my favorite. The soup is pretty hot, so be careful when it first comes out. The others were nice to try, but pork definitely takes the cake here. 

Spicy Wonton Soup was good and had a great kick to it. This was too much wonton but I cannot complain about leftovers.

The pan-fried pork dumplings were okay. I would have rather get ANOTHER pork XLB.

I will come back if I am ever in the area. It is kind of pricey but the good is worth it. Free hot tea! 

Fun fact: In order to get a refill without yelling is to open the pot and leave it at the edge of the table."}
{"text":"3 stars + .5 for xiao long bao

we came here for dinner last night . xiao long bao is AMAZING here . ive tried them at a couple of different places now and this is the best ive had so far . it has the most meat & soup in the dumpling AND its not scorching, tongue burning hot when it just comes out . just perfect :) so make sure you eat it right away when it comes out . mmm i can have 20 of these ! 

everything else we got (spicy peanut soup noodle, onion pancake, some porkbelly dish my bf ordered) they were okay . not bad, not excellent . we had some leftovers and im munching away on the onion pancake as i type . nomnomnom . heh :)"}
{"text":"Didn't come here just once, but TWICE during our Toronto trip a few weeks back. That should tell you how much we loved this place (or maybe we were just too lazy to find somewhere else to eat dim sum hah!). Of course, we had to try their minced pork buns (xiao long bao), both their dried scallop ones and crab meat ones. Just like what everyone else says here, those were pretty good--better than what we got at home, if I do say so myself. But it's funny: the first time I thought the crab meat ones were better but the second time around, I actually like the dried scallop ones. Hmm...

I also liked their steamed sticky rice glue. It's like a roll of sticky rice with some filling inside. Tried both their savory one and their sweet one. Both were good but I prefer the savory one myself; just all depends on your tastes.

Let's see: what else did we have that was good? Oh yeah, I liked the hot soy drink, the salty kind, as opposed to the sweet one. I've always been a fan of the salty one. And also their souffle balls stuffed with red bean paste or sesame paste. We tried the red bean ones on our first time around and then we came back and tried the sesame paste ones. Both were sweet, but I think I prefer the red bean ones myself.

The place is moderately sized. Seems like a popular place. First time we went just a little bit before lunchtime and it still was packed with people eating dim sum. The second time we went right around lunch time on a weekend and we had to wait for a table for like 15-20 min. This place does have other dishes besides dim sum in case you were wondering. We also did order the fried sliced rice cakes with pickled cabbage and shredded pork but I didn't find it anything special.

And you case you were wondering, I did take a paper menu from them (yes, I still collect those) so that's where I'm getting the actual names of the food from :P Hmm I'm getting a bit hungry just writing this now... I wonder if they'll deliver a few hundred miles across the border to me..."}
{"text":"Service was typical. Food was okay but I was super sick afterwards... they might load their food up with MSG."}
{"text":"YUMMY YUMMY YUMMY.
The best thing we had was the crab meat soup dumplings.
It was an all around totally delicious and quick serviced meal and I would make the hike up to Markham again for this fabulous food."}
{"text":"One of the best soup dumpling (crab) I've had in a long long time!! I usually go to a local place in Flushing, NY or to Joe Shanghai in Ctown (NY). But DTF put these places to shame. Their crab dumplings are just out o this world. Rice in flavor, yet not overly salty. 

The service is always nice (a change from NYC service!!). And it doesn't hurt that I was staying at the hotel across from them. I think I ate at DTF over 5 times while I was in TO for a week!"}
{"text":"Pension Babe and I tried to get some deep fried milk after a $2 Tuesday (but it's not) movie. The place was full. She pointed out Ding Tai Fung and suggested they served up some good Shanghai style dumplings.

\"The kind with the water in them?\"

\"Yes.\"

I had those several times in Seoul at a Shanghai dumpling place in Myeong Dong and was keen to try them again.

I let Pension Babe do the ordering. Well, she hid the english menu from me and claimed there was only a Chinese tick sheet. Like I'm going to over rule her choice?

She loaded up on all kinds of comfort food she enjoyed as a child in HK. Life hasn't fully gone her way lately, despite my efforts. Why can't some women just let you tie them to a chair and let you ooze goodness all over them? 

I've already realized if Pension Babe doesn't know how to describe something she just compares it to a donut. \"This is like a donut wrapped in rice.\" The donut wrapped in rice wasn't so great. The rice was dry. It met with neither my inexperienced approval nor Pension Babe's.

Next up was a loaf of bread you dip in sweet and condensed milk. \"This is like a donut you dip in sweet milk. I used to order this all the time just to drink the milk. My mother eventually figured out I just liked the milk and she'd order me that instead of wasting so much bread.\"

The dumpling mains came. Pension Babe thought their quality had slid over the years. I thought they were pretty good. 

The green onion pancakes came and were not compared to a donut.

Dessert was these amazing Asian sort of choux pastry balls filled with some bean goup. \"These are like donuts with white powdered sugar,\" Pension Babe explained. Pension Babe snatched the plate away and dumped as much white sugar on her Asian sort of choux pastry balls. They didn't beat the ass off deep fried milk. But pretty good for a night after Bad Teacher at the lousy First Markham Place theater."}
{"text":"So I decided to come back to Ding Tai Fung to give it another chance.  I mean, I had to have had a bad experience right?  With so many good yelper reviews... I had to be wrong?  

When I got there there was a crazy line.  In my opinion this is a good sign.  It's not exactly the best thing when it's a busy day and no one is in your restaurant =/.  Anyways, I really wanted to give it another go so I decided to wait.

After sitting down, I immediately ordered the standards; Soup Filled Dumplings, Hot and Sour Soup, Szechuan Noodles and \"Spicy Cantonese Dumplings\".

To give them credit their Soup Filled Dumplings are pretty good.  I'm quite impressed on how much soup is in the dumplings without overflowing.  The pastry was quite thin as well.  The only thing I can say is that the pork filling isn't really as smooth as it could be, it's got kinda a grainy texture.  To sum up, it's good... but I've had better.

The Hot and Sour Soup isn't exactly fantastic either.  In my opinion it had way too much sour, so it kinda tasted like vinegar soup =P. Boo.

The Szechuan Noodles were pretty abysmal.  The colour alone of the noodles was a light brown, almost like a double double coffee colour.  Bah!  It didn't really taste like they had enough heat in the wok and tasted like the noodles were microwaved (I know they weren't but that's the best thing I can think of right now =/)

The best thing by far at Ding Tai Fung is the Spicy Cantonese Dumplings.  It reminded me of dumpling kiosks in Hong Kong.  The sauce is amazing and the dumplings are amazing.  I would just order a wack of these and I'd be happy.  Then I'd probably take the sauce they have and pour it on everything (It's that good).

I have to say that I'm going to have to stand by my last review.  This place isn't that great.  Asian Legend is WAY WAY better.  And it's less than 5 minutes away!"}
{"text":"Not sure if this restaurant is the same ding tai fung in Taiwan but if it is or not this place is delicious! A busy long wait but we got seated in a decent time after 30 minutes. A direct view of the chefs making those delicious XLBs! (Xiao long bao)

The service was on point and no shortages on refills. Their complimentary tea was very aromatic. Prices are very reasonable and affordable.

My favor dish was the spicy wonton which packed a punch in spicy-ness. Every wonton had a very generous amount of stuffings. It was definitely work the money to get a dish of those bad boys.

I would love to come back again if I were to visit Canada sometime."}
{"text":"They were decent when they first opened almost 15 years ago, but at this point I recognize the names but not the dishes.  The Xiao Long Bao were okay, the filling tasted off compared to what you would get in Shanghai.  The ??? and salty soymilk is offensive to anyone actually Shanghainese.  Disgusting."}
{"text":"The servers were responsive, and food appeared on our table quickly. There's free Wi-Fi if you ask nicely for the password. The dining room is rather spacious with a high ceiling. On a weeknight at 6pm we found the restaurant to be half-empty and the waiters were standing around attentively waiting for customers to request things - that was a refreshing change from the typical over-busy restaurant.

I personally found the food to be on the oily side, and because I've had the same Chinese dishes at other restaurants before, I would recommend going to other places instead, where I think the food and prices are marginally better than what you find at Ding Tai Fung.

Strangely enough this restaurant ??? has the exactly same Chinese name as an international chain, but the logo has a different design. My best guess is that these companies are indeed distinct, and the same name is either a coincidence or a deliberate knock-off. I'm not sure what's going on here."}
{"text":"Nice shanghai restaurant to visit once in a while. It seems a bit over priced, but their dumplings are delicious. I have , however, been served raw centered pork dumplings twice on two separate occasions 1 year apart.. so I would say, yes, come by and watch them make the dumplings and enjoy the food!!, BUT just make sure you check the first dumpling before you eat the whole bamboo tray of them. They are really good though. :)

I think it's just because they were busy both times, so the kitchen had them steaming for either not long enough, or just too much volume at a time so the heat didn't reach. I still find it unacceptable to be served anything that's undercooked, especially pork meat that has been ground and god knows what kind of cross contamination could be happening back there. 

Their sui long bao (which is what everyone basically comes here for) is really flavourful. The broth in the dumplings are seasoned well and not overly salty. Just add a bit of red vinegar before you eat it and you've got a little piece of heaven. :)"}
{"text":"Beene wanting to try this place for a long time, especially the sweet buns with red bean paste but I've been told that you need to eat them fresh otherwise they deflat when you eat them later.

Ordered the Xiao long bao (large ones) 6 for$5.99
Pan fried pork dumplings 5 for $5.99
Beef Noodle soup $7.99
Shanghai pan fried bun 5 for $5.99

Total was $32 including tax.

The dumplings were ok. We weren't big fans of the meat filling.  The dumplings were huge!  Xiao longbao were just ok.  I thought it was pricey at $1 each.

Place loses points for the service.

Everyone said the service here was really great, but I found it was just average.  

We made a reservation for 7pm, we got there exactly at that time.  Yet people who walked in just before us (literally) were given tables ahead of us.  When I pointed out to them we had reservations, they said \"oh they were here before\" They assured us we would be next.  Guess what happens, what should have been our table was given to someone else.  When we pointed it out, they said \"oh, they were here before, waiting a long time\" Alright.....it took forever but we finally got a table.

I felt like we were in the Chinese Restaurant episode from Seinfeld.  Because of the seating mix up, they lost two stars.

Doubtful I want to come back, stuff is ok but nothing memorable.

Beef noodle soup wasn't that great and at $7.99 not worth it."}
{"text":"It's actually better than 2 stars, but I wanted to get your attention.  I consider myself educated, especially about where I eat.  But, I was tricked.  My friends and I were in TO for a wedding when one of us discovered Ding Tai Fung.  We were so excited because of its legendary status in Asia and the West Coast of the USA.  Upon arriving, the place is clean and service was prompt.  It even had the little glass room with guys furiously making XLB.  We ate a lot.  But, I noticed that the XLB weren't as juicy as my previous experiences in Asia.  Anyways, we finished satisfied for the most part.  As we left, my friend noticed that under the sign it read \"Shanghainese...\" not \"Taiwanese\"

Anyways, they offer a nice and yummy experience (3.5 stars).  But, DON'T BE CONFUSED, IT ISN'T THE SAME AS DIN TAI FUNG!!!!"}
{"text":"It's run by the same people of the last restaurant that opened at this location, so exactly the same health standards. Do not eat here if you want to get sick. Me and another member of my family got sick eating here. At first I thought it was a cold but then it turns out it was pneumonia which all happened after eating at this place. A few weeks later a family friend that ate here also had violent sickness. The Ministry of Health definitely needs to investigate how disgusting this place actually is."}
{"text":"Quality Shanghai food!

I love their steam pork dumplings!!  Not as good as the original place in Taiwan yet, but best in Toronto that I've tried.   Another one of my favorite is their pan fried rice cake.  It's got the best texture, soft and chewy, but not too chewy.  Their pan fried shanghai noodles are very good too."}
{"text":"This is definitely the best dim sum I have been to.  I have been here three times and each time it was just as a great an experience as the last. 
Their soup dumplings will bring me back every single time. The way the soup stays intact within those delicious dumplings is just amazing. Their spicy wonton soup was amazing. And who can forget the bao, they were just like biting into clouds. 

I have been to other dim sum places and this definitely tops my list for Toronto for now."}
{"text":"This is a great spot for xiao long bao, aka soup dumplings. I personally prefer the regular pork dumpling to the pork/crab mix, but that's just me. For the uninitiated, these are large dumplings filled with soup. The way to eat them properly is to lift one from the top using mini tongs or your fingers (so as not to puncture the dumpling) and place it on your spoon, then bite off the top, slurp a little soup out, dash some vinegar into the dumpling, slurp a little more soup and then eat the entire dumpling. Sounds involving, I know, but you don't just wanna shove these things in your mouth and chew, or hot soup is liable to explode onto your dining companion (been there, done that lol #whitechick).

We also tried the peanut noodles...which is a whole whack of thick, chewy noodles swimming in a rich peanut soup; and the garlic pea shoots, which tasted really fresh. Both were yummy in their own right, but the xiao long bao won the day.

Re: the service, I once read a Yelp review written by an Asian chick that said \"typical Chinese service...they drop off your food and they never come back\" which 100% fits the bill in this place. Sorry if that sounds totally racist (no harm nor offence intended!) but remember, she wrote it, I didn't :)"}
{"text":"Overpriced and underwhelming.  The reviews here are glowing, but I've had the real Din Tai Fung in Taipei and xiao long bao at other places that were better.  I've even had XLB in food courts that tasted better than this DTF.  

Ok, to be honest, it's not terribly bad XLB.  If you've never had it before, then this place is a decent introduction.  The issue is that the claims of this being the best XLB in the city make me feel sad about the state of chinese food in Toronto.  The soup in the XLB is pretty good.  Unfortunately, the skin is not as thin as the one in Taipei.  Taiwanese cuisine likes to mingle a bit of sweet potato flour in with the wheat flour to make the wrapping more elastic.  The XLB skin here was competently made, but without this key ingredient, it doesn't have the same stretch, and the soup doesn't burst into your mouth as you bite in.

The ground pork was not ground finely enough and also wasn't tenderized long enough.  I'm looking for a pork filling that is tender and whole, almost like a well made siu mai.  It should be the pleasure point of meaty-ness after the first taste of soup.  Unfortunately, the meat filling here tasted not much better than the meat in cheap frozen dumplings that you buy at the grocery store (2 bags for $5).  The meat just wasn't flavourful or special in any way.    

Alright, given all this, the most unforgivable sin was the price.  At about $5 for 5 pieces, this is ridiculously overpriced for such low quality.  This place is just riding on the original and authentic DTF's reputation with a counterfeit, lower-quality product.  

This place opened at 11am.  It was half full ten minutes later when I arrived.  By half past, the restaurant was packed and there were five people waiting at the atrium.  The management has no incentive at all to provide anything beyond a mediocre product with this kind of popular market demand.  

I also had the hong you zhao sou, or spicy wontons in red sauce.  The presentation wasn't as pretty as the pictures here.  The chef must have moved on, perhaps to their new location in Scarborough.  The wontons were almost flavorless.  Once again, I think the wontons shared the same pork meat mix as the XLB, and that meat wasn't marinated with sufficient ingredients or time.  The red sauce had more coloring than spice.  Quite disappointing.  There should have been some soy sauce and sesame oil in there, but I couldn't really taste them.  One of the worst examples of this dish I've had.  And it's such an easy dish to prepare too. Boil wontons and put in sauce.   How could it all go so wrong?

I also had the beef noodle soup, which I order everytime I see it on the menu.  The broth was good. Like I mentioned above, this kitchen has a good person working on the soups.  The noodles were alright.  Freshly made.  There was an initial taste of bread flour and yeast which went away as the noodles soaked in the soup.  The meat was disappointing.  Again, not much flavor, not much marinade.  It looks good, and it's tender enough, but I don't know why or how they went so easy on the seasoning and spices.  The preserved chopped pickles traditionally served with this soup were terrible.  Almost tasted like hot dog relish, but not as crisp.  Whoever made this has never had the real chopped pickled greens."}
{"text":"Love this place for their steamed dumplings and shao lung bao !  Service is great but remember to make reservations beforehand. Also very happy that they accept credit cards"}
{"text":"I have to admit that after reading about this restaurant in the news, i was a bit nervous to come here. Luckily, it was better than expected. This is one of the best dumpling houses in markham!

They make some amazing soup dumplings, spicy ones, and sweet versions. They literally have something for eveyone."}
{"text":"Living off its fame for dumpling but not living up to its reputation.

If ur craving for dumpling it is still a good place to visit. But Don't order anything another food.

We probably been here four five times already but other food became so bad I had to do a review.


We ordered a siu long bao it's really good. It's expected Cuz that's why we came here.
We also ordered a Shanghai fried rice cake oh my.... I have never had a whole spoon of oil left in my bowl..

And for the pork rice bowl was ok but the \"soup\" that accompanied the rice bowl was disastrous. It's basically corn starch mix with water. 

And overall it's quite expensive. Given the quality of the food. 

Service was meh. No interaction no thank you just putting food on ur table."}
{"text":"Clean restaurant.  Slightly more expensive than other shanghainese xiao long bao dumpling restaurants.  Could be wrong but I think the taste is more targeted towards Hong Kong and western people than mainland Chinese people after some discussion with my friends of different backgrounds.  I like this place.  I come here once in a while."}
{"text":"Try Hi Shanghai restaurant and you will never to come back here!!!

Valeriy Ajax."}
{"text":"Honestly, when you eat here you have to look at it in a perspective that it is a dim sum place. Though, my thoughts were that I could of eaten somewhere better with a lower price and not that long of a wait. We waited 45 minutes for a table, though the dumplings were good but you can find a place similar (aka Asian legend). The chicken fried rice was really salty and was not worth the price. The chicken was rubbery.The sweet and sour pork chop was good but the portion was too small but for almost $14 is too much. The soup dumplings and fried dumplings taste exactly like the ones at Asian legend but there more expensive at Ding Tai Fung (this is where you have to look at it at the other perspective in which this place is specifically for dim sum which makes it expensive)."}
{"text":"Overall rated.  Food is not that great. Service was mediocre. Would not come back here again. Good to try once"}
{"text":"March 31, 2018 - the soup dumplings are delicious *a must try* but there is a red sauce (I forgot to order it, I think it's vinegar.. it tasted great with the soup dumplings when I first went to DTF). The other dish had pork with rice in it (i don't remember the name)"}
{"text":"A little pricey. Steamed buns is not bad. Disappointed from the sweet and sour shrimp. Everything else I had was ok."}
{"text":"This has always been our go to place when it came to dumplings. It's absolutely delicious. The pork soup dumpling is made to perfection, it peels off the paper from the bottom nicely without spillage. That is if your peeling it correctly! 

Personally, I think this place is great for families with kids as younger children can take a look through the glass and see how the chefs are making the food. This has always enticed me as a kid. 

We've always ordered the dumplings, sticky rice, sweet and sour soup, beef noodles. All delicious! The only thing I wasn't a fan off was the shanghai fried noodles as I thought they could've use more flavouring in it. Whenever my family is not craving Cantonese food, we come to this place for what we call 'shanghainese dim sum'"}
{"text":"Honestly, I don't know what some of these other reviewers are smoking.

I have had xiao long bao (soup dumplings) almost everywhere including at Ding Tai Fungs in Taipei (original location, twice), Seattle, Sydney, and this one (4-5 times). Hands down the xiao long bao here are the best. A place that is comparable is Joe's Shanghai in NYC.

The xiao long bao here are incredibly juicy and soupy inside, which is the way they should be. No, they are not cheap, but you can get cheap almost anywhere. Try the xiao long bao here. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"To my understanding, this restaurant isn't the real Din Tai Fung franchise but since people had given great reviews we thought we'd try it out. We got two orders of the Pork Soup Dumplings because we knew one order wouldn't be enough. They came out fresh and they were very succulent and delicious! The Steamed Shrimps and Pork Siu Mai were also incredible, probably one of the best siu mai we've tasted in Toronto. We wanted a meat, rice and vegetable dish so we ordered the Sweet & Sour Pork; Shrimp, Ham & Egg fried rice; and Garlic Baby bok choy. Just like any other Chinese restaurant, they all tasted great. This dim sum restaurant turned out to be much better than we expected. We will definitely come back to this restaurant for their soup dumplings and pork siu mai!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here since it opened as Xiao Long Bao. Same people. Same food. The place is nice and large and can get quite busy for lunch on weekends. Open till 11 PM, it's good for a later dinner too. I enjoy coming here for the different dumplings.

This visit, we ordered a hot and sour soup, xiao long bao, steamed chive dumplings, spicy oil dumplings and a sticky rice roll (my favourite). Honestly this time all the dumplings' skin were a little dry and got a little hard, so it didn't seem as good. I'll probably still come back and hope it's better next time, because the taste is good. The spicy oil dumplings are very flavourful. Their rice roll was small but good, one of my favourite items at these kind of restaurants.

Price is on the slightly higher end for Shanghai style food, the meal for two ended up around $33. Once again, hopefully the next time it's better again."}
{"text":"I can't say that I'm very well versed in Shanghai dim sum. I am more familiar with the Cantonese style, even though I'm Hakka and grew up with an even different style. None of that really matters, however, if the food tastes good. This food tasted pretty good.

We ordered dumplings, pancakes, and a few other dishes, way too much food for three of us. The portions are larger than the Cantonese dim sum places I'm used to. That's not a complaint.

The only negative thing was the cost of our meal. Dim sum for three people was a tad over $73. I'm not used to paying that much for dim sum. The dumpling houses I've been to in Markham were considerably cheaper."}
{"text":"Mediocre food and very reluctant service. Xiao long bao cravings are much better served in Flushing, NY."}
{"text":"Came to this dumpling house lastnight. It was 45 minutes before closing. Sat down and the waitress said it was last call. Ordered a bunch of dumplings and when the pan fried dumplings came out I ate a few and realized the texture was mushy. I looked inside the dumpling and it was raw. It was pink and as I dug my chopsticks through it, it was red in the middle. Gross. I lost my appetite instantly. I complained to the waitress and she said she will cancel the dumplings off the order. After about 30 mins I had a bad stomach ache. I am also pregnant. I suffered food poisoning all night. I will not be coming back to this place ever!"}
{"text":"Great dim sum! Came in with my family of seven who live nearby. Service was good, and the dumplings were excellent. We had the Xiao Ling Boa, Chive Pork Dumplings( my favorite), spicy wonton, udon noodles, and some other noodle soup. The noodles were freshly made and had that nice texture, chewiness but the noodles were cooked well."}
{"text":"Although this is NOT the real Ding Tai Fung from Taiwan; however, this is still the best xiao long bao in Toronto.

I'm still hoping the real Ding Tai Fung can open their store in Toronto, which may beat this Ding Tai Fung :-D

For more info re: the real Ding Ting Fung, here's the link: http://www.dintaifung.com.tw/en/news_detail.asp?NewsNO=168"}
{"text":"Very very poor serivce and the food is really bad compare other Shanghai restaurant..won't be there again."}
{"text":"What can I say about this place that hasn't already been said -fresh, made from scratch and worth the 30 minute wait at 2pm on a sunday afternoon for a late lunch. 

We ordered a combination of dim sum and entrees. Dumplings are DIVINE, made from scratch fresh in house, so are the noodle dishes, the seasoned greens were exquisite, the braised bamboo was so - so but the onion pancakes were great.

Don't be intimidated by the lineup, the end result is worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Went there again last night and ordered new items, you gotta try the veggie dumplings, amazing. We had dinner this time and I knew how much to order. This place has ruined me for dumplings elsewhere, not sure anything will measure up. If you want the best dumplings hands down, go here."}
{"text":"One of my favourite places to get my Shanghainese fix. They are consistently good and this is why theu are constantly busy. I would suggest making reservations for big groups."}
{"text":"I was extremely disappointed when I found out this was not the real din tai fung franchise that I knew best in Shanghai. It's a fake :(

Regardless, the food is still pretty good. I usually get the Xiao long bao and the pan fried dumplings. Their deep fried pork chop with soup noodles was a bit disappointing since the soup and pork chop lacked flavour."}
{"text":"I love the dumplings here! Much better than anything in Chicago. As others have said, the xiao long bao are awesome. My favorite were the dumplings stuffed with sticky rice and pork. GET THOSE. So delicious. The space is clean. The servers speak English. Easy to find parking in the lot. If you love Shanghai style dumplings, you must give this place a try!"}
{"text":"I would love to give this place 4 stars but their entire menu isn't the best which is why I have to keep it to 3. Come here for the soup dumplings, everything else is still good but overpriced for it."}
{"text":"Like an old comfy sweater or a reliable pair of jeans, this place is a go-to for a hearty yet light, refreshing yet comforting, meal in any season.

I've visited this place many times, and it's one of the most reliable places for solid, delicious, freshly-made dumplings. Yes, it's a bit pricey, and the wait times can be lengthy if you visit during peak hours. But if you come visit during off-peak times (i.e. I've visited on Saturdays for a late lunch or weekdays for a late dinner), the wait isn't too long (if you even have to wait at all).

I've ordered many variations of their dumplings and side dishes, including their juicy pork dumplings, pork ribs, pot stickers, sticky rice and pork shao mai, and many orders of the soup dumplings that explode in your mouth the minute you bite into it. Every item I've had here has been very delicious and fresh, if not slightly pricey. But, I'm such a fan of the soup dumplings that, in this instance, the tastiness and quality of the food actually warrants the prices. Really great, quality food.

Note that it's located in a huge plaza with ample parking. However, on weekends, the First Markham Place plaza gets extremely busy so, again, if you want a more enjoyable experience without the frustration of finding parking or waiting longer than 15 minutes for a table, consider coming at off-peak meal hours."}
{"text":"Been meaning to try Ding Tai Fung many times, because it's quite well-known within the Chinese community and the place seems to be always packed. I came after a long boxing day shopping at around 7:30pm and the restaurant had a long lineup as usual, and we waited for around 50 minutes for a table for 3.

Environment:
The good old First Markham Place plaza again where there's an abundance of Asian restaurants. And guess what, the parking is a nightmare. Do yourself (and your sanity) a favour and go look for parking near the Home Outfitters and walk for an extra minute or two if you're coming by this plaza on a weekend. 
As for the Ding Tai Fung restaurant itself, the space is actually smaller than expected, given their usual crowd, so expect to wait if you're coming during dining heavy traffic times. The interior has a nice ambiance and is well renovated. There are some booth tables for 4 on the sides and larger round tables in the middle for larger groups. I would suggest making a reservation for if you're coming in a big group.  

Food:
Here's the good part: the food is terrible, and I absolutely mean it. The terribleness can be defined by the combination of lack of flavour and pricey-ness of the meal. We ordered 6 items in total: crab meat xiao long bao, deep fried tentacles, stir fry shanghai noodles with shrimp, deep fried pork intestines, beef pancake wrap, and warm sweet soya milk (made fresh in house).
1) The Xiao Long Bao was alright, I like the fact that the skin was super thin and the soup inside the bun was really flavourful. That's about it. The crab wasn't worth the extra price, because they didn't use fresh crab meat, it was dry crab meat, and it came out really stringy and the texture was like eating straw. 
2) Stir fry Shanghai noodles with shrimp looked like something I could make better at home when I first saw it (see picture). It looked and tasted super home-made, but with like 5 times the price than if you were to buy the ingredients and make it yourself. A huge let down.
3) Deep fried tentacles was alright, probably the only decent dish besides the Xiao Long Bao, though it was still over-priced compare to many other Asian restaurants offering the same dish. Nothing very spacial here in terms of taste and texture.
4) Deep fried pork intestines came in very small and had no flavour. It did come with some sort of flavouring powder on the side. Upon tasting it, I was sure that the mystery powder was MSG. Like seriously...the food was so bland that they're basically you MSG to enhance the taste.      
5) Beef Pancake Wrap was another ok dish, wasn't spectacular, but if you need something filling because the rest of the foods were so bite-sized, this is a good choice. 
6) The Soya Milk was ok as well, you can tell it's home made, and the price was finally reasonable for once. It came in a big bowl so it's good to share with the entire table. Order the warm version (not the cold soya milk in the dessert section) for better taste. 

Service:
Meh service. Kinda difficult to get hold of a server because the place was so busy. 

In conclusion: don't bother coming...everything is too over-priced and the restaurant is just too over-hyped. Other than the Xiao Long Bao, everything else that we ordered came out bland and definitely not worth the price given the ingredients/portion size/flavour. Also, the wait for a table is never an enjoyable experience. So please, don't bother eating here."}
{"text":"What made the 8 hour drive from Chicago to Markham totally worth it, were the xiao long baos from this dim sum joint!! Each bao was perfect. Thin dumpling skin, steamed just right, the meat was seasoned very well and you get a VARIETY of choices for filling, and the SOUP. The soup was like USHER - OMG, amazing. It wasn't just a tiny bit of soup, it was enough to fill my entire mouth.

All the dumplings we ordered were DELICIOUS, the hand-made noodles were just right and seasoned very well, everything we had was just too good to be true. No wonder people line up eagerly waiting for a seat.

Please go. For me. Cause I can't drive 8 hours every single weekend to get my fill of delicious bao."}
{"text":"Heard a lot of this place from friends and my husband wanted to try this place. We came, waited 15 mins for table and shared it with another couple. The food was good, new for me since I don't eat northern Chinese food often. I like most of everything we ordered. Although I can't say I even know what we ordered... my husband did the ordering. Loved the soup dumplings and there were a bunch of things we wanted to order too but we were over ordering as is. The service was nice and fast. Thank u."}
{"text":"DTF was introduce to me when a friend brought me to the flagship store in Taiwan eight years ago. It was a very impressive five story high building. We were there on a Sunday afternoon, I remember the line already formed half hour prior to opening. The experience was unique, to watch through the glass store front window of so many people inside making nothing but soup dumplings. Then to climb the stairs to one of the level to be sited in a very crowed space. And everyone was eating the same thing. So having tasted the original, I would venture to say this DTF's Dumplings are very close to the real deal and being consistently good for all my visits. Soy milk, sticky rice roll and other dishes I had was equally tasty! 
Service is just ok, not particular friendly. But the food alone deserved the four stars.  Will be back!"}
{"text":"So apparently it's not real Shanghainese cusine, but that's alright, because it's still pretty good.

Came here one evening for a late dinner -- ordered some dumplings, snowpea leaves, noodles, and some bean curd/tofu thing. Food came out reasonably quickly (with the dumplings taking the longest, not surprisingly). It was enjoyable, but nothing particularly special.

My only gripe is that I found everything to be a bit on the saltier side. Everything -- except maybe the dumplings. It just seemed to be really grease/oil-heavy overall. This especially bothers me when it comes to the stir-fried veggies; there's really no need to oversalt them, especially with something as good as snowpea leaves. That I found the place salty does say quite a bit, because I find myself to have a pretty high tolerance for salt compared to most of my compadres. As far as the dumplings go, these are some of the best Chinese dumplings I've had in awhile (personally I've developed more of a liking for Korean dumplings lately).

Service was pretty good as far as Chinese places go."}
{"text":"Came here several times for lunch/dinner.  It's a popular restaurant here at First Markham Place.

I usually order the spicy beef noodle soup here, or a rice dish.  I remember years ago when the spicy beef noodle soup was amazing.  Then a few years ago, they changed the recipe, and I rarely came here ever since.  It's now called \"double boiled\" I think it was, and has a strange deep fragrant.  Wish they had the old recipe again.

Recommended for good Taiwanese food in Markham area."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday afternoon at around 11:30am and the place was already packed. Only had to wait about 2 minutes before we were called in to be seated. Ordered a variety of dishes and all turned out very good. 

I still think the noodles in peanut and spicy sauce, aka (dandan noodles), was better at 369 Shanghai because they had the perfect balance of peanut and spicy sauce. Everything thing else is on par. Service is fast even though they are really busy. 

Price is comparable to other Shanghai dim sum places but I find the price for this type of food overly priced in general. Each dish may seem like a small price to pay by itself but once you start adding all these little dishes together the final price hits you like a ton of bricks at the end. 

The food is delicious though so in the end its all worth it."}
{"text":"A-OK+0.5 

Food is decent and relatively consistent.  Long line up and \"long\" wait for food (compared to other chinese restaurants)

Ate the Dan-Dan mien and beef noodle soup...honestly...prefer loha's next door on these two items....I guess just not the right flavor for me :(

Also ordered the dumplings of course...and good as well....

Will likely return if I'm really hungry and loha's is closed :)"}
{"text":"Walked in here for lunch and met a few friends.  You know the place is good when you see it packed with locals when there are so many other restaurants in the area to choose from.  Best thing about their dim sum is everything is freshly made, not frozen.  Even the rice wrapper was freshly made in store.  Pretty inexpensive, too."}
{"text":"Luckily we had a Chinese person in our group, because otherwise if you don't speak Chinese, it's a bit difficult to choose food here. The drunken soup dumplings, the chive pancakes, and all the other dishes we tried were all good. There's also a cool viewing area to see them make the dim sum to show how fresh it is."}
{"text":"Terrible service. We were the only one in the store when we arrived. 2 other table arrived later than us got all their food. We asked the waitress twice about our food. She told us it's coming and didn't even bother checking with the cooks. Half an hour later still waiting so we asked this other waiter. He went back and came back saying it's almost finished. My dad saw them our order while he was telling us it takes longer to make them. Which was a complete lie as I've had their food before. They totally forgot to make our order. Never will come back. Food isn't even that good."}
{"text":"Came with my Grandma to eat some authentic Northern Chinese food. She can certify that this is certainly Northern food with a mix of Shanghainese (Xiao Long Baos). We ordered:

Fried dough (yui tao) dipped in sweet soy milk
fried dumplings
xiao long baos
fried buns
some red bean rice cake thing for the dessert
stir fried greens

Everything was delicious, especially the Xiao Long Baos! Would pass on the red bean rice cake, wasn't anything special. Also, if you're counting calories I would avoid here because they use a lot of oil (especially for the greens). But fat is flavour!"}
{"text":"hrmm, last time I was here it was almost a year ago.  Not much has changed in the passing of time.

This place is pretty much serves all day Shanghai-style dim sum. Food-wise, it is pretty consistent and decent and it shows because if you hit this place up at peak time, it can be pretty packed.

This visit was a UYE, thanks to Edwin A. for organizing and we got a private room, due to the fact that we were a large party, (13-14 people).

I'm not sure if it was the norm if you get the private room; but we definitely got the A++ service chinese-style this time around. 

On the menu today, we ordered the famed siao lung boa that DTF has to offer pork, pork with crab and pork with dried scallop. Over all taste, pretty good and soupy as it should be, I think the one with crab meat was my favorite; with just pork not too far behind.

Their pan friend buns weren't too bad, but I've been to at least one other place that might be smidgen better.

Their chao len goh is pretty good too, with just the right amount of chew to the fried rice cakes, the option to get shanghai-style or the ching-chow,  I recommend the ching chow, since it is without the soy sauce, and shanghainese food is generally heavy of the salt and soy-sauce.

The only small tiny tiny grippe I had was about their savory soy bean soup... it was ok, but I missed the hit of heat from the chili oil and I didn't get salty part of it this time around and why is there yuk soong in it? It makes the soup  feel all fuzzy... which feels weird and off putting. Also their egg white souffle balls dusted with icing sugar and stuffed with red bean or Black sesame weren't too bad either, just a triffle overdone."}
{"text":"I've been to this spot 3 times (and it's a 25 min drive for me).  I really enjoy the food, atmosphere, service.  I have a constant craving for their wonton in spicy peanut sauce - just delicous.  The homemade dumplings are great - love the soup explosion - you can taste the home-made (not to mention you can watch them making them).  I wish they had more selection of the homemade noodles - which are great but it seems only to be the thicker shanghai noodles and not a huge selection of soups.  I tried Mother's dumplings downtown and the food here was far superior (actually found the dumplings at Mother's bland and too thick).  This place is worth the drive"}
{"text":"3 1/2 stars.

Solid shanghainese food! good but not mind blowing, def a good option if you are in Markham.  I hear the Ding Tai Fung in Asia is OODLES of better.  The soup dumplings were good but dare I say not soupy enough? but were still good. The minced pork with brown sauce over noodles was good but it lacked flavor kick.   Scallion pancakes were good, lumps of scallion and slightly flakey and crispy on the outside.  Shanghainese chow mein was average at best.  All in all a place I'd def come again to give it another shot.  

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Had a fantastic lunch here with a work colleague!  The shanghai pork dumplings are awesome!  So is the cold chicken marinated in wine! So is the peanut noodle soup!  Actually everything I have had here is pretty awesome! i'd recommend coming early as it is popular with the HK'ers and mainland people living nearby Markham-Richmond Hill."}
{"text":"I do like their dumplings. They taste very fresh and have good flavoring. Their wonton soup, xiao long bao, and chive dumplings were all very nice. I would go on a week night because there's no line... weekends are crazy, expect a long line."}
{"text":"My last visit has sank the rating to a 3.5.

Believe it or not, in my last visit here the worst food that I had was the xiao long bao. I recently came back from NYC where I went to places such as Shanghai Cafe and Nan Xiang, so it made sense to compare it back to this place, except either DTF had a bad day, or their xiao long bao quality has really gone down...basically, there was barely any soup in them! They're called \"soup dumplings\", yet they have barely any soup?

The saving grace for this place is their other items are still as great as ever, such as the green onion pancake and beef rolls and alcohol chicken. However I might need to find another place for good xiao long bao (A La Kitchen is a hit and miss)...or wait until my annual NYC trip in order to have real soup dumplings.

I'm definitely not in a rush to return in the short term. Maybe if I have relatives coming I'll come back."}
{"text":"Our favorite dumpling house.  So yummy and fresh. The soup dumplings is on point.  The Shanghai dumplings are also very good. Perfect level of spice."}
{"text":"This Ding Tai Fung in Scarborough is a lot better than the one in Markham. It used to be called Xiao Long Bao, not sure why they renamed it. I like this location as it has pretty comfortable seating, it's very spacious.

The xiao long bao are quite good, it's not super thin, but they are steamed piping hot and have a good amount of filling. Also had the beef roll, soup noodles and the Shanghai fried noodles. The fried noodles were bit salty when I came.

It might be hard to find a place to park here on weekend afternoons, since it's in a fairly popular plaza.

Credit cards are accepted, which is good because the items are pricey for a Chinese restaurant!"}
{"text":"Great service, love their dumplings. Prices are on the higher side...if you compare them to the other competitors.  There was a time when my grandma would pick this place as our Sunday lunch spot.

I started coming here since they first opened. I still remember the day when I walked in...looking at the area with a team of dumpling makers and those massive tables and those piping hot xiao lung bao + pot stickers. 

This Ding Tai Fung  (aka Fang's) is not a part of the mega global chain, but the owners did learn all the skills from the actual chain before they opened this location.  The owners themselves have a strong Shanghainese restaurant background and so I have a lot of respect for these owners---I have no idea whether it's the same owners or if they have sold the business etc---"}
{"text":"It's okay. Good service. I've had better xiao long bao elsewhere.  Seems a lot of their food is premade or frozen then steamed. I'd come back, but their food isn't the greatest. Sorry!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant. Second location to the one at First Markham Place. Dumplings are the primary reason for coming here. And the dumplings are to die for. Had the soup filled dumplings were little morsels of heavenly goodness. Also had the salty soy milk, and it was the best I've had in Toronto. Be sure to have it with a Chinese donut."}
{"text":"Well..... after having the real DTF in Seattle, this just doesn't measure up 

Maybe the dishes we ordered were just boring, but this place is so average for the Chinese dishes it offers.  The XLB was pretty good I suppose, but all the other dishes (veggies, specialty noodles, steamed rice with sausages, turnip cakes, etc) are what you can get at any Chinese resto..  I'm not even quite sure why I'm reviewing this actually, just don't come here if you wanted actual Ding Tai Fung but can't make a trip down to Taiwan or the States; this isn't it..."}
{"text":"BEST SPICY WONTONS EVER

hot and sour soup is to die for


Huge portions

I drive from Barrie for this place"}
{"text":"This place used to be good but their quality has gone downhill and their prices skyrocketed....we got the soup filled dumplings for $6.25 and u only get 6 pieces....what a rip off and I can't justify the Shanghai noodles we got for $11, take a look at my pic, the fmp food court could prolly make the same dish same quality for half the price....this place is a RIP OFF and also a rip off of the original din tai Fung in Taiwan"}
{"text":"Have been going here for years.  The owners are Taiwanese brothers, but they are not affiliated with the Ding Tai Fung in Taiwan, they just use their name.  

The dumplings here are the best you can get outside of Taiwan, I would give it a 8 out of 10 when compared to the real stuff in Taiwan.  The pork pot stickers are good, but sometimes I just don't think it's fully cooked as the pork seemed a bit too pink.

The hot pot is also one of our favorit, and you can ask them to refill the soup when you are almost done.  Beef noodle is good too, but not as good as the one down the street.  If you have a craving for dumplings, this is definitely the place to go."}
{"text":"Will the real DTF please stand up? Okay maybe this is not the real one, but I have tried the DTF in LA, and I'm sorry but our fake DTF has da best dumplings by far! Been here sooo many times I forget how many, and other than the waiting for a table, every time it's a royal dumpling feast. I cannot pin point a favourite ... everything is amazing ... maybe the pork and shrimp dumplings, or the green onion pancake, or the xiaolongbao (love how the broth oozes into my mouth). The dumplings are perfectly cooked, never soggy. Bring lots of people so you can try a bit of everything, the menu is extensive!"}
{"text":"Among the best Xiao long bao in gta. Lots of good dishes here. I also like their beef noodle soup. Try their dumplings and pancakes. Spicy wonton is the best here. Also soy drink."}
{"text":"My cousin tells me this place is a knock off of the Taiwanese chain but that does not matter since everything we had was delicious. The dumplings juicy, Noodles tasty, Huge pork and tofu meatball stew excellent. Service was quick and the lines waiting were long. I'd come back to this place if I was ever to find myself in Toronto again."}
{"text":"First of all, this is a fake Ding Tai Fung. It has no relation to the well-known eatery head officed in Taiwan. So if your only purpose of going is to check out the hype on Ding Tai Fung, then don't go. Otherwise proceed.
Obviously, being a fake Ding Tai Fung, this restaurant is nothing parallel to the brand name restaurant. 
To be fair, I'm not going to make any comparison. 
The restaurant is always so crowded. Food is very pricie for Chinese food. I only went twice - both time for reservation made by friends. 
I'm not unsatisfied by their food. Neither am I extremely happy. I love Xiao long bao (Shanghai steamed meat buns). This joint is just over rated. You get the same quality of steamed meat buns in quite a lot of dumpling houses now and foregoing the price associated with a fake brand name."}
{"text":"I'm returning to this place for the second time in a row during my stay here in Canada. This place definitely deserves five stars because of its great  customer service and the foods are awesome too. I've been around town for the last few days and seen really lousy service which i doubt about coming back to this town until I've found this restaurant. Best of all, it had no problem accepting credit cards because most of the restaurants would not take credits cards which is so inconvenience for me as a foreigner... The Shanghai soup dumplings are great and most of the dishes that I've ordered are delish ... Can't wait to come back again on my next trip."}
{"text":"Not bad, but it is more of a generic Shanghai style cuisine operating under the banner of the famous original."}
{"text":"The xiao long bao (dumpling with soup inside) is the thing to order here.  They were really good!  I also highly recommend the crab and pork dumplings.  Shanghai wontons were surprisingly good.  Tasty and not heavy.  Steamed pork bun was mediocre.  Mapo tofu was good but not amazing.  This is a Shanghainese style restaurant so don't expect your typical dim sum (Hong Kong).  It's more expensive than a dim sum place, but still only $65 for 4 people for lunch and we took leftovers home.  I would go back."}
{"text":"This is obviously not the famous original Ding Tai Fung- so let's not compare them! 

There is a vast menu and most things I've tried here range from solid to very tasty! The kitchen is impressive- the quality, quantity and variety of food they make is well done. I especially enjoy watching them make different dumplings by the window into the kitchen! The xiao long bao (dumplings filled with rich pork and piping hot soup) are a popular order. They are also priced as such. Make sure to eat these while hot- once they cool down, they don't taste as good as the oiliness of the pork really comes through. It is served with a red vinegar and some fresh ginger slivers than can help cut the greasy taste (but just eat them while hot). The wait times during peak hours are ridiculous but I am willing to do it once in a while. Unfortunately, the staff here are cold and rude enough for me to remove 1 star."}
{"text":"This place is not the real din tai fung if that was the reason why you wanted to eat here. The dumpling skin is very thick and very little soup inside the xiao long baos. 

I forgot what else we ordered but quickly regretted ordering so much food as we should've saved our stomach for a different restaurant."}
{"text":"If it wasn't for the shanghai little beef dumplings. I wouldn't come. Everything else is ok. What I like about this place is that you can always come by yourself or in a large group. There something in the menu for 1, 2 , or more people."}
{"text":"pricey but good dumplings the wait time on weekends is crazy 
-1 stars cause the staff needs to work more, you'd have to repeat what you need twice"}
{"text":"This is not the world famous restaurant but a shameless copycat!!!! They copied everything. The food is crapy and they dare to use the real Din Tai Fung's name. 

Yes, you are reading it right. The real one is DIN, not dinG. 

The food quality is nowhere close to the original. I was wondering why their food doesn't taste as good as before and they serve different food from the real one.  Then I did a little googling and found out that this is not the real one. They copied everything from the real on and cheat everyone. Don't waste you time and money."}
{"text":"Previously known as Xiao Long Bao, it's copy of the famous Din Tai Fung restaurants in Asia. I personally prefer this location to the one in Markham because it's less crowded and the atmosphere is more relaxed.
If you like Chinese food, this place is really great. They have plenty of dishes to choose from, including their famous XLB dumplings. My personal favourites are their XLB soup dumplings, vegetarian dumplings, bean curd with pickled cabbage and soy beans, string beans and most of their greens, especially bean leaves. What I don't like is that many of their dishes are very oily (for example their onion pancake was drowning in oil, so unappetizing). They also add MSG to their dishes, something that I think is totally unnecessary.
If I compare this restaurant to Din Tai Fung restaurants in Shanghai, Hong Kong and Singapore (where I learned about DTF in the first place), I think there is lots of room for improvement."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants for XLB dumplings. Have been such a fan of Ding Tai Fung when I lived in Shanghai and Singapore, so I was very excited when I discovered that DTF is also Ontario. This restaurant has the best XLB, and I also like their vegetarian dumplings and string beans. I wish they had some dishes that I ate in Asia, however I know that they have slightly different menu in each country. I am not a big fan of their fried pancakes and pies, just because they are way too oily. Not appetizing at all. But they have plenty of greens, that can be a healthier option, in case if you want something on a healthier side. And their steamed dumplings are so good!"}
{"text":"Sunday night at 6:30pm

Parking lot is pretty much full!! You have to drive around and get lucky.

We had a table for 15.

I have to say that the service is good.  The waitresses are busy, but efficient!

I ask for water.... i get water!
I ask for a fork.... i get a fork.

4 stars for service!

The soup dumplings are not just good, they're great!! The pan fried dumplings are good too.

The other dishes are meh...

So i'm giving an overall 3 stars"}
{"text":"Xiaolongbao: Very Good
Spicy Pork Wonton: Very Good
Pan Fried Dumpling: Good
Everything Else: OK
Shiu Mai: Not Good
Beef wraps: Skip
Ding tai Fung is a copycat concept and name from the famous Taiwanese restaurant with the similar name (Din tai Fung) there and like it idol also has a view to the kitchen and the cooks.
The rare Xialongbao is warm, tasty and satisfying. The spicy pork wanton is also delicious and reliable. Everything else is done better in most other places. the beef wraps are disappointing and the pan fried dumplings always undercooked. They have fancy Shiu mai with seafood or sticky rice to charge more than regular shiu mai, but they are disappointing. Stick with what they do here.
The restaurant recently reopened after renovations, but I could not see any difference in appearance between the 'new' room and the 'old.' The crowds are still as large as ever and you could easily wait 40 minutes to get a table during peak hours. You still cannot find parking in the plaza either.
Lunch for 4: $100 (and now they have portable card machines too)"}
{"text":"don't be fooled - this is only an inmitation of the real Ding Tai Fung form Taiwan.  this one thinks it can get away with a very misleading name and sign - the name is practically the same except for one tiny different in how the first word Ding is written.  as for the food, I am not impressed.  they are not quite bland, the meat in the soup dumpoing is chopped and dry - the vinegar is the wrong kind - the shanghai noodles has not taste and barely any meat/veg in it  at all - the famous winter soup Yen Du Shien is not good either - it lacks the freshness and authenticity of what that soup should be like if all the ingredients are prepared correctly - I am very disappointed - don't understand why the big crow and long wait.  again, I think it is a shame that they stole a really good restaurant's name, reputation, and try to profit from it.  very dishonest."}
{"text":"Still the same exact menu, workers, and WiFi before the name change. 

Both their crab and pork xiao long bao are our go to and certainly not be missed. 

Tried a few new items on this trip - dan dan noodles and fried mantou. 

Dan dan noodles were cooked well but the dish was just overwhelming heavy. It needed some kind of sweetness or acid to cut the dish. Okay to share but wayyyy too much for me. 

Fried mantou - they used the twisty buns - crispy and warm - couldn't go wrong with condensed milk. 

Retried their beef rolls - after having them a handful of times in LA, I noticed instead of cilantros, here they used sliced scallions. Reminded me more Peking duck especially with the plum sauce. Overall - thought it was okay. I personally prefer fresh cilantro any day. 

Overall - will continue to be our go to for all soup dumplings cravings. Until next year Ding Tai Fung/Xiao Long Bao."}
{"text":"For those of you wondering if this is the famous Taiwanese chain that's in LA/Seattle, it's NOT.  In fact, it's a far cry, especially service-wise!!!

1.  It's OVERPRICED.  $1 per dumpling?  Main dishes are higher than most Chinese places by at least $2-4 which adds up IF you go with people who do not know how to order.  $13.50 for greasy fried rice?  I wouldn't order this.  

Overall, there were a coupla entrées I wouldn't personally order, but LUNCH for 4 people was just under $75, before tips...which I think is ridiculous.

The Taiwanese chain is affordable or at least SEEMS worth it 'cause the service is more refined.

2.  Food was mediocre and at times, greasy, re:  Fried Rice and Green Onion Pancakes.  There was a pool of oil at the bottom of the rice, see:  pictures.  Green Onion Pancakes had this weird coconut taste as if they used coconut oil for the layers.  The taste was off.  

I guess I don't really like Xio Long Baos 'cause they were just awhight in my books.  Nothing to rave about.  AND you hafta eat them right away or the wrapping gets really hard.  Near the end of our meal, we had to rock-paper-scissors to see which \"loser\" would eat the last remaining 2!

Warning:  Whatever you order, DO NOT try the Soufflé Balls with Black/Red Bean.  The taste of the \"soufflé\" was unexpected, savoury, greasy (it was fried!), and sorta mushy.  It's difficult to explain, but it was pretty damn close to being inedible.  It was not light 'n airy as the term soufflé suggests.

3.  Service was rude.  We had 1 menu for 4 people.  Had to ask for another one.  And as the dishes rolled out, they weren't placed on the table, they were just pushed on, and sometimes in awkward places, e.g. in between people!!!  Good servers would actually make a space for the dish, not push it on.

I don't mind unrefined service as much IF the prices matched.  However, if you're gonna charge those kinda prices, you'd better make sure that it's top notch!  

If you've been to the original DTF, the service is kind, refined, and very polite.  It is not pushy, rude.  The food is clean and tasty, NOT greasy, a mishmash of Shanghai et al., and overpriced.  Never again."}
{"text":"This is my favourite place for dumplings. I no longer live in the area, but when I visit my parents this is where we go to get lunch.

My favourites are the sticky rice Shu Mai, the soup dumplings, shanghai style porn buns, and green onion roll with stewed need. I also really enjoy the braised beef noodle soup. 

If you are in the area and are in the mood for dumplings, there is no other place to go."}
{"text":"One of the best spots for xiaolongbao! I visit Ding Tai Fung at least once a month, and each time I'm blown away by how flavourful and tasty the xiaolongbao are. I order them quite frequently when I go out for dim sum at various restaurants, but Ding Tai Fung definitely makes the best I've had. My other favourites are the beef noodle soup and beef pancake wraps.

It can be a bit pricey (I think it runs $6.99 for 6 original xiaolongbao), but I think it's worth it as a treat once in a while. Will definitely continue to visit, and am looking forward to more delicious food each time!"}
{"text":"This place is above average comparing to most restaurants in the area. Great customer service, fresh ingredients, inexpensive, and plenty of flavors without the feeling of sodium and grease overload. 

The soup dumplings was not the best. But it satisfies any craving. Don't bother with the more expensive crab soup dumplings. Stick with the basics. The original pork soup dumplings actually taste better. As a fellow New York, I must take a second to give a shout out to Nan Xiang Dumpling House in Flushing, NY on Prince Street. It is by far the best soup dumplings on the east coast."}
{"text":"Many people have compared the xiao long bao (???) from Ding Tai Fung and Gou Bu Li located near Time Square. As a Shanghainese, I have to say that Gou Bu Li makes a much more authentic xiao long bao than here. The xiao long bao here is simply not juicy enough, and not meaty enough, whether it's the crab one (??) or pork. The price is also high - $10 for 6. I can easily eat 15 of these in 1 meal. 

The pan fried baos are decent. It still retains the juiciness, while having that slight crisp at the bottom. 

The veggies here are extremely overpriced. I love the way Chinese people make veggies, but veggies here at Ding Tai Fung is really not worth it.

I have dined in and ordered take out. You can call ahead or order there, wait is always 20 minutes."}
{"text":"My mother is a big fan, so the restaurant must be good. She is Taiwanese, and a very picky eater when it comes to authentic restaurants. It is currently her favourite dim sum restaurant.

The dim sum is different  than that I had grown up on. However, the food and service is good. My favourite is the soup dumplings. The meat is tender (and not mealy),the soup is flavourful, and the food is hot and fresh."}
{"text":"Been here many times. Best soup dumplings in toronto. Green onion pancakes are good as well. Though overall its a bit pricier than other chinese restaurants, it is well worth the premium."}
{"text":"A friend recommended this place to us and swears that it's worth a try.  Indeed it was well worth the trip.  They have chefs knead the dough and press the dumplings fresh in front of us.  You're suppose to suck all the juice out of the dumplings before you eat them or else you'll burn your tongue.  The juice that came out of it was impeccable.  The meat was cooked to perfection, not over nor under.  The flour wasn't too heavy and definitely the best dumplings I've ever tried.  

We tried a few of their other dishes and it wasn't as good as their trademark dumplings.  But that alone was enough for me to want to come back.  Everyone that resides or is visiting TO should absolutely give this a try."}
{"text":"My recent trip to Hong Kong left me with a newfound adoration for xlb, so naturally I headed to DTF in Markham to satisfy my cravings after hearing about it.

This place is pretty busy when I came in but then again it was a  Saturday afternoon which was to be expected.

Main Dishes we ordered:

Shrimp fried rice - nothing special, but not bad either.

Spicy peanut noodles - The peanut flavour is overwhelming. Way too oily and way too heavy for me. I only finished half of it and even by then I was ready to take a nap. The noodles themselves were pretty good though - perfectly chewy but not undercooked.

Pork & dried scallop xlb - I liked them. The meat is tender and juicy and the soup is flavourful. My only complaint is that the skin was kind of fragile so it was hard to pick up the dumpling without piercing it.

Pork xlb - They tasted good, but again they're kind of hard to pick up with chopsticks without breaking the skin.

Verdict: It's not as good as what you'll get in HK but dumplings are pretty solid nonetheless."}
{"text":"Din Tai Fung or Ding Tai Fing?!? Okay, this place is fake, but he food is still good. I still love their xiao lung bao even if it's not part of the real restaurant chain."}
{"text":"Shanghai Style Cuisine. 

We ordered: 
Xiao Long Bao: light and full of juice. Fantastic
Pan Fried dumplings: Skin to meat ratio was perfect
Snow Pea Shoots: Just the right amount of garlic
RIce cakes with pork and cabbage: Just what I needed. 
Hot Milk Tea: Wish it came in a larger mug. 

If you're going at peak times, expect a wait. We came about an hour or two before closing and we waited about 10-15 minutes. Took the time to look over the menu and pencil in our order. 

I've been coming here with my family whenever we visit Toronto. 

Really wish they had one of these in Montreal."}
{"text":"Been here twice.  Wish I can come more often because their soup dumplings are AAAAA+++++!   The meat inside is delish...and the soup inside the dumplings are YUMMY.  Most important, the actual dumpling is excellent because it is fresh and had that al-dente type of chew to it.   I would only go here for the soup dumplings, though

As for the spicy wontons, those are like their most famous dish. I had it once but I cannot eat too spicy anymore so I am going to skip that in the future.   

Meanwhile, the customer service is great and there is a huge line during peak hours.  I came here prior to open time and there was a line outside waiting to get in! haha!  So I suggest to find the off-peak times to check this joint out.  The bathrooms are also clean, too!"}
{"text":"Since it has been at least 2 years since I was in the area, I decided to stop by DTF due to all the raving reviews from Yelp...

Upon arrival, the restaurant was merely half-full, to my surprise. 

The food was good, but nothing spectacular. Some of the dishes we ordered included the beef noodle soup, Shanghai Noodles, Crab Meat XLB, Green Onion Pancake, as well as the spicy marinated beef stomach.

Remarkably, the service was actually decent. The washrooms were also clean and modern!

Food: 3.25 stars
Service: 4 stars
Ambiance: 4 stars"}
{"text":"DTF really has the best best steamed pork soup dumplings/ siu lung bao. It's so juicy & filled with meat and soup ! Be careful not to puncture it with your chopstick :)

Love a lot of the dishes here... there are just too many to name! 

I have always had a positive experience here. Everytime someone visits this is one of the restaurants we take them to. Our waitress was Veon. She's always kind, polite & throws in freebies (dessert) for us! Not sure what the latest dessert was called but it was sweet black sesame wrapped in dumpling wrapper. SOOOO GOOD :)

I think it's safe to say DTF is the best Shanghai restaurant in Toronto.

Come early for dinner as it does get quite packed especially on weekends! Or make reservations. If you request the private room there's a minimum charge of $120."}
{"text":"The last leg of our trip and of course, we end it off at Ding Tai Fung for their soup dumplings again. I love their decor here. Very modern. Dark wood. Lots of bright lights. Kinda chic I must say. 

They open at 10:30am and we were the 2nd group to sit down. I swear, 15-20 mins later, the restaurant was 3/4 full. If you want to eat, be prepared to wait or come early. 

Some dishes I forgot to mention from my first review: 

1) Pig intestines in spicy sauce - this dish comes out in a small metal saucer with a flame underneath heating up the dish. Plenty of pig intestines and the spicy sauce/broth/stew (??) goes great with a bowl of rice. Ordered this twice. 

2) Fried pig intestines - yum-o. MUST GET!! but I can understand if people don't like the texture. It's crispy on the outside and fatty on the inside. Served with a side of salt and pepper mixture (that's not that salty at all). Really good.

3) Soup dumplings are a MUST!!! 

My three favorites are still the soup dumplings, boy choy with garlic and the fried bread with condense milk. We ordered a few to go on our road trip back to nyc. ;D they even sell frozen ones too!!!"}
{"text":"Out for a late night snacks and xiao long bao were on our list to try.  With all the reviews and pictures for this place we had high expectations but it's was not that great.  Short wait for a table for two, table was too small for all our snacks.  The xiao long bao were not that great, the shrimp and pork dumplings were better.  The Spring onion pancakes were okay, it should be thin and flaky."}
{"text":"Ordered a few dumpling dishes and a seafood soup for the table.  Dumplings were good as per usual.  Seafood soup was huge in portion but was nothing special.  Though it's nice to go to a place where the flavor is relatively light.  Far too often going out means consuming too much salt or things deep fried.  The seating was also nice because there was enough distance between the tables.  More often than not most Chinese restaurants try to cram as many seats as they can inside.  The space was a nice surprise."}
{"text":"If you're looking for dumplings, this is a great place to go! It's usually busy, during peak times. Parking is sometimes insane.

Service is quick. It's nice to see the dumplings being made through the glass window. We love their soup dumplings! We usually order the steamed shrimp & pork siu mai, but the best seller here would be the steamed soup dumplings w/ pork filling (Xiao Long Bao). It's absolutely delicious.

The spicy and sour soup is OK (it could be a little spicier). The deep fried Chinese donut sticks are way too oily, but still great with a congee."}
{"text":"I have been on the hunt for xiao long bao and this is one of the top rated spots. We decided to try it out on Thursday for lunch. The dumplings are freshly made, you can even watch from your seat! 

We ordered four dishes all together - they were HUGE! We ordered a dozen of the mini soup dumplings and made the mistake of ordering alot of pork dumplings. There were alot of things that were missing on the dim sum menu that I can get at other restaurants but still coming here was worth it. Definitely did not finish but brought them home. They were extremely filling, very flavourful. Pricey for dim sum though, so not an every day type of thing but occasionally =)"}
{"text":"Do NOT mistaken this restaurant for Din Tai Fung, the international chain based in Taiwan. I would have given two stars but the obvious play on the name is very disturbing to me as I'm sure it would be to DTF.

The restaurant is fairly large and well lit. The first thing you don't notice as you approach the restaurant is the lack of a line stretching out the door. The second thing you won't see as you enter is the demonstration kitchen where at least a half-dozen employees are busy rolling, filling and folding dumplings. There are large windows and a demonstration area at the back of the restaurant but there was no real activity going on there.

The menu is in English and Chinese while the ordering sheet is in Chinese only. The items do correspond by number so ordering is still fairly straight forward and simple.

I'm not going to break down everything we ordered and ate but suffice it to say that the flavors were weak and the temperatures too cool for my preference. The XLB come six to an order instead of ten and didn't hold the temperature as expected. The soup was sparse and bland. The vinegar on the table was red instead of black.

The best part was that I didn't pay. My brother did!"}
{"text":"In the multicultural landscape of the GTA, it wasn't surprising that a french themed party would be followed by a Chinese themed after party! Teacher Jen K, gave us a rope which we dutifully followed, much like day care toddlers, to Ding Tai Fung (DTF). Boy was the after party one big mouthgasm!

Thanks to our supreme leaders and knowers of all good dishes at DTF, Jen K and Wayne C, we ordered a bunch of tasty morsels: soup dumplings, steamed buns, chinese broccoli,spicy porky belly, shanghai noodles, kung pao shrimp,drunken chicken and dessert! I know it sounds like a lot, and it was quite a lot, but there's nothing like getting a bunch of foodies together who've just had their appetites whetted with light and airy snacks (aka sugary and buttery cookies, cupcakes and alcohol)!

The soup dumplings were amazeballs: gotta snip one corner of the dreamboat, suck the juice out and then munch on the delicious meat. It's quite a task doing all this with a pair of chopsticks. Medical schools should include this in training programs for surgeons; it'll enhance the dexterity of their fingers!

The pork and chive dumplings were standout and the pork belly was very succulent and flavorful. The Chinese broccoli was deliciously garlicky. Unfortunately, the shrimp wasn't as spicy as I thought it'd be given that it had red chillies. I forget what the drunken chicken was drunk in, but it was an Asian version of a cold cut. The bun desserts with condensed milk were a nice palette cleanser.

I was so engrossed in eating my way through the food we had ordered, and too busy trashing Tiesto to pay much attention to the spartan surroundings or the service. I did notice that the place was pretty full when we got there quite late on a Sunday evening. I am not surprised and agree, that DTF is totally worth the trip uptown.

p.s. I felt bad for Jen K and Wayne C because they didn't seem to be eating much, they were too busy ordering for us and ensuring that our plates were never empty. Thanks you two for an awesome time!

p.p.s. The dumplings and buns at DTF totally put those at CPFD (Crown Princess Fine Dining) to shame."}
{"text":"Love their ??? (soup dumplings) and their ???!  I forget the name but I also really like the dish where it comes with the fresh lettuce wrap and delicious shrimp meat filling  very nice and clean place, decorations are nice. I have to mention that I did get food poisoning one time after eating their pork dumplings....  I still like coming to this restaurant though!"}
{"text":"So they have nothing to do with their sister location in Southern California, but still have the same magical xiao long bao -- my meal of choice if I'm ever on death row -- and really good scallion pancake (better than 369 Shanghai Dim Sum's nearby, though that restaurant is also fantastic).  How does Markham have TWO of the best Shanghainese restaurants in North America?  Nothing I've had in San Francisco comes close."}
{"text":"Ding Tai Fung needs little introduction, I think everyone is familiar or have heard of their super awesome soup dumplings.

It's been a few years since I have dined at the First Markham location, but I have visited other locations of this chain in other countries. Upon coming back here, I am pleased to say that the quality of this DTF remains quite good.

The prices for the quality of food here is reasonable, and the soup dumplings are still pretty tasty. 

Service is fast, and that is great because this place is quite packed.

Overall, I would highly recommend DTF. 4 stars!"}
{"text":"It ok, but nothing special.

waited 30-40 minutes in line during lunch time.  tried the xio lung bao everyone is talking about, pretty good, but that was about it.  We ordered shanghai noodle and fried rice over 10 bucks each, and portion size was small and kind of tasteless. Tried a few types of the bao's but outside the main one where the soup came out there wasn't anything special.

Kinda pricey for the tasteless food.  But its a one time experience, so i don't really mind.  First time eating shanghai style dim sum, they don't have the traditional haw gow and siu mai, but a special kind instead.  

I think money would be better spent somewhere else.  Was expecting a lot more."}
{"text":"This is my favourite restaurant hands down. i dated a Shanhainess guy in university. We went to china for 2 weeks and this tastes very much like what I recall having in china. I unfortunately now live about 1.5 hours away in hamilton. we still go occasionally but i miss it so. love the mini steam pork buns. pan fried Shanhai pork buns and the braised meatball in nappa. so many good dishes."}
{"text":"I seriously cannot stop eating dumplings. Yes..I think we all go through phases of food. Maybe burgers..maybe ayce sushi...maybe pizza..but no matter what phase, I always love dumplings!!!

Now, I am not a professional judge of xiao long bao, but if I were to guess, I would say Ding Tai Fung does these very well. They are hot as hell at first because of the soup inside, so please, if you havent had them DONT JUST STICK THEM IN YOUR MOUTH. I was a noob, and this is what I did lol. Wait for it to cool a bit, then eat it. 

Once it cools and you eat it, you will find that the soup inside is just heartwarming, body warming, and still slightly hot..It is rich and a little bit fatty and has a strong sesame oil flavour which I really enjoyed. 

Aside from the ever popular xiao long bao, there are many many other options. If you like noodle soup like I do (my current phase!!), they make a GREAT noodle soup. The braised beef noodle soup is pictured below (#49 Or #47, cant remember). It is a tasty concoction of hand pulled noodles with loads of tender braised beef. At under 10 bucks, its another great bargain

Everytime I visit Ding Tai Fung, I leave full to the brim. With so many appealing options on the menu, you really can't help but to try (too many things)."}
{"text":"We were planning to have dim sum at Golden Palace at First Markham Place but getting there at 10am was not early enough to get a table on the day of Chinese New Year.  They said the wait was going to be a hour so we decided to go Ding Tai Fung instead which is in the same plaza  which serves Shanghai dim sum which is very different from Cantonese dim sum.   We were so hungry so it was just nice to get a table right away.  We have been here a few times for dinner but first time for brunch.  Shanghai dim sum is more a lunch/dinner than a brunch so the restaurant was pretty empty when we got there and the place did not get full until 11:30am.

The selection of dim sum is mainly steam dumplings.  They have fried dumplings as well but I recall that it wasn't too tasty.  If you have never had Shanghai dim sum, I would recommend you try the steamed soup dumplings with pork fillings (Xiao Long Bao).   Make sure you try it with a bit of the shredded ginger and vinegar sauce.  As usual, this dish was pretty good.  We also really liked the steamed chives and pork dumplings.  We also got the pickled cabbage and pork soup noodle which was okay but nothing too special.  Everything was for sharing and finished off with the stewed pork and preserved vegetable rice with soya egg which my daughter really liked.  The pork is fatty which makes it really tasty but it's definitely not a healthy dish.

Overall, I'm not a big fan of Shanghai dim sum but once in awhile it's a nice change."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to go to this place ever since I remembered it existed about a month or so before I went here.

Known for having some of the best dumplings ever (I think), this place lives up to that pretty well.  Not that I'm a dumpling expert by any means, but I have had dumplings from various places, including at least a couple restaurants in Beijing.  I've had them home-made by my parents and store-bought from some American supermarket.

The food is great.  I got beef tendon, two different kinds of dumplings, and I think some vegetables.  I think I had the taro/daikon cake things too.  The dumplings are just filled with a delectable and flavorful juiciness that I've not had in other places.

It can be pricey, but it actually isn't nearly as expensive as I thought it would be.  You CAN order food for yourself and probably still come out under $10, though I'm not sure how much food that would be.  But what I liked is that there are several items that are in the $3-4 range, and you can pick and choose what you want based on preference and price.

I like the service of this restaurant, which seems to be the style of service throughout Markham (the new Chinatown of Toronto) - you are given a slip of paper and a menu, and you mark down which items you want to order.  It's simple, and it's in English, so if you aren't too great of a Chinese speaker, there's no worry.

Overall, great food, prices that are better than I expected, and good method of ordering.  But of course, I enjoy most of the food I eat, and I'm not really a harsh critic, either because I'm unrefined or unpretentious.  You decide."}
{"text":"This is the worst place ever!!!! It looks like they don't need customer anymore. We arrived at this location at 10pm(door said opens 'till 11), and the door already locked. After few minutes we followed the lady who already had a table inside. We came in and they let us waited for awhile. Finally someone told us their kitchen closed already. My friend was extremely upset because we wasted our time for nothing!"}
{"text":"Giving this place 3.9 stars (not quite 4 stars) Ambience/decor here are average, service is o.k, but not outstanding, and the food here is good and freshly made. Great place for a group meal as this a dim sum joint and the tables here are perfect for that. It is a very busy place, so be prepared to wait once you get here."}
{"text":"OMG dumplings are bite size and sooooo good. The flat tofu with vegetables was lick the plate good. Try it."}
{"text":"Leave it to Madame Jennifer K  Yelp food connoisseur extrordinaire to search out a good place for after Elite event eats and Ding Tai Fung did not dissappoint.

I have not had dumplings since Mother's day 2008! at Mother's dumplings of all places and it was due time I got my Shanghainese pierogies on, but my being anti-pork makes dumpling eating tricky :(    Thanks to Jen K & Wayne C's  Chinese food savvy, they hooked me up with some fine veggie dumplings (deeelicioussss!!) and \"Drunken\" chicken to boot!!!

DTF (giggle) is a bright clean resto, where you can actually watch the chefs roll out the yummy dumplings in the glass enclosed back area, truthfully chefs looked a little miffed to be at the voyeuristic mercy of five year-old Chinese kids tapping at the glass. I'd be chucking dumplings at the kid's faces, but I digress......

Good to know they also serve those awesome egg white donuts and the Knotted bread (steamed or fried) was AMAZING!!!

There was lots of sucking of soup and no lack of double entendres as Abbas rolled with the innuendoes faster than Louis CK could say the \"C\" word!!!  

Gotta love eating dumplings with Yelpers ;P !!!"}
{"text":"Simply the best Shanghai style dumplings in the city.  Great service, bright and clean, decent decor."}
{"text":"I have been to the one in Taiwan, Hong Kong and this is my third time in this Ding Tai Fung in Toronto.  The quality is getting worst and worst.  Maybe the chefs are not the same anymore, I would rather go somewhere else for the price I paid.  The Siu Lung Bao is way too small and there are no juice inside, disappointed =("}
{"text":"This is a classic in Markham. A place I frequent whenever I go home. This is not the real Din Tai Fung from Taiwan but has similar food.

Din Tai Fung (original) is known for the xiaolongbao (soup dumplings) and this place has it as well. They also do the open kitchen so you can see them make it. The ones here aren't bad but they aren't mind blowing either. The soup is a bit bland, meat could be a bit more flavorful/fatty. I get it whenever I go but keep expectations normal.

I like to get the noodles here as well. Beef noodle or the pork cutlet. I went with my parents this time and we got both. I think the noodles themselves are good. Freshly made, doughy, springy. Broth is not bad - could be more flavorful but passable. For the beef though, it could have been braised a lot longer, it was  still a bit tough. The pork cutlet isn't crispy and was a bit sour. 

The service is actually decent though. We just mentioned lightly that the pork was sour and they took it off our menu. I usually don't see Chinese places do this so was quite surprised. 

I'll keep going back to this place more because I've been going for many years, not a lot of substitutes, and the food is acceptable."}
{"text":"I traffic in acronyms and initialisms for a living. If there's a way to reduce a concept, a project or a division into a few capital letters, I'll find it. Sometimes this yields pure nonsense. Other times, it's loads of fun. With the advent of the Jersey Shore,  Ding Tai Fung shifts from Column A to Column B. 

Apart from the joy of asking if you're DTF for lunch, DTF stands for delicious shanghai-style Dim Sum. Fried calamari tentacles are barely coated in corn starch, and served blazing hot. On their own, they'd make a perfect bar food. Pan fried pork dumplings are Proustian in recalling childhood memories of crispy dough surrounding a savory filling. Soup dumplings explode with umami goodness. I usually wait a few minutes before tucking in. Fresh out of the steamer, they're scalding hot and prone to burst in transit. An assorted meat pancake finds sweet bbq pork and plenty of scallions suspended in a heavy crepe matrix. This dish benefits most from a dunk in red vinegar or hot sauce. A large pan-fried beef dumpling (which I've heard Ming Tsai call a 'bing') should be sold immediately outside my apartment, as a quick lunch option. I'd become a shut-in. 

Hot and sour soup gets a mixed response. Some find it too sour, while I focus on the bracing heat and volume of tofu and veg that comes with each spoonful. Wonton noodle soup is generously portioned; the wontons are more chive than pork and the stock could be stronger, but it's still tasty.  

Family-style dinner options are available as well, but they're a mixed bag. Portions are huge, and seafood/pork options are particularly successful. 

If Joanne Kates were to take her usual food-as-sex comparisons to their logical conclusion, she might point out how all DTF dumplings tend to erupt and squirt lustfully all over one's clothing. You may need to change your pants after eating here."}
{"text":"Ding Tai Fung has been around for a LONG time now. But unlike other older businesses, they have been able to maintain a large customer base all these years, and there is a reason for that. They have THE best xiao long bao you can get in the GTA.

I am obsessed with xiao long bao and so whenever I go to restaurants that specialize/serve these yummy warm dumpling soups I always order them and compare it to Ding Tai Fung. But truly, nothing comes close to the thin dough skin, the smooth tender meat, and the flavourful soup of their XLBs and I can't stop going back for more! 

The other dishes at this restaurant are fair and satisfying (pan fried dumpling, onion pancake, fried man tao, sticky rice, etc) although I cannot put these other dishes in as high of a pedestal when compared to other restaurants. Nonetheless, I have enjoyed every dish every single time I've been here. 

Next time you come here, try out their salty soy milk. It's warm soy milk with shredded pork, green onions, and Chinese doughnut (yau cha guai). Sounds weird I know (I thought so too), but it's an interesting sweet and savoury \"soy milk soup\" for those who are more adventurous. You won't regret it! And of course, don't forget the xiao long bao."}
{"text":"Look, if you like freshly made dumplings, you HAVE TO try this place. It serves THE BEST dumplings in the GTA. Period. There's a reason there's a lineup on weekends. Ding Tai Fung never disappoints. Their dumplings are the best. Full of broth inside. I'm salivating already, writing this review. Just go check 'em out already."}
{"text":"Not the best pork soup dumplings, I've had better... 

The pan fried pork dumplings hardly had any meat inside, and had a lot of some liquid dripping out of it.... 
My bf ordered us a few other dishes (idk what) on the menu which were pretty pricey $$$.

Decor is nice, and pretty spacious, service was alright. 

I don't think I'll be back, wasn't really impressed with much, and was expensive."}
{"text":"You know an 'ethnic' (for lack of better words**) restaurant is good when you peek in the windows and see that there are lots of people of the matching ethnicity enjoying the food.  Well that litmus test was broken on Monday at 2:30 p.m. because the place was EMPTY - fortunately I looked it up on my yelp app and saw that it got glowing reviews from my fellow yellows.  I was also relieved to see on yelp that they are kid friendly and accept credit cards.

The six pork and chive dumplings were bursting with fresh greens and flavourful soup.  I can speak Mandarin but am a poor reader so I had to order off the the english menu.  I was at first surprised to see that the dumplings weren't the round-shaped bao's but the oblong jiao ze shape - which makes them a messy two-bites.  But I was pleasantly surprised when the waitress announced that they were 'jio tsai bao', in other words *chinese* chives which is about as chinese a veg as you can get.  It has a distinct flavour that may be an acquired taste for western palates.  The wrapper was so thin and the folds so neat - like most chinese kids I was put to work at family dumpling parties and could usually spot my dumpy dumplings even after they were cooked - it is a real art to make beautiful dumplings by hand.

The green onion pancake could have been better layered and flakier but now I'm just nitpicking.  The yao tiao and do jang (deep fried donut and warm sweet soybean drink) brought me back to Taiwan mornings.

Yes, I ordered all that food for me and my daughter who still gets most of her nutrients out of a bottle.  And yes, I was very full and very happy after that meal.

p.s.  excuse the bad pin yin, pure phonetic, but you know what I mean.

{"text":"Tony F took me to Ding Tai Fung before our big trip to Walmart to try on DD bras and look for red one-piece bathing suits.

They gots some delicious dumplings here! My favourite was the wontons served in a spicy oily sauce. We used to the remaining sauce on all the rest of our dumplings, yum!

We also tried one of the soup dumplings, green onion pancake and a some different kind of shui mai that had rice packed on top.

The soup dumplings and green onion pancake were both really good. The rice shui mai was very bland though, wouldn't recommend ordering that. Meh.

The service was okay, but I was really quite offended that the server asked if I wanted a fork. Listen lady, I am an egg! Give me some credit, please.

Overall absolutely delicious food, but the atmosphere is kind of lacking. High ceilings and large sterile looking decor which resulted in a kind of cafeteria-like dining experience. 

Wasn't the cheapest dim sum I've eaten, but the price is fair given the quality of the food. Would go back often if it was downtown ;)"}
{"text":"Great place for fresh soup dumplings! A little small in size but the wrapping doesn't break as you manipulate them. The chefs can be seen making them by hand. Pan fried dumplings are okay. We tried a new dish, the pork stew with pickled verge tables and it was great, coupled with plain white rice. Shanghai noodles with pork hardly have any pork in it. Service is good once we sat down. The line up and wait was discouraging and we almost left. Apparently they took reservations but most people just took a number. The seating process seemed inefficient. People piled up by the door while there were large tables only occupied by 2-3 people sitting. I asked about shared tables and was told not done. They should really have communal long tables and it would be better.  I would make reservations next time. 

The menu is in English but the order form is in Chinese only so you have to transfer the order by using item numbers. I would suggest restaurant to make an English version of the order form. 

We would return again but I hope to have more options elsewhere."}
{"text":"3.5
Ok but is not worth the trip... No original or fabulous dim sum. A disappointingly short menu item list for dim sum."}
{"text":"I've been here before and I loved it the first time. It must have been a random weekday with a much less crowd and with my older family. This time it was just me and my SO. Busy Saturday early evening. Got our numbers and waited patiently in line. Another couple in their mid-50s came after us and tried to cut us. We all waited. The couple after us went to the back of the restaurant and somehow got seated before us! And we were up next and they couldn't wait! I understand some people might have connections but she was so shady about it! Ugh. Older people! Sorry had to rant about that.

But the food...
Got the xiao long bao, ground pork with string beans, pork with chive pockets, and a bowl of rice. The xiao long bao was as usual good and juicy. I usually don't like eating the meat of dumplings because it has a distinct taste to it but I like the meat in these xiao long baos. The string beans had some peppers in them giving it a nice heat but I wish there was more pork in the dish. The pork chive pockets were good. Texture was good. 

If I came back, it would be during non-prime time to avoid people cutting in line."}
{"text":"of course had to order the xiao long bao when i came here. it was not bad. i enjoyed it. 

other things we ordered were:
green onion pancake
pan fried pork buns
pan fried pork/chive pops
rice roll with shredded pork and dough fritter (friend ordered the wrong damn thing)

there were a few other things too but as i can't seem to remember what they were, it's safe to say they weren't terrible, nor were they good.
nothing really stood out to me. everything was pretty average. the xiao long bao tasted just like any other."}
{"text":"My aunt and I went to the Ding Tai Fun dim sum place in Taiwan and it was amazing. Since coming back from Toronto I had been craving this dim sum. When I found out there was a location in Markham I had to try it! We ordered the famous soup filled dumpling, the vegetables dumpling, friend pork dumpling, beef pancakes, the shredded floss pork with sticky rice wrapped around a donut fritter, hot and sour soup and Shanghai noodles. Shanghai dim sum is not your typical Chinese dim sum so you won't find your typical har gow and siu mai there. There were similar items which we did order. The meat inside the dumplings were mushy. I didn't really like it. Also it seems like all the dumpling had the exact same flavour. I really enjoyed the hot and sour soup. Service is your typical Chinese restaurant with the waitstaff looking like they're in a rush and not helping you.  All in all an ok experience and the food was also ok not mind blowing. I enjoyed my food in Taiwan better. Will probably not come back here."}
{"text":"Amazing!  I returned in March to DTF and loved practically everything that my friend and I had ordered.  The XLB's were the star of the show, and the Shenzehnbaos were excellent, as well.

I heard that this DTF is not officially connected to the real chain in Taiwan?  I'm not sure if that's true or not, but it tastes good enough to be real."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try the traditional Chinese \"Xiao Long Bao\" soup dumplings for the longest time now and a few people recommended that I go here. Overall their soup dumplings were amazing but keep in mind that I have nothing to compare them too since this was the first time I've ever had soup dumplings! Unfortunately, I would ONLY come here for the soup dumplings and nothing else, as their other food items that I tried were really disappointing.

Service and Environment:
It's a pretty big and huge restaurant situated in the First Markham Place plaza. We came at around 3 pm on a Saturday afternoon and got a seat immediately. Service was quick and servers were really friendly.

Food:
Steamed Soup Dumplings with Pork Filling
It was a pretty memorable experience to bite into those perfectly wrapped dumplings and have the flavourful pork soup burst into my mouth. The soup dumplings were sooo sooo sooo good. We had to order another six because we just couldn't get enough of them! You definitely need to try these soup dumplings  here!

Shanghai Style Noodles with Shrimp
Unfortunately the dish was really bland and not that flavourful. 

Chicken with Green Onion
Personally I think the chicken looked a bit discoloured and not fresh. It just didn't look that appetizing to eat. The chicken was also bland and really oily."}
{"text":"It's been tough to find a place with good soup dumplings and dtf has been my favourite to go back so far. There's a whisper that it is not an original dtf franchise but I still think they do a good job nonetheless!   This place is packed. Because first Markham place is always packed, parking is a little hard to find. Their hot and sour soup is OK... I liked their broccoli egg white scallop dish. More egg and scallop and less broccoli made it awesome."}
{"text":"Yummmmmmm!

Why I love it: Soup dumplings (I can eat way too many of these), peanut butter noodles, pork belly and beef pancake wrap. AND they take reservations. Amazing for a busy asian place located in FMP.

Typical service that you'd expect from an asian place, but place and utensils are pretty clean and food comes out quick and hot and super cheap.

Definitely one of my go-to's."}
{"text":"Awesome place for Shanghai Chinese cuisine with MUST HAVE soup dumplings! Ding Tai Fung is conveniently located at First Markham Place and not hard to find. My only problem with this restaurant is parking. This plaza is horrendous when it comes to finding parking during lunch or dinner times, I'm almost always finding myself waiting for someone to leave before getting a spot. Also, ensure you have a reservation beforehand as this place is VERY busy during peek hours. Once you are finally seated, the food more than makes up for the long wait times.

The soup dumplings are a must here. Although a little pricey for just 6 dumplings, the quality of the dumpling makings up for the quantity. Easily the best tasting dumplings I've ever had. Other dishes ordered include the pan fried dumplings (also very tasty, a lot bigger and harder to eat),braised beef noodle soup (not the best I've had but worth a try) and the wontons in spicy sauce (great flavor in the sauce, not too spicy nothing special about the wonton itself).

Ordering is made easy by filling out a sheet, mark down the quantity beside the item. Although the sheet is in Chinese, the menu is English/Chinese. The food is quite pricey but the service is fast, easy and the taste makes it worth while."}
{"text":"This restaurant is very busy during the weekends so I recomend to book reservation in advance. 

I ordered the xiao long bao, spicy wonton, beef tendon in chili sauce, and chicken with green onion. Xiao long bao is the best here. No word can describe it. It's the house special and a must-try dimsum dish. It's freshly made and steamed to perfection. I expected a lot for spicy wonton but it turned out okay. I still like it but I thought it will be something even better. It is still tasty tho. My second favorite dish is the beef tendon in chili sauce. It is a cold dish and I thought it will be hard to eat. But no it's super delicious. The texture and the sauce go well together. Lastly, the chicken with green onion was quite good. It was steamed well, that means, it is cooked right under the heat and time. I think this restaurant is specialized in steamed dishes because all steamed dishes I ordered turned out perfectly cooked. 

Service is okay. I couldn't really interact with the servers much since it was a busy night. 

Overall, I love the food here. They are good and authentic. The only con is that it's quite pricey for some dishes. But I am willing to come back occasionally, not as regular, to try other dimsum dishes."}
{"text":"Ding Tai Feng ??? is a registered name of famous Taiwanese restaurant, this fake one is nothing related to them, don't let the name fool you."}
{"text":"Met a couple friends here for lunch one day and it was really packed. Luckily we had a reservation but I felt the entire restaurant was super busy and turnaround seemed fast. The restaurant isn't that big and every bit of space was taken up. 

I had been to the Ding Tai Fung in Seattle and had an excellent experience and I was hoping this would be as good but it didn't quite meet the same standards.

The steamed soup dumplings were pretty good, definitely one of the better ones I have had. We had several different varieties all of which were consistently good, with lots of hot soup. 

We had fried rice cakes that were not very good, it was flavourless and too oily. We also ordered noodles and pot stickers which were both average. The cold dishes we ordered and the vegetable dish were all standard for any Chinese restaurant and did not stand out. Overall, food quality was decent but I definitely thought the Ding Tai Fung in Seattle was several times better. 

I would come back again for just the soup dumplings but everything else I would not order again. I also felt it was too busy, loud and rushed for my liking but maybe we just picked the absolute busiest time of the week to go. Bottom line: Come for the steamed soup dumplings, if you come for anything else you will be disappointed."}
{"text":"Whoohoo okay my review could be due to my lack of better options in Chicago, but I loved this knock-off Ding Tai Fung.  I don't care if it was a knock-off or not, but the food was delicious and tasted almost as good as the original.  We ordered bean curd, spicy wontons, Xiao long bao (crab meat x 2, original, and scallop), chive pockets, scallion pancakes, and siu mai.  The bean curd, Xiao long bao, chive pockets and siu mai are my favorites.  They were mouth-watering delicious!  I've read many yelp complaints about the Xiao long bao having too thin of skin, but that's how the skin is supposed to be at the original Din Tai Fung in Taiwan.  If you are good with chopsticks, it shouldn't be a problem.  None of my family members popped any of them.  The chive pockets are full of flavor and the bean curd was yummy.  The siu mai is not the typical siu mai you find in a dim sum restaurant.  It's ground pork topped with a shrimp.  This was pork filling is the best I've had and you can barely taste the gamey meat.  The spicy wontons were okay; nothing special.  The scallion pancakes were too thick and didn't have enough scallion flavor.  The wait was long for Saturday brunch (around 1 hour), but the service was decent and fast.  Prices are reasonable and definitely worth the trip if you are visiting Toronto."}
{"text":"The food is exceptional,  but you will never get a table here from Friday to Sunday.  The wait is almost always over 30 min for a table.  The price is decent, however, I find it a bit on the high side for Dim Sum type food. 

Be warned: It is an extremely noisy environment.  This is not somewhere you go if you want to have a conversation with a large group of people."}
{"text":"In my opinion, it's an average Shanghai place where families in Markham can enjoy. The siu long bao and the green onion pancake was one of the only things I really enjoyed there . 

Service was alright, or maybe its the fact I came to eat during their dinner time that I was barely served."}
{"text":"I'm a regular here. If I want fresh hand made juicy mini pork buns, this is the spot !!! Everything else on the menu are only mediocre, but the mini pork buns  itself added another star !"}
{"text":"3.5 Star

Ding Tai Fung has no relationship to Taiwan's Din Tai Fung. 

This used to be Xiao Long Bao https://www.yelp.ca/biz/xiao-long-bao-toronto which is really the sister restaurant of Ding Tai Fung  https://www.yelp.ca/biz/ding-tai-fung-markham-3 in Markham. Everything including menu and owner/staff but just a change of name.

I like this location better as it is more spacious and with plenty of parking. Food wise I found it comparable to their original location. Must order of course is Xiao Long Bao (soup dumplings).

A decent place for some Shanghainese dim sum in Scarborough. I have been coming here frequently since it opened and would continue coming for an enjoyable dining experience."}
{"text":"This place has the best steamed chives and pork dumplings!!
So yummy and the inside are fill with soup!! The wrappings are thin and light, not like the other dumplings place!

I really enjoy their beef noodle. The soup has so much favour and the noodle is just the perfect texture!

I have to say Ding Tai Fung is the best Shanghai restaurant in the area!"}
{"text":"Shanghai style restaurant. Xiao long bao is their signature dish and I would like to highly recommend their appitizer  like sweet toufu and bamblo shoots...."}
{"text":"I only come here for 1 thing, and 1 thing only: the soup buns. Those little buggers are so tasty. My mouth drolls of saliva and soup thinkin about it. Prices are fair, and the consistency is always good. I ate at the flagship in shanghai, and to be honest, the markham one beats it anyday. Freshness is superb."}
{"text":"I really really like this place. I actually just really really like their pork dumplings. It's so flipping good I'm gonna dream about them. They serve Shanghai northern styled food. They are known for their dumplings and they come in 6 for 6.50. If you want smaller bites you can even order the mini ones which is 12 for the same price. I'd get the normal batch of 6 though cause you can really taste the full flavour in the larger ones. 

Everything we ordered was so good and I was not disappointed at all!! Everything looked so appetizing on the menu but most of them are pretty carb heavy like any northern Chinese restaurants. One thing that threw me off was how expensive the vegetables were. I was dying for veggies but noticed one plate of any kind of veggie they offered (bean leaves, stocks etc) was $11+. The portions aren't extremely big or anything. 

We ordered spicy Shanghai dumplings and the sauces was really flavourful. Definitely recommend trying it. And they give you quite a bit of dumplings. 

For soup we had a chicken soup (6.50) which was pretty good and clean, it was so appetizing with the dumplings. The soup was full of flavour and tasted just like my moms homemade chicken soup :) 

last dish we had was the Egg white stirred with scallop and broccoli, kind of wish they had placed more broccoli but this dish was really really good. At first you'd think it lacks flavour but it was so smooth in texture and you could really taste the egg. I know a lot of places that make this dish and put extra dough/carb whatever into the egg which makes it taste worse.

I am coming back."}
{"text":"This is always one of our stops when we're in town. The Shanghai dumplings and shu mai are highly recommended. Careful when eating the steamed dumplings, the soup inside can be really hot. There is undoubtedly always a wait if you come an hour+ after they open. We usually go within 30 minutes and are seated immediately but there tends to be a line out the door when we leave. The service isn't the best but it's the typical Chinese restaurant service, you only get things when you ask for it (i.e. more water, tea, or the bill when ready). Give this place a try if you're feeling some fresh hot dumplings!"}
{"text":"There's a lot of hype surrounding DTF, and from what I tried it's worth every calorie ingested and kilometre travelled. We made the trek from Vaughan and I regret nothing.

Tip: make reservations, or go at 5. It was full by 5:30! 

We had the green onion pancakes, pork dumplings, spicy squid tentacles and the pork and shrimp Xiao long bao. The Xiao long bao is worth the hype! The wrapping was extremely thin with many folds, which is promising. As you bit the knot off, you were greeted by a warm, tempting aroma. The soup inside is flavourful without being overwhelmed with seasoning. Even the amount of meat inside was ideal. They also served it with side dishes of julienned ginger, to help cut through any fattiness inside. I thought it was a nice touch.

The other dumplings were good, too! They seemed a bit on the expensive side, but when you see their size you understand. Their wrapper was a bit thicker but still very good.  

I'd recommend all of these dishes to anyone who wanted to give the place a shot. Although two of us split these dishes, we left feeling full and satisfied. Even the tea was amazing! I took off one star because a) the service was a bit cold and b) it was a pain in the ass to get to, and they didn't even have har gow. But if these are my biggest complaints, they are clearly doing a lot of things right."}
{"text":"Was not impressed in my last visit, to start the seater was more interested in chatting with her coworkers than her actual role in seating people. 

Huge bottleneck at the entrance with many tables unreserved free \"in case a bigger party comes\". 

Food was a mix, pricing was ok but leaning more to overpriced. Some dishes met expectations, others I would definitely never again."}
{"text":"DTF is my favorite restaurant for dim sum. Not your typical dim sum restaurant as the cuisine is from the Shanghai region, which is a nice change from the usual and the reason I love going here all the time!

Their famous soup dumplings is a must have (be sure to dip it carefully in red vinegar and ginger and eat it in one bite, or else you will lose all the yummy soup inside).
I like the cold appetizer dish of jellyfish which is prepared with sesame oil, chili and a touch of rice vinegar. Other unusual dishes worth trying are the sliced boar's ear, and beef tendon in chili sauce.

The green onion pancake is great when dipped in soy sauce and chili oil sauce. The Shanghai noodles is simple, but so good.

I also suggest finishing off your meal with a dessert of black sesame  paste stuffed in sticky rice balls in a light sweet soup of rice wine, egg drop and chrysanthimum flower."}
{"text":"The Xiao Long Bao was savory and luscious! The piping hot broth burst in your mouth.  My clothes were stained from these awesome buns! The delicious broth ran down my chopsticks and onto my sleeves! It was worth every bite! My parents felt the buns here were better than the originial Din Tai Fung in Taiwan. 

Ding Tai Fung is probably the best restaurant for Shanghai buns in Toronto...unfortunately, other dishes are not up to par!"}
{"text":"I don't think this place is related to the ones in California but this place is way better.  There's actually fillings in the dumplings.  The noodles are chewy and a decent portion.  This place gets really busy."}
{"text":"This place really is hit and miss. The xiao long bao are great of course and so are the pan fried dumplings. The garlic bok choy was great as well but the portions are so small! On the other hand, the spicy beef soup was terrible and so was the dan dan noodles (it's just noodles and peanut sauce!). The green onion pan cake was decent but nothing special."}
{"text":"Are you DTF[1]? I wouldn't have made the gargantuan trek up the DVP to visit for a UYE if I wasn't. Ding Tai Fung is located at Woodbine and Hwy 7 and is tucked into a strip mall packed with Asian eats. When we walked in on Sunday morning it was packed to the gills, but fortunately Edwin A had planned ahead and snagged us a table in the VIP room. Edwin even setup an impromptu wireless hotspot so us yelp nerds could check in on the mobile app. Now that's baller.

As I learned from my table-mates, this place serves Shanghai style dim sum. I didn't find my typical har gow or CSB here. The selections skewed toward the more steamed side rather than fried, and there were a few things I had not seen before like soup dumplings and a fluffy egg white pastry dusted with icing sugar and filled with either red bean or black sesame paste. OMG, I love that black goo.

The selections were quite excellent. I really enjoyed the soup dumplings (once I learned the Skewer and Suck technique) and these rice rolls with sweet or salty fried tofu inside (they came wrapped in plastic) were OTH. I was also impressed with their Shanghai noodles. I could have slurped those down all day.

The service was PDQ and friendly compared to other dim sum places I have frequented in downtown Toronto. Normally when you order a drink, they don't mention it until you're walking out the door, or back for a third visit. At Ding Tai Fung, our dumplings and drinks came out in a flash!

I'd probably be back more if it were closer to home, but I'm happy to know that this place exists.

Obligatory Title Pun: At first you DING succeed, TAI, TAI a-FUNG.

Menu Readability: Jennifer \"mama bear\" K took care of the ordering. Thank you!

Need to mention: You can get iced and hot coffee or tea here. It was pretty bitter though, not sure it's to my taste.

What this place teaches me about myself: Sometimes my puns need to be read in a thick accent. I suggest Gungan for this one.

{"text":"You can't go wrong coming to ding tai fun to eat.  They got some yummy dumplings and they have this cold tofu dish that's so good it almost feels like you are eating meat.

They also have onion pancake which is delish!"}
{"text":"Our server, Bryan, was exemplary and is an asset to the organization. However, I regrettably have to report the food at this new location fails to meet the same standard set by the Arcadia location, which I have been to over 20 times.

1) Sesame Noodles: Noodles were over cooked and the sauce was under portioned resulting in a bland mess. 
2) Sautéed Kale w Garlic: Flavor was comparable to other locations but it was served undercooked, somewhere between raw and done correctly. 
3) Rice Cakes w Vegetables: Over seasoned, sodium bomb. It was prepared with too much oil resulting slimy, grease mound 5 mins after the dish hit our table.
4) Sautéed Green Beans: Well sautéed and flash fried. But another sodium bomb. 

Hope management goes into the kitchen to perform some quality control to preserve the Din Tai Fung reputation."}
{"text":"WHAT TO TRY!?

Ding tai Fung is known for their dumplings really! So if you come here and don't have dumplings, you're missing out on what makes ding tai Fung so famous in Asia. 

Unfortunately, this location is not as good as the other location in first markham place. The pork inside the siao lung bao was rather overcooked and not smooth texture. The soup tasted alright and the dumpling wrap didn't taste thin and chewy like I thought ding tai Fung is good at making. 

I tried the other dumpling called shrimp dumpling. It's essentially using the same pork mixture and adding a shrimp into the dumpling. It was alright. 

The noodles tasted great. Had the noodle in peanut sauce and red braised beef noodle. The braised beef noodle soup had some bok choy in it which is nice. 

LAST TIP?!

Remember to come try their pork dumplings and not fried rice or noodle. Try something they are known for! The display of how they steam their dumplings are way in the back so if you have a big enough company, ask to sit near the window that shows the action in the kitchen!"}
{"text":"Best Shanghainese food in the area. Their dumplings are excellent and you can see the chefs make them. Juicy with tons of flavour with a savoury outer wrap. 

Quite busy on weekends so make a reservation before going."}
{"text":"Food was good and on par with a good shanghai restaurant but nothing compared to LA's Ding Tai Fung.  I was really hoping to get the same elasticity of the dumpling wrapper here.  That must only be replicated/started in the actual Ding Tai Fung in Taiwan.  Nevertheless, I still enjoyed watching them make the dumplings. :)"}
{"text":"We have been here a number of times but just realize that I haven't written a review for this place.
They have delicious shanghai dumplings; my most favorite is their famous \"xiao long bao\" dumplings (pork dumpling with soup inside). The wrappers are super thin and the dumplings are full of flavour. You have to be very careful when first biting into it as its boiling hot with the soup inside; it may burn your tongue or squirt in your date's face (oops!! Sorry let me wipe that off your face lol).

I like how you can see the chefs making your fresh food through the glass window. I only liked the dumplings here, didn't care too much for their other items.

Cons: higher prices compared with other dumpling places; very crowded on weekend; sometimes have to wait a long time to get a table (I'm very impatient when I'm hungry)."}
{"text":"Don't order mini xiao long bao. It's a rip soo tiny. Everything is overpriced here.

taste is not bad though... (its only saving grace)"}
{"text":"I'm from Chicago and travel to markham/toronton once a year. Ding Tai Fung is always on my  list of restaurant to eat. I'm so glad they finally have the menu in English, but the ordering form is all Chinese. The waitress was very nice and helped translate. Highly rcmd potstickers, juicy Shaghai dumpling (in pork, crabmeat, mini), soy milk, red bean paste cake, and green onion pancakes. Can't wait until next year."}
{"text":"Great Shanghai style dumplings and noodles. This isn't the famous din tai gung from China but it is damn close in terms of menu and quality. Incredible soup dumplings, steamed buns, noodles and soup. Crazy busy on the weekend but worth the drive and wait."}
{"text":"Recently, I enjoyed another family meal at Ding Tai Fung, one of my favourite Shanghai restaurants. This time, I ventured out of my usual dim sum-heavy comfort zone to try some other dishes. 

Potstickers with pork: I felt that this execution missed the mark because the bottom of the dumpling was only very lightly pan-fried and didn't have that crunchy texture that I was looking for. I supposed it's slightly healthier this way.

Rice cake with shredded pork and pickled vegetables in soup was another healthier choice. The flavours were bright and clean, albeit slightly salty. 

Sliced pork with chili sauce was something that I haven't had for a long time. I was pleasantly reminded of my grandmother's cooking, because I don't think I've eaten this since she passed away. The fattiness of the pork was awesome.

The Surimi with Broccoli was also very enjoyable. The runny yolk added an extra dimension of creaminess. However, I was disappointed with the amount of broccoli that was given. I was craving for more veggies.

We ended the meal with steamed red bean dumplings. I personally prefer the sesame version of this dessert. 

The food here is yummy and generally well-executed. I can also count on Ding Tai Fung for a satisfying meal!"}
{"text":"There are only 2 places I know in Canada where I can get Xiao long Bao's just as good as china and this is one of them, the other one is in the same mall. A must stop for me every time I am in Toronto.  
Pretty much everything I try there is up to china standards. Living in Montreal I really miss this food and nothing comes close that I know off!!!
Service is pretty good, they know me by now even though I am from outta town.
Only thing I don't like is the parking lot!!! Like WTF how busy can a place be!!!!

I Highly recommend this place if you know what a real XLB is all about. I know it's pricey but I would pay double that if there was a place like this in Montreal!!!"}
{"text":"I heard about this place from a friend and they recommended their XLB. Being a student in Buffalo, it can be a struggle to satisfy my Asian food cravings. After 15 weeks of lectures and exams, a few of us decided to plan a trip (2 hours+) to try this place. We ordered their soup dumplings and it just didn't live up to the hype. The wrapper had great consistency. It was not too thick and it was just thin enough to hold the contents. The core however, was flavorless. It tasted too watery. Solid 2 stars- I've experienced better.

Their service was good, I have no complaints.
But it was not worth crossing the border and driving 2+ hours."}
{"text":"I've been to two branches of Ding Tai Fung in Shanghai and their steamed soup dumplings eclipsed everything I've had before and since in NYC.  I thought this another branch but seems it has nothing to do with the Ding Tai Fung franchise.  This place has a good reputation, so I came to give them a try.

Came for dinner last week, with three dining partners.  The restaurant, located at First Markham Place, is fairly elegant-looking inside with high ceilings, mahogany-colored wood walls, neutral colors, and pine-colored chairs.  Against the back, a section is walled in glass so you can view the soup dumpling preparation.  We made reservations for a Friday night and good thing, they were packed around 8:30 pm, with lines going for at least another hour or so.

We tried both available soup dumplings, the crab meat/pork and dried scallop/pork.  The former was excellent, and although still not at the level of what I had in Shanghai, definitely the best I've had in North America.  Thin, pliant skin encasing a tasty broth (a touch oily) and a very tender meat filling topped with real crab.  The scallop one was good but not as good by far.  We also had the Shanghai fried noodles: thick, nicely chewy noodles that were very tasty.  Spicy beef tendon came cubed, seasoned with a spicy oil: not as tender as I like.  Spicy wontons also very good; smooth skin, tasty meat with lots of filling, peppery spicy oil sauce.  \"3 cup chicken\" came in a large casserole: quality of the chicken was so-so, and was overcooked; sauce was rich and good.  Pea shoots sauteed in garlic was well-flavored but the vegetables themselves were not very fresh, a bit tough, probably not the best choice of greens that night.

I returned one more time to enjoy the crab/pork soup dumplings for brunch, accompanied by baby bok choy sauteed in garlic (slightly undercooked but otherwise good), and fried red bean paste filled pancake (crispy, freshly fried, tasty, not very sweet).

Definitely consider this a good place to get the steamed soup dumpling, with mixed feelings about the other items.  I've been impressed ^__^"}
{"text":"There are a few options for XLB in this area but Ding Tai Fung is by far my favorite. The pork is near perfect and the dumpling isn't too thick. Baby bok choy is also very crisp and delicious. Can't wait to be back in Toronto!"}
{"text":"A bit more expensive than most... however, it's definitely worth it. The atmosphere is much better than most. I especially love the 10 foot glass window where you can observe the cooks hard at work! Try the leek dumplings (steamed)... they're very tasty -- and mix them with a dab of vinegar -- careful not to burn your mouth, as these dumplings and other otherwise harmless small foods are usually filled with hot succulent soup; don't let the soup escape as it's definitely the best part!"}
{"text":"Worst food experience in 2018 so far. The Xiao long bao I had taste like overnight or expired meat, the juice inside is just disgusting not fresh at all. The worst one is the Shanghai style fried rice cake, everything tastes like soy sauce and there is a HUMAN HAIR inside the food! The waitress act like it's totally normal, they did apologize but the attitude was like I'm sorry but I'm not sorry.  I would not recommend anyone to eat here, it's expensive and disgusting. One star is me being generous."}
{"text":"Try  Ding Tai Fung's 
Xiao Long Bao (a.k.a. soup dumpling)
Snow peas sprout and black(or Chinese) mushroom
Wonton
Pan-fried pork dumpling

Green onion pancake was good. Wonton was spicy --they had housemade wonton which was the mixture of soy sauce, vinegar, sugar, and red chili oil - I can make it at home...but eat it here, otherwise I'd have to tip myself.

Yum at Ding Tai Fung!!"}
{"text":"SOOO good. Ordered the regular pork soup dumplings (Xiao long bao), fried squid, and steamed red bean dumplings. Then we saw the mini pork soup dumplings, and intrigued we ordered those too.

Everything was really good and yes the mini pork soup dumplings are just a mini version of the regular ones BUT in my opinion I prefer them to the regular sized ones. I think the mini ones had a better meat-to-skin-to-soup ratio I definitely suggest everyone to try them. Prices are also pretty reasonable especially compared to the Din Tai Fung in Arcadia which I have been to multiple times. And if I had to choose, I prefer this Ding Tai Fung in Markham because prices are better, dumplings are slightly better, and not as crazy busy, the DTF in Arcadia can be up to a 4 hr wait sometimes, RIDICULOUS. 

ORDER THE MINIS!!"}
{"text":"Now before some of you Xiao Long Bao fans go buck wild and think

\"oh sheeeeit dawg, a DTF 20+ mins away from Richmond Hill? Naaa-aaaaaah, dat's hella fresh doh!\" **

** - disclaimer: that is probably how some Nor Cal AZN would speak. Not sure how the CDN A$Ns/AZNs would speak, maybe with a slight Terrence and Philip slant, like the ones living in Markham might say \"DING Tai Fung is aroond aboot my hoose\". Oh yeah the average A$N is arguably more filthy rich up there than we care to know.

May I remind you the proper spelling of the OG shiznit pimp mofo global chain is DIN Tai Fung.

Sorry to disappoint but DING Tai Fung in Markham Ontario is NOT an official branch of Din Tia Fung

The proof is in da puddin' (or XLB)

http://www.dintaifung.com.tw/en/area_a_list.asp?AreaCountryNO=1

My guess is Ding Tai Fung is taken from the Cantonese phonetic pronounciation. Hopefully you can order in Mandarin here and it won't get fallen on deaf ears. They may have copied a similar menu to the legendary Din Tai Fung from Taiwan, have an identical Chinese name (down to the characters) and similar phonetically, but don't be fooled again yet for a minute.

North Americans will have to travel to Arcadia, CA (Southern California USA) to find the only branch on the continent  (two locations in fact) of the real deal.

But other than this tidbit, Ding Tai Fung is arguably one of the more decent Shanghainese style restaurants in the area, and is located in a giant mondo strip mall complex that houses many other Asian restaurants and shops. It has been around circa 2002/2003.

Get your XLBs here, along with the other classics like green onion pancakes, and Shanghai style fried noodles."}
{"text":"Wanted to update my critical 3-star review to THE FULL 5 STARS! Ding Tai Fung in the last few years has been THE place I visit on bad moods, cravings, \"a visit to Markham!!\", chat with friends over afternoon tea, and even giant family dinners.

I just didn't experience DTF fully! And now I did. 

Xiao long baos are really really really good. It's not consistent, recently it's not so good. But many times out of many times, the skin is thin and almost clear! The meat just melts in your mouth and sooooooooo soft. 

Spicy dumplings are good here! They're smaller than Hong Kong's version, but they are SPICY. And sweet. I find these more flavourful and have been my favourite dish from DTF Markham!

I also love the fried udon they do. After eating it, my breath smells like this all day long. It's worth the unladylike embarrassment.

There are three desserts I like from here. I always order the super delicious red bean pancake, served boiling hot. Sometimes I crave the big bread puff with sugar on top. And lastly the fluffy soft bread with sweet milk for dipping, this one is super good but very filling.

I still stand by my 3-star rating back in 2013. However since 2014 I am a happy, loyal customer.

What makes DTF 5 stars really is the staff!!! They are so nice to me. They don't know me, but they take care of me each and every time I visit. Super sweet ladies!!"}
{"text":"Let's just get this out of the way, if you are looking for the REAL Din Tai Fung, this is NOT the same thing.  This is a knock off called Din(g) Tai Fung.  It's one thing to try to replicate another restaurant's success, but to try to trick customers with the same name is just wrong.  Unless there is some story behind this, they blatantly tried stealing the name of the original Din Tai Fung and I'm guessing because their name is off by one character they can somehow get away with it.

We were visiting Toronto for the first time.  I purposely drove an extra 30 minutes from Toronto in hopes of having the classic DTF experience.  When I drove up to the restaurant, I knew something seemed fishy.  If you've ever been to any real DTF, the overall appearance is definitely off.  If I hadn't already drove 30 minutes out of my way to come here, I probably would have left, but I decided to give them a chance.  Sure they have the guys at the window making the XLBs, but that's about it.  I tried convincing myself, maybe this was one of the original locations, so they went for a more old-fashioned/authentic look and less like the other more commercialized locations in the US.  But once the food started coming out, it was obvious.  Everything was similar, but yet everything was slightly off plus with a lower quality.  IMO, the only thing that keeps this place alive is their XLBs are decent.  If I had to rate the XLBs by themselves, I would say maybe 3.5/5 stars.  They weren't great, but good.  The skin wasn't too thick, which I like, but not DTF thin.  However the rest of the food was just like any average restaurant, some were OK and others weren't that great.

If this place had some other generic Chinese Restaurant name, I probably would have given them 3/5 stars.  If I lived in the area and had an XLB craving, I would probably come back.  It would be an okay local place to eat.  However since they purposely chose to try trick customers into believing this is a real DTF, I have to lower their rating for that.  As a visitor, I could have gone to so many other good Chinese restaurants, but because of their name they got me.  So congratulations, at the end of the day you win because you got my money.  Shame on me for not digging a little deeper.  Sigh... hopefully others who read my review will at least know it's FAKE and can make their own decisions on whether they simply want some decent XLBs."}
