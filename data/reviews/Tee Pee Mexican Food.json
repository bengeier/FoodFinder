{"text":"Tee Pee as a whole had nice staff. The reason for my low rating is solely based on food preference. I am born and raised Californian Hispanic, I know Mexican food. However I would not define this as authentic or even good. Specific Items that I was extremely disappointed with were the tacos (taco shells should definitely be more authentic tasting not taste store bought), rice was under cooked and not sure what the seasoning was but is was no Spanish or hispanic style rice. Enchiladas were sauceless and we're just cover with cheese (Most of the plate was). Tortillas were very flour tasting not corn. Salsa tasted like pace picante hot salsa. I would relate this as a lower quality Don Jose's."}
{"text":"Great food and good service. Always have warm chips and consistently good salsa.  Typically go for one of the lunch specials---large potions, served hot, and quick.  The decor---yeah, it is pretty dated.  The dinning area is not at all conducive to large groups---but for a quick lunch, it is a good place to stop..  Especially like the bar area."}
{"text":"One thing Phoenix has in abundance is good Mexican food.  I mean REALLY good. So it's beyond me why anyone would settle for mediocre. Which this was.  It was bland.  It was greasy.  The shrimp dish we ordered had no spice or flavor at all.  My chips were fresh, which judging by the rest of the reviews here was a lucky thing. A side of soft corn tortillas came pre-slathered in grease, for some ridiculous reason. And for what it was, it was terribly overpriced.  That's not to say it was expensive at all, but Filibertos is consistently better than this was.  Somehow the two green corn tamales I got to go were $10?  Give me a break.  Yes, my butt shared the same space as Bush Junior's did (according to the plaque at our table), but that didn't enhance the experience."}
{"text":"Best chimichanga Ive ever had and that's what I always get. The chile relleno is unlike any Ive had before, it seems more brakefastish to me, but still very good."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here because we heard they served excellent Mexican food.  For one, the service took forever.  My boyfriend ordered fajitas which he said he enjoyed and I ordered enchiladas with chicken.  In my opinion, the prices on the menu were set sort of high for only having cheese inside it.  I believe it was around $9-10 for a plate of cheese enchiladas?   So I paid extra to have chicken inside and when it arrived they were drowning in greasy cheese.  I guess in lieu of enchilada sauce, they just put a dump load of cheese on top, melt it, and call it a day!  I probably found five pieces of meat inside each enchilada; I could only taste the cheese.  I seriously felt like I had ordered a cheese enchilada to begin with!    Then it took half an hour to get the check because the waitress kept ignoring our table, even when we were waving our hand to get her attention.  Our total before tip came out to about $27 for two of us, no alcohol or drinks ordered.  I felt I could have gotten better quality food and service for much less going to a chain such as Macayo's and we would have gotten to eat in a cleaner environment!"}
{"text":"Sat at the bar and ordered. Authentic and good food. Bartenders Nicole and Nick were the best!  Good service friendly knew customers well and just adorable."}
{"text":"Thanks so much for your support of Gregory's galactosemia fund raiser. Thanks to your generous donation and compassion, we raised $3,500 toward the the fight against this metabolic disorder. You guys are the best!"}
{"text":"This place is legendary !! The decor is awesome and the burritos are amazing. My wife loves the green chili Mary Lou and the staff always seems like they are having a great time. Oh yeah, I almost forgot, the have amazing cheeseburgers! I know it seems odd but the burgers are great."}
{"text":"The Tee Pee has been our favorite Phoenix haunt for 27 years - my husband's for 30-plus. We love the food and atmosphere. No pretentions. Good food reasonably priced. We flew in this weekend for a bittersweet trip. Figured we'd race to the Tee Pee for old time's sake. Plane arrived at 9:10. At the restaurant by 9:55, but alas, too late. Not quite. Ryan (grandson of the founder) served us a couple of beers and chips and salsa. It was wonderful. The crew was so generous with their time. We've no reason to come back to come back to Phoenix, but will route the occasional trip through Phoenix for a trip to theTee Pee. This place is an institution that is worthy of its reputation and following."}
{"text":"This place just flat out sucks. Terrible food (Taco Bell is better), rude and inattentive waiters, dingy, run down, and grossly overrated and overpriced. Will never go back again."}
{"text":"Positives:  -serves beer in chilled glasses -awesome TVs & bar to watch sports -chips & salsa -clean, divey ambiance -above average service  Negatives: -very inauthentic Mexican food, i.e. store bought taco shells -despite the great salsa, no good hot sauce -food delivered in skin melting heated plates   Overall a good neighborhood sports bar that happens to serve so-so Mexican food. La Pinata is still the gold standard in Phoenix Mexican food."}
{"text":"I might go back to this place if I lived in Asia and had not eaten Mexican food in years.  How can a kitchen staffed with Mexicans cook such god-awful Mexican food?  Phoenix strikes again!  Can not figure this town out."}
{"text":"Everyone I've talked to that likes this place says the same thing, \"I've been going there for years.\"  Yes - and perhaps years ago it didn't feel like a dive restaurant in constant jeopardy of being shut down for health code violations.  But now...  The food is completely, unmistakably mediocre.  As is the service.  Maybe it's not filthy - maybe it's just the lighting and decor that makes it look like that way.  But I'm pretty sure the roach I saw dart up the wall was real.  (Okay - that's a cheap shot - there are probably roaches in many places I've gone and I just haven't seen them.  Fair point.)  Nothing about this place makes it a can't miss.  I get the history, the nostalgia, and the fact that some famous people have dined there, but you can find better Mexican food all over the Valley and some just a short drive away."}
{"text":"I walked in and it felt like the help all knew everyone there. The bar area was full and there was just 2-3 tables open. The tables are close together, so you feel like you're sitting with the person at the next table, but that was ok.  The chips were warm, but cooled off quickly. The dip wasn't too hot and it was a good combination while I waited for my 'Tee Pee Daily Special'.  The special was a tostada, taco and enchilada with rice and beans. All tasted good.   The food was good, the atmosphere was better and the help was wonderful.  Now it's 2 hours later and I'm still full. If you want to see pictures, check out my blog at pmonahan.tumblr.com."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE  GO TO LOS OLIVOS OR LA FONDA OR LA TOLTECA OR SOMEWHERE ELSE  Never in my life have I written a review on anything - I enjoy reading people's comments and wonde how people can be so serious but have never submitted one. However after today's experience, I am compelled to discourage as many people as possible from going to TP.   The food: greasy, bland, no flavor  The iced tea: I think I was drinking dirty dishwater  The meal: fresh from the microwave  My \"TP special\" was a store bought taco shell halfway full of cheap ground beef that wasn't seasoned. They gracefully placed my tostada ON TOP of my enchilada, which means the crunchy shell/tosada holding device was melted to the rest of the food by the time it made it to my table (a mere 6 minutes after we ordered - what does that tell you?)  That's it...nothing serious. No roaches or hairs or any major disaster. But never in my life have I been rushed out of a restaurant, minutes after finishing my \"meal\" (yes, I finished it because I skipped lunch in anticpation of this \"authentic\" dining experience!)  Not even 10 minutes had passed and the \"manager\" (some fat, sweaty dude in a blue polo shirt) came up to the table where my friend and I were chatting and he actually asked us to LEAVE because he had a wait .. !!! are you f-ing serious??? Is that how a family owned restaurant conducts business?? I thought the charm and appeal of a long-standing family restaurant was that they make you feel at home?? Don't these places thrive on word-of-mouth advertising since they dont have the resources that major chains have?? Kick people out on a Tuesday night at 7pm less than an hour after they sit down??   That's all. Have a great night :)"}
{"text":"Ah Tee Pee ... my family has been Tee Pee patrons for four generations now.  A city staple, Tee Pee has good Mexican fare and has been around for decades; visited by some of the nations better known population.  And the fish tacos are amazing.  Definitely worth trying if you haven't found yourself in one of their booths before."}
{"text":"Just OK.  Went for lunch and decided to try one of their Lunch Specials.  Green Chile Beef Burro.  Their Chips are basic and a bit boring. Salsa was the same.  The Burro was a bit of a sloppy mess and lacked flavor. The Beans were soupy and rice was just decent.  Service was great. Not a place I'd go out of my way to go back to, but would consider giving it another try to see how they do on their other dishes. Nice little outdoor seating area."}
{"text":"Tee Pee was recommended to me by a friend as the best Mexican food in town.  My boyfriend and I went there on a Sunday night and were very disappointed.  The restaurant was noisy and crowded.  The salsa was spicy, but lacked flavor beyond the heat.    The guacamole was generally flavorless and had the consistency of baby food.  There were, occasionally, big chunks of avocado, which were nice but they seemed out of place in the puree.  The chips were fresh but, again, had no real taste.  I had chicken tacos, my 'baseline' meal for new Mexican restaurants.  My boyfriend had enchiladas.  Again... everything was simply so-so.  My taco shells seemed slightly stale and tasted like what I would get out of a taco kit from the store.  The chicken was tough.  My boyfriend was similarly underwhelmed by his meal.  The rice, however, was tasty.  I'll give them that much.  Overall, we will not be back.  There are too many excellent Mexican restaurants in the area to revisit mediocre ones."}
{"text":"People who don't like the Tee Pee didn't grow up in Phoenix in the 60s. Yup, you have to sit at 2 adjacent tables if there are more than 4 in your party, the decor has really never changed, the wait is long (so grab a pitcher of margaritas), and it's NOT Tex Mex! It's the simple Arizona Soronan unique to the area. Oh, and the Mary Lou was named for my mom.."}
{"text":"Everything tasted like it came out of a can, even the meat. This place is very small and smells weird inside almost like old moldy clothes. I found a piece of plastic in my food when I was pregnant and the \"manager\" said it was a stem from the salsa. It clearly wasn't. She refused to do anything to solve it. I refused to pay and walked out. Go to Taco Bell your better off."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for 20 years.  The food has remained excellent and I love that they don't change much the food nor the interior of the restaurant.  I don't understand the bad reviews except to say that maybe some of them are looking for more upscale places.  This place isn't meant to be a fancy joint but the food and service is still good as ever!  Ask for the presidential booth!"}
{"text":"Food is What you'd expect from a US Mexican restaurant (or Tex mex style, as they say)  Good food in a non pretentious atmosphere.  A favorite amongst locals.  Loud environment during busy times.  Food: 3.5 Service: 4 Ambiance: 2 (expected, neighborhood watering hole type) Value: 3"}
{"text":"Not sure what all the rage is about this place.  Probably one of the worst margaritas I've had. Also the food portion is HUGE! No one can possibly eat all that. And in terms of taste, thought it was bland.  Didn't even enjoy the chips and salsa.  Overall I would say sub-par in my book. Kinda of a hole-in-the-wall, maybe that's the draw for some people."}
{"text":"Horrible food! Vomiting now.  Salsa nasty, your better off buying dalsa from a jar. Restaurant looks dirty, menus dirty and sticky. 1 taco for 4.85 ! Food was just nasty. Definitely not authentic in any way! Taco bell has better food, and im not even a taco bell person. Save your money dont go here!"}
{"text":"I'm also pretty confused at the low ratings that I see here.  Tonight was my first time and I had an enchilada with beans and rice. I cleaned my plate and I REALLY didn't need to eat that much. It was just too good to stop. I also had my fair share of chips and salsa, which were pretty tasty.  My friend had a Carne Asada Burro and she was also very happy with it.  Let's not be confused. It's not a swanky restaurant, but I didn't feel as though it was noticeably dirty, either.  The service was super quick. We never had a time when we were out of anything, and it was pretty busy.  If I have the chance I'll go back again, no question."}
{"text":"Wow, what can I say! The worker at the hotel we were staying at highly recommended this place! It was waaaay overrated. I got the \"famous\" egg soufflé relleno, which was honestly pretty disgusting. You have to really really really like eggs (in the words of the waitress). Everything was way too cheesy.   However, The salsa seemed homemade and was actually pretty good. I would not highly recommend this place. I feel kinda sick after eating it."}
{"text":"Something happened.  We have been coming here for years, but no more.  The food has deteriorated, the salsa is actually awful and the service is beyond slow.  Time for a new Mexican restaurant. Bye-bye Tee-Pee."}
{"text":"If there was a way I could give this restaurant NO stars, I might have.  The chips and salsa are the ONLY thing that requires a star here.  The service was less than average, the food was hotter than the surface of the sun, and the drinks were teeny tiny (and didn't much taste like alcohol).  My husband ordered a green chile dish and it came smothered in red sauce, when he asked the waiter if it looked green or red, the server said, \"nope that's what green looks like\".  WOW!  Sorry but I don't think I will be returning."}
{"text":"Food was delicious, but when the waitress brought the hot plate a roach crawled out from it onto the table in front of me. Never had that happen in the fifty years of my life until now. Buyer beware!   She was quick to get the roach removed but it spoiled the meal.   #orkin"}
{"text":"How this place has less than four stars is a mystery to me. I have been 5 times and have taken out of towners here 2 out of the 5 and they all left saying it was yummy too. The El Presidential Especiale is a MUST - i order 86 the onions and add machaca/shredded beef. They are a simple yummy combination with their rice and beans. This is just straight up classic mexican food - not for the snobby. So if you want a more classy joint that's less authentic - hit up Z'Tejas cause this place is not for you. The hot salsa in the ketchup bottles is always a sign of a great mexican joint (and it's hot AND tastey - a combination not many get correct). I will say their chips can be a little on the less crunchy, more oily side but they are more than happy to replace that with some that are a little more to your liking. And their margs are delish as well. This place deserves a 4 because of consistency, friendly and accomodating atmosphere and just downright solid take on enchiladas - red sauce is spot on. Thanks Tee Pee for being our go-to for Mexican food in the Valley of the Sun!"}
{"text":"great ambiance, awesome chips and salsa, and mean fajitas. only negative is it can be really busy and noisy. cheese crisps are great too."}
{"text":"The Tee Pee is a Phoenix institution and known for its monster Chili Rellenos. I was traveling with a friend who loves Chili Rellenos so I thought it would be a perfect choice!   As our waitress delivered the plate, you could hear the gasps and people asking \"what's that?\" as she walked by. It was indeed a monster creation. Unfortunately, it didn't live up to its hype. Under two massive mounds of egg souffle, there was one little green chili with a little bit of cheese. My friend didn't like it at all. I liked it a little more than he did, but I think he was right when he said it must be their \"gimmick\" dish.   Even though the Chili Rellenos disappointed, our waitress (whose name I failed to get .. arghhh!)_was excellent. She was so nice and friendly, but not in that sickeningly nice way. She was attentive and incredibly accommodating and helpful.   We would definitely try the Tee Pee again, but would just order something different next time."}
{"text":"I feel a bit guilty giving this place only 3 stars, due to the reason I visited the Tee Pee, but being an honest, good little yelper I can not tell a lie.  My Step Father recently passed away unexpectedly here in MD and we had to make a trip out to Chandler, AZ where he grew up, and had wished to be laid to rest. The Tee Pee was one of my Step Dad & my Mom's favorites places to come and eat while they were visiting. For years they would go on tubing trips down the river, and their favorite place to go afterwards was the Tee Pee. It was a tradition.   The atmosphere is definitely casual. It is laid back which I love. The patio is pretty cool, with the tv's and the misters. The owner was extremely considerate and was very, very nice. He gave our huge party complimentary cheese crisps  for every table, as he had heard what had happened, which I will give an extra star, because service does matter. The servers, bartender's, and the owner are all super friendly and pleasant.   The only issue I had with the place was the food. It was terrible. The famous cheese crisps are just a simple flour tortilla with melted cheese. The chips were stale, the salsa average. The guacamole was pretty good however. My brother and I split the chicken chimichanga. It was massive. It was a little too greasy for my taste. I have had better mexican food at chipotle. I don't really get what all the other reviewers are raving about, how Tee Pee serves authentic Mexican food, in my opinion it's simpy Tex Mex. I am from MD and I think I have had more authentic Mexican food in my home town. I thought I would be in for a treat being in AZ. So I was extremely disappointed in the food. Not a huge fan of the margarita's either, the only good thing about them was the salt.   Needless to say I was glad to experience a place that they had loved and enjoyed together. However I think they forgot to mention that they were always hammered after those all day tubing trips so I am sure the food was amazing after several cold beers, and the Arizona sun."}
{"text":"I got the enchiladas and they were good. My husband got one fish taco and one chicken taco. He said the fish one wasn't that great, but the chicken was ok."}
{"text":"Why does this place have so many 1 and 2 star reviews? I just don't understand. I have been coming here for YEARS. Even before I went the vegetarian/vegan route. I used to have birthday party dinners here when I was a kid. This place has always been my favorite Mexican place to eat at, and is always super crowded with people. You should have seen it the day after the Superbowl. It was a mad house! But because I love it so, we still waited the thirty minutes and ate here anyways.  The service is sort of touchy. Some times we get really good servers who are friendly, and other times we get the ones who just rush and take your order and don't bother to care about you at all. Really though, as long as the service is fast, I could care less about whether or not they talk to me. It is just nice when they do.   The food is always hot, and always comes out super fast. I always order a bean chimichunga with no cheese, no sour cream, and all beans on the side with no cheese. The lettuce and tomatoes they put all over every dish is slightly annoying and I always forget to ask for them to take it off, but whatever. I love my bean chimi.   Whoever comes here and expects to get 5 star Mexican food is kidding themselves. You can tell from the outside of this place that when you come in here, you are going to get some greasy bad for you Mexican food. And that is exactly why I frequent this place. When I am in the mood to just eat greasy food that's going to make me feel like I just ate 3000 calories, I come here. Because even being a vegetarian, you have to have a place where you go to eat bad for you food."}
{"text":"I've been coming to the Tee Pee since 1967. Tonight was an epic fail. While waiting for a table I stood at the window bar in the waiting area , the bartenders never looked my way , when they finally did they seemed put off. At the table we had to practically yell to get more water. Drinks sat empty. Food was average. It's an iconic restaurant and a big part of my growing up. But lost a lot of its appeal last night."}
{"text":"Excellent food and drinks and excellent service.  We dined there tonight.  It is \"old school\" and that's what makes it so special.  Love Tee Pee!"}
{"text":"Hopefully this will help you sort through all the Mexican food choices in the valley. Tee Pee has been around for a long time and has hosted some pretty famous people, including George W. Bush (put all politics aside, if the the President of The United States has visited a restaurant, I think you should try it). Make sure you go hungry - the portions are HUGE, even by American standards. Chips and salsa are standard when you sit and the salsa is good & hot (but not too hot). The booths are old & cosy, the room loud with folks of all ages have a grand time, the margaritas are best poured from a pitcher and the food is authentic, old-school Mexican."}
{"text":"I was very happy with my enchildas and side dishes. Chips and salsa were not as good as I have had at other Mexican places in town."}
{"text":"The Tee Pee is a Phoenix institution started by the Duran family almost fifty years ago.It is a casual and informal tavern with a small dining area.Phoenix powerbrokers when entertaining President Bush chose the Tee Pee as one of a few local restaurants to entertain him.While perhaps not among the best of Phoenix`s Mexican restaurants it is very good.Among the dishes they do well is their chili relleno.Also noteworthy is their chimichanga.Chips and salsa would rate as average.It has changed very little in the last few decades but that is what makes it endearing to their regular clientele."}
{"text":"This food is NOT MEXICAN, everything is grease and nasty with no flavor. This place is only good for drinking beer."}
{"text":"Weird chile rellenos!!!  Plain egg white meringue piled on top of plain green chiles on top of some cheese.  No flavor.  A huge disappointment and not at all worth all the buzz about a former President eating there.  The chips and salsa were tolerable, hence the two stars."}
{"text":"Kind of a dive - but great margaritas and authentic Mexican food.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Great cheese crisp, actually it's the best in town. I love the salsa! My go to dish is the chicken fajita burro, enchilada style, side of rice.   This is not the place for table side  guacamole or exotic tacos. It's good old, greasy spoon Mexican!   Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"A popular restaurant! Very homey. Excellent sized portions. Very tasty. The margarita was potent. There was some confusion as to the \"pick three platter\"-- for some reason the corn tamale cost extra though it wasn't identified as being more expensive item to choose. Weirdly, they don't have  queso! All in all, a definite place to check out."}
{"text":"Awesome enchiladas and margaritas.  I wish I would have seen the review about the tamales before I'd been, else I would have ordered some."}
{"text":"Yes its a classic, yes W ate here. Wish I could say I love it or even like it.  First the dinning room itself. The booths are tiny - originally probably made for 2, but they consistently jam in 4. Not comfortable .  The food, everything buried under a mound of cheap cheese, then thrown under a broiler and brought to you hellishly hot. No flavor, really doesn't matter what you order, it all looks and tastes the same. Don't you love scraping that burnt dead skin from the roof of you mouth."}
{"text":"I love this place and the history that goes with it! If you want consistency year after year, go!"}
{"text":"My favorite! Nothing sexy in regard to decor. Just great food, great drinks, in a casual atmosphere. Excellent margaritas, I suggest ordering them by the picture. Favorite burrito is the fajitta burrito. Staff handles special requests very well."}
{"text":"Meh. I had high hopes for this place. Hole in the wall look from the outside gave me hope that it was old fashioned charm, tried and true food and great service. We had heard good reviews so I am also suspicious that maybe we just had an off day? Our server seemed timid and confused...almost had to ask her to take our drink orders which was kinda strange. We had ordered ice tea and it was sour. When we mentioned it was old and had asked for something different, she said oh..ok, just one or both of you?  Well.. its sour for both of us.. sooo.. :-/ We waited about 25 minutes for a cheesecrisp-- not a big deal as we weren't in a rush. We didn't finish it however, because it was far too greasy. We had sopped up some of the grease but our stomachs said stopppp.. so we did. --Not before I had asked for pico and was brough a bowl of little onions. I said is this the pico? \"Yes.\" They had two one stall restrooms (one in the dining and one in the bar) which were both full the entire time we were there-- with 2-3 people waiting outside of each. Not our ideal mexican food spot... Phoenix offers better choices."}
{"text":"I have heard about all the past famous diners here such as President Bush, and many athelets, etc.  We walked in around 6pm and was like, \"THIS is the place? are you SURE? is it even OPEN???\"  it was dead inside.  Ill just skip to the food part-  I ordered this dish that came with a ground beef taco, cheese enchilada, and beef tamale.  All of it was good expect the tamale which tasted \"grainy\"  ok here we go, long story short I wont be going again but glad I went to SAY I've been."}
{"text":"Honestly this is REAL GOOD food but it was hyped up to me as the best Mexican food around. It is good and the place is real friendly. Bottom line SOLID FOOD and GOOD ATMOSPHERE. It did not rock my world though."}
{"text":"MMy mom and i stopped in here for dinner one evening. We had a friendly waiter. He asked us what we wanted to drink, and my mom and i debated weather we were going to have soda or Margaritas.  We eventually chose to have a pitcher of margaritas (poor guy had to stand there almost a whole minute because we couldn't make up our mind. Like mother like daughter) anyway, he came back & took our food order. I got a Taco. He came back & gave us our food. We asked if he had forgotten our pitcher. He said sorry and thought we decided not to order it. We clearly did and even told him we wanted strawberry not plain. We had already gotten our food by then and said forget it. He was apologetic. He came with the check and told us we had a little discount. My mom looked at it and found out he gave her the senior discount. Ha ha! My mom is 40 something and def doesn't look like a senior, but that was his way of giving us the discount. My mom was kind of like wtf... Lol but didn't mind the discount. It was a good effort on his part but she has a thing with her age. Anyway my moms dish was delicious. My Taco was okay. I've had better. It was just boring. Chips and salsa were good too. And i love free anything! Our waiter, bless his heart, was friendly and educated about the menu. It was fairly priced. The decor is kind of meh. it definitely needs a remodel. I hated the booths, the springs were broken in some spots. But if the food is good, I can over look all that. I will probably sit outside next time. It has a nice little patio area with tv's. The parking lot is ALWAYS crowded when I drive by, unless It's closed. Great sign, that's why we stopped in. I will have to go back to try the drinks and some other items on their menu. U wasn't very hungry when we went, that's why i only got a Taco. But I love some good Mexican food and def want to try other stuff. Place was busy when we went but had good and fast service. I'll be back and update this once I try more food!"}

{"text":"Tee Pee | A Historic Arcadia Restaurant with only the Best Food, Drink, and Staff  Perhaps best known for a few reasons... The longevity of the restaurant's existence and success in Arcadia (as a Native, I've been going to Tee Pee for almost 30 years!), the famed visit by President George W. Bush and his order as a specialty item on the menu, or the darn good Mexican food and excellent vibe, the Tee Pee is a \"must-attend\" for anyone new to the Arcadia community, and a mainstay for Arcadians since its open in 1958. The owner and his staff, including family, are the best in town - friendly, happy to customize your meal to your liking - and the food is always great. You can always tell the success of a Mexican food restaurant by its cheese crisp I say, and theirs has been tasting great for decades :)."}
{"text":"Not bad.   Lots of food for the price.   Very good guacamole.   Alot more people fit in this restaurant than it looks from the outside."}
{"text":"They were fast, but I'll agree with the New Times that this is one of the worst Mexican restaurants in Phoenix. I've tried a few menu items now and haven't enjoyed any of them. The atmosphere is also less than great - if you're seated in the middle, you are direct next to another table with no divider between and end up hearing every word of their conversation."}
{"text":"To sum it up: I sat down where President Bush sat. The food was as awful as his tenure as president. Loved the ambiance though."}
{"text":"What a joke, no fruit water, no desserts of any kind, no tea, the \" best albondigas in Phx, \" were passble at best , service by a non- mexican female who didnt know \"come here from sick em\" was terrible.. Didnt know anything about mexican cuisine { food } . After eating at the Tee Pee , I really needed T. P. to recover.."}
{"text":"This place is adequate, and I like the huge iced teas, but the food is nothing special.  Everything is okay, and because it's so close I wound up eating at Tee Pee several times in the past few months-----but then I just stopped, because you can find better Senoran Mexican food than this.  The service is usually fantastic, and a lot of people must apparently like the vibe (bar?), but there are many mom and pop Mexican places in Phoenix that have superior flavors to this.  I've tried just about everything, but when you pay $11 and you just can't seem to find one menu item that rocks, you move on."}
{"text":"Very good quality food and service. It is a great place to bring family and friends. Chips and salsa are fresh and the combination plates are always filling."}
{"text":"went to TeePee while on vacation and looking for good mexican food. loved,  loved the ambiance of this place. and the food and margaritas were great!!"}
{"text":"Usually, great spot. Tonight: 1. Hostess just pointed to table, did not escort us to it...no big deal, just unprofessional. 2. Ordered Special without onions, came without the enchilada. Finally did get the enchilada...it was stuffed with onions. Service slow, due to being understaffed. Finally, table next to us brought their dog...no problem until it had diarrhea. That nearly cleared the place out! Have to wonder, new management?"}
{"text":"I've had fun here with friends out on the patio and enjoyed margaritas and chips and dip. But for a meal? No thank you. It's nothing worth writing home about - greasy, unseasoned \"Mexican\" food without a lot of jazz."}
{"text":"Ambiance: This place is great coming into when it's triple digit heat outside. It was nice and cool, low lighting, and love the booths.  Food: We came here for lunch and I had one of the specials: one chicken enchilada with red sauce, rice, and beans. The plates come volcano hot, which I love, as they are very generous with the cheese and my favorite part is the crispy bits on the edges. For around $8, this is quite a bit of food, especially after the chips and salsa. I like how their chips are thin and light and their salsa is nice and chunky, not too hot.  Service: very friendly and accurate service, she was a pro for sure."}
{"text":"Food was freakin great. Teenagers loved it, wife loved it, and I devoured it. Had fajitas, enchiladas, quesadillas, and chili Rallino and tamales.   Atmosphere was awesome!  Loved the lighting and the old school booths.   Server was very helpful with ordering too."}
{"text":"Since leaving the beautiful state of Arizona, I always fill up on Mexican food when I'm home visiting.  This place is THE place for authentic mexican food.  It's not fancy or chic, in fact it's a hole in the wall.  It's clean just old.  Good margarita, great chips and salsa and the beans are definitely authentic.  Great meal.  This is your place if you want to experience authentic mexican food.  Tons of celebrities have visited this place, it's evident when you walk in the door and see all the autographs."}
{"text":"Zipp - you don't get it ---- I have had it with this place, never to back again - I have lived in the neighborhood since 1983 and thought the place was OK - but kind of a dive but, comfortable place where one should enjoy themselves. I think the original founders probably did really care - but Zipp and the gang are really just out for the buck.   Nothing wrong with a buck but when George Bush visited there - their business went up significantly - and they raised the prices - Not everyone in Arcadia is wealthy including myself.   The staff over the years has never seemed to care about whether you were there or not - and I stopped going for a number of years. A few years ago - I broke down and took my wife in on a Friday night ------ out jumps a cockroach - from my wife's lettuce next to her red chile burro - staff just tried to keep me quiet and in my opinion insinuated that I planted the roach. Then they asked my name to take down the information and I told them ---- Nick - then the manager wanted my last name and I told him \"Bush\". They didn't laugh. I did file a complaint with the health department online.   I stopped going again for several years ---- and last month - I broke down and got food to go - it was not bad --- However, tonight did it and I am telling you in my opinion they don't care about the customer. I noticed over the last several years --- business has been down when I drove by -- and they have made some changes now to the structure in an apparent attempt to get back some lost business.   Anyhow ----- tonight I called up and as usual - their phone service was awful -- The fellow answering the phone picks up and yells tee pee - I couldn't understand him - and thought maybe I was phoning a Chinese place. Then when I told him I wanted an order for pickup - he said - hold on let me get one of my girls to get it for you. Come on - this is 2012 - one of my girls - excuse me.   I ordered three chile burros, one cheese crisp, one side of rice and beans. When the cashier rang it up it came to 39 dollars and some cents ---- I thought to myself what the heck is going on (13 dollars a person - notice it was only two side dishes) ---- I said I thought that sounded like a lot --- and the cashier checked the bill - said that it was right - and then the fellow who brought the food out said - the prices are on the menu - I said I believed him, just that it seemed like a lot of money for take out and not very many items. I told them that the pricing would definitely influence me not coming back regularly. Oh I must say the chips were included - and they offered to give me a menu to take - No thank you.   First, if they had kept the quality up from the very old days - gave the customers more and better attention - not over done it on the price increases due to Bush eating there - my guess is that business would not have fallen as it did despite the recession - so now they have gone into a survival mode type of situation and spent a ton of money on a patio ect ect ect. Well I am not going to pay for it - to eat  -- not bad Mexican Food (if there is no cockroach around), but definitely average and that is stretching it.   I will never go back and I would definitely - never recommend it to anyone, especially visitors. Their early success of providing a quality meal, at a reasonable price, in a quaint location - has not been followed by the current owners or staff. Methinks not and never again. I will search for a Mexican rest that wants my business, has quality food and charges more reasonably."}
{"text":"The Tee Pee is not so bueno.  It does have a cool old school Arizona vibe that's hard to come by.  The decor is totally quirky.  It was amusing to watch parties of six sit in side-by-side booths for four and two.  The BF and I got  the \"privilege\" of sitting at the George W. Bush table.  Putting lame duck politics aside, the food was pretty lame as well.   The chips were greasy and the salsa was bland.  The Albondigas Soup was the best part of the meal.  The meatballs were tasty (but sparse) and the chicken broth was nicely spicy.  The fajitas left much to be desired.  The beef and chicken were both over- cooked while the onions were nearly raw.  The portions were okay for lunch, but they would be lacking for dinner (and we didn't order off of a lunch menu).    This place has a downscale touristy vibe.  I watched a group of six take multiple pictures of themselves in the quirky booths and of the food.  Perhaps they want the pictures for an exhibit of what Mexican food looked like in the US in the 1950s.  Time has marched on from the Tee Pee.  For wallet-friendly Mexican, check out Mi Patio on 7th Avenue.  For gourmet Mexican, head over to Barrio Cafe on 16th Street."}
{"text":"This is the best Mexican food in town.  The portions are huge, the service is good, and the prices are reasonable.  The machaca and the red chili beef are both exceptionally good."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, this place doesn't do it for me.....and that seems to be the case for many other reviewers here.  Four of us came here and ordered different things. Overall and thoroughly, the food quality and taste is just not particularly great. My mom actually, literally hated it.  Service wasn't bad, decor kinda divey......  Ironically, we were looking for a Mexican place and it seemed this was the first one we found after driving for a while. Phoenix is fairly close to Mexico and yet......(??)."}
{"text":"Don't waste your money the food is horrible. If I could rate a minus I would. Horrible service."}
{"text":"Great hot plate Mexican food especially for cheese lovers. The relleno is a classic here and my personal favorite is the red burro and enchilada plate. Great comfort food! Margaritas are not to be missed one of the few I can actually drink with out feeling my teeth decaying"}
{"text":"I do the lunch special on most visits but the menu is fantastic! great Mexican food at a fair price. must try!"}
{"text":"I'm in Phx, Az for the day. Hit TeePee Mexican food at a Pals suggestion. The chili Colorado is superb! The # 7 plate! Iced tea and a cheese crisp. I may never leave. The bar is kickin w the golf channel!  Bravo TeePee"}
{"text":"Best Margaritas/Mexican food in town......PERIOD!  Say HI to Brando behind the bar for me....cool dude!!!"}
{"text":"The reviews for here are spot on. The food was okay. Yummy margaritas! Okay salsa, but not great. Overcooked chips. But considering we live in Phoenix there is no need to waste your time eating here. There are hundreds of better Mexican food restaurants that you don't have to wait to be seated and way better priced."}
{"text":"Favorite Mexican food in Phoenix, Arizona hands down."}
{"text":"You know the kind of place that serves Mexican food perfect for Grandma Jolene from Savannah and Uncle Ned from Minnetonka?  This is that place."}
{"text":"First off, the food was pretty decent I will give them that. I work in the service industry and I can understand if you're busy or what not but please engage with the customer.   I ordered a chili relleno, I didn't even know there where two types. There's the Nano Relleno and one other, I forget the name. Well I ordered the Nana thinking it was the fried version. When I got my plate I realized I made the wrong order and asked a simple question to see if what I ordered was what I was excepting. I was then told that there where two different types of relleno and I asked for the one I thought I ordered, the staff hesitated at first but ended up taking my plate and said it would be a 20 minute wait for the one I want to be made. I waited for my plate, about 15-20 minutes later I got this huge friend chili relleno so massive it had to come on a separate plate than the rice and beans. The flavor was ok, a little greasy and the rice was a tad burnt along with the beans the relleno sauce was on point, and the tortilla was average at best. When I was finished eating, I asked for dessert since I was with a group and I was told that they didn't have dessert at the moment. I waited for my check, and to my dismay, I was charged for both chili's one I at the other was taken from me. It would take a other 15-20 minutes for them to grab our checks. As they where grabbed I asked if I had to pay for both items, I ended up just paying for one. Even though I didn't have the best service, one our waitress had about 4-5 tables of her own I still tipped pretty well. I was just sad I had to go through a lot to get the right food, pay my tab and have so so service. I will give the benefit of the doubt that there weren't enough people to help out, or maybe they where having a bad day. I am also sorry that I didn't know the difference between the two dishes I ordered. All in all I will give them one star for fixing my order and giving me (the idiot) the correct one, and one star for a pleasant decor around the restaurant. Working as a chef, and as a sever I would safely safe that I will never eat there again sadly."}
{"text":"If you don't like a hole in the wall for food- don't come here.  The booths are tiny and it's definitely an interesting vibe inside.  With that being said, I find that these places often have the best food, and Tee Pee lived up to that.  Great enchiladas!"}
{"text":"Ok...So I write this with a heavy heart as the TP Tap Room used to be the best Mexi's in town. I do not like dining in the dining room of this restaurant but the bar room is nice. Years and Years ago Tee Pee was an institution for sloppy mexican food in phoenix. But my last 5-10 visits have all been very subpar. Lets be real, Sloppy mexican food is not tough to make, but being a phx local, it is in our blood to love an enchi and shredded beef Tacos....it pains me to write that the food quality is just plain bad. You can tell the owners have gotten sloppy, probably are more hands off than they used to be, and the restaurant is starting to lose its allure with so many other good spots in phoenix. Really is a sad story. My extra crispy taco came with charred beef on top and then all soggy-ness. I asked the bartender if she thought it was crispy and she replied, do you want me to take it back or something? Yes of course I do, I asked for an extra crispy taco, not a soggy meat rag. Of course, I did not say that, and the bartender did not ask if I wanted another after showing her, it was about the opposite of crispy....A phoenix institution, yes....good food, not anymore."}
{"text":"You know, I like the food and the salsa here.  Chips come out very hot and the salsa is yummy.  The bummer is that their margaritas are terrible.  We ordered a top shelf margarita and it was one of the worst I'd ever had.  Their prices are really very high for what you get and I'm really surprised its as crowded as I've seen it.  I'm wondering if its the fact that President Bush ate here?  Does nothing for me but maybe for someone else??  If they had better margaritas, I'd probably go back but truly nothing out of this world..."}
{"text":"We finally made it to TeePee after hearing about it for years.  The staff is friendly, and for as crowded as it was on a MLK holiday, the wait wasn't bad at all. I had a shrimp fajita burro, which was very big and stuffed with the usual onions and peppers, but this one was a little better than most places as everything had been spiced. A lot of flavor with just a hit a chilis, not enough to make your nose run, so perfect for me. The level of noise was above average, but it was from people talking, not music or a tv.  Really had to yell across the table to be heard, but it seemed like everyone was having to. The waiter kept an eye on us and kept our drinks full, and with so many patrons, I have to give him a thumbs up. We'll be back."}
{"text":"The food was good, not fantastic, but good.  The chile rellenos were amazing!!! My husband couldn't even eat them all, they were that big.  The house margaritas were good - it was $2 Tuesday so hard to complain there.    The atmosphere is worth the trip all by itself.  Although it was very busy, they got our party of 5 (with two toddlers) seated within 10 minutes.  The chips and salsa kept on coming and kept the kiddos happy.  My 4 yr old is a connoisseur of flavorful but not too spicy salsa, and Tee Pee's salsa fit the bill.  The chips were fresh, warm and crispy.  All in all a nice, reasonable dinner, great atmosphere and family friendly.  We'll be back again and again."}
{"text":"This place has been around forever...and looks like it. The night I went for dinner they seemed a bit unorganized at the host stand. We waited about 20min to be seated. The table and booth were just a little on the greasy/dirty side.  I know this is a greasy Mexican food place so I ordered enchiladas...gotta love anything smothered in cheese. They arrived after a significant wait. The enchilada sauce had a pool of grease floating on top which was a little unappetizing.  The flavor was just meh. Not horrible, but I am in no hurry to return.  The bar seemed like a fun scene with a bunch of regulars, so I might be back for some cocktails before I eat dinner somewhere else."}
{"text":"Stopped here on Sunday evening with my son.  We sat on the patio. Service was slow not sure why as they weren't busy. Ordered our meals, didn't have to wait too long however mine was correct but my son's was completely wrong.  They took forever to come out with his chimichanga,  meanwhile I'm eating alone.  The waiter never came by to refill our chip basket.  The salsa totally sucked.  It had no taste, way too watery.   Avoid this place even if it was the place on earth.  You can do better."}
{"text":"We went there for lunch last week...and we went very early by my standards- 11:15 AM.   Fifteeen minutes later, the place was jammed, and this was on a Tuesday.  I ordered the Mexican Pizza and the other person I was with ordered their famous Chile Relleno.    I enjoyed the chips that came out and the salsa wasn't too bad either.  We did have to wait a bit due to the time it takes to make the Chile Relleno.    As far as the food, I enjoyed the Mexican Pizza-not only was it huge, it was very tasty.  I did not try the Chile Relleno-not my thing- but the other person enjoyed it as well.  It was incredibly large-it was easily larger than a football.  I will probably go back at some point.  I'm not one for waiting in lines so when I do go back, I will go before 11:30 AM."}
{"text":"We went here for the first time on a whim. So happy we did! Be prepared to walk out fat and happy. Being from Colorado, this is the kind of Mexican food I've been looking for. Cheesy, smothered everything.  The Happy Hour is killer - you can eat a feast for less than you could at Taco Bell and the food is 100% better than T-Bell. The cheese and onion enchiladas (Presidential Special) was really good. The combo plates were all good and that chili relleno - holy moly was that thing good. We got the one that is NOT battered in egg. The most surprising part of the meal? The chicken wings.  Yes, I said chicken wings.  Good ol fashioned Franks Red Hot style chicken wings - 6 for $3 and they were plump, amazingly cooked wings! Definitely dingy inside (made me slightly nervous) but once you sit down and start looking around you realize that everyone at the bar is a regular whose order the bartender knows when they sit down, the wait staff has probably been there forever and everyone in the place had a smile on their face.  I love Mexican food and I tend to have a soft spot for a good dive bar - if you're like me, do not walk, RUN to TeePee!"}
{"text":"I'm totally baffled that the Tee Pee only has 3 stars on yelp!  I've never before had a better (American) Mexican food experience than what I've seen here on numerous occasions.   The place was wall-to-wall packed every time I was there, they HAD to have been doing something right.  Those quesadillas are just out of this world.  I try to emulate the style every time I make em at my house..they're never quite as good, but at least they take me back to the Tee Pee.  I love their burros and the machaca.  Great drinks and friendly, attentive staff once you finally get seated.    You gotta get to the Tee Pee when you're in the Phoenix area.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"A solid 3.5 stars I would say!  An institution in Phoenix I learned about it ironically enough from my company's VP who is based in Dallas and every time she and her corporate entourage is in town we HAVE to go to Tee Pee it seems as soon as she arrives, it is her favorite.  Sure enough a big black Suburban will drop them off from their resort like clockwork!  Luckily there is plenty of parking including a spillover lot across the street.  President Bush evidently ate there and they named his meal after him, cheese enchiladas with onion I think, for the former leader of the free world he isn't very culinary adventurous. Nana's Chili Relleno is a favorite of everyone, forget what you know of Chili Relleno this one will shock you if you are not prepared, it is so big with so much egg it looks like your server put a roasted head of cauliflower on your plate it's really more of a soufflé.  The Chilis are always very good with a solid flavor the egg coating however can vary.  Sometimes it has a good egg and batter flavor other times it's like a flavorless sponge.  The chips are always good as are the beans, the rice has come out slightly overcooked a few times but it wasn't bad.  A popular spot in Phoenix I like local institutions."}
{"text":"Went here with a friend and got a quesadilla and he had a chimichanga. Average food, salsa was like tomato sauce, and the prices were def cheap! Come here if u want somethin cheap! I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"The customer service here is great! The atmosphere is retro and cozy. The food is good and big proportions. I had the wrong dish come out for me and they were so good about getting me the right plate and they let me take home the wrong dish and didn't charge us. The kids menu is awesome, big servings for kids and super low price. I haven't found my perfect dish there yet but we will be going back!"}
{"text":"Good ol' Tee Pee! Love their chimis and machaca  beef/cxn. Not a fan of the tamales. Love salsa, and TeePee's has decent salsa but ive had better. Still one of my fav places to take out of town guests!"}
{"text":"I would have to say \"SUPRISE\" is the first words that come to mind with this hole in the wall or you could say it is the crowds of people waiting to hit this joint all night.   I have had better, but the food was good. I had the chorizo and eggs. It could have had more spice. The tortillas were hot and fresh. I had a good experience."}
{"text":"My brother and I both got the runs after eating here.  We both believe it was from bad food at Tee Pee's."}
{"text":"This place is cute! It started pouring down rain when we got there so we ran inside as fast as we could. It was really crowded and the place is kinda small. Its family owned and has a lot of menu items. It wasnt bad I just wasnt a fan. Their chips were really greasy but their salsa was really good! The people we were with ordered 2 Chili Rellanos for our 2 tables and I wasnt impressed. When you look at it you're thinking like \"wow\" but there was barely any chili and mostly all egg whites. blah. I ordered one of their lunch specials for my entree which was a burrito with red sauce, chicken and it came with rice and beans. I was expecting it to take a while for our food since it was so crowded but it didnt really take that long. I would prob go back and try some other stuff."}
{"text":"Hi Y'all,  I goes into this place thinkin its a native american ristorant cause of the name, Tee Pee, get it. Well, guess what....no native american comida! Not even a prairie dog or a little piece of BBQ squirrels. Instead they got mexsican things. I liked it too. Them waitresses was muy caliente amigo So kind of bad that they aint got real indian food, but pretty good chumichuncas.  Otto \"12\""}
{"text":"This is a Phoenix institution & the vibe of the room truly shpws that it's the local's fav family spot - I didn't have an appetite as my dining mates, but their enchiladas & chili rellenos looked pretty authentic.  We enjoyed the chips & salsa that were served immediately & replenished as often as our beverages.  It's not pico de gallo, but it was still pretty decent.  I had the shrimp ceviche - a bit disappointed as the shrimp seemed precooked .  Since my dining mates enjoyed their entrees (+ chimichangas, tacos, burritos), I factored it into my rating."}
{"text":"Waited about 10 minutes on a late, weekend night. Parking lot isn't huge so finding a spot can be a little difficult.  Environment was part of the experience - It was relaxed with a very mixed crowd of college kids, older men in slacks and dressy couples from the Arcadia area. Booths look worn but were clean along with the tables.  Had originally ordered two Margs from the bar, they were not made in time so the bartender brought them to our table (literally in the bar area). Wonderful Chips and salsa were brought to our table almost immediately upon sitting and the refill was prompt once our server noticed the empty bowl. Our server greeted us within 5 mintues, not talkative at all but in a good way. After ordering, our food came out in about the average wait time, enough to enjoy our drinks and converse. GF had the Chile Relleno and it was...unusual. Basically a plate of grease, cheddar, chile and a mound of \"foam.\" They warn you before ordering that's it's not typical Chile Relleno so I cannot complain. I had a wonderful combo plate, served very hot and looking freshly made (no signs of sitting). Prices on drinks and food were reasonable and I would probably compare the food style to Serrano's or possibly closer to Garcia's in the East Valley.  Overall, I'm pleased with my visit and may return."}
{"text":"Traveled all the way from Wilkes-Barre, PA.  Expecting great Mexican food.  Ordered combo of enchillada, tamale and taco.  Food was ok but better at LA Tolteca in PA.  Who would have thunk it?"}
{"text":"This place was very good just 5 years ago!  NOW, Worst in the valley.  Chips are bad - they came to our table and looked double fried... just full of grease. We asked the server for fresh ones. He said that they only fry chips in the morning.  He said he should warm these up.....   He took the chips that we were picking at and put them into the fryer again....  gross and yuk! .. salsa is old and was setting on the table when we got there... as it was on every other table with no one there.  Ours had started fermenting. Over all just a real lack of caring here anymore.  Very sad... OH very sad!!   Won't every be back!"}
{"text":"I haven't been to the Tee Pee in several years and my last experience was below average.  I made reservations for a party of 5.  We arrived on time and proceeded to wait nearly 30 minutes before we were seated.  When they went to seat us they had us at 2 separate tables, one that seated 4 and another that seated 2.  I didn't want to make a scene so I asked if we could pull up a chair to the table of 4.  This was the best part of our visit.  We order our food pretty quickly and and about 20 minutes later our waiter said it would be a little while before our food was out.  We wait about another 15 minutes, no big deal.   When the food arrived it looked like mush.  My wife and I split a plate.  The Tamale was literally falling apart.  The only thing that appeared edible was the chile relleno.  The same with the food ordered by the kids.  Very disappointing.  I will no go back here again."}
{"text":"Went tonight with the family for dinner.  Service is below average and has been for years.  The part that really got me was that I ordered fajitas -- with no sour cream.  My wife asks for a side of sour cream.  They charge us for the side.  My son and I ask for more tortillas (as they give you only 2) -- the waiter takes 5 min to bring out the wrong thing, then another 5 before he brings the right tortillas.  Food cold at this point.  They then proceed to charge for extra tortillas.  DON'T NICKEL AND DIME YOUR CUSTOMERS!!!  ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU SCREW UP.  GREAT, PRESIDENT BUSH ATE THERE, WE GET IT.  HE ALSO ATE AT A MILLION OTHER PLACES.  GET  YOUR ACT TOGETHER."}
{"text":"I'm torn between 3 or 4 stars but keeping it generous with 4.   Traditional Mexican food place with older decor. Nothing fancy but it's fun because it's been here forever. I had the green corn tamales with beans and rice and thought it was very good. Fresh, well made, and tasty. Of course the Gold Margarita (with an extra shot on the side) may have influenced my taste buds.   Another reason for the extra star was the fast efficient service. We were a group of 7 and everything went smoothly. Drinks and chips served quickly. All our meals arrived together so we could all start digging in without having to wait for the one delinquent taco platter!   Nice traditional Mexican dining experience. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Awesome no frills Mexican food.  I'm from CA and love to come here every time I visit my parents. The host was super friendly and our server David was great!  Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"This has always been a local favorite. I have been coming here regularly for 18 years believe it or not. My family is hooked on the Green Chili Burro Enchilada style. Yum! If you are looking for some delicious Mexican food that feels authentic, try this place out!"}
{"text":"One of the best tamales I've ever had. My husband's food was great too; I think he had the chicken flauta. This place is a dive, but has great food!"}
{"text":"Everything is cooked from a can. When I go out to eat I expect everything to be home made. The service was terrible as well my pregnant wife choked on a piece of plastic from the canned salsa. The owner said it was a piece from the Chile but fortunately I am not stupid and I cook more home made Mexican food then tee pees. It was plastic not a stem. I do not like being lied to and will not recommend this place to others. At least they comped the meal after I had to tell them I wasn't paying for it."}
{"text":"Worst place I could have ever ate at. Actually I didn't even eat my food. They brought my plate out with very cold rice. Waitress took it back and came right back out with The same plate just replaced The rice. Then I go take a bite of The rice. Most disgusting rice ever. It was dry and parts were still kind of hard, possibly because it was dry. Then I go for The taco on my plate and one side completely separated off The taco, because it was soggy. Then I go to take a bite of The tamale I ordered and not what I asked for. I returned my plate. Also over heard the waitress say our plate sat in the window ready for while.  To say the least a complete disappointment. Also a lot of people that work there were sitting drinking alcohol. I feel that if your are not currently on the clock you should not be in your work shirt or be able to go in and out of the kitchen area. I would never step foot in this establishment ever again."}
{"text":"\"We can say we tried it.\"  That was our reaction when we left. We drive by this place all the time, and it is usually packed, so when we had an open night we decided to see what it was all about.  We had stale chips, and possibly the worst \"house margarita\" in the history of house margaritas. It was more like a guest-house margarita. Maybe the outhouse margarita. My wife had the chimi, and liked it. I had enchiladas, and they were okay.   Oh yeah, and the seats. They are old booths, aren't holding up very well. Mine had a broken spring or something and the guy sitting behind me made me jump everytime he moved, and I think I did the same to him. Quaint seating is one thing - broken is something else.  I did like the home-owned, non-chain feel, but it just wasn't that great."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for as long as I can remember and I absolutely love this place! The chips and salsa is amazing and I love the fact that the salsa actually has a kick to it. The margaritas are always delicious and the service is always great. Whenever I have to go to Phoenix this is definitely the one place I stop by."}
{"text":"Stop here when I'm in town. For the last 40 years I've been visiting cousins here, eating at The Tee Pee. It's never disappointed me . cousins are long gone but the Tee Pee carries on. Nice to know. The rellenos and their chips are still delicious."}
{"text":"We should have listened to the more negative reviews here on the place.  The food was indeed greasy.  We ordered their version of chili relleno and it was the most bizarre way to make it.  One top of three pieces of inadequately spicy chilies was this gigantic eggwhite puff and the plate otherwise was coated with cheese.  The eggwhite did not really complement the chilies.  Would not order this again.   My wife's order of taco was also filled with too much cheese.  We are from Tucson, and this place is sub par compare to the Mexican restaurants we have down in the old pueblo."}
{"text":"Just ate at TeePee, lets see. The place from the ourside looks a bit shady. Inside its dim lit and if you look around, you'll notice it is not the cleanliest. I ordered the chicken enchilada, i figured you cant go wrong with that. As the server brought out the dishes for my coworkers, i noticed the rag that held the hot plate dipped into the cheese as the dish was placed on the table, this happend to two of the dishes. But the waiter was just oblivious. My dish was flooded with cheese, somwhere beneath it be the enchilada. I figure ok, its a bit much on the cheese, no big deal, ill focus on the actual wrapped goods. As I opened up the enchilada, i noticed there was a good size layer of cheese on top of the actual chicken. To be honest, I think I ate three small pieces of bite size chicken bits. The rest was just flooded with cheese. By the end of the meal, i had enough cheese left over to make a happy face for the waiter. Bummer, I should have taken a pic for your enjoyment. Overall, I will never eat here again, there are lots of other restaurants on my list waiting to be discovered. I give TeePee a sad face. I should have listened to my co-workers warning, never eat at a joint that has a drunk bull as their logo."}
{"text":"We went there cuz it was close to Scottsdale Stadium and the airport on the recommendation of a employee at a local business.  It was exactly a she described it: good food [not fabulous] old fashioned diner decor.  We had excellent service from a young man who has worked there 14 years who was the only waitperson on duty until 5:00.  He managed to be quick, efficient AND friendly and did not make us uncomfortable because he was swamped.  Seems like there are many neighborhood regulars.  3.5 stars for me if possible."}
{"text":"Coming from Northern California to Phoenix you'll notice a stark contrast between the Mexican food your used to and the Mexican food in Phoenix, influenced by southwest style and native culture it is unlike any Mexican food I had growing up. Teepee reminds me of home. Always busy, family friendly, quick service! Some of their servers are much friendlier than others, but that place is always packed when I go, so forgiven. The food is so tasty though. I always get a combo plate and switch it up! Their food is the closest to the Mexican food I grew up on."}
{"text":"I just love this place because it's been around so long. It's decent food but nothing to write home about...  I'll keep coming back because it feels like home."}
{"text":"This restaurant offered good, if not great Mexican Food.  Service was flawless, and we got just what I was told I would get.  Some of the best Mexican food I could eat.   Thank You Tee Pee for providing two times in one week superior dining experience for vacationers!  I would come back to Phoenix just to taste the food again!  Until then, Keep on doing what you do. We appreciated it!"}
{"text":"The food is great here, as always.  It is a mom and pop old time establishment where we have gone for years.  However, service has slipped a bit.  We waited about 45 minutes during a slow day for our lunch to be served.  There were only three in our group.  What was irritating was the parking lot.  When it is 105 degrees you don't want to be stepping on roofing tar, having it stick to your shoes and then stick to the floorboards of your car.  Somebody made a huge error in patching the asphalt in the parking lot.  Buckets and buckets of roofing tar were used.  What a mess."}
{"text":"I have been going to Tee Pee Mexican food for years and this is the absolute first time that I have tried there green chile beef burro I can tell you I found a new favorite.  Sorry I didn't take any pictures of it it was just too good to stop"}
{"text":"Quintessential dive-y Mexican restaurant.  My family has been going here for 20 years (gosh, that makes me sound old) and it's just as good as it always was.  Don't expect any frills (like ANY), but do expect some tasty good.  I always get the machaca beef plate and I'm never disappointed.  TIP: if you're going on a weekend, get there early or be prepared to wait!"}
{"text":"I had my first \"on the rocks\" marg just out of high school (down the street) but you have remember the drinking age was 19.    For a while I was going to one of those \"street-corner-out-of-the-styrofoam-to-go\" places and realized for TWO dollars more I could have something that was supposed (and deserved) to be served on a real plate.  Consistency I can attest too for almost 40 years.  Not much in Phoenix lasts that long but something kept me in the neighborhood for this long..."}
{"text":"Food s good after all these years I had chicken soup for my cold and it was good Like the guacamole too"}
{"text":"Dude, the weirdest chile rellenos I have ever seen.  A bed of chile's topped with a meringue and green sauce, WTF?  I am glad that I ordered a burrito and enchilada myself, both of which we good.  I made the burrito the shredded beef, it was good, but not worth the up charge, or special attention that it was to garner.  Margaritas are rather weak.  We were in the area, and I am glad that we stopped in once, my dad has been hearing about this place for sometime, but it was a nice one stop place, and no where near a regular place, or even special occasion joint.  Los Dos Molinos is far superior, and further away than this little place.  The restrooms are cramped little private rooms that are very clean and stocked and have a some character to them.  3.75 Flushes."}
{"text":"This place has been here since 1958, so it has to be good right? Wandered inside on a recent Friday night and it was pretty crowded, but no wait was involved. The menu covers everything from burgers to real Mexican food. The prices are pretty reasonable as well, as my one sour cream cheese/onion enchilada only cost $8 and it came with beans and rice or double rice as was my choice. The rice was really top notch and the enchilada was pretty good after it cooled down a bit. The free chips were above average and the salsa was chunky and a bit spicy. All the pictures on the walls of celebrities are nice to see, but I wonder what that Playboy playmate from the 1980's looks like now."}
{"text":"The food was too greasy and the chips were stale. I asked the waiter about it and he said they only make the chips once a week so that's why they were stale; lame."}
{"text":"Good, but typical."}
{"text":"We have lived in Phoenix for 21 years; somehow Tee Pee never was on our radar. On a whim, we decided to try it. The service was wonderful ; we needed to ask for some guidance on what to order.... our waitress was very honest with us. We loved our fajitas.... the refried beans were flavorful.... the entree portions were fairly large. We know we'll go back to Tee Pee again and again... a great place to go when you want to have a casual night out."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Went there for my first time and food was fresh.   I'm a huge fan of Mexican food & have had a lot but this place is awesome! The service is great & fast but the seating is not quite roomy. Although it didn't stop me from enjoying my food!"}
{"text":"Whenever I'm in Phoenix this is my first and last stop. If you want quality Mexican food, good bar scene and an overall cool place to hang out with good food, the teepee is your place! Fajitas are tasty! Oh and their chips and salsa do not disappoint...which should always be a staple for Mexican food!"}
{"text":"Well I made my way to Tee Pee last night and it was an experience to say the least. I was on the net at work the other day and watched a teaser for some new show that Andrew Zimmern is coming out with. The episode I was watching was shot here in Phoenix at the Tee Pee restaurant. He of course ordered the chile relleno. I thought it looked interesting so I planned a trip to check it out.      My mother and I arrived and walked in and had a seat in one of the booths in the back room. This is where the wheels came off the evening. The booth was ,to say the least, uncomfortable. My mother is only 4'10 and her whole body was under the table. All you could see was her head sticking up and she looked rather unhappy. We then tried another table and found much of the same. I am not a small guy and I was having problems with the fact that the seat was a bit to close to the table for me. We then tried a third table and found the same thing so we just stayed there. Finally a couple left at a table next to us and we moved for the forth time and this was much more comfortable.      I ordered the green chili chimichanga and my mother ordered the machaca burro. They both came out pretty quickly and looked very good but mine was a bit on the small side. My mothers burrito was much larger. I tried my chimi and found the first bite to have a strange flavour.  It was something like a strong sour after taste. Not pleasant. As I ate my way deeper into the chimi it did get much better but still was not the best I had ever had. Biggest complaint was the shell on the chimi was not crispy at all. I am used to a chimi shell, which is deep fried, having a nice crunch to it. This was pretty mushy and soft.     My mother tried her burrito and was very pleased with the flavor. It had a nice soft tortia and the meat looked very nice. I reached over and had a taste and it was very good. If I would have known I would have ordered that instead. We also ordered a chile relleno to go so we would have a chance to give that a try since it looked so interesting on the Zimmern show I had seen. We finished our meals and payed and left taking our football sized relleno with us for later. I arrived home and had to take a bite of the chile relleno. It was NOT GOOD!!!!!! it was nothing but cheese with chiles laying on top with a ton of whipped egg whites over them. No flavour at all, and the texture was just not appealing. I had 3 bites and threw the rest away. That was $9 waisted.     All and all I would not go back to Tee Pee. There are so many mexican places here in Phoenix that kill Tee Pee in flavour and portion size, and they have booths that are much more comfortable."}
{"text":"I love this place. Always crowded and loud , casual, great Mexican food (for Phoenix) at reasonable prices. This food is close to tex-mex which is what I prefer. Can't go wrong with the Tee Pee Special or the Presidential Special. Nice patio out front. Good chips and salsa when you sit down. Cold beer and margaritas. What's not to love?!"}
{"text":"My wife and I love the food especially the nachos yum....BUT I think they need to upgrade the tables....I'm a big guy and I could hardly fit in the booths and anywhere else I fit in fine....then they ask if you want a chair to sit on the edge and you feel like a fat a$$ haha.....so upgrade and I'll come back!!!"}
{"text":"A friend and I ended up here b/c the Vig was too packed, and the Dilly was too dirty. It was Tuesday and there was no room at the bar, and people were waiting to be seated. Our drinks were decent and the bar tender was clever."}
{"text":"Meh indeed. I think this place is over-hyped. The food was...how shall I put this...not amazing...the service was fine but I mean we are in the Southwest for cryin' out loud. There is a Mexican place on every corner...there are better ones out there for sure."}
{"text":"So I finally went out and experienced this valley staple that so many recommended to me.  My thoughts are summed up by the two star yelp description; Meh, I've experienced better.  What am I missing here? This food is not very good.  I guess if you like big portion's I do not), then that would be a positive note for this restaurant.    My companion and I ordered a few different menu items, including the Chile Relleno, a Chimichanga and beef taco.  Let us start with the beef taco.  The appearance actually looked good. Crispy taco shell with colorful lettuce, tomato and cheese all over and the beef was decently cooked.  Unfortunately, the bottom of the taco had broken apart from the amount of oil, which make it hard to eat, but not bad.  The chimichanga was huge and covered with what seemed like three different sauces, and way too much of all three.  The chimi itself was not crunchy and totally lacking in flavor, most of it went un eaten.    I left the Chile Relleno description till the end, because this was nothing short of funny.  I have had Chile Relleno around fifty times in my life, minimum.  Never, ever ever, have I seen a plate of Chile Relleno look like this. You need to picture a football sized shell of some white substance with a plate of melted cheese below it. Seriously, it was bizarre and complete disgusting, dish was left completely untouched.  I am unsure how the kitchen lets a dish leave looking like that, totally revolting.  Anyways, I am on my lonesome on this review, based on the fact there was an hour wait tonight on a Sunday and you cannot even get into the parking lot.  Go figure. I will not be back."}
{"text":"Ok, so I thought I would give this place a tryone more time since everyone raves about it. I will not make that mistake again. I should have just left it alone and stuck to my original opinion... ok, but nothing special. Now I must say my last experience was horrible. To start the water tasted awful and the chips were cold and stale. How can you mess up a cheese crisp, well the Tee Pee did, again cold. My taco was made incorrectly and the chimi my friend got , not so good. I love good ol Mexican food, but this place has missed the mark. Thank god they have nostalgia working in there favor."}
{"text":"This locally own restaurant has been a part of Arizona for as long as my parents can remember.   Our own George W Bush visited this establishment on his stop in Arizona (The booth is immortalized by a plaque and newspaper clippings)   I want so badly to love this place. The decor is adorably kitschy, and full of historical mementos .  The booths are small and cramped, but they made restaurants smaller in those days.   The wait staff is always running, always efficient and very friendly. Even on the busiest of nights.   The food is fair. Nothing spectacular. Chips are usually stale, but they're free. My last visit I had a cheese and onion enchilada and a taco. The shredded beef was very wet and greasy but the flavor was okay.   All in all, I will continue to visit, because I love the vibe. Also their margaritas are good and strong. Maybe I will do better with a burrito?"}
{"text":"So awesome!!!  We flew in from Atlanta,  Georgia. Not sure what to order it all looked so good.   One of the owners,  Jeff, suggested a combo plate with Nana's Chili Relleno, Green Chili Enchilada, a shredded beef Machaca Taco with rice and beans!  It was delicious, the  order was brought quickly on a steaming hot platter...and we had margaritas to top it off!   It was all so yummy!   Suggest you don't miss an opportunity to stop by and have a meal at Tee Pee Mexican Food Restaurant on Indian School Road.  You will find the food to be delicious and the service excellent!"}
{"text":"I was excited about this place after doing a search for \"best chimichanga in Phoenix\" on Google, but it didn't live up to my expectations.  I ordered the carne asada chimi but part of me wonders if that's what I got.  I couldn't taste much of the spices, especially the cumin.  There were also some sauteed onions inside so part of me wonders if I got the fajita chimi on accident.  There just wasn't much taste to the meat which made the chimi average overall.  The rice looked fine, but it had a burnt taste to it.  Maybe something happened with the broth?  I love beans smothered in cheese but there just wasn't much taste to either of them.  After a few minutes on the plate it hardened up and needed to be cut into sections by a fork.  A couple of bright spots....  The salsa is good, both the regular and the hot.  They bring you a massive bowl of chips to snack on.  The waiter, I can't remember his name, was friendly and outgoing.  Also, I tend to like to overall feel of these kinds of places.  Not too fancy and looks old school.  One last thing....  I went there on a Saturday mid-afternoon and the bar section was completely hopping.  I'm not sure what that was about but my guess is that if you're looking for a place to put back a few on a Saturday then try Tee Pee.  I just can't recommend the food."}
{"text":"Reasonably priced, good house margaritas, and delish food! You're given chips & salsa as soon as you sit down.  They were definitely generous on the portions.  Plus, you can get what George Bush got since he ate there in 2004!  I've been twice and will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Everything about TeePee is average. The food is really heavy and usually loaded up with grease. Only a few options for vegetarians (beans are safe, rice is not) and I'm just not crazy about the fare offered. I know it's historic, George W. ate here, etc. Lack of quality outweighs tenure to me."}
{"text":"Great and unusual chile relleno -  an egg white souffle with tasty peppers and cheese layered at the bottom.  excellent tacos and fajitas as well.  if you want great southwest tex-mex this is it."}
{"text":"Pretty great Mexican place! If you are looking for a gigantic burrito that tastes awesome, or the best cheese crisp in town, this place is for you. The machaca \"burro\" is excellent. Everything about this machaca is perfect.  Pros: Delicious Burritos - They're Huge! Fast service and friendly employees Prices are really good Nice, old school atmosphere  Cons: Nope. Can't think of any.  Best For: Anyone, for pretty much any casual occasion. This place is for individuals or families looking for a Mexican restaurant. I would definitely come back any time I could.  Definitely a fabulous Mexican restaurant worth coming to."}
{"text":"The TeePee is a mystery, Of what you ask? The mystery is, Why do people still come here?  The food is average, the margaritas are average, the service is average. The only thing I can say they excel at is the noise level.  There are a hell of a lot better places to get Mexican in Phoenix. I will forgive you if you chose this place over Macayo's or Garcia's, it is a step up from there."}
{"text":"\"Cheap, pretty good tex mex food. Spicy Salsa and great free appetizer to start off the meal.\""}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite Valley destination for standard Mexican food. As soon as you walk in, you can tell it's steeped in Valley tradition...  If you come by when it's not busy, you can sit at \"The President's Table\" which is the table at which President Bush sat when he dined there with Jerry Coangelo, Bob Brenly and Artie Moreno.  If that's taken, ask for \"The Mayor's Table\", where The Morning Mayor Dave Pratt is known to sit when he visits.  Now I'm no fundamentalist, but I still can't deny that \"The Presidential Special\" (two enchiladas, rice and beans) is probably the best traditional Mexican dish I've ever had in Arizona.   Somewhat surprisingly, the shrimp taco is also REALLY good.   If you stop by, make sure you ask for their very friendly owner, Zippy. Ask him to tell you about some celebrity who's come by in the past. His stories alone will make your evening."}
{"text":"This place was crowded, like trying to find a parking spot was hunting for a needle in the haystack! The wait time was not long and the customer service was phenomenal. The food, well the taco shells are not the best, similar to ones like Taco Bell but the meat inside was good.. pros and cons. Beans and rice on point!"}
{"text":"My favorite place for Mexican for 30+ years. Machaca Chimichanga, Sonora Enchiladas(open faced enchiladas) and The Presidential(2 enchiladas, rice and beans) are all favorites."}
{"text":"I have found the the holy grail of Mexican food in Phoenix and Scottsdale, finally!  Absolutely the best Mexican food around hands down.  You can always tell when the place has good food before you even walk in.  The old musty smell of the long past cigarette smoke that still looms and the hard to find entrance to heaven.  Decor is the same as it was back when Bush supposedly came here to eat and the menu still has not adapted to integrate any sort of desert menu to increase profits.  That's ok.  Owners must be doing so well they just do what they like.    This is awesome for those old timers that want to keep the bar area a social gathering for over the hill drinker regulars.   As a suggestion, add some desserts to the menu and make it more of a family establishment.  The bar can stay separate of course.  But the food here is too good to limit to just old has been regulars.    Trust me when I say new generations will appreciate the delicious food served here and the ambience.    Get desserts!!  Bring the kids!  :)"}
{"text":"Ok, so let me preface this by saying, no one likes this place but me, my uncle from Indiana, and the one childhood friend I still have who grew up in Arcadia.  I know, what an endorsement.  It's an institution. It's been around forever. It is not healthy in any way, shape or form. It is fat kid heaven. It is a sour cream, enchilada, lard-loving, cheese explosion, saucy dream of a Mexican dive that I will never stop going to.   This place has lasted for a reason.   P.S. If you want a skinny margarita, you are in the wrong place (although, all you have to do is ask). Why do people not get that most margaritas are a just a shitty mix? Spend the money on the Cadillac and stop being so cheap."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why all the haters.  My wife and I had a GREAT experience here.  We frequent Mexico a lot.  Now, while this isn't the most authentic food, the place is great!!  I love spicy food and the salsa was spicy.  Too hot for my wife to really enjoy, but I loved it.  I usually add habanero to my salsa, but not here.  :)  Food did NOT come out super fast, that's because it's not pre-made and then nuked. (Sorry Drew) But it's great, we had super service and enjoyed the heck out of this place.  It's pretty close to Sky Harbor too.  Fortunately, we didn't know \"W\" ate there beforehand or we might have avoided it.  That being known now, I'd still go back."}
{"text":"Tee Pee has been a weekend family tradition since I was old enough to eat real food, and even dates back to when my dad was growing up! Yep, we're Arcadia natives, that is for sure! Let's be clear, Tee Pee is a dive with good ol' greasy Mexican food, so the 5 stars are based on my love and dedication to this amazing family-owned biz!   We typically meet my dad here on Saturdays around noon for sports, beer, and lunch! We always sit at the bar and have quick + attentive service! I LOVE their chips and salsa. I ALWAYS get a small cheese crisp + guac and Albondigas soup! It is like a Mexican meatball soup. I'm crazy and even order it in the summertime when it is 115 degrees outside. BUT, the dark and cool atmosphere of Tee Pee makes you forget all about the hot sunshine outside.   I know that we'll be back again soon! Thanks for holding a special place in my heart, Tee Pee!!"}
{"text":"Had lunch and some Cadillac Magaritas at the Tee Pee on 04/25/15, and it was excellent. I need to eat here more often"}
{"text":"My favorite local Mexican spot. They are very fast, flavorful, local hot spot. It's not fancy. It's the place you go with your family. They can sometimes be pretty busy, it pays to call ahead and find out the wait."}
{"text":"The teepee is an arcadia neighborhood staple.  If you grew up anywhere around there, you went there as a kid.  It's not the best mexican food in town, but it IS the town.    The sour cream enchiladas are a feast of cheesy fat.  If i could eat them several times a week somehow without getting ginormously fat, i would!    They have killer margaritas... very strong.  The atmosphere is kind of like a dive bar.  I don't think the scottsdale crowd would get the appeal to this place... but it's the first place i go when i get back in town.  The taped up booths and old fashioned menus make me feel at home.    If you want to drink like you grew up going there, try louis' lemonade...  but be prepared to stumble out!"}
{"text":"What's not to love? The TeePee is a great, old-time Phoenix restaurant where the food is hearty, fresh and well prepared, the staff is always friendly and prices are very reasonable. The total absence of corporate glitz and hype is very refreshing these days and makes me feel more like I'm among friends than just another unit served. When I go to the TeePee I know that I'll be treated nicely by the staff, have plenty of time to enjoy my meal and be able to escape the rushed pace of daily life.  It's among my favorite places.  Highly recommend the special chile relleno, but everything is good."}
{"text":"An Arcadia neighborhood classic! Campy, run-down, cheesy-greasy friendly historical funk. But unlike a lot of crapola cheesy-greasy, this is the REAL DEAL for classic, no-frills Tex-Mex. Do not come here for mole and elegant, authentic Mexican classics. Come here for a cold pitcher of beer, rough-around-the-edges and spacey service, funky decor, and THE BEST plate of melted cheese in Phoenix. All kinds of awesome."}
{"text":"This was my second visit. The food is good. Service is OK. The server greets you with a bowl of chips and salsa. A pitcher of water is at the table so you can do self-refills. I had the machaca flauta; it had plenty of guacamole and cheese. The rice and beans are good with the salsa. For lunch, you need to arrive early because it gets crowded. Fortunately, they have a large parking lot. I would come back again."}
{"text":"Good basic Mexican Food.  Nothing fancy and sometimes that is a good thing.  Service is great, prices are reasonable, an the food is exactly what you expect.  Full drink menu that you would expect to get at a basic Mexican restaurant.  When your in the mood for good basic Mexican food this is the place."}
{"text":"If it's good enough George W. Bush it's good enough for you! I love this place and have been coming here since I can remember. They have the best cheese crisp and the bean burro enchilada style is awesome as is the green burro, great salsa as well.It's not fancy and has an old school feel but it's good. Top 10 Mexican food restaurant."}
{"text":"I have a love/hate relationship with Tee Pee. I love their chicken enchiladas, rice, beans and salsa.  The chicken fajita soft taco's that JD gets always look good too. But once I was seriously disappointed by the balloon-boy looking chile relleno thing. Last night we went expecting gooey cheesy goodness and a couple of margs and one of us left with a toothache.  On a whim, JD ordered a mexican pizza with fajita chicken instead of ground beef. It came and looked so good I had to taste it. It tasted good too. I was impressed and things were looking great until Ccc-rack! The pizza had some unexpected metal in it. We told our server who later explained to us that the slicer used to cut the pizza had broken and left behind the rivet that JD tried to eat (?) That just seemed odd to us, and we both left with a bad taste in our mouths. The pizza wasn't on the bill, but it is definitely still on our minds."}
{"text":"The TeePee is good, greasy, satisfying mexican food.  The place is small, the booths are uncomfortable, and the wait can be long, but it is worth it.  my favorite is the lunch special, chicken burro with green or red sauce, rice and beans.  they also recently started serving vegetarian beans for all of you veggies out there."}
{"text":"Nice bar, but otherwise gringo slop. This is amateur hour people. Their food  is a colossal failure. It's no wonder Bush likes to eat here when he is in town. No self respecting Arizonan or Mexican would ever return here for a second gastronomic beating. The beans were crap. The enchiladas were crap. The tacos were ok at best. The salsa wasn't great. There should be a helpline."}
{"text":"Great little Mexican place near 40th and Indian School in Phoenix. Super kitschy location and credible food from traditional Tex-Mex favorites to more authentic Mexican favorites.  Combination fajitas were really delicious - shrimp not overcooked and chicken tender and well seasoned. Cheese crisp was a great appetizer and the chili relleno was spectacular.   Weird that plates are all too hot to touch - really dangerous hot - afraid some of ours were in the oven for a long time.  Food wasn't worse for wear, but weird.  Space is cool, cosy cafeteria-style bankette seating and there's also a small outside patio. Overall this place looks pretty lived-in, but definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"A very important indicator of Mexican food is the beans. Unfortunately, Teepee served up overbroiled, dry beans. A 2nd indicator is the Margaritas. A drink with Patron should have a bit of kick; the bartender had a second chance to get it right - no luck. Caution: very noisy.  Service was excellent. However, there isn't much reason to return given neighborhood competition."}
{"text":"If you're like me, you typically go to restaurants for the atmosphere and food. Tee Pee is hands down the best Mexican food I've had in the Valley, don't let the lack of atmosphere deter you from this great little find."}
{"text":"For casual, authentic and fast Mexican this is it.  It's not the place your hotel will recommend but if you are looking for terrific atmosphere and incredible Mexican food you have to get here."}
{"text":"I'll PASS this place, next time I'm driving by. Between the inattentive, uncaring servers and the definite need for the place to be powerwashed inside, I got the feeling that they assume that they will do fine without you or me. Really just a local dive bar that has too many TV's and serves food to some:  this joint needs to rethink their idea of restauranteurism.  I have eaten here twice (never let a bad experience go unpunished), so when I returned last week, I tried the chile relleno. Having eaten rellenos hundreds of places, the promise of a unique experience intrigued me. It was unique, all right!..... Two chiles laying on top of some cheap american cheese with a Baked Alaska top (eggs whites puffed up  and browned to look like a football) over the whole thing. This was not a relleno, It was a FUMBLE! Maybe the WORST relleno of my life.   Perhaps this is your kind of bar, which is why it got a second star from me, but it doesn't cut it as a restaurant, in my opinion. The photos they provide show a kitchen that seems a lot cleaner than where you eat............ maybe they should keep the food there."}
{"text":"Not a bad place to to eat some mexican in the valley... this place it not super nice but the food is good... if you do to this location you will see alot signed pictures of all the people that have been there...  it is pretty cool...    If you go check out the chile reanllo... it is the craziest presentaion i have ever seen at a mexican place... it is also not too bad... i would go back... the only problem is that there can be a pretty long wait for a table... but i would say it is worth it... the chips are also real good!"}
{"text":"Say what you will, Im kind of digging on the Tee Pee... It looks a bit divey... and the food was so hot I burned my lips off.. but thats not a TP prob, thats a airhead Kimberly problem! The chips are a bit on the staley side.. but I loved the Huevos Rancheros.. the place was packed... good margaritas, good salsa.. good service.. all deserving of my 4..."}
{"text":"Heavy food, reminiscent of the old Mexican / American cuisine with mass amounts of cheese that kills the rest of the dish. And probably just as well."}
{"text":"Went here this past weekend for a Boise State football viewing party and we couldn't have received better service. It was my first time at this restaurant and I had never heard of it so I was somewhat hesitant, but my trepidation was quickly pushed to the side. Apparently the owners have a relationship with the BS coach and did an exceptional job of taking care of all us. To my surprise, they provided us with plenty of free food and drinks, including some nachos that aren't even on the menu, in addition to taking pictures of us and giving us free t-shirts. They were extremely hospitable, the service was fantastic, and the good was great. I will definitely return and recommend others to check this place out."}
{"text":"My daughter and I were in a special order type of mood and the server was super helpful!   The chips and salsa cannot be beat!    This is casual and relaxing. Don't use for a romantic night out.  For delicious food, you are in the right place!"}
{"text":"We tried this place based on our Lyft drivers suggestion. He said it is the favorite of one past president who took us into Iraq war with faulty intelligence. While I like this President, I didn't enjoy the food here. As a matter of fact no one from our 8 person group enjoyed their dish tremendously. Everything was average to good  at best. We tried the fajitas, tacos, enchiladas, tostadas and the salad. All dishes were decent. If you were to try one dish it would be the chicken enchiladas. The shredded chicken is tasty."}
{"text":"Today was my first time back in decades. The food, the setting, the service are still excellent and a real piece of Arizona history. Don't miss this place. The menu is well done and everything well prepared."}
{"text":"Hole in the wall with great food. You can even sit in the same booth where a visiting president sat."}
{"text":"The service was par and the food was far below.  I ordered a chimichanga and it was soggy, yet over cooked.  The salsa was average and the hot sauce was basically tomato sauce with red pepper flakes.  My gf had an enchilada which was average.  I will try it again but as for authentic Mexican I was very much disappointed."}
{"text":"Being in the Phoenix area on business, several locals recommended Tee Pee.  Well, I have had better Mexican in Atlanta. The service was just ok and the munched raved about chimichanga arrived soggy on the bottom, sitting a retried beans and loosing its crispness."}
{"text":"The chips were crisp, the salsa fresh and the beer cold.  What else could you ask for?  Well I love Mexican food and it's really hard to impress me.  TeePee did!  I had the best cheese and onion enchilada ever.  The rice and beans were quite good too.   I still think about that enchilada every day since.  I would date that enchilada if I could."}
{"text":"Came to tee pees to celebrate a birthday party we got a ton of the appetizers and shared them. The nachos and the street tacos are amazing! If you are looking for a fun place and a cool atmosphere then you need to come to tee pees!"}
{"text":"The food is great, it's iconic, but we wish we could get bigger groups to sit together!"}
{"text":"A friend of mine lives near Tee Pee's and seemed to like it a lot so when I saw deal on Groupon I decided to buy one and try it out. I am a major chip person...... if they aren't good then I don't want to eat there and Teepee's chips were acceptable, but not great.   My friend loves the guacamole since they put paprika in it but I did not like the consistency. I got the shrimp & chkn fajitas. Half of my family is Mexican so I know good when I taste it and once again this was somewhere in between. They use a ton of cheese and the portion sizes are huge. Although the food was so-so our waiter was very attentive and did an excellent job. I may come back for a happy hour special one day if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Viva Tee Pee!   Was driving down the road and said \" I gotta try this place\" and I must say what a gem.  Not disappointed at all... The buildings a little rustic but it's a 50 year old establishment , it just leads to the character of the place.  All 3 of our meals were quality and would highly recommend to anyone desiring Mexican food to stop in.    Don't listen to the haters , it's all good!"}
{"text":"I went here for lunch with a few co-workers.  I actually liked the food.  Growing up in San Antonio, I prefer this kind of mexican food: no color only shades of brown, heavy on the cheese, heavy on the salsa.  Wow, now that I write that, I doesnt sound so great... but really, that's what I like.  And that's more or less what I got at Tee Pee's.  So food-wise, it's probably a THREE STAR.  But there were some real drawbacks.  The chips were slightly stale.  It should be a small thing, but you'd think a \"landmark\" restaurant could handle keeping fresh chips.  The decor is dated and cramped.  The old vinyl seats are ugly, but more importantly, they are uncomfortable and very small.  Two adults sitting side-by-side had better be very friendly.  Finally, the service is horrible.  And to me, that is easily the biggest problem.  The waitress constantly left our drinks empty and had to be reminded every time we asked for anything.  In reality, Tee Pee's should be right up my alley.  But their \"we're too busy to worry about the small things\" is a big problem.    I'm not sure they will ever get a second chance with me."}
{"text":"This would have been an easy 4+ star review except for the bar/food server's actions seating people in our seats near the end of the meal while we were in the bathroom.  Saw them on AZ PBS TV show \"Check Please\" (http://www.azpbs.org/checkplease/segments/restaurant.php?id=3206), looked good so thought we would try it.  Arrived during a busy time at 5:30PM and was told it was over a half an hour wait in the restaurant but the bar was open.  Sat in the bar at the counter and we noticed that several other folks were eating at the Bar so she decided we should do the same.    The Latino gentleman behind the bar was quick, attentive, organized, fun, and engaging.  Margaritas with Tortilla chips & Salsa came quickly and we were being taken care of well.  We both ordered the Green Chili Chimichanga and mine arrived slightly over toasted but still tasty.   Guacamole was very good.  Near the end of our meal we got up to use the bathroom and I returned first to find that the bar tender had given up our seats, even though our sunglasses, keys and her personal things were still on the bar.   Would 5 minutes have killed him to let us finish or order dessert?  Total was $43 including tip.  I had to pay from the food server's walk up area as there was no counter space elsewhere and our seats had been taken over. I've never been thrown out of a bar before, but this sure was a rude ending to an otherwise great meal."}
{"text":"Came here with my family of 6 which includes a one year boy. They were very accommodating to our needs. The food comes out hot and they even let me make my dish, The Presidente, all vegetarian. It is yummy classic American/Mexican food. This isn't their fault but it is pretty cramped and we had to sit at two separate tables for all of us to fit. Great Saturday lunch spot- just be ready to nap after because they are very generous with the portions."}
{"text":"Viva Bush! (are we serious?)  A couple months ago I was reading a SkyMail magazine (I should have known) on my way home from a business trip when I came across a section about Phoenix. In there they lauded the traditional staple, Tee Pee. As an avid a&e girl, I made a note and told myself I'd give it a try sometime soon.  I had some friends in town from out east. On their last night they asked to eat mex food one last time before they headed back (I had taken them to Barrio and a few other clutch spots prior to this).  I was trying to think of some place i hadn't been and the Tee Pee review came to mind.   Vamos   The place looks ok enough. Parking was tight but doable. As I entered, I was immediately greeted by two prominently displayed bumper stickers reading Viva Bush! Upon further inspection, I discovered that this was due to W's trip to the restaurant while in the Valley in 04. Woo hoo. I picked up on their sycophant theme with celeb pics from brad in tool time to larry bird...i guess I can't blame them too much...they appear to be very open about the dire need for a little et-esque action.   To preface I have to be honest -- I'm a guac and marg snob. I could live off of them both and thus my reviews tend to get really jaded when either aren't up to par. So, we each had margaritas...weak, mixy tasting, and small. Guac again was weak (not very flavorful), mixy-processed tasting, and small. Not a complete failure...definitely edible...just nothing special.   For my entree, I had the fish tacos which were drenched in grease and barely had anything in them.  But the fish was grilled or broiled (I'm not sure) and not breaded, which was a definite plus. Others ordered a guac tostada, which apparently was decent but not superb. My veg friend ordered the veg plate which was beans, calabistas, and rice. Again, decent nothing too impressive.  So 3 stars because the food was definitely ok and worth eating. But it's not anywhere near authentic, original, or flavorful.   So if you want some American-Mex that screams Viva Bush...this is your spot!"}
{"text":"Teepee is my go-to Mexican place in AZ...it's one of those places that makes me wish I still lived in Phoenix even though I hate the heat there!  I love the retro decor, the food is amazing (green enchiladas, all rice, no garnish, and a flour tortilla is the way to go), the drinks are tasty (and cheap, especially to an LA girl), and the staff is friendly.  I would recommend to anyone looking for delish Mexican food in the valley!"}
{"text":"Want to echo the comments below: Average, unremarkable, greasy. Also kind of old and banged up. Might be a fun place to drink or reminisce for those so inclined."}
{"text":"I love the Tee Pee.  When I lived in Scottsdale as a child, we would frequent here.  You're always bound to see someone famous eating here.  As for the food, I think it's top notch.  I came back about 4 years ago and it was the same, excellent.  Excellent chicken enchiladas, wonderful beans, and their cheese is terrific.  Their tortillas are really tasty and I love their chips and salsa too.  And they have a lively bar at night, you really can't beat the Tee Pee.  During lunch hours, they have cheap, filling lunch specials.  When I'm in Phoenix, I'll be here, for sure."}
{"text":"Super fast service. Waitress never came back for followup. She just dropped off the food. Food was alright, good if you're a local. Not a destination restaurant."}
{"text":"Excellent Mexican food, clean and decent prices for the amount of food.  Will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Take away its storied history, its George W. Bush honorary enchilada, its wall of fame....what do you get?  Just another greasy cheddar cheese enchilada served by a place that makes Mexican food in the old style, before we really knew what Mexican food was.  Having said that, this place is still a landmark and when you are in the mood for the faux Mexican that we all grew up on, you invariably make your way to the Teepee.  It is the reigning king of the Taco, Enchilada, Burrito world that was once our only portal to old Mexico."}
{"text":"Been coming to this place for about 3 years now. We love to sit at the \"presidential table\" haha. The food is always good and the service is always with a smile.   It can be a little slow on the lunch rush but that's to be expected.   All in all this is a great Mexican food restaurant in central Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Food has really gone down hill. The Machaca Taco used to be amazing. You expect a serious taco when they're charging over $5.00 for a single taco. And they used to be that good. Not any more. Mine had a minuscule amount of beef. Essentially a prefab taco shell with no more than 2 ounces of meet. What a disappointment from what they were in the past. Pathetic! Really sad to see. My family and friends have been going to Tee Pee for over 40 years. In a misguided attempt to trim costs, Tee Pee has lost several lifetime customers. Adios"}
{"text":"My husband has been dying to go to this place & we finally went this week! It's a cool little place with indoor & outdoor seating. Free chips & salsa is always a good thing & our food wasn't bad. I had ground beef tacos & a machaca taco. The ground beef wasn't my favorite. The flavor was good, but the texture was weird to me. The machaca taco was delicious tho! My friend had steak fajita quesadilla which she liked, but wasn't blown away by it. My husband had a chimichanga & really enjoyed it. This place is good, but for me, with so many great places nearby I don't know that I'll be back"}
{"text":"Hands down the best sonoran mexican food in the valley."}
{"text":"I like Tee Pee. It's just a basic tacqueria that's been there for a long time and has fairly cheap food and fairly decent table service. You can get a lot of different basic Mexican items, including the Arizona version of a burrito (called a \"burro\" here). Margaritas are a bit watered down and can be ordered by the plastic pitcher, but if you speak up they'll mix in a bit more liquor for you. One warning--the salsa is hot!   Good place to go on a weeknight with some friends. Plenty of families in there, too. I'm guessing there's a wait on the weekends, though I haven't tried."}
{"text":"I don't know what possessed me to eat here.  Maybe I thought if it was good enough for George Dubya, it would be good enough for me.  I expected grease, I expected a lackluster interior, and I expected mediocre food.  I guess it met my expectations.  Because nothing is too good for my husband's wife, he chose the \"presidential\" table for us, complete with the \"hasn't been cleaned since 2004 presidential plaque.\"  Chips and salsa arrived promptly.  The chips were thin and crispy, but far too greasy.  The salsa was not the greatest either.  I ordered a chimichanga deciding it was going to be my last fat-laden meal for at least a month, or a week, whichever comes first, because I wanted the crispy tortilla.  Unfortunately, only the very ends of it were crispy.  The rest was drenched in sour cream and some pretty seriously bad gray-green guacamole which made the whole thing soggy.  What a sad waste of the deep-frying process.  Inside was green chile, made with beef, rather than my favored pork.  It wasn't too bad, but from what spilled out, I could see there was far too much grease in it.  Not that I was expecting healthy here, but this was ridiculous.  I almost didn't eat it, but I did.  Would I come back?  It's not at the top of my list, but if I say no, I'll end up there next week.  I did see they have pretty good drink specials, and the place was quite busy, so someone must like it more than I do."}
{"text":"This place is a Phoenix institution!  I cannot understand people's reviews less than 5 stars...? Not sure what you are ordering...try anything with the machaca, hey-zeus that stuff is amazing! Enchiladas are amazing.  Guess what...machaca enchiladas, effing amazing!  Salsa is way better than most. I am literally salivating thinking about the place.  There's a nice patio space outside too.  A bit loud with street noise, but who cares when the crunch of chips can drown out the sound...Maybe I'm low-maintenance, and I can't imagine what  those low-star reviewers need to be happy, but I absolutely love the place.  The staff are all great people, and a real family business.  I always feel welcome and at home here, and the bartender, Brandon, is a truly good person."}
{"text":"My dad used to eat here all the time when he lived in Phoenix many years ago (the 70s). Recently we were both in Arizona at the same time and we decided to meet for dinner. He suggested here and when I read the online reviews I begged him to reconsider. He countered with the facts that he doesn't trust reviews and many famous people have eaten here (including a president). I really didn't want to go and I made reservations at The Mission (a place several people had recommended to me) with the hopes that I could change his mind. When my old man picked me up he refused to consider The Mission. We ended up at Tee Pee where we were sat near a restroom that I could distinctly smell from our table. The food made me ill and I was sick most of the following day. The irony is not lost on me that this place is called Tee Pee (as in \"toilet paper\")."}
{"text":"I've been here numerous time in the past two years. I've ordered the tacos, tamales, carne asada, and albondigas (to name a few). They were all spot on and very tasty. This establishment has a nice local charm to it and the food matches this charm. It's a bit on the heavy side when you opt for rice/beans with your meal.  This place is also great for kids. We brought our baby and it was fine (it's louder here). I also recommend the house marg on the rocks."}
{"text":"Native Phoenician here. Have been eating at the Tee-Pee for as long as I can remember. One thing that very poignantly stands out is coming back to the Tee-Pee after coming back after living somewhere else for several years. What stands out is the memories of the food. When I left it was good, when I got back it was terrible.   The quality of the food has slid slowly into ho-hum-dom, and then further into what am I paying for? If you've read my profile, you'll notice that I'm HUGE on value. Does what you are getting measure up to what you are paying for? If I know I'm getting 5 Star food and service, I'll pay for it.   It just seems that things at the Tee-Pee have started to change from really being interested in putting out great food for a great price, to playing off the hype that has become the Arcadia neighborhood hotspot places.   It's most disappointing that what was once a favorite hangout, has left me finding other places to get good mexi-chow."}
{"text":"A shiny and sleek interior, an innovative and locally sourced menu, all brought to you by a celebrity chef is everything Tee Pee Mexican Restaurant is not. Instead you get a divey old building, vinyl booths, a ceiling adorned with Christmas tree lights and an old school Tex-Mex menu that's simple, satisfying and inexpensive.  Each table is automatically adorned with a pitcher of ice water and a squirt bottle filled with Tee Pee's own hot sauce. Within moments of being sat into one of the comfy old vinyl booths a large bowl of chips is brought out and accompanied chunky salsa. The chips are humongous, essentially a medium corn tortilla cut in half and deep fried to till crisp. I just wish that on my last visit the humidity from the rain hadn't made the chips more chewy than crunchy. The chunky salsa was bursting with freshness and a slight throat burn more indicative to pepper than chile. Either way, I love built in appetizers.  I'm a cheese crisp fanatic, almost as much as I frenzy over good chicken wings. So I consider myself an expert by way of sheer cheese crisp volume consumed over the course of my lifetime. Having chowed on so many, there have been many great and not great, the later being a greasy flaccid disappointment. So what's great about the Green Chili Strips Cheese Crisp ($6.75) from Tee Pee? The truth in advertising. Pick up a slice and you'll find its truly crisp and rigid being followed by thick ropes of gooey melted cheddar cheese.    Green, smooth and easy to spread, the Guacamole Dip ($5.50) while good was lacking any discernible heat. After all we're at a Mexican food restaurant and shouldn't we deserve a little bit of heat? Next time Ill ask if they can make it spicy.   The Beef Fajita Chimichanga ($11.25) is an ode to everything that is right about fried food. Huge flour tortilla filled with tender well seasoned grilled beef, onions and bell peppers, then rolled and deep fried to delicate crunch. The French fried burrito is covered with the usual suspects including red sauce, lettuce, tomato, cheese, sour cream and a healthy dollop of guacamole. I didn't feel an ounce of guilt eating the entire thing.  What's good Mexican food without a mainstay like Sour Cream Enchiladas ($8.00)? Corn tortillas encircle molten cheddar cheese and sour cream then draped with Tee Pee's savory red sauce. As soon as the plate arrived I could tell that these were going to be good. Oh, by the way, when they say these plates are hot, they aren't kidding. Seriously, do no touch these or you will get burnt, I speak from experience on this one, heed their warning. However, the fieriness from the plate further enhanced the slightly smoky red chile sauce, making it that much more tangy and delicious. Both entrees were served with moist fluffy rice and thick cheesy refried beans.   Show up in shorts and t-shirt, I don't think you can ever be undressed at Tee Pee but that's all part of the charm. Come as your are, even if you get enchilada sauce all over your shirt, no worries, pre-treating will take it right out."}
{"text":"TeePee is okay. It seems like everything on the menu comes out the same. A ton of food (whatever it is you ordered..) with a ton of sauce poured on top, with a ton of rice and beans on the side.  Last time my boyfriend and I went, I ordered the Chicken Fajita Chimi. When it came out, I got instant heartburn just looking at this plate of food I was expected to eat (although that also might have been the result of the white wine and margaritas I had during happy hour). Either way, it was daunting.  I could only finish about 4 bites of my burrito at the restaurant. The good news is, TeePee is one of those places where the leftovers are even better then the original. You heat up everything at the same time, it all turns into a warm, gooey, saucy, cheesy mess and you eat bite after bite indiscriminately on your couch watching reality TV marathons.  It's really best with reality TV marathons."}
{"text":"Great food and service! First time in the area and was recommended by hotel staff. Will definitely stop there again when I pass through!"}
{"text":"Not sure what all the hype is about for this place.....Been here 2 times... Very average.... It seemed similar to food from Del Taco, but on a real plate. Anyone who gives this place 5 Stars, really doesn't know what real Mexican Food is."}
{"text":"my co-workers rave and rave and rave about this place and how \"cool and divey\" it is, so i took my visiting brother there for a mid-week lunch.   it does seem a little divey, but that's only because it's as much as sports bar in the front, and the celings are low and the lighting is low. the service was down-home and friendly, and it was filled with regulars.   our server was nice and friendly and kept our water glasses filled. my brother opted for one of their lunch specials and his plate was massive. he ate so much i thought he would pop. i got the cheese and bean enchilada plate with beans and rice. it was good but honestly, and this isn't meant to be a negative, but it was just similar to a hundred other mexican restaurants i've eaten in here in phoenix.   i would go back except it falls outside my \"radius of convenience\" and i'm trying to bike more and drive less and it's just harder to get to Tee Pee on my bike than the mexican place only a block away from my house.   good food, good service. very popular with locals."}
{"text":"The Tee Pee has been a local family favorite for years. There is also a picture of President  Bush visiting here. The decor is rather simple or plain. The draw is the food. We ordered the enchiladas and chicken burro. The burro was huge and very filling. Try this place."}
{"text":"I got the Combo w/3 choices: chicken enchilada w/red sauce, beef taco (fried), carne asada taco, rice & beans. Modelo Especial draft w/lime. Next time I'll try the Nana's chili relleno for certain. This place is not very fancy, not trendy at all, a little run down, so it was my kinda place. I enjoyed the food, bartender was nice, helpful and attentive. A lot of regulars, they know what you drink, prices are reasonable. I bought a t-shirt and I'll hopefully frequent the Tee Pee as a regular patron going forward."}
{"text":"Out of all the Mexican places I've been to in the Valley, this place has the best enchiladas!  It's not as healthy as some other places but if you are looking for somewhat cheesy and greasy mexican good, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"The drinks were good. And if you scape all the sauce and cheese lumped all over the tamale, it's good too. The chimichanga seemed like it had been made then nuked so it was unrealistically boiling hot in the inside.  I was soooo disappointed as the crowd was large, but the drink was good so maybe that was the draw."}
{"text":"It's frustrating that Mexican food is SO regional in style and flavor. Having lived in Texas for most of my life I am accustomed to Tex-Mex. So naturally, I haven't had much luck finding any Mexican food that reminds me of home. However, of the many restaurants that I have tried here in the valley, this one has been the closest and the best...so far.  The dish that I got could've served two people but the idea was to try a variety . The tamale was very good and the cheese enchilada was surprisingly even better. And being someone who never raves about Mexican rice, it feels a little weird saying that their rice stole the show. It was very good. Overall I was happy with the quality and taste.   I dropped in for lunch on Sunday and it was packed. Luckily there was an open area at the bar, where they had NFL games on 3 or 4 tv's. The bartender was extremely attentive, never letting my coke sit half empty and refilling my chips bowl a couple times, as well. I will return!"}
{"text":"Another classic Arizona spot, and a favorite of locals, and celebrity visitors alike.  Take a peak at all the pictures and signatures on the wall on your way in and you might sit at the President Bush booth!  Despite the famous patrons, it's got a hole in the wall / mom and pop feel, family owned and operated since 1958, friendly but no nonsense service,  and is just good old traditional Mexican food.  Favorites include the tostadas, Nana's Chili Relleno, or Tee Pee Original Chili Relleno Dinner.  Can't beat the price on the specials, there is a reason families have been eating here for four generations!"}
{"text":"Highly recommended by several friends, I found the food to be marginal. Nothing real special here. The service was great, attentive and friendly. The margaritas were excellent though. All in all, not anything I cant  find at my local Macayo's. Just remembered, the bathroom ( Men's) was a mess, also not handicap accessable."}
{"text":"I've had better fajitas, but overall it wasn't bad. The service was very good. Chips and salsa were good and the beer was cold. The only bad part was undercooked fish. One of my friends had the fish taco and as I said it was not cooked. Still cold in the middle. The waiter was very nice and took the meal off the check no questions. I would go back."}
{"text":"I love this place one of the best places to get mexican food in the valley and that is saying a lot! You must try the vegetable burro its so good."}
{"text":"LOVED OUR MEAL! A native Californian, living in north Idaho for the last 12 years was looking forward while visiting Arizona for some real Mexican food! Best ethnic food I've had in years! Thank you"}
{"text":"My wife and I love Tee Pee's, it's nothing AMAZING, but it's always good.  Unfortunately, we won't be visiting this establishment anymore.  We had some friends from out of the country and our their last night we wanted to take them to an inexpensive place with authentic Mexican food.    Our waiter came by and we ordered \"4 margaritas please!\" He replied, \"want to get a pitcher of the GOOOD margaritas?!\" Unified, we replied, \"YES!\"  Well, two \"GOOOD\" pitchers later and we were drunk and ready for the check.  Albeit, the margaritas were really good, but they were not $42 per pitcher good!  Our drink total was $84 and definitely not worth it.  When we asked about the price our waiter said that they offered regular pitchers for $18 or the top shelf (or \"GOOOOD\") margaritas for $42.  We felt deceived and it put a huge damper on our last night with our friends."}
{"text":"The food here isn't that amazing. Not bad, just not really amazing.   BUT  The attitude and service of the staff and owners are AWESOME. Such a warm, friendly, family vibe from everyone there. Including patrons. We love it there, can't beat $3 margaritas and a dog friendly patio.   We are are happy regulars! Love Zip, his lovely wife and the whole \"tee pee\" family!"}
{"text":"I've been dining at Tee Pee since I was too small to sit at the tables.  Such tasty food Mexican food in a family-centered atmosphere.  Many employees have been there years and regular customers abound both at the bar and in the dining room.  Don't miss the museum-like lobby with celebrity pics."}
{"text":"There is so much great Mexican food in Phoenix. Tee Pee does not fall into that category, however. It's not awful, but it's not very good. Mediocre chips and salsa. Edible but disappointing entrees. Non-descript drinks. Blah atmosphere.  Respect that they've been around for so long, but with all the great options in the Arcadia area, they need to step up their game. In the meantime, you can do better elsewhere."}
{"text":"I love this place and every time I get off the plane its the first stop. Good strong margaritas. Killer burritos... I'm in Seattle and I want to get on a plane for Tee Pee and other reasons. :)"}
{"text":"We were urged by a lot of locals to eat here. We have had some amazing Mexican food since moving here. Not so at the Tee Pee.  The tortilla chips were stale. The salsa had cucumbers in it. It was bland. The food tasted old- like it had be reheated 3 times and steam tabled for a while. It was hot but tasted old.  The beans on the tostada were tasteless. The beef in the taco was ridiculously salty. The quality of food was lesser than that of Taco Bell. Greasy.  Not sure why this is a favorite other than nostalgia. They need a menu reboot. Big time. The food just tastes like the cooks are bored. The recipes are tired. If you haven't been eating there since childhood- don't start now. The wait staff is nice. Food came out quickly. Those are the only positives."}
{"text":"I honestly don't understand the reviews for Tee Pee. I have been coming here since my family moved to AZ back in 2002. I moved to LA for 7 years and just moved back and it is still one of my favorites. I get the chicken enchiladas every time. Never been disappointed."}
{"text":"I have lived in Phoenix for many years and had never tried this well known institution. I had lunch there yesterday. This place has been there I think over 50 years. I ordered the individual Mexican Pizza with Beef Machaca. So good, loaded with lots of goodies to include guacamole and sour cream...The place is small and old looking but it adds to the charm. There is a patio outside to eat at also. I remember that President Bush ate here along with many stars. nice and casual, and the prices are very reasonable. great parking too."}
{"text":"One star might be too many. Should have left as soon as I tasted the salsa. The food was bland and sloppy. Looked like the place needed a good steam clean. Might need a city inspection. Seriously..."}
{"text":"I've been hearing about Tee Pee for years; it's considered a Phoenix landmark, I think!  George W Bush has been there afterall!  But it wasn't until my husband purchased a groupon for this place, that I was forced to go check it out.    My quick summary: *chips and salsa - meh, nothing special, kind of stale tasting to be honest *guacamole - nasty *Bud Light - A-OK *Chicken Tostada - decent *House Salad - decent but simple (it's just lettuce and tomato) *Service - friendly and attentive although it did take awhile to get ice water, and when we finally did, we were handed a pitcher and 3 glasses.  I realized it was 3 glasses for the 2 of us because 2 of them were stuck together - classic!  Bottom line: I don't eat Mexican very often, but when I do, I'll likely go elsewhere."}
{"text":"It was delicious as always! Veggie options! Strong (mixed) drinks, good service and nice patio dining."}
{"text":"I just had a shrimp taco and carne asada enchilada that blew my mind. I'm currently in a post delicious meal nirvana/coma. So good."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness 3.5 hour dinner that honestly could have been finished in 2 hours easily. We made reservations and they didn't have a table for us when we got there. When we finally sat down we had to wait 30 minutes just to get drinks in. Finally FINALLY....we order food and drinks and the food comes in and it's just sub par. And then finally we are ready for the bill...we put our cards down, show him how to split it and 45 minutes later he shows  up with the bill. Terrible service and the food wasn't anything to write home about. Won't be back"}
{"text":"Just not good. We saw a show on PBS about it so we thought we would check it out. The food was standard low-end Mexican food. The major problem I had with it was the rice. The flavor reminded me of the smell of medicated dog shampoo. It was gross. Service was slow. Getting our food was slow. Salsa was not good...which sucks because salsa can raise the likability of a place.  Really the only reason I gave them 3 stars was because it was a family run place & I liked the Christmas lights on the ceiling. Unfortunately, for them, we won't be returning."}
{"text":"Not the worst Mexican food on earth, but it might be a contender in a few years.  If you like TexMex, interior Mexico or New Mexican food, you will likely not like this much."}
{"text":"I will give TeePee a couple of stars for having lardless beans and for the weird old-school style of the place (it is a serious throw back to a time that no longer exists), BUT i ordered (in my pre-vegan era) the \"famous\" chiles rellenos and what i got made me want to gag... what they have created is a green chile, flattened, and then covered in some terrible meringue! how in the hell is that a chile relleno?!?  \"Relleno\" means \"Stuffed\" in Spanish, not topped with French meringue!! http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chile_relleno then they put some shredded iceberg on top and give you a side of some sort of mysterious red \"sauce\" that you are supposed to use as a topping.  I am a native Tucsonan who has been eating Texan, Arizonan, New Mexican, Californian and Sonoran Mexican chiles rellenos my entire life and can honestly say these are the worst I've ever had.   this is what Chiles Rellenos normally look like: http://www.roadfood.com/photos/7510.jpg  this is what you get at TeePee: http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1116/862689844_54188a24a1.jpg?v=0  trust me on this one. don't go here for the food. go here to smoke cigarettes, wear copper and purple colored clothing, and drive home in a much much too big car.  I think i ate a Cliff Bar instead."}
{"text":"To be fair I compare every Mexican restaurant to Tia Rosa's, which is more than likely unfair.  I ordered the chili relleno, it was OK. Not what I expected.  It did have a good amount cheese.   The rice was flavorful, but chewy. The beans didn't have flavor to me. The chips where like chips you would buy at the grocery store, not anything really special.    I was really looking forward to this place, I think Tia Rosa's set the bar to high."}
{"text":"Ate here a couple of times. Didn't know they gave you so much food. I ordered Fajitas with a side of guaco and a side of pico de gallo....The bag that I picked up felt like 15 pounds of food.  This was for less than $25.    They forgot my side of guacomole =(...that's $5 of nothing.  I was looking forward to it too.  =(.  They are insanely busy. I think this is a good place to go for drinks or to watch baseball or basketball.  But I would call ahead (like 30 min) to order my food and then take it to go.  The food isn't that good for that long of a wait. That's just my opinion.   If you are hungry or have a big appetite then this is the place to go because you do get a lot of food.  Pres Bush ate here. boo.  I prefer Panchos on Baseline and Central (Clinton ate there =) ) and they give you large portions and it is way cheaper but much much much more tastier.  That's just my opinion...this is coming from a Californian who looooooooooves Mexican food."}
{"text":"Great food! Drinks were a little weak, but at least weren't crazy expensive. Definitely a Phoenix landmark that people need to check out..."}
{"text":"The food is on par with Pedigree dog food (except the cheese crisp, which was delicious).   Wait staff was friendly and helpful.  40% chance you'll need Imodium after eating here.  It's disgusting."}
{"text":"Phoenix is the home of a plethora of Mexican restaurants.   Tee Pee was recommended to me by the young lady who worked the front desk of my hotel.   She called the place a hole-in-the-wall joint but was positive that I would Love It!  She was partially correct!   I visited Tee Pee for lunch and was impressed with the vibe and feel of the restaurant. As you enter the walls are covered in autographed pictures of celebrities who have visited the joint, including former Presidents.   As a Buckeye seldom do I get to experience authentic Mexican including dining with locals. I heard one local proclaim - \"Hey Jose - You are Phoenix's best foreman\"  It was truly enjoyable and extremely authentic.  The lighting was dim but not uncomfortable.  The bar area included numerous TV's with your expected channels.  Sports and News.  They offer a small lunch menu and I ordered the Red / Green Enchillada and was served chips, salsa along with a bottle of some sort of spicy sauce as I waited.  The chips were cold and not at all flavorful.   The salsa was thick and delicious.   The red sauce had a distinct flavor but is hard to describe.  Overall - add a little salt, use the red sauce, eat the chips and don't complain because your expectations are high!    I also asked my waiter for a cup of queso to go with my chips.   I was told they did not have queso, just cheese.  I thought he was just a dull knife so I said okay \"whatever\".   Well - maybe I am the dull knife because the cheese did not arrive.    When my Enchilada arrived so did my cheese - melted all over the red and green sauce and burnt to a crisp.   My lunch was average at best or maybe it was authentic Mexican that this gringo just didn't understand.  None-the-less it was an average lunch but not a place I will return too."}
{"text":"I ate here last night and I was extremely unpleased.  Chips were not good, the salsa was eh, my four carne asada street tacos were horrible, I had to take them back.  The carne asada was not good and there was too much onions, lettuce, tomato, and cheese (like a regular taco).  I could of went to Chipotle or Filibertos and had better food with a lower price tag."}
{"text":"If you are over 60 and love George W Bush, theyn you have found a home. Ok food, but a big deal for older locals."}
{"text":"Okay, so this is a two-fold review.  The green chili chimichanga is one of the top plates in the state.  Almost other-worldly.  The service is very much hit and miss though....sometimes excellent, sometimes really poor.   Still, an institution in the valley and a top spot for great salsa, chimichangas, machaca, and spirits."}
{"text":"Horrible, horrible, horrible.  Went here for lunch with a friend. We were seated on the patio - okay. Waited for service and were approached by a woman who was clearly unhappy. Starting to doubt this decision. Ordered a Sprite and got something that tasted like mold...spigots hadn't been cleaned for some time. We each ordered a taco entrée and that was it...just a taco. Mine was ground beef, cheese and guacamole.  The guac was brown the cheese old and the beef cold.  The food looked like it had sitting around for some time (premade???). This place sucks...dirty, unfriendly, far too expensive for what you receive. Don't bother..."}
{"text":"Margaritas?  How about a glass of lime kool-aid with mezcal instead?  Oh yeah, eat the worm too so you're at least in a position to consume less of the steaming hot mess they bring out on a plate.  What'd you order again anyway?  That's right it all looks the same at this dump.  Melted piles of \"processed cheese food\", the whitest of shredded lettuce you can find and brown or dark brown meat.  Yummmm...  Chips and salsa, you say?  Man, I remember when Chi-Chi's hit my hometown and chips and salsa was something new.  Rewind the track to the 80s when they bring out the chips and salsa but leave the flavor behind.  Maybe that's where the jars of Chi-Chi's salsa went and this place even took the time to add water and wipe the salt off the chips.  Wow!  George W. Bush sat here?  The claim to fame is he ate here and his picture was on the wall near my booth.  The worst President of all time sat at my booth?  Did he make my enchiladas too?  I blame America that this place is still in business.  This place is terrible...  It's possible the sign should say Pete's which is another place to avoid.  I vote to widen Indian School to add two westbound lanes just to put this place out of business.  If you do visit, stop and get some T.P. on your way home."}
{"text":"Service wasn't bad. The pom margarita was ok very light. Chip and salsa mediocre. I had food poisoning from the chicken chimichanga. Will not eat here again. There's a horrible smell coming from the kitchen."}
{"text":"I'm not crazy about Tee Pee.   My parents, however, are. As are, it turns out, most Baby Boomers that grew up in Phoenix.   Once you walk inside, the photos on the wall of famous patrons over the years gives you a snapshot of their (self) important place in Arizona history.   Tee Pee was one of the first places to popularize Mexican food for gringos, from what I gather. Non-mexican families began going out to eat here regularly and Mexican cuisine became part of the Arizonan identity.   Unfortunately, I don't feel like their food holds up in comparison anymore. The authenticity has faded and given way to a new generation of Az-Mex, one that I prefer, if for even reasons of circumstance.   I recommend it for out-of-towners almost as a historical stop but not too much for the food. It certainly isn't bad, if you aren't expecting greatness, but the food won't be what you walk away remembering when you leave."}
{"text":"Worst service and lack of customer service. Will not recommend this place to anyone of my friends. My friend was raving about how good the food was, but lacked in telling us the service is horrible. The food was blah, I have had better Mexican food thing this.."}
{"text":"NOT Mexican food.  #7 came with a pre-formed taco shell filled with ground beef!  If i want that i go to Taco Bell.  I asked for a shredded beef replacement and here it comes again in a pre-formed cold shell filled with soggy meat with bell pepper and onion filler.  Small burro, very bland.  Gringo food.  Beans had no flavor.  Chips were greasy and ran from huge to crumbs and not tasty.  Los Dos Molinos, Ponchos, Popos are much better choices!  In a word, AWFUL!  i signed up for yelp just to report on this restaurant that is getting away with lousy food because of media hype."}
{"text":"I usually don't leave a reviews unless a place gives me a good reason to and I'm sad to say this place did just that.  I was part of a party of 6, when we came in for the first time last night, having heard rave reviews and honestly excited to go this 'very good Mexican food' place and was completely let down by the end of the night. The overall experience was HORRIBLE! Our reservation was for 6pm but two people in our party got stuck in traffic and was late to the party. When we arrived the others had ordered and we quickly ordered from the menu. When ordering, the waiter could barely could understand my questions about the salsa and other menu items. Their mild is not a mild but more like a medium and they don't have any other milder options for you. The waiter was very rude when I asked him for something milder. Then when I was asking questions trying to decide between the two menu items, he acted as if I was inconveniencing by asking them, by asking them. We get our food and all eating having a good time talking and trying to hear in a busy restaurant. Let's just say if you a party of 4 of more you not be able to hear each across the table! Then comes the bill pay time, we all had to way 20 min for him to come back for us to check out! Then when we finally pay, we are just hanging out for another 5 min talking about stuff having a good time. The waiter comes back and stands at our table trying to get us to leave. He slowly keeps clearing the table, even finally taking our not done waters and saying to us \"ok, thank you for coming, have a good night, you can leave now\"   I'm sorry but that is simply NOT good business practice and now the next morning the food is making both of us sick to my stomach and throwing up. I will never to be back."}
{"text":"ugh, this place.   i had an ex-boyfriend who loved this restaurant, so i've eaten here more times than i can count-and let me tell you, this place sucks. straight up. it's gross and dirty inside and the servers always seem like they've got something better to do.  i don't know how this is even a thing, but the chips are always, and i mean always, stale. they have this terrible rubbery taste and the salsa has no flavor.  chips and salsa are kind of my thing, so if you can't get that right it really sours me.  as for food authenticity? no way are you getting that here. they use cheap meat that tastes like it's cooked in a microwave and looks like it too. they claim their chile relleno is \"famous\", but good god have they butchered it.  if you're eating here and you see a puffed up dish that looks like brains going by, there it is. ugh.    i really don't understand why this place is so popular when they have such awful food-you could get a better meal at taco bell. oh, and president bush loves it, so that should tell you everything you need to know."}
{"text":"Went for lunch. Food was very good. Carne Asada burrito had great flavor. The tacos and enchiladas were great. Chips and salsa was good too especially the hotter sauce."}
{"text":"if you are from phx you know about this place. when it is 120 out side it is 65 inside. nobody ever leaves. \"hotel california\" cold beer good food. eat the relleno drink the beer and chill"}
{"text":"chips and salsa are awesome!  the food is just average.  nothing great and nothing horribly bad.  the experience is different.  from the inside it looks and feels very old.  the booths are worn.  it feels very tight inside.  friendly service.  we love going but not the best place.  lol."}
{"text":"Third trip, party of seven, busy as hell, seated and drinking in 15 min. Best chimichanga ever, everyone else was fat, dumb and happy as well."}
{"text":"Great service.  Food is good, but some items are a bit too spicy for kids.  I suggest asking for the enchilada sauce to be dialed back if kids order it.  Salsa is spicy too."}
{"text":"went with a friend last night - short wait for a booth in the bar so we could watch baseball playoffs.  we both ordered machaca chimichangas and they were excellent. Tender tasty beef, good flavor refritos, good guacamole, excellent service, The chips were fresh, homemade, and served with a very good salsa; and we got a second bowl as soon as we asked.  TS had several margaritas and said they were excellent, I had straight Herradura Reposado. I just don't get the Haters on this place - I've been eating here since the early 1980's and the food is always good - some dishes are better than others; some nights are better than others.  That's life in the Big City This is just a neighborhood family restaurant; if you;re looking for artsy decorations, and mouthy iPhone tramps, and hipsters with ironic facial hair, go somewhere else and leave us regulars in peace in our Homie Heaven that's been serving up good Sonoran food for 55 years in the same place from the same family.."}
{"text":"1990 called, and put this place on hold.  The place is chopped up with little spaces every where. looks like 2 maybe 3 patios, but they are completely unused and they look like they have been ignored since April. Enter into a weird space and check in, go through a little opening into a bar, and past that through another 3 foot doorway and find the dining room. The place is very busy so I was shocked to find the smallest restaurant bathroom  ever. In todays world of new sleek uncluttered shinny new restaurants The Tee Pee is just the opposite. Stuff everywhere!!!  I didn't stop in because I wanted a $7 octopus taco and $15 dollar blue margarita I came because I craved good ole Mexican food, you know the kind with shredded lettuce and grated cheese on everything, and the plates so hot you cant touch them and you get warned twice!!!!  BINGO!!! This place is all that and more. It's just like I remember and I haven't been here in 2 decades.  We sat at the bar because on a Friday night there was a wait, and the bar was almost empty, and we like the bar.  Service was swift and super friendly, cold beers on tap, and best of all full service. did I mention the bartender was super friendly, she was!!!.  Dinners arrive and just what I was craving, I had the Tee Pee Special, beef taco, bean tostada and cheese & onion enchilada with rice and beans, It came with plenty of shredded lettuce and grated cheese, and I was warned twice the plate was too hot to touch. My Brothers Fajitas looked a little lack luster, not sizzling and on a regular plate but my brother really liked them. We both liked the ultra fresh chips and salsa, Cold beers and great tea, and for $40.00 plus tip we left completely stuffed and satisfied.  On our way out there was still a wait, friendly thank you's and good bye's and a basket of those starlight mints! There are not enough places like this, but I am sure this place will be around for some time to come.  Old School Mexican food done right, give them a try!"}
{"text":"Tee Pee is pretty expensive compared to other similar restaurants. The food has been ok when I eat in, but I have been consistently disappointed with the takeout from Tee Pee. It is soggy, sloppy and tastes horrible. Today, I tried Manuel's down the street because I finally lost hope that Tee Pee would one day get it right. I ordered the same thing at Manuel's that I typically order at Tee Pee. The takeout was 100% better. Crisp, neat and tasted fantastic. I'd recommend Manuel's over Tee Pee if you're looking for good takeout."}
{"text":"Visiting the area. Was told the food was good.   When you walk in, it seems very promising.   Then, the server greets you and it is just downhill from there.   I ordered a plate of a few things to give it a chance.   Ground beef taco-little taste and very soggy Cheese enchilada- no flavor Carne asada taco- meet was hard as a rock.   Service was slow, waitress lackluster.   They have been around for 40 years. Clearly, they are doing something right, but not when I was there."}
{"text":"I came here last night with some gfs to grab dinner and drinks and watch the Angels game.  I guess I was on a subpar Mexican kick, after hitting up 3 Margaritas for margarita shakers.  The place itself is cute, very old school, and I love the comment on the menu that says no cigar or pipe smoking. My and the girlies went to the bar, because it's playoff time and I need my Angels fix.  The bartender was really nice and friendly, and was doting on us the whole time.  Love being a girl! We started off with chips and salsa, which were just okay.  The salsa tasted very sugary, and was way to sweet for my liking.  The margaritas weren't anything special, as they have the sweet and sour mix flowing for the soda gun. For dinner I got two fried shredded beef tacos.  Definitely no street tacos to be found here.  How sad.  The tacos we big and piled with tons of shredded lettuce and cheese.  Yeah...I'm just guessing this isn't how it's done in Mexico.  Actually, I know that's not how it's done. The portions were huge and I'd already been filling up that sacred real estate in my stomach with booze and chips, so I was only able to finish one taco. I'm glad I stopped there, because I was feeling sick and greasy for the rest of the night.  Definitely not a feeling I enjoy.  So even though the food was priced well and the bartender was awesome, the greasy food and lack of authenticity will stop me from coming back on my own free will."}
{"text":"I finally got around to eating at Tee Pee after driving passed it numerous times.  I guess my body was craving heavy cheesy mexican...yum! I had the beef enchilada with green sauce, rice and beans.  I'll start with the positive: *The plate was straight out of the oven, so piping hot, I love how the cheese gets all crusty when it's cooked :) *The chips and salsa we decent, and they brought a refill when we neared the end of the bowl. *The green sauce was pretty good, but could have been spicier. *The rice was tasty, some of the best I've had at mexican places like this.  Now the bad: *The enchilada had barely any beef in it....literally had to open the tortilla to see if it had any in there at all. *The booths are really old and made of orange vinyl.  Maybe it's part of the decor, but I think it's time for an update. *The server was pretty non-enthusiastic, we still had everything we needed, but a simple smile would have gone a long way!  All in all, it's about what you would expect from a normal mexican place."}
{"text":"Was starving after work so pulled in here for a quick bite to sustain me the rest of the way home. Had the daily special to keep it simple: cheese enchilada,  beef taco, bean tostada.  It was all good. And cheap."}
{"text":"This place has really good Mexican food :) they also make it really fast. Good service. Very happy"}
{"text":"I'm gonna make this simple and then I'll make it complex.  SIMPLE: go to The Tee Pee, order this, specifically: Green Burrito, smothered, enchilada style.  Comes with rice and beans.  Delicious!  I've been to other Mexican restaurants in town, including the vastly overrated Los Dos.  The food at Los Dos was hot...so what?  How hard is it to make something hot?  It's not hard, it's easy.  The trick is to make it TASTE GOOD and then make it hot.  Tee Pee does this.  More flavor.  I'm always preaching, \"MORE FLAVOR\"!  Back to simple/complex...SIMPLE: go to The Tee Pee, order this, specifically: Green Burrito, smothered, enchilada style.  Comes with rice and beans.   COMPLEX: Order the rice and beans on a separate plate and ask for extra green chile SAUCE on the burrito.  Order it for lunch, it's cheaper.    MORE COMPLEX: why is this burrito so good?  Because it's really a two-part burrito.    First part, they take a cut of meat, cube it, and they simmer it in a gravy, like a spicey, delicious brown gravy.  And they simmer it so long it becomes quite tender.  When you or your lovely partner orders a Green Burro, smothered, they spoon this stew, called \"guisada\", into the tortilla.  They roll the burrito , place on the plate and then smother it with green chile sauce (I always say green chile sauce so as not confuse it with actual green chilies) and broil it hot...piping hot.  The \"enchilada style\" I'm sure you know just means melted cheese on top like an enchilada. Like HD...you knew that it was high defintion.  The combination of the stew meat and sauce along with the green chile sauce is ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS.  At lunch, with chips and hot sauce,  $8.95.  and it's either a filling lunch or portioning the beans and rice, it's  1/2 for lunch,  1/2 for dinner.  Love ya lots.  Mean it!"}
{"text":"I don't know why this only has 3 stars!  This is my favorite mexican restaurant in the Phoenix Metro Area. I loved the chile relleno, and my wife loves their chimichangas.  The food was good, staff was always friendly. It is sometimes hard to get into, but it is worth the try at least."}
{"text":"Not new, sleek or fancy but they have THE BEST deep fried machaca tacos...Good salsa and chips (which is another must have for any self respecting Mexican restaurant).  Service is always very good.  Also they do have a patio (nothing fancy) that's a nice place to sit in the more moderate months in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Hells yeah Tee Pee. When I want some Mexican food, this is the kinda place I want to go to. It's divey, it's cheap, and it's good. Also, you should order the Chile Relleno just to look at it and poke it with a fork. It looks like a brain made out of eggs."}
{"text":"Very disappointing. I have been at customer for 45 years. Moved to San Diego 30 years ago and always make TP my stop when I am back in Phoenix. This visit was extremely disappointing. Food was cold bathroom next to the kitchen was loaded with roaches staff just not very friendly ...very very disappointed in the quality and service declining at this location.  Guess it's time to go to the second favorite growing up in Phoenix Manuel's on my future visits."}
{"text":"The place is very old and comfortable, the staff friendly especially the bartenders who were very attentive, the beer was ice cold as well.  The food was average at best.  I ordered the Chili Releno's special and it was not edible, I had to use the chips (also average and mostly stuck together) to scoop out what I wanted to eat.  The peppers were like rubber.  Great bar, but the food is average."}
{"text":"Excellent all around... Loved the old school atmosphere , seated right away (was Mother's Day) nice friendly service ... Texas Margarita was SO good (just wish it was bigger) Finally , BEST Mexican food I've had since moving here from SD .. Big portion (I coulda shared) .. When we got the check I even got a rose for Mother's Day :) the only reason for 4 star is I think the Margaritas could be bigger. Otherwise it's a great place and I WILL be back."}
{"text":"This was the worst Mexican food I've even eaten. The carne asada was fatty and fajitas were all onions and no meat. Horrible food"}
{"text":"Back in the 80's I worked down the street at Old New York and lived across the street at Villa Manana.  I enjoyed coming here with friends and co-workers, sharing pitchers of Margaritas and trying my first Chimichanga.  Fast forward 30+ years and this place is now more of the occasional, sentimental stop.  The chips and salsa are yummy, house $3 Margs are rather tasty compared to many other restaurants house Margaritas.  Listen, I'm really picky about such things.  I don't want syrup and flavor on ice -tasteless, expensive, and lacking that kick that takes the edge off of the day. Lunch was tasty and really satisfied my desire for a taste of the past.  I had the Red Chimichanga, which comes with sour cream AND guacamole.  Other restaurants charge extra but here it's already included.  Two thumbs up. Service was just okay.  Kinda slow but always courteous and professional. Overall a very positive experience. We'll continue to make our visits here at the TeePee part of our random routine."}
{"text":"The Tee Pee is what it is: a neighborhood staple for around 50 years. It's gringo Mexican food, a lot of beef and cheese and grease, and strong drinks. It's not the best in town by a long shot, nor is it the worst. It's just a longtime hole-in-the-wall type of place that's been around for several generations of families who are used to its quirks. The bar room is a great, dark place to while away a hot day, and the tight orange-boothed dining room is straight out of 1960. Service is usually friendly and efficient, and many servers have been there for many years.   I see some reviewers on here complain about the food or atmosphere. I agree the atmosphere is a bit divey and food on many occasions leaves a lot to be desired in taste and quality. Yet I find myself going back over and over, as do lots and lots of other people. You know, maybe you just have to live in the area to \"get it?\""}
{"text":"We had Tee Pee cater our wedding reception party everything was spectacular. We had close to 300 people and the food was amazing.  We have been receiving calls from guests saying how great the food was and who catered. I will use Tee Pee to cater future events and recommend them to others."}
{"text":"Where do I start? Bad smell as you walked in, bad service, water pitcher just sitting on the table (who knows how long it has been sitting there) and took us forever to get our food. Ordered the beef temale and there was barely any beef in it."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I recently ate at Tee Pee as he knew I had been there before and I now live close!  It's known to be authentic and the food was definitelty tasty and served REALLY hot.  I really need to bring my Dad here, he wants it burns-your-mouth hot.  The server was super nice.  I would say the seating seems a little outdated, but no biggie.  On a Tuesday night I was surprised by the number of people sitting outside having a few beers, seems like a good spot to hang out if that's what you're looking for!"}
{"text":"Being from CO I have struggled to find a place that mirrors the kind of Mexican food I am used to.  This place had a really unique salsa that hit just the spot.  The food was well made and the sauces were delicious!  I love the feel of the restaurant as well.  It's been around for awhile and Tee Pee does a great job of embracing its history.  The only way to make it better for my husband and I was to have a few spicy dishes on the menu.  We love spice and there wasn't anything to order to satisfy that on the menu but overall we enjoyed it!"}
{"text":"Uuuuugggghhhhhh....cheese..and..... eggs............. Eggs and cheese......... Went here on a Friday night because it's talked about a lot by my coworkers, and there is always a line out the door. Got seated quickly somehow --by the time we left, the wait was nearly 45 minutes-- got our water and chips/salsa. Pedestrian chips and salsa and I ate too many as usual waiting. Everything on the menu looked just like a menu at Everyman's Mexican restaurant. I am always drawn to the 'house special' or 'specialties of the house' or 'chef's specials' or 'House specials of the chef'. Somehow I always think of an old Mexican lady in the kitchen fighting back tears of nostalgia from younger days in Olde Meheeko when she sees that someone as brave as me has ordered a family favorite. (No no no Jeffro, it is just not so.) In this case, it was the chile relleno. I'm a big fan of these chiles stuffed with plain cheese then battered and fried. I should have noticed the slight rise in the waitresses eyebrow when I made my choice audible, or the sudden silence as patrons ushered their children close and nefarious men went for their sidearms. Back in the kitchen, the cooks certainly chuckled and shrugged their shoulders in a combination of silky knowing and territorial pissing. This is our Special a la casa, and you will be surprised that you can be liking it!! Soon others will come!!!! What arrived at the table seemed like a mistake. This is not food -it is a sacrifice. A large head-sized, head/brain-looking mound of food.  \"What is this?\" I asked the waitress. She told me it is a special way of preparing the chile and that I would find the tasty morsel somewhere near the bottom of the football-sized mound of eggy souffle. I put my fork in expecting a gasping escape of air and a seconds-later reasonable sized dinner. No. If anything, it got larger (that's what she said). I went for it, but like Shackleton at the pole, I was stuck  20 minutes later. With my spouse finishing her enchiladas, I was still less than 1/3 into the meal and forever sworn from chile rellenos. The eggs alone must have skinnied a flock of chickens, the cheese gave Wisconsin a shudder, and the paltry pale anemic chilles resting in the cellar of the mess were no longer in my future as energy and waste product -I had had enough! Giving up and stating so left me feeling free like a recovering alcoholic taking the first step. There is some British research which shows that wild rabbits relax sometimes for the first time in their lives just before death when finally caught by a circling hawk. They no longer live in fear. I no longer live in fear of the TeePee--- I have been caught by the Chile Relleno. Stay hungry my friends, but order a la carte."}
{"text":"FRIENDS DONT let friends eat at tee pee.  I take it all back. THIS is the worst Mexican joint in Phoenix. And that dubyuh ate here elevates it to one star. He probably loved it. Why do you think it's called Tex mex?  \"Green sauce\" was this dirty water with floating spice leaves. UGH. Rice typically too much pepper, tomatoes not fresh, salsa not fresh, low-grade cheese blech.  Tables too small and on top of each other. First-generation mini blinds saggy, bent, filthy and old. Dingy wall kitsch includes glowy virgin, fake and faded plastic greenery. Add to it screaming children who at some point seem to be trying to outscream each other and you've got the essence of the ambiance which is Tee Pee.  Service is very friendly and staff is dedicated to keeping the dinner moving. If only the food were edible and the surroundings a bit fresher."}
{"text":"When I visit Phoenix, its mexican food or bust. A friend recommended this place to me so off we went.  I am a fan of alcoholic beverages, so a few margaritas before dinner seemed about right.  I was not a huge fan of the margaritas... way too sweet for my liking. But i came here for the food:  The enchilada was fantastic. I also had the tacos which were relatively small but very good flavor. We went toward closing time so we were one of the only tables there.   The chimichanga for me was the best item on the menu. The guacamole seemed fresh and made in house (didnt confirm that) and the flavors were poppin'.  One of the better mexican restaurants i went to while visiting Phoenix. I would definately return."}
{"text":"Tee Pee has amazing food. My dad is friends with the owner, and he is extremely kind :). The salsa is authentic, and AMAZING. I wish I knew how to make it. Whenever I come here, I order an off-menu item, which is delicious. Even a president came here and loved the food! I love this place and will keep on coming here :)"}
{"text":"I went for dinner and sat in the back room. The place was packed. They seem very popular.   The frozen margarita tasted excellent and packed quite a punch. The food was a bit of a let down. I ordered steak and shrimp fajitas. The shrimp were alright while the beef was chewy and I had to hunt for the steak among all the onions and peppers. The rice and beans were unremarkable. The tortilla chips were good but the salsa was bland.   Overall, the margarita was great, but the food was nothing special. Average tasting at best. There are more than enough other Mexican restaurants competing in Phoenix to say I probably won't go back here."}
{"text":"I haven't been here in nine years.  And the food was every bit as good now as it was back then. It is hands down, the best Mexican I have ever had. The cheeses, the sauces, the flavours are awesome. I haven't had anything from there I didn't like.   I'd like to share with my girlfriend, but it's so good, I just tell her about mine and finish it all."}
{"text":"I have been to Tee Pee three times and keep going back. Its a little pricey and crowded but a good dive-like Mexican food place for dine-in. I am surprised how many low ratings they have on Yelp, maybe people were expecting something fancy? TRY THE CHEESEBURGER. I know, I know, why would you get a burger at a Mexican food joint? But it's HUGE and really good."}
{"text":"According to Yelp, three stars is \"A-OK\" and that's exactly what this place is, OK. This place is the embodiment of okay.   I have relatives in Phoenix and my wife and I treated them to an early dinner at this place when we came to visit. According to my cousin, this place has been around forever... restaurant longevity is impressive, the food here however, is not.  My wife was craving guacamole (she always does) and it was bland and a bit watery. The enchiladas were almost good and the re-fried beans were fairly well seasoned. They were served super hot, which is a good thing in my opinion.   The service was just below average. The staff was nice enough, but a bit slow and not as attentive as is necessary when you have a table full of people with refillable beverages. Hello! It's 110 degrees outside, of course we want refills on our icy drinks!  Next time in Phoenix I doubt I will end up here again, but if I did, I'm sure it would be okay... just okay, okay?"}
{"text":"The Tee Pee's been around since the 1950's and there's a reason why. Their dishes are some of the best in the valley in my opinion. Not all of them, but certainly their stuffed chile rellenos and green chile dishes.   One of their boastful claims is how former President GHW Bush visited on at least one occasion, evidenced by their naming a menu item in his honor;  'The President's Plate'.  This leads me to wonder if Bush was laid-up the next day with a severe case of red-ass, and if that led to any world war-type events.  I know the day after my birthday celebration I was shittin' razor blades, and god help anyone who came in contact with me that day. So I can see where Bush might be all;  \"Oh yeah, Cheney? Well I'll show that piece o' shit Saddam what swift American justice looks like.  Someone get me a red button to push, STAT!!! Oh, and wet wipes too-somebody PLEASE get me some wet wipes-fast!  \"I'll teach Saddam Hussein a lesson he won't forget anytime soon.\"  Anyway, if you like Sonoran style Mexican food, but more importantly, hot Mexican, try Tee Pee."}
{"text":"We go here sometimes when the boy is craving something homey Mexican.   It's not my favorite place because I'm not a huge Mexican fan, but boyfriend likes it a lot and claims they have good food for him. I like that they are kind of divey and everyone is nice and accommodating.   I usually get some Americanized version of Mexican and boyfriend is obsessed with burritos and everything. I can't remember the name of what I had but it's usually chicken with cream cheese. It's pretty good, not great. Boyfriend always clears his plate- clean plate club!   I like their margaritas and generally like going there for drinks and some apps or something small. We will always go back since oh friend loves it but because I am not a huge Mexican fan I won't go here in my own (nothing against you guys it's just my personal taste)."}
{"text":"Love this place. Great food and great service . Combo plates can feed two and the price is very reasonable."}
{"text":"I hate this place. It's just completely crappy Mexican food and everything I despise about the preponderance of people who honestly think they know how to run a restaurant and make authentic cuisine. It's uninspired, bland, and perfect for anyone from out of town who thinks Taco Bell is indigenous. Please. Go elsewhere. It's also dingy, the waitstaff is bored, and the margaritas are weak."}
{"text":"We found nothing to like about TeePee. We tried take out twice because it was near work. We were not impressed either time. So far we've tried the machaca taco, cheese enchilada, green chili burro and chicken burro. Everything including both salsas were lacking in flavor and the chips were stale, like last night's or last week's. Overall, the food tasted like something you'd get at a fast food joint like Taco Bell. Actually, Taco Bell is better.   The service was not so hot either. Neither time did they have our order ready when we arrived even though we had called ahead and been given a pick up time. We will definately NOT be going there again. BTW - we tried their famous chile relleno a few years back and were equally unimpressed. It was just a whole lot of whipped egg whites with a little green chili and ordinary cheese. The sauce was okay but not enough to try again. Don't bother going."}
{"text":"Just average food, not really prepared very well with not so good service and dirty tasting water."}
{"text":"Tee Pee was one of the first places I went out to eat as a freshman at ASU in 2002 and I'm still going back to this day.  My favorite is their chimichanga.  The prices aren't great but this meal comes with a load of sour cream, guacamole, and chips & salsa and is delicious.  It's an older building and the booths are anything but comfortable but the service and food are great.  They also have a bar attached to the restaurant and speedy take-out service if you don't feel like dining in.  Their small parking lot is often full but it shows how good their food is.  I have never had to wait for more than a few minutes for a spot and there is street parking if the lot is full."}
{"text":"OMG!! Finally some AWESOME MEXICAN IN THE AZ!!!!! Great Food, Wonderful Bartender, Anthony!! Forgot to take before pix bcz I was \" Hangray\"  Will def be back my friends!!!!"}
{"text":"fair to poor at best.   It has the classic 1970's and earlier Mexican restaurant feel to it, but, the food is lacking the same flare.    The food is more typical of Tex mex than anything you'd expect in Arizona.   If your looking for a classic Mexican restaurant Pedro's still has both the atmosphere and the food.    Overall I can't say I wont go back, but, it's just kind of OK.   Sadly Phoenix as a whole seems to have this issue, where much of the Mexican restaurants are just OK, with a few, very few, standouts like Pedro's or Carolina's.    If you want actual Sonoran food, got me, I have yet to find anyplace here though venturing further south on I-10 will lead you to greater concentrations."}
{"text":"I've never understood why this place is always busy.  The flavors just aren't there----it's sort of Mexican food that works in a pinch but never delivers superb recipes.  The service has always been fantastic----they train the staff really well.  George Bush ate here and you can order what he ordered----it's a menu item combo....."}
{"text":"Solid place. Love the cheesecrisp and the flauta with machaca. It's  greasy but good. The last time.the waiter was this guy who seemed very cranky... well whatever I didn't go to make friends"}
{"text":"Perhaps I had too high of expectations, but Tee Pee is no bueno. The only saving grace was the salsa, spicy and delicious. I ordered a bean and cheese burrito, enchilada style with extra garnish. The plate i was given spent way too much time under the broiler and the garnish (roughly chopped lettuce) was was wilted by the time it got to the table. The enchilada sauce was pretty bland, the beans runny and an overall grease taste superseded any other flavors.   Aside from the food the booths are really uncomfortable. Maybe we should have sat in the restaurant area in stead of the bar, but looking around all the booths seemed about the same - lumpy lump. Meh."}
{"text":"This place was amazing the food was so yummy and the chips and salsa amazing ..Its a casual dining place you can tell its been around for a long time and that's whats good about it. It was packed when me and my husband went but that's how it is there all the time. People love real food and a real dining experience. Its not a big place but I think its worth it even if its small spot. The enchildas are to die for."}
{"text":"I have been eating at this restaurant my whole life. Literally. I was weaned on TeePee  Tonight was horrible at best. Service sucked. Waiter cupped my drink with his hand...took forever to bring us our check and never cleared our plates during the 20 minute wait for our check..  The food was tolerable. Too much for what you get..a side of beans for $3.75?  Seriously?    It will be months if ever before we go back. So sad."}
{"text":"They make their own chips here and they are delicous. I got my order to go and they gave me a big sackful, yum.  I dropped by late nite and everyone at the bar was hammered so it was really funny waiting for the to go order...the people watching in this place is excellent. The bartenders are very polite, its a friendly neighborHOOD place"}
{"text":"This is an okay neighborhood mexican food spot.  I've been here a dozen times or so, and it's just okay.  Always an upbeat vibe at this place since it's a popular neighborhood spot, but the food it the type you say \"uhh, probably won't come back here for a while.\"  Pricing is reasonable for what you get and the service is what you'd expect.  I'll go back, but it's not a place I crave."}
{"text":"This place should be listed under great local dive bar. Friendly service, cold beer, sports on the TV. As for the Mexican food? Just because it's in a store bought taco shell and there is rice and beans next to them does not make it Mexican food"}
{"text":"We had a great waiter. The experience ended there. We had the Deluxe Mexican Pizza for Two. Very skimpy on the ingredients based on a prior experience with the same item about a year ago. When we asked about dessert, we were told there was none. Also this restaurants one great claim to fame is that several years ago, a US President had eaten there. This once top notch Mexican has joined the dozens of mediocre ones in Phoenix not worth wasting your money in."}
{"text":"Tee Pee hasn't changed in more than 50 years, which makes them the most authentic Old Phoenix-style mexican food in the Valley.  I think all they've done is keep the place clean.  I took my son there recently.  It was just like when my dad used to take me to his favorite mexican spots that were all over town back then.  Tee Pee is the only one left.  Even more important than the nostalgia is the great food - fresh, hot chips, cold beer, and tasty red chile wrapped in a tortilla and covered in red sauce.  My son loved it and so did I."}
{"text":"I live next door to the TeePee. I've only lived here a year but I've fallen in love with the place. The service is hit or miss, the chips are at times stale, but it's a neighborhood staple. I don't go out to eat to nitpick everything apart in order to leave a scathing yelp review. I go out to enjoy myself. Go to TeePee with plenty of time, enjoy the greasy Mexican food and cheap margaritas, and keep the stick outta your ass. Otherwise don't come here. That way there's a booth for me."}
{"text":"Dont waste your time or money. Garbage food ... this place is a good dive bar at best. I cant believe they are still open."}
{"text":"Ive seriously been thinking about  Tee Pee's nachos since eating here Saturday night.  We ordered the chile rellanos and did not touch it because we were too busy cleaning the plate of nachos!  The margaritas were alright, but the service was phenomenal, everyone was super friendly.  Did I mention how great the nachos were?"}
{"text":"\"Have you ever had the chile relleno at Tee Pee?\"   Our server crouched down by our table to get eye level with the friend who'd ordered it. She had not. None of us had.   \"So it's a bit different,\" he explained. Something about 6 egg whites and an egg yolk. Something about half a basketball. She went ahead and ordered it anyway. Only our server and the pictures (I'll post one) can decently describe it. But he had it right on the nose.  Around the table, we had enchiladas (the Presidential Special that George W. Bush ate when he visited - holla!), some (very good) pepper beef thing recommended by the server, and the chile relleno.   Everyone left stuffed, well-treated (Portland, Oregon has NOTHING on Arizona for polite and attentive service), and generally entertained. Mostly on account of the basketball dish, and the signed celebrity photos everywhere.  Tee Pee is what our Phoenix hostess calls a hole-in-the-wall, but it's the kind of hole that leaves you filled to the brim. So there's that."}
{"text":"I agree with PS, way overrated.  And you'd think after all the years and the money this place makes it would refurbish the booth seats--they seem like the same since the 80's!  Salsa flavor was off, something missing like an herb, epazote?, and the chips, maybe its the GMO corn used to produce them, they just don't taste real.  The margarita was so acidic that by the second sip I couldn't drink anymore.  Service is also very complacent.  Cute little chile tepin bush in the planter next to the front door."}
{"text":"Nice little Mexican place with good and authentic food. Lots of parking and very good service."}
{"text":"The worst Mexican food I have ever tasted.  One drink and two places of cheese smothered something with no taste or flavoring at all.  $32.00.  The parking lot is full and can't imagine who is going there.  Just awful.  Nothing edible.  Do clients \"just not know: WHAT MEXICAN FOOD IS !!!!!!! WARNING..DON'T DO IT."}
{"text":"Classic old school hole in the wall mexican food.  This place is an Arcadia staple and has fantastic mex. This is not for dieting. Eat the chips, eat the cheese crisps, eat the speciality plates. Everything here is good.   Great place to grab a beer, eat some chips and salsa, and watch a game with friends."}
{"text":"Best chile relleno, hands down. Margaritas are fantastic. Family-owned since day one."}
{"text":"Very average at best.  Lots of history in this place,  but I don't know what all the buzz is about.   There are just to many much better alternatives."}
{"text":"I love TeePee. The atomosphere in the restaurant is authentic and fun, and the food is killer. I love the chicken enchiladas with rice and beans...so delicious! Service is always good, chips and salsa brought out are a major plus, and I always leave full and happy! Definitely would reccomend to anyone."}
{"text":"I started going to TeePee in 1972 and, having moved away many, many years ago, when I visit Phoenix, I alway go back and, while others may complain about the decor, I get to step back in time. I used to go there for lunch while in high school. I loved the hamburger for 55 cents at the time. If you have a HUGE appetite, order the nachos.  I love the hot sauce in the ketchup bottle. I decided I wanted to have some sent to my house. $60 shipping and it wasn't the same so it must be a \"walk down memory lane\" thing. I still love it when I eat there. The margaritas are great. Ever since GW was a customer there, I do stay as far away from that booth as I can. I'd lose my appetite if I had to look at his picture (really, the only negative but what are the owners going to do? Say no? Kick him out?)  I hope they keep the same decor. It wouldn't be the same if it were to be redecorated.  My spouse, who did not grow up in Phoenix, likes the food. We always stay at the Phoenician but dine, at least once, at Tee Pee."}
{"text":"If you're a native you'll enjoy this Mexican restaurant hotspot. If you are from out of town you might not get it.  For some reason in Arizona, these less aestheticly pleasing restaurants serve great Mexican food.  I get the same thing every time and it never gets old... chimi machaca...dam it's good!"}
{"text":"I went to The Tee Pee last night for dinner and it was a great experience. I ordered the Original Tee Pee Special (one ground beef taco, one cheese enchilada, and one bean torta) and let me tell you, it was delicious!! I had a hard time finishing just half of my plate, but for 9 bucks it was worth it. The chips were good, and the salsa had the perfect amount of spice. And even though we went out to eat a little bit late, around 8 pm, the place was still packed. The waitress was really nice and everything came out quick and hot. Next time, I'll have to try the margaritas.  Overall, if you want some good, cheap Mexican, give The Tee Pee a shot."}
{"text":"Not impressed with the food the rellenos were not cooked right and the cheese inside of it was a clump of hard cheese not authentic  and we had to move tables because of a roach on the wall service was good and gave us a discount for inconvenience."}
{"text":"I guess Tee Pee is something of a neighborhood institution. It's been around a while, and it looks that way too. My husband and I shared a plate of steak and shrimp fajitas for lunch around 3pm on a weekday, along with a couple of drinks at happy hour prices. The food here is standardized Mexican-American to the max, but our meal tasted well-prepared and we left feeling pretty stuffed. especially after an additional bowl of chips and spicy salsa. Tee Pee seems like the kind of place where people would go to drink and eat, in that order. Happy hour prices make this an inexpensive place to drink, particularly for that neighborhood."}
{"text":"I came here after spending a month in Mexico. I'm pretty sure that any restaurant (especially one bragging about George W.'s trip there) could even come close to even a taco stand south of the border.  However, after a few weak-ish margaritas were in me (the pitchers are great, but have a lot of ice, and are kind of spendy), I didn't mind the noise or the extremely cramped quarters (I don't even know how the waiters are able to serve having to constantly zig-zag between people).  The portions are generous for the price, but it's obviously more Tex-Mex than the real thing."}
{"text":"My boyfriends parents suggested we all go here. We live a few blocks away n never heard of it but agreed to go. It was quick to get seated and the server was great. Food came out at a good time and everyone enjoyed their food. The chips were good, salsa just alright. I had the chicken flautas w rice and beans and it was freaking delicious!!! Seating and parking were a little cramped but not really an issue. Would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Meh. It is just OK. Nothing to write home about and WAY overhyped. Don't really care how many celebrities have eaten there."}
{"text":"There are quite a few good Mexican Restaurants in Phoenix, and we happened upon one today after church.  Don't judge this place by it's name (Tee Pee) or by the looks or even the 50's look.  But judge it by the incredible food.  The staple of many places are the chips and salsa.  How about both home made?!? The chips were light and crispy, the salsa very tasty with a really nice kick.  In our group of people (6 from our NOMADS group) there was only one complaint.  The portions were very big.  One couple had taco salads, one chicken and one beef.  Of course the 'edible' bowl light, crispy, and not greasy.  The chicken and the beef perfectly seasoned.  My wife and another couple had egg dishes which were cooked to perfection.  They also said the rice and beans were spot on.  I had an enchilada with steak and cheese that was incredible.  Usually the steak in these dishes is pretty tough, but not this one!  Outstanding flavor and very tender.  The red sauce was excellent as was the cheese on top.  Definitely a go-to place!"}
{"text":"Seemed likea locals' place, and it came recommended by a friend who lived in Phoenix. Lots of seating between the bar and restaurant and we were seated quickly. Sort of kitschy decor, with red lights. Friendly staff. Quick service, and really quick food. The restaurant cleared out before 10pm. Chili relent was alright. Chicken enchiladas weren't the best I've had--the chicken was chunks rather than shredded, so it didn't crumble in your mouth, and was a little more difficult to eat. Nothing amazing about the flavor. Very generous servings, and very reasonable prices. It's right down the road from the tamp online place, but maybe don't do what we did and feed your face then go run and jump around."}
{"text":"If you want to know what the real core of Phoenix--and I am not talking about the extreme East LA suburb it's become in the last 15 years--is all about, you need to experience the Tee Pee.  The food is Mexican in the same way that Pat Boone singing \"Tutti Fruitti\" is rock n' roll or Justin Timberlake is an actor, but that's to be expected. TeePee offers you their take on the GringoMex genre and does it well, with mountains of cheese piled atop mildly spiced traditionals like enchiladas and hard tacos, complete with sides of refried beans and rice crusted over by spending a bit too much time under the salamander. The chips are obviously made in the restaurant because they are too greasy to have travelled far. You pay a bit more than would ordinarily seem appropriate for this level of cuisine, but then there's the show.  And the show--on weekend nights, at least--is a parade of dapper, vigorous men in their 50's and 60's who have the appearance of scratch golfers, or at least the clothes for it.  They are accompanied either by one of two types of women: Those about the same age who look like they spend a good bit of time at the hair salon and getting rhinestones custom-embedded into jeans that actually fit their butts, or younger ones with great make-up and pneumatic breasts. Together they float on a cloud of real-estate development money, ferried to the place in various standard-Scottsdale-issue Lexuses Acuras and BMW's. Jocular phrases are bandied about by the tanned multitudes: Trips to Hawaii, facelifts, scapegrace kids being sent to military schools.  And all of this happens in a building that probably started out as a private home at one point, has been added on to over the decades, and still features formica tabletops, painted concrete floors, and vinyl booths.  So go for the show. You can eat anywhere."}
{"text":"I had a friend recommend this place and decided to check it out and it was flat out the Best Chili Relleno I've ever tasted!!!  It came with some spanish sauce that I put over my rice and i Loved it!!!  I book marked this place on my GPS and iPhone and I shall return!!!  Also, the service was amazing too.  I tipped 30 percent and I still think it came out to less than 20.00!!!  This dish was huge and I couldn't eat it all.  I wish they had this place in Los Angeles.  I will return for sure on my next business trip to Phoenix!!!"}
{"text":"Tee Pee is an old, out of date, time forgot, slice of Mexican food heaven. This is where you get the real stuff folks, not some fancy pants food network interpretation of a foie gras tamale flambe. Their salsa is perfect and the divey decor is muy authentica."}
{"text":"If I could I would give The TeePee  0-Stars My nana would always tell me, I would know a good Mexican Restaurant if there were any Mexican customers eating there.....That being said, I have not been to the Tee Pee for over 15 years I grew up in the area.  I remembered it as being really good food like Ponchos( on south central ) Carolinas, Ritos, La flora, Don Jose, Rositas,those types of restaurants. I was in for a shock. Stale Chips, Bland Salsa, PRECOOKED STORE BOUGHT TACO BELL TYPE TACO SHELLS, Beans needed salt and flavor, and I dont know what the hell was in the ground meat tacos it looked like chopped up olives in the meat? GROSS, and the machaca meat was soggy.  Everything we ordered was just really really Bad! I will never ever eat there again and I am going to tell all my family and friends this place has really really changed for the worst!"}
{"text":"Reviewing Mexican Food Restaurants in Phoenix is a little like sports talk radio folks trying to compare boxers.  There are so many differences.  How do you compare a boxer in the heavy weight division to a boxer who fights in the welter weight division?   How do you compare a light weight to a super-light weight? It's hard.  and it's difficult to do with Mexican Restaurants as well.  When attempting to talk about boxing there is a term people like to use, \"Pound for Pound\", meaning if they weighed the same, this boxer would be superior.    \"Pound for Pound\" the Tee Pee is my favorite Mexican Resturant in the Valley.  Sure, there is a place in Scottsdale that has Green Corn Tamales that are to die for.  LOS DOS, in South Phoenix makes some killer dishes with Hatch Chilles.  But overall if I could only eat at one Mexican food place the rest of my life The Tee Pee would be it.   The Green Chile Burros are excellent.  The Margs are fantastic and everyone I have ever taken there loves the Salsa.  I especially like the Cheese Crisps and when ever I go there I just ask for the daily special, which they have been serving for like 50 years.  A Taco, Enchilada, Tostada combo.  Wonderful.  Check out the Tee Pee, a family run restaurant who is serious about their food."}
{"text":"Very good Mexican food. The chips were thin and warm salsa just enough kick. The place is very old and family owned. I would keep this place on my list to go to."}
{"text":"Came here around brunch time and ordered the breakfast burrito with shredded chicken. It was flavorful and authentic! Also ordered a couple margaritas and a couple Micheladas (Michelob and Clamato juice) during the meal which complemeted the Mexican flavors nicely! I will be going back on my next visit to Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Excellent enchiladas and tacos, great margaritas.  Best Mexican food in PHX.  Don't let the ambiance fool u."}
{"text":"Well, Rebecca was a very nice waitress and very attentive. Went on Father's Day and we couldn't have a high chair for my 18 month old daughter because the plates are hot so we put her in a booster seat. Very unsafe contraption. They don't lock onto the table and what 18 month old stays still? So I was unhappy with that and had to hold onto her the entire time. The food was not disgusting but not the greatest. Definitely not worth what we paid. So all in all, we probably won't come back."}
{"text":"Food was some of the best mexican I've ever eaten, expecially the chicken enchiladas.  The atmosphere was very cramped, and the torn vinyl booths were very disappointing.  I would go back for the food."}
{"text":"Atmosphere: If you order out the first time you try TeePee, the experience is probably wasted.  Dive or no, the atmosphere at TeePee is part of the experience.  It's sort of Mod meets taco stand meets dive bar-- and I can't explain why that's a good combo but, imho, it is.  It's also dimly lit and the bar area is full of little Christmas lights that make for a great casual date.  However, that being said, I live close enough to order takeout whenever I've had that sort of bad day that needs Mexican food in decent quantities    The food: Albeit a little unhealthy and definitely Tex-mex rather than Mexican and pretty standard fare in that regard, this place is just ultimately satisfying.  Order the beef burro.  It's a must.  I don't think you can love this place as well if you don't.  The chile is perfect- I like the red and the green equally well, just depending on mood.  I'd second the opinions about the rice- it's really inexplicably good.  The chips, yeah, probably greasy but GOOD.  It's all greasy and good.  Don't eat here regularly- it will kill you.  Eat here when you need delicious, satisfying, comfort food and a pretty-cheap Dos Equis.    Service- I've always loved it but had one slow experience.  It's a hit and miss but I usually go during less-busy hours to avoid the crowds that can sometimes congregate.    The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is that it's not really authentic Mexican, if that's what you're looking for and the dive vibe may turn some people off.  I personally love it."}
{"text":"Meh.  I had the feeling when I got inside of Tee Pee it'd be meh, and I walked out feeling meh (but full).  Had the fish tacos (plate looked bigger than it was, mostly lettuce and tomato, but the fish was decent), and the burro enchilada style (OVERLY saucy / salty and cheesy...like it was DUNKED in sauce, which to me, when i get a \"wet\" burrito, is usually not the case, with rice/beans afterthought).   I'd say this place is more TEX-MEX than mexican. The food is good, but what keeps people here is the portion size and in your face flavor of the enchilada style burrito."}
{"text":"Love this place!  The food is consistently delicious, the service is always quick and polite, and it is very reasonable.  We come here at least once a week and it is one of my favorites in the Arcadia neighborhood.  There is a reason it has been around for years, it's fantastic! :)"}
{"text":"This time I made sure I ordered right. Got the Presidential Special (2 cheese and onion enchiladas with rice and beans) and OH MY GOODNESS was it amazing. Their enchilada sauce is delicious.. Sweet and savory.   We sat at the bar to catch some of the NFL game on and noticed a lot of regulars.. I'm a bit jealous that a lot of these people seemed to live within walking distance.   Will definitely return (again and again)!"}
{"text":"Had a reservation but waited over 40 minutes. Good food overall but the relleno wasn't cooked."}
{"text":"How hard is it to make a bean burrito? You'd think not hard. But, trust me, don't EVER order Tee Pee food for delivery. It was horrible. So sad, because I love the actual place and when I've gone there, the food is good. They do HORRIBLE food to go. We had to throw away a $60 dinner tonight. It was inedible."}
{"text":"The service was really good. Attentive server, quickly seated at a busy time. Sat in the Presidential booth. Food was boring and the chips were stale. Taco shells were like preformed and the taco Meat looked taco bell. Cocktail was good but how could a shot of tequila be bad?  Would probably not go back. Great location so a shame the food is meh. Drury"}
{"text":"Great little mexican restaurant. I had the special and it was really good. My boyfriend had the street tacos and they were huge! Also, great food for a great price. The atmosphere was also really nice and the outside patio is a cool spot to sit. Look forward to coming back here!"}
{"text":"It is really an Old place with outdated Decor . Seating in booths which are worn .  Waitress are very friendly With ok drinks .  Cadillac was kinda watered down .  We ordered Chille rellenos which were very unusual . They had no egg batter on it just fried Chille with cheese in it ,, as if they had no eggs left to make Rellenos .  Chips were stale and The salsa was very watery with no taste .  One star for friendly service"}
{"text":"I wish there were 10 stars.    The TeePee is as good as it gets..why?  Because they have the best bar in Scottsdale/PHX!   Brandon is one of the bartenders and he is AWESOME!     If you don't go.. you'll never know!"}
{"text":"This was our first and last time at this restaurant. We had to wait 45 minutes for our food to make it to the table. With the waiter saying every now and then, it's coming soon. After that long wait, the food was just mediocre at best. Wasn't worth a 15 min wait let alone 45 minutes. It was definitely a disappointment."}
{"text":"This place is SO overrated. Everyone always raves about the authenticity of this restaurant and that its a Phoenix Gem - far from it. I'm okay with the orange vinyl seats and the 70s vibe - no problem, you don't have to be fancy to get my vote. This review is based only on the fact that the food is awful. My chips are always stale. The salsa is from a can and the food is always \"okay\" and I leave feeling gross and wondering \"why did I eat that?\"   I have no idea why this place gets so much credit."}
{"text":"i love this place.  crispy taco's.  machaca burrito's.  killer rice and beans.  if you're looking for a trendy upscale mexican place - this is not it.  if you're looking for a place for a marghi in a super dark bar on hot summer day - run to this place!  You wont be disappointed."}
{"text":"We are never in Phoenix for more than 24 hours without stopping at this world class Mexican restaurant. Where to start? Cheese crisps - for some reason they don't seem to exist outside of Arizona. Green corn tamales to die for. Chimichanga the size of a football. Guacamole is absolutely the best. We've been coming here since the 1970's. There was a time in the 1980s when they showed up in a guidebook and became too trendy, so we'd just have to take out. Now they're back to being a fine neighborhood spot."}
{"text":"I've lived in Phoenix and Scottsdale my entire life, and I can say that this is by far my favorite mexican food place. Their red chili burro is the best I've had anywhere in the U.S.  Their only real competition (La Tolteca) is no longer in business, so this is truly worth whatever commute you have to make to get here."}
{"text":"On a busy holiday (Cinco de Mayo) they exceeded. Been a while since there last and menu seemed fresher. Good veggie options."}
{"text":"Man of man this place is gooodd - I hurt when I leave from eating their awesome beef tacos, these are from god.  They deep fry them and the beans are cheesy perfection.  So if your trying to lose weight or looking for healthy, not this place, this is the place where you sin. Red cheese enchiladas hit the spot!    The service is great and the prices are low, of course the building could be better.  Great for pick up also."}
{"text":"Plates came out extremely hot, not sure why, there were only  a few people in the restaurant,not sure if they were stuck in the oven or what.  Beans had a crusty edge, rice was crispy.  I think tacos are pretty standard everywhere. My tacos and my sons fell apart, had to eat the tacos with a fork, I have never had to do that, they tasted good but the whole meal was just off.  There was a weird watery mess with my daughters chile relleno, and it wasn't fried.  I would not return or recommend."}
{"text":"Tee Pee is what you'll need after eating at this place. Yes they have larger portions and it's cheap, however my pork green chili looked like canned cat food and my rice was burnt and under cooked at the same time. The inside of the restaurant needs to be updated. All around not a good experience. Save your money and go to another Mexican place."}
{"text":"This used to be one of my top 10 spots-and a first when I wanted Mexican Food. Unfortunately-the food is inconsistent and I can't depend on it to always be delish. I usually order the deep fried Machaca tacos- but of late they come out soggy and disappointing. I also wish they had better chips-I don't need a huge fried tortilla-I want bite sized crunchy goodness.  I have frequented the TeePee since I was a little girl-love the nostalgia but not the up and down food quality."}
{"text":"Ok, I started out my first experience at Tee Pee's thinking this review was going to be not one of my favorites to write. I don't like to complain and as we waited to be seated, I just opened myself up to this famous local gem. I mean, there's a reason it's packed and everyone talks about it, and well, as you may already know or will know upon entering the building - GW Bush ate here so...whatever that does for you. Anywho - the place feels dive-y but it has it's charm. Reminds of places I loved as a kid. But it appeared clean, so I'm good.   We waited awhile, but used the time to look at their menu on Yelp and decide so we didn't hold up the table too long. Sat, had the soggy chips too (as we saw other reviews said, and yeah, we were bummed). But chips are free, not gonna complain - we still ate em - whatever. But yeah - the food was bomb. I get it now. I had the Chicken Burrito and he had the Cheese Enchiladas. Great prices too for what you got, even the pitcher of classic margaritas that we split was only like $9 - dang. I definitely want to come back try some other dishes. We went to another local [Mexican] restaurant the following night that is favorited by locals but is [nicer] and more expensive - but hated it and wished we had just gone back to Tee Pee's (if that says anything to ya [ahem-Ticoz-ahem])."}
{"text":"Best laid back bar in town.  Pleasant vibe and good clientele.  Grab a beer and a taco and rest easy in the middle of busy Phoenix."}
{"text":"Solid Mexican fare and decent margaritas make TeePee a worthwhile stop if you're in the neighborhood.   This place has been around since the 50s, and the decor shows it. Not in a bad way, mind you, as it is clean and well preserved.  Service is always prompt, and they do a good job of keeping the chips/salsa refilled. On that note, chips are warm and salted just right, but the salsa rates a \"just okay\".  I really enjoy coming here for their cheese crisps and margs. Simple fare, I know, but it makes me happy.  The rest of their fare is decent, though I can't say i have a \"must have\" dish here, though I do enjoy their tacos and 'changas.  All in all, a solid place for Mexican food.  Cheers! RS"}
{"text":"For less than half the money, you can go half a block down to Los Cerritos (or frankly, Filibertos, or Juliobertos, or just about anywhere)  and get take-out that is about a million times better.   HOWEVER, if you want a sit down experience, Teepee is great if you have out of town relatives that think the only spices that exist are salt and pepper, and you'd like to take them out to a local restaurant. The food is meh. Nothing more to be said."}
{"text":"This place has some of the best Mexican food I have had in quite some time, really cool place with great drinks and even better food, highly recommend to anyone who enjoys Mexican food in the slightest."}
{"text":"Had always heard this place was a Phoenix landmark and wanted to try it! The food was awful! It was slop with no flavor and the service was even worse!  Won't come back, that's for sure!"}
{"text":"This is my pick for the best Mexican food in the valley. I've been coming here since I first came to PHX, in '98. The only caveat is that you must either be OK with sitting in a cramped booth or visit during off-peak hours. The chips and salsa are my \"Best of the Valley\". Plus, the faded steer leaning against a cactus logo is a fave. I actually rocked the shirt during college."}
{"text":"Best frozen strawberry margarita I've ever had. Awesome food and atmosphere...great for watching a gsme"}
{"text":"Not a good Mexican restaurant. Waited to be sat, then waited 15 minutes for a waiter to approach our table when the restaurant was not busy. Tables all around us (who were sat after us), ate and paid before we were even given our food. Not to mention when we did get the food, it was lukewarm. We had to ask for our check which then took him over 5 minutes and multiple walk-bys before it was brought back to us.   The street tacos are not street tacos - do not get them! And our fajitas were small, not hot enough, and had barely any meat on the plate!  Get it together!  Worst service I've had in Phoenix."}
{"text":"OK, the margs were good, but eating in the bar is a no go!  I don't know, but I thought service would be better in the bar. Perhaps it was the tiny table, or the noise, or the smell of an old restaurant needing a face lift. The restroom was out of paper towels and NOT handicap accessible, so PLEASE, let's get an update, expand, and get the chip machine working, or whatever you need to make them taste fresher."}
{"text":"Margaritas by the pitcher were very good.  And strong.  The taco and enchilada combo were very solid.  The chips were never empty and oh so tasty.  I'm not sure why this place got bashed so hard either.  The Presidential table was just across the way from us, but didn't glow or anything.  The prices were reasonable, but everything in Phoenix was reasonably priced.  Then again, I was drinking for three hours straight at the baseball game right before coming here.  Nah, the food was good anyway."}
{"text":"Great old school Sonoran style Mexican food. Has been here since the 60's and it is an institution in the Phoenix area. Great food great service and very reasonably priced"}
{"text":"Homestyle mexican food nothing fancy but tasty. Not too pricey. The steak meat in fajitas was kinda chewy but not bad .Salsa and guac are good. Generous portions. Full bar. Waiters are friendly and helpful. Wait for food is long but does get packed for dinners. Even then wait for table is usually never more than 10-15 minutes when I've been. No huge tables for groups but I see all different size parties in there all the time."}
{"text":"Food is serviceable to good (love their chips and salsa, beans taste like they're made from scratch and not out of a can, garnishes freshly cut)...  Service and atmosphere are great though and keep me coming back..  The weekday bartender is really friendly and I like having a couple of drinks with lunch at the bar.  I'm sure there's more authentic Mexican food out there but this place is really good for what it is."}
{"text":"Always consistent in my opinion. We always have the cheese crisp with green chili's and since you can't find old time ground beef tacos barely anymore, this has become my go to. They're delicious. The hot sauce and chips are great, service is always fantastic. We just love it here! Also, the tamales were awesome as well. There's a great selection of different things so anyone can find something awesome on the menu. Plus, it's a Phoenix staple so you gotta try it."}
{"text":"Might have been an off night, but food and service was not great. Server was very slow. Plates were obviously left under a heat lamp for quite a while, because the food was baked onto them and they were scorching hot. Food also did not come out as ordered. Guacamole and chips weren't really very good even.  The sauce on the enchiladas tasted like it was thickened with corn starch and looked bad. I won't say what it resembled. Doubtful I will return."}
{"text":"This is the place that you go to eat the gooey, cheese covered, Mexican food that we all crave at one time or another. I am a huge fan of the thin chips and salsa with a classic margarita and they do it just right. Really staples that too many places mess up. It's not fancy, but its filling and gives you the flavors that you expect to bite into."}
{"text":"Great family owned tradition (thank you for not selling out & keeping going w/next generation) cuz would have stopped going if other ownership deal had done thru & that would have been a shame. Ps new signs a bit too much & brite"}
{"text":"A big thank you to Rebecca for taking care of us this evening.  She was attentive as well as cute! .  Can't think of much more at the moment except that the food was very good and plenty of it.  I cleaned my plate so I'm ready for a siesta now!    The water is bad, ginger ale was flat but the food was still pretty good."}
{"text":"tourist  trap...typical fake american  mexican food, chips, salsa, too much rice and beans..this was a hot place to go back in the 70's but is outdated and there are better places."}
{"text":"This was my second go-round here at Tee Pee Mexican Food, and this time wasn't that much different. I realize that this is a historical venue and has been around for a very long time. Great. The wait at lunchtime on a weekend before Christmas was not too bad. Our wait staff was quick and friendly. The salsa was very flavorful, but the bowl of chips (while hot) were some of the smallest and most broken-up chips we have ever seen. My green corn tamale came cold. Yes, cold. And the rice and beans were average. Hubby's carne asada burrito was better than my tamale but it wouldn't take much to get there. If you're desperate, come for the salsa and margaritas or a cold beer. But, that's about it."}
{"text":"This place reminds me of a push up bra.   A lot of hype and build up only to find just boobs underneath. Or in this case, JUST Mexican food. I mean... The food is good. Like all Mexican food places. It's all cooked by Mexicans so how Much better can one place be over another?   Tiny tables. Loud as hell. Dated decor. Decent value on the food unless you ask for a side of sour cream. HOLY BALLS!! $2.75 for a side of sour cream?! Really!!!?   I don't give a rats ass if every president that's still burning oxygen has eaten there... It really is like...\"meh\" if you ask me."}
{"text":"I think this restaurant's day has come and gone.  My margarita was cold. Yes, that is all I can say about it. It was served in a small wine glass filled to the brim with ice.  A very small amount of average margarita mix. The salsa they initially brought us was bland. Really the whole meal lacked flavor. The service was okay, although our waiter forgot our guacamole. He brought it after we asked for it again. It ended up being the best thing about our dinner. Overall this place needs to kick it up a notch."}
{"text":"We were referred by our hotel, while staying overnight in Phoenix.  They did not steer us wrong.  My wife had an incredible tamale, best she has had, and I had an out of this world chilli relleno.  It was not deep fried like most mexican restaurants, large pepper, fire grilled, and just mouth watering taste.  The decor is not new, which is what we like in a restaurant.  Its been around for about 50+ years, and that tells you they do things right."}
{"text":"I love Mexican food, and am always on the hunt for another place to try. Oddly, I heard about Tee Pee via a news article when John McCain was in town -- apparently it's his fave place to eat in PHX.   But it's Mexican food so off I went. Even though the place was hoppin' on a very rainy afternoon, I got a seat fairly quickly. The place is the epitome of \"hole-in-the-wall\" and \"divey\", but the food was awesome! I got a chimichanga and had the chips and salsa, which were all good. The service was pretty good. The place was loud, so I'm not sure that I'd recommend it for a date.   Parking is tight, especially if they're busy. And it turns out I've driven by it on Indian School several times but had somehow overlooked it."}
{"text":"The food sorta tasted okay, but it was made from horrible crappy ingredients. I couldn't finish because the cheese they used made me nauseous after a few bites. I just couldn't chew it anymore while thinking about what it was going to do to my insides. I felt like if I stuck some on my arm, it would be absorbed by my skin and instantly turned into fat and an artery clog.   Let me back up though - the parking lot is a crowded mess where you can pretty much assume your car is going to get dented by another car door. How about some wider spaces and one person has to park on the street? After that, you walk into a dark dungeon where a 9 month pregnant girl directs you through some sort of dark bar into some hideously decorated brighter room with booths stolen from an IHOP that burned down in the 80s.   The table and seats were filthy and greasy and if someone sits behind you, you share opposite sides of a seatback - which is a little too intimate for me...   The margaritas are small and not very powerful or particularly tasty or memorable. The food in general was pretty greasy. The chips and salsa were average. The prices were pretty steep considering what you're getting. The service was decent I suppose, but I felt like I was being served by scary grade school lunch ladies.   I won't be going back any time soon. I left more on my plate than I ate... I also left wanting to puke up what I did consume and start lunch over somewhere good. This food would've been appreciated a little more if the cost was about 1/3 of what it was. It still wouldn't have been good though.  This place seemed pretty authentic to me - it's not like authentic = good... Real Mexican food is shitty - cheap ingredients and too much grease and fat. It's an authentic shitty Mexican food restaurant. Go eat somewhere else."}
{"text":"Delicious food, amazing service.. Definitely can't live without teepee! The house margarita just gets better and better!"}
{"text":"Tee Pee Mexican Restaurant has been around for as long as I can remember where even a US President has dined there.  Ordered the Deep Fried Chimichanga with Carna Asada, Rice and Refried Beans and my wife had the Beef Tamale and an open face Cheese Quesadilla.  Good size Chimichanga and surprised by it being served \"wet\" with enchilada sauce over the top. Also came with guacamole and sour cream. Rice was slightly on the dry side and the refried beans with cheese over it was nice and warm where I usually dip the chips into. The Chimichanga had a generous amount of meat which I again ordered with Carna Asada. I generally like shredded beef but wanted to try something a little different. Was a nice change.  The quesadilla was not as crispy as expecting but was okay and I had a bite of my wife's beef tamale which was pretty good also.  Restaurant was busy for a Sunday afternoon but service was still not an issue.  Old landmark restaurant that still serves up some decent food for good prices."}
{"text":"I loved this place! They were so nice and the food was delicious. Service is great and my margarita was awesome!"}
{"text":"Habitat of the rare Phoenix native...  and actually pretty good.  I was pleasantly surprised.  I ordered some sort of veggie burrito.  It was stuffed with fresh grilled veggies.  Very tasty.  If you are in search of local flavor, give it a try.  It's hopping in the evening.  Good people watching."}
{"text":"I visited a couple times about 25 years ago, when my future wife was infatuated with one of the bartenders. TeePee seemed reasonably satisfying back then and I cant decide if tastes have changed that much or the food has objectively fallen off a cliff.   It may be a little of both.   Table service was friendly but inattentive, if that makes sense.  Decor is Flintstones meets Happy Days on the Oregon Trail. Or something.  Which would be fun....if the food was edible.  Prices run a buck or two higher than many Mexican chains; again, reasonable only if the food was better. Or even as good, as BajaFresh, Taco Bell or Chipotle.   In this industry, there's a thin line between venerable charm and past- its-prime trap, and if you insist on lousy ingredients and dont bother to ask customers how they want their heuvos cooked, then even if your front hostess is a doll, you're on the wrong side of that line."}
{"text":"Nice place to relax, have a margarita, and eat some ok food."}
