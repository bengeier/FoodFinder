{"text":"walking into a new place, I'm hoping for the best & that it is not terrible,  but expect avg.  
my experience was the best, nice clean place, nicest people run the place, and of course the food, the food lead me to write this reveiw oh and the price. I got their ribs with 2 sides I usually get Indian side, I haven't tried anything else on the menu cause I'm hooked on their ribs.   and their prices- I expected to pay a lot more."}

One Friday night my wife didn't feel like cooking and we were all in the mood for something good and while on Facebook she stumbled upon Kitchen 28's page and after looking at the pictures we made our way to Plum. 

Kitchen 28 in located in a small strip mall right off of Golden Mile Highway. Upon entering we were greeted and seated by one of the owners. She immediately brought us menus and took our drinks orders. We went with Mango juice which was delicious! 

Unfortunately we made the mistake of going on a Friday night close to closing time and they were out of a few items we had a taste for but what we did have was still amazing! Next time we will go at either a earlier time or earlier in the week to make sure what we want is available.

They offer everything! Soups, salads, sandwiches, burgers, wings, ribs, Vegetarian dishes, Indian Food and desserts. There is also a kids menu for the little ones. Everything is cooked to order so you may have to wait a little bit for your food but it is totally worth the wait!

After studying the menu I chose the Kitchen 28 Burger which features two patties, Mozzarella, bacon, fries egg and lettuce and tomato. It was huge and delicious! The beef was perfectly seasoned and cooked. Definitely one of the best burgers I have ever had. The fries were great as well. Crispy on the outside and soft and warm on the inside. 

Our daughter got wing dings and curly fries and my wife got the Fish Sandwich which consists of fried Tilapia topped with cheese. They both loved their food as well.

One thing I can say about Kitchen 28 is that the prices are more than fair as you get a lot of food for the money. 

Be sure to follow Kitchen 28 Inc. on Facebook and Instagram. I wish this husband and wife team the best and will be back often."}
