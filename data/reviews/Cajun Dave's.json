{"text":"Meh......I was disappointed in my first and probably only visit to Cajun Dave's. I ordered the blackened mahi mahi tacos. There was one tiny slice of fish on a heap of over-dressed coleslaw per taco.  I would not recommend them.  My friends ordered the jambalaya and hamburger.  Nothing was great and portions are small for the price.  I can eat a ton of other places in Kent and be happier.  Sorry!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place for a while. It is attached to Water Street Tavern (aka Glory Days) in downtown Kent. My friends and I all ordered the BBQ platter for $9. It is the Friday night special that comes with the chef's choice meat (ours was smoked turkey breast), pulled pork, fries, coleslaw, and cornbread.

Everything was good, not great. All of us had the same complaints:  the pulled pork was cold, the turkey would have been better with some BBQ sauce, and the overall presentation was lacking.  However, we all enjoyed the meal. I'll go back to try something else."}
{"text":"This is hands-down our favorite comfort food in Kent.  Excellent quality, freshly prepared, homemade, home cooking.  Yes, you have to sit at the Water Street Tavern, if you want to \"eat in.\"  It's ok - they're family friendly, we've brought our preschooler with us as long as it's early enough, and we've seen other kids there too.  The food is not fancy, and it's served on plastic plates, paper trays, and occasionally a pizza pan.  But it is SO good and so reasonably priced that you won't care.  (Or you could get take out, if you do.)  Be sure to go when the smoker's parked out front, because the specials are amazing.  But even their regular menu is worth it - we've liked everything we've tried, but our favorites are the pulled pork po boys, the crazy dave's fries (french fries with beef drippings, horseradish sauce and who knows what else, so good), and the cobb salad.  Go: enjoy."}
{"text":"Cajun Dave's, how are you so delicious?  Nestled there next door to Water Street Tavern, you don't even have a real restaurant for me to come into, but I love you anyway.  You and your delicious fries.  And the pizza.  How I love your pizza.  Let's be best friends.

Cajun Dave's is a bit unusual.  I'm not sure you can actually call it a restaurant.  You can't actually go into the place.  You can get your food in three ways: call and pick it up from their window, order from the window, or go into Water Street Tavern and order it from that window.  Whatever way you choose, you should go.  You wouldn't think it, but it's actually one of the better places to get some late-night grub in Kent.

I'm both a pizza snob and a french fry snob, and Cajun Dave's satisfies in both areas.  You can get their fries seasoned with just salt and pepper or with southwest seasonings.  Both are really good.  There are no bland, greasy, mushy fries to be found here (unlike pretty much every other restaurant in Kent.  Really?  Are fries that difficult to get right???).  And the pizza is surprisingly good.  I always opt for the white pizza (not a fan of red sauce) and some places equate white pizza with tasteless pizza.  Just because I dislike sauce doesn't mean I dislike flavor.  Lucky for me, Cajun Dave's is all about the flavor, and their white pizza is quite yummy.  I've also tried a few of their po-boys, all of which were made well.

For good grub in downtown Kent, skip Ray's overrated, often poorly made food and walk across the street to Cajun Dave's instead.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I agree with Elyse. The food here is bad. I guess it goes well with water street tavern. They don't have a proper tap system, like Rays, so beer is always flat and drinks poorly made.  So, looking for bad food and drinks? Go here."}
{"text":"So yummy! I've only ever had their carry out, so I can't say anything about their service. But all the food I've ever ordered from there was beyond delicious. Go for their Mac & cheese, pulled pork or anything sea food"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and it's been okay but today was simply awful. They were out of fries (regular and sweet potato) and buns (which we only found out after paying). We waited 35 minutes for a cup of soup and a fried pickle appetizer. We waited an additional 10-15 minutes for our sandwiches- which they left a lot of stuff off. Never recommending it again."}
{"text":"Stopped in mostly out of curiosity after seeing their large smoker in operation out front. 

We tried the special of the day, fresh cut french fries covered in pulled pork, cheese, and BBQ sauce (and the portion size was HUGE! We got a \"small\" and it was still big enough that two people could not finish it), a pulled pork sammich (again, a very large serving size for the price) with a nice sweet sauce, and the day's lunch special - a smoked burger. The burger patty, gouda cheese, and bacon had been assembled, then smoked, and served on a grilled bun. Really, really tasty and not a bad price for lunch.

The bar / tavern they operate out of is pretty much an average sports bar, nothing exciting or unique but they had a pretty decent amount of stuff on draft or in bottles that I'd consider \"actually good beer.\""}
{"text":"Not a fan. Boyfriend and I ate here on a whim, and were looking forward to a nice meal and a few drinks. The staff was shockingly rude and disengaged, especially the bartenders. The food rivaled my last meal at Burger King, yet was priced like a nice restaurant. There are way too many other awesome places around to bother wasting money at this one."}
{"text":"Having been born and raised in the New Orleans area, I am always skeptical when a restaurant in this area claim to serve cajun dishes.  I was told \"this place is pretty authentic.\" ... I must confess my skepticism remains in tact.  The food lacked any spice or kick.  The portions were small for the price.  I ordered the shrimp and crawfish etouffee.  It was a bland tomato sauce (and little of that).  The rice was dry and crispy as if it had set out and dried out all day. 

This food was about as far from \"Cajun\" as Kent is from New Orleans."}
{"text":"Food was really good. Muffalato sandwich(im sure i butchered that spelling) Smoked Gouda mac and cheese. Both really good. FYI the side order of mac & cheese was enough for a meal on its own. Price was a little higher than I expected but not enough to keep me from going back. 

Only down side is that it is in the Water Street Tavern. Its ok if you go early, but go late and its a Fraternity Bro fest in there. In fact I would have tried the food long ago but usually avoid the Water Street like the plague. but hey to each his own if you like to call everyone you meet \"Bra\" then you'll love it. Or just do as I will do take it togo."}
{"text":"The food USED to be great and gets worse with time.  You never know how it's going to turn out. The kids that they hired to live up to Dave Russo's original menu and recipe just have no clue what they're doing.  The set-up is weird and the service is with \"diminished capacity.\"  Eh."}
{"text":"Went here for their Tuesday night special of date night. You get two salads, a pizza and a bottle of wine for $20. This is a great deal for a college town when most of us are living on little income. They have specials everyday of the week as well as $2 happy hour which was pretty nice as well. 

My first experience was with a lady behind the counter who for all intents and purposes seemed to hate her life and job. She gave this place a bad name for me. She never acknowledged us when she dropped our food off and was rude anytime I asked a question. However, the cook overheard me talking and spoke with me, even recommended a certain pizza and let me taste a cheese I've never had before to make sure I'd like it on my pizza. This guy saved the night from the other lady. 

The food was good, extremely good salads and pizza, the fries are pretty good as well! For a small chuck of change you can really have a good night out! I highly recommend this place, just avoid the short lady at the counter if you can!"}
