{"text":"I stumbled on this place while passing through and stopped in to get a bottle of water. When I walked in I saw the sandwiches and got hungry. They all looked great but I settled on the egg salad. It was really good. Maybe not quite $5 good, but really good.   I assume the owner rang me up. He's one of those guys that makes you feel like you're already friends with him.   Cool little store and whenever I'm in the area, I'll be stopping in for a sandwich."}
{"text":"We were having a meeting and wanted to order an easy lunch from some place close. A friend had told me about this little deli months ago...so I decided to call and see if they would work with me. I talked to the owner, his name is Eddie. He is so nice and easy to work with. He wanted to please us.   We ordered 13 different deli sandwiches along with sides of either potato salad, mac salad or chips.   Everything was wonderful! Each person loved their lunch and wanted to know when we could order again. Indeed...we will be doing so! Thank YOU, Eddie for your kindness and the yummy lunches we all enjoyed!"}
{"text":"I'm a regular at the deli. That's what everyone calls it just the deli. I grew up in Walton Hills and absolutely love the deli. The owner is such a sweetheart and really takes care of his customers. He has a vast assortment of pre-made sandwiches, subs, and pasta salads. He also has smokies and crab cakes. Everything is really good. It's not really advertised but he makes a great hot corned beef sandwich! It's on of the delis hidden secrets! You just need to ask for it. The meat is piled high and you can get any cheese or condiments you like added. I usually go for Swiss and horseradish. The prices are great too. None of the sandwiches cost more than 5 or 6 dollars, most are $3.99. How can you go wrong with a 10 inch sub for $3.99? He also has a nice craft beer section where you can purchase by the bottle. I love getting a sandwich and a new beer to try whenever I stop in."}
