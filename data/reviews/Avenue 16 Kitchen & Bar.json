{"text":"This used to be Ric's Grill before they went out of business. My wife and I have been coming to this restaurant for many years for breakfast mostly. The service has always been friendly. The food used to be very good. In years past, the biggest problem was the lack of wait staff. This restaurant tries to accommodate room service for the hotel, service a buffet and wait tables. The number of staff they have is nowhere near enough. If there's a sporting event at COP and / or the hotel is full, the restaurant just can't keep up. This issue has not gone away. But now even the food is worse than before. I used to look forward to their roasted potatoes with my breakfast, now it's just deep fried tater tots. It seems to me that the restaurant is banking on everyone using the buffet. So when you want to order from the menu, you're going to be in for a wait. We watched a table of 6 where the people ordering off the menu didn't get their food until the buffet users had finished 2 helpings. We waited a good 15 minutes for coffee because the buffet ran out and had to be replenished first. The overall quality and speed has been going downhill and we wanted to give them one more chance. They failed."}
{"text":"Terrible. Both dinner...and the next days breakfast.  Hotel was busy due to tournaments in town. You'd think they would have more staff on to accommodate...  Stopped by as it was convenient...being in hotel and all. There were 4 adults and 6 young people from 5-18 in our group. Our drink order...for all of us...to at least 20 minutes to arrive. Seemed like only 2 servers were working and even they lamented at how sliw the bartender was. Food also took quite a while and by the time it arrived my burger was dried out and the cheese in my poutine had begun to harden. My wifes fish was overcooked and my friend got the entirely wrong burger. Unreal. To add insult to injury...we had to pay the mandatory 18% gratuity due to the size of our party.  The following morning, we rilled the dice on the breakfast buffet...  Eggs were of course packaged...but undercooked and slimey. Sausages were not good either.  I will never return to this establishment and will encourage others to avoid it as well."}
{"text":"Been here many times and Avenue 16 is above average for the restaurant choices in the area. The staff was friendly and the food is good. The Coconut Curry Chicken Sandwich is one of my favorites. The Avenue 16 Burger is pretty good too. The restaurant is divided in two by a wine rack that contains a pretty good international selection of wines. You will find though that the traditional dining area stays pretty quiet. Most people eat on the bar side which is typically filled with guests from the attached Four Points Hotel. One downside is that they close promptly at 10:30."}
