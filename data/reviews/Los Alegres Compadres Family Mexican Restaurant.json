{"text":"This joint might only rate two stars in LA, but it's the best taco I've had on the East Coast. Get the tacos soft-shell and 'Mexican-style' with cilantro and radishes, delicious! Chicken enchilada was pretty good, the chalupa was just regular OK Tex-Mex fare. I wouldn't be surprised if there's a great 5-star authentic dinner somewhere on the menu, but our meal was a mix.

Salsa verde with the chips was excellent."}
{"text":"Food was plenty and good. Reasonably priced. slow service."}
{"text":"One of the best Mexican restaurants I've experienced...from the fresh warm tortilla chips, queso, green and red salsas, to the rice, beans, and entrees.

Prices are very reasonable.

We went on the glowing review from one of our neighbors."}
{"text":"With 2 other Mexican places within walking distance, I didn't give this place much hope to begin with but I was in the mood for something quick and I can get in and out of most mexican places within 30 minutes.

It was quite empty when I walked in during my lunch hour.  There was only one other table occupied.  

The restaurant is nicely decorated with what appears to be hand painted murals on the walls.  The booth seats are a little low for me (I'm tall.  I don't like sitting on the ground).  The menu had an awful smell to it ..like they just wiped it off with water that was sitting around for a while.

They brought out 3 salsas and some queso with the chips.  The queso and the red salsa tasted like they were out of a can and were runny and had little flavor.  The green salsa was interesting with bits of avocado but it too was a bit runny.  The slaw salsa was the best and tasted fresh.

On with the meal.;  I ordered Lunch special #2 which is a taco / enchilada combo so i did the ground beef taco and chicken enchilada.

Like most mexican places, it came out quickly.   Everything looked quite appetizing except for the frozen mixed vegetables that were mixed in with the rice.  But looks are deceiving.  

The taco was decent. - meat was flavorful and it was stuffed to the top.  The enchilada was runny.  How do you make a chicken enchilada runny?
The beans were also runny and the rice had no flavor at all.  Everything was also quite salty.

I have to say this was one of the worst Mexican places I've been to."}
