{"text":"Great Greek restaurant that fellow Yelper Jason brought me to as original lunch meetup was closed. Previously this used to be Jaridinos. I asked one of the people working there why Jaridinos closed and she mentioned the owners didn't pay their rent for almost a year so the landlord got pissed. LOL one year at a restaurant without paying rent?!?! That's C-R-A-Z-Y M-A-N (in Borat voice). Now it is a refreshed Greek restaurant. My order was the pork gyro platter with Salad and thick cut fries. What they brought out was enough meat for 2 hungry guys (or 3-4 women). I couldn't finish it and provided some to my friend. Also I took a generous portion home. If you have a huge appetite this is your place! Chomedy has a plethora of Greek places but this joint fits the nrighborhood well! Meal was fantastic and I'm coming back as it was the real deal for value! Reason for not 5 stars was my meat was somewhat overcooked. Otherwise a strong 4.5 stars! Opa!"}
{"text":"Pylos is a fairly new restaurant that opened maybe less than a year ago, it use to be Jardinos. I go often to Universe which is right next door, and everytime i get out of the car to walk into Universe there is an amazing smell of grilled meat. So I keep telling myself I need to try this place. So finally I went to Pylos. I give it a solid 3.5 star. It's a nice place, clean and the food is pretty good, the portions are generous. I ordered the chicken souvlaki, it was good, too much seasoning for my taste but that just comes down to preference. The fries were fresh and crispy and the greek salad was good but not enough lemon juice or salt. Tsaziki was really tasty and the bread was grilled and buttered. Would I go back, maybe!!! There are better choices in my opinion, but it's definitely not the worst place to go. All in all you won't be disappointed but you won't be wowed either."}
{"text":"Grillades Pylos just opened up last week, replacing a resto that used to be called Jardinos. Pylos is Greek themed and delivers favorites from this cuisine. I'm a huge Greek food fan so I couldn't wait to visit it... and it was great stuff!  I went with the lunch menu option of their gyro, which was a table d'hote for $13 that consisted of a soup, main meal and dessert. The mushroom soup was excellent. The plate consisted of was gyro, potatoes, salad, rice with a side of tzatziki. The gyro was very good, I also loved the thick green style potatoes. The tzatziki was just right. The salad and rice was solid additions as well. The dessert option was limited to one kind of cake and it was alright. Coffee was included as well.  The ambiance is very nice with attentive staff. Service was excellent.   The price-tag is pretty solid. I think you're in for a good deal.   All in all, I'll be back here over and over again if they keep this up."}
{"text":"The best food ever ! The grilled octopus is so tender and has a secret ingredient in it ! The chicken is so flavourful and fresh ! A must try"}
{"text":"Great new greek restaurant. My second visit here already. Everything is awesome. I told them the only think they are missing is some lamb in their gyro. This would bring them to a 5 star."}
