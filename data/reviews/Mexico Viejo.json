{"text":"good mexican food.  i think it is the same owners as mariachi loco's and they just relocated to a nice plaza, very similar menu & several of the same waiters.  love their chips & salsa."}
{"text":"We really like the food here.  The staff are all very nice.  It's at least as good as Cozumel (which we also still like).  They deserve a lot more customers at lunch and weekday dinner time but I'll enjoy the quiet until this place is discovered.  I think this place is Mariachi Loco brother starting out on his own."}
{"text":"The food and drink are pretty standard for what most \"Mexican\" restaurants in this are offer in general. The best part of this restaurant really is the staff. They're very friendly and accommodating. The main hostess, I'm not sure of her name, is always smiling and greets you warmly. The tables and floors are clean. Nothing earth shattering for us on the menu as vegetarians, but their food is served warm and the margaritas are nice and cold. Nice local place to go if you're in the area or don't want to go too far out of town."}
{"text":"The food is excellent for the area, which is fairly lacking in its selection of Mexican restaurants.  The margaritas are also great!  I would go here over Cozumel, the only competition nearby, any day."}
