{"text":"Went here last night for the first time to check it out. They have an okay beer selection, seem to have a full bar, and also a small food menu. Beer was priced fine and they do have a happy hour deal Mon.-Thurs. The food seemed pretty $$ for what it was but I also did not try anything so I can't speak to the quality.   The place itself is fairly spacious with a lot of gaming options. I sat at the bar and none of the stations worked however. Meh.    Overall seems like a fun place and I would maybe go again if I was in the area."}
{"text":"Old school gaming alongside current gaming consoles is a great combination for everyone. Gamers can just hang out too or celebrate with friends. Wish this was around when I went to ASU. Fun for adults and families, with minors allowed until 10 pm."}
{"text":"If you're like me, you're not a fan of the typical Mill Ave crowd--airheaded girls and over-bro'd guys. This is where the DnD players and the gamers hang out, and it's refreshing.  I've been here many times during the week and the weekend, so here's what you're in for: - weekday nights: chill, easy to find a gaming station, usually quiet enough to have good conversations. - Friday night: depends on what kind of event is going on. Could still be chilled or there might be a crowd. - Saturday night: usually loud and packed. There's a regular rotation of Phoenix EDM DJs who play on Saturday nights, so come then if you're a fan of dubstep, DnB, electro, etc.  - Sunday: again, depends on the event. This is usually a good day to find tournaments and such going on for gaming.   The beer selection is good, with a lot of variety and good craft brews on tap. The cocktails and shots are cool, if a little weak--if you're indecisive about what to get, just roll the D20 die!  Food is nearly nonexistent but if you're hungry, there is a small menu. That's not why you're here, though. You're here to play games with cool people and drink good alcohol. I bring all my friends here from out of town, and every single one has loved it."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, awesome staff. First time here was so much fun!! There's a ton of games, and competitions, you have your pick of virtually almost any video game you can think of, on any system! Definitely will be back, and recommend endgame to any and all gamer/geek!!"}
{"text":"Super fun place! cheap food n beer make it worth the visit! the gaming is plus!"}
{"text":"We did our research before we went here. My bf and I are into games (he more than I ) and thought this place would be an amazing place to have a well needed date. Sadly, we were way wrong. We entered at a pretty slow time, which I was pretty thankful for, and the people there were mostly sitting down and playing video games. You can tell that these people come here often. Anyways, we walked in and asked for a place for 2. The guy politely told us it is a 'seat yourself' place, but left us right after that. So, we walked around trying to find a pattern. I.e. where is the ps3, I'd like to play mortal kombat. However, I couldn't see it and it was really hard to tell what went where, which tables were taken because a lot of them still had garbage and cups and plates on them. We didn't even get to order because we couldn't find out where to!   I give this place 1 star because it lacked. It's not a bar. It's not a restaurant. It's a lounge. If your going for the 1st time, take someone with you who has been there because they don't really care who walks in. We walked around for 5 minutes at least and nobody offered their assistance. For a place to succeed they need to constantly try and bring in new customers and they just lost 2. We will not return and we will not recommended this place  (we had high hopes, but ended up feeling stranded)"}
{"text":"I've been here twice. The first visit was positive since it was a major event night that attracted a large crowd of enthusiastic people. I ordered deep fried mushrooms, which were decent but a little burnt and a tad expensive. There was a lingering smell of gamer odor in the air, but any unpleasantness was offset by the friendly female staff and some of the strangers I gamed with.  My second visit erased every positive feeling I had about Endgame. I organized a night with a group to visit the venue and planned on snacking and playing some games. My night there was cut short by the overt rudeness of the bald, preening host with the stud earrings. As we entered, we were greeted by his unwelcoming scowl. He was already directing a scornful look at another person in the lobby, which I should've taken as a warning sign. A quick look around and I also realized the place was awfully empty and a little dirty on the floor and tables, and that this might be what it's usually like here on a typical, non-event night.  Wristbands are a requirement if you're consuming alcohol or staying after 10, but I would be leaving at 9:30, and I don't drink for personal reasons. When asked, I told him I wouldn't be drinking, but he ignored my words and shifted his scowl towards me. Long story short, he was incredibly rude about the situation, treated me as if I was a preteen with a fake I.D., and ignored every word I said just so that he could continue his incivility. You let a little 5 year old girl into the bar area. Did you give her a hard time as well and also make comments to other patrons on her skirt? I go to quickly seat myself only to find out from my company that he continued on to badmouth me once I was out of earshot. Professionalism at its finest.  Later on, when I go to step outside for a moment, he's glaring at me. That's enough for this gal. I'm not going to spend the whole night with a seething host breathing down my neck. I left and ate elsewhere on Mill.  TLDR I organized a group together to game and eat grub at Endgame, but after my recent experience with the rude, unfriendly host, that'll never be happening again. I might be willing to forgive meh food or atmosphere, but discourteous staff is where I draw the line."}
{"text":"Let me just start by saying games are free and where can you go wrong with free console gameplay on Mill Ave? It's fun-not your typical Mill ave crowd, it's seriously a gamer crowd and the two most recent times I have been here I have been stopped for the shirt I have been wearing and struck up a conversation about it. It's a fun place where gamers can come together and play games.  The price of the drinks are normal Mill prices, around $5-6 per drink/$5-8 per mixed with a pretty decent selection and both times I have been here (Friday night and St Patty's Day) have been served within five minutes no issue. Some of the staff seems to be experienced and others seem to be intro staff with little to no experience but on the brightside from what I have experienced is a pretty good staff overall.  I have heard that the food is pretty bad/not the greatest and I have no plans on ever actually eating here so it loses a definite star for that. I must say though, there are a lot of girls here and although it would appear that 90% of them are taken, they are still here and that is I guess a good thing. There's also a lot of LGBT people/couples here, if that's your kind of thing - it seems to be well accepted and no one seems to care.   I have to say the weirdest thing to me was the mirrors in the bathroom, all of the walls in the men's bathroom have mirrors and that's really weird/freaks me out. Even the stalls. Seems really strange to me personally."}
{"text":"Pretty happy with the luigi death star. not all the bartenders can replicate that drink T__T dear bartender who made my drink on my birthday i love you. please make me another one. haha"}
{"text":"Great environment. Almost impossible to get to a game unless you're there from open to close. Drinks are creative but too expensive. (Understandably with free gaming) foods inexpensive but it takes forever to be made; much like the drinks. I love the staff, except the cook. Thanks to the cook last night, I'd eaten two undercooked near raw chicken tenders before my girlfriend pointed it out. The waitress was kind enough to refund and replace my food, but the food poison I had all night while I was up all night vomiting....has left me not wanting to go back. Replace the cook or get a couple of them. Either way, giving your guests food poisoning after they drop over 200 dollars at your bar is a bad way to keep business."}
{"text":"We are here on a Sunday afternoon with 4 young boys that are 7 to 9 years of age.  They are having a blast.  James our bartender is awesome.  The food here is great and very reasonably price.  Tons of craft beers are great Bloody Marys.  The kids had grilled cheese and chicken tender.  They were awesome and about half the price we are used to playing.  The only thing that could be better is having football on one or two televisions but I also realize we are in a gaming bar."}
{"text":"First let me stress, this is a place to play games! They are uninterested in giving quick, adequate service. I have given this place several chances...I've been there five times before writing this. I am now convinced that the owner hired his gaming buddies and did not actually hire bartenders..most look pathetically helpless behind the bar and are unable to answer basic questions as \"what beers are on tap?\" I've waited about an average of twenty minutes standing at the bar while they are 1/4 full to have my tab closed out, each time being reassured that \"this never happens. I've received better service from more crowded bars on mill and I can honestly say that this place has consistently given me terrible service over several visits."}
{"text":"Wow, my first time here.. I brought my whole family and two friends. Im 5 months prego and asked every ? About the menu with no problems.. the main guy at the counter named WILL was so patient and great convo too.!! The chef ANTHONY was nothing short of amazing and extremly accommodating to our needs.. THIS IS A FAMILY ORIENTED PLACE AND I WILL DEFINITELY BE BACK FOR MORE... I ALSO SAY THANK YOU TO THE BAR MANAGER TONY FOR PATIENTLY HELPING ME FIND YELP..;-)"}
{"text":"Been here several times (4-5 times) and finally decided to review after this last incident. The only reason I didn't give this place a 1 star was because at least the games, when available and not in use which is rare, are free to use even if you don't purchase a drink.  I'm a fairly small female in stature and frame so I can understand being missed to take an order at the bar when there are people sitting at it and im trying to get the attention of the bartender through other customers....but this last time I was with another friend of mine on an off peak hour and actually sitting at the bar.  The bar area wasn't even full and there were empty spaces next to us with used glasses. We sat down and waited for one of 2 employees to not be busy with cleaning glasses. We started playing the game available in front of us 5 min later....still not acknowledged by the bartender. He made eye contact for a split second before looking the other way so it wasn't as if his back was turned and he didn't know we were sitting there.  I mentioned to my friend that they hadn't offered to take our order and we agreed to see how long it would take them. We ended up getting our own water at the little water station.....30 minutes later we left with never even speaking to the guy and I swear no one at the bar had gotten a new drink in that time...  Best thing you can do if you do decide to come here is eat/drink somewhere and only go to endgame if you want to play or watch people play games.  Short version: 1. Terrible service. 2. Wait times when not busy. 3. Not very clean. 4. At least the games are free..."}
{"text":"Showed up to watch LCS and try the food. I showed up to an empty restaurant (not their fault, I know) but what bothered me is that with employees just sitting around doing nothing, how dirty the place was. There was food on back tables just sitting there. As I walked around to look at what they offered, I couldn't help but feel the sticky floors on my shoes. I don't understand with employees just sitting around how no one could grab a mop.  When I asked for them to put something on the TVs, they did. The problem was that it froze and no employee bothered to fix it. It was the reason I wanted to go to the place, to watch a livestream and enjoy some food. But when I couldn't do either, I walked out. I was so disappointed, since I had high hopes for the place.  The one positive was the cook that was there. He seemed like the only employee with energy and was enthusiastic about the food. As soon as I walked in the door he wanted to make sure we tried some food.  That may be the only reason I consider going back."}
{"text":"Great drinks and good game consoles and game choices. This is a place my boyfriend and I go to when we're bored with nothing to do.   Great place for groups if you want to play Rock Band or Super Smash Bros and get a little competitive. They're getting better at being staffed when it's busy. They hosted reddit Prom here a few weeks ago and honestly, it was fun! DJ was great, good sponsorship, and the bars were tended.   Food is fair-priced, but games are free. It's a good place to chill out during the day or at night. This is not like most places on Mill and I think it's a good thing.   It's a good place to sit down and play games with your friends or strangers. I'm coming back."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. Yes, the food needs a little work, but the menu improves every time I come in. And besides, the food isn't the reason to come here anyway. The employees are friendly and help create a welcoming environment. As a girl who loves games, but doesn't always love the people who play them, this is something that is very important to me. They regularly hold events for all sorts of crowds - hardcore gamers, homespun crafters, tabletop roleplayers, indie game creators, cosplayers, you name it. They are open to ideas so don't be afraid to chat up the employees and tell them what you think.  This place is already great and has the potential to be amazing - if you are a geek in Phoenix, please help keep it open."}
{"text":"I love this place! The atmosphere it excellent, plenty of games to choose from and all the smash games are there with constant new challengers approaching to be the champ of the night!"}
{"text":"I really like this place. It has flaws, but if the regulars communicate their issues to the management, they get handled. The food is actually pretty good but whoever is running the kitchen is 'overclocking' themselves and the kitchen. I ordered the $8 half dozen. I got 7 huge wings and drums. Generous for the venue. The wings were cooked perfectly and the sauce was amazing and certainly made in-house. The oil however was fried out and overheated, and the cook was panicked about being able to make all covers.  *deep breath*  I love this place, but if the owners intend for this concept to succeed and spread, they need to listen to existing employees and customers a bit more about the menu and bar.  The gaming is great, I mean, epic. So good \"where have you been all my life?\" great.  They should get the liquor distro reps to teach the Bartenders, or have them pay attention to the ones they offer with every delivery. They try to be creative with cocktails but most of the named specials are either copies with a minor twist or unpalatable. \"League of Lemons\" was awesome, but it was just a lemon drop.  Another beef: please write details about the named house cocktails on the damn board. Your bartenders can't keep up with the pours,so they have no time to explain that the \"Big Daddy Drink\" is just a fucking carbomb. I was expecting some sweet green/blue/yellow glowy thing in a pint glass. It was a shot of whisky and a pint of lager. I ended up leaving 2 hours earlier than i'd intended because the drink had my head spinning. I had 2 more hours and $50 more to spend there, but you boozed me out because the \"Big Daddy Drink\" at the rapture ball was just a carbomb.  TL;DR: you need to describe your drinks and work on your menus. Consistency is quality is consistency."}
{"text":"The games were fun to play and the fries were the only part of my meal that was above average. However, my boyfriend loved his burger and geeked out on Super Smash Bros. Great average place to hang out with friends! The employees were pretty nice but all conversations with them were brief."}
{"text":"Really cool concept for a Bar! The games are all free and they are always offering contests and tournaments too. They also have a delicious kitchen managed by a local food truck, Aioli Gourmet Burger (Here is their link too: http://www.yelp.com/biz/aioli-gourmet-burgers-and-catering-food-truck-scottsdale)  Overall lots of fun and killer food and drinks! Will need to bring a bigger group next time I come in for a visit."}
{"text":"If places like this were around right when I turned 21, I would be a regular. As a working parent, I don't get out as often but this place is a little slice of home. It's got all kinds of games, and plenty of space to socialize with friends. The selection of games here is absolutely awesome and they're free to play, so that's cool. This is a wonderful concept and I hope more people give this place a shot. It's a gamer/geek bar, so don't expect the best food or drinks, but what they have is good. All these people giving it one or two stars are being way too nit picky. Come here for the games, stay for the good times with friends. You definitely won't regret it."}
{"text":"They could benefit from having more ambitious bartenders looking to sell more drinks and food because they all seem a little lackadaisical, but they do have good video game knowledge. It is cool you can play games for free and very fun! The drinks are great but the kitchen is slow and I wish they had more options for food because it seems they have nothing that they specialize in. For food. Still I like the place. They DO have wet wipes to clean the controllers but I had to request them. This should be something they keep on the bar in my opinion. Even so, I want this place to succeed. It's very cool and it's the kind of place you hope succeeds."}
{"text":"Garbage. Wanted to check this place out and it popped up on Groupon so i decided to take advantage. When i walked in the first thing i noticed was the smell. It reminded me of when i was a kid at chuckie cheese and somebody pee'd in the ball pit. We walked around to check out the games and most of them were unplugged or out of order and the ones that were working were on an old school tube television, like from when i was ten. So whatever, had the groupon and they have a bar right? No, the kitchen was closed and stipulation for using the groupon was u had to buy food... not worth it. Better bars within stumbling distance. Overall impresion i got is the owner/manger is a forever 16 year old kid from '95 who just hasn't cleaned his room since."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The drinks are amazing and the food is great!! I recommend the Tardis shot! ;) the games there are great and besides video games they have board games as well! If you are a gamer and have a craving for great food and drinks, then this is the place for you!"}
{"text":"they have good craft beers on tap. that is literally all they have going for them. it was hardly busy, and it took the bartender nearly 10 minutes just to look at us. the whole concept is great, but this place is disorganized, and the staff are unprofessional and inhospitable. will not return."}
{"text":"Waited 55 minutes for our food, then cancelled the order and went someplace else. Horrible place. Will not return."}
{"text":"I used to enjoy coming to this place. As word got out about this bar, it became more busy. I went here tonight and there were a huge group of people screaming and hollering about a smash bros game which i found ridiculous. I mean, they were treating it as a super bowl football game. It was too crowded and there aren't any time limits for each game so someone could be busy on a game practically all night long which no one else can play too. If there is a time limit on a console, it is not enforced. Also, they nickel and dime you every chance they get. Food is overpriced and portions are tiny, and they have a ridiculous charge of a dollar for changing a game. I don't carry cash with me, sorry, and if I can recall, I didn't have to pay anything to change games. Don't go here during peak times like weekends especially Sundays where it's almost impossible to get playing on a good Nintendo game. Very disappointing. Good lineup of games for that one extra star."}
{"text":"Video game idea is the trend and they seem to do it pretty well. Crowd that is drawn in is a nice change of pace compared to the rest of mill ave. Security and staff seem pretty typical, nothing special. Food isn't terrible. Some pretty cool specialty drinks. Owner is a douche bag."}
{"text":"Alright, so I should preface this review with the fact that I read almost all the other reviews on here before going to this place as well as writing this review, so I had a few pre-conceived notions about what my experience was going to be like.  1. Games, games, games! This place is great if you enjoy console gaming from the classics (SNES) to the newer stuff like Wii U and XBone. As a mainly PC gamer, I spent my whole time there watching people play, but they had more or less anything you could want for consoles. THIS is what this place has going for it. THIS is why people come here rather than any other bar.  2. Drinks! Our bartender was a really cool person, and we sat at the bar. I was expecting to get ignored by the staff because that's what half the reviews I read said, but there were 2 staff members for every 1 customer in there so there was little chance of that (we went on a Thursday at 5pm). The bartender was friendly, let us try out a few beers and ciders they had on-tap and even made a mini beer cocktail for my boyfriend which he ended up ordering another of. They said they are revamping their cocktail menu to be less confusing so if you want a fancy cocktail, talk up the bartender and ask what they recommend for the time being.   3. Food? So I am a huge fan of throwing things in deep fryers. Always have. It's American. However, when every single thing on your menu minus three very simple salads is deep fried, it does not bode well for my next day experience (if you know what I mean). We ordered the Mac and Cheese bites which were pretty good but I think they need more flavor, like adding jalapeno bits or maybe even bacon (everyone loves bacon, and it's also very American). We also got the spinach and cheese rangoons which were about as expected: spinach dip crab puffs. These were pretty good. After those we were still hungry so we ordered a chili dog and fries. It was worrying that they had \"ran out\" of chili previously, which means they don't make it in-house. The fries had a strange smell/aftertaste that was vaguely chemical but it could have been anything from not changing the fry oil or just the way the fries come from wherever they are ordered from. I think this kitchen could do with some fresher, less obviously pre-made food items. I would really love to be able to come to this place for 3 hours in the evening and get dinner there while gaming but as of now I would not want to eat more than just some happy hour snacks here.  I gave this place 4 stars because it has an AMAZING concept and they pull-off the gaming bar aspect very, very well and I was impressed by the bartender and our drinking experience.  Suggestions for ownership/management: get better food, whether it's ordering it from a higher-quality food supply place or just asking your customers what they'd like to see on the menu... Also, please note that greasy food + game controllers = not very sanitary."}
{"text":"I see new places opening around Phoenix...none of them by far as fun and awesome as Endgame bar.  Great food, staff and beer selection.  Best of luck!  Hope to see you guys come back soon in Tempe."}
{"text":"The staff here is AWESOME! They are always so willing to help and offer suggestions.   They have quite a bit of options for gaming but I wish they had more. They get taken up quickly since there is not enough options. Also, it always stinks in here for a bit.  I like coming here though because I love the concept of drinking and gaming at the same time. If they just updated the place a bit, it would be more attractive."}
{"text":"I brought a small group of friends here on a Friday night around 10. It was the first time for all of us. We are all big video game nerds so we awed at everything. Got a few pesky pikachu drinks and waited for an open console. Once you get a console it's a dollar for game changes but they have such a big selection it really isn't bad. After all the games are free to play!  The place is decked out with anime and video game drawings and the employees are dressed up in mixed cosplays. When I was their the waitresses were powerpuff girls and the guys team rocket. Besides it being really crowded I really enjoyed endgame along with some Pokemon Stadium 2 for the 64 ;)"}
{"text":"When you enter, to the left will be the bar and to the right will be the games, GameCube, Wii, N64, etc. I ordered the Ace Pear Cider which was amazing! The flavor was incredible. Then played some N64 and GameCube afterwards. Unlike Dave & Busters, you actually don't have to pay for the games here, just for your drinks of course which was really nice.  I was expecting an hourly rate to pay for renting the systems, and I was pleasantly surprised that we didn't have to. :) Will come back to try more delightful drinks here, and of course play more. Even though it was a Saturday night we didn't have to wait too long to play on a system, which was really nice. We came around 9:30/10 by the way."}
{"text":"ONE OF MY FAVORITE PLACES!!! Only reason I didnt give it 5 stars is that the food is average. You can tell they dont change the oil enough. Drinks are great and creative! The game selection is amazing also have board games and multiple systems."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite bar. The bartenders are all friendly, I could hear my friends over the music, and they have a great selection of games and drinks. Had a blast definitely going back."}
{"text":"Normally I would give 5 stars for a place like this. I really enjoy playing video games and have been every since I was a kid growing up. Their video game selection has many consoles available for use and the social interaction between other people has been really great. However the food & beverage side of things could still be improved on as I wish they had more food selection.  Still though this place makes for a great night out especially if you like video games. The fact that you can play video games for free here naturally merits a high rating however if you're not into gaming then there are plenty of other places out there that would be a better fit for a night out."}
{"text":"This place has fast service and the fresh chicken with garlic parmesan is delicious. Yet to try much else because it's so good. I haven't done much for asking where the games are because there's usually one I like that's open. Only been here one night that it was slammed (last Friday for the Rick and Morty party which was awesome) and service wasn't bad at all and staff was cool. This place is awesome but plan in advance if it's a busy night of the week and you want to play because the staff might be stuck already helping someone else or the best spot to play is already taken. As a patron who likes to meet up with a friend here it's never an issue. Plus, where else do I get to play Dreamcast which alongside GameCube are the two greatest consoles ever made but don't judge me. Please give this place your money."}
{"text":"I am not a gamer, but my BF is. As a result, I've gotten dragged here on several occasions. While gaming isn't my thing, this place is not that bad!   They have a full bar with bartenders willing to make anything you request. Well drinks start at $4 and cocktail at $7. The menu is basic but the prices are crazy low, you can get food starting at $3. The staff is super attentive, if you order food they'll find you throught the entire Arcade, even if you're moving around and bring your food.   I've also seen a half of Groupon so be on the lookout for that if you're interested!"}
{"text":"This place is okay. I liked how it used to be when it opened up. When I first started going with my bf and our friends the place was fun, the food was good, and the bartenders didnt suck. Now a days the bartenders are crappy at making drinks, serving them and their manners are a little off putting. The food back then was regular deep fried bar food which I love because it's not a bar without the fried food. Now it's weird burgers and flat breads. I dont want to eat a fucking flat bread when I play video games! I want fried food!"}
{"text":"Stinky, dishonest, pandering bar run by morally questionable people.  From the start, the proprietors of this rank-smelling bar have been attempting to forcefully market their concept to a facebook group with no ties, no familiarity, and no bridgebuilding. Events hosted there had marketing companies posted out front with large tables of marketing material to push on unsuspecting party-goers. All effort in accommodating the group was to weasel money, not to provide service.   Drinks were not allowed on the closed off patio for unknown reasons. I've heard through friends and other contacts not associated with the group that the bar has had issues with mass employee walk-outs, legal issues, tax issues, and general dishonest behavior.  Otherwise, bar service and selection was mediocre, the sound system basic and thrown-together, the food looked utterly disgusting (I think they're on their 5th menu/kitchen change now?), and they provided no compelling reason to ever go back.  The management staff have attempted to reach out to me about the negative review, but only to tell me my impressions were wrong and place blame on people no longer with the company, not to apologize for my experience or state any efforts to fix problems."}
{"text":"Two friends and I went this last Sunday evening and to be honest I expected this place to not offer \"great\" service due to the lack of stars and a few comments. But in all honesty service was pretty great. The bartender was very helpful, explain how the gaming and switching the games worked. We were really hungry but iffy about the food because we saw a few people's reviews that the food wasn't good. And I'm kinda picky with food quality but we went ahead and ordered the Cucco Strips, Assassin's Cheese Fries, Ultra Rapid Fried Pickles, and Nacho Libres for us three to share and I did not expect any of it to be SO delicious! I enjoyed everything! Definitely stopping by again!"}
{"text":"It's true the biggest issue here is the console hoggers that have not manners/edict and sit there for HOURS they play for free. It does suck the fun out of the place and could make or break the business. The staff seems to lack enthusiasm and customer service skills. This place needs to be a great bar first and a video game place second. I think if there's any changes I'd suggest is remove the PCs from the booths to open up to other customers that want to eat. Also I would keep the classic consoles free but charge customers for newer gen consoles with a time limit. That way everyone can play and the bar can make more money."}
{"text":"I just visited this bar yesterday for the first time. I am not a gamer. I own a wii at home that is collecting dust. However, I had a blast here! What a great concept!! I even met another person there who taught me how to play black ops. I will be back and I will surely spread the word about this place!"}
{"text":"Great place!  I love the atmosphere here makes me come back all the time even though I've been to all the bars on mill! What really made me like this place was my waitress SYDNEY she was very responsive and answered all my questions about the menu. Her customer service was great! She noticed at least immediately when my drink was low and if I was close to finishing my meal. Thank you Sydney for the phenomenal customer service you provided me. I managed a restaurant before and I would highly recommend you to several restaurants especially for the high maintenance bar you are at. Keep up the good work. I've noticed and I'm positive you'll go places for sure! Keep smiling and being super welcoming."}
{"text":"Music is loud and obnoxious. Bartenders could care less about the customers and rather wander around doing nothing. No nice bar chat here just shut the fuck up and play the games."}
{"text":"While I enjoy the selection of beer, that is about the only thing I enjoy about this bar. I have visited them twice now and both times have been service nightmares.  On this last visit, the staff seemed terribly overwhelmed. Especially the bartender. It's clear that there is a lack of teamwork and communication amongst the crew.   The food takes forever, and from what I can tell, none of it should. Having spent years working in food service, no burger should ever take 40+ minutes.   Still haven't quite figured out how to actually play games there... little to no signage and staff seems too busy to help.  Won't be going back willingly... despite their good beer."}
{"text":"This review is strictly for the games and booze. I never ordered the food, I mean why waste a good buzz....also that's what the jack in the box around the corner is for. Anyway, they have awesome mixed drinks, all named after games. The beers on tap are legit, not a huge selection but the ones they do have are good. There is like one arcade unit, so don't come thinking its full of arcade games. However there is about 50 T.V.s with every system you can think of. They also play Twitch above the bars, if no one is playing the games there. Its a gamer paradise in my opinion."}
{"text":"If I could give this place 3.5 stars I would. This place is pretty cool and I had a good time playing video games while having a couple drinks however, the bartender was very rude and made my experience less than what it could have been. I left earlier than expected all because of the tall, bald bartender. I'm not talking about the bald guy who checks your ID, he was very nice. It wasn't very busy since I went on a Sunday, and as soon as I got my wristband my friend and I went over and sat at the bar. My friend had been there before and asked about a certain shot he had received last time he was there. The bartender sighed and literally threw down a drink menu at him. After my friend got his shot, I ordered a drink and after he gave it to me I thanked him. Didn't even acknowledge me whatsoever.  Then there was a problem with the game system we were using and when my friend attempted to ask for help, the bartender shrugged his shoulders and said \"what exactly is the problem\" his attitude was very condescending. Luckily there was a another customer right next to us that was able to fix our problem. The drinks were good and the atmosphere was good, just wished the bartender was a little nicer, made me feel like I was an inconvenience just being in his presence. Will go back though to try this place out again"}
{"text":"Awesome bar. Awesome games. Good drinks from awesome mixologists.  We got to roll a dice for a chance to win a fee appetizer.    Games, yes the video games..my bf really liked the selections.  Many ppl were enjoying the games and drinking high end cocktails.  I gave it a 4 bc I didn't really try the food.  Just fried mushrooms appetizer, it was decent.   We decided to check it out when we spotted a new spot where the Bamboo Club used to be, 2nd floor overlooking Mill Ave in front of the Handle bar.   Will be back."}
{"text":"Free video games ranging from classic to current. Plus amazing tribute themed cocktails & amazing food. I sure hope this place sticks around for a while. It's magical!"}
{"text":"Some cool games to play if you want. Good place to hang out at times. On certain nights where they have themed parties, it can get pretty good.  They can definitely improve their food, prices and service though. It's somewhat of a new place but not really. They have been opened for a while so the complaints that other customers have should not exist. But they do.  I think once they fix those things, it can be a four star place."}
{"text":"Thought it was an arcade-bar. It's more like a current console generation-bar. It's kind of weird to be sitting at a bar while the guy next to you is playing Call of Duty. There's also a World of Warcraft section in the corner, which is the antithesis of social. Food was standard bar food. Beer selection was pretty great though, but you can find that anywhere in Phoenix. Bad concept. Get some Arcade machines."}
{"text":"Great vibe. Low key and perfect for people with a gamer background who want to just go relax and have a few with some friends."}
{"text":"The concept is really cool. A bar where you can play video games! That is if you ever get to play any of the games. We went on a Tuesday night or some other off night and were there for over two hours and not one group ever got up and left or offered to let us play. We kept waiting and waiting for a station to open up but they never did. I'm glad that they seem to have some \"regulars\" who go there but it would be nice if some new people could play the games. They were nice enough to let me bring my birthday cake inside though."}
{"text":"Regular. Nice to meet new ppl and play games. Just wanna hang go here. Drinks are pricy but great names they use based off games and all. Go when there is an event the atmosphere is better."}
{"text":"The fun drink menu is awesome and the drinks are tasty. Customer service could be better and the bartender could try and be more helpful even if his expertise is only alcohol. Sorry we couldn't read your mind that you didn't know anything about games here even though it is a game bar."}
{"text":"Want a place to get hammered and play video games or watch e-sports that is not at home? Endgame Bar! They have a ton of consoles and retro games to keep anyone busy for a night. Beer selection is not bad and some of the events they host are actually pretty fun. They even have food if you have been gaming/drinking too hard and get hungry!"}
{"text":"Greeted at the door and asked to provide ID that I was 21, then given a wristband. Problem was that I didn't get the opportunity to drink. With over four bartenders casually meandering, only after ten minutes at the bar was I asked what I wanted. The guy then proceeded to forget, and go about other business.  It was a weird night. Every single monitor had Smash Brothers and was occupied with teens even at 12:00 am. My friend and I left within 30 minutes. Place seems overhyped by teenage crowd."}
{"text":"Heard about this bar from a friend, decided to check it out for a drink while waiting for a friend to arrive on the light rail. I walked in and was greeted immediately by the bartender  (dark haired guy with a big beard). He told me all about the beers and the theme of the bar, and suggested a beer I might like. Awesome service, great beer. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Nerd church of tempe. Patrons aren't the nicest about sharing games- most people plant themselves in front of \"their\" game and don't move for hours. It also vaguely smells of vomit here all the time."}
{"text":"This is a great idea for a bar. I just wish that Endgame had executed it better. The games are great. Plenty of choices as far as that goes; however, where my concern is is the staff. Very poor service. The food took over an hour to come out and wasn't even that busy. When i asked for help at the bar the bartender was always distracted chatting with a friend who happened to come in. Loved the creative video game style drinks but could of been a better place if the staff were trained better in customer service"}
{"text":"I'd give it a one star, however, I think the concept is a cool idea. BUT...it could've been done better.   The \"re-grand opening\" was a total loss...it was packed...however their system failed them and they were VERY slow at getting drinks out! If you wanted a beer, then great! but a mixed drink...forget that! My friend had to wait almost an HOUR for her drink! Plus, when they gave her the drink, they just walked away...it's like they were giving them out for free! Sheesh.   We were not happy...plus there was barley any room to move about....ehh oh well..not going back...."}
{"text":"I love the concept, but this place is so frustrating! Hire a freaking hostess! Above all get bartenders who can MOVE! Get ready to wait an hour for a bartender to look and you and ignore you some more. The extra back bar doesn't have that much so they're no help. Get bartenders who effing move it and problem solved. Heck have shot girls/guys walking around or something! I'm at a bar! I'm socially awkward! Give me booze fast!!!"}
{"text":"This is a very unique place for a specific demographic: gamers. It's so refreshing to see this, in contrast to the countless sports bars and other watering holes on Mill Ave. I don't particularly like Mill Ave, but friends told us about this place and we had to check it out.   It's located upstairs near the ASU Brickyard, between 6th and 7th St, in a nice hideaway spot. Their website right now is lacking, but hopefully they'll be updating it. The space is fairly large, with quite a few booths and tables strewn throughout. A decent selection of beers and ciders on tap and some specialty drinks that I saw.   Do not come here specifically for the food. This isn't the place to get a decent dinner; the food is basically just late-night bar food that you crave after you've been drinking: mozzarella sticks, french fries, some questionable-looking pizza, etc. The portions are all pretty small compared to the price too. Drink prices are totally reasonable, but just skip on the food unless you're starving.   Now let's get to the point: It's a video game bar. There are about two of each system lining the wall that are attached to decent-sized computer monitors. It looks like they have pretty much every gaming system, so there's something for everyone. There are leather couches in one area with big screen tvs with the newer platforms hooked up. People were playing Halo and Mario Kart and the like. There's also another area with Rock Band set up, which was fun.   Everyone was super nice and the place really exceeded my expectations. There was no cover, no fee to play any of the games, and it was great. I'm sure this will change in the future when they gain popularity, but for now, it's a really affordable place and very welcoming. We checked out a couple games with the guy at the service desk, and they have quite the selection. Everything is inventoried on the computer, so you couldn't physically see the titles, but the games we asked for they had, and they gave us extra controllers too. Here's a list of the games per their website: http://endgamebar.com/games/  Overall, it was an awesome evening full of fun. Next time we're going to bring some board games and lounge in one of the booths also. We had no problems with our tab and the bartender we interacted with seemed really cool. He let me try one of the ciders before I committed to it, which I appreciated. If you're into video games at all, you will appreciate this place for its unique vibe and charm."}
{"text":"OK, where do we start? The service is great. The games are awesome. The beers are cheap.... And the fried pickles are the best! This bar kept us entertained for hours. No need to be social when you can play Mortal Kombat at the bar instead. Game on!"}
{"text":"I'm just a little jealous that I never had money to get a place like this going myself Over the top with the video games Definitely gets two thumbs way up in that department Didn't get to try food or signature drinks yet but they should really get rid of the top hits dj that came on at 10pm Every other bar on mill has that No need for more guys you already have best bar idea ever"}
{"text":"me and my girlfriend whent there something new to do  we walk in no one said a word just bunch of nerds and gamers huddled around games very creepy no other women in site i didn't want my girlfriend in there for sure"}
{"text":"An independent barcade in Tempe? Yay, right?  Not quite.  Chicago spoiled me with legit barcades, such as Emporium and Logan Arcade. Those stellar establishments offer row after row of vintage pinball and arcade games. Endgame has a few crappy arcade cabinets, zero pinball and a bunch of consoles that basically remind me I could have just stayed home.  The layout is silly, with the gaming areas split clear across the bar, and it just looks like the execution fell far short of the concept."}
{"text":"This place has SOOOOO MUCH potential, but honestly, its sad how bad it is! Being a video game bar, you would think they would have taken the time to put all the wires in the wall, but they are out and hanging around. If you want something to drink, make sure its basic and comes in a bottle. Anything outside of a normal beer, the bartenders have no idea what your are talking about. I asked if they had Salior Jerrys, the kid had no idea what it was and asked me what type of alcohol it was. They didnt have it, so I said ok any rum and coke.... he then said ummm would this Bacardi kind be of for you? It would have been easier if I walked around the bar and poured the drink myself. Now for the food, YUCK! I expected it to not be grand at all, but to pay $8 for burnt cheese sticks, really! How do you mess up cheese sticks!! You probably got them out of a frozen bag and dumped them into the fryer.....easy!! Yet you didn't watch them, so you served them obviously burnt. They were BLACK! And you still served them!! I think the business could really benefit, if they hired a real bartender, kitchen staff and a business manager to help clean up their act! Maybe charge a small fee for hourly play, something to bring in money to get that place rockin! It has real potential and you want it to be so good, so it sticks around. If they keep headed this direction, it wont stay open long. Other than all that, they have a decent selection of different game consoles and a good list of games to choose from."}
{"text":"I might not be old enough for the bar area yet but the other gaming area is FANTASTIC!  The people there a so friendly and social. I had an amazing time honestly I might come every Thursday .:D"}
{"text":"My husband and I come to Endgame every Monday to meet with friends and play tabletop games.  I have to be honest, when we first started coming, the kitchen was not that great.  BUT it has come a long way in the many months we've been coming (every Monday night for almost a year).  The hand cut fries are awesome (try them Cajun style!).  FRESH chicken fingers breaded and cooked to order, unique sauces for the wings, quesadillas overloaded with cheese!  They use REAL cheese for the burgers, not nasty process cheese food singles, my hubby loves the pepper jack and bacon.  My absolute favorite thing is the fried pickles.  They use spicy dill spears and the crust they get on them is PERFECTION.  There are homemade cookies and baked treats for cheap at the order station most of the time!  Okay, enough about the food.  The staff is always courteous and happy to see our group.  Some weeks we all get food and drinks, some weeks we are all broke and don't spend so much but the level of great service doesn't falter.    There are TV's with every gaming console EVER, and couches, and a full bar surrounded with TV's and with an amazing selection of craft beers.  Aaron is usually our bartender and he's always very friendly!    I don't know how business is  the rest of the week at Endgame, but I always look forward to Monday nights because of this bar.  Thanks for being here!!"}
{"text":"I've been to Endgame about a half dozen times now. It has gotten WORSE with each visit. The food, once acceptable for bar fare is now downright inedible, burnt, greasy rubbish. The food is overpriced for the portions (even for Mill) and there is no consistency.   The beer. What can I say about the beer? Oh yeah, not much because they can never seem to keep their taps in product. The only thing regularly available are some of the IPAs that the staff wont even touch.  The music is so loud, even during down times (except at closing) is usually pumped up so loud that there is no talking to the person sitting at the bar next to you. The secondary bar has NO seating.  Also, what is up with the closing hours? Either stay open, or post an earlier closing time. On three occasions now, I have come in later in the evening, only to be told, \"last call\" hours before the posted close time because the \"manager\" (?) wanted to go home since he wasn't making enough money.  If you are going to have a d20 \"specials\" menu, it would help if you had product to make more than 4 items on the menu.  Last, but certainly not least, THIS PLACE IS ABSOLUTELY FILTHY! The floor is sticky, the tables are never bused, and even the \"cleared\" tables have tacky residue on them. The bathroom stinks like a port-a-john at the Ren Fair.  Stop ignoring customers to play your video games, and when you slow down, try doing some cleaning."}
{"text":"Remember that cheap frozen pizza you ate as a kid?  Like the stuff they served at the wavepool, or the roller rink?  Yeah, they have that stuff, man it takes me back :)  They also have their own version of \"Angry Video Game nerd\" working here, he's hilarious."}
{"text":"Went here a few months ago with a few friends. This is a cool concept with free games to play. However, service is bleh. No sense of caring or urgency to help out any customers.  I wasn't overwhelmed with excitement like with most other arcade type places."}
{"text":"We stopped in here on a date night stroll on Mill Ave, great concept if the owners are able to pull it off. Great beer selection but really slow services, at an empty bar no-less. As the other reviewers stated you pretty are on your own when it comes to trying to figure out how to use the machines and/or change the game.  The most popular section in the back seems like it's always busy, with the same group. Meaning not sure is there a limit or a signup sheet, again, no info around and the staff stays grouped together in a corner looking terrified. Didn't have any food, but I can see how it could be bad, but you never know. If I were a more avid gamer, would come back with friends and give it another shot, but I'm not, so, yeah."}
{"text":"What can I say about End Game?  Hmmmmm is Amazing a strong enough word? How about Fantastical? Bombastic? Well in any case End Game bar is one of the best experiences I've had in Phoenix! Video games and drinks my friends,food and video games and drinks! We are talking every major system ontop of some old favorites like the SNES and even the Dreamcast. Date night,Bro Night,Party Night heck any night! I can't see this place ever not pleasing a wide range of patron types. The staff are funny and well versed in all things game.  The food is on par with some of the more well known bar chains. Throw in some rocking tunes and a few rounds Mortal Kombat,and your in for one awesome time!  5 frigging Stars!"}
{"text":"If you are a dude, you will most likely disregard my review and go to Endgame without needing any opinions and that's ok - I totally understand. If you happen to be the girl who gets called to DD an entire group of drunken men/trolls, read my every word.   The concept of a game bar in Arizona is heaven sent and it really does make sense to open more of these. Hot Sahara weather outside - take a break in a place where games are free, drinks are cheap, a menu full of fried stuff, and most of all A/C. Besides Howie's, I don't know of any other place that brings together this specific demographic and it's great that they can now enjoy Mill Ave in a different way other than sweatily rubbing against other random people in what normal circumstances I've been in - a sausagefest crowd. It's even open during the school day so great for in between class breaks.   Food and drinks can definitely be improved on - it's how this place makes their money seeing as the games are free. Not sure how experienced the bartenders are but my drinks were pretty mild and just tasted like I paid 7 dollars for pure juice. Definitely not okay as I'm being forced to play games against my will with what seemed like the rowdy seven dwarfs. Then again, I ordered 2 Stella, 1 Shiner, 2 Pineapple Vodka, Some Game-themed Mixed Drink, plate of fries, and a Red Bull and vodka and it only came out to $37 so it didn't upset me too much.  They have a wide array of games from the original Sega's to the brand new Super Smash, you will get to play whatever your heart desires. TV's all around and some old school arcade games. You can even ask for board games like Cards Against Humanity. If you need an extra player or a different game, staff is pretty handy and quick when needed. They have tournaments here as well from time to time and the place can get pretty crowded for a Friday night so you more than likely have to creepily stalk what you want to play. If you have a student ID be sure to show it so you can get a 10% discount.   All in all, I really hope this place improves both food wise and decor wise (only God knows what has happened in those dark booths) and DON'T FORGET to bring hand sanitizer for yourself. On a busy night, I swear this place could easily begin an epidemic from touching the control players."}
{"text":"They denied me my choice employment however I'm still a huge fan of this place. The game selection is great. I believe they have the different Playstations, Xbox's, older consoles Sega genesis...dreamcast. Some arcade style games as well. I suppose you can also reserve an area for you and friends to play games. But I have come for special events like New Years and have not been let down by this places unique,  and playful atmosphere. I'm not sure if it's a kid place but for me that's a plus. I can't stand getting drunk around children and feel bad for not letting the kid play first."}
{"text":"Great concept, impressive array of systems, pretty good bar, and a friendly staff. This place has potential, but it's still rough around the edges, with sad wasted space and random weird lighting.   It isn't quite a barcade, as most of the games are on systems (old school and new). It isn't quite a LAN party, as perhaps too many of the games are of the anti-social, 1 player, old school variety, which feels somewhat awkward in a public place. Perhaps having a purposeful area of these games, with the group games in separate areas, would work better.  But I'm nitpicking for the hypothetical person who isn't me. I personally love the place and wish it were further south."}
{"text":"So in THEORY, this is an amazing idea for a bar.  All your favorite games, from days, months, or years past, all in one place, with drinks, and fried food.  Just like when you never left your room for hours and hours on end playing FFVII or Resident Evil as a kid.  Except it's more like those days when your older brother spent hours and hours on end playing Golden Eye and you just prayed he'd have to at least leave to use the bathroom long enough for you to swap in the Playstation and get one friggin' chocobo race in.  (Oh! and there are STILL no girls in sight. that part's the same)"}
{"text":"I closed my tab leaving a tip ... Ten minutes later, someone comes up to me and says that they gave me someone's else's tab by accident to close. Whoops. Eventually I close my own tab and went home. Looked at my account the next day, I had three different tabs open of various amounts, non of them correlating with my original tab. I did the math, and was significantly over charged (yes I know the prices of the beers I got and the three separate tabs I had in my account was a little over double of what my original charge was suppose to be). It's a fun place, but because of this bad experience, and the fact that the bartenders are slower (and I mean SLOW) than grandma crossing the road, I can't give this place more than three stars; that's being generous :/ decent beer selection though and fun video games :)"}
