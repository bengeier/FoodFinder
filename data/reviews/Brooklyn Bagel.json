{"text":"UGH.........
I stopped by the deli today to grab a sandwich for lunch.  Not many other places in this area to eat so I thought it to be a good choice.  WRONG!!!  So I bought a chicken salad sandwich on a salt bagel and it looked so delectable but as I was eating it I heard a little voice from my tummy - 'not good'.  I just thought that maybe I was disappointed that the sandwich looked so good but didn't taste as good as it looked.  However, 30 minutes later I felt the BBG's (bubbly gut) and off to the toilet I ran.  Soooooo embarrassing when you're stuck in the bathroom at work for half the day.  To make matters worse, my co-worker offered to run to the drugstore to buy me some Kaopectate.  Yeah...not my finest hour.  Thanks Brooklyn Bagels!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent customer service. Owner is very friendly. Good quality bagels & fresh coffee. Get the \"Ultimate\" breakfast bagel."}
{"text":"I was expecting to get fresh bagels in here but it seemed as if these bagels have been sitting around since yesterday. I believe I have experienced better bagels at the grocery store. The cream cheese was good. For a bagel place, I expect more. I shall try them again. Maybe they could redeem themselves."}
{"text":"The service here was excellent and the food was even better, you can choose from a variety of different bagels and meats!"}
{"text":"In a few words, dirty,filthy establishment and people. One man that served me was not only dirty, he was surly. His clothes were filthy, an his fat stomach stuck out from his dirty, ripped, shirt. He looked like he had not bathed in a while, greasy long hair. Thank god he wore gloves when making my bagel. His demeanor was nasty. The cashier also had nasty things to say about some of the bottled drinks thy carried, very unprofessional. No reason to return, to much competition"}
{"text":"I get a plain bagel with cream cheese...pretty basic but this is my favorite place. The cream cheese kind of has a onion taste or something I can't really put my finger on but it's good! I absolutely love coming here because unlike some other places...they make the bagel so it's ready to eat. They put tons of cream cheese on it...just the way I like it and I can eat it on my way to work because it's ready to go lol!

The woman that works in the morning is super friendly and she will remember your order if you keep going back. I like that!

Only bad thing is they close around 3pm."}
{"text":"This store is closed. It looks like another bakery shop is opening up in its place but in case you were looking for Brooklyn bagels at this location it is no more :("}
{"text":"My family and I used to always go to the Green Valley Brooklyn Bagel. This one is not worthy of the convenience. We were served moldy cheese and when we brought it back we were not offered a refund. EW!"}
{"text":"I really liked this place. Made a trip over for lunch. I'm standing outside the door (at 1130) and either they changed their hours or they went out of business. Door is locked. Lights off. Waste of lunch hour."}
{"text":"I'm a regular here about once a week. I love their bagels! I always get the ultimate (egg, cheese, hashbrown, and meat I.e. BACON). You may call ahead to pick up your order to save time and skip the line. They also have a frequent customer punch out card so after 9, get the 10th free. Woot!"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely horrible and I am not a food critic. I like everything. The pancakes are super small and crispy. If you think mcdonalds pancakes are bad these are the worst plus they are expensive. 3dollars for a pancake the size of a tennis ball. They should just call them half dollar fried pancakes. The Newport omelette was runny and salty with nasty American cheese. They use cheap condiments too. The only thing that was reasonable was the bagel. So for the $20 I spent on breakfast for two a bagel was the most edible. Go to egg works down the street if you want good breakfast."}
{"text":"People complain about people and quality of the bagels here. 
I don't understand WHY?
The owner and his staff work hard to make THE BEST BAGEL SANDWICHES IN TOWN!
Einstein comes close to Brooklyn Bagel but the texture of Einstein bagels is a distant second to the Brooklyn Quality!
Brooklyn Bagel has the NEW YORK BAGEL texture and taste. 
Einstein's Jalapeno bagel is greasy. Brooklyn's is PERFECT!

PAUL And your team! BRAVO!!!!!!

I'm proud of you dealing with ignorant customers complaining \"Not enough chicken in a wrap.\" OR asking you to \"Add Bacon\" to a sandwich that already has bacon!\""}
{"text":"I was really excited when Brooklyn Bagel Deli opened up on my very, very short commute to work.  I stopped in almost immediately after it opened, waiting for a freshly toasted bagel with creamy creamy cream cheese to greet me upon my arrival in my office.  I opened up the bag, unwrapped the bagel, took a big bite and....frankly, I was disappointed.  

The sheer amount of cream cheese put on this thing was ri-di-cu-lous.  No one, not a sumo wrestler or a competitive eater, needs that much cream cheese.  The texture of the bagel was off.  I didn't get that slightly crispy then delightfully chewy sensation I look forward to in a good bagel.  It was just a pretty ho-hum experience all around.

Of course, since it is one of three places on the way to work where I can pick up something quick, and the other two rhyme with Cartrucks and HacFondles, I still drop in here once a month or so if I need a carbohydrate pick-me-up so I guess it has to have some redeeming qualities or my taste buds might not just wake up until 10:00 AM."}
{"text":"I love this place, one of the better bagel places in town. I appreciate that they put \"everything\" on their everything bagel on BOTH sides of the bagel! Thank you! And I love the chive spread. Lastly, I like that they cut the bagel into four's. It's the little things in life :) perfect location with Starbucks next door, and great outdoor seating around the corner next to Starbucks."}
{"text":"The best breakfast in the west Las Vegasthey have the best bagels in the best rap for breakfast very clean and free coffee"}
{"text":"What a great find on my last visit to Henderson/Vegas.  The bagels are great by themselves.  Do yourself a favor and order breakfast off the grill.  I tried to the Breakfast Sampler which was your choice of meat (Bacon for me), eggs, hasbrowns, and choice of Bagel or toast.  The bacon was cooked to perfection and nice thick cuts.  The hasbrowns are the star here.  They are diced up potatoes with green onions, and slivers of red onions.  Be prepared to eat as the portions are large.  Super friendly staff.  Will be returning again to try some other items.  Cash and Credit Cards accepted."}
{"text":"Did I go here on bizzarro world day?  The bagel I had was hard as a rock and inedible and all these folks on yelp are raving about it.  Everyone I know that has gone here says that the bagels are bad., and well that is the basis for their business.  If I am going to eat a chain store bagel I head to Einsteins ."}
{"text":"They are now serving full breakfast so we decided to try it... NOT GOOD! The guys working were nice but the breakfast wasn't good. Eggs were over cooked, toast was burnt and the \"hash browns\" are nothing I have ever seen before and didn't taste good either. The prices are similar to good breakfast places like New Day, Coco's, Etc...."}
{"text":"I am a regular. I come every week and the bagels are just nothing like the others in town. Originally from the east coast, BB is the closest thing to a nice chewy bagel from home. 

I get the Tijuana hot. Omg it's amazing. The boys that work are so pleasant and such a great staff."}
{"text":"Great for breakfast bagels.  Real New York feel inside, some of the best bagels in Vegas good prices.  Go here around once a month.  I recommend the original."}
{"text":"One of my new favorite places.  At first I thought this was a typical bagel shop with coffee.  Well was I surprised when I saw the sign that said they had full breakfast.  Anybody that know me knows how much I enjoy a good breakfast.  So I decided to give it a try.  They have a great selection for breakfast, lunch and dinner.  They also have healthy selection too.  The service was great and the food was made fast and fresh.  I order the denver omelet with egg whites and fresh toast (Don't judge me I was hungry).  There wide variety of food selection makes this a must-try spot.  I would definitely recommend Brooklyn Bagel."}
{"text":"This place is the best I go here maybe twice a week on average and I love this place. If you come in be friendly and you will always get friendly service and great food. I always get something not on the menu and the have no problem doing what I want. The food is ALWAYS good!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love their \"Ultimate\" on the \"Everything\" bagel!! Great way to start the day! Friendly staff too!"}
{"text":"Okay so i used to be the biggest Einsteins fan that ever was. But... After a few botched orders on key days (ie my birthday and before tests and job interviews) i left with a bad taste in my mouth.

And then along cam brooklyn deli! Their bagels are fresh, they have an extensive (but quality!) menu, it is close to my house, and has that comfortable locally owned feel. I dont know if they are or not, but it feels as though they are! Like the employees care, they are nice, and the place is always immaculately clean!!

Anyway i recommend eating here for all of your bagel-needs. If you like a kick, try the \"Tijuana hot\" with cheddar, jalape√±o cream cheese, fresh egg (which they cook on a grill! Not microwaved like at other places... Gross!) your choice of sausage, bacon, or ham on your choice of bagel... I go with everything. But hey thats me. 

But seriously, if youre like me and take your bagels seriously and want to be treated with respect (and a naked juice to boot) eat ag brooklyn bagel. It is the best!!"}
{"text":"Amazing greasy spoon! Had the breakfast platter and it was very tasty. Hubby had the steak & egg breakfast burrito and he really enjoyed it. The staff was really nice and it was a great cheap breakfast. Good stuff. Definitely be going back soon."}
{"text":"Just flat out bad. I should have listened to previous Yelper reviews but went here anyways because I didnt want to drive around Eastern looking for a quick breakfast bite. The place is dirty and the guys behind the counter where equally not at par. Ordered the Florentine bagel sandwich on a sesame bagel and it was the worst bagel ever. The cook went skimpy on the egg white and the whole thing was just dry and unflavored.   So heed this warning as I sit on my toilet writing this review (just shortly after eating there). Better off going to Starbucks next door rather than eating their bagels that taste like week old bagels from Food 4 Less."}
{"text":"For a bagel place I would expect a little better quality of bagels. I found the bagels to be dry inside. Also the selection of bagels was somewhat limited. I've been to some major chains that have had many more varieties. They also seemed to be understaffed, with only one person making the food and doing the register."}
{"text":"Why do I even bother coming here? Cause it's the nearest bagel stop to home. The mr loves bagels (cause he's a New Yorker) and not so much me. Not that he thinks this is the best bagel in town just something to satisfy his cravings. I always get the power wrap here but why so stingy on the fillings especially the chicken? I'm going to have to make it at home some day so I won't waste my money on this itty bitty wrap that is 6 or 7 dollars. 

Anyway, my main issue is the guy that works here or maybe owns it. Whatever! He's rude!  First, for being cheap and second, an incident . My family and I stopped before our road trip. We had 8 kids and 6 adults and we stopped in for a quick bite. The guy didn't seem to happy that we were there. I don't know why, we were paying customers and not that my nieces and nephews were being bad or anything. So he yells across way and asked if we were eating in and my bro-in-law replied that he wasn't sure because he wasn't the decision maker. Meanwhile I was observing his attitude towards us the entire time. He just wasn't happy that we were there for some odd reason. We were there 15 min top. 

Ugh! I can't stand that man. He has a bad attitude every time. I personally haven't been back but my husband will go there some times. I try not to give our business there anymore."}
{"text":"I always get The Ultimate breakfast bagel sandwich with jalape√±o spread, mustard, & mayo. It is by far the BEST breakfast bagel I've ever had. I absolutely love this place! Plus they have the stamp cards that ultimately lead to a free bagel sandwich. I totally recommend it!"}
{"text":"Had the Brooklyn bomber (hot roast beef on a bagel) and it was amazing and full of flavor. My wife had the bagel with cream cheese and that was pretty solid as well.  Recommend checking them out for bringing bagels to work.  13 bagels and two tubs of there homemade cream cheese for 16 bucks.  That's a steal!"}
{"text":"Lately I'm preferring this place to Einstein's. Faster, better service, and less crowded. Oh and the cute outdoor eating area this place shares with Starbucks, Roberto's, etc doesn't hurt. My bagel sandwich with eggs and cheese on a salt bagel definitely hit the spot! Love their bagels. 

Loses a star on - gross pink lox spread.. ewww.. lox shouldn't be highlighter PINK. Coffee is nothing special. Brewed coffee isn't nearly as good as Einsteins and their cold coffee is some gross mix crap. They seemed cool with letting people bring in their own starbucks or tropical smoothie from next door, however, so in the future when I'm dining here I'll bring my drink from elsewhere."}
{"text":"Why in the world did We not go here sooner?  Why did we just assume Einsteins was better?  What a mistake we made!  Brooklyn Bagel is the real deal. Fresh made eggs, not the microwaved eggs. Fresh soft bagels. Sandwiches made to order on a hot griddle right in front of you by friendly and hard working individuals. This is the place to go. So glad we gave it a try and we will absolutely be back for more!  Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Never again. Went in this morning before work and asked for 2 blueberry bagels with strawberry shmear. Got to work and had pink regular shmear. I had plain cream cheese so I gave the other bagel to a coworker who thought I was over exaggerating and when she bit into it apologized to me cause there was NO strawberry flavor at all in that pink shmear. Don't know if they colored their plain for Valentine's Day and got them mixed up but that was the biggest waste of $7 in my life. Only got a star cause there's not an option for no stars."}
{"text":"I love this places bagels but it's a shame that I don't want to continue coming here because the man who runs the place has a horrible attitude towards the customers and I was watching the way he talks to his employees. (Poor teens) are getting talked to like they're stupid but they're definitely not. I asked to add bacon to my bagel he responded rudely with there's already bacon, I make the sandwiches as he shakes his head."}
