{"text":"I'm a fan of Korean banquet-style food, so I thought I would try this new place. I had a weekday lunch there.

To confirm other reviews: there are three styles of serving. A buffet of popular Chinese food (broc & chicken, sesame chicken, spring rolls, won ton soup, etc), a collection of fresh meats and veggies that you can cook at your table in the built in BBQ, and another collection of frozen meats and veggies that you can have them cook on a hibachi grill. Each collection is modest in variety, but acceptable. There was also a small selection of sushi. I tried all but the hibachi which I did not see until I had already eaten too much to try another round. Also ice cream and the usual (stale) little cakes you see on buffets.

Overall, I thought the food was very good, and the experience novel. I agree with some comments, like that the BBQ took up so much room that there was little place for dishes on the  table. When I was there, they only had butter, no oils, for use on the BBQ. However, I asked for some oil and they brought some out. I would have recommended that they also include a squirt bottle of water to use with each grill. Service was outstanding -- willing to explain what was on the buffets, how to operate the grill, refilling drinks, cleaning the table from dirty dishes, etc. Everything but the sushi was marked. 

A nit, but I thought the sushi pieces were too big. I expect a piece of sushi to be a bite; these were two (big) bites. But they were not just a tube of rice with dab of filling -- they had well portioned contents. Some unusual pieces as well, such as potato fried sushi. Also, the kimchi was extremely mild, i.e., had no bite at all.

I would go again, especially if I felt like playing with my food."}
{"text":"The staff was rude and did not take very much time to explain the process of cooking your own food.... Yeah, you cook your own food... We thought hmmm this could be fun. It's not.
There is an OK selection of raw meats and veggies and you take it to your table (which has a grill on it; occupying the majority of the table space- hopefully, you weren't looking for a relaxing, comfortable dinner!) I had hot grease splatter onto my brand new shirt. My wife had hot oil hit her neck (leaving an awful little burn!) and a flame hit my hand.
 Did I mention, we got to have this much 'fun' for the low price of $32 for the two of us! On a Sunday afternoon and this included a 20% discount.... Awful- awful- awful.... Hikaido is a much better concept and you get more bang for your buck... EXTREME caution if you chose to try this place...
O the kicker: the folks that own China House in Oakmont own this place. We frequent China House for sushi. On our last visit, we spent about $80 and they gave us a $5 gift certificate for Asian Picnic.... However, they wouldn't let us use this 'gift certificate' becuase of the grand opening discount!"}
{"text":"My friend wanted to get some Chinese food, and I had seen the sign that said Asian Picnic BBQ Buffet posted on route 22, and we hate City Buffet, so we decided to give this a try figuring it was just a normal Asian Buffet.  On their web site, it does show pictures of some sushi, and some chinese buffet type offering, but we went on a Saturday night, and they had no sushi, or chinese buffet items.  For a saturday night, it wasn't very busy either.  There were only about 4 tables of people in the whole place.  Other places in Monroeville, you have to wait for an hour on Saturday night to even get a table, but this place was dead.

So anyway, we get in there, and were surprised to see you have to cook your own food with a grill in the middle of your table.  Kind of an interesting idea, but I would not want to be the owner of that establishment, because I figure eventually someone is going to burn themselves, or not cook their food fully, and the place is gonna get sued.  My friend I was with said underneath his side of the table was getting pretty hot too from the grill.  The server kind of helps you along with your first plate, then leaves you to yourself to the subsequent ones.  The grill is very small though, so you can only cook one persons plate at a time, so it takes a while.  There were only two of us there, so that was a plus, but if there had been a table full, we would have been there all night.

Overall, the food was good, but I would not go back for a few reasons.  One, the price is very high.  It was $14.95 for dinner, which is more than most chinese buffets with a hibachi section.  Two, while it was neat once, I don't really go to a restaurant to have to cook my own food.  If you're going to pay $14.95, you may as well drive 10 minutes to go to Hokaido, which is 100x better than this place.  Or if you really want a good hibachi experience, go to BD's Mongolian grill, which is similar, but they have way more selection, plus they cook the food for you.  Based on the sparse crowd, and high prices, I can't see this place being open for too long."}
{"text":"I spent $20 on a groupon which was a coupon for $40 off Dinner for 4. My family just has 3 in the area right now so I invited a guest. We called before going because I wasn't sure of exactly where is was. No answer, no machine, no message. I figured they were busy so we just headed out. Small sign on the door saying they were closed, will reopen tomorrow. Sign was so small we had to walk up to the door to see it. 

Since the groupon is expires tomorrow, the 3 of us went today. Was told since there aren't 4 of us, I would only get the $20 off (which is what I paid) I said, can't we get $30 off 3 dinners? They said NO. I explained that I came with a party of 4 several weeks ago, but they were closed and had to come today without a guest because the groupon expires. They said, they had a sign up for 2 weeks prior to the day they were closed to let people know. SO???? 

Food was nothing special. This was just a horrible experience. No way to build a business. I just read the other reviews and there was NO sushi or prepared foods except soup and the typical (poor quality) desserts you find on most chinese buffets. I ended up spending an addtional $28. Absolutely NOT worth it! Will never go there again!! Will be telling anyone who will listen, to not go there."}
{"text":"I've been dying to try Asian Picnic, because I love Korean BBQ, and I finally made it there tonight. Sadly, the experience was rather disappointing.

First, there were really no prepared dishes on the buffet except for soups (typical Chinese buffet selections of egg drop, wonton and hot and sour) and two kinds of sushi (avocado/cucumber/cream cheese and shrimp/avocado). I see other reviewers mention things like chicken and broccoli; I assume they must have eliminated these offerings because the price now is $14.95, lower than it apparently was. 

The BBQ meat selection included three types of marinated steak, chicken, white fish, precooked shrimp, octopus, and pork, as well as teriyaki beef ribs. None were great and some looked like they might have been sitting there for a while. Also, no pork belly. At all! The buffet offered a variety of veggies as well, and several sauces in bottles. (The one labeled \"teriyaki\" was actually barbeque sauce, but that was probably just an error.) There were only two types of banchan: kimchi and pickled daikon and carrot.

The dessert selection was small: a coffee-flavored cake, a coconut cake, cream puffs, and vanilla/chocolate/strawberry ice cream. That would have been OK had the cake not been stale as all get-out (I mean, the edges were crispy).

Our server was very friendly and helpful; the grill plate was changed each time we used it, and plates were cleared right away, but that really didn't make up for the lackluster food. The atmosphere is fine; not fancy, but kind of cute in a purple sort of way.

It's unfortunate that the meal was so below par, because I wanted to love it and go back often. That definitely won't happen unless I hear about some changes in freshness and variety."}
{"text":"This place is legit.

As a frequent dweller of Koreatown when in LA, and having a Korean husband, checking out a self-proclaimed \"Korean BBQ\" joint on opening day was a no-brainer (and the 20% off due to said opening day was a plus!). While the inside is dimly lit, perhaps a bit too dim for a lunch/brunch event, the food is not dim in the least.  There is a buffet-style display of fresh fish and meats to choose from that you cook yourself at your table on a red-hot hibachi. Your can choose your own vinegars, oils and sauces to cook with as well. There are also pre-cooked items available (Chinese dishes) if cooking your own food is not your bag, and a few maki rolls if you are keepin' it raw.

As a member of an Asian family, I learned that community food and the experience of sharing food is a monumental event and allows family to comfortably share the events of the day, thoughts, feelings, ect while enjoying traditional cuisine. This place seems to hold true to that tradition. 

The staff was very helpful and attentive, for those new to the hibachi concept. We were pleased to see a nice, diverse crowd of folks in attendance.

As a new establishment, Asian Picnic knows what it is doing. But with every new restaurant, there are always kinks to be worked out. I am trilled that they have opened up here and I can't wait to return, with family in tow."}
{"text":"Decided to try the new Korean BBQ spot in Monroeville and was pleasantly surprised. The idea of cooking our own food on the small hibachi buried in our table seemed daunting at first, but our waitress was very helpful in explaining everything. All the raw meats (beef, chicken, pork, shrimp, squid, etc) and vegetables seemed very fresh and there was an assortment of sauces. 

The sushi choices were rather thin (spicy tuna and california rolls) but fine otherwise.  The traditional Chinese style dishes were very good and there was a decent selection.  The sesame chicken was especially good.  Hard pack ice cream and a few fruits served as the dessert. 

A pretty good value at 14.95$ plus drink. Will definitely be returning. 
The addition of a larger sushi selection would turn this into a 5 star review."}
