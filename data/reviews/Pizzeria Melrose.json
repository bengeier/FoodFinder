{"text":"I love this spot! Amazing and creative pizzas and great people! The owner is constantly checking on his patrons. After going there twice, he recognizes me and comes over to say hi every time."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this new neighbourhood restaurant... we were greatly disappointed!!! Terrible service - ridiculous portion of Arugula salad - three large leaves for $11.00??? We were completely ignored, order came in wrong - when we spoke to one of the owner's on the way out. He shrugged his shoulders and said ...\"bad night - it happens\" (no remorse) He also arrogantly asked us if the pizza was good. Yes it was...but there are many good pizza's in this city. We won't be back."}
{"text":"First time , reserved table for two .. Greeting and reservation went great . 18:30 on Saturday, October 15th, 2016.. On a friends recommendation , drove from little Italy area .. Very easy commute, met, Decarie and right on Sherbrooke and Bing parking a block away ;)!
Had the calamari to start , tender and delicious in red sauce ! Ordered the private import bottle of Spanish wine ( Jumilla, Coso......) great wine for $40.00 .. Had two different pizzas which we shared, potatoe  and sausage both were delicious and added a little house spicy sauce ( hot pepper in oil).. Definitely a home run that potatoe pizza but both were delicious including the meatball pizza from the table next to us !
Music and vibe of the place was great ... The size of the pizza and prices were also good ..
Forgot the name of our waiter but very good and helpful ( tall with short hair on the side and longer on top ) along with Gaspar ( assistant ) who brought out the plates  etc Gaspar was fantastic , made you feel welcome .. Even the pizza guys in the open kitchen were cool and chit chated with them on the way to the washroom ..
Ricotta desert with an expresso ( restritto :) ) 
Highly recommend this place , great vibe and staff + took a walk in the neighborhood afterwards .. Will be back"}
{"text":"Decent pizza for above average price 
Doesn't honor reservations, disappointed considering

Worth checking out alternatives with more reliable service"}
{"text":"Disappointed after initial excitement about a new pizza spot on Sherbrooke Street. There is little to no ambience and mood despite a beautiful local, which has some interesting features (bank vault door leads to coat check in the back). Pizzas were OK, overpriced at nearly $20 each ($17 & $19). Pizza crust was nice and thin, except too thin so it became crispy. Service was ok, though a little impersonal. I wouldn't recommend it nor foresee myself returning."}
{"text":"Last night I brought a party of 9 to Pizza Melrose. It was my second time bringing a party there and I won't be returning. 

We were kept waiting for an hour and a half before being served and the service came with a heavy dose of attitude. 

At one point, our server spilled some wine (maybe a half cup) while pouring.  Not a big deal but I was surprised that there was no offer to compensate or replace the spilled wine. Our table was seated next to the speaker and the music (along with restaurant noise) made conversation difficult. After close to an hour, I rose from my seat to privately ask the server if she might turn down the music. She paused from her phone conversation long enough to tell me (quite sternly) to return to my seat, that she was busy.  When she came to the table shortly afterward and we asked if the music could be turned down, the answer was \" I'll ask but probably not\".  And it was not.  

The pizza finally arrived a good 90 minutes and two or three bottles of wine after our orders had been placed. Half the plates arrived with an announcement from our server: \"don't wait, it's going to be a while until the rest come\".  

The pizzas themselves are overpriced by at least $8 per pizza. Each pizza is about the size of a dinner plate, very thin crust and thinly dressed - so basically enough for one.  Aside from a nice thin crust, this is really not particularly special pizza when it comes to the gourmet variety. The average single person pizza price is $16- $20 when it should be $9 - $12. I ordered the special which was anchovies on white sauce and though I usually devour almost everything, I found this one unappetizing and didn't finish this. The Margarita and the Classique are what I've had before; they are both fine, nothing extraordinary - but quite overpriced. 

I was excited about this place at first. I know the neighbourhood needs a nice pizza place but this one is over-priced, and the service is dismissive and not as respectful as I would have liked.  Instead, I'll recommend Notre Boeuf de Grace for a delicious and much more fairly priced meal that is served by people who want to please."}
{"text":"Beautiful place with quality food made with quality ingredients. 
I've heard a big buzz about the place and I can understand why..
I was very pleased with my meal and the service. 
Wish this establishment many years of luck"}
{"text":"We were looking forward to trying the pizza at this new  place and it did not disappoint, From the decor to the music to the service to the pizza menu, everything exceeded our expectations. My wife had the Carbeau and I had the Classique and both were delicious. Unfortunately, they did not give the same thought to their beer selection. They had the same generic Sapporo brands on tap instead of some great local beers (Boreal, St. Ambroise, Cheval, Dieu Du Ciel..... I could name a dozen more). It would have been nice to enjoy a couple of pints with that delicious pizza."}
{"text":"Fabulous staff and hospitable. Ali was great with checking in on me all night. Frederick is a sweetheart and recommended the perfect digestif. What can I say about Eric - great visual as you sit at the bar. The pizza takes me back to my days on the Amalfi Coast of Italy. #nostalgia #summer16"}
{"text":"We had the appetizer special which was really good as well as some Serrano ham, which was sliced in front of us on a large slicer in the middle of the restaurant and came with some delicious bread.  Then we ordered some pizza which were very tasty and fresh.   Our waiter, while a little pushy, was nice and overall service was fast and efficient."}
{"text":"Avec un joli décor et une excellente pizza, qu'est-ce qui peut mal aller? Un service impersonnel, un gérant à la limite de l'arrogance, un choix de bières en fut famélique et une facture salée peuvent sûrement contribuer à gâcher votre soirée."}
{"text":"I really think they deserve 5 stars.
The place is simple and nicely decorated.
Service was excellent
The entrees were really tasty fresh 
The pizza i took was co-op with eggplant  and i really loved it  
Deserts were excellent"}
{"text":"Best pizza in the area for sure. Not the best I've had but definitely a good pizza close to home. Service was great, very friendly staff and our pizza came in under a half hour on a very busy night. Would come back for sure."}
{"text":"Great pizza place! The service is equally as good as is the ambiance. If you like a great pizza and selection of wines you'll be right at home. 

A must especially if you live in the area. We're here several times per month."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza and salad. I loved the ambience and enjoyed the great service. I'll be back."}
{"text":"I picked up a couple of pizzas and a green salad last night at Melrose Pizza. The pizzas were excellent. However, the green salad at $8.00 is a total and complete ripoff. The lettuce in the salad comes from a pre-washed plastic bag that can be purchased at a local grocery store and there was so little of it. The salad dressing was good, but again so little of it. Not enough to coat this tiny salad. My guess is that the total cost of actual food and salad dressing in this salad is around 10 cents. Never again!

{"text":"I went this venue for a birthday dinner party, the location is ok, there is not much happening around there but if you have a large group 10-20 people they have a nice room downstairs. The appetizers and the pizza was pretty good, if I am around there and I want pizza, I would go back. The cocktails though were disappointing. I wouldn't recommend them."}
{"text":"Finally, a good pizza place in NDG. It was long overdue. Seriously.

This great little spot was just opened up  by Paolo Oliveira (from Brasserie Central and formerly Café Mélies) and his partner Eric. The concept is pretty straightforward: a Montreal style pizzeria that also serves simple yet yummy salads and appetizers, wines and beer.

As far as pizza goes, their pie is super yummy. They don't have a wood-burning oven, but the pizza is definitely as good as any from one. They use simple, high-quality ingredients, and all the flavors are just as they should be. 

The place itself has a modern but friendly vibe. The restaurant sits in a former furrier shop (one of those places that was there for decades and never changed) and the interior features some cute little reminders of the space's former life (re: cow hide seat backs and old signage out front).

This is by far the BEST pizza you will find anywhere west of St-Laurent. I'll be hitting this pizzeria on a weekly basis. Yeah!"}
{"text":"J'adore le local, anciennement une boutique des manteau fourrures et la deco est inspiré du passé ( la peau de vache sur le dossiers des banquettes a été retrouvé dans le local et reintegré au nouveau commence ainsi que qq objets ici et la ).
La pizza a l'air bonne mais j'ai juste pris un dessert avec du thé. Service gentil et lumieres tamisées comme j'aime."}
