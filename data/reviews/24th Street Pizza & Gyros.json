{"text":"I just realized while balancing my checkbook, that this restaurant double charged me in two separate transactions for one food order. I am hoping my bank takes care of the issue that happened on 1/4/16, but I WILL NEVER EVER GO BACK TO THIS PLACE, even though their gyro is quite good as they apparently like to rip you off. BE VERY AWARE OF YOUR TRANSACTIONS IF YOU USE A DEBIT CARD WITH THEM! Better yet, just don't go there, we do not need places in the neighborhood that feel the need to rip customers off. SHAME ON THEM!! Too bad you can not give negative stars!"}
{"text":"I love this place! They have a variety of foods to choose, the people there are so friendly. And the food is awesomely tastey! I've been there a few times, And honestly I don't have a complaint yet! Hope it stays that way."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this neighborhood pizza place, and decided to try it! Ordered the grandmas pizza with fresh basil and mozzarella. It reminded me of an old pizza place we used to eat at and couldn't be happier with this find!"}
{"text":"Good pizza! We love having this joint in the neighborhood. The gyros are pretty good too."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for several years. The first time I ordered a gyro, and have never tried anything else. I LOVE THEIR GYROS! 

This is not a place for gracious dining. It is small with a few table inside and a couple outside. You order at the counter and wait 5-7 minutes for them to make a fresh sandwich with a LOT of meat and a great flavor. I used to order the combo (sandwich, fries and a soda for $6.00, but I'm on a low carb diet and order the sandwich only for $4.99). This is a great sandwich at a great price. When I finish errands today, I'll phone a to-go order in and, with luck, it will be ready when I get there. And the people are nice."}
{"text":"I have ordered from here twice now once on Superbowl sunday and one today. My first order was a chicken gyro, dolmades and hummus. When it arrived EVERYTHING was covered and dripping in the lemon sauce for the grape leaves because apparently putting the sauce in a seperate container is too much for them to do so they dumped it in the styrofoam container. The hummus was bland and gritty and came with no pita bread. and that brings us to today....I ordered dolmades and a chicken gyro meal , I had to specify for the sauce to be put in a seperate container sadly they still put sauce in the dolmades( which were mush and soggy) and some on the side....delivery driver was rude called me twice once to tell me he was at my gate...(good for you now drive into the complex to my apt...) then again to tell me he was outside my apt....(what did he expect me to do? go outside and get my food from him!?) So I paid him. my order came to 21.04 so I gave him 1 ten 1five 4 ones 6 quarters 8 dimes and 1 nickel. I then get a call from the rude owner saying I jipped the driver 1.75...I inform her no I didnt however your rude crap driver only got a penny tip and explained why.  She continues to argue with me stating her driver told her he came back to my apt saying i had jipped him and said I slammed the door in his face. ABSURED!!! He never came back or even called me! I am beyond offended and over this BS I wont be ordering again!"}
{"text":"I had delivery  which went well, however the food and the prices are not that great! The worst gyro I had ever had. It was soggy and falling apart."}
{"text":"ordered online with Grubhub and was pleased with how fast my food arrived which was 30 mins ahead of schedule..  pizza was delicious and the boneless wings were tasty too i had a medium meat lovers pizza me and my dad split  8 thin crust slices very tasty"}
{"text":"this place is AMAZING!!!!! the food is fresh and tasty.  Friendly people and awesome atmosphere.  I definitely recommend 24th street pizza to everyone!"}
{"text":"So I don't leave reviews on Yelp that often... It takes something really really good or really really bad to get me to write reviews on here. 

We've ordered from this place 3 times now and all 3 times we've had an excellent experience. I'm really surprised to see the negative reviews because the food is _REALLY_ good! The pizza reminds us of Z-PIzza which we love. It's not greasy, it's everything we love about Z-Pizza but way cheaper. They have vegetarian options which is huge for us because my girl is vegetarian. She said the falafel was really good. Today I ordered a grilled Italian sandwich and it was one of the most delicious things I've eaten in a while. 

You should absolutely give this place a shot if you havn't already and if you had a bad experience, I'd say give them another try."}
{"text":"LOVED THE GYROS!!! A lot of meat and great Tzatziki sauce! Ive worked around the area for many years and just came across the restaurant while on my lunch break with my co-worker. My co-worker had the pizza and really enjoyed it as well! Im pretty surprised that the previous reviews about the employees because they seems pretty friendly. I told my other co-workers and will be coming back again."}
{"text":"I went here on a whim, my goodness, Margareta pizza, chicken Alfredo pizza, and few places offer gluten free pizza , but 24th pizza and gyros does. Few places offer Alfredo and Margherita pizzas, the hints of spice make  me eat the end crust - so does the flavor of the bread and thickness as well. I've never had a more perfect pizza. This is the absolute best  tasting pizza I've ever had by far. 

The sides are awesome, if I'm low on cash -I'll just take one of the many specials they have for lunch. I don't like to spend more than 6$ for lunch although Friday's I'll go ahead and get 20$ (with  leftovers ) lunches there and have a carb loading lunch for preparation for bulking and excercises over the weekend- leftovers from Friday. So a 20 dollar bill will get you enough bang meal -protein + carb for 2 days.

I like flavor at a very reasonable price, they have that. 

This place deserves much more attention than it's getting. In fact there needs to be a verification  system  in yelp to make sure you've actually been there or are not another owner of a pizza joint nearby trying to give bad reviews to sway opinions so people spend at your pizza place. 

Chicken Alfredo  add broccoli is a carb loading meal that tastes very good. 

By the way, I'm a cat person -and everybody knows  cat people  are discerning as well as smarter than the average angry crab."}
{"text":"We stopped by 24th Street Pizza & Gyros on Saturday night for a piece of pizza. Funny story... I didn't order pizza. I had a gyro! It was delicious, though. The staff here is great, the food was fresh, and the price was right. They have a wide range of dipping sauces, too, that I was dipping my fries in. More than anything I will remember the staff. Oh, and Sheryl got a can of Hawaiian Punch. Pretty much made her night. Would love to come back and actually try the pizza, but we had a great experience and I would recommend this place to anyone. Saluti!"}
{"text":"Honestly I'm such an idiot for going on UberEATS and ordering this without doing research...first of all the hummus taste like thick brick (add some tehini sauce to it and some lemon) or ask someone how to make a creamy delicious hummus #simple or YouTube it #AnotherSimpleSolution for crying out loud. Second off all that's for the \"fresh\" grape leaves or \"dumlar\" or whatever you call them from a can. Yes a can. I'll bet 100bucks it's from a can. I didn't even like the dried chicken. The only thing that was good was the rice and the sauziki sauce.. I literally only ate rice and sauziki sauce and one piece of chicken and one grapleleave...come on #stepItUp let me enjoy your food next time I make a mistake. 
If you care about your Resturant you'll see this message if not then you'll forever be blind"}
{"text":"Ordered a small Hawaiian pizza was told 10-15 mins. Got there in five and it was already made. They threw it back in the oven to warm. Idk, it it was odd, maybe it was pre-made.

It had no taste and was $13 thin crust. Overprice, no taste, bland. Never again."}
{"text":"We probably order pizza from here 2-3 times a month.The pizzas from here are delicious and by far our favorite pizzas to order in the area and I know our friends who have had it when they come over feel the same. They have an awesome chicken Alfredo pizza and Greek pizza. 

I can't speak for the rest of their food because I've only had the pizzas- but I'd recommend their pizza over any other nearby delivery spots."}
{"text":"Been ordering from them for over a year today I ordered and all of a sudden they not deliver to my area .. hmm since when ?? Since you took forever to make my order and now you close in 15 minutes.   I called back to get her name to speak to manager she didn't answer from my number used a different phone she answered and hung up .. ordered from here at least once a week , NEVER AGAIN ! Lazy last minute fuckers !!"}
{"text":"Decent food, fries are super oily, tastes like the fryer oil needs to be changed. Gyro cheese burger is really good!"}
{"text":"Very upset with this place. The food was average and they forgot part of my order. I called immediately in hopes the driver could return quickly. They said they had to wait til he got back. They called back and said it would be over an hour because they had another delivery. I told them I should be the priority since my order was incomplete. Long pause. Then they said, they would deliver it as soon as possible.  They never showed up. What I had was average at best and with the poor service, it's not worth it."}
{"text":"Excellent food, good prices and very friendly owner and employees. I love their philly cheesesteak sandwich! Unexpected little gem and I was very glad to find this place since most chain stores charge an arm and leg for a good cheesesteak, I also like to support GOOD family owned restaurant! Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Great pizza great wings.. I have not tasted any other items but looking forward too. Delivery is slow but that's minor."}
{"text":"We go here often, usually at least once a week. We have tried their pizza, which is great, but the gyros and the grilled italian subs are fabulous. They don't get any better than this, and at a great price. We have never been disappointed with their customer service or their food. Great people who run the business, superb food, nice price."}
{"text":"My first time there today. Pizza was very good. I stopped by on my way home from work. Oliya the owner was super nice. Definitely going back."}
{"text":"The gyros are fine for take-out.
I'd been meaning to check this place out since I moved into the neighborhood about two years ago. It didn't happen until a visiting friend had ordered for delivery. We each had a gyro, and split a salad. It wasn't the best gyro I've ever had, but it was perfectly decent and satiated the craving.
He apparently ordered from here again the following week while I was at work - and had a less than stellar experience with the woman on the phone. Abusive was the term he kept using. What he described was in line with what many of the other reviewers here have shared.
I was recently craving gyro, so I decided to drive there and place a take-out order.
The place is small. The two people working were not at all friendly or happy to see me come in. Also, in no big hurry to approach me to take my order. The man who finally took my order seemed positively stressed that I was ordering a gyro AND a salad. The woman was on the phone with a customer - and I wouldn't necessarily assume she was abusive - just very impatient and having issues with the language barrier. Had I not been raised around a bunch of immigrants and New Yorkers, I may call it abusive, but I guess I have a higher tolerance than some. Still - I did not get any warm and fuzzy feelings while in here, and got no sense of being a valued customer at all.
The food itself was fine. The tzatziki is a little light on cucumber for my taste, but that's just my preference. The meat was juicy, the pita fresh. The small Greek salad was fine, too. Plenty of olives and feta.
I will probably eat here again - as there aren't a whole lot of options for gyros so close to home. I'll just remind myself it's for a decent meal for $10, not for the people or service."}
{"text":"Very authentic Greek foods that take me home! Wonderful service and the prices won't break the bank! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"A whole month later and I am still LOVING this place. It is my new top Phoenix Gyro spot. I have seen it packed the past few times I have been in. I have also gotten a few friends and coworkers addicted. LOVE. Seriously, if you love gyros, try this place. It's a hole in the all but seriously, AMAZING! Their $6.99 meal deal cannot be beat! (I'm having cravings as I write...) Long live authentic gyros! :-)"}
{"text":"I love this place. Everyone is so humble and the delivery is even better. Only thing is the cheesesteak is not a normal cheesesteak. It more chunks of meat (which I guess a lot of people might like), but I wanted the ole fashion slim shaved meat built up and topped with more mushrooms and lots of cheese. Thanks for offering cheez wiz, that is classic. Still very good but I felt like it had less meat this way. I'm still ordering from here in the future. Thanks guys."}
{"text":"Yesterday, ordered delivery on a pizza and 2 orders of boneless wings.  Lady driver delivered wings and pizza.  I tipped her 25% and she walked away.  I opened the wings to discover that they were bone-in.  Ran out to stop her and let her know I ordered boneless.  Her response, \"yes I know.  We ran out of boneless and just gave you these instead.\"  Of course she didn't say any of this when she gave me the wings and took 25% tip off the entire order.  Didn't call before when I made the order to tell me that they were out of boneless (I would have ordered something else, the order was for my wife). 
Driver refunded me the money for the wings, kind of.  Cost was $9.98 for wings, gave me $10.50, which doesn't even cover the sales tax.  Pizza was not very good either.  Spent more money on the delivery fee and the tip, than I did on the pizza.  Shady business practice.  Order from one of the other 1000 places in town; most of them will give you what you order, or at least tell you that they are out of what you ordered."}
{"text":"I should have read the reviews before ordering but in my defense I was pretty drunk.

Let me also mention that I LOVE pizza.. and food.. especially when intoxicated.. so it is very hard for me to not like anything pizza involved.

We ordered on a Saturday so I knew the wait time was going to be pretty lengthy. After an hour of waiting I called to check on the order and the girl who answered the phone was extremely rude. She barked at me that the order was in transit and then hung up! It really isn't my fault that you are working late on a Saturday night... but that's none of my business...

Anywho.. Another 20 mins go by and I finally get a call from the driver saying he is lost... 

After an hour and a half we finally get our cold food... sweet! 

The food... *cringes*.. the pizza was barely edible. It had such a weird taste I can't really describe it. The mozzarella sticks were under-cooked. 

My friend who had way too much wine who was passed out when the food got there.. woke up after smelling food.. took one bite of the pizza and spit it out and yelled what is this?!!

I think you catch my drift"}
{"text":"The owner will not deliver on a $16 minimum - and she's a RUDE PERSON. She hung up on me for telling her what yelp says she will deliver. FALSE ADVERTISING. DONT ORDER HERE BY PHONE!"}
{"text":"I have driven by this place hundreds of times, and each I time I think, \"I should really give that place a try.\"  Well, my curiosity got the best of me, and now I know why they say \"curiosity killed the cat.\"

I absolutely love felafel.  I have eaten felafel in dozens of restaurants in the U.S. and in several countries in the middle east.  I have had the best felafel in the world, and now I think I just tasted the worst.

There were a number of one-star reviews on Yelp, but there were several five-star reviews too.  So, I figured I would see for myself.  Well, when Yelp has an overall low rating, you should believe it.  

Let me say two nice things.  The owners were very cordial, and the pita bread was pretty tasty.  That's it.  The felafel itself was horrible - almost inedible.  The tzatziki sauce was flavorless.   I really only went here because my favorite Greek restaurant didn't open for another two hours, and I was really hungry.  I should have nibbled on some McDonald French Fries until the other Greek restaurant opened.

I didn't try anything else on the menu, and I can tell you now, that I will not try anything else on the menu.  My curiosity has been satisfied.  Believe the Yelp reviews, or take your chances.  Maybe the other food is better, but that's going to be for somebody else to find out because I am \"one and done.\""}
{"text":"We ordered delivery through Postmates last night. Their signature pizza and wings. We added extra Gyro meat, feta and mushrooms to the pizza. It was so so so good!!! We will definitely order that again. The wings were good also, but nothing special. Definitely not bad though. We will be ordering again."}
{"text":"Reviewing for delivery order.  We ordered from my friends house after crashing after an afternoon hike.  My husband is a big fan of Mediterranean food and gyros so we decided to order from here not really knowing anything about the place.  Both gyro he ordered and the greek salad that I had were very good, not the best we have had by any means but very good.  Delivery took less than 30 minutes and food arrived hot.  Very decent spot if I am ever in the area again."}
{"text":"Got a Postmates order tonight.. asked for my pizza crispy and was delivered a completely soggy, not fully cooked, pizza. Had to use my toast oven to finish it off. $25 delivery in the dumps, definitely won't ever be coming in or ordering again."}
{"text":"Great food n awesome hospitality n freshly cook food definitely recommend to others. Reasonable prices n clean."}
{"text":"These guys make a killer pizza!  But what's up with that car with the missing bumper?!"}
{"text":"My gf and I order from there on a regular basis. Their pizza's are very good, we typically get a chicken Caesar or Greek salad as well and it's always very good, but we discovered what we consistently return for and that's the gyro's.

I love gyro's and these are very good! They are exactly as they should be. Very meaty, the pita is always great, fresh veggies and a nice Tzatziki sauce. We get dolma's as well, and though I've never had them served hot before here, they are very good.

Aaaaaaand, the prices are very reasonable and the owners are very nice!

Support local business! 
Support this business!

They are what small business is all about. They serve the community with a smile, and though I'm sure they struggle, they are very consistent and deserve to be successful."}
{"text":"I've ordered from here before and it was ok, not tonight. The chicken was burnt and the fries were soggy and not done. Tried to contact via grubhub and they said the fries are cooked like that out of \"preference\". Um, NOBODY prefers uncooked fries. The delivery guy was also super rude for no reason. Called me for directions to my house then got an attitude when he couldn't find it. Never ordering from here again."}
{"text":"I ordered take out the spaghetti and meatballs and the sauce tasted literally out of a can and so did the meat balls. What a waist of money I took one bite and threw it away couldn't it that garbage."}
{"text":"Garbage. Ordered here THREE times and the pizza is beyond dry, tasteless, and always over cooked. The order is never right either, no matter how many times you make sure. Not ordering again."}
{"text":"OMG - Their Gyro Pizza with white sauce is amazing. The only thing we don't put on it is the green peppers (husband doesn't like). Gyro sandwich is as good as you can get outside of a Greek neighborhood. So far we've only had deliveries and the service is great. Looking forward to trying their Manhattan Chicken Burger."}
{"text":"*This review is based purely on a delivery order*
Being a gyro lover, and with all of the competition out there, I would not choose this location to satisfy my gyro cravings.  The gyro meat was at the right temperature, texture, and flavor, but otherwise lacked any distinguishing characteristics.  The fries that were ordered along with the gyro were lifeless and bordering soggy, the house salad was merely a small bag of shredded lettuce with no dressing, and a few sprinklings of feta.  Furthermore, we had to wait more than an hour for our food to be delivered (delivery order), when all we had were two gyros, fries, and a salad.  The restaurant being less than a mile from our home, and no one communicating or trying to make up for the delay, left a bad taste in our mouths."}
{"text":"This place is not good at all if it's late and your drunk then ok but other than that NO. When I picked up my pie I asked for a lot of peppers and some parm cheese. I was given two pepper packs and told (by the owner) that the pizza has cheese on it already. WHAT A JERK."}
{"text":"I love this place, it's such a cute hidden gem in Phoenix. The pizza, calzone, cheesy garlic bread, and the baklava are so delicious! The owners are the cutest friendliest people that you can tell put their heart and soul into each dish."}
{"text":"Pizza is amazing . Awesome home made sauce nice toppings . Highly recommend this place ."}
{"text":"Late night pizza? This place is the perfect choice. Open late and great customer service.  but remember, it is *late night* pizza"}
{"text":"Disappointed... gyro was dry, didn't bring extra sauce that I paid for, chicken Alfredo is more like noodles and chicken, maybe a teaspoon of Alfredo. And lastly, brought me the wrong soda......"}
{"text":"Nasty food. Don't eat here. I got the caesar (thank god I didn't get a large), it tasted like I licked a piece of wood. I also got sweet potato fries. Soggy and tasteless. They ever forgot some of the food when they delivered. Ew"}
{"text":"\"...It's a good gyro, I mean you won't tzatziki in your pants, but it's a good gyro...\"

If looking for a quick bite at a fair price, 24th St Pizza & Gyro has a solid gyro in a great location.  There is plenty of good to say about their gyro; savory meat, plenty of fresh onions and tomatoes, dressed in a becoming tzatziki sauce.  I only mention the pizza because they do; sometimes one can get it on special for a $1 a slice and it's worth a buck.  There is room to sit, but on a warm day, it's kinda hard to cool the place down.  On a cool day, they have a couple few tables outside that make sitting for a moment worth it.  Otherwise, order it to go, where you can get the beverage of your choice as they only have 12ounce cans of cola with the combo; no fountain drinks also means no free refills.  They advertise delivery; I can't speak to it because 24 P&G has been thus far a location easy for me to dart in, order, and go.

To Whom It May Concern:
A decent business man said to me once, \"...find your niche, don't try to be everything to everyone, find your niche and be the best at that...\"  The gyro here is solid.  Enough so, that I wonder if it was the focus, perhaps with a walk-up take out window, maybe even a drive through, pushing the convenience of grabbing a savory gyro on the fly, with a fun approachable curb appeal, if this couldn't be a sustainable midtown gem.  Granted this is an impractical suggestion as remodeling can be expensive, or impossible if one doesn't own the building, but the gyro is good and the location is prime for hungry central valley Phoenicians looking for a quick inexpensive savory bite."}
{"text":"Ordered a margarita pizza thinking it was going to be a regular marg pizza but instead it's just a regular pizza with tomato slices on top. A margarita pizza has fresh mozzarella, basil, and tomato slices with olive oil instead of sauce. The garlic knots I ordered were burnt as well. I will never order from this half-ass pizza place again."}
{"text":"Their gyro pizza is pretty fantastic. It's the only thing I've had there, but it keeps me coming back. Their delivery is always prompt as well. So that's a bonus."}
{"text":"Great gyros, speedy delivery, and the food is always consistently great. The Greek pizza is delicious, too!"}
{"text":"Have it a shot. They were nice and friendly but the gyros was skimpy on filling and not that tasty.  If anyone knows a gyros...that's another story.  Much tastier and more filling in other spots."}
{"text":"Love this place. The food is delicious and the service is outstanding. I would definitely recommend this place. Where else can you order pizza and gyros?! Yum..."}
{"text":"Delivery is lackluster at best, but the gyros are great.  Pizza is mediocre at best, but I'm from Brooklyn so I'm somewhat of a pizza snob."}
{"text":"We were looking for a better local pizza place and were very happy with the results. Fresh, hot, loaded pizza and earlier than expected. Looking forward to exploring the rest of the menu soon. Thanks."}
{"text":"maybe the only place with late night delivery in the area. Got wings and fried mushrooms. They were enjoyable."}
{"text":"So I ordered some food for delivery via GrubHub, as expected during dinner time the wait time was just about an hour. 

I ordered at about 7 and some time passed when 8:20 had rolled around. The food hadn't arrived yet! 

I gave them a call to find out if the order was on the way and I spoke with a lady who was kind but unfortunately did not see my order because the fax didn't come through. 

While that isn't necessarily a reflection on the restaurant itself it just kind of sucked. I let it go - she was empathetic and told me that the order would leave the store in 20 minutes. 

Around 9 the order showed up and I went and grabbed my food from the driver at my gate. Upon opening the food I was surprised of the portion size. You definitely do not get what you pay for. While I don't mind spending $12 on a gyro platter I definitely thought it was a given that it would include at least one pita. The felafel was alright though. $4 for a small salad? No thanks.

While I definitely don't have a problem with the customer service of the restaurant, I don't think the food is worth the price."}
{"text":"Try it all, I love this place!!! The Baklava is so good! And gyros have tons of meat!! And the customer service is always pleasant!"}
{"text":"It's too bad this place has changed ownership. We stopped in the other day for their advertised Pizza Slice special (I think it was two slices and a soda for $3.99). My husband walked up to the kid at the register and said,  \"Two slices of cheese, please.\"

...silence...

...blank stare...

The kid grinned uncomfortably and said, \"Cheese? Two slices? Umm...\"

I realized what was happening and interrupted: \"Two slices of cheese PIZZA, please.\"

The kid finally understood. He thought my husband wanted two slices of cheese. Literally. 

So finally the woman (owner?) came up and asked pretty abruptly what we wanted. We told her, and she said she doesn't keep slices ready, she has to make a whole pizza and then cut slices. She clearly thought we were retarded. 

We left. 

So, besides the obvious customer service and advertising failures, my third criticism is that they need to decide on an identity and stick with it. Are you a gyro place or a pizza place? That, in my opinion, was the downfall of the previous owner. He should have stuck with gyros and other Greek items, because he did them well. The place is too small to try to please everybody."}
{"text":"We ordered delivery through grub hub and were missing an item, the restuarant wouldn't deliver the missing item but said we'd get a refund in 3-5 days. Not the best experience."}
{"text":"This place is terrible! I ordered my food and the lady said it would be 50 mins. It's been an hour and a half and the place is now closed and we have no food and they already charged my card! I called 4 times and someone finally picked up and the lady was rude to me! I will never order from here again and I encourage anyone that reads this to stay away!"}
{"text":"We just had delivery to our hotel while visiting from out of town. This is some of the best gyro-style Greek food I've had outside of Astoria, Queens. The dolmades are warm and obviously hand-made (which is rare for gyro joints; they're frequently from a can). The tzatziki is garlicky and also home-made. The salad dressing for the Greek salad had lots of lemon flavor."}
{"text":"They actually make decent pizza, considering it's next to a liquor store and also considering a fair number of derelicts shuffle around this part of Phoenix regularly.
The cashier is very friendly. And the average wait time for a pizza is less than 12 minutes. Almost perfect crust-toppings ratio."}
{"text":"Ok as much as I HATE to leave a bad review for a small mom and pop place, I have to do it. I read the reviews after ordering and I certainly should have looked it up first before placing an order through grubhub. 

I called the store right after delivery and first asked if they would come pick it up and refund my money because I feel like paying 20$ to eat rice was a bit much, alas they said oh we will take care of you Next time, because you know, This time doesnt matter! It really stinks because we do order a lot, we work at home and happen to be lazy when it comes to matters of cooking, so we order pretty much every single day, thats a lot. 

Ordered delivery 1 gryos entree and 1 baklava for about 20$ including tip and delivery. Now for that price, I would expect an average gyros meal, I am not expecting the persian room in quality, but it should be edible and the portion should be enough for 1 adult. 

Gyros Entree - The amount of gyros meat was laughable, so much so that I took a picture of it and sent to the hubby and asked, hey did I order a gyros plate or a rice place? There was about a handful of gyros meat, basically what fits in one palm. The rest of the container was 50% rice, 50% fries. The rice was fine, you cant really mess up rice can you? The fries .. well soggy, tasteless cardboard that has seen much better days. Now the sauce, who doesnt love a good tzatziki sauce, at least the tiny handful of meat should me made better with some creamy delicious sauce, but wait .. theres more! This tzatziki sauce was water with 5% yogurt and 95% sadness. 

Baklava--- Again, soggy, tasteless bland . Could only eat 1 forkful and decided to stop 

So this place is Perfect if youre on a hospital restricted diet to only eat white bland food cause you will get a lot of that. If you happen to have any sort of appetite or taste buds, I would pass. 

For the owners, I would seriously suggest taking a look at what your customers are saying and instead of taking it as an attack, take it as a way to improve and get more business because as it is right now, I personally would never pay to try it again, I dont think I would even eat it for free. 

So if youre in this vicinity, check out Georges Gyros as they have always been good, the meat is hot and plenty and the sauce is awesome,  but unfortunately do not deliver =("}
{"text":"Great pizza when they get your pizza right!!!  Called in, said they would credit me a pizza, called back... \"no notes, can't do anything\". By the way I'm allergic to mushrooms!"}
{"text":"Ordered a chicken gyro and it came with what had to have been about two ounces of chicken. There was more onion than meat. Their food has traditionally been ok but gone downhill. Many other choices nearby where you at least get your money's worth."}
{"text":"I ordered from 24th Street yesterday evening from my work place. The food item ordered was the Shish Kabob and two Baklavas. I received the food in a timely fashion, however, the Shish Kabob which is supposed to be tenderloin was anything but \"tender\". If I were ever in any danger of bodily harm all I'd need to do is to arm myself with those \"tender\" loins and throw them at my attacker. They are so hard that I could knock anybody unconscious with them. So, obviously, I won't be ordering from this place again. ;)"}
{"text":"I'm glad I tried this place because I've passed it on 24th a few times and have wondered if it was any good. I ordered delivery from the yelp app and got $5 off! Woohoo! That's always nice. The order arrived about 10-15 minutes earlier than expected as well. The gyro pita was pretty good, that alone I'd give 4 stars. The pita bread was soft, the meat had good flavor, the veggies were fresh and the Tzatziki was delicious. I really love tzatziki so I always order a couple extra sides (0.75 each) and well worth it in my opinion. I also wanted to try the falafel so we ordered just a side which they gave us 3 pieces. It was a bit dry and hard, I didn't eat them. Maybe if that's your style you would like them? Lastly, we got a side of fries with gyro meat on top. In hindsight I can see how this would be a bad idea. The fries just soak up all the grease and turn into a soggy greasy mess. The gyro itself was very good and I appreciate the good customer service and ease of ordering."}
