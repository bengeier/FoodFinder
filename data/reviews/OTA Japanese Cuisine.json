{"text":"I decided to try this place out because I'm a sushi lover and this used to be one of my favorite Chinese restaurants. 

First of all, the service sucks, the waitresses could be a little bit nicer and they should smile when fretting customers.  My friend ordered a coke and when it came it had a piece of green onion in it and when we told the waitress, she didn't even say anything or even apologized to us. Then came my Maki Bento on a simple white plate... The sushi were wrapped poorly and they came in different sizes. The seaweed was soggy and not crispy. I also found a piece of plastic wrap in my sushi. 

The only reason I gave them two stars was because of the reasonable price."}
{"text":"Like many other reviewers on this site, I believe you have to go to a \"new\" restaurant several times before you can have a solid opinion.  That's because the \"growing pains\" or \"Training Anxieties\" normally set the lasting impression which really isn't an accurate reflextion of a new restaurant's potential.

So here goes.  OTA was a \"Re-birth\" of the Fantasy Eatery restaurant that I loved so much.  The owners are the same, the wait staff is the same (though they had to hire more), and the value is even better now.  The difference is, they have moved it from a common family restaurant into the level of a nice sushi AYCE resaturant.  That move, was definitely for the better.

It took them less than 1 week to transform the restaurant...new decor, new staff, new menu, new chefs, and new uniforms.  Very nice touches all around.

Since the opening (3 months???) I've been there at least twice a week.  Yes...that would amount to about 30 times.  That's how much I like it!  

So before I go on to why I like it so much, please note I have only gone there for lunch, and have only ordered their lunch specials.  I work in the area...so this is a great lunch place!

There are 3 main reasons for the 5 star rating:
1)  Good food (you have a choice of about 24 lunch specials, from sushi & sashimi,to bento boxes, to rice & noodle dishes) 
2) Fantastic Price:  All lunch specials are $7.99-$8.99, and they have had a 15% off promotion for the last 2 months!  This means your lunch comes to $9-10, tax and tip included!!!!
3)  Nice clean environment (for a Chinese restaurant selling $7-9 lunch dishes, this is a very pleasant surprise).

With the lunch specials, you alwasy get a miso soup, a small salad, Chinese tea, and a choice of pop!  yep...the free pop is just another $2 you didn't have to spend!  

They automatically put on a 10% service charge, but that's OK....we usually tip 15-20%....so I personally think they are doing a dis-service to themselves by limiting it to 10%.  But this is a Chinese area, so maybe they're just happy they get 10% ;-)  The last few times my buddy and I ordered two $7.99 lunch specials and the bill came to just over $16 with tax and tip (accounting for the 15% promo, and the 10% service charge), we just gave them $20 and left happy.  So maybe they're onto something...with actually getting a 30%+ tip this way!!!

I would recommend the \"Salmon Lovers\" lunch special.  for $7.99 you get 4 pieces of Salmon Sushi, 4 slices of salmon sashimi, and a 6 piece salmon roll.  yep...that's 14 pieces for $8!!!  and with the 15% off, you're looking at less than $7, and you still get a soup, salad, tea, and pop!!!  You can't beat this type of value anywhere!  You can't even buy pre-made sushi at Michelangelo's at the end of the day at this price!!!  And all this for a sit-down meal!

Other notable mentions are the Maki Box (you get 18 rolls total, and it's really a plate, not a box...but they call it a box), the Beef Ribs Bento ($8.99), the sirloin beef bento ($8.99), and the Chicken Teriyaki Bento Box ($7.99).  The latter two come with 2 large pieces of meat...so it's very filling.  Almost forgot...the Salmon bento is great too ($7.99) because you get two 1/2 inch thick salmon 1/2 steaks!  That's a phenomenal deal!

The only thing I didn't particularly like was the Pork Cutlet bento box ($7.99).  You get 2 pork cutlets...so lots of food...but it was a bit dry.  by the time you get to the 2nd pork cutlet, your jaw is just plain tired.  I found I had to dip it in sauce, or drink lots of tea/pop to finish off the dry cutlet.  But to their defense...it is a breaded and fried pork chop...so how juicy could it be, right?

Also to note...all bento boxes comes with a 6-piece roll.  And they don't cheap out and give you cucumber...they actually give you 3 salmon and 3 california pieces.  So you don't have to give up sushi when you order a bento box...you still can get your fix!

Now about service....we particularly like 1 of the original waitresses from the Fantasy Eatery days...she's nice, and very pleasant.  Also very attentive and quick.  The new ones....well, let's just say they are above a typical Chinese restaurant, but still need to smile more.  They are good servers, don't get me wrong, but they really don't engage in any converstaion or anything.  They just take your order, bring you your food, and then your bill.  maybe I'm expecting too much...but if they smiled more, that would be the icing on the cake.  When they first opened, they were disorganized and very nervous....but now, they are like clock-work, so no more growing pains on the service side.

As I mentioned before....I have not tried the dinner AYCE, but they seem to be doing well because they told me they are packed with a line-up on weekends!  

So if you're looking for a quick and fast lunch, and just need that sushi fix and you only have $10 in your pocket....this is definitely the place!!!

NOTE: It's Cash Only!  So don't get caught off-guard!"}
{"text":"This is my first visit at Ota and let me say I was not too impressed. This used to be Fantasy Eatery which was my favorite Chinese family style restaurant! This was our go to spot for all of our family celebrations. When I heard that it was still the same owners running the restaurant I thought it can't be that bad.. Fantasy Eatery had pretty high standards when it came to their food! I was truly surprised when our food came out. I wonder how this place have been getting so many great reviews when they can't even get a simple cucumber roll or California roll right! The pieces of fish in the sushi was inconsistent and presentation wise it didn't look that great. Service was ok I guess the waitress wasn't tentative enough to notice that she had served us a glass of coke with a green onion sprinkled on it. 

The reason why I am giving this place a 3 star is because the decor is great, and the value is good for someone who really don't care about the presentation and how their sushi tasted. Our lunch bill came to $35.38 for 4 people including tips. That works out to be a little under $10 per person! 

By far Akabane on Bayview is still one of my fave AYCE sushi restaurant!"}
{"text":"Ota Japanese Cuisine is another AYCE Japanese Restaurant opened in Richmond Hill's Times Square Mall.

I have here for lunch and you do have the option of having their Lunch AYCE ($13.99) or Lunch Box ($7.99/$8.99). 

Sushi Lunch ($7.99) comes with Soup/Salad/Dumplings/Pop
- Salad is with Thousand Island dressing which I dislike... though the salad itself is fresh.. for me just anything that is soaked in Thousand Island dressing is a no no
- Dumplings are the best of the meal: pan fried fresh and have vinaigrette for dipping which were quite good
- Sushi is not bad.. especially at that price point! Can be a little fresher...
- Iced Lemon Tea is way too sweet, just like drinking sugar water...maybe just stay with pop...

Please beware that 10% service charges are automatically added even for set lunch... I can understand if I order AYCE... but lunch bento box??

Dinner $22.95 and extra $2 on weekends and holidays... though they are having a buy 3 get 1 free special.... 

PS Why do people always like to do some maintenance work while I'm eating in restaurants... I know they are putting some final touches.. but why putting up wall boards right next to me while I am eating my sushi??"}
