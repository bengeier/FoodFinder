{"text":"I went to the restaurant another time since I was in the area and was even more impressed by the service and food. I got a bento box this time and the amount of food and the quality was second to none. The consistency of this restaurant makes it one of my favourites of all time."}
{"text":"This place serves one of the freshest sashimis I've ever had. The restaurant is clean and looks modern. The service was fast. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This place has the best Sushi. Everything is really good. We usually get some sushi and some Chicken Udon. They also have this Japanese Pancake, don't know what's in it but it was damn good. Friendly service and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"My son and I have been coming here for lunch and dinner since it opened. Still a favourite!"}
{"text":"My friend and I came here for dinner on a Saturday night. I was going to choose a bento box, but my friend wanted the AYCE option. The waitress kindly informed us that the AYCE option is only available if the entire party chooses it; quite understandable.  The AYCE selection may not be as exhaustive as other places, but the portions are quite good. Ordering is done in the old-school fashion: Dictation to the waitress.  Both waitresses that night were courteous, efficient and friendly. Announcing what is being dropped off at the table is a good skill that is being used; how many times have you wondered what you just received at other restaurants?  As the restaurant is on the smaller side, you may wish to make a reservation (especially if you have a larger party).  This just might be the sushi spot for my friends and I in the Port Union area now! Give it a shot."}
{"text":"This sushi place is great! I frequently order takeout from here. It comes pretty quickly and the prices aren't too bad. Would recommend the Volcano Roll and Golden California Roll. Servers are very nice too."}
{"text":"Honestly, a little disappointed. Portions rather small and miso soup was rather flavourless. Tuna and salmon roll were both average. The California roll was good however. Won't be back."}
{"text":"This place is in the middle of nowhere! It's surprisingly good though.   I went with a couple friends after a hard day of work, having worked up a huge appetite. The waitress was very accommodating with our endless requests for water. We got 2 orders of assorted tempura, a 46 piece platter with Nigiri, sashimi, and assorted rolls. We also added an extra Dynamite roll for good measure, which came to around $60 before tax.   Thankfully we didn't have to wait too long. Tempura was crispy and hot with the right amount of batter, and all the fish was quite fresh. My biggest complaint of the evening is just that they split the platter up into 3 parts so it was less visually appealing (which is super nitpicky, but all of us were hoping to be blown away by the size of it!). Service was solid throughout the meal. They didn't use too much rice for their rolls or nigiri which is great as well. The dynamite roll was particularly good and I plan on having it again when I go back when I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"I live in Port Union and hadn't tried this place yet, so when my girlfriend offered up this place for dinner on a Saturday night ,I had to take her up on it and I am so glad I did! There wasnt anyone else dining in when we arrived so we just sat down at a table near the front.   They have a lot of great options for rolls ranging from the basic to the more advanced.   My girlfriend ordered the Golden California Roll and the Dynamite Roll. I tried one of the Golden California pieces and I quite enjoyed it. They used a nice light and flaky tempura batter so it wasn't too heavy or oily.  I ordered the Hawaii Roll and the Rainbow Cheese Roll. I was very impressed with my choices. The Hawaii roll or usually known as Philadelphia Roll is my go to roll at any sushi establishment. I definitely give them points for creativity with the Cheese Roll, every piece was so good!! I had never tried anything like it before and will come back just for this roll.   Service could have been a bit more attentive, but overall they are on point with their sushi!"}
{"text":"Been ordering takeout here for two years now and always impressed with the quality and speed of service. Reading the other reviews and I had no idea they also offer AYCE. I'd definitely want to try it out"}
{"text":"I went here for dinner Sunday and I was not disappointed. Not only has the restaurant been renovated and beautiful but the food was amazing. We always have fast and friendly service. My family's favorite is the All You Can Eat Menu. In a word Superb!!!! I highly recommend this hidden gem in Scarborough. You will not be disappointed!!!!"}
{"text":"Service was amazing. It wasn't very busy. They have takeout. Food was delicious.  They have all the popular rolls and common foods at an all you can eat but the flavour is much better than your all you can eats"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem! Tucked away in a strip plaza this place just happened to catch my eye as was I getting my nails done in the same plaza. This place has a wide variety of Japanese specialties. The sushi is always fresh! Cozy atmosphere and really friendly staff.  The vegetarian bento box is my go-to!"}
{"text":"This place will always be my favourite sushi joint. Everything her is sooo good and i have seen this place come a long way. I definitely always recommend this place to everyone and no one is ever disappointed."}
{"text":"Great sushi.  Staff are always friendly.  Never had bad food from here.  They changed their salmon sushi combo so it isn't the perfect meal any longer but still very good."}
{"text":"Sushi is quite mediocre, almost quality you'd get at a grocery store or mall. It is slightly cheaper though, so you get what you pay for. Probably not coming back."}
{"text":"My first visit to this restaurant was pretty impressive! Definitely among the best AYCE sushi locations in the Scarborough area especially based on the price.   I ordered many of the appetizers. The tempura items I tried were great - especially the tempura shrimp. Amazing, light and crispy! Loved it. The tempura crab was unique and I enjoyed a few pieces. Haven't seen that at other places before! The only downfall - the deep fried scallops. They looked like they were from a box of frozen, processed foods. The texture was not very favourable at all - like sticky mush inside. Not a big deal, only had two, just won't order those again next time! Wouldn't recommend that specific appetizer for \"scallop connoisseurs\"!  The sushi rolls we ordered were great. They were neat, texture was right, taste and variety was very excellent! Big points for that. Definitely a lot of different rolls to choose from, something for everyone. I believe that even people trying for the first time will find something they're comfortable with trying!  One thing that really stood out to me is that many of the other guests that were there were repeat customers or even regulars at this place. I overheard from other guests' convo with the waitresses and other guests' convo among each other, this is a place where people feel welcomed and treated well.   The waitresses were friendly and very personable. Easy to chat with and not intimidating when asking questions. We were checked on just enough to feel taken care of, not excessively. Lots of smiles and prompt service.   Really can't go wrong visiting this restaurant! Try it out! Enjoy :)"}
{"text":"I come here quite frequently and it never disappoints! Parking is easy and service is never an issue.   The food is really fresh, I've done both take out and dine in and I never regret it. I have tried quite a few of their Bento boxes and I'm obsessed with their Salmon Lover dish! They even offer brown rice!  In a nutshell they are consistent with their food, their service and offer competitive prices! I cannot complain with that"}
{"text":"One of the hidden gems in Scarborough! It's a great sushi restaurant that you wouldn't expect to find in this area. Sashimi was fresh, the presentation was beautiful and the good in general tasted great! Highly recommended. They have a promo right now where you can buy a membership card for $10 which gets you 10% off forever (no exp date!) and you will get $10 worth of coupons on top of that. Not bad if you're a frequent diner!"}
{"text":"This is it.  This was the last chance that Azumi sushi had to redeem itself but it failed miserably.  I've had take outs from here many times and it's just sad.    I love fresh fish and what they serve is quite frankly subpar.  We ordered the Chirashi (simply terribly quality fish with imitation crab meat - really?!), some a la carte nigiri (hamachi, ika and scallops which smelt funky), some torched sushi appetizers (sad excuse for aburi sushi and both technique and quality of fish used), deep fried chicken wing appetizer (drizzled with unwelcome spicy mayo sauce), tempura appetizer (a-ok) and edamame (a-ok).    The problem with their fare is largely in the lack of freshness of the fish and it's so noticeable that I can't believe there are so many reviews that claim Azumi serves up fresh fish.  Basically most of the fish we ate had an unmistakable texture of fish that have been improperly thawed, almost spongy to the bite and tasting way too watery.  The sushi rice lacked flavor and absence of wasabi in our sushi just made things worse.  To add insult to injury, Azumi still serve up their fare with the neon pink pickled ginger.  Enough said.    This disappointing dinner set us back $68 which is not horrible for a mediocre Japanese meal but for what we ate tonight, it's just highway robbery.  I will never set foot in this joint again."}
{"text":"Located in a small plaza with a good amount of parking and most likely near a highschool. Came on a weekday during lunch hours and the place was filled with young and hungry teenagers. Service was still pretty decent.   Got the chirashi for $12.99 which is basically assorted sashimi on a bowl of rice. The sashimi was fresh and came in a pretty decent portion size. The sashimi that were included: tuna, salmon, red snapper, red clam and some processed crab. Meal came with they typical salad and miso soup. Everything tasted good but I have definately had better chirashi dishes that have way better sashimi options like uni and salmon roe.   Not too sure if this is authentic Japanese place as I could hear with workers speaking Cantonese."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years & tbh it's been a bit of a roller coster. For the last few years though it seems they have finally figured it out. It's the only Japanese place in the neighbourhood. The food is a decent price for the amount of food you get but nothing great or anything. The food has been good for the last few years, fresh & tasty. The menu has a goof selection on it. The service has been good also for the last little bit. It use to be a nightmare to be honest. I'm happy they upped their game."}
{"text":"I decided to finally give this place a try. It's close to home and I had a craving for Japanese food.   I have to say. The experience was just \"meh\".  I won't be back.   I ordered the beef teriyaki lunch special, veggie tempura and an order of salmon skin maki to go.  The miso soup was flavourless. So, it went uneaten.  The veggie tempura was ok. It was a bit heavy and the dipping sauce also lacked in flavour.  I love tempura, but I could not finish it.  I've had way better tempura elsewhere.   They packed the salad with the hot food so it was warm and wilted. That didn't get eaten either.   The egg rolls and beef tempura were also lacking in flavour.  I had to add a whole package of soy sauce and schiracha to the beef tempura to eat it.    The sushi was ok. With the beef teriyaki special came 3 cucumber, 3 salmon and 3 California rolls. Plus I also had the salmon skin rolls. The rice was heavy but seasoned.  The sushi was probably the best part of the meal, yet I'd rate it a 6/10.  So all-in-all, a disappointment. I've had way better miso soup out of instant soup paks and better teriyaki and spring rolls from shopping mall food courts.   If you like good Japanese food, don't waste your money or time here.  If you like \"cheap\" mediocre Japanese food, grab a lunch special because you get quite a bit for the price. Just don't expect it to have flavour."}
{"text":"Clean place, good looking place and dishes. Professional staff. Love their lunch menu and presentations for some of their dishes.  I think it's a bit more expensive than other places and the selection isn't versatile. Also, it's not all you can eat."}
{"text":"I'm often in this area, and have come here quite a few times to form what I hope is a very solid opinion. Despite being in a sketchy strip plaza, the inside is nicely decorated and the music is very therapeutic (until you're there a few times and realize they only seem to have 10 songs on constant repeat). The place is never very busy, and I've been here once or twice as the only customer in the restaurant (typically getting dinner at 7 or 8 on a weekday).  My go-to order for this restaurant is usually a bento box, either the chicken teriyaki or chicken cutlet, as it is very filling and pretty cheap (comes with white rice, 9 sushi pieces, Asian citrus salad, miso soup and 2 spring rolls). However, I have come to realize that this place is fast food with a twist; the food is well cooked and then just dumped in a sauce or batter, instead of marinated and injected with flavour. I always thought the tempura here was okay, but once I tried Makimono's tempura, I was blown away by the difference in flavour. The tempura here has no taste whatsoever and must be completely dunked in the accompanying sauce to really absorb the flavour.   Many times when I or a friend have ordered bento boxes, the sushi arrives first and looks like it has been just thrown together; the rolls are not tight and sometimes there are toppings falling out of the inside.  I have yet to try the specialty sushi rolls because of how sloppily these ones are made. The miso soup is basic, and the teriyaki chicken is simply chicken with a lot of sauce thrown on top, but no real flavour.  Service is mediocre; they'll run to get you something if you need it, but often times the staff are loudly speaking to each other and laughing in the kitchen while you're dining and it's hard to get their attention when there's nobody on the floor. Usually they just check on you to bring you the menu and then the food, and then they disappear.   tl;dr: If you're looking for cheap 'Japanese' food, a nice atmosphere and an hour or two to burn, this is the restaurant to go to."}
{"text":"Very good...had the golden California roll and spicy salmon sushi. Come 2 hours before closing if you plan to go late."}
