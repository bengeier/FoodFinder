{"text":"Not bad, not bad at all. Now my second favourite smokehouse, after La Boucan. All the meat was fresh and flavourful, the service was friendly. Two small problems - the decor, it still feels like the old fashioned italian restaurant it used to be and the beer choices - no local microbrewery beers just molson/coors style crap.
If you're in ndg this place is miles ahead of Bofinger."}
{"text":"So satisfied with our meal this evening. Pitmaster board, salmon and chicken/ribs, mac and cheese and bacon sprouts. All amazing. The staff were pleasant and helpful, most accommodating. Will be going again, no doubt."}
{"text":"I was craving ribs so we decided to visit this place. We ordered half a rack of ribs which came with cornbread , coleslaw with some pickles and fries. My s/o ordered fried chicken with waffles. OMG the ribs were the most tender and juiciest ribs I have ever had. The cornbread and the coleslaw were also very good. I also tried my bf's meal. The waffles though... omg I can eat that for a snack. They were very greasy but so delicious! The fried chicken was excellent, perfect crisp and seasoning. I wish there was more sauce on the ribs though... I guess I could've asked but I was too shy."}
