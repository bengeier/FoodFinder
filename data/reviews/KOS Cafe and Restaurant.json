{"text":"The chicken quesadilla is huge greasy goodness!  Small place - you certainly don't go for the \"ambiance\", but the patio during the summer is decent. There's 1 awesome server, but the others aren't super friendly (very transactional), but there's big portions and good food at a decent price. The club sandwich is also great. Oh, and the eggs benny are pretty yummy."}
{"text":"KOS is a solid neighbourhood diner. It's a no-frills place you go to with your friends in the area for a hearty brunch and conversation. The food is good, (the home fries are great! More like r√∂sti/hash browns with onions), portions are large, price is fair, the people are friendly and the atmosphere is laid back."}
{"text":"This place offers exactly what you pay for. I got chocolate chip pancakes for 7$, my boyfriend ordered the mexicala omelette for 9$, both meals were completely satisfying. Staff were really friendly, the place had free wifi, and there was lots of outdoor patio space."}
{"text":"I've been to the KOS Cafe and Restaurant many times now, and I am consistently amazed by two things:  how low the prices are, and how incredible the food is.    Their burgers beat any others I've had, hands down.  Large, homemade patties on fresh buns, they are substantial enough that you can hold the fries and still be comfortably full.  Belgian waffles are crisp and come with real maple syrup - none of that corn syrup crap at KOS.  Philly cheese steak is unbelievable, and like everything else at KOS, is incredibly large for a reasonable price.  Real milkshakes, huge salads, I could go on and on.  It's not fancy, but there is an obvious pride in creating real food with good ingredients at a very reasonable price.  Last time the boyfriend and I went for dinner, our bill was under $20, including tip.  Quick, friendly staff, huge patio, free parking, and the Wifi provides another way to get some work done in a pinch.  I will be there again in a heartbeat.  Awesome weekend brunch option!"}
{"text":"Boy, was I in a generous mood when I rated this place last time. The sides to the Veggie Eggspress (beans and salad) were a nice touch, but the coffee was well below average and the potatoes (as described in my first review) were pretty tasteless.  Downgraded to 3 stars."}
{"text":"We've been coming here for years.  They have the best Greek salads in town and if you don't want it dressed, they won't dress it. They are extremely accommodating when it comes to food restrictions.  In the summer there is outdoor seating, with umbrellas to provide shade. Their white veggie omelettes are the best in town and I know, because no other omelette comes close to the ones at Kos.  This Kos is superior to the one in Kensington - the food is way better!"}
{"text":"Ok, best breakfast ever! I'm the fussiest eater I know, but I approve. Their pancakes have a hold on me."}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast before visiting casa Loma and this was a solid meal. Parked in a neighborhood nearby on street (2 hour max so more than enough time to eat and leave).   I ordered the eggs Bennie and my husband ordered the western burrito. Both were good and we enjoyed the liberal servings of sauce. Service was prompt and friendly.   A recommendation would be to update the decor to be more inviting. The tarps did not convey what a nice spot this is."}
{"text":"When we are too lazy to cook and want brunch but don't want to wait around in the lines on Bloor we go here. You could easily walk by and not even realize it has brunch, though they have food all day long. It's really the KOS of Kensington's sad little brother that has no friends and is only visited by people who have no better option.   But, with that said, the food, prices and service are all quite decent. There are tonnes of outside spots with umbrellas and there's an inside but I've never sat inside. It doesn't have the trendy feel that the other location has but it is absolutely fine. Especially since in Seaton Village there is a serious lack of places to eat."}
{"text":"There is nothing that eggs benedict can't solve.   The eggs benny here are pretty good, but the main winner, and the basis on which I judge all breakfast joints, is their hash browns. Deliciously crispy yet soft smashed potato, cooked on a flat top with chopped onions. I couldn't possibly finish it all, but it was the perfect.  My friend ordered the mix veggie breakfast, which seemed pricey at $10.95 until she got the plate: 2 eggs, hash browns, baked beans, 2 slices of beefsteak tomato, a slice each of cheddar and mozzarella cheese, toast and a big bowl of fruit. It came on two plates.  The other lovely thing about this place is that there is parking, and you don't need to wait for a table! Even on a Saturday!"}
{"text":"We had breakfast. Everything was executed perfectly. The sauteed mushrooms were delightful. Hash browns flavorful. Great find.  Doesn't look great on the outside."}
{"text":"Good value for a decent meal. We came for brunch and tried the grilled cheese, a classic brekkie and the veggie cheeseburger, oh and an order of the onion rings. I had the veggie cheeseburger and was though it was a pretty standard pattie, the bun was soft and delicious, there were ample toppings, and overall tasted great. My friends liked the onion rings but we all agreed the French fries and home fries left much to be desired. The coffee was refilled frequently and service was prompt and friendly. Cost of the meal was very reasonable for three people and what we ordered."}
{"text":"Went here for brunch today. Can't say I'd complain about anything.  Ordered the Eggs Salmonie (smoked salmon) and Eggs Benedict (peameal) both come with potatoes and salad and a delicious hollandaise sauce. It's a place that has very neighborhood feels and a chill vibe. The portions are big and very reasonably priced.   I also happened to peak at what other people were eating and I swear it all looked good. Very simple place that has really good comfort food!  Would I suggest it? 100% if you're in the area!  Would I come back? Definitely."}
{"text":"Wanted to try the Apollo eleven restaurant across the street from Kos but it was closed so we just went to check out Kos.  It was to hot to seat at the patio so we went inside but it had no ac on so it was hot as well.  We Ordered some food and it was OK, just that.  Bottom line, Kos is an average place to eat serving basic stuff for decent prices. It's ok but not more than that."}
{"text":"I've been here several times.  The Mexicala Omelette is really delicious.... comes with greens and homefries.  And it costs $9.  Really, it's everything you want in a brunch (if you don't eat meat, I guess).    The problem is, everything else I've had is nowhere near as good.  Take a pass on the coffee here.... get something from Rapido across the street instead."}
{"text":"Best breakfast place for the area. We have been going there for 6 years approx. great value for your money. And Tess and crew are great and always call you by your name it's a great place."}
{"text":"Service is nothing special, but they get the job done.  Food was decently priced and consistent across the board. No wait, no fuss. 6 eggspress meals.  If you are looking for a basic brunch that will satisfy. I would recommend.   The potatoes that come with all the meals were particularly delicious."}
{"text":"I come here a lot for brunch since I live very near here. KOS is a classic and fairly consistent place. The menu is diverse enough to accommodate all types of eaters (vegan, veg, meat lovers) and is sure to have classics and add ins as you please. I almost always order the \"can't talk eating\" special to share with my partner. It comes with eggs, potatoes, choice of bacon, ham or sausage, greens and a side of pancakes. It's delish for a reasonably priced breakfast.   They can accommodate parties of 10 on short notice, have (decent) bottom less coffee and overall the staff are friendly and just the right amount of attentive. In the summer it can be busy with the inside and the large outdoor patio tables, but all in all there is never a line and you get a good breakfast."}
{"text":"Very nice large patio.  Lots of seating inside and out so won't be lining up for weekend breakfast.  Friendly efficient service.   Food not greasy, unlike some other breakfast places."}
{"text":"I tried KOS Cafe today for lunch and opted for their Thursday Lunch Special, which was Chicken Souvlaki ($7.95) w/ Rice & a side Greek salad.  The chicken came on skewers and was surprisingly good.  I just wish there were more healthier options on the menu.  It was dominated by various kinds of burgers.  KOS has Wi-Fi, though I didn't try to connect to it."}
{"text":"If you feel like being theatrically poor and depressed, this is a good place to loiter on a Friday night. The tiling is brown, and you can sit by the window for the view of yourself superimposed over a parking lot.  I disapproved of the beans - canned molasses variety - at the outrageous price of $3, but the ceasar was pleasantly watery and unremarkable.   Closing sentiment: I Am Charlie Brown."}
{"text":"Inconsistent! Now toast and coffee pretty bad, if 3 eggs they must be small eggs and the service can be off."}
