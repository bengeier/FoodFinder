{"text":"Great ice cream at reasonable price. They offer 24 flavors of gelato as well as rolled ice cream. They have 13 signature rolls, and heard that they will be introducing a weekly special signature rolls as well. And of course, you can make your own as well. My favorite is Thai Tea ice cream with fruity pebbles mixed in. Their Thai tea flavor taste EXACTLY like Thai tea you will get from Thai restaurants."}
{"text":"Keep it Rollin Las Vegas! Ice Land Vegas has rolled into town!

There is something about rolled ice cream, you either love it or you don't. Some people say it is 'rolling' trend and others just 'roll' on in. I know, sorry I just had to say it! 

Personally, I like rolled ice cream and have tried it at two other Vegas locations. The texture is not like the regular scooped ice cream because the way it is created. It is a little firmer than hand scooped ice cream because it is scraped into little rolls once it freezes. 

I wanted something simple but I also wanted one of their signature rolls, so I chose the Chocolicious, which has a chocolate base-banana mix, bananas and whipped cream. It was pretty solid for something simpler than their other signature rolls. The ice cream texture was firm and the flavor was spot on. I really won't go into the bananas and whipped cream because that would be silly!

Now that I have tried, something simple I would love to come in and try their other signature rolls such as the DeathB4Decaf and Pina Colada! See you soon Ice Land!"}
{"text":"This place always fulfills my sweet tooth! I love getting their signature rolled ice cream and being able to customize mine with the variety of toppings they have. The workers there are always so nice, especially Rachel. Ice Land never fails to disappoint and it's a fun place to hang out with friends because of the board games they provide."}
{"text":"By far the best rolled ice cream in town. Ice Land is 30 minutes away from where I live, but definitely worth the drive. My favorite signature roll is the s'mores with vanilla base, but I love creating my own. The staff is extremely friendly and helpful with the menu. I highly recommend to anyone near and far!"}
{"text":"Ice Land Vegas used to be a gelato place and it still is! We came to try this new rolled ice cream joint especially because the original \"rolled ice cream\" has the longest lines out the door. We went in planning to get rolled ice cream but their gelato display caught our eyes. We were sampling a lot of yummy flavors! They also carry vegan options which i appreciate. Especially because I'm trying my best to stray away from dairy at the moment. Gelato was phenomenal but we cant wait to come back and this time for some rolled ice cream."}
{"text":"Rolled ice cream is now my favorite. It has a creamy yet crystallized texture and served SUPER cold!  Interestingly, it's made to order. 

Steps to make rolled ice are:
1. Put ingredients on \"cold plate\" (-35deg F)
2. Pulverize ingredients with paddles
3. Spread ingredients thin to freeze 
4. Roll ice cream into tubes with paddles 

For me the only ingredients that aren't good in rolled ice are nuts because they have an odd texture once being pulverized. 

Otherwise they're all great!

We shared the Wu-Tang rolled ice cream. It was a vanilla based ice cream with Oreo cookies and is sooo good!  I liked it a lot. 

I like this location because there's no line!  I've waited for about 25 min at competitors. Also it's convenient to get in and out if you're in the Boca park area. 

What I disliked is that they seem to lack focus in their product. They brand themselves as a rolled ice cream restaurant (which they're great at) but have a giant freezer full of gelato in front of the register. Their gelato section takes up more floor space than their 3 \"cold plates\"."}
{"text":"Rolled ice cream has rolled into Boca Park in the former Vivido Gelato space!  Came in during their soft opening and was torn between the Smores and coffee-flavored specialty options. Helpful staff suggested the DeathB4Decaf option (made with a coffee base) and added the toasted mashmallow from the other choice, which just hit the spot! 

The order was out pretty quick and I liked that the rolls held their shape very well and didn't melt. The flavor of the ice cream itself was more pronounced than I've had elsewhere, and the coffee flavor was really distinct. Looking forward to coming back to try their Thai tea version soon!

They still have gelato available for those who are unwilling to wait if there's a line. They have 3 of the ice tables so as long as they have trained staff working, they should be able to keep getting orders out fast. Props for having vegan options (gelato only right now) and coffee available too.

EDIT: Returned for their BOGO grand opening weekend special and tried the Gold Digger (Thai tea with lychee) and WuTang's Cookies & Cream (self explanatory). Both were pretty solid, with tons of cookies and lychee toppings. Even switching to a different base than my first visit, flavors are still strong!"}
{"text":"Use to be the gelato place. Located at Boca park. Shorter line than Rolled Ice Cream. It's good. Nice addition to boca park. They still sell gelato as well. They have board games that you can use to play."}
{"text":"ICE LAND IS AMAZING. I love their key lime roll, and the positive energy. They also have board games which is always fun while enjoying something sweet !"}
{"text":"Came here for their grand opening since they are doing BOGO. Make sure you mention that deal because they won't tell you.. 
If you're new to the concept they have 13 signature rolled ice creams ($5.99 each or $6.99 each with unlimited topping) that you can pick from. Or you have the option to BYO (build your own) for the same price. 
I ended up picking the gold digger because I really like Thai tea. The wait didn't take long at all. I got to see the entire process of them making my ice cream.
Let me just say their topping game is weak! When you get signature ice creams from LA they have good amount of topping, but the place here is so stingy. 
The ice cream itself is pretty good but a bit sweeter for my preference. 
Overall, I probably will only go here if I'm close to this area. This isn't worth a 23 minute drive from where I live."}
{"text":"Ice cream is very unique- the coffee flavor tastes strong and fresh like a bean! No complaints on the super cold ice cream. And to watch them make it, kind of a treat. But I was going for a gooey sundae and was I ever disappointed! The cookie was insignificant in size n flavor, the caramel was barely discernible and the kit Kay topping wimpy. Come on guys, for 6 bucks get some toppings on those bad boys!!!! Probably not going back for that...sorry to say."}
{"text":"Love this place . Rolled ice cream absolutely delicious and unique Comcept . Definitely recommend"}
{"text":"Having recently returned from a trip to Italy I was craving gelato. The gelato truly is good although I miss the fresh made waffle cones that they did in Italy. The ambience was not great and there was not a lot of outdoor sitting.  But, the gelato was excellent!  They also seem to give generous size scoops."}
{"text":"Their rolled ice cream is delicious!! Super rich & creamy. Strawberry shortcake &  their green tea flavor rolled ice cream is bomb! The staff is friendly & nice!"}
{"text":"I was excited to see this place open up near my house. Overall, it was a decent experience. It's tiny and crammed inside and they only gave two people rolling the ice cream so it took about 20 minutes to receive our order and that was with maybe 4 orders before ours. The ice cream itself was average. I'm afraid nothing to rave about."}
{"text":"Rolled ice cream is the newest trend and this place with its unique flavors and toppings is following along quite well in my opinion. 
They have about a dozen already perfected concoctions with toppings, such as a green tea mix, cookies and cream, strawberry shortcake, coffee blend, and even a s'mores mixture with toasted marshmallows on top! I haven't had one I didn't like! 
Last time, I noticed they also had gelato and it really was one of the best I've had. 
I prefer gelato over ice cream and the spumoni flavor was one of my absolute favorites! 
Recently I was also introduced to the sparkling water. Trust me, get strawberry with jelly! (Or boba if you prefer) My girl Tara brought me one a few weeks back and I've been hooked ever since! Very refreshing! 
Overall, good prices, above average products, and nice people. I wish they were open later but that's the only thing I'd change."}
{"text":"I ended up visiting Ice Land because Flavyours on Spring Mountain wasn't open. 
Well I'm glad my sister suggested this place because there was no wait and you pay before they make your order. 
There is a wide display of gelatos as well and another separate menu for coffee. 
The employees offered us a menu of their combos so I went for the 'Golddigger' that has a Thai tea base, lychee mix, lychee toppings, and condensed milk. 
My sister went for a green tea base with mochi, Kit Kats, and condensed milk. 
The rolled ice cream does come in one size ($6) and it takes awhile to melt. This was the first time I actually had (sort of) a hard time eating my ice cream just because it was bending my spoon. No matter, I'm just glad my sister didn't finish hers while mine was being made.

I wasn't offered a stamp card but I'll be sure to grab one with my next visit."}
{"text":"At first I thought their Turkish Coffee gelato had me returning for more. Apparently, I didn't know myself that well! 

It's their Death B4 Decaf rolled ice cream that's got a hold on me! Is it that bad??? Yyyyeah... but it's a \"good\" bad. And only addicts that actually eat gelato for dinner are allowed to use this oxymoron as an excuse. Uhuh I prescribe it :P

For my experience:
- always front row parking
- always greeted when walking in the door even though it seems like it's a new kid working
- never a line
- the rolling ice cream show is a relaxing wait and not high anxiety
- location and paying method are convenient
- cafe menu has coffees!
- interesting gelato flavor selections
- interior is always clean
- there's a cute couch for lovebirds on a date 
- there's music
- the tables/chairs are cute
- they train their employees with great politeness

I yubbit! They're yubbable!"}
{"text":"The best part of these rolled ice cream shops is watching them make the rolls. It's like teppanyaki but for ice cream, where showmanship is on full display. And those workers that are making the rolls must get a decent arm workout for reals!

Came here for the grand opening, and I was pleasantly surprised by how good their rolled ice cream was, especially after my sub-par experience at Rolled Ice Cream. The ice cream at Rolled Ice Cream is way too sweet, like they're handing out diabetes or somethin. 

Tried the Gold Digger (Thai tea topped with lychee) and the Matcha topped with red bean and mochi. Both were fantastic! The lychee was a nice complement to the Thai tea, and the matcha flavor in the matcha rolled ice cream was strong which I enjoyed. I also loved how creamy the ice cream was and how appropriately sweet they were.  

Now I know where to come for my rolled ice cream fix."}
{"text":"I like that you have a choice between gelato or rolled ice cream I tried death by decaf it was good especially if you like coffee ice cream the girl was very helpful . Their menu is on the wall and also on the counter"}
{"text":"Best rolled ice cream in town. Went in there and Kai took care of my wife an I. Super cool kid, provided excellent and fast service. Will definitely come back, highly recommended.
Go try their s'mores roll"}
{"text":"I'm pretty stoked that another rolled ice cream place opened up in town AND one that's near my house. I definitely like this place more than the other rolled ice cream place down Flamingo. This little shop is really cute and IKEA-d out. There's only two ice pans there but they also have gelato. 

I like the rolled ice cream here because the flavors are unique (like Thai tea) and they don't leave the ice cream on the pan too long, so it's wayyyy creamier and doesn't taste like freezer burn."}
{"text":"THEY. HAVE. ROLLED ICE CREAM!!!! 

Woot woot. So the only other rolled ice place is rolled ice cream... but their lines are so ridiculously long now a days (people all the way outside the door) that it's pretty inconvenient. 

This place used to be another gelato place, and as we walked in, we were surprised it was changed. 

What's great is that they still kept the gelato! I believe they also served coffee items so their variety was perfect. 

I got the strawberry shortcake, but I actually subbed the gingerbread with raspberry. The final product of it all was TOO PERFECT!! The vanilla was nicely flavored and not too sweet, and having the fresh fruits in there topped with condensed milk pulled the flavors together.  

Their rolled ice cream won my heart. I'm a very satisfied customer today."}
{"text":"I'd avoid this place. Owner has some bizarre ideas about service and the Gelato was gross. Stringy and... well... gelatinous. Funny cause it's called gelato... but having eaten gelato all over this fabulous globe, we've never had it like this. It was like ice cream that had defrosted, was refrozen, and then served to us as it was melting again. Asked for a refund. Clerk was friendly. Called the owner. He said that 'if we'd tasted it, he couldn't issue a refund.' Laughably stupid policy. Which I told the clerk. Clerk agreed. Called the owner again and he said he'd refund 1 of the 2 gelato. Now we're wasting time over 4.50. Really annoying. Took two different Flavours as we didn't want to go to the hassle of a refund. No improvement."}
{"text":"Ice Land recently joined the rolled ice cream scene in Vegas and I must say their ice creams easily beats other local competitors for its flavor and texture. 

Service was alright. Nothing mind-blowing. I was however impressed because our cashier did a cute drawing on each cup. 

$5.99 and you can either customize your own or choose from pre-selected options. I'm the most indecisive person on this planet so I went with Gold Digger, which is Thai tea base with lychee. 

I was hesitant about Ice Land due to other reviewers' comments about crystallized, not so creamy texture. I was pleasantly surprised because my ice cream was creamy. I've tried several rolled ice cream shops in town and this was the creamiest. 

Not to mention, Thai tea base tasted like milk tea blended but with creamy texture almost like gelato (and I love me some milk tea). Also liked the lychee + Thai tea concoction. 

Also tried Perfect Matcha but substituted red bean for Oreo. I believe matcha base itself is not sweetened because Oreo was the only sweetness factor in this. 

Tip: check-in on Yelp for 10% off

I would give 5 stars but Bing Haus in San Diego had the most unforgettable rolled ice cream...but for Vegas standard, they are on their A game."}
{"text":"Ice Land is a newer ice cream spot that serves gelato and rolled ice cream. They have board games you can play while you wait for your ice cream or just hang out. They have a bunch of pre-made recipes for the rolled ice creams and a handful of different gelato flavors.
All of the staff I interacted with were really nice and helpful. I tried two different rolled ice cream recipes and they were both good. One was key lime and it didn't do it for me.

The rolled ice cream trend isn't a thing for me. I mean it's super cute and picture worthy but it just doesn't taste as good as regular ol ice cream! It just doesn't do it for me. The texture just is off putting and not as creamy as I like.

Price was pretty average for such a specialty item. 

Although the rolled ice cream was okay, I wouldn't recommend this place unless you just have to try it."}
{"text":"This was my first time trying rolled ice cream and it was incredible! I went with my boyfriend and we got items from the suggested menu rather than making our own. I got the cookies and cream one and he got the pina colada one. At this shop they also have games to play while you're waiting or you could watch them make your rolled ice cream. At first the ice cream was extremely hard but after a minute or two it softened up. I can't wait to try more flavors next time!"}
{"text":"Well, at least this makes it two local places better than \"Rolled Ice Cream.\"

Ice Land Vegas is the third ever of this subgenre of ice cream which I've tried, but it's the second chronologically of three local businesses to offer the lower-case rolled ice cream treat, a modern Thai street food dessert with entertainment value in the preparation. The upper case place was the \"pioneer\" for the Vegas scene, but its lower-case product lacked in both flavor and texture.

The location is in an otherwise nondescript gigantic plaza, at the northeast corner of Rampart and Charleston. I found it without much trouble due to the bright sign at night. After walking inside and noticing that the seating area was totally empty - an oddity for late nights at dessert shops, in my experience - I browsed the rolled ice cream menu on the blackboards located on the exterior wall.

There is only one portion size, a $5.99 cup. Unlimited toppings are available for a +$1 upgrade if you're into that sort of thing. Ultimately, I settled on a limited, premade combo off the \"signature\" menu, assuming that these should be reasonably good offerings and realizing that I generally take too long to decide, especially considering the variety of choices of base, mix-in, topping, and sauce. My choice was the Gold Digger, a Thai tea base with lychee mix-in, lychee topping, and condensed milk.

After I placed my order, an employee said that they'll make it for me to watch. He prepared the cream and grabbed the mix-in, and poured those onto one of the three super-cold surfaces which instantly started to freeze the foreign invaders. The employee quickly chopped up the mix-in, then started to mix everything and then flatten it out again to the final rectangular setup for rolling. Five scrapes later, and five spiral cylinders of dessert were ready for the toppings and sauce sauce in a rear station.

In terms of texture and thickness, the lower-case here did bear an uncanny, unsettling resemblance to the not-so-creamy, overly spoon-resistant product of the upper case competitor. It only really got soft enough just before it started to melt. However, I have to give props for the variety of flavors and add-ons, especially the real lychee fruit found doubly in my dessert. It will be familiar to anyone who has eaten either the fresh or the canned versions of it. That said, the Thai tea flavor does seem somewhat muted, which I'm guessing is a side-effect of the cream which they use in all of their bases. Still, it's more interesting than something mundane like vanilla or chocolate.

Ice Land does offer gelato and coffee too, which are seemingly holdovers from the old inhabitant of this space (named Vivido Gelato), but it seems unlikely that those particular offerings would be worth the visit. I do hope to return occasionally, but it's easier for me, a Henderson resident, to drive to another lower-case spot which I prefer overall. I very rarely find myself in this particular neighborhood for other reasons (read: restaurants), and that seems unlikely to change."}
{"text":"If you've never had rolled ice cream, you must try it!  My kids were amazed and at first, couldn't figure how to eat it.  When they did, they thought it was delicious.  I've tried another chain on the East Coast, so comparing the two, I would go with the other place over this one if I had a choice.  The service was lacking.  It's a fairly new trend, so it would have been nice for an employee to explain the process, but that didn't happen.  Also, I don't think that anyone smiled or even said Hello to us.  They were just all business, cranking out bowls after bowl of ice cream.  The actual rolls of ice cream were much thicker than others I've tried, so with the cheap plastic spoons we were given, it was hard to eat without breaking the spoon.  I would go back if I was in the area again, but I would search it out to go back again."}
{"text":"Pretty amazing ice cream, friendly staff and a good variety. Highly recommend the berry berry and tiramisu gelato."}
{"text":"This is my first time and it was a pleasant experience. Staffs are very friendly and the store is nicely decorated. I tried the gold digger on the menu and its very good. I will definitely come back and recommend the store to others."}
{"text":"No thank you. Not sure why people enjoy rolled ice cream other than for the sake of taking a picture of it. The texture and flavor is nothing like ice cream. It's awful and laughable people consider it healthy and \"fresh.\" 

I'd rather get a frosty next door for 50cents then spend $7 here for nothing. Staff didn't seem like they enjoyed being there very much. Oh well live and learn. No more rolled ice cream for me. I prefer to taste over Instagram worthy."}
{"text":"Forget that \"other\" rolled ice cream place. This one is spotless, cheaper, delicious, has a super friendly staff and (get this) no stupid long line out the door. This was a great find! Kids got pride rock, cookies and cream, and one homemade chocolate bomb creation. All of it was awesome!"}
{"text":"Oh my gosh!!!!! These guys are amazing just got my ice cream i was very particular about my order but they are so accommodating ... this would be my fav ice cream joint in Vegas and I'm local. Thanks for being so bombbb Iceland"}
{"text":"I'm a fan.  For the price, you get a decent amount of toppings, and the ice cream flavors don't disappoint.

Liked:  the preset mixes, particularly the perfect matcha and the thai tea Golddigger.  You get a nice amount of toppings and drizzled condensed milk, and it all seems to last long enough for the ice cream.  

Disliked: not too much, I don't mind stopping in when I'm in the area picking up dry cleaning.

I haven't tried their other offerings (gelato and the like).  

Overall, it's not as good as the one in Chinatown (my favorite) but definitely better than local competitors and pretty much anything is better than Rolled Ice Cream."}
{"text":"Just happened to stop by since it was next to Target at Boca Park. Glad I'm came by! They have the option of getting gelato, custom rolled ice cream, or any of the signature rolls.

Service was good, the cashier was really nice. I love the interior of the place. It's nice and clean. Will definitely stop by again!"}
{"text":"Great concept! Great ice cream. Was excited to take my kids there. Rude girl working at the register this evening. Too bad I left with a bad taste in my mouth and not because of the ice cream but because of her poor attitude. The owner should reevaluate his hiring practices and start hiring friendlier people. The other two guys working there this evening were very pleasant.  This place serves ice cream which usually draws in kids which doesn't really pair well with rude employees. This was our first time there and when I asked her for some details of how it all worked all she kept saying is the directions are behind you on the wall. Not going back unless my negative experience can be rectified somehow. But, overall her negative attitude ruined the whole experience for me."}
{"text":"This place is great. First time I tried rolled ice cream. I enjoyed watching the process and then tasting the beautiful end result. Rolled ice cream is yet another way to enjoy an already wickedly sugary and guilty pleasure, and I'm fine with that. Everyone here is friendly too!"}
{"text":"I've been trying to convince my boyfriend to go to rolled ice cream with me since he's been hesitate from a bad experience at another rolled ice cream place in town. My boyfriend said that he actually preferred this place over the other joint in town. The service was great - we were greeted immediately when we walked in and the guy asked if we have ever been there before. It was our first time so he gave us some suggestions on what to order. I ordered the s'mores and boy was it yummy. I will gladly be returning if I'm in the mood for ice cream."}
{"text":"No one is washing hands just keep changing gloves and touching everything including rubbing nose and just sitting around. I had to ask them to wash hands and change gloves and still not done correctly and then family gets sick from the ice cream I will not be returning no matter what"}
{"text":"Such a sweet ice cream parlor tucked in a stop mall central boca park. They offer the viral rolled ace cream, I can tell you I didn't think the rolled ice cream was going to taste as good as this hype has seemed but it really does taste fresh! Clean, well decorated interior!!! Offer fresh espresso and amazing customer service!!! Prices are better than cold stone for better quality! We will return very satisfied!"}
{"text":"Came here few days ago, tried death b4 decaf. Staff were really nice, ice cream was great. It was really fun to watch staff making the ice cream. Price was reasonable, compared to how much labor they have to involve into to make ice cream. I will definitely come back, but I will for sure ask them not to put any mix because I did not feel comfy chewing something in my mouth while I was eating ice cream."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere! They serve gelato & rolled ice cream...we tried both and they were delicious! Such a treat. They also have games so you can hang out with your family & play! We will definitely come back!

Make sure you check in on Yelp and get 10% off your total!"}
{"text":"I have been here twice now and can honestly that what they offer is great. I really like the pistachio gelato and the pina colada rolled ice cream was good.
It is a small place but has tables and they offer games to play and hang out.
My niece loves the gold digger rolled ice cream which is Thai tea based with lychee. The reason I have to give 4 stars rather than 5 is because I wish they had more options to choose from or at least have more fresh fruit choices for toppings."}
{"text":"Finally another rolled icecream joint in Vegas and one with a short weight! Got the death b4 decaf and it was coffeelicious! I liked that it was topped with kitkats 

Will be coming back to try other flavors. They also serve gelato here and I sampled a few flavors. All were delicious."}
{"text":"I admit it. I love to try anything new, cute, or. kitschy. Rolled ice cream meets all the criteria in a new to LV way.

I have tried the other option in town and even knowing the texture would again be an issue here I still figured I'd try it. Offering one size for $5.99 and an unlimited topping option for $1 more I went with one of the creations on their menu board. While I found the base here to be more flavorful freezing the ingredients on the cold plate in order to make the signature rolls still results in an ice cream with an unpleasant crystallized texture. To me the texture reminds me of ice cream that has been in the freezer too long. I also found them to be stingy with the toppings here. They also offer gelato which due to its appearance I chose not to try. Oddly shiny its texture did not look right and it was missing the amazing aesthetic of a traditionally displayed gelato.

Service was friendly but I will continue to enjoy a more traditional ice cream or gelato."}
{"text":"Um...chocolate gelato with cookie dough? Time to get a 2nd job to afford my new addiction."}
{"text":"First timer here and what can I say? Rolled ice cream tasted fresh, unique, and delicious! You can pretty much order a create your own by choosing a base and type of filling or toppings, or off their menu. My husband and I ordered the strawberry shortcake and matcha green tea with lychee, azuki beans,  mochi, and condensed milk. Price is reasonable for its taste and quality. I would return and try other flavors. Staff were friendly and helpful! Wi-Fi for the win!!"}
{"text":"My brother and I took our daughters to Ice Land on 9/4/17 at approximately 6:30pm. My German chocolate gelato was outstanding. My brother's pistachio gelato was okay except for the pistachio shell that he accidentally bit down upon. My niece had the marshmallow-something. She was enjoying her gelato until she discovered an approximately 2\" piece of hard, jagged plastic in her gelato. My brother and I brought the plastic into the shop and the man working the counter, apologized and blamed the distributor that they use. My standards are not unreasonable, but this trip to Ice Land was hazardous. My brother is lucky that he didn't break a tooth or choke on the pistachio shell and my niece is lucky that she didn't bite into the sharp plastic."}
{"text":"I like this location for rolled ice cream because it's easy to get to, has little to no lines, and is only $6!

I got the s'mores and it tasted amazing! If you can't have dairy, it's good know that they have gelato and sorbet options as well. There are also a variety of coffee drinks to choose from!"}
{"text":"In the quest for a great ice cream spot near summerlin Ice Land is a welcome addition. The closing of Gelatto Messina in DTS was sad news but the gelato assortment at Ice Land looks promising but tonight we were all ready to try their rolled ice cream! We tried two of their signatures, death b4 decaf and pride rocks and a create your own with chocolate, banana and whipped cream. They were all delicious! If you are looking for a great reasonably priced treat check it out!  I know we will be back."}
{"text":"I am so glad I stumbled upon this place on yelp! Once again, my fellow yelpers have chosen well.

As you probably have already seen, this is a \"rolled\" type of ice cream. And the only place to compare it to is rolled (ice pan is now extinct). And it is soooo much better (sorry rolled). They play good music, provide wifi, have tables and chairs, and it's not as crowded. The service is friendly and they have three ice stations. You order and pay first and then they make your creations. They also have other stuff like coffee, hot chocolate, and gelato.

Either their cream consistency is different or their ice pans are cold-ER because the texture AND flavor is out of this world! 

I got the death b4 decaf without the caramel drizzle and enjoyed it so much: coffee base with graham crackers and kit Kat bars. My absolute favorite type of ice cream and chocolate bar in general! So perfect for me. Not too sweet and doesn't melt so fast (kinda like how rolled does).

I would definitely come back and bring babe here, he would definitely like this place! Don't forget to grab a stamp card cause I know you'll be back. 

Let the good times roll!"}
