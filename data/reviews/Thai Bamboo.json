{"text":"One of the best thai restaurants I have been to so far. The food is super delicious, the service is good and the restaurant ambience is cozy and comfortable. we are vegetarians and they have lots of options for vegetarians. love the basil tofu and the vegetarian pad thai..."}
{"text":"Mmmmm. I think that Thai Bamboo is one of the contenders for best thai food in the city.  I always order the chicken and shrimp pad thia, and it's amazing. I am super picky, and I hate it when white meat comes in questionable shades. No worries here, the meat seems to be chicken breast, and the shrimp has been shelled and are pretty big.
The portion sizes are good, I always have leftovers for dinner.
The veggie spring rolls are also worth a go! 
This place gets super crowded at lunch, so you should reserve a table."}
{"text":"Don't eat here.
We came here with another couple looking for some great Thai food, and after looking at the reviews and what people had to say we thought this would be the perfect spot.
We arrived for dinner at 630 pm and as soon as we sat down the woman came up to us asking what we'd like to order, since we hadn't looked at the menus yet we asked her to come back. Not even 5 mins later she was back asking us what food we wanted and we had to check the closing time as it felt like we were being rushed out of there. 
We ordered some waters to get her off our backs once we realized we had lots of time before they were closed.
We ended up ordering mango salad, spring rolls and chicken satay to start.
The mango salad was overly sweet and the satay sauce looked like a brown gelatinous substance which vaguely tasted like peanuts.

For the mains we ordered seafood red curry, chicken green curry and chicken and shrimp pad thai.
It was the worse Thai food I've ever eaten.
We were all hungry but still could not eat the main meals and didn't even bother asking to take home the left overs.  
The sauces were watery, over salted and downright horrible.
We eat Thai quite a bit and though we love authentic Thai cooking we are also ok with eating at places who may be less authentic but serve decent food.
This was like Thai food from the garbage from an already bad wannabe Thai food joint.

If you're hungry grab a pizza, grab anything else and if you're in the mood for Thai and have a crazy craving for some your're still better off going for that pizza- trust me."}
{"text":"Went here first time today and ordered Ginger chicken. The  place was packed and the service was a bit slow. The food is okay. Portions were okay. I'll come back and try some other dishes and post my review again."}
{"text":"I was expecting something more authentic but the menu didn't have the variety I've seen at other Thai restaurants. We ordered pad Thai and cellophane noodles and some spring rolls and thai iced tea. We could feel the powder grit in the thai iced tea. One bonus is that the service was very fast."}
{"text":"Thai Bamboo is where I go to eat Laos beef salad or Laap. This place rocks and always leaving me satisfied. 

The ambience of the restaurant is quite lacking to be honest. There are some statues and pictures of Gods that represent Thai culture in the restaurant but other from that this place is run down and old. Renovations would be great but not needed because this place gets busy, especially during lunch! I came here on a Wednesday evening and I was glad it wasn't crowded. 

On to the food: I ordered the Laos beef salad with tripe extra spicy because I like the heat. I won't advise others to order it extra hot though because it can be really really spicy who someone who isn't familiar with heat. I also got the house fried rice that came with shrimp and chicken. It has a nice taste and the pineapples and nuts really compliments it well. I shared the food with my boyfriend and after we had devoured everything we were still hungry, but satisfied. We would've ordered more but the prices of the dishes were quite expensive. Our bill was around $36ish and we only ordered the salad, fried rice, and Thai iced tea.

The service was good as well! The lady who served us was kind and efficient. Plus she brought us a whole jar of water instead of just two cups because we ordered spicy food so that was really cool. 

Overall, I will definitely come back here again! Just wish the prices weren't as expensive but the tasty Thai food kinda makes up for it!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is the absolute best thai restaurant in Vaughan. The service is quick and the taste is consistent every time I visit. I always usually get the spring rolls and chicken pad thai which both taste amazing and flavorful and the servings are always generously sized. Staff as well is very friendly, but the restaurant can get crowded at times which makes it hard to be seated. I definitely will continue to visit this restaurant on a regular basis and highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"It's been a while since I have been here.   Always ordered the house spicy fried rice, chicken curry noodles soup spicy, papaya salad thai style spicy, beef Laos salad extra spicy.   Food was great.  This place used to have bad service bc they tend to be busy on weekends but tonight service was exceptional."}
{"text":"Great fresh spring rolls. I love the chicken coconut soup and  pad Thia are delicious. Unfortunately their take out service is much better than the dine in !! Most of their servers lack the common curtesy and bordering rudeness"}
{"text":"The food was excellent! If you like spring rolls you will LOVE theirs! I ordered the green curry beef and would do it again."}
{"text":"Just happened to stop by this place while driving by. Tried the ginger beef and panang curry.   Both were excellent. The service was decent.   Decor was comfortable.   Best restaurant in this area.  Great find and will be back!"}
{"text":"One of my favourite Thai restaurants in the city. I would take a shower in the sauce that they serve with their fresh spring rolls. And their mango salad is incredible. Tangy, fresh and bursting with flavour. 
Having been a patron for years, there are times when I order the pad thai and it comes a little lackluster. It looks like it's been sitting for awhile, as opposed to being made fresh to order. But when it's fresh, there's nothing like it.
This place absolutely beats all the trendy Thai spots popping up around the city and it's cheaper than all of them."}
{"text":"I'm a regular at this place because the food is well priced, tasty and I always receive service with a smile. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner.It wasn't too busy yet and had a steady stream of people coming in for pick up. We order the Nam Kao (14.95) , papaya salad (Laos style) (10.95), and beef and tripe laop (14.95). 

The rice came before the salads. The Nam Kao was good - the rice was not over fried and well broken up. The papaya was spicy! ordered it with 2 chilies and I've had it before but it was extra spicy today! Again, a solid dish. The beef and tripe salad was good. My boyfriend found the sliced lemongrass a little too strong. The beef pieces were a little small and tripe was like hidden treasure. 

overall, the food was good. I would come back but it would be more of a treat than a regular visit."}
{"text":"Dining in or taking out the food is almost always good.  Mango salad, fresh or fried spring rolls, pad Thai, green curry.... It's all good. I have dined here many, many, times as well as ordered take out.  The staff are really friendly, and the food is amazing.  I often will order the pad thai because it's a guaranteed good meal, but I try to change it up every now and again.  I love the soups, but mostly because they have coconut in them and I am a huge fan of coconut anything.   I always recommend this place because the prices are decent, and the portions are huge.  You can either order your own meal, or order a bunch of things to share.  Everyone loves both the fresh and fried spring rolls."}
{"text":"Good value for money and unpretentious. Delicious cold rolls and mango salad. Extensive menu. Very busy. Cellophane noodles (from beans) so more-ish. Lots of vegetarian options. Great lunch spot with free parking. Closed for lunch on Saturday and closed all day Sunday which is a pity. Can't wait to return ..."}
{"text":"Not great food but most of the dishes I tried were spicy, hence on the authentic side. 

I had the Spicy Basil Eggplant and the Chicken Panang. Not bad dishes but not fantastic. Unlike other reviews, the rice was fresh but I went on a Friday lunch so this was expected.

Looks better than the usual Thai restaurants on Steels and the food was not as bland as the other ones although I have to say that I tasted the Pad Thai from a friend and it was blend and sweet so it is a hit or miss.

Not dying to come back"}
{"text":"Been coming here for 20+yrs! I know the owner and she's always welcoming you with a smile. I will drive from Mississauga (can't find good thai here) to visit Thai Bamboo!  Food is consistently delicious and the same portion sizes. My favourite dish is their deep fried fish in curry sauce...yum. Spicy peanut chicken is great, pad thai is great, chicken panang is great...all their food is great!"}
{"text":"I work in the area and we come to this restaurant as part of our lunch rotation. I was excited to see they updated the menu. 
I was especially excited to see that they had added Khao Soi to the menu. I should have known something was wrong when the waitress said \"What is that?\" As I pointed the item on the menu and she said \"oh. That's new.\"
My dish comes. And it's not Khao Soi. It was egg noodles in a coconut broth. Anyone who has had Khao Soi knows that it comes in a rich semi-thick curry broth. So the waitress tells me \"They're not sure how to make it.\" And then continues to tell me that what she served me is what it's supposed to be. I have had this same dish at a number of Thai restaurants and know that it was in no way a Khao Soi except for the type of noodles that was in the broth. 
Anyway. DO NOT order the Khao Soi. You will be very disappointed."}
{"text":"Food is amazing. Came in for lunch. Friendly staffs but the server kept messing up and forget all my requests but she come through eventually. Good food. Will come back."}
{"text":"I had lunch here for the first time last Friday. When I first walked in, this place was packed! We had to wait a bit but it was worth it. I recommend making reservations before you go.

We ordered the Fried Vegetable Spring Rolls to share. It comes with two. The sauce was a delicious plum sauce with peanuts in it. I love peanuts so this was a plus. The Spring Roll was not a regular sized spring roll - it was huge. It was extremely hot, meaning it was freshly fried! It was delicious and crispy. Inside were vegetables and some noodles. What really made it good was the dipping sauce and the crunch of the spring roll. 

For my meal, I ordered the Chicken Pad Thai. It was a little bit different from the usual Pad Thai I get from a lot of other places - it wasn't red or sour. It was very savoury and dark. I loved it. It was also a really big plate that I only ate half and had to take the rest of it home!

This place is delicious. I will definitely keep coming back! Definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"I went here with a colleague for lunch. It wasn't particularly good. The service was a tad slow (they were busy and didn't appear to have enough staff) and the food wasn't particularly good. Usually you order a lunch special in another Thai restaurant and you get soup and a spring roll with your entree. Not here. Just your entree. I ordered the green curry. It was really weak and bland. It tasted like yellow curry. It even looked kind of yellowish. I'm used to green curries being very bright and spicy. This was bland and muddled. The chicken also had a weird texture."}
{"text":"We went to Thai Bamboo after a failed visit to Pho Lin around the corner. I wasn't expecting much from the outside just another strip mall Thai joint --  but wow -- dont judge a book from the cover!!

The restaurant is small, and its not up scale -- or even mid scale -- its just looks like any other gresy spoon joint. 

But the service shines like a diamond, with attentive friendly wait staff that smile big, and help along with the menu if you have any questions at all.

When we (my daughter, who is vegetarian) and I first looked at the menu , the waiter described the vegetarian options for her right away.  

The dining room only had two other tables occupied, but by the time we were done the place was packed and bustling!

We went traditional and safe -- deep fried spring rolls with fish sauce - - vegetarian Pad Sew Ew  for my daughter and  Green Chicken Curry for myself. Rice is a side extra which is standard practice in Thai restaurants) and was fragrant  soft and flavorful.

The food was hot and excellent -- all the flavors punched through, wasn't too spicy  but had an awesome kick that you want--- and the flavors linger on your palate just long enough ..  i am drooling as i remember this ;)

 For dessert we shared a Mango ice cream and a black sticky rice with mango --  and i will go back there JUST for the desserts -- omg -- awesome awesome awesome.

Thai Bamboo is a little out of the way, and it's in an industrial plaza -- but go there -- support this business. with some investment they could compete with any other Thai chain -- the staff are awesome the food is delicious and amazing and i can't wait to get back to the neighborhood and eat there again!!

Out total bill averaged about $20 per person including drinks. I think i tipped at 33% though -- :)"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing  -- very flavorful and the spice is perfect.   We had chilli chicken which we loved and cold spring rolls which were also very good.  The service was good don't be fooled by the simple exterior this is an AMAZING thai and the price is more than reasonable."}
{"text":"My wife and I randomly pulled in one evening just to avoid the heavy after-work traffic, thinking \"yeah, Thai wouldn't be so bad right about now\". We've never been here before but we're glad we did.

First off let me get the bad written down. The service is a little on the lax side. We walked in and stood there waiting for someone to seat is (trying not to be rude and seat ourselves). A waitress was processing a card transaction at a table near the door, and she obviously heard us walk in because of the numerous door chimes that jingled as we entered. She didn't even look up at us. All it would take is a quick smile and say \"Hi and welcome! Please allow me to finish here and I'll be right with you\" or \"Hi, please just have a seat anywhere you like and I'll be with you shortly\". Rather, we stood there for an awkward minute until another server came out to greet us.

Aside from that, food service was fast, appetizers came out first as expected and piping hot, fantastic! The place is clean and smelled great, though decor is a bit dated, however comfortable. I prefer comfortable over prissy any day.

We had veggie Tom Yum soup which was quite good, very hot and sour, with veggies and tofu bits, nice. Spring rolls were very oily but that's the nature of spring rolls, quite tasty shrimp filling, and the peanut sauce dip is different but good. The mains were spicy basil chicken (not very spicy compared to the Tom Yum soup) but it wasn't greasy, very clean tasting and went deliciously well with white rice, plenty of sauce. The beef pad Thai was clean, tasted good, not mind blowing spectacular but good. Overall a decent meal fully stuffing two people for under $35 prior to tip."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and have left happy each time. Their food is beyond tasty. Each dish is prepared with care. I recommend the pad Thai,coconut rice and cashew chicken. Their prices are a bit high. It's a small restaurant and can get cramped, especially during lunch hour."}
{"text":"Had the vegetarian Thai curry soup with vermicelli noodles, delicious! Loved how everything was fresh and hot. Although it was really busy, the service was prompt."}
{"text":"Best Thai food you can find. I wasn't a huge fan of Thai food but got into it months ago. As a cook I started experiencing and trying different Thai food restaurants. Hands down this it the best. From there soft fresh spring rools, steak pad thai and chicken thai dish, amazing. 

Highly recommended,  mark my word."}
{"text":"Nice tasty Thai food, but too much cauliflower in every curry dish. 

TomYam is really good!"}
{"text":"We come to this place all the time!!!! My parents are vegetarian and they make great tofu curries, pad thai and fried rice. Their veg. tum yum soup is money! so are the fresh and deep fried rolls and mango salad. This place gets packed b/c of its proximity to York and also since the food is delicious.
Consistently good food and top service. They usually only have 3 - 4 staff on the floor who also tend to take out, but they are super nice and will try their best to accommodate to your requests."}
{"text":"Met up with a friend from York U here for dinner last night. The food is more Laos inspired than Thai. Really tasty food - started with the papaya salad  (warning: it is super spicy)  which was refreshing and definitely opened up all my sinuses:) It's a compination of rice noodles and green papaya with a spicy dressing. YUMM-O!
For mains I recommend the beef bbq - sauce was finger licking good and not too thick - perfect for a warm summer evening. we also ordered the eggplant dish which looked bland but tasted really great.
Ended with an amazing sticky rice and mango - they use wild rice to make sticky rice and that adds a whole new dimension to the already delectable dessert. The dec or is ordinary - with wicker chairs and paintings depicting life in rural Laos. I wouldn't trek all the way for just a meal (live way downtown) but if I can club it with another errand, I know I would be happy with another meal here."}
{"text":"Now I'm beginning to understand why Khao San in downtown is so popular.... Thai food in Toronto just isn't very good. I had always thought that Kao San was very overrated (quality is basically average compared to what you'd get in Cali), but it's a lot better than this place. 

We ordered a few dishes:
-pad thai wasn't very good. Didn't like the texture of the noodles. Also, it wasn't very flavorful
-green curry was VERY salty, to the extent that it was difficult to eat 
-fried rice (can't remember which type) also was one of the poorer quality fried rice dishes that I've had at a Thai place. I thought that the dish taste \"burnt\" (although I was the only one at my table who felt that way)
-soup was decent... different to every other Thai place I've been, but decent. 

Dishes average about $10 each (at lunch)
Very busy (at lunch)... maybe this place is decent for Toronto standards (hence the 3 stars. In Cali this would be an easy 2)
Ample parking available. 
I won't be back"}
{"text":"I was excited bout this place. I was babysitting and decided to pick up food because my brothers fridge is always empty.   I called ahead for pick up. One of the items I ordered was not available but I only found out when I got there.  I read the great reviews and when i got home I was disappointed.  Food is ok. It's more on the authentic side but lacks yummyness. To make matters worse I found a hair in my thai curry. Game over!"}
{"text":"I would not recommend eating here or ordering from here. 

People are insane. This place is always packed around noon and I just don't get it. For $10, yes you get a good sized portion...but it's of OIL!!!!!!!! 

Every time I've eaten here in the past, I have literally been sick because the food is so incredibly heavy. NOTHING is fresh and anyone who tells you different has no palate. 

I've tried the chicken fried rice, fresh spring rolls, fried spring rolls,  shrimp fried rice and the spicy pad thai.  All very generic. And any meat you get has obviously sat out raw, or was defrosted prior to your order being placed; you can tell in the quality of the food. 

They could easily do a better job."}
{"text":"Very impressive first visit. 

Place was busy at 9:30 on a Friday night-always a good sign-- and most of the clientele was Thai (judging by appearance and the language spoken)-- an even better sign.

My wife and I shared a pair of spring rolls with shrimp (very nice), followed by Thai Coconut Rice with Pork, a wonderful dish with exquisitely balanced flavors of pickled bits of raw pork, sweetness of the coconut, and tart cilantro. (Yes, the pork is raw, technically, but it's cured by pickling, like cerviche, and well worth trying. Don't be a wimp.) 

There were numerous dried Thai chiles in the dish too, but no noticeable heat. So I took a bite of one (which I regularly do in all kinds of Asian places to no ill effect) and it about took the top of my head off. 

Not sure what that was about, but we loved this dish nonetheless. It's on the menu under a Thai or Lao name, but you'll spot it under rice dishes when you look on the menu. The notes describe it as \"a Lao classic,\" and it's easy to see why. 

Main course was vegetarian: an eggplant curry to die for, with white rice. We were particularly impressed because curries typically just cook the vegetables to death, but in this one the various types-- eggplant, zucchini,  sweet bell peppers, carrot-- had to have been added separately, because the texture of each was perfect. Also not too sweet: the coconut was precisely balanced with lime and basil so that every bite left us wanting more. 

We splurged on dessert and went for the purple sticky rice with mango. Outstanding. There's a reason this dish appears on most of those \"One Hundred Foods You Must Try Before You Die\" lists, and this version is an excellent example.

I see some other reviewers mentioned poor service in their notes, but it was certainly not the case for us. As I said, the place was fairly busy, but we saw three servers working the dozen-or-so tables; our food came promptly and hot, and everyone was pleasant and courteous.

This isn't someplace to go to impress a first date: \"unassuming\" would be the kindest  phrase to describe the cheesy strip-mall environment and scant decor, but for basic, well-prepared Thai dishes, it's a little gem out in the no-man's-land west of Dufferin on Steeles.

Also, the meal described above-- plus a Thai iced tea for me and hot tea for both of us-- was less than $40 with tip.  

We liked this place enough on the first trip that we'll definitely be going back soon.Hopefully the rest of the less-than-extensive menu is as good as what we had tonight."}
{"text":"I have only been here a few times. I will never go here again.

Their rice: I have no idea why they would serve us OLD rice (out of the pot for at least a few hours, if not a day; it is hard and crunchy, which is not what I want when I ask for rice). I got the red curry once and the green curry once. They are both horrible. I have no idea what they are doing to their chicken, but it's definitely not fresh. The flavours are also a bit off. If you just had the sauce but not the chicken the curries would be passable.

You should stick to their Laotian dishes, since they do those alright. But I just can't accept a restaurant that would serve its customers old rice. It's RICE! How hard can it be to do RICE right?! When my girlfriend complained the second time we went there the server came back, giving us the same rice, but they microwaved it this time (making it harder and crispier).

Thanks buddy, that really cemented our decision to never go there again. Fresh rice is not going to kill your profits.

Before you say that perhaps we went there during a bad time or whatever else, we went there twice around dinner time (6pm). Sorry if I expect food to be fresh at dinner time.

What I couldn't understand was that the place had fairly decent business and what looked like \"regulars.\" I don't know who would regularly subject themselves to this."}
{"text":"This is a small thai place near York University. Beware, this place is usually very full during the lunch hour. The food was good and served promptly. The offerings are thai foods. I would recommend the red curry or the chicken panang. The taste was good, but as you can see from my picture, the presentation could use a little bit of work. Price range is around $10/ main dish."}
{"text":"I used to come here all the time and recommend it to my coworkers since it was in the area.  But as of today, I'm done.  You cannot serve someone something that was ordered as vegetarian, that you confirmed when dropping off the plate, is vegetarian, but upon a few bites in, is NOT.  Just because I don't go into anaphylaxis upon biting in doesn't mean it's any less serious to me personally.  The servers were not fussed at all when I pointed this out, my half eaten spring roll was served to someone else at the table and nothing was taken off the bill.  I didn't even receive eye contact or an apology.   I won't be back, ever."}
{"text":"The food here is really great. One of our favourite appetizers is the sticky rice with peanut sauce, another is their mango salad. My kids da like the Pad-Thai, I enjoy their curry dishes, the chicken satay looks good. The decor look like your grandmother's sunroom with decades old wicker chairs and the service.... well don't come here expecting any! It's really the food that gives it the stars. Probably the best bet is takeout, which is how I discovered this place initially. We've dined in here a few times but the service makes it frustrating. It doesn't seem to bother the other patrons though, they line up for this place and pack it full lunch and dinner!"}
{"text":"We stop by based on reviews and also we were in the area.   Honestly I don't know why there are high reviews here.  The food was really disappointing. We order the crispy fried rice,  interesting  but it isn't great nor filling.  Papaya salad was missing lemon and we had better. Seafood curry was very watery....  Didn't taste like anything at all.  Finally even the white rice was dry.  My bf was still hungry leaving and we had to find other food elsewhere. Fortunately our server was kind enough to take off the dish we couldn't eat. So it deserves a star.   But for sure we are not coming back"}
{"text":"Didn't like much. Tom yum soup was not like Tom yum type. Not sure why very high review here"}
{"text":"I used to live in Thornhill, and still come to this place, most authentic Thai Place, everything tastes as good as you get in Thailand!"}
{"text":"Traditional Thai cuisine... Quality and taste of their dishes are truly excellent. Service is average. Decor and ambiance is plain. Price is reasonable... Definitely a family favourite."}
{"text":"Thai Bamboo deserves a 3.5 rating.

Decor: Nothing special; kind of drab.

Service: Good.  Based on the conversations I overhead between customers and staff, a lot of regulars dine here.  It's always a good sign when customers keep coming back.

Food: A real mix of very good and mediocre.  The crispy vegetarian spring rolls were large, tasty but also greasy.  They came with a very good dipping sauce.  The beef was chewy yet the red curry sauce and veggies in the same dish were delicious.  The chicken and shrimp pad thai had enough chicken but very few pieces of shrimp.

Prices: Reasonable"}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a shot as I was craving some Thai food and the reviews appeared to be decent. As a huge fan of Pai (Chef Nuit rocks!) which is very much an authentic representation of Thai food, my expectations for Thai Bamboo were modest at best.
The wife and I ordered a green curry chicken dish and a jungle chicken dish. The chicken itself tasted fairly bland and had a dry rubbery texture - I could tell that the chicken had probably been left sitting for awhile before it was tossed into the curry. The green curry seemed a little diluted but the flavors were mildly intact. The jungle chicken curry was dry and had an interesting blend of spices.

All in all, the food was just \"ok\" and I may pop in again to give it another go. However, Pai, Sabai Sabai and Khao San Road still hold top honors for Thai food in the GTA."}
{"text":"Gotta drop these guys down a star.. A little inconsistent with their dishes.. My pumpkin soup last night was missing its shrimp.. And the chili chicken dish for 10.95 was too small.. Still up there but I will direct my next thai takeout to thai basil or restoran Malaysia"}
{"text":"Far and away the BEST Thai restaurant. Many are great but Thai Bamboo is another level. I've brought friends who have their own favourite place and they unanimously agree that Thai Bamboo sets a new standard. Don't let the industrial strip plaza deter you. There is a daily lineup for a reason."}
{"text":"The whole restaurant interior was mostly made out of bamboo as it makes perfect sense they called themselves Thai bamboo. 
I got myself spicy chicken red curry, chicken and shrimps pad Thai, coconut soup, and free veggie fresh rolls (even tho I requested the crispy spring rolls).
The food was good. But I found the spicy curry was way too spicy for my taste. 
The service was okay, a bit slow, and they seemed to forget what I ordered a couple times."}
{"text":"Dropped by for dinner last night and was thoroughly impressed with all the dishes we ordered. I used to work at a Thai restaurant and am very picky about my pad thai but it was on point. Curry, tamarind chicken, and nam khao were all up to standard. Just moved into the York university area and am very happy this restaurant is here. Pricing and staff were great too! This place is like the Khao San Road of the area; honestly, I think I might even prefer Thai Bamboo."}
{"text":"Unfortunately this is a place that I'll never come back to. Most times the restaurant has something going for it, like the food, service, or being cheap, but this place felt like it had none of those things.

My partner and I decided to try this place out since we were close by.

Upon entering we were greeted by a nice waitress. She sat us down and we were grossed out by the table cloth. It had tons of stains on it... Looked like it was out for the whole day.

Two other groups were seated in our area after we arrived and placed our order. One table got all of their food before us and they had 5 dishes.

We ordered the khao soi and beef pad thai. We were disappointed... The khao soi was really bland and noodles were overcooked. The pad thai was mediocre...its not authentic pad thai just FYI...just westernized pad thai. None of the sweet, sour, spicy, salty and bitter flavours.

This place was a miss for me. I was hoping to find a gem, but was left disappointed."}
{"text":"My family and I have been going here for YEARS. The service can be a little slow but it's improved in recent years (the prices have also gone up). 

There's really very little to complain about, they are friendly and the food is DELICIOUS. I've probably been to over twenty thai restaurants but this is by far the best I've eaten. Best Pad Thai in the city, I'm sure of it. Fresh spring rolls (and the sauce), chicken panang, and lemon grass pork are all fantastic too. Chilli chicken is a new favourite. I've brought at least fifteen people to this restaurant over the years, on separate occasions, and only one person didn't like it!"}
{"text":"Been going here for years ... best food ever. Can not find Thai food like this in the GTA. The service isn't the best, but the food is so delicious!!"}
{"text":"I have no idea what these other reviews are raving about! 
I chose this restaurant due to the positive reviews and am quite disappointed - maybe we went on a bad night. 

We went on a busy Saturday night wherein we were lucky and got a table without a wait. The service was incredibly slow, which is understandable due to the volume. We ordered with ease and time glacially passed by as we waited for our payaya salad and our two chicken pad thais. I think probably 30 minutes had passed before the waitress had come over with our salad with apologies. 

The Laos style papaya salad - it wasn't as good as I was expecting and even though I ordered it as mild, it was still spicy. 
Pad Thai: so this is NOT the same quality as Khao Son Road or Pai as reviews seemed to suggest. It tasted along the lines of chinese food noodles, wherein they used a much darker sauce as opposed to the typical tamarind and fish sauce. It was flavourful and it was good to eat, but it's not pad thai. Also the chicken was quite tough. 

The main reason I'm giving this place one star though is the SERVICE. I felt incredibly bad for the waitstaff as they seemed really overwhelmed, but a lot of patrons had a hard time tracking down one of these girls, and they didn't really seem to care. I had to flag two of them to bring me a takeout box and the bill and at the end of the 10 minute venture, I decided to go up to the front to pay as I figure it would have been faster. I was left alone with the machine, and I just left it on the counter, as the waitress quickly left to do something else. I swear, you could have just walked out without paying and no one would have noticed. 
Also, the table next to us, one of the customers did not receive their food and was told that it had run out and no one had the time to let the customer know...he wasn't very happy either. He said, \"YEARS ago, I ordered a ...\" 

Anyways, maybe I went on a really off night when they weren't prepared to handle the volume, but I wouldn't come back! It was NOT worth 40 dollars and I regret every penny"}
{"text":"Ambience & decor: Unassuming place, East Asian decor, very generic. The chair upholstery is quite stained & dirty. (2 stars)
Beverage: They sport an LLBO sign but they have a 1 red & 1 white wines and waitresses are not aware of the variety. They have the usual Thai iced coffee, etc.
Food & service: Staff is very friendly. This is among the best Thai restaurants I have been to in the GTA. I especially liked the fact that they have a separate vegetarian section where the curries are prepared without fish sauce. They are also quite amenable to adapting the non-vegetarian curries to vegetarian ones, again without fish sauce.
We ordered the green, yellow, &, red curries. All of them were very excellent. The vegetable curry puff appetizer was also good. (5 stars),
Will I come back? You betcha!"}
{"text":"We ordered UberEats from here. You can definitely tell that this is not authentic Thai. The chicken pad thai noodles had a distinct beef noodle taste that can only be native to Cantonese cuisine. The spring rolls had a similar vibe - very Chinese in the way the ingredients were prepared. Tom yum soup lacked colour and looked like it was cooked from a can. Overall, food is very \"Chinese-Thai\". Apart from the lack of authenticity, the food as a whole did taste good. If you don't care for authentic Thai and are starving, this place is a place to consider."}
{"text":"Service like shit. no drink no menu, waitress is literally blind. Will never come again"}
{"text":"Awesome Thai. Full of fresh flavor. Some of the best Thai food I have eaten. Too bad I'm from the states otherwise this would be a weekly stop for me!!  Very friendly service as well."}
{"text":"Thai Bamboo is where I go when I'm salivating for some Thai salads (this place has the best!). It's close enough and good enough that I keep coming back (and I've been coming here for years!). 

There are dishes that are unique to Thai Bamboo that I can't get anywhere else (that I know of). The first is the Laos style green papaya salad. Oh my lord it is some spicy, pungent, and crunchy goodness that always hits the spot. It's grated green papaya, tomatoes, and lime wedges that are mixed in a Thai sauce that contains fermented fish paste and fish sauce, with lots of thai bird peppers. It's definitely NOT for the faint of heart! The dish comes with some vermicelli and cabbage to cut the spicyness as well but I like to dip everything in the delicious sauce before taking a bite. When you order this salad and the warm meat salad the server should ask you how many chili peppers you want. For me, 3 is pretty spicy already, and I can handle my spice. If you want something more mild I would go with 1 or 2 peppers.  

The second dish I love from here is the warm meat salad with beef. It comes with lime juices, fish sauce, coriander, green onions, chilli peppers and Thai seasonings. The beef is cooked medium so it's never too chewy. It also comes with tripe as well, which isn't mentioned on the menu. This salad has a similar taste palette to the Laos style papaya salad so if you love that one you'll love this too. I should also mention that I ordered something similar (I thought!!!) to this at Khao San Road and the beef was SUPER overcooked and disgustingly chewy.  

In addition to the salads I always get the shrimp spring rolls (they sell out all the time!!!!) and the shrimp and chicken pad thai. These 4 things are my staples here.

Parking is accessible right outside and they do take out as well as dine in. I usually call ahead when I take out as it takes about 20 minutes for them to prepare your order."}
{"text":"Had a weird experience here with the bae.

We stopped in for a Friday night date and were looking forward to trying the food.

There were three different people who served our table that night. One of them may have been the owner.

We took a few minutes to look at the menu and ended up choosing crispy spring rolls to start, I ordered the coconut soup as my main and the BF chose the spicy ginger beef.

Oddly, the soup came first and since we were starving, we ended up sharing it. The soup was delicious - hot, sweet, and sour at the same time with lots of veggies. 

The spring rolls came out next and they were disappointingly greasy. Like super greasy. Again was starving so ate it anyway.

Last to arrive was bae's dish. It literally tasted like nothing so he let one of the servers know who came back to check on us a very very long time later.

They removed the dish off the bill but we just wanted to get out of there it was very awkward. He ended up getting McDonald's on the way home. WOMP WOMP.

Would not return."}
{"text":"Whenever I am craving for some authentic Laos style papaya salad, this is the place I come to! I always order the chicken red curry, pad Thai, papaya salad and Tom yum soup. The place is small but no reservations are required. They are not that busy.. I'd say this restaurant is underrated! Prices are decent as well and restaurant is clean. The staff is friendly and service is good!"}
{"text":"Truly a hidden gem in an otherwise bland industrial area of Steeles and Keele.

Driving by on Steeles you would never in a million years notice this place exists if not for the word of mouth advertising and online reviews.

Thai Bamboo offers comforting Thai food prepared fresh daily in house.  

Decor is very minimal, not memorable at all. But where it truly shines is where it should always be the number one priority and that is the food.  

Having patronized this place twice during business lunches, my clients are praiseworthy of where I've taken them - which is a great sign for me as it lets them know I can make good choices, which also in my line of work it's all about trust. But I digress.

With Thai food I always get the red curry or Pad Thai, and this place truly shines on this simple noodle dish!  I can't recall a time where I have had Pad Thai this good!  Most other places tend to overuse the oil, or season it too sweet. At Thai Bamboo, the Pad Thai is made just in my opinion. Not overly salty, or sweet, or greasy but just a fine balance in between that brings out the flavor and lemony sweet aroma to the taste buds!

Staff is friendly and courteous, speaking perfect English.  It can get a bit backed up during lunch time where it's filled with blue and white collars workers alike.   

Definitely one of my top places to go to in this industrial zone. Truly a hidden gem for Thai food in Vaughan!"}
{"text":"Service is really nice and the food is super authentic! Just remember that the red curry here is spicy and the green isnt (usually i feel like its the other way around). The portions are big and filling. I took one star off just for ambience - the lighting/decor could use work."}
{"text":"Just tried some take-out from here last night for the first time.  Got the chicken pad thai and the jumbo shrimp red curry.  First I just want to say, how lazy are these people that their \"jumbo shrimps\" aren't even de-shelled or de-veined at all?  The last thing you want to have to worry about at the dinner table is taking the digestive tract out of your shrimp and wiping it on the napkin beside you or whatever.  There is no excuse for this but sheer lazyness.  Also, another thai curry ruined by the ridiculous addition of green bell peppers.  This is NOT a thai ingredient and should not be in your curry.  Now with the bad out of the way, the rest of the food was pretty acceptable.  Pad Thai was the opposite of sweet and a little darker than I'm used to, makes me think they're using soy sauce in it, but the flavor works.  Curry was tasty, although not enough liquid and as I said, ruined by the gigantic chunks of bell pepper and un-prepped shrimp.  Next time I would order it with no bell peppers and change the shrimp to another protein.  I will give it another shot soon and report back."}
{"text":"This is one of the best places for Pad Thai in the city. I've been to Suko Thai, Pai, and Khao San Rd. And I can say that Thai Bamboo does give those guys a run for their money. It's not downtown like the rest of the popular Thai places and parking is free. 
The pad thai here is unstoppable!! Sometimes I switch it up and order the Nam Khao which is a crispy fried coconut rice with pork, lime, and coriander. It's more of acquired taste because it's salty, and sour at the same time, but SOO good! The crispy spring rolls are phenomenal as well. I've also tried their curries, they're pretty good. My close friend says that this place has the best Tom Yum Soup she's ever had in Toronto. I'd say if you're a fan of Tom Yum Soup, you definitely have to try it here. 
The service here alternates between average and great all the time. Depending on how busy the restaurant is and how many waitresses they have. They're always really friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Ordered a takeaway of chicken and shrimp Pad Thai, and while the flavour was good, the chicken was too chewy. Also, the Papaya Salad was not appetizing because of the potent fish-sauce smell and taste."}
{"text":"My colleague introduced me to this place.  We came here for lunch and arrived about a quarter after noon. It wasn't pack yet but as oulunch hour progressed the restaurant did become full. 

Upon arrival was pleasantly surprised that it was a cozy, family-run sit down place rather than a fast food type place. I would not say I am a Thai food enthusiast but I will say the food here is top notch, and one of the better Thai places I have been to. The menu consists of typical Thai food fanfare and the cuisine is quite authentic. I had the pad Thai with beef and it did not taste \"ketchupy\" as some other establishments. The noodles were flavourful and the portions were HUGE for the price (~$10). We started with fried spring rolls and they were fresh and crisp. 

Service was very quick and prompt; the seating,  order taking and arrival of our meals. The restaurant doesn't have any fancy decor, and is kind of dated, but it is clean and gives off a cozy vibe. I would definitely come back here for another lunch!"}
{"text":"Being vegetarian, we have to be careful at Thai restaurants as they are not very accurate about the presence of fish sauce or shrimp paste. Not this place - they explicitly made everything vegetarian, including customizing some items only on their non vegetarian menu for us. We ordered veg curry puffs, a green curry, red curry and a mango preparation (veggie version of mango chicken). All delicious. Large portion sizes and friendly service. Our son ordered the purple rice and mango dessert which was also yum. We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"The other reviews did not lie.  The food is terrific.  I had the tom yum soup.  It oddly included cauliflower, which surprisingly worked very well in it.  The soup was very spicy with lots of lemon grass and was delicious.  Mu jungle curry chicken was also excellent, with good spicy flavour and little, if any, sugar added.  Tom yum soup ordered by others in my party was also first rate, as were pad thai and another noodle dish.  Fresh rolls were as good as one can get.

Very friendly and helpful service.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."}
{"text":"My new favourite Thai spot! It feels great knowing that we no longer need to travel downtown for a good Thai spot. Also might I add, pad Thai has never been for me until I stumbled upon this place. One of the most flavorful pad thai joint ever, and it doesnt taste like ketchup! (Inside joke since most places seem to make it taste like ketchup) I highly recommend trying their spicy seafood salad, pad Thai, crispy chili chicken and OF COURSE THE THAI MILK TEA. Everything about this spot is on point!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome food, great service - the place needs a little help but otherwise don't look up and you will be fine.   I love the CHILI CHICKEN AND PAD THAI -  needed to yell that out it's always great!

thank you and keep up the good food."}
{"text":"Just finished my Thai Bamboo meal with some of my colleagues, and I must say I was impressed considering how much I paid.

I had the Beef Pad Thai. While it's nothing like the awesomeness of Khao San Road in Downtown, the price you pay perfectly suited the quality and quantity I got, in fact maybe even more.

My other colleagues (we had a party of 4) all had the curry tofu, and while they said it was surprisingly spicy, it was delicious as well. Only one managed to finish it though as the rice portions were gigantic.

The only two setbacks I have with this place was that the tables were a bit small for four people (yet five people you get the giant tables), and there doesn't seem to be enough waiters...took a good 15-20 minutes to go through all our bills.

I'll come back when I'm ever in the area again as I live in the opposite end of town."}
{"text":"Pretty good Thai food to be had here.  It's pretty busy most of the time from 6pm on until close. The fish with sweet & sour sauce is quite yummy!! Tried the pumpkin soup for something different from the usual tom yum goong soup. Im a big fan of anything squash related so it was gooooooot!!!  Try it out, u won't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"I ordered the fresh spring rolls after reading another fellow yelper's review, and I am glad I did. One order ($4) gets you two large fresh spring rolls. I thought the size and the amount of filling was ideal. The vermicelli wrap was soft and fresh and the fresh vegetables inside were flavorful and crunchy. For our main course we shared a chicken pad thai. It was a good portion but I have seen larger portions at other Thai restaurants. The pad thai was tasty but nothing special. The restaurant and service was good and would recommend it to others."}
{"text":"When we entered the restaurant, we sat down and under the table was a chicken wing. We kicked it out so the waitress would notice. She walked by several times and the chicken wing is very noticeable but she doesn't pick it up... the restaurant is quite filthy. We ordered Tom
Yum soup, it was sour but good. The crab spring rolls were ok, not the best but not the worst. The papaya salad was way too spicy for us so we did not finish it. I felt it did lack a lot of flavour and only had chilli flavour. I didn't like the way the papaya was cut. It could have been better. The pad Thai tasted more like fried noodles to me, it didn't taste authentic. The red curry beef was good but when we put it over rice, it tasted bland. But on its own tasted delicious, weird. The Thai iced teas we ordered, we liked it however, felt that it wasn't authentic. It tasted like powder was used and the colour wasn't right. You can sort of tell they don't fully use Thai tea or any at all. There was also powder or syrup chunks in my boyfriends. Unfortunately will not be returning as the restaurant is very unsanitary feeling and looking, and there are probably better Thai restaurants in Toronto."}
{"text":"Love this place for the food. 
Great lunch spot. Always packed. 
I've had almost everything on the menu. 
Mango chicken is amazing. 

Though they haven't updated the place in 30 years. Needs a refresh."}
{"text":"Good place. I've eaten here countless times now. The service is good. Most importantly the food is good. Big lunch crowd on the weekdays due to the office people around that commercial area. They do a lot of takeout business too. Call ahead to order and pickup 20min later. 

Try the deep fried sweet and sour fish, its my favourite.  

I'm asian too..... so I think my taste buds are honed well. and I'm not biased toward any food or culture in particular."}
{"text":"I had lunch at Thai Bamboo Restaurant today.  I'd had lunch there last year and it was good!

I ordered Green Curry Chicken and it was delicious!  Yum!

The servers were friendly and quick.  It's a busy spot and I could have been in and out within a half hour."}
{"text":"The food here is flat out good! Looks like this is a mom and pop family owned restaurant = authentically delicious cuisine. My family and I are on vacation in Toronto and were craving Thai food. So glad we found this place! Order the Yom Tum soup, the spicy tamarind chicken, the orange shrimp with cashews, and the vegetable egg noodles. Each and every dish was perfection when it came to flavor. If I ever come back to town, I'd be willing to stop on by again. The $$ was VERY GOOD for the quality and quantity you get. Grade A in my book."}
{"text":"Based on reviews that I read on Yelp, I decided to check out this restaurant. It lived up to all the positive reviews that I had read.

The food was of a high quality and the portion size was generous. After my dish with no appetizers or deserts I was very full.

The only thing I did not like was something outside the restaurant's control, which was the amount of traffic on Steeles Avenue West. It was a pain to turn left to get into the parking lot."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I love Thai food and hate being disappointed so I avoid trying new places.. however being a Thai lover I was telling some friends how I frequent Pai too often, they recommended Thai Bamboo and told me it's better than Pai. That comment set the bar pretty high in my opinion.

We ordered the papaya salad (Thai version) -It was okay, the papaya could've been sliced a little thinner and it could've been more tasty. 

Tom yum soup (shrimp) - it was more sour than anything and didn't really taste like much. Quite watery. 

Pad Thai (chicken) - good no complaints. It did come with more egg than I'm used to but it I was indifferent to it. 

Green curry chicken with two sides of rice - finally something that had a little more taste to it! A little on the spicy side. 

Thai iced tea - Good, definitely recommending ordering this with your meal. I probably could've drank two but didn't because that's too much caffeine for myself.

Just an FYI I asked for everything to be mild because my friend who can handle her spice told me they make things spicy here. As for the service, it was really busy when I arrived so the service wasn't that great. Our water wasn't refilled once and they didn't really check on us."}
{"text":"I fucking love thai bamboo. I love it so much that I'm leaving the country tomorrow and I chose it as my last supper. The shrimp pad thai is unforgettable. I love the fresh shrimp spring rolls and today for the first time i tried the shrimp and pork rolls. All unreal. I never want this eating to end. 

Prices are reasonable for the quality. 10$ or so for a large order of pad thai. I always eat the whole thing but that's another story.

Go here. I just realized I've already written a review for this place. That's how much I love it."}
{"text":"Pure OK place, i ordered a delivery from them, spring rolls were solid, fried rice tasty but very very fried. Beef was hard to chew Nd chicken was ok, the soups were good especially the chicken and corn one. 
Will give it one more shot for sure though."}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere & ambiance. Food was nicely presented, received good & welcoming service."}
{"text":"So i've been back a couple times now and I think the horrible service I received on my first visit was them being overloaded, because it's been consistently good the last 2 times.

I love their fresh spring rolls as an appetizer (exactly as an appetizer should be: cheap and brought out quickly). Their pad thai is very tasty, but if you like spicy you have to ask for it to be made spicy or for some hot sauce, because the default is VERY mild (almost sweet without it). Their jungle curry on the other hand is extremely spicy and was also a very generous portion.

They open at 11am and by noon it was pretty packed, but we found showing up around 11:30 was still fairly empty and got our order in before the lunch rush."}
{"text":"We came here for a baby shower and they were super accommodating. I can see why this place is packed on a Saturday! My friends told me when they are doing take out, they usually have to wait 50 minutes and sometimes longer because of how busy it is but the food is worth it!

A nice Thai and Laos restaurant with real authentic Asian food! It is so rare to find an authentic restaurant like this! Their papaya salads are amazing, taste like my moms and love the fact that they included noodles, cabbage and cucumbers. A couple of the ladies got the beef lap and chicken lap. Both were delicious! Should definitely order it next time. 

I wanted to try something else since everyone was sticking to the lap and papaya salad so I got the crispy chilli Chicken and shrimp spring rolls. The spring rolls are simply amazing. So delicious, crispy and filled with lots of shrimp! My dish on the other hand was alright, nothing to rave about. It was good but I really wished I should have gotten the vermicelli curry soup that I've been seeing on Yelp! That looked amazing, will definitely try it next time. If you're planning to host a dinner here, make sure you make reservations ahead of time!"}
{"text":"I lived in Laos and Thailand for a total of 7 yrs as a child and this is the only place that reminds me of my childhood tastebuds! They have Lao style papaya salad and the beef salad which is cooked to perfection and not too chewy! My entire family and friends were forced to try this place because of me and they all love it! The curries on the menu can be a hit or miss at times but the salads are what keeps me returning."}
{"text":"Good ambience and overall good food. Barring mango salad rest was nothing special but you can sure go once in a while to this place. Fried rice, panang curry were good as well"}
{"text":"I wanted authentic thai food like how my mom makes it so I decided to try this spot out after checking out their menu options. I had their laap (chicken salad) and papaya salad - it definitely was worth it. I would go back again to try out more."}
{"text":"Do not understand why it's so busy.  Perhaps it's because nothing else is good in this area.

The only item that's edible from the menu is pad thai.  
Tried cashew chicken on rice and it was awful......."}
{"text":"Service is ok. Must get the waiters attention to order or get the bill. 

Decor is very nice. Lots of Thai Buddhist pieces such as statues and pictures. Wouldn't return due to lack of flavour and service."}
{"text":"Thai Bamboo is decent Thai restaurant in the area.

Good price, Friendly Services and Good Food!

Chicken Pad Thai ($8.95) extra spicy is quite nicely done, spiced up with chili pepper and fresh from the wok!! Yummmy!

Deco is really simple and with tons of bamboo...

Thai Bamboo is worth your while if you are in the neighbourhood and have cravings for some Thai food. Not the best but will do..."}
{"text":"Awesome Thai food. I drive from midtown just to get it. The peanut chicken is out of this world."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite thai house in Toronto! Authentic food, with fair price. Staff are polite. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Great place for delicious Thai food.. We've been coming here for years. They serve delicious authentic Thai dishes, that are fresh and generous portions. We usually get chicken pad thai, with red or green curry, gold house fried rice and basil beef; which has been consistently tasty. The spring rolls (both fresh and fried) are tasty- get extra sweet peanut dipping sauce and drizzle on your pad Thai for extra deliciousness!!  You can modify the spicy see on your tolerance. The only downside is this place is this place is a tad higher on the price scale compared to others. I highly recommend this place to anyone in the area looking for tasty, filling and authentic Thai food!"}
{"text":"It's been awhile since I have been to Thai Bamboo.  The first time I went there for lunch, I had ordered the crispy spring rolls and they were so delicious.  My friends ordered various dishes - pad thai, spicy noodles and vegetarian curries and the portions were huge and we couldn't finish. However, I had the coconut soup and found it mediocre, it needed more punch. 

I was in the area this week and decided to pick up some spring rolls.  They were hot,fresh and the dipping sauce was just right.  The staff are very friendly. Not just that the food is great, but the washrooms are the cleanest I have ever used for a busy restaurant (if this is important to you)."}
{"text":"Wanted some decent priced Pad Thai. 
This place was absolutely delicious. 
Great portions , fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"This place was good! Prices are reasonable and the food is tasty. I've only ever had the pad thai, pad sew or wonton soup. Would definitely order from here again. I've only done take out and it's unfortunate it's far from my house or I'd be there all the time (so maybe it's a good thing after all...)"}
{"text":"Try the peanut chicken and pad Thai...u will NEVER find any other place better than this..."}
