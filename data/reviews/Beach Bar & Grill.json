{"text":"My husband and I enjoyed our lunch while relaxing. We had beautiful view of the beach and wave pool. The service was great. Our waiter made sure we had plenty of drinks and our food was delicious. I can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"This place is conveniently located right next to the pool at Mandalay Bay. It has a pretty great lunch menu for a poolside grill. I only ordered the chicken caeser salad which was spot on for a light pool snack.   If you're staying at the resort for a long period of time, I would recommend investing in the Souvenir cup for all your beverages. It costs a little more than a regular adult beverage, but you get twice as much drink and you get a discount for all follow on drinks. Like I said, only a good investment if you plan on having a good time by the pool of you know what I mean."}
{"text":"Convenient spot to grab snacks near the Mandalay & Delano pool areas.  It wasn't busy when we stopped in for lunch a couple of times, and the breakfast menu just finished at 10:30am. Everyone enjoyed their eats: BLT sammich, sliders, buffalo chicken wrap, chicken tenders, and Cobb salad w/ request making it into a wrap (+ upcharge). I wanted a lighter bite and got the tofu Thai wrap with fries (+ upcharge), which hit the spot. The plate comes with a good amount of crispy fries to share. In hindsight, I probably would've been content with kettle chips since I saw them on someone else's plate and crunched on a few.  Service was friendly and prompt. Water glasses arrived within minutes followed by our waitress, Heather (congrats again on the baby bump), who quickly got our drink requests and made menu recommendations. Even though we forgot to bring our souvenir cups with us the second time, she remembered us and charged refill cocktail prices while I retrieved our sippers from the hotel room.  Plates looked great and everyone checked on us often for drink refills.  Depending on where your seated, you'll get a decent view of the pool scene, the performance stage, or whatever sporty thing might be playing at the bar flatscreens.  Random observation: all but one of the ceiling fans were spinning."}
{"text":"Slow service! Got seated took almost 15 for any kind of attention.. we got out water. Waited for another 5 minutes then finally got a server to ask for our order. Doesn't make any sense.. almost walked out! I think should we have placed our order at our reserved seating in front of the wave pool, things would have gotten faster.. To top it off, it wasn't even busy!!!! Server was nice but it doesn't excuse our wait time!"}
{"text":"Love love love! Bomb south of the boarder  menu, cocktails are boozy and tasty, bartender Marfil is a total doll! Go see him!!"}
{"text":"The food is overpriced and the quality of the food is horrible.  You have to be drunk to eat here.  I ordered the BLT and I had to ask where is the bacon?? Vegas has gotten to be so expensive without the quality now.  I guess Vegas is for the twentysomethings who don't care about quality anymore"}
{"text":"Loved our lunch here! Spencer was awesome (go wildcats!), informative and a lot of fun! We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"$14 for 12 oz single mixed drink, decent options for varied food preferences, slower service but can't beat the location!  We waited a while to even have our order taken, but the water checked on our dietary needs and was quite nice.  Right by the water, out of the sun!"}
{"text":"All I can say is this place was not worth the wait. Food is good but waiting 35 minutes when there is open tables is a little ridiculous. Lots of unhappy people waiting to be seated in open tables at lunch time on Saturday, Father's Day Weekend!"}
{"text":"So cost vs what you get just isn't there. Restaurant was severely understaffed. Mojito didn't have any alcohol in it. Order came out wrong. Food was ok. I would not go back."}
{"text":"When the sun and alcohol ware you down, come sit in the shade at the beach bar and grill.  The food is good and the price is average. You pay a little more for convenience and Vegas but when your drunk and hungry, this is only a stumble away.  I opted for a healthier option and went with the grilled veggie wrap and side salad. Both hit the spot while allowing me to save some calories for the buffet I planned on having later at night.  Nice staff and fast service. Check them out before you pass out in the sun and wake up looking like a lobster."}
{"text":"Great outdoor vibes by the pool. Staff is excellent! Super friendly and very attentive service. Food was subpar but the great atmosphere makes up for it! Shrimp tacos were on point, highly recommend. Also best iced coffee. Livin life and LOVING VEGAS"}
{"text":"Would be nice if their (MandalayBay) website reflected accurately their hours are seasonal!!  Instead of walking all over the hotel looking for it just to find out it is closed.  Thanks for wasting our morning."}
{"text":"Clara was our server. The servers wear bikinis in red that make them look like lifeguards. it's cute we had the chicken panini that was supposed to come with sun-dried tomatoes and it didn't have it in the sandwich, so that made me disappointed. I also had the shrimp Caesar salad. Clara said the shrimp were grilled and they came out like after you boil shrimp. I wish it could be better, but what kind of food can you expect when you're on the beach."}
{"text":"Surprisingly tasty place at Mandalay Bay.  The sandwiches are fairly affordable and my buffalo chicken wrap was delicious as were the fries.  My friend had a salad that was awesome as well. Service was very nice, you have a great view of the pool, but you're not in the direct sun so it's nice and comfortable.  There are plenty of overpriced restaurants at Mandalay Bay, but this seems like a decent bargain. I recommend it."}
