{"text":"So happy this finally it finally opened near me! No more 40 minute drives to get a cheesecake!!! This location is a treat pop-up concept also includes Eva's Original Chimneys and Squish Candies. Love Me Sweet is a bakery that specializes in making Japanese-style cheesecakes. 

Cheesecakes are made fresh in the morning every day, so once they are gone they're gone. Come earlier if you want something specific or it may be sold out!

My personal favorite is the traditional cheesecake, a classic. Extremely soft and cheesy and melts in your mouth. I also really love the way they package their cheesecakes, the little red bags are so adorable and eye catching! 

Be sure to try out the original cheesecake at least once, you may be surprised and find your new favorite obsession! Also, the lines are crazy! Be prepared to wait 10-15 minutes to order. :)"}
{"text":"This is situated inside Square One next to the Simon's department store. 

Its a fairly good Japanese cheesecake and I definitely recommend this if your planning to give someone a nice simple (food) gift since the overall packaging is great.

We got the original and the chocolate cheesecake and in my opinion I like the original better. 

If you would like to avoid any lines (or just dont like lines at all) then definitely go on a weekday because its ridiculously busy on a weekend. But of course, the line for this shop isn't as bad so its a quick in and out I must say."}
{"text":"For those of you looking for other types of cheese cake you should check out Love Me Sweet Japanese Cheesecake. I would say they are one of the best within the GTA. Come check them out at Square one, their staffs are super nice and friendly. Highly Recommend it!!!"}
{"text":"I've tried there cheese tart.  For a tart that size for the price of $3.99 is kinda pricey not to mention it wasn't even good.  Uncle Tetsu and Lucullus has way better cheese  tart."}
{"text":"Great cheese tarts and japanese cheesecake!  Also great customer service! Thankfully there was no lineup when we went so we got our goodies pretty quick."}
{"text":"And the busy holiday shopping continues with less than 10 days til Christmas. Stopped by to get some goodies after a running ard at the mall. Its was quite. No line up at all. Welcomely greeted by the staff from the neighbouring  Squish lol 
The menu seems to be missing a few items from what i saw on social media from their other stores. But im not 100% sure. This is my first time trying them out. 

What I got: 
The Lava cheese tart
-Original flavour 
-Matcha flavour 

Brought them home to share cuz its not like there were seats. Staff also did not instruct me on how i should prep to eat it. So i asked and she responded with sure you can heat it up but i like it cold. But that wouldnt make it a lava tart then...? Got home and opened up the box. And my tarts were all over the place (matcha one was scarred as ull see. In the pics). I blamed myself cuz i was carrying a ton of gifts i purchased. But to realize that they had the perfect packaging with the perfect slots. She just didnt pack them properly for me or she didnt know how to make use of the box. Felt like inwas more welcomed by the neighbouring stores. Dont know if that has anything to do with them being at the very back. 

The tarts were pretty good.  I personally prefer to heat it up so it gives that half baked/ lava texture. Ive had better ones and fresh out of the oven ready to eat right away in store. For these ones, i liked the original flavoured ones more."}
{"text":"I was so excited for a Japanese cheesecake to open up closer to home (Hamilton) so I didn't have to journey to Toronto for Uncle Tetsu. 

Love Me Sweet is located in a little corner besides Simons with Eva's Chimneys and this little vegan gummy bear store. 

There was no line so that was great but a little disconcerting. 

The verdict is: uncle tetsu or HCafe is better. 
LMS cake is a little denser like the American cheesecake - which I am not going for when shopping for Jap cheesecake. The bottom was also a little burnt. 
Uncle Tetsu all the way for the light, fluffy, melt in your mouth cheesecake."}
{"text":"Finally a place that sells Japanese cheesecake close by. I have to say that the original cheesecake is very comparable to uncle tetsu. The cheese tart tasted good too but a bit pricey. It's more liquidy then uncle tetsus tart."}
