{"text":"I will start off by saying that the food is delicious. The staff are nothing but college aged kids that they got off local campuses. For the price that this company charges, I was expecting more professionalism. I talked to one kid who said that they hire anyone and she did not have to go through any training or interview. The waitstaff was not helpful and did not seem to care about anything that was going on. I would not recommend them to anyone I know."}
{"text":"Thank you so much for a wonderful experience! Best Impressions  catered our wedding for around 400 people.  They were always professional, great to deal with, reasonably priced, and served amazing food!!! Our guests couldn't stop commenting on how delicious everything was.  Would definitely recommend!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Best Impressions catered the Black and White Gala at the Mint Museum. They did an excellent job with the entire spread.  They made sure that there was something for everyone - including Roasted Vegetables,  Ravioli filled with butternut squash, shrimp and grits, roasted turkey, red meat,roasted potatoes, and much more. If you are looking for a catering company that executes beautifully, you might want to check them out!"}
{"text":"Wow, I don't give many 5 stars but Best Impressions earned this one.  They catered our recent wedding at Daniel Stowe Botanical Garden and they hit it out of the park.  From working with Daniel and his staff to the excellent grub to the professional wait staff, that did an excellent job.  Several guests have praised the quality of the food, preparations, and accommodations and they were one of our easiest vendors to work with.  I recommend them hands down!"}
{"text":"I only tried a few samples of their goods today because I ran across their table of free samples at the South Park Mall of all places.  I have to say, I would have gladly gone back, cash in hand, for more!  What did I try, you ask?  Well I began with the mini baked loaded potato, which was perfectly decorated with just enough cheddar and bacon..mmmm.  Even after sitting out, the potato was not dried out at all, it was exactly the bite you want out of this tasty treat.  There was also crab cakes bites accompanied by a drop of some kind of spicy sauce, also yummy.  Then there was a mini sandwich of some sort, honestly had a hard time deciphering what exactly was in it...some kind of cranberry cream cheese and meat...eeh.  Then, saved the best for last, a bite if puffed brie with a brush of honey.   All in all, I would absolutely recommend their catering to any kind of event from wedding to corporate!"}
{"text":"Alright where do I begin?  First of all, my wife and I cannot thank David Byron and his team enough for saving our wedding in less then a week time!! Not only save but made our wedding experience the best ever!  My wife and I before we got married shopped around vendors to do our wedding.  We went through a lot of the vendors that was on the list of our wedding venue at the Foundation for the Carolinas downtown Charlotte.  I work for a local company who's owner always used Best Impression for special events such as our company Christmas party. Therefore my wife and I were familiar with their food and OMG is it amazing!!  Highlight is their crab cakes , which is the best crab cake you will ever have. I'm telling you, we are crab cake fanatics and had them everywhere all over the world no one does that better then them!!  Through the process, David and his team worked with us on putting a menu of their crab cakes, filet station, risotto, a mushroom combination side which was also FANTASTIC!  Btw , we had these late night snacks with a braised pork belly Bao Slider which was insane!! Just as good as if you were to get it in NY or even Taiwan!  They are not limited to one genre of cuisine, trust in their chef and staff as they really know how to put flavors together... trust me I'm a huge foodie and they exceeded my expectation!  All in all, their food, service, staff, is a perfect combination of quality, flavor, and customer service.   It's funny as  EVERY vendor and I mean EVERY vendor we shopped, wanted to win our business over Best Impressions. I'm kind of shock there is not enough reviews on yelp but boy I honestly don't think they need it, everyone knows them!   They really live up too their reputation!  I can't wait for our photographer to have all the pictures up and I can post pictures of the stations and food!   If you have not tried already, give them shot..because you know what the local say,  \"once you go Best Impressions, you don't go back ;) haha\"   Thank you again to David and his team for a memorable wedding! ! -Donny and Mollie"}
{"text":"Overall I was happy with the quality for the price, but all of our tables had white napkins except one that had black napkins that really stood out, there was rain and tables were moved inside and 4 large vases at $65 a piece were broken, so not all of the tables matched and vases I would have been able to resell after the wedding were destroyed. The mac n cheese that was suppose to be served in martini glasses was served on plates instead. The service was very good and someone came to our table to make sure we had all the food we wanted; although they did run out of gluten free mac and cheese. The caterers helped to pack up the extra cake and bring everything down stairs to take home. It was difficult to get a finalized menu ahead of time so we had to print the menus the week of the wedding which would have been nice to do ahead of time."}
