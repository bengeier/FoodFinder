{"text":"Good enough for a quick bite following a late night of kids activities.  Given the area, you cannot complain that there is actually a local pizza place.  Eating inside was an adventure in itself.  Couple that with people watching and you have one heck of an evening."}
{"text":"Great childhood memories but absolutely horrible pizza & customer service Tuesday night! If I could leave NO stars I would. Both our pies had no cheese or at least not enough to be considered pizza. When we called to complain the young man did NOT want to hear it & firmly stated all ingredients are weighed out period. Left my name & # for the manager/owner to call me (because he was too busy) and still have received nothing. I WILL NEVER GO BACK"}
{"text":"A Grafton staple. Excellent crust. The sweet pizza sauce is trademark. Prices are fair. Great mom and pop spot that continues to deliver."}
{"text":"Pretty good pizza. Its cool this little town has a local pizza place. It is more expensive compared to macros which is down the road, but it is always good to try something different."}
