{"text":"They have very good equipment, the finest there is for making excellent coffee. Unfortunately they seem to be lacking a good barista. I burnt my tongue with a single espresso and they answered as if it's perfectly normal. They knew the machine was set to 94 C (201 F) but they probably have no idea if it's actually coming out at that temperature. Too bad. They roast their own beans on site so they're wasting really fresh grinded coffee! We also had a latte which was very good to taste but very thick foam (cappucino style, NOT latte). Overall spent 50$ there and they didn't even offer me another shot. I guess they wouldn't even know how to adjust the temperature on their Aurelia."}
{"text":"C'est d'abord et avant tout une brûlerie. Le café est donc bien préparé. Peu importe la forme que vous aimez. Par contre les déjeuners sont assez ordinaires. Si vous mangez des rôties avec confitures et oeuf standard, ça va. Mais si vous êtes du genre oeufs bénédictines avec accompagnements de pommes de terre rôties, Etc ...  allez ailleurs."}
{"text":"Just had a great breakfast at Roy's. I ordered the house French toast with latte, where both very good and tasty. The presentation of the French toast was very appealing. They have both inside and outside sitting, with no e decoration. They roast their own coffee, so if you want the smell of the coffee stay inside. Overall very nice experience."}
