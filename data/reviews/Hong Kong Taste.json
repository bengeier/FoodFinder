{"text":"Used to be fantastic, 2007-10. Because of that we keep giving it another chance. It is terrible and bland now. They shrunk the containers, destroyed the food. It's ashame, we ate it for years and now I would rather eat a frozen TV dinner."}
{"text":"The food is exactly what you'd expect from a place called Hong Kong Taste.  Here's the breakdown of my rating:

4 stars for a cheap Chinese restaurant having quite a few vegetarian options.
3 stars for the food taste (and they do spicy levels upon request).
2 stars for food quality (it isn't awful, but likely has astronomic levels of sodium and/or MSG).
1 star for their delivery driver (he's literally stupid and really rude, even though we tip him).
0 stars for them not listening to us and giving us 3 billion sauce packets, a menu, and free crab rangoon (we're vegetarians!) - very wasteful.  We are very against waste.

All that averaged out equals 2 stars, but I gave them a 3 because my rating is more food-based than service-based, and restaurants like this are automatically starting out @ 2.5 stars to begin with based on what most are usually like.  The only thing that actually surprised me is positive: the veggie options.  My rating likely wouldn't change unless the food quality and veggie options were taken to a new level, but in my opinion the Etna/Shaler area definitely needs an Asian restaurant with the likes of China Palace (Shadyside), Thai Cuisine (Bloomfield), or Thai Place (Shadyside, Fox Chapel, Wexford)."}
{"text":"The Got my order wrong, gave rice instead of Lo Mein but it was still good and filling"}
{"text":"I have been ordering from this place regularly for at least 5 years. Their Lunch Specials are great...decent sized portions of: meat(s) of your choice, white or fried rice, choice between 3 soups, a crab Rangoon, and an egg roll for around $7...can't beat that! Delivery was always on time, usually early.

However...they have recently changed their menu without updating the website. So all of those lunch specials that we loved so much are either gone or different. And unfortunately the staff isn't equipped to make suggestions on similar items when you try to place an order.

So, if you try to order from there, make sure you have an orange menu, not the green one!!!

Even with today's not-having-the-right-menu disappointment, still one of my favorite places for quick, cheap, always delicious Chinese food!"}
{"text":"This place used to be an awesome place to order from. They offer delivery but yet there's no drivers to deliver the stuff. The food is bland and then when they do have delivery drivers it takes like three hours for you to get your food unless you go pick it up. Please change the way you do things or you will go out of business."}
{"text":"Food is great.
Ben Ben chicken highly recommended
Fortune cookies are a downer

{"text":"Was told to try this takeout...it's good Chinese food..and service is fast for delivery.  So just tried them out today.  Prices are really reasonable...a good amount of food...but just ehhhhhh.....didn't really taste that great...will not be ordering from here again"}
{"text":"This place has decent Chinese food, and we have gotten it twice. We just called and ordered some and decided on getting it delivered. An hour later and we still haven't gotten our food. The delivery service is awful considering this is a first time experience."}
{"text":"I tried this for the first time after living in the area for 8 months, and I am sitting here with $27 of Chinese food that all has a strange taste/odor about it. It's a weird smoky sweet taste that's in everything I ordered. I ordered shrimp lo mein, moo goo gai pan, steamed dumplings and shrimp egg rolls with the intention of having leftovers for lunch and dinner tomorrow. It's a shame that I'm going to be throwing away all this food because I can't get restaurant nightmares out of my head. Something isn't right about it."}
{"text":"Edible, inexpensive, chinese-ish food.  If you enjoy chinese-ish food, you won't hate this place.  I didn't.  And...literally the best chinese food in all of Etna.  That said...of course...ONLY chinese food in Etna.  

Still...

Fast, cheap, open...it filled my belly and nothing came back up!  YAY!

Bland, blah, good option if you haven't eaten and you're walking in Etna and the other places are closed."}
{"text":"Decided to try Hong Kong Taste out today.  I ordered the sweet & sour chicken, vegetable fried rice, and an egg roll.  Everything tasted bland and had a soggy texture to it. Was it edible? Yes, but not enjoyable at all.  I don't think I will be ordering from here very often.  I don't recommend a visit if you can help it."}
{"text":"Good take out style chinese...got the lunch special and couldn't even finish it It was so big...same dude was there staring at me.  Maybe hes the delivery driver?"}
{"text":"Wanted to try something new and decided to order from this place with a co-worker.  I got through one crab rangoon (which was not good at all) and 2 bites of my egg roll.....i opened my sweet and sour sauce to pour on my chicken and the was a giant fruit fly floating in it. My co-worker also found a couple in his general tso...not pleased at all and won't be going back."}
{"text":"Hong Kong Taste is a Chinese food joint where you are going to get a lot of food for not a lot of money. It won't be the best Chinese food you've ever had, but you will get a lot of it."}
{"text":"I used to order from this place all the time.  The last 3 orders were garbage.  Bland and flavorless.  It's almost as if they have a Jekyll and Hyde chef duo; one time it's tasty, the next is horrible.  I finally threw the menu away and I am sorry to see you go HKT.  Two stars because you used to have good food in the past.  Now...not so much."}
