{"text":"Friendly service, good chips & salsa. But the food was very disappointing. Cheese was terrible. Not sure what it was but never going to return to this place."}
{"text":"Great prices for a lot of food! Staff and manager were super nice this was a great find.  Only feedback is to get wifi"}
{"text":"Awesome Mexican food! Always made fresh and served hot. Prices are cheep for the amount of food that comes on the plate. Family favorite!"}
{"text":"I came in with some of my coworkers for lunch on Sunday and the first thing I had noticed was how empty and dull the place looked. Once we were seated I also noticed how dirty the floor and underneath the table was.   The waitress asked us for drinks then gave us time to make our order. We waited at least 5 mins for our drinks which was odd because we were the only ones there.  While we were waiting about 3 other servers aproached us to ask what our drinks would be and every time we would have to explain that we already ordered the drinks.  After we ordered our food (I ordered the steak burrito)  which was about $10-$11. The burrito had like 4 pieces of overly cooked thin steaks. All the burrito contained was a little bit of rice a pinch of lettuce and a little bit of tomatoes.  My food was warm,  a little on the cold side, and extremely bland.  This place is NOT authentic whatsoever. A chipotle burrito would've been a way better investment."}
{"text":"Good food, good service, great prices. The service is above average, as are the beverages."}
{"text":"This was our 4th or 5th time dining here. During our last visit the server walked away and never returned to collect the check. During the current visit, we asked the server a question and she simply walked away ignoring the other guests. When we notified the manager, Luis of the issue, he stated he would talk to the server but did not offer to rectify the situation. I will not be returning to this restaurant and would not recommend to others. Keep your money and do not patronize them."}
{"text":"I have to be honest.  The food was decent.  It wasn't good, it wasn't bad.  But, the thing that disgusted me the most was when the 1st dish that came to me was the wrong dish, and the waiter noticed it before me.  I had actually dug my knife into the burrito, and the waiter quickly whisks the plate away and says \"sorry wrong plate\", and delivers it to a few tables behind me.  That in itself deserves 1 star.    For Mexican food, I go to Nuevo Acapulco in North Olmsted.  I've been going there for years, and it's a wonderful authentic Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"Been coming here every Sat. with my husband and kids (when they're in town) for the past few years. Get the same thing - 2 chili rollino's and a side of guacamole.  Yum yum  yum! I start craving them middle of the week. I've eaten at a lot of Mexican restaurants - Arizona, Utah, New Mexico, Colorado - El Rodeo gets the trophy! Colorful atmosphere, authentic food and free Spanish lessons every Saturday (failing miserably but they never seem to give up!)"}
{"text":"Not somewhere I would go to a second time around. Food tasted like it was something you'd pull out of your freezer. And nothing screams Mexican like the guy serving you moping the floors right next to where you're eating. I would not recommend this place to anyone. Even for a cheap Mexican date night."}
{"text":"I can only assume that the other review for this place was written by its owner.   Sure, the decor is colorful but, sad to say, the food leaves a whole lot to be desired.  I tried the only mole dish on the menu and I was very disappointed.  Maybe they do a better job with the standard \"mexican\" food... but, the tortilla that came with my watery chicken mole was crusty around the edges and clearly not fresh.  Go someplace else for your Mexican \"fix\"."}
{"text":"Ordered  2 taco lunch with no cheese.  Out cone just two tacos.  Ordered  2 batches of salsa and had to be changed  because  I only had 2 tacos  and water.  I had 2 tacos only because  the waitress messed up. Last time here.  !2.50 for salsa."}
{"text":"We have visited El Rodeo since it opened in Middleburg Hts. Its a shame as this one has gone way down hill over the years.  Food was average at best, presentation was bland like the food. Service by our Russian waitress was great but we never caught her name. Workers and patrons didn't seem happy in there and on a Friday after work I would have expected a large crowd but over 3/4 of the place was empty. Not a good sign."}
{"text":"We nick name this place the \"Mexican Mc Donalds\". Once you go inside you'll see exactly what we mean. LoL.  The food is a bit bland and not really what I expected. This is my second time there in 3 years and the food is still unchanged since then. The prices seem to be on par with any other Mexican type restaurant in this area but I did not think it was worth it. There are better Mexican places to eat at that have better food.  The waitress was very nice and she made our visit much more pleasant than the food did."}
{"text":"I won't be back.   My wife and I used to go here all the time. The last time we were in the food was mediocre rand the service was terrible. Figuring this to be a fluke we went back. Service was minimal at best and that was the highlight of going there. The food tasted like salt and the portions were small for the prices paid. $10 for a bean burrito, spinach enchilada and bean tostada that were sized for kids was a huge disappointment.   Save your money and go elsewhere. Taco Bell would be better."}
{"text":"Had the Carnitas Enchiladas,  not to my liking. Meat was overly dry.  So just not acceptable.  Also ordered their new to menu as they say, Lobster qeuso,  it was not lobster as advertised. They use imitation crab legs known as Sea legs also. It is nothing more than processed fish with red food coloring on the exterior of the fish. I tried to find some lobster and there was none.  So keep this in mind when ordering the New Lobster qeuso or the Lobster Enchiladas.  No lobster !  Guacamole was a bit tired, was not as fresh as it should have been. Had a geeyish color which means it was prepared more than likely a day prior."}
{"text":"Dinner for nine, served so fine. Everyone had a great time. Food was great, I think they rate. I'd give them a ten, but for rhythms sake I'll call them high eight."}
{"text":"Great Mexican food, not entirely authentic though. The meals are fairly inexpensive, service is decent, and food comes out quickly. Definitely one of my favorites!"}
{"text":"Fast service and very friendly - our server Lupe was the best!"}
{"text":"About a dozen of us met for dinner there last Thursday. Not too crowded (I think a debate was going on that night. Big deal!) and we were seated immediately (we had called ahead). Staff was very polite, friendly and attentive.   First off: they have very good salsa with chips. The queso dip is also among the best. The margarita was rather sweet, but also quite good.  My combination dinner consisted of a beef enchilada, a beef burrito and a cheese-filled chili relleno (diner's choice). It came out hot and sizzling. The beef had a nice cumin flavor to it. And the sauce smothering my dinner, the red sauce, was absolutely fantastic! Well worth returning for. It was so good that when I discovered my relleno was beef filled instead of cheese, I DIDN'T CARE. I ate every morsel on my plate. Nothing was going home.  In spite of the above mentioned mix-up I am still giving the place 5 stars. It was that good. I look forward to returning and trying some other things on the menu."}
{"text":"HOT PLATE COLD FOOD!  Was disappointed last night upon returning to El Rodeo after having several family birthday dinners here. Our waiter kept forgetting things all night but he was super nice and seemed new so we gave him a good tip anyway.  However, someone forgot to prepare my mom's dish and she had to watch the rest of us eat for a good 10 minutes after asking for her food twice. Waiter nicely apologized, however, when her dinner finally did arrive it was COLD. My food also turned cold quickly and the entire table soon realized that the plates were hot but the food was not! I had a cheese burrito that was simply a chunk of non-melted cheese.  I cut into it and thought \"is this chicken?\" Also, the waiters kept scooping up our plates while we were practically still chewing food and one young lady interrupted my conversation and asked me to pass her the pile of plates sitting in the middle of our table. I did it for her, but this should never happen. As a former server, I know to quietly reach for plates and walk away if guests a talking.  Just a disappointing experience overall.  The menu is large and the price is right, but not sure we will continue to hold our family birthday dinners here."}
{"text":"If this had been the first Mexican  restaurant I had ever been to, I would be one of those people who say \"I don't like Mexican food\". I, however,  LOVE Mexican food. I DID NOT like the Mexican food at El Rodeo. Stringy, tough steak fahitas, guacomole seemingly from a food service, salsa was \"meh\", chips warm but a bit stale, enchaladas Mexicana uninspiring, margarhitas from a mix. It WAS clean."}
{"text":"Probably the worst margaritas in Cleveland. If putting Parrot Bay or Malibu in your regular Margarita on the rocks is good, El Rodeo needs a wake up call. Appetizer dips are quite small and only serve one person.  Noticed the wait staff putting their hands in the glassware then serving drinks in them as well - disgusting. Lack of service at the bar was also a problem. I'd rather stand and eat my food at Nuevo Acapulco (which has excellent food and margaritas, but is always packed) than eat here. Needless to say, I'll not be coming back."}
{"text":"Today was the best quesadilla I have had in any Mexican restaurant ever. Today the chicken was so tender. The queso cheese was perfect with warm chips. I haven't been here in so long I forgot how good the food was. Would highly recommend plus there's an outdoor patio if the weather ever gets nice."}
{"text":"Fresh chips and excellent salsa kicked off the meal, which moved on to a pitcher of margaritas -- a bit sweet to my taste, but the addition of orange slices was an interesting touch.   For dinner I had a dish I can't remember the name of -- it was essentially a hash of steak, chorizo, onions, and cilantro. The name may not be memorable, but the dish was: a fantastic combination of flavors, not too spicy, served in a sizzling rock bowl.   I was a bit disappointed, though, to see such an Americanized menu from a place that appeared at first glance to be perhaps a bit more authentic than most. I think Cleveland is ready for real Mexican food; Chi-Chi's is long gone, Momocho is hip, and the time is right for a blue-collar Mexican joint that transcends the traditional combination-plate Amerimex fare.  Don't get me wrong, El Rodeo does a fine job. I'm just ready for more!"}
{"text":"Terrible.   No taste.  Meat terribly greasy.   No buffet anymore.   Worst Mexican I've ever had."}
{"text":"Staff was terrible. I walked in and they ignored me as they were putting up decorations(Cinco De Mayo) the customers clearly come second. My daughter ordered takeout so as I waited at the counter, a young man comes from the back and starts to sweep but I guess I was in the way because he was ready to sweep me right up into the pile. After I interrupted him to ask if I could pick up my order, he grabbed someone to cash me out. They weren't too friendly either but it's smooth because I won't be returning. Not sure about the food, I'm guessing it was subpar since my daughter didn't mention the taste. Shrugging... O well another one bites the dust! And no I don't have the wrong restaurant to the person who commented on my review. You're still getting 1 star from me for responding the way you did. Such hostility this is why NO ONE SHOULD PATRONIZE THIS ESTABLISHMENT!! I'm giving them 3 thumbs down!"}
{"text":"Consistent quality and the service is always good.  Kid friendly as well."}
{"text":"Just so so. The salsa has chili powder in it, not a big fan. Had the lobster quesadilla.  It was loaded with stuff, but stuff with no flavor. Bland comes to mind. Wife got the spinach enchiladas. Stuffed with stuff, but bland.   Had to stand in alone to pay before leaving like I was in a cafeteria. And don't forget, your second basket of chips and salsa will cost ya."}
{"text":"Just came home after eating El Rodeo's lunch buffet, which was good til 3pm.  My husband who is not a Mexican food fan, loved it.  It was great, good selection, and had really good iced tea.  I ate way too much and left feeling very satisfied.  Well worth the money at 6.99 per person plus your beverage."}
{"text":"Warm chips and delicious salsa. Husband and I both has the Carnitas a la Mexicana and it was spicy and tasty. We will be back. Restaurant is clean and festive!  Feels like a party!"}
{"text":"I didn't know stores sell lestoil anymore, nor did I know now you can drink it. Visited el rodeo on a Saturday. The place was empty. The service is fast. The food is so so."}
{"text":"El Rodeo isn't going to win any innovation awards, but it is a typical suburban Mexican joint. You know the type; bright fiesta ware platters brought out by a dude balancing like 30 on one arm who tells you \"careful. Very hot.\" As far as those places go, it is great; El Rodeo's are always colorful, clean, and predictable. On a Saturday afternoon with some girlfriends or parents before a movie, that is exactly what you want. You have to be really boring not to find something enjoyable about the experience. At least they don't charge for chips like Momocho (which I love).   They serve Dr. Pepper ."}

{"text":"Have gone here twice and really enjoyed it both time. The chimichungas are excellent and the chilaquiles were very good as well. Top notch margaritas."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided on a whim to get dinner here, and we were both extremely happy we did! He ordered the chicken burrote gigante, and I got the chicken fajitas. Both of our meals were AMAZING! The meat was tender, the portions were generous, and the refried beans were some of the best I'd ever had. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Pretty good actually.... Although I thought the salsa was served too cold.  Had it been room temperature it would have been better.  I got the standard bean burrito, cheese enchilada and rice and beans.  I would say this place is better than Cozumel and on par with Si Señor.  Lunch service at the bar was fast."}
{"text":"I used to love this place but something has changed.  The food is now super salty which is usually a sign they are covering up expired ingredients.  This is not exactly an inexpensive place to eat so that just adds to the disappointment when the food is nasty.  All good things must come to an end."}
{"text":"Definately better than El Jalapenos and Nuevo Acapulco for sure.  Also, I discovered the last time I ordered takeout, as I was waiting for the bartender to bring out my food, there was a sign about their delivery service!! Wait staff was more friendly than most restaurants anywhere!"}
{"text":"Yikes!  Let's face it, if you are familiar with the area, you know there is no shortage of Mexican joints within a stone's throw of each other.  We decided this past Sunday to give El Rodeo a shot, despite a sub-par experience a few years back.  The main reason was because \"Kids Eat Free\" on Sundays.  Upon arrival, we first discovered that they are one of the only Mexican restaurants without a Sunday Happy Hour, and their margarita prices are higher than most $6.99 for medium glass), granted, they tasted pretty strong.  We were told when we ordered that even though kids eat free (free $4.69 kids meal with adult meal purchase), the chicken tenders kids meals were still $2.99.  \"it wasn't our servers fault, it was the owners.\"  Two kids ordered root beer and we weren't told by the server that they only had bottled IBC root beer which was also extra.  Chips tasted like mass produced grocery store chips, salsa bowls were only half full and if you wanted a second dish it was extra $ and our meals were average at best.  Don't waste your time on this one, drive about 2 miles north on Pearl to Don Ramon's where you won't be sorry or leave angry."}
{"text":"I'm currently obsessed with their veggie fajitas.  The sangria I ordered wasn't half bad.  The salsa is very good!   The menu has variety. You can get the typical mexican combinations or venture into the specials or vegetarian part of the menu. All are executed well. The fish tacos were okay and my husband thought the beef tacos were good.   Everything in the restaurant is brightly colored. The tables, the walls, the chairs are pink, green, blue. I can only imagine how much money went into decorating the place.  But the prices are still good. Not dirt cheap but nothing fancy.  Kids 10 and under eat free on Sunday."}
{"text":"I actually came here as we were in the area and looking for something to eat.  We had stayed away from Mexican our entire trip to Ohio, since I am always disappointed after living in So Cal, and Denver and experiencing their Mexican food.   I have to admit, they were pretty ok.  The chips and salsa were really good, as well as the rice and re-fried beans... we were flying high and I had a chimichanga with beef tips, while my friend had a chicken and beef taco ( one of each).  We were not completely won over by the way they marinate their meets for these, but they were not bad, just not as great as we were expecting with as good as the other items were.  We had sopapillas for dessert and what came out didn't have a nice scoop of ice cream in the middle like the picture... which was misleading, unless we missed that it was an add on.. in which case, they didn't offer it to us.   Like I said, not the worst, but not the best.  I wouldn't avoid it, but I wouldn't drive several miles to seek it out.  They had a lunch buffet going on, but I personally prefer my food made to order."}
{"text":"Ok.  A step down from Nuevo Acapulco though.  You sure can tell CLEvage doesn't have very many Mexicans."}
{"text":"We returned a car to Enterprise and decided someplace close was a good option after a long trip.  I complimented the Christmas tree to the hostess/waitress.  No response.  She asked how many and dropped two menus at a booth and kept walking.  Ms. Personality.  Other reviewers are correct - It all happens fast.  We got chips (overcooked) & salsa (meh), ordered, and minutes later, hot plates and warm food were set before us.  G got the two quesadilla combo and I got the one quesadilla combo.  I have never seen smaller quesadillas but I guess that 's what you get for $7.99 (my combo).  I asked for no peppers and got that plus no onion and a dot or two of cheese.  The rice and beans were okay but the pico de gallo tasted like watermelon...possibly from the unripened pink tomatoes.  It's like they don't care anymore.  Not going back for sure.  Even though I haven't quite lived here a year, I can report that Cocos Locos near the hospital is hands down fantastic.  Rancho Los Alazanes in Chesterland is also great.  El Palenque on Vine St has an issue here and there but still way above El Rodeo."}
{"text":"Not what I would deem \"authentic\"...  But we still enjoyed the food here.  Was kind of disappointed that you had to pay for an additional bowl of chips and salsa at dinner time.  But for how cheap the meal is, it isn't necessarily them trying to con you."}
{"text":"Good family place.  Everyone liked their meals.  I liked their fish tacos ($9.99 for 3).  Definitely the most colorful decor in Westlake.  Much friendlier, more relaxed and better food than Si Senior."}
{"text":"Terrible place to eat!!! The food was ice cold and there was hair in the food. They didn't wanna fix it either they was arguing with me about it. If I could give it 0 stars I would."}
{"text":"Food was great! We ordered the Chicken Grande Burrito and it was excellent. The service on the otherhand was horrible. We seen the server for a total of 3 time: order drinks, to order food and giving the check. Never came back to see if the food was right, to refill our drinks, see if we needed anything else....NOTHING!"}
{"text":"I haven't been to El Rodeo in years, predominantly due to the fluorescent green margs and mediocre food.  I happened to stop here a few weeks ago for dinner with friends because it had been a VERY long day and no one felt the need for cooking.  Low and behold, the fluorescent colored margs were gone & replaced with the typical yellow colored \"lime\" kind, which were a.ok!  The food quality appeared to have improved too.  We the large fajitas which was more than enough to feed 3-4 people.    El Rodeo boasts a nice patio to enjoy during the warmer months.  The interior is brightly decorated and clean.  Service is ok, not stellar, but ok.  When in need of your American Mexican food fix, El Rodeo won't disappoint."}
{"text":"Below average quick/strip mall mexican food. Bland guac, the rice and beans tasted like leftovers/stale. Weak, super sugary margaritas (and not cheap at that). Would not go back."}
{"text":"Really nice restaurant.  Friendly staff and service.  They take you order quickly and food comes out right away.  The decor is nice.  Similar to the other locations.  Lots of selections and reasonable."}
{"text":"Really nice restaurant.  Friendly staff and service.  They take you order quickly and food comes out right away.  The decor is nice.  Similar to the other locations.  Lots of selections and reasonable."}
{"text":"Very nice little place. If you go at lunch time there is a 7.95 lunch buffet with fajitas on it. The fajitas are better when you order from the kitchen but the buffet is all you can eat."}
{"text":"Decent vegetarian options, including a list of combos to fit any taste. The food is big and cheesy and not too sloppy looking. The staff is incredibly friendly."}
{"text":"Fresh guacamole!! Mmm delicious ! Super clean place ! I really appreciate the clean and neat looks. I was reading other people reviews. People are very dumb ! And unhappy.    The food tasted homemade .   My belly didn't hurt."}
{"text":"Overwhelming cumin in the salsa. The burrito sauce was also very herbal. I ordered a top shelf margeritas and it was bland with a very bitter sour mix. Not a fan at all. Although the staff was very friendly and the restaurant was cute. They also have a patio that would be nice for summer"}
{"text":"Fabulous. Great atmosphere, great service (great attire), great music, great food. The salsa is really good as are the chips. And they were hot. Very good rice. Very good refried beams. The carnitas were excellent. No \"piggy\" taste either as is sometimes the case with carnitas. No odd or stale flavor in anything. A huge amount of food too. All this at a half hour before closing on a Saturday night! I won't bother trying anywhere else while I'm here in Cleveland (n. Olmstead).   Omg! The flan is amazing (writing this as I eat). I can tell it's homemade from scratch  in the kitchen. Sometimes I think mex restaurants have their flan brought in. There was a hint I clove in the sauce. Wow what a nice little touch that was. Normally at Mexico places I order it without the extra toppings...only the caramel sauce. But I forgot this time. The whipped cream andd fizzled chocolate sauce was not distracting however. Next time I'll order it plain so I can really taste the custard flavor.   If only they had wifi...my att signal here is next to nothing. Guess I'll post this down the road. Lol"}
{"text":"We love everything about this place. Coming here and being welcomed and enjoying our visit and good food and drink make this a weekly event for us. Once you come here, you are family."}
{"text":"Vibrant decor, great food, good service!  I was craving Mexican food + stopped at El Rodeo. I really loved the decor: tables + chairs with very colorful details. The colors and decorations all around were vibrant and fun.   We were started off with salsa + tortillas. The salsa was excellent. It tasted like it was freshly made.    The food was great: we had the seafood fajitas (shrimp + tilapia) and the taco/enchilada combo. The fajitas were not sizzling, which was a tiny but disappointing, but the food, especially the shrimp, was delicious. Same with the ground beef taco + enchilada. Both dishes came with rice + retried beans.    Service was good. I was tempted deduct a  1/2 star because the service got a little slow after our meals came. There was only one waiter taking care of all the tables. He did apologize, saying the other staffers were running late. Sure enough, 2 waiters showed up towards the end of our meal, so I can't blame our waiter for that.   The prices on the menu were reasonable. I'd say it was a good value. You get a lot of food for the price. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Yummy and Quick!  THE UP-SIDE: Tasty Mexican food in a colorful setting.  I go here during the week for lunch and the food arrives quick and piping hot.    THE DOWN-SIDE: Eh, you know.  It's got that same vibe most Mexican restaurants have; slightly cheesy decor with slightly crummy \"authentic\" music.  Not so bad that it's annoying though.  THE SUM-IT-UP:  I like this place.  I really do.  The food is good and the service is speedy.  Check it out!"}
{"text":"It was alright. Marg wasn't that great but the service was. Decent food."}
{"text":"The place is dripping in brightly painted Mexican decor and seems like it should be a really fun place. The food was fine. Pretty average american/mexican food, but I was happy with it and probably exceeded my expectations, which since moving here from California are very low. It was definitely priced fairly though. The salsa was great, exactly what it should be in a mexican restaurant.   My biggest complaint was how we were hurried out of there. It was just weird service. Our drink order took awhile, the food was delivered quickly, and as I was still eating a rather full plate, my boyfriend's plate was taken and I was asked if I wanted a box. No offer of a second drink, even though mine was empty. It was just weird.  I might go again, but it wouldn't be first on my list."}
{"text":"I would have to agree with the reviewer before me anout Alcapulco Nuevo, however I find the dishes here tasty but not as authentic.  I will have to say though the menu is more kid friendly.  Over all decent price for decent food.  I am from Southern California and if we were there right now I might give 2 stars but we are in the midwest and I have to lower my mexican food standards a bit."}
{"text":"Very colorful dining room. Wait staff was very friendly and attentive to their customers. Very nice decorative tables and chairs and the atmosphere was very authentic.  Food prices were very well priced coming from California and Texas prices for authentic Mexican food. Margaritas were awesome. Kind of wish we knew about the lunch buffet as we were looking for Mexican food for lunch and ended up eating at home. Would definitely recommend the burro California and the tamales. The chiliquillas weren't as authentic as from mexico or California disappointed in that aspect as my wife grew up in a Mexican household with a mom from Guadalajara.  The sopapillas were OK...disappointed there as well. For the most part though walked out satisfied and full."}
{"text":"Took two hours to deliver. Got half the order wrong. Not worth it. Don't order from the Eat24 app."}
{"text":"For dinner or lunch, El Rodeo and other Mexican joints like this one are usually not my thing. I like fresh ingredients and typically - or every time I've been to any El Rodeo - they just don't seem to serve fresh anything.   Last night, was a different story.  My sister and I were out shopping. We were both in fitting rooms complaining about how everything we tried on looked terrible and then whined about how huge our guts are. Then we talked about food and how awesome it is. And then my sister decided she wanted fried ice cream. So, of course, to drown our chubby sorrows we went to El Rodeo.  The place was dead. We were seated immediately and served the freshest chips and salsa I've ever had at any El Rodeo. They were seriously just fried and the slightest bit of grease was still left on them. SO GOOD!  We ordered the \"supreme\" fried ice cream. It comes in a fried tortilla covered in cinnamon sugar. This was also VERY fresh - it was just made. I have never experienced two fresh items in a row at El Rodeo so I was more than pleasantly surprised.  We guessed that since it was almost 9:00 pm they were making things fresh for the next day. So maybe timing is everything?   Thank you, El Rodeo, for making my gut even flabbier. Just what I needed."}
{"text":"Great place for takeout. Food was delicious, and came out quickly. Have eaten-in before, and had a marvelous time. Staff is friendly, and very accommodating."}
{"text":"My rating would be maybe 2-1/2 but definitely not 3 stars. Was in the mood for Mexican food. And I wanted real Mexican food not whatever that stuff is that they serve at Taco Bell. I lived in mentor during my high school years but have lived out towards Cleveland for many years and recently came back to mentor. There are soooo many restaurants here now! Does anyone in mentor cook? Where I was living though there were practically no restaurants and the few that there were more than half of them are just plain BAD!  Anyway I checked reviews here and some were very good. Some were pretty bad. But the prices looked somewhat reasonable it's very close to where I'm living so I took a chance. I ordered ala carte 1 tostada 1 BEEF chillie relanos 1 beef enchilada 1 cheese enchilada and one ground beef burrito  some guacamole and pico digalo  when I got there my food was not ready which was ok I think I was a few mins early and was fine by me cuz now when I got my food right out of the kitchen it should be nice and hot. Cold Mexican food is just ewwww! The lady at the register was quite friendly she spoke with a thick Spanish accent so I thought GOOD! The people here should know how to make real authentic food. About 5 mins later I received paid and went straight home with my order. I don't even live five mins away. I got home got my utensils beverages plates etc opened up and started to dive in first thing was the BEEF chillie relanos...... Cold. I don't know what kind of cheese they used but it was nasty. Is there such a thing as Mexican American cheese? That's what it tasted like. Wheres the BEEF??? None to speak of that I could find.. soggy and just plain bad tasting. Into the garbage it went. Next was the beef \"enchilada\" MEH.... it was ok I guess kind of bland and sauce there was just something not right about it. Can't realy put my finger on it. I'm not the greatest cook but I'm not the worst either but I believe I could make a better sauce. Next cheese enchilada liked it was not bad but to be brutally honest there's a frozen cheese enchilada dinner at giant eagle that's much better. Next up the Burrito.... (I THINK...) if this was indeed a burrito it was exactly the same as the beef enchilada same size same resemblance same flavor same sauce same strange ground beef the ground beef wasn't terrible but there was something off about that as well some said in there reviews the meat tastes like chineese food I might agree with that but frankly the Chinese food I have had in the past was better than this. There was no lettuce tomato onion sour cream or anything maybe they messed up the order I'm not sure I hope that's what it was cuz that was the worst burrito I ever had. Also Burrito and enchiladas..... COLD as well. Tostada Cold and corn tortia STALE sour cream ...\"Ewwww!\" Same weird ground beef... Into the garbage it went. They gave me chips and salsa I guess they came with the order ..... MEH.  OK I guess could have been better kinda greasy rather bland and salsa was not very good into the garbage they went. Pico digallo was good a lot of cilantro though but that's just me I like cilantro but could do without it. Guacamole was very good only problem with that was there was the great big hard stem top piece mixed in mine could have done without that nasty thing in there! NO JOKE the next day I had a BAAADDDD! Case of diarrhea! I wish I went to Taco Bell."}
{"text":"Lunch buffet 11-3 $7.25  I am a huge fan of this lunch buffet, the service and the price. I have yet to have a bad experience and really don't expect one anytime. The buffet has the usual rice and beans as well as taquitos, cheese quesadillas, beef and chicken fajitas, cheese and chicken enchiladas, potatoes, eggs, some sort of casserole (not sure whats in it), shredded chicken in a red sauce and last but not least cheese dip and 2 red sauces for the extra sauce lovers.  They also have a salad bar with salad, veggies, cilantro and onions, pico, hot salsa, tomatillo salsa, 2 desserts (they switch them up often), pickles, peppers and a few extra misc toppings. If you love Mexican food, you really can't go wrong.  The food is always super hot and fresh, nothing has every looked funny or tasted bad ever! The service is friendly and fast.  I hate dirty plates on my table and at El Rodeo I don't have to worry about that, they are right there to grab them.  I can't wait for the patio to open once it warms up a bit.  This place rocks and if you haven't tried the lunch buffet, go for it! Also, I heard on weekends they have a similar buffet, but add a few other items price $10.99, I'll be checking that out soon!"}
{"text":"Food is terrible, Ordered Lunch special No.14, chicken quesadilla, with quacamole, rice, lettuce and tomato.  I ended up with a chicken soft taco, like Taco Bells, no quacamole, a sliver of tomato. NO flavor whatso ever.  Will not go back."}
{"text":"The place is pleasant, brightly colored even festive.  Meets the traditional Mexican decor expectations.  The staff were friendly and service about average.  Though I was disappointed they had run out of Dos Equis on tap.    The salsa had a garlic flavor and a low burn; certainly not the worst I have had, but not very exciting either.  The chips were a little on the greasy side.  My son eats anything, but did not finish his taquitos.  He said they tasted bland and the meat was dry.  I was excited to see a Molcajete on the menu, but when it arrived the visual appearance is not at al what I have had in Mexico.  The meat was,fine and it came with fresh cilantro, but not at all authentic.  I would not dissuade people from coming as I said the staff are friendly and the food is reasonably priced and more or less average."}
{"text":"Food is simply amazing. We always have the best service. The margaritas  are always made fresh. I ordered  the shrimp tacos. They are absolutely bursting with flavor. My husband ordered the Mexican Lasagna  (Red Sauce) and was pleased with his choice as always. Great place...a must try! We've  tried 6 different Mexican  resturants since moving to CLE....this is our go to place."}
{"text":"Atmosphere was great, but I felt like the food was lacking in flavor.  Service was good, and the inside of the place was cute too.  I will have to go back and see if it was an off night.  Kids eat free on Sunday night, which is good."}
{"text":"We used to frequent the location on Mayfield Road in Lyndhurst -  which has since closed - so we sorta knew what to expect on our first visit to this place. Not that this is a bad thing, though. Sometimes it's nice to know what you're walking into.  El Rodeo (Spanish for the Rodeo) is basically your typical Americanized Mexican joint. Here are some of the highlights you can expect during a visit:  -Piped in vaguely Mexican-sounding music. At one point I thought I heard some tubas. Do they use tubas in Mexican music?  -Hand-carved furniture painted in Technicolor. The booths feature a glass top that allows the ornate features below to show through. I still see that bright yellow maniacally smiley sun when I close my eyes.  -Faux painting on the walls. We're talking the finest in airbrushed faux bricks and stones this side of the city.  -$4 margaritas on Tuesdays. We didn't visit on Tuesday and I didn't order one so that's all I can share.  -There was some sort of taco bar with all kinds of fixins. I'm not sure if it's offered every day but it looked pretty good.  -Tame versions of classic Mexican dishes. One of the things I love about Mexican food is the heat. The enchiladas I ordered, while tasty, were completely devoid of heat.   El Rodeo is not a  bad place to go grab some cheap MexAmerican grub. It's somewhere between Taco Bell and Mi Pueblo Taqueria. Just about all of the dishes are some combination of lettuce, sour cream, cheese, beans, rice chicken/ground beef and either corn or flour tortillas. It won't blow your socks off with authentic flavor but it won't blow your budget either (we had lunch for two with a beer for $28). Accept it for what it is and you can't go wrong.  P.S. You get some free chips and salsa to munch on while waiting for your food."}
{"text":"Like a page ripped right out of the standard Ameri-Mex restaurant playbook, El Rodeo has all of the usuals:  -Bustling, slightly overdressed servers flitting from table to table, filling waters, dropping off baskets of chips and their accompanying salsa.  -Paper flags and a giant, inflatable Corona bottle suspended from the ceiling to add to the festive atmosphere.  -Glass-topped, carved wood tables painted in maniacally bright day-glo colors depicting suns, moons and toucans  -Life-size cardboard stand-up of The Most Interesting Man in the World ready to greet you upon entering. As it was the holiday season, it was nice to see him wearing a Santa's cap on the eve of our visit.  -A menu way longer than any menu should be that's filled with foods created with essentially 5 ingredients - meat, cheese, beans, rice and tortillas  -Ethnic music peppered with ah-ha's and rolled R's turned up just slightly louder than it should be to serve as a constant sonic reminder that you're about to eat Mexican food  -Lights hung above the booths that dangle right in front of your face with the brightness of a miniature red giant star.  There are several El Rodeo's across the Northeast Ohio region and every one that I've been to is essentially the same. It's like they've managed to formulate and execute the McDonald's of Mexican restaurants. Same food, same decor, same atmosphere, same service. Uncanny, really.  The food is exactly what you'd expect, too. It's the sort of watered-down, Americanized Mexican-themed cuisine that most of us have come to expect. It's tasty (the chicken and beef in my meal was on the dry side), served in pretty large fatty American-sized portions and makes its way to your table in relatively short order. I hate this phrase, but sometimes even I can't find a better one to replace it:  \"It is what it is\"  Mexican-themed restaurants in this country are sorta like Chinese restaurants. In most cases, you know exactly what you're in for before you even set your ass in a booth.   Just a heads up, here your first basket of chips is complimentary, but subsequent baskets will cost you $0.99.  They didn't tell us but it's spelled out in the menu. Tricky, tricky.   You have no idea how thankful I was not to see or hear a mariachi band anywhere in the restaurant. I have a hard time believing that even the Mexicans like mariachi music."}
{"text":"By far one of the best Mexican restaurants in the area. The food , salsa and service ROCKS! When I'm in the area definitely a favorite with my family. Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"Food is pretty standard, drink specials are nice but the service is terrible! We waited for quite some time for our food and when we asked for our check and a box, we got the box but not the check. I had to ask multiple times for the check. This place really needs to rethink their staffing decisions"}
{"text":"I doubt I'll be back. Do yourself a favor. Just go to Taco Bell or Chipotle on Bagley. I had a hair on my lime in my beer.  The salsa was ok and the sour cream in my Taco made me fart. Pico, our server was clueless. Pass.   Edit - taking off one start. Sharted multiple times the following day.  Edit - After watching Kitchen Nightmares, I feel the issues I'm seeing with these restaurants are probably happening here. I wouldn't be surprised if they're just using a microwave."}
{"text":"I have seen poor reviews for this restaurant on plenty of sites but have to disagree with them. I have been to El Rodeo twice now and have been very pleased every time. It is certainly the closest thing you will get to authentic Mexican food in the area. While the food is still very Americanized, it at least makes the attempt to appear and taste Mexican by easing up on the cheese sauces and odd taste combinations you find at other places in Cleveland.  I hail from southern Arizona, so Mexican food in the Cleveland area has generally been disappointing but El Rodeo is a place that I actually enjoy to go. The portions are very large and cooked well. As was noted in the other review, on the nights that the Mariachis are playing, it can get very loud but if you go on those nights, you are kind of asking for it. I actually quite enjoyed the music and my children were very entertained by it.  The atmosphere is bright and typical of what you'd see at any mexican place but I personally think it is cleaner and better taken care of than most.   If you feel the craving for Mexican food in Cleveland, this is one of the few places that I would recommend (including the upscale ones)."}
{"text":"Better than Taco Bell, but NOT authentic Mexican. Those that think this joint is authentic probably also think sizzler is a great steak joint.  Decent decor, very average food."}
{"text":"This place is fabulous.  The restaurant dining room is great, with all the paintings and decorations!  I had a vegetarian dish, and tasted great."}
{"text":"First, very disappointed in the fact that they charge you for a chip refill!! What kind of Mexican restaurant charges for a chip refill, that is insane to me! Second, I ordered the steak fajitas. The steak was very chewy and the very bland along with the veggies, I ended up barely eating any of it and didn't take a to-go box. Third, the margaritas are very delicious but very expensively, even for a pitcher. All in all, everything on the menu is much to expensive, the food is bland and I want free amounts of endless chips and salsa! Next time I want Mexican, I'll make the trip to Cozumel in Brunswick!"}
{"text":"Still a solid three stars--but really not bad when you stick to the safe items.  We had an hour to kill before Mini Murph's baseball practice and it was dinner time. We knew this would be quick, tasty and family friendly.   Picante fajitas are my top choice. Grab the lunch sized portion (add a $1 after 2:30PM) for only 7.99 and it's more than enough with two tortillas and sides. Plus the never ending chips and salsa, which has been better since my initial visit."}
{"text":"Great food. Good service. The place is very clean all of the time. Haven't been disappointed by anything on the menu and I think we have tried just about everything."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch. Friendly atmosphere, value and really tasty food.  Lunch fajitas with chicken were more flavorable than most but never felt greasy or heavy. Tasty chips/salsa and classic margaritas! Happy customer here."}
{"text":"OK People....lol  Im not here to bash anyone or even trample on your free speech, but come on now  I have eaten at this place many times and every time I heat there I say to myself \"Why\"? lol  Food:  everything covered in this plastic white cheese glob....tasteless  I ordered Toquitos....they were from GFS.  these things were so bad I could taste the freezer burn.  Salsa:  Pretty good.  Best part of the place.  Atmosphere:  To much going on....gave me a headache   Overall:  D+"}
{"text":"El Rodeo is your typical midwest Mexican restaurant.  Nothing innovative, just cheap, hearty food.   It's not bad, but it's facing some tough competition from the much superior Nuevo Alcapulco which is just 3 minutes up the road.   If Nuevo is too busy, stop here."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good but my drink was terrible.  I ordered a classic Mojito.  It should be muddled mint with lime, a little sugar, rum and soda.  That's it.  Pretty easy.  What I got was sour mix on the rocks...for $7!  I didn't taste any mint and no liquor.    I would go back for the food but stick to beer or water next time!"}
{"text":"$2 Coronas on Friday!  Service has been great the two times I've been here.  Very attentive and friendly.  As for the food... that's another story.  I ordered the Special Dinner which contains:  Beef Enchilada - Bland, all beef. The wrap had a funny texture to it. Chicken Tamal - Dry, bland. Bean Chalupa - Decent due to all the toppings on it, but still bland. Cheese Chile Relleno - Surprisingly DELICIOUS. Hard Beef Taco - Bland! Rice - Bland! Fried Beans - Can't really do this wrong.  So yeah, I think you can see a recurring theme here.  I'll probably go again for the $2 coronas and try something completely different than the \"special\" dinner, but yeah.  Everything tasted very \"meh\"."}
{"text":"Exceptional real Mexican food! Authentic decor, well dressed staff, and very friendly! I passed this restaurant so many times, I'm so happy I stopped in tonight. The salsa was just spicy enough,with warm crispy chips!"}
{"text":"Food was nice. Salsa wasn't spicy at all. Chips tasted fresh. Sangria wasn't that great."}
{"text":"El Rodeo is so authentic and fresh. The servers are friendly and know the menu very well. The drinks were made in a timely manner and mixed well. They have unlimited choices and toppings. I would recommend getting a to-go container and try the dessert!"}
{"text":"I NEVER write reviews but I have to with El Rodeo. This place is down right FOUL. The bathroom (for women) I cannot even write about (I might throw up in my mouth) was the most disgusting bathroom I've ever been in. The whole experience of this restaurant was not good. The servers were nice, but not attentive at all. Food was horrible, drinks were the only good thing. Margaritas were really good."}
{"text":"Went to El Rodeo.  Food was ok.  Good chips. First batch of salsa amazing, 2nd batch tasted like raw donkey ***.  It was a strange change.  Food did not seem fresh but rather pre packaged made cheap.  Lovely décor.  Service was a bit slow and the restaurant was maybe 30% filled.  Kind of disappointed.  I had gone here when they first opened and it was awesome.  It's a bit out of the way for me to come back here, so I don't think its going to happen.  If I lived closer maybe I would"}
{"text":"Server barely said 10 words the whole time we were there. The food was absolutely shameful! Stale stale stale. When they set the chips and salsa down you could actually smell the stale chips. Should have left then. The blended drinks we ordered didn't have any alcohol in them. When we inquired as to why we were served virgin drinks they said we were mistaken. Yeah, ok. All the meat dishes were dry. Very dry. And over cooked. Won't be returning"}
{"text":"Once again we let coupons be our guide and failed to check Yelp first. We were literally the ONLY table at 4:30 on a Tuesday afternoon. They got the party started with some complimentary stale chips and some flavorless salsa.  I decided to order the chimichangas since I recently had some great ones at another restaurant. I asked for one ground beef and one beef tip. When they arrived they were both ground beef and they were not very crispy or flaky at all. Like they weren't fried long enough. A total bummer amigo.  And despite being the only table the waitress had the drink refills were far and few between.  It's like they don't even care. Adios El Rodeo!"}
{"text":"Service is always good, I like the food, not too spicy. Portions are plenty big, prices moderate. I believe in the winter they should turn up the heat a little. I always order pollo feliz with extra dour cream."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner the other night, food was delicious!! Ordered a couple fajitas plates, one was a Hawaiian and got served in a pineapple!! Also the margaritas were delicious and made perfectly!"}
{"text":"We love this place.   Everything we have ever had has been delicious and the margaritas are yummy  Salsa is really good and chips are warm and crispy.   Today I had seafood chimichangas and my husband had seafood nachos. Both of us had raspberry margaritas!!   Yummo   I will post pictures of this!!"}
{"text":"First visit here in many years and I'm glad I stopped in! I LOVED the salsa, hot and spicy! I was very pleased that there was a bigger vegetarian selection than most. The food was tasty and filling, worth the price!  Only negative? A lady took our order,but from then on it was a gentleman who, was very good and nice but was wearing WAY too much cologne!! It was overwhelming and took away from the experience.  But other than that it was a great experience and we will return!"}
{"text":"Great food and friendly atmosphere! Average pricing for Mexican food. Lots of options."}
{"text":"I live close and have been half a dozen times. The food is good, but I'd compare it to any neighborhood Mexican place. The staff is always friendly and I've never seen it very busy so the wait staff stay on top of things. Good soft tacos (basic beef, cheese, lettuce), rice and beans are good but nothing special. I do notice you get shredded cheese not unlike what you'd get at giant eagle, I would prefer freshly shredded authentic white queso or what's the point? I can make tacos with \"Mexican blend shredded cheese\" and ice burg lettuce at home. One thing I will say is that the salsa is very good and homemade, spicy enough and roasted tomato flavor! I will continue to go for fast, cheap mexican but it's not one of the best meals I've had."}
{"text":"This is our go to work spot. There is plenty of ample seating and they can usually handle our large group.   The service is usually pretty quick. Yesterday it was a bit slower and we waited for a while before someone came by to take our order. As soon as the order was in though, they are quick to get it out like most Mexican restaurants.   Their lunch fajitas are the way to go and are what I had. It gets you about three soft tacos worth and comes with re-fried beans, rice, and some various toppings like lettuce, sour cream, and a little guac. You can ask for corn tortillas which are generally gluten free. If you're more sensitive to it than I am you might want to verify, but I do remember asking and they said they were.   Their margaritas are good, but make sure to specify your size or you might find yourself in trouble. The pours vary every time we are there, sometimes strong, sometimes weak.   They also have wifi and we occasionally have worked from there, but if you have to do anything too intense you might want to bring a hot spot with you.   Overall it's nothing spectacular, but nothing terrible. It's just good Mexican food for a decent price in the middle of Parma.  P.s. You pay at the register, not at the table... I don't know why, we know this, but still always find ourselves sitting there waiting until someone at the table reminds us. #margaritabrain"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I love this place. Always great service and everything is quick and hot. They have a really nice terrace, plenty of parking, full bar and it's right on Pearl rd. I highly recommend the Carnitas. Also, the guacamole is outstanding!"}
{"text":"I have to say I was truly disappointed with the food here. It was very bland and I will not be making any more visits. The service was really good and that's why I'm giving them two stars."}
{"text":"The food was very ordinary, nothing very special, for a Mexican restaurant. My meal which was the chorizo burrito was bland along with the tortilla chips that they offer. I suppose this restaurant is ideal for someone that is concerned with their salt intake. I also felt that our server was a little bit pushy on offering us desert and he rushed us to make a decision for our main entree which left a bad taste for the experience."}
{"text":"I Have been here a few times in the past and it was good, I don't know what happened today.   We went for lunch and ate outside, our waitress was very unfriendly.   The food was bad. I got Texas fajitas and the green pepper and onions were raw.   My sons food came out 5 minutes after everyone else's and no apology.   Won't be ever going back."}
{"text":"Our favorite place! The staff treats you like family and are always friendly. They have reasonable prices and the food is terrific"}
{"text":"I love a good Mexican food restaurant, and this one is one of my favorites. My lady brought me to this place and the look of the entire restaurant was beautiful - the tables, the chairs, the aura was gorgeous. The server was nice and the food was delicious. No complaints. I will be back"}
{"text":"This is my favorite mexican restaurant in the country! Best salsa ever and I've been coming here for years!"}
{"text":"A good Mexican restaurant.  I like the pollo fundido (chicken with sautéed onions and spinach, covered in cheese, on a sizzling cast-iron pan); Mary is a complete fan of the coctel de camarones, a shrimp cocktail that features plenty of shrimp to make a full meal of.  I will say it's a bit Americanized cuisine compared to what you'd get in Mexico City-- but in Mexico City you're likely to not know what kind of animal your meat came from and the \"mild\" will singe your taste buds; I'm good with Americanized. Decor is spacious, featuring chairs and tables hand-carved and brightly painted in Mexican/Central American motifs. If the weather's nice, you can eat outside, although the patio does have some road noise, since it's not very far from Pearl Road.  A full bar as well, if you're just looking for a place to pop in for a margarita and cerveza with your compañeros.  Price is reasonable (could be under $10 if you're not ordering drinks, over if you want a margarita with it), service is fast and friendly."}
{"text":"Expensive, terrible bean burritos and cheese dip! Didn't expect italian when we ordered two bean burritos' that were served filled with a small amount of watery beans, and swimming in what smelled and looked like marinara or speggitti sauce! There was actual italian seasoning on our bean burritos.  We were really hungry, so we ordered the cheese dip to go along with basket of chips (which were stale btw)...The cheese dip was the texture and appearance of a high fructose corn syrup laced salad dressing, which tasted absolutely fake!  I really wished we would have drove through taco bell instead of wasting $36 on this italian/mexican food stuff. Ewwww!"}
{"text":"Authentic ...quick ... Friendly.  Lunch Buffet is a great deal, restocked regularly, service is prompt w many checkbacks, not stingy w chip refills.  Multiple servers smiling and saying hi even if not your server."}
{"text":"If I could hover between A-OK and being a fan, I'd be there but sometimes this place is so money that I'm going to give it the benefit of the doubt. Maybe a few times the cooks had an off night, but one thing that keeps me coming back to this restaurante is the tall draft beers. Domestic, Import, or Craft it comes in a mug directly plucked from the deepest part of Antarctica topped with shaved ice. I know what you're thinkin', ice and beer?! Gross. Ice in beer usually doesn't mix well but the long thin shaved pieces are entirely unnoticeable and don't water down your beer.  Enough about the brews and lets move to the grub. If you're feeling froggy, try anything from their specials menu (I recommend the Fajita Volcanito) they're actually pretty tasty if you hit the chefs on a good night, however if you find yourself strolling in when the sky is falling the food comes out just about average. If you want to go with something safe, try any of their fajita dishes they are consistently good and rarely fall fail to please.  The service can be shotty but the atmosphere and beer make-up for it. If you like an empty restaurant where conversation call flourish try El Rodeo."}
{"text":"hands down some of the worst Mexican food I have ever tasted .. came to the table cold & tasteless .. those in the kitchen must have never been introduced to something as salt to season the food .. left disappointed & still hungry .. Taco Bell serves food w/more finesse & flavor .."}
{"text":"El Rodeo is the epitome of an average Mexican restaurant. The fajitas are a solid option but they are nothing to write home about. The sides are decent and the chips and salsa are average at best.   The restaurant is very clean and the service has always been great whether you are eating in or taking out. If you are craving some Mexican, I wouldn't tell you not to go here but there are many other options that are worth a shot."}
{"text":"El Rodeo recently added this location just across from Crocker Park.  Like the original, the decor is vibrant with color and has plenty of seating.  I find the service to be a lot better/faster than the North Olmsted location, too.  The wait staff is more than willing to help and you'll always find drinks, complimentary chips/salsa, etc. refilled in no time.  And that's the main upside to this place.  It's fast and the food is good.  If it's during the lunch hours and you're in a hurry, you can probably order, eat, and leave all within 20 minutes or so.  It tends to be less busy than the North Olmsted location, so you most likely won't have to wait at all for dinner, although I would call ahead to make sure.  The menu selection is vast and there's plenty of stuff for vegetarians, too.  They have a full bar complete with Mexican and American beers, margaritas, etc.  There's also a large flat screen that's usually playing a local sporting event.    I'd say Nuevo Acapulco and Luchita's both have more 'authentic' tasting food, but honestly, there's nothing here to complain about.  The staff, atmosphere, and service are all better and the food is good.  If you're looking for a quick, tasty, reasonably priced meal, this is the place.  Parking is located in the front and back, and there's plenty of it!  One side note: they have a full selection of Jarritos Mexican soda (fruit punch, mandarin, pineapple, etc.)!!"}
{"text":"I waited for quite some time, many hostesses and wait staff passed by me but no one said a word to me which irritated the hell out of me. I was meeting 3 other people for dinner or else I would have walked out of this dump.  The service was terrible. I could understand if there were a rush of people but there were not. Second, the food is not even that good. It's pointless having a lot food that doesn't taste that great. Don't waste your time and money here. Go to Rincon Criollo instead, the food is outstanding."}
{"text":"I love this place! My daughter and I go here every two weeks and we are never disappointed! The service is ALWAYS fast and the food is very fresh! We have tried other Mexican places and they just don't compare!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch. Had the lunch buffet. Food was eh, not the worst Mexican food I've had. I'm not sure if I have high exceptions coming from the greater NYC area or what but this place was depressing. Won't be returning."}
{"text":"I love this laid back restaurant!  We've been going there for years, and I have never had a bad meal.  In fact, the food here is excellent and so very tasty!  The shrimp enchiladas were 'off the charts' yummy!  I have to laugh when I read some of these reviews that state that this is not 'authentic' Mexican food.  Who cares?!  What matters is whether in fact the food TASTES good, and is prepared well.  It does, and it is.  'El Rodeo' rocks!"}
{"text":"Best mexican food ever!! Amazing margaritas and even better food. The burritos especially are fantastic. The service is always great, Amada is my favorite. Definitely recommend this place to anyone who loves good mexican food!!"}
{"text":"They were great with food allergies and are gluten free. I was able to order off the menu and they even cleaned the grill to make sure there weren't any dairy products on it. Our server was very nice!"}
{"text":"The worst I've ever had.  I ordered  shrimp fajitas... They all had the black crap in them.  No big deal, I mean, I like cleaning my own shrimp. Not!   The onions and peppers were cooked a long time ago. No sizzling pan.   Just bad!  Overlooked.  Yuck."}
{"text":"This place was recommended by some close friend. The decor is really nice and quite with all the wood carving.   The chips and salsa is really fresh and delicious. We ordered the queso fondido with chorizo to eat with the chip. I ordered a fajita supreme with all the meats. It was pretty good.  We wanted to order a half pitcher of margarita and waitress came out with a full pitcher. We had a good time drinking the full pitcher.  The place was fairly busy that Friday night. Service was a little slow but at the end, food is good.   I didn't even know they have a tableside gucamole until I seen it on Yelp picture.  Definitely we will go back for the gucamole."}
{"text":"I'm not happy with this place. The only reason they rec'd 2 stars is because the food was edible. Their prices are high and portions are tiny. We waited 20 minutes for Togo boxes that never came. They served my daughter chocolate milk in a styrofoam cup with a hole in it, took them forever to get us napkins so we could clean it up. When I asked for a wet rag to clean the table so it would be sticky I was flat out ignored. I asked our server to move us to a different table so my daughter didn't have to sit  where the table was sticky again ignored. So not only did I have to pay $60 for food for 4 people, but I didn't even get to take the left overs home. I will never be going back to this restaurant. Tacobell has a better understand of customer service."}
{"text":"Always great food! Excellent vegetarian options. Friendly staff and good for a family nite out."}
{"text":"El Rodeo is my go to, local Mexican restaurant. It's always a friendly, fast and delicious meal!  The staff at El Rodeo is always quick to greet and seat you. The decor in the restaurant is bright, colorful and cheerful. I love their salsa and cheese dip. I've had several different dishes at El Rodeo. I really enjoy their fajitas but lately I've been ordering the chicken quesadilla. The prices are great and the food always comes out piping hot. Consider getting dessert. They're fried ice cream is delicious and the portion is big enough to share. I'd definitely recommend stopping by El Rodeo if you're in the mood for a great Mexican meal."}
{"text":"The only thing that everyone seemed to like was the margaritas. The food was really bland, and most of it was cold. I truly love Mexican food and this was by far the worst I've had in this area.   I came with a large group of friends from work and this was something we had looked forward to for sometime. There was someone sort of issue with the gift card our work hard rewarded us with and the staff tried to figure it out. I felt that the staff tried to fix the situation but came off very rude.   Also, the worst part was almost everyone got sick from the food. We all talked about the experience and the only thing we all had in common that day was eating here. Maybe this place is better for small groups."}
{"text":"We live walking distance from here and it's my new favorite Mexican place. The decor is fun, the staff is very friendly, and the food is plentiful and delicious. They have drink specials basically every weekday, but Tuesdays are my favorite because you can get a huge margarita at half price. The menu is large, like most Mexican restaurants. I really enjoy the enchiladas rancheros."}
{"text":"Awesome food, service, and atmosphere. The portion sizes were large (I had the quesadilla fajitas) and it was muy exellento! We will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Since moving to CLE, El Rodeo has become our Mexican staple. Whenever we have a craving we head here, and it's always a great choice.         A key staple of a great Mexican joint is the margaritas - and that holds true here. I always get their lime margaritas on the rocks and they're always amazing. The margaritas at El Rodeo are refreshing and delicious (and strong!), definitely a must here.     The food is consistently great as well - good portions, a lot of choices on the menu, and very flavorful. My favorite is the chimichangas, though every dish I've tried has been awesome.      The service is another great part of the restaurant.  We've always been greeted warmly, served quickly, and have had excellent service throughout the meal.      All in all, El Rodeo has everything you could want in a great Mexican joint: great food, good service, and refreshing and strong drinks."}
{"text":"Have been going here regularly for years but have found it is going down hill. Last couple times food had been barely warm and several people with me had food that was cold and have been sent back to be heated. I am a wine drinker and order wine that is not sweet...but it is sweet and crystallized sugar at the bottom of the glass from the bottom of the bottle...old wine. Food is tasty but service is sometimes non existent. Feel bad as this place was a regular stop for me but finally have to take if of of me go to places list."}
{"text":"The food is good (typical), prices are affordable, service is fast and very friendly. There are lots of Mexican places to choose from and I honestly, can rarely tell the difference.... but we always seem to gravitate towards this restaurant!   It is nicely decorated, spacious and always clean. They are attentive to refills and additional requests. I had a #2 combo with tacos and and a beef chimichanga--- yum!"}
{"text":"Looking for a quick mexican fix?  Good food, lots of seating and if you want to get in and out quickly this is the place.  Not the best mexican around but not the worst either."}
{"text":"It's fine, not the best mex food. We got chimichangas, they were ok, shredded beef was a bit dry. Portions are fairly big, dinners come with beans and rice. Guac was ok, but not amazing. Everything needed to be spiced up a bit."}
{"text":"Our food was delicious! I had the steak fajita salad. Seasoned well. Perfect portion. My husband had the fajita texana. This is the first time at a restaurant the meat outweighed the veggies! Score for the carnivore! Food was great, staff was friendly. Love the decor. Lime green is my favorite color!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I ate dinner here last week, we purchased two entree's and a pitcher of margarita's that was on \"special\" for $13.99, pushed by the server. There was minimal alcohol in the margarita, only sour mix.  As it turned out, when we went to pay, they would not accept our entertainment coupon, because we ordered the margaritas. No where on the coupon did it say anything about a beverage purchase. We will not be going back to this establishment as they were not even the slightest bit concerned and said \"that was just the way it is\", pointing to a hand written sign that read \" No Coupon\". One would think that \"no coupon\" was necessary to get the special price, not that I couldn't get a discount on the food, if I were to use a coupon.    The food was sub par, the margarita was bland, topped by very poor customer service. Go somewhere else!"}
{"text":"Came in on a Saturday evening. Was pretty busy, but we were seated right away in a small corner table, kind of in an alcove. I mention this only because maybe the service was so bad because they couldn't easily see us and forgot about us? I don't know, but service was really slow and the waiter on multiple occasions walked away before I could order anything.  I did give 2 stars though. This is because I loved the \"made at your table\" guac and their salsa was very tasty. The guac was so fresh and seasoned perfectly. I could have eaten it with a spoon. However, although I ordered the \"made at your table\" guac which is double the price of the regular, the waiter seemed pretty annoyed that I didn't want the premade stuff. The salsa that comes with the chips is also very nicely seasoned, a little spicy, but perfect for your appetizer.   When we all finally decided on food, I ordered the Texan Fajitas - chicken, shrimp, & beef. It had zero flavor. I only ate half of the meat and didn't even want to take it home.  I personally did not order any margarita, but I tasted a friends, banana frozen.  Poor flavor choice aside, the margarita tasted awful. I would not have been able to drink the whole thing.  I probably will not be going back to this restaurant....but that guac, though."}
{"text":"7 pm on a Friday night.  Place is bustling.  Seated promptly by a friendly hostess.  Drinks served quickly. Coffee was old, not hot but warm.  2 powdered creamers (powdered-really?) And one had stains of some kind on it.   Had 2 ask twice for sugar. Free chips and salsa but the salsa had so much cilantro in it that was all you could taste.  Offered free refills on the Pepsi (what!  No Mexican Coke?).  Decorated nicely in a touristy way.  Priced reasonably but hardly what I would call a bargain.  Wife ordered enchiladas and I ordered the Molcajete which is hard to find here.  We spend a lot of time in AZ so we are a little spoiled by tradition Mexican food.  Our orders seemed to take quite a long time to get to us.  The cheese enchalados had no cheese and were cold.  My wife sent them back.  They reamde them and everything was ok.  I was EXTREMELY dissapointed with the Molcajete.  Some steak, 3 Tbls of Chipole sausage 1 Tbls of onion aand a whole bund of radishes.   The dish was cold 1/3 of the way thru. The cook needs to go back and learn how to make this.  Definately one of the worst meals we have had in quite a while.    PS. My wife says the enchiladas tasted like cardboard."}
{"text":"I had the Enchiladas Poblanos.  They came in a tangy brown sauce.  Huge portion, delicious salsa.    It's the best kind of strip-mall mexican, if you catch my drift.  I wouldn't bring a hot date there, but excellent comfort food.  Big Flat Screen on the wall of the main dining room with ESPN.  Beer specials if you care for that.  Can't go wrong for about $10."}
{"text":"This is a great place for quick hot Mexican food! My friend and I went there for lunch since we craved Mexican food. As soon as we got seated we were served with chips and salsa and the salsa was yummy despite the chips tasting slightly stale. Their lunch menu has amazing deals- I got an enchilada, chalupa and rice for only $5.99!! Our meals came quickly and overall I can't complain! There's ample parking and a good stop for those who need to take a break from the dealerships that surround the place if you're shopping around for cars :)"}
