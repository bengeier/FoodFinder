{"text":"Had an overall great experience here.  I was even surprised that they were able to cater to my gluten allergy with a spelt pasta option. Would defintely consider going back here!"}
{"text":"Four of us attended Ciao on a January evening. All of us were sorry we did.  There we a number of issues, but the primary one was the food had a \"bad\" taste to it. As if the food was off, or spoiled. Two people had the same thing, the other two had something different. No one finished the entre.  We had appetizers which were ok and much more tasty then the entre.  The service was good, very nice young man.  We didn't complain about the food, we just all agreed what's the point.  We sat eight feet from the windows and were very cold all evening  it was a cold windy night. Most of the cold was coming in through the open doors, they need a improved system to keep the cold out. Needless to say we won't be returning, and suggest that you save your night and eat somewhere else."}
{"text":"Great ambience and service! Food was delicious. It was on the expensive side but considering it is located in Yorkville, the price seemed right. Would definitely try the Sangria if you go here!"}
{"text":"I went here for the Tuesday $22 Lobster deal. I made a reso and asked for a table by the window which wasn't a problem at all.   The ambiance and decor was really nice and I could see this place had class.   A bottle of wine was ordered and the server seemed like he had a far grasp on his wine knowledge which was awesome.   The menu however did say \"whole lobster\" but we only received half a lobster. Still all said and done the 2 dish's we ordered tasted pretty good. My preference was for the grilled lobster oppose to the lobster linguine.  I was on a date and didn't require much service and this would have been my only complaint that the table maintenance was not kept up well enough and the server was not personable while at the table.   The cocktail, desert and affogato that followed were pretty decent and overall I had a lovely time."}
{"text":"Although I do like most of Liberty's restaurants this one falls just a bit short. The venue is amazing like other Liberty venues but I really did have quite the bad experience when dining here.  Occasion one: After waiting a regular 10-15 minutes for a 2 top table in the lounge area it took about another 10-15 minutes for the server to initially greet us. This was the single only time I have thought about walking out of a restaurant. My partner was also ready to leave but just as we were set to leave the server finally came by and we decided to stay. However, the food was just not that stellar. Pasta and chicken were nothing to rave about.  A couple months later I decided to give it a second try, as I had a friend in from Montreal and was showing him around Yorkville and Ciao caught his eye. It was patio season now, so we took a seat on the patio. Service was volumes better (it was a lot less busy) but yet again the food was just not that great.   All in all I recommend Ciao if you are looking to enjoy some drinks with a date in a well designed venue but I'll pass on the food."}
{"text":"It's fine as a wine bar but as far as food goes the pizzas are about the only thing I would recommend.  I have tried other items on the menu but wasn't impressed."}
{"text":"had \"linguini with whole lobster\" tuesday special menu and it was so juicy....amazing! svc was good too."}
{"text":"We celebrated my niece's confirmation or some god-type event there this afternoon.  Had a really good time!  The basement space is special, lots of ambiance and a spacious layout.  Really enjoyed all the courses we had, even the table bread is worth mentioning, sprinkled with rosemary. Our large group universally agreed its worth further visits as the food was great. I'd like to congratulate the bartending staff.  Had some outstanding cocktails. Quite a few really.  Service was outstanding, not sure who is posting poor service reviews, must be some poncey spoiled prince/princess who -if they don't live at home with mummy- probably will go home to their unmade bed and filthy kitchen because they're fundamentally useless and I imagine those are the ones whinging about service."}
{"text":"The resto owns up to its name with a wine list as long and extensive as the song book at Sunday Sermons.     What you need to watch out for:  Their pasta fresca (fresh pasta)  Burrata from Italy  and Thursday socials from 4-7. Yelpers. This means 1/2 OFF WINE. Go thirsty."}
{"text":"i work around the corner and i thought Ciao would be a great spot to bring friends who are new to the area. boy was i wrong.  the service was horrible. our server was lifeless, rude, clueless, did not know anything about the menus (food & wine) and seemed overall very bored and totally unenthusiastic about his job - which made us feel sorry we chose the restaurant.  the food was tasteless... no amount of salt, pepper, parmesan cheese or the bland 'hot' peppers they provided could have made the pasta that was rudely \"dropped\" down in front of me taste anything like it should have.  one of the women ordered a salad as her main and it was delivered 3 minutes after ordering - we sent is back to be delivered when the rest of us had our food... not to mention it was incredibly over priced for a huge plate of dry, wilted radicchio. although the place was quite busy, i noticed few people eating - we should've taken the hint.  on the plus side: the chairs were comfortable.   NEVER GOING BACK. what a shame. I expected more from a place in such a great location. there are so many other, better restaurants in the area - don't waste your time at ciao."}
{"text":"Ciao is a great place to go for a big Italian dinner or even just to grab a few drinks at the bar. The lower level of the restaurant is ideal for large parties, as it's tucked away from the crowds upstairs, and makes you feel sort of like you're in a place reserved for special guests.  The food is simple Italian - mainly pizza and pasta on the menu - and they do it well."}
{"text":"I came here two summers ago for their summerlicious. Had the mushroom risotto I believe it was delicious. Loved everything I ordered!   People who work there seem like airheads, don't smile and are arrogant. My waitnress was a beautiful blond who seemed a bit obtuse. She didn't smile and wasn't polite. Everyone likes having goodlooking servers working in their restaurants but courtesy and politeness go a long way!  I asked a man standing at the front where the washroom was and he didn't respond to me in a polite and amiable way. There are a lot of very attractive people who are do not have their heads in the clouds, hire them!"}
{"text":"We made a reservation for 8:30 pm for 8 people. After being seated by the hostess we were left to read the menu for 30 min since the server had not come to take our drink order. After 30 min of sitting in a very noisy spot( the downstairs section during this time is PACKED and makes it very hard to hear your friend on the other end of the table) the manager , Victoria, approached us and was shocked that we hadn't been served. As a result, the rest of our night unfolded in a somewhat VIP style. Victoria was fantastic!  She promptly took our order, made sure everything was  served very quickly, gave us free shots, took the wine of the menu as well as the desserts! The food overall was delicious! Good portions for pizza (massive) and pasta."}
{"text":"It was two of my friends birthdays this week so we primed up at the pilot after work and headed to ciao for dinner.  They sat us in the lower section which is decorated to resemble an old wold wine cellar.  The waiter was very courteous and attentive to all our needs throughout the night.  I had the sausage calzone which was fantastic and my girlfriend had one of the pasta's which she was iffy on because it had only an olive oil sauce and not too much flavour but I had a taste and thought it was great.  We finished the night off with a Lucano.  Overall I had a blast and stuffed myself silly.  Will visit again"}
{"text":"Huge wine list,  restaurant is huge with a great design and layout.  The polenta fries are to die for.  If you want a Yorkville experience with Yorkville quality but don't want to pay Yorkville prices,  check out Ciao"}
{"text":"Want just a light snack with a glass of wine, this bar & area is just the place!!. A little on the expensive side, but the ambience, quality of food & wine plus service is worth it. After all one has to $purge occasionally. Will go back and try a full meal sometime.  They are advertising Life After Work - Thursday @ Ciao. 5:30pm Enjoy Wine, Cocktails & Hors d'Oeuvres. Have not been there yet but I am sure that it will be a zoom full of beautiful people!!!!!!! Just steps from the furthest west end of the platfom exit from Bay Station."}
{"text":"Fantastic place, atmosphere, food, ambience, service, and price."}
{"text":"A great place to enjoy a bottle of wine after a long day at work. An aesthetically pleasing dining room, with three levels of seating. They have a DJ spinning music during the dinner service. However the music coupled with the noise from other patrons was quite loud, a couple of times i found myself shouting at my friend.   We started with the Prosciutto and Formaggio platter and bread, the bread came out piping hot with olives, and let me tell ya the bread and olives were fantastic. Haven't had olives as good as those in any other restaurant. Having the cheese and select cuts of ham, paired with my new favourite red wine J. Lohr Estates Seven Oaks Cabernet Sauvignon (an extra dry red), it was pure delight. Next came the main dishes we shared a farfalle pasta in a medley of vegatables and their daily special lamb rack. Their pasta was nothing spectacular, but their lamb was quite good.  For dessert we shared their raspberry cheesecake -a soft light cheesecake with fresh raspberries in a caramel sauce. A perfect end to a pleasant meal.  Service was excellent, I would come back to have a drink with friends. It's a nice place to hang out , the ambience is modern and cozy. It makes you want to sit and linger for a few hours, a great place to spend an evening with friends to catch up on old times."}
{"text":"Went here for friend's birthday.  Design and atmosphere lived up to Toronto standards. Though the waiters attire (casual) didn't match the rest of the place. Seemed like they should have been working at Jack Astor's. Food was mediocre. Ordered the ravioli. It was good, though not a fan of the rose sauce. The worst part though was they didn't do anything for birthdays. The hostess looked at me funny when I asked. That was odd. Not sure if this is a Toronto thing or just this restaurant."}
{"text":"Phenomenal pasta made in house, unique menu and great service and classic Italian ambiance. Need I say more?"}
{"text":"Went here over the weekend for a large party. The location and atmosphere is great. Too bad the food was just ok. They had arranged a prix fix menu for us which had options for the veggies (aka ME!).  App: Eggplant parm (I forget what they called it, but essentially eggplant parm). This was quite delicious... and LARGE The serving size was what I would expect for a main. I decided to eat the whole thing.  Read on and you'll know why I was glad I did :/ Main: Fettuccini primavera... I literally only took one bite of my food. It was awful!!! The noodles were undercooked, there was like zero sauce and three (yes, 3) peas in my primavera which was described as cooked with tomato sauce and garden vegetables... I guess if you get technical about it, then 3 peas does count as vegetableS :/ The server brought out a plate full of sauce and veggies, but that doesn't exactly cook up the undercooked pasta noodles. Suffice to say, I'm glad I filled up on the eggplant parm. My sister ate a little more than I did and ended up with a stomach ache... I ordered a cappuccino while waiting for the main to arrive because I can't really go out late at night any more... the server forgot about it and ended up asking me while I was picking at my main: \"Oh you ordered a cappuccino didn't you\"... why yes I did... 30 mins ago... Thank goodness I didn't fall asleep on the table.  Dessert: Tiramisu (my husband ordered) and some kind of chocolate bomba thing... OK so the tiramisu was the worst I've ever had. It was dry... Who has ever heard of a tiramisu being dry? we only took a bite because it was so gross.  The bomba thing was passable...  Overall, I would never ever come back here... The food was way over priced considering that the only edible thing was the appetizer.  We weren't even offered to be comped for the pasta... so disappointing. The service was just ok and the food was terrible. The only good thing about this place is that it looks good... which doesn't go a long way on an empty stomach. Find another place... there are so many near by."}
{"text":"Service:   A lot of people rate the service here poorly, but on the two occasions I've been I had very good service.  In both cases the server was friendly, prompt, and helpful.  Food:  The food is less than mediocre.   I've had a pizza that was burnt-to-crumbly; gnocchi with lukewarm canned tomato sauce poured over it; eggplant that was cooked so mushy it was like baby food; and a not-so-fresh salad.  The wine list is long, but not necessarily extensive, and some odd absences (only two bottles from Argentina seems too little).    Ambiance:   This is likely the main reason people come here.  There are 3 levels, and each is a little different, but all are busy, noisy, full of people out for a night on the town.  More of a bar feel than a restaurant feel.    Overall:  Even though the food is closer to 1 star, I give it 3 stars overall because it isn't the kind of place you come to if you are looking for great food and wine (Carens is just around the corner, and light years ahead in that regard).  If you're looking for a happening place to see and be seen, and choke down some burnt pizza while you do it, then Ciao is a good fit."}
{"text":"Great food, service, atmosphere. We happened across this place by fluke when we couldn't get a seat at Nirvosa. Had one of the tastiest dinners out in a long time."}
{"text":"We've been twice now and first time was acceptable, but the second visit was very poor.    The Good: Good selection of wine, decent bottle prices and polenta fries were the best parts of our visits.  Nice atmosphere and service was good until had to wait for 15 minutes for our empty dinner plates to be cleared.  The Bad: Undercooked, slimy grilled calamari on both visits, the second being bad enough that we had to send it back in exchange for another appetizer.    On our recent visit we ordered a pizza as well as chianti braised short ribs.  The pizza was cold when it arrived and short ribs, although tasted good at the time, left me with some very unpleasant illness all night (I assume food poisoning).  After our last visit, its safe to say we won't be back again."}
{"text":"-The cocktails were good; a little overpriced. We got Mojito and apple martini.  - This was my second time there. We ordered the trout fish and Fusili. It was just two orders and it took them more than 1 HOUR to bring us the food. That was not pleasant, since we were starving by the time they brought the food. However, it didn't happen the previous time we went to Ciao. Maybe some sort of one time mistake."}
{"text":"Went there 2 weeks ago for a late lunch and was very pleased!  The service and atmosphere were really good.  At $15 for a 3 course meal, it's an amazing deal as the food was delicious!    My only criticism is that I wished the portions were a bit smaller.  Yes, smaller.  I was so full that I skipped dinner.  Even my boyfriend who loves pasta thought it was too much food.   Portions might be more appropriate for dinner than lunch."}
{"text":"does everyone come here for parties or occasions?  well me too.   been here twice for birthdays. food has always been excellent.    was here this weekend for a friends birthday in the private party room downstairs.   good service from our waitress and the manager -- he 'managed' (yeah pun intended) to pop in from time to time to check on how we were doing. :)  Momentus Experience:  I had the best veal sandwich I've ever had in my life last night!  okay for dinner typically most people choose a pasta or a pizza perhaps. that what a majority of people from the table chose.  I felt like getting something light and different. so I chose a Panini specifically.   Veal with tomato sauce, red peppers, mushrooms, in a warm panino   When the food started to arrive the server was wielding this Huge blue flying saucer asking who ordered the Veal Panini? Umm guess that was mine as my eyes popped out to size this up.. this sandwich was Humungi !!  How was I going to eat this?   suspicious I thought to myself  why on earth do they give you so much? is the taste good?  When I bit into this it was heavenly, the panini was so soft, i could tell the bread was freshly baked.. i could taste the dusted flour, and the meat was so very tender and fresh. It was perfect. I was stunned!!  This sandwich also came with a boston lettuce salad? perhaps a bonus as it wasn't specified on the menu. thanks. it was very good too.   The decor, ambiance, service and food were all great. It's not everyday you experience food made perfect. Ciao i got to give you props. i'll be back discovering your menu and celebrating my own 'invented' special occasions here. :D"}
{"text":"Slow but polite service. They screwed up my order and offered to do nothing. The general thoughts around the table was that there was absolutely nothing special about any of the dishes. I had the beef carpaccio which I did enjoy, but my pizza was rather lacklustre.  For dessert we had the tiramisu which was quite delicious but took a very long time to arrive and came at least 15 mins after our coffees.   The wine menu is decent and the decor is nice. I wish we had just stopped in for a glass of wine and eaten nothing."}
{"text":"I would have given this place 4 stars two years ago, but this place has gone to shit. New owners started using cheap olive oil, skimping on portions, and raised the pieces. The service is crap. The last time I went there I sat at a table for 25 minutes and was ignored, no water, nothing. We walked out and went to cafe nervosa down the street. Do not go here. It was one of my favourite places, and I've tried a few times to give it another chance but it's just shit now."}
{"text":"Located in the heart of Yorkville, this is a sophisticated and busy restaurant and wine bar.  The interior is very pretty with visible wine rooms and rustic decor.  Their service has always been great - they have friendly, helpful and doting servers and hosts.  They offer a plate of foccacia to start with pickled olives and peppers.  The bread is very delicious with olive oil and balsamic vinegar.  It's a good start if you've ordered one of their Wines from their extensive Wine Menu.  Spaghetti Carbonara - it's definitely our favourite there.  There's just the right amount of sauce vs. noodles.  So yummy!  Their pizzas are delicious as well.  I like to try new pizzas every time I go and I still have yet to try all of them!  This time, I got the Patate + Salsiccia, which has mozzarella, gorgonzola, potatoes, and spicy Italian sausage. I've never had pizza with potatoes in it, but it was cooked to perfection so the potato was not too much on the pizza. The gorgonzola was very strong, which I loved, but if you're not into that, stay clear and get their Quattro Stagioni or Pollo Pizza.  The only time I wasn't happy with the food here was during Summerlicious 2012 with a few of my friends.  My pizza was surely delicious, but they really fell short on their sandwiches.  I suggest going here for dinner or for a few drinks and ordering from their Pasta & Pizza sections."}
{"text":"Restaurant: Ciao Wine Bar Cuisine: Italian Location: Yorkville Address: 133 Yorkville Price Range: $15~  1: Poor 2: OK 3: Good 4: Very Good 5: Excellent  Food: 2  Service: 3  Ambiance: 4 Overall: 3  Extra information:  * Happy hour * Takes reservations * Open for lunch and dinner  Ever heard of girls night out? I am sure you've had one or had girls around you that screams 'girls night out!!' in a high pitched voice and hop around in circle. Well, that was what I was suppose to have with few of my girlfriends at Ciao Wine Bar. Every thursday, there is a happy hour from 4pm to 7pm and their martinis are around $5 each. Which I must say, is a very good deal cause everyone needs a drink on a Thursday.  Anyways, I've passed by Ciao Wine Bar many times but never realized the restaurant was so big until I walked in.  Honestly, I don't mean it was all spacious and luxurious when I say the restaurant was really big. I found it to be a little cluttered with so many different sections to the restaurant and the tables were placed very much near each other it wasn't very ideal.  We started with some bread which I actually really enjoyed with little bit of salt on top and the black/green olives on the side.  Ordered: Ciao Apple Martini 5/5  * At $4.50, this tasted like green apple martini and it did what it was suppose to for me on a Thursday night  Ordered: Fried Calamari 3/5  * Plate of fried calamari with garlic aioli and tomato sauce for $15.99 * Deep fried anything is always good but I found it to be just ok * Calamari itself lacked flavor which meant I had to smother it in the sauce  Ordered: Capricciosa Pizza 3/5  * Pizza with italian ham and artichoke for $16 * I found it to be decent also, but nothing amazing  Ordered: Arugula Prosciutto Salad 2/5  * Arugula topped with prosciutto and parmesan for $15 * It's hard to mess up a salad.. it was alright but again, nothing special for what it's worth * I feel like they were a little too skimpy on the cheese  Ordered: Seafood Linguini 2/5  * Linguini with squid, shrimp, mussels and clams in white wine sauce for $21 * This was probably one of the worst seafood linguinis I've tried in a long time * For a dish called 'seafood' linguini, it lacked seafood and that is just unacceptable * And even with the seafood that was there, it was frozen seafood which is just sad  Ordered: Red Sangria Pitcher 3/5  * I found their sangria to be quite expensive for $30 when the pitcher was so tiny * The pitcher poured out abour 3.5 glasses and that was it  Honestly I am finding restaurants in Yorkville to be over priced and over hyped for what it is. Don't get me wrong, they are all pretty decent to some point but I feel like none of them really lives up to my expectation in terms of food. But then again, I haven't been to all of the restaurants in Yorkville so I am still searching.  Conclusion: Happy hour is great at Ciao Wine Bar on Thursdays but if you are all about the food, I could skip out on Ciao and head somewhere else."}
{"text":"Great establishment, simulates the attire of a club while still being an intimate restaurant perfect for a date. Stylish place and great food, their prices are pretty high but it's understandable due to the kind of atmosphere it gives off. A good restaurant for a night out."}
{"text":"The staff here was totally aloof and into their own petty shit. They don't care about their customers at all. It was a quite an unsatisfactory experience. Keep it up and you'll  keep losing customers assholes. Unbelievable. Not good. I can't recommend. Not very friendly."}
{"text":"Great vibe here, friendly knowledgable service too. Loved people watching on the outdoor patio. The food was delicious!! Huge restaurant with lots of patio seating on or off the sidewalk. Really enjoyed it and highly recommend it for anybody wanting some quality Italian food and wine in Yorkville."}
{"text":"By Yorkville standards, Ciao is stadium sized and reasonably priced. The food is good and atmosphere/service very good. I randomly stopped in for dinner on a Tuesday   recently - I always like how they have decent fish options - and was happily surprised to find they have a lobster special that night. You can get a whole grilled for $22!  It was awesome."}
{"text":"I went there for my birthday with my boyfriend for the first time and absolutely loved everything about the restaurant. The decor was beautiful and the atmosphere was very intimate. I had a pesto gnocchi with a pinot white wine and it was absolutely delicious! The pasta was home made and fresh and the pesto sauce tasted right out of Italy, definitely going back."}
{"text":"Maybe 2.5 is more accurate. Why? Average food, average service, chipped window sills and cracked $1.00 IKEA candle holders as centre pieces. Unless you look outside, you don't know you're in yorkvile, at all."}
{"text":"Went here with my family tonight: Beautiful interior, clean restrooms, so-so service, and the food was pretty good, but perhaps, a bit overpriced for the food. Guess that comes with the location. But yay! for free wifi!  At our table we had polenta fries, bread and olive oil + vinaigrette, lasagna, a salad, pollo parmigiano, and gnocchi. Plenty of interesting selections. I would give it a second try, but I was not blown away."}
{"text":"For a Friday night, it was busy but not that busy. Our group of 11 hardly saw the server.  Service was lacking, and food was ok. I ordered the ravioli - too aldente for my liking. Most of the  others ordered pizzas which looked more appetizing than my pasta. And one friend ordered the seafood risotto. She initially mentioned that it was delicious, but the more of it she had, it became more salty. Overall, it had a nice ambience, but I wouldn't order the pasta again."}
{"text":"Went here on a first date.   Food is terrible. Nothing I liked especially not for the price.   Staff was okay but a bit snooty given the location.  Lost my scarf. Tried to contact management but no one ever got back to me."}
{"text":"This place went from 5 stars to 2 in just two visits. The food still remains the best part about this restaurant. (hence why they at least get two stars) It's the liquids that went down the drain. Our server, who mentioned her extensive wine knowledge, suggested a different bottle of wine to me (although I had already chosen one), that she thought was comparable in price but had more complexity. If comparable in price is double the price, then yup, it's comparable!   Although we asked for normal water, there was a charge for $14.00 for water. (The waitress took this off the receipt when after defensively saying she doesn't know the prices on wine so she didn't know that the bottle she suggested was twice the price.. still doesn't compensate for the difference). I have since written the restaurant but am yet to hear anything in return.  Hopefully they will make sure their servers are wine savvy before allowing them to make costly mistakes."}
{"text":"Randomly chose this restaurant when cutting through Yorkville Saturday night.  Had the lasagna and  it was delicious.  Decided to splurge for a dessert and enjoyed their rendition of a tiramisu."}
{"text":"Romantic, candlelit setting makes Ciao a great restaurant you can relax and enjoy the evening.  Popped in with a girlfriend for an early dinner. We didn't have reservations but were seated immediately. Ciao is a fairly large restaurant, 2nd floor dining area, bar/lounge and a downstairs.  The wine list is quite extensive and menu full of Italian selections. We shared a few anti-pastos:  Grilled eggplant/zucchini ($11), assorted funghi - portobello, oyster, and cremini mushrooms) ($12), and the black tiger shrimp ($16).  Some have commented that prices are quite steep for what you get, but I think for the atmosphere, it's expected. No problems with service, as we were dining quite early.  Agree with other Yelpers that this would be a nice spot for a Birthday!"}
{"text":"I visited in Feb 2013 for dinner and the experience was great. The food was excellent, as were the friendly staff and the great atmosphere. For the location, the menu prices are reasonable, and it helps that the portions for the pastas are huge. My group had the soft/hard cheese plate with fruit and honey as an app and it was very good. I had the linguine with grilled chicken and pesto which was good; not amazing but good. A friend of mine ordered the orecchiette with sausage and rapini which I liked the most. For desert, we shared the nutella pizza with chocolate shavings, bananas and hazelnuts; very filling.  4 stars in my books!! Hope to visit soon."}
{"text":"Went here for a long-awaited girls' night with 5 girlfriends last night.  When we arrived, we were offered a long high top table in the basement, with stool seating.  We asked if we could have a booth and were told we could, but we had to be done by 9 pm.  It was 7:15, this didn't seem like an issue.  Booths were comfortable and perfect for a group of six (2 people on each side).  The table shared two pitchers of white wine sangria (yum! but a better size for 4 people than 6).  However, the second pitcher took about 45 minutes to come out after we ordered it.  The server told us that \"the bartender had been MIA\" but you could smell that he smelled like a cigarette (recently smoked), so methinks he himself went out for a quick smoke.....  Food was very good.  I had the di Napolil pizza.  I like that, unlike Terroni, they give you balsamic vinegar and Parmesan cheese shaker (! YAY!) on the table.    Other weird notes include the washroom attendant (very off-putting in a restaurant, and she was completely unnecessary) and the server checking our bills for tips as we paid individually by CC machine.  Overall, I'd go back, especially since they take Opentable resos."}
{"text":"I knew going in to this the service at Ciao wine bar is not the greatest. I tried to pre-order my appetizers and offered to give my credit card over the phone, but they wouldn't let me. Darn.   I arrived at 9:30 on friday and was seated at a table for ten and waited ten minutes but nobody came to take my order. I didn't want my guests to wait to eat, so I tracked down a server on the stairs and ordered a bunch of appetizers and platters.   We had:  The bruschetta - good sized portion. A bit on the garlicky side.  The Buffalo mozzarella and tomato - This was great! Huge hunk of cheese. The cheese platter - excellent mix of sweet and savoury.  the Salumi platter - really spicy salami, which I like. I've had better prociutto.  Our server took forever to bring us water. He finally came over with a tray of glasses of water, instead of a pitcher, which to me felt like a waste of time.  One friend ordered a martini and it took like 15 minutes to arrive. The server blamed this on a \"frustrating bar tender.\"  We had a few bottles of a fabulous Barolo.  The atmosphere at Ciao is perfect, the wine list is amazing, the food is okay, the service is sub par. I suggest coming here for drinks, not dinner, and know what you're getting in to."}
{"text":"I dined here for lunch during Winterlicious 2013 and it was fabulous.   First off, the restaurant has a modern industrial look (top levels) mixed with a cozy wine cellar (bottom level). The bottom level looks amazing for private parties.  The portions were very generous for Winterlicious. Often I find restaurants give you mini portions for this event but these were (hopefully) full size. If not, then I would really hate to see how massive the full size portion really is. Eeks!  The quality of the food was excellent. You can tell everything is fresh and handmade in-house, which is important to me. As a vegetarian, I was pleasantly surprised by the variety of options available sans viande. The grilled veg were to die for, I seriously haven't stopped thinking about them. And the cheese cake was so light, fresh, and tangy with luscious lemon goodness.  The pizza was New York style... very thin crust. It's better than most pizza in this city but it's not perfect. The middle of the crust was soggy and the edges were too hard to eat. I felt like a baby cutting the edges off, but I noticed other tables that ordered the pizza did as well.   The wine was excellent. I had the pinot noir that is sold by the glass (don't recall the name)... but I spent a great deal of time enjoying the aroma before diving in. I'll definitely be back for the veg and wine. But, I think I'll pass on the pizza and opt for one of the handmade pastas instead."}
{"text":"Took the in-laws and wifey to celebrate the mother-in-law's birthday.  Made reservations and they were good to seat us quickly (about 5-10 mins after we arrived).  Our server whose name slips me was a real gentlemen, very engaging and took good care of us despite how busy the restaurant was.  The food was great, the atmosphere just right for a chill yet lively Saturday night.  Its reasonably priced given its Yorkville  ($300 included tip for appetizers, 2 bottles of wine, dinner and dessert for 4).  Definitely would return."}
{"text":"I still love CIAO. i made a reservation for Friday night and it was packed as usual. Check in was pretty smooth. We were able to get a table quickly upstairs, away from the crowds near the kitchen. That was a bonus I suppose. Our waiter was really friendly...he was on top of everything despite how busy it was.   We had the carpaccio for appetizer, i had my usual- the prosciutto panini --and we also had the diavola pizza....For dessertwe tried gelato and the canoli but the desserts are not the highlight of this place. Will not get them next time..."}
{"text":"Went here for Winterlicious with 2 friends. Ordered the garlic shrimp appetizer, the pizza main, and the panna cotta dessert.   I wasn't looking forward to this place in a huge way because the food looked a bit plain, but the original menu looked amazing, so it made me feel like they were simply putting out their cheapest dishes for Winterlicious.  Regardless. We were also served fresh rosemary bread with olives, which was yummy, fresh and warm.   The appetizer of the garlic shrimp was nice and spicy, but the tomato sauce tasted a little too much like somebody heated up simple, canned tomato sauce from a can.   The main dish, the pizza, was thin crust with cherry tomatoes and cheese & basil. Simple, but pretty good. Nothing spectacular. I know my friends really enjoyed their Penne alla Vodka with panchetta. There seemed to be a lot of vegetarian choices for the mains, which on one hand is great, but for a carnivore like myself, limited my desire to pick something.  Finally, the dessert. That is the true reason I gave this place 3 stars. The panna cotta was so beautifully set and so delicious. Not oversweet, and it had a tiny smudge of some fruit compote on the side. It's why I agreed to come to this place in the first place. Cream desserts are a simple way to my heart.  All in all, good experience. Servers were quick, friendly and accurate. Food came out quickly. I just wish I didn't feel a little cheated out of the variety of their full menu."}

{"text":"I went to Ciao Wine Bar for Winterlicious and I was really excited. Too bad I was extremely disappointed.   The only reason that I'm giving this place 3 stars instead of 1 is because of the AMAZING food.   My friend and I walked into Ciao and the atmosphere was pretty good. I like the whole dimmed-lighting feel. We were seated upstairs where we waited about 15 minutes for our waitress to finally acknowledge us. Strike 1.  She took our drink order, but took 15 minutes just to bring out some sangria. She also forgot to bring us bread (for a person who avidly works out, I think I deserved the carbs that day- apparently, she didn't seem to think so). When the sangria FINALLY came, she took our food orders. It took the appetizer half an hour to come out. Strike 2. I had the Pasta Fagoli which was this bean soup with tomatoes and pancetta. You couldn't see the pancetta, but it was definitely there and it added a great dimension to the soup. There was a smoky bacon flavour that would just hit you. Amazing.  Next, it took nearly another half hour for the main course to come out. Strike 3. I had the Chianti Braised Short Ribs with creamy gorgonzola polenta and crispy onions. Omg. That's all I can really say. The short ribs were falling apart because they were so tender. The gorgonzola was a great accent to the flavours of the short ribs. This was just perfect and it made the wait worth it.   Finally, after another 20 minutes, our desserts had been served. I had the Lemon Ricotta Cheesecake with raspberry caramel. It was pretty good, but I was dying to have more. It was just like any other cheesecake to me-light texture though.  There were people sitting around my friend and I that were seated about half an hour after us, but received their desserts while we were only on our main course. The reason?: they were served by a different waitress. She pretty much threw away her chances of getting a good tip. My tip to her: get some hustle in your step like the rest of the waiters at Ciao! Prob won't be back. I'm tired of paying 4 star prices for 1 star service."}
{"text":"Overall, I wasn't overly impressed.  The food was pretty good.  The wine list was great.  The service was also exceptional.  But I came for dinner and the food didn't wow me."}
{"text":"This resto was surprisingly big and neatly decorated.  I had never noticed it even though I'd walked by it many times.  It's really quite cool inside.  In terms of the food (which is always my focus!), it was adequate.  Nothing to rave about really.  My lamb ragu pasta was pretty good, although a bit on the oily side.  My friend liked his lasagna, but it didn't taste all that authentic to me.  The dishes are reasonably priced though.  Perhaps the disappointing part of the meal though were the desserts.  The tiramisu tasted basically like coffee and air, and the chocolate baci tasted more artificial and mass-produced than not.  What really killed my experience at this resto though was the seating.  There's a huge range of tables and seating, but me and my friends were seated at one of the booths.  The benches on each side of the table were incredibly low, so the table ended up reaching almost my chest, which didn't make for a comfortable dining experience.  Worst of all though, the benches we were on were way too wide, so if you wanted to rest your back on the backrest your torso would be at a 45 degree angle!!  I needed a 12-inch pillow if I wanted to lean back comfortably.  By the end of our meal my back was literally sore!  Never before has the seating been such an issue.   I wouldn't rush back to this place anytime soon. There's a number of good Italian eateries in Yorkville, some of which serve better quality food within the same price range (I'm thinking Dimmi or Nervosa)."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend for their $15 Winterlicious special.  The decor of the place is absolutely gorgeous. As my friend and I had came here directly after class, we were a bit underdressed for this type of environment. Luckily the restaurant was quite empty at the time since it was a Thursday afternoon.  The service was okay, could have been better.  I had minestrone soup, their panini with prosciutto, and a vanilla panna cotta for dessert.  The minestrone soup was satisfactory, nothing memorable. The panini however... WOW, I am normally a very quick eater but it took me about 45 minutes to finish the two portions that they gave me! It was very, very good. The panna cotta was also delicious  Overall, I was satisfied with my meal. 3 courses for $15 that left me with a little pot belly? A great deal if you ask me."}
{"text":"I was taken to Ciao for Valentine's Day 2011.  I just started posting reviews on yelp so be patient!  SAW:  The ambience was dim lit, it was fairly crowded. The decor was trendy. I saw late 20's to mid 40's. There is a lower level that mimics an open concept wine cellar, where I assume it is more like a lounge. I inquired, the also rent that space out for private events.  EXPERIENCED: Upon arrival we were escorted to the upper mezzanine level.  The waiter was not attentive, and forgot to bring me my wine for a long period of time - I am usually quite patient, so when I say long - it was painfully long. On a positive note, the waiter was knowledgeable about wine pairings.  TASTE:  I ordered pizza, bland. My date ordered a meat dish, small portions, but this is a pay for the atmosphere place, and probably the wine. The food is below average.  FELT:  Trendy but unsatisfied with the food. To-be-seen kind of place.   FUTURE:  Left feeling like I would return with a group of girls for drinks and appz, or a casual date night."}
{"text":"This restaurant has the worst service in Ontario!   The food wasnt that great  Had rocks in my seafood linguine"}
{"text":"Came here a month ago for drinks.  Atmosphere was great, so I've decided to come back to try the food.  Let me tell you, stay away from the food.  You'll have better luck with food at a franchise restaurant like Moxie than at ciao."}
{"text":"Been here a couple times. Overpriced but decent food. ATROCIOUS service. Too slow for anyone on their lunch hour or with an average lifespan. Shame because the space is so large and lovely - with better staff, it could be great.  Our group was seated at noon, right next to the kitchen (spoiler alert: this has no effect on the length of time anything takes getting from the kitchen to our table). We didn't get any water until 12:30 and our food didn't arrive until 12:50, at which point our appetizers (salads) and mains all showed up at once. Why?  We had maybe 4 different servers and only one of them I would go so far as to call \"pleasant\". The rest I can only assume are working here to support their nighttime careers as magicians, based on how long they would disappear for.   Waitresses never checked on us, never asked if we wanted dessert or not (we didn't) after the tables were cleared, just tossed some dessert menus on the table and vanished. Naturally it was another 10 minutes before we could flag someone down again to ask for the bill and she was unnecessarily curt. We left just before 1:45.  1.5 stars (the extra half star is for the warm bread and spicy olives, which the nice male server refilled and without which we would have perished before our meals came). For me, \"Ciao\" here means goodbye."}
{"text":"Its funny how the turnover of this location for restaurants in Yorkville is so quick. I guess rent is really expensive.   Tonight we came here for a private party, with a set menu for about 25 guests. We had a nice private room (one of many) downstairs in the cellar (this is where the movenpick fish market used to be!).   It's beautifully decorated, with wooden tables (big square ones in booths) and communal tables. In the private room, there was exposed brick and 2 long wooden tables. I like this arrangement because it's provoke conversation with more than 2 people. I believe there was also a flat screen television at the back behind a curtain.   As this party was not organized by me, I can't tell you if they were accomodating (seemed to be) or not etc. However, as a guest, you'll hear my story.   Toasted olive bread came out and was refilled part way. Vinegar came with it, however, the servers forgot to bring out olive oil (only came for one table , not 2) - that was disappointing as they realized it after the main course came.   The food was not bad, not amazing.  We had 3 choices for antipasto, entree and dessert. The grilled calamari ($13 on the menu) was not bad, however, not every part of the calamari was grilled and there were some spongy parts, it made me think it was undercooked. The portions were good. The Arugula salad was just a regular leafy salad ($10) and also a full meal portion, as was the Caeser salad. The Tiger Shrimp was about 3-4 big shrimps with bread on the side.   For entrees I had the Chicken Piccata. I had asked how this was served and if this would be chicken breast. She was unable to answer me, and asked someone. Coming back she told me it was a deboned chicken - which didn't really answer my question. I should have taken a hint and not risked it, but I ordered it anyway. I HATE CHICKEN BREAST for this reason: usually it's dry and flavourless. And that's exactly what I got. It came on a bed of gorganzola polenta (i dislike polenta as well) which tasted okay, but not my cup of tea. Rapini, but only a few stalks.   The steak ($34) seemed like a good portioned size. However, we were told that we were not able to choose the doneness of the meat (minus 1) and that it would all come medium. It all came, medium rare and almost rare. The insides were completely pink/rare. If this was my party, I would have raised a stink about this. Fail.  The dessert, however (the Dark Chocolate Baci bombe) was AMAZING. It was a chocolate mousse sitting on top of a hazelnut praline. It made me think that they did not make this in house.  The in house Tiramusu was served in 2 ice cream scoops, and lacked the potent liqueur flavour.   I would have given the food 3 stars, given I expected less in terms of portions sizes and price, however, it's quite reasonable for Yorkville. I'd probably order pasta ($12-16) if I were here again.   HOWEVER, the problem with sitting at a restaurant for over 5 hours (we left at 12) is that we had a lot of time to criticize and contemplate.  The Service left a lot to be improved.  It seemed like all the waiters were young tall muscular guys that had no clue what they were doing. Everytime it was time to serve, there would be at least 4-5 people in the room with the same dish, trying to figure out who had what. They need a cheat sheet - and really, the people with the steak knives are having steak. was it that hard to figure out??  When we finished each course, my dirty cutlery was taken from my plate and put to the side (not even nicely with the knife on top of the fork). For a restaurant of this calibre, and this private room,  I would expect my cutlery to be replaced, especially since they had to bring out steak knives.   Water was no where to be seen and we had to ask multiple times.   I really think their wait staff needs to step it up to stay in business.   The place is loud. And with a private room, it would be nice to install a door. Some other rooms had a door. When toasts were made, I couldn't hear the person beside me.   As a casual eater in the area, come for the dessert and the wine (excellent)."}
{"text":"I admit that I haven't tried ALL the italian restaurants in Toronto... but of the ones that I have tried, Ciao has been the place that I've gone to multiple times.   Why? Let me count the ways: 1. Reserved table is always ready  2. Amazing service 3. Fabulous Wine Selection 4. The patio feels so European in the Summer 5. The portions are huge! 6. The quality and taste of the food is amaze 7. It's in Yorkville - the perfect locale for a quaint after dinner walk 8. The olives with the bread - delish!  I feel like there's probably a lot more reasons - but I also feel like this is enough to make you want to check it out for yourself!  ps. Be sure to order the Mushroom Risotto - it's divine!!"}
{"text":"Great Food and Australia Open Wine by glass.especially love the seafood reisotto."}
{"text":"Went here last night with 3 others, for Summerlicious. Two of us didn't end up ordering off the Summerlicious menu, and just ordered off the regular one.   Our server maybe came to our table twice for the entire 2 hours we spent there, and forgot our bread, but seemed to be interested in every other table around us. The service was far below standard, and was straight up annoying me. I don't know if it was because two of us ordered Summerlicious, but he seemed to be attending to every other table except ours, and it was noticeable amongst all 4 of us.  The Summerlicious apps were tiny compared to the regular ones, and although at some places this is to be expected, Ciao isn't that fancy shmancy of a place to begin with. The bottle of wine that was suggested to us was a shitty bottle of Chardonnay for $32, after that we stuck to ordering by the glass.  Needless to say, the food was actually pretty good. Pizza was great, pasta dishes were alright too. Typical Italian, and there is definitely better in the city, but if it weren't for the bad service, I might return. Now I most definitely will not. It's unfortunate when this happens, isn't it?  The highlight of our meal was the tour bus parked directly outside the restaurant which was rumoured to be Lady Gaga's, so the place was swarming with paparazzi outside which made for good dinner conversation. HAH."}
{"text":"I came here for Winterlicious after hearing many things about this restaurant... many MIXED reviews. Being to Winterlicious at different restaurants for the past 2 years, I did not have high hopes for the food. They are usually small portions, pre-made, and cold. Ciao was no different, except the dessert- which was the tiramisu - which I ADORED. Once again, you must be noticing a trend with me and sweet foods, but it was to die for.   Anyway, the appetizer and entree was nothing special and regular Winterlicious food. I want to base this review on everything BESIDES the food. We were seated at a window seat. WIth dimmed lights and candles on every table, the ambience of the place was peaceful, was pretty packed on a Saturday night (but not disturbingly noisy), and the servers were helpful and courteous. I very  much enjoyed my seat, the service I was provided, and the time I spent there.   Overall I would say that this is definitely a place you would go to if you are looking for a  chill place to talk, but I can't speak for the food from a fair perspective as I was only served Winterlicious food and not food on the regular menu on a regular day. I would give this restaurant a second shot for sure."}
{"text":"Went there for the winterlicious. The overall experience is just unsatisfied.  1. Second floor - tables are too close, I swear people who are over average weight will have trouble to get in to the seats.  2. The waitress only served me one cup of water during the whole dinner, the cup was small too.  3. I ordered gelato as dessert and the server gave me a fork, which I don't quite understand. I asked for a spoon and the server dropped it on the floor, she picked it up and I'm not sure if she changed it. I couldn't see it clearly since there was a door half closed.   It was very loud, couldn't have a nice conversation. Will not go back again."}
{"text":"I came here with high hopes for the Summerlicious menu. We started with the orecchiette though I should have ordered salad. It was a very generous portion for an appetizer and, along with the bread, filled us up quite substantially before we got to the ravioli. The ravioli was hearty, but also a bit heavy. The sauce and cheese filling made for a really filling meal. By the time we got dessert, I was stuffed and could barely finish it. The espresso tart was very rich, though it lacked a particular delicacy.   The restaurant was quite full when we arrived and they initially seated us on the corner near the stairs, which was not at all a pleasant spot, but before we got settled in, the waiter found us a better table. I really enjoyed the ambiance -- enough lighting to see the food but not too bright. The food was served gradually, allowing us ample time to talk and catch up. The one catch was probably that splitting the bill at the end of the meal was weird, as the waitress rounded up from half of the total, which isn't good practice.  Overall I would say that the ambiance outdid the food. I was expecting something a little more delicate and less like what I can make for myself at home. It was worth a try though as I'd gotten a really good impression from the website and other reviews. I would probably not return unless something on the regular menu caught my eye."}
{"text":"Omg what a train wreck. We went as a group from work. The first thing I did when I walked in was the place smelled like poo, it did because the woman's bathroom flooded. Then the air conditioner was broken and we were all sweating like crazy then to top it off, then one of our guests meals was incorrect. Been there on numerous occasions, thinking it was just a bad day. They should have closed due to the poo issue however they choose to stay open. Gross."}
{"text":"I actually think this restaurant deserves a 3-1/2, but that's not possible. The food is good and the atmosphere is good, but it's quite expensive for what you get (especially for drinks) and I found that the service was mediocre.   We had quite a large group, so we got a variety of pizzas and split them. This was tricky because the pizzas were all divided into four pieces each. Even though we said we were splitting them all, no one seemed to think to split them up a bit more.   They were also quite slow with the service, especially taking our order initially.   But, as I said, the pizzas we ordered were very good. Some stranger combinations were a big hit, like the pear pizza, which worked a bit like a dessert.   The atmosphere is nice, I especially like the basement. So overall if you're looking for a nice night out, I would go for it. If you're looking to just find a good place to eat on a whim, or just because, maybe not."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic! Tuna was incredible, pasta was five stars, and service was better than most places. That waiter was on the ball! Loved everything about this place. Also very good prices, including the wine!"}
{"text":"This place is quite trendy, modern atmosphere, being in the middle of Yorkville.  Since it's open concept, there's a lot of noise.  I've been a couple of times, the food is meh (my spaghetti was stuck together, not boiled properly!!), but the service is insincere and rushed. One of my biggest pet peeves is when the server brings me the bill before I ask for it, and then gently adds in \"no rush\". It happens in most places but I find it rude, capitalistic and lacking hospitality.  And it's happened here quite often. Not my favourite place."}
{"text":"This place came highly recommended by a coworker and since I was going to be in the area for the 2012 Gumball 3000, I figured it would be a convenient place to eat. It was a good thing we made reservations because by 7pm, the restaurant was pretty full.  The atmosphere is trendy and quite stylish yet casual.  The service was quick and friendly but not overly attentive.... meaning, the drinks and food arrived in a timely manner but there was no 'chitchat' from our server; she was 'all business'.  My coworker gave me a handy hint when she said that the salads and pizzas are big enough to split between two people... she wasn't kidding!  We ordered the Cambozola Salad which consisted of radicchio and endive with cambozola cheese, roasted red peppers, black olives and pine nuts; all of which was perfectly dressed with honey, balsamic vinegar and extra virgin olive oil.  To compliment our salad, we ordered the Gorgonzola Pizza which was a beautiful combination of mozzarella cheese, gorgonzola, fresh pears, walnuts and honey.  We were first presented with complimentary bread and black olives with accompanying olive oil and balsamic vinegar; shortly there after, our salad arrived.  The salad was fresh and crisp and as I previously mentioned, perfectly dressed!  What a fantastic combination of ingredients... and the cambozola! Simply delicious!  The pizza wasn't like anything I'd ever had before.  This thin crust pizza was smothered in mozzarella and the perfect amount of gorgonzola, which can be a rather strong flavour. The soft pears and crunchy walnuts offered a wonderful contrast and the honey tied it all back to the salad quite nicely.  Both dishes were a delight to eat both in flavour and texture.  I'm not often in the Yorkville area but I feel this is definitely a menu you could work your way though.  Everything sounded delicious and it wasn't easy to make our choice.  I appreciate that this restaurant labels itself as a 'wine bar' but since we only had an ice tea and a coke (at $4.00 a pop! [no pun intended]), I am not qualified to comment on either their selection or quality of wines.  All-in-all, our dinner was delicious, the atmosphere was beautiful and the next time I'm in the area, I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Well looks like I have the same complaint as everyone else.  The service sucks.  I booked a table for 7 on July 17, 2013.  It was for 1:30pm.  We all arrive and ordered our meals by 1:50pm.  So here's the problem - we get our appetizer an hour later.  By 3:20pm, only 3 of the main courses arrive (which means there is still 4 main courses missing).  3:25pm, two more main courses arrive.  To add to that, the food tastes blend.  The linguine with clams in white wine sauce was tasteless.  Finally, I can't put up with it.  I talk to this older lady working there and she goes - I will bring Victor, the manager over.  Before that, our waitress comes by and asks me - Sorry what did you order again?  I responded - I don't know, its been so long I forgot.  She disappears.  10 minutes (3:35pm) later she brings my grilled chicken in pesto sauce.  Someone must've dumped the entire jar of pesto sauce in the penne.  I ate about 30% and left it.  It was horrible and I've lost my appetite with all that waiting.  Victor, the manager, finally comes over to apologize.  Asks us if we want coffee or tea.  LOL coffee or tea??? I asks for the bill.  He gives us complimentary dessert and a $60 off.  Victor must be in the thinking that all seven of us combined make $30/hr in Yorkville.    Anyways, to cut it short, please stay away from this restaurant.  Unless if you are really bored and have time to waste.  Plus money to burn for food that taste worse than microwave meals.  I really wonder how Ciao can manage to stay in this location for such a long time."}
{"text":"Had dinner at  Ciao recently and it was magnificent!! Great food and excellent service along with a great wine selection. Next time I am in Toronto I will stop by for dinner again. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I literally despise this place.  I'm a vegetarian and each time I come with my partner (who loves carb-y Italian goodness) I think I'll have a better experience... but it always gets progressively worse.  The last time I went to Ciao my purse was stolen. The staff were completely unappreciative, unwilling to help, and said they \"can't do anything about it.\" The manager advised he would call me the next morning... but he didn't. Of course.  DO NOT GO HERE."}
{"text":"Let me preface with the fact that I had been to Ciao Wine bar before and it was an incredible experience which is why I returned to take my girlfriend out for a nice Anniversary dinner. I'm not a negative person, but felt a great restaurant should be made aware when they disappoint.   I had made a reservation in advance, as I know this place can get busy (although it is massive), and also who doesn't make reservations for an Anniversary dinner?   We had just met each other before dinner, so we chatting about our days. Took a while to decide what to eat/drink, which seemed to annoy our server. Once we decided, the food came quick, and I do mean quick.   We hardly had a chance to enjoy the bread before the server had brought our apps. Apps were delicious, but again I was only slightly more than half way through, when they brought our mains and removed my plate for my appetizer.   As soon as our main plates were clear, they had desert plunked on our table, and failed to ask if we would like coffee or tea, and casually dropped the bill on the table seconds after delivering our deserts.   I found this highly distasteful. There was a party sitting nearby that seemed to be growing as more 'unexpected' friends were showing up. I realize that they likely had their eyes on our table, and I respect that. I had made a reservation and was paying as much as anyone else in the restaurant.   I didn't enjoy the feeling of being rushed out of the door as we had hoped to make an evening of our dining experience.  Till next time..."}
{"text":"Just finished at Ciao wine bar and I must say I am extremely disappointed in the service. It was mine and my boyfriends anniversary and she did not even greet us. The food was fantastic but it was sad when she did not even thank us for coming. I am very disappointed as tonight was supposed to be special and we were ignored and treated like trash. I will probably never go back. When a server  is rude it puts a bad taste in your mouth"}
{"text":"Lemme join the herd and heard. Ciao Wine Bar is a decent white linen style restaurant in Yorkville and it won't break the bank. Went here with Slinky Woman for a pre-Valentines dinner as our non-relationship circles the drain.  Highlights:  - Service is excellent.   - Nice spicy peppers in oil for your bread basket along with olives and oil/vinegar.  - Dark, romantic  - Large portions, notably the 'za.  Turning the lights down:  - Tables are packed in TIGHT. We barely had room to squeeze in our chairs without elbowing the diners behind us.  -  The pizza had no zip. Slinky woman liked her roasted chicken  I'll be back."}
{"text":"My husband and I enjoyed Ciao on our trip to Toronto.  We passed by Ciao by chance and were left satisfied with what it had to offer in terms of food and service.  A little warning:  their Arabiatta is extremely spicey so it's not for the faint of heart.  Try their arugula and endive salad and you will not be disappointed.  The tiramisu is also pretty decent as are the wines.  Great atmosphere too!"}
{"text":"Came here with a girl friend for dinner on a Friday night.  We didn't have reservations so were seated in the bar.  It made for some interesting people watching to say the least.    Taking a look at the menu, the prices were pretty good for Yorkville.  They had a wide selection of pizza and pasta.    I had the farfalle with spinach, capers, shavings of parmigiano reggiano, lemon and extra-virgin olive oil.  The portions were pretty good, and it tasted nice.    My friend had a pizza with salmon.  She didn't eat much of it as she said the fish was not fresh.  We were both surprised when the server came to take the plates away and asked if my friend had ever had salmon on pizza before (she had many of times before).  It was quite insulting.  I would have expected something more like \"was there a problem with your food?  is there anything I can do?\"  In fact, it would have been nice if someone had come over sooner in case she wanted to get a different pizza, not after I had completely finished my meal.  That wasn't even the beginning of the bad service.  Both my friend and I had water - weren't really feeling wine - and that seemed to be an instant tip to the servers to ignore us b/c we wouldn't be spending a lot of money.  We ordered a dessert to share, but it sure took a long time to actually put our order in b/c no one came over to take our order for a long time after the dessert menus were provided.  To top it all off, after we paid, the waitress was literally walking by as we were getting up to leave and I went to smile and say thank you.  Well she just walked right past us - and there's no doubt in my mind she saw us - as if we didn't exist b/c they were glad to have a free table.    While I enjoyed my meal, and there were lots of other things on the menu I'd like to try, I don't know if I'll be coming back here any time soon.  I'd give it a try again sometime, but if the service sucks again there's no way I'd be back."}
{"text":"Judging by the area (higher end Yorkville) I thought this beautiful resto would have boasted an equally satisfying meal... Unfortunately this was not the case. It took the server 15 minutes to bring my water to our table, some of the items ordered never arrived (yet were still reflected on our bill), the risotto was horrible (never get this here), and it was hot as heck! They claimed the AC doesn't usually work well during the summer because they keep the windows open - I thought this was hilarious considering 1/3 of the people were fanning themselves with their menus..   Conclusion - I would never return to this restaurant for food, but would return for a casual drink."}
{"text":"Not impressed in general but it was OK.  I came here with a group of 6 girlfriends and thought immediately that the place had the feeling of a chain restaurant...the tables were too big (3 double tables were put together but could have easily fit 4 on each side) and the restaurant was just too big.  Size-wise I'd expect it of Joeys, Cactus, Earls, or the Cheesecake factory..but not really what i'm looking for in Italian.    As for the food, it was average. I live in the UK and caesar salads aren't common here so I was looking forward to a traditional caesar.  I also asked for light dressing.  Way too much dressing and too much bacon - like actual full strips!  Way too big for an appetizer salad. Could have for sure been a full meal.    Had a plain Margarhita pizza as my main. Not adventurous but to be honest I didn't feel it was the place to order a special pasta. Sort of like how I'd never order pasta at a chain...  Anyway maybe my expectations were just wrong.  I guess I expected a trendy small-ish Yorkville restaurant but instead it was huge with no character.  Pretty affordable but gladly would have paid more for a better atmosphere."}
{"text":"We were a party of five going to celebrate my friend's birthday and once we got seated downstairs at their comfy booths, I took in the atmosphere and I actually felt I was in Italy. The brick walls, the dim lighting, the wooden tables all had a rustic feel to it. Nevertheless, I was in Italian paradise.  For my entree, I got the Seared Ahi Tuna that came with a side mixture of mashed eggplant. The eggplant side and the acidity of the green beans really complimented the tuna, but there was too much on the plate! I wish they served less of it and charged less for it. I paid 29 dollars for that sucker. I loved the addition of grapes and black olives on the tuna, it helped make it a cohesive dish.  The night ended with a Chocolate Baci Bombe. The way the waiter described it was a \"Ferrero Rocher Wannabe\" and it truly fit the description. For another nine dollars, you got a chocolate dome with chocolate rice krispies on the bottom and a hazelnut center. Not the best dessert I've had, but it was a respectable effort."}
{"text":"Good wine selection. Decor is nice and glossy but not especially innovative. Bread is OK. Cheese and charcuterie plate were great. Spaghetti carbonara was a little dry, but well portioned. Service is a little distant."}
{"text":"Came here for a friend's birthday. She had looked it up and thought it sound good. First of all, when we made reservations, they only had a 7pm time slot for us (we were looking for 8pm) and when we were there, we were seated in the lower area of the restaurant, which was pretty empty.  There was an extensive menu, everything on the menu sound good, but when we got our food - there was nothing special, especially for what we paid for it.   The pizza's are huge portions - so if you order it, make sure you share it.  There are 3 risottos on the menu, the seasonal vegetable one is the better one. Some of the pastas were portioned differently, some were huge, others were tiny - so be careful!  The food came out really fast after we ordered, so fast, that some of the food was cold (not sure if they make it in advance and just heat up afterwards). The desserts took forever to come.  At the end of the night when the bill came, there was a water service charge ($12.50) for 9 people for just getting tap water. And 18% gratuity after taxes.  Atmosphere was good, but other than that I do not recommend this place at all."}
{"text":"I wasn't sure what to expect from this place after looking at all the mixed reviews. My boyfriend and I love Italian food, and we also love Yorkville.  The location is great - right beside a parking garage, atmosphere is pretty nice, the bar is a little small, and our serving was excellent.  If you are looking for a place to go for a regular dinner, meet with friend, drink some wine - I'd say check it out. If you want a fabulous dinner, I probably wouldn't go here...i.e. not a first-date restaurant.  The food was nothing special. It was alright. We started with an apatizer - a slate with cheese, olives, grapes, and meat. It was okay. My boyfriend had gnocci and said it sucked. It was al-dente: and being an Italian, I trust his judgement. Apparently it's supposed to melt in your mouth and be nice and soft. His was too hard, and he didn't love it. I had a bite, I thought it was alright. I had the caprese pizza (HUGE!!!!) . It was alright. Nothing special other than the fact that it was ginormous,  Wine selection is really good.   Everything about this place is okay - it not amazing, and its not horrible."}
{"text":"So, lunch went like this:  Appetizer: Minestrone soup that tasted like it came out of a can. Bowl wasn't even filled.  Main: Pizza was dry-crusted and lacklustre. Not like a pleasantly crisp, toasted to perfection cracker either. Just dry and dull. Very skimpy on the toppings (vegetables).  Dessert: Cannoli that were sitting filled all day. The filling had a dried surface and the shell was soggy. I actually sent it back and was presented with acceptable cannoli.  The server was nice, but seemed clueless about the food. She might have been new, but what does that say about the training? The service was also quite slow. Seems like this is an isolated bad experience, but yikes."}
{"text":"Food - 3.7/5 : We had the Summerlicious menu. Nice plating, generous portion, and good taste.  Value- 4.5/5 : $15 lunch Summerlicious menu was an excellent value.  Ambience - 4/5 :Modern and clean.   Service - 2/5 : Not sure whether the waitress was discriminating against people who order Summerlicious (plus against people who don't order wines), but she has never refilled our water without us asking her first (twice). She took our plates without asking us whether we were finished with our plates (twice - both times, we were actually still working on them). Total of $33.90 for two Summerlicious lunch was the bill (again, great value). I put a $50 dollar bill and waited for the waitress. Here is the conversation:  Waitress (Alexandra): Do you need change?  Me: Umm,, yes please. (what do you think? Do you think I will tip 50%  after ordering Summerlicious??)  Waitress: How much do you want back?   Me: Um.... (???)  Waitress: Do you want the exact change back??  Me: Yes please.  Waitress: Or you can just tell me how much you need back.  Me: Um... OK. Let's see,, you can give me $12 back (I decided not to tip her well due to her abrupt and aggressive way of asking for tip).   Waitress: Oh OK. But I have to give you with lots of changes. Is that still OK?   Me: Um... sure (what other options do I have? Not getting the change back??)   Waitress: Oh Ok. Here is two, four, six, eight, ten, eleven and twelve.  Me: Thanks.  Waitress: Yep.   On the other hand, the gentleman who served us the pizza was very professional and friendly (I think he might be the owner).    -----------  As a whole, even though I really liked the food, the value and the ambience of this place, I am not sure I would go back anytime soon due to the serivce and aggressive attitude of the waitress (Alexandra).   PS: Look, if you are going to discriminate against people who go there for the Summerlicious deal without ordering drinks, why don't you just write a note on the menu saying \"If you order the Summerlicious menu, you better add a drink to it.\" Or even easier, just don't participate in the Summerlicious. My two cents.   Nick."}
{"text":"Service was horrible, we had 3 different people that came to us and weren't attentive as they only showed up once. We asked for bread but the waiter did not return, after paying and giving an undeserved tip, waitress threw the receipt on the table and stormed off without saying anything! You're welcome!   Food was extremely salty and oily and our table was still hungry afterwards. Was excited to try this place in yorkville but we would never come back here again. Could have gotten better food and service at Tim Hortons."}
{"text":"The first couple times I came here were in small parties of two to three for lunch, I remember the fusili with chicken being creamy and flavourful. Sitting on the patio during summer and eating good Italian food in Yorkville was a nice scene :)   The most recent time I came here was this winter for a work dinner.  Lots of drinks and food were ordered, but our experience was dampened a little bit by the waitress who gave us sass for no apparent reason, errr  Onto the fooooood.    Polenta fries - (basically cornmeal fries) pretty good with the goronzola dip, very appetizing starter that's a decent size.  Each fry is like two of my fingers...   Grilled portebello, oyster + cremini mushrooms with extra virgin olive oil, balsamic vinegar - it's just mushroom.  But it's very tasty mushroom.  Time to try making some with VOO and balsamic...  Bruschetta with seasonal tomatoes, basil, black olives, and mozzarella - MUCH YUMS.  Crispy and flavourful with the perfect combination of ingredients, and I had a piece too many...  Proscuitto, hot salami, Italiann cheeses, etc - Standard charcuterie, not much to comment except it was good :)    For my actual starter.. I had an arugula salad with prosciutto and shaved parmesan and red wine vinegar.  It was alright.. I liked the proscuitto a lot, arugula is just another green to me, and the parmesan didn't stand out.  Meh, save your money on this one.  ...At this point, I was ready to go home.. two drinks and all those starters later, my main of the chianti braised short ribs really weren't looking good.  When it finally came, I was hoping there would be an explosion of flavour that would miraculously give me a new stomach to devour this dish with.  Unfortunately, the flavour just wasn't there.  The texture was great; tender, falls off the bones,.. the mash on the side tasted great.. but the meat itself.  Blandness.  One of the pricier items among the mains as well.. not very impressed, finished 1/2 of the meat only.  However, this could very well be due to the overload of drinks and food we had during our starters.  But I should've stuck to pasta or the thin-crust pizza instead of the ribs at an Italian restaurant.  For dessert, we shared the nutella pizza.  It was my diabetes dream coming true, carbs with nutella.  Even with how full I was at that point and the impending food coma, I still had one full slice.  It was absolutely delicious with the banana bits and nutella generously slathered over the slice of thin-crust pizza dough.  Definitely to be shared with a party of 5+, however... you don't actually want your blood sugar to spike after a meal at this resto   All in all, good ambiance, good food, and a waitress with sass to spare.  I would come back again"}
{"text":"I came here for a private event recently. The basement offers a large space that is great for large groups (~50 people), with coat check, long tables for people to stand around and mingle, and more cozy round booths. The basement sort of feels like you're in the crypt of an old church in Italy. They had some antipasti, as well as some delicious, thin crust pizza (I had a slice of the Napoli which was simple, fresh, and light). Everyone seemed to gravitate to the bar area, of course. Since this was a special event and it was open bar, there were only 4 wines to choose from, but the bartender was very knowledgeable and willing to advise. I went with an Italian Pinot Grigio which was nice, not too strong. This would be a great place to come with a group. I'll have to visit the patio and try more of the food next time -- the polenta fries sound amazing!"}
{"text":"I came here with a friend, it was a first for me and was pretty enjoyable.  The wine list was lovely and the food not bad.  I had a glass of pinto gris and the carbonara.  The wine was great however the carbonara was alright...I've had much better but it was still edible.   What I loved most was the atmosphere both upstairs and downstairs.  I would love to throw an event here as the space really lends to it being sexy and sophisticated while not being too pretentious.  I can see myself becoming a regular whenever I stop in Yorkville."}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times now and always enjoyed myself First i came here with my boyfriend; we shared the cheese plate, which was very tasty; he had the seafood risotto and I had pasta (i dont remember which one); overall very tasty and the prices are quite affordable when considering they r in yorkville i also enjoyed the fresh bread and olives they bring out i've also had the pizza here; very nice thin crust, lots of flavour and quite cheesy; my friend and i both enjoyed it i've also tried one of the argula salads I think (one with blue cheese and pine nuts); lots of big chunks of blue cheese, interesting dressing; not over dressed, which I appreciate i've also had the ravioli (fresh ravioli with ricotta) they were a tad salty but I still enjoyed it overall the atmosphere is great, relaxed and they have 2 patios, which are great for summer! I really do enjoy this place and actually eat here almost any time I visit Yorkville!"}
{"text":"you had me at wine.   I love wine bars and have been eyeing this place for ages and finally went tonight. I can't say im disappointed, with anything. the interior decor and ambiance was beautiful. Trendy, dark, casting off an overall cool vibe. Staff was great. My friend and i both ordered without realizing their 'tuesday special' of whole lobster over linguini. They were kind enough to switch both our orders without any hassel or fuss.   As for the lobster itself, well, how can you go wrong with lobster?"}
{"text":"This place is a great little discovery in the heart of Yorkville, has a lovely little patio outside and the decor inside is quite pleasant. Came here recently because my girlfriend had her rehearsal wedding dinner at this location and I was very glad we came.  Definitely try their Penne a la vodka for your main and chocolate bombe for dessert! We did a family sharing type of serving since there were three booths full of us, approximately 30 persons, so they came around with big plate servings of each thing and it was alot of food - so much that there was plenty for many of us to take home for leftovers. The staff was pretty friendly and accommodating too, would definitely stop by again!"}
{"text":"I would give this restaurant 4 stars (great atmosphere, excellent wine recommendation, delicious food- yummy pesto pasta and spicy salami pizza) but I got the feeling they were rushing us out the door. Being that this was a date we did spend some time talking and having some wine before finally deciding what we wanted. We ordered a salad to start and a couple entrees. Bread was brought out and then not long after everything else was brought out together. Our tiny table looked like a buffet. We both were surprised when they placed everything down and shimmied water and wine glasses around to  get everything to fit and then left. In hindsight we should've spoken up and asked to just eat our salad first with out moving around various dishes and plates but we didn't. So great restaurant, poor timing on bringing food out. I've waitressed in the past and I would have never brought out a couple's appetizer with their entrees, our waitress seemed very professional and so I feel like this was a purpose move to rush us out than a rookie waitress mistake."}
{"text":"Ciao is a fantastic restaurant both in the summer on their patio and indoors during the winter. They have great appetizers and mains. We ordered the lobster ravioli, tuna carpaccio, deep fried zuccini and artichoke which was our favorite app, and the fried polenta. For mains, I ordered the Crispy trout - delicious although huge! They had a great Chianti on the menu for $51 that I'd recommend (see photo for winery name).   I've taken clients here and dined with friends for birthday parties and reunions. It is located right across from ONE Restaurant so if you want to grab drinks after, their bar will be open although Ciao has a great bar as well located to the right of the entrance."}
{"text":"Given the texture and tenacity of the steak I ordered here, I would have rather eaten the leather at the Fendi store. The charcuterie was great, however."}
{"text":"LOVE IT!!!!  Came here on a Thursday night with the besty and thank God I made reservations as the place was already packed.  We shared the rare beef app with two glasses of wine each. I forgot the name of my red wine of choice, but it tasted heavenly. It better have at the price of $14 for the 6. The bread that was served was cold and hard so we didn`t bother touching it.  Our server was so helpful, polite and uber happy (not in the MDMA `I`m in the your face`happy kind) but her perky attitude rubbed off on us. We were on a time schedule as my besty had work later in the evening so we asked if it was ok to serve us 2 glasses of vino each right away(AA represent, oh my!) and she came back with our drinks shouting out loud that she `accidentally rang in our orders twice and she apologizes for the HUGE mistake`!!! Ppl looked at her funny but she ended up with a 40% tip from the both of us. Good service = CHACHING!!!!   Will be back to try their food very soon!  CiAO"}
{"text":"Amazing place. Went their for a friends birthday. Service was sharp and quick. Food was excellent. Choices from menu were plenty. Wine lovers will enjoy the selection of wine they have.  Certainly on the more expensive side, but worth it. Possible other downside may be lack of options in the dessert menu. But overall, had a great experience."}
{"text":"I like Ciao... but I don't love it.   I went to Ciao with an experienced, Ciao loving friend, to get her insights. It was empty. She mentioned that it is usually empty, and she's not sure how it's staying open.. though I suspect it's because it's owned by Liberty, so they can afford to lose some cash on the restaurant.  The atmosphere is really nice - i love all the wood decor, and other elements that made it unique - though the mushroom-esque light fixtures were a bit crazy for me.   The servers were friendly, though they could have been more prompt, and our server made some great suggestions on the dinner menu, which we took him up on. We both ended up having one of their \"home-made\" pastas, a gnocchi and the ravioli. Both dishes were good, and though the portions aren't huge (fine by me) the sauces are a bit too rich and really fill you up.  I wish I had loved Ciao - but there is something holding me back. It might be their menu, which was good but didn't really have any light items - it might have been the atmosphere - I'm not quite sure.   Either way, it is worth checking out - lots of people love it (I am an exception!) and it could be great for a date night."}
{"text":"One of my favourite spots in Toronto for a bottle of wine and a good meal...The atmosphere is warm, at  times it can feel a bit crowded when busy but still a great place to take a date or have a business dinner.   Been going for years and will continue to do so."}
{"text":"Likes -A quick and personable service  -A good selection of Italian food and wine  -Special dinners like Lobster Linguini on the day I was there -Nice interior: lots of space between tables and booths; easy flow of traffic  Dislikes (Disappointments) -Interior not all that fancy as some people say it is"}
{"text":"I've actually had the pleasure of dining here twice.  Very impressed with the menu options and nice gluten free pasta available.  The ambiance is probably my favorite part."}
{"text":"I'm not a frequent Summerlicious diner but I thought I'd make an exception when a friend wanted to meet up for lunch at Ciao.  We were able to make very last minute reservations and were pleasantly surprised when offered a table for 2 on their sidewalk patio.    First impressions - Ciao is sleek looking, definitely fits in with the rest of Yorkville restaurants.  Lots of seating available in the form of booths and tables.  Tasteful modern design.  Our server was quick to drop off menus and take drink orders.  I went with a limonada ($2.50).   From the Summerlicous menu, I chose the Caesar salad, the Capricciosa Pizza, and the tiramisu dessert. ($15 prix fixe menu).  My lunch date chose the same salad, the penne entree and the chocolate buddino.  We got a small loaf of warm bread and some spiced pitted olives, which were a really nice start.  Salads came quickly after...decent salad, nothing special though.  My pizza was massive and loaded with toppings (ham, mushrooms, artichokes, olives).  The portion size was massive...I had 3/4 of the pizza leftover for another meal.    The penne, on the other hand, was a bit plain.  The description mentioned that it would have pancetta but we didn't see any in there.  It was just pasta in pink cream sauce.  With my large sized pizza, I barely had any room left for the tiramisu.  I had a few bites to try and it was good, as was the chocolate buddino.  I saw the third dessert option go by which was the vanilla panna cotta and it looked good as well.  Service was friendly and prompt.  We were in and out in about an hour which is good timing for a weekday lunch.  We had a really great lunch and Summerlicious experience which is a nice change.  It's nice to know that there is a good option in Yorkville if anyone should suggest meeting up in that area again and I would gladly come back for their regular menu."}
{"text":"Ciao WIne Bar presents one of those rare cases where I'm glad I visited before I yelped.    Had I done my due diligence, I would have seen that Ciao is listed under the Nightlife section, which to me always reads 'club', which in my lexicon means 1) loudy food. 2) douchebags. I like to eat and no matter what some might think, I'm not a douchebag, so I would most likely have said Ciao to Ciao.  Thankfully, I ventured forth heedlessly.   Ciao is a huge room that once housed Movenpick, and later Flow, a hideous chimera of nightclub and restaurant. Signs of these past lives have been scrubbed away, leaving a comfortable space of blond wood and exposed brick. Chairs are comfy, elbows are planted firmly on tables. Split levels break up the space and foster intimacy. Too bad about the underpowered air conditioner, which makes the place a steambath on hot summer nights; otherwise with it's view of the Hazelton Hotel, it's a perfect spot to watch people or celebrities.   The menu changes with the season.   Antipasto are fun, especially when spiked with viciously hot chili peppers submerged in good olive oil (also suitable for wolfing down pre-meal focaccia that arrives, warm, at our table). Baked eggplant is a pillow-light update on bricks of old school parm. Melted bocconcini melds with brightly acidic tomato sauce. The eggplant intself has that silky sweet texture that comes with proper cooking. An order of fried zucchini flowers stuffed with ricotta contrasts on all levels; shattering crisp and delicate. These two apps would make a suitable meal on their own.   An order of calamari is faultlessly fried, but unexciting. Caesar salad may damage the reviewer's Italian food credibility, but on an evening spent in search of comfort food, it fits the bill; bracing garlic, tart lemon and strong parmigiano cling to each leaf. It's a salad. Not a soup, if you get my drift.   Pastas include ravioli in pink sauce; a large portion of cheese-stuffed pasta drowned in delicious sauce. If there had been any bread left, it would have been used to sop up the condimento. Instead we just polish it off with a spoon. The filling is nice, but the draw is the tissue-thin pasta itself. Lasagna is surprisingly less successful. It tastes stodgy. Spaghetti carbonara redeems; egg and cheese and bacon and onion and black pepper swirl amidst al dente pasta. It is rich enough that you're probably better off just ordering a half portion as an appetizer. It's too much for one as a main, and I've no idea how to reheat this without turning it into spaghetti quiche.   A daily special veal chop may be the best I've had in a resturant. A first rate cut, it's pounded flattish, breaded and served on the bone. If a rib steak made sweet sweet love to a veal cutlet, it's tasty mutant offspring would be what graced my plate. Sided with competent veg and the occasional potato, it disappears suspiciously fast.   Pizzas are comparable to mercatto, terroni and the like, and cost about the same. They may be a bit larger, more bubbly and charred, but not enough to warrant further discussion. If there's sausage and gorgonzola on offer, I'm a happy camper.   Sweets vary from traditional cannoli, tiramisu, gelato and semi-freddo, to more esoteric choices. Keep it simple and you'll be fine. Canolli are light and crispy; lightly sweetened ricotta and the occasional nub of candied fruit send you home happily. A trio of ice creams includes chucnky-terxtured pale green pistachio, and two fancy flavours that have no place at my table.   Espresso-based beverages are pleasant. Coffee is strong and refilled upon request. Tea arrives i those cute 1970 glass beakers that burn one's fingers. It's a delightful end to a meal if you like hearing your parents swear.   Service is provided by an assortment of cleaned-up hipsters and moonlighting personal trainers. It's attentive, unless somebody pulls up in a really flashy car. But then, your eyes will follow along with everyobody else's, won't they?"}
{"text":"I also went to Ciao during Winterlicious a few months ago for the $15 set lunch menu.  The food was absolutely fantastic and we were given generous portions for a $15 set menu. I had a mixed greens salad as a starter, a quattro stagioni pizza for a main and cannoli siciliani for dessert. All were delicious. The pizza is big enough to fill you up, no real need for a starter if you are just popping in for lunch.  The service was great too, but my favourite part about this place is the decor - it's a real swanky looking place!  Will likely go back soon to investigate further, but so far, seems A+"}
{"text":"Been here a few times now Food is always good, reasonable prices for yorkville.   There are always people here which is nice. Really big restaurant.  They have lots of salad options, gets confusing but they're all tastey!"}
{"text":"This place is incredible. We booked our rehearsal dinner here a few weeks back based on a previous experience we had had here for a friends bday.   The service was incredible, the food beyond amazing and the portions were insane. They were kind enough to box up leftovers for us which served us well the next day before the wedding. Some of my favorites were the pizza, mussels, vodka penne and the pesto spaghetti OMG.... i unfortunately have a gluten allergy so after a few bites i started to feel a bit woozy and couldnt have any dessert. Though from all the guests i heard that the chocolate bombe was litterally out of this world. Wish i had taken some home!   One thing that i wanted to mention... at the end of the night one of my bridal party accidentally lost her phone behind the cushion. It became mission impossible trying to get this phone out.  THe staff were beyond incredible...they use plyers, brooms, scotch tape,...masking tape... everything you could imagine to get this phone out. It took them 1.5 hours of waving an ipod flashlight and using crazy contraptions and 1 server's tiny hand to get the phone out. I honestly couldnt believe how much time they took into trying to get the phone out. Thank you guys so much on behalf of myself, my husband and the owner of the phone.   We will definately come back and im definately going to have that chocolate bombe."}
{"text":"SO GOOD. Funghi appetizer, ravioli main (pasta is made fresh daily) + glass of rose+ friends+ friendly service= perfection. Super cute/romantic atmosphere. Come here if you're trying to impress on a first date. Come here if you're like me and enjoy wining and dining with good friends. Coming back."}
{"text":"I discovered this place during my very first time in Canada. It was quite a nice time: the service was very good and the was food on the same level: great wine, great polenta, tasty tuna carpaccio. Plus, I found the interior design very appealing. There's no doubt I would return to the place if I had the occasion."}
{"text":"This was my second visit. The first time was decent, but after a second time I doubt I'll be back. The vibe and venue are great (usually quite busy). The service is good - we had a really sweet waitress especially the second time - but its just not enough with all the options in this city.    The food was a big disappointment, especially after an unacceptable wait. The seafood pasta was basically dry noodles with a few overcooked mussels and shrimp on it. The calamari was crunchy.   Go for some drinks and enjoy the vibe, but skip the dinner."}
{"text":"Tried this for summerlicious. Complimentary bread was nice. My entree was the chicken, and found it very bland. My friend had the pizza and enjoyed it a lot more. Appetizer and dessert were good, just disappointed by the chicken. Staff is friendly and attentive. Food came out fairly quickly, dessert took forever."}
{"text":"Went there 3 times. First time was not a good experience. They seated us by the kitchen so it was very loud. Couldn't have a conversation.   Second time: Went there with one of my girlfriends. Again, we were seated by the kitchen. The restaurant was not very busy. When I asked to be moved, we weren't moved. Their reasoning was that tables were reserved for others. Ok. Sure.  Third time: Well I wanted to give it a fair chance so I went there for the third time. Same seat. I'm wondering if they just did that to me or others as well.   All three times service was slow. Food was not that great. For an Italian restaurant, food was very Americanized. If that is a word.   Not very happy. Will not go back. But at least I gave it a shot. Three times."}
{"text":"You know those places where the waitress thinks she's too pretty to be serving you...?? yeah, that kind of place.  And the food is not that good either... I went for their home-made pasta and it was disappointing."}
{"text":"Came here for summerlicious yesterday. Had the caprese salad as an app which was good. Had the Italian club as a main which was good too but the side salad was very salty. Had the cannoli for dessert which was not good. Reason why I won't go back again? The finger nail clippings found on the table and chair. Utterly disgusting."}
{"text":"Half price drinks on Thursdays until 7.  Not sure I would go back outside of that.  The experience good but very familiar - the kind that soon bleeds into others.   As positives,  they do make their pastas fresh each day each day and have excellent  bread that precedes the meal."}
{"text":"I don't think anyone can love Ciao as much as I do. I can honestly say I've tasted almost everything on their menu.   If you want my suggestions I'll name a few. Mozzarella di bufala - enough said. You just need to trust me on this one. Baked eggplant - if you don't like eggplant really you should give this a try. It's almost like a lasagna but it's not. It's pretty much amazing. If salad is more your thing then give the radicchio and endive salad a try. As far a pizza goes to Gorgonzola is where it's at. If you love cheese and sharp cheeses you'll love this one. Pasta lovers.. try the Fettuccine with porcini mushrooms. Really I could go on and on but you'll just have to trust me and believe that EVERYTHING is amazing on this menu.   Obviously, besides the food the wine selection is key here. Every server I've had at Ciao has been very knowledgeable on their wines and if you want them to recommend a glass/bottle they are spot on in their choices.   The summerlicious and winterlicious deals are great too at Ciao but I would suggest that you don't wait that long to try it if you haven't gone yet.   The atmosphere is great with the open face brick walls in the basement to the large booths and tables, to their private larger party rooms. You won't be disappointed. In the summer sitting on the patio is great too. You can people watch, catch some sun (or stay in the shade if you like) and enjoy great food and drinks.   I would suggest you make a reservation if you do try Ciao just to secure a table for your arrival.   The bathrooms are also kept clean so no need to worry about that.   Also as far as parking goes if you find street parking great, or you can park next door in the green p parking garage."}
{"text":"THE. WORST.  The worst!  Worst restaurant I've been to in Toronto as a native.  Absolutely terrible.  Why?  The food is bad.  I could get better food at any of the big chains (Moxie's, The Keg, Alice Fazooli's, Milestones, etc.) for a similar price.  But some of the dishes are absolutely terrible.  I ordered a penne alla vodka that tasted like canned tomato soup.  Terrible.  Another time (I didn't want to come back but a friend had their birthday dinner here) I ordered a pesto linguini that was very heavy, greasy, and bland.  Their polenta fries were also mushy, greasy, and bland.  The pizza was a salty, soggy, burnt mess.  Just no.   But what brings their place from bad to terrible is the awful, awful service.  It is consistently horrible.  Every single time - I've been here 3 times (ETA: twice because of birthday parties and only once voluntarily).  The servers are always inattentive, they don't take your order down properly, they get them wrong, they are unapologetic, it takes 15+ minutes to flag them down if you need something, and they just don't care about giving you a good experience.   On my first visit, we asked for parmesan cheese for our pasta and they were utterly bemused, as if our table invented putting shaved parm on pasta.  \"You want what?  For the pasta?!  Really??? *looks at you like you have 4 breasts* Um...ok.  We'll see what we can do.\"  Then they came back with a plate of three long slices of parm on a plate - not what we wanted and not enough to share.  I wondered if we were on the same planet.  The next two times I went, I saw that they had bottles of \"parmesan cheese\" on the tables...but it's the cardboard-tasting crap you should not get from Kraft at the supermarket.  Seriously.  Italian restaurants should offer freshly-shaved parmiggiano-reggiano for your food as an absolutely basic item!    The last time I went (meaning the previous AND the last time I will visit this place), we asked to split the bill.  They absolutely refused.  Just will not do it.  They had the manager come out to tell us off and to insist under no uncertain terms they absolutely refuse to.  Plus they tacked on a mandatory gratuity that, while I understand is standard for parties of 6+ in most restaurants, I felt was absolutely undeserved.   Spend your money elsewhere!!!"}
{"text":"Location: Yorkville Ave, Toronto, Items Ordered: White Wine Sangria ($10) + Bruchetta ($8) + Deep Fried Zucchini+Artichokes with Roasted Red Pepper Aioli and Lemon Lime Aioli ($13) + Orecchiette with Rapini, Spicy Italian Sausage, Fontina, Parmigiano, Garlic, Extra-Virgin Olive Oil ($20) + Fusilli with Chicken + Mushrooms in a light Cream Sauce ($20) and much more that I did not try.   I have been here a few times including this past Saturday and I just realized how spacious the resto actually is. Usually my company and I grab a seat on the patio and never venture inside. However, this time my party of 6 wanted to sit indoors.  We were seated right away, without reservations, which was great because our hunger had grown to an unattractive size at 8:30pm on a Saturday.    We got a sexy little booth on the lower level and admired the rustic ambiance.  I started off with a white wine sangria- nothing special, wouldn't order it again. After a long wait, or maybe what seemed much longer because we were ravenous, our deep fried zucchini and artichokes arrived along with the bruschetta. I found the deep fried apps to be too salty. The bruschetta had an overpowering garlicky taste and not much else. Then came the bread for the table, AFTER the apps. The free bread was delicious and warm.   For dinner I had orecchiette with rapini, spicy Italian sausage, fontina, parmigiano, garlic, extra-virgin olive oil. Sounds good right? It was, although one of the ravenous ladies ordered the same dish with a splash of tomato sauce, which I found was the way to go, as it added a punch of more flavour. However, once I tried my neighbour's dish; chicken and mushrooms fusilli in a light cream sauce, I wanted that! I picked at my neighbour's food for the rest of the evening.   Overall, the portion sizes were huge, service was good, not great and the waiter was cute.   I am wanting to try their brunch deal which is on now; $35/pp for a bottle of Italian bubbly and a 2 course meal. Stay tuned..."}
{"text":"Too busy, food was late, food was tasteless (chicken pesto pasta and mushroom Risotto), not so polite waitresses and had to wait quite a while to get more drinks. Overall a disappointment.   Will not waste time going there again."}
{"text":"Price fix lunch for $15 but could be so much more.  Chose the eggplant (also available is salad or soup) spagetti with bolognese (or al la vodka) and the cheese cake (ice cream or cannnna). Wash it down with a Peroni.   Well priced, good portions and solid food.  I've heard and read mixed reviews and lunch proved a safe choice to try it out.   The patrons were local and well dressed business people or hipsters in for a bite. The music was at a very reasonable volume so we could hear ourselves chat.   Certainly good for lunch, I guess I'll try dinner."}
{"text":"I came in on a Tuesday evening around 6:30pm and the place was starting to fill up.....a good sign indeed. The vibe here felt great and decor here is simply gorgeous! Rustic wood floors, butcher block tables, candle light, heated patio, stone walls, and dimming lights while you dine, make it the perfect setting for a romantic night out!  Our waitress for the evening was sweet and attentive and informed us of the nightly special.   Love the fresh rosemary bread & black olives they bring over with the peppers in oil + balsamic & olive oil  To start  Polenta Fries w/ Gorgonzola dip Golden brown, beautifully stacked, the creamy dip is delicious plus it also came with a side of marinara which I also enjoyed  Plopettine mini meatballs w/tomato sauce Juicy & plump in a flavorful sauce with cloves of roasted garlic and charred bread on the side is another winner  Main  Pollo Pizza Stone baked pizza with tomato, mozzarella, grilled chicken, and pancetta Generous strips of pancetta are coiled on the pizza with slices of tender chicken, perfectly thin and crisp crust and you can definitely taste that wood fire.  Dessert  Chocolate Budino with roasted hazelnuts Creamy chocolatey hazlenutty ball of mousse coated in milk chocolate topped with roasted hazlenuts and hidden in the center on a delicious crispy flaky oat crust was the perfect finish to an amazing meal  Ambiance, Service, and Food is all around great! Portion sizes are large and food comes out at a great pace, we never once felt rushed or neglected (pizza came after we finished our appetizers and tables were cleared) fresh, hot & delicious. A true reflection of the great options Yorkville has to offer."}
