{"text":"We had a great experience dining here. The food was affordable, delicious and authentic (we showed the menu a Peruvian friend for confirmation, who is a regular at their Chicago restaurant ). The atmosphere was very much Peruvian. The fish in particular was incredibly soft and fresh. It was a great success with our daughter who is a picky eater these days. We received fantastic service. Would definitely return and highly recommend."}
{"text":"Having a craving for Latin food, I thought I would give it a try. It was just ok. Chicken was ok. The Pisco was ok. The fried plantains were great.  The service was strained and seemed like this place has seen better days."}
{"text":"Best roasted chicken ever.    Plantains are just right too!  Service is always quick and friendly, great restaurant!"}
{"text":"As a peruvian I can say that Macchu Picchu in Pineville is the best and most authentic peruvian food in the Charlotte area, and I've tried the others. The atmosphere is unique and authentic, the food is great, the portions are generous and the staff is courteous. I keep going back for more."}
{"text":"Reasonable prices, nice atmosphere, out-of-this-world food. I was unfamiliar with most of the Peruvian dishes and ingredients, but you can't go wrong with this menu. The next time I'm in town I want to come back to this restaurant."}
{"text":"As a Peruvian living at Charlotte for 25 years, I had been and tasted many Peruvian restaurants in the area. Many are gone, some still around. Machu Picchu is one of the restaurants that had maintained the taste of peruvian cuisine. I would recommend for breakfast a large plate (for 2) that resembles a morning in Lurin. Their ceviche is fresh and tasteful with Peruvian corn. I also recommend the \"pescado frito \" with a bean portion. For desert many people ask for their alfajores, best in town! But If you wanna eat light, like I normally do go for anticuchos and picarones, which are my preferred dishes in the menu.  Prices are reasonable for Peruvian food and they have many very tasty dishes and great service."}
{"text":"When I heard the restaurant was moving I was disappointment not knowing it was moving close to where I live know. I was excited we had to go and grab some dinner.   The staff are so nice and they go to your table and see if everything is fine. We also had the owner approach us in the other location which for us was cool. This doesn't happen much in NYC where I come from.   When we go we try to change it up and not order the same food over and over. They have a big selection of Peruvian food. This is one of the best restaurant in the Charlotte area. I've try 2 Peruvian restaurants and is nothing compare to Machu Picchu. I recommended the staff from my kids school. They loved the place and they will go again.  Consider in trying to roasted chicken, lomo saltado, arroz chaufa, el seco, these are all very good tasty foods. If I'm not mistaken their menu is also in English so it will help."}
{"text":"Avoid, you can do much better!  This place is lacking in all areas - food quality was not good at all, restaurant was empty on a Saturday night, place is very outdated, and the prices of the menu far exceed the quality of food they serve.   My wife and I were optimistic as we love all types of Latin food, but we learned the hard way with an overall unpleasant dining experience on all fronts."}
{"text":"Everyone was nice, the service was a little slow. But the food was very very good. We are of Peruvian descent and live in a remote area, so anytime we come out to visit family, it's a must to find a Peruvian restaurant to eat.  We had the following:  *Appetizers-PAPA A LA HUANCAINA (yellow sauce with potatoes) ANTICUCHOS (grilled cow heart). *main dishes-LOMO (steak) SALTADO & POLLO (chicken) SALTADO (rice, onion, tomatoe and fries with a brown sauce) BISTEC ENCEBOLLADO (steak) *Desserts-ALFAJOR (cookie with dulce de leche filling powdered sugar) TRES LECHES (3 milk cake) FLAN *drink- Inca Cola (Coke product famous in Peru, a sweeter version of Mountain Dew as described by my husband)  Everything was excellent, my grandpa would be proud and loved to eat here too! When we are in the area again we will be enjoying the food again! The only reason we gave it a 4 out of 5 my pollo saltado didn't have the fries and the slower service."}
{"text":"This place is not worth your time or money. The appetizer was cold in the center. The staff heated in the microwave so at least it was hot. There was a lack of flavor across the meal. Don't waste your money here. I regret eating here and will never go back."}
{"text":"It was my first visit there and as soon as I walked in I loved the environment right away.  It was very clean and comfortable inside, also with great salsa music playing for the enjoyment to the ears.  I ordered shrimp ceviche and it was amazing.  The service was excellent as well.  I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"The lomo saltado was phenomenal.   The service was prompt, efficient and friendly.  I will do it again soon."}
{"text":"All i wanted was a table for two for the independence day of Peru (july 28) so knowing it would be busy, we called to make reservations and got a \"oh just come and we will seat you  itll be fine\" answer only to drive to the restaurant and be told that there was no more space and that nobody was leaving because of the show that they were going to have so they couldnt sit us... When on the phone they said it would be fine. Also saw an officer standing waiting for someone to place his take out order and one person asked if he had been helped which to he said no.. And was told that the hostess would attend him.. Which she didnt, and he ended up leaving.  i get that its a big event, but the people here obviously dont know what's going on around them while they're super busy"}
{"text":"Delicious tamal and spicy sweet sauce, served with pleasant smiles.  Wish I could afford to try the whole menu it looks delicious but it averages $12-15 a plate.  The staff was polite and aimed to please, will definitely head back to enjoy that exotic Peruvian cuisine!"}
{"text":"Ordered grill salmon.  Disappointed. Salmon is not fresh and over cooked and dry. Not worth the price even with Groupon."}
{"text":"I'm a huge lover of Ceviche and have tried it many times looking for something as good as I had on my honeymoon.  Their Ceviche de Mariscos is something I will wake up in the middle of the night craving, it is THAT good.  Can't wait to come back and I haven't even left yet..."}
{"text":"This was our first time at this restaurant.  We tried the Papa Rellena and boy was it great.  next we chose Tallarines Verdes Con Bisteck except I got it with chicken instead of steak which they had absolutely no problem with, My husband got Bisteck A Lo Pobre which he absolutely loved.  Mine was a wonderful taste of basil coated pasta that I could have eaten bowl after bowl.  We almost skipped dessert as we were both stuffed (and had extra for lunch tomorrow) but our WONDERFUL waitress Zuly convinced us to try Picarones.  Boy am I glad she did.  Who doesn't love fried dough but this was great.  We plan to go back and work our way through their menu.  As far as the staff -- I have read some of the reviews and from my experience EVERYONE was great.  I would recommend this for anyone who wants to try something new - it will become your new favorite place."}
{"text":"Best kept secret in Pineville!  Excellent, authentic, Peruvian food.  If you've never tried before... Have the Ceviche you will be instantly hooked!"}
{"text":"Wonderful food, wonderful service!  Big portions - A LOT of bang for your buck."}
{"text":"The food here was AWESOME! My wife and I popped in for lunch and just started ordering random stuff just so we could try it- everyone was great, including the sauces!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Drinks are good prices and well made, food was so fresh an yummy, service was so friendly and welcoming. Best food I have had in a while a chain restaurant has nothing on this place, Definitely coming. Back soon"}
{"text":"We were lucky to have found this little place while shopping in Pineville! Appetizers were fantastic. We ordered the corn and cheese as well as a papa something or other. Both were exceptional. Our meals were equally as delicious. Steak was well cooked. Chicken soup was perfectly seasoned. The desserts were also very good. Portion sizes are quite large! Other reviews state that the service is a bit slow- but to me that was fine- we didn't want to be rushed! And I'm not even sure I would say \"slow\".... More like casual and UN-hurried- which is exactly how things should be! The restaurant is clean and well maintained. Light Latin music playing- not too loud. TV's to watch sporting events and a bar available."}
{"text":"Food and rice cold nasty they dont know how to do dishes that good overly priced also never again me and my whole family went here was throwing up for week stay away trust me if i can give it 0 stars i would"}
{"text":"This edition of \"Excited about Eating\" takes us to Pineville to Machu Picchu, Peruvian Cuisine, named after the ancient Inca City near Cusco, Peru. Now I can truly say, I have never had Peruvian food, but I am always up for trying something new and my wife was in an adventurous mood. Dora here. Haha!   Just inside, we noticed pictures of some of the menu items on the wall and a picture page was included with the menu. This was especially helpful for us to understand the menu. Dora here. I noticed something else. The pungent aroma of seafood. And the interior is quite dim.  I chose the Arroz Con Mariscos which consisted of yellow rice cooked with an assortment of seafood, mixed vegetables and spices. This dish was very good, not too spicy but very moist and tasty, and packed with perfectly cooked seafood. It would have been great if they reduced the massive portion size and included one of the interesting side items from the menu like fried plantains or yucca.   Dora ordered Bisteck Apanado, lightly breaded deep-fried steak served with white rice and French fries. The star of this dish was the deep-fried steak, which had the right amount of breading, juicy, and so good. It was strange that this dish was served with both white rice and French fries. Dora here. This steak reminded me of Palomilla steak, my favorite dish from when we lived in Tampa. Tender and tasty, and I'd definitely order it again!    We opted for dessert instead of an appetizer this trip. At our waiter's recommendation, we chose Alfajores, two shortbread cookies with Dulce de leche in the middle sprinkled with powdered sugar. A nice way to end the meal, just the right amount of crunch and not sweet. The dessert case was full of them, so obviously they sell a bunch.   I would rate this establishment 4 forks out of 5 for a family friendly restaurant serving great food."}
{"text":"One side of my family is Peruvian, so I'm no stranger to this cuisine. After changes they've made during the past year or so, this place is by far my favorite for traditional Peruvian. Our party sampled several items, including roasted chicken, lomo saltado, maduros (plantains), and the best yucca (fried) I've had at any Peruvian restaurant anywhere. Try this place!"}
{"text":"Great service, delicious food. Wished this place was in the triad....must try!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went to eat there on April 4, and we had a terrible experience.  There was a sign on the door saying they needed a cook,  possibly that was part of the problem.    As soon as we were seated and given the menus,  a basket of what looked like chorros was put on the table with a bowl of sauce.  The chorros were cold and stale.    We ordered appetizers,  the tamal tasted good but had chicken bones in it.  The other appetizer was supposed to be Peruvian choclo (large kernaled corn) with feta cheese. They brought out unflavored corn and fresh cheese cut into cubes.   Next was the entree. My husband ordered tallarrin saltado with steak,  and it was deliciuos. My order was ceviche (fish), and what they brought was not ceviche. It was raw fish that smelled spoiled with no onions or cilantro or flavor. This was the first time in my life that I sent my plate back to the kitchen.  Maybe if they find another cook it will get better,  but we are not planning to ever return to this restaurant."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of Peruvian ceviche and so far this is the only place I've come across in Charlotte that has it. While it doesn't quite compare to the adventurous takes on ceviche that I'd find in a Miami restaurant, they have the basics down solid & it more than satisfies my cravings. If you've never tried ceviche, the idea of it might put you off but it's well worth trying & sharing. The Papa a la Huancaina (potatoes with a cheese sauce) appetizer is another simple yet tasty dish - also a great vegetarian choice."}
{"text":"The service was very slow. The food was not good, and I love Peruvian food.   They would not take my Groupon, they said I used it (I purchased right before going).   They said you needed to call Groupon about this.    Do not waste your money or time with this place."}
{"text":"Just OK.  We wanted to really like this place.  There is a Machu Picchu in Raleigh that we love but they are not affiliated with one another.  We arrived for a late lunch about 3:00.  We tried a soup, 2 entrees, 2 desserts.  The soup was a chicken broth, with noodles, a whole chicken breast and 2 hard boiled eggs in it.  Just OK, nothing special.  My husband's rottiserie chicken was somewhat dry.  I ordered the cerviche.  After I ordered the waitress came back to say there was no crab, calamari or octopus in the cerviche (as stated on the menu) they only had shrimp and fish. We may go back to give it a second try but for our first visit, it was OK."}
{"text":"More authentic than viva. Enjoyed everything we tried and the sauces are all excellent. The live music was enjoyable as well on a Friday night.   Ordered the corn tamale with chicken.  Shredded chicken with yellow sauce.  Fried white fish with yucca.   Will go back!"}
{"text":"We had a very nice conversation and excellent fish, plantain, hot sauce and mild yellow sauce and everything was great. Our server was Josselyn and we will be back  Good place for a wedding or birthday. Excellent TV screens. Family Friendly."}
{"text":"The food might be good but the wait time is atrocious, no one checks on you to see how many people are in your party when you walk in. I have literary been standing here for 25 minutes and the hostess has not acknowledged me. Horrible, when I told the host that no one had talked to me in 30 minutes he rolled his eyes! Hire more people or train your hostess better."}
{"text":"Worst. Food. Ever.  It's very sad because I really wanted to find a great little gem of a restaurant. The management tries very hard to make up for the lack of customers by overcharging for the Worst. Food. Ever.  My recommendation is to go to any other restaurant on the planet.  You're welcome!"}
{"text":"a real poppin' spot!!!  I felt  like a Conquistador   as i plowed  thru the appetizers.  The fries were so perfectly stacked  I couldn't  fit a knife blade between them!"}
{"text":"We had the 'seco de res' (beef stew in cilantro sauce) and it was tender and delicious.  The \"papa a la huancaina\" (potatoes in cheese/yellow sauce) was disappointing, and the Pollo a la Brasa, was decent and we got a nice portion.    The service was friendly; the place a little bit dark but they were playing some nice Spanish/latin music (not too loud).  The Inka Cola is the best, but that is an acquired taste for some.  We took the Alfajor home and my husband enjoyed it with a cup of coffee (it was fresh and yummy).  Will definitely return."}
{"text":"This is my first time eating here & we had tropical ceviche with mango & lomo saltado beef. The citrus & fruit of the ceviche brought out the cilantro in the fish. So if you like sushi you will like ceviche in that it's the same texture though different flavors. I liked the traditional corn served with it too. The sangria was sweet & fruity just what I wanted. Service was good and though the music was a little loud, the food was worth eating here again."}
{"text":"Surprised!  I did not have a high expectation in going into this restaurant, was pleasantly surprised. The portions were of good size and really tasty. Recently visited Equator and found a liking for the food. This was as good as some of the better latin restaurants."}
{"text":"This place is wonderful! So far everything I've tried has been tasty!!!!!!  I give 3 stars ONLY because of service.  What a shame.  The service was not up to par whatsoever.   LONG wait until seated and then our server didn't check on us at all. In fact, we had to bother another waitress 3 times in order to get the attention of our own.   The food price wise?  A TAD bit overpriced. 70 bucks for 2 cocktails, 2 plates and an appetizer. Meh. Was tasty though.    Waiteress didn't refill our water when there wasn't a single drop left!  Besides that, food and beverages are a definite hit!  Maybe I'll order take out next time, or.... just be prepared to have a wait. I guess I'll decide when that day comes! :)"}
{"text":"Food was good, the ambiance could use some work. Service was good as well.  My husband had steak.  The sauce was a bit too salty for our taste.  I had a traditional peruvian dish which was chicken in a peanut butter based sauce with rice.  Very good!  We would definitely go back.  Solid hole in the wall."}
{"text":"Authentic. Great service. We even talked to the chef/owner & he is such a nice & genuine guy. We loved this place & my parents grew up in Peru so we have very high standards for Peruvian food. We loved the papas rellenas and the yucca was great! Lomo Saltado was delicious! We also ordered the aji de gallina & it was good but not like my moms :) The fried sweet bananas were to die for! If uou go, you have to get inca cola its a yellow soda & its so good! We will def be coming back & bring more people!"}
{"text":"We went on vacation to NC with family, the last day we decided to eat before we start driving back home , my God Thanks that at last moment we switch feom one restaurant to Macchu picchu Restaurant, Bwst decicion ever , excellent experience , we order a bit of everything and we couldn't complainwith anything, everything drinks,dinners,Apetizers,omg just GREATTTT.... The service was very good, thank you very much for attending us andrea and make us feel welcome.. we will be back soon"}
{"text":"Food was decent. I would not put chocolate on an alfajor. That ruined it. The food didn't have much flavor. The chicharon sandwich was plain and half of one side had no meat just fat. Arroz chaufa was good. Inka cola though . You always need one of those.  The food came out super fast that's why I gave it a 3."}
{"text":"We went there with a Groupon, we were really impressed, we had the stuffed potato with beef it was delicious, The portions were very generous and the food was pretty good, I will be going back again."}
{"text":"Love everything I have ever ordered here. I LOVE Peruvian food, my only complaint is how long the food takes to get to the table BUT its always nice and hot and delicious every time! Ceviche was good. Tallarin Saltado is my favorite and I love the free Yuca bread served before you eat. Also I ordered from here and had it delivered via Foodie Call and it was wrapped up so nothing would spill etc etc They are always on point. I AM SAD that they took my favorite soup (Sopa La Minuta) off the menu :("}
{"text":"I am freaking obsessed with this place! Every time my husband and I go there, we wonder why we haven't been back sooner. We tend to forget about it a little bit because it's nothing flashy, but the food never disappoints.  Chicken. On point. Beef. On fleek. Rice, beans, PLANTAINS? God, stop it.  So good.  My only disappointment was that I tried dessert and had what I thought was a tres leches cake and it didn't taste like what I thought it would? Maybe I'm used to an over sugarized Amercian version of it :)"}
{"text":"Great food, heavy (meat and carbs) but felt normal afterward.  Reasonable prices.  I tried two different Pisco sours though and they were not my thing.   Always happy to try new drinks though!"}
{"text":"Went on a first date here because Peruvian food sounded exciting! The plantains and the yucca are amazing to share, and the portions are generous as well. I personally ordered chicken and potatoes simmered in a yellow pepper sauce and served over white rice. Was absolutely delicious and I'll definitely be back for more.   Our waitress brought my date dark meat chicken when he asked for light, and she switched our food when serving us. Only reason this place didn't get 5 stars."}
{"text":"We enjoyed our meals here . Clean restaurant, delicious food and lots of great authentic Peruvian dishes to try out!"}
{"text":"This is for the delivery order. My partner been telling me that Peruvian food is the best, I have never tried Peruvian food, this is my first time trying Peruvian food!!!   We ordered calamari,rellena,1/2 chicken and arroz chafas.  Unfortunately they were out of the 1/2 chicken so we asked for 2 arroz chafas instead.  Calamari were ok,the breading is a little bit too greasy for me and it lacks of spices. it comes with 4 creamy dipping sauces , the fried yucca were really plain and dry,I'm not a fan.   The rellena is like a ground beef stuffed potato cake,my partner liked it. It's alright for me,because I'm not a fan of ground beef,but the flavor is there.  The arroz chafas is like fried rice dish, it comes with fried plantains too. It reminds me of thai fried rice, which it's a good thing, it is really delicious!!!! Nom !   I would totally recommend the arroz chafas! Probably skip the calamari and the fried yucca."}
{"text":"I should have gone with my instincts. As we entered the restaurant we were the only ones at 6:30pm.  I ordered some items to share with my wife and the wait time for the appetizers to come out took over 20 min. A huge pet peeve of mine is reheating food especially in a restaurant in a microwave. My tamale was just that heated in the microwave. When you start to eat it the tamale starts to break. Followed by the papa rellena which was mushy and watery fried potato. Then our entrees came out the chaufun chicken rice and fried seafood platter.  Rice was subpar and overly salty drenched with soy sauce and really no additional flavor to it. The seafood platter was over cooked and extremely chewy. Can't say I really enjoyed my meal. I should have just kept on driving past it. If you enjoy bland and over cooked food this is your place. I was really hoping this meal would have been better and it wasn't.  Wish I could turn back time and keep driving past this place."}
{"text":"I thought I had written a review about this place already, but I missed it. I was a fan of it when it was in independence (a not so nice area) It moved to Pineville and I still think its worth the trip, specially because the ceviche here is the best you will find in Charlotte. I do not like Genaro's cevhice I feel like they are tricking people on believing thats the actual ceviche.. and ITS NOT. Go to Machupicchu and you will taste the closest to our real ceviche. I love most of the dishes in Machu Picchu, my favorite are the pan de yucca (yums) and the sauces, ceviche and chaufa de mariscos.  I just wish they would open another restaurant close to uptown Charlotte (with this much variety of options)"}
{"text":"From 5 star friendliness to 2 star food, what a let down.  Looking to expand our culinary range we thought Machu Picchu might do the trick.  The menu seems extensive but in reality it is a lot of choices with many of the same players coming off the bench (so many carbs: rice, plantains, and fries).  Lori ordered the Jalea Single which is a lightly fried assortment of seafood and white fish served with a side of golden fried yucca, served with salsa criolla.  The white fish was moist and tasty but the rest was basically an overfried assortment of breaded shrimp and calamari straight from the freezer.  The yuca was hard as a brick.  Yuck-a.  My order of BISTEC A LO POBRE: \"A breakfast for kings\" was plentiful but the \"steak\" was merely a tough cut of cube steak that was nearly impossible to carve.  Again, the fries were straight from the freezer bag, and while good, I don't consider $14.95 a lunch bargain with such cheap products.  The winning ingredients were the side sauces and plantains which were excellent.  We decided to order their Mil Hojas dessert which looked enticing.  Described as \"puff pastry filled with dulce de leche\", we struggled to find the filling and basically suffered through a plate of crumbling phillo dough.  Bone dry and tasteless.   At this point we simply stopped ordering--it just kept getting worse.  The staff was wonderful, and the vibe of the place promising; however, I cannot give a recommendation.  Bummer."}
{"text":"The dishes were okay, not as flavorful as i was hoping for. I ordered Aji De Gallina and my husband had the lomo Saltado."}
{"text":"This is a good discovery from browsing Restaurant.com! A lot of selections in their menu. Had the shrimp in garlic sauce appetizer that's also served with yucca. So yummy, we finished to the last morsel and even scraped off the sauce. My hubby lives ceviche and he tried the fried ceviche...he loved it! There are a lot more varieties to try so we are definitely coming back. I had the tacu tacu with seafood. Really tasty! Finished it as well. For drinks, pisco sour, of course! A little pricey at 9 bucks, considering half of the glass was ice We had no more room for dessert but we shall return!!"}
{"text":"Very good ceviche! Try the leche de tigre! The service is very good and it isn't too expensive. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Zuly was a great waitress. After traveling to Peru for many years I am happy to find a place that serves legit ceviche and tiradito. Que Rico."}
{"text":"Yes!!  The food is so delicious, authentic,and cooked fresh. I got 1/2 a chicken with 2 sides which were fires and black beans... So much food, such a little stomach.  We also got an appetizer which was a stuffed fried potato. It was amazing !!   I only give 4 stars out of 5 because service was OK and the knives were very dull."}
{"text":"I visited the Machu Pichu on Independence Blvd. in Matthews (right beside Pizza Hut). It used to be Pisco y Canela; Machu Pichu just opened in this location 3/27/18 so it does not show up on Google. Anyway, my brother and wanted to try Peruvian rotisserie chicken so we found Machu Pichu. I will have to say it was delicious, moist with crispy skin and perfectly flavored. Also had yucca fries and canary beans. The beans were great but the yucca fries were out of this world - crispy outside and creamy inside. Not to go on and on but this place was terrific. I will definitely return and when I do I am going to come hungry and get the half chicken. The quarter that I had was good for lunch but I want more - the half chicken."}
{"text":"This restaurant has a nice setting, but that's about all you're going to get.  I went there with my girlfriend and son.  Ordered drinks, it took about 5-6 minutes for the drinks to come out, which seemed long considering that the place wasn't really busy at the time.    I ordered a coca-cola, got diet instead.  Sent it back and went with water.  Elsa grabbed a margarita, it was way too sweet.  It gave her a sugar rush instead of a buzz.    I ordered a milk for my little guy, that didn't come out at all, was then told they didn't have any. Ordered apple juice instead.  No big deal.  I ordered the bistek encebollado. 14.99.  This is why I'm giving 2 stars.  The steak was underwhelming. The meal is basically onions tomatos and rice.  Way overpriced for what it ended up being.   And that not considering how long it took for the food to come out.  Long story short,  this place is overpriced, and the service is slow.  They don't have a kids menu so heads up there as well.   Wouldn't recommend."}
{"text":"Cool place with lots of seating.  Service is very friendly but with a slight language barrier.   The menu is vast, but each dish has a narrative for newbies to Peruvian cuisine. Prices are in line with the product offered.    Delivery of food was well put together and very quick .  The Taste was spot on. Portions are just right.  Not too small, not to 'Murica.  Any fried food is light and not oily at all. Offered heat levels are accurate and not over the top. Definately will be back!"}
{"text":"There are a few times when your drink is expertly crafted! This was one restaurant that crafts the best \"pisco sour\" in town!  The restaurant was a humble looking Peruvian cuisine in south Charlotte. The interiors was amazing, you will be in awe seeing the huge machu pichu scenic picture on the walls! The tables were somewhat small for an average human. The menu felt like Authentic Peruvian with little or no Americanization. The waitress apologized she knows only Spanish and little English- but she was super helpful and we had fun communicating to her.   The dishes came in after a short wait. The quantity on the plates were barely enough! The fried fish and white rice tasted very bland and with onions side, you would wonder how to eat the food! Lucky we asked for sauces and got some smaller cups of three sauces ( more like the ones you get in Viva chicken). We finally left home wondering if our dinner was pleasant or not!    Would recommend trying here just for the pisco sour drink - haven't been impressed on the food yet!"}
{"text":"Eating here made me miss Miami big time. Saturday at lunch it was pretty busy with an all-Hispanic crowd (I think more Central American than Peruvian) with lots of kids eating chicken and french fries everywhere.  But I came for the Ceviche, and that's what I ordered. Ceviche mixto $14.50 (South Beach prices on S. Polk street?) medium spicy please  The traditional complimentary basket with fried  pan de Yuca was served quickly - if you're not familiar with it the best way I can describe it is like fried dough, like a sugarless beignet with yellow chili sauce to dip it in.    Bad start, the dough was chewy, greasy, lukewarm, old ... in a word awful - I didn't subtract a star because after all it's a freebie.  Ceviche is supposed to be as freshly made as possible, in fact the better restaurants prepare it only after you order. Here it had been sitting the fridge for days. The fish was mealy, the shrimp had the consistency of an overcooked limp noodle, the calamare and octopus was harder than leather, even the leaf of lettuce it was served on was the most wilted lettuce I've ever seen. Even the potatoes were old, I couldn't even recognize the taste of the sweet potato and had to ask if indeed that's it was. And the medium was very mild.   I'm awarding it 2 stars because the Tigre de Leche sauce was pretty good - not great - and someone could  eat a meal here and enjoy if they're not picky.  No way that this type was an isolated incident, just by looking at the photos of the Jalea here: http://s3-media4.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/gkmZl8WuIzVUGBLCbOIVSA/l.jpg   you can tell it was fried to death.   At Machu Picchu the bar is set really low."}
{"text":"Very good Peruvian food with melt in your mouth chicken. This was a wonderful dinner after a long day at Carowinds."}
{"text":"They manage to have a good ceviche, flavorful food. One of the good Peruvian places in Charlotte for sure.   Things I would recommend:  Ceviche Mixto w Mango Arroz Chaufa Toco Tacu seafood with rice Plantains"}
{"text":"Great food, extensive menu.  Restaurant is spacious, has a bar, tables are spaced out.  Bathroom had no hand soap, just \"Comet\" dish soap.  Service is TERRIBLE.  Waitresses take forever to bring you water refills, our waitress took our order about 5 times because she couldn't get it right.  We asked her about some menu items but she was completely lost (she definitely knew very little about Peruvian food), took a long time to bring our check and our \"to go\" items."}
{"text":"I've been here twice...once a couple years ago and the other time, just last night (5-14-16). Machu is pretty nondescript, located in a strip mall with a Food Lion.   The servers and waitstaff are so friendly and immediately greet you upon arrival. The inside is lit pretty dimly and includes a full bar. If you have a large group or a party of two, there's plenty of space to accommodate you. In terms of large parties, they prepare food and meals 'family style' so lots of sharing can be done.  I personally recommend trying the Peruvian beverages, both non and alcoholic. I've tried the chicha morada (purple corn juice drink) and the mango/passion fruit flavor. I found the original chicha morada to be a tad too syrupy sweet but the mango/passion fruit flavor was/is delicious. Also, if you're in the mood for an alcoholic Peruvian beverage, go for the Pisco Sour. Tart and delicious. Goes down a little too smoothly.  As for the food, my favorites include the plaintains which are sweetly charred, the arroz con chaufa(very similar to Chinese chicken fried rice), and there's a beef dish that I completely forget the name of but is served with peppers and potatoes.  The menu is quite extensive and there's something bound to please every taste bud in your group."}
{"text":"The worst service I have ever had in a restaurant! The waiter took ten minutes to get to us, the food came out cold because he was too busy, another waitress brought it out, I asked for a refill it did not happen, the manager was concerned asked who my waiter was and still no results. Getting the check was a task itself, I had to get up and ask the other waitress could you please get my check. Finally he came and delivered it. When he gave me the check he tried to slip a fast one and put a more expensive dish on the check to bump the automatic added gratuity on the check. What restaurant automatically adds gratuity for a $30 meal? So yeah I caught it, I maybe white looking but I speak Spanish buddy. Def heard your little \"gringo\" comment as I left the restaurant too. Growing up in New York and eating at all the authentic Peruvian restaurants in North Jersey, place is nowhere near as good. Best of luck and I will never return!"}
{"text":"Save at least a little bit of room for the Milhoja, a desert with a million layers of light flaky puff pastry with layers of dulce de leche. It's so good!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, great service, good food. Always satisfied when we go to Machu Picchu."}
{"text":"The fella and I came here with a Groupon, and it was a fairly solid visit.  It took us a minute to get seated because the lobby is difficult for the staff to see if no one's in there, and the ambiance is seriously lacking (think dimly/oddly-lit fish camp), but I appreciate the Peruvian movie being shown and the mural of Machu Picchu on the wall.  Our waitress was really sweet but knew nothing about wine. They were out of the first two the fella ordered, so he asked for just any white wine, and she pointed to the Pinot Noir. Thankfully, she asked a gentleman (the manager?) to help out, and he was really knowledgeable.  I got the rotisserie chicken with yucca and plantains (mmmm... plantains). The chicken was good but maybe a smidgen dry, but the yucca and plantains were heavenly. The fella got the Ceviche de Camarones, and he was pleasantly surprised by how good the sweet potato and Peruvian corn were. He said the shrimp was good, too, but there was a little too much juice. (The menu says lime juice, but he said it tasted like lemon juice.)  There were quite a few other parties there on a Wednesday night at 8:00 p.m., which I was surprised by and glad to see. Since it's in a weirdo Food Lion strip mall, it put us off, but the food is definitely worth coming back for."}
{"text":"I just love this place. I can't believe I haven't reviewed it already- I've been coming since it was on Independence. Service is friendly and they food is amazing. My favorites are the papa rellena and aji de gallina."}
{"text":"Called , placed the order I wanted and confirmed my food at 11 . ( closes @12)  while I was outside the restaurant the whole time .  The waitress said I'll call you in 15 mins for your order when it's ready . 30 mins passed and nothing . Waitresses started leaving and my husband decides to go in and ask about our  order and the waitress said we never made the food because the orders were wrong and lied about calling me 3 times when they never did and if the order was wrong she could've told me thru the phone instead of saying ok ok ok like wow and the thing was bugs me is it was all a lie becuase they wanted to leave already and be lazy and not make any food. I'm definitely not wasting any more money here."}
{"text":"Out of all the Peruvian spots in Charlotte this has to be my favorite.  Incredible seasoning.  Huge portions at a not so huge cost.  Only thing I didnt like, and Im nitpicking here, it seems a bit dark and gloomy on the inside.  The staff is great, I just mean the lighting.  But who cares right?  As long as my belly is happy."}
{"text":"My family and I just moved to North Carolina 4 months ago and we've been looking for good Peruvian restaurants.  I was born and raised in Peru so I am very critic when it comes to Peruvian food.   I lived in California for 15 and was able to find 3-4 great places there.  In North Carolina I have mostly found restaurants that sell \"Peruvian rotisserie chicken\"( which are great) but no good place with a menu offer more Peruvian option.  I wasn't sure what to expect about this place because of the mixed reviews but I have to admit that it was pleasantly surprised. The ceviche was tasty, the tacu tacu with seafood sauce was excellent.  Chicha morada was also good.  The service was fast and it was clean.  The only reason why I didn't give them a 5 star is because the \"papa a la huancaina \" was not very good, it lacked flavor as if it was missing more aji amarillo or something else.  They brought me extra potatoes and a different \"ají amarillo sauce\" to compensate though,  that one was good!   I will definitely come back next time I am in the area."}
{"text":"The sister brought me here and I've been craving it again ever since. Ceviche de Mariscos was to die for, the portions were large, it was a random weekday and not lunch or dinner so they weren't busy and our waiter was perfectly attentive. I didn't get a cocktail because I had to drive, but I'll definitely be back"}
{"text":"This place went down hill. First thing you'll notice is the service. They may have 8 servers on staff but one cook. Your food will take days to get out of the kitchen. The appetizers are usually cold by the time they reach your table. The second part is the food. It's terrible. Undercooked, underseazoned and not authentic. Do not get seafood! My seafood was terribly hard to chew. I had to add salt and ask for some kind of sauce to season my fish. The most disappointed visit I've had in a while. I'm not coming back, and you should avoid it."}
{"text":"I'm very wary of trying certain cuisines outside of areas where I've found it to be better. To be specific, I wasn't sure how good Peruvian food would be in NC when I live in NYC. This was fantastic though!   I had the ceviche and it was fantastic! I also had some other dish that I can't remember but it was also great.  My suggestions if this is your first time would be to try something new and you'll definitely enjoy it.  The spicy is very spicy, like sweating up a storm spicy.  The staff is pleasant so be sure to leave them a great tip.  Prices were fair and the portions were generous."}
{"text":"Food was great and plenty...flavor explosion on every entree we had. Pescado a lo macho. ..and ají de gallina..Item you should try it at the place."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. Food had very little flavor, ordered the seafood cerviche and it was bland and had a side of corn that was boiled and a side of deep fat fried corn. All weird and bland. Ordered a bottle of Traiphe red wine, it was served very warm, almost hot. Blah and gross."}
{"text":"Not the best Peruvian food we've had.  There are at least 3 other better places in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Recommended by a Peruvian lady we met while shopping,  we decided to try this restaurant for dinner . The 1st thing I noticed when I entered the restaurant was that it had a nice  bright atmosphere of  red and black decor. We were greeted by a very friendly waiter who explained the food on the menu and suggested some dishes for us to try  since we told  him we were new here  . Fried corn kernels were brought to our table as an appetizer . My dining mate ordered the papa rellena- mashed potato puffs filled with ground beef, egg and olives and served with salsa criolla, a red onion , lime and cilantro combo. This was delicious. I ordered the 1/2 rotisserie chicken with 2 sides. The chicken was marinated and smoked.  It was tender and delicious. My sides were a salad and sweet potato fries. My dining mate ordered Aji De Gallina, or shredded chicken with a yellow bell pepper sauce  with sliced boiled potatoes and rice. The flavor was mellow and pleasing. The food came out hot, nicely plated, good portions and everything tasty. A bit pricey for some dishes. Menu features a variety of Peruvian, fish, beef, chicken and specialties such as Ceviches, rice  and pasta dishes, soups , appetizers as well as desserts. The variety of sides:, fried plantains, yucca, beans and rice, salads, sweet potato fries, eggs  served any way plus other sides. There is something for everybody here. We will certainly return."}
{"text":"This was my first time eating Peruvian food so I have no basis of comparison. Everything was good, but not quite good enough to return. The worst part about dining here was the noise level. At 8pm on a Saturday, they had a guy singing and playing music at club-level. I had to basically scream to hear my friend. I found it odd. Also, our water glasses were never refilled."}
{"text":"We went for lunch and used a restaurant.com certificate. We would not have ventured to eat here otherwise. We were pleasantly surprised at how busy the place was on a Saturday afternoon. The service was great and the food was outstanding. we had a shrimp dish for an appetizer and fish and chicken for our meals. The taste and presentation was great. My husband raved about the 1/4 chicken that he had.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Best Peruvian here in Charlotte thus far. Even Better than the place I ate at in Miami! I have went back twice. Service is kind of slow they don't really pay you much attention but the food is worth it... Piña colada is amazing"}
{"text":"We had a great experience for it being our first time visiting from Chicago. We took our friends there and they lovesd it. Food portions were a good size. Prices were fair based on food content. Service was good, our server didn't respond to anything we asked. She would just walk away and then come back with something we asked for. We were never sure if she heard us. We went on Sat and they had entertainment. Not sure if that's regular but it was fun. It's a bit loud because of the music, dj and dancing but not loud enough that kids won t enjoy it. Definitely family friendly and easy parking. Food quality was a 5. For me to give them a 5 I would like the servers to dress the part. Servers look like they rolled out of bed. And a host at the front desk at all times, it took awhile for someone to acknowledge us but none of this hindered our overall experience. Just a few minor improvements."}
{"text":"I don't know how other reviewers can rate this place more than 1 star. First the food: very overpriced, nothing special about the flavor, I would have enjoyed a Chinese take out without breaking my bank account. We ordered food good for 3 people, fried rice with chicken, seafood fried rice and beef with rice and 1 pastry...we paid $60+ something dollars!!! There were barely any meat, it's all full of rice on a big plate. I could have spent $20 from a Chinese take out and enjoyed it with so much good tasting food. Service: very poor, kept calling the server to refill our drinks.  Don't waste your money. I was so disappointed with this place."}
{"text":"No complaints here. Stepped into Machu  Picchu for my son's 18th birthday. We were greeted with a smile, and seated immediately. The place was empty because it was 430 in the afternoon, so the pressure was on them to pay full attention to us. Nice strategy, right? The waiter was charming and attentive. Couldn't ask for more. The food was delicious. My wife was floored by the ceviche mixto and my son and I both had variations of their steak. I cleaned my plate, which was a lil embarrassing. My son loved his dish and wasn't able to finish it all. I payed with a groupon, which in my opinion is the best way to go when trying a new place. We will climb Machu Picchu again!"}
{"text":"Love it. I've tried so many dishes and  they have all been delicious. Service is awesome too.  My favorites are the chicken, the ceviche, the macho fish."}
{"text":"My order was takeout so I can't comment on dining in experience. Staff was pleasant who took my order. I sat in waiting area which is partitioned off from restaurant so you won't be staring in diners faces  the rotisserie chicken was pretty good in terms of moisture, flavor wise I've had better. The rice, beans and plantains were done right as well. I used a coupon deal and would come again without a coupon"}
{"text":"Mmmm delicious ceviche, Peruvian corn, tasty chicken. This is a nice find!"}
{"text":"I would have given it a 4 stars but the place looks like an old rundown bar and restaurant in a shady part of town. Dark and dimly lit interior, old dark-stained country style tables and chairs that has seen better days. It seems like this restaurant is alive with latin dancing at night as there seems to be a large dancefloor. The food is nice though."}
{"text":"Great food, good service.  First time trying Peruvian food and I would recommend to anyone. They serve good strong drinks too!"}
{"text":"This place came recommended before they moved from the east side of town to Pineville.  After reading the other reviews, I finally decided to check this out on my own.  Thankfully something decent replaced the horrible Mexican place that used to occupy this space. The decor has not changed much inside except for there is now a photo of Machu Picchu on the wall.  There is also a counter up front where they sell what I assume to be Peruvian foods.    The menu is broad.  I was gravitating toward the rotisserie chicken but that's what my server recommended as well.  So I ordered that, plantains and a salad.  Service was good although I could barely hear my server as she spoke quietly and I was sitting near one of the music speakers.    I was presented with these miniature croissants with a spicy sauce that were quite good.  After I finished both of those, my meal arrived.  The chicken was juicy but I couldn't really taste the flavors of the spice rub.  The sauces were a bit watery but were similar to Genaro's.  The salad was unappealing and was primarily made up of iceberg lettuce and onions but it was tolerable by adding the green dipping sauce.  The best thing about the meal was the plaintains.   They were plentiful and flavorful.  Perhaps I should have tried something else but if chicken is their specialty then I think you can do better at Genaro's down the road.    So I think this place is worth about a 2.75 so I'll round it up to a 3."}
{"text":"This is hands down the best ceviche I've had in a long time!  The service was outstanding, the portions were huge.  Kids friendly, and priced just right!!! So happy my husband choose this place for mother's day.   Will definitely come again!"}
{"text":"Wow we loved this place.  Had a seafood soup that was full of crab, octopus, scallops, mussels.  Very good broth and I'll add more of the hot sauce next time.  Husband had the ceviche with mango and avocado, a huge plate with tons of variety and yummy octopus.  Good friendly service, this is a real gem.  Went for lunch and interested to return in the evening to see if it's lively at the bar."}
{"text":"Got the bistec encebollado. First time I ever tried Peruvian food. Steak was good. Vegetable with it were good and tasty. Got a side order of rice with it. Rice was cooked good. Server was nice and knowledgable."}
{"text":"Come here for some traditional Peruvian food and to support a local restaurant! There's the Peruvian style 1/2 chicken with sides, ceviches, Chicharróns, fish and meat dishes and more. They've updated the menu for optics but the food is mostly the same. Weeknight specials are available like BOGO 1/2 price apps and a small discount on the 1/2 chicken. The prices typically range in the $10-$20. If you order something you don't like the first time, I'd recommend coming back and trying something else. I believe you'll quickly find something to enjoy.  They still have the tv's for futbol but it's never crowded when we've come to just eat. Nothing spectacular with the service but a nice casual dinner suits me perfectly fine."}
{"text":"This was my First time eating Peruvian food in Charlotte. My mother is Peruvian so I always have the taste for it. It was great! I ordered papa la huancaina and lomo saltado. The food was very flavorful, I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"My sister & I, having spent much time in Peru, were craving some Peruvian food.  This was my first visit to this restaurant and our meal was at noon.  My \"Caldo de Gallina\" (chicken soup) was typical Peruvian in it's size (very large) and contents (about 1/4 chicken, 2 boiled eggs, vegetables, and delicious broth).  This item is more than enough for a meal.  My sister's \"Arros Chaufa\" (fried rice dish with egg and vegetables) was very enjoyable for her.  I tried it and it was certainly tasty but not as good as \"Pisco Y Canela\" restaurant.   The staff was friendly but lacked training or possibly was just apathetic.  The main courses should not have been brought out before the appetizers (delicious Anticuchos) were finished.  We were the only ones in the restaurant and the servers could have been more attentive.   I suggest you don't add a tip; they add 18% automatically , which was a little more than I would have left."}
{"text":"Yummy  food ....  You will not be dissapointed with anything on the menu, plus the staff is as tentative as they get. I had a LOVELY night post Valentines  Day!"}
{"text":"Peruvian food done right is my favorite. They have an amazing ceviche and the rotisserie chicken with plantains is my go to with a side of their black beans.  Great service and great food."}
{"text":"I honestly love the food here but what kills me is the lack of structure on running the restaurant and customer service here at this establishment. My boyfriend and i have been long time customers of this restaurant from the days when they were located off of E Independence and have always loved their food. However after my past few dining experiences here haven't been the greatest so I'm going to back off for a bit.  What brought it home for me on backing off of this place was when i went to grab lunch last Sunday there with my girlfriends. We walk in the doors and the front lobby was packed full of people. There was no hostess to be found anywhere to even help direct the traffic of people. Everyone was scattered everywhere just anxiously waiting to be seated or have their name put down on a wait list. Hell no one knew where the line began or ended, people were just making their own lines.  From the time i walked in to the time i finally got to put my name down on a wait list was literally about 10 mins of just waiting for a hostess to greet us. The hostess was fine with my group, but i watched her interactions with other customers and it made me cringe. She was rude and would have an attitude towards them. We were told it'll be a 25 min wait which ended up being 45 mins but who's keeping count haha. I could tell the frustration grew with other clients as well because the hostess would come out and then go missing for long periods of time. Some people weren't even greeted as they were standing there waiting and waiting.  Again no form of structure and it drives me off the walls because i come from working in restaurants. It's just unprofessional and poor customer service. For the 45 mins that i waited to be seated, I literally watched people walk in and walk out because again no staff to be found to greet them or inform them of what's going on. I would see them stand there for 5 to 10 mins and then just walk out because they couldn't deal with the madness Fast forwarding to when we finally get seated, our \"hostess\" ended up also being our server which was just madness to me. Hence why she would go missing for long periods of time since she was \"hostessing\" and \"serving\". On that note, service was just slow, our orders got messed up. My girlfriend and i spoke up and our server/hostess had the audacity if we still wanted our order corrected. I was just so taken back by the ignorance.  Again, i dont necessarily take the mentality that the customer is always right but seriously?!?! If you made the mistake then fix it, point blank. I just couldn't believe she was seriously asking my girlfriend if she still wanted her side that she didn't receive. Like hello we're paying for it and if we ordered it then yes i would like what we ordered. As i keep repeating just the lack of customer service kills me.  Anywho, it was 2 hr lunch that was honestly a waste of time. I wish i listened to my gut and had gone elsewhere to dine cause honestly all we received was ok food and hands down horrible customer service. They have some serious issues to work on so until they get all their kinks worked out, I'm backing the hell off for a long while on dining here."}
{"text":"Very tasty! I love spicy seafood.  Tres leches cake shouldn't be placed on top of chocolate syrup."}
{"text":"Food was excellent. Service was a bit sketchy, but they were super busy. I would certainly go back. The aji de pollo was amazing as was the ceviche."}
{"text":"It started out promising when we were greeted with a knowledgable host, then waited on by someone else. The decor is simple. There is some hot hominy kernels they put on the table. Not for me. My Pisco sour was citrusy, a little sweet and sour and delicious. I ordered a Tamal and a Papa Relleno. My Papa Relleno  came out piping hot and was nicely seasoned, with beef inside, filled with creamy mashed potatoes. I asked about a sauce, that I was supposed to have gotten and she brought out a tiny Salsa Criollo, definitely not the big one in the pic. Same for the tamal, which was dry and tasteless, definitely NOT  GENEROUSLY filled. I ordered the pork tamal and it had 2 small, dry pieces and about 3 or 4 pieces of pork fat. Gross. Baldie had Tacu Tacu con Lomo Saltado. Steak with fries and tomatoes and onions with some kind of fried beans. The bean thing was delicious. I don't know why they asked Frank how he liked his steak because it came out well done anyway and a little chewy. It was good, don't get me wrong, he ate the SHIT out of it, but not the best. New York on a Main Street In Port Chester, where all the Peruvian restaurants are, has the best Peruvian food. Overall, it was good. I'd go again and try something different."}
{"text":"The ambiance and look of the place is very nice, clean open space. Ordered the Tallarin Verde, Bistec a la pobre, an order of yuca bread, and a cup of Chicha which is an ethnic Peruvian Drink. So lets begin with the Tallarin Verde, the flavor was good, but the type of pasta used was not my favorite and a bit on the soggy side, they add chicken to it but, I do not like meat. The Bistec a la Pobre looked decent, but the taste tester (yeah, im so fancy, I have taste testers) Subject stated the Bistec or the steak was not good, actually on the hard to chew side and lacking in flavor. The rice was not very nice on the palate, either. The only good things were the french fries and the fried plantains. Moving on to the Yuca bread, that is the reason why I might come back to this place, only for the Yuca bread, hmmm nummy! Hey you got something right! The Chicha was pretty good, but come on, if you can't make Chicha, then there is no way you are a true Peruvian Restaurant."}
{"text":"Great spot if you're hungry for hearty Peruvian fare! We had a delicious and moist tamal with a yummy onion salsa, followed by aguadito de pollo (chicken and rice soup with lime, carrots, peas and hominy). Main courses of lomo saltado and aji de gallina were good sizes and very flavorful...just like Peru. Daughter enjoyed salchipapas (fries and hot dogs) and chicha morada drink. Wish we had saved room for milhojas or alfajores for dessert but maybe next time...we'll be back."}
{"text":"Great Peruvian restaurant. Good fresh food.  Lomo salteado, chaulafan, bistec a lo pobre are favorite dishes"}
{"text":"Some of the best food I've had in a LONG LONG time!! Very Latin America atmosphere which is nice and they start you off with fried corn to munch on while you decide which awesome entree you'll be eating. They have a ton of different options to choose from but the potatoes and rice are consistent with almost all the meals. I give 4 stars because me and my girl friend came here for Valentine's Day dinner which I thought would be a great idea because they're kind of hidden away in pineville and didn't think it would crazy busy. I was right about them not being crazy busy but unfortunately they were crazy slow. Took an hour to get our appetizer and about 30 more minutes after that to get our food when parties of 4 that were seated after us were getting their food way before us.. Just didn't make sense. They still receive 4 stars because the food is amazing here there is no denying that, but the service side has A LOT of room for improvement. Received a free 3 dollar dessert for the wait (which wasn't enough in my opinion) but it is what it is. Maybe I'll do carry out next time and we'll see how that goes!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite local restaurant and everyone who I bring is always impressed.  The portions are huge and the food is just plain delicious! You must try the lomo saltado, seafood chaufa, fried rice omg those two together are a must.  Also i love to order the Jalea fried seafood mix, \"Anticucho meat kebobs w/ potatoes\" !!!! amazing. The one thing that  have made the experience a perfect 10 was when they have a live Salsa bands on Saturday. Sometimes they have a salsa DJ on Saturday i would call first to ask, good prices on beer buckets. The staff is always extremely friendly  I am so going to try everything on the menu."}
{"text":"I ordered Ceviche mixt and really disappointed, the food was overwhelmed with lemon juice, I could hardly eat it and my teeth got sensitive, I had a bed experience with this place, when I told the waiter about it, he just told me he was sorry but didn't offer to fix the problem and walked to the back. I don't know if I ordered the wrong dish and I don't think if I will fuve it another try."}
{"text":"I was really disappointed with the food, the ambience and the service..would never go here again or recommend it to anyone.."}
{"text":"Nothing impressive about this place. The environment was not very welcoming and the ceviche I was craving for was tasteless."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch the other day. I have never had Peruvian food before but my lunch date was very familiar with it. According to him it was about as authentic as it gets.   I enjoyed the sauteed steak tips. One tip, if you get there for lunch too early the rotisserie chicken will not be ready, however you will receive excellent service.   I can't wait to go back and try more here!"}
{"text":"We went to Machu Picchu on Saturday night because I am jonesing for Peru. I am so glad we found this place because it was almost like being at a restaurant (Folklorico) in Lima. The Lomo Saltado was excellent, as was the Milanesa. The entertainment was so much fun! The only disappointment was that they had no Pisco and had to use Rum in the Pisco Sour. It wasn't their fault, tho. The waitress told me that they can't get Pisco at the ABC store in North Carolina. I'll just take my Pisco from home next time I go. One thing people are complaining about is the service. In the US, most restaurants need to turn tables over quickly so they can make a profit. It almost feels like they are rushing you, but this is our culture, so we are used to it. In South and Central America, they have a whole different attitude about dining. They believe you should thoroughly enjoy dinner with friends and family, and spend time socializing. For this reason, the waiters don't usually bother you, but wait for you to call them over when you need something. This was my experience here at Machu Picchu Restaurant and we stayed for 3 hours with nobody trying to rush us out. It was refreshing to feel like I was back in Lima or Cusco : ) We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The staff was very friendly and the food was really good. I would recommend the fried fish or the lomi saltado."}
{"text":"Came for dinner and we ordered the Ceviche Mixto and a side order of Fried Sweet Plantains. I was impressed with the ceviche. It had just the right amount of lime and I even loved the cancha.  My issue with this place was that they refused to honor my Groupon. At the end of the meal they told me that I needed to order 2 entrees, but nowhere did it say this in the fine print (I read it multiple times beforehand). Groupon refunded my money, so it wasn't that big of a deal, but it left a bad taste in my mouth (unlike the food)."}
{"text":"Great new location! The Saltado and rotisserie chicken were very good! Lots of selections and very nice staff. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place is a hit or miss. Some days your food is fantastic and others it's NOT!! The service is ok, staff is nice enough. My latest experience with the food there was not a good one so I think I will finally give up on this place. I ordered the seafood ceviche, the calamari was tough felt like I was chewing on rubber, the shrimp were also pretty hard. The dish was just not good at all. My husband ordered another seafood dish (can't remember the name). They brought it out with the rice burned and obviously the seafood had also been terribly overcooked, he left most of the seafood - also not a good dish. They desperately need some sort of quality control in the kitchen. Aside from that the kitchen seems to be located in the front of the restaurant - adjacent to the bar. Maybe someone should tell their cooks to lower the volume on their radio (and maybe their singing voices), there really shouldn't be competition between the kitchen and the music playing for your customers in the dining area."}
