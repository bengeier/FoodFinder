{"text":"Mmmmmmmm. Black and Red (Nutella & Strawberries). Well made crepe, not rushed like their predecessor's. Most definitely a must try, maybe the next time you pass by it in the mall. They supposedly have other franchises opened in the other major malls. =D"}
{"text":"I got the tutti fruitti and it was soo good!! The crepe wasn't flat at all, it was verrry chocolatey, Packed with nutella. LOVE IT!!"}
{"text":"I took the strawberry cheesecake shaved ice. It wasn't what I expected The shaved ice was not that sweet but it wasn't that tasty unfortunately. It actually did not have any taste to it. It was just milk shaved ice. The icecream was very sweet. It's supposed to be cheesecake icecream. I didn't really get the cheesecake taste.  Eating both cheesecake icecream and shaved ice outset the extreme sweetness of the icecream.  Strawberries were very fresh not that sweet.  Size was not that big.   Setting was very clean. Staffs very friendly. Menu very clear on the tv screens. No menu on the table. Only on the screen. Very quiet place no loud music which I loved.  Will try something else maybe one day. Not so soon though"}
{"text":"A weeeee bit overpriced, though not surprising if they have to cover mall rent inside Scarboough Town Centre.  My family and I tried a Nutella-licious crêpe ($5.20) with whipped cream ($1.50). Service was speedy and polite, but I'm not sure it was worth the $7 I paid.   Nothing to rave about, but not a bad snack either."}
{"text":"It is not easy to find a somewhere that serves Crepe in Scarborough... just trying to do a google search or yelp business search... Crepe de licious is the only business that comes up...  Crepe de licious is located inside Scarborough Town Centre... so you won't find anything to European about the experience.. just order your crepes and sit in the food court style area and eat it... (OK, you can close your eyes and pretend you are in Paris or something! It did not work for me!)  Black and White (Nutella® chocolate hazelnut spread, freshly sliced bananas) $5.85 - I found the crepes itself is a little soggy... - one guy pre make the crepes and then when you order they just put in on the heated surface and put the filling in - taste wise is not bad... but it is NOT Crepes a Go Go...   The crepes at Crepe de licious would not be the crepes I dream about... it is better than nothing I guess..."}
{"text":"So we got the gelato ice cream and honestly it wasn't too bad but it didn't taste like gelato. It tasted like normal ice cream. We got the watermelon, green tea, birthday cake, cookies and cream. I honestly would recommend the watermelon, it tasted so good."}
{"text":"I have been to multiple locations of this franchise which are always located inside a mall. I have always had a great experience with the sweet crepes that I have purchased.  The chocolicious Crêpe that I usually get satisfies my sweet craving. They make the crepe fresh right in front of you. It's light, thin and flavourful. The filling is basic Nutella which you can't go wrong with. If you take this to go they put it in a tiny cone to hold it together and to prevent it from dripping. They then put it in an additional paper cover around it so you can easily munch on it.  The best part is that it's hot till the last bite so you fully enjoy it.  I would return to this place to get my sweet tooth satisfied!"}
