{"text":"This is the most delicious pizza I have ever had 
Definitely on my top 10 list. 

And pollaio is the best one that they have. Really really nice!"}
{"text":"Slow and disorganized service. Rather would go elsewhere! Took us 1 hour to get it, seems like they had forgotten our order!"}
{"text":"When it opened, Masseria was hands down my favourite pizza place in Toronto. I was a regular. It was the perfect pizza joint - with carbone crust, high quality ingredients, really great staff and fresh basil at communal tables. THEN, Pizza Nova came in with a metaphorical (and maybe physical!) sledgehammer and destroyed literally everything good about the place. I mourn Masseria's demise and I curse the management who took away my favourite pizza place."}
{"text":"Really delicious pizza. I had the chicken pizza with the carbon dough. The rapini was good too. The only thing I didn't like was the excessive visits and interruptions by service staff asking if we were doing ok. A bit too much for a \"take-out\" style place. I will still go back for the delicious pizza."}
{"text":"Was an amazing place before Pizza Nova came in and destroyed the place. They took the place down as far as it could go - plastic cutlery wrapped in plastic to go with your laminated paper plates. Remember the fresh basil? Now it's half dead and blackening so you can add that to your pizza to improve its taste (the pizza flavour has disappeared). If you are looking for a Pizza Nova in King West then you have definitely come to the right place. Too bad some shrewd business person decided to destroy a great business and replace it with a terrible one. I'm betting the place will be closed down in a matter of months."}
{"text":"A new restaurant that we randomly went for our Sunday lunch. Very good food and services. I had their carbone dough pizza and salad. If you don't know what carbone dough is? You should give it a try! Nice seating space with lots of daylights. 

I will definitely go back next time to try other items on their menu."}
{"text":"The pizza was awful. Paid $25 and there were only a few vegetables on the pizza and they were dry and chewy, barely any cheese and the lady at the front was very abrupt. What a waste on money. Will have to try pizza libretto next time."}
{"text":"4 stars for the thin crust Italian style pizza.
4 stars for the modern decor. I especially dig the big round table near the window. It has pots of fresh basil at the centre that you can serve yourself on your pizza or sandwich.

My lunch was ruined by the cup of cappuccino and I'm not even a coffee snob. $4 for a tiny cup of cappuccino. I don't mind the microscopic size. However it's so light in foam milk it's like drinking espresso with water down skim milk which ruin the espresso. I went back to request more foam milk but that didn't really fix it for me. The foam milk wasn't steamed evening and it's scald. I don't even want to comment on the flavor of the coffee beans because that's a personal preference. Talking about milk? What's up with the obsession of using 2% low fat milk for cappuccino in this country? If you're going to make a proper cappuccino, use whole milk or cream to begin with. Much better. 

I recommend that they remove the espresso menu item if they can't do it properly."}
{"text":"I came here with my husband and my pizza came out, we kept waiting for my husbands pizza while mine continued to get cold. We asked the waiter multiple times where his pizza was, he kept reassuring us it was coming. After I finished my hard cold pizza, my husbands pizza still didn't come out we soon realized that they had completely forgotten about his simple pizza. We will  never be coming back. After all this they still charged us for my pizza. Terrible service.


Ps- if you're gluten free stay clear definitely cross contamination I just had a terrible reaction"}
{"text":"Masseria is a new Southern Italian restaurant and pizza bar on king st west. The pizza is absolutly fabulous with light crisp dough and fresh ingrédients. Sandwiches and salads prepared fresh daily. I was also blown away by the barbaresco wine! Delicious. This will be my regular Italian \"go to\"."}
{"text":"Just had dinner with my friend last night. The pizza was fresh, light and delicious. Highly recommend the salad. Good price for the proportion. The interior is bright and hip. The staff are super friendly. Im in love. Will go back soon!! :)"}
{"text":"Dropped in last weekend for a late Saturday lunch. The place was empty which was a blessing since we needed time to figure out how this place works. Once we figured out our pizza choice with carbon dough to share, we added a small kale Caesar which ended up being the perfect amount of food for two (plus a glass of wine each of course). 

Service was friendly and helpful in explaining how to order and what sizing might work best. We sat at the front big round table and enjoyed the oils to dip our crust. 

Room for improvement would be on the pizza itself. For what we paid, I would have loved a bit more toppings, spread further out around the pie. We had a lot of crust, but it was delicious!"}
{"text":"Service and atmosphere is nice and casual. Toppings are good.  Crust is just ok. Tried their specialty charcoal crust which was a bit bland and the traditional crust is nothing special. If this was the only pizza place in the area I would go more often however it's hard to recommend when there is Pizzaria Libretto just a stones throw away."}
{"text":"Waited one hour for my pizza. The pizza was tasteless and very dry! Horrible experience dining here in terms of food and service! Many customers dining in restaurant was yelling at the cashier about their food! Cashier sold alcohol to people standing in the line without checking ID/drivers licence.

Number one issue, there were some minor age people in the line asking to buy beer in the restaurant, the cashier took payment and gave the beer without checking ID. This happened repeatedly when I was waiting one hour for my pizza.

Number two issue, I kept asking the cashier/server how long the food will take. She was clearly poorly trained. She got me and the other table confused and mixed up.

I told the cashier/server I haven't gotten my food yet. Me and my friends have been waiting a long time at the table. The worker said \" oh you didn't get it yet ?\". THE EMPLOYEES HAVE NO IDEA HOW TO DO THEIR JOB.

I can clearly see the owner and management in this restaurant is poor and weak. When the employee doesn't know how to do her job, they allow her to give horrible service to the dining customers. By making them wait 1 hour for a pizza at their table with the waiting number in their hand.

Worst service ever. Don't recommend anyone to come here!"}
{"text":"This is one of those place where you try it once and are not impressed yet you want to give another chance. 
First the space is nice and clean with an inviting look. Brightly lit with communal dinning (Luckily the large round table gives one some privacy if you are in a larger group) 
I went for the margherita on the normal dough while my DC's got a Giardano and margherita on the activated charcoal dough. We were planning to drink later so didn't explore the wine offerings much. The service is friendly from start to finish to kudos for that. Now for the main attraction I think my pizza was above average as it had the dough became soggy from the oversaucing (too watery could be another explanation) otherwise ingredients were decent. They even encourage you top the pizza by plucking basil right of the plant (Not sure I want to indulge as there can hygiene issues there as there is no place to wash the basil after plucking it) 
My DC's liked their pizza so I think I will be back to try it out with the charcoal activated dough.
3 stars with a half star bump for well trained friendly service."}
{"text":"I got the carbon crusted Diavola, it was pretty delicious, I ordered this through foodora, and the rider made the mistake of placing the pizza at the bottom of his bag, which rendered the pizza soft and steamed, luckily a quick bake in the oven returned the pizza to its past glory. The sauce was decent, the other ingredients were of high quality, and the crust was light and crispy, the charcoal in the crust does not change the flavour, but it certainly makes it look spectacular. Overall the pizza was delicious, but $15+ for a tiny little pizza, is Just too much, its a very small pizza, and its good, but not worth the price, salt and tobacco and Maker pizza make far superior pies at the same price and their size is worthy of the price. The pizza was good, but at that price point for the size, and considering there are a few better pies in the area to order from (Maker) then I'll pass."}
{"text":"Five stars for the charcoal pizza, with its remarkable crisp but chewy crust offered alongside fresh basil leaves and quality olive oil. Four stars for the flavour of the sandwiches. One star for food safety. After ordering the veggie sandwich and the tuna sandwich we realized they were taking them right out of the glass display case and warming them (more a gesture than a temperature as the cheese wasn't even melted). When they delivered the tepid limp things I asked how long they'd been sitting there and the server was kind enough to explain they're only allowed to be in there for four hours without refrigeration, but we were eating sandwiches made at 3pm, nearly seven hours earlier! I would have sent them back if I wasn't so starved - and it looked like staff were eating the others at closing so hopefully all will be well? I'd eat pizza here again for sure, it was fresh and scrumptious, but if you feel like a panini, ask that they make it fresh -- or run next door to Portland Variety, where they have a proper panini toasting grill and more respect for their customers' safety."}
{"text":"Had the Margarite on regular dough and pollo on Carbone dough. Both tasted really good but size it could be bigger for the price. Fresh basil on the table is a great idea and really added to the experience. Also ordered meatballs which came with garlic bread. Also really good. Hopefully these guys stick around. The staff were really nice and friendly."}
{"text":"If only I lived closer to Masseria! This place is great for a quick bite, date night, and even large groups. Masseria serves ready-made paninis and salads, 3 different crusts of thin crust pizza, and even drinks. The inside decor is modern, spacious, yet still functional.

The service here is impeccable, and the server was more than happy to explain ingredients I didn't understand on the menu. She suggested we try a pizza with carbon crust and one without so we could compare the texture / taste, which was a great idea. Verdict: carbon curst is REALLY good!! I was also very pleasantly surprised as I could actually taste all of the toppings without being overwhelmed by extra-burnt pizza bottoms / crust - something that sadly too often occurs.

Thanks Yelpers for suggesting this place :)"}
{"text":"This is my new fave pizza place! As soon as you arrive at the top of a short flight of stairs, friendly staff are there to take your delicious pizza  order. After that, continue along the counter where you have the option then to order your appetitizers, like a generous platter of freshly shaved prosciutto, gorgeous salads and drinks. 

At the communal tables, you can pick fresh basil leaves right off the plant in front of you to put on your pizza.

We didn't know what to expect when we walked in and were blown away by the service and quality of food. The wine was a bit pricy, other than that, no complaints! This is a definite repeat visit."}
{"text":"Really really delicious pizza and pasta. The black carbon pizza dough tastes amazing. Lunch price is reasonable for king west. Manager is very friendly and you can tell he cares about his business. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Awesome new spot in Toronto for wood oven pizza! You can make your own or choose from their selections of pizzas. This is your classics on the go pizza place. You place your order and pay before you get your pizza. They make it right away and it's quick service. They also have fresh basil on the tables for you to put on your pizza. My fiancé and I really enjoyed this place! Must try!!"}
{"text":"Wow, I have found my new go-to pizza place in a Toronto!  Ordered via UberEATS and I have to say this was the best I've had in the city.  The crust was thin, crusty and incredibly light.  Toppings were perfect - the mushroom pizza was a stand out.  Tried the meatballs and they were also out of this world!  Will, for sure, be coming in or ordering from them again!"}
{"text":"Blown away! 

The pizza is absolutely amazing!! Best pizza I have had in Toronto and I've tried all the greats, that's not to take away from Brooklyn and the others it's just that this place is extremely delicious!!"}
{"text":"Came here to try their carbon pizza crust. I noticed the place put a Pizza Nova sign with the name recently. I'm not sure that that branding helps in a neighbourhood like King West, which prefers to support local. Nevertheless, the pizza was a good Neapolitan style wood oven pizza. I had the diavola which could have done with some more salami and cheese, but was still tasty enough. With all of the pizza options nearby, I'm not sure that this hits the spot, but it wasn't bad. 4 stars, because it's pizza, and pizza can't be under for stars!"}
{"text":"Usually pizza is not my go to food but this place is awesome. You get to order pizza in a similar way you order Subway - customize your dough and your toppings. The carbon dough is really cool and tastes quite good too (it's about the same in taste but it's a bit of more crispy on my opinion, plus the health benefits). The salad that comes with the Yelp check in promotion combo was absolutely a bomb! For $15 you get a gourmet salad and a gourmet freshly made pizza - it's can't get any better!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious!!
We were greeted right way by such friendly staff!! Extremely knowledgeable about food and totally willing to answer questions!
Thank you all so much for delicious carbon Pizza!! Say goodbye to tanning salons in winter- it's all about carbon Pizza- feeling darker already :)
Thank u so much!! Can't wait to try full menu!"}
{"text":"Great location, decor and service. The staff gives you premium service right from the entrance to the exit."}
{"text":"Our waitress told us this would be the best pizza we every had and she was  right! 
Modified the mushroom pizza. Delicious"}
{"text":"Very good pizza, friendly and knowledgable staff. I highly recommend this restaurant for a causal yet eloquent dine. Lovely."}
{"text":"This place has built a small following on instagram due to its unique carbon crust, which makes the pizza appear black. Although, it tasted exactly like regular pizza dough. Similar to levetto, it's a fast casual type of setting, but it's got nice decor, which makes the place quite \"insta-worthy\". Each pizza will run for about $20, which is pretty standard for the restaurants in the area. They also have salads and sandwiches, but really who comes here for anything other than the pizzas? 

You give your order at the front, walk to the end and pay for your order. From there your pizza is prepped as you wait at one of their benches or their large round table. The aroma of fresh pizza wafts in the air as you wait and a server will bring your pizza right to you once it's ready. 

My friend and I ordered the margherita and boscaiolo (mushrooms, pecorino, and truffle oil) to share. Each pizza is about 11\", but one pizza for one person would suffice if you're not too hungry. You can grab some fresh basil from the many pots in the restaurants to top your pizza. Or, drizzle some olive oil or chilli infused olive oil on top. 

This place would've got a 5/5 had our margherita not been a little burnt on the crust. We also got our margherita at least 10 minutes before our boscaiolo came, at which point our first pizza had already gotten cold. Despite all this, I would definitely come back here."}
{"text":"The pizza I ordered was dry, bland and had the consistency of cardboard. There are way better places for pizza out there. Even Pizza Pizza is better!"}
{"text":"This just might be the best pizza place in Toronto. Freshly made with your choice of toppings. 

A great place to sit and watch out the window as traffic rolls and strolls by... or a cool place to park yourself in the middle table and watch the kitchen work their magic. 

The freshest ingredients and the BEST crust you'll ever have on a pizza. 

LOVE this place!"}
{"text":"Really awesome pizza - and it's licensed too! I went with a few friends around dinner and it was super busy not because of the people, but of the delivery orders they had. Also the Carbone dough is a must-try. Doesn't taste any different but tastes lighter and the novelty is nice (up next, unicorn rainbow dough?)

Napoletana ($14) - awesome thin crust, Instagram worthy pizza. I got to say, competition is hard with all the pizza places popping up on King Street - this place is nice for a quick sit down. 

A bit disappointed with the customer service though. As I mentioned, dinner gets a bit busy. However, as a patron in the restaurant, it took a while to get their attention to get any order in and in addition, it seemed as though me and my party were ignored when I asked how long out order would take after waiting for almost 30 minutes. Lastly, all the tables had dirty dishes and pans on them, which we had to clear ourselves. I would otherwise give a 4 star, but because of the lack of good service I would give Masseria a two star."}
{"text":"We had reservations here for a large party.  We had booked 1/2 the restaurant for dinner for a bachelorette party.  It was a good place for a large group if you didn't want to be stuck in one spot.  It was easy to move around and chat with everyone.  

Although they didn't split the bills for each person, they were able to provide 2-3 bills per table, and you could split it between a few different cards, so that wasn't too bad.

I didn't have pizza myself, rather I had the meatballs and the tomato and mozzarella salad.  The salad was delicious and tasted very fresh.  The meatballs were also really good.  Get a piece of toast on the side to dip in the sauce.  

My biggest issue was this:  There were about 30 of us there, and everyone was excited for the bride-to-be with a lot of people coming from out of town, and people not having seen each other for awhile.  As with most large groups, we were a bit loud at points.  No one asked us to quite down.  This was our first stop for the party, and we ordered some wine with dinner.  Between 30 of us there were 4-5 bottles of wine.  No one was drunk, rowdy or out of hand.  I had 1.5 glasses myself (and when I say glass, I'm talking 3-4 oz.)  Despite that, they cut everyone off.  I was quite surprised.  There was no warning, they didn't cut specific people off, everyone was.  A bit disappointed with that.

Besides that, however, I thought the food was really good and if I was in the area, I'd probably pop in again.  Just don't expect this to be the place you're going to pre-game before a night out."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere. You order your food, pick a seat if you are dining in, and wait for the staff to bring you your food. The order line took awhile, but the food came within 15 minutes. I ordered the chicken carbona pizza. The crust was advertised as thinner and lighter, but I really couldnt tell the difference. The only thing I felt was the crust tasted more burnt, but the waiter told me it tasted the same as a traditional crust. The pizza itself was ok, but I've had better. I got the lemon coconut drink for $4, which was recommended by the staff. It was bland and watered down. I personally did not like it. 

I enjoyed the fresh basil on the table. I thought that was a unique touch. They have regular and spicy olive oil for your use. 

This place is good for fast food and is an upgraded dining experience from pizza nova or pizza pizza, but it does cost more than those places though."}
{"text":"I had the Napoletana on the carbon crust and the pizza itself was great. The toppings consist of tomato sauce, oregano, anchovy, sun dried olives, roasted garlic and chilies. Plenty of flavor in each bite, bold and almost overpowering since both the anchovy and olives are incredibly salty. The crust is thin and crisp, holding up well under all the toppings. Note that there is no cheese, so it lacks the creaminess and balance that cheese usually brings to all the salted toppings. Not a bad pizza, just very bold in flavor. For a more mild palate, try the Giardino. I had a slice from my friend's order and it was much better balanced. The pizzas took a good 20 minutes to arrive but they are individually made to order so the delay is reasonable. However, the service was another matter....

We came for an early dinner on a Friday night and the place was mostly empty, so no crowding reason for any oversight. The restaurant is run as a semi-self service model, you order and pay at the cashier, grab your own water from a dispenser, and take any table available. They bring the food to you when it's ready, but whatever service we did experience seemed very confused. My pizza wandered around the restaurant with the waiter asking every table if they ordered it. I had to double check the menu myself to make sure it was mine and chase down the waiter for it. They forgot to bring my friend's drink but when they were reminded, they didn't even know what was ordered. There was general sense of confusion and miscommunication. I'm not sure why there is such a breakdown when we are already doing half the work for them. I can imagine that it get's worst when there is a larger crowd or during busier times. One star off for the lack of customer service."}
{"text":"We had a really nice dinner at Masseria last night. We had to abandon a long line at Wvrst, which says a lot because we all LOVE Wvrst, so we arrived with super low expectations and unprepared for what we were getting into. We immediately noticed the black pizzas and were worried that they were burnt. Once we had the whole carbone thing explained to us (regular dough mixed with activated charcoal), all 8 of us took the plunge and tried it out. We were completely impressed. The pizzas are light and airy, but still fill you up and have a nice crunch:chewy ratio. Toppings are fresh and delicious. Some people at our table had the mozzarella salad and commented that it was as good as any they had in Italy. Bonus points for the fresh basil on the table - very nice touch. I would've given this place 5 stars, but the service model is kind of confusing, so getting seated and settled in was a bit of a challenge. I'm sure it's fine once you get used to it, but I think table service is the way to go in a place like this. The margherita pizza was my fave!!"}
{"text":"A new restaurant we chanced to stop at lunch at today. Masseria has a open-kitchen which allows you to see your food being prepared. I had a delicious tuna panini and a side grain salad mixed with vegetables. Barbara had a balsamic-dressed salad. Too delicious -- and executive chef, Rob Leclair stopping by to check on how we liked our food. I'm already to thinking about going back.

Round II at Masseria Ristorante. Tonight I had Napoletana pizza with their croccantini (crushed charcoal) crust the pizza has tomato sauce with oregano, anchovy, sun dried olives, roasted garlic and chilies. for a change of pace, I added fresh basil as a topping. Truly amazing."}
{"text":"5+ people and beware.  They don't split cheques and may arbitrarily cut you off with no reason.  I was so impressed w the the staff but in the end I required an understanding that we were a large crew.....  but hardly out of Control..... 
group consensus: not worth it.  Libretto it up."}
{"text":"Hands down, BEST pizza in the city! The venue is almost as sweet as the people working there. Seriously some of the most attentive, kind, FRIENDLY, happy staff. The atmosphere is fairly casual but the pizza tastes gourmet, fully licensed you can go with friends or on a date. 
Must try the carbone pizza dough (looks black) but tastes like regular dough but is lighter. 
The mushroom pizza with truffle oil will be picked every time!"}
{"text":"Great place for a quick bite in. I enjoyed this Southern Italian pizza hub. Their pizza gets ready in less than 10 mins. Plus a good variety of food. Good food and great ambience."}
{"text":"Overpriced wine and average pizza.  Good effort but still a way to go to rise above the competition."}
{"text":"Please see below my previous five-star review. This place used to be my favourite pizza place in Toronto hands-down. The carbon crust, the fresh ingredients, great service...all gone now that it has re-branded with its Pizza Nova owners. 

The pizzas are now smaller, the crust tastes like cardboard and the service is lacklustre. Even the basil on the tables -- one of my favourite parts -- is now dead or dying on the table. Not going to add that to my meal! Thank you very much. Unfortunately, I don't think I can go there anymore. Please go back to the original! 

8/12/2017: 

Best local pizza joint. With libretto and north of Brooklyn nearby, I was skeptical when a new pizza place was opening. But I have already gone 10+ times. 

Crudo is my favourite, the serving of prosciutto is large and it is insanely fresh. If you are looking for thick and greasy, this isn't your place. It's fresh and light and doesn't weigh you down after. The black dough is my favourite too (although my bf is reluctant to try). 

The managers are always there to ask if everything is ok - old school customer service."}
{"text":"Gord and I had supper this evening at Masseria.  They opened about three months ago.

You can get pizzas, sandwiches, salads, etc.  Gord and I ordered pizzas and chose our ingredients (you can also order their specialty pizzas).  There are three kinds of dough to choose from ... traditional, carbone and gluten-free.  Three minutes in the oven and the pizzas are done!  There is fresh basil and chili peppers on the table.  Gord ordered his pizza with carbone dough and pepperoni, bacon and red peppers.   I got mine with traditional dough and pepperoni, bacon and grape tomatoes.  Our pizzas were delicious!

The staff were really really friendly.  Richard, the general manager, took excellent care of us and treated us to pistachio cannelloni and biscotti, which are made in-house.  They were yummy!

We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Lovely place, very nice people who seem to be happy to work here. Fresh ingredients for amazing pizzas !"}
{"text":"This is my favourite pizza in Toronto. The portion is a good size and it tastes amazing! I got the Diavola - Tomato sauce, mozzarella, hot soppressata, basil, crushed chili, italian hot peppers on their black crust... ON POINT.

They're a fairly new company and while they had some organization issues in the past trying to figure out ordering, (you would come up to place your own order), they moved to restaurant style and it's much more organized now). People are very friendly. 

Only issue is a accessibility... If you have a stroller, cane, crutches, difficulty walking etc... There's a flight of stairs to walk up. Other than that, I'd highly recommend it."}
{"text":"I loved Masseria when they first opened, and applaud the Pizza Nova team for coming up with the concept, but since they've added the Pizza Nova portion the operations has gone completely downhill. We waited for 50 minutes to get our Masseria pizza, while every one that walked in behind us ate and left.

After 40 minutes, I went up to ask and apparently they forgot our order with the flux of online orders. While understandable, there were no apologies or anything from the staff. If I wanted to wait an hour for ok pizza, I would have ordered delivery from Pizza Hut or Pizza Pizza.

If you want dine in pizza, go down the street to Pizza Libretto. Or if you really want to try this place, just order a damn slice and be done with it. No point paying $50 for substandard \"artisanal\" pizza and an endless wait."}
{"text":"3.5 stars - Decent casual pizza restaurant but pricy for the portion. Wouldn't be my regular go-to pizza place.

Better places around the general area if you're not fixed on staying near King West (Maker Pizza)"}
{"text":"Out of all the pizza places in the city, Masseria is king. The concept is fantastic, offering quick delicious gourmet pizza, panino and salads for sit in or take out. The place is beautiful and fully licensed if you want a cocktail while you wait. I had the Tonno (tuna salad) and it was incredible. Try the carbon dough! It's very light considering it's black! Overall, great value and great food."}
{"text":"Really great pizza carbon dough 
Meatballs melt in your mouth
Prosciutto was unbelievable 
Toppings I added were minimal so maybe add extra toppings for extra $ option would be nice"}
{"text":"Food: 3.5/5
Service: 5/5
Atmosphere: 4/5
Would come back? Yes

Masseria is a really fancy take-out pizza joint. Inside, it's beautifully decorated with brand new wood furnishings, a stone fire pizza oven, and nice wall art. Because of this, and its prime location in the King West neighbourhood, you would be looking at paying restaurant-level prices for pizza ($14-20). They're famous for their black pizza (made of carbon dough), which is what I came here for. 

What I ordered:

1. Boscaiolo Pizza on Carbon Dough (4.5/5) - A white pizza with portobello & oyster mushroom, caramalized onion, pecorino and truffle oil. I loved that it wasn't too heavily topped with meats, instead, the mushrooms and truffle oil made it superior to a meat pizza. 

2. Pollaio on Carbon Dough (3/5) - I got this as per the chef's recommendation. I have to say, it's a good pizza on paper but I found it to be imbalanced due to the chunky chicken pieces (which were a bit dry, and ended up weighing down the rest of the pizza), and I'm biased to gorgonzola/blue cheese but it was a bit too overpowering on the pizza. If you're a blue cheese and meat lover, I think this is the right pizza for you.

3. Prosciutto (5/5) - Tender pieces of house-made prosciutto with warm pita bread and crispy baked red pepper shavings. Tasted like I was dining at an Italian family's home! Definitely recommended. 

4. Marinated Olives, served warm (4.5/5) - I'm a huge fan of olives, and I had never tried warmed olives before this. It comes in a bowl of about 20 or so assorted black and green olives, and it was delicious with the pizza. 

Next time, I would come back for the traditional Margherita pizza and the Tonno (tuna) salad."}
{"text":"This was my go to pizza joint in King West but after my most recent experience I am not sure I can step foot in there again.
So I placed an order for takeout and they told me it would be ready in 10 minutes max. I show up 10 minutes later and the pizza is not even in the oven yet. No big deal so I wait. They ended up burning the crap out of the pizza and had to make another one. The cashier was kind enough to offer me a complimentary cannoli.
So I watch the pizza maker pick and wipe his nose, handle a filthy rag that was nearly black and proceed to handle my second pizza. 
Ummmmmm I ain't eating that so I asked for my money back and walked out. That is pretty gross and this memory will make it difficult for me to ever visit Masseria again."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza!  In a neighborhood that is already fiercely competitive for pizza bragging rights, these guys are definitely contenders. 

The staff are super-friendly and Richard the manager is one of the best I've seen.

Casual yet upscale atmosphere with fresh and healthy ingredients sets this place apart.

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Stopped here for a quick bite. Nice service and good pizza. Tried gluten free crust which was surprisingly tasty."}
{"text":"I was hesitant to get Italian food in Toronto but this place really came through! 

So their pizza crust is black. They offer gluten free options of dough for an additional $3. They add carbon to it to give it the dark hue as well as adding other vegetables (can't extrapolate but that's what I was told) so apparently both those additives make it \"healthier\"....
Kind of a standard pizza place but with an upscale vibe. It's hip inside and located up a flight of stairs. The tables are against the floor to ceiling window looking outside on the foot traffic on King St. it's neat and entertaining watching the crowds. They also have fresh parsley plants on each of the tables. It's a cute touch. If those tables are full there's a large community table stretching the length of the kitchen. Seems fitting for lunch. 
My husband ordered the pizza. He ordered a double serving of the prosciutto which was the real deal. Thinly sliced and very pink, it looked fresh. 

I was debating between the salads but the ingredients aren't listed on the menu, just the names. Rather than make the waitress continually repeat herself, I walked over to the kitchen area. The salad are premade & presented In large bowls behind the glass. I see this as a pro & con. You can see them but since they are premade so you cannot alter them or do any substitutions. 

I opted for the Fennel salad. I loved it. The pungent taste of fennel, paired well with the aged Parmesan (real) & the dehydrated cherries were a sweet, minimal finish. It's finely chopped and filling. She also gave us a sample of the squash salad which I liked but had some kind of grain in it so I just ate the squash. It was no frills and very fresh. 
Since I don't eat breads (though I sampled the crust at my husbands urging just for this review) I ordered the meatballs as my main. I liked them. The size was perfectly portioned and the sauce tasted homemade. They weren't dry but could've used a bit more seasoning in the meat itself. They were very lightly sprinkled with grated Parmesan. I'd order them again if we returned here. They def were not overly salty which was refreshing. 

The pizza crust reminded me a lot ofNJ pizza, my personal favorite. Like NY, you can taste the water in the crust. Toronto has delicious water and so this really worked. I was very impressed. 

My criticism is the pizza Took a long time to arrive and by the time it did I was finished with my meal. I'm dropping a star for this. I'd have rather waited to receive my dishes so I could've eaten with my husband. No biggie but worth pointing out. 

Pistachioed edged cannoli- these were different. The shell was a bit on the soggy side but the filling didn't have chocolate chips mixed in which was unusual. The edges were covered in pistachios which gave it the crunch I'm accustomed to but the filling was a bit on the lemony side. They were fine but not the best. 

My husband said it's some of the best pizza he's had, equal to NY. I can say the crust rivals east coast pizza. The meatballs rocked; this place is a winner"}
{"text":"Came in here recently after the merger with Pizza Nova. Waited 45mins for my pizza. Not organized. Hopefully they step up their game and I'll leave it to growing pains. Pizza was not bad, tasted just like pizza nova (I didn't order the fancy pizza for $20) just wish it would be a bit quicker next time.  Will re-review after I go there again."}
{"text":"Awesome pizzas here!
The space that was once a tattoo parlour is now a nice clean modern place with large communal tables with bottles of olive oil, chili oil, and balsamic at your disposal, and best of all, ample potted basil plants to pick at and toss it on your food.
The service was really good, friendly and made sure you are well taken care of. The sharply dressed manager even came to our table to ask if everything was good and struck a nice short conversation.

I had the mushroom pizza with truffle oil which was really good, and they were offering dough which was made with activated charcoal (a growing food fad which I've seen it used on almost everything) which they said made for a lighter fluffier crust and gives it a distinctive black colour. I opted for this and the crust was exactly how I like it, light, airy and thin with nice crunchy bits, and it was simply cool to look at.
I also tried the gluten-free crust which was exceptionally good for GF and had none of the chalky texture typical of GF baked goods. I wouldn't have known it was even GF.
Their salads and antipasto plates looks really good and all of their freshly prepared ingredients are on full display at the counter.

I could barely finish a whole pizza, but the staff gladly boxed up my two small slices in a nice container. This is a fun casual place for a nice quick bite or with a group of friends. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I came here with my team for lunch and was very impressed with the service and food. We had a party of 10 and our server was attentive,  quick and overall very pleasant. I had the boscialo pizza, mushrooms with truffle oil and a side tonno salad ($15 lunch special) the pizza was perfect and the salad was very generous. Will def come back!"}
{"text":"Great pizza and salad got it delivered it was fresh. Enjoyed the spicy pizza. And the garlic bread was yummy too. I will be back for more sometime soon."}
{"text":"What to try?

Their black crustedpizza. Made out of charcoal and other vegan ingredients, the black crust is actually not as heavy (filling) as it is for regular crust (flour crust). It's light and thin which I really liked. Made with fresh ingredients on top, I thought it gave a nice kick with the hot toppings they added to the pizza - Diavola. If you're into spicy foods, then this is the pizza you have to try. Not only is the pizza hot already, you can add more hotness to the pizza with their spicy olive oil they have in house. 

When you walk in, there's a long communal table so you can opt to sit there and socialize with other random pizza lovers or you can also opt to sit by the window if you want more privacy and appreciate watching people walk by on king street. Pizza doesn't take long to make and is freshly made from scratch so worth the bite here!

Last tip?

Remember to ask for their olive oils (whether it be spicy or not) to add to your pizza or as a dipping sauce for the final bite of the crust!"}
{"text":"I live around the corner from this place and have been four or five times. The pizza is fantastic and the carbone crust is a must try - very unique. The fresh basil and chili oil at the table is also a nice touch. My favorite is the chicken and gorgonzola on the carbone crust. 

They have a new nutella option and a meatball appetizer that is delicious. I also really like the decor and vibe. You can definitely come here for a quick meal or loiter for drinks.

I have to say the service is also 5/5. The management and staff are very attentive and friendly. I placed an uber eats order the other day and was a bit sick. Uber was taking more than 45 minutes to pick up the food and so I cancelled the order. The Masseria manager called me and apologized on behalf of uber and delivered the food to me anyway. It was way above and beyond what most restaurants would do. It was entirely uber's fault but Masseria made it right anyway.

I'm a customer for life now. Give this place a try. It's a great compliment to Wilbur and porchetta."}
