{"text":"Cheap cheap yummy pupusas! Don't order more than two, unless you're starving - they definitely aren't as tasty reheated. Not a super special experience but not bad at all. The churros are filled with caramel but cold and doughy! Tasty sweet Horchata though."}
{"text":"Stopped into La Carreta for a late afternoon snack.  Never had pupusas before. Followed the advice of other reviewers and tried a few. They are quite excellent and at 3$ a pop they are cery affordable. 

Whatever flavor you get make sure to try the spicy salsa. It's jalapeños and carrots. Sounded strange to me, but it was fantastic. 

All in all a great spot to eat in the Plateau/Little Italy area of Montreal."}
{"text":"Kind and friendly service,  had vegetarian papusa platters and everything was perfectly cooked and made to order,  including beautifully textured yucca fries, delicious plantains,  and nicely prepared papusas.  The cabbage slaw was unexpectedly good. I can't wait to go back the next time I'm in Montreal."}
{"text":"A friend brought me here for lunch once. She insisted I try the bean/pork/cheese puposas and have a big glass of horchata with it. She didn't steer me wrong! The puposas could have been a touch warmer, but came with delicious slaw and probably the best hot sauce I have ever come across. Tangy, spicy and soo flavourful! Get the horchata, it's the perfect pairing for this meal, just sweet enough and just cinnamonny enough to offset the richness of the food."}
{"text":"Was disappointed with the attitude and demeanour of the waitress. The quiet restaurant serves pretty good food, but overall I had a bad experience with the service and wouldn't recommend it to any of my friends."}
{"text":"Great service and price.You can share many of the meals between friends.Home made salvadorien food and delicious puposas"}
{"text":"Pupusa heaven. Whenever I go to Montreal, I usually try to eat here. Super cheap food, yet so delicious. My favourite is the cheese pupusas and always the homemade slaw in the jar. You can't go wrong with this place and how little you pay for a filled up belly. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Ever staggered into a town square in San Salvador at 2am, half-cut and on the hunt for a savoury hit? Abuelas flipping corn tortillas over charcoal, the enormous pots of pickled cabbage, tomato sauce, pupusas frying and chicharron ... 

Ok, ok, so it's freezing outside, and the action is all happening in the kitchen, but simply put, of the several Salvadorian eateries in and around Beaubien/St Zotique/Bélanger, you need no other than this one. The flavours are all here: fresh and crunchy cabbage to offset the greasy pupusas and wholesome tamales, hard shell tacos, salty as hell chicharron, and one of the most amazingly pungent hot sauces I've ever eaten (be sure to request it). 

Order:
-Chicharron
-Pupusas (2)
-Chicken Tamale
-Hard shell beef taco
-Yuca fries"}
{"text":"Très bon restaurant latino !"}
{"text":"Fantastic el salvadorian restaurant. The papusas are fantastic, the service is warm and friendly and laid back. The burritos, meatball special, and yuca fries are great too - and I haven't tried their soups, but I've seen them come out of the kitchen and they look pretty amazing. 

Wash it down with a bottle of cheap/mediocre wine, OR their awesome sweet rice drink orceata (spelling probably off). A great place for a comfort  meal."}
{"text":"Decent enough food and just acceptable service. Prices too high to justify this level of insufficiency. I have a feeling that this place is letting itself slide..."}
{"text":"Délicieux! Délicieux! Délicieux! Des choix végétariens, des ingrédients frais, très abordable. Le service est un peu lent mais en même temps ça reste dans l'esprit salvadorien, très relax."}
{"text":"I'm not an expert in El Salvadorian food but La Carreta definitely rules the cheap eats in our city. Their pupusas are cheap and delicious. They also have a variety of meat and veggie options. Not interested in pupusas? They also have guacamole salad, plantains, tacos, burritos and tasty homemade horchata that apparently is really delicious with rum if you are a daredevil and your alcoholic tendencies forces you to sneak a flask in (I don't know anything about this). 

Either way, I recommend this place for anyone and everyone because there is something on the menu for all and you don't have to break the bank doing it."}
{"text":"La Carreta has been in business since 1991 and has recently changed administration. In my opinion the change has improved the restaurants image. The pupusas (corn patty stuffed with pork, cheese and fried black beans) are a little greasy but still very tasty. They lack a little bit of cheese as well. The service is okay. They seated myself and the group I was with fairly quickly but when it came to order it took our waitress(which i think is the new owner of the place) forever to bring it to our table. But what they lacked in service they made up in taste. It was cooked to perfection. Even though the service is not the best, I'd come back for the food and drinks. Their menu selection is pretty big so you can be sure I'll write about La Carreta a lot more. Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"J'adore les pupusas à cet endroit. Une genre de crêpe fourrée à la viande où on y ajoute une salade de chou mariné avec une sauce tomate. Environ 3$ la pupusas. Et entre 3 ou 4 pour les plus gros appétits. 

J'ai été déçu une seule fois où nos pupusas avaient été oubliés et étaient mous et huileux. Mais la plupart du temps, elle sont un peu croustillante et très bonne. Il y a aussi une alternative à la farine de riz avec un petit extra, mais j'aime moins le goût.

Je prends toujours ceux avec les fèves, fromage et porc. 

Une petite terrasse sur le trottoir l'été.

On a essayé les différents jus, et malgré que je n'aime pas tant ça, Jen prends toujours pour le goût spécial. À essayer une fois."}
{"text":"Very good Pupusas and good Horchata. Compares to quality in El Salvador. Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"My girlfriend showed me this place and I was most impressed by their pupusas! We came back here many many times and each time I loved the pupusas! It's soo soo good! DELICIOSOO!! Also, did know what yuca frita before, but after I tried it...omg...I LOVED IT! The service is pretty good also, the waitress is very kind.

Pro: PUPUSAS! YUCA FRITAS!
Cons: Gotta walk a little bit from metro."}
{"text":"Selon mes amis latinos...ce n'est pas la meilleure place de pupusas....Selon moi et mon bedon..c'est vraiment bon! Vous voulez gouter autre chose que des pupusas, tout en ayant un budjet limité? Essayez la Yuka frita et les Bananes frites con crema! Trop bon et pas cher. Un service correct pour le prix qu'on paye..et les fois que j'ai été on a toujours répondus à mes questions du menu!"}
{"text":"J'y suis allée une fois il y a 2 ans et j'y suis retournée récemment avec un groupe d'amis
Je n'ai jamais été déçue de la bouffe et du service, qui sont excellents
Les plats sont vraiment délicieux, et si vous y allez, essayez les pupusas qui sont la spécialité salvadorienne, un régal!! (après je ne suis pas une experte en pupusas, il y en a peut etre des meilleurs ailleurs, je sais pas! :D )
Un peu déçue par contre que les prix des boissons (alcoolisées ou non) ne soient indiquées nulle part, j'ai payé 14$ pour 2 bouteilles de bières, ce que je trouve assez cher quand même
Une bonne petite place tranquille et chill pour bien manger, en amoureux, entre amis ou en famille!"}
{"text":"Ended up at this little spot by chance. Was in the neighborhood and looked on Yelp for a recommendation. What a treat! Freshly made papusas with house made pickled slaw and tomato sauce in every combination we tried were wonderful. We got a pitcher of the tamarind water and split a chicken and cheese papusa while deciding on two combination platters that contained a papusa, crispy yucca fries and enchiladas and tacos. Yucca was crispy outside and tender inside. And once covered in that pickled slaw and sauce made a meal all its own. The enchilada platter was more like a traditional tostada. Flat, crisp, covered in perfectly seasoned meat and sprinkled with cheese. The pork, bean and cheese papusa was simply the best. 
Papusas are a steal at around $ each with heaping platters starting at $8. 
Fill your belly for cheap and leave so happy. Don't let the looks fool you. This place is a diamond in the rough."}
{"text":"Bon dans l'ensemble, mais leur Horchata n'est pas la meilleur selon moi: trop de grumeaux dans le fond. Pupusas très bons! Staff gentil mais un peu mêlé. Impossible de prendre seulement un breuvage, même si on y vient au milieu de l'après-midi. Pas de wifi."}
{"text":"This El Salvadorian restaurant is amazing, the service is great, there is outdoor seating. It is very cozy and we come here often, I recommend trying the drink Horchata."}
{"text":"Cute restaurant with a street side terrace. Friendly staff. Great Horchata and Papusas."}
{"text":"Sweet cozy sunken sunlit window-wrapped spot on St Zotique with some of the best smiles and pupusas in a highly pupusa-populated area. Incredibly tasty, fresh and super affordable, I would highly recommend this spot, especially on cold winter days when a little heat is what's needed. 

The burritos, plantains, sangria are all delicious but the standout for me are the pupusas - not greasy at all, and the homemade pickled cabbage and peppers with hot sauce piled on top take me to my happy place."}
{"text":"So inexpensive!  A new food experience for me as I had never previously tried the traditional El Salvadorian dish `papusa` - A maize flour-dough disk filled with a selection of ingredients such as black beans and chicken. Topped off with a lot of tomato sauce and some spicy garlic sauce. Super yummy!

It was a nice, filling and satisfying sit down meal on the mega cheap. Yay!"}
{"text":"Price is fine many option for the food. I know this place since 28 years now and the taste the same since then. Good to try for those who dont know the salvadorian food in villeray area. Nice neighbor hood with a lot of place to eat."}
{"text":"I am pleased to report that on my second visit to La Carreta, the experience was much improved!

I visited with another friend, and this time we tried some of the combos on the menu.  I went for the Combo Vegetariano which comes with fried plantains, yuca fries, and a choice of pupusas - I took the queso y frijol (cheese and black bean) pupusa.

The pupusa was miles ahead of the previous ones I ate here - the cheese was salty, flavourful, cheesy :), the beans were savoury and exciting!  I tried the curtido and the salsa, and they definitely had a distinct flavour, none of the blandness from the last visit.  Normally I like to eat my pupusas plain, it allows me to analyze the specific flavour, without the condiments overpowering or masking the taste.

At my companion's suggestion, and after having tried the curtido and salsa on their own, I finally tried combining all the components together, and was pleased with the result.  I still plan on eating these pupusas plain, because at least I now know they have a good flavour on their own.  I am glad to know that I can always augment this with the extra condiments!


My friend tried the Combo Enchilada which is an enchilada with a choice of meat, avocado, or black beans, a choice of pupusas, and yuca fries.  My friend took the avocado enchilada option, and chose the pollo con queso (chicken and cheese) pupusa.

She really enjoyed the chicken and cheese pupusa, and the yuca fries.  She was very happy with the meal, and especially enjoyed the combination of curtido, salsa, and pupusa.


La Carreta only accepts cash and Interac (debit) cards, but be advised that you can't tip on the debit card machine, so tips have to be in cash.


In my previous review I singled out the horchata as the one redeeming feature of the meal, I just want to acknowledge that it is still delicious as ever!  I'm glad I gave La Carreta a second chance, I'm happy to be proven wrong!"}
{"text":"Très bon, jai pris le combo 2 pastel, pupusa et yuca frit. La seule critique que j'aurais cest quil n'y avait pas assez de yuca frit a mon gout. Ca rechauffe durant les froides soirées d'automne."}
{"text":"Je donnes deux étoiles pour l'ambiance agréable mais j'ai été énormément déçu par leur pupusas qui n'avaient guère de goût, éviter le porc a tout prix."}
{"text":"I love this place! It's my go to spot since its in my  neighbourhood. The pupusa's are fantastic! Fresh, authentic and the flavours are amazing. I love that they bring you a giant mason jar of spicy  coleslaw with your meal."}
{"text":"My favorite place for Pupusas, try the Yuca con chicharrón.  I'm from El Salvador and the Pupusas here are just like if you where there."}
{"text":"Saveurs authentiques et repas copieux. Endroit idéal pour petit ou grand groupe. \"Horchata\" et \"pupusas\" à l'honneur avec plusieurs choix de garnitures. Dessert et café disponible pour bien finir une bonne soirée entre amis ou en famille. Commande par téléphone disponible si on est un petit peu à la course."}
{"text":"Probablement mon coup de coeur éternel ! Je connais ce resto depuis 1998 et j'y vais même depuis que j'ai quitté Montréal. Goûtez la spécialité de la maison,soit les pupusas mélange à trois !

Longue vie à ce resto Salvadorien !"}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this restaurant and we really enjoyed  the pupusa and yuca fries. The horchata was also nice. The service is extremely friendly and the price is reasonable. On a cold day, if the patrons come in and out, it could very get cold, so dress warmly!"}
{"text":"Wow ! C'est divin !!!
J'étais inquiète vu les commentaires Google,  comme quoi personne ne parlait français - anglais ...
Mais c'était génial !  Le personnel est très courtois,  les pupussa sont délicieux et ça ne coûte tellement pas cher !!!  j'y retourne sans hésiter !"}
{"text":"First time trying out pupusas and it was very good! We ordered 6 different kinds to take out. It came with a very, VERY sour cabbage salad which i didn't particularly enjoy and a tomato coulis. Very cheap eats if you ask me. I can't wait to come back and try what's on their menu!"}
