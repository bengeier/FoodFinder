{"text":"I rate four stars for great, five for spectacular.

I can't rave enough about this place. It's not just the food, but the whole experience. 

I had pork ribs with a side of baked beans and potato salad. The pork ribs had a great smoky taste and were tender. The beans were baked to perfection.  The potato salad was not my fav, and a bit cold. My friend had the pulled pork sandwich with slaw. The pulled pork was pretty darn tasty (highly recommend). Slaw was ok.

The service was friendly. The interior is decorated nicely, and plenty of tables.

I'd definitely will be back again."}
{"text":"The food here is real authentic BBQ. It's not cheap but it's worth it. The restaurant is small and you do get styrofoam plates and plastic forks, but who cares. The owner is a military vet and is extremely nice. I've ate BBQ all over the USA and would rate it probably my favorite. If you're looking to be waited on by white glove servers this won't be for you. But if you want a great BBQ sandwich you will love it and you will come back!"}
{"text":"I have to agree the wait is a bit much, but when you have a pedigree like Jim Neeley from Memphis, or the good ol' USMC, you have to give kudos.  Gunny, I love ya'

Keep up the good que"}
{"text":"I saw this place as I was driving to the library the other day.  Today, my wife & I decided to give it a try...we were bored of Buckeye's other offerings.  We were immediately pleased when google turned up their website (which offers a nice background story, menu, & contact info).  We called & ordered our food to go.

Here is a run down of what we got & how we liked it...

Chopped pork sandwich - tender smoky pork shoulder, with just enough sweet/smoky sauce, on a nice size bun - very very tasty, not a hint of fat chunks in the pork, juicy, delicious.

Hot link sandwich - thinly sliced hot links smothered in spicy bbq sauce, served in a styro container with white bread on the side - quite nice, a little spicy, great sauce, fun to build your own sandwich with the bread, felt very \"back yard cook out.\"

Fries - reminiscent of Wendy's - very good & cooked perfectly.

BBQ Chicken - drenched in bbq sauce but not suffocating the flavor of the chicken, a full half bird - tender, juicy, great portion, tasted great with the sauce.

Pork Ribs - 3 bones served as part of a combo with the chicken - falling right off the bone, smoky, tender, nice spice combined with the taste of the sweet/smoky sauce.

Potato Salad - perfect consistency, not mushy, creamy, veggies still a bit crunchy, didn't taste store bought (though may have been) - yum.

Beans - dark bbq style beans, sweet & spicy with a little smokiness, studded with delectable morsels of pork - I could eat a bowl of these alone with some corn bread & be completely satisfied.

As you can tell, we rather enjoyed this new little joint.  It actually made me stop missing Famous Dave's back in Chandler, and that's saying something.  They've got great flavor & give out huge portions, at a fair price.  They definitely have the down home feeling nailed.  We will surely be going back.  It's funny to think that with all the new commercial development going up near the freeway, we'd find a gem back in old downtown.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Really? is this what we call BBQ, The name \"Memphis\" shouldn't even be mentioned on a restaurant like this, wow! what a disgrace, let me explain. First when I got there the girl at the register acted as if she didn't even know the menu, and then could'nt understand my order or a request that I asked for, the owner was back there cooking but didn't acknowledge me as customer (which is bad business!), so when I finally tasted the food, I was sorely dissappointed, the rib tips tasted old and rubbery and like they were shipped from somewhere, the cole slaw was nasty and old tasting, and the fries were less than sub par-I can go on and on but I'll keep it short. This place should be ashamed for giving there customers slop .

Why such a review? Well honesty is the best outcome, and I'm just being honest and people should know what they will get if they go to this place. Also I think now more than ever money is not easy to come by, and this is what the owner should keep closely in mind when serving and advertising what is to be good food when it is absolutely not, if I wanted bad food I could get it from the garbage I should'nt have to waste my gas and get it from a restaurant. So my recommendation for BBQ would be to either do it yourself or invest your money with Honeybears BBQ here in town.

Quality: sub-par
Sauce: no good, chemical taste
Fries: not good
Meat: no go! why? perhaps the owner warms it up in the microwave (really?)
Advice: if a restaurant is empty, then that is your clue to go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Are you kidding! BBQ? I don't think so by a long shot, this place is a laughing stock, but first let me explain how I ended up at this place, earlier today I really had a taste for some good food, preferrably BBQ, and since I know Memphis,TN is known for good BBQ Ithought I would give this place a try, so I did, and when I got there I should of known-when a restaurant is empty thats' not good, so I went ahead and ordered, and the lady clerk acted if she didn't even know the menu or could understand an order or request, so to make a long story short this place honestly is no good! the rib tips tasted old and rubbery, and  like they were pre packaged from somewhere, the cole slaw tasted old and nasty-I can go on and on but I could take all day on this joint.

I think honesty is the best outcome for anything, and I'm being honest about this restaurant, the food is nasty, and taste nothing like real BBQ not to mention Memphis, I wouldn't even put the name \"Memphis\" on my restaurant if I'm serving slop to my customers, money is too hard to come by these days to only get ripped off by a penny-with-a hole in it restaurant. I know good food and where to get it here in Arizona, but I tried to expand my experience but got messed over! Zero stars, and I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"Best BBQ I have eaten since the last time I was in Tennessee!  

Owner is very friendly and the BBQ is so good I can't even describe how good it is.

Coleslaw is delicious and very sweet! 

Only place for BBQ in the valley!!! 

Cons:

My clothes smell like BBQ after eating there!"}
{"text":"Consistently great BBQ. The baked beans as a side are incredibly flavorful. Everything I've tried here is spot on. The house made BBQ sauce is a great combination of sweet and spicy. Anyone that loves great BBQ can't go wrong coming out to this great location."}
{"text":"this place is still in business and loving it all the time
it has just move to Estrella blvd in front of Wallmart so more people could enjoy there great cooking"}
{"text":"Just tried Memphis BBQ and was pleasantly surprised.  Enjoyed a very tender pork bbq on a small bun with excellent bbq sauce and cole slaw.
We are definitely returning to try other items on their extensive menu.  However, as a new location (having recently moved from Buckeye), some of the employees are still learning the ropes.  Once the break in period is over, this is going to be a favorite place for us."}
{"text":"As a transplanted Southerner, I have to say that Memphis Best is the best barbeque I've had since moving to the desert.

I was expecting to have to give the place the benefit of the doubt - I was craving a turkey sandwich, and the true test of a barbeque joint - as anyone knows - is the pulled pork.

This turkey sandwich was beyond amazing, though.  Smoked & cooked to a consistency beyond smooth, perfectly complimented by the house barbeque sauce and the soft, just-barely-mushy-but-still-holdable-bun - delicious!  

The coleslaw was a little lacking, but other than that - perfect.  Also, their potato salad here is delicious - just the right balance between sweet and savory, creamy and chunky.  Highly recommended.

The only downside about this place being a true Memphis experience is the lack of sides - I like my barbeque with greens or mac and cheese or any of the other sides served at barbeque joints in other regions, and just like in Memphis, the sides here are fairly limited."}
{"text":"Not bad, not great. Good portions...  but I still prefer Famous Daves over any BBQ place I've been to."}
{"text":"Great food!  Nice staff, nothing fancy but down to earth, which is perfect for a bbq joint!  I usually don't mention stuff like this but thought it was strange that the decor was decent (the tables have that shiny tinge to them) but the food is served on styrofoam.  It just didn't match.

But you're not here to listen to me talk about their decor.  Hubby got the pulled pork and it was delicious.  We're from south Texas so we know pulled pork!  Well, mostly him; HE knows pulled pork.  It was so good he said it gave him heartburn!  (He doesn't usually eat to the point of getting heartburn!)

I had the pork ribs, half rack ... very meaty and the sauce was AWESOME.  Wasn't as sweet as most places which I liked.  I ate my husband's potato salad because it was that good (I'm pretty picky about my potato salads).  My 13mo old daughter had a hot dog and she ate up the whole dog.  The fries were also pretty tasty!!  I didn't care much for the baked beans but I'm not really a baked beans kind of person.  I would say the baked beans were par with other places.

I would definitely give this place another go ... and another.  We really felt like having bbq and didn't want to drive 45 minutes+ for it so when I found this place on Yelp, I knew I had to give it a try ... and I wasn't disappointed!"}
{"text":"This place left me asking what I got for my money.  I took my wife and two of the girls.  The place was clean but the staff was not very friendly.  We spent about $30 for four of us to eat dinner on stryrofoam plates.  The quality of the food was ok but nothing special.  I am sure that we will not return.  I am sure with the economy the way it is that we can do better than this!"}
{"text":"Great food here. Super meaty ribs and tasty sauce.  I was impressed with the rib meal. Bought a rack to take home as well."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious!!! The best BBQ pulled pork sandwich I've had since I visited Memphis, TN a couple of years ago. Also had the BBQ chicken wings and the sweet green tea!!! Perfect amount of spicy and sweetness! Keep up the good work!!! Semper Fi!"}
{"text":"So, what qualifies me to rave about this place?

I lived in the south for a long time, and have had BBQ of every variety- East Carolina,  the several variants of Georgia and Florida styles, Texas, Memphis, Cincinnati, St Louis, Arkansas, and KC style BBQ;  at places reknown and obscure, including the lamb barbeque served at Moonlite BBQ of Ownesboro, KY.  I don't think there's a genuine BBQ place up and down I-75/85/95 whose food I haven't sampled, having been married to a Southerner who insisted on trying them all.

I've eaten it off of china, paper and styro plates,  out of to go boxes, in red and white checked paper boats or plastic baskets lined with wax paper  and even served on a tray with compartments reminiscent of a prisoner's chow line  in Fayetteville, Georgia where it came standard with white bread, brunswick stew, bread and butter pickles, and nary a vegetable. I have eaten BBQ smoked on an open trailer pulled by a truck and sold only \"to go,\" and on a roadside picnic table next to an enclosed trailer with a smoker out back on an undeveloped lot. On weekend nights, I have bought my BBQ curbside from someone smoking meat on the street in front of their house  in  a neighborhood of Daytona known as The Bottoms; a place where white folks like myself didn't go without a friend who was a local riding alongside me.  

At least a hundred different BBQ joints tried out over a span of ten plus years, and that was only after \"prescreening\" the places for authenticity. When I left the south, I thought I left real bbq for the rest of my life.  Not so any more.

 The meat here is sublime, cooked to perfection, and brimming with the flavor that only slow smoking and tender oversight can produce. The side dishes are the real deal- where else you going to get greens and mac and cheese from scratch?People whose idea of BBQ is Damon's, Tony Roma's, Chili's, and other chains won't get it, but true devotees always will.  If you want the genuine article, go to Memphis Best.

 Obviously Memphis Best offers something that no one else is putting out in the Valley.  Goodyear might not be the gastronomic epicenter of the Phoenix metro area, but it's worth the drive out to taste this food.  So, drive out to Goodyear, support your BBQ habit, support local business people, support a veteran who served his country and most of all support your soul with  authentic down home food in Maricopa County."}
{"text":"I wish people would relax- complaining about styrofoam plates and the like- must be BBQ neophytes.  BBQ is an art form and the best cannot be mass produced, period. It has to be hand crafted, like the best beer. Would you rather the restaurant owner focus on your meat or running dishes through the washer?

At least a hundred different BBQ joints tried out over a span of ten plus years, and that was only after \"prescreening\" the places for authenticity. For years I swore the best of them all was Tom Jrs. in Boynton Beach, a tiny shack next to the railroad that made melt in your mouth greens and everything from scratch. (The owner was the son of the famous Tom of Tom's BBQ in the southern Palm Beach area of Delray/Boca Raton.) Well, at least I thought it was the best, but Memphis BBQ of Buckeye has given Tom Jr. a run for first place. 

Given the fact that I live here in AZ now, I'll take the commute to Memphis Best BBQ over Palm Beach County any day. The meat here is sublime, cooked to perfection, and brimming with the flavor that only slow smoking and tender oversight can produce. People whose idea of BBQ is Damon's, Tony Roma's, Chili's, and other chains won't get it, but true devotees always will.

The most amazing thing is that here I am, a transplanted easterner who grew up in the shadow of NY and bounced around the south for nearly two decades, who buys a house in the far end of Maricopa County, yet I wind up in a town that not only has a genuine BBQ joint in town, but also a real NY Pizza joint (a different review altogether.)  For those of you who have had access to either of those oft mimicked but seldom duplicated foods, finding real smoked BBQ is like finding the grail.
Who cares how long it takes the staff to serve it or what it's served on, it still beats having to go without."}
{"text":"Ordering now, hope it's as good as it was in Buckeye! 
(Will edit review after eating from new location)
1/26/2012 - Thanks for the reminder to complete the review.  Just as good, if not better since they are closer to home now!  - We ordered to go, we both chose the 2 meat combo's:  Mine - Pulled Pork & Chopped Beef, Wife's - Beef & Pork ribs with the sides.  All was very tender, flavorful and enough for 2 meals for each of us.  Normally I prefer pork, but the beef on this visit was more flavorful.  The ribs were meaty and tender.  The staff is friendly, the larger dinning room is a nice change from Buckeye as well.  We will certainly be back soon!"}
{"text":"Delicious!! I love the mom and pop atmosphere. My favorite place to eat in Buckeye."}
{"text":"Simply the best BBQ I've had in Arizona."}
{"text":"Figured we'd have a nice meal in lieu of Valentine's Day yesterday (chances of getting a decent table anywhere that evening would have been pretty much f-all). The wife suggested Melting Pot but that place is overkill unless you're on the pull or made of money, not to mention the fact that heading north up the 17 from Thomas during peak hour is an exercise in futility. Looked around in the Goodyear area, thinking maybe we could hit up Tomo Sushi, but Yelp highlighted this BBQ place that we'd never been to before. Hadn't had BBQ in a while so.. ziggity zam!

Got there about 6:30. Okay-sized place. About maybe 10 tables, two of which were occupied at the time. Chairs were high and a little wobbly, wasn't sure about that at first.. The wife got a pulled pork sandwich, I got the beef ribs (a rack of 4-5, they're BIG) and the young 'un got a pork sandwich kids meal. My chosen sides were baked beans and collard greens, and some cornbread. While we waited for the meal we tried not to choke on the smoker fumes. This place is in SERIOUS need of more enhanced ventilation. I'm sitting here at home now, absolutely REEKING of BBQ smoke, just like a previous reviewer pointed out. Meals came out and mine was very, very good. I liked both of my sides, even the collards which I haven't had for years (previously I had them microwaved out of a frozen pak - these were MUCH better than that). The beans weren't as sweet and sugary as I've had at places like Pork on a Fork or Famous Dave's - which is a good thing. BBQ sauce was plentiful. Wife liked her meal, kid finished his too, along with his mac and cheese side. Downsides: 1) The smoke - they need industrial fans or SOMETHING, my voice was almost catching in my throat because of it. 2) Every five minutes there was a ridiculously loud chopping noise as they busted up the ribs or chopped the pork or whatnot. I get that that's how this all works but still, the ambience suffers as a result. Perhaps they could invest in a nice electric knife such as are used to carve meat off gyro spits? (shrug) Finally, 3) the cornbread was just okay - nowhere near as good as Famous Daves or Marie Callendars, but I'm not a big cb fan to begin with so I didn't really mind.

Just after seven, people started crowding in and the joint got going. Obviously it's a local favourite. Strangely, most people chose to eat in. Guess they were all happy to have the smoker smell as their take-out? *8-) Eyed the Baskin Robbins across the way as we walked outside. Tempting, but not with two pounds of beef ribs sitting like a bowling ball in my gut. I pity my sigmoid and balloon knot tomorrow morning.

Memphis is definitely a passable alternative to Dillons and FD's and I think we'll be back. Grabbing it to go next time, though. I won't be able to eat-in again, unless I wheel an oxygen tank in with me, or wear a hazmat mask. And disposable clothes."}
{"text":"I've been to lots of BBQ joints in Arizona, California, New Mexico and Texas over the past few years and can say that this place is decent. When my wife and I went in this joint, were were surprised by the inexpensive prices. The restaurant smells great but can be a little smokey. The two sizes of sandwiches met our needs and tasted great. I've had better BBQ in the past, but this is great local taste. ."}
{"text":"The food is delicious. The chicken was nice and tender and the corn bread was perfectly warm and yummy. 
The restaurant is clean and pretty with nice decor."}
{"text":"It is my firm belief that Small hole in the Wall BBQ/ Southern places should be given their own set of common customer service rules...I have noticed the small places seem to go at their own pace, forget and change orders midstream and frequently end up treating you like you are visiting at their home not their restaurant. 
Memphis has this type of feel. We got there right at opening and that created \"speedbumps\" , still counting change,  putting chairs down , food not made yet...but the good news is this place is delicious in my book. 
After finally getting our order straightened out ...I had yummy Beef ribs with a lovely pink ring that scream I have been smoked.  the coleslaw was unususua and I loved it ...guess what it was mustard based..loved the taste and the sweet sour effect of sugar in the dressing with the mustard.  husband had the Pulled pork but it wasn't quite as yummy as my ribs, he didn't adore the sugary bbq sauce that had a peppery back kick. Oh well  guess he should have gotten the ribs.  
So the  next  time you are in Buckeye stop  bye  and give it a try ."}
{"text":"Great Que, and great service. Greens were great, Mac was great. Only complaint was that everything was drenched in sauce. I'll ask for it on the side next time."}
{"text":"Good to fair - 3 stars.  Nice big portions. The meat was pretty dry (both the pulled beef and the pulled pork).  I liked the \"mustardy cole slaw\" - the wife thought it was too sweet.  Sauce was okay for me - too sweet for her.  Both agreed there was no cheese flavor to the mac and cheese.  Good french fries - but the \"Memphis\" barbeque?  Think I'll try elsewhere."}
{"text":"Update: As of 9 June, Memphis Best is only open Thursday-Saturday, 1100-2000. Gunny says they're shifting their emphasis to catering over the summer. Whether he'll go back to Mon-Sat in the fall remains to be seen."}
{"text":"As a Texan with a serious craving for smoked barbecue, I was hoping for a five star meal.  Well, not quite.  

First let me start with the owner and chief cook is a retired Marine.  Thank you for not only serving our country, but devoting a huge part of your life to keeping the bad guys at bay.   I would continue to patronize this business for this reason alone.  He is very nice to visit with when there is a lull in the customer line.  There was a steady flow of customers.  Probably half of the customers were fire and EMT staff from various departments while I was eating.

The new restaurant was spotless and smelled great.  The smoker is in the center back of the open kitchen with firewood stacked beside it.  The wait staff is young, but closely supervised from the kitchen.  There is no permanent sign outside yet, but they are in the Goodyear super Walmart complex near I10 in the south east corner of the parking lot next to a beauty supply store.

The food is good, you will not be disappointed.  I was hoping for fantastic.  The first sign there might be trouble was when I saw two microwave ovens above the prep table.  That is never good.  Microwaves dry and toughen proteins.  Nothing destroys perfectly cooked food faster than a microwave oven.

I ordered a sampler plate of pulled pork, chopped beef brisket, smoked sausage, pork and beef ribs.  Sides were baked beans, potato salad and coleslaw.  Everything was served in take out Styrofoam.   The meats were in a large container swimming in barbecue sauce.  Good sauce, but way too much.  I'll ask for sauce on the side next time.  

The pulled pork was excellent.  Great taste, tender and moist.  The chopped beef brisket was chewy and dry tasting even though sitting in sauce.  The ribs were delicious and fall off the bone tender - in the middle.  The ends were tough and dry.  Except for the pulled pork, this is what is expected from microwaved food.  

The potato salad was OK.  It tasted like commercial bought product.  The beans were tasty but the texture was very mushy.  I suspect they were canned beans with added ingredients.  

Throw out the microwaves, reheat proteins in an oven or griddle, make the sides from scratch and this will be a Yelp 5+ star restaurant.  I'll be spending my money here again.  Fix these issues and you'll get lots more of my money."}
{"text":"Badly needed BBQ placed on Estrella, hard to find BBQ on west side.
POSITIVES:
Another Plus: Owned/Operated by a  Veteran Retired Marine!
Place was clean we were greeted well.  
They were in the middle of filling a huge Catering order out the side door, so service was a little slow, but not unacceptable for a BBQ place.
Food was Hot and  ~OK~  We really wanted to like it! 
 Meat was a little on the dry side (I had 2 meat combo with pulled beef and Rib Tips. 
 Rib tip portions were huge and very good meat.
 Wife had Beef sandwich which was HUGE! but needed more BBQ sauce (see rant below)  
Mac and Cheese was my favorite dry-type (ie not dripping with sauce)  and had a good flavor!
Negatives:
Neither Wife Nor I ate our Collard Greens, which we both normally LOVE, they were sour and just didn't taste good.  
I can live with the paper plates, etc, but absolutely hate being sold BBQ sauce in 2oz portions. there was no BBQ out on tables, and only one flavor (which is spicy-Vinegar-y, but perfect for me!)  Put the sauce out on the tables!  we paid $29.75 for lunch for 2, there should be enough margin to relax the cost control on the sauce!"}
{"text":"Best BBQ in Buckeye, AZ! 'Nuff said!"}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of barbecue.  I never have been.  Perhaps it's because I've never tasted authentic barbecue cookin'.  So when friends ranted and raved about how good Memphis Best BBQ was, I was not the least bit interested in trying it out.

Well, their obsession with \"Memphis Barbecue\" (as they tenderly refer to it) ignited my curiosity, so I decided to give it a try.

Parking is not that great, but as you enter the tiny restaurant it's literally like stepping through a portal into Memphis, Tennessee.  The walls are decorated with jazz paintings and other things that I can't remember; it made me feel relaxed as though I were at a jazz club sans a live band.

A friend recommended I call in the order so it'd be ready upon my arrival, so I did.  I ordered a \"6 Pack\" of chopped beef with a side of beans.  I also ordered a side of their spicy barbecue sauce.  The order was ready right as I walked in and I was able to pay without any hassle.

The food was freakin' awesome!!  The spicy barbecue made it even better.  The beans were very tasty as well.  I was very pleased.  Now I'm the one rantin' and ravin' about the place!

My only complaint is that my house is far from their location, and I'm unable to eat there more often.

I don't care if the parking is awkward or if I have to wait more than I'd like to get the food; my concern is with the cleanliness of the restaurant and taste of the food.  And both those two concerns of mine were met with superior satisfaction.  Plus, the owner is extremely friendly!

If you don't mind driving all the way to Buckeye, do it for Memphis Best BBQ.  You will not be disappointed.  :-)"}
{"text":"Let me start off by stating this: my 9 year-old son is the pickiest eater in the western United States. That said, he ate EVERYTHING and LOVED it!!!!! I knew he would eat his sandwich (pulled pork) but, he actually ate the beans and asked for more!!! I'm telling you, this kid wouldn't eat baked beans if it was the last bit of food on Earth. 
The meat and sauce is absolutely delicious. The sides are to die for and the cornbread...MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm!
This is my new favorite place for dinner. Absolutely the BEST bbq around!"}
{"text":"I love this place! I went in today after smelling the goodness while driving by. The owner is a really nice guy, and he pretty much greets everyone as they come in. If he doesn't, then whomever is working the register will. I ordered the beef rib dinner with beans and greens. I got it to go, and it had my car smelling so good!  But, driving with barbecue sauce all over your face hasn't been the in thing to do since 92, so I waited. The rib portions are huge! The greens were excellent, I didn't even need to hot sauce them up. The beans were wonderful as well. It was hard for me to stop eating any of it. 

So if your looking for a place to get some good BBQ, I highly recommend this place !!"}
{"text":"Smelled REALLY good, looked REALLY good but wasn't able to get any!  :(

Went today, Saturday, at 2:00 and waited in line for 15 mins without moving.  People were coming in behind me and leaving because it was taking WAY too long. Other people who had ordered and were waiting for their food were also upset because they were having to wait too long. Couldn't even take a menu because they were out. 

Will give it a second chance, maybe during the week or see if they accept carry out calls."}
{"text":"Don't get all the early hate on this place or maybe they changed their ways with some of the earlier tips. I came in and ordered a large pulled pork sandwich Memphis style and sat back to enjoy the military / family themed place unfolding in front of me. The smoker was in full tune and what seemed to be father and daughter worked on the orders coming in. It took me less than 6 minutes to get my BBQ meal so I don't get the complaining about time restraints and surely the food was worth the wait when it comes to BBQ options in Goodyear. When I finally sunk into my meal it was tangy with a kick and super delicious. Everything about the experience was good, and everything delivered with good timing and a genuine smile. I think this place will be a hit if more people swing by and the food is defiantly both good and outside of the normal.

The only con I had was that I left the place after maybe 7 minutes and smelled like smoked BBQ for the next 8 hours even after a shower. I wish there was some way around this but for BBQ that good the juice is worth the squeeze."}
{"text":"Had the ribs (pork) with a buddy.  They were good!  Easy enough to find - pretty popular place.  Good, not great.  Good enough for a quick BBQ fix!"}
{"text":"I rated this place one star because while it was open, it was TERRIFIC, but now if you go all you get is an empty building. There just wasn't enough business here to keep it open. Sad sad sad. I'll miss you, Memphis Best BBQ. Good luck at your other location in the east valley."}
{"text":"Ribs! This place is the real deal with Ribs and authentic Memphis BBQ. Note: If you're looking for your typical restaurant fare this aint it. This is down home stick to your insides BBQ. Rib tips are just that and for those of us who savor the crunch, its all there. Darryl Alexander is the owner operator, a true BBQ pioneer and southern gentleman! 

Now for some pro's and con's. Pro's - They have collared greens and mac & cheese. Con's they are not popular with most folks in AZ so they tend to run out. Con - They are in Buckeye which is a bit of a drive for me. Pro's they are moving to Estrella Parkway in Goodyear soon which means more business and thus....more greens and mac & cheese.

If you grew up on soul food and/or crave authentic Memphis BBQ you have to go to this place. I'll be catering my next business luncheon here as well. My rack of ribs (one order) was more than enough to feed four!!"}
{"text":"Definitely the best BBQ that I've had in Arizona. Will be going back for sure."}
{"text":"Huge portions of fabulous bbq...the dinners are enough for two adults tho u wont want to share! The orders can take a little while but its well worth it! Love the chopped pork and baby back ribs! Huge chicken wings!"}
{"text":"Simple down to earth BBQ. Absolutely delicious meals cooked up and brought out. Staff is friendly, owner is the cook(very polite gentleman), and the BBQ he serves up is by far the best in the west valley! Myself and my team from work will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Food is great! Miss this place being in Buckeye... excellent service!"}
{"text":"Best BBQ ever!!!, I live in Verrado, and trust me it worth the drive to downtown, to get some!!"}
{"text":"Delicious BBQ! Tangy rich sauce and fresh hot meat. Friendly people.
And who cares if it's Styrofoam and paper towels vs china and linen napkins: the food is great, who cares what it's on.
I had the chopped pork with beans and fries. Kids had pork rib tips (awesome) and a really well prepared hot dog off the kids menu. My husband got the sampler. If you aren't really hungry, it's a meal for three. It's a great idea for your first visit (with two people).
I will be back."}
{"text":"Go to this place, eat here, you will love it!  My husband and I ate at Memphis Best BBQ tonight and it couldn't have been better!  We both had a chopped pork sandwich and shared a large order of fries.  The sandwiches were huge and the large order of fries more than enough to share.  The service was very friendly and the prices reasonable for the amount of food.  The sauce they serve was fabulous and home made, a little sweet and a little spicy.  They brought us extra for our sandwiches and we practically drank it!  We have had BBQ all over the country and this ranks at the top.  We can't wait to go back and try some more things on the menu."}
