{"text":"Horrible food and rude staff. It's so bad there that they out signs out saying if you fun the food is cold or not fresh to ask the waitress for a plate of new food to be brought to your table. Except none of the waitresses speak enough English for this. Our food was cold so we asked for a new serving as per the sign--the cook came out and said there was nothing wrong and that he didn't care. We asked to speak to a manager or owner, and were denied. If you want bad food and crazy staff, go here for sure."}
{"text":"No. 1 Asian Buffet is your typical Chinese food buffet. It is one of the more desirable buffets that has a nice diversified offer of delectable foods. You can't beat their lunch price! $5.49....the price, in itself, makes the visit even more pleasant. The ambiance is quiet & quite comfortable. Hospitality is very good, which makes the whole dining out experience quite delightful. #satisfiedcustomer"}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible! The only good thing they had was the roast beef, and it was cold. How can you go wrong with hot and sour soup? I have no clue, but they do. None of the \"Chinese\" offerings are any good, and slim pickings at that. Last time I was there a Thai friend recommended it and it was delicious, but that was about 10 years ago. Things sure have changed. I was embarrassed that I told my friend they were really good. Don't waste your time and money. Awful!!!   Yelp asks: Good for: NOTHING"}
{"text":"What can I say it's a belly filler kind of dig.  It was pretty crowded.  For $7.99 all you can eat you get what you pay for.  I don't see myself returning.  I just didn't find anything I really liked.  When they first opened they were really good.  Quality has gone down over the years.  Lunch seems like a better deal $5.49 per person.  On a positive note they are pretty fair on drink prices."}
