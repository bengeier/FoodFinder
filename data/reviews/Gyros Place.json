{"text":"OMG! You would think that if you've been to one Gyro restaurant, you been to them all, but not so! 
I've been to almost every Greek restaurant in the East Valley from the one at McKellips and Greenfield to the one at Val Vista and Baseline but Gyro Place at Power & McKellips stands Heads above all the rest. 
The flavor & the quantity of their foods including all meats, hummus and salads wiill never disappoint. The unbelievable quality of the service will be consistently over the top and Maggie will treat you like family every visit. 
If you haven't tried Gyro Place, for wahtever reason, you owe it to yourself to give a try for lunch or dinner. They are the best."}
{"text":"I tooo love this place.  Just recently found it and have lived in the area for more than 15 years off and on.  

I love the tri tip kabob plate with the rice.  The hummas is tasty and the bahklava is flaky.  

Great place for the value.  They have also started delivery service in the are during selct hours.

Try them out, you wont be disappointed."}
{"text":"Ordered from Gyro's Place for 3 people to be delivered.    Took 2 hours for the food to arrive and it was stone cold.   The restaurant is not that far from our office.    Thankfully, they did not make us pay.       The lamb gyro was super rubbery and inedible.      Will not try this place again."}
{"text":"I am angry this place does not have 5 stars. The food was AMAZING. SO AMAZING I INSTALLED YELP TO WRITE THIS REVIEW!
The amount of food for the price is nothing short of generous. We ordered 2 gyro combos and the meat is superb and makes the sandwich HEAVY. The sauce is perfection and there is no such thing...but if there was...this sandwich would have \"too much\" meat. Highly, HIGHLY freaking recommended."}
{"text":"Great place to get gyros!!! It's a small place about 5 tables inside and cozy.  Our second time here and we left full and happy.  I got the gyro sandwich combo with the greek salad ($1) more but it's worth it.  My yobo got the gyro with the fries and my Jazzy got the jr version of the sandwich.  We tried the dolmas (veg) stuff grape leaves.  It was just ok, but not for me. I'm gonna be returning and try other things. See ya soon."}
{"text":"Overall, this is very good place. We've eaten here at least 25 times and were always happy. The chicken kabobs are consistently very good and the salad and tzatziki sauce is always really fresh. Request extra tzatziki if you like it, very well worth it and tastes freshly made.The prices are good and, it's likely the best Greek food in the East Valley. Don't expect much atmosphere since this is mainly a take-out place."}
{"text":"Awesome ., this is the \"hole in the wall\" I have read about.. Made the drive and glad I did.. Very small inside but food was real deal. Lamb carved off the spit for gyros. Will return."}
{"text":"Love this place - hidden gem. Great Greek food, reasonable prices. And by Chicago Greeks as a bonus. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Some of the  best Greek food around  the Gryo was awesome  had the lamb gryo and fries .you have to try this place .nice decor staff very nice .and very reasonable prices  check it out"}
{"text":"RUDE, RUDE, RUDE! I was waiting for my food when the customer in front of me was completely yelled at and humiliated by the staff. I guess she saw them drop a bag of fries on the ground then scoop them up and serve them. She asked if any of them actually touched the ground. That's when one of the guys came from around the corner yelling \"You accusing us of being dirty?! Here take your $2 back!!\" The customer replied \" No, I wasn't accusing you of anything, I would like the fries but just want to make sure they didn't actually thouch the ground.\" He continued to yell at her for implying they were dirty. I felt so bad for her. I know I won't be returning to this place and I'm positive that lady won't be either. These people are seriously scary."}
{"text":"We have been here five times. We always have the same \"test\" meals to judge Greek restaurants; falafel pita, hummus and fish and chips.  They are all very good here. Delicious, freshly made fries. Don't like the woman at the counter here. May be a language barrier but I always wonder if she got the order right.

This is a small place with about six booths and a couple small outside tables."}
{"text":"This place has the best lamb gyros that i've found anywhere in the GTA. Honestly give it a try, you won't be disappointed. I have yet to try anything else there. The meat is fabulous, nicely charred, thinly sliced. I really hope they don't go out of business like the other business at this building before. I'm a customer for life."}
{"text":"Happened to be in the area with an hour to kill around lunchtime and stumbled across this hidden gem. Appears to be a new spot. Restaurant was clean and organized. Lots of seating. Cafeteria style ordering. The woman on the cash could have been a little more receptive. After all, we were the only paying customers in the place!  Ordered a mixed gyro on a pita (lamb, chicken and beef), a chicken souvlaki on a pita and a side order of fries. Price was a little steep but the serving was a hefty size. The meat was hot and juicy. Nicely seasoned. The pitas were fresh and the tzatziki was perfect. Enough garlic to notice but not enough to kill a vampire."}
{"text":"One of the best Greek places ever. Definitely a 5 star restaurant I always get the Greek salad or the chicken plate. The pita bread that they warm up on the grill is like icing on a cake tastes amazing. Keep up the excellent work."}
{"text":"I went to this place for lunch today. I was excited to see if it was good, cause the only other Greek place in this area, is Daphne's Greek Cafe , and My Big fat Greek wedding (which I avoid), so I was hoping Gyro's Place was going to be good..and it is!!
I ordered the regular Gyro with fies and a drink, and I love it! Their fries are Crispy on the outside and soft on the inside..well salted which I love! The gyro is packed with meat, I could make two sandwiches out of it! I only wish there was more sauce! But besides that, I am very pleased! Hope you enjoy as much as I have!"}
{"text":"Wow, I have not had this good Greek food anywhere in town. The atmosphere sucks, but then it is a small (emphasis on the small) business; better to get your food to go (I noticed the large number of people doing just that while I ate). I had the souvlaki, which they make from pork and it is amazing! The combo came with rice and salad, I dislike rice most of the time, but I cleaned my plate; even the salad went down. So I said to myself, they passed the first test, time to go to the finals. No good Greek place exists without good baklava in my opinion; well they had two, original and pistachio. I went with the pistachio and came to the realization that I never had real baklava in my entire life until that moment. I did not try the gyros, however, my sweet honey did and she enjoyed it; said it was as good as most places in town.(though she was enormously jealous of my souvlaki to which I lent her a bite) I will be returning here, if for nothing else, the baklava."}
{"text":"I love this place. They don't skimp on the meat. It's my go-to gyro spot when I'm in town."}
{"text":"Hand Down One Of The Worst Gyros I Have Had Not Sure If The People That Like This Place Have Had Other Gyros Before Or Not. I Tried A Lot Of Gyros In Other States And Other Countries Even And The Gryo Meat Here Is Not Good At All. I Honesty Didn't Want To Eat The Whole Thing."}
{"text":"Can't beat it! Great hole in the wall next to firehouse subs! Highly recommend, great owners"}
{"text":"The family that owns this place is great. They're very warm and welcoming. It's small yet they make you feel right at home. The falafel is good and the gyros are amazing. I hate tomatoes and ask for no tomatoes and I swear they add extra meat. Great place."}
{"text":"*3 Months Ago*
Second time coming here and won't be last. Both times I had the Gyros with fries, and the gyros is amazing! Never had one before, so this place has set the bar high. The lamb was very seasoned and cut in thin strips, and the fries were cut thick, almost like wedges. Service was very accommodating (they remembered my order) and clued me in on just how to pronounce gyros (yee-ros). Truly a hidden gem, but I get the feeling they have a loyal customer base. If you go, make sure to order extra sauce for your gyros!"}
{"text":"We love this place.  We always get the gyro plate #7 and order extra for leftovers.  Its one of the few things my picky son will eat."}
{"text":"worst gyro ever it was greasy, very little meat and sauce. On top of that the people were rude the lady told me I should of told her about my coupon before she rang up the order, and to not let it happen again. I would never go back."}
{"text":"So far, the best gyros I have had here since I move from Chicago. I will definitely be frequenting this place..."}
{"text":"I am SO glad this little gem is close to work. The family that owns the place is so nice and the food is so good.

It is tiny inside, it maybe seats 10 people. I usually just call in my order to go and it is ready in about 10-15 minutes.

Gyros are huge, I easily get two meals out of one."}
{"text":"Gyro was delicious.  Salad was grey and the price is right. Beats pizza and fast food anytime."}
{"text":"Our favorite Greek restaurant, we go here a few times a month. Favorite thing to order is kabob combo plate-plenty for two to share. My husband will sometimes substitute steak for gyro meat and they pile it up. Owners are awesome and friendly and know us by name. Gyro/fry combo is my sons go-to...he begs us to take him. Food always tastes fresh and delicious!"}
{"text":"We were searching for a good Gyro place in east Mesa and finally found it.  The food here is top notch.  The dining room is small and there are a few tables outside, but those don't matter because the food is great.  Give it a try when you're out that way, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Have come here several times. Ethnic Albanians, but they make great Greek good! The portions are generous, and the prices are good for what you get. This places becomes quite busy between 12 and 1.30pm. I have tried the various offerings, but the lamb is my favourite - better than the chicken, pork, and gyro. I find the dinners too filling for lunch, as I feel sleepy thereafter, so I tend to get the pitas for lunch. The place is clean and well maintained. I enjoy coming here for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"Ordered a mix chicken and lamb pita, the meat was very bland, it had almost no flavour. Greek fries were probably the best part. If the cashier was more pleasant I would of maybe gave it 2 stars. I will definitely not be returning here!"}
{"text":"Come here always. Food is so good and fresh, pitas taste like they just made them from scratch. Their French fries make McDonalds taste like peasant food."}
{"text":"i normally do not leave reviews but this place deserves one..  i live near here and i eat here due to convenience and only that.  the gyros are ok but the staff is RUDE. i always give a place 2 to 3 tries until i decide if its \"bad\" or something is wrong due to everyone may have a bad day but..

my first experience i ordered my gyro without onions..  i drive back to the office and open it up and it has onions.. i call them on the phone and i explain the issue and they said bring it back in.  so i left work (everyone else was eating), i drive back to the store and they said i did not ask for no onions and charged me to make a new one..  wasted my lunch doing this...

second experience..  i ordered a side of hummus and they forgot to put it in the bag.  i called them and again i drove Back in and they said they did Not charge me for it and charged me for it so i could take it and leave.  

i went again this week.  this time i ordered my normal gyro and i asked for an extra side of salad dressing (this is after i already have paid and was leaving).  i only had $100's in my wallet and they made me pay $.35 extra for the dressing so i let them process my debit card instead of breaking a hundred.  

this last time is the last time i will ever return, they are Very rude and treat the customers very bad.  as i sat there waiting 15 minutes for my gyro they called out to the elderly customer who placed an order in front of me saying \"SIR your food is ready!\" and when he did not reply (he was in his 80s?) they yelled even louder instead of just brining it to him 5 feet away..  then again he looked up she rudely pointed a the door and said again \"Your Food is READY!\"..   this was uncalled for and not a way to treat another person..  

if you value your money and dont waste your time dining here.  if they make a mistake you pay for it."}
{"text":"Great little place.  Not much dining space but it was perfect for getting some gyros and hummus to go.  You could certainly eat there too if you wanted to grab a quick bit on your lunch hour.  Service was fast and friendly, the gyros were flavorful, and the hummus tasted nice and fresh."}
{"text":"This place is theee best! My kids love it as well we always get the chicken shish  kabob plate and i can eat it for 2 meals. My kids like the gyros. This is my favorite Greek place!"}
{"text":"First time in here and probably last. Just wanted to check it out since it's so close to my house and I was on the way home. I go in to order a salad with a kabob to go. Guy says it will be 25 minutes if I want the kabob. Note there are 2 other people in the whole place. Okay, so I change my order to just a simple Greek salad to go. I wait, I wait some more....20 minutes later I finally get my simple salad. Seriously?? I could have made that salad in 1.2 minutes tops."}
{"text":"This is such a great ma & pa place!  Authentic Greek food, the best in Mesa.  The gyro meat is delicious,  the baklava homemade.  Our fav is the triple platter - hummus, tabouli, & baba ghanou served with pita bread.  Tastes like your yia yia just made it!"}
{"text":"Family operated and you can tell! This place is super!  Great food Great Service for over a decade.  Tiny eat-in area but still awesome.  Take out never disappoints.  Straight Up Best Gyros!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. Amazing prices for very fresh and delicious food. Simple menu means they never get your order wrong. Nice and clean, service is good. One of my favorite lunch spots, best veggie gyros and the lamb is exceptional. Salads are fresh and theres no skimping on portions. It's not a fancy place but I give it five stars for exceeding at exactly what it's meant to be - a great little Mediterranean eatery!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Great food, friendly people and super fast service. Best tzatziki sauce around!"}
{"text":"A delicious foodie find tucked in a little shopping complex (next to Firehouse Subs/Cold Stone).  I forgot how much I loved this place when I came here years ago- years later, the food and service is still great and absolutely satiated my Greek food craving!"}
{"text":"Based on the yelp reviews and since I was in the area I decided to give this place a shot. It was a little difficult to find since they are buried at the back and end of the shopping center. I had the gyro pita and fries. It was pretty good and was served hot. My only complaint was that the meat was a little greasy but they sure do give you a lot!  Not a big fry person here so I guess they were ok. I will agree with the other yelpers on the sauce though. Ask for extra."}
{"text":"I've given this place enough chances because of the proximity to my work, but I've had ENOUGH. They've managed to screw up my order almost every single time. What drove me over the edge however is I called ahead and asked for pickup. Order a simple chicken gyro on a pita with Greek fries on the side, was told it would be 10 minutes. Got there in 15 minutes and they asked for my name, and when I gave it to them they started scrambling, and looking for the receipt with my order. They had completely forgotten my call. The lady at the front desk assured me they would make the order quickly so I had a seat at the table right I front of the cooks and waited... 10 minutes go by nothing... At 15 minutes I got frustrated and asked them if the food was ready, and the girl turned around and handed me the bag with the food. \"I was sitting right in front of you! Why couldn't you have told me my food was ready?\" I told her, and she just shrugged and smiled. The sarcastic smile is what drive me over the edge. Told them all to f*** themselves and left. 

My advice is even though their food may be good at times, it's definitely not worth your hard earned money especially if they don't care. There's another AUTHENTIC Greek restaurant called Kois on Aimco where they treat you well and have amazing food."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Cozy little Greek spot with friendly owners and great food. Emphasis on little, we typically just get food to go since their 4 table are often full. Gyros are the best I've found in east Mesa, also have had the hummus and souvlaki plates and never been disappointed. Not open on Sundays so plan on coming a different day."}
{"text":"They make gyros the way I like them. You won't find any lettuce on this sandwich.  Plenty of tzatziki sauce and plenty of gyro meat.  I keep thinking I should try other things on the menu, but I can't miss the opportunity of having one of his fantastic gyros.
Gentlemen behind the counter is always friendly, greets my wife and myself with a big smile and Hello.  It's always a great meal and pleasant visit."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I have been eating at Gyro Place  for a few years and we absolutely love it. It's a very cute little family owned restaurant with a delicious selection of authentic greek food. The service itself is enough to keep us coming back. They always made it a point to remember our names and our orders even when we had only been there a few times. The food is absolutely delicious, make sure to order greek fries they are the best! Our only complaint is that we dont live closer."}
{"text":"Being a Chicago transplant, having a go to place for great gyros is a high priority. When this place was being built a number of years ago, I couldn't wait for it to open. I almost always just get a gyro with fries, but have tried other items and all were very good. The gyros here are sublime. Heaping portions of perfectly seasoned lamb with the correct portions of tomato and onions and an outstanding tzatziki sauce. I dare you to find a more satisfying meal for less than $8."}
{"text":"Pleasant find.  Hummus was fresh and tasty and gyros pita had plenty of thinly sliced tasty gyros meat cooked just perfect.  Will become a regular spot of ours for sure."}
{"text":"I just moved back to Mesa and am looking for a great Greek restaurant. I've seen this place and decided to check it out after reading these reviews.
I lived in Greece for years and miss the food and always looking for a authentic place. It's legit in that I overhead a lot of Greek conversation and music. And it did remind me of a few little dive places I remember. 
As mentioned before, the servings are very generous in size and not too pricey. The food was just ok, nothing special at all. I was disappointed in the meat and the rubbery pita but the fries were ok. 
All in all it's okay, but I know that there are better places."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have always been in an ongoing battle on whose gyro restaurant was better. Well last week we decided we would try Gyros Place since we've both lived next to it our whole lives. We ordered it to pick up and went in 10 minutes later and the staff was very nice. The man asked us if we would like any extra sauce free of charge. We brought it back to his house being skeptical of a new gyro. When we opened the bag both of our jaws dropped! Our first words were \"Holy *@&$ this is HUGE\". The serving size was unbelievable! Then we took our first bite and looked at each other with heart eyes. At the same time we said that this was the best gyro we've ever had. We saved half of it to eat later (since we were stuffed after eating half) and when we heated it up later it was still just as amazing. 2 days later we went back and got another one and were just as satisfied. Definitely our new go to place!

The restaurant is small and cozy, only a few tables but we've never eaten inside so I can't really speak too much on that part. 

The fries were OK, nothing special. The second time we went we didn't order them because it's plenty of food without them. 

The Gyros Place is AMAZING, I can't wait to go back later this week! :)"}
{"text":"Fantastic gyros, amazing fries and MUSHROOMS! I have been going here since it opened about 8 years ago and it's still out of this world!"}
{"text":"Great little mom & pop gyros place.  The portions are huge and the food is always tasty and fresh.  I am a creature of habit, so I always only order either the Gyros sandwich or Chicken Shawarma Sandwich.  Both are excellent!"}
{"text":"For the price, it is hard to beat.   The gyro's are always loaded with ingredients and it always tastes good.

The french fries with that come with the gyro are a little bland."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of gyros and greek food and try all different places and this one is a great one. I ordered the Gyro/Fries./Drink combo and it was great. The gyro was over flowing with meat with just the right amount of veggies and lettuce. The tzatziki sauce was applied in the right amount to get every bite and was very good. The fries are wonderful as was said by another reviewer. They were nice and crispy outside but soft and cooked well inside, they are also thicker somewhere between a McDonalds fire and steak house steak fry. The only thing that keeps me from giving a full 5 star was some of my meat was a little dry. Overall I really like it and will come back for more."}
{"text":"We placed a large takeout order today and everyone raved about the food. We had the gyro, Greek salad and chicken kebob. We had a few requests- i.e. Feta and sauce on side and they willingly obliged. When we picked it up they had organized our order to easily get it to the right person. The food was fresh, delicious and exceeded our expectations. I would highly recommend and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"These are the meatiest Gyros ever. Meat is a little spicy and not very lamby?? but there is a lot on the plate. medium priced but a good deal."}
{"text":"This place is yummy!! I always get the chicken kabob plate! Nice salad and great rice too!!"}
{"text":"They have best Chicken caesar Salad i ever had, freshly cooked chicken . It is very close to my workplace , i visit to this place very often ., one of the finest greek restaurant."}
{"text":"This is another one of my favorite places.  I always get the Gyros value meal and there is more than you need, enough meat for 2 sandwiches, best $7.00 meal, with tax, in town."}
{"text":"These are fabulous gyros. Small family owned business and so delicious. Huge portions and great price. I didn't love their fish and chips but I have other places I can go for that. GET THE GYROS."}
{"text":"Lamb gyro and fries were bland and had no flavor. Will not be returning. Customer service was mediocre."}
{"text":"Good food but the male cook and male cashier are disrespectful and mouthy when confronted with issues by the customer. Limited menu. Limited seating. Only 5 tables indoors and a few outdoors."}
{"text":"This place is a bit divey and had been in our neighborhood for many years. We have walked to eat here several times. 

The food is hot and the serving sizes are huge and good. This is the best gyro ever. 

The place itself is a bit small and can get very busy. It can be a bit hot during the summer when cooking. The bathrooms are big and clean

I highly recommend eating here for the Greek you may need"}
{"text":"Shared the hummus & pita, gyros and dolmas.  Really enjoyed everything for a great late lunch."}
{"text":"One of new regular stops for a quick dinner pick up or we even sometimes dine in.  The food is very good and the owners recognize us after only a couple visits.  You will have to wait a little during busy times but that should be expected from a small mom and pop place like this.  If you like gyros you will not be disappointed.  Chicken or lamb doesn't matter, they are both very good.  I would give 5 stars to the owners for the great job they do."}
{"text":"Went there awhile back and got a gyro to go and noticed the lettuce was slimy and wilted! Gross!! How do you not notice your putting slimy brown lettuce on someone's gyro!!! that's all I think about when I drive by this place! We have never been back there!"}
{"text":"We enjoy this restaurant so much, it has become a weekly habit. The chicken pita is delicious, and the fries are amazing. We always get extra tsziki sauce.. It is the best I ever tasted. I highly recommend Gyros Place!"}
{"text":"We attended this new place with a flyer received in the mail. I will most definitely return when I am starving-hungry, the servings are huge. I made fun of my husband and said to the order taker, he can't pronounce tzatziki and can you say it for him. The kind order taker brought the food to our table and told my English speaking husband if you can pronounce this soup's name, it's on the house; avgolemono. Being italian, I knew it was; lemono. This free lemon soup was superb, I never had greek lemon soup before and this will be a great comparison for any future lemon soup. I will go to my grave saying if you want plentiful servings go to a Greek server and this is true at Gyros Place, fer sure."}
{"text":"Ordered lunch on skip the dishes of chicken souvlaki with rice potatoes and salad. The container was huge and full of food ! Everything tasted great- chicken wasn't dry and had good flavour. The tatziki was really good too. Portion size is huge there's enough for two meals or one very hungry meal. 

They included warm pita too and lots of olives. Salad had peppers, iceberg and spring mix  n they don't skimp on the feta. Docked a star cuz the potatoes were really soggy and dressed in a lemon type flavour which I'm not a huge fan of. 

Seemed expensive because I got it from skip but as a walk-in it's well worth the price."}
{"text":"Literally the best Gyro I've ever had. Small locale, hole in the wall kind of place. Cozy. Real legit old dude with an accent takes the order and slices that juicy meat off the rotisserie aka the meat wheel. Gyros are mouthwatering, delicious, top-notch. So lucky to have this gem of a place close by."}
{"text":"Best little Greek Restaurant in East Mesa.
Gyros are a major hit.
Greek Salad with either Chicken, Pork, Beef, or Gyro meat is awesome.
Everything really good here."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! One of the best and most authentic Greek food places in the Valley. My family and I have been eating here for years. I have been to several other Greek restaurants and none of them can ever measure up to this place!"}
{"text":"I was in the mood for a good gyro, so I turned to Yelp and found this local place.  My big fat greek just doesnt quite do it for me.  For some reason when I go to a new small restaurant I dont like to appear like I haven't been there before.  Therefore I order quick, like I'm ordering my usual.  I ordered a gyro and they asked if I wanted fries with it, \"sure\" I replied.  Since it was lunch time there were only about four tables inside, so I sat down in between some old folks and waited patiently.for.my order.  Thankfully it was nice out so I could grab.an outside table and enjoy my meal alone.  The gyro was great, exactly what I was looking for.  I could have done without the fries.  Too much food, and they werent that great anyways.  Overall, good place, good gyro and lookin forward to going back and trying some other menu items."}
{"text":"Their gyro's are the best I have tasted.  I love that they grill the pitas and they also slice the mean from the gyro spit (or whatever it's called) and then they grill it again.  That makes a huge difference and makes their gyro stand out above anyone else's gyro.  The only reason for a 4 star review is that the ventilation inside the restaurant is so bad that I refuse to eat there.  I will only do take out at this establishment!  Great Gyro though!!"}
{"text":"We go here all the time for takeout.  Owners are super nice.  Food is what you'd expect from a hole in the wall Greek place."}
{"text":"Great food and good portions. I had the shish kebap and the gyro. Both were delicious, and served with yummy french fries. Happy I discovered this place!"}
{"text":"Have had lousy food in my lifetime but this place ranks right in the top three!

I love Greek food and while the staff was friendly the food was horific.

Tsadiki had \"no garlic\" Gyros with French fries in them can't be real. The lamb gyros and pork suvlaki meat was so over cooked, hard and tasteless that only in Mississauga could a place this lousy thrive."}
{"text":"Best gyro ever. Hummus is amazing, so is the salad. It's a little hole in the wall that is absolutely amazing. Only Greek place I go to."}
{"text":"Ordered food for our office and was told 30 minutes for delivery....2 plus hours later we received stone cold food.  They did not apologize, but did give the food without charging.  Which was good, because it was inedible.  Horrible experience."}
{"text":"I have been eating here for years. It's a legit mom and pop place and the people who work there are family. They recognize regulars and are warm and friendly. The falafel is superb, as is the rice. I'm so glad this place is close to my house!"}
{"text":"Absolutely the best gyro I have ever had. I have tried almost every gyro place in arizona and hands down the best food ever. It's a tiny hole in the wall, but the food! Delightful."}
{"text":"Wow, food from here was like I was back in Greek Town in downtown Chicago.  Fantastic!  It's a little mom and pop hole in the wall, (Some of the best eateries, I think) and its layout seems more for carry out than dine in,  They do have a couple tables inside and a couple tables outside so its a good place for lunch but a tight spot to bring your family to.  I feel the food is as authentic as I remember being served at any Greek restaurant around Chicago and boy have I missed it since moving to Arizona.  Thanks Gyros Place for coming to town."}
{"text":"Tried their hummus today with my wife and that's delicious as well. Lettuce is crisp in the salad, not limp, and veggies taste fresh. Another good experience here!"}
{"text":"Very good food!! Quality and large portions. Family owned and operated so you get the home cooked taste. Anyone looking for some tasty food with loads of flavor, come and check this place out!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here for the first time and loved it.  Ordered the gyro sandwich with fries and it was delicious!  Great service too.  I love gyro meat and always ask for extra for more $ but today at lunch I didn't ask for extra meat.  I was highly satisfied with the amount of meat they put on my sandwich, it was the PERFECT amount! So, I am very happy and will come here again and again! My sandwich was loaded! 

Please check this place out if you haven't already, I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Best kept secret for gyros..my sandwich was overflowing with meat and the fries are cooked to perfection..small quaint spot but well worth the stop for lunch or whenever you can..staff is just as friendly as they want to be and food comes out hot and fresh... I also frequent cafe mix and if I were blindfolded it would be a close competition in every category..love it and I will be back soon"}
{"text":"The best authentic gyro!  That's it.  The best authentic gyro.  The family working there is literally from the Mediterranean. The gyro is fantastic and they do a gyro with fries and a drink for eight bucks for their lunch special and it is a huge meal; 2 meals for most folks or 1 if you're really hungry."}
{"text":"One of the best gyro places in Arizona!  Large, flavorful, hot, fresh portions with fabulous tzatziki sauce!!"}
{"text":"Best gyro I've ever had! So much meat and everything taste so fresh. Two ppl could share this meal. The owner is so very sweet and respectful. He knew exactly what I wanted before I even said it and that's awesome to me  I will always get my gyros here from now on. Cant wait to see what else taste yummy on the menu."}
{"text":"The Gyros are gigantic and super delicious. Pricing is very reasonable as well. I'll probably end up becoming a regular"}
{"text":"Tried this place today. It's in an unusual spot. It's a little strip mall and they have empty units next to them.  It was small inside but clean. I ordered the gyro sandwich and it came with fries. The Gyro was so yummy. Tons of meat. Mostly meat. But the meat was perfect. Fries weren't the best fries ever but I didn't go there for the fries. Totally recommend this place. Excited to go back and try something else."}
{"text":"i used to like this place but i asked something different on the meal to cook/owner guy, change a side next to gyro but owner guy refused and charge $4 extra some silly thing and refused to fix it, i do not appreciate that type of business and will never be back to their rat hole restaurant. just drive to MVP they have best of everything including friendly service with supreme quality med food."}
{"text":"Really Really good place for authentic Gyros (just like Greece) with fries in the pita! 

If you feel like Gyros don't go to the Danforth just come here and you will be glad you didn't spend the time and the money in gas! 

Nice and clean and friendly service. 

Close to Dixie and Matheson Blvd just south of the 401."}
{"text":"The food here exceeded my expectations. I don't think there's another place where you can get such a delicious, yummy, satisfying meal for the price that they charge. Their chicken gyro in pita drenched with the hot sauce is a must-try, I'm salivating just thinking about it."}
{"text":"Since the place is called Gyros Place, I figure my best bet is to order a gyro.  Fantastic choice by me!  
The meat was so tender and flavorful.  The pita was so soft and yummy.  There was just the right amount of tzatzaiki sauce in it.  I really only like fries if they are criss-cut or crinkle cut.  Lucky me they serve crinkle! This was probably the best gyro I've had at gyro joint in the Phoenix area.  
It makes me sad it's in east Mesa and I'm hardly ever out there."}
{"text":"I often stay at the Sandman hotel nearby and this is my favourite go to place for easy Greek food.  Portions are big and filling.  I've had the Chicken, Lamb and Pork Gyros and they're all good.  A little heavy on the onions, but that's a personal preference."}
{"text":"Love this place!!  We get take out here all the time!  I love their hummus. It's super smooth served with olive oil and an olive. Their tzatziki sauce is really thick and creamy. My favorite is the falafel pita. Soo good. Their pita is yummy."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Gyro place in town, always fresh food, the staff is always nice. I just eat the chicken gyro,  they recommend the chicken kabob over the shredded chicken, witch i thought was very cool of them for the heads up. I love this place and will always come back. This place is Canyon State Beard Club approved!"}
{"text":"Pro: Mom Pop store (probably originally from greece) Service good, Portions large. Good tasting sauce in the pita 

Cons: Ordered the Shish kabob. Got unseasoned (read no salt, brining or any basic marinated cut of beef). They used the worst part of beef hence the shish (skewered) meat was super tough still contained gristle (no trimming done) and was flavourless. Sauce though tasting good should ideally be made of only yougurt. This also had a mayolike base. Salad that came as a side was watery and tart 

Sigh! another option to find my ideal eatery shattered."}
{"text":"First time eating at this establishment I must say I was very impressed food was delicious nice clean take out / dine in place.

I ordered a chicken gyro on a PITA with a side of Greek fries I must say the chicken was very tasty well marinated.

 I only work in the area and I live around the Danforth and I can say it was like being close to being on the Danforth I will definitely be returning here"}
{"text":"This place is hands down the best greek food in Mesa. Big portions of deliciously flavored food. I always go with the classic lamb and beef gyro. Get extra tzaziki sauce and the fries are pretty good too. The price is right as well"}
{"text":"This is a standard Greek quick service with ample seating and clean facilities. It's relatively new but quite popular, especially since another nearby Greek place shut down recently.

The menu includes the expected souvlaki dinners, gyro sandwiches, etc. Some twists include Greek fries (fries with feta sprinkled on top) and some decent entrée salads.

But the imagination stops short of the appetizers, where I struggled to find something other than the aforementioned fries or a spanakopita. 

Another downside is slow service. I found my order took longer than necessary for a lunch, only one group was ahead of me but the simple chicken salad order seemed to take a tad long.

Overall a decent option though and I'd come back again. The prices are not unsound and the food tastes as good as it should."}
{"text":"Amazing!!! I have been going here for years, & it never disappoints! I get the original gyro with a Greek salad! YUM! Must try!"}
{"text":"Dry and a bit stale bread and the gyro meat was dry. Small salad for the extra buck.  Not much room so don't bring too many with you. Wee will try and scout out a better on on the scale of Greek wrap in Peoria."}
{"text":"This place has good gyros , but sadly I won't go back! I bought a gyro on Tuesday on the way home from work. I asked for it to be made with no onions or tomato ( I have a raw tomato allergy. ) When I got home to eat it the gyro had both tomatoes & onion on it. I called in to tell them my order was made wrong & the guy said I'll give you another 1 next time I stop by. Well, I stopped by again after work & he told me it would be $5.00. I gave him a look & hen he said it will be $3.00. He wasn't very nice about it either!  When you make a mistake on a customers order you don't charge them!! I couldn't eat the gyro I bought on Tuesday. I threw it away. This place lost my business & probably my friends too. If you want to have a good reputation sir you need to have good customer service & not charge people for your mistakes!"}
