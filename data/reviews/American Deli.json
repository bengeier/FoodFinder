{"text":"This is probably the best thing I've had in a really long time! Everything was cooked fresh and very appetizing..I had the chicken cheesesteak with everything on it. Although I don't usually eat mushrooms they were cooked well and hidden I could barely taste them. The fries that came with the combo were AMAZING!!!! Fries are my favorite food and I'll go back just to order them! They were crispy and seasoned well! The sprite was fresh and I'll definitely be going back!!!"}
{"text":"American deli has the best philly and wings in town AND the best customer service! The food was made fresh and hot. The wings were meaty and crispy with just the right amount of sauce-- just how I like them! The fries were crispy on the outside, and filled with soft potato inside. The Philly was full-sized with fresh ingredients and good proportions. They have a good selection of beverages, I recommend the peach drink mixed with sprite. They have very reasonable prices and a great menu with lots to choose from. The cashiers were welcoming and friendly, and the restaurant was clean and tidy."}
{"text":"This American deli was wonderful besides the rude cashier. First of all when I was ordering my combo I told her I wanted a lemonade and before I could say that she said it comes with a drink. Obviously a combo comes with a drink and I was just stating what I wanted the drink to be. Then when I get my food, it wasn't correct and when I explained that my food wasn't correct she said well they already made it. But beside that the food was delicious!!"}
{"text":"Wow! I am leaving from CLT this afternoon and I dropped by here today for some pre- flight sustenance. CLT airport's dining isn't very warm- or tasty... not what I need before a flight. Being a NYC native, I have access to top- notch eateries, and I'm glad to say, I've found a favorite outpost in the South!  Really good service and I found a new go- to chicken wing spot that's not in NYC. The decor and ambiance is of a fast- food establishment- which it is- but it is clearly well kept. I saw an employee leave the counter to wipe down the machines/ beverage containers/ tables twice while waiting.  My colleague and I ordered the philly wing combo and the salad combo. While waiting, I was able to see someone prepare my salad directly. I even saw the fryer shake up the wings in the teriyaki sauce! It wasn't like KFC where they had wings sitting under a heat lamp. It was pleasant to see that, subsequent to my order, the wings were fried and tossed in small batches. A+!    My colleague enjoyed his philly steak, bun was a little dry,but we cleaned the wings off down to the bone. Almost ordered more! The sauce to wing ratio was almost overwhelming, but nevertheless, excellent! Can't find drub like this in NYC unfortunately.  Definitely will be my go- to chicken wing stop whenever I'm back in town!"}
{"text":"Excellent food!  I ordered philly-cheese with wing combo...they give me mountain amount of nice crispy fries.  My wings and fries were crispy & golden, which tells me that they don't skimp on using good oil.  Bit of wait....was the only down side.  Open kitchen! Clean food!"}
{"text":"Two problems: 1) Woman working there at lunch had no personality.  2) 10 wings should fill anyone up. These wings are from poor young chickens or miniature free range.  I wasn't looking for anything special; guess I got it. I gave a second star because the sauce was a decent flavor and the tiny wings were crispy."}
{"text":"Honestly, I don't indulge in fast food, but when I do feel a craving, it's always for AD's chicken wings! The lemon and teriyaki flavored wings are TO DIE FOR. Being a terribly indecisive person, I love that you can make a combo with about anything on the menu.   I love this location because it's always clean and the employees are always pleasant. One reviewer below me complained about the opening of the boxes, but I find this refreshing. They're only checking to make sure that your order is correct... hardly anything to complain about.  American deli is convenient, delicious and friendly.  Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"I ordered the gyro combo with an extra side of sauce, half sweet tea. The tea was soured (no biggie, it happens). They switched me out for a Coke which granted an extra star. There was no extra side of sauce although I'm pretty sure I was charged for it. The 2 stars is because my gyro (whose a la carte price is $5.59) had like 3 thin slices of meat. It was mostly a lettuce gyro. Seriously the record for least meat on a gyro I've ever seen. I was kicking myself that I didn't go to Showmars instead. I felt like if they were going to be so cheap and skimpy on the meat the price should be more like $2.59 instead of $5.59. Very disappointed and not likely to return. You're paying for 74 frontage rent and franchisee fees."}
{"text":"Fast friendly service. I ordered the lemon pepper wings and fries combo. My lunch cost under $10. The wings were seasoned well and the fries were cooked how I like them. Some places take a while to prepare chicken, but the food came out in 5 minutes. I will come back."}
{"text":"Those place is a hit or miss some days it's good some days it's like ewe why did I even order here and let's not forget expensive and the area really isn't a good one its always people hanging around in the parking lot and the parking is terrible it's always a line and a wait eat here at your own risk!"}
{"text":"I mean it's chicken wings, fries and subs. What are you expecting?! Folks, it's not claiming to be anything other than what it is. Don't expect anything fancy. It's a simple joint with standard options.   I've been here a few times for lunch and haven't left disappointed. I appreciate that they cook up every order fresh! But just know that means you're going to wait....sometimes for a (long) while. But your foods going to be hot!   I also appreciate that they show you your order...before you leave.  Maybe it's just me...but the disappointment when you get back to work and your lunch order is wrong is THE worst feeling ever.   So far my favorite item here are the honey garlic wings. Yes, they are $1 more. But it's totally worth it. Try them...Thank me later!   If you're in the area, give them a try!"}
{"text":"American deli food is so good i will buy wing tray for superbowl love american deli and philly cheesesteak is so good"}
{"text":"First time here. After reading the history on the wall about the company, it seems they are very proud of their Philly cheese steak & wings.   So, I gave the Philly and wing combo a try.  Philly was pretty good.  Made fresh and hot.  The wings...well...no thanks.   The wings were xtra...xtra small. (About 1-1/2\" max).  I got the medium sauce and was nothing more than either Texas Pete or Tabasco sauce. Not impressed at all.  This location has been several things over the past few years. Will be interesting to see how long this place is here.  I wish them luck."}
{"text":"Expect to wait quite a while for your food.  Comes comes out of kitchen in random order.  Food subpar at best."}
{"text":"Incredibly friendly and quick service. Everything on the menu is reasonably priced.  Favorite thing to order is philly wing combo (beef) with mild wings.  Highly recommend if you're in a rush but want quality and generously portioned foods"}
{"text":"It's a fast-food place, but it's a good one. The restaurant was clean, the cashier was friendly, and the food was good. I ordered a cheesesteak, my wife got wings, and the kids got chicken tenders. All were prepared in a timely manner; not as fast as McDonald's, but certainly not an excessively long wait as other reviews have indicated. I will definitely be back, especially since the cheesesteak is delicious and unpretentious."}
{"text":"wow where do i start... the food is great.!!!! the portions are hugh..... i was with my family of four. we ordered 4 different meals. ofcourse we tasted each other meals. i had the phillysteak.it was excelent. a lot of meat on the soft bun grilled to perfection. came with a bunch of fries and coke. sister had shrimp fried rice.and wings.. enough for two... very good. mom had tilapia.you get two nice size fillets.. very good. niece had chicken fingers.  delicious !!!  you must have an appetite when visiting because you get a lot of good food.all the food are cooked at the time you order it. its an open kitchen an you can see your food cooked...."}
{"text":"Was craving a burger so I decided to visit American Deli. I wasn't able to purchase my burger because the grill had already been clean. If cleaning the grill means that customers cannot be serviced then that should be done after the business closes."}
{"text":"After reading other reviews I decided to give them a shot. Not many good places in the general area... The Philly was delicious and the crinkle cut fries were perfectly cooked.. Not soggy at all! Reasonably priced and fairly quick."}
{"text":"A restaurant called \"American Deli\" should have a great selection of deli sandwiches, right?  Deli is short for delicatessen which means \"a store selling cold cuts, cheeses, and a variety of salads, as well as a selection of unusual or foreign prepared foods.\"   This place has ONE deli sandwich.  A Reuben.  And they were out of the right kind of bread to make one today.  At lunchtime.    If you're specialty is burgers and wings - don't call your restaurant a deli.  Sorry.  There's several other places nearby to eat."}
{"text":"Wings are soooo small like the size of a stick of gum......... fried rice was definetly missing something but def not missing the vegetables more vegetables then rice and its hella pricey...."}
{"text":"First time here for a takeout order. Hmmm..maybe it's because I ordered the Tilapia instead of a burger or wings, and fish may not be their specialty. The fish was way over-fried, with very little meat and a lot of thin, crusty breading with no meat. Crinkle cut fries were okay, nothing special. I may try it again with a different dish next time."}
{"text":"I love this place! They serve their food fresh and hot to order, which definitely sets them apart from the other options around the area. The prices are also pretty good! I highly recommend the Chicken Philly cheesesteak and the chicken fingers!"}
{"text":"Let's start with the good. American deli in the past has had GREAT wings and fries. This was my go too place whenever I was craving wings UNTIL I ordered food for pickup, arrived at the restaurant and just before I was about to pay for my food the cashier lifted their drink holders and roaches scattered from underneath! I was absolutely mortified! I will not be eating here again! EVER!"}
{"text":"We loved the honey garlic wings - crispy and just amount of sweetness. Probably the best wings we've had. The chicken fried rice was awesome. And I loved the Ruben sandwich and the philly cheese steaks. My whole family really enjoyed the food and can't wait to come back again."}
{"text":"We had the Rueben sandwich. It was really good. Not as big as the picture showed but half was more then enough especially with fries. This place stays busy too. I will try it again when up in the area.  I was reading up on some of the other reviews and after I think the reason the food isn't prepared ahead of time for call ins is because most sandwiches are better when they are hot. I noticed the main guy was interpreting for the lady. So they may just stare are you because they don't speak English or they know you need to be nicer to folks fixing your food. (I'd hate to hear you found a dead rat in your food after you left) just saying. Lol."}
{"text":"One of the first things  I always look for in an eating establishment is the sanitary grade.  Well, this place had an A and it WAS very clean.  PLUS!  The food, however, lacked any genuine taste- unless one considers \"artificial\" and \"frozen\" considered as  \"taste\". I had a small salad with ranch dressing. The lettuce was shredded- a con, because once the dressing is poured , the lettuce might just as well be cole slaw.  There were no crackers available nor croutons to add some crunch factor.  My unsweetened tea tasted as if it were fresh from  a disinfected canister.  Hubby got the chicken fried rice and wings.   He offered a bite to me so that I could taste for myself that HIS entree had been frozen at the factory and popped into a microwave. There was a bit of a hickory taste added but it was not a genuine flavor - more like  a manufactured \"taste\"?  The lady behind the counter was very gracious and efficient-  very helpful to first- time customers.   We certainly appreciated her and the cleanliness of the place.  Unfortunately, I don't believe we will ever pay another visit..."}
{"text":"The food is awesome but there CUSTOMER SERVICE sucks i have to call the facility more than one time & when they finally do pick up i get a can u hold or hung up on which makes me have to go in but that was the point in me calling in the first place . Then order a couple days later philly cheese steak and a 10 peace wing they make my order accidently give it to some one else and some how they had some chicken sitting on the side but it was more than a 10 peace so they remade my philly and charged me for the 15 peace like it was my fault they let money walk out the door ipaid for it and said i was never going back AND I MUST SAY I AM A REGULAR CUSTOMER been going there for 4 years its sad how people be so unprofessional and the manager is just as bad i gave them tips numerous of times she never once apologized for the inconvenience or nothing so now i choose to go to Zaxbys instead there wings are just as good if not better"}
{"text":"This is a relatively new place in Monroe. We decided to try it for the first time today and the food is awesome!  Cooked fresh to order and delicious!  I ordered the Chicken Philly Cheesesteak and my daughter got the burger. Both were excellent. Well worth the visit!!"}
{"text":"If there was a negative star rating i would give this place a negative 5. I will not be going  back. I ordered the fried rice and there was so much grease i think that it was deep fried and full of salt. The teriyaki wings made me sick. I definitely regret my decision to go here."}
{"text":"My one star review is based on very limited action. I would have loved to base it on the actual taste of the food but that wasn't possible. Reason bieng, I came by at 1236. Restaurant had a sign posted stating it was open at 1200. However, door was locked and employees were inside. I tapped on the window, thinking they forgot to open the doors. Female employees behind the counter made limited eye contact with me but did not open the door or do anything. There was no sign explaining any unusual reason why they were not open. There was another customer outside that was baffled by this also. I guess they didn't want our business. No worries, I am eating lunch at Jersey Mike's. Gotta love capitalism. At least, I am sure Jersey Mike's does.."}
{"text":"The only reason they get 4 stars for me is because their wings are best wings I have ever tasted in my opinion! The best wings I have ever had honestly but the staff usually gets my order wrong especially if you order multiple flavors so you gotta be patient with them. The price I feel like is within market price so I'm not mad at it, I'd recommend this place"}
{"text":"Chicken and fried rice is amazing. Lemon pepper wings are the truth and the light.... the fried rice surprised me."}
{"text":"Most unprofessional place I've ever order food from, I ordered from door darsh and got the wrong amount of wings. I called the establishment the person who answered  the phone had the nerve to say that it was impossible for me to have the incorrect amount of wings. Why would I even waste my time to call of my order was right ? He was very unprofessional... needless to say I won't ever order from them again. Then my food wasn't even cooked correctly. NEVER AGAIN.  I would give 0 stars if possible ."}
{"text":"I stopped in here on Saturday hoping to get a good sandwich and was sadly mistaken. The menu here is very limited. With that I decided to get 10 wings and my girlfriend got the Rueben. The wings were hands down the worst wings I've had in my life. My little celery nub was bigger then the wings. They were way over cooked and way over sauced. The Rueben was gross. Long story short I paid $18 for a side of fries... Almost every fast food restaurant in America is cheaper, faster and better!"}
{"text":"I'm less than impressed with the food. Ordered a turkey sub and the guys making it didn't seem to know what they were doing. They assembled my cold sub on a hot flat top so my lettuce and tomatoes were hot and soggy. The sub was mushy and fell apart before I could eat it.  The menu also had wings, Philly sandwiches (that didn't look good), and shrimp fried rice which I would be skeptical to order. I saw them make a chicken Philly using a pre-packed grilled chicken patty and they cut it up into chunks. Nothing \"fresh\" about it.   The fries and peach drink were good though, but not enough to make me eat there again."}
{"text":"My lunch partner and I decided we wanted some chicken tenders and fries for lunch.  I had heard about the American Deli that recently opened on South Blvd so I looked at their website and menu.  We were in luck - they had chicken tenders and fries, so we decided to give them a try.    The place is clean and the ladies are friendly, but there are some points that stand out instantly once we left their online website and walked into their actual store in person.  It's sparse; I mean, like stark inside.  I noticed the fresh paint on the walls then my eyes fell to the booths and chairs and tables BOLTED to the floor.?.  Really?  My partner also noticed that there was nothing on any of the tables, not even salt & pepper??  The energy of the place was off putting, it felt weird in there to me.  I noticed a few hand written signs all stating completely obvious statements to people with any home training like \"no free cups of water\" and the obligatory \"no public restrooms\".  I also couldn't help but notice printed in all caps right on the receipt \"NO REFUNDS, NO RETURNS, NO EXCHANGES\" which doesn't exactly give one a feeling of confidence in what they're going to get.  There was also an unusual sign at the register saying that they would open and inspect every plate before leaving the counter to be certain it was prepared correctly.  WOW.  How many of your customers have come in, ordered, eaten most of it and then asked for a refund or tried to say it wasn't what they ordered?  The answer?  Clearly far too many or these types of signs wouldn't be necessary.    I watch as other orders are brought to the counter and see the ladies opening the boxes and looking at the food with the customer... no hand washing, no hair nets, no gloves, no nothing.  These ladies are not cooks so aren't held to the same cleanliness standards of hair nets or gloves and they are visibly playing on their phones, touching the register and money = I do not want them putting their hands anywhere near my food!   My order number was called and I go to the counter and she inspects my food.  It looked pretty enough, and there was a lot of food for the price.  I opened the box at my bolted down table and took a bite of the fries.  They were basic crinkle fries.  Then I took a bite of one of the chicken tenders and instantly tasted that familiar fishy overtone of chicken that's been fried in the same oil as fish = YUCK!  That was it for me...  I drank a little of my coke, ate a few of the fries and tossed my entire meal in the trash.  We then drove down the street and bought two more lunches at Showmar's that were edible.    So today's little trial was a complete fail for me and I will certainly not be back.  I wish this place would change it's name because this is as far from a \"deli\" as you could possibly imagine.  No fresh meats or cheeses here.  Clearly I am not American Deli's target customer just as American Deli is not at all my target lunch spot."}
{"text":"Though I don't typically get out this far in Monroe, it seems I've been here more often than not lately, and on one of the trips decided to pop into the American Deli. I figure \"hey, I like delis, and why not an American one, right?\" Well...  The place is cute, I'll give them that. They look like any other smallish fast food place on the outside. On the inside, it's more of the same. it is not, however, anything like a deli. It looks like... a fast food place. There are a few things that remind you of a deli, like sandwiches, but we aren't talking Carnegie Deli here. Just a couple of wraps and that's about it.  Perhaps the most interesting thing is that you can get wings as a side instead of, say, fries (and you probably aren't likely to even find fries at many delis, but that's another issue entirely). If you do, however, your price jumps significantly. And portions are not huge to make up for the jump price, so you may be disappointed."}
{"text":"Love how clean this place is and how open the kitchen is. The girl working at the front was super nice. And the Food"}
{"text":"I usually don't have anything bad to say about this place but coming in yesterday made me not want to ever come back. My wife and I got two happy hour meals \"chicken and fries\" which was dry. The food did not taste the same so I asked for more sauce to go on my chicken. The Manager rudely said I could have a quarter amount she proceeded to pour the sauce on my chicken I asked for but I stop and ask  if she mind filling up the small ramekin again rudely said it would be $1. Not always what you say it's how you say things as well. This same manger denied a mother and her child a cup for ice I know this franchise  is not this cut & dry on money not to give a women a cup for her child. This is not customer service nor a good way to show hospitality to those you serve."}
{"text":"The service has gotten much better at this place also the food is pretty good I will recommend this place if you want some good chicken wings."}
{"text":"Hello friends,   I like these \"deli's\". I've tried the wings, Shrimp fried rice (alot of Shrimp, not devained), Philly cheese (chicken), and fries.  All of which I've had more than  once from multiple locations. All ways had my orders to go. Never ordered dine in. But from the looks, it's pretty clean as well.  Go enjoy,  TTFN"}
{"text":"Hello friends,   This location is what I've been told is their latest location to open in the city of Charlotte. The food is cooked to order. Not a lot of menu items which is cool with me. Prices are pretty decent as well. The place seems pretty darn clean with a few tables for dine-in.   For this trip i purchased the Philly w/ Lemon Pepper wings and drink. I really like that wings comes as a side for some orders. I really really like the fact that they are good. As for the Philly; that was pretty good as well. You can have chicken or beef. Mayo, peppers, mushrooms and cheese come as the default. The bread?? well, that. That bread. That bread was umm umm gooooood and soft and had a little chew to it that i can't describe on here enough to give it the justice that it so deserves.   Go and enjoy,  TTFN"}
{"text":"Pretty good place. Ordered the Philly Cheese Steak and Chicken Wing combo. Philly was good, keeping in mind that I've never had the Mecca of cheesesteaks (Genos), so my experience with cheesesteaks is limited. The wings were smallish but very tasty. The fries were your basic fries, nothing to write home about but portions were satisfying. I would go here again but with so many options in this area it's not at the top of my list."}
{"text":"Good fast food deli that would expect in a big city.  In and out with a lot of food was the name of the game here.   The Philly cheesestakes are really good and you get hot and fresh crinkle cut fries.   The pastrami on rye is a good shot if you are hankering for a Reuben,   Hits the fast food spot."}
{"text":"Walking by this place after party city trip.  Was afraid to go in. Walked right in ordered wings & fried shrimp was delicious, fries were steaming HOT!!! Customer Service was great, if you ever in CLT please stop by it's a winner"}
{"text":"So I ask the slim short amego cook can i get a refill he go say no u got to wait on her. For what, as you see she busy with 3 customers and you up here filling up your cup sip it and pouring it out for what ?? Rude staff none of them speak just stare at you. I mean Customer Service line please."}
