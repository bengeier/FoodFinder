{"text":"Best roti around. Wish I lived closer. Super friendly staff. Be careful about the spice level. This is the real deal. You can burn yourself pretty bad. They also sell their own hot sauce. Make roti not war!"}
{"text":"Best Doubles in the GTA...period.  But be warned, they only sell doubles on Saturday and often sell out by 2pm"}
{"text":"Hands down the best Roti I have ever had. I use to work in Oakville and would go to Kori's for lunch.  The restaurant is hidden on the side of a building and is tiny in size. There are 1 or 2 tables but no one really occupies them. Everyone knows its best for take out :).  You can expect to wait about 10 minutes for your Roti and inevitably, there will be a line up. Ive been a few times where the line up was out the door and down the side of the building.  I usually ordered the Curry Chicken with medium heat. Be careful not to order \"wussy\"...they have a bell they ring for those who chicken out :) Its all in good fun though!  I would recommend the Curry Chicken or even the Goat. All ingredients are prepared fresh daily and Kori's even makes their own shells the day of. I think this is what really sets them apart from other places I have found. Its all in the shell! I unfortunately do not work in Oakville anymore and have been searching downtown toronto for a replacement to Kori's Roti. I have been unsuccessful! Kori - hear my pain and open up another spot in Toronto!!!!"}
{"text":"As mentioned, a true hole in the wall - straight from the islands, and just as authentic as any of the top shops I've eaten in along my travels.   Try the goat or beef.  Authentic flavors,  and medium can sometimes be hot as hell!   The fried dough balls with tamarind are a nice add on.  This place is one of my fav's - no disappointment.    I have friends that well drive an hour for her Roti"}
{"text":"Best rotis ive ever had, but their hours totally suck. Honestly, you really dont know when theyll be open. So many times ive driven down there and they were closed even though their hours say they should be open."}
{"text":"Roti was decent. Had the goat. A bit chewy and they could have added a few more pieces of meat but the taste was very nice.   Word of warning: I waited a solid half an hour for my Roti to be made after lining up to order it due to neighbouring businesses and offices calling in orders of a dozen or more. Not recommended if you are in a rush or have a short lunch break.   Staff is fantastic and they have a really good energy about them which is nice."}
{"text":"GENERAL NOTES A well hidden gem! Good roti in Oakville, yes!  MENU RECOMMENDATIONS Pick your poison. I like the chicken roti, but I'm not really a goat guy (more of a boob man). I'll also normally get a side of rice and gravy.  SERVICE NOTES Reasonably swift service for what it is. Expect to wait 5-10 minutes after your order is placed. It can get reasonably busy here as the secret is sort of out, at least locally.  LOCATION NOTES Trapped in a tiny office plaza on the south side of Speers, just west of 4th line. Easy to miss so pay attention. Limited parking (it's a bitch to get out).  HUMOUROUS STORY Your mom."}
{"text":"Best roti in town! Went there several times and we never got disappointed. You can spice up your roti to different heat levels. Staff is friendly and service is quick. This spot is highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I like extremely hot food and often i am disappointed by most places attempts to try and sell spicy foods and usually jump to the hottest thing on their menu. I'm surprised i had not heard about kori's till today. Like always i jumped straight to the hottest thing on the menu and ordered a goat roti and a chicken and rice both suicide. I was pleasantly surprised this food was hot as hell and i loved it as i write this review i sit with sweat on my brow. Absolutely amazing flavour and the right amount of spice absolutely phenomenal. Apparently a lot of people agree with me as i was in the door no later than 5 minutes after they open and i was the second person to arrive while waiting the approx 7 minutes for my food to be ready there were atleast 8 other people waiting."}
{"text":"I went and got a Kori roti today because of all the great reviews here. I've been to many roti shops in Toronto and I'm determined to try every roti in the west GTA and I have to say that I'm not that impressed with Kori's. Another reviewer mentioned that the roti skins are fresh and good and that's true, but overall the roti was pretty dry. Maybe some people enjoy a dry roti but I prefer a nice juicy one. Maybe you have to order it extra saucy or get gravy on the side but really you shouldn't have to. If you're in the west end and want a delicious juicy amazing roti, go to D Hot Shoppe in Burlington."}
{"text":"Hey all,  A real hole in the wall, blink and you miss it venue.  If we are ever in oakville this is a necessary stop.   Drew"}
{"text":"Only the best roti around! This is true Trinidadian roti. Don't get it confused with any other type of roti. Kori's the the closest thing to authentic roti I have had outside of Trinidad.   The last time I was in Trinidad and I told someone I was from Toronto. They told me I HAD to try Kori's because it was the best they have ever had while on vacation. There you have it, right from the mouth of a born and raised Trinidadian!   The goat roti is to die for! It's tender and there's always lots of sauce. You have to come on Saturdays to try their doubles. Promise you'll love them. They're cheap and delicious. Authentic Trinidadian street food.   You can choose your spice level all the way from mild to suicide. Medium is no joke so I can't even imagine what suicide is like.   The staff! Terri is the best! She's so friendly and is always up for chatting even when it's busy. She makes the place what it is.   Ok lets just talk for a minute how to eat roti while I have my platform. It's not a wrap! You don't use a knife and fork! You open it up, rip off some of the shell and use it to scoop up all the amazingness. That's how it's done!   Seating is limited and it's always packed. They have lineups at lunch time that stretch all the way out the door  your best bet is to call ahead and place your order. While they are fast at preparing orders, if there's quite a few in front of you, you'll be waiting awhile.   Honestly I can't say enough good things about this place. Best food, best staff who also happen to be the owners. I highly recommend stopping in."}
{"text":"Awesome roti. Be careful though, if you order hot you better be prepared. Not a bad thing to say about the place!!"}
{"text":"Soooooo good!!!!! The goat roti with medium spice was perfect. I always lived by the notion that no one can tough my mom's roti, but damn.. this was very very very very very close!!"}
{"text":"The best caribbean Roti! The make their Roti dough every morning and if you want the Roti without the dal/lentil filling then just call them around 9 am and they will customized it for you.  This place is owned by a sweet couple who are open to customization (add more /less/no potatoes). I love their chicken and goat Roti."}
{"text":"Best Roti in Oakville! Clean establishment, friendly and pretty staff! Food is always fresh and hot! Been going to Kori's for decades now and I will continue :)"}
{"text":"Friends recommended this place for Goat Roti, they were right it was excellent. A bit more meat would have made it 5 star. Flavour was excellent. It's definitely a hole in the wall with great food."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch once and had the chicken rot I with medium sauce.  Despite the unsurprising amount of heat from a \"medium\" sauce, the roti was exceptionally good.  I've recommended this place to many people who pass through the area."}
{"text":"They are reasonably priced with decent portion sizes. I ordered the goat roti MED+ spice and I think that was enough spice so that you can still taste the food and not just spice. The curry taste really good and flavorful however I do wish there was ore sauce/gravy inside the roti. It was a bit dry at times especially since I had goat which can be extra chewy at times"}
{"text":"UHNNNNNNNNMAZING. It's been about a year since I've been here though.  WHAT'S UP: Massive wrap of chewy, flaky roti;  Stuffed until it's massive with very flavourful curry.  Peppa scale makes it easy to consistantly get the right amount of spice, and the scale goes HIGH. I can't even imagine consuming the hottest option.   MY CHOICE: I go for chicken roti, Peppa factor of \"Medium + 1 touch\", which BURNS BABY BURNS--like really though--like mouth-searing, eye-watering, hurts-so-good-i-got-a-soregasm BURN.  COMPARE:  I think this place has much tastier chicken rotis than Rannee's, Oakville's other roti option over on Kerr. I haven't had a chance to check out a lot of Toronto's options, but I can tell you it's better than any roti I've had in the financial district."}
{"text":"I had a Veggie roti....sooo disappointed, it was dry and it had chow mein veggies that were hard. So not what I was expecting. Not authenic. I have been here before a couple yrs ago and the roti was soo juicy and tasty!! What happened?!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love Kori's. The food taste perfect . The girl behind the cashier always super nice . We get ours plated extra gravy...I love spice but sometimes the peppers are hot ... Read the chart for the spice level... Also there patties are fabulous."}
{"text":"Being from Calgary, I have to admit my exposure to roti is limited. But, if I know anything about food, Kori's Roti Shop is definitely one for the books.   Tucked away in an unassuming area of Oakville, this little shop serves a small but fantastic selection of Trinidadian dishes. For my first time, I thought I would try two kinds since they had 'mini' versions. So, I ordered the goat and the chickpea, both with gravy as well as a side order of beef patty. Now when it comes to good food, I'll admit I can take down quite a bit. But man, these mini's were like an American definition of size small while their regulars, a supersize. Portions aside, the goat roti with gravy was phenomenal. Perfectly seasoned and tender with melt in your mouth chunks of potato tucked inside a warm roti, I inhaled while thanking myself for wearing stretchy pants. Equally good was the beef patty. Now, I don't know if it's better than Allan's or Randy's but it was good in its own right. The meat and gravy was rich and the pastry was flaky and buttery. Because the goat roti was such a substantial amount, I had to get the chickpea roti to go. While it was still good, I found the chickpeas a little too on the crunchy side and dry without the gravy. Regardless, it was still good and something I would get as a lighter option but, the clear winner is still the goat roti.   Like many of my favorite places, this spot isn't fancy decor or service wise. But, like many small, family-owned restaurants, it excels in food and pricing. At around $7.50 per mini, I can absolutely justify the drive to satisfy my saucy, gravy, curry cravings anytime. Don't wait, go and get it. It's ggggrrrreat!  *Also, park in the lot next to Kori's. There is very limited parking at Kori's."}
{"text":"This place is a fast food type of place and this gem of a spot is tucked behind Speers Animal Hospital. There is parking behind the building. Not rating the restaurant on its atmosphere/decor, it may be expected that this is typical.  I have been coming to Kori's Roti for over 10 years and they have the best Trinidadian roti ever! The spice level can be quite hot if you are adverse to heat get the mild. The portion size is decent and the prices are reasonable.   The service is efficient and friendly, it is owned by a lovely couple.   The place is small but a tiny bit bigger than what the previous place use to be. There are not a lot of tables to sit at. Everything is good on the menu. I do enjoy buying the roti shells on its own, they freeze well and I can have one whenever I want."}
{"text":"You need to know where it is, but it's totally worth it when you find it.  Really love the roti.  Make sure to call-in your order ahead at lunchtime to avoid the wait!"}
{"text":"Amazing Rotis Day by day the meat quantity is getting lowered and they mistakenly adding spice in mild which we couldnt take but overall Kori is best for lunch."}
{"text":"Do one thing really well is the name of the game here. Goat and chicken roti are superb. Shrimp and veggie also very good.  My least favorite is beef. I find the meat dry and chewy. If you are taking home your order grab a gravy to pour over top.  Great staff and service."}
{"text":"This place was right across from where we were to me being Caribbean it's either a hit and miss but my fiancé and I actually enjoyed it we had a curry chicken roti & curry goat with rice came up to 25$ with tax if your in the area try them out also when we tried their pepper sauce it was spicy but full of flavour. I'll post some pics to show"}
{"text":"Once again, I found myself driving around Oakville with the hunger of a thousand wolves. Out of the corner of my eye, I espied the word \"roti\" and nearly rolled our car to get to it.  Nestled in a plaza off of Speers road just West of 4th Line, Kori's Roti is crazy small. It's bright yellow walls barely box in the aroma of the freshly jerked meats, which we could smell from the parking lot in the back. The resto has two small tables with a pair of chairs, each just kind of thrown in there. Add that to J.T.'s \"Sexyback\" on their radio, we decided to get our rotis to go.  Kori's also has patties, doubles, aloo pie, and rice dishes at pretty reasonable prices. Wash it down with Boylans or nectar. Some things need 24 hours notice (roti shells, parathas) or are only available on Saturday -- you might want to call ahead.  So, their \"peppa\" scale ranges eight options from mild (no pepper) to suicide. I ordered my chicken roti 'medium' which is fourth on the scale. My first few bites were great, but it wasn't until a quarter of the way through that I started to feel the heat. This is good! I like a heat that builds and that still allows flavour through. My roti was a lot to finish though, so it could have been worth it to get a 'mini' one for $2 less. I'll definitely give 'hot' a try next time I go back. And go back I definitely shall.  Obligatory Title Pun: Caribbean to the KORE.  Menu Readability: Definitely a typeface I hate but clearly laid out -- probably in MS Word.  Need to mention: All prices INCLUDE HST!  What this place teaches me about myself: I'll let you whip me if I misbehave."}
{"text":"Found this place randomly and was a pleasant surprise! Had the chicken roti and the chicken was surprisingly, very tender. The spice was perfect amount ( I asked for just a tad of spice and it was a little more spicy than expected but was very tasty and have no complaints) the potato was very soft and the seasoning was just perfect! I was so hungry that time so it was perfect fix! I later found that there is a mini size as well! Will def come here on the reg."}
{"text":"Not bad, but not great either.  I ordered the chicken roti. It had too much potatoes as filler, and didn't have much taste. I could have asked for more hot sauce, but it's very bland  otherwise.   No vegetables inside... Except for if you ask specifically for the vegetable roti."}
{"text":"Had the chicken roti today, wasn't impressed. Way too much potato, and they were out of rice. Medium spice was really spicy.   Might have to make another trip, possibly for lunch, and try the goat roti. Never getting chicken again."}
