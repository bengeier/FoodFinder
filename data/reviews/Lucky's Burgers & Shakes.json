{"text":"Had a 1/4 lb burger with 1,000 & ranch, it was very delicious! I decided to give the fresh squeezed lemonade a try and that was by far the best I have ever had. I finished my meal with a peanut butter/banana shake which was also super yummy! Love love love this place. Service is excellent, quick & friendly! Will be back."}
{"text":"Stopped for the first time on National Cheeseburger day. Looked for burgers spots around me besides fast food chains or \"high end\" burger spots like Habit or Smashburger and this place came up.  Burger was great.  Tasted like a genuine charbroiled homemade burger.  Didn't care too much for the fries since I like thin cut fries and these are thicker.  Price was decent.  I'll definitely come back.  They also have a lot of shake flavors, maybe next time."}
{"text":"Alerted by YELP, I was anxious to try Lucky's.  This small shop in a strip shopping center is homey with modern touches like their sharp chrome seats and black tables. The cashier/owner greeted me upon entering and was very friendly.  

I ordered the ¼ pound burger with American cheese and fries to go. On the way home I couldn't resist trying the fries.  Lucky's fries are beefy shoestrings and uniquely seasoned.  They aren't quite crispy but that is primarily due to using fresh untreated potatoes, not from undercooking.  The fries are fresh, delicious, and have to be homemade.  Mine never made it home.

The burger was also impressive.  The seeded bun was beyond fresh, the meat was tasty, good quality, clearly charbroiled, and cooked to perfection.  The burger was well above the drive-thru cabal and stands up to most of the rest.

I'll be going back regularly.  As a lifetime burger addict, I consider Lucky's a 'find.'  If you're franchised-out, this independent is serving up quality alternatives at very reasonable prices.  Give them a try."}
{"text":"I drove by this place for the last 3 months an kept telling myself I'm going to stop an try it ,so finally after 3 months later I decided to stop.  Now I regret spending my hard earned  $$$$ on a frachise burger. With this minumum wage hike  making every place more expensive to eat at I going to support this small family owned business instead of the corporate sharks,  I hope everyone who reads this will also support this place, Lucky Burger I am Lucky I found you,   from the first time I walked in I felt welcomed the 2 sisters were like sisters I never had , we chatted an laughed like we néw each other for ever, , thank you!!  BIG e out!!!"}
{"text":"came from Tucson and found this place it's small, but really great food and friendly staff can't wait to to go back some day 

the burgers had a very home made taste.
the fries were natural cut and also had home made flavor.
they also have a good combination of shake flavors."}
{"text":"The gyros at luckys are incredible, they do not skimp on the toppings , the burgers are huge and very juicy. The shakes cap off a great meal . The staff is very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"My husband had a burger here a few weeks ago and I had a bite of it. It was so delicious! I just had a burger there and my 11 y/o son who is extremely picky had one also. He was so happy w/ his burger he went to tell the cashier himself how good his burger was. He also loved the brownie shake. Thanks!"}
{"text":"This is my go to place for a good burger. They are down the street from my house and have friendly service. I have tried all most everything but the hotdogs ( not really a hotdog person). The burgers are so good, their gyro are great. The lemonade is amazing you can tell they're homemade which I love. Wish they had bigger sizes. They shakes are awesome. So many flavors and you mix them if you want. All around this place is a great place for a quick bite."}
{"text":"I want to commend Lucky's and the two sisters who operate it for being great neighborhood corporate citizens.  All in the Moon Valley area should support them!"}
{"text":"Hands down best burger I've had in Phoenix! Missed food like this reminded me of my home town mom and pop burger joint, everything was made fresh and fast! Chili cheese fries were fresh and finger licking good! Yum!"}
{"text":"Very good: burgers, chicken sandwich, fries, fresh lemonade and coffee shake.  All good, hot and juicy.   Great service.  Nice and clean.  Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Visiting Phoenix and decided I wanted a burger on my last night here.
I walked inside and I was immediately greeted by a cute and energetic girl who proceeded to take my order.  A 1/2 pound bacon cheese burger with pickles jalapenos lettuce tomato onions ketchup and mayo along with fries and a milkshake. The burger was huge but I squeezed it with both hands and chomped down on it.  It was delish!!!!  and I could not stop myself from greedily proceeding to eat like a slob because it was just so delish that I did not care who was watching. The fries and the shake were equally good. At some point I was just so full that I wondered if I would need to sleep in my far for a few minutes before driving home.  The girl behind the counter was just super friendly and genuinely nice which made the experience that much better.  Thanks!"}
{"text":"Good burgers. Great shakes. Eat here. Owner runs the place with her father cooking. Sweet."}
{"text":"Adorable place with great food and fast friendly service got a cheeseburger with bacon grilled onions grilled jalapeño and thousand island sauce the shakes are really good too and everything on the menu is very affordable"}
{"text":"Best burger I've had in a long time.
Try the double and load it up with bacon.  The charbroiled taste is like right off the grill.  Frys are seasoned and cooked perfect.   Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"First time trying this place and the burger is awesome! The fries are delicious and a banana shake that's to die for. Definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"There were so many things that made this place deserve a 5 rating.  The service was awesome, the fries and shake i had was great, the place was soooo clean!  My goodness, the cashier knew everybody...and this was my first time there and I could tell she was trying to get to know me too.  The sitting area is small, so she would speak to folks in between customers.  You can see right to the back of the kitchen where the gentleman was cooking.  No secrets at this place.  This was my sons first time having a gyro and he is hooked.  This was a far drive for us.  But worth it!"}
{"text":"The owner was Very friendly and helpful.  The  burgers were great,  felt like we were in old school diner ! Got the burger with 1000 island,  yummm!"}
{"text":"Hands down awesome hamburger and shake (peanut butter) so good. Friendly service once you walk in. Clean and upkeep is perfect. Chicken sandwich is good also cheese fried are food. Perfect pricing. The family will be back."}
{"text":"Lucky' Burgers & Shakes. You hidden little gem, you. All tucked into a little strip mall. With a name like that, I just knew this place was gonna be legit and I was right. 

I got the 1/2 lb. burger which is a double quarter pounder, not a 1/2 lb. single patty for those who want to know. All burgers come with your choice of sauces...the staples, mayo, mustard, BBQ, ketchup and they have some homemade sauces, thousand island or ranch. Love that the dressings are homemade. Standard comes with pickles, onion, lettuce, tomato. I got a 1/2 lb burger with homemade thousand island, and the standard toppings, no onion. I normally get onion, but didn't want onion breath today. Lol. I added bacon, green chiles, fries and a shake.   

The Burger was awesome. The fries were awesome. The shake, awesome. So let's start with the burger. It's char broiled. I love char broiled burgers if they're done right. These had the perfect amount of char and smoky flavor. Reminds me of a burger my dad made on the old charcoal grill when I was a kid. The double patties aren't too thick or too thin. Just right. Juicy not dry. Perfect. 
The bun, nice and toasted. The homemade thousand island, outstanding.  The bacon. Real bacon here. Not that microwaved soggy crap. Nice meaty slices of bacon. The way it should be. 5 stars on the burger. 

The fries. I like all types of fries if done right. These fries remind me of how my mom used to make them on the skillet. Take a real potato, cut that mofo up and throw it into hot oil. These are real homemade, fresh cut fries. Just the right amount of tenderness and crisp. Perfect balance. I love fries like this that taste like my mom used to make. 5 stars for the fries. 

The shake. They have 15 flavors for the shake and they let you pick up to 2 flavors. Oh and you can get a shake or a malt. Hell yeah. I didn't notice the malt until after I ordered, or I would have done a malt instead. A ton of possibilities here. I went with an Oreo and peanut butter shake and it was fantastic. These shakes are thick and made from real ice cream. The way it should be. Not some crappy fast food shake dispenser. This is the real deal. 5 stars for the shake. 

The service - what can I say. The girl at the front was friendly, burger was served up fresh and pretty quick. Awesome experience. 

The have dogs, gyros, chili cheese fries. I will be coming back to try the other things on the menu. 

The price.  It's pretty reasonable if you stick with the basic combo of burger fries and a drink. It's definitely worth the price. 

Lucky Burgers and Shakes does it right. Burger fans, if you haven't tried it, you must put this on your list. I will be back."}
{"text":"Best burger I've had in a long time. The prices are decent and they are all friendly there."}
{"text":"I'm here visiting fro Vegas my friend asked if I wanted to go.. When we pulled up I thought umm ok it looks like it will be ok. Don't be fooled by the store front look.. The burger and shakes are amazing! The owner is very friendly and on the front lines greeting you herself! I don't Yelp a lot but I'll be back to say the same!"}
{"text":"Super good burgers and shakes.  Reasonable prices and great service. A small place but worth checking out for sure."}
{"text":"Family run business that concentrates on GREAT sandwiches made over a char grill. The gyros are super, the many different malts are thick. The atmosphere is midwestern and once you've been there a couple times, Michelle and Yolanda call you by name.  Hidden In a small plaza, this burger shop will not fail to please!"}
{"text":"New little mom-and-pop shop. Saw them on Yelp and figured we would give them a try...

Peanut butter shake was AMAZING! 

Great burgers!"}
{"text":"Just heard about this place from a co-worker and I'm glad he recommended it.   Had a bacon charade burger plain (the way I like it) and it was delicious.  The seasoning they put on the fries is good - next time I'll ask for a little extra and the chocolate shake was yum.   I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"This place is awesome...perfect if you want a big, sloppy burger for a great price!!  This beats the competition and is a great way to Shop Local!!"}
{"text":"Good, clean fast food style burger joint. Friendly service but no restrooms. (wouldn't be an issue if you live in the area but we had been running errands and live across town.) 
Fries are fresh cooked from real potatoes. Reminded my husband of Lenny's burger shop but cleaner!
Prices are good too."}
{"text":"Burgers are outstanding. Juicy and charbroiled over open charcoal flame. Better than a back yard burger. 

Best PB Shake I have had in years. Definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"We tried Lucky's for the first time tonight and we will definitely be back!  Burgers, bacon cooked fresh, fresh lettuce/tomato/onion, thousand-island dressing - like a backyard BBQ. The fresh-squeezed lemonade is fresh-squeezed right on the front counter.

Very clean.  Friendly counter staff.  A great neighborhood burger place."}
{"text":"First understand this is just a burger stand. Its basic in so many ways. This isnt the hip new spot that does a burger that has crazy ingredients. This is a simple burger spot with simple selections, hot dog, burger, gyro, frys, shakes and lemonade. What this is though is good. The burger is a half lb burger (30% bigger than a double double) for $4.50. If you want a fast food style burger and are in the area there is no other choice. No one else comes close to flavor/value."}
{"text":"Amazing buegers!! Super awesome service!!! On vacation here from San Diego, Ca. This place has in n out beat!! Apple bees guacala! Meat was fresh, priduce outstanding. Milk shakes are thick! Lemon aid is fresh squeezed, as right there after you pay for it. Amazing!"}
{"text":"This place has always been around and around and around. Absolutely fantastic and always has been for years. The place really does great burgers and fries. Even their ranch is over the top. The burgers are always done and Full of flavor, never over done or under done. Been going here for years and always will!"}
{"text":"Delicious! We were so glad we decided to give it a try! Burgers, fries and shake was so good!! The lady at the counter was very friendly and made sure we got just what we wanted! My only complaint is that they don't have onion rings. We will be back! Think we just found our new burger spot!"}
{"text":"Wow ! The food is excellent and  the people who run the place are incredible. They make all the difference!"}
{"text":"Great hole in the wall burger joint. Great prices and great food. Very nice simple menu and good customer service."}
{"text":"Came with a friend to place to-go order. He really likes this burger shop, saying it was close by & just as good as another shop we both enjoy. I do not agree, unfortunately.

Here are my take aways. I'm big on customer service & I feel like that was top notch here. The sweet girl that took our order was very friendly. The dining room is small and lightly decorated. Chairs are flimsy & uncomfortable.  I like the menu, simple & straighforward. They only have american & swiss cheeses (bummer). The shake tastes as though it is made with the cheapest of ice cream. The fries are decent. The burger was way overcooked for me and the bun over toasted...tasted pretty burnt and chemical like. 

I may give it another try in the future. Maybe not."}
{"text":"Lived up to 5 stars. There for lunch. Very clean. Awesomest of service. Great environment. Burgers so so good. Fresh food. Excellent shake selection and solid taste. Might be our new burger spot for good!"}
{"text":"Tucked into a small strip mall with tight parking Lucky's is a little neighborhood place with nice people and great food.  I got a 1/4lb burger with 1.000 Island, Ranch, American cheese, lettuce, pickles and onion with fries and a soda for a little less than $9.  It was a tasty burger.  Fries were crisp and hot.  I will be back."}
{"text":"The staff was so friendly and helpful, the burgers were delicious and the milkshakes were insanely good! You can mix together any 2 of their 15 flavors. My daughter got a cherry shake with oreos and it was awesome! The fresh squeezed-in-front-of-you lemonade is delightful too."}
{"text":"These guys are awesome! Amazing food and great prices!! Highly recommend for anyone who loves a good burger and a customized milkshake!"}
{"text":"Loved it! Small place, but well worth it. Ordered a double cheeseburger with bacon, swiss and cheddar. Fries were ok, not on five guys level there. Best thing is it is very affordable.  Will come back."}
{"text":"Omg great service, cute looking place and super clean. The fries are delicious the hamburgers are perfect , the vanilla shake super delicious!!!! Highly recommend"}
{"text":"1st time here. Burgers were delicious and juicy. Fries were great and milkshake delish! Friendly woman at the counter, small and clean. 50's/60's music playing in the background. Will be back again. So glad we found today. A hidden gem . EnO"}
{"text":"super tasty burgers and shakes, friendly team and clean, cant be beat ! the jalapenos and green chili is a big plus, lots of options is sauces as well."}
{"text":"will say this place is a hidden gem! definitely a hole in the wall with great burgers and hotdogs. very simple food and excellent customer service polite and attentive. the shakes are also great not to thick not to thin just right constancy. recommend this place for sure"}
{"text":"Charbroiled burgers and yummy malts! The cinnamon and vanilla malt was SO SO delicious! The girl at the counter was friendly, funny and helpful! We really enjoyed our trip! Thanks yelp for always leading us to these great hole in the walls! I love them!"}
{"text":"GREAT BURGERS GREAT PRICE GREAT SHAKES GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE!! We've been waiting for this place to open for a while and it was worth the wait! Will definitely be coming back often!!"}
{"text":"Service was excellent. Quaint, unassuming location nestled in a pedestrian strip mall. The restaurant is very clean. The 1/2 lb burger with thousand island is excellent. The oreo shake is also a tasty treat and pairs nicely."}
{"text":"Hamburgers and fries.

Price is outstanding and so are the fries! The young lady running the front is efficient and polite, I really enjoyed my plate and my visit in general! I am told that the milk shakes are the bomb so will be skipping lunch today in favor of a frosty treat! I will update then!"}
{"text":"Hole in wall burger joint.  Read insane reviews so let's try it.    Over all good quick burger lunch with excellent service by front counter girl.   Small little place in a strip mall around the corner from thunderbird high school.   But good stuff.   Fresh squeezed lemonade and shakes were both very good.  Burgers were good but kind of standard. No speciality burgers.  Build your own with standard ingredients and only cheddar and American cheese.  Buns were seceme seed and very ordinary.    I was actually a little disappointed as all the reviews said this place was to die for and cheap.  23$ for my son and I.   I've had some excellent burger in my time as I seek a place out everywhere we travel for the kids sports but this was good but not great."}
{"text":"Went their twice last week.  I got the burger and fries great meal.  Second time I got the grilled chicken and fries.  The chicken was very good but I prefer the burger.  The food is a great price.  The fries OMG amazing and the homemade thousand island.  They have fresh squeezed lemonade which I have been thinking about the last 2 days it's that good.  The food comes out freshly made in under 10 minutes.  This place will be in my rotation of lunch spots.  The ladies behind the register are friendly as can be.  To sum it up Great Food, Great Value, Great Service.  I think I am going to try the milkshake next time.  They only have 15 flavors."}
{"text":"I was looking for a good charbroiled burger and I was definitely not disappointed.  The burger was tasty, the service was great, and the restaurant was clean and comfortable.  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place has the best burgers and fries. The shakes are on point as well. Service is fast and Friendly and the business is family owned."}
{"text":"Fantastic Burgers and Shakes took my son here yesterday and it was delicious!! Very very clean little place very friendly employees as well"}
{"text":"My son goes to Thunderbird High School and has been telling me how good this place is so we came in and had burgers and shakes and it was one of the best burgers I've ever had. Everything was also fresh. The girl who took our order was very friendly and nice. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"I've been to Lucky's a few times and love the burgers and shakes here. The prices are beyond reasonable for what you get...the burgers are large, very juicy and delicious. The shakes are thick and yummy. This is a wonderful family business and everyone is very friendly and inviting. I hope they are here to stay for a very long time. This will be my go to place for a delicious burger every time!"}
{"text":"I tried the reg burger and fries and thought everything was good, the fries in particular were AMAZING! The burger was good. It wasn't great but it was really good.

The staff is polite. Meals are served from a counter so there isn't a whole lot of interaction with them.

My expectation is that this 4 star will be a 5 star after I have had a milkshake because I hear they are the best in the valley."}
{"text":"Super friendly staff!  Fresh squeezed lemonade made right in front of you.  Awesome gyros and homemade burgers!  Butterfinger shake was good too!"}
{"text":"The burger was indeed super delicious. I love how the whole thing was toasted before it was served. Good size to split. Fries with the seasoning salt were awesome as well! Can't say the same for the shake unfortunately. My brownie milkshake was all shades of disappointing. Maybe go with a plain vanilla or chocolate next time."}
{"text":"Great mom and pop joint. Nothing Corp about this grade \"A\" burger. Very tasty, fairly priced and I'm happy we found this site after a trip from east valley. If you like burgers, you will not be dissapointed!"}
{"text":"Didn't know what to expect and have to say the burgers tasted great and fresh ! The French fries fresh and with the skins. They do mix malts with at least 3 flavors! I chose coconut, strawberry and banana flavor!"}
{"text":"First experience and let me say this place is awesome the burger taste perfect and juicy the fries were amazing and vanilla shake was delicious and I understand you can't go wrong with vanilla shakes but this had the taste! I definitely recommend this place. I had friends told me to go here. I waited to long cause this place is amazing! Keep up the good work. Plus I like it how it's a family restaurant. They stay together and work as a team!!"}
{"text":"Charbroiled burgers are nice and big.....they fit a large bun!  You can order it \"just the way you want it\" and with whatever toppings you desire.  The burger will be cooked while you wait patiently, not before you order it!
I ordered the gyro.....It was HUGE!  There was plenty of everything good on it, but I thought the meat was a little dry.  The orders of fries were generous, and they were nicely cooked to a golden brown.  It is a rarity to find a shop which offers \"shakes/malts\", and if you order a malt you won't be unhappy!  It had a lot of nice malty flavor, was thick enough that we had to 'work' to get it up through the straw(perhaps a spoon would help!)  You couldn't ask for nicer counter/order staff!  The sitting area is clean and pleasant and the nostalgia on the walls will keep you entertained as you wait for your FRESH food!"}
{"text":"Burgers are good fries are mediocre but the service is always on point! I could definitely see myself eating here every other week or getting food for the staff!"}
{"text":"Great food. SUPER clean. Fast. Took the whole family. We tried everything from gyros, big burgers, and even corn dogs. Try the cinnamon malt. WowZers. Great value!!"}
{"text":"The burgers, chili cheese fries and shakes were delicious! Very clean place and the service was excellent. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I love this place! It's right by my apartment and  not only are the staff super friendly but the gyros are bomb. I wish they just went all greek and had some chicken schrawma cause I know it would be fantastic. Wish they had balaclava too! Either way great little place"}
{"text":"Where can you get a burger, fry & drink for cheap anymore that's from a local spot that is good? I can't think of many places, but this place comes to mind. Its simple but delicious. I got a burger with mayo & pickles, fries, & drink for a little under $8. The food is made to order because you can see them cooking in the back. The burger is so good & I love how they season their fries. I hear their shakes are insanely good, but I have yet to try one. The customer service is excellent which adds to the entire experience. The restaurant is fairly small with about 6 or 7 tables, so I ordered it to go."}
{"text":"Staff here is friendly and helpful, tried this place twice and will not be coming back. 

The first time I tried the 1/4 burger and it tasted alright but it tasted like a burger king burger.

Went back a second time a got a meal. The fries were excellent and cooked perfectly. The burger was a huge disappointment. It was extremely greasy and didn't taste great. In-n-out has much better burgers and half the cost."}
{"text":"I am a gourmet chef and in general I'm pretty hard on restaurants.  The food has to be at least as good as I make at home.  Well, I tell ya, Lucky's burgers beat mine by a long shot.  I tried Lucky's for the first time yesterday and I have to say that Lucky's burgers are better tasting than any of the chain burgers, even 5Guys.  The place was CLEAN! The staff was very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"The shopping center may be a bit trashy, but Lucky's has a Mom and Pop feel once inside. The burgers are made to order, as are the fries and both quite tasty. My biggest complaint is they could have given us more fries in the order. Otherwise, support local businesses such as this one and get your charbroil fix!"}
{"text":"Yum!!  I've been all over the United States and I've tried different cuisines.  I'm very picky about food and specially gyros.  I must say this gyro sandwich was delicious.  I like that the sauce was served in the side because other places put to much on them and u can't taste anything but sauce.  That gyro sandwich was perfectly assemble I could see all the tasty ingredients.  Just delicious.  Also. The place is very clean and the customer service is fantastic. Not like other restaurants. If you know what I mean.  This place is a family own restaurant. The chef and may I ask thank you is the owner. And I believe the young lady at the register is the daughter. So also the owner. Perfect customer service. I'll sure be back to try the chicken sandwich and burgers. Thank you all. 
Ps. The music they play is nice and calm. Very pleasant."}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and just go.  The burgers are delicious. The Gyro's are amazing and the shakes are brilliant.  The staff is awesome.  Just go!!!!!"}
{"text":"Fresh Lemonade ,they make it RIGHT THERE AND THEN. As for the burger, it is really really really good. I would've normally had a pic but on my first visit I couldn't stop eatin cause I was so surprised. The stars are deserved."}
{"text":"We're from out of state, so around dinner time, we turned to yelp for recommendations. We were in the mood for burgers, so this is where we landed. We were skeptical at first because 5 stars is awesome, but only 35 reviews at the time of our visit. As a budget place goes, it's pretty good. It's a simple menu, which I like and they had a few customization options available. I ordered a grilled chicken sandwich with bacon, Swiss cheese, jalapeños, and barbecue sauce with regular fries and a brownie shake. The chicken was lean and juicy, jalapeños were fresh, bacon was perfect (not too soggy, not too crispy). I was very satisfied with the sandwich. The fries are a little soft for my particular taste, but the seasoning on them was good. The shake was delicious, if you have a lighter appetite like I do I would suggest sharing it lol. My boyfriend got the 1/2lbs burger with American cheese, barbecue sauce, jalapeños, and bacon with chili cheese fries and a diet pepsi. He was very satisfied with the burger, it was well cooked and delicious. He said if we went again he probably altogether get the chili cheese fries because it doesn't feel like $2 worth of chili & cheese (which is the price difference between regular and chili cheese). Overall, we are happy with our decision to eat here. It's what you can expect from a diner type place. 

The staff was friendly. The seating area was, but it was fine and there was a very short wait for the food."}
{"text":"The food took a while but was good, prices aren't bad. 

The metal chairs were probably the most uncomfortable I've ever sat on.

Gyro I had was tasty, wife and kids liked the burgers.

I thought the fries were too salty and the tea tasted like it was left over from day before.

Overall not bad"}
{"text":"We stopped in here for a quick dinner after my son's baseball game. The girl in the front (Yolanda?) Was so personable and nice! And the cook went out of his way to accommodate a request my kid made. There seemed to be a steady flow of regulars coming in the whole time we were there. Our burgers and shakes were delicious! My 8 year old said her chocolate shake was the best she's ever had! We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Time Magazine (MONEY and Yelp) just ranked this place as one of the top 10 burger joints in the entire country so our family had to try it out! I really like Portillo's burgers and fries as well as Mama Burger's hamburgers from a flattop grill in Flagstaff, AZ so I was curious how this place stacks up. The 1/2 pound cheeseburger with the homemade thousand island/ranch sauce was flavorful and the fries were excellent. Toppings were placed on the bottom! I never tasted a burger like that before. The fresh squeezed lemonade was refreshing (it's 113 F outside today). Lucky's is a new family favorite!

For those of you who read the Time Magazine article, Yolanda's sister is named Michelle hahaha!"}
{"text":"Yes, yes, & yes! It's always great to find lil hole in the wall mom and pop shops that end up blowing your expectations out of the water! Say no to five guys, no to caveman, no to Burger King and yes to Lucky's!  The burgers are so delicious and you san actually smell the char from the grill. One of the few places that offers chili as a topping (which so happens to be my favorite way to eat a burger). Bacon was crispy as requested, and the Swiss cheese was a perfect switch up from the standard American/cheddar. 

Cannot wait to be back to my new favorite burger joint! Amazing quality at an affordable price."}
{"text":"Sooo GOOD!  Great little place to grab a burger. If you haven't tried yet you should. Yum!"}
{"text":"Today was my first time eating here! I must say I was truly impressed. The service was fast and the food was delicious. I had 1/4 lb burger with American cheese, green chile, 1000 Island Dressing and pickles. The family who owns it are very friendly. I highly recommended this place."}
{"text":"The atmosphere: Pulling up to the plaza my first thought was \"eww\" but Don't let the dingy plaza fool you inside this place is clean, well organized and even kind of cute. It gave me takeout vibes but there are definitely seating areas if you choose to dine in .
Food: SO GOOD. Not amazing not out of this world just really really good but not necessarily the juiciest burger I've ever had. I got the 1/2 burger with all the veggies (lettuce tomato onion pickle +mayo& bacon)Their burgers are charbroiled which I don't mind but if that's not your thing just an FYI. All in all I'd go here before I ever stop at a BK, Wendy's or McD's but it kind of stacks up next to In N Out and Smash burger.

Customer service/price :cashier was so nice I felt like I was at chick-fil-a... no need for further explanations. I called in my order and they were bagging up my food as I walked up to the counter. Price was fair I might of paid about 11-13 bucks & it was a big burger just wish I was given more of those delicious fries.

Reasons I'll return : FOR THE FRIESSS they are DELICIOUS well seasoned, crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. And because you got to support local business !!"}
{"text":"Lucky's has been buried deep within my bookmarks for awhile now, so I finally decided to see what all of the Yelp hoopla was about. Be prepared that this is a hole-in-the-wall burger shop, with just a few tables and a simplistic menu that includes burgers, hot dogs, gyros, and shakes. In some ways, it kind of reminds me of Rocket Burger down on Cactus, sans the massive soda inventory.

My girlfriend and I both ordered quarter pound patty burgers which we customized to our liking, along with a side of fries. I'm not sure if they've changed things up since one reviewer criticized their buns for not being toasted - as ours most definitely were. They opt for the charbroiled approach with their meat.

The burgers were fine if you're comparing it against fast food level stuff. In fact, if you live in the area, I'm sure this is a very respectable alternative to what else is available. However, if you're going out of your way with the expectation of finding some mind-blowing five-star burger that's comparable to some of the heavy hitters deeper into the city, you'll probably wind up just a tad disappointed. The burgers are definitely above average, so I'll give them some credit here. The seasoned fries? Eh. Just standard stuff, I guess.

Although I'm in no rush, we'll probably return at some point to experiment with some of their other items. I suggest checking them out for yourself."}
{"text":"Really good food, super cheap, and amazing staff. It's in a strip mall but super cute inside. We will be back for sure"}
{"text":"My wife and I live right across the street from this place. We decided to give it a try since it is new. I've worked with food for many years, and this place exceeded our expectations. My burger looked amazing and tasted even better! Fries are fresh cut, and lemonade is made right in front of you with fresh lemons. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Mom-and-pop family owned/operated restaurant. 

I walked in on a Saturday night and there was only one couple inside. The place was surprising a lot smaller (and less busy) than what I imagined it to be. 

I was impressed by the large selection of shakes and the hand squeezed lemonade. 

I ordered the 1/4 lb burger with cheese and fries and a drink. In my opinion the only good/unique/different part of the meal was the fries. The seasoning was very delicious, but I couldn't help but notice how soggy (?) the fries were. Not very crispy. 

The burger wasn't really anything too special. It reminded me of a frozen pre-made patty that they just slap on the grill. The bun is just a standard store bought bun (they didn't toast it or anything). And the drink selection is very minimal -- just a small collection of sodas from the machine, some of which included Pepsi, Diet Pepsi, and Brisk Iced Tea. 

And the super friendly service? Hm, not too sure. The girl wasn't rude but she seemed like she was forcing herself to greet us, and she didn't even put a smile on. Maybe it's because they had a long day. Maybe it was because of their lack of customers on a Saturday night. 

Overall the Yelp reviews made this place sound like some sort of burger heaven, when, really, it's just another average burger \"shop\". I can understand, however, because I can tell the family just opened the business and have a low budget. 

$25+ dollars on 3 people is a little pricey considering the area and quality of food/service.

Best wishes to the family, but if you're looking for a quality burger place then I'd suggest going elsewhere."}
{"text":"The best for burgers! I'll never go to any of those fast food joints ever again (McD, JITBOX, WEND, BK)
The Gyros are yummy too"}
{"text":"Omg soo bomb! I had the chicken sandwich with jalapenos and bacon. Will never go anywhere else from now on!!"}
{"text":"Met my hubby for lunch here, burgers were good and the pineapple shake was amazing. Will come back to get another gyro. Girl at the front was super nice!"}
{"text":"We live nearby and saw this place open, thought we should give it a try after checking them out online. It's got great atmosphere, cute and clean. The staff were very nice and personable. The 1/4 lb burger is one patty, 1/2 lb is two. There is a very simple menu. Burgers are made to order using the options they post. Only two cheese choices, but I didn't mind. You get your order from the counter when it's ready. The shakes are thick and enjoyable. Two people could easily share one as they are very rich. The fries tasted good. The burgers had some strange aftertaste, maybe from whatever grease was on the griddle? I had a hard time getting past that. My kids enjoyed the burgers and fries. Neither of them could finish their shake. Half of each went into the trash. We probably won't be back, unless the kids want to go. Then I'd just get them food and not anything for myself. We didn't try the gyros, but it looked like the standard gyro that most Greek places sell."}
{"text":"Amazing burgers ! Simple menu and fast service! Definitely will recommend to more people I know."}
{"text":"OMG!! This place is amazing. Not only is the food GREAT so are the people that work here. Yolanda Is such a sweet girl, she really makes this place fun and very family like. She knows almost everyone's name and has a great attitude!! This is the third time my son and I have gone in and we will be back!! 
Sad to say they needed to raise all their prices. STILL AMAZING!!!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my experience here!!! I ordered a hamburger with extra jalapeños and it was delicious! The fries have a great seasoning to them as well!!! Definitely a customer for life!!!"}
{"text":"From the time I walked in to this place, I could tell I was going to have a great experience. The service was great and fast. The burgers were exactly what you dream about."}
{"text":"Great food, wonderful service, excellent value, and FRESH ingredients right down to the fresh squeezed lemonade made right in front of you. Can't wait to try a malt next time!"}
{"text":"Burgers are very good, are cooked over an open flame, have that great char broil taste! Very similar to Luck Boy on 16 st. I am craving one as I write this. I am very finicky about my burgers, this place is now in my rotation..."}
{"text":"I've only had a burger but it was great. Quality of meat and produce was excellent. Very generous with the add-ons (jalapeños in my case). The cashier was as friendly as they come. Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"This place was really good! Got a gyro, fries, and a shake. All of them were delicious! And the service was amazing. The girl working there was so fun, and good at her job."}
{"text":"Outstanding burgers and fries with great value, highly recommended.  We have eaten their twice now basing that we live close and just found this place.  It will be in our normal rotation, best burger in the Moon valley!"}
{"text":"Great little place, mom/pop run, contemporary look on the inside. Outside doesn't look like much, run down shopping center.
Food is awesome! Lip licking charbroiled taste, melted American cheese, low price($8) for 1/2 pound burger ( 2 patties), soda (20 ounce), fries fresh cut. 
If you're \"fluffy\" chairs are a little shaky and uncomfortable. 
Not recommended for large crowds, tables sit 4.
Pepsi products, ( I can forgive) 15 flavors of shakes, can combine two flavors before extra charges. 
Very good eats!"}
{"text":"This was our first time eating here and it was delicious and very affordable. I got a 1/2 lb. Burger and it was pretty big and the fries where awesome. The cashier was so friendly and the food was fresh. We will definitely come back especially since we live so close."}
{"text":"We tried Lucky's yesterday. It is a small restaurant in a non-descript strip mall. They have a limited menu, but I liked that. You order at the counter and then pick up your food when it is ready. They serve burgers, hot dogs, chicken sandwiches and gyros. The first three items are \"charbroiled.\" I ordered a double cheeseburger with bacon. They top their burgers with lettuce, tomato, pickles, and onions. In addition, you can choose ketchup, mustard, mayo, housemade ranch or thousand island. 
The burger was well prepared and had that great charred flavor. I also ordered french fries which were well seasoned, but a little under-done for my taste. (I like my fries crispy.) They also use Hunt's ketchup and I am a Heinz fan.
Lucky's also serves shakes and malts. They have 15 different flavors and I chose chocolate. It was very good.
The person behind the counter was friendly and helpful. I'm looking forward to going back to try some other items."}
{"text":"Finally stopped in here. The menu has burgers, dogs, gyros, fries and shakes. Thats about it. The green chili burgers, fries and banana shake are all great. The staff (both of them) were friendly and quick. Its a tiny place but its clean and efficient! A burger will run you about what a whopper does but its better. Don't hesitate to try this place! Oh, there's no public restrooms btw...so plan accordingly."}
{"text":"Best burger I have had in a long time. The small town america cafe works very well for their setup and the shakes are delicious! Totally unassuming cafe from the outside, but open up the door to find Americana atmosphere that matches their food so well.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Best place for burgers!!!! I just moved to AZ about a year ago and have been searching for a place like this!!! A co-worker always orders from here and she's always telling me to go, finally I went and it is now my FAVE place!!!"}
{"text":"Everything said about them is true. Very friendly staff. Off the hook food! Chili cheese fries-awesome! Shakes the best! Hot dog is great, Burgers the bomb! Little menu. BIG taste!"}
{"text":"1/30/18 evening

The only reason this place doesn't get 1 star is the service and seating area was fantastic! The young woman was patient and checked on us, unfortunately a rarity. The food was NOT GOOD! The 1/2 lb burger is small and lacks flavor or juiciness. No signature seasoning on the fries or something to distinguish this place. Price isn't even good all those things considered. IMO, Lenny's & Freddy's & Rocket burger & even In n out/Red Robin is better."}
{"text":"Omggg amazing burgers and amazing service. Green chilies and jalapeños are a must try!"}
{"text":"I've been in here a few times over the past few days and all I can say is that it's been a very pleasurable experience. I have tried most things on the menu and I must say it's really really good! The burgers are awesome! The shakes are incredible. And the service is stellar. It's very clean inside with ample seating. I honestly don't think I can find any negatives here. Keep up the great work guys, you have a customer here that's very happy and will be returning frequently!"}
{"text":"Went there last night for burgers before a play.  The burgers were fine.  Received exactly what we ordered.  The patties themselves were ok - a bit dry and perhaps more cooked than my normal liking, toppings were good, buns were good.  Fries were amazing.  Shakes were amazing as well.  Staff was very friendly.  Next time, I'd get the 1/2 lb burgers - they are probably more juicy as they are thicker.  Overall, a good value for the money as well."}
{"text":"Wanted a good burger so we trusted help and gave lucky burgers a try.

Glad we did!

Really FRESH ingredients and very clean kitchen. The gyro was absolutely amazing. If you want real food it's here!"}
{"text":"GOTTA TRY THIS PLACE!! 
Awesome family owned Burger Joint offers amazing flavors & good vibes!! Every comes out hot & fresh. I would put this burger against any other burger. Not fancy, just fresh and cooked to perfection!!"}
{"text":"Thanks to Yelp we gave this mom and pop a try tonight, we were impressed by the rave reviews. My parents live 5 minutes away and had never even heard of it before!  People need to get the word out because this place is a GEM!  Great food, outstanding service and a bargain to boot. My parents had gyros, they are huge!  They put an incredible amount of meat on them. I had a cheeseburger and I loved it. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Excellent!! Loved it! Gotta bring the fam. I had the green Chile burger and butterscotch shake. Both were delicious! Shakes are big for the $!"}
{"text":"Awesome peanut butter shake. the hamburger is off the hook green chillies and musterd and fresh fries"}
{"text":"So good!  This small little burger and shake place is the place to go. Huge beautiful burgers, very friendly staff, and great food! 

One of the best burgers I have ever had!"}
{"text":"This is the best little burger joint around.  The two ladies who own/run this place are adorable and awesome.  My boyfriend is a Big Burger Guy and he loves the place.  Me?  I'm a little burger gal and I can't get enough.  The fries are to die for.  And try the lemonade.  O. M. G.  Love this place so much.  It's inexpensive, clean and bright. It's going to be Our Place from now on."}
{"text":"This is a great place for a burger and the fresh squeezed lemonade is the BEST!  The prices are reasonable and the place is SO CLEAN!  The shakes are to die for too!!!  The owners are super nice and accommodating.  You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"It's was a beautiful fall day when I stumbled upon this establishment. I was cautiously optimistic being the location was a little rough looking, but once inside I was filled with a settling calm due to the cleanliness and smiling staff. She greeted me like we've know each other for years and with a warm welcome she guided me through what I soon found out a burger that not only exceeded my taste expectations but brought me to a nostalgic place, when times were simpler and life was less complicated. Stop by if in the area and experience for yourself the simple deliciousness that encompasses the 1/4 hamburgers."}
{"text":"Great burgers and fries. Brownie shake was yummy. Friendly, fast service at great price"}
{"text":"I love mom and pop shops.  This place delivers on yummy eats.  We had burgers, fries, fresh squeezed lemonade and a shake.  The shakes are so good my boyfriend got one to go and we took one to my sister.  Everyone was so nice,  really made us feel welcome.  Plus it's always awesome to see that A rating!  This place was super clean, not a smudge on a table!  Yummy, clean and reasonable prices...ummm yeah we'll go back for sure."}
{"text":"First time trying this burger shop, burger was great, 1/2 pounder was just the right size, was not sloppy but was not dry. Frys were fantastic and the peanut butter shake was phenomenal. Service excellent, overall all loved it and can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"ive been here a handful of times for lunch because its just that good! i recently found it nearby my work so once a week i stop by for a cheeseburger and fries and a malt shake. the lady at the front is super nice..both of them are and the burgers are made fresh when you order.the fries are awesome with some kind of special seasoning. must try this hidden gem out! it can be a lil pricey but its well worth it"}
{"text":"The burgers were good the frys were great and super hot. The shakes were as expected great!"}
{"text":"I love being able to live across the street from this burger joint. Anytime I am craving some delicious grub, I always jet immediately to Lucky's. They are extremely personable, while also serving yummy food. I love the Butterscotch milkshake, french fries (they use seasoning salt, yum), and bacon cheeseburger."}
{"text":"Super cute little burger shop. The burgers are tasty and juicy. The fries are delicious. The fresh squeezed lemonade was yummy. And the real ice cream milk shakes are amazing! Great, friendly  service. We will return!"}
{"text":"Excellent little Burger Shop in the Moon Valley area. Customer service is on point friendly and attentive. Food is cooked to order fresh hot and crispy. Very good burger and fries. One of the owners Yolanda is very appreciative and attentive of her business and her service to you. If you're in the area I highly suggest checking it out. I will be back for sure. Keep up the great work guys."}
{"text":"I was looking for a great, simple, juicy burger and this is just the place. Friendly staff, clean environment. It was my first time in and I will def be coming back!"}
{"text":"We tried Lucky's for the first time a few weeks ago and we are hooked! Some family members are not too enthused about trying new places and they've been back on their own to Lucky's! The burgers are so good and we've watched them cook the bacon as we order. The fries are very good too! The milkshakes are the best ones we've ever had - love getting to combine flavors, Oreo and vanilla is our fave! 

The gals at the front are always very helpful and friendly too! If you haven't visited, I definitely recommend trying Lucky's!!"}
{"text":"The place was great!  Burger was cooked to perfection and was made with pride....some places just throw their stuff together, but this place makes your burger look like its photo ready.  The corn dogs are delicious.  The only down side was the fries.  They were good, but not great.  It was as if the oil they were cooked in was old and hadn't been changed.  Still tolerable.  Overall I would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"We saw that Lucky's was open with the already positive reviews and we are happy to add our thumbs up- we ordered ours to go- we live basically down the street so we knew it would still be hot! 

We ordered 1/2 lb burgers, fries well done- all cooked beautifully and with the correct toppings we ordered! We loved the char-broiled burger and was in a nice roll- bacon was excellent as well. 

We also had to try a hot dog- and it was super! Jumbo was split and charbroiled as well- best I've had since moving here from NJ! 

Finally, had to try the lemonade which was made right before our eyes- yum!!!! 

Everything is cooked to order so don't expect a rush job- it's worth the wait. 

We'll be back!"}
