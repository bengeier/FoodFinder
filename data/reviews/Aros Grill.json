{"text":"Horrible service. Never got waited on. Never never go there. Rude.  Waited 30 minutes no food didn't care we were unhappy gave one star cause that's the lowest you can do"}
{"text":"WOW!!! Is all I can say. We decided to check out the new neighborhood spot and man do I wish I never even walked in the door. We go in on a Saturday afternoon to get some lunch, for my birthday, there is not much of a crown in there which is nice. Our drink order is taken and drinks arrive within a few minutes. Water was spilled all over just barely missing my father in law and my daughters lemonade was not brought. But hey no big deal accidents happen. Well we then wait another 15 minutes before someone even comes back to take our order. We had a conversation at the table as to if we should leave and go some where else or not. But we make the fateful decision to stick it out. Finally someone comes back to take our order and we then wait another 30 minutes for our food to come out. My mother in law orders a swiss and mushroom burger and there are NO mushrooms she asks for some and we are told they are under the cheese, but no such luck they are not under the cheese. I ordered a grilled turkey and swiss on sourdough I took one bite and it was enough!! I told our server to take it back and please remove it from the bill. She asked if I wanted anything else which the answer was no. No one was pleased with there meal at all. I then got up and walked over to Spinatto's where I dined on a scrumptious calzone!!"}
{"text":"Bought a groupon for this place, not somewhere to go for dinner. Tried their tacos, quesadilla, chips and guacamole all of which were sub par. This place really needs help on their menu. That being said, there still is a use for this place if you are looking to catch a game with the boys (or girls) and have a few cheap beers. They have a decent number of screens to catch the games on. I also noticed that it was a Oakland Raiders bar, so for the 13 fans in Phoenix, this is your place. Being somewhat in my neighborhood I would be willing give this place a second chance if they got some help with their food."}
{"text":"I went into Aro's grill since I had a groupon and thought I would give it a try.  They were in the middle of revamping the place and renaming it Cowboy grill or something similar.  We were the only people in there.  The place was nice and clean inside, and server was friendly.

It took forty minutes to get our food.  That is not an exaggeration.  We only had a hour for lunch so we had to get it to go.  I ordered the western burger with french fries.  I asked for it medium it was well done.  I understand we got it to go, but I assume it was well done since we waited forty minutes.  The bbq sauce was your standard bbq sauce from the grocery store.  The bacon was good though, but that was it.  My friend got the nachos, and it came with the cheap spicy nacho cheese.  Not something that was worth $7 and this was without meat.  My other friend ordered the fish and chips and she ended up throwing up because it was so greasy.  Overall I was not impressed with this place.  I'm not one to complain about a restaurant, but we were the only ones in there.  I was also a server, bartender, and manager so I understand that people have bad days, but it really wasn't a good experience.  Our server never apologized for the delay as well.  

All in all I would not go back to this place."}
{"text":"I wouldn't recommend this restaurant. the service stinks!!!!and the drinking cups (plastic) should be changed, looks so old and denty.

 ***NOTE: re-check your tab, we got overchanged by 20%, had to come back and get my money back! 

That groupon deal is totally a bummer!!!! $16.99 for 18 pcs of wings! outrageously over-priced!!!!!

ONE STAR IS DEF OVERLY A HIGH SCORE!!!"}
{"text":"After reading through all the reviews for this place I was a bit apprehensive to even bother to try this place and use the Groupon I purchased - especially with my wife and four of the pickiest eating children in the US.

We arrived at 6pm on a Sunday night and, except for one other table of people, we were the only people in the dining area (although there were 6-10 people in the bar area.  Evidently the reviews have affected the business because we did not find anything to complain about.

We had a wide variety of food off the menu (of course) because none of my kids like the same thing and they all require 'special' orders - i.e., no mayo, plain burger, extra this, none of that.  My wife had a salad, and it was large and fresh - she will send it back for anything brown or distasteful.  Everything my kids ordered (wings, burger, blt & chicken strips) was eaten - and they liked it!  I had a bacon cheeseburger and it was very good too.

Our waiter busted ass taking care of us, even while he was the only one working tables and three or four more groups had come in by the time we left.  There were a lot of TV monitors to watch, and I think the place provided the atmosphere they advertise.  

I have eaten at a great number of 'high-end' restaurants (Ruth's Chris, Christophers, Morton's, Vincents on Camelback, etc.) - and this isn't one of those - but if you're looking for somewhere you can relax and watch a game while eating good food, this is exactly what you're looking for."}
{"text":"WOW! Looks great inside! MUCH nicer that Sport Peppers was... BUT it was very quiet (customer wise) the food was so so? Bacon Bacon Burger but we had to get the Bacon after the food was delivered, they forgot the bacon! Prices are decent, and service was OK, i'd go back but not in a rush..."}
{"text":"Quiet and dark. Looks nicer and cleaner inside than when it was Sport Peppers, although its still a dive. I came for lunch one day when driving past my old neighborhood. I ordered a cheeseburger and my boyfriend got a chicken caesar wrap. Both of our meals were decent, no complaints really, and reasonably priced. The bartender was our waitress, which was fine because only one person was sitting at the bar. She was friendly. It was a weekday probably around 11am or so. Although I don't have anything to rave about, it was a nice, quiet lunch and a good escape from the heat thats already upon us. I would go back. The dj table in the corner looked intriguing."}
{"text":"Wow. Such horrible reviews. I feel bad for them because I had a decent time on Wednesday night. A friend of mine wanted to try this place out. Sure why not, plus I was able to get a Groupon now for $15 for $30 worth of food and drinks. Not too shabby. We sit at the bar and the bartender was friendly enough but you could tell that she was more focused on her regulars that were there. It wasn't a bad thing, just an observation. The beer mugs are huge and my friend was in beer heaven. I think they were at least 25oz? maybe? I ended up only have one drink since I was the designated driver of the evening and it was ok. I really didn't taste much alcohol, but then again it was a bad thing since I was the DD. They have a burger and fry special, that is all day and is $2.99. Be warned, if you are using  a Groupon, the price is $4.99. (what the heck is up with that?) We also had wings and sweet potato fries. Not to shabby for bar food but a tad bit on the expensive side.

On Wednesday nights that have a variety of bands that play starting at around 8pm. The bands were actually pretty good, just a little loud, but not to shabby. All in all it was a decent spot to come and to talk (scream when the band played) eat, and drink. I may come again when it is a little more quiet just to give it another try."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place! Great service, the servers all know me and speak when I come in. They have a wonderful menu - the grilled wings, carne asada fries, quesadilla and burgers are all tasty and fresh. Friday and Saturday nights they have a wonderful DJ, playing the latest dance music. And their bar is fully stocked with a great top-shelf variety. They also have happy-hour specials that last much longer than the standard 2 or 3 hours. Try it!"}
{"text":"I visited Aros with the hubster for its grand opening. After the steep decline of Sport Peppers over the past few years, we were hoping for some rejuvenated ambiance (aka no more sports themed upholstery) and some higher quality vittles (aka wings bigger than my pinky finger, which is pretty tiny). 

A spiffy bouncer in a suit greeted us at the door (we're not in Kansas anymore, Toto!) and we made our entree. Oh wait, between the bouncer and the grand entrance the hostess actually huffed in front of us and let the door shut in our faces. And then disappeared.

Standing alone and confused at the front, we had several minutes to soak in some of the new: new and improved bar area, open seating, ambient lighting, lots of flat screens, and... a stage and an area for dancing?

That's right. A live band was playing and folks were shaking it. The band was really enjoyable and played a bunch of R&B crowd pleasers, and the chance to get down on it is always a welcome one in my book.

We chose a table near the back and perused the menu: lots of things in \"baskets\", but of course we had to sample the one true barometer of any bar food (\"bar\"-ometer, get it?): wings. Traditional, no-nonsense, hot. 

Oh, disappointment! The flavor was fine, but the wings were puny and soggy. Like wet nuggets with bones. We tried some tacos, too, but they were just 'meh'. 

A note: let your staff sample the menu! One item was described to us as \"I haven't tried those but no one has complained yet.\"

All of the food was delivered in paper baskets and a roll of paper towels was plunked on the table. Frankly, I was a little taken aback. The quality of food and service seemed entirely at odds with the seemingly upscale strivings of the place.

I am deeply pained to give Aros Grill only a two-star review- I want to love it! I really, really do! But like the name 'Aros' whose meaning I can't figure out, this grill just didn't seem to make a lot of sense."}
{"text":"So far I've had 2 experiences here at Aros. 

The 1st one was just plain disappointing based on the quality of the food. I ordered a turkey wrap and the meat seemed like it was bought at Fry's and they didn't even finish wrapping the food all the way so EVERYTHING fell out. I ordered a few drinks but they seemed a bit weak. My boyfriend and I left after an hour.

The 2nd visit on the other hand was awesome! My boyfriend and I stayed away from the food and just ordered drinks. The bartender (Johnny, NY accent) was VERY attentive even after I had asked him to make 1 drink a bit stronger. From there we had (strong) shots and drinks and next thing I know it's past midnight and I'm snockered. It was a great time and his energy and conversation made for a great night.

So, if I'd suggest anything go here for drinks and Johnny. He'll ensure you have a good time no matter how many people are in the bar."}
{"text":"Since we have been to aros grill, my boyfriend and I both experienced horrible food poisoning and horrible customer service. Tonight at the bar, the bartender is more concerned about her fake eyelashes, and fake hair then servicing you. She is horrible at mixing drinks, and knowing the specials. She needs to get fired!"}
