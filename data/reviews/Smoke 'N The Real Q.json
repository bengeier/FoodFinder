{"text":"Delicious food! We found this place on yelp but we didn't know you had to call your order in. He took my order as I called for directions and got our food done within 10 minutes. The ribs are amazing and the pork sandwich was delicious! We will definitely be ordering from here in the future!"}
{"text":"This place is closed . Wasted a bunch of time to find it. Another business took its place."}
{"text":"Where in the world is this place.  Found Suite 113, but, it was some food services business.  Tried calling , but, answer."}
{"text":"It's tucked back behind an office complex. Not marked. Bad address on the flyer. No answer on the phone number on the flyer.  I had to find he smoker parked around back and then guess what unit it belonged to. While I began asking around, the owner came out and greeted me.    We had some banter back and forth about BBQ. The good thing is he recognizes there are far better BBQ spots in AZ than his. He recognized lil miss BBQ had the best brisket in AZ, but claimed his brisket was a close second.    I tried a sampler plate with ribs, brisket, sausage, and two sides, Baked beans and potato salad.    The Baked beans and potato salad tasted bland as if they came from a super market deli. The beans were spot on with beans from a can that was placed into a smoker to warm hem.   The ribs were way to salty to enjoy.  The membrane was intact and the ribsseemed to be under cooked. The sausage I tried was actually a hot link. The hot link was tough because it had been out and sitting for a while. The hot link was obviously store bought. Finally, the brisket. Sadly, disgusting. The same salty seasoning/rub used on the ribs was on the brisket. The brisket had no rendering. It was sliced paper thin and still very tough.   Sadly the best thing on the plate was the hot link, which was basically a farmer John hot link from the grocery store.  It's too bad. I was hoping for good BBQ close."}
{"text":"Just came back from this place. Fantastic food. I ordered the #6 Combo plate, it comes with 2 meats and 2 sides for 9.50. I chose 2 hot links and Mac and cheese and their Collard greens. The hot links had the perfect amount of spice and had that signature snap. Wonderfully juicy that paired well with their delicious collard greens. The Mac and cheese hit the right notes to cool down those links. Perfect meal. Perfect Q. The only complaint I have is they are open at the time of this writing only on Thursday, Friday and Saturday. They are brand new so I bet they will expand their hours especially with food like that. Thanks Smoke 'N the Real Q!"}
{"text":"I highly recommend the food. We wanted to try the bbq here because we are looking for good bbq place to cater a dinner we are planning. We loved the food. We sampled his rib tips. We tasted it without any sauce. Whoa, the best smoked flavor ever! We then ordered some to go. Tips along with ribs, brisket, and hot links.  Had also tried mac n cheese, beans and potato salad for sides. It was all so yummy. We tried the regular and spicy sauce too. My husband likes the regular, but I prefer the spicy. Looks like we found a caterer and a great place for bbq take out."}
{"text":"I had my daughters baby showered catered by Smoke N the Q. The food was on time... the customer service was excellent. All of my guests loved the smoked ribs, chicken, pork tenderloin, and the hot links... it was all excellent! The owner makes his own BBQ sauce...  hot and mild both sauces were really good. I would definitely recommend Smoke N the Q to the worst critics and they would love it!"}
{"text":"Great customer service along with great food!!! Felt like I was a lot closer to home with this place! This is literally the BEST BBQ I've had since being in Phoenix! Instantly became a favorite!"}
