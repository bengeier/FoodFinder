{"text":"This is some terrible pizza.  The cheese tastes like sewer, and the crust tastes like cardboard."}
{"text":"Best NY style pizza around. Sandwiches aren't anything to write home about, but then again... it's a pizza place. Garlic knots are good and the \"white\" pizza is the best. Add any toppings you want by the slice."}
{"text":"If you order a whole Sicilian, and wait the 30 minutes it takes for it to be baked before you leave to pick it up...I feel like it should be pretty much ready when you get there, instead....when you arrive, they've clearly forgotten and the pizza hasn't even been started yet.  Empty restaurant. Not busy, mid Saturday afternoon.  Then when you go to eat this pizza, it's still raw dough in the middle because they tried to hurry it along.  The Northway mall Mama Lucias was the only one that was ever worth it.   Think I'll stick to Cencis in Wexford. Better pizza, better customer service."}
{"text":"This place is a staple for the boys when mom is out of town. The Sicilian crust is great, especially right out of the oven. It's not fancy, but it's worth the trip."}
{"text":"I've been eyeballing this place for a couple months, thinking it might be the same Mama Lucia's of downtown Pittsburgh Wood Street fame. Sadly, not. I should have known the minute I stepped in the door and couldn't find gnocchi on the menu that it wasn't the Mama Lucia's I was looking for (I have since learned I needed to go a few more miles toward town where the REAL ML is tucked at the back of Northway Mall).  I didn't really see anything else on the menu that interested me and left.   WHY OH WHY didn't I keep on walking?!?!?   I went back in and asked if I could just have a couple meatballs and a salad. Sure. No problem. I added a couple garlic knots to my order.   The salad was nothing more than broken up iceberg, a few (not good) croutons and one anemic tomato wedge with a couple onion slivers. With end-of-summer tomatoes still available, a hothouse sliver of mealiness is just lame. The dressing (Italian) was 90% oil and 100% tasteless.  The meatballs were swimming in a very acidic sauce. The sauce wasn't much more than pureed canned tomatoes. No seasoning was detectable. The meatballs themselves were a step above the Costco/Sam's Club frozen crap. They weren't quite as rubbery but less rubbery does not make for a good meatball. I wouldn't bet on them being manufactured but there had to be an extra \"let's freeze these suckers\" in their life cycle.  The garlic knots were the worst. I think they are baked and then baked again. They put the ubbery in rubbery. Maybe chubbery is a better description - uber chewy and rubbery all at the same time. And totally bathed in big chunks of garlic. Too much garlic. Rule of thumb - if you're eating garlic, but your mouth doesn't know if you ate garlic or a poblano, it's too much garlic!! I brushed off all the garlic, peeled off the burnt top and tried another bite. Still inedible, but not as firey.  So here's the summary: Salad...naked...edible Salad...dressed...inedible unless you like oily flavorless iceberg Sauce...the worst I've ever had but slightly better than tomatoes straight from the can Meatballs...inedible Garlic knots...inedible  The ordering/serving arrangement is a little weird. I didn't know whether it was \"sit and order\" or \"order and sit.\" It seemed like the people ahead of me were doing the \"order and sit\" so I followed suit (I am a lemming). When I was handed my salad, I was told I could sit and they would bring the rest so hey! It's both! So weird. To take it one more step into weirdness, when the waitress (?) brought the meatballs, I asked if I could have parmesan. Her reply: \"It's up at the counter.\"   I was kind of surprised at the total. Nearly $9 for a nondescript salad, two small-to-medium size meatballs and  three garlic knots (just water to drink).   As others have said, there's a tip jar at the register. Give me a break. I hate someone thinking because they've gone to the enormous effort of taking my order and my cash that I should tip them. Hey owners - pay your employees. Please! Hey employees - unless you are coming to a table to take an order and then deliver the food and check back to refill drinks, get additional whatevers and ask for a dessert order, don't expect a tip!  The one redeeming factor with this visit - Pierogies is a couple doors down. Not flawless, but it got the bad taste out of my mouth."}
{"text":"My wife was born in NYC and we met in NJ so we have some pizza experience.  Pittsburghers may not fully recognize the classic Neopolitan style pizza in Pittsburgh is generally inferior to their counterpart pizza  in the East.   However, this is the closest to New York style we have found in Pittsburgh.  So if you want \"real\" pizza in Pittsburgh this is the place!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure what all of the bad reviews are about; Mama Lucia's is a great choice for inexpensive, delicious food. I've only ever had pizza here in the three times I've been because it was very good. Others I've brought along would contend, and some also enjoyed the garlic knots.  While some people are irritated by picking up your own order and taking it to a table yourself, I thought that for a slice of pizza in a casual environment, it makes more sense. This is somewhere I go for convenience- not for a long, expensive meal with several courses."}
{"text":"We always get the Small Sicilian which is a six cut thick crust pizza.  The sauce is very good and tangy.  It does take thirty minutes to bake, but we factor that in when we order.  Pepperoni is tasty, but we wished they put more than three pieces on each cut.  We were customers at Northway Mall and followed them to Perry Highway.  They have a loyalty card which helps defray the cost a little.  Great pizza, but smile guys!"}
{"text":"Was here about a week ago. I liked the fact that you can order slices - not always a sure thing in this area. I had a slice of white pizza and a mushroom slice. This is the closest to New York City thin crust pizza you are likely to find in this area. Just delicious! Now I'm thinking of getting a half baked to-go sometime to finish at home. The only slight knock - they need to engage with their customers a little more. They were nice guys, just a little distant. But it won't stop me from returning!"}
{"text":"Worst Sicilian in all of Pittsburgh. Our whole Experience was Horrible! Idiots running counter did not know the computer nor give us cups, plates etc. Pepsi products  sold here SUCK! news flash, Coke is the worlds #1 beverage! There is no booths, just tables. no carpet, just stone floor to add to the noisy and drafty wait. Lousy decorated and no real aromas of pizza/Italian etc., Idiot brings our appetizers and no cups ,plates,utensils!50 minutes later, pizza comes and still no cups, plates, utensils! we had to ask for everything. We were given plastic utensils to eat  when others had real silverware. Pizza not fully cooked in center and can mushrooms would've been fine, except some genius at the establishment has put  what we believe to be garlic salt on the mushrooms and a nasty after taste follows. Usually anywhere for pizza, we take leftovers. Today the leftovers went in the garbage along with the crappy zucchini planks and watered down marinara sauce. not even worthy of feeding the wildlife! Pizza Hut does it better. Some Suggestions, Replace the idiots you have working the counter, get real soda aka COKE products, put some booths and carpet in. Some music instead of two ceiling flat screen TV's with stupid programs on!"}
{"text":"We ordered a simple Sicilian pizza with pepperoni and onion. The crust was good, but the onions looked like they were cooked a week ago. I don't think I will be back to this place."}
{"text":"This pizza place is very close to work and conveniently located right off of 19 in Wexford!  Had to make a quick stop before a doctors appt.  I had 2 slices of pizza with a drink and it was $8.50$.  Reasonably priced for this area, however the pizza was VERY greasy!  I used about 10 napkins to get most of the puddles of grease off the pizza!  The workers seem less than thrilled to work there - if you are the face of you store and have to communicate with people you should probably like talking to others!  Not one of my favorite places but they do have other food options!"}
{"text":"They don t use gloves. Gross   Their fingers cross contaminate all toppings .  I'm going to Taco Bell, they use gloves"}
{"text":"This is the best pizza this side of Brooklyn! Well in the north hills anyway. Having grown up in Queens & Brooklyn I know great NY thin crust pizza when I taste it. The Sicilian (square) pizza is also terrific.   When you get toppings they are plentiful, cut well and taste great.   We have ordered take out here plenty of times and ate in here too. They have a large dining area with plenty of seating. Granted the tables could be wiped down better but no big deal.   My only minor criticism is the staff always seems cold and not very friendly, but maybe it's an authentic NY attitude served with the NY style pizza."}
{"text":"When you're nestled in between great pizza places like the Oven and Cencis you need to try harder. We've been wanting to try this place out for a while now. We weren't missing much.   The fried mushrooms were ok, but the marinara sauce was runny and added nothing to the appetizer.   My wife, the pizza lover, said that the crust of her cheese pizza was nice and thin and crispy but the sauce tasted funky. She said she would not get it again.   I ordered a steak calzone. I love calzones. Not this one. Good thing I love mushrooms, because there was barely any steak but a lot of mushrooms. It was a great size, but I prefer quality over quantity and would not get it again. The marinara sauce looked more promising this time but it fell short as well.   For $35 there are a number of places that we'd rather give our money to; you should do the same."}
{"text":"As I've said many times before, my wife and I are Pizza Snobs. We try every pizza we can find and believe me, we've tried a lot. The crust is tough but has a little crisp, while the sauce is so sparse that you barely notice it. The biggest thing we noticed is that it is extremely salty with little other flavors. I understand that food is all about what you individually like. Some like little sauce while others like a ton of cheese but we found little here to like. There are better places in the area and some spectacular places a little drive from there. We will be going elsewhere."}
{"text":"I ordered 2 slices of buffalo chicken pizza, and a fountain drink, 10 dollars. Price would have been ok if the pizza was good, but it was really thin, and the oil was practically flowing off the pizza. To put the cherry on top, my pizza had a chicken bone embedded into it... Unfortunately I didn't see it before I bit into it. The place itself is nice enough but when your food is subpar..."}
{"text":"Waste of money! The man at the counter was very rude. I asked for a side salad and he rang me up for a full sized salad. The pizza was cold and bland. The cashier was so rude he didn't even say thank you when I paid..., never again I will be sure to spread the word to all of my friends and family. I guess that is why the business was completely empty. Do NOT spend your money here."}
{"text":"For all of you that have written negative reviews, I'm certain you're all overweight and have unrealistic expectations on what a meal that averages $7 should be. This place has been first rate since its opening. The food is all natural which most of you negative lards folks are not accustomed to, and  the staff has an extremely high tolerance for the screaming misbehaved kids that run around with no adult supervision. I'm certain your threats of going somewhere else will not effect the operations here in the least.  For those that want great food at a good price, this is the place. For the yahoos that have nothing better to do than be toxic in public, stay home, order food , and be miserable there so others are not subjected to your presence."}
{"text":"Mama Lucia's has some of the absolute best pizza around this area. Especially the location at Northway Mall (which, to my aching heart, has closed because the landlord jacked the rent). I have tried the cranberry location several times and the recipe is the same...wonderful thin crust, excellent sauce and superb cheese. The naysayers should keep going to pizza hut, papa johns, or any of the other pizza factories that claim to make authentic pizza parlor pizza. This is the real deal...true italian pizza parlor pizza."}
{"text":"Pizza is great.  Service is great.  Stumbled into this place awhile back as we were driving around.  Wide menu for what is a \"pizza\" place.  Service was wonderful.  While the food was good, the place could be cleaned a bit more...."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch and after checking out menu grabbed a college favorite which was the pizza steak grinder. While not an exotic sandwich, I found it to be quite tasty and for seven dollars hard to beat. Would definitely come back to try the Sicilian pizza"}
{"text":"I say Mama Lucia's is a solid 4. We had not been in for a very long time. Whether it is the same place or not as the Mama Lucia's that used to reside at Northway Mall...it is extremely close (if it is not the same). The hubby had been jonzing for some thin crust NY style pizza with some greasy goodness that goes with it and we were hopeful it would be what we remembered. It was and totally hit the spot. It is cheap and good. Although I am not sure why parents think they can let their kids run all over. Just because it is cheap does not mean you can let the kiddies run amuck. We enjoyed a plain large pizza, grease and all. We also really like the garlic knots which were doughy and garlicy and delightful! We will go back for sure!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite pizza in Pittsburgh. I was upset when they left the Northway Mall but I have made the trek up to the Wexford location because there's no better pizza out there. It's Manhattan style but they might have other styles as well. The Wexford location has a large and nice seating area but I have always gotten takeout. It's great pizza!"}
{"text":"Best NY style slice in the north hills.  Period.  Pittsburgh is full of pizza shops with thick, yeasty crusts... not the thin crust pie that you get on the east coast.  I'm not saying Pittsburgh style pizza is bad... but a traditional pie is nice to have."}
