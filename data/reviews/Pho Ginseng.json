{"text":"The food is great but the servers aren't. The place isn't even full but every time i come here i can't get a refill ever!"}
{"text":"A co-worker and I went there for lunch and she ordered one of the dish that contained fish sauce.  She did not like it because of the smell of the fish sauce and asked the waiter to see if she can exchange it for another dish.  The waiter brought the owner and he refused and told her that if he did that for every customer, then he would go out of business.  I was shocked at how unprofessional that was.  The food was okay, but the customer service has got to change."}
{"text":"The food is not the greatest and they really need quality training in customer service! I found hair in my food and when I called to report it for a refund, I was asked how long the hair was! And then I was told I will not be given a full refund...I will not be returning!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here for dinner yesterday evening. We're visiting from Michigan.
 We ordered Pho Bo, garlic chicken, egg rolls, and shrimp and vegetables tempura. Everything was spot on! And the customer service was great. The owner came out and spoke with us. He was very friendly, as well as the wait staff. We will be visiting again before we head back to Michigan. I will recommend this place to anyone who hasn't had pho before or even people who are also visiting.
 If you're looking for a place to eat something full of flavor and that isn't unhealthy, you should give it a try."}
{"text":"okay..so i was pretty harsh on this place on my last review and i felt bad considering they had only been open for a few months.   it has been 5 months since i was last there and i figured it was about time i gave them another try.    i'm happy to say the experience was complete 180. i don't know if they changed ownership, chef or just worked out the kinks but i'm happy.   i ordered the beef pho with pretty much ever meat part(the way i like it).   it was really good and was quite on par with the best pho's in charlotte.   the broth was rich and flavorful.   the meat was nice and tender.   portions were fair.  they were really generous with the noodles.  

i also ordered the pork bun mi to go and  by the time i got out of the shopping center i'd eaten it all.  for any of you sandwich fans, this is a great sandwich especially when it's done right.  and this one was done right.   the french bread was nice and toasted.  the pork was freshly grilled and the pickled veggies were  chilled.   i coudn't stop eating it.   and it's only 5 bucks.  

as for the the service i can't really say.  there were only a few people there and it seemed like only one person was working in the front.   he seemed really nice.   the food was good and it came out in a reasonable amount of time.   that's all i care about.

i'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"OMG the food was so good. i ordered my food to go and asked what the sizes were. he showed me the cup and i was a bit skeptical because the bowls other customers were eating was big. when i recieved my order, the food was in a tray and the soup was filled to the top in a seperate container. i thought the food and soup came in that \"to go\" container and it wouldnt be that much but the portion size turned out to be VERY VERY filling.  definetly coming bac....DELICIOUS"}
{"text":"Awesome place near the house. Great find. Great food. I will definitely be back to visit. Great staff and very courtious."}
{"text":"Good pho and good value. This place will be a staple. Son had the lemongrass chicken which was good, too.
Only thing is I would not get the Vietnamese coffee again. It was just okay and was a little pricey but hey, we were there for the pho, which is awesome!"}
{"text":"Me and my husband are regulars at this place. We come every week for Pho soup. It is delicious. And i really like that they have size options."}
{"text":"It's like 90 degrees today with humidity it feels like 9000. I'm thinking sure I should eat something cool and refreshing but nah. Had to get my pho on. I step into the joint. Clean. Lots of white people. In my head I'm like dang... This ain't gonna be legit. But it's hot and I'm already here. 

I order my pho. Medium. The waiter doesn't seem to speak great viet. I'm shook. So I test them. I ask for the rare steak on the side. Boom. No problem. I test them some more. I ask for the nuoc beo. That's the secret stuff white people don't know about. Boom. No problem. There's hope Ya'll. 

I get the pho all quick snap. The broth looks clear. My heart sinks. This pho too clean! But then I tasted it. Bruh. I knew I was in trouble. It ain't sweet broth. It's got the right flavor. It's got heart. The heart of Vietnam... But cleaner. So I throw in the good stuff and 8.5 minutes later it's done. I devoured it. It's hot. I'm sweating. No ragrets. 

10/10 would do this again."}
{"text":"Incredible vegetarian menu!  Terrible service and long waits at times! :( But the food is stellar!"}
{"text":"Service is bar none the best. The food is even better

Always order the Pho with strips of beef
(#37)

Amazing food for the price and oh so good!"}
{"text":"Always fresh. Always good. I love this little place for a bowl of pho. They serve it in small, medium and large and the small is just right for me."}
{"text":"Been here multiple times and hooked on the Vermicelli! Have had it with pork, chicken and shrimp.. all are outstanding.  Service has always been quick and friendly.  We like that everything is so fresh, crisp and full of flavor. My daughter introduced us to Vermicelli as I wouldn't have tried it on my own. Check it out but be careful, you will get hooked too. Love mine with hoisin and saracha sauce ;)"}
{"text":"Really good pho! It was delicious, and I enjoyed it very much. I was having a bad day and pho always makes me feel better; it's my comfort food. The waitress no doubt sensed my \"low\" condition and was very kind."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!! It's been very hard for me to find pho this good!! And they give you so many options! 
The service was friendly! I ordered the summer roll as an app and they were delicious! 
I had the chicken pho and asked them to add extra veggies to it. It came out the just was I had ordered it!! The flavors were exactly as pho should be! The fresh basil that comes with the soup surprised me. It was absolutely beautiful! 
Overall, I will be coming back here."}
{"text":"I don't know what happened but last two times I ordered the chicken wings which was marinated in sweet spicy sauce with another chili sauce on the side was the bomb as well as the beef vermicelli bowl, it was perfect and just to die for. Today I came in with one of my family and the service and the food was just ehh. My food came out first before the appetizer and my mom had to wait a while longer for her food to come out - she ended up not eating her bowl of pho 'cause her appetite just dwindled after waiting. We ordered another plate to go when we ordered but our take out food didn't even make it to the kitchen. Also the chicken wing was not what I expected it to be. I ordered it since I have been craving the chicken wings but it came out as fried and soggy. On the menu it says \"marinated\" but this wasn't at all. So I asked the waiter and he said it changes every time so I was really disappointed - waste of my 6 bucks right there. I wish they would hire more servers so that the service is good since I could tell other customers wanted this waiter to notice them but what can you do when he has to take care of 7 tables + takeouts. I used to like this place but after tonight, I don't know, not a big fan anymore. I wouldn't have came here if I knew the food wasn't constant."}
{"text":"We love this place!  Just recently discovered it, but I can see coming here on a weekly basis!
The number 37 is my favorite (the small is quite large) and I also get the spring rolls)
The staff is also very friendly and will give recommendations if you ask.
Everything is very authentic made in house, even their dumplings that always seem frozen and flash fried in other restaurants taste freshly made.
If you're in the area and looking for a place to eat, it's a must, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This place was a really good option to try something different.  Their Pho was some of the best I've had.  Lots of flavor in their food.  Great place for a good lunch or laid back dinner!!"}
{"text":"Love the food and the people. 
The owner is so nice, he will make you feel at home. 
He took his time explaining and answering our menu questions. 
He offered his advice and promise we would not pay for a dime if we are not satisfied. 
However it was SUPERB!
Love it love it love it
Been back 2 more time within 10 days."}
{"text":"Food was really good...still prefer the other Vietnamese restaurants in charlotte ..but happy that we've got a decent one up this way.."}
{"text":"Charging for whatever your reasons are is totally fine! You've gotta make your money! But I was completely unaware of your charges for silverware and then a to go cup. First though charging for the silverware IS silly, there's other ways to charge a customer that won't feel like extortion. Your prices were a little high but reasonable for the nice atmosphere and quality food. I think your food was excellent quality, but for future customer's make them aware that there are those charges involved ( aka silverware maintenance charge + if you want the food you paid for to go) even after asking about the charge and wanting to get it taken off (it's not about the money but about the principle of the charges) because it wasn't mentioned in menu or by server (who was really nice and got a good tip). It was complete no nonsense business and unwillingness to work with a customer that got you this review not your food, atmosphere or employees (see above reply from owner for example)"}
{"text":"I love their cold vermicelli noodle bowls. I've had the chicken and pork and prefer the chicken. The ingredients seemed to be very fresh and I got the extra green onion and mint that I asked for at no extra charge. The fish sauce-based sauce had great flavor (some places it seems a little odd.) I'm taking some of my friends here soon. Hope they like this place as much as I do!

PS The restaurant is really lovely. Must be quite new. Gorgeous laquered wooden tabletops, dark wood chairs with white vinyl seats, long open bar. Feels very spacious for a smallish place."}
{"text":"Americanized? A bit.

I love it.

I need to first make clear that the food is delicious. EVERYTHING was spot on, and exceeded my expectations for Vietnamese food based on my experiences with other such restaurants. 

The menu is English speaker friendly, an important feature most Vietnamese restaurants are unfortunately missing - this is mostly what I mean when I say it is americanized.

The food retains authentic flavor while also making a more comfortable experience for those unaccustomed to Vietnamese food.

Delicious food, great atmosphere, 5/5 would Vermicelli again."}
{"text":"I ordered the traditional beef broth soup with rare beef and beef meatballs. All of the ingredients were fresh and tasty. The website says the soups are available in three sizes. I ordered the small soup as a takeout item. The guy states that he doesn't have small. I point to the menu reiterating that the menu shows three different sizes. The man says that the small is for dine in only. So that means I could only order the medium or large for a take out order. Wasn't planning on spending that much for a bowl of soup and wasn't pleased that the website didn't state small was dine in only. Tricky false marketing. Otherwise I would recommend this joint."}
{"text":"This is a small place but the food is really good. The staff is friendly. 

They have a variety of options on their menu. 

We will be making this a regular for low-key lunch or quick dinner."}
{"text":"The Pho broth has the look and consistency of dirty dish water, but upon first taste, all ills of the world are righted, all sickness is cured, you're taste buds explode and your heart and belly are filled with peace.   \"Mother's Milk\" is the only way I can describe it.. comfort, love, homemadeness, skill, pride, care and tastey goodness.  Gosh, can you tell I like it..lol..  Been here twice, had a combo I created that I vetted with the waiter as to not make too much of pig of myself -- a small Pho (Tai and Tai with meatballs per respective visit) and the grilled pork sandwich (Bahn Mi) --  Yummy to all!    The broth of the Pho I started with as it is the base and heart and soul of the soup.  Noodles, onion,  meats, basil, sprouts, hot peppers and lime (last 3 come on a plate for you to decide amount -- fresh) round out the culinary band.  You can add sirachi for spice or hoisin for sweet. but I do not like to taint the broth.   The Bahn Mi is fresh crisp veg and super tender marinated pork on a fresh french roll.  Crunchy, meaty, sweet, and bready.. perfect in my Vietnamese inspired soup and sandwich combo.    Staff is cordial, warm, efficient and dedicated.  Like the broth, they are the base of what makes Pho Ginseng a true gem.  Look forward to my next visit!"}
{"text":"Today is first visit to Pho Ginseng.  I have been waiting for amother Vietnamese restaurant that was closer to home.  The restaurant is noce and bright...and in a good location in Rosedale shopping center.  Today...i am trying Vermicelli with grilled chicken.  It comes with the traditional items...and an evg roll.  Looks yummy!  Will have tio try the pho chicken at next cisit.  The restaurant plays nice music...and the service ic very nice"}
{"text":"I am so confused by the bad reviews. We got the Pho Tai and it was FULL of flavor!! So incredibly yummy!!

Spring rolls were fresh and tasty. And I got the #24 which is vermicelli and pork...added a little sriracha and hoisin sauce...wow. So good. The flavor of the pork was the best viet food I've ever had. 

Service was lovely and friendly. 

WE WILL BE BACK AGAIN AND AGAIN. :)"}
{"text":"Won't be back, but if last evening is any indication of how the place is run I can't believe they'll be in business very long anyway.  Visited 12-7 for dinner.   We should have followed the lead of another party that came in before us.  They left after getting spring rolls and apparently the rest of their order either never came out or was all wrong.  That was the only other party in the dining room when we arrived.  

We waited 5-10 minutes for someone to come take our orders, meanwhile watching the waitress Ping-Pong her way through the restaurant with a water pitcher. Finally another server got our orders.  The three of us ordered spring rolls and egg rolls as appetizers plus three entrees. The spring rolls came out the same time as my pho,  which came out a good 15 minutes before any of the other entrees.     

The #30,  a soup that was supposed to be rice noodles and won-ton,  chicken and beef had ramen noodles (from a pack that was still basically solid in the bowl) plus shrimp and about a ton of cilantro.  When my daughter told the server that wasn't what she ordered the waiter took the bowl back and had a discussion with the kitchen, then came back and said #30 on the menu was just a test item and what they put before her was really what was in a # 30.  Seriously?  Since it had now been 30 minutes since we ordered,  and we figured the chances of getting something else any time soon was not likely,  she kept it and ended up eating only about half of it. 

So,  two down one to go... After another 5 or so minutes,  they brought my husband's dish.   This was a rice dish that was supposed to have a pork chop plus some other proteins plus sunny side up eggs.  The pork, eggs and rice were fine  but nothing else on the plate was a) recognizable b) edible.  This from a guy who eats pretty much anything you put in front of him.   Plus,  we watched the plate make its way around the restaurant two or three times before making it to us.

Finally the egg rolls came out another 5-10 minutes after the last entrée.  There was apparently a bigger party in another part of the restaurant,  and they must have had issues since they kept coming out to ask for service as well.  

Two other parties started to come in and the servers told them they were closed. It was about 7:30 by this time, supposed to be open til 9:30 but at least they had the good sense to know they were in the middle of a train wreck and not take on any more customers."}
{"text":"Good Pho! Soup is not consistent day to day. Some days the flavors are amazing and fully developed. Other days it tastes too salty.  Definitely worth a try, but if you get a bad experience, go back because it could have just been a bad day. ?"}
{"text":"First of all I want to start this review by stating that this is our second time here. The first time we came was shortly after this place opened. The service was slow and unorganized. The noodle soup came out cold. What?  The owner was too busy defending himself after being yelled at by an upset customer because of the food. 

Now let's skip to our second time.  

I have worked in the restaurant business for over thirty years and owned several restaurants. With an understanding that some businesses takes time to adjust to customers service and operation we were willing to give them another try. 
As we came in we were handed menus and told to sit ourselves. We waited 10 mins with no greetings or acknowledgements while others who came in after got their orders taken and drinks served. The server came to clean the table next to us and didn't even look over. The owner came and spoke to the table next to us and look over to our table and didn't say a word. They only had four or five tables including us. 

We decided to leave. As we were walking out the server asked \"are you guys leaving?\"  WTH do you think bud?  Obviously you were too busy for us or you don't want our business or you don't like  Asian customers. I would give this place a zero star if I could."}
{"text":"We tried the beef pho. They are not too bad.... not the best we have ever eaten, but they are okay. The server is nice. We wanted to try the stir fry noodle, but they only serve it at dinner. We will probably will visit again to try different dishes."}
{"text":"I really love the pho here. Tried others and this place is the best. Great food- great service. I hope this place makes it, every other restaurant in this spot never lasted. Go try it out!"}
{"text":"Decided to stop here around 2:00 on a Sunday for lunch. The service was among the worst I've ever received, downright shameful. The one server that was on clearly hated his job, life, etc and barely spoke a word avoiding eye contact at all times. It took FOREVER for him to take our order. It took FOREVER to get our food. I would like to note that at least twice during our wait for the food kitchen employees were outside smoking, no wonder food took so long! He did not come back once to check on us, if he had I would have sent back the Pho which was the worst I've ever had and I've had Pho everywhere. Bland flavorless broth, stringy cheap meat. The quail egg was FULLY cooked for Christ's sake! The Bahn Mi sandwich was almost entirely devoid of toppings. A few scraggly pieces of fatty pork, a scattering of veggies, that's it. Horrible. We decided to quickly eat what we could and get the hell out of there. I would never go back or recommend them to anyone."}
{"text":"I've eaten enough Pho to know that the \"rare\" beef should NOT be cooked prior to my picking up my to-go order.  It was inedible by the time I got home.  The beef should be wrapped and raw, period.

Service was not great but I was only picking up so I didn't have to deal with the young girl at the front for too long.  Just smile folks, it goes a long way!

Will give it one more try and update accordingly."}
{"text":"Strong menu with yummy offerings. They're not as generous on portion size for to-go orders as they are in the restaurant -- a \"large\" pho to-go is probably more like a medium if you're dining in. Service is usually fast and friendly, but I get the sense that some of the younger employees are making inappropriate jokes about the customers, to the point that I no longer feel comfortable as a woman going there alone. I'll keep coming back, I'll just send my husband next time."}
{"text":"This was my first time eating Pho - Very good food - we ordered #49 Hu Tieu Mi, # 50 Hoanh Thanh, the Lemongrass Chicken, and the spring rolls. We ordered the oolong tea and sweet green tea.  While the oolong was what you'd expect the water temp was barely warm.  Disappointed.  The #50 was supposed to contain 11 won tons but sadly they ran out before we ordered.  It was substituted for shrimp.  We did arrive about 20 minutes before closing but still, everything should have been available.  We'll give it another try as the flavor of everything was great."}
{"text":"We always get the same thing: chicken fried rice. So good. Always fresh and fast. The Pho is good too."}
{"text":"Oh relax people.. They opened a month ago.. They need time to work out the kinks. They make everything by hand which takes extra time and is so worth it in the long term. Give them another shot or go eat at the other low grade Asian restaurants in the area who all buy from the same supplier. 

Things to try- Pan Fried Dumplings, Number 20, Number 21.. or a Banh Mi sandwich.. a steal at 4 bucks...

I will be back."}
{"text":"Definitely not the worst pho I've eaten but not the best. If you are accustomed to eating pho, this is definitely a place where you will need to \"fix\" your broth with hoisin, siracha and possibly fish sauce (it was a little bland). Prices were ok but a tad on the priced side, large bowl was $13 and while the bowl was huge, I felt as though there was a lot of broth but not much meat. My mom ordered the medium size and the bowls are drastically different in size but she had about the same amount of meat as I did. So the large wasn't worth it to me."}
{"text":"Not that great. It's not very authentic coming from an Asian guy. The food wasn't on par with my worst days of cooking. Wasted money."}
{"text":"Took my daughter who's a regular, we were handed two menus and told to sit anywhere. Two other tables  of 5 or so we're either eating or waiting. We sat , and waited, and waited and waited. We watched one of the three gentleman working there chat on his cell, clearly a personal call, the other wash a bowl for for 20 minutes and the one who sat us ran around in the most inefficient manner it was hard for him to multitask. I would love to comment on the food the drinks or even the service but I can't. No one even looked on our direction for 25 minutes, we made noises , made faces even raised our hand. We got up and left and on my way out I said to one of the gentleman \" hey man, we sat for 25 minutes , you guys really blew it\" I got a smile. Thanks guys for wasting our time."}
{"text":"So my only experience with Vietnamese food is a bahn mi sandwich from le's in a shady strip mall in the no da Charlotte area (Chinese corner). Their sandwiches are to die for!  

Anyway, I was hoping pho ginseng would be a nice addition close to home. Not so much. We got the dumplings which were totally flavorless. The avocado summer rolls which were the same. We got the well done beef and meatball pho and it was fine but nothing special. The meat was really fatty and tough. We got a bahn mi pork sandwich which was average. If I am craving a bahn mi this will just not due and I'll make the trip to le's."}
{"text":"Love love love the authentic food and the atmosphere. By far my favorite pho dishes I have found around and worth it to give it a shot. The one bad or almost terrible thing I could judge is the service we get. Always very nice and welcoming but time management is a huge issue. Not sure the server training was done well because friends and I get our drinks 20 minutes after ordering and other things we ask for much too late. I tip mainly based on service because I too am in the restaurant and serving industry. The servers need to be able to multi task and focus on what customers need. Things would run much smoother if everything was taken care of at the time of the requests."}
{"text":"Great Pho restaurant. Spring rolls were perfect. I ordered the house special Pho. Amazing!!"}
{"text":"Tried to place an order over the phone, but there was no answer. The S.O. decided to place a to-go order in person. The ordering process went well, he had no complaints. The order was ready in under 20 minutes. We ordered:

Spring roll with shrimp only (upcharge)
V8: Tofu Pho
47: Hu Tieu Nam Vang

The S.O. was impressed with their vegetarian options. They have an entire page on their menu dedicated to vegetarian dishes. The previous Vietnamese restaurant we called did not have vegetarian options, not even vegetarian pho. Anyway, the food. The shrimp spring rolls came with a creamy peanut sauce. Delicious. The rolls as well as the contents of our soups contained fresh vegetables and proteins. I try to order a different soup everytime we eat Vietnamese food. I ordered the Hu Tieu Nam Vang and did not know what to expect. What I received was very similar to pho. The soup had a light, mild base. Flavor was also similar to pho. I only noticed a slight difference in flavor. I felt the need to use my S.O.'s pho \"mixers,\" hoisin sauce and sriracha for added flavor. Not too wowed. I was however, pleased with the vegetable, noodle, and protein ratios. Good portions. When asked how his pho was, the SO responded with, \"good!\" He is not afraid to speak up if his food sucks, so it must have been good. I meant to try his broth, but got distracted with mine.

Prices are reasonable. I wouldn't mind ordering from here again. I'll try something else next time. I'm sure the SO will order from their vegetarian menu again soon."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times and service hasn't improved much. Yes, they are a new business but that doesn't mean they should be pardoned by lack of service and food knowledge. Like most restaurants, they should've done a run through go over the kinks prior to opening. The workers are nice but not very knowledgeable when it comes to their menu. They keep having to go back to the kitchen to ask if they have certain things or if they offer substitutions. There is NO pho veggie option on their menu. You will have to ask. First time I ordered it they just gave me the broth with noodles, onions and cilantro. I had to ask where the other vegetables were and specify which ones I wanted in there. W.T.H.?? The second time it was a completely different dish. AND they charge the same amount of $ what their regular meat pho is when other places charge a dollar or two less. My mother in-law ordered their seafood soup and there was no shrimp. She asked where it was and they were confused so she had to show them the menu stating there is suppose to be shrimp. 
They also keep the facility very cold. It's a shame, I really was having high hopes for a great pho restaurant to open in Huntersville."}
{"text":"I live in Huntersville and was very excited to see this place open. I have eaten here 8 times and the food (especially the vermicelli #24 ) is consistently delicious.  They opened about a month ago and they have fixed the service problems that they had in the first few days. Great place to eat Vietnamese. I am happy to be on their list of regulars!"}
{"text":"Had dinner here last night and tho I was discouraged because of the reviews I still decided to try it out for myself. frankly didn't know what to eat whilst looking at the menu, there was only one server working during the dinner shift yet he was attentive and recommended me the #24. A interesting noodle salad dish with grilled pork on in it. It was a very fresh and interesting dish, tho the server coached me on what sauces to put in it. Without a doubt I will be returning to try the other items on the menu in the near future!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here twice, and love the Pho. I ordered the brisket and meatball both times. 

Last night we ordered two soups to go, one had the rare and brisket while I ordered the Brisket and Meatball again. When we looked at the meat, they accidentally gave us both rare meat when it was supposed to only be one. So I called the place to see if they can correct the meat for my soup. Drove over there, guy apologizes and wanted to redo my entire soup, but told him, you don't have to redo everything, just the meat, so they don't have to do extra. When the guy handed the cook my food to fix (cook was out front at the time,) the look on his face was pure disgust as if this was my fault and I'm bothering him. I even said something to the other guy, \"He doesn't look happy.\" The guy nervously smiles and said he was tired, been a busy day. Five minutes later, handed me my meat, apologized again and drove home. 

Soup was delicious,but then I noticed I felt bloated immediately. 20 minutes later, my stomach was tearing up. I couldn't leave the bathroom for two hours. It hurt so bad to a point I thought I was going to pass out.

I'm sad that this experience will never make me order food from there again, because the soup usually is great, but I will be staying far away from this place. I do hope no one else experiences the same thing as its not pleasant whatsoever."}
{"text":"I had the lemongrass chicken with fried rice. I did not care for the chicken. But I did like the fried rice. The egg rolls are good. But the summer rolls' wrapping is pretty thick and chewy which I don't care for."}
{"text":"Nice to have this option in Huntersville.   Food is awesome and the green tea iced is great.   Pricing is so so.... on the more expensive side.  Service is above average."}
{"text":"13.73 for a medium soup!!! Go to Joel's or Patisserie cafe for the same it is under $8 for 32oz."}
{"text":"First off, I'd give this place a solid 2.5, but since there's no option for half stars...3 will do. Just because I feel generous. 

Service: okay. When we walked in, a guy behind the counter just stared blankly at us and asked if it was dine-in and handed us menus and told us to sit where ever, so ok cool. It took about 10 minutes before the same guy came to us to approach us and ask for drink orders, and by this time, 2 other tables have sat. He was the only apparent server so I was trying to cut him slack (I work in the restaurant biz), but if you were the one who handed us menus and serve us...10 minutes is a stretch. He let my drink go empty twice, but partially my fault--I was thirsty. Didn't really come by and check if we needed anything, we eventually got what we needed ourselves by reaching onto the server's counter (sorry). There were about 5 tables in there around the time we went (6pm-6:30pm), so it wasn't that busy...service could've been better in my opinion. 

Food and Pricing: I ordered a medium bowl of pho dac biet, probably the most common pho in any pho restaurant. The portion was SMALLER than most pho restaurants I've been to, and more expensive than the other pho restaurants I've been to. It was about 10$ for a medium, and in my opinion, was NOT worth it. The broth is more on the bland side, so season well with the condiments. Probably about 6 pieces of meat in there max, so if you like a large portion of meat in your pho, don't eat here. I also ordered an order of spring rolls. They were eh, okay. They're small also compared to other restaurants, and of course, cost a little bit more than other restaurants. 

Overall: It was a whim coming in here, I probably won't be back because I live in Charlotte and was just in the area. If I was from the area, I'd probably try somewhere else also. The portion of the food just didn't match the price, you can find better pho elsewhere. Even if that means driving a little further. The service wasn't spectacular either to make up for the food. Pretty much to sum it up, mediocre. I'd recommend eating elsewhere!"}
{"text":"Ok I'm FAR from a Pho expert. The main reason I go to this spot is because they have a dish that's a perfect post-workout meal for me. Don't ask me the name of the dish because I don't know it but it's an entree with a pork chop, fried egg, steamed rice and a salad. Call me crazy but I really like it. It's always fresh, made to order. Great portion size. My gym buddy (who is Vietnamese) and I go there often after we workout. Now SHE is more of an expert on this type of cuisine and she said it's pretty legit. Now....one of the key reasons I like this place is the staff. They are awesome and treat me well every single time I go there. And frankly I'd rather go to a casual spot with sweet service than a 5 star place with uptight servers any day!! I love a good experience and this place is just downright comfortable. All that being said, everyone's entitled to their opinion. I see a lot of bad reviews for this place on here, but if you haven't tried this restaurant yet, don't let the negativity stop you from taking the plunge. You can decide for yourself. As for me, I will continue to go to support this restaurant. The only thing that would make it even better for me would be a bar. They don't have any alcohol but that's okay. I still like it and I'm happy to have them in this area!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is soooo yummy! I love the pho here - such flavorful beef broth, fresh ingredients. The spring rolls & summer rolls are out of this world, and the egg rolls are delicious. I crave the food from here and have become a regular. Delicious & well-priced!"}
{"text":"I love this place. He food is delicious and authentic. I introduced my fiancé to pho and he loved it! They have a lot to choose from on the menu and if you have questions, just ask and they will help you pick something out. The staff is very friendly and accommodating. The prices are great for the amount of food bag you receive."}
{"text":"Decent food but they really try and kill you on adding items to your meal.  Two dollars for one egg added to my vermicelli noodles? An additional charge for bean sprouts and a sprig of basil?  \" NO THANKS\"!!"}
{"text":"Came in a little after nine (they close at 930) and the pho and bunh were quite yummy. Solid 4 stars."}
{"text":"The rudest restaurant I ever experienced in the US. The young lady cashier refused to let me sit down on the table. She let two people who came after me to sit down so she could make more money."}
{"text":"The food there is good, but service sucks! They are way under staff. There is always only 1 person in the front. That person is the cashier, waiter and the to go order personal. It's OK to be able to multi-task, but not when you have people sitting at the tables for a while waiting to order, drinks are low (basically just all ice), the phone ringing, people at the counter waiting to pay for their to go order and so on. It's better to be over staff than under staff."}
{"text":"This place is off the hook amazing. We have yet to try a dish we don't thoroughly enjoy."}
{"text":"Please don't go, ordered a spring roll today, it was ham lunch meat inside of the spring roll. Seriously a slice of ham, probably from HT!"}
{"text":"Hands down, the best Pho in the area. My SO and I get a large Pho each to go at least once a week. Staff are amazing, restaurant is clean, prices are great. Love it!"}
{"text":"Funny how all the Americans are giving it 5 stars and we, the Asians are giving it below average. The pho was under cooked. The soup was flavorless. Have to say it might be my worst experience with pho in Charlotte.

P.S. They have NO bubble tea!!!!!!!! How dare you!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome Pho dishes served with  fresh herbs on the side. We tried the Pho  with beef and Pho with Shrimp- both arrived quickly, hot and delicious. Another great dish was the golden rice with chicken. If you are a Pho fan, try this place. You're going to love it and add to your favorites."}
{"text":"We have eaten here several times and gotten take out quite a bit.  My kids love the Pho.  Unfortunately today while dining in the restaurant I found a long black hair in my food.  They insisted that it had to be from me or my friend since all of the cooks have short hair.  My friend  is a blond whose hair was pulled back and I have short post chemo curly hair.  No way a long black hair came from one of us.  Maybe they should look at the female server with the asymmetrical bob!  Mental note - check the sanitation score."}
{"text":"Whenever I'm in the area, I always stop and get my pho shrimp , add crispy tofu. Always yummy"}
{"text":"My favorite is the #44 Spicy Filet Mignon Satay Pho. Got a medium bowl for takeout tonight. 
To drink when dining in, I'll order the sweet green tea. Service is great, except when they get busy. But they are very helpful with your order and any customizations you may have."}
{"text":"It was a cold day and I was craving Pho in more ways that one.  Pho Ginseng was close by so we went right over.  Overall everything was good.  

We started off with the dumplings and they had really good flavor.  They were cooked just right and was a good portion.  Then onto the main event PHO!!!!!!!  I had the Tai Pho (rare beef) and my wife had the Tai Bo Vien Pho (rare and meatball).  The flavor for both Pho's were done well.  They have the different spices / sauces / other condiments that you can add in depending on your taste.  We had the medium bowls that were just the right portion.  You can also add more for an extra charge (we didn't).  Really enjoyed the Pho and the dumplings.  

I had read in previous reviews that the service was a little off sometimes so was prepared.  Experienced some of that when we walked in but things got better during the meal.  Its not a deal breaker for me, but something that you need to be aware of.  Atmosphere is pretty basic, but I don't need to be transported into another world, just like a good product.  They definitely deliver on that.  Service could be improved (just how some of the employees interact with customers).  

Go and support.  I will be back."}
{"text":"This restaurant is delicious!! Absolutely love their spicy broth! It is unlike anything I have ever had. Friendly staff && very clean!"}
{"text":"Spring roll 1 star due to it being so small and not packed full. 
Pork sandwich 2 star the bread was too soft, not firm like the other places that I like. The pork did not have a lot of flavor. 
Chicken and rice 1 star very bland and overpriced for what you get 
I would say the one thing I liked was the onion omelet. 
Inside is super small!!!! I don't like when you are at the checkout counter the cook will bring out someone food and sit it on the counter. That's gross. While I was there I watched them sit 3 Pho soups on the counter and then a few minutes later they brought it out to the people. No one should be breathing overtop someone's food. 
First and last time guest.  Over priced. There are other good quality Pho places in the area and less expensive."}
{"text":"Had a good experience here. The food was yummy, the staff was friendly and it was pretty clean."}
{"text":"I love this place because  of  its  authenticity and  great  food.  Definitely  a  hidden gem and worth a try for anybody.  Also fairly  priced."}
{"text":"Pho Ginseng is my local stop for Pho. They offer a variety of Pho including chicken, beef, tofu, and shrimp. Although this is the closet Vietnamese restaurant to my home, this is not my go to. The service is extremely slow for dine-in and take-out orders. The flavor of their broth is inconsistent and they are a lot more expensive than similar restaurants with constantly better food. I really wanted to love this spot but my encounters with them have prevented me from doing so."}
{"text":"Pho Ginsing opened a few years ago, when I worked in the area and i often went there at lunch.

I found myself in the area earlier this week and couldn't resist the opportunity to return.  Food quality and freshness was as good as I remembered.  The menu was considerably expanded too, with more traditional offerings.

Service remains excellent and value very good.  Staff have always been accomodating.

Atmosphere is good, but not particularly inspiring.

If you enjoy Vietnamese cuisine, or willing to try something a bit different, this place is well worth your time.  I look forward to my next opportunity to visit."}
{"text":"Great Vietnamese food. Honestly, they have the best grilled dishes so far out of all the Vietnamese restaurant in Charlotte and Huntersville, even better than Raleigh. They make everything fresh whenever customers order, which is make sense why food come out a little late. But hey, if you want it fresh then it worth the wait. Only one little problem is that they are always short of staffs. But overall, great food, very comfortable to dine in, great staffs, will bring more friends and help their business keep going."}
{"text":"The service is a bit slowwwww - there are 3 different bowls size to choose from and the price for drinks is ridiculous. I had brisket steak Pho soup it was all right wish there is more meat in my bowl. Will I come back here again - no I'll want to explore more Vietnamese restaurants around the city."}
{"text":"This was my first time eating Vietnamese food. It was tasty and I'm glad I got to try it but I wouldn't be in a hurry to go back here. The service was friendly but it was really slow. I had to cut the guy some slack though because he seemed to be the only waiter on the floor at the moment."}
{"text":"Excellent pho. Timing and wait staff issues other reviews mentioned seem to be ironed out."}
{"text":"I love this place. Friendly staff and great tasting Pho dishes I wish they delivered!"}
{"text":"I went here with my friend ,had the shrimp spring roll which is so fresh and flavorful , was excited about having pho, will be back"}
{"text":"Based on management's poor, unprofessional, & rude response to my initial yelp review (which clearly indicated that folks should try the Pho), I would not recommend this restaurant... Please read..."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite Vietnamese places. The spring rolls are addictive and the chicken Pho is something I constantly find myself craving. Make sure you ask for the spicy chili sauce. A little goes a long way, but I'd recommend giving it a try."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite restaurant, I am not that familiar with Vietnamese food but the staff steered me in the right direction. I love the salad with noodles, # 24 and # 25. I tried a traditional Pho dish with beef and that was great also. I look forward to trying other dishes and learning more about the foods. If your a novice like me just ask for recommendations."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Pho Ginseng and was really looking forward to it as I've had many friends tell me how incredibly good the food is. However, I was very disappointed in the service! We waited for over 30 min from the time we placed our order to the time all of the dishes came out. Time between 1st dish put on the table to last was 8 minutes. 
The food is good, but you may want to call in your order before arriving."}
{"text":"Awesome Pho!!!  Yummy Bahn Mi!!!! Highly recommend them, brought several children here for the first time, and they loved it!!  Staff is wonderful and runs around getting everything. Tons of carry out orders!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic and authentic Vietnamese food. I have loved everything I've tried here. My new favorite is the Spicy Filet Minion Satay. The prices are very reasonable and the staff is extremely friendly. Give it a try. You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"YES!! Finally a Pho place near my house!! I LOVE this place! The food is authentic and the service is perfect. The Thai Tea is yummy yummy! My favorite dish I've tried so far is the 'bird nest crispy noodles'. If you like pho, you've got to try this place! You will love it too!"}
{"text":"First time here and we really enjoyed it!! We ordered the fresh roll appetizer. They was super fresh and the peanut sauced served with them worked well! I had the grilled chicken broken rice. It was very tasty and flavorful! The fish sauce has a great flavor!! My husband had the grilled pork vermicelli dish (bùn) and he loved it!!!! The spring rolls in it were fantastic, the pork was flavorful and the basil and mint were super fresh!! The flavors worked well and was delicious! The service was kind, friendly, and attentive. We really enjoyed lunch and will be back!"}
{"text":"Hard to find authentic pho in this area , we were ecstatic when we found this place ! Very authentic and very very good tasting food!! Excellent customer service , good prices and very clean facility."}
{"text":"Im giving this a 2 1/2. This is not your typical Vietnamese pho place. No fish tank no TV playing Vietnamese channel and the service was not that good. I was there for a total of 40 minutes and didnt get a refill on my water the guy didn't even come and ask me how the food was. It took them 20 minutes to bring my bowl of Pho out.. 20 freaking minutes, the place only had 6 other people.. the up side was the food was good.."}
{"text":"So, I was on a weekend trip to visit family in North Carolina...I may or may not have had a little too much to drink on the first night. So Pho just seemed like the go to but since I don't know the area I relied on the recommendation of our cousin. He totally HIT THE NAIL ON THE HEAD! This place was incredible. The veggie Pho was so incredibly flavorful and unlike anything I have tried back home. Sweetened Green Tea was delicious and the refills kept coming without me having to ask. Also, unlike most Pho places they had an extensive menu. The kids had shrimp Fried Rice that was pretty amazing. However, the real winner here was the Pho. The Summer (fresh) rolls were also great. If you like Chili Paste they have the REAL homemade stuff. Would I move here? Probably not. But next time I'm in town I'll be having the Pho more than once."}
{"text":"Food was good but service was terrible. 3 people and we all got our food s at different times.  Took over an hour."}
{"text":"Having had great Vietnamese food made for and by a Vietnamese community, I was excited to try this.

Had the sweet and spicy pork dinner. Pork was good... Rice was bland. Overall ok.

Chicken wings... Too sweet and battered. Not at all what I expected.

Wife had the egg rolls which she liked and dumplings which were cooked wrong (overboiled and not fried long enough.)

My sons pork banh mi was lacking in one area... Pork. 2 small pieces.

Nothing horrible, just not worth going back to.

Still looking for a very good Vietnamese restaurant in the area.

Also called in the order and was told 15 minutes... I get there to pick it up in about 10 minutes (traffic was light) and was told it would be ready in 15 minutes... Set appropriate expectations"}
{"text":"Excellent spot. A great variety of well prepared food. Quality and quantity both satisfy and by to bad on the ol coin purse either. It's a standard lunch outing for me. The servers are also pleasant and attentive if a tad understaffed."}
{"text":"We have been here several times. The food is extremely fresh. I always get the Pho when I'm feeling a little under the weather but the Vermicelli is my favorite. Take out is great. Service in the restaurant itself is a bit slower then I would expect but friendly staff."}
{"text":"This is one of my new favorite places to eat.  Who'd a thunk it.  I thought I didn't like rice noodles so I had been staying away from PHO.  Silly me!  I've gone back and tried a lot of things I didn't used to like and have changed my mind about most.  (not Broccoli or Cauliflower tho)  Pho is one of the ones I like now.  I like the rice noodles also.  I even like adding a little fish sauce to the broth.  Only three stars because the menu is under construction and a little small.  Hopefully they will finish building the menu and maybe enlarge it some.  Not sure why that matters, since I order Pho every time.  Although the first time I went I ordered what turned out to be a salad with meet and pork skin and a dressing that I think had fish sauce in it.  I had to ask the waiter, because I though it was supposed to have broth, but he set me straight very gently, altho I'm sure him and he kitchen staff had a good laugh about the large American who didn't take the time to read the description very well.  Oh well, I liked it and if I ever get enough Ph, I'm sure I'll order it again.  Give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Updated July 2016:  After a few initial hiccups, Pho Ginseng has settled in quite nicely.

Their appetizers are the stars here.  We really enjoy the cold spring rolls (shrimp and pork), crispy egg rolls (solo shrimp is an option), and crispy rice with egg (seriously, this is the one to try!). Their rolls are nicely filled, and served with delicious dipping sauces.
 
My husband and I have tried their pho and vermicelli entrees.  For pho, I prefer the seafood noodle soup, and my husband prefers the beef varieties.  Sometimes, the broth is a bit more flavorful on different visits.  But I really like that different sizes are available for various appetites.  

Service has improved since they initially opened.  They are now speedier, and while we still aren't fond of the pop music they stream, we appreciate how efficient they've become.

Their menu has also expanded since opening.  They now have a shrimp vermicelli dish on their menu that is OUTSTANDING.  It rivals Lang Van's vermicelli bowl (seriously).  The shrimp are huge, plentiful, and extremely flavorful.  

Their prices are very reasonable, too.  If you've tried them before and decided not to return, I highly recommend that you give them another try."}
{"text":"A great lunch!  Awesome flavors, the Pho was delicious. Everything was fresh, the spring rolls were tasty with the peanut sauce, it deserves a try by anyone who enjoys Asian flavors. Better than Changs."}
{"text":"Love their pho here!

Came in here yesterday afternoon, after the rain had calm down, and was greeted politely and nicely the minute we walked in. Staffs were super friendly. Our waiter was really nice and made sure we was okay at all times. Love how small and cozy the restaurant is also.

Would definitely recommend this place to people who wants a quick grab/lunch/dinner or so."}
{"text":"I'm upgrading a star from my previous review. We ordered takeout and the quality of the food was much much better. It's not the best Vietnamese food I've ever had, but quick and fresh for a weeknight dinner."}
{"text":"I can tell they are new. But I guess I have an expectation on Pho and more importantly the broth. It left much to be desired. Idk what was missing but when I sipped it, it didn't give me the same feeling inside. Guess I'll be traveling back to the south side for good Pho."}
{"text":"Since this was my first time here, the place was clean. I was the only one in the restaurant after 8pm but the guy taking my order was prompt.  I wasn't sure I wanted pho because it is broth based, I order the chicken lemongrass with fried rice. 

I never had lemongrass before so I understand it can be overpowering. It was not in this case. The fried rice was tasty. It seemed like it had a little lemongrass flavor and what tasted like cilantro.   A good portion for what you pay for.   Good food. I will come back and try more dishes.."}
{"text":"I really like this place and so do others it gets crowded at times.The food is great! Better than in Vietnam mostly because our quality of meat is higher and this place gets it right!! very clean and great decor and atmosphere price is about right I have paid less but not as clean it's in Huntersville everything is more expensive in Huntersville gas, even dollar stores on wait do they have one? But not this place its priced right"}
{"text":"WOW!
I am not a huge Pho guru...but this place was absolutely spectacular compared to the pho I have had in the past!  My husband and I dropped in here for lunch today and we talked the entire way home about how delicious it is! I am seriously so glad I found this place!
Fresh, Clean, Delicious and Authentic!!!"}
{"text":"The food is average at best.  Poor service though, if you're looking for high quality restaurant experience, this isn't the place to go

Restaurant Aesthetics (4 stars) - newer, modern-styled restaurant, green chopsticks and all. There are not that many tables and chairs, but its sufficient. The lighting and ambience is relaxed, not loud or noisy at all. 

Service (1 star)  - The first time I was here, I had a decent waiter. He checked up on our table frequently and we got our drinks and food at in reasonable time. The next time, I came with more people and had a different waiter. He didnt bring enough drinks for everyone and spilled his tray of water at another table. Our party of 8 also got our food at different times, terribly inconvenient. I cut him some slack since he was probably new. However, I came 3 weeks later and had the same waiter. He gave us drinks, then left to the kitchen without giving us menus. I understand that they might be understaffed, but still overall unhappy with the service here.

Food (2 stars) - prices on expensive side. The pho is sub-par, there's supposed to be ginseng in it. Cool, most people probably won't notice the difference. chicken pho includes lettuce and carrots. Nice way to change it up, but I still prefer the traditional taste. portions for the combo rice are also smaller. It tastes alright, but missing a few ingredients. Hu tieu mi and dumplings were decent.

***Update***

Gave it another star because I enjoyed the dumplings and the thai tea. Asked for another water though because I went through the thai tea pretty fast!"}
{"text":"Back to a 4. Cleaner and simpler menu. Very clean. Chicken and vegetables were excellent as always (rice a little dry). The customer service is still debatable, which is why I can't give a 5. 

This time, they said they didn't have any carrots left, which came with my meal. I asked if I could have a cucumber instead. The waiter said, \"You don't want any of these?\" and pointed to everything but the cucumber (likely because the meal that came with the cucumber was $1 more). We were also ignored for the first 10 minutes. Their customer service was better as the meal went along, but they still need help in this department. If you're just looking for good food, recommended."}
{"text":"Super fresh pho. If you have food allergies it's also really easy to eat here. Highly recommend this place if you are a Vietnamese pho lover! The portions are also quite large for the price, and you can choose the size for the soup. I would sit in here for the awesome smells alone."}
{"text":"Wow! We been coming here since they open and today was the worst ever. The server didn't even say one word to me when I walk in. I seat myself and waited 15 minutes later to even get a menu. When I leave no word say at all. Please replace your server or train them how to treat customer. Because this can be a good place to come eat. Food is good enough for this location."}
{"text":"Are you Pho-king kidding me?!?  This was delicious!!! 
This is my second visit, and the pho is fantastic.   I had the #36, with the beef and meatball.  The broth is perfectly aromatic and seasoned just right.  I added a dash of Sriracha to make the heat level just where I wanted it.  
Portions are great!  This time I ordered a small, as the medium would have fed me for several meals.  I am stuffed and could have even made this last for a second meal.
Our server was great, atmosphere is relaxed.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"We have been here four times already. Best Phoa we've had in the Lake Norman area for sure. Friendly staff, good fresh food. Really love the place. We love the fried pork dumplings, taro shrimp and of course, the chicken Phoa. It's rare we find a place that even our rather picky daughter enjoys too. We'll be back many times for sure!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch right after they opened. Cold food, had to ask for utensils. I hope it's better other times off day.  Not impressed."}
{"text":"Excellent service. Excellent chicken pho.The spring rolls were fresh and full of flavor. The peanut sauce was heaven."}
{"text":"This place is a must! I'd been craving authentic Pho (being from southern CA) and settled for a different place the day prior- big mistake. The chicken pho and egg rolls were more than delicious. Everything was very fresh, and totally hit the spot. The service was excellent and the restaurant was very clean. Pho Ginseng will definitely be my 'go-to' spot when visiting family in town."}
{"text":"I am by far an expert on Vietnamese food, but I do know tasty food, and this place serves up tasty.   I've tried the spring rolls - always fresh (the two times I've been here) and the Garlic Chicken. I'm not sure if the garlic chicken is an \"Americanized\" dish, but dang, my taste buds are happy. Once the weather gets cooler, I will be back to try the Pho."}
{"text":"The pho was great and the soup was very tasty. The only reason I gave 4-star (I would go 4.4 but Yelp only do integers) because they don't have enough menus and it took so long for them to cook the pho. We sit there for at least 5 minutes until 1 menu was available and the waiter gave it to us and we gotta share. I know the restaurant was kinda packed when we were there but 25 minutes for 2 bowls of pho was a little bit long. We saw every employee was working very hard but to be honest a clear job allocation would help the situation. Personally speaking, the tile they used on the floor can be very slippery for the waiters especially when they are holding 4 heavy bowls with full noodle soups."}
{"text":"Service was good. Pho broth was bland. Price is above average compared to other Vietnamese restaurants in the area. They have a special vegetarian section on the menu. This joint is a one and done for me."}
