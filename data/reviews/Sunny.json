{"text":"This place is clean and organized, the staff is super friendly and the food is pretty good. I had the smoked salmon with rye toast: deliciously topped with red onion, capers and I had it with sunny side up eggs."}
{"text":"Sunshine Spot....Sunshine Spot was our favourite breakfast spot. The food was great, the service was fast and courteous and we always left with a smile on our faces. It wasn't fancy, it wasn't special, it was just our spot. We got to know one another here and we would  laugh over our eggs and banana pancakes; it was special. Now it is not. It is no longer Sunshine Spot. It is no longer our spot. Now it is Sunny's. Now it has a new menu, new ownership and new staff that are hamstrung by a terrible menu. A terrible menu riddled with spelling mistakes, inconsistencies and disappointment. To describe the disappointment I felt coming here can only be described by a comparison. A comparison to a free man, falling from grace who once dined at the finest places, to be locked away in prison; fed prison food. Enough said? I think so. Don't come here."}
{"text":"Overall very poor experience.... I'm definitely not going back.

I went to Sunny for brunch with my parents last week. The service is friendly, but the food took too long to be ready (even though the place was practically empty).  

The food is ok, but the plates are rather small for the price. The coffee was awful...tasted like something burnt...

On top of everything else, when we got the bill... the waitress verbally gave us a total for our food (no written bill) and brought the machine to pay. My dad was paying for the bill and we were chatting and distracted.... only when my dad was going through his credit card charges (a day or too later) he noticed we were charged 69 dollars for 3 omelettes, 3 coffees and a small fruit side.... as I said... we didn't have a bill broken down by item or person so we didn't have a way to go back and clarify. 

This is definitely not a spot I would go back nor recommend."}
{"text":"The food is absolutely great, extremely fast, very affordable and very honest people in the kitchen. Very good experience !"}
{"text":"You into delicious home fries? Me too. And I can vouch for the A+ quality of the home fries here. So, if you're craving those numbers, like I often do, then if you're in the area, Sunshine Spot is a solid place to check out. 

...aside from that, this brunch spot is mostly a shrug of the shoulders. There is a lot of variety on the menu, but the veggie omelet I ordered was kind of ho-hum. The wait was also so long it was verging on a little ridiculous (but there was just one server).

Environment is just like any other run-of-the-mill brunch spot. Nothing special.

Prices are right, though!"}
{"text":"This was the worst breakfast experience in my life, \"STAY CLEAR OF THIS PLACE \"where did Fran's go"}
{"text":"Was craving a basic club sandwich and fries.  It was really good here... Homemade fries and tasty and sizable portions.  Typical breakfast type environment. Good service and reasonable price!  Try it out!"}
{"text":"Used to come here frequently. 
Something has changed in 2016. Portions are smaller and not near as tasty. Service is slow. Now there is no heat and no cable TV. Suspicious. Last visit was given one slice of toast. Inquired about the oddity and was told that the wrong bread was delivered and it was so thick (it wasn't, it was only ordinary bread) that a single slice was the order but I could have another if I liked. I passed.
So, I don't like my food messed with over a five cent piece of toast. It does speak to judgement though. When something is perhaps borderline unfit for human consumption are they going to err on the side of saving a nickel or quality and health?
I'll stay away until they get their act together."}
{"text":"This is small generic breakfast spot that will satisfy your craving for a delicious and inexpensive meal.

The service has always been quick and friendly and there is a variety of breakfast and lunch items to choose from.

Their waffles were VERY delicious topped with fresh berries, cream and syrup and their BLT was huge, stacked and YUMMY! Tasty home fries as well.

I wouldn't go out of my way to check this spot out but because I live in the area it's definitely my go-to weekend brekky spot."}
{"text":"Decent breakfast option for the area. $7.99 bacon and eggs. Got 5 strips of pretty good (well done) bacon, eggs and toast average, hash browns below average. Coffee $1.75 was average as well, but did like the slightly larger cups. Service was a bit slow but friendly."}
