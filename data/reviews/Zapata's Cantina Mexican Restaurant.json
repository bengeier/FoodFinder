{"text":"They have a 15% student discount here, so that's more of a incentive to eat at this place. Their portions are reasonable for the prices but not as big as Azteca. However, I do prefer this restaurant over Azteca even though Azteca is probably the most popular Mexican place around here. I always get the enchiladas here, and I think it tastes so much better than the Azteca one. I also like that it comes with a salad which Azteca doesn't do. I'm surprised by the low rating at this place, but it seems like it's from the customer service and not the food. However, I've never had a bad experience here."}
{"text":"This place gives you generous portions at a reasonable price.  Tasty food and nice service. Five *****,my highest ratings!!!"}
{"text":"I use to the this place but the management is horrible. I go there often but my last three visit were terrible. 1. I dined in and the waitress brought me a water, as I go to drink it there was a bee inside. I tell her and the manager tried to tell me the bee came through a CLOSED door, which I knew was wrong because the bee was settled inside my drink. He take the drink brings it back to show me the bee again to make more excuses but eventually let me get my beverage for free (margarita). 2. My friend went to pick up some burritos, when she got home I realized they never gave her my food (they put two containers in the bag so she thought it was there) I call they blame her. When I went to pick up my food he had just put it on the table and once again blamed me, I stated you just made the food you never gave it to her. Wasted time and time, no compensation.  3. My last time going!!! I call in my order, when I went in he gave me my food and something told me to check it WASNT CORRECT. I go back in he said no it's all in there as if I was wrong. He didn't listen went back to \"fix\" it and still brought it back wrong. The manager is rude and shouldn't manager a bathroom"}
{"text":"My family visited the restaurant recently. There was a dispute about the bill and the manager was called in at the request of my family. The manager was not only not nice but very unprofessional. We are hard working people. We expect good service because we pay for what we order and also tip accordingly. We have never been treated so disrespectfully. There was not even an offer of, \"I'm sorry for the misunderstanding\".....Attention all managers: Being apologetic in the face of controversy doesn't suggest a weakness. There was not even an attempt to right the wrong. We work hard for our money also and like to be wise in spending as we make decisions to relax and have recreation. My level of disappointment can not be expressed any further than saying.....This was really awful treatment of guests in your restaurant. No words......"}
{"text":"Fist I will say the staff is friendly and the patio has a great view. They have pretty good drink specials. Really the only reason I would ever come here again is to drink on their patio.  The food is quite bland. I mean, the \"salsa\" is like runny marinara with some onions in it. I ordered the veggie burrito with no cheese. The thing was loaded with rice and lettuce, save for a few carrots, peas, and corn here and there. There was no seasoning, or none noticeable. It's wasn't all bad though, at least the ingredients were fresh and not over/under cooked.  As stated, this would be a good place to have a drink on the patio, not so much for lunch, and definitely not for impressing others."}
{"text":"I usually avoid malls at all cost hut in Charlotte, there's no way to not eat at a mall depending on what you're looking for.  The menu was everything delicious.  I ordered the soup alboguins, (sp)  with lime and chorico and huevos and refried beans.  Absolutely delicious, fresh and filling.  It took a few days to finish my leftovers in the hotel, but I was determined not to waste that.  Even cold, it was just as tastey, for me, that is the true test of how good a dish can be, if its gross cold, then you shouldn't have ordered it or cooked it in the first place.  This location is in a university type mall/plaza, hadn't been there in years and not too much has changed.  Everyone enjoyed their meal, I highly reccomend eating here for a bite when ever and where ever you may be in Charlotte.   The service was great, friendly and just smelling the food cooking, just made you want to eat everything."}
{"text":"I have only eaten here once. And will not go back. The food was decent but very sloppy, liked like they threw everything into the Togo box. And they got my order wrong. They were very nice though, but looked as if they had trouble when I payed. Not sure if they had islooksues with their system or if it was just the person. All in all... 3 stars"}
{"text":"Good restaurant but bad service from the waitress named Sandra that drinks on the job, extremely late taking the order, touches your food with her arm and no apology or replacement, talks about you in Spanish not knowing you understand what she is saying. The nice managers can't control her, nor some of the other disrespectful waitresses that have teamed up with this idiot. I will never return and hope you don't have this experience should you decide to go!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is a must try! Authentic Mexican food on the East Coast- who knew?! The food and the margaritas are delicious!  If you're looking for fake, commercial, fast food \"Mexican\"- skip this place. If you're looking for the real deal at a great price with friendly service, you MUST try Zapata's!"}
{"text":"My all time favorite place for a fulfilling meal as a college student. One of the BEST Mexican restaurants I ever ate at and as you can probably tell I always go back. The staff is friendly and great customer service. just 2 times i had to wait in line to be seated but it's worth the wait :) and that also goes to show how busy it can get because it is that good. Great place, cannot recommend this enough!! Oh and the location is amazing as well."}
{"text":"Terrible.  The food is bland and boring.  The service was fast and friendly, but that doesn't make up for the complete disaster of a meal that we were served.  I really can't overemphasize how bland everything was.   Don't go here if you require food that has some kind of flavor."}
{"text":"This place has authentic Mexican cuisine. I came here with my sister who has been talking about the wonderful food here.We tried the vegetarian fajitas and Mexican stir fry. Both were delicious. Their tortila chips were served hot and the salsa was a little different but okay. The servers were courteous and the service was pretty quick. I will visit this place again!"}
{"text":"The food was pretty good, But service was pretty bad. There were two waiters and about 4 tables but we had to wait almost half an hour to get a to go box and the check for some reason ."}
{"text":"Good nice Mexican ambience and food..."}
{"text":"I've eaten here for years.  I used to like it alot.  But over the past year or two, it's been downright mediocure.  Today it bordered on gross.  I ordered a beef quesidilla and thought I was getting steak.  I got some geasy ground beef I asume they use for tacos.  It bore no resemblance to a quesadilla.  It was just a taco with stuff on top. I  would have done better at Monterrey's, or even Taco Hell."}
{"text":"We have been going to Zapatas for over 12 years and have never had a bad experience.  The food is consistent - we get the same thing every time - enchiladas suizas and chicken fajitas. Frozen margaritas are delish! Chips are nicely seasoned and salsa is fabulous. We usually get a bowl of queso too - perfect texture. I'm not sure we've had a bad experience with service here over all these years, always friendly and accommodating. Will be back again this weekend."}
{"text":"Holycrap!! They have the best frickin deluxe burrito ever and that's comin from a burrito finatic and nice people with the best salsa and guacamole and sour cream ever!"}
{"text":"I have stayed at the Hilton many times and thought about trying Zapata's but finally decided tonight was the time to try them as I love Mexican food.  I was surprised to come in on a Thursday night and find so many people in the restaurant, always a good sign.  I ordered a chicken dish over rice with peppers, onions, and mushrooms that was awesome.  I have another trip next week to Charlotte and I will be coming here again as this now my favorite Mexican restaurant in this area."}
{"text":"I have been frequenting Zapata's for years and I love it! My favorite is the street tacos which are always fresh and delicious. I have never been disappointed with my food at Zapata's and I know many people who are patrons as well. It is a really large restaurant so there is always seating available. The service is always great. I can't say enough good things about it. I am a big fan of Mexican food and I have tried a lot, let me tell you this place won't disappoint."}
{"text":"Service and meal were great. Good amount and fairly priced. Personnel friendly and attentive"}
{"text":"Like K.B. said, its pretty standard mexican food.  I thought the salsa before the meal was too watery.  I had the fish tacos.  The fish was fried.  This place is ok if your in the area and hungry.  You won't be thrilled or disappointed."}
{"text":"What a shame. BUYER BEWARE! The food is good,  but the manager leaves alot to be desired.  We ordered the \"special\" Margarita,  he said \"the Fresca\", we said yeah the special.   He brought us what we thought was the special of the day and instead charged is 50% more than it was.   When we politely explained the issue,  he said \"that's what you ordered\".    We explained the issue and he said we didn't have to come back if we didn't want to.   So that's that...   Such a shame that management is so ignorant and has no ability to provide any kind of customer service."}
{"text":"I'm just going to say Fantastic flavors and Fabulous flavors!!!!  We totally walked by this place last night, sort of dismissing it from consideration. Tonight we checked it out and THIS PLACE IS AWESOME! Do NOT pass pass this place by!"}
{"text":"I use to enjoy this place. It only took one bad experience and im done! First off we started with one waitress who quoted a sale price on the drinks we ordered, so we ordered them based on the sale. Placed our order and we got our drinks, we took a few min after we got our drinks to order our food. We waited about 20 min to order and we had to call someone over to take our orders, the original waitress went home i guess.  The new waitress had an attitude and seemed as if we were bothering her. The soup i usually order ,tortilla soup was not the same. We get the check and the drinks are not the price that was quoted by the original waitress. To make a long story short, she refused to honor the price quoted the reason we ordered the drinks in the first place!! Service was horrible!! Will never go back which is sad because i use to love the place."}
{"text":"Based on most previous reviews, we went here thinking it would be pretty good. The large majority of the food (rice, beans, tamal, and enchilada) was bland, even the chile relleno was pretty unappealing. The fajita chimichanga tasted like Chinese food. I smothered everything in salsa and jalapeño cheese dip, which helped, but it should be delicious enough on its own. I've had much better at the same price."}
{"text":"Worst service ever!! Had to wait 10 minutes to even get menus then waited longer to receive food and drinks.   After we got our food we got no services to see if everything was ok.  The girl who charged us still had asked if she can keep the change. I think that's ridiculous, if you didn't bother to check on us..   Food wasn't great as I hoped.   I won't be going back there anymore.."}
{"text":"Excellent staff great authentic Mexican cooking, nice location with a nice view. Recommend highly"}
{"text":"Wanted to like this place, but not even close. Great location since we were at the Hilton. Beautiful table overlooking water. That's where the good stuff ended. 5:00 on a Thursday & not crowded we waited for our drinks for over 10 minutes. They brought salsa but no chips. Ordered Pollo Loco & that wasn't what they delivered. Whatever it was cane out cold & chewy. Service was meh. Would've sent back but nobody ever came to check on us. Definitely skip this joint. Too many other quality places around the Queen City."}
{"text":"After fine tuning my ordering process, zapata's gets upgraded to 4 stars. If you ask for spicy cheese dip, it will come out slightly green (from puréed jalapeños, I think) and delicious! Also the green salsa is better than the others.   Goat cheese stuffed jalapeño peppers wrapped in bacon is the most interesting appetizer I've seen on a Mexican menu in a while. Definitely worth a try.   Vegetarian chimichanga is fried hard and stuffed with various veggies. Enough to split."}
{"text":"Good Mexican food for a fair price. I love the pork carnitas and the guacamole. I think their service is good too and so is the take-out.  There are better Mexican food places in town for creative food but I like this one for consistently delicious carnitas! The drink specials are also good."}
{"text":"This place use to be great to eat at, but it seems to have focused more on the drinking crowd then the food crowd. Food was not as I remembered it a few years ago. I had the beef fajitas and it had way too much seasoning and tasted like cinnamon more that fajita seasoning. It also took a fairly long time to get my food as well. This place has done better and can do better, so I hope they can fix the problems. I will give this restaurant another try in a few months, but for now I would say go for the drinks instead of the food."}
{"text":"This is the second year I use them to Cater our end of year company event. [I've never actually ate at the restaurant]   About the Catering: They were awesome! so professional! they came to our job with everything ready to go, they set up and served all our employees. The food was great and had a lot left over, even though we ordered lunch portions. I also ordered a Flan, which was delish! I would definitely recommend them as caterers."}
{"text":"Very good food. Drinks were to sweet margarita was so sweet. Service was amazing. Great street tacos and spicy salsa. Would return."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Mexican place in Charlotte. Fast service, and Fantastic food!! I highly recommend their white queso, street tacos, and tres leches."}
{"text":"Pork Carnitas and Shrimp cocktail was best I've had in CLT. Fajitas were good, but not great. Server was friendly and always willing to help!"}
{"text":"I used to love this restaurant, it's been years since I've been. My boyfriend and I went last night, and we never plan to go back. We have both been getting sick since shortly after eating there and still are very sick. To start it was very hot in the section we wear sat in, were told it's because it's by the window, but don't see why they wouldn't make accommodations for that. Other ladies behind us were saying how hot it was, and they were both from Mexico,just saying. So we had to ask twice for a salsa, then we ordered ceviche to eat as an appetizer, and that was the worst decision ever. They did not offer it as an appetizer,which makes no sense to me. I still order the $25 item, to receive bland, limeless, saltless and all-around flavorless rubber and onions. Everything was severely overcooked and just plain bad in the ceviche. My main course wasn't much better. Everything was bland, dried out from sitting under a heat lamp, and the chicken looked like it came out of a wrapper. We ended up spending close to $100 altogether including tip, just to spend the next 24 hours in pain. This place has sadly become the worst Mexican food place ever,for me. We wish we had gone to McDonald's for our date night, rather than having gone there."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for over 10 years so should write a review I reckon. I've never had anything here that wasn't good. Also features great priced lunch specials as well as great service and a great environment. After you eat enjoy a nice walk around the lake and feed the geese."}
{"text":"Terrible, none of the owners or the cooks have been near Mexico or real Mexican food. avoid if you can."}
{"text":"My new coworkers invited me to go get \"cheap mexican\" with them for lunch. Now, from where I work, you could walk to more skeevy, run down looking, hole in the wall mexican joints than you can count on a hand, and I'm pretty sure at least a few of them would be absolutely delicious (as hole in the wall restaurants tend to be). Unfortunately, I can not report on any of them, because we drove by them and went to Zapatas.  I won't say that Zapata's was bad, partially because i don't think it is deserved and partially because it feels like I am giving credit for more effort than they earned. While the salsa that came with our gratis basket of chips was full of cilantro and onion flavor, that was the high point of the meal. We ate off the lunch menu, and I went with the enchilada and taco plate. The meat in both was slightly greasy and not particularly flavorful. The taco shell tasted like it was pulled out of the grocery store box on my pantry shelf. The rice was bland and slightly overcooked. I do have to give them credit for the enchilada sauce being kinda tasty, but nothing I wouldn't expect from a jarred sauce. The low point was definitely the refried beans, which are often my favorite part. I took one mouthful, found them utterly disgusting and left the rest of them on my plate to form a sad, cold congealed mess.  I have often thought that quality service can redeem an otherwise forgettable meal, well in that case creepy, unpleasant service can cement a bad impression. Despite our party of three being one of less than a handful of patrons in his section, our waiter was slow to get to our table even after being called over. He gave off a used car salesman type of aura and loses additional point for trying to talk me into drinking tequila on my lunch break.  The only reason I can imagine returning to Zapata's would be at my coworkers request, and even then I might think about sticking with the tuna sandwich I brought from home. Oh, and as for that \"cheap\" bit. The lunch pricing is in the 6-10 dollar range, which isn't particularly remarkable when there are tacos to be found for under 2 bucks."}
{"text":"My very first review could only be that of Zapatas Cantina, or \"Zaps\" as I like to refer to it as.  I frequent this dining establishment more than any other in my life. Very much at the pinnacle of decent restaurants located in the university vicinity of Charlotte, it has all the ingredients: the food is of upper-end quality, it's modestly priced, and has a fresh atmosphere. HOWEVER, if you are looking for a place with a staff that can understand and replicate English well- this place is not for you. I've heard various people toss that comment around every now and then. It may just be my opinion, but it seems as though the best authentic, non-American eateries are those with misplaced English skills, or a complete lack thereof.   Now I myself usually don't deviate from an ace menu item once I've found it, and as such I've had the same \"Southwest Quesadilla\" from Zaps for the past 6 years. First thing I've ever ordered from 'em. Think I care? Nah. Sure don't. I have only recently been \"around the block\" with other various items on the menu and to no shock whatsoever, find them all exquisite as well.  Overall, here are a few things to consider about the business: 1) Adequate spacial constraints with an up and downstairs, each consisting of its own outdoor section, 2) lakeside view, 3) great food/ menu combinations & a plethora of menu items from a very basic \"kids\" to a \"make-your-own\" spin off anything they have to offer really, 4) generous portion sizes, 5) full bar selection and quality margaritas, 6) drink specials for every day of the week, 7) VERY quick service (9 out of 10). Can't beat it.  And for Cinco de Mayo? This is the place to be."}
{"text":"Went here with my girlfriend the other day. My food was fine. My girlfriend ordered ACP chicken, and it came out with very little chicken or cheese. It was more vegetables and red sauce, which I think is just ketchup and barbecue sauce. We got a margarita pitcher, and it tasted like there was not much alcohol in it. I can't shake the feeling this restaurant cheats its customers, and I'll be looking at other Mexican restaurants in the area before considering here again."}
{"text":"Bombay Chimichanga and their salsas with the chips yummmm.My third visit and happy with the taste and quick service."}
{"text":"Absolutely best Mexican in Charlotte! The service was prompt. The margarita was amazing! Best wings in Charlotte! The area are large and price is fair. Absolutely love the deck atmosphere. Must eat here frequently!"}
{"text":"Earlier tonight I had the pleasure of eating at a gem of a restaurant in the University Area of Charlotte, NC - Zapaata's Cantina Mexican Restaurant.  I have been eating at Zapata's since 2002, and like a fine wine, the place gets better with time.   We arrived around 7pm on a rainy Thursday evening.  (If you've never been to Zapata's in University Area before, it can be kinda tricky to locate.  It is in the back left of the plaza.)  When my date and I walked in, we were greeted by a friendly gentleman host, who gave us the option of sitting upstairs or downstairs.  Since we've seen the place before, we chose to sit upstairs.    No sooner were we seated, when warm tortilla chips, and two bowls of fresh pico were placed before us.  Tecate was on special, so I gladly order one, my date ordered a coke that didn't taste quite right. (YOU MIGHT WANT TO STAY AWAY FROM THE SODAS.)  Our drinks, including ice-cold water; were brought to us within minutes.  My drink came in a can, however it was accompanied with a frosted-mug and fresh lime.    I order the fajitas-burrito, my date ordered the (grilled) shrimp tacos.  Both orders arrived promptly and smoking hot to our table.   On my plate was a giant burrito stuffed with chicken and steak (I always get the mix), beans, cheese, peppers, and onions, etc.  The outside of the massive burrito was smothered in melted cheeses including guacamole and sour-cream which were splattered across the top.  The shrimp-tacos looked just as appealing.  Both entree's were brought to our tables on extremely hot plates. and were surrounded by warm refried-beans and yellow rice - cooked to perfection.    We both loved our meals.  We both had plenty to put in a box and take home for a late-night snack or lunch tomorrow.    There is much debate amongst life-long UCBers about which is the best Mexican restaurant in the University Area; with the contestants being Monterrey, Los Arcos, or Zapata's.  My nod goes to Zapata's by a smidgen over Monterrey!   Our Bill: 1 coke, 1 Tecate, 2 waters, 1 fajitas-burrito, 1 shrimp-taco = $30.00  Service:  The service is simply amazing.  I've probably been to Zapata's over 20 times, and even though I've have had a few not so tasty meals, the SERVICE has always been top-notch.   BEWARE OF:  **If you get the shrimp tacos, I recommend them grilled.  **Watch for the pulled-chicken.  It's not so tasty compared to the chicken-breast or steak.  **$2.25 Tecate cans on Thursday nights.  **You can get a steak/chicken mix with the burritos"}
{"text":"This is a great local Mexican joint..  modern priced, comfortable, good ritas and sangria and standard Mexican food done California style. I am from Los Angeles and there are a million of these sort of places here, so it was nice to have a local Mex place that was casual, consistently good, friendly, laid back and fun.  My faves are Tortilla Soup & Street Tacos..   I have also heard that they turn it into a Spanish club on the weekends, which is awesome."}
{"text":"Yeah.   Don't do it... they told me the slices of American cheese was \"Mexican cheese\"  .      Los Arcos is .2 miles away.   Enjoy their authentic Mexican food AND awesome lunch buffet.   Thank me later."}
{"text":"After standing at the door of this establishment for 3 minutes while the hostess and her companion chatted, my friend and I were not seated. When we turned to the door to leave, the male hostess decided then to seat us but at that point it was too late and we were already aggravted. Customer service was horrible."}
{"text":"Is a very good Mexican restaurant for the area. It is a mix of traditional Mexican food and the typical food you find at Mexican restaurants like Monterey, Azteca, La Única, etc... They have huge portions and a variety of food to choose from. They are a tiny bit more pricey than other restaurants of their type but they are worth it for their quality of food. If you go on Friday or Saturday nights you can have the chance to listen to their in store musician who is very good and takes requests. My only other complaint is that sometimes service can be slow but I've noticed it only on busy times so it is to be expected."}
{"text":"My family and I used to patron here quite a bit but I feel the customers have been ruining the experience lately (large groups, loud) . Food-wise though, this was one of the most authentic places and the flavors were amazing for most of their dishes...Just don't order a burger for a child as they arent fresh but a frozen patty. Good prices and large portions also had us leaving very full. I'd still recommend them but they are less family friendly these days because the wrong type of crowds have caught on to this place."}
{"text":"Lovely. Great service and the food was amazingly fresh and delicious! Very impressed. Thank you for the great afternoon! PS: How can I forget...THE MARGARITAS WERE OUT OF THIS WORLD!!!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots in university to have s good time! The service is fast and the food is ok. although I believe the margaritas are not made from fresh ingredients, they are some if the best in town. The facilities needs some cosmetic work but you'll never this place in a worse mood than you came."}
{"text":"This is REALLY good Mexican!  We went there two nights in a row when in town."}
{"text":"So I'm staying near this restaurant and looked like it was in a nice location. Im Mexican so this restaurant advertises as an Authentic Mexican Restaurant which is not true. Now for the average American yea this place is ok. But I felt deeply dishonored when I ordered the quesadilla and got something that looks worst than a quesadilla from taco bell which I can buy for 1$ and yet they charged me 10$. If your looking for REAL Mexican food. Don't go here. They need a new chef or at least someone who cares."}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican!  Chips were crispy served with salsa.  chimichanga served with guacamole accompanied by rice and beans  was delicious.  Sat on the patio since the weather was so nice."}
{"text":"They take for ever for food we are extremely disappointing. Not sure we will come ever come back l. 30 minutes later we are still waiting.. This is horrible just horrible  They being the fajita and no silver wear  No rice and beams  No flower tortillas   The manager could care less the order was wrong."}
{"text":"I had an early Friday dinner here. The strawberry frozen margarita was strong and that's how I like it (* wink *). The servers and the hostesses were nice. The view of the boardwalk is relaxing to sit by and listen to the music they have playing there. The food was delicious. I had grilled chicken street tacos and the black beans came in a tortilla chip bowl, which is something I've never seen before. They serve you medium and hot salsa from the get go. Waitstaff was attentive and great to have a conversation with, they definitely know how to connect and relax a customer."}
{"text":"Food & service unpredictable. Not a well run restaurant. Stopped going there as food went downhill. Then someone said it had gotten better again. OK, new chef/corporate management? We ordered takeout and had to throw it out or we'd both be in the hospital (if we were lucky). Dish came with unidentifiable avacados - they were BLACK!!! Took one bite of the chicken and spit it out. A shame, we enjoyed going there, but something has gone very wrong. Food poisoning is no fun folks, and it can kill you. With all Charlotte has to offer, skip this joint!!!"}
{"text":"Nasty restaurant!  Roaches the size of a pinky finger!  Argh!  As if it could get any worse, the employees are rude and dismissive.  I won't even waste any more time on this restaurant...I get nauseous just thinking about my experience."}
{"text":"The manager was rude! He wouldn't honor his own coupon because he said the printing company messed up! Then he said I couldn't get the Thursday drink special because I didn't have two people in my party! I told him it was unacceptable and he said well leave then if you don't like it! Upon my exit he resorted to name calling! Unfortunately he lost our business forever! Take our advise go to Los Arcos! We did and loved it!"}
{"text":"I love this place.  I've had a few dishes here that weren't all that, but I keep going back for the Santa Fe Chimichanga.  I must've had about 20 of these in the past year...lol!  I love the rice, and it's great for dipping the nachos into along with the beans.  This is a great place, and I'm a regular."}
{"text":"The food is average americanized mexican but the service can be improved. Although the waiter was prompt, our order was incorrect and we did not receive any refills. There were only about 4 parties in the restaurant so it wasn't due to being busy."}
{"text":"This was a great Mexican restaurant. The burrito's were great! I'm guessing it's the best Mexican food in Charlotte but it's the only restaurant I have been to in Charlotte."}
{"text":"This place was so inviting and delicious. It was date night for my man and I. We were escorted to the downstairs area where the decor was super detailed. The bar is downstairs as well. There is a super cute patio area to eat while overlooking the water. The staff is very nice. The food came out very hot and so delicious. I will be back."}
{"text":"Legitimately the worst Mexican food I've had in Charlotte. Possibly the worst Mexican food I've ever had. Tacos were cold, soggy and tasted microwaved. I think they might have given me an order that was sent back and was being held. The rice was pretty decent. I took my food to work because I didn't want to waste it, gave it to some friends and it was promptly thrown away."}
{"text":"Bottom line 3.5 stars.  My date and I were greeted and seated promptly. The chips and salsa were delivered but the chip person made no effort to say hi or anything as they normally do in mexican restaurants.  It took quite a while for a server to get our drinks and it also took too long for them to actually get our drinks out. After that, however, the service was much better.  I ordered the shrimp tacos and my date ordered the fish tacos.   My plate was quite good...the fried shrimp tasted amazing I was surprised. The refried beans were also tasty.  The top shelf margarita had a good balance. Strong by flavorful.  I have to point out one quick detail in hopes management sees this.   After we were done eating and drinking I was going to use the restroom but a busboy ( the same guy who delivered the chips without a smile or a hello)  was sweeping the one toilet one urinal bathroom. He saw me and just kept doing his thing.  I ended up having to drive home to use the bathroom.   I would suggest they clean the bathrooms after all or most guests are done eating or at least allow the guest to use it.   The food was good the service could use some work, but overall not a bad spot."}
{"text":"Just moved from San Diego, CA and trying to find a good Mexican food restaurant. Went here and was bummed that they didn't have Chile Colorado but they made up for it with how great their Garden Fresh Burrito was. It had tons of veggies grilled perfectly and it was more food than I could even think of eating. My husband had a shredded pork burrito and even though his was a bit small he said it was tasty. Definitely going to be visiting this place again."}
{"text":"One of the coolest Mexican places in the University area.   Service and staff area always friendly.   Weekend Karaoke is a blast.   Definitely one of my favorite drinking spots in the area."}
{"text":"Food was decent I suppose. The best thing we had was the cheese dip. Most dishes were overpriced for the quality but that is probably because it is on the \"boardwalk.\" Out of the three of us who went, no one was impressed. They do give out a free dessert chip to all guests and it was actually good. We had the combination 20, arroz con pollo, and the two street taco plate. It's Mexican food, but it was really bland in comparison to Mexican food I have had before. The service wasn't excellent either. I'll find a different Mexican restaurant to eat at next time."}
{"text":"Been here a few times. But nothing about it is wow to me. The food is ok, same as the service. The best thing is there location. Other than that there are many better Mexican restaurants in the area with better pricing and service. Don Pedro's and Cazuela's being 2 of my top choice."}
{"text":"I've always liked this place. But I think they changed their cook. Spinach enchiladas were one of my favorites here, and the ones served now don't even look and taste like they used to be before. Overall, decent place. I love the nachos served here!"}
{"text":"Price: The food was more expensive than I expected, but that didn't hinder my ability to judge this food with the upmost neutrality.   Quality of food: Yummy. 8/10.  Taquitos Dorados were DELICIOUS (but they didn't come with mashed potatoes like the menu suggested).  Street tacos were GOOD (juicy).   Quantity of food: You get a lot; this is where the price redeems itself. You pay a lot for a lot. If you're trying to dine for a family of six, it's probably not your best option. But it could be. You choose.   Service: Not super attentive. Maybe a 3/10. Sopapillas are served with your check, so that's nice."}
{"text":"I like Zapata's! The decor is \"Mexicany\" without being cheezy and my Garden Burrito was delicious. The warm red sauce they served with the burrito was smoky and yummy!"}
{"text":"Um...no!  Chips are obviously from bags.  Salsa were runny and definitely not spicy.  (Remember - \"made in New York City?!?!?)  I had the carne asada.  It was ok.  I usually devour the entire place but I just couldn't get into it.  The rice was bland.  Overall, it was just disappointing!  I should have just eaten at Qdoba which was nearby.  Service was mediocre.   Moral: just because it is right next to the hotel doesn't mean food is gonna be awesome."}
{"text":"I came for the great Diablo Wings of old and got wings drenched in Texas Pete (new recipe) instead.  The manager came out and brought me a new order which was supposed to then have the Diablo sauce on them. Yet, he comes back with extra Texas Pete drenched on my wings. The server then asked if I was happy with the wings but of course I was not. My daughter loves Mexican food while I'm not a huge fan. But once again, I loved their Diablo wings. Welp, if you want wings drenched in Texas Pete hot sauce then this place is for you.   P.S My family really loves this place. My family gives it 3 stars. Food is not terrible but not something that they're dying to get back to."}
{"text":"I have been going to Zaps for years and I cannot rave enough about it. The waiters are always friendly, rarely do we have to even ask for a chip refill, and the salsa is awesome. The queso dip is really good too!. I haven't ventured far from the quesadillas so I cant tell you much about the rest of menu but I can say that they have great quesadillas with generous portions and you can't go wrong no matter what you try. The steak quesadilla is my favorite by far. I have tried a few other dishes and I haven't found something I don't like, and since Mexican isn't my favorite type of food, that's saying a lot. They also have fantastic Margaritas! I don't like overly surgary ones like the ones in super markets and this is far from it. Very fresh tasting with a good balance of flavors. Overall, great place with great food and a good atmosphere. They recently redid the entire inside of the restaurant and it was a well deserved upgrade that made this place even better than before."}
{"text":"Terrible food, service always rushed.  I've waited longer at Taco Bell, and had better tacos.  The food is greasy and tasteless.   Zapata's has a few small positives.  Their outside patio looking over the man-made pond is nice.  Their margaritas are good, chips and salsa decent.  When I'm just meeting a friend for drinks, not a meal, this place is fine."}
{"text":"Food was only ok here. Wasn't what I was used to like back home in California. A good thing about this place is that they give you good size portions for a good price. They have a good happy hour here as well for margaritas and beers. The place is comfortable with dinning availability upstairs and downstairs.  Again the food was quality was average. If you are looking for a place to satisfy your hunger then this is your place."}
{"text":"Been coming here for 17 years plus! The lamb and cheese dip is phenomenal! Highly recommended and great for family and very kid friendly! Great environment!"}
{"text":"Was taken here for a work lunch the other day.  The food was reasonably tasty but unexciting.  When I order carnitas, I expect meat that's been cooked to extreme tenderness, not big chewy pork chunks.  Rice and beans were just OK, and normally I'll hoover up every black bean on my plate, but I felt no compulsion to finish them.  The nopales salad on the side was tasty, and the salsa that came with everything was yummy, as others have mentioned.  My companions seemed pretty happy about their fish tacos, so maybe I'll try those if I get brought back here again.    I'd say, don't go here expecting anything other than lightly spiced totally Americanized Mexican food. It's not bad for what it is, but the whole experience, food and ambiance, seems designed to be nonthreatening to middle-aged white people. If I want that kind of experience, Cantina 1511 does it way better.  And since I live a few hundred yards from some of Charlotte's real Mexican and Salvadoran holes-in-the-wall, I'd probably give Zapata's a pass if I were the one picking the restaurant."}
{"text":"SO DISSAPOINTED (AS ARE NEIGHBORS OF OURS).  The quality of the food has gone way downhill as has the service. Our neighbors used to go there every Friday night but recently told us the service and food were becoming unacceptable, and they were looking for a new Friday night spot. Strangely, we had just eaten \"take out\" the night before and it tasted much different and lacked the quality we were accustomed to. We had a Living Social to them so decided to give them another shot. YIKES! Worse than ever, and the girl who took our order missed one of the meals, so my husband sat for a half hour without even being offered a beverage on the house. The enchiladas were poorly made and for the most part tasteless. Anyone have any suggestions for GOOD Mexican food in the Ballantyne/Pineville area? We're done with this poor excuse for a Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"Torn between 3-4 stars, but have to give this place a 4.  Located right in front of our hotel, it's convenient. We were seated right away, and given 2 large baskets of tortilla chips for our party of 5. I really like how they give us our own bowl of salsa per person, double dipping time! The restaurant wasn't too crowded, so service was fairly good. I had just landed from SFO, so wanted to unwind with my jack and coke. Others ordered the huge frozen margaritas that were very tasty! Very addicting!  We ordered guacamole, which came in a huge molcajete, those stone looking bowls. Lots of guac but a bit bland for my taste, had to add salt to my portion.   Flipped through their book of a menu, and everything is fairly cheap! I wanted variety so went for the chicken tamale, ground pork enchilada, and chile releno with refried beans and mexican rice. All this for $10! And the plate was huge!!! The enchilada was bleh, tamale was decent, but was blown away that their chile releno was so tasty. It's really hard to find a good one, but this chile not only had a kick to it, but lots of cheese.  Coworkers also all enjoyed their dishes for the most part. The food is good, but not out of this world. Towards the end of dinner, service was...gone. I waited 10 minutes for another jack and coke, and he totally forgot so had to ask another guy. It basically came as my dessert as we were all done. They do give a mini dessert to all, fried crispers with whipped cream on top and a bunch of cinnamon.  Decent tasting food and huge portions for a very low price."}
{"text":"The service was fast and attentive. The food was hot, fresh, and tasty with large but not overwhelming proportions. Would definitely return."}
{"text":"A fairly average dining experience at Zapatas. The carne asada tacos were seasoned well and had a wonderful charred flavor. They say they're served with guac though - which I never saw. The beans were not flavored well, but the rice was good. Portion sizes are large. Margaritas are pretty watered down (mine tasted like straight sour which sucks for $9). Our server was okay - she didn't regularly check on us and had no answer for why we didn't get guac with our tacos. The (upstairs) patio is nice, though needs some attention - it was fairly dirty. (They have three patios btw). Bathrooms were not stocked. Prices were slightly too much for what you get."}
{"text":"OK Mexican dishes. Not authentic but good and tasty. Quick fix if your in that neighborhood."}
{"text":"Food was good . It was plenty of food .our server was very friendly and nice and had a good recommendation.  The price was reasonable and very quite and nice place to eat some good mexican food."}
{"text":"Picked this restaurant because it was close to my hotel and was very pleasantly surprised.  I ordered the wings and they were excellent and the portion was huge.  I then had the beef fajitas and they too were excellent and I washed them down with the special margarita of the day.  I will repeat the next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"I really, really like this place.  I've been to Charlotte two weeks in a row for business.  On the first trip I discovered Zapata's by accident.  On the second trip I came back because I liked the first meal so much.  Situated on a small man-made lake in a modern mixed development, you can enter the upper entrance (which is more strip-mall esque) or from the patio on the water (which is a little more unique feeling).  I have eaten inside downstairs (which felt cave-like in a very cozy way) and upstairs on the deck (which was delightful).    I've ordered the Tacos Al Carbon and Tacos De Cerdo Al Horno.  Both dishes came with crumbled queso fresco on top, a simple yet clever garnish that made my food look EVEN MORE DELICIOUS.  Both dishes came with a side of a very unique pico de gallo: rather than diced vegetables, this was made from delicately thin strips of onions and peppers.  In addition to the flavor being top-notch, the presentation and mouth-feel was unique - I wish all places made their pico like this.  The top-shelf margarita, curiously always on sale, was very good.  Nothing particularly special, just a good margarita.  The Tacos Al Carbon were good, but not nearly as good as the De Cerdo Al Horno.  Amongst hundreds of meals at mexican places over my life thus far, the carnitas taco things stand out.  Way out.  And finally, with your check comes a complimentary dessert: a sweet fried tortilla topped with a dollop of fresh whipped cream, drizzled in honey.  GO HERE NOW."}
{"text":"The salsa and guacamole is fresh and delicious! We ordered thier top shelf margarita which was very good."}
{"text":"First time here, visited Carowinds so on the way home we wanted Mexican food and came across this restaurant.. Friendly waitress and food and salsa tasted fresh"}
{"text":"The food was good.  Did not get to enjoy it because they would not turn on the air condition.  It was hard to enjoy the food due to heat."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed.  The hostess acted like she didn't want to be bothered.  She guided my party to a booth.  It clearly was dirty.  I pointed to the crumbs on the chair and table.  She half-assed wiped it away.  She only gave us two menus when there were three of us. I got up and picked up a menu from the counter.  It was so gross on the inside.  Food was on it.  I should have left then.  No stupid me stayed.  As we waited for our food I was looking around.  I see a spider web between my booth and the one behind us.  Do they ever clean this place?  This makes me wonder what the kitchen looks like. I will never go back or recommend this place.  I'm sorry I wrote this but I like its important to let others know."}
{"text":"This place totally held it's own.  After living in Los Angeles, I can say for sure I can tell the difference between good and bad Mexican food.  This place is really legit.  The refried beans were excellent."}
{"text":"Granted, it's been years since my first (and only) visit to Zapata's, still a fave of my sister's who lives in the city, but this is the best place I've had AUTHENTIC sangria, outside of Madrid!  Yes, sliced and halved fruits steeped in good red wine, not fruit juices.  At least, that's how our sangria was served all those many years ago (late 90s or early 2000s).  I plan on asking her to take me here again on my next visit next month, so I might have an update!  :)  Stay cool!"}
{"text":"They had a sign advertising $1.50 for 16oz. Beers. They said it was expired and sold me a $2 bud light. I ordered chicken fundido. Was supposed to have cheese inside. It did not. Their marinated chicken was really just shredded chicken. The jalapeño cheese and cheddar that was supposed to be on top was just a kraft single. The margaritas and salsa were good. Patio nice also."}
{"text":"I had my graduation in there, I had reserve a 20 guest people and it went good but the service took hours but the cool thing was that they had charaoeke, I had fun honestly"}
{"text":"I visited today with my son to enjoy the day. The waitress didn't ask how we were doing can she help us pick something out. She wasn't helpful at all never asked how our food was. It was so nasty my stomach hurt so bad afterwards. I didn't want a to go box & she didn't even ask was everything ok. I go out to eat a lot & Mexican is one of my favorites but I will never go back there."}
{"text":"Seriously good food and drink. But and I hate this but, the music was so loud I downloaded a decibel reader. 97 decibels folks. And this wasn't for the loudest piece of music. My eardrums are still tingling. Seriously good food though. I had the pork carnitas which were perfect. Husband's tacos were very good. My Organic Skinny Margarita was not too sweet and a decent size. Such a shame about the noise level."}
{"text":"Let me start with the good...the food was very good! Nice flavor, nice presentation, served hot and without a crazy long wait. The restaurant itself is nicely laid out and well maintained. We arrived after any dinner rush they may have had so we were seated immediately as there was only one other party in the restaurant at the time...it was relatively late...like 8pm.  Now the oddness that causes them to lose a few stars...the service! We were catching up and not ready to order our food immediately so the server hovered right over us even though we said we needed more time. So he just stood like two feet away and hovered. So awkward. So we ordered, we ate, and then he hovered waiting for the bill to be paid. I'd not put in my credit card and he picked up the bill twice. DUDE! We are not ready! No one else is here! CHILL!! And lastly, despite his never being more than a few feet away, hovering over us, we had to continually ask for refills. I'd come back in a pinch, but this definitely won't be making it to my list of great places to catch up with an old friend."}
{"text":"This is the best authentic Mexican restaurant I've ever been to. VERY friendly staff and the tacos are wonderful! Fresh salsa and guacamole on demand. The drinks are a decent price as well. This is my go to spot at least twice a month on date nights!"}
{"text":"Some friends and I were staying at the Hilton Charlotte University Place just on the other side of the lake and walked over to Zapata's for dinner on a Saturday night, around 8 PM. The restaurant was busy, but there was an empty table right inside the back door. I walked over to the station at the base of the stairs and asked if we needed to wait or if we could just sit at the empty table and was told to go ahead and take a seat.  Fast forward a couple of minutes and an employee approaches the table to ask us why we're sitting there. I explained that I was told it was okay, and after a short conversation with the person who told me we could sit there, the employee went about his business. We were given chips and salsa (chips were slightly stale and had no salt on them at all; salsa was AMAZING but served in horribly inconvenient bowls that caused a mess every time you dipped into them) and ordered beers and waters. The beers arrived quickly, but we had to ask not one but TWO more times before we finally got our water.  Food-wise, I ordered the Enchiladas Suizas, which were extremely bland. My friend enjoyed his Pollo Borracho, mostly because of the sauce, but overall the food wasn't impressive. Getting our waitress to come back to our table to refill anything (salsa, chips, drinks) or to bring us our check was next to impossible. Honestly the only reason I'm giving Zapata's two stars instead of just one is because I know they were busy (and obviously that affects the quality of service) and because my friend enjoyed his meal, though I didn't like mine. That said, if I was to end up back in this area, I doubt I'd return to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Long time since I've been here. Now I remember why. Went today for margaritas ordered 2 large. Suppose to have 2 shots of top shelf tequila and grandmanjiar. So watered down and full of ice it was ridicules the manager came over after the waitress even said it was weak and said it was ok. Ok for them but not ok for $12.99. Never again"}
{"text":"I haven't been to many Mexican restaurants in the area, so I don't know what the standards are for authenticity around here, but this is a very stereotyped Mexican restaurant.  The decor, music, food, everything is not like it is in Mexico, it's like you might think Mexico is like if you've only experienced Mexico from Epcot and old movies.  The food isn't bad, but it's not great either...and there is A LOT of food.  So it's a great value if you're hungry and definitely edible.  They have a few items that aren't found in most such places so that's good, but I'd guess that if you wanted Mexican food it wouldn't matter if you chose this place or one of the other equivalent places around here."}
{"text":"This place serves Mexican with a Spanish bent. I've been here for dinner dozens of times over the years, and finally realized I ought to review it.   We stopped in last night after a 49ers Men's soccer match (beat Elon, 1-0). My son wanted to go to Dish, but Plaza Midwood is 20 minutes away at best, and it was 9:00 PM. \"Whaddaya want, Trev?\" \"Nachos!\"   Well, he wasn't disappointed, even if he didn't get to pick the 'rant. They started us off with their usual never-see-the-bottom trays of chips and salsa. You really do have to be careful with these, because you can ruin your appetite for dinner by filling up on warm, crunchy tortilla chips and hot, complexly flavored salsas!  Restraint was worth it.  I had a wonderful Pollo Asado Burrito (very healthy chicken and veggies with a tomatillo sauce over it all). My wife had the La Union Chimichanga, which she loved. Portion sizes were HUGE, so we ate lunch off of our dinners the next day.   The boys got what they wanted. My \"all American twin\" got his usual chicken fingers and fries, and his brother got a taco, rice, and beans.  They have decent draft beer, and various daily drink specials, so if you're thirsty for relaxation, get something from the bar.  This is probably my second or third favorite Mexican restaurant in town. We go here, because it is close to us. I love Cantina 1511 on East Blvd, and Las Margarita on Independence near Sharon Amity, too.  That said, this place is flavorful, consistent, and the service is great. They also have some interesting and colorful decor. Occasionally, they'll add live entertainment, too.   Check out their online menu at:  http://www.zapatasrestaurant.com/"}
{"text":"This is the restaurant my wife and always go to for a really good mexican meal  with margaritas!!  Burritos, enchaladas and tequila good combination!!"}
{"text":"Zapata's has been around for quite a while.  It used to be one of my favorite restaurants, but has since gone a bit downhill.  The building could use an update and maybe a little more care with the food to bring it up to yesteryear's standards.  The location is great, right off of Catawba, tucked away in a strip mall that has also seen better days.  The hostess who sat us and our wait staff were very friendly and helpful.  The waiters were very attentive and asked us many times if we had needs.  Thus, the 4th star!  Our meal was good.  We had shrimp tacos and beef chimichanga dinner.  My daughter thought the chimichanga wasn't crisp enough, but I loved it.  The shrimp tacos were good, not great.  The prices were reasonable and the salsa was fresh and delicious.  A good deep clean and a perk up from chef, and this place will be back up to 5 stars in no time!"}
{"text":"The food is great! I wish I could give 5 starts but I can't! Never got my water refill, and their deep fried ice cream is not deep fried  it's been rolled in cornflake cereal...."}
{"text":"Very nice Mexican/Spanish food. I will drive 45 minutes into University to eat here. Service is always attentive. Patio and inside seating are nice. Very family friendly, although I don't have small children anymore. I am struck by the numbers of Latino patrons, and I think that attests to the quality of the food here. If you know the real deal, you don't patronize a crappy representation! I especially love the rice and beans, the cheeses (and the generous amount of cheeses!!!) and the beer. Did I mention the chicken dishes are all quite good. Have not tried the beef and fish entrees- yet."}
{"text":"Had an amazing take out meal from here. The Hawaiian tacos were fantastic! Everything my party tried was great, very fresh and flavorful, and abundant portions. Excellent guacamole!"}
{"text":"Our favorite Mexican restaurant in Charlotte! Love the fajitas, fresh guac, and chorizo tacos. Their salsa is great. Pina Coladas are awesome. We have never had a bad meal here."}
{"text":"I haven't been back here in years. The food is mediocre at best. Head to Monterrey's."}
{"text":"Everything I tried her was delicious. It did wow every audience in my group and not just the food, but the drinks too. Excellent service and specially the outside sitting.."}
{"text":"This place is seriously delicious. Good location. Quick service. Got spinach enchiladas and they were so good. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Not the best mexican restaurant. The food was very bland and a little bit over priced for what it really was. I ordered pollo fundido which is pretty good, but they served it with slices of american cheese on top, which is not how pollo fundido is supposed to be served. I would not recommend this mexican restaurant if you are looking for authentic mexican food."}
{"text":"First of all, what a lovely location!  Outdoor seating with a view of the lake available.  I ordered the cheese enchiladas with Mexican rice and retried beans.  Creamy, simple goodness.  Pre dinner, the customary chips and salsa arrive.  The salsa is a bit bland for my taste, but I like over the sand dune hot, which sets me apart from the general public.  Good, courteous service earns points."}
{"text":"Great experience. Server was nice and fast. Was able to get my favorite enchiladas with shrimp instead of chicken. Loved that I could get a sugar rim on my peach margarita. I would come back here again."}
{"text":"I should've just gone to Taco Bell or Monterrey. After hearing rave reviews from Mexican, Puerto Rican, and Dominican friends, I finally got the opportunity to eat here last night.   I arrived around 9:30pm and was sat instantly. we were the only party in the upstairs part. My friend, who is Mexican, chose to get the rice water (forgot the original name) and it was delicious! Chips and Salsa was plentiful, I didn't care for the salsa at all. Tasted bland and watered down to me. The chips were obviously out the bag, which I don't mind but some salt or some seasoning was needed.   I ordered the Street Tacos and my friend got the Shrimp Fajitas. He loved his fajitas! Now, my Street Tacos on the other hand is a completely different story. The tortillas/soft taco shells were greasy and cold. I couldn't even eat them. The items inside the taco weren't that great either. Huge strips of chicken that tasted bland, barely there pico de gallo, and a sprinkle of cheese. There was lettuce and guac on the side. I also asked for sour cream on the side to try to make it taste good. It also came with rice and beans. The beans were beans, nothing special. The rice was the best part of the meal... but it was room temperature which I didn't like much.  Service is the reason why I will never give the food another chance. Our server was Ingrid. She was pretty great at first. When a Spanish speaking couple came to sit upstairs, she began talking to them so me and my friend had to wait about 10 minutes for the check once we were done eating. Then, she assumed the checks were together and seemed to have a shocked look on her face when I asked to get them split. We had to wait about another 10 minutes for her to finish talking to her manager/co-worker. The thing that that really put the icing on the cake was seeing a charge for sour cream. I wouldn't have minded if I knew when ordering sour cream with my tacos that there would be an extra charge, but to me that is just Serving 101 to tell a customer that all add ons were extra. Paying $1.25 to attempt to make the tacos taste a little bit better was ridiculous. When asked about it she told me, \"All add ons have a charge to the ticket\". No attempt to atleast say, \"I'm sorry, but sour cream has a charge.\" I just don't like being surprised when the ticket comes. There was a man, maybe the expo manager or kitchen manager that refilled our chips, salsa, and drinks. I'm not the greatest tipper, but I always tip 25-50% on inexpensive meals so I felt obligated to leave a note telling her that I would've tipped if I knew about the charge and if I could've got the ticket faster instead of watching her chit chat literally right in front of me while waiting for my ticket One of the first times in a while that I didn't tip. I'm in the service industry and I know that if I ever treated a customer like that, I would've gotten wrote up and had to have comped their meal out of my pocket.   Super long story short: Sub-par food, worse service."}
{"text":"How or where should i start?, Well my friends and i was there on sunday evening. We was a party of six and i understand every restaurants do get busy but it wasn't too busy. I tried to get the server attention total of four time. Ours water was empty and in need of hot sauce but the server was no where to be seen. I saw how others table was being treated was nicer than they treated us. I will not be going there no more."}
{"text":"It's okay but I've had better the salsa is very mild no kick. Food lacked a lot of seasoning. But it came out hot and and fresh"}
{"text":"The service was good but I got the 'pollo poblano' entree and it was so not appetizing. The rice and bean stuff was fine but ugh I am never getting that again. They gave us some chips and salsa. The salsa was too liquidy. It sort of seems like as thought they added much more water into it. The dessert thing that they just gave us was interesting. So technically got an appetizer an dessert for free and they give you more so that's nice"}
{"text":"Went to Zapata's for a work lunch right before Thanksgiving. This place is great because they have speedy service, making this a quick and efficient place for a time-sensitive work lunch.  I ordered the three tacos with Spanish rice and refried beans. I got two beef tacos and one chicken taco. All three had great flavor and were fresh when I got them. I could tell because they weren't soggy from sitting under a heat lamp awaiting their exit from the kitchen.   Zapata's is reasonably priced and they are great for groups. Our service was excellent."}
{"text":"Should be 3 stars as I've had my fair share of bombtastic Mexican food but the service we received earned this review an extra star.   We came here for lunch over the weekend craving some Mexican food. We walked in at 3:05p but our server let us order off of the lunch menu, very cool. Lunch menu items are basically half price. They also serve complimentary chips and salsa too! The chips are seasoned and crunchy. I wasn't a fan of the salsa since I like chucks spicy salsa. El torito is better in this sense.   He also let us sub Mexican rice and refried beans as sides, a second score. We ended up ordering a chicken chimichanga and spinach quesadilla which came out to $15 before tip., pretty sweet deal considering the amount of food. My boyfriend like the chimichanga though there should have been more cheese inside of it. My spinach quesadilla was good too, but not the best light option. It was a little too heavy for me as the spinach filling is pretty creamy and greasy. This would be a good drunk munchies food especially on the $4 margarita college days.   We will be back especially for lunch. They also have a punch card too! Get 10 lunches and get the next free! Hopefully they have some salad on the menu too lol"}
{"text":"Charlotte - Let me tell you that first off the Customer Service was GREAT ! I mean they was on point.... The food was Great also and I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Great mexican food I stumbled upon while staying nearby on a trip. This has to be the best place in Charlotte for Mexican food beacuse, in my opinion, Charlotte is a dump occupied by slightly successful, ill-educated hillbillies. Hope this helps."}
{"text":"Decent food, good drink specials and real fish tacos! Similar to other Spanish restaurants, they have Taco Tuesdays and Margarita Mondays I think? It might be Friday actually....I'll get back to you on that.   I normally go through two baskets of chips and three cups of salsa all by my lonesome. That's a good sign. The rice and beans are always consistently well made. Enchiladas are okay, but street tacos are a yessir.   While they offer authentic beer battered Baja style fish tacos on either flour or corn tortillas, they sometimes lack flavor. A little sprinkle of salt will solve that problem! Substitute corn over flour tortillas and you will have an epiphany. Cheers to corn tortillas!"}
{"text":"Good texas-mexican food, good location near the Boardwalk Lake. But...  Bad #1: Bad Communication: Bad communication between waiters and management. We were interrupted multiple times because the waiters were lost and didn't know whose food was whose.   Examples: A waiter put two drinks and a dessert on our table without 1st asking us if it was ours. They actually belonged to the table next to us and the couple watched as it happened. The insane thing is, that we were still eating with a full plate of food. lol FAIL.  Bad #2: Restaurant Ran Out of a Vital Item Or Lying: When we got our dessert (which we were thankful for), they gave us an incomplete dessert. I asked, where is the chocolate? The lead waitress said, \"We ran out.\" and walked away. Professional restaurants should not have this problem. Hopefully she wasn't just being lazy or lying because of the rushing.  Bad #3: Customers Forgotten A. We didn't receive or weren't offered any beverage/water refills, the whole hour we had been there. That should be the standard of a waiter or restaurant. Do they a expect a mucho tip, from that?  B. We ran out of chips. We asked for some, the lady never came back. We had to ask a different person. We weren't even sure who our official waiter was actually, because of all of the confusion.  Bad #4: No care. The waiter didn't ask what type of rice we wanted. Plain or Mexican. They just gave us Mexican. No time or attention to see what we needed.  Bad #5: Bad Timing on Execution We sat down and 2 minutes later, the waitress asked if we were ready, as we were still looking at the menu. Very laughable. Their menu is huge.   Maybe I'm complaining too much about small things but I've experienced better. Advice, get new management and a better employee trainee program because they are obviously weak in the service department. Now you have a restaurant full of stubborn, possibly incompetent workers, who probably won't ever change.  Won't be going again, unless the manager apologizes to everyone on here. Well that won't be happening, because obviously \"no comprende\" communication and social media."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by this place after going here for lunch.  For some reason I thought Zapatas was \"upscale\" mexican (with upscale pricing) but I was totally wrong.  I think this is due to the fact that the only other location I know of is in Ballantyne and things tend to be a bit elevated whenever you go to that end of town.  There's a decent lunch menu offered to go with the complementary chips and salsa - which was awesome.  I'm a huge cilantro fan and you can tell they make their salsa fresh (not out of the bottle).  I had a chicken taco salad and was surprised at how big the lunch portion was.  It was packed full of chicken and the sour cream and guacamole was off to the side so you can choose to make your salad \"even healthier\" if desired.  Service was great and quick.... definitely a great spot for lunch and I am assuming a good spot for dinner as well."}
{"text":"5/7/16- Waited for 10 minutes and finally got someone to grab us margaritas. Waited to order food.... Never received service after waiting for 36 minutes, never received a bill.   Found a manager to inform that we never received service or a bill. Manager took our menus that we brought him then said goodnight. No bill no nothing. Manager then chased us saying that we didn't pay for the items that we'd just told him about, to create a dramatic affect.   I didn't appreciate the dramatics after he'd just brushed me off as if service wasn't important. Not to mention, the waitress then made it a point that we could just enter a tip on our bill!   To say this place is a joke is an understatement. It's sad that I have to leave one star!"}
{"text":"The food was ok.  I knocked down one star because the service was horrible.  When I walked in the restaurant, (they have two entries, not sure which one is the \"main\" entry) one waiter was at the bar \"filtering\" with a female customer.  The waitress and a bus boy were talking by the register.  They all saw me and just decided whatever they were doing was more important than greet me and seat me at a table.  The restaurant was not busy by the way.  Finally the female waitress took an excruciating move and left the conversation and sat me.  I order two entree all by myself (I was very hungry and this Asian can eat).  I had a burrito and enchilada.  There were both ok, not bad, but not spectacular.  I could probably went to Chipotle got a good burrito with no bad service.  Definitely will not go back again, I will stick with Chipotle."}
