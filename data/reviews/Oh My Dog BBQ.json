{"text":"Great family spot. My veggie dog was yummy and my husband loved the chili dog he had. This is such a cozy hidden treasure. Delightfully old fashioned with great quality and service."}
{"text":"I was craving for a hot dog for a while but I didn't want a basic dog that you can get anywhere so I decided to hit up Google and see what was offered in Calgary. 

The first result was Oh My Dog. Took a look at their website and found out they were stationed in Midnapore which was seconds to where I was so I decided to give it a try. OMD is located on Midpark Way across from Value Village and other eateries such as Pho So 1, McDonald's, Wendy's, and Olive Grove. When you first step in you'll get greeted by the manager (or is it the owner?) take a look at to what they have to offer, there's a dog for everyone! Not into dogs but want to check the place out? Not to worry they also serve wraps, sandwiches, poutine, ice cream and a couple of sides such as regular and yam fries, onion rings, deep fried pickles, taco salad, and perogie's.

If I were to recommend a dog to choose I would say all of them but really it depends on what your interest is, personally try their OMD their signature foot long dog served with a pound of fries and topped with 10 different toppings. Trust me its worth every dollar for their OMD

Oh My Dog is a guarantee recommendation to anyone who wants to try something new and of course I'll be coming back, maybe even be a repeat customer."}
{"text":"Excellent dogs & fantastic service. We tried the burgers, the Mexican dog & the chilli dog. The French fries were awesome too."}
{"text":"Way better than Tubby Dog. The sausage is well seasoned and has a great texture. I got the pulled pork dog which also has some coleslaw to it, which I loved. My only minor complaint is that the bun was ever so slightly on the dry side. Otherwise this was an absolutely fantastic experience. I also tried the pulled pork poutine which was really good."}
{"text":"Really great place if you're looking for a gourmet hotdog. This place was affordable and tasty. No complaints whatsoever."}
{"text":"The hotdog was dry and the bun so big yiu couldnt taste the meat.  Diaappointing food but good concept."}
{"text":"I love chili dogs and this place did not disappoint. And my friend really enjoyed her pulled pork poutine. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"This place has lots of tasty hot dog options and all at a good price.  I enjoyed the french fries and poutine as well though neither remind me of a great poutine even though they are much better than what you'd end up finding at other restaurants.

Clean and well kept with a friendly staff it's definitely worth stopping at if you're in the area."}
{"text":"I loved this place, true shame it shit down!! If there's any other place like it I would love to know! They had the best poutine"}
{"text":"Just stopped in at oh my dog for the first time, pretty cool little place! Ordered my wife and I some custom hot dogs... Chili,sauerkraut,graded cheese,bacon, and fried onions. They were delicious!! Especially the chili.  We will definitely be going back. I want to try out their puitin as well. Happy customer:)"}
{"text":"GREAT place for gourmet hot dogs. They use buns from the Italian Bakery always fresh. Hot dogs are generous size and are grilled to perfection. I hate boiled hot dogs. My favorite is the chili dog. It is a family recipe of the owners (who usually greets and/or serves you). Fantastic. All the sides are great. Love the skinny style fries. Or my personal favorite is the deep fried pickles! They serve Foothills Ice Cream and make great shakes. The menu has something for everyone doesn't just strictly serve hot dogs. Highly recommended!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent place! DONT miss the best poutine in town! They make their own gravy right from homemade beef vegetable stock. Everything there is homemmade and from scratch. Don't miss this gourmet stop. Whole family (mom, dad, 3 kids) ate for $18 with a coupon! So yum! Coupon is in the entertainment app for iPhone."}
{"text":"The dog and oulled pork are plastic.  Tubby dog is way better. The owner says he gets all his pulled pork from a factory!!! Wow, the nerve of some people opening a restaurant and serving this kind of food. IT was dead when i walked in and it was dead when i left, bad signs when a business has no busy-ness. This place will be out of a business soon."}
{"text":"I had a pulled pork poutine and a hot dog. I expected the hot dog to be much bigger, but it seemed liked the small size ones you would get from the grocery store. The poutine was a nice size, but the fries were lacking, they didn't have the crunch on the outside and soft on the inside feel to them. After the hot dog, I was still left hungry, which is why I got the poutine. I expected much more from this place. To me the hot dogs don't seem like anything special, but I would like to give this place another chance."}
{"text":"This place is pretty awesome for dogs and all sorts of fixins. Would like to see more pork on the menu. not a fan of beef dogs, wieners are where its at IMO. Loved the fries and the friendly attentive service. Its a great place to take kids, awesome job guys!"}
{"text":"Oh my Dog BBQ is spectacular. My husband and I were completely surprised by the little midnapore find. It's unusual to find anything that's not a franchise in the deep SE. Honestly, suburbia has a strong bias towards chains and franchised business. But Oh My Dog is a surprise!

The food is awesome. I'm a vegetarian, and let me tell you, their veggie dog is incredibly good. It's not too salty, and doesn't leave a chalky aftertaste in one's mouth. Also, while it's not advertised, any hot dog on the menu (the gourmet dogs, that is) can be made veggie if you ask. And it's well worth it. Gourmet pizza dogs reign supreme.

My partner always opts for one of the Kielbasa sausages and raves about them every time.

Beyond that, the french fries are very good. I don't know how they do them, but they are crispy and just salty enough without crossing over into the 'too salty' variety that many do.

Take a break and check it out! You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"I had their basic chili dog, and it really was a good hot dog. The chili had a very good flavor and the bun was very fresh. I will have to go again to try their gourmet dogs and sausages. I went back today with friends,  and I have to report that their sausages are excellent. I also figured out that their chili tastes like the chili at Tommy's in SoCal which is a very good thing. Their poutine was excellent, but one word caution is a must, do not order the house special unless you are really hungry or will be sharing it as it is huge and it comes with a gigantic amount of fries."}
{"text":"I was in the area for work and finally made my way in here. It was a Friday so they had their free french fry deal going on. The fries were hot and crispy, but maybe a little overcooked as they were a little dark. They still tasted ok.

For the dog I went with the Texan. It is a sizeable tube steak that comes with cheese, red onion, and BBQ sauce. The hot dog was good, but it wasn't anything I couldn't have made myself. Very basic ingredients. 

If you're expecting something like Tubby Dog, this is not the place for you. If you want a good hotdog with a wealth of topping options or pre-selected combinations then definitely get in here."}
{"text":"Not very good. The pictures do not do a justice for how the food actually tastes. I was really hoping this restaurant would have been much tastier, but I was very wrong. I have heard that this location is now closed, and I can understand why. I went for the Mac and cheese and the pizza dogs. Both weren't near as flavourful as I had hoped."}
{"text":"Nice little hot dog shop in the middle of Midnapore. Lots of variety, great fresh cut fries, and convenient."}
{"text":"Good eats here!

Finally got a chance to try this place out and we quite liked it. My wife ordered the pizza dog, I had the mac n cheeze dog, and we shared a poutine. Everything tasted great and the fries were not soggy at all like some other reviewers mentioned. We'll be back for more soon."}
{"text":"I was super excited to eat here but ended up really disappointed. I ordered a veggie dog and a side of perogies, it can to just over $13 which I felt was extremely over priced for what I got. The perogies seemed dry, old and pretty tasteless, my dog was good but toppings were scarce. She forgot the bbq sauce and there was so little sauerkraut I couldn't even taste it. I don't mind paying the price for really good food but this came no where near that. On the plus side the place was clean and staff were friendly however it's not enough for me to ever eat there again."}
{"text":"All those wonderful hotdogs. The only bad thing about that place is having to choose between all those delicious dogs."}
{"text":"excellent! just so far if you live in the north like we do. used a groupon that was given to us by family and got the texan dog and the pirogi dog! both great but we both preferred the pirogi one. also the poutine is amazing and they have grade A fries. we think they should open a location in central north Calgary ;)"}
{"text":"If you are in the mood for a boiled hot dog topped with precooked kraft dinner on top...... WELL THIS IS THE PLACE FOR YOU!!!"}
{"text":"Wow this is a lot of food. Seriously, a lot.

I would agree that if you're looking for a delicious hot dog in the Calgary metro area, Tubby dog is hands down you're best bet. However, if you're in the South and you want a big, inexpensive meal that will give you loads of energy, this is the best place to go. 

The menu is expansive. There are numerous types of hot dogs and various types of poutine. There are also some other sandwiches that you can order. I ordered the mac and cheese dog and the poutine. For the price, I assumed that I was going to get something fairly small and I ended up with a meal that was easily enough for two people. The mac and cheese was pretty tasty, but the hot dog flavor was definitely lost. The poutine was ok...a little too much gravy and the fries were super soggy. 

The staff was very friendly and the place was clean and bright. Like I said in the beginning, I wouldn't drive to it, but it's better than the McDonalds that it neighbors."}
{"text":"This place was damn good. I ate a regular poutine and a steamy. The hot dog bun was fresh and soft, and the gravy was great. The fries were a little too skinny for my liking but they were fried deep brown and I could taste the potato flavour. I've lived in Montreal for over 8 years and go back every year or so. I consider myself a poutine connoisseur - the first thing I eat when I arrive in Montreal is usually a squeeky cheese piping hot poutine. The first poutine I ever ate was in a small town in Quebec when I was a teenager. 

Anyways, this place was great. It's close to where I live, and the staff is friendly. They have ice cream, a wide assortment of hot dogs and so many fattening greasy treats. I'll go back for a cheat meal again."}
{"text":"This little spot in the SE filled our hunger on a sunny Sunday.  We enjoyed the pulled pork hot dog, the Reuben and some poutine with their new chicken poutine gravy.  Our food came out fresh and hot and we devoured it.  They had lots of other unique dog creations that would be fun to try. It's only $5 to add poutine and a drink to your meal so pretty good price point. I also appreciated the reasonable kids meal- $4.75 for dog, fries and a drink.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"If you're a Montrealer living away from home (no matter how long you've been away, Montreal always stays as home) then you know that every once in a while you get that true craving for a Steamie and a fries or poutine and it is impossible to find a proper one outside Montreal.
Well, I won't ever claim that this one is exactly as home but it is as close as I have ever found to the real thing and it really does the trick when you're over 3000 km from home.
As for the rest of the menu I would really have no idea."}
