{"text":"Went here 2x already...first time i ordered bandeja mixta with various meats and it was ok...second time ordered bandeja paisa and was disapoointed that the chicharron was thin, the food cold and the beans without flavor. I also ordered chorizo and it was uncooked and cold...when i complained the manager offerred another order of chorizo which was also uncooked...the management has no idea what authentic colombian food is and the restaurant can misrepresent how delicious colombian food really is...im sad to say the restaurant is no good but hope they better their skills because its the only hope of having a colombian restaurant here. They have a long ways to go before being a great colombian restaurant like the ones i  chicago."}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant a little after it opened. I could tell they had many improvements to be made. The tables had cloth coverings on them. My table's cloth was dirty with food stains. I don't really know where the name for the restaurant came about from, but it's a little odd for me. Our server needed a lot more improvements on people skills, she was very brief and awkward at times. The water had a funny metal taste to it. Overall, all the food was very bland. Steak had no seasoning, sancocho was just watery. The only decent thing on the table was the fijoles. I'm Colombian and I love our food. Really disappointed that this restaurant did not meet those expectations, but I do hope that they have improved since my last visit. Doubt I'll be going back."}
{"text":"First colombian restaurant in Madison. I recommend 'Bandeja Paisa\" is a combination of the differents flavor (rice, chicharron, ground beef, avocado, arepa, beans...etc) Sodas: Colombiana and Postobon."}
