{"text":"I have been here before over the years and have enjoyed the buffet, but did notice quality reducing with each visit. 
Wow! Talk about a horrible dinner. I had to give this a 1 star because there is no lower choice - if there were I would say - avoid at all costs...more like a - (minus) 10. 

 Went to the Richmond Hill location Sunday evening (27-May-2012 about 7 pm) and tried the buffet - turned out to be the worst food I have ever tasted in my life - and seriously - that is no exaggeration. 
Most of the food was obviously leftovers from a previous event - perhaps the afternoon buffet. Here is a summary: 
White rice - overcooked, mixed with undercooked rice - so I guess you would think it evens out ;) 
Made to order dosa (crepe) - pathetic, limp & colourless - for those who have eaten a dosa before, this tasted nothing like the real thing. 
Sambar - passable, but did not taste like any other sambhar I have ever had before :( tasted more like a poor attempt at making India curry for the first time in your life :(( - with scraps of potato, a couple of tiny tomato pieces 
Rasam - passable) 
Plain vada - overcooked and reheated 
Vada is tamrind sauce - great invention - but for who? vada in sambhar or rasam in the traditional style would have been more than sufficient - but of course - they probably realize that the sambhar here is not actually sambhar, so were forced to look for a way out to make the overcooked reheated vadas edible. 
Daal - was actually the only thing that was edible and I actually enjoyed it with the overcooked/under cooked rice combo dish. 
Vegetable - some form of proiyal (dry vegetable dish with coconut) - burnt and dried out beyond recognition - it may even have been meat ;) it was that transformed. 
Now to the curries - 
Butter chicken - an item that should really be left to those who actually know the difference between that and regular chicken curry - what we got was some chicken that was shredded (from stirring it too much while cooking I guess) and this of course must have been made by the same cook who made the sambhar - and turned out to be a cross between tomato soup and Sri Lankan style chicken curry - must have started with one and then changed direction I guess - awful!! 
Fish curry - gravy was fine, hardly an pieces with any meat - tons of tail and head, but meat - scarce - as well the few 1 inch cubes I could find were over cooked - like hard cottage cheese - what a waste of fish. 
Deserts: Ice creams were fine - payasaam (Indian pudding) was stale and obviously left over. 

 I had decided not to have a before dinner drink - BIG MISTAKE - Should have ordered a couple of Doubles - that would probably have numbed my tongue and at least allowed me to eat something... 
Enough said I guess - Can someone please post an update IF and WHEN they actually get a good meal at this place!!!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that Madras Palace used to be rather good, especially their buffets. Back in the 2007/2008 time-frame, I lived up in the GTA and used to go there for lunch occasionally, and usually the food was well above average.

Last year, one of those group buy sites had a deal, and I picked up a couple of vouchers for this place. That was my first mistake.

First of all, it was difficult to get them on the phone to ask if there was a buffet on a Saturday or Sunday night - they simply don't seem to answer the phone at all during the day. I had better luck calling them in the evening.

So a month ago, I called on Sunday morning, assuming that I'd get the recording telling me that voice mail hasn't yet been set up by the restaurant (nice going, by the way). To my shock, I got a live human being who said yes, they did have buffet lunch.

So I made a reservation and my friends and I drove there from Mississauga and downtown. Only to get there and see the buffet completely empty. We were the only customers! The server hemmed and hawed and said \"buffet will be ready in 20 minutes\" - so we decided to wait. 5 minutes later, the same server came back to say, \"sorry, we cannot do a buffet today, why don't you order a la carte?\"

Hmm, methinks - there is another branch. So I pulled out my cell phone, called, and asked if there was  a buffet there (this is the Scarborough branch I was calling). And got a mumbled answer that I understood as \"yes\". So we hightailed it out of the Richmond Hill location and over to Scarborough. Much smaller restaurant. At least the people seemed to be enjoying their lunches. Except - you guessed it - the buffet was empty! So I said, \"What's up? I just called\" and they tell me \"Oh, we *just* sent our cooks to the other branch to make the buffet there\". Great. We gave up and went elsewhere for lunch - it was almost 2 by this time and we were not in the mood to play musical restaurants any more.

A week later, we tried again. This time, we made dinner reservations. Again, there was only one car in the parking lot. But the sign said \"Open\". So we went in. The buffet was blah-looking, but we were hungry and decided to go for it anyway. Umm - don't bother. There was plain rice and an egg fried rice. The plain rice was overcooked, the egg fried rice had a distinct taste of spoiled veggies (maybe it'd been sitting too long?) The fish curry was WAY too sour and the mutton curry was terribly oversalted. The food in the vegetarian section all looked as if it had sat there all day. The only saving grace was the masala dosa, which they made fresh and brought to the table - even that was ultra greasy, but at least it was fresh.

Silly me. I thought maybe it was because I'd come in just bad luck and they may normally have better food. So I called another family and invited them to help me use up my last coupon. Again, we could only make it for dinner.

Should I even bother writing the details? Just see the paragraph above - it was a repeat of the previous experience.

If you have a voucher for this place, throw it away or use it at the Scarborough location - like I said, the food there *appeared* to be more authentic and fresh. If you don't have a voucher, save your money and head someplace else - there are dozens of excellent restaurants in Richmond Hill, and you're better off heading to Saravanaa Bhavan or Udupi Palace for authentic South Indian food."}
{"text":"Fair value for your money (I had the dinner buffet).  The butter chicken, mutton curry, and mango shake (mango lassi) were good but I didn't enjoy the dessert."}
{"text":"It was close to our hotel, and I had heard a lot of great things about the Indian food in Toronto. 

Unfortunately, this place looked dismal, the service was non existent, the prices were high by my standards (being from Wisconsin) and the four items I ordered were, subjectively, the worst tasting Indian dishes I have ever eaten."}
{"text":"I'm partial to Madras Palace as the one of the very first South Indian restaurants in East Toronto. I used to come here with my family as a child and it was pretty much the only place to get Dosa in the early '90s. 

The interior hasn't changed at all since, and it does come with it's issues as Kartik K. noted in his review. It's not cozy and the internal temperature might put a damper on a dining experience so come prepared. The service is decent but they are pretty short staffed, and there is usually but one waiter. 

They serve a mean Masala Dosa and Uttapam, but you'll want to steer clear of their Northern dishes or you'll be disappointed. I prefer the Cheese Dosa, requested with Paneer."}
{"text":"I just went there for the lunch buffet.

The selection is severely limited and there isn't much meat in any of the dishes. The waiter was absent most of the time and I had to specifically ask for naan otherwise they don't even make it.

I've had way better Indian food elsewhere and wouldn't recommend anybody going to this place."}
{"text":"we went for the dinner buffet on a sunday night . 

whenever i go to a restaurant, i try to love it . im also searching for an awesome indian restaurant that i can call my favorite indian restaurant . so even if this restaurant wasn't amazing, it shouldve done well in my book . but it didnt . it really really didnt . 

as soon as we were about to be seated, we see a bug on the wall . that shouldve been enough to tell me to just walk away . but i didnt want to be a princess about it, so we stayed . food selection was horrible . looking at the menu and looking at the buffet selection, it made me regret not doing a la carte . food okay, it wasn't horrible . i ended up just eating naan dipped in curries . curries didnt have anything in it, no meat, no veggies .. if you have one of those vouchers like i did, use them for a la carte instead of the buffet ."}
{"text":"This place was one of the worst dining experiences I have ever had. Hopefully they have improved since then but this is what I experienced. 
My visit to the place was a summer ago, when summer actually mean 'hot'. So the first thing we notice when we go in is the temp. Its actually warmer than outside and it was 30C outside. Seems like the AC was broken, all 3 of them. Ok , air conditioning breaks, not completely their fault. It then took about 10-15 minutes for the waiter to acknowledge us. This is completely on them. We finally placed our order. Masala dosa, idli vada (indian fast food). We then waited for 50 minutes for the food. These dishes are usually served up in under 10 minutes at other places. when the food finally arrived it was lukewarm. We saw another group walk out, complaining that they had placed their order an hour ago. Overall the worst dining experience I have ever had."}
{"text":"This has got to be one of my favourite places for Indian food in Scarborough. It's clean, it's cheap, people are friendly, and it's authentic.

I've been here a couple times in different scenarios -- big groups, as a couple, gotten take-out -- and I've never had a negative experience. The food is delicious and staff are willing to help you out with decisions if you're not sure what to order. Last time I came I had a platter of a bunch of different veggie dishes (chana masala, saag paneer, and a veggie curry I think) and I was so full by the end of it that I almost had to unbutton my pants.

One thing that kind of sucks is that my clothes reeeeeked of Indian food after sitting in there for dinner. Maybe I'll stick to take-out, but I won't stop going because the food is THAT good."}
