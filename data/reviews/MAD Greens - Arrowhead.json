{"text":"First time here and it was really good! Staff was friendly and helpful and lunch was perfect as we were looking for a healthier option in the area."}
{"text":"We tried mad greens this afternoon, only cause we received a buy one get one coupon.  First off, the place is clean and bright which was nice. We stood there for a minute or so without being asked if they could help us with anything.  Finally we ordered, but it seemed that there was one blonde employee who was disgusted with her co-workers. She kept rolling her eyes, even with customers around. Food was just ok, but overpriced. We ordered a kids menu box, but the items were very roughly cut. The carrots, which my kid enjoys, were too big for her to eat. Disappointing.  Better customer service would go a long way."}
{"text":"Fantastic place employees are great. Nice place to eat healthy lite meal. The serve wraps and salads. This is a must try."}
{"text":"Great menu choices and a build your own option. Hearty salads, grain bowls, and wraps. Vegetarian options as they have tofu. They also have juice, cane sugar soda bar, and soup!"}
{"text":"We have been going to both the Mad Greens in Scottsdale and Phoenix since they opened, so I am very familiar with the franchise. Their salads are fresh and they offer a large selection of ingredients to choose from. The only reason I bumped down the rating on this particular store was because the lettuce was a bit wilted and I found a hair in my food; yuck!   UPDATE: We decided to try this location again and unfortunately I can't upgrade the stars. The employees were so slow that we waited in a line with two people in front of us for almost 10 minutes. They also did not fill the scoops on the salad toppings so we were stuck paying $10 basically for a bowl of lettuce. When we went to leave, dishes were stacked all over the garbage cans. Total disappointment."}
{"text":"SO....I went in with the mindset of getting a healthy juice...but i walk in, look up, and it was like the heavens opened.... DON QUIXOTE salad!!!  It SCREAMED my name because I LOVE Donny Q!  I have a VERY tolerant wife who allowed me to have a room dedicated to him...but thus I digress....so I ordered it with piri, piri shrimp instead of the chicken and I was INSTANTLY hooked!  The first time I had it it was dowsed in the creamy ginger dressing, but I loved the taste and went back till I perfected the amount I needed...it is in between the lite and medium now I have been back a few times a week....now I think it is time for me to try it with the chicken, branch out, know what I mean?  I have had their Ginger lemonade, WHICH IS AWESOME!!!  But grab it when you can it sells out FAST!  I have had their beet juice as well and that was fantastic as well!  Needless to say I have been finding myself a fixture at this place of late,,,,give it a shot if you havent yet!"}
{"text":"Yes yes yes! Fresh made dressings (like 21 of them!), healthy drink options (um cold-pressed juice!!), and big portions. So many healthy, fresh, delicious options for salads and wraps. I'll be back. Maybe everyday."}
{"text":"It's impossible to get my husband to eat salads without him protesting the entire time, but FINALLY we have found a place where I can get a salad that my husband loves eating too and actually fills him up. Score!  The ingredients are fresh, the food is creative, and the Mad Spice is amazing! I have a lot of food allergies and it's nice to find a place that not only takes my allergies seriously, but has options for salads that doesn't have a million nuts and fruits.  Friendly, clean, and great food; we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Of all the times I visit this restaurant (once a month), 50% of the time they'll not have all the ingredients online to prepare my order, specifically the cilantro lime dressing. It's so annoying to get to the end of what you'd like in your order only to be told that they can't prepare it as requested. Yesterday evening I attempted to visit the store and notice a patron eating in the restaurant with a medium sized, long haired dog laying beneath her seat. I started to voice my concern to the manager but figured it just wasn't worth the trouble. The dog had no service animal vest on distinguishing it as a service animal and the owner had no clear or distinguishable disability so I can only assume it wasn't, making the circumstance a direct violation of the health code.  I just went next door to Even Steven and enjoyed a great sandwich in a clean animal-free environment."}
{"text":"They have a variety of salads, wraps and grain bowls! You can also build your own salad. This place will definitely be somewhere I come often. Definitely recommend for a quick, light lunch or even dinner!"}
{"text":"They have a issue with hair! I've found hair in my salad before and looking through others photos I see they have too! How disgusting. Please do a deep clean, put hair nets and aprons on. Won't be back."}
{"text":"I am very disappointed in what I got here. My lettuce was not fresh, it was more soggy than anything. The chicken was kind of fatty, and the tomatoes and onion looked like they've been sitting out for hours. I don't think it's worth the money, but that's just from my experience. :("}
{"text":"The manager was very rude to the employees. She wasn't happy that there wasn't enough lettuce in my salad and yelled at the poor girl to add more. All that extra lettuce made my salad boring. Might not go back it wasn't anything special."}
{"text":"We went to the soft opening of this place and it is amazing. Great salads and super friendly staff. We will be coming quite often! Edgar Allen Poe is AMAZING and the soda fountain is superb!"}
{"text":"Holy molasses!!! Sooooooo slowwwwwwww 3 people working and no one in there and it was like it was everyone's first day. Complete slow motion good grief!!!"}
{"text":"Newly opened location located on the corner of 75th and Bell Rd.  and next to Smashburger and Cafe Rio with an unnamed location adjacent.  Parking can be challenging especially during lunch rush, but there is plenty of parking behind it.   Location is small, but adequate.  It's clean and looks similar to other Mad Greens locations.  They offer salads, wraps, and juices here.  I love their root beer selection. At the soda fountains, they taste amazing!  I had the Mighty Aphrodite salad which is a seasonal item.  It consisted of:  baby greens, mozzarella, grilled citrus chicken, strawberries, sliced almonds, and shallot tarragon vinaigrette.  Flavors were great together especially with the mozzarella and strawberries combination.  Their dressings here are the stars in my opinion.  Loads of options to choose from and you can also make your own salad.  Adding an extra item costs .75 cents each to a menu salad.  All in all, I'm sad they don't offer paninis here like the other location I've been to.  Salads can get pricey, but it's the quality the makes up for it.  The regular size is more than enough for one person.  Prime location, great tasting food, and not to mention, very clean.  I would totally recommend this place to anyone who wants to try something new or has a profound love of salads like me!  Welcome to Arrowhead, Mad Greens!"}
{"text":"My 3rd time ordering a yummy Athena salad..I'm very pleased as usual with my bowl of green love..I love how fresh and tasty the salad is continuously.. I tried the Beat it juice and I love it as well..."}
{"text":"Really neat healthy alternative from the normal fast food. Similar to a Chipotle setup where you walk in and order your salad, wrap or grain bowl. They have they're own signature salads or you can create your own. Very fresh ingredients and lots of salad dressing options. I've always wanted more healthy fast food options and this is a good fit. Ask for the Mad Spice in your salad - de-lish!"}
{"text":"Visited for the 1st time today, felt like it was completely understaffed. The gal who helped me was clearly overwhelmed, and even though they were not busy it seemed to be a lot for one person. They seemed to be out of a lot of items, although my food was tasty, & the hummus trio was delicious, the salad was soggy after sitting for a short while. I paid almost $20 for a small salad, a few strips of Pita bread & 3 scoops of hummus. I don't think we will go back, but it was not horrible."}
{"text":"Just tried this for the first time and it was great! Everything tasted so fresh (including the chicken) and their handcrafted beverages are awesome!! I tried the Mad Cesar salad (regular) and it was the perfect size! There are so many different options and unlimited toppings for your salad! Definitely coming back! Also, their service is awesome, no wait!"}
{"text":"Went again for a to go order... maybe my boyfriend just has bad luck ordering here lol. I texted him asking what he wanted and he looked at the online menu and wanted an Albert E's BLT. So I ordered it but.... they don't make it at this location. They didn't give a reason why it's not available at this location, but oh well. I ordered their Buddha Bowl and loved it. I'll order that again."}
{"text":"Fresh, healthy, and yummy! It's become a go-to place for us. Drinks are delicious too, and our kids love the kids meals they offer. Nice to have a healthy option in this area!"}
{"text":"I'm usually not one to complain but my experience here was absolutely horrible. There were a couple people in front of us and it took the guy about 5 minutes to finally take our order. After we're done ordering he says \"we'll get to it soon, but it's going to take a while.\" No kidding! He decides to scoop my soup immediately and let it sit there for 20 mins and get cold while we were standing in line. Then, we find out he forgot to even start making our bowls so the guy behind us ended up going in front of us. Another 10 mins pass and finally another girl comes up and has him scoop me another soup because it's obviously cold by now. They finally finish our bowls and then they have to ring us up twice because they couldn't even find the original ticket he made. Overall we were waiting in line for 30 minutes and my second soup was cold once again. Absolutely no organization in this place. Management should be embarrassed. Food was not worth the horrendous service. The guy who cut us in line told us it is like this every time he goes in there. Just embarrassing."}
{"text":"I have been here twice. Only had one thing on the menu (which is the Southwest Bowl, I believe is what is it called) that taste great.  3 stars cuz nobody seems happy at this place. The first time we (wife and I) went was shortly after it opened. Which we chalked up very bodies attitudes to opening stress, being new, still figuring out stuff. No big deal the food was good, so I went back the other day. Food is still really good, attitudes still aren't that great. I'm mean people are nice but not friendly. Like they really hate their job, or whoever is in charge at this place."}
{"text":"Love this place. The food is very good and healthy, the employees are very kind and helpful, easy to get to location, reasonable prices, and it's all around a good place to be! Everyone should try it if they love healthy, affordable food."}
{"text":"I rescued a friend from the MVD and we talked about going for pizza and while she was waiting for me she had looked to see if anything new was close by. She found Mad Greens and asked if I would prefer something healthier knowing I would go for it. The menu the first time can be a bit overwhelming, I think I just picked the first thing I saw that did not have anything in it I didn't like. The Ty Cobb salad and side of vegetable soup were both very good and the salad was very filling. When ordering they will take however long to answer all your questions. And there are Vegan options. The new multi tenant building is where a Chevron station stood until last year."}
{"text":"First off I've been wanting to try this place for months.  I love a good fresh salad.  But I also love to be treated good when i go spend money somewhere.  We were not sure how to order and weren't told.   Also weren't told they were out of avocados or craisins.   There were 3 girls working.    All slower than slow.   And all with the look of hating their life.   All with long hair draping over the ingredients.   So I ordered the mad ceaser it was really good and my husband made his own and he said it was \"ok\".   The service alone will make me not come back.  If this place wants to make it they need to remember they're not the only place in town to make a good salad... but if they keep employees there who make customers feel completely unwelcome, they will not make it.  It's a great idea and could do well but the employees you are paying are ruining your restaurant."}
{"text":"This was our first trip to a Mad Greens. The concept is similar to cafe zupa or fired pie. One thing that was a major flaw tonight is the organization. It was non-existent. The girl that helped us was so sweet and helpful! She was probably the one that seemed like she knew what she was doing.  I actually felt bad she worked in that environment. The other employees working there just seemed to need some direction. The one that seemed to maybe be supervisor or manager was stressed! She would often wonder to the back for a while. How did I know she wondered to the back often? Because we were in line SO long we had the time to see it happen. It probably took 10 minutes from the time we ordered to the time we payed.  I enjoyed my salad. I got the TY Cobb with honey mustard. It was really good. Everything was fresh. I really liked that they ask you questions about your order as you walk the line. \"Salt, pepper, mad spice? Light, medium or heavy dressing? Are all the toppings ok for your salad?\" It was nice.  My husband got the Tokyo bowl. All the ingredients we fresh, but he thought it just lacked flavor. A little bland. He seemed the pears weren't ripe yet.  Good thing for the BOGO coupon. Otherwise we don't feel like it would have been worth it."}
{"text":"Nothing to write home about the food was kind of bland and drinks hard to figure out and some were tasteless. The price more expensive than worth. For my money I'd go to Pita Jungle"}
{"text":"TBH I was pretty skeptical about coming here. I was actually mad about it because my friend convinced me to come here instead of Chik Fil A BUT I'm so glad I did!   I've been looking into healthier options so the push of encouragement definitely helped! And I was completely satisfied!   I would say MadGreens is kinda like a Chipotle or Poke spot. You can make your own salads/bowls/wraps or choose one from the menu. They also have fresh made juices already in bottles.   I ordered the Southwest bowl and the Wake Up juice. Both were to dieeeee for! The bowl had all of my favorite things: spinach, avocado, grilled chicken...  I would definitely come back to try their other menu options!   Southwest bowl  Fat 23g, Carbs 77g, Protein 41g"}
{"text":"I love MAD Greens!! I get the spicy bacon bowl with shrimp instead of the dressing that comes with it I get  the creamy chili cilantro dressing omg so amazing !!!!  So nice to have a fresh and healthy spot to eat in arrowhead. I come here about twice a week to grab lunch or dinner. Even the staff is so friendly and informative of all the items on the menu. I totally recommend everyone to eat here.. it is so nice, light and filling"}
{"text":"The food is very good, but both my husband and I got very sick after eating here. He had a Ty Cobb and I had the Edgar Allen Poe salad. We both ended up with terrible stomach problems by evening. I won't eat here again, it's too bad, because it's really hard to find good salads. I don't know if it's the preservatives on the lettuce or something more sinister, like not washing hands."}
{"text":"If there was an option for a negative star it would be used. We order from here frequently and the least they can do is pick up their phone! How do you get this much hair in a salad!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! They have a good selection of salads and it's all fresh and delicious. I got the \"wake up\" juice and it's was sooooooooo good!!"}
{"text":"Didn't have any pita bread in the store, which is disappointing when your trying to have the hummus. However it turns out the hummus is pretty terrible so maybe that was a good thing."}
{"text":"Mad Greens never disappoints! Always a perfect salad. I had my two children with me and they were so sweet to carry my food to my table and help us get settled. I craved one of their Caesar salads during my entire last pregnancy and went back today to see if it was as good as I remembered and it definitely was. I think it's the citrus chicken. I'm not sure, but it's good!"}
{"text":"This past Thursday night we both went back to the Arrowhead store and had a far better experience. Everything about my wife's  Athena salad, my Don Quixote, and the tomato/ pepper soup were spot on. E.G, not burnt, not hard, not missing:)    I  really didn't want to risk the apples/ pears in the Poe salad again since, pardon my ignorance I don't know what pears are in use but most aren't in season so will wait till later in the year.  Hopefully it remains consistent with this and our first couple of visits.   Still cold, bordering on freezing in the dining area."}
{"text":"I absolutely love mad greens and some days drive 5-10 miles out of my way to get some! However the staff at this location angers me beyond belief. Twice in a row I have experienced awful customer service and it just so happens they mess up my salad everytime.  I would rather drive further to camelback location or scottsdale."}
{"text":"We stopped in yesterday evening for dinner. My husband has eaten at another location and recommended it.   The food was decent. My husband had a salad, which was pretty good. I would return for a quick meal if in the area.  But, my two stars are for the service. There was a young man who helped us (I wish I would have gotten his name!). He was truly happy to be there and was super helpful! What a wonderful asset to this restaurant. Again, I wish I would have gotten his name, the owners/managers should know what a great job he does for you!  There was a young lady, who I am assuming was a manager/lead? What a terrible snooty attitude. She was busy testing temperatures and making notes, which I am sure is her job. But, she could not have made it more clear the 3 times I was at the counter that she was not pleased to be serving us. She was actually short with the kind young man that took our order.   Such a shame that she is representing the restaurant. I truly hope someone reads this and gives her some advice on customer service. She needs to be reminded that there are lots of options when choosing a dinner location. The food is good, but not so good that an attitude makes it worth it."}
{"text":"So I just stopped in here for the first time based in my friends experience. Well I'm not sure I'll ever be back. No other customers in the place but me and I still had to wait to be helped. Two guys at the register doing everything but charging me for my salad. That's very annoying when your in a hurry and have to wait on someone like that. Then I'm asked do you need a bag? No fork no napkins nothing! I got a soggy salad tho for 11$. Yes my salad was soggy just 5 mins of leaving hmm wonder why that is!"}
{"text":"I love MAD Greens--the food is really lit; I recommend it to all. The Anne Oakley wrap is fantastic!   However, the service offered by the afternoon staff--on occasion, is mediocre at best.   I should not make generalizations about the entire team; but if you prefer a less aloof staff--visit after 5:00 PM.  A couple weeks ago--one of the young ladies forgot to add tofu to my salad. Moreover, as she was closing the lid, I stop her to remind her about the ingredient.    Further, since she did not want to remix the combination--she decided to dump the tofu on top (for which most fell off, onto the counter).  I mean maybe she felt the tofu wasn't an essential part to me (who knows).  Nonetheless, today was unusually odd...  They were a bit busy due to a significant online order they were managing.   Also, there was a gentleman in line waiting for his food.   Nevertheless, the young lady behind the counter mentioned it'll be a moment (which I understood); therefore, I asked for a beverage cup as I patiently waited.  After the gentleman's order was completed--the team continued the online purchase.   Unfortunately,  during this time--a new couple walks into the store; and for some odd reason, they were allowed to place their order ahead of mines.  I guess they forgot I was standing there?   However, when they finally realized I was there--the young lady asked if the online order was for me (oddly enough--I never gave her any inclination it was mine when I step into the shop).   After I said no--she continued to serve the couple who entered after me.   Strange...so I just walked out--no food (Anne Oakley), and unhappy; no money spent I'm sure the owner is super thrilled with this one..."}
{"text":"Went here w a friend Friday evening at 5:30.  Wasn't busy yet however they were out of many items including feta cheese which is. Main ingredient for one of their salads.  The worker in the main line of making the salad, who I assume was a supervisor, keep making comments that if an item was empty, it was gone and there was no more for the night.  She kept saying that and blaming it on the morning crew who was lazy and that she couldn't do everything.  She treated the cashier rude when she needed help.  She had an attitude and displayed horrible customer service.  Very disappointed.  What kind of place runs out of some of their main ingredients at dinner time."}
{"text":"First time trying this place today and I don't think I'll be back. Ordered the Buffalo Bill wrap which is buffalo chicken along with lettuce, celery and carrots...according to the menu. The reality was my wrap barely had more than two bites of chicken. I thought I had a vegetarian wrap. For $8.50 I was missing my protein. There are better options out there."}
{"text":"I like this place because of the healthy options.. salads, grain bowls, wraps.. but the caramels, brownies and pink & blueberry sodas get me every time.  My goto is the bacon & shrimp grain bowl.. sub the grilled corn for the cheese.. medium on the siracha dressing .. hits the spot every time.. calorie, carb, protein counts can be found on their online menu.  I've had the wraps on many occasions too.. at Yelp events and at the office.. half of one will fill you up.  At checkout I lose my mind and reach for a tasty dessert treat for later :) .. today i had the caramels (2for $1) the brownies are really good also.  Don't miss out on the Maine Root fountain drinks.. Mexican cola, root beer, pink drink (made from prickly pear), blueberry and lemon lime .. they also have tea.  Plenty of parking and seating. Staff is friendly and helpful if you have any questions"}
{"text":"This was my first time at Mad Greens. I got the Ty Cobb salad because I love blue cheese. I opted for the regular chicken but didn't realize it was shredded instead of cubed like the other chicken choices. It blended in with the other ingredients so it was hard to find it. I got the blue cheese dressing...it was creamy but i didn't see any pieces of blue cheese. They should have some crumbled blue cheese to sprinkle on as well. Otherwise, my salad was very good. I would probably go back again if i was in that area."}
{"text":"First time here and I got the ty Cobb salad to go. I ordered a large and it was really filling I couldn't even finish it. I probably ate a little more than half. It tasted good a little pricey for salad but I guess I can't complain since it came with so much plus it included chicken and avocado which is normally extra. I didn't eat inside but i noticed was clean and cute as I was ordering. I posted how much I had left over.. as you can see it was a lot! I had them put the  dressing on the side so I'll be able to finish it later :)"}
{"text":"New favorite restaurant. The southwest bowl is to die for, Nic got the Mark Twain bowl, which was equally delicious. I even went back for a salad to bring to work the next day, and bought their spice blend that they sell. Highly recommend this place do you are starving and want to stuff your face, but not feel gross after. Or if you are just hungry. Excellent food, excellent service."}
{"text":"3/16/18 530-730  First time and can't see myself coming back. The younger women serving didn't smile once and was very short in trying to help guide me through ordering. There aren't even prices listed on the tv menu. The manager in comparison was spectacular, can't say enough great things about her. Very helpful.   Restaurant was clean and cutlery was full  The food is not that good. Barely any toppings mostly just lettuce or mixed greens. Chicken is pretty dry and a medium amount of dressing couldn't moisten it."}
{"text":"Went to MAD Greens for lunch to go.  The menu was somewhat limited, but realizing that you could \"make your own\" salad made up for that.  The salad itself was pretty good.  The ingredients tasted fresh.  I wish they would have drained the apples more - they made the salad watery.  The \"medium\" amount of dressing was not nearly enough.  When I asked for heavy, they added another small squirt.  The salad was lacking in flavor.  I attribute it to a near complete lack of salt.  After adding a few sprinkles of salt & pepper, it was significantly better.  The price of a salad and a drink was a bit high ($14).  The highlight of the meal was the soda - it uses natural cane sugar.  The root beer was amazing."}
{"text":"With the New Year and all, we are trying eat healthy and lite.  So, we have been to Mad Green in Arrowhead a few times and we both noticed a decline in food quality on our last visit.  My wife had the Southwestern Bowl and I had the Cobb Salad.  The ingredients in both dishes were clearly left over from days earlier.  Lettuce was old, short on Romaine, and the some of the rice in the bowl was actually hard like it had been left out.  The chicken was not hot.  On top of this, it was expensive.  As we left, I wondered if Mad Green was falling on hard times or having trouble hiring qualified people."}
{"text":"Siam I Am salad with piri piri shrimp is delicious. Garlic humus is very thick and tasty but could use more salt. Very good and healthy addition to Bell Rd fast food options."}
{"text":"So sad they got rid of the Doc Holiday salad! That was my favorite and I crave it on a regular basis. I guess it wasn't a top seller so they axed it along with oranges, grapes, and the dressing. I guess I'll have to settle for the Siam I am salad from now on. Boo!  At least their iced teas are awesome! They have this mint herbal tea that is out of this world! I like to get the black tea and then put a little of the mint tea in it...it's so refreshing.   As far as this location goes, it's VERY clean, the staff is super friendly, and the produce is crisp and fresh. Keep up the great work guys!"}
{"text":"This place is GOOOOOD! As in fresh, healthy, great tasting food. Wonderful variety of choices for their salads. Love the beverage selection, their root beer is amazing! The young gentleman who helped me was so kind, friendly and professional, always a plus. This was my first visit and I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Food - The freshness of the ingredients is this place's shining star.  I enjoyed a \"Don Quixote\" salad with double shrimp protein.  I opted for the low fat red pepper dressing to save a few calories. The salad as just that, it is a salad albeit a really big salad. The black tea had me going back for a 4th glass; really one of the best iced teas I've ever tasted in the gazillion gallons of tea I've drank in my life.  Service - well, there's not much to be expected.  It is a cafeteria style order and find your own utensils and clean your own table kind of joint.  It was obvious the staff didn't seem too invested in being efficient but I chalked that up to the recent opening.  Surely over time they will be more thoughtful of how long a customer is waiting to have a salad tossed.  A process efficiency expert would have a field day.  Perhaps they need one.  Atmosphere - Really cool vibe.  Definitely reminds me of an organic farm picnic. The setup closely resembles a Subway or Chipotle.    So why 3 stars?  The prices are ridiculous!  $20 BUCKS for ONE salad and ONE drink!  Yeah, I know I doubled the protein ($3.99 extra) but seriously, this is a self-service salad joint not fine dining.   The prices will almost certainly keep me from ever going back.    But that iced tea..."}
{"text":"I love all the food here and the soda choices are great. Their menu is pretty extensive and you can make your own too. The menu consists of wraps and salads. You can substitute greens with pasta. I know this is really random but they sell caramels at the cash register. They are so amazing!!!!! Better than ones I have had at high end bakeries and candy stores. Yummy! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Build your own salad or just order off menu. The e are a lot of places doing this. Pizza, burritos, now salads.   First trip was enough to have me planning on another trip.  This trip I had them make a custom. While eating it I discovered one on the menu I will try next time. I ordered the large size and my wife got a smaller one.  Next visit I will do the smaller one as the large is to much for me to eat at a setting.  The hey do have limited seating. We did not have a problem getting a seat but I can imagine during peek times it could be a challenge. Ear it here or take it home. There were several people doing take out.  Everyone was smiling, courteous, helpful."}
