{"text":"Came across this hidden gem on uber eats initially but now I'm a regular! This place really hits the spot and gets bonus marks for being open late on the weekends when you really have a craving after going out. I've ordered the Philly cheesesteak sandwich, the ultimate Philly cheesesteak sandwich (mac and cheese inside the sandwich) and the ultimate MELTwich, which is a burger in between 2 grilled cheese sandwiches...yes... you read that correctly.  The poutine is also worth the price of admission (love the gravy) but the real star of the show are the milkshakes! The chocolate milk shake is 9/10....salted caramel is 12/10!! Too good. They have plenty others but I highly recommend either of these 2. The prices are also reasonable. Your search is over. This is your new late night spot! 

Food: 5/5

{"text":"This is my first time ordering from meltwich food. I ordered the grill cheese sandwich,tater tots, chicken strips and brownies. The tater tots were amazing. The grilled cheese was not so great the chicken strips were okay and the brownies were good as well. Except for the tater tots I won't be ordering from this place anytime soon"}
{"text":"Ordered through JustEat- I asked for garlic mayo on my burger and it was plain mayo, which ended up helping out the over salty burger :/
The poutine, I could literally count 7 cheese curds on a regular size but it was drenched (overly) with gravy, which made that too salty also. I checked to see if the cheese was layered and it was not.
So not really satisfied with the overly salty, badly prepared food!"}
{"text":"Saw this place come up on SkipTheDishes and decided to check it out in person for lunch.  We shared the Mac Attack grilled cheese and I had the Tomato Bisque. Both were great, as was the chocolate milk shake."}
{"text":"Went to Meltwich for take out this evening.  Driven by it many times, not sure why I waited to long !!

I was ordering for two people.   Ordered their standard burger with cheese and all the toppings.   Ordered their classic Philly Cheese.  Sides were tater tots and Mac n Cheese. 

Amazing.  The burger was great.  Fresh toppings, quality beef, great toppings.  Loved the pickles on it. 

The Philly as great.  A legit Philly cheesesteak should be on a long sub shaped bun, not round, but regardless it was amazing !  The bun used was perfect, legit all the way along with the caramelized onions and saut√©ed mushrooms... American Cheese too !  Loved it. 

Tater tots are hard to come by as a side.  They were very good however next time I will eat there so they stay crispy and not get steamed up on the drive home. 

Mac n Cheese? Wonderful.  Fresh. As a side it's often just scooped out of a bin and plopped into a container.  This was creamy and fresh 

Meltwich Queensway definitely met my expectations and then some.   It really hit the spot for a very picky foodie (appreciate anything between fast food, casual dining to Michelin rated restaurants).   

Will definitely be back !!"}
{"text":"This is definitely as good as it gets!

Went with two people and ordered the classic grilled cheese along with three other melts (see pics). Every single one of them was amazing.

The bread was fresh, the cheese was really good quality, and the other ingredients were also top notch.

The place itself is very clean and spotless. Ambience is nice - has a very modern vibe to it. The owners are insanely friendly and nice.

Overall, I would recommend this place in a heartbeat if you're looking for a solid sandwich (and maybe a beer or two to go along with it)."}
