{"text":"After a rough morning a good lunch was in order and that I found at Blue Sky. Me, my wife, and my cousin  I was blowin away at how delicious the food was, I ordered a Philly Cheese Steak Supreme and so did my cousin and OMG is had me wanting more even though I was full. My cousin (who is pregnant atm) said that she was full and said she couldn't help herself it was good she had to keep eating. She said it must be the baby telling me he likes blue sky lol.   So if your in the area I highly recommond stopping thru, dont know about the latenights but great during the day, and dont be fooled like I was by the look, the food is good."}
{"text":"Always good with reasonable prices. The staff are pretty friendly with only the odd exception. Very fluffy omelets! They also have a banquet area that can apparently be reserved for private use."}
{"text":"I agree with Hannah: Blue Sky is the greasy-spoon of all greasy-spoons.  Perfect for just about any moment, but heavenly when you're drunk or hungover (perhaps that's why they call it Blue Sky).  I love coming back here when we visit Amherst, it's always a good time and the waitresses are amazingly tolerant of late night drunkards. The breakfast sandwich is to die for and the bomb is exactly that- it will wreck you. But you'll love every minute of it.   They will definitely be seeing me again!"}
{"text":"To start off I will say that the food is usually quite good and the service is friendly and competent...usually!  On this night however, the food was abysmal and the service was entirely forgetable.  My wifes 'Blue Sky Salad' said \"mixed greens\" but was actually large, mostly inedible chunks of wilted (and somewhat brown around the edges!) iceberg lettuce.  My daughters chicken parmesean sandwich, whilw quite large was deep fryer burnt.  The french onion soup was amazig as usual.  The server forgot my wifes order and had to come back to get it...i ordered the chicken philly supreme...what i got was the philly cheesesteak supreme.  The server said she only heard philly supreme not the chicken part.  To top it off the server returned and started to clear the table without asking...she took some of our food to throw away!!  Sadly this place is usually much better...this was a bad night.  Probably wont return for another..."}
{"text":"Food is great and portions are generous . Been to both restaurants (Amherst & Elyria) and food and service is always great. Must try The Bomb!"}
{"text":"We came here because we knew it would be open for a late dinner, but the food is good enough to hold its own. It was a welcome surprise.  Unfortunately, the first thing with which we were greeted as we sat down to choose our courses is a poetic implication that we should bow our heads and thank God via prayer for our meal. It's printed on the front of every menu. I'm not joking. I don't think they realize how this evangelizing can be offensive to anyone of an other-than-Abrahamic faith; atheists and agnostics; and especially any Christian who takes Jesus' advice about refraining from prayer in public as the word of... you know... God.  So, minus one star for abruptly bringing up this old theological debate before we've had our food for thought. They might as well shove a Chick Tract in our faces (I write this because often other Christians find them unpleasant and unwelcome, also.).  Despite their metaphysics, their tangible food was quite good. Our first course was a delightful cole slaw. It seemed to be made with less vinegar and more mayonaisse than typical slaw. It also had chunks of tart apple. This made it taste very fresh and creamy with enough citrus to wake it up. I would confidently bet that this is a house-made dish; but, if it's not, then every other restaurant is ordering their cole slaw from the wrong supplier. It was delicious.  Next, I ordered a \"Turkey Bacon\" wrap. It arrived sans bacon, but that may have been a communication error on my part. I didn't complain, so it wasn't rectified. The wrap was just badly clumped turkey cold cuts, a small amount of diced tomato, and some lettuce. It felt like it was missing some sort of dressing --- either acidic, spicy, or both --- to make it kick.  The fries with which our meals came were excellent. They were textured polygons of crispiness which served as vessels for a creamy potato filling. They had just the right amount of salt and oil. I really enjoyed them.  I would not hesitate to return. Good eats."}
{"text":"You cannot beat the service, food quality and price. I live in Atlanta and have eaten at some of the best restaurants in the country and will make sure I come back Here when I'm in town!"}
{"text":"I've had it with Blue Sky! I work nearby and sometimes order lunch from this restaurant. Or should I say i USED TO order lunch from this restaurant. The last two times I arrived to pick up my order I was ignored by the checkout girl so that she could ring out customers who had eaten in the store. It was busy so I didn't make a big deal about it. However, today was the last straw! I ordered my lunch, arrived to pick it up, I was next in line when three people from the dining room showed up at the counter. The girl at the counter took payment from a woman standing behind me, after completing that transaction she looked me square in the eyes, then proceeded to take payment from another dining room customer behind me. I am disgusted with the service and will never frequent this establishment again. Upon leaving and explaining this to a co-worker, one of my stores customers interjected to let me knkow that this is not anything new for Blue Sky. I emplore you to look elsewhere for your breakfast/lunch/dinner dining needs. The service was not only slow and discourteous but also lacks customer appreciation. All I can say is that I am very disappointed and will be encouraging others to avoid this place of business as I most efinitely will avoid it as well."}
{"text":"The girls are always super friendly the food is always fresh and hot I have never had a bad experience in this restaurant we eat there maybe once or twice a week."}
{"text":"I love blue sky. Used to be a regular when I worked 3rd shift. I would rather come here late at nite then go to Denny's because there isn't as many annoying drunks and druggies roaming the place. I would like to think of blue sky as an all nighter diner for the classier people of Elyria/Amherst. They have great food too!"}
{"text":"This place is where our family goes for an amazing meal for whatever your hungry for!  You can't go wrong here!  The food, service, and prices are amazing!  The only down fall is the bathrooms...they definitely need some tlc!  But honestly, it's not enough to detour us from our favorite family restaurant!"}
{"text":"Decent place to grab a cheap meal 24 hours a day, the food may not taste perfect but the price is right"}
{"text":"We have always loved eating here. We met my parents here regularly to drop my daughter off so they could watch her. We just ate there last week and my mother was halfway through her fruit plate when she noticed 2 hairs on her fruit. They were definately not hers. We mentioned to the waitress about this. My mom asked for a to-go container with some new fruit as we were in a hurry. After 10 minutes we finally got the container. When my mom opened the container she found two more hairs. We told the waitress who just shook her head and returned to the kitchen. We had to get going so we went to pay and we told the cashier about what happened who just said oh ok. My dad said he wanted her meal taken off his bill as she didn't even get to finish her meal. They did take it off. After we left my mother called and spoke with the manager who didn't apologize, but said they were cutting up fresh fruit. We were not about to turn around to go back. I doubt we return, which is a shame. It may not have been as bad if the staff and managers would have apologized and rectified the situation."}
{"text":"Just ate here for the first time with my grandparents today. Absolutely loved it! Great prices and great food, also I appreciated our waitress being patient with my grandparent's requests :) Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My family and I love Blue sky. We have been going there since day 1. The family atmosphere is the best. The servers are great & know us by our orders. It's clean & the food is good and hardy. The price cannot be beat."}
{"text":"The food is mediocre, at best. The chicken noodle soup, and the minestrone were both very salty and obviously not homemade. The vegetables are usually soggy (green beans, in my case) - apparently from a can. I've eaten here several times, and have been disappointed each time.   The best thing going for it are the desserts, which I have to admit are fabulous - but, the coffee wasn't hot.. I would stop by again for dessert, but I wouldn't eat dinner here"}
{"text":"A solid 4-star breakfast.  Huge portions, great prices, friendly service, very clean.    I ordered the \"Blue Sky\" omelette (Onion, Green Pepper, Tomato, Mushroom, Ham, Sausage, Bacon, American and Swiss Cheese).  As you can imagine, it was stuffed to overflowing and full of all of the greatness those ingredients imply.  The home fries and rye toast were also spot on.  The boy got a plate with eggs, sausage and French toast.  5 minutes later, his plate was empty and he was digging into my potatoes.   Hopefully, the stitches on the back of his hand from me stabbing him with a fork won't leave a scar...    If you're a local, it's a no-brainer.  If you're hungry and passing through on the turnpike, it's worth a 10-minute detour to get there.    Better coffee would go a long way towards earning that 5th star.  If I ever get back there for lunch or dinner, we'll let you know how that goes."}
{"text":"We were *so* excited to find a late-night eatery. This place was AWFUL - from the service to the food. Mozzarella sticks w no mozzarella inside?!?! That's become a running joke for us. Did I make the waiter aware? Yes. he shrugged, \"Uh-sorry.\" When paying the cashier asked if everything was ok. I said No, not really. She looked like a deer in headlights and said, \"oh...sorry\". No one offered to refund the cheese-less mozzarella sticks. The other food was just ok at absolute best. We went once and will never go back - ever."}
{"text":"The prices are basically average for a restaurant like this. For the meal that I had and the others I sampled I'd say its a pretty decent place. I expected more flavor from the philly steak supreme but it lacked in that respect. The portions are of decent size, nothing wrong with that. Overall I'd give it a 4 star rating and I'll be sure to give an update when I try the ribs or steak! I did enjoy the strawberry cheese cake as well."}
{"text":"For the portion size that you get, you really can't beat Blue Sky. Prices are definitely reasonable and the quality of food is excellent."}
{"text":"Very nice diner. Good ambiance and down to earth, attentive staff. Had  a very good omlette with sizable chunks of bacon, sausage, and ham. They don't skimp on the ingredients.  The corned beef hash was some of the best I have tasted, served with well cooked scrambled eggs. The coffee was very nice. You will be well served and full for a decent price."}
{"text":"Stopped in almost at closing time and they had no problem serving us.  Food was excellent and the place was spotless.  Service was also very good.  Kids portions were not small either.  Everyone had plenty to eat and took home leftovers.  We will return!"}
{"text":"I've never had a bad meal here; their portions are generous whether you go for breakfast, lunch or late night.  Service is good, sometimes too attentive, but better that than being ignored while you sit."}
{"text":"I took a group of seniors 14 of them their for lunch today the service was wonderful one young guy came out in the rain and helped us in held the door for everyone . Everyone in our group enjoyed their meals prices were good our server was very nice and attentive . Danielle even came out to the bus and cashed out one of the group who forgot to pay she was so sweet and kind we all had a great time and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Very good food and large portions. The chicken part sandwich is top notch.  Coupled with fries and soup, you have a solid meal that will carry you through dinner.   They have great desserts too but always a take home item."}
{"text":"My wife and I are lunch there today. I had a Reuben Panini & my wife had a Chicken Ranch Wrap. Both were delicious and the portions were very, very generous.   The service was excellent."}
{"text":"Food was excellent. Portions were huge.  Their quesadilla's are huge.  They were extremely accommodating to special diets (vegetarian and gastric bypass diets). The only critique is that they didn't have a senior menu on the weekend, only week days.  Atmosphere was casual."}
{"text":"Great service, clean restrooms, good food. Lots of food for the price and good quality.  Stuffed pepper soup was delicious, I could of had a bowl as a meal!  Salad was a nice mix with dressing served on the side!  Hubby had the chicken soup which be enjoyed. I had the breaded pork chops that came out crisp and tender. Hubby got the pot roast and it was tender and delicious.  I can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE service & worst manager ever! I'm a Lorain native & was in town for Thanksgiving. Our family united one last time for breakfast at Blue Sky only to be disappointed by the lack luster service & non-responsive manager. We had a party of 7 & waited over 40 minutes for food that wasn't hot & was overlooked as a party double our size & who arrived after us were served first. The manager was informed, did not attend to the matter & was not apologetic. This was my first & last visit. I will not financially support this business that did not provide professional service to me & my family. I do not fault the waiter but the worst manager who did not hold her team accountable or apologize. And I gladly welcome Blue Sky to contact me & extend a well-deserved apology."}
{"text":"Good food but it is typically crowded on weekend nights. You definitely get your moneys worth here."}
{"text":"If you're up at 3AM and your usual selection of Denny's, Waffle House, and Truck stop food aren't doing it any more, you should consider taking a trip over to the Blue Sky in Amherst.  While their overnight menu isn't as feature-packed as their daytime menu, I'm usually always impressed with the service, the food, and the portion size.  If you're lucky enough to show up when Chicken Paprikash is on the special, I'd highly recommend getting that -- it's an amazing dish."}
{"text":"Ok so I do not enjoy giving bad reviews, so I'll try to put a positive spin on this. The food was wonderful we all enjoyed our food. It ends there. Yes it was busy. I didn't mind the wait at the door, but seriously 50 minutes for breakfast after your sat at the table is ridiculously long. However even that was tolerable.  This place is filthy, the bathrooms are horrible, not just in a \"busy\" needs tidy up way. But dirty in a ,Do they ever pay attention to the corners and under the sinks?  The windows, and doors are filthy. The carpet is filthy. The tables and chairs were horrible and the I didn't even wanna touch the salt  and pepper shakers. Makes us wonder what the kitchen looked like!"}
{"text":"Traveling through to Niagara from Port Clinton and needed breakfast so stopped here at Blue Sky. Monday morning busy but service was fast, food was good, and the price was decent. May never be back (from Oregon) but I would highly recommend this place to anyone in the area who has not given it a try."}
{"text":"The aromas from the kitchen cooking homemade foods greets you at the door.....  In Lorain County, this locally-owned casual family diner has two (2) locations, just off I-90, north on Route 58 at 917 N Leavitt Road in Amherst, & this location just east of Route 57 in Elyria.  I've grown up with Blue Sky Restaurants.  You might think that I'm biased, but I'm not.  I was never a big fan of the Amherst location.  However, my new appreciation for the Elyria spot has me curious to give Amherst another try.  Both locations have plenty of parking.  First, the meals are generous.  The cold sides are always fresh; I usually go with a salad.  The hot sides are great, especially the cream of potato soup, so delish.  The dish-ware lends itself to perfect serving sizes, not too little, & if you eat slowly, enjoy, then you may savor each bite or even save some for later.  We tried the eggplant parmigiana, which was tasty thick noodles with breaded medallions.  We agreed that it was better than most but maybe needed more mozzarella cheese.  We also ordered the chicken paprikash, which was homemade with rich, flavorful amber sauce that just looked yummy & pieces of real chicken breast cooked to perfection with great twisted spaetzle.  The presentation of the food was so appetizing that we dove in & started eating before we had a chance to snap a couple photos of the deliciousness before us.   Marissa's service was on point. She was great at outlining the daily specials, soupe du jour, & pie/dessert selections.  Prices are definitely reasonable for the entrees provided with cold & warm sides.  She checked in on us often, & the food was timely delivered with the right temperature.  Many pros, we could not come up with any cons.  Full disclosure, we have tried breakfast, lunch, & dinner at this location, & we have yet to be disappointed, a return visit is highly probable - with pictures promised next time!"}
{"text":"Wow mom and pop dining at its finest - home cooked meals that taste great - the food was great the service excellent the prices well I'm pretty tight so free would be much better - but then that wouldn't fly would it - I was ok with the prices"}
{"text":"The Amherst location is about a million times better. There's only one good server here. The rest will leave you without beverages for the vast majority of your meal. The portion sizes have gotten really skimpy. For example \"The Bomb\" use to come with two biscuits and now they just split one biscuit in half. I know that it sounds trivial, but I find small things like this important when I'm spending my hard earned money. Try the Amherst location. You'll see a huge difference."}
{"text":"For what it is, it's good. I recommend it. Had the liver and onions as I alleys do when I go to a diner type place like this. It was delicious, cooked nicely and tender. The chicken noodle soup was not the greatest. I would come back!"}
{"text":"It occurs to me after ordering it that I don't actually know what paprikash is, other than there is the possibility of there being too much pepper in it.  Ultimately it was fine, which annoyingly denied me the opportunity of telling the waiter.  Darn this perfectly adequate eating place!"}
{"text":"Every time I come here the staff is extremely pleasant. There is usually a line/wait to be seated, which shows how much people love the place. The portions are huge and the French onion soup is to die for.   If you order breakfast, i recommend the pancakes."}
{"text":"Perhaps the only patch of blue sky in all Ohio. Ideal escape for any cloudy day! I had \"the bomb\" a special of biscuits, eggs, and home fries all smothered with a massive amount of gravy. Everything was concealed beneath a blanket of sausage gravy so thick it took a concerted effort to reach the top layer of biscuit. Each discovery of the next element was a personal triumph.   Waitress ate rainbows for breakfast and they flowed out of her effulgent being to surround us in a cloud of bliss. You might not feel cute, but the continual affirmation from the waitress: \"you're SO CUTE!\" eventually gives you a cute high."}
{"text":"We go to the Amherst restaurant, good Home style food.  Never disappointed!  Amy is the Best!! Get Hot Dogs on the menu quick!!!! LOL!!"}
{"text":"Friendly, always open, great variety of tasty food. Best French onion soup I've ever had."}
{"text":"Yiddish sandwich, Reuben on potato cakes, was a good idea.   Different is good this time.   The sandwich is not overflowing with corned beef but worth the price. Comes with a thousand island on The side  The fries are nice and crispy.  French onion soup was loaded with cheese and crock is large.   Almost it's own meal."}
{"text":"I have been here about a dozen times. The food is pretty inconsistent. I have had some decent meals, but the last time I went I had a chicken wrap that was inedible. Usually the food is pretty average. The price is low and the portions are massive so everyone in the suburbs thinks this place is great. Really it's a below average greasy spoon."}
{"text":"It's a nice place, food is good, the chicken noodle soup is great, the philly cheese sandwich is good, my mom enjoyed her Ruben, my daughter loves the child's portion (it's big), it's really nice!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for dinner and thoroughly enjoyed it! I've never had deep-fried mashed potatoes but they were heavenly. His liver and onions were tender and perfectly cooked and my country fried steak was fork tender!"}
{"text":"Knowing I would be in Amherst I checked yelp for lunch suggestions. Blue Sky reviews were highly favorable with the few negative from whiners who perceived grand injustice rather than bad food. Since I rarely feel mortally abused by any servers I brought my friend to Blue Sky.   We found a bright, cheery, clean room offering diner food with pleasant and efficient servers. I was so damn happy that Blue actually had hot turkey sandwiches with real roast turkey.  My companion had the Philly cheese steak  and said it was quite good. At the next table all three had Rubens stating that is all they ever order at Blue.  Prices were average to low. Food is average to better. Ordering turkey and getting turkey takes them up one star above average for me."}
{"text":"Went for Sunday lunch, had to wait about 15 minutes which was not bad because it was full with more people coming in behind us.  Took our orders and received our food in a reasonable time, didn't get the beverages that we ordered.  Large portions at very reasonable prices.  Daughter had the breakfast sandwich special, wife had the Chicken Philly - they said they were good.  I had the chicken salad wrap, it was absolutely tasteless.  I wish that I had been able to get some hot sauce for it but the waitress never checked back with us until she dropped the check off."}
{"text":"When in Elyria, where there aren't many if any gourmet or ethnic dining options, a family style restaurant will have to do. Drove by this place on my way to somewhere else that ended up being closed, so I turned around, Yelped it,  and tried it.    I had the all American burger and it was a pretty standard burger but not too bad. All the sandwiches come with fries and a cold side or cup of soup. I tried the stuffed pepper soup. My parents each got an omelette and they enjoyed their meals.    We had good service and everyone was very friendly and helpful. Prices were very reasonable, my burger and all the sides was $6.99! The other sandwiches ranged from $6.99 to $9.99 and other entrees weren't much more than that either."}
{"text":"Blue Sky is one of my family's favorite restaurants. The food is delicious and the service is good.   Their menu reminds me of Amish, country, \"home cooked\", kind of thing.  To say their portions are generous would be a huge understatement. Let's put it this way, their Roast Beef Dinner is roughly a side of beef, I think. Plan to take some home or share with someone. The large portion size makes them a great value. Their menu prices aren't the lowest that I've seen, but considering how much food that you get, it's more than worth it.   Their desserts are out of this world good! The only problem is, they give you so much food that you will rarely have enough room for dessert. My wife and I have had just dessert and coffee a few times so that we could actually try them. They have various cakes, pies, and cheesecakes, as well as bread pudding. I don't remember what they call it but the super rich, quadruple chocolate cake is decadent beyond belief!  All of the servers that we have ever had were very polite and efficient. Food comes from the kitchen reasonably fast. I ordered a steak medium-rare once and it came well-done. I complained and they apologized and promptly made me another one that was cooked perfectly.   The restaurant and restrooms are clean. We were at a table once where whenever someone came through the kitchen doors we had a pretty good view of the kitchen. It looked very clean and organized for a busy restaurant kitchen."}
{"text":"Everything i had here was good you really cant go wrong..the french onion soup is amazing! And the double decker turkey sandwich is huge and very good! Waitresses are friendly. Will absolutely be returning."}
{"text":"Top 5 best breakfast place I've been to! Eggs were extremely flavorful, not rubbery like other places. Portions were also huge and coffee was strong. To top it off, prices were dirt cheap. They could easily charge double for this food. Highly recommend over any national chain restaurant!"}
{"text":"Very good food and they don't make you wait too long. Service is amazing, always get correct food and waitress are very nice."}
{"text":"I make sure to come here every time I travel home from NC. They give you plenty of food that tastes very good and it's very economical. The servers are very attentive, especially with the coffee. They're super nice and genuinely act like they care about their guests. It has a legitimate cafe feeling and it's something I look forward to every time I come home."}
{"text":"Blue Sky is one of the best local restaurants overall. Consistently good food and service at a great price.  I had a stuffed pork chop, baked sweet potato, Sicilian blend vegetables, house salad, soup, and roll for $8.99."}
{"text":"These diners are all the same. The cheapest lowest quality food they can find. No exception here. The sausage gravy taste straight out of a can. Not to mention it was warm at best. Coffee had a odd sour taste. I don't think it was real butter on my toast either."}
{"text":"On a dreary dark grey day, we visited Blue Sky.  Just as imagined, it's a family style diner with lots of clients eating huge plates and endless cups of coffee.  We were seated immediately and a cheery waitress came around within a minute with hot coffee and a smile.  The cloud murals on the wall set this slightly apart  from other diner joints (Blue Sky is open 24-7),  the food is just as a bit better than others we've visited.    Leave your diet at home.  Eggs, potatoes and toast are buttery and yummy as anything covered in butter will be, but they're also cooked perfectly.  The Belgian waffle was light and airy and the pancakes were among the best I've eaten.  Didn't want to put syrup on them!  Can see why it has a following.  Skip the nearby Denny's and head to Blue Sky next time you're drunk at 3 am."}
{"text":"The waitress was nice.....  but new.   Due to dietary restrictions / no grains, they were unwilling to substitute Apple sauce for the soup.   We ordered the broiled walleye and the liver and onions, both were over cooked and very dry.    We asked if they hired a new chef because they were not as crowded and the food quality definitely changed.   They said no.    When letting the woman at the register know to maybe keep an eye on the chef in the future, she seemed pretty closed off to the advice.   We may try going back, but we will wait awhile."}
{"text":"Stopped in because it had pretty good reviews. Not sure why though! The philly steak sandwich was pretty bad. The green peppers tasted old and little to no meat. The fries were nothing great!  I am sure they get the lowest quality food they can, and serve it. The chicken club was blah and left a bad taste.  Took home the leftovers to feed ti the raccoons...  Nothing really to rave about. The cakes looked awesome though. They definitely don't make them there."}
{"text":"Been here many times and it is very consistent.  Ask for Sarah. She is a great server.  Cares about her customers.   Breakfast is good.   Lunch is great. All in all very clean. Great prices.   Bathrooms clean. Deserts are killer.     Have the homemade dinners."}
{"text":"We went through the list of restaurant candidates, even though this one is a littler farther than the rest, we thought this one is worth a try.  It started with Great Customer Service, she was polite enough to come borrow our black pepper shaker, they're cleaning them, so there's only a few on each tables.  If they're cleaning the pepper shakers, what does that tell you about a restaurant? Others, just wipe them clean, or almost empty!  In our book, this server already have earned her 5 stars!  We wanted the Senior Menu, and we've already picked what we wanted. While taking our orders, she asked us?  This or that, this or that, and we didn't know we're getting MORE, and the price was so reasonable, but even though it was the smaller version of the regular dinner, we were full!  AND we didn't, absolutely didn't have any more room for the delicious, yummy desserts, that greeted us when we entered the restaurant!  I still have enough for another meal, my shrimp & fries, which was both good!  Our chicken noodle soup, has two types of noodle, but really have to use a microscope to find bits of pieces of chicken!  I'm glad they didn't serve alcoholic beverage!  I just didn't want hubby have anymore, tonight's the night off!  He was THAT TIRED!  He actually drove straight, when both lanes were turning LEFT, and almost got us both killed in the middle of Elyria, and this is NO JOKE!"}
{"text":"Blue Sky has such a diverse menu, it's really nice to have such a huge selection, from breakfast, lunch, dinner & after hours! I had their Philly Steak supreme sandwich. It came with generous amount of great fries & the best coleslaw!! Our server, Violeta was so friendly and attentive. Great hospitality! Which is half the experience of dining out. I highly recommend Blue Sky, and it's quite easy on the purse strings... Lol! #satisfiedcustomer"}
{"text":"OMG. I am lucky we used a gift certificate we won for this place as I would have hated to use my own money. I had $25 to spend so I got a steak. They price the steak like at an Outback but it is only about 25 percent as good. My brother just wanted a burger. Could have got the same quality as McDonalds. Really, you can cook better meat at home by far. This is a dive. Do not waste your time or money going there."}
{"text":"Perfect any time of day-- breakfast, lunch, dinner, late night! The portion sizes are pretty decent and the staff is friendly. The menu is pretty extensive, there is something for everyone. Sandwiches, soups, omelettes, country style dinners-- I could go on and on. The French Onion soup is SO cheesy! The omelettes are huge-- the Greek is to die for! The sandwiches are piled high with meat, cheese and toppings. Blue Sky is definitely a family friendly, affordable and convenient place to eat!"}
{"text":"Late night brinner is pretty solid. Had a good selection of breakfast food including an eggg bacon n che croissant. the egg we felt should have been a fried egg or omelette style alone without the bacon folded in. Bacon was a bit burnt and did not have the option to remove it as it was intermingled betwixt the egg. Pancakes, biscuits and gravy was bomb, as was hashies and bacon on plate. Bathrooms and restaurant was overall filthy but the food was good. \"God\" made dirt and dirt don't hurt, right??people watching is primo, especially late night! Good prices, what more does one expect from at 24 hour diner in Lorain County? Take care."}
{"text":"Great desserts. Breakfast is good. Priced accordingly for the type of meal that you get. It is open 24 hours. Great service and everyone that works there is very friendly. I just wish that they had better tasting coffee. Restrooms could use a little better cleaning as well."}
{"text":"Decent enough experience at this restaurant. Service was pretty good and the food was ok. Main dish was good, but some of the sides tasted like cheap grocery store stuff (Mashed potatoes & stuffing). I've had better food in similar style restaurants.  Overall it was an alright place to eat at and I'm sure i'll go back sometime in the future, but i won't be in a hurry to come back though."}
{"text":"The food is very good with nice size portions. The menu has lots to pick from. It's a great family restaurant."}
{"text":"Awesome place for breakfast, fast seating, great service...If i had to complain about anything...small coffee cups..."}
{"text":"No other place gives you so much food.  You get a salad and soup with every meal.    The staff is also really nice and friendly.   The food is good also and if you are not happy just ask they will work to make you happy."}
{"text":"Food quality is good and there's always plenty you never leave hungry. Staffing is friendly courteous and aim to please. Cleanliness is average they could do better and that's the reason I only gave them four. stars. Restaurant pricing is very reasonable."}
{"text":"A great place for the post-bar crowd.  A cool, greasy spoon for those who need to eat some breakfast at 3 a.m. or whenever.  Granted, you'll have too put up with some of the usual late night banter, but the food is inexpensive and the portions filling.    If you don't know where to go, here it is."}
{"text":"Four of us stopped for dinner and had a fairly decent meal.  For the price, you get a lot of food.   Soup, cold side and entree.  Service was very good and all food came out hot.   I had the chicken parmigiana with a side of spaghetti, salad and chicken noodle soup.   The soup was tasty and had plenty of noodles and chicken.   The chicken parm was the fried version, but tender and good.    My husband had the pork chops which were also fried and tender and juicy.   He mistakenly got the stuffing and it was sooooooo salty he couldn't eat it at all.   Our niece had the Amish pot roast and mashed potatoes.  Although tasty, there was loads of fat in the pot roast.   She ended up not eating very much.  Our great niece had a strip steak and found fat on almost half the steak, so there wasn't a very big portion once we cut off all the fat.  Her fries were her favorite, and she is a huge steak fan.  It's a family restaurant,  not a fine dining establishment, so some of this is expected.   Prices are affordable and the environment is pleasant.   The menu is huge, so make your choice wisely."}
{"text":"We love going to diners and experiencing a local style.   This place is run efficiently, is very clean and has an extensive menu.  I saw a patty melt on the menu and although I know they are loaded with calories, I couldn't help myself.   The sandwich was large and greasy like it should be.   It was cooked medium well like I had asked.  But....it had Swiss and american cheese, which was odd and therefore didn't taste like a patty melt.  I was bummed!  My husband had the open faced turkey sandwich and couldn't get over how much fresh turkey was on his plate.   The extremely yellow gravy was a bit creepy for me, but he thoroughly enjoyed it.  Prices are very good and service was great."}
{"text":"We had a nice dinner tonight at Blue Sky. Their menu is huge - lots of sandwiches, burgers, fried/baked fish, salads, and various dinners from which to choose. The decor was nice, although the dining room we sat in had nothing on the walls. I imagine that since the place is new, they may be working on that. The service was very good. I had a side salad, which was a dressed up iceburg medley with homemade croutons, chicken dumpling soup (excellent!), 1/2 roasted/BBQ chicken, baked potato and apple sauce. Everything with my dinner was tasty. My husband got a burger and said that it and the fries were very good. He also tasted my daughter's spaghetti and said that the meat sauce had an awesome flavor. The portions are very generous and the prices extremely reasonable."}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant and I have to say that the food was not good it had no seasoning it just has no favor .  If you like food that has no favor then this is the place for you."}
{"text":"I ordered stir-fry, and it was awful. The vegetables looked like they were the end of the day. My husband and I came about an hour before the end of the day, which was probably why. The sauce looked like it was entirely soy sauce and the rice wasn't a white rice but something else. I barely touched it. I should of said something, but the waitress was sweet, and it wasn't her fault. My husband ordered a rib eye steak, and he said it was fine. Oh well, better luck next time if there is a next time."}
{"text":"This is our fav family restaurant. When we moved to the area this was the first place we ate at and been a family favorite ever since. When we have guests out if we dont cook at home, we bring them here. Everything is delish!"}
{"text":"I went to Blue Sky while in town the other day, hyping it up to my family and friends, and was sadly dissapointed. Where did my amazing little diner go?  You do still get tons of sides if you order a dinner, but everything was just...not great. The soup barely had any flavor, my crab cake tasted off and it was disappointing this time around. The french fries were still good, but maybe this place is a hit or miss depending upon who is cooking that day."}
{"text":"Soup is included in nearly every lunch or dinner deal. You can't beat that. Good food at very reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner Sunday night.  Blue Sky is a great family place.  Reminds me of Laurel's or George's Kitchen back when i was a kid.  Home cooked food and a bunch of side dishes and you never leave hungry!  I always judge a place by its burgers and coleslaw.  If you can't make those good then forget it.  Blue Sky passed the test!"}
{"text":"WOW! Great Food and they are open 24 hours.  We go here at least twice a month as the food is always made to order and the service is great."}
{"text":"Good food, good prices and classic diner appeal. Disclaimer: i ve only been here slightly inebriated after 3 am BUT i would surely go back any time of day. The waitresses also deserve recognition for maintaining friendly dispositions while putting up with the drunkards."}
{"text":"Came in for breakfast this morning with the wife and in laws. Food was great prices were very reasonable. What's cool is that they stained the woodowkr this morning just before we showed up, my wife didn't notice the wet paint sign and rubbing up against it. Sorry guys you may need to touch up the middle booth a bit."}
{"text":"It's not fancy and it's not complex. It's just steady. Food portions are generous and prices are fair. It delivers exactly what you expect. Amherst and Lorain will attest to this because they have it packed wall to wall all morning and afternoon.   The brother in law and sister go here on repeat. He feasted on the bomb which is a tasty little treat: eggs biscuits sausage gravy oh my!  I indulged in a delectable Gyro omelette with tzatziki on the side and my sister had your bacon sausage egg and toast breakfast. Every plate was brimming with food. The server worked her butt off keeping our coffee cups full. Just a nice meal at the right price."}
{"text":"You simply cannot go wrong with a well run, 'mom and pop' locally owned diner/family restaurant!  Blue Sky is no exception.  Our friends who live in North Ridgeville took us here for the first time recently, and the food and service were simply fantastic!  Our group of 5 came hungry and left satiated.  The food tasted great, the portions were big, and their prices were reasonable.  Our server did an exemplary job of checking our coffee cups, and asking us several times how things were and if we needed anything.  Frankly, I don't ever want to go to any of those ripoff, overpriced and overhyped national chains again, when places like 'Blue Sky' provide superior value.  I don't even mind taking the ride from North Olmsted every now and then."}
{"text":"My husband wanted to take this opportunity to thank Blue Sky for making his terrible day a little better (no sarcasm). He ordered the clam strip dinner, and he loved it. He received a large quantity and felt the quality was great. We will be ordering takeout from them again soon."}
{"text":"Good food in a diner atmosphere.  Excellent friendly service from Kasey!   Had the Reuben with Stuffed Pepper soup.  Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Note about my review, I have never been here between the hours of 7 am to 2 am. I've been here twice, one time at 3 am and another at around 4:30 am.  This is what I needed at 3 am or 4 am in the morning, when I'm pulling an all-nighter at Oberlin. Decent greasy food and huge servings. Service on the other hand can be drastically better but who would want to work the 3 am shift anyways? Now, the quality of the food isn't the best and it isn't healthy at all but I am glad that this is better than Denny's across the street. Hopefully, I won't have to be here at this ungodly hour anymore but if you have to choose between this and Denny's, you know where I will go."}
{"text":"Sweet mother of God do I love Blue Sky.  I have rarely been here without being some degree of drunk or tweaky.  What this place excels at is standing as a greasy beacon of hope in the grim wee hours of the morning when you're either a) totally strung out after pulling several consecutive all-nighters during finals, or b) totally soused and somehow able to strong-arm a weak-willed, less-drunk friend into driving you.  I'm getting a little verklempt just writing this, because Blue Sky was a pillar of my undergrad existence.  I stand by the assertion that theirs is the best reuben I have tried.  Buttered, toasted triangles of rye bread sandwiching strata of tender but lean corned beef, well-drained sauerkraut, all bound together by the mellow tanginess of perfectly melted swiss.  The russian dressing is on the side so you can administer your own portion and also because they've figured out that it's the ultimate fry condiment.  The waitresses are such spritely, bubbly, huggable good sports it's ridiculous.  Do you know how many drunks and creepy child support-evaders with haggard stripper girlfriends a 24-hour diner in rural Ohio has to endure?  Like, a lot.  When you drunkenly declare to your waitress that you can't order because you're \"SO CONFUSED\" she smiles indulgently and tells you to take your time, even if you meant existentially confused and she probably knows that.  If someone was having a bad trip I'd teleport them here.  There's even a soothing mural of a, uh, blue sky on the back wall.  Also they have a drool-worthy dessert case with hearty midwestern cavity-fests like Snickers cheesecake and coconut cream pie.  Their gyro is toasty and succulent and staggeringly garlicky.  Go figure, the best Greek and Jewish deli food I've had is in Amherst, OH.  Also their motto is some hilarious tautological statement like, \"We know that you like our food because the food that we serve you is what you love\" or something like that.  GO HERE GO HERE GO HERE GO HERE.  Even if you have to fly in to the Cleveland Hopkins airport and drive for like 40 minutes.  Well, maybe not, but if you're in the area, and especially if you're drunk or in abject despair or with friends late at night or at the brunchin' hour, check it out for sure."}
{"text":"I absolutely love the breakfast at Blue Sky. It's easily the best in the county. The service is always spectacular and there are a few ladies that wait tables regularly. These ladies are always quick and check our tables for needs regularly without being excessive even when all tables are filled on a Saturday or Sunday morning. So make sure you tip them good.   I highly recommend the western omelette. Ask to add cheese as this omelette doesn't come with cheese. I really like it with provolone. If you're in the mood for pancakes, the chocolate chip pancakes are the best I've ever had anywhere. Their country fried steak is also a great dish if you're into that. Their breakfast is always great. You can't go wrong! I can't speak for lunch or dinner because I never had it. Get the breakfast. You will be satisfied and with a full stomach!"}
{"text":"Super slow unfortunately and the servers are rude when they are busy. not a great experience especially with the big chain diners across the street."}
{"text":"my first experience here I was angry when I walked in the door. Bad day At work.      I was seated promptly and my attitude quickly went away as myi smiling server put me so at ease.     I devoured the breakfast of eggs, sausage, hashbrowns and flap jacks.    Blue Sky puts ALL family style reatahrants to shame"}
{"text":"Had a very good breakfast this morning. All 3 had eggs Benedict with the hash browns. Only negative was one of my eggs could have been cooked slightly longer. Would recommend the eggs Benedict!"}
{"text":"We go here a lot for breakfast. I usually get an omelette. It's always stuffed with meat & cheese. The portion sizes are huge compared to Bob Evans & Perkins. An omelette is only $6.99. You get a huge portion of hash browns as well. The hash browns are pretty bland but they have no problem adding some peppers & onions to them for you. At my servers suggestion, I tried pouring a cup of gravy over top of them. Delicious! Loved the gravy. Atmosphere is ok, nothing fancy, but it's clean. The bathrooms are always pretty clean. We've had just about all the servers here and honestly all of them are really friendly. Some more than others but for the most part, they are all really friendly & attentive. On top of drink refills. Love them place. Wish I had one a little closer to my home."}
{"text":"I have been here twice. Both times I ordered the Blue Sky omelet, once with a side of pancakes. Their hot chocolate and coffee are amazing. It's hard to find good coffee these days.  Back to the omelet, it is just packed full of meat and vegetables. Cooked to perfection.  Blue Sky has a huge menu and everything looks amazing. You don't have to be a senior to order off the senior menu either. Healthier cheaper options are available to all.  I love this place and highly recommend it to anyone looking for an affordable delicious home cooked meal."}
{"text":"We love going here when we visit family! The food is good and the portions are large. The corn beef/Reuben is a favorite!"}
{"text":"We had dinner here, not sure what all the great reviews are about.  Food was so/so, the prices were good - but not worth what we were served.  Service was okay - but we will not return."}
{"text":"Pancakes are the best. The food is really good no matter the time of day. Sometimes the service could be more attentive but overall I like the place."}
{"text":"This place is always great! Such a good deal for some good food. The prices are so reasonable, and the staff is so friendly. We eat here as a family at least once a week!   Love the chicken wrap, and the soups of the day are delicious!"}
{"text":"Blue Sky is a local favorite! This place has delicious food for a nice price and great service. I've been coming here for years for breakfast, lunch, and dinner (not all on the same day) and its always been just wonderful. Its a nice sit-down restaurant that's open 24 hours that I can't recommend enough."}
{"text":"I've been looking for a good local breakfast place since I moved here and I finally got to this place on my list of to-trys. I was really excited when I first showed up, especially because the inside was clean, everyone looked happy, and the food looked good.   I sat down, looked at the menu, and was pretty happy with what I saw. They had a $3.50ish breakfast that included eggs, bacon/sausage and hash browns. I didn't really want any bacon/sausage so I asked my waitress if I could have a couple slices of tomato instead. She said yes.   What came out of the kitchen was a plate with only eggs and tomatoes on it. I asked where the hash browns were and she was obviously confused. I realized that she thought I wanted to sub both my meat and hash browns for tomatoes (not really sure how she thought that). She quickly said that she'd go grab the hash browns, which made me think that she had realized her error and was fixing it.  Nope.  When I got my bill it was for the $3.50 breakfast plus a $2.50 charge for hash browns. I sat at the table for a good five minutes waiting to see her again to dispute the bill but she didn't show. So I got up and went to the hostess/paying station and told her what had happened. She refused to correct my bill, telling me that the tomato wouldn't be considered a replacement for the meat and that they also would have been an additional $2.50 charge for them (so it didn't mater that the up-charge was for hash browns as I would have gotten that cost anyways just by asking for tomatoes).   Believe me, this is -not- what I understood to be true when I had initially spoken to my waitress. Not to mention, if she had told me that they were going to charge me $2.50 for three slices of tomato I would have not ordered them.   So basically, I ordered initially a breakfast that did not have the most expensive food item on it (meat) and they still wouldn't remove the additional $2.50 charge. Frankly, that's just a totally unacceptable business practice."}
