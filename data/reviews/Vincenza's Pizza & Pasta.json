{"text":"This is a perfect lunch spot. It is very cheap and you get A LOT of food. The old ladies are awesome and most are straight from Italy. You can either order pasta on one side or pizza on the other. Their pastas are homemade and delicious not to mention they are under $7! Their pizza is consistently voted the best in Cleveland but I wasn't completely blown away. I order cheese/pepperoni thin crust pizza and it was pretty good. I think they are more famous for their thick, \"loaded\" pizzas. I ate here for lunch almost every day for a few months straight while working downtown. I wish it was open on the weekends."}
{"text":"Greatest pizza in Cleve? Naw. Downtown though? Likely. When I gotta have NY style pizza quick this is my goto place (assuming I can squeeze into their hours)."}
{"text":"There is a reason the line for pizza sometimes goes out the door - it's the best pizza downtown. And it's cheap. There are three lines here, one for pasta, one for subs and salads, and one for pizza. They all move very quickly, and you should definitely be prepared to order by the time you reach the front b/c they like to keep it moving - they are efficient without being rude. The pasta, salads, and subs are good - I would give them 3 stars, but I would give the pizza 5 stars. I really like the thin cheese and white pizza with tomato. There are a lot of seats/tables, so even though the lines can get long, I've never had a problem getting a seat."}
{"text":"This is my favorite lunch option in downtown Cleveland -- I go there almost every day! The pizzas are delicious, there is always a huge selection including many favorites (you can't go wrong with the thin-crust), the pizza has the same great taste day after day, and it is by-the-slice so you don't have to order any more than you want to. For me, two slices of thin-crust pizza is simply the perfect lunch!"}
{"text":"There is no bad order here. NY style, Sicilian, stuffed, are all a hundred times better than any other pizza downtown. But it's the vegetable calzone that gets me every time.  And try their house dressing if you want Italian that is fresh and vinegary as opposed to the gross sweet thick stuff most restaurants pass off."}
{"text":"Popped in for lunch. So much chaos til u have ur food and paid for it. Best new york style in Cleveland. \"Deep dish\" mad good as well. Comin back for moar."}
{"text":"After I took my first trip to New York City in 2012 I have claimed that pizza doesn't get better than NYC style. There is Capri Pizza in the burbs and Downtown we have Vincenza's. I love going here for a few slices of mushroom pizza. It is a great option for lunch or before a game in the Gateway District. My only complaint is that they are not open very late and are not open on weekends at all."}
{"text":"Yeah, the pizza is great, but the pasta is even better. Vincenza makes the best sauce in cleveland, and she makes it fresh daily."}
{"text":"Easily the best slice of pizza in downtown Cleveland. They've got a solid menu, prices are great, it's convenient, service is usually quick and most of the time friendly.

Love it."}
{"text":"Conveniently located by Progressive field and great for a pregame quick snack. Was an affordable $16 for 5 slices and some soda. That said, the pizza was average- reheated, but still just ok."}
{"text":"Excellent meatball sandwiches! Salads are good too. Lunch is crowded. Hours are limited.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"WE FINALLY FOUND IT! THE place to go for pizza if you live in the downtown area, or if your IN the downtown area period. I was a little put off by my initial interaction with a staff member on the phone, but quickly realized it was just a difference in communication styles, which I can respect; Im from New York. They don't deliver, which was disappointing, But once I had the food, let me tell you, it was well worth the 5 minute drive. Id drive an HOUR for this pizza, it was bananas. It was like being back home in Brooklyn, authentic New York style pizza. They have deep dish as well if you're into that, but I can speak on it. Im not interested in pie as pizza. The Pasta was AMAZING, and they serve each meal with really great garlic bread. It was bad for my diet, but my tastebuds thanked me. We loved it so much we did a return trip the NEXT day. As an extra bonus, they remembered us when we called in our order. This is a great Pizzeria. We had no need to search for a new pizza joint for Friday night dinners."}
{"text":"Was there this afternoon. I ordered the neopolitan slices (who wants to eat all that dough on the other ones)? Very light, very crispy. Probably the closest thing I've had to New York Style in Cleveland. It is, in fact, foldable (albeit with a little bit of help). Overall, the pizza was okay. A little bland for my liking. Sauce is very basic. Strange really. I had three pieces (less than $2 a piece) and didn't feel full. Quite an odd feeling if you ask me. Is it better than Sbarro? Probably, wins the tie breaker because it's local. So, yeah, it is better than Sbarro, but not much. Open for lunch, and special downtown event dinners, ie Tribe games."}
{"text":"Best NY Style we've found in CLE..."}
{"text":"When you're in downtown CLE, on the way to a game, Vincenza's is a must. My husband works downtown and has been going here as long as we can remember, to get great pizza at an excellent price. I like the thin crust, cheese- always crispy but not burned. They have thick crust too and  lots of choices of toppings. Salads, pastas and sandwiches are available too. Staff is friendly and the dining area is big and clean! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Excellent prices and great food. Great location in the 5th Street Arcades. Easy access for downtown workers and tourists."}
{"text":"Having been to NYC and having plenty of slices, I have to say that this NY Style Pizza is hands down the BEST outside of NYC!! The staff is friendly and fast and the pizza is always fresh!!"}
{"text":"This 5 star rating does not mean it is the best pizza I have had but just the best I have found in the area.  If there is a better  spot in the vicinity please email me and let me know because I have yet to find it.  If your on the search for good pizza I would recommend this spot.  Coming from New York I am tough on criticizing pizza and this one will pass the test of returning for multiple visits."}
{"text":"Just ate the special of the day, stuffed manicotti. Delicious. Fresh made pasta stuffed with ricotta, mozzarella and ground beef. Topped with meat sauce and grated Parmesan. Lunch under $7.00 for fresh delicious Italian food!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a downtown place (near the entertainment and sports districts) that serves a quick New York style pizza by the slice, subs and salads...then this is your spot!

We were headed into town for a recent Cavs game and wanted a bite close to the stadium.  I had heard good things about Vincenza's and my brother--in-law was down for giving it a try.  I ordered a slice and a meatball sub, so as to try two different menu items.  The pepperoni pizza by the slice was New York style, but not quite as tangy / zippy as I had hoped.  Still, it was a solid piece of pizza especially for the price.  The meatball sub had a bright, tangy marinara sauce and tons of cheese within a crispy roll.  There were plenty of meatballs ensuring that every bite had meat, cheese and sauce in it.

Certainly nothing fancy about this place, but for a very reasonably priced meal right in the heart of downtown, it is hard to beat in terms of Italian options."}
{"text":"What is the big deal about this place?  Whoever said this is good pizza hasn't experienced good pizza.  The sauce has absolutely no taste.  I can only speak for the thin crust.  This place would go down in flames in a pizza taste-test against Angelo's in Lakewood.  Now that's damn good pizza."}
{"text":"I will never get sick of this place. I worked in the arcade about 2 years ago at Fitworks and would constantly come by to grab a slice of pizza and their AMAZING grilled chicken salads! 
You order in an assembly type fashion and they have so many different types of pizza to choose from! I wish they were always open."}
{"text":"Hands down, the best pizza in Cleveland. Food is always good and fresh and you can choose from several type of crust as well. Only drawbacks are the parking is only avail on the street and they aren't open on Sat and Sun. However, if you get a chance to get here before they close during the weekday, you'll enjoy one of the best slices of pizza ever. 


Staff is friendly, plenty of seating to eat in and enjoy every bite. Good for people visiting downtown Cleveland or for folks headed to the Cavs or Indians games."}
{"text":"A wide, wide variety of pizza and pasta makes Vincenza's great.  Everything I've tried there is delicious.  Only problem is, they get packed at lunchtime and you can find yourself waiting quite a while if you go at the peak of the rush.  Other than that, it's great.

Try the stuffed meat pizza."}
{"text":"This is by far the best pizza you will have in your life.  Get the meat stuffed pizza, jumbo size."}
{"text":"Never disappoints. Good value excellant pizza. Plenty seating. Service very courteous."}
{"text":"I love me some Vincenza's! The pizza, the grilled chicken salads, and the staff! This place is very nice to walk to on your break at work and the staff are always willing to take time out to bullshit and catch up. They are amazing. The pizza is to die for (I love the artichoke/tomato) and the grilled chicken salads are HUGE and tasty! The best part is that even if you only spend $1.95 on pizza they STILL ACCEPT CREDIT CARDS!!! Definitely stop by if you are in the Cleveland area!"}
{"text":"Do not get here enough due to their hours and my schedule, but they without a doubt serve up the best thin pizza in Cleveland and no one else is in the ballpark. As noted in prior comments, this place is uber crowded during lunch every day. Most definitely worth any wait."}
{"text":"How in all the times I have searched for great pizza in Cleveland have I missed this?!?!? We actually found this while walking from a parking deck to the Pink concert at The Q. I am so glad we did! Truly the best NYC style pizza we have had in ages. My sister and I are serious pizza eaters and this was just amazing even my daughter who is not as crazy about pizza has said \"when are we going back to Cleveland?\" Three times this week since then!!! 
So what made it so good? Well the crust was super thin and cooked perfectly so that you got that nice crunch when you bit down into it and then the cheese - we got extra cheese - nice and fresh mozzarella that pulls when you bite it and has such a great flavor! Perfection! 
I did not care for the Chicago deep dish. It was more of a pan to me and not true Chicago pie. I plan on going back very soon and enjoying more of the NYC though! 
My daughter got a stuffed piece and she cannot wait to have more. She liked that it wasn't huge but full of meat and flavor. Really great meal and all three of us ate for under $20! That's a serious score!"}
{"text":"Having recently relocated from Brooklyn, NY, I have been searching for true \"NY Style\" pizza.
This is the BEST!!!  The sicialian slice had all the right stuff and the crisp crust...OMG heavenly.
The regular slice was like being home again.  Now to try the specialty items..."}
{"text":"Great NY style pizza! Simple and delicious! I love the margherita and stuffed veggie. It does get crowded for lunch, but the service is fast and the price is right. No wonder everyone loves it."}
{"text":"I don't write many reviews but I can tell you that I've never tried to place an order with people so rude before. The staff is a bunch of idiots and they try to make you feel bad for their miserable lives."}
{"text":"This is great NY style pizza.  As close to NY style pizza that I have found in Cleveland.  They close at 6:30 however, so if you're looking to grab a pie for dinner go early."}
{"text":"4 stars for my first visit! Vincenza's is located in the 5th street arcade off of Prospect (also accessible off of Euclid). Delicious NY style pizza at $2.25 a slice. It's pretty busy at lunch but the wait is not too long. I think it's the best NY style pizza in Cle."}
{"text":"GREATEST OF ALL CLEVELAND! okay so if you want a TRUE new york style pizza THIS IS THE PLACE. PizzaMore AYIIII im so excited. i trekked far into little italy, and was disappointed only to find that this place is right across from my job BLESSINGS.

The owner was in the building for a slow lunch crowd, which was fine, he was super nice, super friendly, even gave me a slice on the house after he learned of my longing for real pizza in cleveland. I had a plain slide and a white (ricotta) slice. BOTH equally amazing, the crust was everything, the sauce rich and hearty, the cheese stayed on the pizza when you bit it, i was able to do a half fold with the slice. I also had a small Caesar salad and my meal came out to $10 all around. thats awesome for me. happy wallet dance!

Totally worth the trip into downtown, fast friendly AMAZING pizza! mama mia i am so thrilled i have a piece of home here in cleveland"}
{"text":"Hands down my  favorite pie in Cleveland. You can taste the quality in the ingredients  with every bite. The stuffed meat pizza oh so good with dipping sauce. The bread winner is the thin Neapolitan cheese is so amazing.  I have had a whole pie to go and it doesn't compare I love the double bake on the pizza. Once you get to know the pizza Nazis they are really friendly and funny when they want to be. Seems to be family owned and I like that."}
{"text":"Everything about this place rocks!! Want a slice of za and a large salad under $10? DONE! The pizza is cooked to perfection. I can't wait to come back and try their pasta and subs. My mouth is watering just thinking about it! Top notch service too. They get you in and out in less than 5 minutes.

I wish this place was open late night. I'd be here after the bars every weekend!!"}
{"text":"After reviewing Yelp to find where I'd go for dinner, I found Vincenza's Pizza & Pasta. Having tried a few local places for pizza, I was disappointed and hoping this would give me back my memories of delicious NY pizza! 

I ordered two slices of cheese pizza. Heated and took the slices to go! Pizza was delicious. It was thin crust, but not paper thin, just right. Sauce and cheese were also very good and the ratio between the two was spot on. A couple of weeks later and I am craving this pizza so that's how I know it was really good. 

Reminded me of pizza from home but missing a star because it still felt like there was still something to be desired from it. Overall, I highly recommend going here and trying  their pizza. They are very friendly and easy to talk to while you wait. Can't beat the prices either. I will be going back again soon!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in downtown Cleveland.  Period.  The line may look long at rush hour, but they keep it moving.  Italian dishes from the other side of the restaurant are decent, but the pizza is the reason to come here.

If you don't see a particular slice with a topping you want, ask them, and they'll add it to a slice."}
{"text":"I had the thin crust cheese pizza. By far has been the pizza I've had in cleveland. Absolutely delicious and tastes like pizza straight from NYC. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"I saw several people going in as I was passing by. So I stopped and went in to see what all the hype was about. The only difference between them and Sbarro's is that you can add topping. Pizza actually doesn't taste any different."}
{"text":"Good food, great value. Not to be missed. I tried the the lasagna today on recommendation of a coworker....it was great. I'd like to try the pizza next time."}
{"text":"Okay pizza place... Service was nice and friendly, the joint was clean for the amount of traffic it gets.  Now for the pizza... I ordered a slice of the stuffed pizza with pepperoni, sausage and meatballs and a slice of thin crust mushroom.  My friend ordered a slice of the margarita pizza and a slice the thick crust artichoke and tomato. The pizza was good and I do not think you will be disappointed but I was not impressed. I felt that the pizza's lacked a savory flavor, you know the one that makes you eat a whole pie and you go into the pizza coma. I felt the crust was dry and a bit hard, the sauce and the cheese were only average. The margarita pizza lacked any basil flavor. The stuffed pizza was not that stuffed with meat and there was no sauce or cheese in it, though a side sauce was provided. The mushroom was the best pizza I tried for flavor but I did have to add a dash of salt. My friend said the artichoke and tomato pizza was just okay and she would not order it again.  I wondered if by order by the slice was the issue and if I had ordered a fresh pie if it would have made a difference. Though it would mean that eating left over pizza the next day would have been a disappointment then... and that is an important grade when judging a good pizza, the cold pizza taste and the reheated pizza taste.  Lastly the size of the slices were average for a little over $2.75 a slice.  I did not try the pasta dishes. Overall I would not go again myself with other places to try and old tried and true places to order from.  Happy eating... :)"}
{"text":"This is absolutely the best pizza in downtown Cleveland.  I've only eaten it in the restaurent, by the slice.  The crust is excellent, toppings fresh, and the portions are generous.  And it's less expensive than most other places.  If you're downtown, DO NOT waste your money on any other pizza (especially a crappy chain like Sbarro), this is the best, and the size of the lunchtime crowd attests to this.  (That's the only bad thing about the place--the lines can get long!)"}
{"text":"This is a great place to grab a slice fast on the go and it is pretty darn good pizza. Cleveland has very few places like this and it would be nice if we had a couple more. The reason that this place doesn't get more stars is I have eaten a lot of pizza (including the margarita and Sicilian slices I had) at some of the best places around the world from New York to Naples. It is also possible that the pizza is better when you get a whole pie fresh rather than a slice reheated and that would earn them another star."}
{"text":"Best Pizza in the City

Go with stuffed and get your dipping on

2 pieces is plenty 

Be ready to order

Meat Lovers Pizza Over Veggie

Weird Hours but you gotta get your fix."}
{"text":"Best New York style pizza downtown you are going to find. The crust! It's unbelievable! Definitely let them heat it up in the oven."}
{"text":"Where to start?  Vincenza's is my favorite, and I've been eating lunch there nearly weekly (sometimes more) since 2001.  I've never been to a restaurant where every last thing can make a \"best of\" list besides Vincenza's.  It has BY FAR the best chicken parmesan in town. Its hot subs are top-shelf.  And its pizza (particularly the New York style) is unrivaled in Cleveland.  And let's not forget the desserts -- the chocolate mousse and lemon cake are as good as it gets.  Even its fountain soda carbonation is spot-on.  Are you kidding me?!  Deciding on what to eat is so hard that my buddies and I have been known to order what we call the \"trifecta-plus\" (which is a belly-busting chicken parm w/ pasta, half a sub, a slice of pizza, and the \"plus\" is dessert).  Vincenza's is a perfect 10.  I'd eat there every day if I could."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a quick bite before 6pm, this will fit the bill.  If you want better than average pizza...move on.

We were staying nearby and needed a snack to hold us until a late night dinner reservation.  We tried a slice of cheese, a slice of pepperoni, a slice of broccoli and cheese and a deep dish sausage slice.  The best of those four was the sausage, and it ranked about a 3.5 for me.  Slices were good sized, but I was still hungry after.

They heated all four in their oven for us."}
{"text":"Couldn't find any other decent restaurants so we came here.This place is huge.The pizza is really good.The pasta selection is also good.There's not a lot of restaurants around there but this one was good.Staff is very friendly and the tables are very clean."}
{"text":"Great pizza and service. Ordered a deluxe Chicago style. Crust was amazing, toppings were top notch, and it was cooked perfectly. Took about 20 minutes from order to pickup. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Great spot for a quick, inexpensive, and delicious lunch.  Hit up the pasta side."}
{"text":"I can only speak for the pizza. I liked it, nice crunchy crust. Sausage was good, no chunks, mushrooms, pepperoni and bacon. Yum!  Pop in for lunch and buy just a slice or a whole pie. Doesn't take long and fair priced."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick lunch while downtown at the county clerks office.  We got a couple of different slices and they were all good.  The Chicago garlic bread deep dish was damn good.  Also everything was very cheap!! I love a good cheap pizza by the slice place!! Next time we are downtown we will stop by and get another slice!!"}
{"text":"My favorite pizza place in Cleveland, I have been going here since they were in Bedford. Good homemade Italian owned pizzaria. They have pasta as well which is also great. One great thing is you can order by the slice which I love. Don't worry it will be fresh and tasty. You might want to by a whole pie, you will want some later.

Since this place is a downtown spot it can get busy and the parking isn't the best. But trust me this place is worth it. This is a Must try for pizza lovers."}
{"text":"I was in the area before an Indian's game, looking for a place to eat and found this place.  What a pleasant surprise.  Nice variety of pizza served by the slice, calzones and salads.  Generous sized pieces for the price and fresh, plentiful toppings.  Service was friendly and timely.  Seating was space, but we were able to find some.  Great place to stop for lunch and pick up a pizza."}
{"text":"Nice staff and decent pizza by the slice at good prices. We had the thin and Chicago crusts and both were tasty. It was a quick and good lunch option while we were checking out downtown Cleveland. Nothing spectacular, but a solid choice if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Good stuff, it's like a nicer version of the Soup
Nazzi. Enjoy the subs and the slices."}
{"text":"This is absolutely the best pizza I have ever had.  I have had it many, many times and it never disappoints.  My favorite kind is the stuffed meat pizza and the thin crust pepperoni.  I like the thin crust NYC style, but they have Sicilian style too, if that is what you like.   

Be advised if you are going there for lunch, you better be ready to wait the line gets really long.  The staff is very quick however, so you won't be waiting to long."}
{"text":"Worst food experience in Cleveland. I ordered the cheese lasagna over the phone. I specifically asked if it was vegetarian friendly and I was told yes. As I started eating the lasagna I thought it tasted funny, come to it, it has meat. I called the manager and he was extremely rude and I was greeted with a \"sorry about that, we're really busy right now so I'm sorry again bye.\" As a vegetarian of 7 years I did not appreciate this retort or the overall customer service. I or any of my friends, family, or acquaintances will NEVER eat here again due to the horrible ethics and customer service they seem to allow. Poor management. Would not recommend to my worst enemy."}
{"text":"So good- owner from Brooklyn so this is legit old New York pizza. The crust is crisp and thin, the sauce fresh with herbs, and the cheese has the right amount of melt. I just returned from New York, where pizza like this is super rare now and Dominos is EVERYWHERE. Next time I'll get the Sicilian which I've been craving. Pizza by the slice or by the pie, pasta, and more."}
{"text":"A little disappointed.  We spent the day at the zoo and went for a pasta dinner.  They close at 6:30 but had no pasta options at 5:45."}
{"text":"Fast, inexpensive, convenient and friendly, I can't think of a better place to grab a bite before a Cavs game. 

Located just across the street from Quicken Loans Arena, Vincenza's has been serving up tasty pie ever since their days in downtown Bedford. A few years ago, they moved their business to Prospect Ave in downtown Cleveland. Needless to say, I've been a long time supporter. 

Vincenza's offers \"mall style\" pizza; enormous, pre-cooked slices, reheated in a large oven upon ordering. The lines move quick and the slices are very inexpensive, especially for downtown. They also have a fairly large dining area with plenty of seats. Whenever I'm in a hurry to fill up before an event at the Q, Vincenza's is always my first choice."}
{"text":"I just ordered cavatelli for 35 people from Vincenza's and I am glad that I did. The pasta was perfectly cooked (not too mushy), the sauce was mixed in already. I am very picky about sauces, however Vincenza's makes a really good red sauce (I ordered both the meat and marinara sauce). Delivered on time. Came with rolls & butter and a container of grated parmesan cheese.  Very Affordable! I ordered salad and cookies and it came to almost $6 per person for everything (not including tips).  The only negative thing I have to say is that you have to call ahead to make sure they have your delivery time available."}
{"text":"This is the only true NY style pizza I've found in Cleveland. 5 stars all day baby!"}
{"text":"This is a good place to get a slice of pizza. They have NY, Sicilian, and Chicago style by the slice or whole pies. Friendly staff, clean place, great pizza. I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"We tried this place out because of the reviews here on Yelp and we were not disappointed! Staff was friendly, helpful and quick to help with your order. We moved here from NY and it was the first time our 1 year old ate pizza without spitting it out, mind you it was the Margherita pizza but he ate it! I enjoyed the thick crust slice and my husband got a slice of stuffed which was to die for, I am getting that one next time. It was the best we have had since leaving NY."}
{"text":"It is just as you would expect it to be. The price you cannot beat. The pizza tastes like the pizza you had when you were in high school. If you are in a hurry I would try the pasta area. Or go over to the slice of pizza area and just buy a slice.however while I was there the lasagna looked.very gross dried up, dead and old."}
{"text":"It's pretty good pizza- It's within walking distance from my office which is a great plus, but it doesn't even crack the top 10 on my pizza list..."}
{"text":"Easily one of the best lunch spots downtown. You can choose from Neapolitan, thick crust, or stuffed in the pizza line- and you had better know what you want by the time you get to the front of that line. They move fast, and expect you to as well. Or go to the pasta line, and sample Mama's lasagna, manicotti, ravioli, etc. All of the choices there are excellent. Portions are generous and prices are relatively low. Just be patient if you get there after noon."}
{"text":"As I grew up outside of NYC, I'm a bit of a self-proclaimed pizza snob. Though, I do love all the variety offered at Vincenza's. It's the closest to NY style pizza I've had in Cleveland, and even their stuffed slices are great."}
{"text":"Found out about this place from a friend who's obsessed with pizza, and she was right when she said this was the best pizza in Cleveland. Vincenza's serves NY style pizza with the same speed and efficiency you'd expect at a joint in NYC. The pizza itself is delicious..When it comes to NY style pizza I usually go for the cheese, which was thin, had perfect balance of crispy/chewy, not too greasy, and had lots of sauce!
Super casual, this is a good place to grab a slice in the middle of the day, I just wish their hours were better (they close at 6PM).
Just writing this review has given me a craving for the Margarita pizza!"}
{"text":"I love the pizza here, but the hours are so ridiculous I haven't had it since March. Also, they won't deliver to anywhere that's not \"within walking distance.\" If I could walk there, why would I want delivery?? Too bad, hope the lunch crowd is enough to keep this place in business, since that's all they cater to."}
{"text":"I'll be honest, I heard that this was a \"Cleveland staple\" and is regarded as the best pizza in town, but I was far from impressed.

Upon arriving, an employee (who I assume was a manager/owner) was swearing up a storm and kicking furniture around.  His employees just stood there and even remarked to each other that this was common and that \"it doesn't take much\" to set him off.

The atmosphere (screaming employee aside) was actually quite nice.... right across from The Q.   The food failed to impress me.  I tried a couple slices of pizza -- Chicago Deep Dish and a Stuffed Crust, as well as a calzone.   They simply warm up what is on the platter in front of them.

Last week I went to Giant Eagle on Rt 82 and had a slice of pizza in their cafe prepared the exact same way.   (And it tasted that way, too)."}
{"text":"One of the best pizza I had in cleveland. Their thin crust was the best.the place is packed.during lunch hours. The only negative point is it closes early."}
{"text":"The first review of Vincenza's is inaccurate and puzzling.  This pizza is fantastic.  I go there for lunch at times, and have been there with various other downtown worker bees, and every single person who I've been here with agree that the pizza is absolutely delicious.  I prefer the sicilian and the thicker styles of pizza.  I think the crust makes the pizza."}
{"text":"The New York style pizza here truly tastes authentic! The staff is always friendly and I am really happy to have found this place in Ohio, being originally from Brooklyn, NY myself! Parking is sometimes an issue, but when is it not in Cleveland? I also wish the hours here were more flexible; right now they are only open from 11-6:30 pm M-F."}
{"text":"My favorite pizza in Cleveland. Their cavatelli and pasta dishes are also good. This is a busy lunch spot so get there early. Ordering goes really fast though. They have thin and thick crust pizzas."}
{"text":"Vincenza's is one of my favorite lunch spots downtown.  They have great pizza by the slice. My favorite is the thin crust with banana peppers, but you can add whatever toppings you want or get one of the premade pizzas. 

If you're coming for pizza, try to avoid coming right at noon. It's busy! However, all the workers are super friendly and know how to handle the pressure of a lunch rush."}
{"text":"Stopped in to Vincenza's for some lunch with a co-worker recently.  I haven't been to Vincenza's in about 6 years!  I hit up the pasta bar for some chicken Parmesan.  The food was hot and tasty.  Their pasta sauce is delicious and I can't wait to go back for their stuffed shells and pizza!

Love Vincenza's!"}
{"text":"This is real new york style pizza!  I love it!  I have tried everything... it's all good!  Even the salads are awesome.  My favorite is the chicago style veggie (this says alot, I'm not a veggie kind of guy)."}
{"text":"This was my third visit to Vincenza's and I have to say they are very good. 

Ok so yet another great downtown Cleveland location if you are in the area and if you love pizza the way I do. All three times I have been was during the lunch hour which as you surely know is always busy.  What is really neat is the the large selection of pizzas they have ready to go at lunch time. They have deep dish, deep dish square, and thin crust. I have tried all three and the thin crust is pretty awesome. They have better choices too, like veggie pizza and white veggie pizzas. 
They also have a pasta bar on the opposite side of the restaurant if pizza isn't your thing. I haven't tried that yet but I soon will.

If you are near by and never been, I urge you to stop by and try it at least once. I think you will really enjoy it."}
{"text":"A friend bought me a slice of cheese for lunch today. I don't know if this was a good batch of sauce. It tasted way better today than ever. It really is the closest to NY style in Cleveland. It is a great option for lunch downtown. I would stick to the neapolitan slice."}
{"text":"I wasn't feeling good at all today and needed a quick pick me up. I randomly stopped in Vincenza's and was pleased with my experience. Very quick service and friendly staff. I couldn't make up my mind and the cashier said try one of each that you want and I went for it. Delicious! Thank you."}
{"text":"A legitimate slice of New York-style pizza is almost impossible to find in Cleveland. Why is that exactly? I mean, we're close enough to the East Coast that this really shouldn't be an issue. Especially not in 2018. Neapolitan, brick oven, Sicilian and even somewhat sorry excuses for Chicago Deep Dish are all available, yet our local pizza scene is seemingly devoid of authentic N.Y. style options. At least, that's what I thought, before trying Vincenza's. 

My husband and I recently made a pilgrimage downtown just for this pizza (during rush hour, mind you) and it was totally worth the drive from the Heights. We called in our order for pick up and it was ready in under 20 minutes.

The jumbo pie had a perfect cheese to sauce ratio, extra thin crust that was crunchy on the outside (yet had a slightly chewy center) and it was sliced large enough for each piece to be folded in half while you eat it. If you're wondering, yes, that last part is essential to enjoying a truly great NY pizza eating experience. 

They also had all sorts of individual slices available with a variety of different crusts and toppings, making it a great downtown lunch option, as well. The dining room was simple, but clean. 

Vincenza's is very much worth the commute, if you're traveling from the 'burbs, like we were!"}
{"text":"The best place and people. Family owned and the food is amazing. Pizza, subs, salads. The best. And the price is right. High quality all around. kudos to this family for all there hard work and dedication to the people of Cleveland.  You will never be disappointed by this place!"}
{"text":"Super welcoming service! Accommodated our large group with grace and ease. Food delicious-something for everyone!  Thanks Vincenzas!"}
{"text":"This is the best pizza in Cleveland...if I order anything else it's because Vincenza's is already closed and I'll wish it was Vincenza's instead. NY style and Sicilian are my faves."}
{"text":"You know you frequent a place too much when you go in after a month and a half of night shift and being out of town, in the middle of a crazy busy Friday lunch rush, and the owner looks up and notices you and asks where you've been! It's true, I do come here too much, but it's just TOO close, TOO convenient, and TOO good!! 

I know... I'm from Chicago, I should love deep dish, and I do... but NOTHING beats a super thin, hot slice of NY style pizza in my opinion and that's exactly my \"usual\" here... 2 slices of thin cheese (and a dr pepper... only if i'm feeling... unhealthy ;) )

Like I said, it's super close to my apartment, right next door actually. There have been days where I get out of my car after work and walk straight there to grab dinner before walking up to my apartment. The owners/employees are all super friendly! Yes, they heat up slices, but you also see them constantly making fresh pizza, not sure if people who have complained about the \"heat up\" method expect them to freshly make one slice at a time or prefer a lukewarm/cold slice of pizza, but if you go to NYC, this is done at every quick pizza joint. 

Anyways, like I said my usual is the thin cheese. I've had their thicker \"pan\"/\"deep dish\" pizza and I just prefer the crispiness, less doughy thin, but I know many people who prefer the thicker crust. Regardless, their dough/crust is delicious and I love their sauce! I have yet to try any of their pasta, which I've heard great things about. There are days I go in thinking I'll get pasta, but walk out with pizza - not sure how it happens, it's like my stomach just speaks for itself....

The food is super cheap! You can get 2 slices of pizza for a little over 3 dollars... add a DP and you're a little over 5. Not bad, in my opinion, for lunch or dinner downtown!

My one wish (and I've def expressed it to the owners) is I want them to be open on the weekends. I also wish they were open late night, b/c I know i've been out drinking and have walked past vincenza's on my walk home and have looked longingly inside, and have dreamt of a slice (ok, maybe not... but I've def craved it late at night...)

LOVE me some Vincenza's ... It is easily my favorite pizza in Cleveland.. If you're in the area, definitely try it :)"}
{"text":"Best NY style pizza in Cleveland. Also fantastic pasta options and an amazing chicken parm sub. Gets pretty busy during the lunch rush, but well worth it. Family run and literally a place where people remember your name (and order)."}
