{"text":"Stopped in for a quick lunch and was so happy I did. Nice people, cute place, great prices, and awesome food. Great quality, fresh, and HEALTHY portions. Ordered the Greek salad with gyro meat and was enough for 2 meals. Will be back"}
{"text":"Falafel tastes like it was frozen.  Hummus was flavorless.  The salad had too much cheap, salty feta.  This food is at par with food you'd find in the mall foodcourt."}
{"text":"If you go you HAVE to try the fries! I don't know what they are called but they have cheese (fetta I think) lemon and garlic on them. They are sooo good! I got a chicken pita wrap and it was really good, the sauce they used on the wrap made it awesome!"}
{"text":"Awesome food! Had the grilled chicken Greek  salad. Huge bowl of awesomeness! Great atmosphere, Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Love this place! Service is great and food is delish...this is one of my favorite places to come to."}
{"text":"On a weeknight recently, decided to broaden horizons by trying Greek food. Have heard much about how delicious it is and the Cyprus Grill was no disappointment.
Two souvlaki's; one chicken, one lamb, was our choice and both turned out delicious with very fresh ingredients, although maybe lacking a little in the quantity of meat. Liked the offering of whole wheat wrap bread for a token amount more. Also impressed by the Greek salad that was offered for $1.95 when ordering the souvlakis. Tantalizing taste with the feta cheese, great dressing and perfectly fresh salad makings.

Will return another time and highly recommended."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant.
As a Greek Cypriot myself, I was pretty excited when I saw this place move in down the street. 
The food is amazing, and the owners are truly great people.
If you like Greek food, you'll love Cyprus Grill."}
{"text":"Went to Cyprus Grill for dinner.  I was excited by the fact that maybe this might be a bit different given that the owners are from Cyprus.  

We ordered a couple of appetizers and they were very average.  

We also order two entrees, the Moussaka and the Sheftalia Dinner Entrees and very disappointed in both.  The Moussaka was very average with no flavor and the Sheftalia kebabs had some flavor but we very salty.    

Overall, I think there are many better choices for Greek food in the valley."}
{"text":"I just want to say we are regular customers here.  The food is very nicely served and we really enjoy the food.  Overall we have had good service, really good food and a better atmosphere than most in this price range, which is pretty reasonable.  I agree with a review that the music seems a bit odd for a Greek theme but I believe they are a pretty well kept secret."}
{"text":"My wife and I wanted to try something different and found The Cyprus Grill through a friends reference and it was a welcome change to the same old Steak House, Chinese Buffets and other corporate chain restaurants. 
The staff was very nice and the food was Great, I especially liked the shrimp souvlaki and the seasonings were so refreshing and light. Definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our dining experience at Cyprus Grill.  Our entrees consisted of moussaka and the sheftalia dinner (Greek meatballs).  Both were large portions and they were excellent!  The moussaka was very tall - loaded with a good balance of meat and vegetables.  The eggplant and zucchini were both tender, but not mushy, and the potatoes had a nice crunch.  We were impressed with the selections on the children's menu, as well.  We have a picky eater, and there were three good options on the menu for her to enjoy:  pasta, chicken fingers, quesadillas.  This is a great family restaurant with something for everyone.  We were dining in on a busy Friday night, almost every table was occupied, but never did we feel ignored.  Great food, great staff and great Greek fries - Opa!!"}
{"text":"This was my third trip to this small, Mediterranean restaurant and it never disappoints. Large portions,  quick service and excellently prepared food are standard here. Just make sure you order the Greek fries.

I ordered the gyro plate and the lamb was very tender and seasoned perfectly.  My wife ordered a Spartan club and was equally impressed. We both loved the fries topped with feta. My plate also came with rice. All of this for around 30 bucks.

There are fancier places to eat in the Ocotillo area of Chandler, but it would difficult to find a better meal."}
{"text":"Our family loves Cyprus Grill and would like them to stay in business a long time:)  I love that their ingredients have consistently been fresh and simple.  The pitas are soft and hummus are soo yummy!  And they have the BEST fries!!!"}
{"text":"I thought the food was good for the price point.

We both had lamb souvlaki in pita bread (versus the alternative, a wrap).  The sandwich had many large, tender, juicy, pieces of lamb throughout.  The sauce in the sandwich was thin and not all that flavorful.  

We both also ordered the greek fries.  We were disappointed the fries were thin like one would get at a fast food restaurant.  They were mostly crisp, and heavily seasoned.  Perhaps too much. There wasn't a lot of feta on the fries and each piece of feta quite small crumbles.  It wasn't bad, but also it was hard to have the greek fries experience without biting into feta.  It was like feta sprinkle.

The entire plate lacked the presence of vegetables and onion.  Tiny pieces of tomato and cucumber were in the sandwich. That's it.

However, overall, because of the generous portion of lamb in a very fresh pita, for the price point, we gave it four stars."}
{"text":"This is our go-to place for excellent Greek food! The service isn't always the best though and they close way early on Sundays. But if you're looking for great Greek food, this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"Awesome service and outstanding food!

New To this area and this place has quickly moved to the top of our favs list!"}
{"text":"Greek fries are great, try the Spartan club too...the chicken and gyro pitas are also good"}
{"text":"I took out an order of Pork Souvlaki.  It was heavily herbed, which is OK with me, but the meat was really tough.  It's almost as if the meat had been pre-cooked and just finished off on the grill.

I had a side of falafel, but it was almost too salty to eat.

Other than that, the herbed rice and vinaigrette dressing were super flavorful.  Unfortunately, those are side dishes..."}
{"text":"I have to admit that I have some bias towards this new location of my favorite Greek restaurant here in Phoenix so bear with me.

It is always a pleasure to come and eat at Cyprus Grill and my wife and I do so on a nearly-weekly basis.  The owners are extremely nice and accommodating and both of their locations are quick to serve.  I love their pita and you cannot... repeat cannot eat here without getting the Greek fries.  The hummus is fresh and the pita bread is as well.

My other favorites here are the Greek Pita salad and the Calamari salad; both are generous portions and the dressing is very tasty without being overwhelming.  As for the desserts I have only had their baklava but it has always been fresh and well-presented.

I believe that they will soon have their liquor license so certainly that will probably only continue to expand their clientele base."}
{"text":"Good food. Owner closed the bar and will not reopen. This definitely changes feel of place and that is why 3 stars."}
{"text":"Excellent food! The chicken souvlaki was delicious - very good seasoning. The salad was simple but had tasty dressing. Rice was good but nothing special. My wife had a gyros plate which was very good, but not as good as the chicken in my opinion. We live close by and enjoy Greek food, so I hope this place stays in business.
As others have said, it's a bit more pricey than you might expect, but when you get delicious food (and a large enough portion), you can't complain too much!"}
{"text":"The veggie platter appetizer was perfect for 2 to share. I got the shrimp pita which was one of the daily specials. The shrimp was grilled with a delicate sauce. My husband got the portobello pita which he said was delicios. The service was excellent. The prices are reasonable.  We definitely will come back!"}
{"text":"Yum Yum Yum - I have been here several times and have been disappointed yes! Chicken is great, salad and rice! It's all good."}
{"text":"Love the food and the service is continually excellent.  Prices are reasonable (salad is a little pricy) never once a bad experience - I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I called and made a reservation on graduation night for HHS, and they said \"No Problem!\"  Even though the place wasn't packed, they had a place for six all ready for us when we arrived 10 minutes early.  We got extra-special attention from the owner and the waiter!  I love this place!

I have eaten lunch and dinner here about 3 times each, and everything on the menu is excellent!  The pork Souvlaki (grilled pork on skewers) was excellent, the gyro meat is always tasty and lean, and the chicken dinner is \"to-die-for\".  There's this mustard-like sauce that is so tasty, and not overwheming.  And, the chicken is so moist!

I hope more people eat here regularly, as I want this excellent restaurant to last in this location!"}
{"text":"Delicious kebabs and middle eastern food.   The lamb is my favorite.  Service is prompt and friendly and prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"We LOVE Cyprus Grill. We were so excited to see the new location open right near our home. This now makes our drive a lot less! It is a must try! The owners are also just the nicest people out there. Get the Greek Fries."}
{"text":"When we're in the mood for Greek food, this is our go-to place. Our favorites are the gyro pita and chicken souvlaki. The gyro meat is succulent and chicken is super flavorful!"}
{"text":"My wife is Greek and so we rarely go out for Greek food -- all too often it is greasy, heavy, and bland.  Cyprus Grill is an exception.  The food in this casual restaurant is fresh, healthy, and tasty.  We had gyros, sheftalia (meatball) pita, Greek fries, salads, and everything was good.  The restaurant itself is clean and attractive and the service super friendly.  The owner seemed personally invested in every diner and every meal.  Overall, this is a comfortable place to hang out and enjoy a meal that will leave you feeling good.  We will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Two words: Greek Fries! Unbelievable! And the rest of the menu is equally as good. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Nice lunch. A friend of my husbands who is Greek raved about the PHX location so we were heading out that way when I looked online and found the Chandler location. Nice place but oddly I found the chairs were really uncomfortable, how random, right? 

After reading the reviews here I went with the chicken souvlaki pita with greek fries. The chicken was marinated perfectly. Tzatziki (sp?) was good but not as garlicky as I hoped, the cucumbers were crunchy and fresh, I would have preferred more dill too but good. The pita bread was as it should be, fresh, soft ,warm, slightly chewy. The greek fries were super tasty but just too bad (healthwise) for me to eat very much of. They use frozen string fries which I love, super crispy, with lemon and very finely chopped feta. Everyone enjoyed them even the kids but next time I'd get the greek salad which was super fresh. The biggest thing that bothered me was the plate my food was served on was chipped in several places, big chips - why? You weren't busy just two other tables, couldn't I get a good plate?

My husband got the moussaka plate with rice, greek salad, pita and tzatziki. He enjoyed it but having Greek friends and traveled to Greece he said it wasn't the best he had and it was a small portion. 

The boys had pasta with alfredo sauce which was very good. A nice experience but I think we will give the Phoenix location a shot next time we are craving Greek food.

Editing to add: Very, very nice service!

Can I give a 3.5?"}
{"text":"Went to Cypress Grill for lunch yesterday and thought is was very good.  Very good food & very good service.  My wife had the special strawberry salad and I had the greek salad with gyro meat and both were excellent.  The portions were nice and large, too.

Definitely going to put Cypress Grill on our rotation of restaurants to return to.  We'll probably go back for dinner next and try the lamb chop, which our waiter recommended highly.  If dinner is as good as lunch, we'll up our rating to 5-stars!"}
{"text":"The food here is the best Greek food I've had in Arizona. The prices aren't too bad and the service was great. They are really fast too!!"}
{"text":"Must be a bad night. Food is nothing special. It was dark in the restaurant. Wine was not good. Chips in salad were over cooked. I really don't  feel they know what they are doing."}
{"text":"This 2-star rating is based on the level of customer service received rather than our impression of the food. 

We ordered a pick-up order directly through Yelp. The full menu was available and it seemed very easy and convenient. My husband chose the gyro dinner. When we selected his side, he chose a pork souvlaki skewer which added $.95 to the order. I paid with my card, and the question about tip came up. I am on the fence about tipping on a pickup order, but I added a 10% tip anyway. 

When my husband picked up the order, he was asked for an additional $3 for the souvlaki! He explained and showed the emailed receipt that clearly added $.95 for the souvlaki. The customer service person told him \"well, we can't sell souvlaki for $.95!\"

My husband was faced with a dilemma. Argue about the 3 bucks, pay it, or...an option he wishes he had considered, tell them to take it out of the tip! He paid it, but just based on that $3, the business has likely lost a customer. 

Now for the food. My husband liked the lemon rice soup, but the gyro meat was not what he expected - grayish and flavorless. The Greek salad was a huge pile of lettuce with some chopped tomato and cucumber and 2 olives - not even close to an authentic Greek salad, although the menu did list lettuce first - my own mistake for expecting something else. However, all the elements of the vegetarian platter, given how measly it all looked sitting staring up from the styro container (the downside of takeout at any time), was tasty. The sauces popped with flavor, and I was happy with it all. The baklava...well, let's say there's an opportunity there. There was lots of phyllo, but almost none of the honey/buttery sweetness that oozes and makes good baklava what it is. In fact, my fingers weren't even sticky after handling 2 of the 4 little pieces, and a little pile of dry nuts were left in the container when we were done. A real miss. 

We probably won't return, which is a shame. Our practice is to give a place a couple of visits in case we happen to get a first dish that we're not fond of. The $3 ask at pick-up shows that the business is indifferent to whether we return or not. There are plenty of restaurants that value their patrons' impression and business. Those restaurants would have simply thanked us for bringing the incorrect pricing on the Yelp portal to their attention ... and would have also seen us back."}
{"text":"Our first visit. A bit quiet on a Monday night. Service was fast and friendly. Wife and I shared a hommus appetizer and Greek fries. We like our hommus with more zest i.e. garlic. Main courses were the gyro dinner and chicken souvlaki meal. Both were tasty with generous portions. We'll go back."}
{"text":"Great portion sizes, flavor wasnt great. Greek fries were ok. The rice tasted like a bland rice a roni. Only thing I really enjoyed was the Greek salad. I would give it another try, not bad but not great."}
{"text":"Tried their LAMB Pita- would recommend! Their Pita bread is up to par but nothing amazing. The lamb was a little dry but was cooked right and nonetheless delicous. The service was very friendly and we got our food in a timely fashion. Fries came with fetta and olive oil which was awesome. I've had better greek food from hole-in-the-walls but this place is not bad at all."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what is going I over there, but the quality of food is never the same on any given day. One day it is excellent, the next I swear I'm never going back. 
One big, big problem is the kids chicken fingers. They changed their recipe over a year ago (I'm guessing they started breading their own chicken instead of buying frozen). Anyway, every time we order take out, we get it home an the chicken is almost crispy black from the fryer. My child refuses to eat it, and personally I don't blame him. I wouldn't eat it either. I've told him we are not getting that meal there anymore because it is a waste of money. I end up having to make him something else to eat. I'm going to have to go next door to Paradise and order a grilled cheese. Furthermore, the last time we ordered take out, our gyros were cold. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"First off I've only ordered take out from this place so I can only review the quality of the food and not the service.  As far as the food goes it is very good!  I usually get the chicken breast dinner and it is always cooked just right.  The pita bread is almost always soft, warm, and chewy.  I also like the rice pilaf and the salad is fresh.  I've also tried the mousaka dinner and it is tasty although I do wish it came in a bigger portion.  The food is very good but I feel it is overpriced especially given the size of the portions.  Lucky for them there isn't much competition in the area to motivate them to lower their prices.."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of this place for some key reasons:
1- Ingredients look and taste fresh; they are not stingey with the good veggies either (like red bell peppers, red onions, olive oil, etc); Oh yeah and their portions are impressive (salads are HUGE, lavash wraps are HUGE).
2- The kitchen staff (which is visible from the seating area) is impressively quick (and accurate) - On more than several occasions, I have walked in and made a to-go order that is fulfilled in less than 7 minutes.
3- Prices are very good; Great for those that go out to eat on a daily/weekly basis (not me, I'm more of a 'cook at home' kinda gal).

Tip: Order the Lavash wrap (pick whatever you want inside: chicken, gyro, etc), but get the whole wheat lavash... NO one offers whole wheat lavash, but THEY do :)

Their Spartan Fries are yummy!  Stay away from the calamari appetizer.. I've had amazing fried calamari in the coast of CA and in Spain and this dish was shameful, sorry!! but true!!"}
{"text":"I loveeee this place! Such good food! Food always makes it to the table hot and fresh! Service is always great! Have never had an experience here that was anything less than great!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere leaves much to be desired, but the Greek fries are amazing and worth the trip alone!!"}
{"text":"Mmmm is all i can say bc my mouth is stuffed with delicious Dolmades. Highly recommend. The Falafel pita was really good as was the Spanko's. I ordered a carry-out and based on my experience I'm absolutely going back."}
{"text":"I was heading to Pei Wei when I saw this place and thought hummus sounded yummy. I ordered the veggie plate which came with hummus, tzatziki, falafal, spanakopita, dolmades and pita. This dish was gigantic. It could be shared by 3 people as an appetizer. I ate it for dinner though and took more than half of it home.

Their pita bread puts a known valley chain with pita in the name to shame. Seriously with a name like that, how can your pita bread taste like cardboard? Anyway, I digress... Cyprus Grill is amazing, and honestly why would you go anywhere else for delicious greek food?!"}
{"text":"A coworker of mine found this restaurant and invited me out for lunch. I have checked out the other greek restaurants around here and I must say this is THE BEST greek food that Chandler has to offer! Friendly, prompt service. Very impressed! Will go back again and again!"}
{"text":"Every thing was soggy and so bad. You can tell they buy their food frozen and warm it up. I can make better greek food at home. Thw greek fries were soggy"}
{"text":"We got two gyro sandwiches and greek fries to go. The sandwiches were great and only cost $6.95 per sandwich. Competitive to other takeout places such as Chipotle. The meat was not bland and had the right amount of \"salty-niss.\" The greek fries were different and pretty good if not for sitting for a 15 minute drive home and getting a little soggy. Overall we will definitely be back. Service was friendly and order was made fast. Food was done 2 minutes after ordering. Inside is quaint with white table cloths and a small bar. Nice family joint."}
{"text":"I found this little gem tucked away by my church a couple of months ago. Since then, I've eaten here at least two and three times a month.

The staff is very friendly and knowledgeable. 

My favorite go-to on the menu is the Greek Salad with chicken. It is so tasty and huge! I never have been able to finish it in one sitting and always end up taking the leftover chicken home. 

Also delicious? Their baklava. It is melt-in-your-mouth good.

I've taken many friends and family here after church and everyone has loved the place and added it to their list of restaurants to frequent.

Just writing this review, I'm now craving their yummy salad!"}
{"text":"The food wasn't very impressive. This corner eaterie  was a disappointment. I love all types of Mediterranean food. Its one of my favorite cuisines, but The Cypress Grill couldn't even match the tastes of Pita Jungle. I shared the chicken souvlaki entree. The dish came with 2 average sized kabobs of cubed chicken breast. The meat was lean, but it was marinated too long in a salty liquid with dry, store bought herbs. The rice was mostly tasteless and the tzatziki sauce came right out of a jar. Surprisingly, the salad was the most disappointing. Greek salad is so easy to make with a lemon viniagrette. I found the dressing too sweet to tolerate and the lettuce possessed a bitter quality not normally found in this type of lettuce mix. My son had the gyro platter. He said he liked the gyro meat and the rice but didn't touch the salad or tzatziki sauce. I won't be returning because you don't need to be fancy or expensive to offer good food. If I want kabob, I'll go ti Pita Souvli up the street, Pita Jungle a few miles away or hike up to Haji Baba for authentic souvlaki. The entire experience was sad considering I can walk to the Cypress Grill."}
{"text":"The food is definitely 5 stars, the dishes on every table inside and out is gross. The only table without dishes was outside, which is fine except I'm not a fan of eating with the birds."}
{"text":"Just a gyro and iced tea but treated like it was a 5 course meal. Gyro sandwich is so good-well wrapped and holds together and tastes so good. Service is so quick
 Like and do recommend."}
{"text":"This place is SOOO good!  I love their Mediterranean salad with Gyro meat.  The salad alone is delish even without the dressing, But the light dressing tops it off.  The gyro meat here is so tender and flavorful and their pitas are fluffy."}
{"text":"Best chicken breast pita and greek fries are amazing!  Service has always been friendly and quick."}
{"text":"Awesome restaurant with great food. Their gyros are so amazing and they don't cheap out on the meat. I just wish they were open more. Especially on the weekends. Sometimes they're closed even when they're supposed to be open but I can't get mad after eating the food."}
{"text":"To this day, this is still my favorite restaurant. I live in California now but this restaurant was on the too of my \"things I'll miss about Arizona\" list  Here's why: 

- greek fries are THE BEST! The fries are shoestring style and always a perfect golden crispy, which is perfect for the lemon and feta topping they out on as it never gets soggy! I can eat a whole order of this by myself...
- the bruschetta! The tomatoes are perfectly seasoned or marinated or whatever! I have no clue what they do to make it have so much flavor but seriously, it's like crack
- the gyros! Around $6 and sooo so worth the money. They're generous with the tzatzika and have the perfect ratio of veggies to pita to gyro meat. Yummm
- lastly, the greek salad with gyro! For those of you trying to be a bit more healthy, this is perfect bc you can still enjoy the gyro meat without the extra carbs from the pita bread (although they do give you pita on the side). And it's HUGE! And worth the extra money you pay for the gyro. Plus they have pepperoncinis! Mmm... 
- the staff! So friendly! And they knew me and my family because we were there so often! A couple of the waiters and waitresses stand out as exceptionally personable because of how often they check in. And the food comes fairly quick as well :)"}
{"text":"Ate here tonight and loved the Greek fries. Also enjoyed the veggie combo. Will be back either for take out or to dine in!"}
{"text":"This place is great! Fast, friendly service. Fresh food with good quality meat and totally fair prices. The artichoke spinich dip is awesome! I would stick with the gyros + salad instead of the meals."}
{"text":"We went here on the recommendation of my girlfriend's co-worker, who is Greek.  It's outstanding.  We got the veggie combo, and that's a great way to start.  The dolmades and hummus are the highlights, for me.  The avgolemono soup is awesome.  We've been there twice in the past week, and I've had the sheftalia and the pork souvlaki (the pork souvlaki is to die for - very flavorful).  The service and atmosphere is great.  I can't think of a critical thing to say.  Delicious food."}
{"text":"The place is simple. There isn't anything fancy with the decor alot of tables and chairs like one or two booths. You definitely go for the food.  We started the spinach artichoke dip. The dip was kinda pureed and very good the  pitas were warm and had a lite butter taste. I got the spartan club and the gyro meat was tender and not over cooked. My wife got a chicken ceaser that's was tender and the bowl was big enough to serve 3. We will be going back"}
{"text":"I feel really lucky to live close to several very good Greek restaurants and I think Cyprus Grill is my favorite.  The staff is always friendly and the food is delicious!  My favorites are the calamari and the chicken souvlaki.  The breading on the calamari is so light and crunchy.  They fry that just right.  

The chicken souvlaki always has a wonderful smoky grilled flavor that I can't get enough of.  I should try other things on the menu, because I'm sure they are all good, but I get the chicken almost every time.

My husband has had their gyro and we've shared the Spartan club before and both are great as well.  I almost forgot about the Greek fries!  Oh yeah!  You have to try those all smothered in sauce and seasoning and feta.  Perfect with a cold beer.  

I've dined in twice, but now we just do their online ordering and get the food to go so we can save money and go home and drink our own booze, but Cyprus does have some good happy hour specials and I love that they have a good selection of Mediterranean beverages, but they also support the local brewers.  

The only thing I would change is I wish when I ordered the souvlaki to go, they wouldn't put the salad in the same container as the hot food.  That's it.  It's not a huge deal because we live so close, but still, it would be nice to not have the lettuce starting to wilt by the time we dig in.   Overall, this is one of our favorite neighborhood places."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed in my visit because of the food. We had gyros and the meat was bland and soft like it was not cooked long enough. It also did not have enough meat on it. The pita was soft as it should be but that cold not make up for the meat. Not a great experience because of the gyro quality."}
{"text":"Great food - reasonable prices - the lamb was exceptional as well as the pork souvlaki. Rice and salad were also exceptional - definitely a return visit is in order."}
{"text":"This place is okay.  I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here but I would consider eating here again.  I thought it was a little expensive for what you got.  We had a greek salad which I asked for the dressing on the side and did not get.  The salad over all was good and I would get it again.  We had grilled chicken with rice and French fries and should have probably gotten the salad instead of fries, it would of been a better combo."}
{"text":"Best greek fries ever, I haved tried them at numerous restaurants throughout the county and none come close. All the dishes I have tried are flavorful and well balanced. Too bad they moved from the Biltmore area so far East."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times now and have had the gyro. I'm no gyro expert but that is the best gyro that I have ever had. The place is very clean and the staff is fast and polite. I recently had the Spartan Club due to the recommendations on here. Now that's a damn good sandwich! You gotta try this place out."}
{"text":"We come here for lunch sometimes on the weekends.  There is usually no wait and the food is really good.  I love the gyro pita and greek fries.  Their hummus and baklava are also very yummy!  

It is table service and their staff is helpful and attentive.  I drink a lot of iced tea, and they were very prompt with refills.  

My understanding is they are family owned and operated.  They sometimes have a soccer game on, but never too loud in my experience if you are not interested in the game.

The pricing was really reasonable in my opinion for lunch."}
{"text":"I brought a client here from out of town.  Not only was the restaurant filthy, the food was just ok and the service was horrible. I was very embarrassed!  Never again!"}
{"text":"A warm welcome from staff. The food of gyros platter and dolmades was delicious, all washed down with a icy drink of ouzo. Came back for Gyro was good, getting extra tzasiki sauce helps. Greek salad lacking. The lettuce chopped up in little pieces for sandwiches and not salad. The olives were small with large pits (no warning of pits). Feta cheese in the salad was grated and lacked bite. Thanks for reading. The Bike Chaplain (aka Zorba..:)"}
{"text":"I was not expecting my Gyro sandwich to be this good! This was the best Gyro I've ever had so far! Must try!"}
{"text":"Healthy options and great owner always willing to go the extra mile."}
{"text":"First time here. Cute little restaurant that smells really good when you walk in.   Clean in appearance. Tonight at 6pm there is only one waitress who is serving inside and outside.  She is also handling the take out orders.  She is attentive when you flag her down. The food was outstanding  and my portion was so big I  had to take some home.  I don't want  to say this restaurant was wonderful, because I'm afraid I won't be able to get a table next time we come back, but it was.  Only 4 stars because  they do need more wait staff."}
{"text":"This place is near our house and Mediterranean food sounded good. So we tried it and we weren't disappointed! We had the Falafel pita, the grilled chicken dinner with salad and rice and the Greek fries. All of it was very fresh and delicious! The service was good as well! We will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Love everything about Cypress Grill.  My entire family loves this place.  That's hard to do with 11 of us   The Salmon is so fresh.  The food is seasoned amazing. And the service is always perfect.  Every time I've been the owner is always there and comes by to check on us to make sure our visit was satisfactory.  I like the atmosphere for dinner or lunch. Highly recommend Cypress Grill."}
{"text":"My wife introduced me to this place and I absolutely love it!  I am hooked on their Greek Salad with Gyros.  I do not dine in often abut utilize their take out service as it is quick and just as delicious."}
{"text":"After reading all of the positive reviews, we were stoked.  All I can say after eating there is that people here in AZ have no ability to discern good food from food that is merely different. 
The dining experience did not start out well.  The table had been wiped off after the previous diners, but it was still greasy.  We ordered wine and the wine glasses had some film on them, maybe from being rinsed in water that was not clean?
We ordered the calamari and Greek Fries as appetizers.  The calamari were VERY dry.  I had the feeling they were cooked earlier and kept warm.  The fries were pretty unique but the lemon sauce they were served on was waaaay too tart.
The biggest problem with the meal was when our entrees were brought to the table only 2 - 3 minutes after we got the appetizers.  My husband's comment to the wait person was met with little more than a shrug, although later on she did say that the kitchen had the food ready too quickly.
The entrees (gyros sandwich, chicken souvlaki, Greek salad with grilled chicken) were just OK.  All of us felt that the food was not hot, further supporting the thought that everything was prepared in advance and reheated.  The seasoning were nicely done, however.
It's a safe bet we'll be looking elsewhere the next time we have a taste for Greek food."}
{"text":"Tried this place after the restaurant next door was packed. Had read reviews on it thought give a try. Had shrimp pasta dish and chicken breast. Both unremarkable and borderline bad. Won't be back as there are several other Greek options in the neighborhood  which are much better."}
{"text":"Quite a fan of this place. It was pretty quiet while we were there, but the server was able to recommend a good Greek beer, and the food was pretty darn tasty. We'll be going back!"}
{"text":"Took hubby here for his birthday (he had been before & was his choice). I told the cashier (who might also be the owner/manager?) that we were there to celebrate my husband's birthday & she offered to bring out a dessert at the end of our meal. Nice! 

We ordered the greek fries (tasty & different!), and I had the chicken souvlaki pita.  It was good but I found the chicken a little dry. They brought out the complimentary dessert (baklava) which my husband is a huge fan of.  Their espresso machine wasn't working so they let me go down to Starbucks a few doors down to bring back coffees for the dessert. 

They have a full bar set up, might come back for dinner one night."}
{"text":"We were visiting from out of town and found this place on Yelp. The food was very fresh and had great flavor. We had the gyro dinner. It was clean and since they do not serve alcohol were several families eating there. We would go back"}
{"text":"Really good food. I got a Greek salad with gyro meat along with greek fries and it was tasty. Large portions too!"}
{"text":"Traditional music, you can watch the cooks make your food and its seat yourself. Great food in a very casual setting! Kind of difficult to see from the road, it's behind chase on alma school and queen creek."}
{"text":"I love this place! People are very friendly and very clean restaurant. I come here with co workers for lunch on a weekly basis. I order a gyro pita and side of Greek fries, so delicious! The salads are huge and tasty as well. The Greek fries are amazing with feta cheese and a lemon butter sauce they put over the fries. I can eat here everyday!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place but I've been there 3 times now and I just can't recommend it. The people are great but the food is just so-so and not worth the price. I've tried the chicken kabobs twice now and they were overcooked both times. My husband tried the pasta and it was overcooked as well. He originally ordered a feta burger but they were out of them at 6pm on a Friday night. The hummus is good although a little thin. I prefer Greeks Grill on Alma School to this place as the food is better and less pricey."}
{"text":"Great place. Pleasant workers. Food was delicious and very reasonable prices. 
I went these with my fellow friends right after work and we were in our scrubs and Our waitress was amazing. She came to our table to greet us and thanked us for our services in helping people. 
This place had a positive vibe def recommend it for everyone. Will be back again soon ;)"}
{"text":"Had the Spartan Club with a side salad. Felt like a full warrior when I left."}
{"text":"This place is still great! One word: consistency! Every single time we eat here the food is excellent! :)"}
{"text":"I am back to say

THIS PLACE IS SO GOOD

Still have not let me down. Lunch or dinner, always consistent."}
{"text":"This place has really good Greek Food! I had the gyro w/ fries and started with the spinach artichoke dip. Everything is fresh and you can definitely tell in every bite!"}
{"text":"Last night we ordered take out, chicken Greek salad, Greek fries and the chicken entree. Over all, chicken was very dry/over done. The salad was decent with the amount of vegetables. I knew ordering Greek fries for take out could be a gamble, not as concerned about the disappointment in those, as the other two items. Most likely not to return."}
{"text":"We wanted something delicious and somewhat healthy after a hike, so we stopped at Cyprus Grill. I had a falafel pita that was pretty good, with a greek salad on the side that was fresh and flavorful. 
We shared some Greek fries and they are AMAZING! I have never heard of Greek fries (fries w/ lemon, feta and spices) but I'm mad I've gone so long never trying them. YUM.
Service was fast and the staff was very friendly (and seem authentic Greek, which is always nice extra)"}
{"text":"Had to try out Cyprus Grill finally. Ordered the Chicken Souvlaki and Greek Fries combo meal for lunch.

The chicken was cooked well and it was surrounded by fresh veggies and a great sauce. The Greek Fries were different than the ones I have seen in the photos (crinkle cut fries instead of straight). They still tasted pretty good and with a heavy lemon taste (pretty refreshing instead of feeling heavy).

Overall, would definitely hit this place up again in the future."}
{"text":"Bang for buck. Good food, healthy and tasty. I ate a chicken salad wrap with hummus and tzatziki. Nice flavor. My new lunch place."}
{"text":"We were sent a postcard for a free appetizer, but we singed up for their email list online for a 10% discount and used that instead. I ordered the Lamb Souvlaki platter and my wife got the Gyro platter. The lamb was cooked to perfection. It came with a greek side salad, Tzatziki, lemony rice, and some pita.  They have a great selection of beers for a small strip mall restaurant. The ambience is very sparse and doesnt reflect the lofty prices for some of the items on the menu. Even though they have a bar, this is not a location for socializing. Its all about eating here. I wouild return for the food (or perhaps this is best for take-out), I enjoyed it."}
{"text":"This is a really great place! The food is really awesome! Would for sure come back to try something else! Looking forward to the next time! They also serve liquor here if someone wants a cocktail! I had the gyros and garlic parmesan fries,  a must have!!!"}
{"text":"My parents took me here for lunch on my recent visit because they were offering special $4 gyros and they said they were really good. Apparently a lot of others got the text about the special too, as the place was pretty busy! They seem to know how to control the lunch crowd- the line went pretty quick. We ordered 3 to go and went home to eat them.

These gyros were VERY good. The pita was warm, soft and fluffy. There was crisp leafy green lettuce and a diced cucumber/tomato mixture in it that I wish I could have had as a side! The meat was very flavorful and not too greasy, which I appreciated. The gyro was big enough for my dad and I to split (we weren't extremely hungry), but one would definitely fill you up.

I would love to return to Cyprus Grill to try an entree...if their other food is as good as the gyro, this place could be dangerous!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and I think it gets better each visit! I decided to try the Greek salad with salmon, it was beautiful and delicious! I would've taken a picture but unfortunately it flew into my mouth before I could get a chance, sorry guys. Stop by for lunch, you'll be glad you did!"}
{"text":"Decent food, great tasting , good ingredients, a bit salty for my grand parents whom I took with me. Overall service was above satisfactory. Will go Back. They also have great deals (beer) for football games and a big screen and projector to watch the game."}
{"text":"Nice little place. Enjoyed every bite of my dinner. We ordered pork , and pita with lamb , both were good. Service and speed was excellent . If you local you should visit it"}
{"text":"Hmmm, the sign outside Cyprus in Chandler says they open at 11, so why did they open at noon today?  Screwed up my date and so we ran over to Grimaldi's instead."}
{"text":"Quick review:
- Tasty gyro sandwich!
- Definitely get the Greek fries.
- Reasonably priced."}
{"text":"FINALLY! With the closing of all the Big Fat Greek restaurants and an endless number of shopping center Greek wannabees, we have found an honest to goodness, I can't wait to go back Greek (Cyprus) place on the East side of Phoenix. Our late lunch was delicious. Everything tasted just like it is supposed to. The olives salty and tart, the fresh crumbled feta covered salad with just the right amount of dressing, I had a traditional gyro sandwich with salad  and my wife had a Shaslik lamb gyro with fries. After our local Greek restaurant in Salt Lake City closed in 2004, we have been looking for a weekly Greek lunch-dinner restaurant and at last we have found it. This is the first time since we moved here in 2011 that all of our order was actually eaten. We are really looking forward to going back. Think I will ask them if they can do Halloumi Cheese Skewers with Mushrooms and Sweet Onions. Tonight I will be call my brother in Delta, UT and tell them \"WE FOUND A GREEK RESTAURANT!\". 
Glad we moved close to Queen Creek as this is right up there with our \"BEST ITALIAN\" find in Queen Creek. The owners recently returned from Cyprus and greeted us like family and when I mentioned Halloumi Cheese, she asked how come I knew about it. Thanks PBS and your recent Cheese Lovers Special."}
{"text":"Great little joint.  Value was great.  Try their spartan club - it's like a club sandwich between pita bread."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on March 20, 2012.  I was in town for spring training with my five year old son.  We needed something quiet because he had had a long day.

When we got to the restaurant at about 6:00, it was pretty empty.  The hostess / server was very friendly and seated us right away.  I was pleased to see they have a kid's section on the menu.

My son wanted penne pasta with red sauce.  I opted for the Greek salad with gyro meat.  The pasta was typical kid's meal stuff, but my son ate the whole thing.  The salad was big with a lot of gyro meat on top.  The ingredients were fresh, and the whole thing was pretty good.

I wanted to try some of their beers, but I passed because I was driving with the kid.  When I am back in the area, I will have to give them a try."}
{"text":"Supremely tasty food and a surprisingly good collection of draft beers. A nice, quiet atmosphere with good service makes for a solid combination. Despite other similar restaurants in the area, if it's Greek we're longing for, this is the place we come. We have yet to be disappointed. They also do take out, too."}
{"text":"We come in every few months and each time there is something odd about the place.  Tonight was no exception.  When we arrived, there were two occupied tables. The hostess/server was assisting a take-out patron.  After two minutes she told us to seat ourselves.  After 7 more minutes, the bartender/server brought menus to us.  I attempted to order iced tea, to be told they were out.  How do you run out of iced tea in AZ?  I asked for some hot tea and a glass of ice and I would make my own.  The avegolemono soup was excellent.  We ordered a gyros plate and a gyros sandwich with Greek fries.  There was more meat on the sandwich than on the plate (that was almost twice the price).  When we ordered the gyros plate we said we didn't want rice; the server suggested the Greek fries instead; instead of getting salad and fries with the gyros, we received rice AND Greek fries, no salad.  The Greek fries ordered with the gyros sandwich never was served, until we reminded them.  Overall, the service was crazy, the food was served incorrectly and why would there be more gyros meat on the sandwich than on the entrée plate???  Despite it all, the food tasted good.  For that we might return, but it will be a while...Regarding the atmosphere, can't quite figure it out.  There was a large a/v screen on one wall (maybe meetings during the day).  And we were a bit surprised that a white tablecloth restaurant would then have paper napkins.  The best word for Cyprus Grill:  inconsistent."}
{"text":"Spartan Club is Truly Unique and fantastic!"}
{"text":"Stopped by today 5/23/17 for our gyro fix and it was closed and it appears to be out of business. 
We will miss this restaurant we thought they were doing well."}
{"text":"It's been awhile since we were here but wanted to review. The food wasn't bad. I felt it would be better as a order at the counter type of place. I thought our bill was high for the type of setting it was."}
{"text":"They have the best Avgalemeno soup ever!!! Chicken broth with lemon and rice, delicious when you have a cold or need a good bowl of soup. The gyros are amazing and the Greek fries are dangerously good. I wish the prices were a little lower, expect to spend $25/30 for 2 people with no alcohol, in a casual seat yourself atmosphere with no waiters."}
{"text":"Are at a few Greek places and I gotta admit this it's my favorite one. Service it's good and food is great."}
{"text":"I finally was able to try the Cyprus grill and I have to say I'm glad I did. Tried the Gyro sandwich with fries. No complaints Great flavor and filling enough that I didn't eat dinner that evening. My daughter had the lemon chicken with rice and found it to be the perfect combination. I tried her chicken and it is vey good. Drinks come in large cups, so you won't need a refill right away. I had the iced tea and it's very good.
This place is vey clean and the service was very good since my family and I were the only ones in there on a late Sunday afternoon.
We'll be back!"}
{"text":"My husband and I stumbled upon this place while looking for a place to eat one evening. I'm more adventurous than he is about food, but even he was thrilled with the food and the service. 
A couple of times, we have been served by the owner who is wonderfully hospitable and charming. 
My husband consistently orders the daily special and has never once been disappointed. I usually order the gyro, which is truly the best gyro I have ever had. I just can't help myself - I crave it now. 
We have been back half a dozen times already and I was also inspired to try their other location when I was in the neighborhood recently. 
So thankful to have something that is not a chain restaurant to chose from in the area. We'll be back many times."}
{"text":"Our local \"greek\" place. We are there at least once a week for lunch eating their delicious gyro pitas and greek fries and once in a while we have the uber-delicious and very filling Moussaka! Although there are plenty of other great item on the menu."}
{"text":"Great Food and very Clean if you like eating healthy!  Owner is super cool!  I always get the chicken Kabob plate with side salad and Hummus! YUM!!

Not cheep but ive learend that you usually get what you pay for!"}
{"text":"Since they opened we have been ordering in or to go every chance we get. We love bringing friends here as well and they can't stop talking about it. They have mouth watering gyros, awesome Greek fries topped with the right amount of oil and feta, chicken souvlaki is my son's favorite, and on the lighter side, I love their Greek salad with grilled salmon. Perfection every time. Always friendly and truly accommodating. Haven't tried their happy hour yet but I'm sure it's worth checking out."}
{"text":"Went in for lunch today.  The sign at the door says please seat yourself. There was one other table there....not busy at all.  No one came to greet me or get me a menu after 5 minutes. I left and went to Keegan's Grill. I won't be going back. I'll just go to the Ivy a block north if I want Greek."}
{"text":"Yayyyyy!!!  There is a new Cyprus Grill in Chandler!  Now I can eat here for lunch and enjoy the one in Phoenix while at home.  

When you walk in you are greeted by the host and given the option to sit where you want.  You can see the food prep area which is behind a really nice glass counter.  To the left is a bar where you can wait for takeout or have a bite to eat while watching a game on their big screen lcd.  To the right is the main seating area consisting of a couple booths, tables, and a high top bar with stools.  In front of the restaurant is a small patio where you can sit and eat.

The menu is identical to the Phoenix location and everything is just as delicious and fresh.  I took some coworkers here and everyone loved it.  Of course, the big hit was the Greek Fries but if we go again I will order the Spartan Club so I can show them what it's all about: tons of gyro and chicken along with some fresh veggies sandwiched between 2 pieces of pita bread.  I also like the souvlaki skewers, and usually order the chicken souvlaki dinner which comes with rice and a side salad although I think you can sub the Greek Fries.

Service is excellent .  You can catch the owner, who's from Cyprus, most of the time.  What a great guy!  Him and this restaurant are a class act, the food is great, and it is in a great location."}
{"text":"We've been coming here about once a month since they opened and typically get take out. Their service is good and always ready quick but the food has been lacking. Tonight we ordered a gyro dinner with fries. The fries tasted old and the pita was like a soggy steamed bun. They gyro meat in my dinner plate and my husband gyro pita were very dry and tasted like it'd been sitting out. I was disappointed. In the past the food has always tastes hot and fresh. I hope the food standards go back the quality they are known for."}
{"text":"The flavor of the meat (both lamb and chicken) was amazing.  The tzatziki and humus were ordinary.  The Greek fries were pretty good.  The Greek potatoes were not so much.  

Good service and conveniently located.  

Priced a little high for the overall experience."}
{"text":"SO WHAT IF IT'S NOT AUTHENTIC! The table service is nice in the small interior and outdoor patio. The music was Greek unlike the last review I read. My lady and I were stuffed after appetizers, beer and olives we had to take our food to go. The fallafel wasn't burnt to crisp like most places, the tzakiki was smoother and more refreshing than I've tried here locally in Arizona. Arizona doesn't have a lot to offer in regards to any good Greek food. I'm happy to say I would come back here and eat their dolmades and spinach stuffed crispy goodness. 

I read a lot of animosity for this place but my lady instisted we at least try it and I'm glade. If anything is taken away from my review is that you can't always have authentic food. We are in the reparian desert people. This is really good. Yes I've had better in other countries and at Greek festivals. This is available year round for those insatiable cravings. 

Only down side is I still can't find fish roe, taromasalta. The search goes on."}
{"text":"I was on my way to Paradise Bakery when this restaurant caught my attention. Looks nice and tidy and the gentleman who took my order seems so friendly and confident about the food they serve. He said that they have Chicken Slovaki which is somewhat the same like Chicken Shwarma. I had a good lunch and it was OK."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite Chandler restaurants! What a great find for fresh great tasting Greek Food! The owners are wonderful and really make you feel like you are eating in a Greek Cafe. The checker table really gives it an authentic touch! My son loves the hummus and pita, but my fav is the gyros sandwich with salad combo. The salads are great if you are a vegetarian and their dressing is to die for!"}
{"text":"Love the Greek fries! Smaller restaurant but speedy service and portions are huge. Perfect for a girls night. The staff could be a lil friendly or more engaged."}
{"text":"I know middle eastern food since I cook it a lot at home. This place was very good. I recommend the pita sandwiches and plates. The food is plentiful and cooked fresh. I will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"*****STAY AWAY... THIS PLACE IS PATHETIC ****
Poor service and food. Not Greek owned. A pretender.. they play latino music in a \"greek restaruant\"...  The food is not authentic and atmosphere is uncomfortable. Not particularly clean and the service is very slow. Dont waste your time."}
{"text":"We love this place! Try the Greek fries (lemony and delicious) and Spartan Club has it all (pita,gyro meat and chicken) when you can't decide. Owners are friendly and genuine and your food is delivered very quickly."}
{"text":"I love the owners.  Very friendly and accomodating.  One night we had called after they had closed, and were pleasantly surprised when someone answered.  Turns out they were hosting a private party.  They agreed to take our order, which made us pretty happy.

I adore their Greek fries.  Olive oil, lemon, and the perfect amount of fetta.  Been here several times for lunch, and always leave happy.  Looking forward to meeting friends here for happy hour."}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place! I could live my life on Greek food, so when the Daphne's in this spot closed down, I was sad, not because the food was good but it was walking distance from my home and open late. When this place opened up, I was ecstatic. 

And the food is good.  I always get the Veggie sampler plate, and it's awesome. Rarely is there such a large spanakopita on such platters. The portion is great!

The lemon-rice soup is nice. I've also tried their wraps, falafel is my fave. The pesto portabella wrap is not exactly Greek, but the pesto is fresh and they don't skimp. We love mousaka, but their eggplant version has beef."}
{"text":"The food is really good but they definitely have cleaning and bussing issues. They let dirty tables sit and sit. If you like to eat among filth, eat here."}
{"text":"I used to eat here a lot when I lived in AZ. It was a great place. Good Greek food. I almost always got the Spartan club. Which was a huge sandwich with chicken, gyro meat, tomato, and other great stuff. It was a nice alternative to some of the surrounding greasy and heavy food."}
{"text":"I  went to Cyprus Grill on a Sunday afternoon, when I got there; not many people were in the restaurant. me and my family were seated right away. It is a nice little restaurant that serves authentic Greek and Mediterranean food. I'd say it could sit around 50 people with its interior and outdoor patio.  It was decorated very nicely with artificial flowers and trees. Though I can't remember all the colors there were shades of green and blue. There is a large flat screen TV that was playing preseason football on it which was nice considering I'm a football fan. 

The menu had a variety of choices and I personally love Mediterranean food so everything on the menu looked appetizing to me. We had Greek style chicken wings for an appetizer which the sauce was very tasty due to its lemon flavor and mixed herbs. It was just so good that I could have eaten the whole thing by myself. The main meal I had was  the Lamb Souvlaki and I also got  Greek fries with it. I was in for a treat. The lamb was so tender and the taste was homemade, but they put a little bit to much sauce on it. To my surprise I liked it a lot more because of the extra sauce. I was able to dip the pita bread in the sauce which made it more delicious. I was so full that I couldn't finish my French fries. Even the next day, the French fries were still excellent  microwaved. The baklava for dessert was delicious.

The restaurant was well kept and clean.The service could have been a little quicker but the authentic food and fair prices made up for it. The variety of the menu in its appetizers, pita sandwiches, sides, pasta, salads and desserts were great that I would come again to try something different. I would recommend for everyone to come eat lunch or dinner at Cyprus Grill."}
{"text":"We used to love this place, would eat here maybe once a month or so.  These last few times however, not sure if it's just the luck of the draw, if there's new owners, new cooks, new recipes or what - but the food quality has taken a serious nose dive.  The last time we ate there (we both had the chicken souvlaki) we honestly got sick - vowed to never go back.."}
{"text":"Have been a customer since day one and they never disappoint! We love the Spartan Club, anything with the perfectly grilled chicken and of course the gyros. Just wish the ambiance was a bit cozier."}
{"text":"Had them cater my mom's birthday.  No frills atmosphere but the lemon rice soup and Dolmades are the best I've had.  Greek salad is different but good.   Hummus is decent the spanakopita is good as well.  I frequent this place often.  It's healthy and consistent."}
{"text":"I ordered the gyros and was impressed. The meat was moist and the pita bread was just right. I also had the Greek fries. Found my greek spot to eat."}
{"text":"The best Greek food in all of Arizona! We moved to California but we still manage to come to Arizona  4 times a year and every time we visit we eat it twice!!"}
{"text":"The food was ok, but the service was very scattered. There were only 4 tables occupied and it still took forever to put our order in because of all of the take out people coming in and getting priority. The servers also had no idea what beers they were serving (the tap handles didn't match the actual beer)."}
{"text":"Excellent fresh, colorful, tasty food.  The Greek salads we had were very flavorful and pleasing to the eye.  The gyro my wife had was great, and the stuffed pita with pork I had was very tasty and cooked perfectly, easy to overcook. They have Kilt Lifter and wine for those who partake.  We are definitely coming back."}
{"text":"I love this place! The Greek fries are my favorite. My husband and I have been going here for years. The owners and employees are all very nice and work very hard.   The prices are decent and I have never had to wait too long for service or food. Would highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"The only thing missing is wine:-((  BUT The food was GREAT!  Service even better.  Wonderful salads!  Definitely GO!"}
{"text":"The  hostess is a honey, foods just above average, annoying having to wait in line without a menu to read."}
{"text":"I have been here numerous times and enjoyed the food.... but lately the amount of salt is sky high in the dishes, especially the lemon soup.
So bad this time I had to throw it out."}
{"text":"Food was OK,, but I had better gyros at Chandler Fashion Mall. Much more meat there.  Here, not so much.  The Greek wings were very good and the Humus was tasty as well.  I will try it again, just to see."}
{"text":"Gyro Pita sandwich and Fried Calamari for lunch! The calamari came with fresh lemon wedges for squeeezin' and a delicious marinara sauce for dippin'...you got no complaints. The crunch was just the right amount, and the flavor was mild, not overly fishy :) The Gyro was yum-gasm(!), soft, warm pita wrap overflowing with deliciously-spiced gyro meat, diced cukes, green lettuce, tomatoes...all swimming in tzatziki dressing. Your mouth, it not belief!!!
And the Greek fries, this was a special treat. I enjoyed them so much that I'm not going to write about them; words cannot describe. You might lick the plate, ok? We ate outdoors and there are some local birds that are fans of this place too, they are not unfriendly - just quite used to humans giving them munchies, so be aware :)"}
