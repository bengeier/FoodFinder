{"text":"This was the worst food I've ever had. I ordered to-go and not only did they get my entire order wrong and the food was awful, they charged me double for it. Do not recommend!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent selection of well prepared Sushi.  Nice atmosphere that is definitely a bit \"Clubby\" as somebody previously mentioned."}
{"text":"One of charlotte's must go restaurants for and great food. The owner/hostess will insure you have great experience with your friends. While they service you top notch sushi in a NY esque atmosphere. Always' a lively place on thud-sat."}
{"text":"Wow! Not only was the food off the charts but the atmosphere was perfect. I had the pleasure of meeting Joanna aka sushi mamma who sat down and ordered for our table. Joanna really has it figured out. The detail put into her food and the pride in her craft is unprecedented. Joanna, thank you for a wonderful experience. Lenny,baby joey,Jonny san,joker face,and Pett."}
{"text":"One of my all time favorites! Incredible atmosphere very upscale and beautiful restaurant.  Amazing sushi !"}
{"text":"My first experience ever at Nikko's and it was awful! Coming into the restaurant I was greeted by the hostess, who wore a tube top; what kind of nice restaurant would let any worker where a tub top besides a club or a bar!! We eventually seated at around 6:45pm and order appetizers that didn't come out until an hour later when everyone in my party was starving. We didn't get refills on any of our beverages and when I order wine the waitress didn't asked for an ID. When we finally put in our entrees our food didn't come out until an hour afterwards; on top of that our food was cold by the time it got to our table. Everyone was upset and didn't even touch their meals. Even when I talked to the manager he raised his voice and couldn't comprehend what I was telling him, I already know sushi is cold! But my entree was not suppose to be!!  After that brief session the manager stormed off from our conversation and yelled JESUS. Very rude and unprofessional business. The ten people at my party will never come back again nor will they recommend this place to anyone else."}
{"text":"Delicious food. We had the gyoza dumpling appetizers--my fav of the night! We also ordered the tempura fondue, which had tempura sticks of lobster, scallops, shrimp, and vegetables with a yummy, warm cheese dipping sauce. We ordered the bagel deluxe and the dragonfly sushi rolls. Both were excellent, though I was partial to the bagel deluxe because it had that more authentic sushi taste. I got an extra dirty Absolut martini and it was spot on, though the glass was only filled 2/3rds of the way. :( We waited about 30 minutes for a table even though we had a reservation. We went on Friday night and the place was hopping--here was a live DJ, tons of young adults dressed nicely. I took a star off for the parking. We didn't know where to park. They had valet but I didn't want to pay extra for that. We ended up parking in a small strip mall's parking lot and walking about 7 minutes in 32 degree weather. Prepare to spend quite a bit--we spend $85 on 2 bar drinks, 1 app, 2 sushi rolls, and 1 entree."}
{"text":"Went here to celebrate my girlfriends 21st due to all the good reviews about this place and between ordering a appetizer of sushi to start off with and walking out the place it was nothing but a complete waste of time and money. The service was horrible unlike the reviews. The sushi took 40 min to arrive the entree another 30 and was cold when it did. The manager just made excuses of how it was busy at the time, that's doesn't explain why my foods cold does it? In the end I paid the $93 dollar sushi bill seeing how I didn't even bother touching the ice cube they called salmon and rice and we headed to cookout for a hamburger tray and a milkshake all under $10. If I could give no stars I would."}
{"text":"Great food...ok service, but the music was way too loud. We were yelling at the table just to try and talk. Make up your mind. Are you a dance club or a sushi bar?"}
{"text":"The lobster and tuna roll were delicious! The vibe inside is fun and fresh... good place to get some drink before going out also."}
{"text":"I made a reservation at Nikko the past weekend through OpenTable, but when showed up at the restaurant, the lights were off and it was closed.  There was no mention of this on the restaurant's website and additionally I was able to book a reservation on OpenTable.com.  So there I was, with a date, at 7:00 pm with no where to eat- a GREAT experience for me and my date.  When I emailed the restaurant asking for an explanation, I was told that I must \"have the wrong location.\"  Of course I was at the only location I know, in South End.  They placed blame on me rather than taking responsibility for being closed after I had made a reservation.    I can't comment on the quality of the food or atmosphere, but the management.... extremely poor in my opinion."}
{"text":"This place is my all time favorite go to sushi place! The food is AMAZING and the service is terrific! The atmosphere is fun, clean, and energetic. My husband actually introduced me to this place and it didn't disappoint. I highly recommend this place. It's my favorite sushi place in Charlotte."}
{"text":"I've been to lots of sushi restaurants, and I feel that this one is pretty great.  I haven't been to any other Charlotte sushi spots, though, so I can't compare locally.  This was one of the best sushi meals I've had in a long time. The vibe inside is very trendy, which I find fun.  We sat at the bar, so we could watch everything get made.  The sushi guys were happy to answer any questions we had (\"Oooh, what's that?)\".  The server made suggestions on what we should eat based on our likes and how hungry we were, and her suggestions were great.  It's pricey, but sushi can be that way unless you get a lower budget sushi, like at Ru San's.  I think it's worth it.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Both of us ordered the $14 Tonkotsu Ramen.  Took 25 minutes for the food to arrive, and the soup was only lukewarm.  Not a good sign already.  Things only went downhill from here.  The noodles weren't Japanese ramen but more like the Korean variety (soft, not curly), and the broth was way too salty.  The pork was ok but the cold soup and wrong type of ramen had ruined it for me.  Seriously this was worse than frozen ramen from a Japanese grocery store.  I know they call themselves a sushi bar and Ramen may not be their specialty, but at this price point I had really expected a whole lot better and won't be returning."}
{"text":"I'm back to write a review for lunch! I love a good sushi or bento box lunch special. Nikko's sushi roll lunch special includes two rolls (not just the most basic, there are probably rolls to choose from) and a salad with their delicious ginger dressing (they claim it's the best ginger dressing in Charlotte, and it is pretty darn good!) for twelve bucks. Can't complain there! The restaurant is definitely quieter at lunchtime too, so it would be a good place for a business lunch or to have a long lunch with friends and actually be able to have a conversation. So now I can say I would recommend Nikko for lunch AND dinner."}
{"text":"I heard great things about this place and opted to go last night on date night with my wife.  We made reservations through opentable.com and showed up...only to find it was CLOSED on a Thursday night!  WT...  I really wish someone would communicate that.  Fail!"}
{"text":"I have FINALLY found amazing sushi in Charlotte.  I moved from NYC/ NJ and have been dying to find quality sushi around! A little pricey, but what great sushi isn't?  I am a happy camper."}
{"text":"Best sushi in Charlotte, hands down.  If you've never been to Nikko, prepare yourself to pay accordingly.  Let's face it:  Pappy Van Winkle costs a hell of a lot more than Jim Beam but it tastes a hell of a lot better, too.  And so it goes with Nikko.  You can save money by eating at Sushi 101 but you won't experience the superior quality fish and preparation.    I'll admit it...it can be a bit of a surprise when the music suddenly becomes louder and Joanna comes out with her tambourine.  You know it's coming, you just don't know when.  Batten down the hatches and prepare yourself for it ahead of time.  Winning a saki bomb throwdown is not one of my finest restaurant moments, but I can mark it off the bucket list.  You should, too.  The atmosphere is extremely clubby and most of the patrons are, well, clubtastic.    So, now that you're prepared for the price, the dancing, the tambourine, the cowboy hat and the clientele, you need to prepare your mouth for the most delicious sashimi in town.  The uni is wonderful salty deliciousness.  The blue fin toro will melt in your mouth like butter.  And so on and so forth.  I only wish that I could get a bowl full of fried shrimp heads without having to order the sweet shrimp.  I just can't stomach those snotty little bastards.  Joanna!  Save up your shrimp heads for me so I can have a delicious bowl of them every time I visit!  Please!"}
{"text":"Went on a girls night and it was excellent!! The atmosphere was very lively! If your looking for quiet ambiance then go before 6, after that there is a DJ! The food is great and very quick!"}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible service. As someone who worked at a restaurant for numerous years, I am usually lenient and understanding. But the service was absolutely horrible. We waited 2 hours for our food. Once it came finally, we waited another hour for our checks (after asking for them immediately). After speaking with a manager, we had to finally go up to the register to check out (30 mins later). We left at midnight. No one ever came to apologize."}
{"text":"I would choose zero stars but there is not an option for that. My boyfriend made reservations for tonight at 8:30 and we are still standing by the bar at 9pm... The front desk host was rude and when asked what was what taking so long, he replied \"I don't know why your still standing here.\".. Then we were told the table next to the table we needed weren't getting up. Basically, they were not prepared for a large party that made a precious reservation..."}
{"text":"If I could give it zero stars I would! Until Friday night Nikko was my favorite place to dine out in the Charlotte area. My kids knew it was \"Mommy's favorite restaurant\". We went here for birthdays, date nights and special occasions - never leaving with a bill under $300. In the past my friends and I got a kick out of the antics of Joanna the owner. However, Friday night I was appalled! She was obviously high on drugs! She started off repeating herself and not leaving our table after my husband and friends ordered Saki Bombs (she had 1 too - like she needed anything else to add to her buzz). Joanna then proceeded to pick several pieces of sushi off our platter, eat the fish off, spit out the rice - guess she's on a diet and watching her carbs - and put her 1/2 eaten saliva covered food back on our platter with our uneaten food. If this were not disgusting enough she ate 1/2 a piece of sushi and shoved the other half into my friends mouth!!! I was appalled to say the least and went to the hostess stand to get the manger. When I returned to the table she was hanging on my husband asking him \"Why you married to such a bitch?\" Carter, the manager, had Joanna removed from our table and hopefully sent home to sober up. We did not see her again that evening thank God! Our very embarrassed waitress and the manager handled the situation very well. Thank you to them. Joanna - thank you for ruining my birthday dinner! Thanks to you, I will be finding a new favorite restaurant!"}
{"text":"This place was GREAT!  Food was amazing.  High quality service.  Cheap prices.  Large quantities.  Strong drinks.  Definitely a high recommendation."}
{"text":"My coworker came here and ordered Udon (pronounced oo-don) and had the \"Japanese\" waitress correct her say \"you mean 'YOU'don?\"    ONE STAR FOR POOR MANAGEMENT  It was all one big joke until I actually came here.  Now granted the food is mediocre, and some are even pretty decent but the management was TERRIBLE.  We had a large group come and we ordered TONS of food as evident by my 11 pictures (granted that's only a quarter of the table).  We had a few people that couldn't make it but with alcohol we definitely ran a decent tab.  At the end of the evening the staff came by and said we hadn't hit the minimum for the private room and we where going to have to pay the difference.  SERIOUSLY!?!  After much debate, the restaurant allowed they guys paying the tab to buy some additional alcohol to fill the tab.  But since everyone was from out of ton they had to have it shipped.  Guess what... IT NEVER ARRIVED!!!   Overall that really soured the experience.  The servers were going on about how fresh their fish was and how they would go the airport several times a day and even have clients who would fly in just to eat here. Sadly, When we had asked the them for recommendations, they asked us if we preferred fried or non fried.  We said non fried and they where like \"um... then we don't really know what to recommend.\" LAME.  Anyway, on to the food.  We grabbed a few appetizers.  The presentation was nice like on the FLASH FRIED CALAMARI (Who comes up with these names?) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rZOzhSA5HP6IdpxuN4v66w?select=tSkv98cSBGdPwx2VbdTCIg  There was an order of SOFT SHELL SPRING ROLLS http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rZOzhSA5HP6IdpxuN4v66w?select=9Pi4Qm5nH__s4ai6kf1VMw  They were decent but the sauce was noxious.  Stand out dishes included OMEGA 3 - Seared salmon on one side, with avacodo and Masago mixed into the rice.  Topped with marinated onions and jalapenos this was actually pretty good and I'm not usually a fan of cooked salmon.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rZOzhSA5HP6IdpxuN4v66w?select=k6jiPToJ1zh8H39zbErOaA  SPICY TUNA NACHOS?  - Not sure if that's the right name.  Now granted it's hard to mess up spicy tuna, but this was decent. I recommended it to someone at the table who didn't really eat raw fish (you should usually recommend Spicy Tuna to sushi neophytes) and she really liked it. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rZOzhSA5HP6IdpxuN4v66w?select=9NWxQ7GiV32EYYi4qRIIGg  FIVE SPICE CHOCOLATE CAKE with GINGER ICE CREAM... http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rZOzhSA5HP6IdpxuN4v66w?select=P0P1mlC0FoMXdvExqadzTg Again, nice name but the not much more than a regular chocolate cake.     Overall, I might have stopped back her for the OMEGA 3 but given the TERRIBLE management and the week staff I probably won't ever be back."}
{"text":"terrible service, atmospher,  food, beyond overpriced!!!!  way too over-rated place!!!!    will never go back.....stay away folks!!!"}
{"text":"It was around 8 on a saturday night so I understand that they were busy, but our service wasn't that good. First they were out of stock on several bottles of wine, we had to order 3 bottles of wine before they actually had one we wanted. some of us ordered salads and half of us didn't get them until we reminded the waitress. The sushi was ok, definitely not the best i ever had. I am all about trendy and young places but the atmosphere was a little much, I felt like Nikko was trying too hard to be hip. It was a bit too much of a nightclub atmosphere for a place to have dinner, they had a dj spinning while we were there and it was so loud that the only person you could talk to was the person next to you, and there was also a girl passed out in the women's bathroom with the door locked.  Good things: We had reservations and we were seated immediately and the cost was very reasonable. I paid around $45 (tip included) for a salad, sushi, and a half bottle of wine."}
{"text":"It is a good looking restaurant. We(10 people) went there yesterday for my birthday party but nobody was happy with the service.  The waitress(Alisha) was very rude from the beginning.  My girlfriend had to literally tell her to please mood up since it is my birthday. We sent back a couple of food as it wasn't what we asked for.   The check was around $700 so that mean we gave a lot of business on a Tuesday(very slow day). My friends didn't let me pay but today they told me that most of them were OVERCHARGED from what they signed for.   My friends and I are never going there again.  If you do want to go, please make sure you don't ask for waitress ALISHA.  You know they say \"One rotten apple spoils the whole barrel\", I think Alisha is like that, the place could be good but she spoiled it for us."}
{"text":"Sushi is still amazing!!! I love anytime I find rolls that aren't smothered in sauce and tempura flakes. Being able to enjoy the flavors was wonderful!!! Still one of my favorites."}
{"text":"No sushi love here anymore.  Everyone who lives in South End's pink building just got sued by Nikkos.  Boo!  https://www.charlotteagenda.com/45766/everyone-lives-south-ends-pink-building-just-got-sued/"}
{"text":"This place has a great location and a great atmosphere. Everything is super over priced, But the food is delicious on that note. Our waiter was very adamant about serving us shots and would ask if we were ready for shots every time he came to the table. It had to have been at least 10 or so times which he asked us if we were ready for shots, Which nobody was there to get wasted. The server was friendly yet pushy and would not stop talking to us, Just wanted him to stop talking and let us eat the food we were paying top dollar for!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that if you make a reservation, you are not reserving the right to a table before other patrons who are physically at the restaurant. Rather, you are reserving a time slot for two hours as per its policy. I have never heard of such thing until a group of friends and I made reservations for a party of 10 for six o`clock. In addition to having the majority of our group present and a pretty empty crowd, they denied our request to be seated until all 10 individuals arrived. Not to mention the fact that service was terrible from management and server, and they kicked us off so the next party who made a reservation could have the table. Ive been to various high end restaurants and have never been treated this way, and im not saying this is by any means high end. Will never go back to this place."}
{"text":"Sadly what looks like a a wannabe stylish Asian experience simply cannot deliver when it comes to the food and service  Edemane Beans that lacked salt, Miso soup that had the smallest amount of  tofu floating about barely qualifying it for the title, Ginger dressing on the salad was good. However the Chicken Terriyaki was straight off the Sysco truck having been pre-cooked in some commissary  in Ohio and then dosed with a little sauce and sesame seeds. .  My server had great difficulty in extracting himself from his deep discussion with the pretty bar tender, who was clearly enjoying the attention. When he finally did circle back and ask if everything was \"Okay\" I got to tell him how unhappy I was with the chicken.  To his credit he did offer to replace it, but after having waited for him to return to my table I had lost my appetite. The bill was presented with the chicken removed, but that was that, clearly management is comfortable ignoring a legitimate complaint not bothering to correct my perception of the restaurant.   I left the restaurant nobody offered a farewell or inquired about my visit. Oh the Parking Valet did that, and he just shrugged his shoulders at my response, as though he'd heard it before."}
{"text":"The thing about Nikko is that the atmosphere is great. Decor looks lovely and it's a vibrant space. Music is super loud though, but if you're in your young 20s looking for a place that opens late and is close enough to downtown that you can just jump right over to the club, Nikko is a good spot. But honestly, prices are too high for the quality of food you get. Sushi is okay at best and entrees aren't that great either. There's is nothing special about the food here."}
{"text":"Nikko's sushi is AMAZING! I've been here both at night and during lunch for the $12 lunch roll specials. Of course at night the place comes alive and is a perfect place to have a girls night out. The super crunch roll is amazing. Substitute the mayo for cream cheese.   Complaints: The parking deck is easy to find but is kind of tight getting in and out of.  One of my friends was trying out being a vegan for a month and the waiter we had wasn't well educated on the vegan options.      This is definitely one of Charlotte's most upscale restaurants for sushi. Expect a wait on weekend nights."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good...not the best by any means. Waitresses were super rude and the service was painfully slow. There are PLENTY of better places to dine in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Over the last holiday weekend my sister, my bf and I went to this restaurant. It was really good. Fresh sushi and hip atmosphere. When I'm in Charlotte, I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere. Fish was very fresh and they have a nice wine selection. Free Valet parking is a big plus! The restaurant was clean. Everyone working was very friendly."}
{"text":"Not impressed. Service was horrible and I found CHICKEN in my tofu dish. As a vegetarian, I was very upset over this and the staff/Joanna was rude when I pointed it out. NOT going back here again."}
{"text":"Oh I'm so torn.  I know CLT has a love affair with Nikko.  It wasn't that my experiences were bad...the place is fun... but...well, read on fair Yelpers, read on.   The prices, like Nicole W. said are a bit high.  I not only saw a $29 freaking dollar specialty sushi roll...but our $8 tempura appetizer was meager in size, and frankly, too salty and not light and crisp.  (RuSan's does the same average quality for a DOLLAR for 2 pieces!) This is not New York.  This is not Boston.  This is not the kind of sushi place where a $12 singular piece of sashimi is justified. The rolls *were* good...but again, the price was kind of a killjoy.   Perhaps I should back up, and talk about the parking.  Yes, there's free valet, but for those who don't want to valet...parking on the 4th floor is kind of irritating for Charlotte.   Go with the valet.   The atmosphere is total nightclub.  Modern lighting fixtures, bar, even the bathroom is fun/club-esque.  The high prices probably go toward paying the DJ.   Michael E. is right about the service-- it's good.  Example, a server we had on a recent outing with a big group, was attentive, and good at suggesting sake, specialty rolls and appetizers.   Maybe this place is good for the outgoing-loud-social set, but for the money, I'd go to one of the more solid sushi joints, and use the money you saved to go to a real club, if that's you're thing."}
{"text":"Nikkos is always a solid choice for sushi, but I am a more adventurous person when it comes to sushi rolls. They have great salmon sashimi, however it is 6$ for two pieces so it can get pricey really quickly. The place has decent service, but except a wait on Friday/Saturdays. They also have a DJ Friday and Saturday nights as well as free valet service so you don't have to try to navigate the parking garage."}
{"text":"I was looking for some sushi for dinner and this place was great. My entire meal consisted of sushi/shushimi and I can't wat to go back. There was free valet parking, and great service. There was a DJ and the music was LOUD."}
{"text":"OMG the Salmon Crunchy  Roll is a must order.  If a  lively up beat seen for a restaurant is what you are looking for, then this is the place."}
{"text":"I took my boss and her boss to dinner here. Food was AMAZING! You can order almost any sushi you can imagine. Drinks are made really well and with lots of love. Our waitress Vanessa was really on top of everything and very knowledgeable. I will be returning next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Very good sushi. One of the best places in town.  It is bit overpriced. Atmosphere is very trendy, but we have been coming here for years, so we are used to it.  We get annoyed when the music is turned up way too loud. Can feel some tension between the owners- they are both on the floor overseeing the business. The woman owner is sweet, but acts like a star and thinks people come there to perform. Really, we don't..."}
{"text":"The Firecracker Shrimp is my favorite thing in the menu. The only complaint I have is that sometimes service is slow."}
{"text":"I don't think you can go wrong with Nikko if you're looking for quality sushi.  1.  The food is outstanding.  A lot of different rolls available on their sushi menu and interesting specials every time I've been.  I haven't tried any of their teriyaki dishes or the bento box, but I've heard from others that both are great.  2.  The wait staff is great.  Have never had a problem with service.    3.  Good with large groups.  I've been to both the South Blvd. and Ballantyne location with groups of 12+ and never had a problem.  Checks were always separated appropriately and no orders were messed up.  The only recommendation I have is to make sure you make reservations (if you can, I'm not sure about this...).  I went with a date on a Thursday night and ended up with a 30 minute wait."}
{"text":"tried this place out on the recommendation of a friend. Service was awful, sushi was average. Not one single thing about the place struck me as better than any other sushi restaurant in town. Don't bother."}
{"text":"While visiting a friend in Charlotte we stopped here for dinner. She had been there several times for lunch and said the sushi was rather good.  I am a picky sushi eater since I don't like my fish to smell fishy (I know it is a quirk) and I must say it was fresh and tasty!  We had both ordered the bento box, chef's choice which included coconut shrimp with a tasty citrus cilantro flavor and not overpowering with the coconut, Kobe beef strips with mushrooms, 2 dumplings, and 9 slices of sashimi.  It came with a miso soup which was also delicious. Everything was just delicious including the lychee martini!    Would definitely recommend and am staying at 4 stars for price reasons only although I understand lunch is much more reasonable."}
{"text":"Absolutely great sushi, great service, great atmosphere and great saki!  The different varieties of sushi allowed me to find something new while find my favorites. The menu included close to 30 different kinds. The owner was entertaining as she danced with her cowboy hat and feather boa. The price was a bit steep, but worth it every once in awhile.  This is a great place to take a date (if you both enjoy sushi)!"}
{"text":"This place is ok.  The ambiance is a huge turnoff.  It's a nightclub moonlighting as a sushi bar.  Anyone who doesn't want to be hangin out with yuppies and trendies needs to steer clear of this place.  Music feels like I should be at a Rave...probably has something to do with the lady in white snakeskin boots and matching 10-gallon hat at the hostess podium?  I'm assuming that's the owner...no self-respecting boss would let their employees get away with dressing like that at work.  I would not bring business colleagues or clients to this establishment...unless I was in the business of owning strip clubs (I'm not).  The fish is ok...overpriced for the cut and quality though.  Selection of rolls is the same...just ok.  Drinks are priced according to what one may experience in an Uptown fine dining restaurant...and this place falls short of that, in both quality and location.  This is definitley a place that prefers form over substance when it comes to a good sushi experience.  You are paying for the decor/ambiance...not decent sushi.  Service is always quick and attentive, no matter how busy.  After trying several dinners here, I only come here for their lunch now; the nightclub feel is just too off-putting...and I'm only 26 yrs. old!  I can handle a nightclub, just not with my fish.  the Bento lunch boxes are a decent deal."}
{"text":"If you visit Charlotte and stay in the downtown area, this is the sushi place to go. The sushi was mmm superb, I had a great time here. Perhaps because I went to visit my girl Brooke in Charlotte at the time. She was fantastic, definitely made it worth the trip. We drank too many martinis and made out in the elevator on our way back to the parking garage. Few people saw us as they got on and off the elevator but we didn't care, we just kept kissing and making out. Will never forget this night, it felt so fkin good!  5 stars based on what happened in the elevator"}
{"text":"Meh. That's what I have to say about this place.  First, the location is close to my work so I was excited about that but the parking situation is terrible, just be ready to hunt for a while.  Second, I got chicken teriyaki with fried rice (extra charge which I was fine with) and miso soup. What I actually got was dry chicken (not overdone but dry as in not sauced) with teriyaki on the side and rice with almost a whole onion chopped in it. Onion is okay but this was just way too much - who really thought that much was a good idea?! As for the sauce, teriyaki is very think and rich until cooked so I really couldn't use the sauce. The soup was just okay so this experience was not great all the way around.  I think I'll probably try it again and remember these things so I can be very specific about how the food should be cooked. Not worth the price when they don't really measure up to any of the other hibachi places.  I didn't try any sushi but I will next time."}
{"text":"Great restaurant, Great food, Great service. The owner is awesome as well. She comes around to the tables on the weekends and dances with the customers."}
{"text":"Yum Yum Yum, this is one of my favorite Sushi spots. 2 thumbs up!!"}
{"text":"Pretty good food overall.  Service was excellent!  The Asian Cowgirl looks like she stumbled out of a bad porno but she kicks ass.  If you've been, you know what I mean."}
{"text":"I ordered the Salmon with Gorgonzola Sauce for take out. I notice the bill and they've charged $1 for \"to go\". WHAT THE HELL! I've NEVER heard of anyone charging extra for a pick-up order. Even if it's a delivery, I can understand an extra charge. What was even more annoying was that the packaging was lousy, cheap Styrofoam!! Not even worth a dollar. Now for the entree itself. The cook (notice my use of the word cook, not chef) had to be blind. That's the only way the fish could have been so overcooked. It was like a hockey puck. DRY and BLACK. The menu claims that the entree has mushrooms and asparagus in it. Again, the blind cook probably just put double the amount of mushrooms instead. For a pricey $22, this was the worst entree I have had in Charlotte. Two thumbs down."}
{"text":"Alright well, I finally got a chance to try Nikko this weekend after hearing about it being the best sushi in Charlotte.  I have to say, I was too distracted by the club atmosphere going on around me to even worry about the quality of the food.  That's probably because despite having a reservation for 15 at 9 pm, we waited until almost 10:30 only to be seated at a make-shift table set up for 8.  I'm talking about a table scooted up to the end of the booth making it impossible for the table behind us to get out and if you were in the inside booth and have to pee,  you better be prepared to hold it.  Waiting that long for a table when a reservation was made almost three months ago is bulls&(#! That is one of my biggest restaurant pet peeves EVER.  The loud techno music by the in-house DJ was also a bit much, this place is definitely trying way to hard.  The food was good, that I can say.  The seafood fried rice had big pieces of crab, scallop, and shrimp, and the rice was perfectly cooked.  That was probably the only dish that had portions and taste that actually  fit the price.  Our service was excellent, which was much appreciated considering how busy she was.  The sushi was sushi....nothing special, but solid nonetheless.  If you are heading to Nikko, be sure to wear your club gear and you'll fit right in.  Oh and don't bother making a reservation, it's obviously pointless."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and both times the service was so awful that I'll never return. Both times were for birthday parties and both times we had to wait more than an hour for our food to come out. One time the owner even brought out sake bombs we never asked for and offered them up to everyone saying they were free for the party. At the end of the night, those \"free\" sake bombs were on the bill."}
{"text":"WARNING: Nikko is not suitable for vegetarians or vegans, and potentially others with food sensitivities. On my first visit, I ordered a vegetarian noodle dish. The waiter brought it out with chicken in it. No problem, mistakes happen. I let him know of the mix-up and he was very apologetic. About 2 minutes later, the waiter brought out the dish again. It was sans chicken, but otherwise looked eerily similar to the chicken-topped dish. I asked the waiter if the chefs had simply removed the chicken, instead of making a new dish, and let him know that I would become very ill in the former case. He confirmed that they had in fact merely removed the chicken. The kitchen made me a new dish, although by the time it arrived my companions had finished eating (and I was constantly paranoid that it wasn't safe to eat). I received little in the way of an apology and was charged full price despite the entire ordeal. I offer this as a warning to those with food sensitivities.  Such deceptive practices are dangerous and intolerable."}
{"text":"Great sushi! Big fan of soy paper over seaweed, but they must not use it regularly because the rolls would not stay together. The place smelled like fake tanner too, LOL. Or it could have been the last person to have sit at our table. Good prices, cool atmosphere, and good sushi!"}
{"text":"Caught this place at the end of their day. Nice atmosphere and a good feel all-round. The music may have been a little loud considering the place was empty but 90s hip hop is so classic it kind of worked. Tried a few rolls including the Dancing Queen specialty roll. This restaurant is on their sushi game for sure and the rolls were excellent. In all this was a very good experience and would be four stars, but reaches five stars because the service was outstanding"}
{"text":"I am only giving 2 stars bc the food was actually fairly good. Not good enough for me to ever go back tho.   To say the service was deplorable would be an understatement. Our server was unbelievably dumb. My friend asked him to \"rattle off\" the top sushi favorites amongst guests and he needed us to explain to him what \"rattle off\" means.   He didn't bring soups for some of the party until we reminded him when the meals arrived.   I ordered a \"round\" of drinks and he came back with only 2 not 4.   CO2 was out in soda gun and we told him yet all drinks continued to come with flat soda.   Overall pathetic excuse for a server who each time we asked for something or pointed out an error he rolled his eyes."}
{"text":"Been here before and it's been pretty good. The service tonight was horrible. Having worked in restaurants before I'm understand busy nights however tonight wasn't busy. Our server was so bad we said something to the manager but still our night was taken from an 8 to a 2"}
{"text":"This was the first time I ate here.  Met a prospective candidate for lunch.  I gave it 3 stars for the following:  1.  The taste of the House Cucumber Roll was dominated by the cucumber, which probably explains the name.  I had to remove 2 wraps just to taste the Salmon and Tuna.  Priced too high considering you really couldn't taste the fish.  Also the Ponzu sauce was only placed on 1 of the 8 rolls.   2.  Tuna Crunch roll called for \"lightly\" Panko tuna, but the Panko was over done, taking away the taste of the tuna.    Fortunately, the Spider Roll turned out really good.  Considering the overall cost of lunch, with 2 out of the 3 orders below expectations, a 3-star rating was appropriate.  Without the Spider Roll, I would have likely rated a 2 to 2.5 for the experience."}
{"text":"So here's the deal as far as we're concerned. The food is really good! Great  sushi in creative forms. So tasty and fresh, though a little more expensive. Perhaps worth it.  BUT, at least one bartender is very short on pours. A martini glass should not be half full.  This has occurred on every visit with only weak excuses provided. We no longer  drink here. On one occasion, we walked to the hostess desk and asked for a table. I believe the owner asked us to wait while she found one. She became so engaged in conversation, she completely forgot us. We left."}
{"text":"It seems to be that either you love Nikkos or you hate it..I love it there. Yes the Sushi is a bit pricier then in other spots, but your paying for the atmosphere and decor. Yes its a bit pretentious, but its a great place to get dressed up and have some pretty great food. Also they seem to be the only place in town in which I have found Hana Awaka Saki."}
{"text":"The food was OK, but I really needed a quiet setting where I could have a conversation during a fine dine. The music was way to loud and I even requested to have it turned down. They did turn it down, but 5 minutes later it was blasting loud again. Too obnoxious for me and will not attend again."}
{"text":"Awesome date place!!!! I had a great experience at Nikko,my date and I were seated promptly and there is an awesome selection of sashimi, sushi rolls, and other dishes to choose from.   We had the hamachi sashimi with the jalapeno & tobiko, super crunchy roll, dancing queen, and a spicy tuna roll.  All were very fresh and tasty...yum!  The ambiance was modern with Asian twists.  We sat in a big cushy booth as sharing sushi and wine.  It was quiet enough to have a decent conversation without screaming."}
{"text":"I should start by saying the food isn't bad. It was actually quite tasty.   I'm giving them 3 stars for 2 reasons:  1. Price was a little high for the quality of the food. We ended up spending over $50 for 2 entrees and and appetizer. We each ordered the teriyaki chicken entree and as I mentioned earlier, it was good. We had the firecracker shrimp for an appetizer and that was delicious but a little over battered.   2. Atmosphere. The place feels like you walked into a some weird fusion between a high end night club where you might find pro athletes and musicians / some type of Asian mafia in the back room.   Staff seemed friendly enough and we didn't have to wait long at all for our food.   I should mention we did not try the sushi which seems to be the route we should have gone after reviewing others comments."}
{"text":"This was a long descent from favorite sushi joint to \"never again\".  I hate to leave negative reviews, but after being a loyal customer for years, even as the food and service declined, my recent visit will be my last.  The sushi quality was unacceptable, and the service was downright rude.  So sad to see service go down hill.  Oh well.  Glad there are plenty of other options."}
{"text":"We decided to make multiple sushi stops and Nikko was our first one.  We showed up about 7:30 and the place was in full swing.  You need to know that at night Nikko becomes a club scene.  Not really my scene, but I wouldn't dock them any points for it because that's who they are.  We sat at the sushi bar, which cut down some on the scene.  We ordered the VIP Roll, Omega 3 Roll, and a spicy scallop roll.  I don't think I can pick a favorite.  Each one was wonderful.  The sushi was fresh, the rolls were original, and it was all delicious.  So many unique items, such as jalapeno miso sauce, went into the rolls.    There are other rolls I would love to try.  Will have to return."}
{"text":"Went last night for resturant week ended up just getting sushi rolls. The Cowboy roll was one of the best sushi rolls I have ever had. My Martini was spot on and the service was top notch. Michael treated my friend and I very kindly. He was very attentive and kind. We both had a great experience. The only problem was the sushi was too good we both were so full we couldn't try dessert. Next time!"}
{"text":"It has been more than a year since I went to Nikko's and the memory still haunts me. I don't have the words to describe how loud the music was. It completely dominated the meal to the point that I did not even attempt to communicate with those around me.  We ordered our food by pointing at the menu. No one pretended that the waitress would be able to hear. Even then I was wishing I could leave. My ears hurt before the food arrived. Badly. I couldn't eat. I think that the food tasted like ear pain, but maybe my memories are blurring together. Hours afterwards I could not carry a conversation face to face and I suspect that my hearing never completely recovered. It cannot be legal to have human beings working in this restaurant without ear protection. That I was obliged to pay for such treatment is frightening.  Highlight of the evening: walking home a drunk girl is beating her boyfriend with her shoe and screaming \"I ain't no white trash!\""}
{"text":"Before Nikko moved into its new, current location, I loved going there.  The sushi was some of the best I've ever had, and the atmosphere was fun and lively.  Recently, we finally went to the \"new\" Nikko in Dilworth for our anniversary.  All I can say is...WOW.  It was like a sushi nightclub.  I loved the new modern decor, despite now feeling a bit underdressed.  I felt like I was in a New York City restaurant/bar.    We waited about 45 min for a table on a busy Saturday night, but had a couple of pricey-yet-delicious martinis from the bar to keep us occupied.  Fortunately, now, too, they have a big waiting, comfortable waiting area (and bar) that they didn't have before.    We were finally sat and ordered five different rolls to share.  Each one was made with care, wonderfully presented, and melted in our mouths.  I could have eaten more and more 'til my tummy burst.    We'll definitely return...but I'll wear something a little more dressy next time!"}
{"text":"BOOM BOOM POW, SHAKIN THAT THANG! Come to Nikko Thursday - Saturday after 8pm and there's a good chance you'll here your favorite club music being blasted throughout the place. There's probably a crazy owner shaking a tambourine around the tables. If you don't see her or know who she is, just go to the bathroom and see the banner size self portrait hanging on the wall...yep...   All that said, the place has GOOD sushi. Full menu with many options, but for me, the sushi is what makes this place. They don't take reservations unless your party is over 6, so be prepared to put your name on the list and wait 30 minutes give or take depending on the night. If you go earlier in the week, walking right in and sitting down is expected. If you're planning your first visit, I recommend going early in the week to make sure you don't get annoyed and get used to the surroundings. If you're looking for a good time with friends/family and/or folks visiting, go on the weekend to enjoy the scene and people watching. Great outdoor area too for those perfect nights.   For the food...it's usually the same. Jalapeno Hamachi app along with the special tuna app w/avacado. For rolls, go with the Tuna Cruchy...the citrus sauce it awesome. Godzilla roll and Alex roll will usually find their way to the table too!"}
{"text":"This was the absolute worst I have experienced in Charlotte. Starting with the unwelcoming receptionist and the fact that individuals that put their name down AFTER us received seating before we did. Moving on to the table where the most disengaged waitress came to offer her piss poor service. She would circulate the area and tend to every table except ours. There was an issue with my order and this lady had the nerve to point and rudely respond \"this is what you ordered!\" After speaking with her and demanding the manager, he came over just as disengaged as she had. He offered no solution to the rude service. I was completely turned off by the service and subpar food and have no intention of ever returning."}
{"text":"Kalbi beef bbq short ribs are a must! They were delicious, definitely one of my favourites. Tender, seasoned Korean style, to perfection! Couldn't snap a photo in time they looked so good   Definitely my go to Japanese spot here in Charlotte. Couldn't try the sushi, but looked amazing, will be back for more!"}
{"text":"It seems Im not alone in my findings of Nikko's the atmosphere is great!! Music is loud, its fun and gets you drinking, but unfortunately there isn't enough alcohol in the world to make they're food taste good!!   I sent my Black Cod back because it was Tuna...When it came out next time I got the Black Cod it was so fishy I couldn't take it so I didn't eat it. The server told the manager and they said that it was cooked perfectly and nothing was wrong with it and that I probably didn't know what i was ordering so it was my fault and they will not be taking it off the check.   Now from one of my other reviews I have dined at NOBU in NYC.  I know NIikko's will never be anywhere near as good as a place of this caliber so I know it's not fair to compare, but to prove I've had Black Cod before is an understatement because it was probably the most amazing Black Cod I will ever have. But no they are right I have no idea what it is and what it's suppose to taste like....  She should probably just keep her mouth closed and let others run a restaurant while she dances around in her hot pink Boa and call it a night!!"}
{"text":"One of my absolute favorite weekend spots to go! I've only been on Saturday nights and it's always \"club-like\" in a way, which I really like! I'm not sure if it's only on the weekend, but they have a DJ who always plays the best music. The owner is also really friendly and dances with guests, which makes the atmosphere super fun!  I also really enjoy the food! The sushi is great, but my favorite is the Nabe Yaki Udon. Comes with egg, shrimp, and chicken, so good! I also had the chicken yaki soba which was good as well! Most of the menu is pretty pricey, but the noodles dishes are all decent prices.  Would definitely recommend for a fun night out!   I do recommend making a reservation, the wait can be long! There is a parking deck (free), right at the end of the street and a parking lot, so that shouldn't be an issue. One of my favorite places in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"We went to Nikko's for the first time for a friends birthday this week and I have to say I was pretty impressed. It is a bit more upscale then some of the other trendy sushi joints around town, with an almost club like feel. Parking was easy as they had valet parking. Service was great and the food was wonderful. We started out with the toro tartare which to be honest wasnt the best toro Ive had but still pretty good. It did lack a little flavor for what you expect out of toro. The price was about $19 which I think is somewhat fair for a good amount of toro. Definately a bit more expensive than your usual appetizer though. The remaining entrees were fantastic. I got the a sushi/ sashimi sampler plate for $30. it game with 3 pieces each sashimi octopus, salmon, and tuna and 8 pieces of nigiri including, shrimp, tuna, hamachi, salmon. It was definately tastey and for the price they did give big cuts of sashimi. The only thing I wish was different was the double tuna and salmon they give. I would of liked to try different fish on the nigiri. One of our friends had the volcano roll. It  may have been the best volcano roll I have tried. I believe it was around $13, which for higher end place is not a bad deal. My soon to be mother in law is in town from Detroit and she will not touch any sushi so she got the steak and chicken teriyaki hibachi. The steak was delicous. It was cooked to perfection and had great flavors. The cost was about $25 dollars. Which I think is comparable to any other Japanese restaurant. I did get a couple bottles of sake. I prefer unfiltered cold sake usually and they had a couple of different selections. It was rather good. I did notice that some of there sake was a bit over priced. I have seen the same sake at other restaurants for a fraction of the price. I would say this place is almost five stars. I have not been there enough to try more of their sushi rolls yet. I will definately go back sometime and maybe this review will be updated."}
{"text":"Good vibe, good food. Too loud on weekend nights. Make a choice, nightclub or dinner."}
{"text":"Love to eat at Nikkos.  Very delicious sushi and atmosphere is perfect.  They need better parking but we always get valet anyways"}
{"text":"Nothing bad about this place. It's fun. Upscale. Great food. Great people. Great customer service."}
{"text":"Very conveniently located to the place I was staying on overnight trip to Chatlotte. I like to sample a few things when traveling and had the Toro Toro sushi which I thought was great especially when the spiciness kicked in. I also tried the dinner with chicken that I got with miso soup, salad, chicken and fried rice.  A lot of food which I didn't finish but decent sampler. Rice was good.  Chicken had nice sauce but a bit dry. Good dish if u are hungry! It was very loud for being Saturday night so I imagine good for parties not necessarily weary travellers getting off a 5 hour flight. If I'm back here I would probably go back and just try more sushi."}
{"text":"Ru San's has nothing on the volume here...  Ear splitting crappy music, mediocre food and a half hour wait for gyoza.  One visit was more than enough."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Perfect sushi restaurant for after work drinks and a quick bite. The location on South Boulevard is nice and yet parking is still OK. The sushi is not cheap, but the quality and art of sushi is what you expect from a high end sushi restaurant. I am not an elitist so I prefer the cool atmosphere with the quality in the food. If it were more stuffy or \"quite\" I would not like Nikko as much.  Almost my fav spot in Charlotte, but definitely up there..."}
{"text":"The food is so-so. Service is terrible. I gave this place several chances. Servers/waitresses couldn't careless about the customer experience. Not to mention the price is very pricy for the quality..."}
{"text":"Some of the sushi rolls that are more affordable, are just up to par, nothing too special. The more expensive sushi rolls, seaweed salad, miso soup, are quite good. As per the drink menu, I highly recommend the lychee martini. I just expected more for the price I paid."}
{"text":"Delicious sushi, friendly and professional waitstaff, and great atmosphere. We went on a Monday night so it wasn't that busy. Will go again for sure!"}
{"text":"I took my girlfriend here for a dinner date. It certainly is up-tempo and seems to be a trendy spot for those in their 20s and 30s, but on the other hand, it's not a loud restaurant where you can't hear your tablemate.  Service was somewhat sparse; our waitress only came around once in a while to refill our drinks, and it took a while for her to take our orders. This was on a busy Friday night, but I still think if a couple more people were on the wait staff they'd be able to provide faster service.  However, you'll quickly forget about the service once you try the food. We had the Yaki Ebi (basically Teriyaki Shrimp on skewers) for an appetizer. Not much food for the $7, but delicious. I ordered the Sushi/Sashimi Combo ($25, but a LOT of food) and she had the Crazy Roll ($8.25) and Scallop Roll ($6.5). You could tell how fresh everything was just by tasting it, and the way they present it also adds to the experience. Her Crazy Roll was served in a tall glass over a bed of lettuce. Everything was delicious. All in all, far better than anything I'd ever eaten at Sushi 101 (though pricier).  Overall: Excellent sushi-eating experience if you don't mind paying the price, and waiting for the service during peak hours."}
{"text":"Went for NYE, rolls were way over priced and average at that.  Great environment, average food.  None of them were anything special.  For a $200 sushi dinner, walking away unsatisfied does not make me ever want to go back.  bottom line:  save your money and go to another sushi place"}
{"text":"An oldie, but goodie. There are few things that I don't want to mess with in life. Raw fish being one of them. Nikko has an endless roll on sushi and decent prices for a classy venue. Jennifer at the bar is super attentive and kind. Alone, on a date or with a group... this place really is a great venue with amazing food. They have FRESH good quality salmon! Big plus for me. I have heard they turn into a dance floor/DJ on the weekends, but have yet to experience that."}
{"text":"Have always LOVED this restaurant.....especially how fun it is on Friday nights. Made a reservation and brought a group there on my birthday, told the hostess on the phone it would be 15-20 people.   People started arriving, and I asked them to seat us. Was told they would not seat us until the WHOLE party had arrived. This place has a VERY small lobby/bar area....having like 12 people in it is pushing it.  Told the man at the host stand this....he just said \"sorry\".  So standing out in the lobby/bar area with a massive group of people is not very fun....while we are just standing there and staring at our empty table. Wasn't even like we could have sat at the bar and ordered some drinks....the bar was already full of patrons.  Pretty embarrassing."}
{"text":"Sadly, Nikko has closed their Ballantyne location."}
{"text":"We made a reservation 3 weeks in advance for a party of 20. They sat us in a room with a wall in the middle of the table, so we couldn't see half of our friends. Service was terrible, and we left after getting one weak drink. The management was unapologetic about the whole situation. We will not be going back."}
{"text":"Has a cool vibe with the music and DJ playing when I visited Saturday night. Would recommend having a reservation. Our wait was initially 1.5 hours until we were able to find seats at the sushi bar. For the price and wait food was ok. Recommend coming for the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Awesome rolls and food. Should be noted on Friday nights this place has a DJ and gets very very loud so don't go Friday nights if you are trying to talk to someone !"}
{"text":"As a NYC resident, I've had some pretty amazing sushi - and I wasn't expecting anything overly amazing while visiting my BFF in Charlotte last week... but my god, Nikko's sushi was crazy good!  This place is just awesome.  Fun vibe, trendy, great music, special drink menu... I was told it turns into a club at night, but it was pretty empty by the time we left to go out - so I don't know about all that. The Ballantyne Roll and the Dancing Queen Roll (which is like a Mexican roll) may be 2 of the pricier options (on a very reasonable menu) - but seriously, do not miss out on them!   I'm kind of wanting to fly back to Charlotte right now just to have more."}
{"text":"I am very iffy with sushi places. Most of the time it doesn't sit well in my stomach. This place is so fresh and delicious every time I go I'm never disappointed. I love how the owner is always walking around making sure everyone is satisfied and having a good time and the food is good.  So many different things to try and everything I've had hasn't been bad. My favorite is the lychee martini, which I'm surprised not a lot of other sushi restaurants have.   Yes there is music on weekends, I've never been during the week, I find it fun. Always a good time."}
{"text":"This place is a serious party.  If you have a group and are looking to celebrate a special occasion (birthday/bachelorette) this is the place for you.  It's practically a club at dinner time, with a DJ and lights strobing.  This is not a place for a romantic evening or a family meal. You definitely come here for the ambiance.   My asian chicken salad was okay, but I've honestly made a better one at home.  Sadly, it also may or may not have made me sick? I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt.   The owner was fabulous, in her Chanel dress, feather boa, and cowboy hat.  We were celebrating a bachelorette weekend, and she grabbed the bride-to-be out of the booth and danced her around the restaurant.  We also had sake bombs and lots of drinks.  Service was good and kept the beverages flowing.  Most girls had sushi that I think they enjoyed.   Overall, food was okay, experience was a total blast and just perfect for our first night on our bachelorette weekend!"}
{"text":"What a fun and stimulating sushi place to be with high energy hip-hop loud music and cool DJ as well as Joanna (the owner) with her boa and signature cowboy hat running the place! Sushi at Nikko never gets boring especially when Joanna is dancing next to your table saying hi and sushi love. I love coming to Nikko to meet and bring friends for fun and entertainment as well as for great sushi! We were lucky couple times with celebrities comging here. Had an opportunity to take pictures with Jeff Gordan and the band Journey...WOW! What some fun nights it was! Most celebrities and athletes that are in town usually frequent this place. The atmosphere and the energy were vibrant as well as the crowd. The decor is very modern and sleek. The price is in the high end but it is well worth it. If there's no celebrity, the good looking bartender Kevin is also nice to look at if you prefer to dine at a bar, but it can get pretty crowded. When craving for sushi and martini, I will return to satisfy my sushi love."}
{"text":"WATCH OUT!    Keep a close eye on your receipt and keep your signed receipt.  Case in point, I dined there with friends and we split the bill.  I gave money to my friend and they left the tip on their bill (large bill for the table).  The waitress mixed up the receipts and he signed mine and vice versa.  Nikko knows that they made the mistake but they will not fix it.  They want my friend that lives out the country to call them and pay them the money to fix the mistake.  Ridiculous! Food is overpriced and customer service stinks worse than a piece of sushi left in a hot car.  Nikko you have now lost a loyal customer and all of my friends...I will NEVER dine there again on principle that you refuse to make things right.    Instead of Nikko...I recommend Pisces Sushi in the metropolitan or Ru San's.  Try the tempura fried oreo's at Pisces...delicious!"}
{"text":"I've been to Nikko's several times over the years, and have always had fun while enjoying the ambiance, the food and Nikko herself!  That's right,  most evenings Nikko is walking around in her black or white cowboy hat greeting (and sometimes dancing with) patrons and taking pictures.    As far as the food - if you love sushi this is probably a top 3 spot in CLT for sushi.  They've got a loong sushi bar w/several chefs creating a variety of unique and classic sushi options.  I usually run one or two of their daily sushi roll specials.  They also have your classic hibachi/stir-fry/teriyaki-style selections served with steamed veggies and rice - try the salmon.   Service is usually straight here, although I wouldn't say spectacular.  For example, they don't hide the fact that they are closing in 45min and want you to leave - hehe.  Regardless of how busy they are, food always seems to come out in a timely manner and just as you ordered it.  My one complaint is sometimes this place lacks a bit of couth.  I am all for a DJ on Friday & Saturday nights - but does it have to be so extremely loud you can't carry on a convo w/ the person next to you?  If you are looking for a laid-back, quiet experience this is NOT the place.  Complimentary valet parking.   The food is always exceptional.  The service is good.  The ambiance is modern, hip and trendy.  I will def be back,  but could you just turn the music down a bit though?"}
{"text":"I love Nikkos!! Joanna is so much fun and always keep the place upbeat and festive. Sushi is incredible and always fresh. I find the prices are a bit high, but really the atmosphere is what keeps you coming back. There is a Dj on the weekends and celebrating a birthday or anniversary is always welcome. Sometimes there is a birthday surprise that will be delivered to your table. I recommend sitting at the sushi bar, the chefs will custom make you rolls and give you tips on what to try!"}
{"text":"Great rolls. Really loved my sushi. First place i tried in charlotte was terrible. Nikko redeemed charlottes sushi for me!"}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere but the hostess and owner(look for woman on cowboy hat) were both unnecessarily snooty to our group of 30 something nice looking crowd.  Will not be back."}
{"text":"A large group of friends went to Nikko on Saturday for a friend's birthday.  They did a great job accommodating us, especially since we had such a large group and it was a Saturday night.  I tend to get really overwhelmed when ordering sushi for a number of reasons. First off, there's so many options. Secondly, I know what I like, but always want to try something new. Thirdly, I either order way too much food or not enough.  Saturday's decisions were made mainly off of the name. Sounds ridiculous, right? I ordered the Dancing Queen and Drunken Salmon.  The Dancing Queen is \"steamed asparagus and spicy tuna topped with spicy guacamole and tempura chips\".  It was delicious.  I will give this roll credit (or blame?) for morphing me into a dancing queen later on in the evening.  The Drunken Salmon was very light and described as \"salmon toro marinated in Grand Marnier sauce topped with radish sprout with a side of creamy jalapeno sauce.  I loved that the creamy sauce came on the side rather than being drizzled over the salmon.  The sauce was great, but it was good to be able to control how much of it was used.    There's always such a great energy and vibe going on in Nikko.  Good music, good people and great staff."}
{"text":"We went here for a dinner for two. The food was good - try the bean ice cream, was great! The scenery looks cool but hard to enjoy as the music was super loud - not that many matrons were there so that might have affected the noise. Don't think we will be going back"}
{"text":"Wasted $92 on dinner smh... an hour for food for a party of 20. Never got updated on food wait time, only got refilled drinks once. Servers seemed lost & confused with our table orders. Cold food. Just terrible."}
{"text":"Great sushi, fun environment. The fish is always fresh and the sushi rice is done right. Come here if you're looking for a fun dinner with friends before a night out on the town.  Sake Bombs for everyone!"}
{"text":"Everytime I'm on break from college, I come here to get their sushi. It's that good. I've been told by relatives who've worked here that fish is flown in twice a week so the fish quality is top notch. I tend to favor the cucumber specialty roll and the spicy tuna handroll. The cucumber roll is heavenly due to the presence of shiso and the spicy tuna blend here  is the best I've ever had from any sushi restaurant.  While the sushi is good, the kitchen items are subpar for the price. You can get much better Japanese dishes at other restaurants for less. Out of the dishes I've tried, I've only like the bulgogi which I'm not sure is on the menu anymore.    I can't say much about service since I do primarily takeout but takeout has always been quick and efficient."}
{"text":"Took out of town friends to nikko's last night for dinner. Not a good experience at all. New server who didn't know the food nor the drink menus. Two friend for the teriyaki shrimp and chicken. Both WAY over cooked. Like jerky.  I've eaten at nikko's several time in the past and I have had great experiences. Maybe this was an off night?"}
{"text":"I love Nikkos!!! Been going here since it was in the small venue across the parking lot!  This place by FAR has the best sushi!  The chefs are amazing and the owner Joanna is always there ready to keep the energy lively.  If you want cheap smelly raw fish then please go elsewhere.  You get what you pay for here! SUSHI LOVE!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came multiple times and each time it was better than the last! Yes it's loud yes it's crowded most times. But, it's definitely worth the wait. The service is great and the food is even better! I definitely reccomend to come for date night or night our with the girls! No kids at night because it does get pretty loud. Other than that. Great experience! I'd definitely come again."}
{"text":"Ok, let's start off by saying everything everyone said about it being a club, uber-hip style atmosphere is absolutely correct.  Now onto the sushi.  The first time I went there was phenomenal.  But that could be because all I the sushi I had recently was from 2 terrible sushi places :P.  The 2nd time was just \"good.\"  The 3rd time was solid, better than the 2nd, and not as good as the first.  That being said it seems almost hit or miss.  I'll keep going back until I find a better place."}
{"text":"Wow. Service sucked a lot. We waited over an hour for our food then got the wrong order. Never got the food we ordered. Lots of large groups. Wait staff and management did not care."}
{"text":"Great location on the south end to have dinner with some friends or as a date. Place had various drinks to order and food to eat. A little overpriced but well worth. Customer service is on point and best to reserve in advance for a party larger than 5. Environment well lit and clean. More modernized than most asian restaurants."}
{"text":"The restaurant's got a pretty hip atmosphere when you walk in.  The decor is very stylish and club-like.  The service is pretty attentive.  However, the food is another story.  Maybe I'm used to good Japanese food, but this place does not pass muster.  We ordered a variety of sushi, as well as udon and teriyaki dishes.  I think they try too hard to be all things to all people in having such an extensive menu.  The result is that everything is mediocre and doesn't warrant the price, IMHO.  Our server even had trouble pronouncing some of the dishes, like \"nigiri\" sushi."}
{"text":"Checked out Nikkos for the first time last night, to celebrate some close friends birthdays. We were pleasantly surprised upon arrival to find that they offer complimentary valet parking- fantastic!   We had a larger group (13) and made reservations, but most of our guests were caught in Hornets game traffic. We had to wait till 80% of our party arrived to be seated, which was fine. We had plenty of time to have a drink and enjoy the scenery. The restaurant in itself is extremely swanky and upscale. It was much larger than I had anticipated, and the decor was top notch. Apparently on Friday & Saturday nights that have a DJ, so there was almost a \"club vibe\" going on. Perfect for my rowdy group of friends! The host staff was slightly snippy, however we were late so I can't blame them.  We were seated once our entire group arrived, at a large table near the back. Since it's Queen's Feast week, the whole place was very full. I browsed the QF menu, but since we had a night of drinking planned I decided to save some space for the liquids :) Our table was set up without enough menus for everyone, which I assumed was probably because they were so busy.   I chose to stick with beer, but many of my friends had cocktails & were impressed. For dinner, I had the chicken fried rice. This was fine, slightly drier than I expected but nothing that a little soy sauce couldn't fix. Everyone that ordered sushi enjoyed their meals immensely. The only negative part was that it probably took 30 minutes for all of us to receive our meals. They would bring one plate out at a time. Most of us work in the service industry so it wasn't a huge deal. The service was great, the staff kept our drinks full & processed our payments quickly. The quirky owner, Joanna, came over with her tambourine & danced right along with us.   Overall, quite enjoyable."}
{"text":"A little pricier than Ru San's, Nikko has great sushi.  The spicy tuna is excellent, and the ginger salad, with mixed greens instead of head lettuce, is a nice size.  There's even some entertainment when Joanna puts on her cowboy hat and dances on the bar...but you'll have to see that for yourself."}
{"text":"My favorite sushi place in Charlotte. The new space is much less quaint than the original Uptown location, but it's much larger and cosmopolitan. I moved from Washington, DC; going to Nikko makes me feel like I'm in a larger, more trendy city (sorry Charlotte, I like ya but you're still a small town on the rise). They recently added some outdoor dining space which seems to be used for lounging and private parties."}
{"text":"It has only taken me 3 years to try this place. Ever since I've moved here I've heard stories, good and no-so-much, and finally I had to try it out for myself. I happened to be in the area but not so sure I would have made the special trip.   You have to park in the garage, 4th floor, or do valet. They make you work for entrance and you have to really want their sushi.   The sushi and entrees were good and pricey and the service was just okay. I didn't come after 8pm, so apparently I missed the \"show.\" However, I wasn't too disappointed in missing the club music or sake bomb encouraging owner.   Now I can check this place off my list. I love sushi and this one filled my craving."}
{"text":"I hate this place. Friends had raved and raved about it, but I did not see what was so great about it when I finally went with a couple of friends. Bizzare modern decor, overdressed severs, hostesses, and clientele, food is good but overshadowed by the trying-too-hard NYC atmosphere (but there are TVs set to sports channels..?). We are in CHARLOTTE. Are you kidding me? Get over yourself! Prices are also overkill. I loved the sushi over at Dean and Deluca Wine Bar in Southpark (unexpected I know) but I think the sushi chef moved to Rooster's last I heard. HIs name is Cy, he is the best sushi chef in Char. So I would recommend you go...elsewhere, not here.  P.S. The best part of this restaurant is it's in the hated, heinous \"Pink Building\" on South Blvd."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to do a review of this place since last November when I went out to Charlotte to visit my cousin.  Great place...I really liked the decor; waterfalls in the front.  Lighting was nice..ambiance was fancy and comfortable.  Very mod and chic, if you're into that kinda thing.  I had a roll there that was one of the top 3 rolls I've ever had.  I think it was called the Orgasm.  Haha ok it wasn't called that but it was good.  Some crunchy salmon something or other with sprinkles of mmm-mmm a side order of YUM.  Very tasty food overall.    I guess one of the drawback is the pricing given it is on the expensive side.  But honestly I'm willing to throw down a few extra bucks with the right combination of service, decor and good food.  Keep in mind I'm coming from the Southern California region...I'd probably be first to admit if this wasn't worth it.    Overall had a good experience...maybe I was riding off the holidays and being in a new town but I enjoyed myself.  Try it out when you want a treat."}
{"text":"Paul's Yelp Elite Rating: Solid 4 Stars!  Popped my Nikko cherry today.....YEAY! Went to celebrate my dear friend Tammy's XXth birthday today, and since she loves all things sushi, as do I AND haven't been here before, I said what the hell! Lock the cat in and jump in the car!  First off, it really is nice in here! Ultra modern with gorgeous liquor and sushi bars, with a warm blue light eminating from underneath. We got there at 630pm and it was D E A D. Not as in \"The Walking...\" but just DEAD. Must be the Holiday weekend cuz 630pm is NOT THAT EARLY, is it? Maybe I'm just getting old....??? Uggggggggggg..  Discovered that Thursday is HALF PRICE COCKTAIL night! Woo Hoo! Had 4 for the price of 2. Can't beat that. Oh, and they were really good!  Started with the Kukuni appetizer, which is a 10 hour slow braised PORK BELLY! That sweet soy sauce (typically called \"kecap manis\") used as the marinade was divine....PORK BELLY! It was very delicious!  Instead of painstakingly describe each of the dishes we ordered, I'm just going to summarize: Had the Korean Style Kalbi Style BBQ Beef Ribs which had sweet marinade that was slightly \"burned\" on the grill and that flavor was DIVINE! Our favorite dish of the night. Ordered 2 rolls: The Dancing Queen (an unusal asparagus roll topped with spicy guacamole and The Cowboy Roll, which had shrimp tempura, spicy tuna and avocado, topped with Kobe steak and garlic olive oil sauce. Both were really good (just not SUSHI GURU good - that's my story and I'm sticking to it).  Had to finish off this belly stuffing dinner with their Banana Fritter, which was tempura bananas with an orange honey dipping sauce and ginger ice cream. Our waitress was kind enough to put a little candle in the ice cream for Tammy's birthday, which was a nice touch! BUT, kind gestures aside, this was the weakest component of our meal (IMHO). While not bad, the \"tempura\" was bready and not crispy as you'd expect tempura to be. In addition, the amazing SOUNDING orange honey dipping sauce was quite watery and had very little viscosity....not quite a \"sauce\" in Chez Paul's opinion. The ginger ice cream was decent, but the overall dessert was average to below average....thus losing the extra star.  Really glad we came for sure. As other Yelpers have stated, this is NOT the cheapest Sushi place in town. It's quite a bit more than my standard bearer Sushi Guru and not quite as good - in my opinion. And the longer we sat the louder it got....definitely a \"techno-bar\" atmosphere which is OK with me since that's my favorite kind of music, but I can see how that MAY be annoying to those not into that genre of music.  Definitely recommended!"}
{"text":"My friends and were planning a girls weekend and I made reservations for 12 at Nikko's a month and a half ago. We ended up needing to push our reservation back and they were very accommodating. Get to the restaurant at 8:45 pm (reservation was at 9), I checked in with the guy at the front and told him we were early, but wanted to check in. He said it would be a few minutes. I told him that was fine as we were 15 minutes early. Five after 9 and they haven't called my name. My friends goes to check and is told 10 minutes. 10 minutes comes and goes, we go check again. We are told that the table they are going to give to us is still seated (they have already paid, but haven't gotten up). About 9:30 I go to follow up again and I'm told the same thing. At this point I'm thinking 1. Either let the table know hey we are extremely crowded tonight and have a long wait, so that they can wrap up their conversation or 2. stop seating these parties of 3 or 4 people who are just walking and start pushing tables together, to accommodate the multiple parties you have waiting . The guy at the front says I can get you a drink on me, well sir there are 11 people in my party and it's not really fair for me to be the only one to get something and not everyone who is waiting, I said what about the rest of my party. He just looked at me and squeezed my arm. At this point I notice that there is another customer who keeps going to the hostess stand as well. I went to ask him what time was his reservation and he tells me his was at 9 for a party of 10 and he keeps getting the same run around. Finally get seated about 9:45 (45 minutes later), get to the table and there aren't enough menus, so we are sharing menus, its another 10 minutes before the waiter actually gets to our table. He finally comes, brings us water, takes our orders. Food comes out and it's even more problems. My friend sitting across from me  ordered one of the same sushi rolls I did but she asked for no mayo. He brings the plate out with my other sushi roll on it, but no mayo on the roll we had a like. He goes did you all switch seats, I said no we didn't. He goes oh ok I'll fix this. I said well just have the roll prepared with everything and I'll just take my other roll from her when it comes out. He brings back the roll still with no mayo. One of my friends asked for the tempura app and got the tempura roll. Another friend wanted shrimp with veggies and got the tempura roll. She told him that wasn't what she asked for, and explained what she wanted. He came back with tempura shrimp and veggies (Still not what she wanted). When the checks came, we were all ready to pay and had our cards/money ready. It took about 20 minutes for him to cash us out. When he came back with our cards and receipts he had the nerve to say gratuity was already included and if we wanted to add extra we could. We could clearly see that gratuity was included when we looked at our bill the first time, and his service nor the service we received at the restaurant was worth what was included, so to basically ask for extra  was an insult. The manager,  nor the owner (who was in the restaurant) apologized for our 45 minute wait or the multiple mix ups that happened with our food. The best part of the night was the live DJ they had.  I will not be going back nor recommending this place to anyone else."}
{"text":"Food came out really fast! That's a good thing for most people but I wanted to enjoy my Saturday night in hopes to listen to the music starting around 8.  Soup salad and edamame came out within minutes.  That's a great thing. Sushi came out quickly after which is awesome. I asked our sweet attentive waitress twice that I wanted it spread out time wise but that's ok  Food was amazing. Volcano roll and Cowboy roll then scallop app at end to keep us there a little longer.  Free valet parking a plus!!! Got there right at 7pm and gone by 8pm."}
{"text":"I really hope that Yelp starts the 1/2 star concept coz I want to give Nikkos a 3 1/2 stars. Nikkos looks likes a Sushi joint transplant from NYC. Its a bit odd that the owner dances around with her tambourine...but I guess thats entertainment? I wont lie, this place is expensive but the special rolls are pretty damn good. Their Dancing queen rolls and mexican rolls are yum. We take our guests out to Nikkos coz its fun place to get some sushi and pre game before heading out for the night. It not really a every weekend kinda place; why.....because I dont want to deck out to eat sushi and pay an arm and a leg every time I have a sushi craving."}
{"text":"Amazing sushi. Go in the evening for the happy hour and the owner will dance for the whole restaurant. It is strange, but entertaining."}
{"text":"Club Nikko!!! I came here (Saturday at 8:30pm) with a group of 9 to start our night out to celebrate my birthday. We made a reservation in-advance and we were seated upon arrival. The atmosphere was very modern (I felt like I was in NyC) and the music was poppin. They even had a DJ! Our friends told us in advance about the DJ and loud music so we thought this would be the perfect dinner and drink spot before going out. We even joked later when we went dancing that the music at Nikko was better than the DJ on the dance floor. I guess they have a live DH every Saturday starting at 8.   This place was also packed with birthday, graduation and bachelorette parties-some tables were holding 20+ people so this is a great place for large parties. I recommend making a reservation.   We all started with appetizers and my husband and I got the calamari. The calamari was basic (deep fried), but placed on a bed of lettuce with a spicy Thai sauce. It was tasty. For dinner we all got sushi, but they did have other options including hibachi. The mango tango roll was my favorite roll and it was HUGE! I would get it again.  For drinks I got the cucumber martini, which was on point! Very refreshing.   The owner was also very entertaining as she would jump from table to table and mingle with everyone. You could tell she enjoyed her job.   Overall great time at Nikko and will definitely be back before a night out! Oh and if it's your birthday make sure you tell them ;-) you will get a \"surprise\" treat."}
{"text":"Dined in with my boyfriend tonight. Interior of this restaurant is very posh and upscale looking. It gives off a really nice atmosphere. Perfect for date nights! We came in around 6 PM on a Saturday night and it wasn't too busy yet. But my boyfriend says how it's typically pretty busy on the weekends. In fact, on our way out, we noticed a DJ booth set up in the corner towards the front of the restaurant where the host stands were at.   Our server was Jackie tonight. She was so sweet and catered to all of our needs. She was on point with everything! She definitely gets 5 stars.   However, the food gets 4 stars. No complaints about wait time-- All of our food came out promptly. We ordered the sashimi deluxe and calamari as our appetizer. Sashimi was fresh. Calamari had a funny odor it gave off, but it didn't taste bad. It's topped with sweet and sour sauce that I didn't care too much for. We also got a salad that came with this delicious dressing and miso soup that was super flavorful. As for our entrées, my boyfriend got the filet mignon and lobster dish and I ordered the shrimp, scallops, and lobsters dish. In my opinion, it was a tad bit too salty. And I love all things salty!! Or maybe my taste buds were off tonight. I tried my boyfriend's filet mignon, and I'm not a meat/beef person AT ALL but it was pretty soft! I can now see how people say how certain types of steaks can just melt in your mouth. Finished our meal off with red bean tempura ice cream. Pretty good! Overall, it was pretty good here! Will come again. Thanks again, Jackie!"}
{"text":"Terrible hosting service!  Wife and I waited almost an hour and a half, watched several couples walk in without reservations and get accommodated with seats at the sushi bar, while we stared at an empty high top table that wasn't even offered to us after several conversations telling us it would just be \"a little bit longer\".  Unless you look like you belong in South Beach expect terrible service."}
{"text":"This is a great sushi spot, however there are some things it could improve on. Free valet is always a nice plus, since the parking looked pretty hard to find a spot. First walk in and I felt a bit too casual for a sushi restaurant. It's a very modern feel, and everyone seemed to be wearing suits, probably shouldn't have worried too much though since later on in the evening the music suddenly pumped straight up and the owner came out in a feather boa and tambourine doing sake bombs!  The food was very hit or miss for me, not to mention kind of overpriced for what you get. The nigiri sushi and rolls are very fresh and innovative. The nigiri was a little big for my mouth though. The beef sukiyaki I ordered was hideously sweet. Almost felt like I was eating a dessert. I ended up not touching much of it, so I was still quite hungry and ended up eating off everyone else's plates. The udon and other beef dishes I tried from my company were fine though, so maybe I just had a messed up meal. However they did not ask at all if I liked my sukiyaki at all and that is not all right at all considering how much I paid for it!  It was a pretty good meal that I bummed off everyone else, the service is good, the problem is everything just seems good not great. The sushi here bumps this up another star. I think next time I will just make a meal out of only sushi here, it's that good!"}
{"text":"The food here is amazing. I wish it was more affordable because I would come more often! I'd describe this place as somewhat upscale, very trendy and great for late night. The drinks are goooood but pricey. I love Korean beef and it is sooo delicious here. The sushi is always good too and now I want to go back...bye."}
{"text":"Best Sushi in town hands down.  Good luck eating there on a Friday Night without waiting 30+ minutes though.  Try the crazy rolls in a margarita glass. I will say you're bill will rack up quickly if you are hungry and drown a Saki bomb or two.  Est on a sushi meal is $15-21 + drinks  Also keep in mind that the sushi is made to order. So, you will have to wait but the owner is wild and crazy and will help pass the time."}
{"text":"This restaurant was absolutely beautiful inside!!!   FOOD- teriyaki salmon with rice and miso soup. PERFECT SALMON WAS COOK MEDIUM!! It's was not dry, cooked just right!! The was not a small piece either. The fried Rice's was yummy and I love the miso soup!! I should have gotten a big vowel of it lol.   INSIDE- BEAUTIFUL low lighting. The blue wall light by the bar was beautiful! The have a private room for party. And also fire pit outside."}
{"text":"I got love for Nikkos. Used to go during my lunch a few times but never went on the weekend. It's like a party in that joint. Loud music, everybody having a good time, plenty of TVs so you can watch the playoffs which was on last night and of course good sushi. I gotta hit this spot up more often."}
{"text":"When I worked in South End, this used to be the place my coworkers and I would go to when we wanted sushi for lunch. Prices were reasonable and food always excellent.  If you do go for lunch, I would suggest walking there if possible. Otherwise, you have to park on the 3rd or 4th level, then take an elevator to the first floor.   Side note: They must do excellent dinner/weekend business because that place was always nearly empty when I went at lunch."}
{"text":"The scene is nice here and the sushi is good.  Lots of energy here."}
{"text":"Best sushi in Charlotte.  Thursday -Saturday always busy but large to accommodate quickly.   The menu on the Specials page are all creations of the amazing owner Joana, and she will make your event fun as well as tasty."}
{"text":"This is a perfect sushi restaurant for a business lunch or wild and crazy birthday dinner. You can sit at the sushi bar or at regular tables and booths. You can stick to pretty traditional fare like a California roll, or venture to try something more exciting like squid or salmon. I love, love, love their Gyoza ( a delicious dumpling you have to try or you haven't lived yet) and the Stained Glass martini, which combines amaretto and midori among other liqueurs and somehow tastes fantastic! You haven't gone to Nikko's unless you have gone for a celebration of some type and ordered Saki bombs, because this is when Nikko herself, clad in an outrageous outfit of some sort topped with a cowboy hat comes out with a musical flourish and does shots with your entire table. Usually she has a tambourine which she insists on keeping time on your bottom or hers. From the art and design just in the bathrooms, to the club thumping beats the dj drops on the weekend, it's a blast and I will continue to keep going."}
{"text":"I gotta say my boyfriend and I were very impressed by the food!  Sushi was to die for!   We certainly had great service liked the ambience of the place. We ordered the volcano roll which packs allot of flavor I didn't want it to end lol! Definitely get the cowboy roll the Kobe beef with sushi I was in love with the favors. Last we had the Godzilla roll which also had a great taste. We have gone to some sushi places that are good but not crazy about it. But Nikkos we will def be coming back for sure. I highly recommend this place to anyone that wants high quality flavorful sushi."}
{"text":"Disappointed. The staff was rude upon arrival. The host clearly was having a bad day or lacked people skills all together. We also waited 10 minutes to be greeted by a server, as everyone one of them walked past us the whole time. We where just about to leave before greeted. Food wasn't good either. Spending what we did for a table of two I expected more. It's sad because we come to charlotte all the time. We Ate here once before and it was perfect."}
{"text":"A great place for a business dinner when you want to impress friends from out of town or a nice dinner out with the wife! Great sushi, the best edamame I've had."}
{"text":"Yikes! I had to bump my review down to 3 stars from the coveted 5.  I went to Nikko earlier this week on a friend date and I was so excited!  Well, I left feeling very disappointed.  I ordered my usual Shiitake Mushrooms appetizer and I was quite pleased although the portion was noticeably smaller than previous orders.  I decided to order the Rainbow Roll which for those of you who are not sushi addicts like myself, it is a roll that is topped with different types of fish and avocado which makes a beautiful rainbow presentation.  This is usually a more expensive roll but quite tasty!  When the server brought over my sushi, I could not believe how small it was.  Each roll was maybe a little bigger than the size of a quarter.  Also, out of the 8 pieces 4 of them were completely covered in avocado.  So half my roll had no fish on it.  Worse yet, the avocado was brown in several spots which means it was a little too old!  I let the server know that I was disappointed and pointed out the the avocado was brown in several areas.  She said she would have it \"re-made\" for me.  Well, when she brought it back, it was literally the same exact roll but the chef had sliced the brown avocado into smaller pieces and laid them on their side.  I almost couldn't believe they gave me the same exact roll and didn't at least give me fresh avocado!  Additionally, the server never asked me if it was better or checked to make sure everything was OK after that.  Can't say I left feeling impressed!"}
{"text":"I went to Nikko for a work lunch event with a group of 8. We didn't have a reservation or anything (don't know if they take them for lunch) but we were sat immediately, and our waitron was out within a minute or two. The service was great throughout. Always quick drink refills, knowledgeable answers to questions, and generally joking and friendly.   I am certainly do not claim to be a sushi connoisseur, but I really enjoyed the couple of rolls I ordered. I went kind of vanilla on one, just getting a bagel roll, but what blew me away was the Volcano Roll. To quote the menu, \"A shrimp tempura roll topped with Dynamite mix (scallops, crab, & octopus) topped with a baked spicy aioli sauce\". Yum. A great amount of spice but every single flavor still came out. Some may call it complex, I just say delicious.   Nikko is also in a very good location for South Enders to walk to, and apparently things can get bumping in the evenings after the dinner crowd is winding down. I hear the lights go down and they start pumping club music and distributing Sake Bombs. Had to save those for another day though..."}
{"text":"So me and my bestie from out of town decided to go to Nikko on a early Saturday afternoon, when we arrive the place was dead! with maybe 2 tables occupied. We go to front desk to be seated, the guy runs over and pretend to look in the system, I thought he was trying to find us a good seat, but he looks up and tells me that they have a lot of reservations and we can sit at the bar!! Ok so this place is gonna be packed with every seat reserved soon?? The place straight dead!! I absolutely feel like me and my friend was discriminated against!! I told him NO, and we hike our butts to Rai Lay a Block down and had the best sushi and service. I would never go to this place again"}
{"text":"This review is from over the holidays. I was there to meet a group but had arrived early so I went to the bar to wait and have a drink. It took forever to get either bartenders' attention. They were busy but after watching them go back and forth; not stopping to greet or acknowledge me sitting there, I finally just got her attention. That was a little off putting, I know it was a busy night.  The atmosphere is definitely club meets sushi restaurant. They had a DJ that started about 830 or so. Know that it will be loud if you come here on a weekend.  Fine with our group as we had booked our dinner with the intention of a place to have a little fun. We were seated in one of the back rooms which was nice to put a little distance from the music so we chat and catch up. Dinner was fantastic.  Obviously there is a full sushi menu and other dishes. The Korean beef ribs were really good. I also had the black cod and it was well flavored and a good size portion. Everyone seemed to enjoy their dinner selections. Our server was great and kept up with the constant flow of drinks and champagne bottles being ordered. The owner made it a point to come to our table. She even sat with us for a bit and chatted. She walks around a lot talking to almost every table and chatting with regulars. She really seems like she wants to make sure everyone that comes to her restaurant has a good time, good food and good drinks.  We made our way back to the bar for after dinner drinks. I had a lychee martini-it was really good and strong. I am giving 4 stars because I think you never get a 2nd chance to make a 1st impression, and my initial experience at the bar wasn't the best. Overall a great night out and I definitely recommend it especially if you want to enjoy great food in a club like atmosphere. And I have always heard good things about Nikko's."}
{"text":"You do not want to go to this place if you are expecting good service.  They care more about making it a club setting while trying to serve dinner. We had 5 people and one ordered sushi everyone finished their dinner before the sushi even came to the table.  It took over 5 minutes to get drinks to come to the table.  I do not think I will come back.  This place is way overrated and priced for what you get.  There are a lot better place to go and with better service."}
{"text":"I absolutely love the Sushi here. The rolls are great and the service is always excellent. The sexy salmon is to die for! Each time I come I try a new roll and I am always impressed. It's definitely a place I would go over and over again."}
{"text":"By my check-ins you guys should now know my love for sushi.... That being said, eh.  I went to Nikko because it is walking distance and I am currently unable to drive. Lets just say I'll stick to ordering delivery or getting an uber to drive me to my favorites for now.  The sushi was nothing to write home about. My main takeaway was that the sushi was small and was mostly rice. We ordered the Rainbow, spicy tuna, godzilla, and then the cowboy roll. The gozilla and cowboy roll were recommend by our waitress after asking us what flavors we like (spicy is my jam ;)  ). The gozilla roll was on point, good recommendation. I was excited for the Cowboy roll, I thought it would be like the surf and turf roll at cowfish, unfortunately it was not. My friend took one bite and decided it was awful. I just didn't think the flavors mixed well together. Of course my friend was talked into one more piece, where we both decided that it is much better cold and to not dip it in soy sauce. I finished the rest of it like a champ because momma didn't  raise a quitter. (That is a total lie, mom would definitely say I should stop eating when I'm full)  Our bill was slightly over $100 without tip at that point,  we did have a couple drinks with dinner as well. Ijust wasn't impressed.  Really the stars are for the staff and the ambience. Are waitress was lovely, I have zero complaints besides the recommendation of the cowboy roll. Also the place is pretty neat looking with cozy booths, and large circular tables for big parties.   Good luck fellow Yelpers!"}
{"text":"The only reason why it's getting 2 stars is because the good is actually good here. But the service has been absolutely awful this evening. Drinks have been forgotten. The waiter forgot to put in our birthday girl's order. When he told her that he forgot, they STILL didn't put it in. When they realized they messed up, they stopped coming to check on us. The drinks were not up to standard. Needless to say, this used to be a place we come, but won't be back anymore. Surely disappointed in the evening."}
{"text":"I could eat sushi for ever meal and this was one of the worst quality sushi places that I've been to in Charlotte. Their sushi wasn't what I expected. Me along with 5 other girls were extremely disappointed in all of our rolls. After biting into one of my rolls I pulled 2 chunks of plastic out. After bringing attention to my waitress she told her manager and he didn't even come over and apologize. I wasn't able to eat any more of my meal after that. Our waitress had a terrible attitude all night and was pretty rude. Safe to say we all agreed that we will never be eating here again."}
{"text":"Great sushi! Even better staff. It's a great place to go for \"happy hour\" when you want to let your hair down and feel sexy!!! The owner is a little fire cracker be prepared to dance with her on the weekends."}
{"text":"Try their Super Crunchy Roll! I swear this is the best Sushi place in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Nikko is fun for a club like ambience if you're party mood.  I've been to Nikko several times due to friend's celebrations, etc.  The food is pretty mediocre and bland for certain dishes.  My biggest complaint during my last randevú would have to be the THICK sashimi slices.  Mind you, I have a LOVE for sashimi but it has to be cut in edible portions for you to devour and enjoy, piece by piece.  The thick slices made the meal less appetizing and I had to cut all of the sashimi down to pieces.  The sashimi gave me an upset stomach, it's either that or the multiple incorrect drink orders that were place in front of me (Parton instead of Tito's).  The pros for this place include the friendly owner and the manager Anthony.  All in all, I know I have to revisit this establishment again in the future and want to provide this constructive feedback so Nikko can fix the cuts of the sashimi."}
{"text":"Nikko is a great sushi place!  I came here only two days after I had moved to Charlotte, and was surprised to see how busy and bumpin it was on a Thursday night around 7.  Don't let the look of it from the outside fool you, I was worried we'd have to wait awhile, but the restaurant is huge and a lot of people sit up at the bar, so there was no wait for us at all! Very good selection of sushi, and our waiter was very helpful (even though she said it was only her first week).  The rolls were tight and very tasty.  Vegetable tempura was a good start.   Prices not bad, it's sushi after all, cheap sushi scares me anyway :-)"}
{"text":"Start by saying the sushi is decent not the worst I've had but not the best either also a little pricey.   Summary: order the sushi and nothing else, don't go on the weekends or you will be at club Nikko's where there is no dance floor but the DJ is pumping out techno so loud you can't hear anyone at your own table, and be ready to pay a pretty penny for mediocre sushi.  Now as for the 2 stars. Went to Nikko's last night for a business dinner and I'm on a no carb diet so I order a NY strip steak with a side salad. Granted I know this is not a steak house and they probably cook one steak a week, but I expected a little better for the 27$ price tag. First off, I asked for ranch as my salad dressing and was told they only have a house dressing. Which is weird since they have literally 8 different full size salads on the menu. I ordered my steak medium rare and when I receive the steak it's barely a quarter inch thick, no was on earth was is an 8oz steak. To top it off it was well done and covered in teriyaki sauce. I sent it back and got back a black and blue steak (raw in the middle) which I much rather eat than a well done steak, but still not what I asked for. That being said service is always on point and quick with the refills and are normally decently friendly.   Side note what is up with the pictures of what I can only assume to be the owner everywhere in different costumes? Also be prepared to see her in rare form on the weekends in a costume or cowboy hat walking around taking pictures with people...."}
{"text":"Nice modern hip looking place. Attractive customers and I felt I was in for a treat.  I sat at the sushi bar as I had to get my fish fix. I travel a lot and good sushi is usually something I look for. Hard to find however...  I ordered the sushi/sashimi omakase which leaves it up to the chef to choose what you get. My only stipulation...no mackerel! Now what I got was fresh and delicious with good portions, but sadly, for the premium price of this meal, I got the same old selection; tuna, salmon, shrimp, eel and a whitefish. I was hoping for some octopus, yellowtail or even pay extra for some butterfish (which I've only had once at Ki in Toronto and it's like buttah baby!). The roll was some lame spicy salmon or something like that with fake crab filler. I never usually order rolls but if I do I love the rainbow roll. I'm all about the fish.  Sake was Ty Ku black which is always good and dry. If you want to drop some sake cash, try the Ty Ku white. Sake and sushi, love love love.  For what I got it deserves a solid 4 stars but because of the lack of imagination and even weak presentation, I give it 3 starfish."}
{"text":"This rating is solely based on their sushi -- their delicious, unique, flavor packed sushi. Located in South End, this restaurant and sushi bar has a bomb Specialty Creation sushi menu that hits on all types of flavor combinations! They've also got full service bar so if you don't like any of their cocktails or want any wine from their large wine menu, you can pretty much ask them to make anything your heart desires.  Service is good. It doesn't get overly busy so request to sit in a booth if you can or sit at the sushi bar and watch them make the rolls! They've even got a private room for if you have a party/celebration.   Recommendations:  * Volcano Roll: shrimp tempura roll topped with a spicy baked mix of scallops, crab, and octopus. If you love warm rolls and/or spicy rolls get this one! * Dancing Queen: steamed asparagus and spicy tuna, topped with spicy guacamole and tempura chips. This roll is cold but super refreshing with the guacamole on it! If you're looking to be adventurous, I would seriously try this one."}
{"text":"My friend and I were just looking for somewhere to have a nice dinner so we thought we'd check out the new Nikko location (just down the street from the old spot). Boy, that was a mistake. We weren't dressed in stilettos and short dresses, so we definitely didn't fit in. The wait for a table was unpleasant and long. With the color-changing panels, the restaurant's hip decor is just trying way too hard. It looks like something someone would build in the Sims. I mean, Charlotte is growing and slowly becoming more cosmopolitan, but Nikko is just over the top. The food was all right, though not incredibly impressive. We were already kind of angry at the whole experience by the time we finally got to eat."}
{"text":"Thank you, Nikko, for the best sushi we've had in a while!   We felt special from the superb valet parking service to...well...the superb valet parking service when we left!  We sat at the sushi bar and enjoyed a lovely sampler platter last Saturday, including sashimi, nigiri sushi and a tasty slightly spicy tuna roll.  For a couple of hungry people, the Sushi/Sashimi Omakase is a great value at about $36.  We also shared Age Dashi Tofu with Shrimp, served piping hot with an amazingly rich (almost beefy) dashi broth.  House sake is good.  This place has incredible atmosphere, and is a great 'night out on the town' place to go.  Decor is gorgeous and modern.  We were dressed pretty casual, but didn't feel under-dressed.  The sushi bar is fun and lively - and the prep line is impeccably clean and orderly.  Fish is fresh-fresh-fresh.  The chefs are well-trained and conscientious.  Bravo to the ownership and management.  Friday and Saturday nights, if you are in the restaurant around 7:30 or 8, you will feel a transformation as the lighting changes and the DJ starts mixing.  It gets LOUD.  But it's fun.  Nikko has great energy!  This is one of Charlotte's best."}
{"text":"My first ever yelp post I've ever done - We made a reservation to go on a Saturday night and although the food was great, our waitress forgot my wine order and eventually brought it to the table a few minutes after everyone else's drinks (we all ordered drinks at the same time) - which is fine, definitely wouldn't knock stars off for that.  Then, we ordered our food (again, all at the same time) and the waitress again brought out everyone's order at the table at the same time, but yet again my order didn't come until everyone else was finished eating.  The waitress said that it was a different chef making my order? and didn't apologize for the sushi being so late.  Then, a person in our party ordered another glass of the wine she was having and the waitress brought a glass of the wine I was drinking, not her.  When the bill came, I was still expected to pay full price for my meal and the second glass of wine that I didn't order.....  Food was great, but the waitress we had was less than alright."}
{"text":"The owner is a total b!tch.. She ordered appetizers for our large group of 17 people (at no ones request mind you) and tacked on another $400 to our bill. We were blown away.. The servers were great but we've never had a more unprofessional experience at a restaurant!!"}
{"text":"I recommend Nikko's. The sushi is good and the atmosphere is awesome. The waitstaff is good, but the bartenders could speed it up. Sometimes the restaurant gets pretty busy so we will order drinks while we wait on a table, but it can take a little while sometimes. Very cool place to go with friends. Make a reservation if it's going to be a group and you want a good table."}
{"text":"Can't believe the #manager and #service at #nikkos tonight. We were basically told \"your party can leave now\" after we sent our food back because our food was cold. He asked, \"why did you eat out of it first?\" Ummm, how would we know it was cold if we hadn't? ?After many visits to this establishment, I am truly shocked and disappointed......but hey, ?"}
{"text":"I've been to Nikko several times for birthdays and other special occasions. It seems fun, has awesome loud music and a DJ, and the sushi is more than decent. Their downfall is the service. The restaurant starts to get a club vibe after 8 pm on a Saturday and that's all fine and good -- some restaurants are very successful with a club/restaurant scene. But Nikko simply isn't good at it. The servers are far too flustered and backed up and distracted. Three out of 17 of our guests NEVER received their food. None of it. Not even an update. Those three guests left the restaurant to eat at a fast food chain down the street, instead. And again, this was for someone's birthday! The owner should focus more on great customer service, and spend less time dancing with drunk patrons. It was a horrible experience and put a really bad taste in my mouth. I won't be back for a celebration of any sort."}
{"text":"I'm not usually a sushi fan but I thought this place was really good.  I got the panko crusted scallops appetizer and cowboy roll and they were both great.  It was overall a little pricey but worth it."}
{"text":"1) Service, superb ;-) every staff member I encountered was friendly. It was a somewhat bland Sunday afternoon so not a lot of patrons, but  service was very efficient.  2) Food, excellent! I had the chicken teriyaki Nice portion sizes and prepared  just right. Also there is literally A BOOK for the wine selection alone! I'd come here just for that!  3) Ambiance, purely awesome.  4) Decor, simply gorgeous - interior is very modernistic Japanese style.  5) Great location!  There's the 5 stars. Yes, the menu is pricy. However, the combination of these 5 factors is what must be considered. Therefore worth it."}
{"text":"very good.  Great service.  The food is a bit pricey, but the restaurant ambiance is fantastic.  I would recommend for special occasions or group night's out."}
{"text":"I met this sushi chef, Soe, today and he is pretty innovative with his sushi - creating delicious and original dishes/rolls - as all sushi chefs should.  Picture attached."}
{"text":"Be prepared for 30 plus minute wait on weekend evening, we told there was a 30 minute wait then not seated for over an hour. We had to inquire as to why we'd not been seated and were told because we'd not closed our bar tab, Ok might have been nice to know considering we told the host we'd be at the bar. They have a full service bar with a very attentive bar staff. Service in general once seated was slow, the variety and quality of food sort of makes up for that issue. If you are a sushi person I feel certain you will enjoy their sushi bar/menu.  My husband had several raw sushi dishes that he enjoyed as well as a veggie roll dish we shared that was very good. My only disappointment was my rice cake, it was very tough, not a lot of taste and dry. My husband \"upgraded\" his rice with meal for fried rice for only $1 but it wasn't even worth the $1!!! It was very much like my fried rice cake, dry, mushy and little to no taste. That said we enjoyed the meal enough that we'd go back again. I'm not sure if our true age is beginning to \"show\" as we found their in house DJ to be playing much to loud. Music with a meal is always nice but when you feel as if you have to shout to hear the person directly next and or across from you, it's not enhancing to the meal. Again all of this said we'd for sure go back, just maybe not on a weekend evening."}
{"text":"Fantastic sushi spot with great energy!  Super sexy cool interior (can we say HUGE upgrade from their old space?!?!)  I love coming here for a fantastic sushi experience.  It WILL bite your wallet tho - a recent outing for 2 cost over 100 bucks - but was worth it!    They have valet parking most nights, but there is a free parking garage too if you drive past the valet dudes.  The spots are marked - they want you to park on only certain levels for the restaurant (I think it is level 4?)  Anyways - every time I have been the sushi has been super fresh and delicious.  They are very generous with roe topped-rolls and will bring you extra ginger upon request.    I was also delighted here one time by the seafood udon.  It wasn't the best I have ever had in my life but it was very good and very expensive.  Probably two can share this soup because it is so large.   It is a fun night when you go and the proprietor is there dancin around.  She loves it when you have a good time!    Their high-tops are great for people-watching and the djs they have keep the place hoppin.  Love it!  Thanks Nikko!"}
{"text":"I've gone here a few times and it's nothing out of this world.   The staff here is friendly and the food is ordinary. The space the restaurant is located in is nice and modern. I feel that they have settled into their routine and are coasting. That's not a bad thing, it just doesn't spring up top of mind when you say 'Let's go get sushi!' The food was good; the pricing was ok. My experiences have been uneventful at this location. I'd give it 2.5 stars if I could."}
{"text":"First impressions: cool place, great atmosphere with lots of energy (didn't mind the loud music)... great potential right?  Wrong... the sushi was just average and the wine list was horribly inappropriate for a sushi restaurant.  I left feeling like this is nothing but a \"scene\" - everybody puts on their party clothes and we all pretend the food/wine is great because this is not your typical boring restaurant, so we give them a free pass.  But in a town as big as CLT, we should expect more.  Its not good enough to just put a DJ up front and spin dance tunes... you gotta follow it up with quality food and wine.  Is that too much to ask?  Expect more Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Even though we went on New Years Eve the service was great! The wait was kinda lengthy but that's to be expected. Our waitress was friendly and made delicious recommendations. I had the green curry chicken and shrimp and my fiance had a rib plate that was full of flavor. I'll add pictures. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Best sushi I've ever had. Sushi Boat Fan #1! (Wish I had more stomach to eat everything from the menu, though.) Valet service. Friendly service. Ambient, chic, night-life kind of feel with an open floor plan. Well-kept clean restrooms and dining area. We live quite a bit away from Charlotte but we'll travel there for the sushi for when we need awesome sushi. So yeah, 5 stars!"}
{"text":"New Year's Eve - We appreciated the valet on this cold night. The sushi was great and we both agreed, freshest we've ever had. We ordered the sushi for two boat and although New Year's Eve was slammed, packed, and almost to standing room only, we had our meal in only about an hour. [The soup and salad were both delicious. A+ on hippy, casual, chic atmosphere.]"}
{"text":"Like transporting yourself to NYC with it's trendy beats in the background and the contemporary flair.  I love it!  The food is really great, I actually had my first Udon Noodle plate here and although the food was something new to me, it was really good.  The girlfriend and I ordered a Hawaiian roll of some sort prior for an appetizer and it was excellent as well.  You can tell why this place is popular.  It is apparently where all the beautiful people hang out as I've been told.  I would say that this is my new high end sushi choice just edging out Enso by a nose."}
{"text":"Been here twice now, once on a first date and last visit for a birthday dinner. The atmosphere is very nice and festive (esp with the Christmas decor) and the service is top notch.  The first visit was fun, bc the owner came around and did sake bombs with us, singing and tossing her cowboy hat.  This past visit was pretty low-key, but still our server was gracious and attentive.  I had sushi the first time and although very pricey, it was good.  This past visit I ordered the chicken teriyaki dinner...... Not impressive.  I asked for extra broccoli and mushrooms for the stir fried veggies. She said those weren't veggies that were used (cabbage, zucchini and squash were) and I told her that was fine and that I would pay additional for them. (Word to the wise, this cost me $5.00 for some twigs of broccoli and a few shiitake mushrooms) I ordered fried rice ($1extra) and when my meal came it was presented well, but the chicken looked as though it had been sautéed plain in chunks and soy/ponzu/teriyaki sauce was poured over it along with some sesame seeds. Way too salty and not very good. The fried rice and veggies were good.  For what we ordered as a couple (my meal, with all the additions) and three basic sushi rolls, two pieces of nigiri, and a beer it was $72.  Way too much for what we got. When I can eat sushi again, I will head to my fave Rusans. :)"}
{"text":"The food was ok.  The atmosphere was very lively for a younger crowd.  The only real complaint was the snarky little bald guy working the hostess/host stand.  Fortunately the bar and wait staff were better."}
{"text":"Great sushi restaurant on the south end. They have a parking lot if you keep driving to the back but they also Parteners with a valet company. Upon entering I was greeted and seated. I had a reservation. It was crowded and their was some music bumping. They have a DJ! The vibe is fun funky cool setting. The waitress was nice, knowledgeable, and didn't miss a beat. I appreciate that! The food was good I had two sushi rolls, the dragon and the shrimp tempura, and my friend had a meal, steak and shrimp. The lychee martini was nice. I would come back just for this drink and a quick roll at the table top area. The martini was simple and strong. Overall nice spot and good vibe. I'll be back and I think you should try."}
{"text":"Great sushi.  Mid-range price, a little on the expensive side but worth it for the atmosphere and unique sushi choices.    Good for lunch too, quick call-ahead-take-out.  Highly recommended to those who enjoy good Japanese food in a quiet atmosphere.  Even at 12 during the week the place is very accomodating and very good.  The only reason I don't give 5 stars is because Sushi 101 is better!!!"}
{"text":"Wow! Its a dining experience for all senses...sounds goofy,I know...but its good food, with broad spectrum of asian food & sushi represented here...rolls I had were great...I am not super adventerous w/sushi, so go w/that...great drinks, attentive staff...but its def. hoppin in there...make reservations for the weekend, great place to celebrate birthdays...GREAT PEOPLE WATCHING....I could have just sat in the corner & watched all evening ;) Not overly pricey...great locale for Charlotte...this place has been here for years & will be for years to come. Word to the wise, Its super, super loud in there & when staff is busy, they are super busy...so know what you want, & quickly."}
{"text":"Don't ever order a takeout(to-go) from here. They will start making your food when you actually get there to pick up even though you ordered hours in advance.  There are tons of better sushi place in Charlotte. So find somewhere else."}
{"text":"Their decor and atmosphere is amazing. Their kalbi is amazing as well, cooked perfectly. Everything else, was just a bust. Their shrimp tempura roll left a lot to the imagination to be desired. Their calamari, just tasted so much better before hand. I think more people go for the environment rather than the quality of the food. However, there are better restaurants than this, I would definitely choose CUISINE MALAYA sushi anyday. They seem to have a lot more variety but  more importantly, their food just tastes better."}
{"text":"Sushi was wonderful, plenty to choose from. Entrees were creative and fairly well done, however overpriced.  Atmosphere was trendy but the music was so loud that conversation was impossible. As the music would fade or lower you could hear everyone yelling at each other (it was kind of funny actually.) Our server was very nice but slow."}
{"text":"I'm a sushi snob.  I am.  Sushi at a supermarket?  No way.  I've eaten at many high end sushi restaurants, so I fancy myself smarter than the average bear when it comes to sushi.   I dig Nikko.  1) it's hip.  You walk in and it's like you're in NYC.  2) The food is just damn good.    I've been here 3 times now since moving to Charlotte almost 2 months ago.  All three times - just great.    I never get sake, so I can't comment on that.  I got a martini the first time and have gotten Kirin draft every other time.  Yummy.   The fish - I've never had a poor piece of fish there.  It's all very fresh and is well prepared.  Warning - they put a lot of wasabi on their nagiri.  You've been warned.    They have some really inventive rolls.  The crispy salmon roll is really good.  The crazy roll (served in some sort of cocktail glass) is not good.  Avoid at all costs.   All the staff have been very nice, although busy at certain points, so it's a pain if you need another beer.  However - One waiter gave me a great tip about their tuna tartare - they put a raw quail egg on top.  Ask for it without that.   Enjoy - this place is a keeper.  I'll be there pretty often.  *** Update as of 3/8/2008 *** I had their tuna tartare a few days ago.  I would avoid this dish.  It's basically their spicy tuna mixture sans the spicy.  More weird to eat it without a roll..."}
{"text":"I came here for a friends bday dinner and was quite impressed with the mix of a DJ in a Japanese restaurant. I was also impressed with the fact that we had 8pm reservations but the guest of honor didn't arrive until 8:45 and they still held her table ! Other than that, that was the highlight. It was a table of 10 and 2 servers yet they failed to ever be on the same page. One waiter took on side of the tables order, while the other waitress seemed to be no where in sight. Service was extremely slow and the waiters were hard to come around when you needed something as simple as a fork. We had multiple misunderstandings throughout the night which maybe I can attribute to the DJ. Overall the food was pretty good and I would definitely give it another shot with a smaller party."}
{"text":"Way way Way way way too loud to have a conversation with anybody.... Best part about a meal is the people you have with you. This dance floor music is ridiculous... sashimi and the food was very good. Just the ambience was terrible...shoot!"}
{"text":"I am not impressed.  I am from California and love me some sushi.  This place is nothing but smokme and mirrors.  Hence the Great venue, this place has a great venue and decor its a Architech's dream but a food critics nightmare.  The Sushi was WAAAYY OVERPRICED.  I mean come on a tekka roll one of them ost cheapest thing on any sushi menu at any sushi place was 11 dollars.  Something that would cost me $4.95 in my best sushi place in California.  Its soooo  ridiculous.  The 30 waiters that were hanging around the restraunt and the 4 hostesses I dont see how anyone in Charlotte considers this place one of the best sushi places in Charlotte!  I did however find a halfway decent place that kinda worth anything sushi wise in the city of Charlotte and thats Yama Sushi in Southpark area."}
{"text":"Had a great experience here . The cocktails are fantastic . Sushi was good . Service was good ."}
{"text":"Nikko is a Charlotte establishment when it comes to sushi.  With modern design and a sexy layout in lighting even the bathrooms are nice.  You pay for all this \"high profile\" look and feel for this place by the pricing of the sushi, which is very good, but I feel like I'm paying NYC prices in NC????  With DJs playing certain times of the week and Joanna chanting more sake bombs and dancing around with a boa this place is a little of everything.  The wait staff here is always good, but not very engaging.  Parking involves valet or parking in the deck, but the deck is a real pain....I don't like that aspect of this experience.  What is good is I can catch the light rail down there from the center city which is a real plus.  People watching is very good here and the place can get loud.  So for an overall good time while getting your sushi on, this is the place for you............and me."}
{"text":"I order the rainbow roll where ever I go. It's basically a california roll with fish (Salmon, Yellowtail, tuna) drapped over it.  I was so disappointed by what I recieved at nikkos.  Only half the rolls had fish drapped over it and the other half had avacado. This is not a cheap place and I felt shorted that they cheaped out on half my fish.   I have gone to this place for a long time. It's a beautiful restraurant. The service is always great. The food quality is always good. I am so dissappointed that they have started to cut corners."}
{"text":"I think it goes without saying that this place is awesome!  From the trendy atmosphere and art deco on the wall to the cowboy hat wearin', pocket sized owner/manager, this place is wicked fun!  The food is excellent.  Four of us went on friday, GET THERE BEFORE 7:30 on a busy night and you walk in like VIP! After, you'd probably get a vibrating beeper deal and a bar stool!  The waiter was attentive and friendly. The prizes were not cheap, however so be prepared to spend a pretty penny on some raw fish!   We ordered quite a variety, not just the rolls and everything was savory and delicious!  I definitely recommend it to all looking for a sushi extravaganza!"}
{"text":"A friend chose this place for sushi....I met her there with my one year old. I ordered spider roll it was delicious.......but when it got to my table there were 5 pieces....menu says 6-8 pieces. Told server 1 was missing....he said it was cut thick. Well, why would they bring out a smaller amount. Sooo server said he can take it back to cut one to make 6.....just make mine right the FIRST TIME!!  There was nothing on the menu that I could order for my daughter so I asked if I could order a small order of plain noodles. Lol my server said he asked the MANAGER and he said he will only give me a full order of noodles which was waaay too much for a baby to eat and had to charge me the full price. Have you ever heard of accommodating customers? My husband and I have heard about this restaurant and nice atmosphere....when we have our date night we were looking forward to trying it.....after learning that if your situation is different like having a young child and they can't even provide options....we will definitely not be dining there. I had to go to my car and look for crackers and treats for her to eat. Really uncalled for. Server was nice....if u really wanna try it out ask for Justin.....although the manager seems like a jerk...Justin made what I had a little better."}
{"text":"Sat for 15 minutes and no one even offered us water. Three waitresses walked by and didn't say a word. HORRIBLE PLACE. Treat patrons like they're an inconvenience. Spend your hard earned dollars somewhere else! I'll never go again."}
{"text":"BEST sushi in town!!! Very nice restaurant. The staff are all friendly!! Parking deck attached to the place which makes parking no problem at all. I have been to this place during lunch and for dinner. Lunch is a more relaxing atmosphere. At night, especially on the weekends, there is usually a DJ playing music throughout the place. You may want to make reservations for dinner and on the weekends. They also have a patio area to sit outside if the weather permits. Dress code=casual/dressy  Best sushi rolls to try 1. SPICY SHRIMP & CRAB SALAD ROLL and 2. SUPER CRUNCHY ROLL. Also ask for sushi specials!  As far as the other food, it was okay. I've ordered the filet mignon, with fried rice, miso soup, and salad with ginger dressing. The salad and dressing is by far better than Nakatos. The other food I ordered was smaller in portions compared with Nakatos. If you are looking for larger portions and for the cook to prepare food before you, I would try Nakatos. If you would like to order from the menu and GOOD sushi, this is the place for you!!!!"}
{"text":"This place makes me uncomfortable. It feels more like somewhere for martinis and dancing than traditional Japanese food and sushi. The environment is quite clean and fancy but is more along the modern-aggressive feel than restaurant-y and welcoming.  Prices are a bit high for what you're getting (example: a Vegetable Roll cut into 6 pieces is $6. C'mon, to make that is almost 100% profit). The staff were friendly and good about water refills, the valet staff were really nice.  Eh, I don't think I'll be back but it was an experience for sure."}
{"text":"Nikko is definitely the fanciest sushi place in Charlote--and again, it's  not even close. This place is super scene-y--lots of banker types there all done up, lots of make-up'd women in fancy clothes. Seriously, when you go to Nikko you feel like you're in some swanky sushi place in LA or Miami, which is fine if that's what you're in the mood for.   As a result, Nikko is pretty expensive, although you're getting pretty good bang for your buck--most of the sushi is actually really good. Definitely a place to come to be seen, though, which means the bar is super active and crowded, especially on thursdays and the weekend. It really gets a clubby/lounge-like atmosphere on these nights, so don't expect a nice, quiet meal. Far from it. Good sushi bar aspect though--you can sit there easily. Reservations can be tough sometimes, or at least it's not that easy to just show up and sit right away. Definitely popular.  The food takes a backseat to the meal itself, which is what some people there are hoping for. Indeed, good place to have a birthday dinner with friends. Maybe decent date spot. Note the owner, who goes running around making a scene."}
{"text":"My third time visiting Nikki's and I'm definitely a fan of this establishment. Very hip and trendy! Perfect spot for a date night or dinner and drinks with friends. There's also a private area for birthdays and special events. During my first visit, I noticed a DJ in the corner, not sure if this is a weekend thing or not.   Personally I love the sushi! Endless options of unique flavors and combinations. My cousin and I dined here a few weeks ago. She's NEVER tried Sushi before! So this was a first! Everything was perfection!! The service is great, I've never had a bad experience. Parking sucks, so your better off with valet parking.   There's lots of options for non-sushi lovers. I plan to try the Ramen during my next visit. The Cocktails!!! Amazing!! Half off on Thursdays! Be sure to try the Pear Sakitni!! So delish!!"}
{"text":"I like this place. Good atmosphere and good sushi. The reason for 1 star is that it is advertised as gluten free friendly. My sister has celiacs, so to double check we called to make sure. They said yes! We are! When we got there (after ordering a bottle of wine) we were informed that there was not options for her. When we talked to the manager, he got a really big attitude. Bad experience. It's just frustrating that they market as friendly, but have no options. Educate yourselves."}
{"text":"Great date place, especially if you get one of the big, cushy, round booths. The decor is pretty awesome, too. Very contemporary - you can tell a lot of money went into this place.   Best bets would be: crunchy tuna roll (you actually get yummy tuna steak slices, as opposed to mashed tuna salad); and the yellowtail jalapeno sashimi (freshest fish I've tasted, honestly).   For dessert: the chocolate spice cake is TO DIE FOR.  If you get the chance to head to the lady's room -- be not afraid, the frosted windowed stalls turn opaque as soon as you step in!  ALSO: beware (or delight): we were there on Friday night and as we left, there was a DJ setting up. So I guess it turns into one big party Friday night, if that's what you're into!"}
{"text":"A must stop in Charlotte. Amazing energy, wonderful staff, good food. It's a family affair."}
{"text":"Definitely the best sushi experience in Charlotte.  The tuna crunchy roll with the doctor david sauce is a combination of tastes that is unmatched.  Joanna and James continue to deliver great service."}
{"text":"The supposed best ginger dressing in town was very watery. Spicy tuna roll was mostly rice, hardly any tuna. Had the dragonfly and Nikko roll, neither were good. If you name a roll after your restaurant, it better be damn good."}
{"text":"Our server was on a different planet.  The food was just ok.  The sushi bar in the epicenter is way better."}
{"text":"Haven't eaten Japanese in quite some time. I really liked it here. As a vegetarian, I had lots of choices. I had Teriyaki Tofu, Miso Soup, Mango/Cabbage salad, tempura and vegetarian roll. This was a little too much food for 1 person. I would eliminate tofu to make it just right. It got a little noisy, but that's the Nikko scene. I'm glad I took taxi and got there around 7:30 pm. When me and my friend left, it was mobbed by 8:30 pm. All in all - great food, great atmosphere, classy bathrooms."}
{"text":"Nikko and I go way back to the time when the restaurant was located in the much smaller space in the building just north of the current location, which is in the pink high-rise on South Boulevard. At that time owner/sushi chef Joanna was there most of the time and I dined often at the sushi bar for the spicy tuna roll, the \"Trust Me\" roll as well as the \"Super Crunchy Roll\". Since then, Nikko has expanded into its current huge space with a full bar and lounge area. The menu has also expanded to include many traditional Japanese dishes as well as sushi.  I recently had a quick lunch here on my own and enjoyed it. The sushi rolls were good as usual and the salad with ginger dressing is always pleasing. I look forward to returning soon, but I do miss the intimacy of the original location. Still, I'm glad to see Joanna doing so well and it's great to have good sushi in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"We ordered the sushi deluxe and did not like it at all. Too over priced for the quality and portion size... We put all of our marbles on the dessert but that was also a big disappointment. It was the first time I saw my boyfriend not finish chocolate cake.  The only reason why it has two stars is because the music by DJ bicnasti was good and the restaurant is nicely decorated."}
{"text":"My review is mostly for the amazing and genuine service and atmosphere! The servers were very nice, answered all questions asked and brought the drinks and salad out quick. This restaurant is special because, my best friend got engaged here tonight! All of the staff members were excited, brought over champagne, took pics when we asked and had no issue with us screaming loud from excitement. For this I would suggest the restaurant. I am allergic to shell fish so, I order the salmon and mixed vegetable salad. It was 'ok' nothing too special! This is a sushi restaurant so word of advice get the sushi and enjoy"}
{"text":"Nikko, why have I waited until now to try you? I did not realize what I was missing. Walked in Friday at about 7 and they were able to get us right in without a reservation.   The atmosphere was really cool- very busy but it didn't feel overly crowded.The kitchen was open which I always like.   Our service was great and the pacing of the meal was perfect.   We started with an appetizer, the Tuna Tataki which was prepared beautifully. I would have liked a little more ponzu sauce but the flavors were spot on.  Next we had three rolls: The Volcano, Nikko, and Spider . All were fantastic- I would get any again.   A bit pricey but the quality and taste of each roll was outstanding.   I will be back soon!"}
{"text":"We do team events here pretty often too. Unfortunately, Nikko is not able to acccomodate us when the group gets too large.   That aside, ths place has good sushi and at times when I would crave a good sushi meal, I would even hop into the limo to pick-up dinner."}
{"text":"Good food, tons of fun on the weekend with the live dj and larger-than-life owner. Had a problem with our bill and she was extremely accommodating. Will absolutely be back for the experience alone."}
{"text":"Finally! A visit that ended well. I've been trying to have a pleasant experience at Nikko for approximately 4 yrs.  I remember when the restaurant was small and quaint, located in Uptown. Service was so much better then. Once it grew, service began to fall. I've made reservations that were not honored. Saturdays... the music is entirely too loud to enjoy each other at the table. Waiting time has been horrific. It seems, on the weekends, operationally.. there needs to be some tweeking to make sure the patrons have an excellent experience. I've said all of this to say...go on a WEEKDAY! You will have your server's undivided attention. Food will arrive in an expedited fashion. There are parking spaces available. The music is at the right volume. You're not waiting 20 mins for valet. I really enjoyed myself this trip."}
{"text":"Made a reservation for 9:30pm and had to wait well over 45 minutes to be seated. No coffee. .no variations of tea... drinks were watered down... Deluxe Sushi plate was very blah!  No imagination whatsoever!  I'm VERY disappointed in this place especially since I am a patron who ventured in when the restaurant first established itself in the uptown area. The only highlights were the owner dancing and our server who was VERY attentive!  By the way,  this is the second time I've had to wait past the time my reservation was set for. The first time I was told although I had a reservation,  it was a 2 hr wait.  My party and I went to Fusion in Dilworth instead who were mindful of their patrons."}
{"text":"We came here with another couple for dinner. I've heard about this place and have always wanted to try it out. We did valet for parking. We got sat right away. Our server was friendly and helpful. The shrimp shumai was good and cooked well. I got a roll of sushi and it was fresh. My only 2 complaints is that I asked if they had chili oil and they said they did and when I received it I got sesame oil and I went to the bathroom and I saw a worker there who used the bathroom and she didn't really wash her hands. She turned the water on and put her hands underneath and didn't even use soap! Gross."}
{"text":"I love sushi.  I think this is a great modern restaurant in a hip and up and coming area of the city.  For starters I stopped by the bar to wait for the rest of my party.  I had the cucumber crisp martini and it was so good.  The bartender cautioned that it was mostly vodka with some muddled cucumbers and a little simple syrup, so that makes it not too sweet.  It was so refreshing and a great start.  The bartender was also fabulous and had I not been meeting a big party, I would have dined with him at the bar top.    When our party all arrived we were seated and ordered a variety of apps.  The calamari and beef tataki were my favorites.  The calamari is flash fried with sauce drizzled on the top.  It has a touch of spice to it and heat on the back end, which I loved.  The beef tataki was seared perfect, but it did have some cajun type spices on the outside which I wasn't crazy over.  But the sliced cucumbers on the plate with it were amazing.  They were drenched in ponzu sauce and if I had been at home I would have licked that plate!  For the main course I chose the Christmas roll (topped with shrimp and avacado) and also a few pieces of nigiri.  Overall the food and service was great.  Everything is decently priced and in keeping with other sushi restaurants in the city.  The atmosphere is great and we went on a Sunday, which wasn't too crowded.  But during weekend nights I can see it getting quite crowded.  Overall a great place for food and drinks!"}
{"text":"Being from Los Angeles I'm pretty spoiled by the great selection of sushi. In my search to find a decent sushi restaurant in Charlotte, I came across Nikko's.  The environment is very plush and swanky. The service has always been courteous and attentive on my visits.  The sushi is a 3/5 for me .... It's the best that I have been able to find in Charlotte, although I don't know if that's saying much. The prices were a bit higher than I would have liked to pay but  the atmosphere balances it out."}
{"text":"I've been a fan of Nikko for years but after the last two or three visits, I have to update my review, one star down.  The Good: Service is still solid albeit quiet and the sushi menu is creative and tasty. There's a item for everyone and if you seek some interesting rolls, you can likely find them on the menu. Plus, the place is conducive to large groups ready for sake-bombing. Don't forget the complimentary valet!  The Bad: The prices were already a bit high for the market but over the past few months, Nikko raised the price of many of its rolls and specials. While the increase was only a dollar or two each, that certainly adds up on the final bill.   While the price increase is a bit irritating, it's even more so due to the fact that the rolls are significantly smaller and not as fresh. Sad panda. I was also pretty disenchanted by the soy sauce splattered menus and funky scent coming from one particular booth. No, it wasn't us. We showered.  Nikko is still a fair place to check out, but for me the quality has gone down as of late."}
{"text":"Great sushi and Japanese food! I love the lively/energetic atmosphere and they have a DJ on the weekends. It's a great place to have a birthday dinner!"}
{"text":"Let's cut to the chase.  Parking deck close by and valet option- Yay.  Nigiri is meant to be eaten with your hands. Of course I washed mine before the food came, but no towels at the table? Unheard of.  It's a bit pricey. It is a little loud (we were there on a weeknight- I was told weekends are very very loud). Service was 2 stars. It was a week night, not busy, but our server was not paying attention enough that we needed to remind her she did not bring everything we ordered. Yet, 3 stars is totally warranted if only because the sashimi was so fresh and delicious. (The roll we ordered was some Americanized concoction so I won't hold it against the restaurant.) I'll come back for the sashimi any day."}
{"text":"I don't think I'll be coming to Nikko again.  If you are looking for fresh sushi at a good price, this is not the place to attend.  The prices have definitely been up since the last time I came through a few months.  Understandable in that they have overhead costs and a declining customer base, but the way to remedy that is not by having poorer quality fish and questionable service.    Came here late on a Friday night because a friend from California was in town and from what I recalled of this place, it was a nice hotspot at nights--lots of music and girls.  This time the music was blaring and there were a handful of co-eds.  The music bumping was a complete disconnect from the dining experience.  If the bar is packed and party people abound, it would make sense; however that was not the case.  Sushi was generally overpriced and the portions were definitely smaller.  I've been to plenty of sushi spots in my lifetime to know what is solid--this place, not so much.  Service was fine.  The guy was attentive and stuff like that...but I don't know about you, but hate it, hate it, hate it, when they try to upsell you and it's too obvious.   Upsell being a way for the server to get your bill as high as possible so they get a bigger tip.  We had plenty of beer, but he kept asking if we wanted more beer, perhaps more rolls, perhaps hot sake, I thought he was pretty much going to try to push anything so that his tip would be bigger.  When the server reeks of desperation upsell, it brings the dining experience down since his focal point is no longer customer enjoyment, rather it is how much cash-money he can put in his pocket.    I'm a sucker for pretty girls...maybe I come here again.  This time there was only one cutie at the bar...Place is pretty dead on a Friday night, hoping its better during the week? ;/  dmo out"}
{"text":"I have eaten at Nikko's for many years and it is by far one of the best Sushi Restaurants in Charlotte NC.  It has modern decor with a pleasant atmosphere during the day and in the evening it is more energetic and fun. The owner is super sweet and always makes rounds to the tables to great guests."}
{"text":"I've been to Nikko a number of times in the past, and I always enjoyed what they had to offer.  The restaurant itself is super-stylish and spacious...with a great bar as well.  I also appreciated their extensive menu, with a great variety of sushi and maki rolls...not to mention a full rundown of Japanese specialties, like ramen, udon, teriyaki dishes and bento boxes.  And did I mention that they have great desserts, like the most delightful dish of fried ice cream with whipped cream?  Basically, this restaurant got it all covered.  If you come late at night, it lights up with music...and is an ideal place for a group outing.  You may even catch its owner with her cowboy hat dancing and prancing throughout the restaurant (Yep, this restaurant most definitely has character).  I've also been to the restaurant for lunch, and they offer great discounted specials!  It's much quieter during lunch hours as well.  Service has also been fairly good...no problems as of yet.  There's so much on their menu that I'm looking to try out, can't wait to revisit soon!"}
{"text":"Loved the food at this place. Very nice ambiance the server was nice and promp...drinks were nice and strong!!!"}
{"text":"The Nikko's uptown location is far suppior to this Ballantye local.  The atmosphere is so different, the uptown location is fronted by fun Joanna, and this one is on the plain side. However, they do have outdoor seating.  The food is delicious, as usual, but if you don't want to go to the city don't expect a fun substitute."}
{"text":"I am updating my review to 5stars bc the taste and flavor packed in the sushi at Nikkos is 100% delicious.  I loved my Hawaiian poke roll , the best roll I've had in a long time in Charlotte,  the tuna was perfectly marinated and plentiful. I could've licked my plate after eating this roll. Also, my spicy salmon roll was the right balance of savory and spice . The rolls here are hearty, combined with the right ingredients to give your tastebuds a heavenly sushi experience."}
{"text":"Went here on Friday the 28 for business lunch, the greeter didn't greet us , maybe because we were dressed casually , but our offices won't be hosting meetings or events here. They weren't busy but obviously under staff, took 15 minutes just to order anything . I ordered an Asian salad originally but it was the worse salad I've tasted it had no flavor, and loads of raw cabbage with chicken that was supposed to be marinated in sake? Tasted like processed deli lunch meat. Reordered the teriyaki chicken and it was dry and flavorless as well. Coworker ordered chicken curry katsu, salt overload. And another ordered Korean style ribs . That was good we all shared it being that own meals were unsatisfying. Too many other good sushi spots to pay the outrageous prices here. Go elsewhere. Poor service and poor food. Maybe their sushi is better. I didn't want to wait another 40minutes to get a roll."}
{"text":"My favorite sushi place in the city! So many choices, fresh fish, great service and awesome vibe!"}
{"text":"I really like this place a lot. A group of us had dinner here to celebrate a friend's birthday and we had a blast. They have a DJ on Friday nights so the place is really live. The space is open and the decor is nice. They accommodated our large party along with other very large parties there that night with no problem. They came out and sang for my friend whose birthday it was and the owner came over and fed him cake lol. The staff was friendly and we had a really good time. Now on to the food... it was great! I ordered the mussels as an appetizer and then had the chicken and shrimp entree for dinner. I really loved the food and so did everyone else. This is a fun place to meet with friends for dinner or drinks."}
{"text":"Sushi is decent but over priced. The lady with the tambourine can get kind of annoying..."}
{"text":"One of the best parts about Nikko is you never have to wait for a table! Huge seating area and a great ambiance. I never understand why it's not more crowded. Completely valet but it's also connected to a parking garage. I tried the Fox roll and had no complaints. Definitely not the best sushi I've had but it's still really good. A solid choice for sushi in South End."}
{"text":"Not really a sushi person so my gf and I came for some teriyaki chicken seeing it was the closet place in the area. This place is beautiful and big. Parking is frustrating. The chicken wasn't cooked all the way through and they did not have sweet carrots very disappointing."}
{"text":"After my first sushi experience in Charlotte (it didn't even deserve the one star), I was completely deflated. So a friend took me to Nikko, one of her favorite places.  For a $30 bento box, I expected quality. Service was great, and Nikko was entertainingly wild. Everything in my box tasted to par. My Charlotte sushi experience was looking on the up!  So why 2 stars?   Well, I didn't think much of it when I was eating my nigiri, but the slices of fish were warmer than preferred. I attributed the rise in temperature to the other things that were cooked in my box since the fish had great texture and I could tell that it was fresh...  I would say that I digest faster than the average person. By the time I was about to pay my bill, everything I ate that night exited my body. Not pleasant at all. The causation? Either something dirty, or I speculate, that warm fish - I guess it was sitting out longer than necessary. Regardless of the cause, something was not right about that dinner.  I give it one more star than my last experience because of the nice atmosphere and service, but at least the sushi from that experience stayed in my tummy."}
{"text":"Best sushi restaurant in Charlotte. Quality is great and prices are reasonable. I really respect the owner for always being present and love that she will take on any task necessary (seated us rather than making the hostess do it). The complementary valet also makes this a better choice than the uptown options."}
{"text":"Its really fresh, great atmosphere and good service.  And if your going to a game, great stop right off the light rail.  Prices are way better than cowfish and sushi is just as good."}
{"text":"I love Sushi.  And I can honestly say i think i found my new sushi place. The atmosphere was FANTASTIC, however, like one of the previous reviews stated, music was too loud for a Friday at 9 pm! It did feel a little like we were in Vegas or Miami.  The DJ was pretty good and I enjoyed the music.  This place really captured the essence of Charlotte and the direction Charlotte is headed.  We saw trendy and chic people who were from all different backgrounds.  Prices were on point, drinks were a tad pricey, service was pretty good, parking was free and sushi was phenomenal."}
{"text":"Amazing sushi! The Nikko Roll tastes sublime and has gorgeous presentation. Incredible service. Worthy of the upscale prices."}
{"text":"I quite enjoyed Nikko's very much.  They had pretty swag furniture in there.  I should've made a reservation before going because I waited a long time to get a table, but I liked how they had a very nice area for people waiting.  Pretty good feel in the restaurant, the only bad thing is I went during a dj night and it was SUPER loud.  I'm not a fan of having to speak loudly while eating.  I think that was the only downside.  Now to the good stuff.  The food was absolutely AMAZING!!!  I had ordered so much sushi that I can't even remember what all I ordered.  The only thing I can remember was that it was heaven in my mouth.  I could feel the angels just flying in there gracing me with goodness in there.  My favorite thing off the menu was the Kalbi appetizer.  It was so delicous that I was tempted to order more, but the sushi came out before I did and it was plentiful enough.  I would recommend this place, but just beware of the dj techno night because it was a tad bit too loud."}
{"text":"Ok, so I'm going to lay it out on the line for you. I've been to this place twice.   I visited the first time when I was in town to see my best friend. I lived in San Francisco at the time. For starters, the place looks amazing! It is very nice and left a nice impression on me for Charlotte. The pros: The sushi is ok, but not spectacular. It lacked on presentation for such a nicely decorated place and for the prices. We are paying for the experience, right? I can get the same thing from any fast food sushi place in the city (SF). Still, the atmosphere is pretty chic, and I was enjoying time with m y best friend... then it happened. I started to notice the paintings/ pictures all over the place: of the owner... ok, so a bit vane... then it happened! She grabbed a mic and started singing karaoke in the middle of the bar, trying to get the people to clap. People were going along with it too. I was like \"wtf\" is going on! Is this a circus? Am I about to see people swinging from the ceiling? No. She sang one poorly sung song and that was it. It was completely out of place. One word: major vanity.   Visit 2: The food was the same. We ordered sashimi and got nigiri: not a big deal, just leave the rice off.  The bill was way too high for 2 people. It was over $100 pre tip. This is way more than any sushi I have paid for in Northern California.   So my rating system for this one? One star b/c that's mandatory, one star for the ambience, one star because I'd probably go back simply for the atmosphere... and as long as I'm not sung to karaoke style."}
{"text":"I would give this place a 3.5. Nikko's is good but a bit overrated. Probably bc Charlotte doesn't have extensive options when it comes to Japanese restaurants. But the food is good, so I return for that reason. And the drinks were strong so that's a plus. They are a tad bit overpriced for the food but again that's because they can be. Nice ambiance and good for groups. Also have tv's so you can watch sporting events while there."}
{"text":"I went to Nikko this past weekend for a friend's birthday, after maybe three or four years since my last visit. We had reservations at 8:30 and were seated once our whole party arrived.  One we were seated the owner greeted us with a little singing and dancing, and a toast (even though we only had water at this time) to the birthday girl! It was great to see the owner has not lost her touch, still in her cowboy hat walking around, dancing and having fun with her customers.  After ordering our drinks, we started with a variety of appetizers, gyoza, dumplings, calamari, and some others that everyone seemed to enjoy.  As for entrees, everyone ordered a variety of sushi rolls and I got some the tuna roll and nigiri, which was a generous portion and very fresh fish.  I will say the rolls came in 6 pieces where typically you receive 8.  However, I was still full from what I ordered. The drinks were great and the service was on point, filling waters and cocktails and addressing any needs we needed.  We had a party of 10 and all were splitting our bills, yes, we were that group.  However, there were no issues  with the waiter and everyone's bills were on point. Overall, I was happy to see things haven't changed at Nikko and love the atmosphere, music and overall environment especially for a get together like a birthday or fun night out."}
{"text":"Food is good.  Service is absolutely terrible.  They care more about making it a club scene than focusing on good service."}
{"text":"My wife took me to Nikko a couple of years ago really nice atmosphere great sushi with good service. We  haven't went back so it's a little difficult to assess how good Nikko is. We plan to take another trip."}
{"text":"The food was amazing! The filet mignon and sushi was tasteful as well as their wide selection of sake."}
{"text":"Nikkos!   I really enjoyed this place on my first visit! The atmosphere is neat, and the owner is a ball of fun.  I started the night off with a cucumber martini, it was strong but good. Then a friend and I ordered some rolls. I got the Dragon Roll, and TNT roll. So yummy, I enjoyed my rolls very much and even had to sneak a grab of my friends!  Later we shared the ORIGINAL XANGOS CHEESECAKE (Rich, smooth cheesecake with a slightly tangy finish rolled in a melt-in-your-mouth, flaky pastry tortilla. Served with a side of ginger ice cream.)  Um, yum! I really enjoyed this dessert.  I will be back at Nikkos soon!  Check them out! http://www.nikkosushibar.net/"}
{"text":"Stopped by during their quiet hours of Sunday late evening to take advantage of their discounted appetizer.  $6 for the discounted shrimp tempura and they are decent. Fresh, good service even though I was waiting in the front.  Asked a ton of questions and they don't seem to be annoyed with me.  Though the staff do gather at the end in the front and talk.   I watched golf in the flat screen TV in the bar while waiting for my to-go orders to come out.  The Lobster roll and calamari (which comes with a large plate of veggies underneath).  The Lobster roll was $25 (not too pricey in my book) and they are really tasty.  I spent the whole night, almost to consume the entire plate.  I will definitely be back and I am looking to meet the owner some time. Her photos are everywhere in kimono and they looked really nice.  I heard she has an unique character which makes their dishes even more interesting.   The immediate surrounding is not far from I-277 N and it is quiet with mostly residential grounds and not much other businesses to distract you from your quiet enjoyment of the outside scenery --which is mostly fast driving vehicle going by on a busy surface street.   Will definitely be back and hopefully this time is with a group in the back for a more comfortable dining experience."}
{"text":"This place moved so be careful when your routing here. A nice modern, upscale Japanese restaurant that is located near the city. You can tell this place is popular at night due to its location and stylish bar. Our waiter was nice and friendly and the seating was very spacious. The food they serve here ranges from traditional Japanese food to modern surf and turf rolls. We ared the Chirachi, calamari, cowboy roll and a California roll. Upon first glance the price may seem a bit on the pricer end. However when the food arrived we noticed they give you a lot for your money. The rolls were not small and you could tell the quality of ingredients used were fresh. The caliamari had a nice sweet and salty aioli sauce.  The chirachi had big cuts of sashimi. The california roll was fresh. The cowboy roll which I strongly recommend for $18 is a friend shrimp tempera roll topped off with thin slices of sashimi fish and smoked beef. Though Im usually not a fan of surf and turf, I have to say this roll worked out extremely well as it was well balanced. Overall this a nice place to go to anytime. What would make this place better is a better lunch special. If you come here and your not too hungry perhaps just get a drink and the cowboy roll. I promise you its very satifying. CHeers!"}
{"text":"Really nice modern looking place with a magical atmosphere and amazing food. perfect for social gathering and late dinner as well.  the service was excellent and not to mention the sushi. definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"The only reason why I am giving this establishment one star is because the system wont allow me to give 0 stars. I will never patronize this restaurant again. A group of maybe 15 of us went out to celebrate a friend's birthday. Our food was cold. At the end of the night, two of the people in my party were accused of receiving an entree without paying for it. The manager was extremely rude. He stated that he would to look at the security camera to see if they had in fact ordered another entree. The fact was, they never ordered 2 entrees. It was only 1. I am aware of this because I sat directly across from them and observed exactly what they had received. Again, they only received 1 entree. The manager on duty never apologized and proceeded to become belligerent with us. Needless to say, I will not be patronizing this restaurant anymore and I encourage you to do the same. I would prefer to patronize establishments that actually care about its customers. This one, does not!"}
{"text":"I liked the vibe in this place. Very nice decor and a very friendly staff.   Now to the Sushi. I focused the wide variety of rolls and had no problem finding a couple of winners such as the Rainbow Roll, Salmon Crunchy Roll and Spider Roll. I also branched out to try the Cowboy Roll with Kobe Beef. It just did not mix well with Sushi. Pass on that one.  Overall a great dining experience. I highly recommend Nikko."}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place because it's in my backyard, but I have been here multiple times and never left feeling like it was a great experience.  Food, drink, and service is average...but the prices are above average...so they have that going for them I guess.  Around 8PM they turn on deafening club music on the weekend, so you may leave here feeling like you have tinnitus."}
{"text":"Underwhelming. Disappointing. Overpriced. Overrated.  Parking: Valet only or blocks away - every parking area/structure near the entrance is private parking.  Wait time: none, which was nice. But we had to ask for everything. For small plates, for the little soy sauce bowls, for water.... everything. Nothing was really anticipated of our needs.  Drinks: ordered 2 martinis - one gin & one vodka - we got 2 gin martinis. sent it back and received a smaller vodka portion than the gin martini which had been 3-4sips in  We didn't find one thing on the \"specials menu\" that sounded appetizing (mango was in more than half the dishes)... and even the basics for sushi did not seem all to great.  SUSHI: Edamame - delicious  Dragonfly roll (spicy tuna, crab/avocado & asparagus flaw fried & plated with spicy teriyaki sauce) and didn't find any tuna in any part of the roll  Godzilla roll (California Roll topped with Spicy Tuna & tempura chips) the spicy tuna on top was more like a minced tuna paste as if it was the soup part of the bottom of the bowl the was scrapped together.. very little tuna, way more paste/sauce  Best Tip about this place: meh... no wait time? it was a Saturday night at 7pm and only half the place was filled."}
{"text":"I'm trying to think of something negative to write about Nikko, but I just can't seem to spit it out. Everything that Murphy defined, can go wrong and has gone wrong here at Nikko. But I can easily forget, look right past it and drink my Asahi. Its like a love/hate relationship.   The allure of the restaurant is backed by modern design, mezmorizing lighting (blue or green backdrop behind the sushi bar) and not to mention exquisite bathrooms. They offer nice touches such as this gritty hand soap \"that also massages your hands, without dehydrating them, leaving a hint of oil.\" Sushi is normally a premium, but prices are especially high here. They offer many signature \"hollywood glam\" rolls, that can be especially pricey and not fulfilling. They might have the most expensive plain run of the mill tuna rolls ($7) and spicy tuna rolls ($7.50) I've ever had too.   Nikko has a weekend DJ and is aways, always crowded. If you have reservations for a large group, its very likely you'll wait. Annnnd you really can't get mad at the restaurant for that! People like to hang out here. People don't just dine here, they converse, they socialize. Once you get seated, you'll understand...   The wait staff here is always excellent and accommodating (they can and will hide any birthday cakes or gifts). Food service might be slow, but there's plenty of eye candy to occupy your time. That's cause Nikko probably brings in the most attractive crowd in the city. Patrons are always friendly and from my experience, everyone always leaves here smiling (maybe its the saki bombs or the vivacious cowboy hat wearing, tambourine toting owner lady, dunno).   Nikko is pretty darn awesome. I've eaten here several times for dinner and for birthday celebrations and I can't say that I've ever had a bad experience. My weekend meal wasn't the best, but I easily got over it. The Miso soup was too fishy.. It had way too much bonito fish flavor. My Ozmakase was just okay at $35 (website is out of date and says $30). The Unagi (my fav) was a lil disappointing than previously and real fishy. But its not the sushi, or teriyaki or udon here  - cause none of that is spectacular; it's the overall dining experience.  If you're looking for a quiet, traditional, or romantic spot, this def isn't the place. If you want to partake in some people watching, pre-partying or have a fun filled dinner celebration/party, definitely check out Nikko."}
{"text":"I decided to go after the hotel desk attendant recommended it as a good sushi spot.  He told us to look for the pink building which made it easy to find.  At first, it seemed like a pretty trendy spot and I was even worried I might be underdressed.  They have free valet parking, but I opted to self park in the garage for free instead.    My friend and I were pretty hungry so we decided to go crazy.  We went with the vegetable tempura and the kalbi.  The tempura was pretty good and the kalbi was delicious but very thin.  It also came with some spicy pickled cucumbers.  Yum.  We decided to go for 4 rolls.  Their bento box and rice bowls are all $25.  It must be pretty amazing stuff, but we didn't want to try that, so we went for the Nikko roll, the Charlotte Roll, the Sexy Salmon, and the caterpillar.  I have to highly recommend the Nikko roll, it was great.  And the sexy salmon was very tasty, with big cuts of salmon and also had a nice kick to it.    I didn't think the prices were too bad."}
{"text":"The ambiance is really nice. I could definitely see myself coming again. We are off the lunch menu and everything was really good and fresh. Service was very attentive. Prices were also very good. It was my first time here and I will certainly be back. My only criticism is they put way too much dressing on their house salad. It almost turns into soup. But the dressing itself is really good."}
{"text":"I'll give this place a solid 4 since it's got great location, atmosphere, food, and a following that keeps me coming back.  When they first moved across the way from their original location, it seemed like it was hard to get in the place since it was so popular - probably why they had to expand.  My group would even schedule going to dinner super early just to avoid the crowds (or try to avoid them).  Once you manage to grab a table, the sushi is good and the wait staff is nice.  Probably one of my favorite spots in Charlotte when my stomach is yelling for sushi!"}
{"text":"This place recently received a score of 87 from the health dept and before that it scored a 90.  They have been re-inspected since and scored much higher but geez a 90 and an 87 - and we're talking about a SUSHI restaurant!!!  I'll never try this place - Beware!!!

{"text":"Unbelievably slow lunch service! We work nearby and have tried it several times over the last two years. Lunch is not busy and the service is SOOO SLOW!! Got here at 11:45, sitting here at 12:45 with no food and no waiter. Hostess finally came to check on us. Food is always good but stay away unless you have a 2 hour lunch!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me here for a date night on a Friday around 8:30pm. From the outside, Nikko's looks like a semi-upscale restaurant. When you get inside, it's like a club that got confused with a restaurant. The music was loud and overbearing for a date. We joked that a first date here would be awful, you literally have to yell across the table.  We got the vegetable tempura, house salad, the VIP roll, and the Sushi Love roll. Our first mistake was not paying attention to the ingredients, both rolls have avocado. The rolls were mushy and the fish was not fresh. My boyfriend almost spit his out, I had to beg him not too. He went to the bathroom and almost threw up. We left with stomach aches.  We always give restaurants a second chance, so we'll try to come on a slower night. Oh and I asked for a captain and Coke, they gave me crown royal. Smh."}
{"text":"Really loved this place! It's basically a night club and sushi restaurant in one. We came here for a birthday party- 18 people. And the service was great. No delays and no lag. Didn't mess up our orders or checks. The sushi was great. Huge (overwhelming) menu with a large variety of food for everyone- even the non-sushi lovers. Although the sushi was great and good quality, the sizes of the rolls were small and expensive. Wouldn't giving this place a try again some other time."}
{"text":"Sort of reminds me of Ra Sushi  I had a few of their rolls and some sashimi which is very tasty and their portions are generous.  I love that the owner walks around and introduces herself if she hasn't seen you before (at least that was the experience that I had).  I also enjoyed the waitress that was very knowledgeable in the dishes that were served."}
{"text":"Excellent Korean Kalbi.  Fast, courteous service.  Good atmosphere. Seems popular."}
{"text":"I can see why this place gets jumping on the weekend. It looks like a cool lounge that just happens to serve sushi. You half expect a dance floor to be tucked away somewhere. I didn't get to experience the thumping music since I came in on a weekday, early evening. There were lots of seats since most of the patrons chose to sit at the bar.  The drinks are very strong, which is always a plus. My date and I ordered calamari, 3 different sushi rolls and seafood fried rice. I wish the rice didn't have imitation crab, but besides that it was filling and delicious.  It's the second best fried rice I've had after Ru San's. The calamari was great, lightly fried- which is a welcome change from some restaurants who serve calamari with more bread coating than squid.  The price is a little higher than normal, but that's expected due to the area. I ate at a sushi place in Steele Creek last week and the price difference wasn't that much between the two. I look forward to returning."}
