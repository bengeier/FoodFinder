{"text":"Food was good as usual, I liked that they have alcohol available at this location.  Service was a bit too attentive, but wasn't really a nuisance"}
{"text":"Lots of food for a good price and fantastic service  (super fast). Amazing chips and salsa."}
{"text":"This was the first time I have been to this location (by Black Dog - champaign). It seems to be fairly bland (undecorated) because they have just moved in. But, the food was the reason I came here, so that is what I will comment on. I have been to Maize many times in the other location (1st and green), the menu here seems to be the same.   I decided to try something new. I forgot the name of the item, but if you refer to my picture, it is basically a sandwich that is sitting in a plate of soup. It tastes exactly how it looked, a soggy sandwich in spicy soup. The sandwich itself was simple and fresh (onions, carnitas, cilantro, cheese, beans). The soup however, was strong in flavor, spicy and salty. The pair just did not go well together. My sandwich was all soggy on the bottom and dry on the top. The spiciness of the soup overtook the flavor of the sandwich.   Although my soup-sandwich was something to avoid, Maize offers many different types of foods that are delightful. I would recommend the burritos or gorditas! Maize's small but delicious menu is a university student favorite place for quick bite."}
{"text":"-Food is 5 star (the pastor tacos were amazing!) -Service was a 2 star (wasn't even rush hour and extremely slow; many wrong orders within our party; forgot to bring things) -Drinks were a 1 star (not tasty, limited choice, and REALLY expensive for what you got). Overall, go for the food but expect to wait!"}
{"text":"This place has ruined other Mexican places for me. The gorditas are awesome!  And their cheese \"dip\" is ridiculously good!"}
{"text":"This place is yummy!  Don't expect your average Mexican restaurant experience. This is much more authentic. It did not disappoint."}
{"text":"Th best tacos in town. Their location downtown is much better than their prior campus town location as they can seat many more and you don't feel rushed. My son and I had three tacos each. Mine veggie: rice beans avocado lettuce and tomato on fresh flour tortillas. My sons were carne asada (steak) americanos with lettuce tomatoes and cheese. He LOVED the steak in them. He also loves their fresh fried flour tortillla chips and salsas. One hot one not. The hot salsa is thick, Smokey, and great on my veggie tacos. The milder one is lighter, more juicy tomato based. Also good on the tacos. Service is fast, friendly, and helpful."}
{"text":"Finally! The much-anticipated new location is open. Although there's nothing wrong with the original location, it's oftentimes pretty packed and can be tricky to find seating. That is definitely not an issue with the new location though.  The new location is nestled in downtown Champaign just off the main drag. It has ample seating and a full bar, something the old location did not have. Their watermelon margarita seems to be one of their staples already and was delicious. They also have (at least when I went) a mexican style beer on draft that Triptych made for them and it was incredibly well done.  The food menu seems to be the same as the old location, which I'm perfectly okay with. You still get your standard chips and salsa and it's just as good as the original location's. Everything we had was amazing, the food was so, so good. They do an outstanding job with everything that they do.  I can't say enough good things about Maize, both new and old locations, but this new one brings some much needed elements with the increase in seating and full bar. I can't recommend this place enough."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food I've had. Great environment as well. Love the steak tostadas as well as the steak burrito."}
{"text":"The food is just as amazing as at its old location, but just more of a restaurant feel! I no longer feel rushed ordering because it is now a sit down. Complimentary chips and salsas are provided and my favorite are the tacos. They freshly hand make the tortillas daily and are a must try!"}
{"text":"I've never had a bad meal here. The fish taco is my favorite, but everything I've tried has been so fresh and tasty. Prices are very reasonable, too. Service seems a bit slow, though, and they have a weird thing about how they can only do 6 separate checks maximum."}
{"text":"Nope.  Chips were so hard I thought I might break a tooth. Both salsas were bland, although one was nicely spicy.  I ordered a veggie tostada (no cheese, no sour cream). I liked how it was made with rice and beans. The rice was actually quite good, but the beans lacked character. I added onions and guac to the tostada and I think that was the key to deciding to eat the whole thing. Unless you really screw the pooch, it's hard to f-*! up guac.  Here's my main sticking point: $8 margarita that's barely big enough to hold a shot of booze, and does not do the job for a buzz.   Maybe our server was having a bad personal day. That happens to all of us. She certainly did not seem enthused to be where she was.  And here's something that's just weird - this doesn't affect my review, I just have to mention it because I found it so odd.  When we walked in there were maybe 3 other tables occupied in the whole joint, but the host decided to sit us right next to the only couple in the middle of the room. It was like being pressured into an unwanted blind date. Weird.  I understand why some folks might like this place: it's got a great location, you can get a quick snack if you're not into a meal, and the food is indeed good enough to eat if you're there.  Bottom line: I see a modern mexi-merican fusion that's trying really hard to be hip but in the meantime they're missing the point with their flavors and drink prices."}
{"text":"Excellent food.  Our waiter explained menu items very well.  I got the carne Asada taco and it was so nice and flavorful. I especially loved how the meat was chopped up so you can eat it politely, not like other places where the meat is tough and cut in strips that you can't even tear with your teeth.  I also tried another item I couldn't pronounce. It was delicious.  My sister ordered the torts and she ate it in its entirety.  I did get a bite and the bread was fabulous.  We also ordered guacamole. Came out ice cold and fresh.  Loved it!  Definitely going back when I can imbibe and pair with my meal."}
{"text":"Wanted to like it so much. Have waited years to try it. I got close several times at the other location.  But saw the cramped seating situation and 40 min drive from home so take out was not good option. Finally, more seating area more parking. Well, made trip around block several times to find parking in rear. Diner with my adult daughter and son. Walked through the restaurant to the front to find  the hostess station abandoned for at least 15 min. Evidently college kids show up in large groups without calling ahead. Staff issues as well ? Bartender running the show? I had the drunken torta  pastor very good balance of heat and seasoning went down fast. However, the star of the show was the guacamole,. It was fresh balanced and delicious! Also had the ribeye taco, not a big fan of that. I will definitely give them a second try for the guacamole alone."}
{"text":"Amazing chips and guac, and fajitas. Underwhelming enchiladas, but the  beef fajitas were so delicious that I would definitely recommend this restaurant to people. I personally preferred this location to the original one."}
{"text":"Got the veggie flutas here. They were okay. The refried beans were super salty. The rice didn't taste fresh. The food was mediocre.  The service was okay."}
{"text":"Their steak tacos are to die for. The salsa is just as good. This was my first visit but certainly will not be my last!"}
{"text":"Yummy margaritas, great pastor  tacos.  Daughter and I sat at the bar to have a snack and a drink.  The bartender was very friendly and informative as to the menu options.    Chips were too thick for my taste but were sturdy and appears they would not break when scooping guac.   Cool place, I love the location."}
{"text":"Tried this for the first time today. I've never gotten a chance to visit the original location so I have no comparison but after dining here I can see why that location always seems to be full. I tried the burrito, guac and tacos and all tasted great. The place is new which is why it was really full and there was an approx 20 min wait for us to be seated. The staff also seemed a bit overwhelmed but the service was fine. There were also a lot of people picking up their to-go orders. Also the fact that they have their own parking in the back is remarkable."}
{"text":"They finally migrated over and opened an actual diner to serve their famous authentic Mexican dishes. Food is the same as the original location, in other words, out of this world. I personally prefer their sopes or huaraches, but their tortas are also incredible. The decor and service is definitely still a work in progress but their food more than makes up for it. Having it located downtown is just an extra treat."}
{"text":"The food was good but not enough fish on my taco and the salsa was not the same as green st. The waitress was horrible, she was slow and didn't check on us. We had to hunt her down to get more salsa. The food was not as big as the green st location. We will not be coming back to this location, we will stick with green st.  The watermelon margarita was good but not big enough."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick lunch while driving through town. I was hoping to get some work done before my steak burrito came out, but they were so quick I wasn't able to (a good problem to have I guess). The chips  and salsa were very good. I enjoyed having a thicker chip than most Mexican restaurants. Will definitely have to make a stop when passing through again."}
{"text":"We had a great meal! The main course was excellent. Our server recommended her favorites and everything was delicious. However, we had a couple of issues and wouldn't come back with kids.    1- Strict policy about waiting until the whole party is present before anyone can be seated.  Even on a Tuesday night. When more than half of the tables were empty.  And person waiting has a toddler and a hungry ten year old.  And there are no seats in a waiting area.  I felt that the hostess should have made a judgement call here but didn't. In fact, she had a slightly condescending attitude and we didn't feel welcomed.   2- Dining room had mostly folding chairs.  Three of the six of us at our table had trouble with chairs folding in on them when trying to scoot closer to the table.  I got up and switched my 4 year old's chair with a sturdy one from another table and we were fine after that.  3- No milk available for kids but horchata was delicious and we liked the watermelon juice option also.  4- Chips and salsa served with no plates, which would have been OK except salsa is served in small ramekons with a tiny spoon and you really can't dip the chips.  We were drizzling salsa on our chips with the spoons and it was becoming a mess so we gave up.  No mild salsa option either- there was spicy and hot.  5- $7.50 for guacamole appetizer and it was good, but small in size and not amazing.  Not worth the $15 we spent for two at the table.   Otherwise,  the main meal was great!  Food tasted fresh and homemade, including the tortillas and chips.  Beans tasted fresh, although black beans were not available.  The food could have been spiced or salted a little more as it was on the bland side. Tacos, however, were perfectly seasoned!   Margarita was very good.  Overall, I'm glad we tried it but probably won't be back.  If we saw a food truck selling their tacos on the street somewhere I'd stop though for sure."}
{"text":"Great addition to the downtown Champaign dining scene! Everything I've had at Maize is incredibly delicious and really reasonably priced. I usually get three tacos, and that's a good amount for a meal. Definitely try the fish tacos! Or get the flautas - they come with a large side of refried beans, rice, and guac.     This is random, but I'm still not sure about the parking situation for this restaurant? Sometimes I've been told it's okay to park in the back, and other times I have to resort to paying for street parking."}
{"text":"Favorite restaurant to go to for tacos! It's close to campus and the food is great. It's never disappointing and I love the ambiance of this place."}
{"text":"a solid option for mexican. food is authentic mexican and flavorful. always great to get home made tortillas. i will definitely go back"}
{"text":"the meat is very well marinated, leaning to the salty side, but still very good. service is fast and the food comes quickly too. prices are very reasonable! would come again."}
{"text":"We went to the new location near the train station in downtown Glambana. It's a full service restaurant and offers alcohol as well! We were quickly seated and served chips and salsa. I think because it's relatively new, there isn't much decor inside. It's still brightly colored but needs a little more pizazz. I got the chalupas with al pastor (my absolute fave) and a fish taco. The chalupas were delicious! They serve you three and it's topped with cream, cheese, lettuce and tomato. The fish taco was a little dry for my taste and I would probably add a sauce on top to finish it off. And maybe a second tortilla. The watermelon margarita was delicious! Try that for sure."}
{"text":"I love your original location so I decided to try the new, larger downtown location. I must say, I'm impressed! The location is much more roomie and completely different. The decor is very simple and elegant. Not exactly what I would think about from Mexican. I know you just opened but i'd like to see a touch more personality in the decor! The walls are kind of bare as of now.   The food is still amazing. I got the potato flautas. I wanted to mix and match but was told I couldn't. Either way, they are perfectly seasoned and really unique tasting, full of flavor. The margarita was also great. Keep up the good work Maize!"}
{"text":"Having lived in Tucson, Arizona, I have eaten a lot of great Mexican food. I have never been thrilled with any of the local mexican restaurants here in Champaign. That is no longer the case. Maize is so good! I tried several times to go to the campus location but it was always too busy.   Now that they have a larger location, it is much better, at least until the students get back to town. Their food tastes incredibly fresh The homemade soft corn tortillas are excellent. I love the brown salsa that comes with the chips. I have only had two menu items - the veggie tacos and the steak fajitas. They are so good it is hard to try anything else, but I will make that my goal. This is my go-to restaurant right now. Great food at a very reasonable price."}
{"text":"Maize is my favorite Mexican restaurant in Champaign-Urbana. The new location is wonderful. Unlike the original location, there is plenty of room to enjoy your dining experience. I suggest trying a Volcan!"}
{"text":"Tacos are the bomb! Especially the Americano with chorizo! I wish they would give bigger portions of the salsa that came with the tortilla chips considering the fact that it was a party of 6 of us but each time we wanted a refill it came right away. Lime margarita was delish! Our server was very friendly & efficient! Nice atmosphere as well!"}
{"text":"Had 3 tacos tradicional (carne asada, pastor, and chorizo), chips and guacamole, and a margarita. Everything was excellent. I will definitely come back. Highly recommended."}
