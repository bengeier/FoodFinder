{"text":"We were regulars at the Yogurt Time before this place opened so needless to say we were ecstatic to see I Roll open up!  Everything was delicious and the staff is super fun and nice.  We will definitely become regulars here!!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and experience loved the ice cream. Went with the wife for the first time on 9/9/2017. Had a lot of fun watching the ice cream be made."}
{"text":"Went there on the day they first open. Delicous ice cream rolls that i never had before in AZ. I ordered number 5 Minions, the mango flavor with peach. Very tasty mango flavor. Will recommend to anyone"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time today and had the Minion rolled ice cream and it was amazing! Definitely stop by and get something it's so cool to watch them make it in front of you. If you've never had rolled iced cream get your first one from these guys it's great."}
{"text":"Was excited to find this place after randomly reading an article on local food. Been watching videos of rolled ice cream being made on instagram for weeks. One of a kind ice cream and experience."}
{"text":"Super yummy rolled ice cream! Nutella party and Black Forest were amazing, can't wait to try more flavors!  Plenty of tables and free wifi"}
{"text":"We had so much fun here.  The kids loved watching their ice cream rolled.  The best part was how frozen the ice cream remains all the way to the bottom of the cup.  If you like bananas you'll love the banana mixed in!"}
{"text":"Ice cream has a weird flaky texture. Other than the fact that it's rolled as opposed to being scooped, there is nothing special/unique about the ice cream. Definitely not worth the $6.46 charged."}
{"text":"First time trying rolled icecream and it was great! One of my coworkers just wants to keep coming back here!"}
{"text":"What a fun way to eat ice cream!  With five base ice cream flavors-original, coffee, chocolate, green tea and mango to pick from, 17 mix-ins and 20 toppings, this spot can offer you a different creation everytime. Some say $5.99 is hefty for an ice cream but if you think of it as a treat or a meal in a cup, it's not that bad!"}
{"text":"Great alternative to traditional froyo. It's cool to see them make the ice cream and then roll it into the cup. Entertaining for young and old to watch. Definitely recommend if you are looking for something different to do for ice cream."}
{"text":"WOW!!!  This place is awesome!  Think of cold stone without all the corporate b.s.  The ice cream is creamy  and full of flavor! They make it right in front of you and the only way to describe it is like a drum line of flavor!  If you aren't here, then you don't know ice cream."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Really simple decorations but totally family friendly and great tasting ice cream! New experience everyone should try!"}
{"text":"Second time going to I Roll Thai Ice Cream.... The first  time I was guessing what might be good. Maybe not my best combination but it was still amazing. The second time was  AMAZING to say the least. The ice was smooth and perfectly rolled. The servers made sure the presentation was beautiful. Side Note: in addition to the ice cream being mine-blowing the servers were very courteous and friendly. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Such a fun twist for your casual sweet-tooth outing! Picking the mix-ins and watching your treat come together was half the experience. The ice cream itself was delicious and honestly, you get enough for two in just one cup. The walls of post-it artwork and walk along the lake were the cherry on top!"}
{"text":"I had my first rolled Thai ice cream here! I ordered the Minion, the mango and peach flavor, and it was amazing! I liked how they used real fruit inside and it wasn't overly sweet. I'll definitely go back to try the Oreo flavor!"}
{"text":"Green Tea Ice Cream is amazingly delightful yay!  come one and come all !! runs about 6.50 for two mix ins and three toppings.. not shabby:)"}
{"text":"This ice cream place is awesome and you can eat h how employee roll the ice on the cold surface and they put it in the cup but its totally up to you because you can choose what ingredient you want in your ice cream."}
{"text":"All I can say is amazing, totally blown away by not only how it's made ( my grand daughter loved watching her ice cream come to life ) but the end result flavor. We will def be back"}
{"text":"Good ice cream but they lose stars from me for 2 reasons:
1) Price - there should be multiple sizes - there is another place in the plaza that serves just as much ice cream for half the price.
2) They told me ALL the fruit on their menu was FRESH, then put CANNED peaches on top. :("}
{"text":"Very friendly staff, and seems like they actually care and love the job- unlike other places where I can only get no more than just an uncomfortable stare. I go for the option of choosing my own flavor and toppings, and the ice cream is the best so far because its not crazy sweet. I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"What a great spot. I'm so glad we found it. My kids had a ball watching the guys make the ice cream on the antigriddle. The ice cream tastes great and they had great flavor combos. The highlight of my ice cream was the actual toasted marshmallows on top. Delicious!  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I love the idea of the rolled up ice cream.  They make it look very cool.  While the ice cream is fine (not super special), the presentation is awesome.  The marshmallows burnt for added flavor.  Very cool.   Very clean place. Prices are a bit high for what you get, but it's worth a taste."}
{"text":"Unique and fun ice cream parlor.  Ordered 3 different creations and all were delicious.  The Minion was an amazing mix of mango and peach,  the Cookie Monster was graham crackers and Oreo and a custom Banana and  brownie was very good.  Getting to watch them make it in front of you and roll it up was a lot of fun and my kids enjoyed it.  Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"This place is adorable!   It's neat to see them mix the ice cream, and the finished product is pretty AND tasty.   I had the strawberry/graham cracker mix and my boyfriend had the Nutella/graham cracker.   

As an aside, I had the impression this is a local business (not a chain) and I'd much rather spend my money locally.   Two thumbs up!!

Update** we came back to bring my boyfriends dad to see (visiting) the rolled ice cream.  It was a hit!  Tried the Black Forest combo and Nutella one (can't remember the name).   Yay!!!"}
{"text":"It was excellent and delicious and everyone was so nice nice helpful! I LOVE THE STICKY NOTE IDEA."}
{"text":"This place was so good!!!! The ice cream is not too sweet but is delicious! The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because the cashier was a grump! She was not very helpful for our first time and seemed like she hated her job! Other than that the ice cream was awesome and watching them do it was awesome!!!! Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Ice cream was good! I wish I had the option to put my toppings on myself! Pricey for 2 people at $15.57 and that was with 20 percent off with my LC bracelet."}
{"text":"It's worth the rolllllllll we were happy to find this as an option for ice cream and even more delighted when we took the first bite"}
{"text":"WOW, such a fun place. You can write on a sticky note and put it on the wall, and you can watch them roll your ice cream. It was amazing. The employees were very nice."}
{"text":"I was so excited for my friend to bring me to her favorite ice cream place (I'm from out of town) and we showed up at 9:40pm to a dark storefront. They were closed... 20 minutes before closing time. So disappointing.... such a waste of a drive."}
{"text":"We thought we were just going for the novelty and fun of watching them make & roll the ice cream. We were pleasantly surprised to find that the ice cream was DELICIOUS! Seriously, so creamy and tasty! The workers were very friendly and the lake area was nice to walk along with our ice cream - all around great experience. We had to restrain ourselves from going back for more right then  we'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"I love ice cream but never had it rolled before!!! I enjoyed the Minions flavor which is a peach and mango base. Plus I got to add 3 toppings at no additional cost. My girlfriend got the Coffee Kraze flavor and she fell in love with it. I will come back to this establishment again and try something new next time. Thanks for the good ice cream guys. Keep it up!"}
{"text":"The best ice cream in town. Check this place out, take a walk around the corner to the pond. (Good spot for a date)"}
{"text":"Pretty fun and different way of eating ice cream. We got it to go and it hadn't melted by the time we got home. It was really good too!"}
{"text":"I've been waiting for a good rolled ice cream spot here. After having tried some in California I was hoping one would pop up soon. 

Needless to say, this place is cheaper and less packed than what I had previously tried. The service was quick and friendly and the ambience of the place was welcoming with an easy going fun decoration theme; Post its cover the walls with what I assume are customer additions. 

I recommend giving this place a shot and you have plenty of flavor options to work with. 

My order: vanilla ice cream with brownie and caramel mix ins. Banana, brownie, and mochi toppings."}
{"text":"Was so yummy!! It was also awesome that you could watch them make it start to finish. Will be back for sure. They also give 50% off to emergency services but no discount for teachers."}
{"text":"My daughter has been craving rolled ice cream ever since she tried it in Utah. She was happy to find one here in AZ.   Luckily for us it was close and didn't disappoint.  A new treat escape."}
{"text":"Cool concept and tasty!  They roll your ice cream out and serve it in rolls. A must see if it's your first time.  You get to pick two mix-ins and up to three toppings.  They have plenty of options, which made it hard to decide.  

I chose the chocolate ice cream with caramel and Oreo mix ins with graham cracker, M&M, and whipped cream!  Yummm!

The ice cream itself was damn good!  I can't wait to come back and try another creation!
The wall of post it notes is great entertainment while eats me your ice cream"}
{"text":"Ice cream was amazing. I'm not a big ice cream fan, but my friends wanted to go. I tried some of their ice cream. Even the texture is different. I loved it."}
{"text":"Awesome ice cream! Best matcha flavor i've had in the states! Would recommend to anyone looking for authentic rolled ice cream!!"}
{"text":"I like how you get a few toppings included in the price and I like how it's open late! Got the matcha rolled ice cream with strawberries in it and it was awesome. Good matcha flavor and the ice cream texture was perfect!"}
{"text":"So Good!!! There are so many flavors to choose from and the customer service is awesome. We will definitely be frequenting this place. You must try!!!"}
{"text":"What a brilliant concept.  I was impressed with the strawberry graham flavor.  It was mesmerizing just to watch how they rolled the ice cream into perfect cylinders right in front of your eyes.  The shop itself is minimal with very basic tables and chairs and post-it notes covering the walls.  I'm guessing that's the look they were going for.  If they could make this a little more upscale, these guys are sitting on a gold mine!"}
{"text":"Yummy!!!! What a fun take a simple desert! So cool!!!  Looks like it just opened! I would maybe suggest offering drinks cause he ice cream makes me super thirsty...."}
{"text":"This place recently opened up and I have heard great things. I'm glad I stopped in to try it with my daughter. It's tasty, and fun to watch them \"roll\" your ice cream. Surprisingly more dense than it looks, this will fill you up and is worth the $. Plus you get to choose what you put in it. Plenty of options between all the flavors, mix ins, and toppings. Your options are endless!"}
{"text":"The presentation is amazing, and it tastes great too! We got the Original flavor (tastes like true cream) with brownie and caramel mixed in, with strawberries and graham crackers on top. Employees were friendly and even gave us each a bottle of water for free."}
{"text":"Wonderful experience!  Need to see it to believe it!  The staff was friendly. Menu appears small but with all the combinations it's really limited only by your imagination. Most ice cream flavors come with three toppings. You choose from the list on the board. To really make it your own and satisfy your specific cravings. I had Nutella with whip cream and marshmallows. The marshmallow  was on top and they actually torched them to a light brown. We had one green tea Oreo with whipped cream, chocolate chips and Kitcat bar pieces. We also had a green tea with graham cracker and whipped cream and strawberries  (fresh!) on it. They were all excellent. An experience you need to see to believe and taste to satisfy your desire for a unique delicious ice cream experience!"}
{"text":"Awesome experience at this place will definitely be coming back. I have never had anything like this and they treat each one like a work of art. I recommend the coffee flavor as well as the green tea."}
{"text":"Great experience. The flavors are good and they can mix in ingredients. The ingredient list is not super, like they don't have peanut butter, but still very good. The strawberry cheesecake is good and the rest of the family like the Minion style."}
{"text":"Very fun way to eat ice cream! You pick your flavor and then watch them mix it up and roll it together.  It was $6 for a cup and in my opinion, a good price.  The ONLY downside is how there are Post its all over the walls and not a welcoming seating area to hang out and chill.  I would return and try more flavors."}
{"text":"Nice clean atmosphere. Workers were friendly . The Oreo brownie roll was delicious. It tasted almost like in between ice cream and fro yo not super creamy rich like ice cream but smooth like fro yo. Unique concept and there's really no other place like It"}
{"text":"Ice cream was good get to see everything done in front of you which is cool. Ambience was a little bland, and associates were a little dry. Sticky note concept was pretty cool!"}
{"text":"I don't remember the name of the bowl I had but it was Mango flavored ice cream with fresh fruit (pineapple, blueberries and strawberries). I think the novelty of it being rolled is what brings people in, however I really didn't think the ice cream was that good. Definitely not a strong mango flavor. I prefer the creaminess of gelato so I'll probably stick to that. I feel for $6 and change there are better choices in the ice cream world....like a pint of Ben and Jerry's or Tallenti Gelato."}
{"text":"This was one of our favorite stops while staying in Chandler for the week! We have been gone since the end of April but still keep talking about this place! Their ice cream is SO GOOD !!!! Wish we had one here in Seattle!"}
{"text":"Super friendly guys, nice sofas to chill in at the back with your friends, and cool rolled ice-cream. 
You choose an ice cream flavor and tell them what you want rolled in with your ice cream. This is a light, refreshing dessert that doesn't leave you feeling guilty because it isn't too rich or sweet. I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars because I do prefer a creamier ice cream, but I would definitely come back and have ice cream here from time to time. 
Come visit this place, because sometimes you want something different from the usual frozen yogurt/ice-cream shop deal!"}
{"text":"Amazing atmosphere a hidden gem in the desert . Upon arrival your greeted by a magnificent black board . Combinations and original creations. Very pleased with the cheesecake topping and rolled Thai ice cream . 5 stars for sure !"}
{"text":"We walk in and the cashier greets us (but you can tell she doesn't want to be there) she explains the menu and how we can build the rolls she gets a little snappy when we mistakenly try to add an extra topping, I wanted that extra topping and I would've asked if it were possible to pay extra for the extra but she was just so rude  lol. Anyways we move onto the rolling process and we get to watch the boys roll 'em out which was pretty neat. The Ice cream was amazing!"}
{"text":"I love this place so much. Their coconut ice cream is great and all of the flavors taste fresh. It's a cool experience because you get to see the ice cream get rolled. My favorite ice cream place in the east valley!"}
{"text":"I'd heard of rolled ice cream before but we don't have any near us. You can pick your ice cream flavor, mix ins, and toppings. I chose the original flavor with almond butter and pecan mix ins. I chose the mini chocolate chips and mochi on top. I wasn't entirely sure how it would all go together but was pleasantly surprised. It was fun watching them make it and it was delicious. I'd like to go back and will definitely check it out if something similar opened nearby. 5 stars."}
{"text":"So good our favorite way to eat ice cream!! Cool vibe new to us!! Love love love!! Awesome wall art with sticky notes"}
{"text":"I went here this week and was pleased. I've never had ice cream in this style before and I Roll Thai did not disappoint. The staff was friendly but maybe they could be a bit more helpful to those who never had their ice cream before. The menu placement on the way was awkward (or maybe it was just me). The shop is large and could fit more tables or something to make it a bit more inviting, perhaps in time. In anycase, I recommend this place if you're in the neighborhood. We will be back for sure since it's walking distance to us."}
{"text":"I thought I'd stop by and try this new place. Lots of different options and toppings. The cashier was super friendly and explained the menu to me.  I had the green tea ice cream with strawberries and grahm crackers, oh my it's delicious. They are super friendly here. The price is slightly on the high side but I would say it's worth it."}
{"text":"Fresh made rolled ice cream with fresh ingredients, really lit watching them make it. Btw love the backdoor view."}
{"text":"This place is so cool! We loved watching them make the ice cream and eating it too, it was delicious. We had the minion, chocolate blast. Both delicious. Nice little seating area out back by the lake also."}
{"text":"Meh...shit service and all Chinese people working there. The ice cream is decent at best.

The place is filthy and definitely needs a visit from the health department.

The people working were not friendly and it's nothing like the experience we had in Thailand.

 No hello and welcome, no goodbye and thank you. For the most part everyone working here kept their face and their cell phones the entire time. We were the only ones there.

Skip"}
{"text":"What a fun experience! The staff was friendly and helpful.  The ice cream was yummy.  Its in a lake,  so I wish there had been tables and chairs outside to sit and enjoy our treats.  We sat in the grass.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"We had the green tea with strawberry, with strawberry, mochi, and coconut flakes on top. It was amazing."}
{"text":"Freaking delicious and neat!!! My family will definitely be back for sure.... yall need to go"}
{"text":"Rose: Where are you going?

? The Golden Girls


Same, Dorothy.

So, the weather in the Northern Hemisphere may be getting cooler but who can say no to ice cream?  Ice cream is always the right option.

I got the Matcha Lady which is matcha ice cream with bits of strawberries in it. It was delicious although the matcha could stand having a stronger matcha flavor. My three toppings were almonds, blueberries, and Oreo. I was disappointed that they didn't crush my Oreo into the ice cream and mix it up. Instead, they just stuck one cookie on top like they had forgotten about it. Eh...

Service was prompt and friendly. The guy at the register asked us if it was our first time in and gave us a break down of the menu even though it seemed pretty straight forward. The place was clean, I had a lot of fun looking at the Post-It notes all over the place, and the ice cream was good. You'll never have to worry about freezer burn since they make it right in front of you. For $6.46, it's definitely a decent occassional treat."}
{"text":"Very cool concept!  We need more of these as I drove 15 minutes to it but it was worth the drive!  Great flavor and prices are good."}
{"text":"It was our first time in this place. The atmosphere is really nice, the employees very kind and the ice cream super delicious. We choose the \"build your own \" with green tea ice cream, it has the perfect amount of sweetness., it let you perceive the toppings flavors. We will come back"}
{"text":"I cannot believe this place is actually in Arizona! They can roll up the ice-cream in many different flavor, make it all pretty and sprinkle it with 3 different toppings of your choice. If you don't like the set menu, you can also create one with ice-cream/toppings of your choice. Service is great, the place is clean and organized. You can also see how they make it through the glass window. When the weather is cooler, you can also sit outside the patio enjoying your ice-cream with the view of the lake. What more can you ask for? 

If you show them photos that you posted on yelp, you will also receive a small free gift from the store. Don't wait until you are home to upload it :)"}
