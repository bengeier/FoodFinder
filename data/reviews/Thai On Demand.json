{"text":"WOW! What a tasty surprise to discover Thai on Demand. Owner and Chef Kris is wonderful his food reflects the 30 yrs of experience he has had with Thai cooking. Tom Ka soup with coconut rice will become your new comfort food. The spices and heat of each dish is made to order you will not be disappointed with any of your choices. ONLY EAT HERE IF YOU WANT A NEW ADDICTION!"}
{"text":"We ate at this place twice during our stay in Scottsdale- it was just that good. Upon entering this small establishment, we were welcomed & greeted by the owner who took great pride in reviewing the menu options to our family of four. We took his recommendations & we were not disappointed. Our favorites were the Tom Ka Chicken soup, the Green Curry with shrimp, the Sweet Crispy Garlic Tamarind Fish (a boneless white fish with a sweet sauce), & Pad Ken Mao (drunken noodles with chicken). My teenage girls also devoured their Thai iced tea. This is a fairly new restaurant in the area & I really hope the locals give this awesome Thai restaurant a try- you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Best Thai food in town ! Great service and fast ! Owner is so welcoming and friendly! Being someone from Thailand this place really hits close to home . Authentic food and reasonably priced ! This place is a definite must try !"}
{"text":"The food is fresh, delicious, authentic Thai cuisine. You are greeted with happy faces and a meticulous kitchen.  We are so happy to have Chris and his staff in Scottsdale!!!"}
{"text":"BEWARE! Your takeout order remains very hot for many miles! Glad to see more Thai restaurants in my area. Small and spartan place with tasteful decor and representative Thai recipe cans, and the food is cooked before your eyes in the open kitchen. There's also a nice patio out front! Enjoy it before it gets too hot. Super nice service by the beautiful counter gal. Popped in for the red curry lunch special and tom ka gai soup, both on the HOT spice level. Very hot and Thai hot are after hot. I sweated just a little. Perfect heat for me. Large chunks of chicken! Too many bell pepper slices in the curry though. The TKG soup was thin but yummy and had the flavor I expected. I suspect this was CANNED with chicken added. How can I tell? The wimpy bay leaf and the dead cilantro leaf and stem. The lunch soup is superior! It was alive with a multitude of ingredients and plenty of them. Superior to whom? Thai House a few miles north, whose lonely dumpling is suspended like a dead cuttlefish. (Thai House is still a great place, just the lunch soup lacks.)"}
{"text":"Me and my fianc√©e were looking for a Thai restaurant after a Spring Training game so we checked out Thai on demand. The food was delicious and the service was great. The sweet and sour chicken, drunken noodles and yellow curry is so good! Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Good Thai food...had the fish and pad Thai. The owner greeted us to ask us how our food was. Overall just a nice experience and a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Fabulously fresh Thai food. No msg and friendly service. I had the spicy fresh basil and Chilli Fried Rice with pork belly absolutely delicious. Would definitely eat here again!"}
{"text":"Great food!  I'm so happy that I found this place.  I highly recommend it.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"our new favorite Thai cafe. Freshest ingredients & spices. Eat here whenever we are in the area. Have tried all of their noodle dishes & loved them All! Chris & Miria are friendly & helpful."}
{"text":"I hate to flame a place that has such a pleasant girl on the phone but this was the worst Thai food, maybe the worst any food we have ever eaten.  The Tom Yum soup was just broth with dry chicken and a few mushrooms' the broth itself  some dark concoction and was extremely hot what the level was.    My wife had pad thai, a very predictable dish... there were no green beans, the noodles were greasy and blad, the crushed peanut were like powder or saw dust or something.  I can't believe all these glowing reviews unless people have never had real Thai food.  Not to be mean, but stay away from this place."}
{"text":"Huge fan of this place food is amazing. I would recommend any of the curries for lunch 8.95.   Or if you wanted something different the crispy chili chicken with coconut rice is amazing. Watch the spice levels but for me very hot was very good for this meal. The curries Very hot was way too hot.   and the soups are really good and cheap $4-$5 dollars."}
{"text":"Amazing!! I'm visiting from California and the owner stopped what he was doing to make me fresh extra sweet Thai tea and that was unexpected and super appreciated. Next trip we will be back to support good service."}
{"text":"If I could give a place zero stars, this would be the one. Ordered pad thai and spring rolls through doordash- didn't get the sauce I asked for and the pad thai was so disgusting I took one bite and threw it away. It tasted burnt and had no sauce on it. Wouldn't recommend this place to anyone, don't waste your money."}
{"text":"OMG so good. My boyfriend and I tried Thai On Demand for this first time and loved it so much we tried to order takeout again the next night (but unfortunately they had already closed!). Can't wait to try it again!"}
{"text":"Delicious I have known the owner Chris for many years  I am so happy that he opened his own restaurant   This is Thai food that I fell in love with when I was in Thailand The flavors are pure and not altered to suit the American palate"}
{"text":"We were in a hurry today and saw this restaurant on Yelp. The egg rolls were delicious. It is true no wait staff but everyone was very nice and friendly. We were able to sit inside as there were a few tables. See you soon!"}
{"text":"This was a really great lunch. The quality of the food was very high. The sweet crispy fish was to die for. I will get that every time I go back. It was crispy, the fish was flaky and the sauce was just the perfect amount of sweet. We also had the eggplant basil chicken. It was a great contrast to have the chicken with the sweet fish. Also, we had the summer rolls and they were so fresh and the peanut sauce was awesome! *if you're vegan or vegetarian ask for friend tofu. It was so tasty!*  I can't wait to go back there next time I am in town. I want to try the whole menu!   If you have any questions about the menu, ask for Kris, he will answer all your questions and is just a super nice guy.  5 stars!"}
{"text":"WOW Never thought I would find a good Thai food in Scottsdale , was I wrong or what ?  The food tasted very good and I asked them spicy and they gave me spicy that most places can't do it ."}
{"text":"First visit today for lunch. Quaint and simple place and was able to sit outside in warm weather. Pad se ew was terrific and HUGE portion with lunch special price was$9.00 including tea. My new Thai place."}
{"text":"I just tried this Thai place today and it was fabulous!  It is small in size but serves the biggest delight in Thai food than other places I have been to.  I had Thai Key Mao that was incredible and my friend had red curry with brown rice and hers was equally so.  Both lunch specials came with a soup appetizer.  We also enjoyed Thai iced coffee.  We both will be back soon!!!  I definitely recommend this cafe to anyone who truly enjoys Thai cuisine...true to Thai seasoning, fresh vegetables and dishes."}
{"text":"I am very picky about my Thai food -- this is the best Thai restaurant in Scottsdale. The spice level is legitimate. I can eat Thai spicy elsewhere in the valley without a blink of an eye; however, very hot here is just that. Definitely will be returning for more."}
{"text":"I have been waiting and waiting for this place to open! I typically go to the Thai place around the corner but that place is sometimes inconsistent with the quality of food they provide. Walked in and was greeted very kindly, the staff were very attentive but not only that, the vibe of the whole room feels warm and welcoming. I ordered the pad thai and the spring roll, which were both amazing. I sit down in my office and eat while i work, so if my pad thai can taste good an hour after i ordered it, its a keeper in my book! Thanks guys!!!"}
{"text":"Wow this place is amazing! The crispy smoked Chilli Chicken with coconut rice was unbelievable. I have been waiting for a Thai place like this!"}
{"text":"My wife and I tried this place out based on the many positive reviews. We were not disappointed. The place is a little hard to find tucked back in a strip mall. It's small but feels rather comfortable. Our lunch specials were fairly priced and rather tasty. Service was also pretty good and fast.   I can't say the food was good enough to drive across town for, so I'm giving four stars. However, if you're in the area and craving Thai food, you should definitely try this place."}
{"text":"Amazing food! The lady and I just finished our meal from this establishment. She had the Tom ka gai soup and I had the pad Thai with chicken. Both were fantastic and we absolutely loved it, food was truly authentic and hit my soul to core!"}
{"text":"One word.... Amazing.!   Pork belly fried rice was fire.!  I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Just tried this place.  Calling it average would be a compliment.  Bland, not talking about the spice level, talking about the flavors.  The red curry is not red curry...it's yellowish, boring sauce.  The Pad Thai is a big yawn.  The avocado dumplings are crazy oily & no taste...hate to leave such a bad review as we had high hopes.  Hope they can get it together..."}
{"text":"Nice little hole in the wall Thai place, beware of the Thai spicy (and even the \"very hot\") and don't miss out on the crispy smoked chili chili chicken dish with coconut rice , so good. The tom yum soup was good, not as lemongrass-y as I'd like, but still good. Portions on the soup are small, and overall a little pricey, but I don't mind paying more if the quality is good, and it was good. I hear they have a good lunch special during the weekdays, so we'll have to go back another time."}
{"text":"This my fav Thai place for a quick fix always fresh always quick. These people care about good food. Yum!!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! As a Thai food fanatic I am very particular about Thai food. This place reminds me of a restaurant/street food fusion. Check it out!"}
{"text":"This cute little Thai Restaurant is amazing !!! The teriyaki chicken is crispy, perfectly cooked with the most melt in your mouth perfection ever  the Thai Tea is creamy and delicious with a slight taste of cinnamon that I really enjoyed. The price is just what you would expect but the taste of the food is way better then anywhere for the price !! This is a family run business and that in itself shows integrity and passion for what they do, I will be a regular here from now on.  Can't wait to try everything. They are in the corner by the tavern grille and barber don't hesitate to sit and enjoy on the patio the have a heater for these chilly nights !! yum yum"}
{"text":"Great place for lunch - always looking for a quick place for good Thai food in Scottsdale, and this is definitely such a place. I had the Panang curry and the ginger chicken pot stickers. I asked for.a heat level of 4/5 and my brow was nicely perspiring by the end of the meal :-). Great value, friendly people, fast service. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Great place.   I enjoyed it.  Pot stickers were excellent.  Chili chicken was delicious"}
{"text":"Got takeout here for the first time last night! Was happy to see all of the vegetarian/vegan options! I had a hard time deciding what to get. Also decided I needed multiple appetizers haha. My boyfriend ordered avocado cream cheese wontons and red curry with chicken. He said his food was good! We both loved the avocado cream cheese wontons, they were delicious. I got veggie dumplings and vegan yellow curry. The veggie dumplings were very tasty, but the curry wasn't great. Maybe I should've ordered it with more spice, I got mild like I normally do at other Thai restaurants, but it was incredibly bland. I would totally come back but I don't think I would order the curry again. People here are really nice! Both on the phone when ordering and in person. I got super lost in the parking lot trying to find it, so I called and they were helpful and patient with my directionally-challenged self haha. Wasn't outrageously pricey for all the food we got either. Good experience here!"}
{"text":"Small and delicious neighborhood Thai restaurant. Portions were good. Medium and hot were less spicy than the usual Thai restaurants. Only 10 seats inside, another 15 outside."}
{"text":"Had the drunken noodles. Spice level was just perfect and with a nice numbing effect. Owner was extremely friendly and even told us the story of the origin of the dish. Thai coffee was also excellent. A hidden gem all the way around."}
{"text":"Thai on Demand delivers just as their name implies...  I was at Mountain View Park with my kids on a recent Monday evening.  I looked down at my watch to realize it was dinner time.  Instead of driving home and making dinner, I decided to conveniently order food for takeout on my way home.  Thai on Demand to the rescue!  I ordered the following: - Steamed Veggie Pot Stickers -Fried Pad Thai Spring Roll -Panang Curry with chicken done medium + steamed jasmine rice -Pad Si Ew with shrimp done medium  -Yellow Curry with Chicken done hot with coconut rice  It was ready upon arrival (even earlier than promised), and the service was super friendly...   The Spring Roll and the coconut rice were my favorite things of the order.  Unfortunately, we found that the food didn't have a ton of spice or flavor... neither curry dish was great.  I was excited that the panang curry supposedly included \"bell pepper, egg plants, and carrots,\" but there were only two small pieces of eggplant to be found.  On a positive note, the servings were a good size and we had plenty of leftovers... If we order from TOD again, we'll definitely try some different dishes and go for a higher spice level.  The owner, Kris, seemed sweet and customer service focused, so I hope this business continues to do well."}
{"text":"What an unexpected delight! There are several restaurants in this shopping center, all vying for customers; I am so glad we chose this one for lunch! We had Crispy Sweet & Sour Coconut Chicken and the Green Curry. Absolutely delicious! The staff was so friendly and helpful. We will be back!"}
{"text":"The food and the service here are AMAZING! Best Thai food around! I've had the pad thai, drunken noodles, and the crispy sweet garlic tamarind fish and every single dish was delicious!!"}
{"text":"Awesome Thai spot! You go up and order at the counter, and the employees come to your table to see how everything is, and to provide refills as needed.  The food was delicious, and the service from all employees was top notch.  Chris, thanks for a great experience.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place reminded me of the thai restaurants i used to go to when i lived in Thailand.  Great food!"}
{"text":"This is a nice smaller restaurant but the food packs a punch. We love Thai food, heard about this place and decided to give it a try. I had the pad Thai because I feel it is the best is the best way to measure a Thai restaurant and it was fairly wonderful. You get multiple options for heat (mild, medium, hot, very hot and Thai hot). Heat level is often subjective so I opted for 'very hot' with it being my first visit.  The noodles were cooked perfectly, the portion size was filling and, yes, \"very hot\" is an 8 out of 10 (assuming Thai hot is 10 of 10\") but not overwhelming.   My wife had the yellow curry and deemed it \"fantastic.\" She is a big fan of curry and has tried it all over this country and the world.    The staff were very nice and gracious.   This is a new neighborhood gem for us."}
{"text":"I just tried this new Thai restaurant, and I'm glad I did! It's my new favorite restaurant.  If you are a real foodie who enjoys authentic Thai cuisine done extremely well, with a twist of innovation, in an unpretentious, mom-and-pop style restaurant, well, this is your lucky find!  The service is very casual, with an ordering counter and tables inside and on the front patio. The woman who took our order was very nice and extremely helpful in guiding us through the menu. (To be perfectly honest, per our request, she basically ordered for us.)  We tried the crispy smoked chili chicken with coconut rice, from the \"On Demand Uniqueness\" menu. \"Bitesizes Chicken breast, lightly battered with coconut tempura, flash fried, then glazed with   smoked chili-tamarind chutney, sprinkled with crispy Kaffir and basil leaves, served with coconut rice. It was hot, flavorful and had just the right texture of crunch along with the tender chicken.  The accompanying coconut rice was light and flavorful, in some ways reminiscent of the rice in a mango and sticky rice desert, only much lighter in flavor and texture. It was so good, we immediately decided we should get an order to take home.  Next was Pad Key Mao, also know as drunken noodles. We got it with chicken. \"Spicy Thai chilies and garlic pan fried with chicken or Pork, flat noodles in Kaprow basil sauce along with Chinese broccoli, yellow onion, green onion, Jalape√±o, and bean sprouts.\"  They really nailed the complex flavors in the light sauce, and the proportions and makeup of the accompanying chicken and vegetables. Delicious!  The proprietor, Kris, came out to greet us and made us feel like valued customers. I especially appreciate getting to know the folks, and not feel like an anonymous customer in an anonymous world.  We realized too late that we had forgotten to take pictures. The food looked and smelled so good that we were almost nearly done before it dawned on us that we missed the photo opp.  We had contemplated taking a shot of the empty pics, but that seemed lame. A better plan would be to return, try our way around more menu items, and hope to remember to take photos then!  Until then... I hope you give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Wonderful tom ka and pot stickers. Ditto on curry. Chef from Malee's on Main in Scottsdale so had to be great!"}
{"text":"The food was horrible! I had the red curry and it had a bell pepper that had fungus on it. My husband ordered the fish and it was over cooked and chewy. These reviews seriously seemed like they were made up."}
{"text":"Visited due to high ratings on Yelp. Was absolutely disappointed in quality of my tempura chicken dish. Meat was very hard to chew. Over cooked maybe or chicken was cut too small. The owner was really nice and I really should've mentioned the problem. The other customers seemed to have better dishes. Just way overpriced for what I got."}
{"text":"Just opened and well worth checking out. The flavors are fantastic, prices reasonable and service excellent. Everything about this cozy eatery, as you enter, says it is going to be good.  It was very good, 3 of us ordered a varied sampling to decide the chef's merits. Authentic cuisine with and level of spice we ordered."}
{"text":"This place came up in a Yelp search when we were nearby and it's a new business, so I came here yesterday to order takeout. I had to circle around a bit to find it since the signage wasn't very large but I made it.  I went around 245 and I was the only one in at that time. It's a small restaurant and they sell various products there like curry paste and sauces. I decided to order the pad thai with fried tofu and got it very hot, which seemed to be the equivalent of a 4/5 on their spice scale. I also ordered the panang curry with white rice, hot level. It took about 10-15 minutes for my food to be cooked and it was packaged well. The owner was very welcoming and accommodating as I substituted tofu instead of chicken in my dishes.   I liked my food, the very hot level in my noodle dish was definitely spicy which I appreciated. Some places do not give you the spice level you ask for, which can be disappointing. The curry wasn't hot at all so I should've upgraded that level, but it was tasty. There are a lot of Thai restaurants to choose from around town and I even saw one across the street from here, but the great food and genuine service makes this spot stand out for me. I do hope they fare well and wish them success."}
{"text":"Wow! So glad we didn't give up trying to find this place. Everything was so good. We sat outside and ate and they were very nice there. I got the pad Thai which I make myself at home so I'm pretty picky. I loved it! Hubby And boys got the drunken noodles and they were so delicious too! My mom got the crispy teriyaki chicken which was a surprising big hit! We look forward to coming back. I hope they put a sign up soon so people don't miss this place!"}
{"text":"Delicious Penang Curry! Staff was very friendly and service was quick. Liked the decor and large outdoor patio. I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Finding a good Thai restaurant brings me so much joy!!!  I'm so glad I took a chance and decided to order take out!!!  So yummy!!!  Please go here for some good food!!!  And they are so nice!!!  A big plus!!!"}
{"text":"Great service and a great local business run by people who know how to make some yummy Thai dishes. The yellow curry is our go to and never fails to satisfy. The pad Thai is also very good!"}
{"text":"Authentic and excellent. Pa king is a little tight since it's right n st to the Tavern Grill but it's worth it. Try the Crispy Tamarind Fish you won't b disappointed. Oh and the nicest proprietors as well"}
{"text":"Wow! Found you in a Yelp search. I've been looking for great Thai food near my work and you are it! My friend and I came in for lunch carryout and had Pad Thai and Panang Chicken. Authentic flavor and quality ingredients! I will tell my friends and be back for more. The Thai tea was fantastic too. Thanks Kris."}
{"text":"The restaurant is kind of hidden in a small plaza, but this little hole in the wall shop is sooo good. The food was delicious and quick to be ready, the workers were very friendly, and the place was very clean. I ordered the pad se ew, and the fresh spring rolls and my friend got the pad Thai and potstickers. No complaints here! The appetizers were the perfect size to share (4 pieces each so we had 2 of each app) and they were mighty good. I recommend the potstickers if I had to choose! I will definitely be coming here more often."}
{"text":"Wonderful neighborhood find - a jewel in the desert!  High quality food, good sized portions, fairly priced, clean environment, great customer service, and owned and managed by Kris, the amazing former general manager of Malee's (in Scottsdale). Bravo!  Brilliant!  Best!  A Star of Thai cuisine!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious and the staff was very friendly! A great spot for a quick lunch. Patio seating is perfect for a nice day."}
{"text":"Just discovered this place. Love that I can get thai to go! I ordered the drunken noodles with veggies and the highest level of spice. Finally a place that doesn't fool around with the heat it's hot! love it. Huge portion too."}
{"text":"We were visiting Phoenix and were looking for for something fresh and fast.  We were very pleased with the friendliness of the staff and the quality and taste of the food.  We tried the green curry and the drunken noodles.  Everything was very good.  The patio seating was a nice plus as well."}
{"text":"This is a new and authentic place. The flavors are out of this world! Will definitely make it a favorite frequent stop for take out."}
{"text":"Some of the best Thai food I've had in Phoenix. Definitely order the tom kha gai. Pad Thai was also delicious. Super fresh ingredients prepared deliciously!"}
{"text":"I love Thai food and try different places out in the valley all the time. They need to spice up their curry dishes a bit. Mine was a little bland, but all in all it's good!"}
{"text":"This was a great surprise tonight! Ordered take out and thought we would try this place. I always get the Pad Thai no matter what my husband and I order and it's always ok to good. Not tonight...it was amazing! Ordered it hot and it was perfect! The take out service was also.5 star...this place will be a repeat for sure."}
{"text":"Excellent food I just ordered the green Thai curry with h pork and I am very impressed. They give you a lot for the price, I ordered pickup and it was ready when I got there. I will definitely return great service and food !!!"}
{"text":"Do you want fresh, exotic, and authentic?  Krisada will hook you up. The ingredients will blow you away. Go mild or slide down the scale to Thai hot  (or God forbid Chef hot. Unless you are Jeff Enderle). Try the Panang w the Tom Ka Gai to start. Also, crispy sweet garlic fish is to die for.  Go. You will thank me."}
{"text":"I loved the flavors.  I had red curry with shrimp, it was spicy but really delicate.  Friendly service, they care about customer satisfaction."}
