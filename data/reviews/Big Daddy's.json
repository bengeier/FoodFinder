{"text":"Just went here based on reviews... Waited 10-15 min for a terrible burger. I had to spit out the last bite... Was so rough and gross."}
{"text":"Big Daddy's was a winner for me. From the outside you don't really get a feel for what they're about, but its kindof a burger joint with selection of north african cuisine, possibly Algerian. I got the Margeuz, an Algerian style lamb sausage served either as a sandwich or an a plate with fries and salad, I went with the latter. It was surprisingly awesome. The fries are cooked perfectly and served with an amazing hot sauce. 

I've since been back twice to grab a quick snack of fries with hot sauce, really good.

The owner is very friendly, and the food is great, I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"This place is shockingly good for a takeout burger place.  I had low expectations, given the legacy of crappy fast food places that have been cycling through this location recently. But Big Daddy's has become one of my go-to places in the neighborhood. 

Good burgers, steak sandwiches or lamb sausage. They make a pretty damn good homemade hot sauce. A number of salad options. Typical fast food \"combo\" options (burger/fries/drink for under $10), but with the food a step above. Haven't had the steam table food but it always looks good too.  

Total gem. Check it out."}
{"text":"I've been to many eateries along Bloor Street W and this establishment makes it to my rank of 3 easily. The food quality is top tier. From the meat, to the condiments (some homemade), everything is absolutely delicious. For such quality food the prices are really affordable. In comparison to many mediocre places along that street this place takes it, hands down . The owner is really friendly, and gives the place a very welcoming feel. You dont find such service/quality nowadays, place is a gem."}
{"text":"Great burger, awesome fries. The price is right. I recommend this spot if your craving a real burger. The only bummer is that there are few tables but the staff makes up for it. Great spot!"}
{"text":"Had low expectations by the look of this place from the outside. But I was pleasantly surprised by the burgers. The patties are freshly made with a decent selection of toppings. For the price you can't complain."}
{"text":"Perfect place to pick up a quick lunch or dinner on your way home from work.  The burger and steak sandwich are good. The poutine (I think they use a vegetable gravy), is actually so tasty even with the untraditional gravy!"}
{"text":"Very close to my place, I have had their burger, steak sandwich, poutine and the steam table food tonight (chicken leg, rice and potatoes).  Always extremely reliable and the service has been fantastic.  As another reviewer has mentioned this location has always been poor up until now.  Totally recommend!"}
{"text":"Just four stools facing the window and two two-person tables, Big Daddy's seems like a humble burger joint.  Good homemade patties and custom made burgers, great pricing for combos."}
{"text":"This place really flies under the radar in terms of burgers... I just had a combo (burger, fries and drink) all well under $10!!  It was really good!! I've been to gourmet burger places that weren't much better!  If you just want a good and tasty cheap homemade burger... Try it out!  I was pretty impressed!  The fries aren't homemade but whatever kind they use, I really liked them too!!   I told them they should put a sign in their window letting people know the burgers are homemade... They could do well here with some promotion!"}
{"text":"The burger was pretty good but not fantastic. 
The sauce on poutine was like a lemon flavour. Not my type of poutine. But still good"}
