{"text":"Came in at a busy time and had to wait for a while to get seated. That's the only problem I face here during weekends.Dessert was so delicious that it was worth the wait. I would recommend everyone to try it at least once. I am posting few pictures as well."}
{"text":"If any description of this dessert-centric restaurant fits, it is \"the resolution-killer\" that rings the truest.  This is a sit-down restaurant offering a wide variety of sweets.  The menu is a full three panel - front and back - array of original creations, ranging from the unique and beautiful Lazy Sundaes to the Scoop du Jour - one or two scoops with cream and cherries.  Of course, you can also just select from the many offered toppings and ice cream flavours to create-your-own.  Ice cream includes peanut butter, nutello chocolate (not to be confused with Nutella) and vanilla-honey, amongst others.  On top of that, they throw in a freshly made crepe or waffle, some bananas or strawberries, chocolate sauce and a couple of dollops of the clearly-in-house-made whipped cream, and you have a dessert that will put you in a delightful sugar coma!  It was close to 11:00 p.m. when I made my way to Demetre's, but there were still a good number of sweet-toothed patrons enjoying some of the sugary creations - this was clearly be more than your regular two-scoop waffle-cone kind of place.  They make all of the ice creams on the premises, using fresh Ontario dairy and utilizing a special freezing process that prevents ice crystals from forming in the carefully crafted artisan frozen treats.  The servings provide you more than enough ice cream and extras to share comfortably, but my group decided to be gluttonous and each have their own; three ice cream crepe dishes, one with peanut butter ice cream, one nutello chocolate and one with the house chocolate.  The best thing about these desserts, right down to the whipped cream, is the balance of sweetness with the bold flavours.  There is a truly special way they do things that prevents the strong flavours from overwhelming the whole dish.  The peanut butter ice cream was nowhere near that almost sticky consistency and too-rich taste that can be attached to some PB creations; the whipped cream was a clean and creamy compliment to the light chocolate syrup; and the fruit was fresh and surprisingly bright considering the winter months.  I am a self-proclaimed cheap dessert-eater, but here I felt like I got much more than I paid for.  The dishes come in at about $10 each - but, if you're sharing, which is probably more appropriate than polishing off a whole plate alone, it is quite affordable - especially for the top-notch quality.  The cherry on top was the service.  It was fast, friendly, and appropriately attentive.  A few casual checks were done here and there and an offer for re-fills was made - so simple, but so important.  If you haven't done so yet, check out Caf√© Demetre. It's a sweet spot to get some sweets."}
{"text":"Oh goodness. Let me start off with the good. The same waffle I order at all the demetres restaurants was good. The inside is nicely put together. Now the bad. Parking... Omg. You have to park in a dingy smelly parking lot and go through endless corridors and doors to find your way out. That's if you find the \"free parking\" to begin with. Going back in the parking garage the way you came is also not a possibility so get ready for an adventure. It's worth just paying for parking on the street. Service? Omg, I hate to call out on people like this, but we had the same guy who's worked at the poorly reviewed Oakville location. Sorry man, but serving people is not your calling... He looks like and sort of acts like Robb Wells (Ricky) from Trailer Park Boys... He is probably the reason I'd never go back to this location or the Oakville one."}
{"text":"It's simple, if you want the best dessert in a 20km radius, this is the place. Have been going here for years with my girlfriend, now wife, and now with baby also. You will have a completely different experience here as opposed to the other locations nearby."}
{"text":"My friends and I came by here on a friday night and it was fairly busy, but there was only one server. We were seated after a few minutes but waited 20 minutes before the server came around to take our orders. We only had another half hour before we had to head out, which we didn't think would be an issue since all we ordered were two slices of cake (that were already pre-cut and sitting in the display case) and a milkshake. The first slice came out 10 minutes later, so I asked her for a take-out container and the bill. She offered to put the rest of our order in take-out containers as well, which we gladly accepted. A few minutes later she brought out the rest of our order, except my friends milkshake was not the one she had ordered. She had never ordered it before but it didn't look like cookies and cream (it was yellow) so she asked the server to confirm, and she said yes. A few seconds later she came back and realized she had given her the wrong milkshake, just as my friend went in for a sip. She told our server that she had tried to take a sip of it, though she hadn't actually tried it yet. I guess our server took this as an okay to give the drink to the person who actually ordered it, because we later watched her and another girl behind the counter SWAP THE STRAWS and bring it out to another table. That's pretty unhygienic and I feel like anyone who's ever worked in food service knows that once that food is out of your sight, you do not give it to another person.  So we waited another 10 minutes for a new milkshake to come out (during this time we paid our bills), though we saw it sitting on the counter in a glass cup ready to go 5 minutes before it was brought to us. When it finally arrived, we asked our server to put it into a take-out cup (like the first one) and received a glare from the girl behind the counter. The overall experience was bad and honestly a bit stressful which is the last thing you want when you go somewhere to relax and eat cake! This also isn't the first time that we've received poor service from this specific location over the few years it's been open, so I think there's a real issue with management and staffing here."}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE! My BF and I began coming here frequently, everything we've tried so far is so tasty! He especially enjoys the waffles and smoothie, while I'm more of a crepe person. Both were absolutely mouth watering just from the smell!! The interior is very comfy and relaxing, the one thing I don't like though is sofa seats. I feel as though everyone sits elbow to elbow and gives me a bit of social anxiety. but other than that it's perfect for some dessert."}
{"text":"Wow... their waffle is so big!! I don't know if this picture can show how big it is because the pecan nut tart that my friend ordered which you can see behind the waffle is also big. Lol I definitely recommend this strawberry vanilla ice cream waffle to everybody! The waffle was crunchy outside and fluffy inside... it is the perfect work. I've had a lot of so-so waffle, which were sometimes a bit raw inside or like a store-bought frozen waffle, but this one is the best! Even though it has ice cream on top, it didn't get badly soggy, and the quality of every ingredient was so good.  I changed the strawberry sauce to chocolate sauce, and this tuned out a really nice combination too. The chocolate sauce on top of the ice cream was crunchy, and that added a nice texture. I will come back again for the waffle!"}
{"text":"I've always loved loved loved Demetres! Ever since my high school days!  You have a crazy selection of desserts so it's great depending on how hungry you or how much of a sweet tooth you've got. You can get something as complex as ice cream with crepes/waffles with brownie pieces and syrup or something as simple as a milkshake.   Personal history: I've previously tried the Tongue Depressor (from what I can remember, it's basically all the goodness I previously mentioned but it is pretty big so prepare your stomach), Nutella milkshake (yummy) and One Smart Cookie (I think that's the name! Basically chocolate/Nutella ice cream sandwiched between two chocolate chip cookies and resting on Nutella spread....SO good!  The service is usually very quick but it can depend on how busy they are. When I had the cookie, they were pretty busy so I waited quite a bit for my dessert but overall, I'd say their timing is pretty reasonable.   It's a good sized venue so you've got tables and chairs or booths and the interior design is quite lovely. One thing I absolutely love about them is their creativity with naming their desserts! Take a trip there and see for yourself :)   Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"This review is for the recently opened location near Square One.   My friend and I gave Caffe Demetre across from Kariya Park a visit. It had just recently opened, and at 7:30 pm on a Sunday night it was quite busy. Lots of couples seated by the windowside with 2 or 3 large groups sitting in the circular seats or otherwise.   The food at Caffe Demetre has always been consistent. We got a waffle with chocolate ice cream, brownies, white chocolate sauce and strawberries. It was, as always, delicious and aesthetically pleasing.   This review is not about the quality of food. This review is about the quality of service. The service at this Demetres is, to put it short, terribly awful. Especially when it comes to certain times of the afternoon.  Since arriving there, we were not given waters for over 15 minutes. Our server told us that he would be right back to take our orders, which took another 10 minutes or so. He was busy delivering plates upon plates of desserts to waiting patrons. When the server finally came around to take our orders, he scribbled the order so hard on the dining table that it shook - his entire demeanour was that of a rushed, headless chicken.   He yelled across the dining area to the cooks (the cooks work out of an exposed kitchen), having entire conversations with them over the eating diners. He muttered swear words under his breath every time he went to use the cash register, mumble-repeating orders back to himself over and over. Since we were seated RIGHT NEXT TO the cash register, this was very distracting and not pleasant at all.   When time came for the bill, he printed it out and tossed it on our table - \"sorry we don't have trays,\" he said as he rushed off to seat more patrons. At one point he even offered an unemptied, unclean table to two customers and practically sprinted around the establishment you could see the dust rise from the floor.  At the end of the meal, we asked if he was the only person working here. No, he said. There's one other girl, but she's new and doesn't know what she's doing just yet. There were only two servers to serve the entire restaurant on a busy Sunday night.   Dear Demetre, please stop understaffing your establishments. I don't know if this goes for any other location (the one at Courtneypark doesn't seem to suffer from the same problem), but it sure is a major issue for this location. If I wanted bad customer service with my dessert, I wouldn't have gone out to begin with."}
{"text":"Plus:  Good location Big menu, a lot of choices Quick service Funny names in the menu Open late  Minus:  Some ice creams and waffles etc are just way too sweet and portions too big (share with a friend!) Ambiance a bit sterile A little overpriced I feel bad physically and mentally after eating that huge a pile of something that sweet and fatty That is why I can't see myself going there again anytime soon. Just too much! At least for my taste."}
{"text":"Food 5/5 It's my first time at this location and I have to say that their portions are quite large. Me and a friend came in at 8 PM on a weekday and it was pretty packed. Everything was up to par comparing to their other chains.   Service 4.5/5 The waitress was patient and helpful. Even though there were quite a few tables they were able to get our desserts out in a decent amount of time. And they made their waffles cones fresh on the spot.   Decor 4/5 The decor is the same elsewhere. Nothing too, too special. However, it did feel more spacious than some of their other chains."}
{"text":"Really nice place to hang out with friends. I've been here a couple times whenever I was nearby. A couple times when it wasn't too busy (around noon) and a maybe once or twice when it was really busy (around night). Their customer service is pretty good. The waitresses are really friendly but sometimes too quiet and shy, it feels awkward ordering. Their desserts are really well plated and obviously everyone loves to take pictures! Their menu is also really creative and nice. I ordered milkshakes from them a couple times and every single they were warm so I ended up just thinking that their milkshakes aren't supposed to be cold. But twice I've caught my drink just on the stand for about 10 minutes while the waitress wasn't busy. So maybe that's why my drinks were served warm? Because they were served 10 minutes later than they should've been? But their waffles are delicious and I want to acknowledge those in the kitchen because they usually aren't acknowledged since they are behind the counter not seen. Their desserts are really expensive though but I was expecting that. The cheapest is probably a milkshake for about $8? My food is usually good and besides the warm milkshake problem, the only other concern I have is the customer service. It's excellent but sometimes the waiters take too long to take our order. I understand if it's a busy night but when it's just my table along with maybe 1 other, I don't expect to wait around 20 minutes with our menus closed (which indicated we're ready to order) to get our orders taken. But I think that was only a few of their employees. The rest were well. Overall, it's a nice hangout place with friends and family but not an everyday hangout place. The food is delicious but I feel like if I eat too much, I'll get sick of it and might throw up."}
{"text":"Okay, I seriously love demetres and their ice cream. Normally I would understand if my order takes long or that I don't get a full service because they are always super busy. However, the amount of times I have been to this location it has never been busy! The location is amazing since it's so close to square one and you can just walk here. However, the first time I came here there was no one and there was only one person working. Yes, he was the waiter and he was preparing our ice cream (he was sleeping until we woke him up when we walked in.. and they were out of so many ingredients) Then the second time, the girl that was working took ages to come get our order and was pretty rude and blamed me when she got my order wrong!? And took ages to get all of our orders. Then also took at least half an hour to get our bills. She was yet rude again when we were paying and gave little tips :| I seriously wish the service would be better so I can come here more often!!!"}
{"text":"Very disappointing! The ice cream was too sweet to eat. I could only eat one third a scoop. It didn't taste that good either.  The staff were not friendly at all.  Not a good experience.  I won't go back!"}
{"text":"This location I find very crowded if you're seated on the benches. Uncomfortably close to other guests. The service here was pretty poor. Our waitress literally forgot about us. Otherwise food is good. Wish they had some lactose-free options"}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday evening.  It's not busy at all.  Staff did not greet upon entering.  They were chit chatting. Finally one decided to come up and sit us down. We weren't served water until we asked for it (that's after we were half way done with our dessert.) the ice cream they served was like shaved ice texture. It was frozen and flaky. How could you serve that and call it ice cream? If I wanted shaved ice I have better places to go to.  Usually this place brings smiles to the patrons but today I felt they let us down big time. Up your game,  staff at this location."}
{"text":"Great spot for dessert, especially now with their revamped menu - very cute and creative with the pop culture references but also brings new flavours and menu items after years of the same stuff.  I love going here after dinner or whenever I just want to have a nice sweet treat.  The servers are friendly and I don't feel rushed.  It can get a noisy at night because of the open concept design of the space but clearly it's popular.  It would make for a nice date spot; tables are best for just two, but bear in mind that you sit in close proximity to your fellow dessert seekers.  The desserts are truly decadent.  The cakes are OK, nothing too different from other dessert spots in the city, but their house-made ice cream selections and toppings are just divine.  I'm a huge fan of their sundaes (big enough to share) and their crepes.  Keep up the great job!"}
{"text":"I had \"The Last Straw\" Belgian waffle which was pretty darn awesome .  Warm waffle with vanilla ice cream strawberry compote, fresh strawberries, and whipped cream. Paired with a great cup of coffee it made for a very enjoyable desert experience. The only issue is their prices are on the high side for a desert only experience so you feel you didn't fully get value for your dollar."}
{"text":"Music is insanely loud. After asking nicely to turn it down, they had purposely increased clubbing music.  Second, ingredients are cheap after management changed."}
{"text":"I cannot even begin to comment on how ridiculously AWESOME this place is! I came here with my 4-yr-old niece and cousin on 06/29/2014 and we were greeted with such welcoming smiles. The menu is huge and not of a child's portion! I ordered the La Vida Mocha and it was huge! for the price you pay, you could share this with another person.  The service was quick & the atmosphere was upbeat. Maybe not the best for a crazy 4-yr-old girl as she enjoyed running around all over the place after having her sundae"}
{"text":"As long as you stay away from their ice-cream (which is only good coupled with their cake), you'll have a golden experience. The chocolate fudge cake is TO DIE FOR. I would recommend any of their chocolate-oriented menu items."}
{"text":"WORST service ever!!! Waited almost 45 minutes for our dessert and we didnt even get served by a server!! Never coming back ever again!!!"}
{"text":"Horrible location. From the moment I walked in the door, I was not welcomed. The staff are miserable and make your experience there horrible.  Here's what happened during my stay here: 1) When we walked in, the staff just stared at us as if it was so awful that they had more customers. We stood there awkwardly like animals in a zoo until a host seated us.   2) The table we sat at wasn't clean. We asked them to wipe it down or move to a clean table. but as I said this I looked around and realized all the tables are dirty. They only seem to wipe it down when they seat a table there. It wasn't appetizing at all.  3) They brought us 2 glasses of water. No ice isn't nice, but that's what we got. The cups smelt HORRIBLE. As if they were hanging out in the washroom. Again, not appetizing.  4) We asked for 2 cappuccinos and a crepe. The crepe was ready before the cappuccino. I don't know about you, but I like to drink my cappuccinos while I'm eating something sweet. Not after. Clearly they need better coordination between the barista and the dessert crew.  5) As we finished, we sat there looking around for our waitress who was nowhere to be found. I walked to the washroom while we were waiting to get the bill and noticed her standing in the back laughing with her colleagues. We had a movie to catch so I wasn't impressed. Normally waiters do a table check but she never asked us how things were or if we needed anything else. For a slow Sunday evening I would expect better service.  6) I've also seen the owner yell at children. He is a disgruntled man who hates children being in his restaurant. There was a large party of 20 people with a few children sitting across from me. A few of these children had menus and were looking at them. He went over and took it out of their hands so viciously and said it wasn't for them. How RUDE. If those were my children, I would have walked out of there and taken my crew of 20 people with me.  7) Finally, we got a hold of one of the waiters and asked if they could get our server. This took another few minutes. Finally, she came by and asked how everything was. A little late if you ask me. I told her it was good, as I didn't want to be confrontational at that point. I told her we were in a rush and needed to catch a movie. She told us she would be right back with the bill, which took another few minutes. My husband paid the bill and left a generous tip despite the horrid service. She told us not to worry about being late for the movie because of the trailers. First off.. not her place at all to say such a thing since she should be apologizing for being the cause of the lateness. Second of all, some people LIKE the trailers."}
{"text":"As a coffee lover, this is definitely one of the best place to go. This coffee house is so cozy. And the cheesecake is amazing.   Only downside of this place is that the food served a little bit slow."}
{"text":"I am a regular here. The waffles are very good, but the crepes could be improved. Love the decor and the plating.."}
{"text":"Had the Moo la la on a waffle. If you are looking for a mass sugar rush or want to eat your feelings this place will definitely help you. Also recommend the crepes and the cappuccino.  Small place when we went it was packed but would return when I have my next dessert craving"}
{"text":"Bought a Spilt Banana and along came pieces of glass in it! I first thought it was a piece of hard candy which I couldn't bite and swallowed it and then after my husband bit into couple of more pieces in it. Worst terrifying experience....  I'm unable to sleep now thanks to this and hope they discard all the ice cream in this place and investigate.  I'm praying that nothing serious happens to us now! I don't think I can ever step into another Cafe Demetres again.  Horrible experience."}
{"text":"Went there during a busy time, i.e.Taste of Danforth. Despite being so busy, we received friendly service with prompt delivery of our desserts. Our table of 4 ordered one cake+ice cream, one waffle+ice cream, one ice cream and one ice cream cookie.   The experience was great with my first timer friends overestimating their ability to consume a full serving of dessert. I enjoyed laughing at them and seeing them succumb to getting a take away box. In everyone's case, the ice cream was delicious and the added milk Belgian chocolate was amazing. The cookies were hard enough to cut but soft enough to chew without difficulty.   Being able to give great service during a busy period is a true mark of a restaurant and worthy of leaving tips. I will return for more!"}
{"text":"This place was in my to-visit list and I finally got the chance to visit. We went during the evening (this place was open till 11:30pm) and though the parking lot situation was strange (i.e.further parking), the bright lights inside invited us in. We got ourselves a booth and were promptly given the hilarious menus. The menu is full of puns and movie references such as \"Perks and Recreation\", \"Summertime Fatness\" or \"Game of Cones\". I appreciate that. The menu is large and the variety is pretty admirable albeit a tad on the pricey side. The menu basically boils down to: -Do you want cake?  -Do you want ice-cream?  -Do you want cake + ice-cream?  -Do you want crepe or waffle?  -Do want something to drink?   I chose the Belgium milk chocolate macchiato and a piece of chocolate fudge cake while my friend chose a two scoop brownie sundae. The macchiato was nice and warm with the Belgium chocolate drizzled upon the whipped cream, making for a delectable treat for the senses. The sweetness was not overpowering and you could enjoy the coffee taste within. The cake was decent (I mean it's LaRocca), but again the Belgium chocolate drizzle brought the magic home. My friend enjoyed his sundae and said that the portion was large enough for two people (so am FYI if you have a bird stomach). The waitressing was a little strange with two of them serving our table (perhaps one was in training),however both were pleasant staff and made our experience solid with some good customer service. Will return."}
{"text":"This is the Ajax location off of consumer way and was a quick stop for my brother and I on our journey towards Eastern Ontario. After a few minutes of contemplating buying all chocolates, we both decided on getting waffles dishes with ice cream. I got the Robert Brownie Jr. (I know), which was a vanilla ice cream with hazelnut and praline atop a freshly made waffle, drizzled with Belgian milk chocolate sauce and garnished with flavourful Brownie bits.   Overall, amazing! Too much sugar, but hey, I knew what I was getting myself into.   Note: the portion sizes are large so if you aren't really a sugar connoisseur, consider sharing with someone else."}
{"text":"I love this place. But at times the customer service is really bad like one time i orderd a crape and the woman brought me a waffle. I didn't want to complain so when my fork accidentally dropped on the floor, I asked if I could get a new one and she never brought me one. When i asked for some water it took way to long. Other then that the desserts were amazing and plated beautifully."}
{"text":"From what I heard from this place from my friend, the desserts were fantastic and the coffee was pretty good. Well, a few weeks ago my friend's birthday was coming up and we wanted to have a small get together of friends here so we made a reservation. The person that we were speaking to while making this reservation wanted to know how much money we were going to be spending and started to demand that everyone who will be attending WILL be buying. What kind of establishment DEMANDS for their people to buy? I would understand if a large group of people came in and didn't buy anything, but you cannot force customers to buy things, or even EXPECT people to tell you how much they will be buying. So as my friend finishes the reservation by telling them who is buying and who isn't, they conclude by saying that people who are not buying must pay $12 each just to sit there. We canceled our reservations and will be having her party elsewhere. I do not know who these people think they are, but they will not be receiving business from me or my friends, regardless of how good their food is. This place needs a reality check on proper service."}
{"text":"Perfect desserts, awful service every time. No offence to the servers but there is only one server for the whole place!!! To me that's being very cheap of management."}
{"text":"This is an amazing location! It always empty and we have enough time and space to enjoy our desserts! The staff and service and very quick and amazing. Tongue depressor on a waffle is a must try! And also sub zero latte and stormy weather frappe."}
{"text":"I come here all the time. I just decided to review this location specifically because the service is absolutely terrible.   After walking in and waiting 5 minutes to be acknowledged we were seated. We then waited another 10 minutes and no server had greeted us, after flagging someone down they took our order. I ordered a slice of red velvet cheesecake and a coffee, because I have a nut allergy I decided it was safest to stay away from the other desserts especially cause the cakes are La Rocca and I've eaten them before.   Our desserts came before our beverages. We had to flag someone down for some water. Waters came and i was still waiting for coffee. Now this is a regular cup of joe, no espresso machine necessary. My coffee finally came, it was cold and to my delight there was a almond biscotti with it! Hi! I'm allergic to nuts. I told the server and she did not apologize just simply said \"oh right, so you don't want it?\" She didn't even offer me a different cup. This was one occasion with the whole biscotti fiasco, I let it slide a couple times, but this exact situation actually happened to me 3 consecutive times at this location. The last time it happened I asked our sever to speak to the manager cause it's a little out of hand that they really have absolutely no allergy awareness. SHE WAS THE MANAGER. Ahahahahha I will never visit again. So unprofessional it blew my mind.   Desserts are absolutely delicious, although I usually know what to except being a franchise restaurant- fellow yelpers with allergies: beware and avoid this place, if you want to live!"}
{"text":"The desserts are beyond amazing. Love the puns in the dessert names! I liked going when the store just opens because its a nice quiet space. Overall, very tasty desserts and I will probably go back"}
{"text":"Do yourself a favour and get the cheesecake with caramelized banannas and nutella. Its expensive but worth it. Disadvantage: no hot fudge"}
{"text":"This place is overrated! unfriendly staff. mediocre waffles, and the price is severely inflated! save your money and have dessert elsewhere."}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever! We waited for the server as she was just texting away. When we called her over she continued to text and ignored us. Brampton location is so much better! Go to Brampton for a better experience."}
{"text":"The new York style cheesecake with strawberries is the best. It is 100 times better than The Cheesecake Factory' classic NY cheesecake."}
{"text":"I went to the new Demetre's at Kariya Park. I usually go to the one at AMC theatres but decided to give this a try. It was the worse experience I've had at any restaurant or cafe!   My group of 3 were seated fairly quickly by the hostess after she cleaned a table for us. It was a pretty busy night with only 1 waitress. We had a movie to catch 1.5 hours later, so we thought we had enough time to eat and catch up. We thought wrong! The waitress took our order 10 minutes in. She never brought any water. We ordered a crepe and waffle and 3 regular teas. This place has the worst customer service, and the laziest, most uncaring employees I've seen in any establishment. The waitress kept standing around, talking to other employees. There were dishes sitting on the counter (with ice cream) for 15-20 minutes before she delivered them. We kept waiting for our desserts, or even the tea. And waiting, and waiting...  After 1 hour, I went up to the waitress (because she never came to our table once) and told her we have a movie to catch in 30 min and how long the food would take. She said she would check on it. She came after 15 min with 3 loose teas. It wasn't what we ordered, but she left before we could say anything. There were no spoons, and there was no sugar on the table. After another 10 min, we decided to leave. I went up to the waitress and told her to cancel the order because we were leaving. She asked if we were paying for the teas, I told her no. Told her there was no sugar, or spoons and we couldn't drink them. She said \"ok\".   We left furious. We went there to have a good time, and we left hungry and angry. We waisted an hour and a half of our time, and ruined the rest of the evening. I will never go to this location ever again, and I highly recommend everyone to go to another Demetre's."}
{"text":"this is our dessert spot only ever had DIY crepes  -one scoop white chocolate ice cream -strawberry and bananas -hazelnut chocolate syrup  serving size is perfect for a couple"}
{"text":"If you have a sweet tooth, then this is the place for you! My friends and I have been here a couple times together when we were craving desserts. The place isn't too big, so on weekends, we had to wait around 15-20 minutes to be seated. Even on a week night, the place was still fairly busy although we were seated right away. Both times the waiters have been nice, although they are busy running back and forth, so you'll have to flag them down if you want something.  Menu-wise, there is quite a wide selection to choose from: crepes, waffles, sundaes, cakes, to ice creams etc. I had customized my crepe last time, but this time I decided to try the \"Splitsonian\" waffle. The waffle itself was fresh, with a giant scoop of honey vanilla ice cream in the middle, surrounded by slices of strawberries and banana, and finished with a drizzle of Nutella all over. Definitely satisfied my craving. The portion sizes are generous enough to share between two people (although it's so good that deciding to share will be a hard choice). Will definitely visit again when I'm craving desserts."}
{"text":"This place is very overhyped imo. The food is expensive and tastes average at best. As a brome student, I was very reluctant to spend $15  on cheesecake...but I assumes the portions would be big, but noooope.  I was given 1 slice of cake with a little bit of coolie smeared onto the place. And I couldnt even enjoy the cake as  it was too dense and too sweet for my liking, so my brother had to finish it just so we didnt waste the money. Definitely won't be visiting again.   The only reason I'm giving it 2 stars are cause of the fantastic waitstaff (which seems to be against the norm for this place) and the cute names given to the desserts."}
{"text":"This place is located just right off the hwy 404 on hwy 7. Haven't been here in a while. The menu has been redisigned and it's better and funnier. I had the tongue depressor which I usually get.  My friends tried the cookie and waffle and we all enjoyed our food however the service was very slow. We had to chase down people just to pay 20 minutes after we finished our meals."}
{"text":"After visiting this place, I will most certainly not be coming back. I'm not sure if all locations are this poorly managed, but the service and staff here are the worst I've ever come across. Firstly, it took them 15 minutes to take our order or even bring us water.we ordered crepes, something which can be made easily and quickly. Yet for some reason this took half an hour, and people who's food was ready after ours(ours sat on the counter waiting) was served first. My crepe might as well have been from the morning, because it was cold when I received it. In addition to this, the waitress kept wiping her nose/snot on her hands -I saw her do this at least 3 times before serving the food. When our food was ready we watched the staff-all of them- lean against the counters standing there talking and laughing. After receiving my cold unappetizing crepe they never even came back to ask how it was. In addition to all of this, the water also tasted like chlorine, so we couldn't even drink it. This experience was so upsetting I created a yelp account just to review this place. The food is over priced, below average tasting, and the customer service is non existent. The crepes at Vaughan Mills are 100% better than these and you can get them for less, and in 1/4 of the time. Save your time and money!! I will never return to a Demetres after this."}
{"text":"One of the best desert places ever created -- this is a definite must visit! My favourite is the Belgian Waffle with fudge brownies, chocolate sauce, vanilla ice cream, and whipped dream...so good!"}
{"text":"Service is fine. Turned off by kid making and topping crepes with his bare hands and no hair net and that too in plain sight of customers.  The order is usually off somehow; crepes/waffles cold, ice cream melted and puddling on top, etc.  Management really needs to watch the slipping quality."}
{"text":"Worse service ever! We were a group of 4 & looking forward to having dessert all week. We even looked up the menu online before so we knew exactly what we were ordering. Our server Dante yawns when he comes to our table. I guess he was up late the night before or just bored of his job. He took our orders which consists of 1 bread pudding, 1 coco ono - we changed the honey vanilla ice cream to chocolate, 1 splitsonia - also asked to change the honey vanilla ice cream to chocolate & 2 teas 1 mocha. He read the order back to us & we said it was correct.  Dante came back out & apologized as they were out of bread pudding. He started naming out other items on the menu. I had to ask for the menu so we can see exactly what to order. We asked for the tongue depressor. Someone else came out a few minutes later and told us there was no more brownies for the tongue depressor. We told him about that we also ordered the bread pudding and was told that it was also not available. He advised us that the bread pudding has been out for a couple of weeks as their supplier has not brought them any. So why didn't our first waiter Dante tell us this in the first place?? We asked to just put strawberries instead. We get the coco ono with VANILLA ice cream instead of the chocolate and the tongue depresser with strawberries. We called Dante over and asked him to change the ice cream to chocolate. He then argues with us and says we did not ask for chocolate ice cream. He then checks his notes & sees that we did in fact change the ice cream flavor. I simply advised him that he should not argue with a customer & that he should have advised us that there was no bread pudding from the start. He said no one told him. We left it at that not wanting to keep him from his other customers. After we shared the coco ono & tongue depresser we advised him that we had not received the spitsonia and 1 tea. We asked him to cancel it and take it off our bill. He apologized and asked if it was 1 bill or split. We said 1 bill. He repeated 1 bill but came back with 2 bills. I then asked to speak with the manager. I explained to the manager everything that happened. He apologized and offered us all a piece of cake to take home. We were not looking for a freebie, but very much appreciated, but rather someone to train Dante better."}
{"text":"Love this location! They are always packed but get you seated as soon as they can. The portions are huge and their desserts are amazing. Very delicious!!! Been going to this location for years, best Demetres location!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing sweets! Had the brownie cheesecake with vanilla ice cream and whipped cream... Amazing! Very upbeat environment with great staff! Definitely worth the stop when you're in Greektown!"}
{"text":"I've been to this place several times and went yesterday and it never disappoints!   The service is great. The waiters and waitresses are really friendly.  I noticed that they have a new menu now. I'm sure everything is the same but just a new design.  I ordered the Applause which is basically just the pomme pilot without the ice cream.   My sister ordered the tongue depressor but replaced the white buttons for strawberries.  I really like how you can switch up the toppings so you can accommodate it to your needs lol.  This time I ordered drinks which I never do. I ordered the stormy weather which was so good! Kinda taste like a frappucino from Starbucks.  My sister ordered the OC which is an Oreo milkshake and it's great for chocolate lovers.  Our waitress was amazing and the food was served with such beautiful presentations!  Will be back soon."}
{"text":"On a cold winter's night, I head over here with my cousins and am greeted by the warm sounds of chatter and the sweet smell of the tantalizing desserts that are the specialty of Caffe Demetre. Maybe a little of a dramatic introduction, but hey, I was cold and needed food and warmth.  First off, the menu here is pretty overwhelming. I could not decide what to order because everything sounded so good. We ended up sharing a large, strawberry and sugar coated Belgian Waffle, and on the side, I ordered a frozen hot chocolate. Everything was delicious and provided an ailment for my raving sweet tooth. Definitely coming back for more."}
{"text":"I'm well aware that this restaurant is busy, however that doesn't excuse our server from ensuring that we were taken care of.   My friend had ordered a crepe, however received a waffle (0.95 cent price difference, but that's besides the point, he wanted a crepe... NOT a waffle). When he pointed it out to the server, she insisted she got the order right, followed by a bunch of \"I don't know's\" and, \"this is what I had written down.\" OK lady, the least you could do is offer to see if there was anything you could do to fix the situation.  Luckily for her, he let it go and said it was fine after SHE gave US a hard time. But seriously?   Can't even remember her name cause she spoke so quietly. But I can tell you for sure that this was not acceptable. The least this establishment can do (especially since it's not likely that service will always be consistent since it's SO busy) is ensure that the servers they hire are committed to providing their best service in a courteous manner.  Not impressed."}
{"text":"K"}
{"text":"Worst service ever. Our waitress brought the wrong drinks and when we told her she asked what we wanted her to do about it. When she brought the corrected drinks to the table she proceeded to insist that the original drinks were correct. Not worth the trip. We didn't go expecting attitude from the server."}
{"text":"I went here with a friend after I had a not so great experience at the Whitby location. I ordered the same food (waffle with fresh fruit and a hot chocolate) and it was identical to the one received in whitby. The hot chocolate was luke-warm and the waffle was good but tasted like the batter was out of a box. I definitely didn't think it was worth the price.   After trying the two locations, I don't think I would come back. The customer service was definitely way better at this location and they were friendly. I was surprised that they didn't ask us how the food was but it was busy so I kinda understand."}
{"text":"I went here with a friend and they seriously have such big portions. If I didn't love sugar as much as I do, I would absolutely share a dish. They are great for groups and dates! The staff took a long time to come to our table, we waiting 15minutes before we even got menus or asked if we wanted a drink. There was no one that greated us at the door, we just waited around and when no one came we just sat down where there were seats.   I got a hot chocolate and waffles with fresh fruit. It was good, the waffle tasted like it was frozen and than warmed up or maybe a box-batter. You seriously can't go wrong with whipped cream and strawberries. Their hot chocolate was more luke-warm than hot. I love my beverages steaming opposed to room temperature. It took another 20min for the person to come back to our table to see how we were so I couldn't ask for it to be warmed up more. If it was hot, I'm sure it would be delicious.   I don't think I would go to this location again since I was not happy, however, I would definitely go to the same restaurant chain again probably in Toronto."}
{"text":"Very tasty. I had an item with ice cream in a cone with strawberries... delicious. The only downside is the overly confusing menu. It is large, hard to understand and just bad. The waitress must have been new because she had no clue what was going on either."}
{"text":"I honestly love the demetres chain. First time coming to this location... Not. Impressed.   No sign of hostess for a good 10 minutes. However we were seated rather quickly once the hostess attended to us.   Ordered the Tongue Depressor today. Let me tell you, more like tongue depressing. My crepe was drowning in chocolate sauce. Way too many brownie bites and they used regular chocolate ice cream. Overall just a disaster.   I have had this before at a different location and it was perfect. Not sure what happened here but I definitely will not come to this location again. I am not paying close to $20 for something I can't even finish because it is way too sweet."}
{"text":"I really like this place they have great deserts. It's kind of expensive, but it's worth it. The positions are very big. Cr√™pe  are a dollar cheaper than waffles.     This location has easy parking. It's very loud and busy. You have to wait a little to get your table, but you can call in and reserve a table."}
{"text":"We visited the Mississauga location yesterday and totally regret that decision. The location is in the middle of a busy area with restaurants, a movie theatre, and putting edge near by and you only had one waitress working there on a Saturday afternoon. I don't know who thought that through, there was no way for us to get good service with one stressed out waitress doing a 2 or even 3 person job. She didn't even have a hostess to seat people or help out. What could have been a 20 minute visit took us the better part of an hour. After trying to flag down our waitress for 20 minutes (with our coats already on and she would see us but just avoid eye contact and ignore us due to her insane workload) to get our bill we left. We never got our bill, we put more than enough cash on the table including more tip than we should have and tried to flag her down to tell her before we left but again got ignored. Until we were halfway back to our car and she frantically ran after us because she thought we had left without paying (so clearly didn't even glance at the table where there was a pile of cash). I can't believe we actually paid for that experience, we just wanted to grab some already overpriced ice cream before we had to head to a family event and we had an hour of being ignored by our waitress and listening to loitering teenage girls (who were already finished when we got there and we still left before they paid). But as a former waitress, I can't believe an establishment in that kind of area has any sort management that would put a waitress in that position. Of course she is not going to be able to be a decent server when she's stretched past her limit because some manager wanted to save a couple bucks by not scheduling a second waitress. It might save you the minimum wage now, but if you can't have the foresight to realize terrible service will lose you more customers and more revenue in the long run then you have no business running that location. And I don't think we are the only ones who got frustrated and won't return again."}
{"text":"Excellent service, creative desserts, huge menu. What more could one want?"}
{"text":"The best crepes I've had in my life!  Chewy and delicious and topped with fruits and ice cream. Service can be a little slow, as its always busy here (esp. in the evenings), but the servers are friendly, and the crepes are so delicious, it makes the wait worth it. Demetre's is the perfect date night. Yum!"}
{"text":"Best dessert restaurant. I usually get the waffle or crepe dessert and they're always amazing. Just beware of the portion size; They're pretty big so you may need to share. The milkshakes are awesome, especially the  shake and awe (Nutella) milkshake!!"}
{"text":"I like coming here to chill with some friends for late night coffee on the weekend. Normally get the Americano double. Dessert wise I've had the Black & Tan and the Mochahotas. Both are chocolate decadent. Waiting for a table for large groups can take a while. They won't sit you unless your whole party is there. Other than that the service is great. Our waitress was courteous and took care of us through out the night."}
{"text":"Demetre's is more of a nostalgic thing for me. We like to go there because it's small and cute and well... there's desserts. Any place that feeds me chocolate, and sugar, and caramel, and ice-cream, and..  - you get the point - is A-OK in my books.  As Steph pointed out below though, the food isn't that special. If you want a good waffle you're better off going down to Spin. If you want cake or ice-cream, Demetre's will do."}
{"text":"well waffles are delicious but service is not tha great first time i go there, even they have empty 2 person tables they said i cant sit there . so i had the sit at bar. very uncomfortable. and while i there nobody sit table. i could have sit. so 2 star and that because waffle. thats it"}
{"text":"I'm never going back to Caf√© Demetre again.   I've visited Cafe Demetre at this location a couple of times. Their menu looked exciting and they have a variety of things. However, once I got my order, I realized that the desserts were okay and nothing great.  The service was almost non-existent while I was there and the staff always looked bored or displeased about something. I also thought that most of the stuff on menu is so overpriced for what it is, it's pretty disappointing. I did not feel comfortable being there and I do not plan on returning again.   This place is a waste of time and money!"}
{"text":"If you're in high school, you've never been to a dessert place, or you happen to like overpriced store bought cheesecake, you'll love Demetre's For everyone else..... There are other restaurants.   Demetre's is the equivalent to old reliable.   I'm sure the only reason this is still around is because there and no other real dessert places in markham uff.   The waffles and crepes are great. And I did used to come here often. It was a staple for dessert amongst my friends and I but at the end of the day its really nothing special and it's quite overpriced. How can you really mess up a crepe or waffle when you can load it up with caramel, white chocolate, strawberries, whip creme, brownies, ect. The ice cream is fantastic though. I've also had the cheesecake and apple pie and they were nothing special. I found the brownie cheesecake rather unpalatable actually.   Anyway try it once, try it twice, try it as many time as you like but its still just overpriced waffles and crepes. Will you be satisfied? Yes. Will you crave the delicious flavors and long to return for another bite? Unlikely."}
{"text":"I love the food here, cannot go wrong.  Service? Horrible.  I was there Saturday March 12th at 4:15 pm.  I walked in and the hostess came from the back, TEXTING, asked me how many, took me to my table... PHONE STILL IN HAND... THREW the menus on the table (she was also a good 5 feet in front of me) and walked away.  Every time I saw her after, that damn phone was in her hand.  I am 23 years old, and I am bad with my phone as most of us are these days.  But at work, in front of customers, unacceptable.  I have worked in grocery stores and restaurants and that was forbidden when in the sight of a guest.  Not impressed at all."}
{"text":"This location is one of the few late night sweet tooth options within walking distance for me (the others being a Slurpee at 7/Eleven or an overpriced candy binge at Sugar Mountain). It's not fancy and it can get pretty crowded and loud on the weekends, but it does the trick in a pinch.  Skip the pre-made desserts (despite their fun movie-themed names) and look on the back flap of the menu for the build-your-own options. The prices are identical and you get the same number of ingredients but in your exact specifications.   Oh, but don't try and view the \"menu\" options on their \"waycoolcafe.com\" website or you'll get a 2 second dizzying, blurry, flash view of the menu before it disappears and a generic list of \"highlights\" (\"15 fancy sundaes\") takes its place. Click on the \"Why can't I see inside your menu\" link and you get a disclaimer about \"world wide internet piracy\" giving them \"no alternative\" but to limit access to the actual menu. C'mon Demetres, get over yourself a little bit."}
{"text":"Weird picture on the menus but very yummy treats! Needs more seating/more branches or both because this place can get very packed!! Service from servers' is great, nice, polite and pays attention."}
{"text":"Not sure how Cafe Demetre works.. is it a franchise with standardized menus, ingredients and cooking process?   Used to go to the one Near 404 and Hwy 7 alot. but seating sometimes can be limited, so I decided to go to this one with more seating...   The whole dining experience is below par.. compared to the one at 404 and Hwy 7  The waffle size is such a pity.. (got a major downsize from what I had before!) Service was terrible, no one is offering you water and attend you for 10 minutes, yes we still do not get water in the end.."}
{"text":"Delicious deserts!!! High quality Ice cream! They made a lot of changes, and now I can say it's a very good place for deserts....highly recommended!!!"}
{"text":"This is the best desert place out there! They have it all and everything is delicious! Although it is a bit dirty in there I love it and the best is the apple pie and ice cream!"}
{"text":"Pretty decent dessert restaurant! Love their menu, and their menu item names are on point!  I ordered a banana split sundae with my date... Came with three different ice creams, and pieces of bananas. It was ACTUALLY really good, much better than I thought it was going to be! It was a bit small for 2 people, but enough for a light dessert.  Service was alright, nothing out of this world, but the food and atmosphere is memorable! Definitely will be coming back! Caffe Demetre has a slight edge over Spin Desserts in my opinion, just because they've dominated the dessert table for so long.   Parking is a bit tough to find, unless you're willing to pay for it."}
{"text":"Coming here is never a wrong choice. Their desserts are fantastic! A friend and I came here a few days ago after a long day to unwind and catch up. We were greeted right away and seated. However, there seemed to be a bit of confusion because while we were taking our jackets off a lady came and asked us what we wanted to order. When we politely told her that we just sat down she looked slightly confused. We were than told by our actual server that this specific location was under new management and they were getting the hang of things.   Our server was friendly and quick to get things started for us. We ordered a caramel latte, jasmine green tea, brownie points and a life sentence on a waffle.   The brownie points consists of a slice of caramel brownie chocolate cheesecake along with a huge scoop of their chocolate ice cream with a triple fudge drizzle on top. It was delicious!   If you are a peanut butter lover, you will absolutely fall for the \"a life sentence\". Freshly made waffle with a larger than life scoop of peanut butter overload ice cream, sliced bananas, fudge brownies and triple fudge sauce drizzled on top. MMMM!!!   Just writing this review makes me want to go back for more! Overall, we had a great time. Stayed for a little bit over a couple of hours. Our server came by every so often to make sure we were doing okay. Filled up my pot with hot water without me asking. I was a happy camper! Will absolutely come here again!!!"}
{"text":"I had heard about Caffe Demetre's from friends and wanted to try it myself. So a friend of mine and I, went one weeknight. Place was not busy, so we didn't have to wait to be seated. When we opened up the menu, we were amazed at the variety of different desserts to choose from. Menu was huge! They offer waffles, sundaes, cakes, shakes, crepes, and more! I got the Moo la la on a waffle and it was delicious! Very filling! Portion was big and I could not finish it all. Two people, if they like the same dessert, could easily share one and be satisfied. Since place was not busy, we didn't have to wait long for our order to come. It's definitely a place to come back to, just probably not all the time, as it is a bit pricey. It was definitely a treat though!"}
{"text":"Where to begin. I normally go to the demetres in Woodbridge, but decided to give the one in Etobicoke a try. It was very busy when my friend and I went. We had to wait 30 min to get any acknowledgement from a hostess or server.  By the time they finally came, we had lost our spot in line. Ended up going to spin where we were acknowledge right at the door and helped quickly! Definitely won't be returning there! So disappointed."}
{"text":"The desserts here are terrible! Small, overpriced and really quite tasteless. I shared a sundae with my hubby and it was two small scoops of ice-cream, a drizzle of chocolate sauce and no whipped cream. The coffee was so bad we did not even attempt to drink it and stopped at Starbucks on the way home. Service was slow. Had to ask several times for water and milk for our coffee. Emailed the manager about our experience. He really could have cared less. Avoid this place. Small-town, hick mentality!"}
{"text":"Got a waffle with ice cream and customized it with banana and brownies with Nutella sauce.... The waffle was good the quantity of Nutella sauce good have been a little bit more but the white chocolate ice cream was delicious and the bank as we're fresh"}
{"text":"Today was a civic holiday, so perhaps that's why the service was so slow and disjointed. It took over 10 mins to have order taken and another 30 mins to get desert delivered to our table. Dessert itself was as expected, nothing to write home about, and after the long wait we were no longer hungry."}
{"text":"Honestly amazing deserts. My wife and I stopped by as we were going for a stroll. Great selection of cakes and ice cream"}
{"text":"Went here on a Friday night at 9.  It was busy but were seated fairly quickly.  Was very loud and very busy.  Probably wouldn't return any time soon."}
{"text":"I and my close friend have been many times, and trust me this is the best demetres in the town in terms of portions, services, ambience and setting.  It gets busy on weekends in evenings (15-25 minutes) but that can be understood."}
{"text":"Extremely slow service. Took forever just to get seated when there were available tables and our server did not even get to us until 10 min later. Took another 45 min for one waffle to come out and when it did, they forgot our toppings."}
{"text":"Menu is made for children, menu so crowded and staff forgot about us in a non busy time (almost half empty) , waited for 20 minutes for the bill and we went the counter to pay. Normal, coffee was really good and apple pie was good ! Little bit overpriced as we'll"}
{"text":"Complete chaos , long wait time, miss managing staff, they seemed to be trying but look inexperienced and lost.  Understaffed! felt bad for them but no way I'm coming to this place again. no place is worth almost an hour-long wait and another 30 minutes  before being served. Deserts we tried were actually good. Otherwise would have given a zero."}
{"text":"Good decoration & location. I ordered plain waffle with fruit & Nutella. The waffle is soft. Fresh fruit. The cream is really good, not greasy. Over all, it is ok. Kind of pricy."}
{"text":"The desserts are definitely fabulous (very tasty ingredients and huge portion sizes!), the wait staff was wonderful...but it was the owner or manager or whoever he is that is a real jerk. Been there on 2 separate occasions on a weeknight early in the week (such as tonight, a Monday), and shortly after we finished eating, I saw him out of the corner of my eye telling the waitress to basically \"encourage\" us to leave by clearing the table etc. And when another waitress offered to refill our water glasses, I saw him scold her for obviously making us stay longer...the joke is there were maybe 15 people in the whole place, 6 of which were OUR group of friends! Very annoying and makes me strongly consider if I'll go back there again."}
{"text":"Service was much to be desired. Granted it was busy but it took a while to get service more than understandable. The flavour were what I was most upset about.  Chocolate scoops came in cups with a slice of waffles and the only thing that tasted good was the waffles. Chocolate ice cream tasted fake as if they had mixed in some cocoa powder for extra kick, though it wasn't quite mixed in.   Price is normal for a typical dessert place but definitely not worth the price considering the taste and service."}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS UNBELIEVABLE. All their desserts looks exactly like their photos online and they taste incredible. I love that they don't really sweeten their whipped cream so it adds a nice touch to everything else that's really sweet. I got the cheesecake with the apple crumble and MAN, was it good!! I will definitely be going back there soon."}
{"text":"I feel like I've recently rediscovered my inner fatso and love for all things sweet and delicious... enter Caffe Demetre :) A fun spot with lots of sweet treats to satisfy all the picky sorts. In recent rendezvous at Demetre's I've had the following waffles: Moo La La, Hokey Pokey, and A Life Sentence. I highly recommend all three. If you like something that's not as sweet as the rest, probably go with the Hokey Pokey. And if you're a chocolate and peanut butter fan, you must try A Life Sentence. Be prepared for the sugar high that follows. Remember the portions are HUGE and best if shared... but if you can get through the whole thing on your own then you deserve a pat on the back! The service at Demetre's is pretty good. Waters were refilled without having to ask or wait and the desserts make it to the table quite quickly. Overall, if you're in the mood to (over) indulge, do stop by :)"}
{"text":"Really good crepes . Customize crepe with mil chocolate, bananas and brownies with vanilla ice cream was very good. Lots of desserts including Cheescake as a cheaper option. Will be coming again soon."}
{"text":"After long-time patronage and recent ownership change, they have lost me as a customer forever. Same great menu, but man do they skimp on portion sizes, including take out cake slices. The place was also empty on a Friday eve, 6pm. Wishing them goodbye and good luck. I don't give them more than another 6-8 months."}
{"text":"I've been there twice and didn't have a good experience. The service is horrible. The dessert (waffles & vanilla ice creme with chocolate and strawberries was good) but thats pretty much it. We waited 20 mins before someone even came and greeted us for a seat. They take your order and don't ever come back until the bill comes. The ice-creme was melted by the time it got to our table. There aren't that many dessert cafe's so they probably don't care. I recommend Symposium across the street for dessert, upscale with nice decor and excellent service and ambience."}
{"text":"Love this location. LOVE! The atmosphere is super quiet and chill, and the staff are so sweet and kind. I've never been dissapointed. Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"The Demetre franchise has significantly lost momentum in the past few and this location is the epitome of the rampant ignorance and lack of care put into the service and menu selections.  During service we were frowned upon for asking additional questions of menu items and, with the manager serving us, I expected there to be more attentiveness to my girlfriend's questions regarding the menu items and its contents. Our order was poorly receiving as there was a hair in my choice, but Demetre's \"firm policy\" states that they cannot nullify anything on their bill, rather you are offered another item at no charge. In addition, I sat through my entire experience with an empty glass of water on the table, despite my asking for a refill and tapping the glass each time any employee walked past the table.  Finally, and this is a point I'd like to drive home for any form of business where tips are to be expected, as I paid for the bill the manager/server stood directly next to me overlooking the credit machine as I entered my information. I'm of the mindset that you are to earn your tip, not have it because I've entered your establishment. After seeing that I entered $0 for a tip, the manager snarled at me and blatantly walked away from our table - they failed to see that I was leaving a cash tip, but I quickly retracted the tip and placed it back in my wallet.  A message to anyone in the restaurant business, some people like to be old school and leave a cash tip. Stop checking the bill right beside me when I've finished paying and learn some manners and respect during that portion of the service."}
{"text":"This is definitely Dessert Heaven!  However, quality of service is seriously lacking at the mississauga AMC location. The waiting staff seem to be selectively rude and thats quite a shame as customer service often tips the user experience one way or the other. That being said, the belgian waffles and warm chocolate cake have the charm to make you forget any bad CS experiences!"}
{"text":"Everything about this place was unbelievably mind boggling. Quantity of the food was great and it tasted absolutely sensational. Everyone should visit this place, you're missing out something if you don't.   Food - 10/10  Ambience - 8/10  Service - 8.5/10 Overall experience - 8.5/10   Cheers,  Sesha"}
{"text":"This is the place to go to if you want to skip dinner and go straight to desert. Demetres will most definitely fill you up (I hope). The portions are HUGE, especially for their waffles and crepes. So bring someone with you to share a plate.   I recommend everything on the menu except for the ice cream sandwiches. The cookie was SO hard and eating it was messy. The waffles/crepes are so warm when it's ready and it tastes amazing with the cold ice cream. The ice cream is very rich too.   The staff is very nice and you get you food quickly. One time on a busy night, the waitress didn't come for 15 minutes when we were ready to order. I think she forgot about us, so we left. I don't think much of this because this has happened once out of the 1000 times I've been here. The prices are good since you get a TON of desert.   It's only a few minutes walk away from Royal York station. If you're driving, you'll have to park on the side walk or behind the cafe, which you have to pay for obviously."}
{"text":"When I think of 'Demetre's' (as it is affectionately known by us 905ers), I am suddenly transported back to my wild high school days, when a crazy Friday night constituted of a Tim Allen movie at the AMC Winston Churchill and an ice cream-topped crepe at Demetre's.  These days, my visits are much rarer, what with many cheaper and just as tasty ice cream options in the big city. However, swinging by here off the cuff at about 11 pm on a weekday night proved to be quite a tasty treat! I can't imagine how I ever managed to handle one of their monster platters of cake/crepes topped with heaps of ice cream, so this time, I went for a single scoop of strawberry ice cream.  At about $7, it ain't cheap, but you get WAY more than your average scoop. It is served in a freshly made warm waffle cone that has to sit in a sundae dish to handle all the ice cream they'll pile in, topped with whipped cream and a cherry. Sweet, deliciously creamy, and oh-so-much of it. I normally finish everything, but even some of this had to be left to melt in my dish.  Service here is, unfortunately, pretty lackluster. It appears to be run by a bunch of dudes who meander about, and it'll take forever to flag one of them down. There were a couple of birthdays here, and it's cute that they play a pre-recorded birthday tune while flickering the lights (note: manually - and worth a good laugh to witness) throughout the restaurant, though they pretty much just drop off the sparkling dessert and get the hell away from your table without so much as a smile or \"happy birthday\". So imagine what it's like when it's not EVEN your birthday.  However, for a late night run and a cheesy place to have good ice cream, it's A-OK, just keep your service expectations low and savour the good stuff when it arrives."}
{"text":"This is the worse demetre location I have ever been. First of all they said they have free underground parking but it was hard to find, so we had to pay for parking. Once we were there we waited 20 mins to get seated because they said they were busy, when we finally were seated they gave us 3 forks and knifes but there were 4 of us. We waited another 20 min to place our order and another 20 min to receive our dessert and the presentation of the desserts wasn't even made pretty (the worst I seen). When we were done I had to go up to the waitress to get our bill because she was ignoring us when we try to ask her for the bill.. We will never come back to this location ever again even. There are other demetres locations which can give us free parking and good service."}
{"text":"I've been to multiple Demetre locations all over the GTA but this one definitely isn't up to par. My siblings and I went there on New Year's Eve and the place was packed (which is not unusual). However we had to wait over an hour for our order to arrive!! They didn't even bring us water or cutlery, we literally had to go up and ask for it. I also don't like that prices have gone up for everything on the menu. Probably not going to eat here again any time soon."}
{"text":"Smells so good upon entering and has a cute retro- diner look to it!  After looking at reviews I thought this place was going to be horrible but it was almost packed for a Thursday night. The service wasn't really good or bad since our waiter didn't say anything to us except take our order and fill our waters. He seemed friendly though! And the food came fairly quickly.   Very extensive menu and creative names for each dessert. They have crepes, waffles, cakes, sundaes... you name it! The menu can look overwhelming but after having dinner at a nearby restaurant, my 2 cousin's, brother and I decided to split 2 desserts. We ordered a blush waffle ($13.75) with fraoula ice cream, fresh strawberries and white chocolate chips and a sticky toffee pudding cake called toffee snob ($9.75) with what tasted like vanilla ice cream. I really enjoyed the blush waffle since it was warm and the ice cream wasn't overwhelmingly sweet like the toffee pudding cake. The ice cream also had bits of strawberry preserves that added a nice chewy texture. The toffee cake however was definitely too decadent and had nothing fresh or salty to cut the sweetness with.   Overall, I'm indifferent about coming back."}
{"text":"This Caffe Demetre is average. The price are alright and the food alright too. Went in with a few friends and the waitress was friendly but not at the same time. She seemed mad about something. Ordered a waffle dish which was huge. The waffles were good and i paid a fair amount for the amount I got. All in all, the expereince was good."}
{"text":"The merits of a franchise are how consistent they can deliver an experience. I've been a patron of Demetre chain for about 15+ years; I have my favorites , the crepes.   I've been to this location about half a dozen times.  It's spacious and nicely lit. Good arrangement of seating for groups or couples. It's conveniently located in a plaza across the street from the Collosus movie theater.  That night I felt like something apple.  Looking through the menu I had choice of an apple pie, apple sundae, apple crepe or an apple waffle. Went with an apple waffle to split and customized it subbing the white chocolate ice cream with honey vanilla ice cream and subbing the white chocolate sauce with dark chocolate sauce. It's cool that you can customize the crepe/waffle to your liking.   To go along with the waffle, didn't see a London Fog (earl gray latte) on the menu, but explained to our server how to make it - no guarantees he would make a good one but surprisingly he did a great job on making it.    Service was A+, our waiter and manager checked on us regularly and it was busy night.    Now the waffle came, it was the size of Everest but it tasted, dry and lacking butter. The honey vanilla ice cream and apple topping were fantastic though, next time around I'll stick to my goto crepes :) . Overall a place I'll continue to visit when I need a sweet fix."}
{"text":"This place is pretty nice, service was a lil slow (~20 min wait) the last straw was a little too sugary but overall a pleasant experience"}
{"text":"To be honest i have no idea why the rating im of this place is so low, this is the best Creperie place I've been to! My sister brought me here last winter so some crepes and it was so delicious! The crepes are huge and so so so yummy. I've been searching for this place for so long because my sister forgot the name of the place."}
{"text":"Delicious waffles and crepes! But last time I went it was a 40 minute wait for my dessert. I saw waiters and waitresses hanging out more than serving us."}
{"text":"Menu \"LOOKS\" good, but everything about the food and drinks are disappointing considering the price."}
{"text":"Came here after seeing a movie with some friends and I gotta say, this place was better than I expected. The menu had quite a large selection of items. My bf and I got a banana split and it was very good. The servers were full of smiles and our desserts arrived quickly. A bit on the expensive side but is satisfying and worth the money. Will definitely come back here in the future."}
{"text":"This place is usually busy at night so I would recommend making a reservation or going earlier in the day.    I always order their blush crepe, it's a bit too sweet but delicious. The portions for crepes and waffles are huge so you could easily split it among 2 people."}
{"text":"Been here quite a few times but it's been a few years.  Ice cream and crepes are great and HUGE.  Pricing wise it's not too cheap, but it's also pretty good dessert.  Definitely would consider going again."}
{"text":"Desserts are great, however customer service is subpar to poor. Not sure if it's new management but over the last few visits I've seen the waiters forcefully rush patrons out the door when they notice plates getting empty.   Tonight we were abruptly handed our bill right as my colleagues and I were finishing our coffees. We were taken back by how quickly they slammed the bill down, expecting us to pay and get out asap.   It was apparent the owner was trying to cram in as many customers as possible at short intervals to drum up more business sadly at the cost of good customer service......  Wouldn't recommend this location if you are out on a date, or out with the family looking for a nice way to wind down the evening - you will definitely feel rushed."}
{"text":"Our first time at a dessert caf√© and it was a good experience. We were in quite a bit of a rush and we were served quickly, unfortunately they didnt have three kinds of ice creams or pecan pie so we had to change up our order. It is a bit pricey but you get what you pay for. Definitely would come back, but would probably share with another person as the portions were large and had trouble finishing myself."}
{"text":"It's always a good time at Demetres - there's something for every kind of sweet tooth lover here! I've been to this particular location both with family/friends and on dates and it never fails to be the cherry on top of my day. The decor is cute chic and the menu gets a makeover by local artists every month to match the seasonal items. The crepes are great. The cake (shipped from none other than La Rocca) is decadent. The icecream is phenomenal. The world simply needs more Demetres"}
{"text":"Although I never had the chance to eat here I had a terrible experience in the establishment. I asked an European looking old guy if they do take outs and he just nodded yes. I asked him for the menu and he literally points at another waiter (rudely) and doesn't say anything. So I wait for the waiter to finish taking orders from another table and ask him for the menu and he rudely hands it over to me in frustration. It was awful. They dont care about serving customers because they know this place is so overrated. If it wasn't for instagram and other forms of social media people wouldn't know about it this place. If they fail to provide good service to your face who knows how much care they actually put into the quality of their food. They obviously don't give a shit because in Greektown everything stays in business. So long story short I left without ordering anything because I was completely ignored and the old guy was totally useless standing at the front. People are so stupid to waste their money here for over priced waffles and crepes/cakes."}
{"text":"Food: Got the chocolate paradox w/ crepe and caramel drizzle (3/5)  Service: Horrible! Male hostesses/manager rude and unpleasant. The waitress got our order wrong, we didn't say anything because it was already made. (1/5)  Ambience: Really Bad! Kitchen is right where you get served. barely able to hear each other over the sound of the clinging dishes. 3 of the workers including the manager stepped outside to smoke leaving the door wide open making the inside of the cafe smell of cigarettes. Yuk! 0/5  Price/ Value: $13 For a crepe + ice cream. A little pricy but not outrageous. 2/5  We have both been to other locations and this by far has been the worst. It is clear that this franchise is family run."}
{"text":"Only been there once but its safe to say that their desserts are amazing and good quality as well. A little bit in the pricey side but definitely worth it and would totally go back again. Portions are big too so its great for sharing."}
{"text":"Went here on a Wednesday night for the first time and I will not be returning. First off, the service is very slow... I waited 30 mins to be seated. Second, the waffle we ordered was so soggy. Third, the menu says the splitsonian has fresh strawberries when it was actually frozen."}
{"text":"Used to be a regular customer but looks like Demetre is undergoing a transition. The new plating is not very appealing for a desert lover. Paid almost $13 for this plate. Click to see image. Not going back again."}
{"text":"There are not so many customers, but there are plenty of seats and space. I like their menu. I find many things I want to try. I had a cup of tea and cheese cake. They are good. Their service was excellent. Even thought there are not so many customers, I do not feel like being supervised or stared. It was very comfortable. There is another Demetre on Danforth, but I think Eglinton is more spacious and look more pleasant."}
{"text":"Overprice dessert. I like that it opens until late though. Nothing special about the food. Will probably come back."}
{"text":"People are not lying about this place. Mind you, I have visited this location numerous times and have never had any major issues.  Long story short:  We came in around 1030 and having worked in the restaurant/food industry myself, I scarfed down my sundae so I did not hold the workers up from closing (they were closing at 11 pm). However, I am anaphylactic and ordered an Ariana sundae with the crushed hazelnuts replaced by oreo pieces. I will not mention the server's name because she is a human being at the end of the day and humiliating her publicly is not how I conduct myself online.   I specifically said to her I cannot have anything with nuts because I have an allergy so please make sure there are no other products containing nuts with my order. She looked at me blankly with a brief pause and said okay. She did not come back to tell me that the coconut sorbet is made with almond milk so I assumed it was safe to consume.   At this point, I ate my sundae as fast as I could and as soon as I stopped, I felt a reaction coming on. She came with the bill and I specifically asked her again \"just to make sure there were no other nut products in my order...the sorbet is not made with almond milk right?\". She freaked out and stated that the coconut sorbet was indeed made with almond milk and she failed to mention it. She completely forgot until I asked her which made me question her attentiveness to begin with. We threw $30 on the table and ran out to get to the hospital before my throat closed up. On our way out, she had the audacity to say thank you as though we were trying to tip her $10 ... I found that quite disrespectful.   Talking to the owner is a waste of time. Don't bother wasting your energy talking to her about how incompetent and dismissive her staff is. She offered me a $50 gift card which I decline because why would anyone want to go back to such an establishment after an experience like that? I had to hassle her to get information about their head office after 10 emails because she thought I was just going to accept the gift card and be on my way.   Ofcourse, after I was relentless about her dismissive behaviour and false accusations about my interaction with the server, she finally sent out an email that included the head office. In the email, she indicated that no allergy was mentioned and that both the server and manager were witnesses to the \"conversation\" I had with the server. The manager was in the kitchen area and no where near my table to hear how my conversation occurred so I am not sure how she's considered a witness.   Anyways, for all of you with allergies like me, make sure to record yourself informing the server about your allergy because they will make it out to be a \"preference\" and will write a long email stating how it was never mentioned.   Needless to say, I spent the whole night in the hospital and called off work the next morning only to deal with transactional businesses (nothing more than a give and take business)."}
{"text":"We keep giving this place a chance to redeem itself. We keep hoping it will. Sadly, it never does.   WHY does it take SO LONG to get a scoop of ice cream? WHY? What is everyone doing? Are you milking cows?   Customer service at it's absolute worst."}
{"text":"This is my go-to place. There are many reasons for me to say this. It has reasonable pricing compared to other places in Mississauga, quantity is good and it's delicious.   Every-time I visit this place, I tend to order something different. This time I had ordered a Double scope ice cream, a Banana spilt and an Ice cream waffle with Banana. I have no complains to whatever I ordered.  The only negative is that the menu hardly changes.  I would definitely keep coming to this place. Way to go guys.   Service: 4.0 Food: 4.5 Ambience: 4.0"}
{"text":"Went to this place on a Wednesday night for dessert. It was my first time to a Caffe Demetre.   We decided to order a crepe. It was delicious!! I highly recommend that you bring someone to share the dessert, the portions are massive!  It was quiet, but a big group came in half way through our dessert. The prices are kind of pricey, but it's worth it every now and then. I am looking forward to trying out the other locations."}
{"text":"I love all Demetries so my review might be bias. This location is quiet busy. We ordered the apple crepe + tongue depressor and they were both delicious !"}
{"text":"3 1/2 stars.  Coming here reminds of my high school days when this was THE spot to go to for dessert, especially after a movie or date night. Ten years later, I found myself here again. Once again, for dessert. Once again, with high school friends. Oh, sweet nostalgia.  After spending a good amount of time trying to decide between a crepe/waffle (classic) vs. sundae (new classic) vs. cheesecake (CHEESECAKE), I decided on the Face Pomme - a slice of cheesecake with warmed apple crumble topping. Two of my favourite desserts on one plate! Each component individually was decent, with some positives but also some negatives. The cheesecake was rich and smooth, but the crust was a bit heavy and floury... and I just prefer a graham crust anyway. The apple crumble was nicely spiced and not overly sweet, but limited in apple content. My one other complaint would be the whipped cream... unsweetened, why?! All things considered, it was a pretty good, but not great, dessert.    Overall, it was a fun night and it brought back a lot of good memories. Caffe Demetre will remain, for me, a tried and true option for a sweet ending to a low-key night out."}
{"text":"It's a desert restaurant. They pretty much have something for everyone, from crepes to ice cream to cheesecake. A slice of cheesecake costs $7-$9, without tax or tip. The portions are huge, so if you aren't coming with an empty stomach, chances are you won't be able to finish a serving on your own."}
{"text":"Waited 15-20 minutes when there were available tables. Hostesses were more into themselves than seating customers.  All of the waiters and waitresses look, act, and talk like zombies. Hot chocolate arrived NOT hot. When we asked them to fix it, they brought the same thing back but just microwaved.   My crepe came half on the waiters hand and on the table than on the plate itself.   After paying, waiter nor the 2 hostesses said thank you for bye.   Save yourself the trouble and don't bother coming here. It's not worth the atmosphere or price.   Just wanted to update my review with further comments. After posting my negative review, Vice President of Demetres reached out via email and phone call. He spent over 20 minutes listening and going through the evening I had with his restaurant. Although my experience the one evening wasn't great, the way Demetres handled the complaint and addressed the issues was top notch. Hoping some changes are made to improve the service and I would give this place another chance based on the follow up I had from the company."}
{"text":"Pomme Pilot? More like YUM Pilot!!  I've been wanting to come here for so long. I made the time to go for the first time in years. Since the place moved across the street from their previous location, I noticed that it looked nicer and was more comfortable. Although it was still quite loud and busy.   The wait was short but the food took a while to come. All of the dishes were very sweet. It was sort of pricey, and most people don't finish their meal because the portions are so big. So although it was delicious, I wasted money on something couldn't finish eating..."}
{"text":"Came here with a group of 4 on a busy Saturday night.  Looks like they were understaffed when we had to wait longer than 45 min for water.    Missing one order, still no water.    I tried the new coconut ice cream with my crepe. It was delicious and presentation is always great."}
{"text":"Great place for desserts! The portion sizes are good and the restaurant is clean. It is a little tightly packed but is a good place to just catch up, sit, relax and split a larger dessert or get your own if you have a sweet tooth.  I had the brul√© crepe with bananas and an AWESOME  Dulce ice cream. The whipped cream is fresh but definitely isn't sweet like the aerosol canned whipped cream. I will definitely try that flavour again with the waffle instead.  My siblings ordered a chocolate brownie crepe which was good, but not my cup of tea. Speaking of tea.. It is overpriced! $4.5 for one cup of tea. I opted out of that option. Service was definitely a 3 star rating. We waited 20 mins for our bill after we were finished. And she only checked on us once, 2 mins into eating.  Will go again, but please improve the service."}
{"text":"Today was the first day I got the taste of discrimination in Toronto ....... Went in with my kids and wife and the stroller, once we found the seats the guy came to us and said dont block the way with the stroller in a very weird and rude way and then left without giving us the menu. Came back as soon as a white couple and an African American family came in to give them the menu and swiftly went away. I didn't think of it in any way and we found the menu our self. 20 min went by and he didn't bother taking our orders where as the orders of the other two families were taken and he again ran off. I went inside to inquire and he didn't even bothered to look up while working on his computer but he had the time to answer the white guy. When I told him that we are waiting for 20 min he said that someone well be with us shortly by pointing at another guy (while avoiding eye contact with me) I talked to him and he said that we are busy and there is nothing that he can do and we have to wait another 20 min just to place our orders .... we obviously left. This was the worst experience I had ever while touring the world and my city was the last place that I expected this would happen .... yes they were busy but the cafe was not full and they didn't even pretended to care .... never again ..... in case you are thinking .. yes I am Brown with a beard hence the hatred I assume ....."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Poor management. It's not that the waitresses are rude... They're actually oblivious. I went with two other people and ordered our desserts within 5 minutes. Five minutes later, the first person got their milkshake. 30 minutes later , the second got their scoop of ice cream. Why does it take 30 minutes to scoop up ice cream - only the servers at Demetres can answer that. 45 minutes later I had to make a complaint about me not receiving my waffle, and I fully saw it go to another table who had arrived half an hour after us! The waitress for my section decided to start mopping the floors and stopped serving her section. Meanwhile no other waitress picked up her section. I should also add while we're eating, the waitress who was mopping the floors started mopping them with bleach, which is honestly a disgusting smell to take in while you're eating. Absolutely terrible."}
{"text":"Aah, Demetre on Yonge Street... I felt like I was staring into the face of the inbred cousin of Demetre Highway 7.  Something familiar but there's something a bit off...  I feel like Demetres is where you send bad adults for punishment.  There are no booze, it's full of loud teenagers, and has mediocre ice cream.  This location is different...in terms of clientele anyways. The people here were older than I expected.  When I arrived, the hostess asked if my entire party was here. I said no. She said she couldn't seat me because if another group showed up with everyone I would have to give my table up.  ...Excuse me? I guess I had my WTF expression on my face and I was seated promptly.  My friend ordered the Melting Pot. I could have sworn that they used to serve it in a bowl. It's tasty, but pretty underwhelming in terms of presentation. Just put it in a bowl, dammit, instead of that stupid latte glass. That way I feel a bit less bad for paying 6 bucks for hot chocolate..  The Pomme Sundae, spiced apple, vanilla ice cream, caramel sauce, and white chocolate sauce. It would have been better without the white chocolate and some more cinnamon.  7 bucks.  Hot Water with lemon - 95 cents.  There's nothing out this direction, so what are you going to do. ....I'd just keep driving and hit the Marble Slab on Major Mac if I want ice cream."}
{"text":"This location in particular specializes in desserts, notably crepes. savory crepes are no longer on the menu.  portions are GINORMOUS! you've been warned.  the texture of their crepes is the best - soft, eggy, chewy, almost gooey without tasting overly rich - my favorite is the double strawberry, with fresh strawberries and strawberry sauce; make sure you order it with vanilla honey ice cream.   their ice cream is premium, meaning at least 10% of what you're putting in your mouth is pure fat. that's what makes it so smooth and intensely flavorful. otherwise you're just eating ice and sugar.  a great hangout too - fun and comfy spacious seating, good lighting and decor, friendly staff. worth a trip and certainly if you are a crepe or ice cream (or both!) fanatic like me."}
{"text":"I went in there, trying to calm my mad sweet tooth. The cakes looked promising. After being ignored by the staff for a good ten minutes, I left. I ended up going to Panela Bakery on Yonge street (which I recommend)."}
{"text":"Why do you smell so good...but feed me such mediocre waffles.  I feel like I should like you. We've been acquitted for so many years... You have ice cream. ..But it's hard to screw up ice cream.  I keep eating at your establishment because people keep asking me to go.  I'm just being polite. I'll just smile and eat my cake.   We'll pretend you are actually a good dessert cafe, even though you are usually a last resort when there is no other dessert cafe around."}
{"text":"Our experience was so bad here, I thought that we might be on a Food Network reality show.  I don't venture out west too often, but Caffe Demetre on Enfield seemed like an easy place to grab late night dessert after a visit to Square One.  Once you step inside, the vibe is different than other Caffe Demetre locations. The decor is more basic here - like they decided to not spend any money on decor.    They have a few booths and simple tables and round tables with some seriously ugly plastic blue screens.  Maybe we should have taken a round table with the screens to obstruct our view of the ruffian patrons.  We were seated after a few minutes at a booth for two people. The seat was sticky... I'm hoping from chocolate sauce.  Our waitress was leaving for the evening and our server I think was the owner. He was rude, loud, unfriendly, obviously lazy, and a creep. He would be talking to us and then interrupting and abruptly yelling to his coworkers that he wanted to eat.  He stood around lazily chatting, so I assume that he was the owner, because if he was an employee he should have his butt booted.  I asked what cakes they had and it was met with an extreme eyeroll. The server/owner half gestured as he half-heartedly described them.  Apparently, this dessert cafe doesn't like it when you ask about the desserts.  A second eye roll occurred when my friend wanted a spoon to stir her hot drink.   The eyeroll was also accompanied with a rude \"What, really???\" - Yes, jerkface, really.  He asked us if we were going to order anything... repeatedly... every two minutes. Even though we ordered hot beverages and said that we would order dessert after our tea.  We were treated like teenagers with only loose change in our pockets. So weird, since we were probably the oldest customers in the place and my friend was pregnant.  Did you think she wasn't going to eat something?  He approached my friend and told her that she was taking too long looking at the menu and maybe she should just stop.  WTF. Anyways, we still ordered a crepe to share. I liked the ice cream, pretty standard Demetre crepes.  When if was time to pay, he just stood over us.   I told him to leave us alone.  I thought the service and overall everything about this cafe was disgusting. I will never return.  If there is a freak waffle iron accident and this location explodes, it will be doing the Mississauga area a favour."}
{"text":"A fantastic dessert shop. Often gets crowded on weekends, so get ready for a wait.  My go to dish: Sweetcar Named Desire, but with a twist. Switch out the ice cream for white chocolate ice cream and you'll be in heaven. Waffle or Crepe is always a debate, but both are equallty fresh and delicious.  All the beverages on the list don't disappoint, caffinated or not. The bottomless coffee is always fresh, along with the cappacino and espresso being very flavourful.   The cold drinks are fantastic. The O.C. is one of my personal favorites, but the rest don't disappoint.  Nice place for a date, or even just to have a chat with friends. Definately one of the best waffle and crepe shoppes in the Markham/Uptown area.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"One of the best desserts places in Toronto. I ordered the \"tongue depressor\" and I was very impressed! The portion is huge and is enough for two people."}
{"text":"I really love the extensive dessert options they have at every location. You can get anything, and they give you A LOT, so make sure you come here prepared for a dessert meal not just bite. The customer service was good, can't complain. The interiors are nice, and clean. I would come back again for desserts!"}
{"text":"GET THE COCOA CHANEL!  Its love in a glass.  This public service announcement has concluded.   By the way, at 10:30 pm we showed up. Thats right 30 min b4 closing. Service was excellent.  GET THE COCOA CHANEL!  Nothing subliminal about this message, is there?? This is a place that screams downtown, BIG CITY! Very upscale. Go to  the CAFFE for some dessert. Your tummy will thank you"}
{"text":"I love Cafe Demetre, however this branch is horrible. I visited it this weekend, and we had to wait about 15 min to have our order taken!! They have to increase the number of the employees and keep this service up to the level, and up to the quality!"}
{"text":"This place has fresh deserts. The waffles taste amazing and lived up to my expectations! The only turn off was the price. A waffles with a scoop of ice cream cost $12! The portion was large but not worth it's large price tag. As good as the waffle was, I was turned off by the wallet-killing prices. Good food, but not worth the money."}
{"text":"Mr. H and I ended up here late night with friends after a night out drinking. Desert always tastes better tipsy. The minute you enter you are hit by the wonderful smell of crepes!!! Oh so wonderful!  Our friends ordered the Moo La La and we ordered the Big Apple. OMG!!! It was soo good!! Like-I-want-to-lick-my-plate-clean good! Moo La La was one gigantic crepe with a chocolate ice cream scoop the size of a mountain underneath. The Apple Pie was warm and just the right amount of sweet and will be something I keep coming back for....  I can't wait to go back and try the other items on the menu!   PS: You know it's good when a person without a sweet tooth raves about it!"}
{"text":"I do come here when I'm craving ice-cream with crepes or waffles... It never disappoints! However the service here is abysmal across the board from just about every server I've had (and ice been coming here for like 10 years). They must be miserable with poor employee morale. But again, crepes and waffles are consistent!"}
{"text":"Really good dessert! I was here with my husband yesterday around 8pm. The waiter was very attentive and nice. He seated us immediately and let us choose our seating. He gave us a lot of time to decide what we wanted to order instead of asking us every 5 mins if we were ready. The food came extremely fast. I had \"the last straw\" (strawberry/whipped cream/vanilla ice cream/ waffle) and my husband had a cappuccino with a slice of blueberry cheesecake. It was delicious!  The waiter even took the initiative to bring us water ( I was just about to ask him for water and he already thought of it). Overall this place is great! Would love to come again."}
{"text":"I'm actually pretty surprised to see people giving this place bad reviews because I honestly enjoyed this place! It was my first time coming here too! (I was in Canada for the weekend and my cousin wanted to take me out). I still can't get over the fact that people go out for dessert so late. We got there around 10:30 PM and it was already pretty packed -inside and outside- but we still managed to get seated right away. I loved that it smelled like waffles right when we walked in. If it's your first time coming here, the menu is a bit overwhelming. I think i spent about 5-10 minutes just looking at everything because I didn't know where to begin and I just wanted to try everything!  Anyways, I can't recall the specific name of the dessert my cousin and I shared, but it was in the crepe section and it had chocolate ice cream wrapped in a crepe and topped with strawberries and chocolate syrup. A heads up, the portions are HUGE. Our waitress asked us if we wanted an extra scoop of ice cream since we were sharing (so of course we said yes), but we ended up having some ice cream left over. And these were giant scoops of ice cream, so I'd suggest sharing unless you're really hungry.  If there was anything I disliked about the whole place, it's probably how loud it was. I felt like I was yelling the whole time when I was talking to my cousin. It's probably less crowded earlier in the day than it is at night though. But overall, I'd recommend this place to others! Hopefully I'll get the chance to come here again the next time I go to Canada!"}
{"text":"Best ice cream date location!   Ordered a strawberries and chocolate topped crepe with chocolate and white chocolate scoops of ice cream.  It was unbelievably great!   Teas and warm ciders are also excellent.    The service was good and quick.  The prices are reasonable considering the large portions."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst customer service I have ever experienced! Definitely will NOT be coming back here. We arrived at 10, hostess sat us by 10:15PM, didn't receive our menus till around 10:30PM. Finally after an eternity had passed, we finally placed our order, however, it doesn't end there. I asked out server 4 times before we received one cup of hot water, only after about 20 minutes did we get 4 more glasses of ice water. I understand it was busy, but this is ridiculous! Do I really have to ask that many times for a simple cup of water? Our desserts finally arrived, 30 minutes later .. We finished our desserts, very dissatisfied, asked for the bill 3 times before we finally received it. I definitely do not recommended coming back here!"}
{"text":"Went on a Sunday afternoon when I was craving something sweet. Normally I'm a chocolate lover but really wanted some apple pie, so thats what I ordered, which came with a side of honey ice-cream. The pie was meh.. I'm a baker, and I figured I could have made it, or something better. The ice cream really had no flavour.  My fianc√© ordered the banana split. He was upset that the banana's were sliced instead of split.. haha.  Honestly, I WILL try this place again, probably on a girls night.. there are so many options on the menu to choose from."}
{"text":"Wow this place can provide high sugar levels!   The place is nice but does get really packed at point so you might have to wait now and then. The Caffe is located in Courtney park plaza opposite to cineplex and shoeless joes.   The do have a lot of variety in desert but I always prefer their hot drinks. I have tried their Ice Cream Crepes, cakes, Cappuccino,Double Latte, Organic Teas, Plain ice creams and I will have to say their stuff is above average and not bad.  The service at this location can be slow at times but it does get busy on them. The staff is quite friendly. The Caffe is designed nicely as there is plenty of seats and in summer they have seat outside as well."}
{"text":"I don't know a lot places that dedicate their entire menu to different types of desserts so I can't really compare this place with any other. I have to say that if you are just aching for something sweet, this is the place to fill the void.  There really is no way you can wrong with cake+ice cream or cake+coffee or waffles+chocolate or any other sweet combination you can think of. That being said, I wouldn't necessarily say that this place has the best cake, or the best coffee, or the best ice cream, they just have a place that puts all these things together into one complete dessert shop."}
{"text":"Horrible service, took forever to get seated and almost nobody was actually here (aka what the hell are the servers doing if there aren't even many customers here???) Then when I told them my first order, she came back 5 mins later, and they informed me that they didn't have half of the ingredients needed for that one, so I told her my second choice and she said they didn't have enough to make that either (weird because both were just regular chocolate ones.) then I asked her which option they do have and she listed what ingredients they still have (not many) so I had to create my own dessert. Then my boyfriend got his, and I'm still waiting for mine 15 mins later. Also I got a Thai iced tea and they forgot to put the tea in so it was just a cup of cream. Bad service, not properly stocking their kitchen, and bad training for servers and kitchen staff. I won't be returning here, we'll be going somewhere else next time."}
{"text":"Was alright, The food was nothing to be overly excited about, it is what you'd expect I guess?  The food was good. Customer service is good... Only down side is the prices even charging 1 dollar for hot water I find really unnecessary.  Overall it's alright. Nothing too amazing but not bad."}
{"text":"We were seated immediately upon entering.  There were only 2 waitresses and very few empty tables.  I never felt rushed or ignored.    I don't usually eat dessert.  However, I was trying to cleanse my palate on an awful dinner I had.  I decided to have dessert here after seeing someone's plate.    I couldn't decide between the Ella Fitzgerald or the Donatella Versace, the waitress gave me the best of both desserts.  I substituted the bananas in the Donatella for the fresh strawberries in the Ella & the taste was absolutely DIVINE!  I don't have a sweet tooth and this dessert proved perfect for me.  It offers fresh strawberries with a warm Nutella drizzle & pralin√© croquant atop a fresh, warm Belgium waffle & whipped cream.    If it weren't for the hair in my iced water, this would have been an excellent experience."}
{"text":"I wanted to order take out. They are usually closed at 11PM. I walk in and all of these workers stare at me like they've never seen a customer before. Extremely rude. Then they said they are closed.  I brought up the fact that they are closed at 11. They said, they are closed for floor maintanence. What is \"floor maintanence?\"   Looked to me that they were just a bunch of lazy people who were looking for an excuse to close early"}
{"text":"Mediocre desserts when there are better places to hang out in Markham. Went here today, 4 adults and 3 kids. Nothing really special about the desserts or drinks. I think the cakes are from La Rocca. Service is friendly, but slow. We got our food after 45 minutes waiting - good thing kid's were busy with the iPhone. Portions we're big, but nothing to rave about."}
{"text":"Pleasant cafe filled with many seatings and welcoming staff. They have a variety of desserts with clever punny names. (Ie: The fork awakens) Considering their portions, the amount they charge ( kinda pricey ) is worth it! My friend commented how you can tell if ice cream is good quality or not by how quickly it melts. I haven't even finished half of my ice cream 20 minutes after I got it but it was still in perfect shape! The waffle was crispy and delicious and the whip cream was beautifully decorated on our plates. A total must try for any sweet tooths out there :)"}
{"text":"This place has changed for the worse over the years. There is no heart in the food and service as it used to be back in the days.  - fruits on the waffles were not very fresh and not sweet. - service was slow. - the waiter did not bring enough glasses of water for each person at our table. - food quality is average, as opposed to the higher quality they used to serve. - it was fairly busy and lively but the food and service suffered.  - menu has changed, I didn't feel like I got fair value for what I paid. - we used to frequent this location quite often but after this last visit we will not be going back."}
{"text":"Horrible service and horrible food. I've been to my fair share of Demetre's in Ontario and I have to say, this one is really really bad. Upon walking in, there is a sign to seat yourself. After that we waved down a waiter for menus and it took another 30 minutes for the waiter to come take our order even though the restaurant was completely empty and there were 2 staff working.   My friend ordered the cake and it had clearly been sitting in the display for a while because it was dry on the outside and the icing was a little bit hard on the top. I ordered the baklava and it was horrible. I left it after two bites (the first time it was horrible and then I ate it again to make sure). The only redeeming factor was the fact that when the waiter came to take our plates, I told him that I didn't like the baklava and he didn't charge for it. However, I am still very very very disappointed by the service and food at this Demetre's location (its usually so yummy). I guess that's probably why this location is always empty."}
{"text":"I never realized I would come across a place that is dedicated to just desserts! We got the Cocoa Ono, which is honey vanilla ice cream with a chocolate cake with some chocolate sauce, and it was definitely a nice dessert to share after a light dinner. It was sweet, which was what we expected, and a lot of chocolate but in a good way. We also got a hot chocolate, but that was very average and not that amazing.  The place seems to be kid and even adult friendly. You see people of all ages here enjoying what they came for, which is dessert. Overall, if you want to get dessert, I don't see why you would hesitate to come here if you have time and just want to eat dessert with others!"}
{"text":"Really delicious food and a great treat once in awhile though, the only thing is if you come closer to closing time they are always out of a great deal of items. The menu is very large so its a little overwhelming and takes awhile to decide though service itself is VERY fast."}
{"text":"The wait time is quite long- which is fine considering that it's quite busy here on weekends. I really didn't like that everyone's food is brought out at different times. My meal came so late that everyone else at the table was almost done. It was a piss off because I brought some people here for the first time and we couldn't even eat together.   The 3 stars in this review is for the food quantity and quality which is good for the price you pay ($10-&14).   Quite a few many options and something for everyone (with a sweet tooth).   NOTE: they have VEGAN options available as well!!"}
{"text":"A place for decadent desserts. I especially like the cakes here. Had the red velvet cheesecake last night. The place is packed and theres usually a waiting line from around 9pm onwards. Stays open till 12am. The service is quick but the staff isn't too friendly. The serving sizes are huge and one dessert can easily be shared by two people."}
{"text":"Sweet tooth's heaven! This has always been a family favorite outing to come for a fun, light-hearted environment to grab a dessert.  The wait and service can be slow, but if you can get past that, it's not a bad place to have a sugar rush and catch up with friends."}
{"text":"The worst service at this location, we were a group of four, seated and waited 20mins before the server took our order for dessert and water... 15mins later our dessert order was on the table but no water.. OK that was OK... Expecting the water would come soon... Having our ice cream etc.. 10mins later no water my wife asked one of the employees for a glass of water she was very nice and said sure no problem.... Finished our desserts and still no water... After paying my bill I asked for the manager just so someone knows what's happening at this Establishment.... His response was \"the person we asked for the water was not a server and her job is not to serve water\" she was the hostess but he will have a talk with his server... (He also offered a discount on the bill which we declined) but we wouldn't go back to this location."}
{"text":"Came here as a group of 4 and was immediately seated, our servers were friendly and very efficient too. We ordered the Interstella waffle and Americano coffee. The waffle was delicious and the coffee was, well coffee! Surprisingly they didn't have cream for coffee (only milk available).... Only thing that bugged me were the fruit flies, it kind of made it difficult to relax while enjoying our dessert when you need to act like the terminator while devouring deliciousness."}
{"text":"We went here on a Tuesday night on a warm winter night and the place was packed! It was very unexpected and we had to wait for about 20 minutes. We've been to Demetre's many times before, but did not expect it to be so busy on a weeknight.  We got seated by who I believe was the manager. Unfortunately, he did not keep track of who was in line and they gave our table away to customers who came after us (they were a party of 3 and we were just 2 but we still got a big table).  The waffle was great and done in a very timely manner even though the restaurant was very busy. Once our waffle was finished, I asked for the bill and the manager told us the that our meal was on the house because we were kind enough to wait so long! He was a very nice individual and would go back for that reason alone."}
{"text":"If you want to fulfil a dessert craving, this is a great place to go! I also had the elderflower drink which I thought was quite good, and refreshing with the chocolate dessert."}
{"text":"Soooo dessert place! Not bad and can fit a decent-sized crowd but it can get squishy once it hits their peak hours which is at night on the weekends. When it's busy I really would try to avoid this place because the wait is too annoying and sometimes you end up waiting outside. If it's in the winter, I don't know if you would want to wait out there...granted this winter was warmer than usual. The layout and display of the whole joint is pretty cool and colourful.  Desserts...weeellll they have a full variety as you can see from the other reviews and pictures. Waffles, crepes, ice creams, cakes, sundaes and drinks both hot and cold. Interesting names too. They taste great within the first few bites and then they become overwhelmingly strong and super sweet. I wouldn't say I'm a dessert addict but I never say no to desserts and I do love them. Coming here is like a meal in itself though; a dessert meal. I always finish my plate but boy am I stuffed and do I feel super horrible like I gained 1000 calories just for that. But all that aside it's a nice place if you want your dessert craving to be cured in one shot! Prices are reasonable as well.  I come here once in awhile but I don't hate it or love it like it's to die for."}
{"text":"On October 1, 2015 at about 9:30PM I visited the location on Bloor Street in the Kingsway neighbourhood.  We were served by a manager (male, glasses, Australian/New Zealand accent).  We placed our order and informed him their was a nut allergy. He informed us he would tell the kitchen to take extra precaution, but informed us he could not guarantee cross contamination.  We ordered the Pomme Pilot crepe and the Smashing Pumpkin crepe.  We asked what was in the crumble in the Pomme Pilot and the manager was unable to properly give us the ingredients, but assured us there were no nuts.  As the kitchen staff (female, blonde hair) was making the crepes, I noticed that she placed the crepe on the pick-up counter with the pecans as a garnish.  When the manager saw that she made the crepe with the pecan garnish, I overheard him tell her to just pick them off. I assumed the crepe was for a different customer, as he assured us he would let the kitchen staff know of our request, and we had informed him we had a nut allergy.  He went ahead and served us the two crepes, one of which had the pecans scraped off. As I have the nut allergy and was having the Pomme Pilot I did not hesitate at first, but as my husband ate his Smashing Pumpkin I began to have less confidence in the kitchens ability to honour my request.  When we brought up the issue to the manager, he informed me that both our crepes had not been in contact with nuts. He relayed the message to the kitchen and the confused kitchen staff hesitantly agreed that there were no nots. He attributed my confirmation of whether there were nuts in our order to the ice cream. However the ice cream (pumpkin spice) did not list nuts as an ingredient, unless he was confusing nutmeg for a nut instead of a spice.  I have been a loyal customer for over ten years, and have often frequented the Kingsway location. In the past, the staff have always been very accommodating and although they cannot guarantee that products served are not 100% nut free, I had confidence that they would ensure upon request that cross contamination had not occurred. After todays events, and the inability for the staff to take a nut allergy request seriously, I doubt I will ever be able to return to a Demetre's location. It was very upsetting to hear a manager advise kitchen staff to simply pick off the nuts that were used as a garnish with no regard for the potential risk to customers health. I will also be sure to inform all my friends that the management at Demetre's is incapable of accommodating nut allergies.  The ignorance of staff with regards to a serious allergy is not acceptable especially after the heightened attention allergies (especially to nuts) in the media."}
{"text":"Right across from the movie theatres, we came here and shared a crepe, which was really delicious. I had a hot apple cider as well which I always enjoy when I come here. Our waitress was really sweet and polite and overall it was a good experience as always."}
{"text":"They have great selection for ice cream, cakes, waffles and crepes. In most locations especially this one they're accommodating for larger groups and I've never had to wait longer than 5 minutes before I got seated regardless of party size (approximately 2-6 people, however I should mention I typically go during week days).   Tonight we ordered Piece Talks ($12.5) and The Last Straw with crepe ($13.5). They were both delicious. For piece talks, I really enjoyed their red velvet cake. Previously in another review I mentioned Carole's cheesecake being the best cheesecake I've had in Toronto so far, however, since their locations aren't as convenient I would say Demetre's definitely has the second best red velvet cake. The pairing with the white chocolate silk ice cream created the perfect balance as both were not too sweet, and the textures of both cake and ice cream were unique in their respective ways. As for the last straw, this is my go-to whenever I come as they always manage to have sweet strawberries, the ice cream portions are generous beneath the crepe ! I should also mention that their portions overall are not small. We shared the two orders among four adults !  I came for the first time back in 2009 and it has yet to disappoint since. Looking forward to my next visit (:"}
{"text":"I've been here several times in both a big group and with 1 other person. Usually it's pretty crowded no matter what time of the week you go. But lately the service has really gone down. I don't mind waiting in a big crowd at the front for however long but tonight's experience was terrible. Most of the servers looked uninterested in serving the customers. There was one particularly obnoxious individual who found the task of sorting spoons more interesting than acknowledging the large line of people waiting. There were several empty tables mind you. Giving it a 2 star because there was 1 server who was running to take as many orders as he could. Ended up leaving after 20 minutes of waiting. By then the crowd was spilling out of the front doors."}
{"text":"Came here for some dessert.   Pros: - Fairly quick service  - Waffles are great   Cons: - Very pricey $17 for a waffle with chocolate ice cream and sliced bananas..."}
{"text":"Overall I would say that I enjoyed my time at Demetres. However, I think the location of the place could be better. I don't think anybody would actually notice it while driving unless they were specifically looking for it. Location aside, my boyfriend and I were seated immediately, probably because it was just the two of us. We ordered the Fudgement Day crepe to share, as well as Green Tea, since my boyfriend was cold and sleepy. The crepe was quite good, however considering the fact taht it was just crepe, ice cream, bananas and chocolate, all relatively inexpensive ingredients, I'm not sure if the $10 price tag is that reasonable. It's not an outrageous price, but I think I'd be happier if it was 7 or 8 bucks only.  However I suppose they do make up for the price in terms of the portioning which is fairly large.  As for the tea, we really should have just opted for the specialty coffees or hot chocolates in my opinion. I suppose I can't really blame Demetre for the tea, since its store bought but I must say i didn't like it. Instead of just normal green tea that i was expecting, it was \"tropical\" green tea. Being chinese, I'm used to the almost bitter flavour of tea, and not so much the fruity teas. The fruitiness of it just made me want to add sugar to it, which would really just turn it into something like Arizona that i could get for $1 as opposed to $2+. (Yes I'm stingy I know, it's in my blood)  Overall though, I would say both food and service was okay. I don't really think that I'd be a regular customer, but this is probably where I'd be heading if I had a sudden and immediate craving for crepes or waffles.  **sidenote** I've tried the waffle before, and I think I prefer it over the crepe. More filling too."}
{"text":"Came here on a Thursday evening, it wasn't too busy and there was only one server working   Pros - Ok price for based on quality, quantity and presentation (especially the waffle desserts)  - Nice ambiance  - Professional   Cons - Don't get the Mango Sorbetto (tastes terrible)"}
{"text":"Why eat dessert at the restaurant you had dinner at. When in the area after a great meal with friends I will always take them to Demetre's for Dessert as there is nothing better. Friendly Staff, Great Atmosphere, and even better Desserts."}
{"text":"My siblings and I recently went here for a little dessert and were surprisingly disappointed. This location specifically has gone down in terms of food quality and service. I ordered the fridges of Madison County and some of the cake slice was missing from underneath (it was basically half of what usually comes in a serving). The ice cream that came with it was practically melted by the time it got to the table and there was some sauce on it that all in all made it look so unappetizing. We brought it up with the waitress and they just brushed it off saying \"that's how it comes\". I noticed the change in quality ever since the owners changed. Wait times are long at every demetres location so I would simply go to another location if you're going to wait anyways. Better to get good quality food when you're paying a lot. I'll be going to another location closer to my house."}
{"text":"Delicious dessert (waffles and crepes), open late. Why should I go downtown when I want a decent dessert?? This place Offers cakes, crepes, waffles, sundaes, shakes, and hot beverages- all for a reasonable price.    The pomme pilot is apple crisp topped waffle. The Crisp is a bit too much but I think it would be better with just the apple pie filling. I still ate it- it was yummy.  3/5 for food- with one extra star for clever names on the menu.   I haven't tried the cakes so I won't speak for them, and the chai milkshake is meh. However, in the Markham/scarb area this would be my place to go for dessert. I'm not aware of many others apart from one that will not be name but charges $14 for a basic crepe.  I get a waffle for 13.75 here with amazing toppings.  Markham needs more bakeries that offer good, quality desserts. Till then, this will do."}
{"text":"Walked into waffle heaven - where the place practically smelled of waffles. Partner and I came here on a Friday night, and the place was packed! We were so lucky to get a table close to the corner. Waiters/waitress are quick to get your orders and food comes quite quickly.  I ordered the Stuck market waffle and he ordered the Et tou, Br√ªl√©e? Milkshake. The milkshake came first and it basically tasted like melted vanilla ice cream. Nothing too special. The waffle on the other hand was decent. It was served with peanut butter ice cream (which was a bit hard to taste out), and caramel sauce all over. Reeses chunks were sprinkled all over the waffle as well. The one thing that was a little disappointing was the waffle. The taste was quite good, but it was also quite dry. There was a lot of ice cream though, so if you eat it together, its fine. But separately, is a different story. In terms of the portion size, I was skeptical about ordering one waffle because I didn't want to share. But, I definitely could not have finished it on my own.   The one negative thing about the place was that the tables are a bit small for plates. If my partner also ordered a dessert, our plates may have been clashed. Our chairs were also a little wobbly, so don't expect this place to be extremely comfortable."}
{"text":"I had mixed feelings about this place forever. On one hand it represents the excess that is North America i.e. monster sized desserts that can send one into a sugar induced coma and on the other hand they do make their crepes,waffles, toppings etc. fresh so that has to be appreciated. I hadn't been to this spot in eons as didn't want relive the sugar overload I associated with this place. The prices have gone up and now they do their ice creams in house.  I settled for a waffle as if wants to indulge why settle on a crepe.  Sure enough a monster sized serving that IMO should suffice for two people easy. Sugar nightmare realized as I felt awful after I woke up from this dream (sadly real). I can see the appeal of this spot as dessert only spots that are open late night are hard to come by I personally would rather have a smaller portioned richer dessert over a sweet one. 2 Stars."}
{"text":"I came here with my family and a friend and we ordered the apple cider, chocolate ice cream waffle, and apple pie w/ ice cream. All of them were tasty and sweet. Prices were also pretty reasonable. If I come to the Toronto area again, I'll definitely be coming here again."}
{"text":"Went here with a girl friend for a little sweets and chats!   It was busy as always and we were sat at a table that was very close to the other tables beside us. If we weren't such big talkers we could have eavesdropped on the other couples conversations... Awkward!! Haha!  Anyways we ordered our favorite drink Cappuccino which came deliciously topped with fluffy foam! On the side a little biscotti teaser.  NOW girls night is about indulging in the sweets so we both ordered off the Crepes menu. I had the Extravagant Crepe :  ELLA FITZGERALD (JUST PLAIN AWESOME: UNDER MY NUTELLA¬Æ...ella ella) which is topped with Fresh Strawberries and Nutella¬Æ.  Yummo! I love the simplicity of the crepes and the overboard options with ice cream and sauces and other crunchy, chocolatey, peanut buttery, minty choices.   I am a girl who will take simple anyday  when it comes to my crepes so Nutella and Strawberries were the perfect treat for this lady!  I give this place 3 stars because on a busy day you may almost sit on the person next to you. The food is yummy but the crepes are just your old crepe and a little on the chewy side, I like a more springy fluffy crepe.   But all in all a good time!"}
{"text":"Guaranteed to hit the spot for waffles and ice cream or crepes craving, a sweet tooth lovers dream."}
{"text":"Way too much whipped cream on their stuff and not enough toppings. Doesn't taste as great as it sounds as sometimes the batter comes out note full cooked. Also, costs a bit too much for the quality you get."}
{"text":"As a old establishment, Caffe Demetre has been here for 20 years (as what the place would say) and the decor looks updated but there are still some shades of improvement. The place is spacious however it seems that they split the place up as the tables in the other half of the place were not available.    Seeing that it's just one waiter/cashier/maybe owner in the restaurant at that time, I was alright but as Yvonne pointed out, my neck did get stiff after turning side to side.   I ordered the \"Cone-spiracy Theory\" which was a scoop of ice cream and topping with a waffle cone to hold it (also with cherry and whip cream extra). The chocolate ice cream and strawberry topping was alright at first but it just seems like a rip considering it was $6.50 and other places tend to be less than that. It did not really finish it due to the fact that I did not like the ice cream and I get suspicious when they don't show you the ice cream selections even though you clearly see them making it.   I might come back when its spring or summer but I rather go to Ed's Real Scoop."}
{"text":"What does a food coma feel like?  Don't know but it tastes like a solo attack on the \"BANANA KARENINA\".  Wow, on our visit up from Florida we were warned about the massive size of the servings but we threw caution to the wind.... ooops.  While our son and daughter-in-law shared a Moo La La I tackled the Banana Karenina and my better half tackled What The Fudge.  Stop eating?  No way, too good and a challenge was on (I didn't win but I did clean my plate).  Dang glad we weren't the ones driving that night, food coma for sure... but with BIG SMILES   :O)   Highly recommend for visitors to visit and locals to regular this spot.  Servings massive (but possible to do solo) and so, so, so, sinfully goooooood!"}
{"text":"Brand new menu! New hilarious names! I tried the Summertime Fatness and my boyfriend had the Harlem Shake.  Demetre's doesn't disappoint. The new ice cream flavours are to die for. I'm glad they freshened up their menu; they've never had a different one since I've been going there. If you're a cake person, they changed their cakes. Also, they no longer have red cherries, only black cherries; so if you're a cherry cheesecake fan, beware!  The prices did go up a bit, but I guess that's to be expected.  Still love this place, can't wait to try more of their new creations."}
{"text":"Great spot in Bloor West Village.  I love their assortment of desserts and they have amazing coffees.  Summer nights are always packed."}
{"text":"It was ok not that great! We just came from Demetres and not excited at all that we finally been to this Cafe. Read a lot about the cafe so it was a long due. We ordered Choco Ono and a cup of Cappuccino. Choco Ono was very very sweet and it was \"recommended\" in the menu(star in the menu indicated as recommended) and in Cappuccino they added a teaspoon of Cinnamon powder(which I hate the most). Didn't knew that they'll add cinnamon powder otherwise I had ordered a Latte. So I guess this was it... not going back there ever again."}

{"text":"I almost always just get a slice of chocolate fudge cake. tastes good but it's definitely overpriced (a little over $7, before tax). Their prices have gone up over the years and it doesn't seem worth it to make the trip anymore"}
{"text":"3.5 stars. Could be 4 if service/cleanliness was improved. I also strongly dislike the screaming children that happen to always be present (parents, like do your job, please, k?).  Since my last review, they have actually removed the yogurt ice cream, and replaced it back with the old ice cream, which is just as good as it was originally. The waffles are delicious, and I really enjoy them.  However, depending on who you get for service, it could really change the experience. I came twice last week. One time I had a Persian girl who was super, another time I had an Asian guy with a sour look on his face and no expression, who was not great. Their bathrooms were also gross. One thing that was fantastic was the music. They had Sirius radio on and I would have enjoyed it more if it wasn't for the misbehaving children and incompetent parents.  But good job Demetre's for going back to the original ice cream."}
{"text":"My favorite dessert place besides Spin Cafe, I feel this place offers more options with special menu items.   The ice cream, waffles and cakes are to die for! Ice cream very flavorful, not too sweet, and it's so smooth and rich. The waffles are crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, just the way I like them. The fresh fruits are always great and compliment the waffles and ice cream well. I love getting anything red velvet, white chocolate, caramel or with strawberries. The cakes are super moist and decadent, never too sweet.   Only thing is, the price is quite high which kind of discourages me because I love waffles and ice cream but because of the prices, I don't get to go as much as I'd like.   Overall, great dessert place, interiors are absolutely beautiful and I love how they change their menu layout and look from time to time, shows the company is constantly trying new things and actively making changes. The service here is always great too."}
{"text":"One of the places I always remind myself not to go to, but end up going back to again and again. Now, don't get me wrong! Demetres is a fine establishment. I'm just not that crazy about sweets. And this place definitely ramps up the sugar and decadence to a whole new level.   I never knew what to order, as the selections were expansive, intricate, and overwhelming! Luckily, they have a new menu (with clever headings), and more options for the folks that want something simpler, like me!   Came by with a friend and got myself the Cake and Coffee combo for $9.50. A pretty good deal, where I can balance the decadence of the cake with the bitterness of the coffee. The Chocolate Mousse Cheesecake was actually very good. Rich in chocolate flavour, while still being light and fluffy. Not something you get in a cheesecake very often! My friend got the Last Straw Crepe. The crepe was beautifully thin and the ice cream was pleasantly sweet and light. Topped with strawberries, it was delightful!  A nice place to go to once in a while, but probably not my top pick for desserts. Again, the decadence level here is through the roof in my opinion! I didn't even finish all my cake! So if you're looking for something on the richer side, come to Demetres! If you're like me, I'd look into something else in the area..."}
{"text":"Definitely my go-to place when I'm having some intense sugar cravings. The Roch√© ice cream is by far my favourite. My only advice is to share orders with your friends/family/lover... a sundae/crepe/waffle order all to myself is too much for even my giant sweet tooth to handle sometimes. The prices keep going up every year, but it's hard to argue with a giant crepe covered in ice cream and toppings (most crepe places in the city don't come with ice cream, so Demetres has the upper hand for us ice cream fiends).   Also, at this location, I find the decor to be nice and the service to be pretty quick (though not always the friendliest)."}
{"text":"Demetre's is a great place to go with anyone. This place is colourful, friendly and clean. I always get the sweetcar, strawberries and chocolate ice cream you can never go wrong. I have tried their capuccino's and they seem strong so I would stay away from that. Their herbals teas are nice and mango sorbet is delicious :) They have something for everyone, So I recommend this spot all year long."}
{"text":"I love this place!! It opens pretty late so a perfect spot after dinner to sit and enjoy some delicious desserts.   UPDATE** they discontinued some of their fresh mixed fruit desserts. It's just strawberries and bananas :( I miss their mixed fruit desserts so much (I dropped a star as a result) Their desserts are so awesome. Everything I've had so far is delicious. I love their fruits--- SUPER DUPER FRESH. Every time I come and order a dessert dish with fruits, it's always extremely fresh. I love that about them.   If you have any cravings for desserts, THIS IS THE PLACE TO GO.   FYI, if you need the wifi from this place, ask a server!! They'll gladly tell you."}
{"text":"This is my go-to place for hangouts with friends in Etobicoke. The menu is to die for and you can split with friends or devour an entire plate of crepes, strawberries, whipped cream and icecream on your own (who cares about that waistline when the food is that good! Yum!)  Pretty much everything on their menu is great. I always order a crepe with icecream, chocolate sauce, and strawberries. Their hot chocolate is EXCELLENT. My friend even compared it to the hot chocolate in Italy, which is the highest compliment she can think of.   Service is great. Swift and always friendly. The servers are almost exclusively male.   Only downside is the price. You're probably looking at $8-10 dollars for a crepe/waffle etc. Quite steep for desert."}
{"text":"I can't believe I've been missing out on this place for all the years I've lived in Richmond Hill. It's like one of those dessert places you see in the movies. I really liked the atmosphere- the decor was clean and bright and warm and welcoming. The menu was really entertaining & very clever. The service was a bit slow but I think everyone in the restaurant (it was full) arrived at the same time. What a great place to spend a summer evening or a winter evening with friends or family or a date. Would be a great spot to celebrate just about anything with an over-the-top treat. The portions were extremely generous. I don't even want to know how many calories I consumed. Very tasty. A little bit pricey. But a real treat."}
{"text":"This Caffe Demetre's located close to Square One is absolutely amazing!!! The owners and staff are very friendly and welcoming and the desserts are excellent.   The staff here all seem very passionate about what they provide. The place is very clean and well set. I would highly recommend this place because of the outstanding service I have received in all my visits.   On my recent visit I ordered the Last Straw and was thrilled with what I received. The waffle was hot & fresh and the ice cream melted so well on top of it. Just loved the taste!! The best thing about this place is that they are quick with their service and they have impressed me with the freshness of their desserts.   The servers are always polite and friendly and go above and beyond to provide the best service. From the time I step into the restaurant to the time I exit I am treated like a valuable customer. Very impressing service! which makes the visit to this place a delightful experience :)    An awesome place for families, couples, kids, and singles.  You would definitely love it as well."}
{"text":"Good place to get some deserts. Service was okay."}
{"text":"This may be the worst location I have been to yet. I ordered apple pie and earl grey tea. The server kept telling me I couldn't have earl grey for the cake/coffee combo. I had to tell him several times I didn't want the combo and would pay separately for the tea and pie. The pie came with so much cinnamon on it I couldn't taste the apples. The server didn't bring any milk or a spoon for my tea and he didn't return to our table so I had to stir my tea with my fork. The service was slow and the server didn't return to the table to ask if we needed anything else or how the food was. I will never return to this location! So awful."}
{"text":"Went here on a Sunday night, around 9. The place was packed,but we were quickly seated within 2 minutes. The food came very fast as well. They had a glorious amount of options. The ice cream is made in house and is simply delicious. Server was great and had a great attitude. Will definitely be going there again!"}
{"text":"definitely come here if you have a sweet tooth and a big appetite. dining in this restaurant feels very warm and welcoming with the awesome staff and cool food. their menu items are all funny puns, which i very much appreciate. everyone NEEDS to try their ice cream; its made in house and its to die for. also their milkshakes are BOMB. just try everything, too good."}
{"text":"Well if you read my review on Sushi Kai.. you will understand why we proceeded to Demetre for some dessert.   We were mostly full from our crappy dinner at Sushi Kai so we shared a slice of Double Fudge Chocolate cake to be exact!!  OMG!! it is good!!! Moist, hmm hmm good chocolate-yummy-goodness! And we had asked for 2 glasses of water.. and the server kept coming back to fill up our water.. he came back to see if we needed anything else!!  Compared to where we just ate for 2.5hrs and we were ignored.. Demetre's put that restaurant to shame in terms of quality customer service with their servers!!!! I tipped too much because I was so impressed!!!   I highly recommend Demetre for the desserts and the service. The atmosphere was great as well. Clean and trendy looking. And the desserts that passed us along the way looked amazing."}
{"text":"I visited this location with my sister for the first time since the store moved and from the time we enter to the time we left the experience was very impressive and enjoyable. Our host Anthony greated us and we immediately felt welcomed and excited to be there.He was very charming and inviting.  After being seated my sister and I were deciding on what to order and our waitress Cassandra was very helpful in sugesting what to ordert. She was very fun and helped create a good experience.  I orderdd the pomme pilot and enjoyed ever bit, it was exactly what I wanted.  The overall experience with the decor (very Alice in Wonderland) and all the employees was outstanding and I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Yummy yummy yummy Quite a big menu selection. Desserts and waffles are really really tasty. Restaurant itself is quite loud but not bad."}
{"text":"LITERALLY THE WORST SERVICE AND WASTE OF MONEY. No customer service super long wait to see a waiter. Had to ask twice for the bill. Never coming back to this Demetres"}
{"text":"Heaps of ice cream and other pieces of sweet goodness, mounted on a belgian waffle are always a must at Demetres. I've been coming here since I was 12 and it's just such a great place to get fat.   I usually get the rusty pelican... some chocolate and nutella stuff and maybe some brownies... chocolate sauce... caramel... who knows?! but it's amazeballsssssss. I do have to mention though, that I HATE whipped cream and maraschino cherries, so I always do without it when I go to Demetres (let the hate comments begin for my hate-relationship with whipped cream)  Service here isn't great, but I'm usually a happy camper when I'm eating sweets, so I can't really complain and the prices are great, so I'm still not going to complain. I did decide to venture outside of the Rusty Pelican one time and it wasn't a pleasurable experience. I had something with tiramisu ice cream at one point and it was nasty... and one time I had something with peanut ice cream... and that was even worse. If you're ever wondering what \"dry\" ice cream tastes and feels like... try the peanut ice cream... it was awful lol  Anywhos... I found my favorites and they never fail. Still a really great place to go, and they just renovated their outdated decor! :D"}
{"text":"This is the most popular dessert spot between Yonge and Bayview, along Eglintion Ave, which is right in the heart of 'uptown's downtown'.  It's a date destination. You will see small groups of friends and families at this location but it's a) definitately not geared towards children and b) has too many 2 seater booths at the back, to think otherwise! -lol  Demetres has a great selection of cakes, conveniently located in the front counter and a huge menu of crepes, icecream and an adventerous coffee / espresso bar.  As I said, you will see families in here but it's not a good idea, I've tried a couple times with my 2 young children and really, what 2 year old could be \"good\" when enticed by the cake display as you walk in, the aroma of desserts, coffee and nervous,sexual tension from the couples on a first date there! All that energy, combined with the sugar, said toddler wants to and will consume and well it's a bad combo."}
{"text":"Slightly more upscale than I may have expected, and nicely decorated. With that said, the menu was more expensive than I would've expected as well. My own order of a red velvet cheesecake was fairly reasonably priced and probably would've gone for the same rate at most other places, but other items on the menu - especially ice cream and sundaes were more than I would've guessed before seeing the menu.  I suppose you get fairly good value once you're aware that the portions are large - for example \"one scoop\" of ice-cream is actually a considerable amount. Virtually all the deserts I saw were were large portions as well. So I suppose it's good if you want a considerably large portion of dessert, or, you could simply share one with a date."}
{"text":"This is definitely not one of my favourite locations. My husband and I had gone for my birthday and we waited for almost an hour to get our dessert. I'd rather go to the location near Yorkdale mall as their service is better. In regards to the food, it tasted the same as all the other locations I have been too (not surprised considering its a chain)"}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite desert places! You can choose from plenty of options.   My personal favourite drink is the Machiatto with Belgian Milk Chocolate, definitely must try this! I also like DIY (do it yourself) option which allows me to choose between a wafflee or a crepe, my favourite scoop of ice cream and toppings.   The price is decent as the portions are big. Although, I don't like sharing my dessert, the portion is enough for two, especially if you go with the waffle option."}
{"text":"This location was the best out of all the Demetres i have been to. The decor is superb! I ordered the my regular, which was the Machiatto with the Belgian chocolate and the crepe and Roche ice cream and it was divine! Natasha was our waitress and she was amazing. She checked on us numerous times and was very accommodating.  No complaints!"}
{"text":"They have a perfect aroma of ice cream cone and waffles upon entering which is just delicious. We ordered crepe with the Roche ice cream. The ice cream was good but the crepe wasn't the best we had. Somehow we didn't like the brownie chunks which were a bit too chewy.   On the other hand The cheese cake was pretty delicious.   Ordered iced coffee in Nutella flavor. Which came not so cold but we asked the server to add more ice and blend it. It was great afterwards. Though you can't taste the shake if you try it after eating the too sweet ice creams. So wait a while to get the actual taste of the iced coffee. They need to add more iced coffee/frappe options in their menu.   Apparently they don't have anything with less sugar/no added sugar. So it's a bummer for someone looking for healthy alternatives. They did consider that one of our family member was pregnant and cut short the waiting time. It was packed as it was a Friday night.   Overall the experience was fun. It's a great place to just hangout with your family & friends!"}
{"text":"Crepes are large and delicious, space is large and comfty, service was slow and prices a bit steep vs other good creperies."}
{"text":"we went there for a birthday party 12+ people and even though we were very loud and noisy the staff kept being friendly to us. that was very sweet of them=)  also the food\desserts portions are humongous! so think twice before ordering one whole portion for yourself only. better share with a friend.  the best part - they brought separate bills to us! very few places actually do  that.."}
{"text":"Best red velvet cheesecake! The white chocolate ice cream that comes with it is amazing!"}
{"text":"Demetre is a decent dessert place for waffles, crepes and cakes. The quality is always consistent with great taste. The portions are big, so I always share with a friend. Sometimes I wish they had the option for smaller portions. Perhaps a choice between small and regular size, since not everyone come to have a dessert as their main course. So if you just finished a meal and want something small, I recommend sharing with a friend."}
{"text":"Went with the family the other night for desserts. Had the DIY Crepe with the white chocolate ice cream and toppings. Very big portion. I would recommend to share with someone.   Pros  Large portions Fresh fruits A little something for everyone.   Cons  The apple cider tasted like powdered cider. For that price, it should be real cider."}
{"text":"We have been coming to this location for about 3 years now. Each and evey time, Jason Jong (The general manager) provides  a one of kind customer service experience; He's always friendly with customers, has a welcoming attitude and goes above and beyond creating a positive memory which inturn insures customer loyalty. We absolutley recommend this specific location of caffe Demetre to desert lovers!  Dina from Richmond Hill"}
{"text":"I came here for late night waffles and ice cream with a couple of friends as we were in the area and had a sweet tooth craving. For what Caffe Demetre is, this location was not bad at all. Service was pretty quick and polite despite it being a busy Friday night and the atmosphere was cozy and clean. We were seated as quickly as possible and food was on the table within 15 minutes.   Caffe Demetre is known for their desserts and satisfactorily hits the spot when you have that one off urge to gorge yourself on waffles, ice cream, and a ridiculous amount of sweet toppings. The craftsmanship of the desserts really isn't anything phenomenal and the \"specials\" they offer aren't anything to call home about, but the portions are huge and it's a great spot to hang out with friends and share one dish (no seriously, one dish is going to be enough for 3-4 people I swear)."}
{"text":"Deserts are great! The last straw was awesome but the service sucks!!! Waited 20 mins to get the bill"}
{"text":"Went on a Friday afternoon and it wasn't busy. There were many tables free and quite a few people working there, but the service wasn't great. And not to mention, there were flies hovering here and there!! Some were even in the sugar packets.   With that aside, my friend ordered the Pomme Pilot ($11.25) and he loved it! I ordered a single scoop sundae called Choc This Way ($9.25). It was quite good and the servings were large.   This Caffe Demetres was very average and similar to the other chains that are scattered around the GTA. Nothing really spectacular and would've probably been a decent place to just chill and have desserts later in the night!"}
{"text":"Welcome to the 1980s. Loved the decade, Hate some of the attitude. With several tables and booths sitting open (guess saving for celebrities or worthy customers?) Told a 20 minute wait, with other patrons also sitting while tables sit unused. Not sure what message this place is trying to send. Too many other choices to spend money , and obviously the message is that serving customers is not as important as looking popular with wait time. Will not waste our time again. Rate 0 for poor customer service/relations."}
{"text":"If the owners of this Demetre's are on Yelp here's my message to you: You cannot run a dessert place as big as yours with just ONE server and ONE man making the crepes etcetera.  Stop being a scrooge and hire more employees.  Trust me, it can only BOOST your business!  I live in the East end, and there aren't many choices in terms of places to go for dessert save for bubble tea or Caf√© Mirage at Kennedy Commons.  Demetre's has always been a favourite of mine but unfortunately they have decided that Scarlem is not a place they want to open up shop.  Everything from being seated, to getting water, to getting our order, to getting the bill was wait wait wait!  I felt like donkey from Shrek going \"ooh pick me, ooh pick me....\"    The desserts here are always good.  You can't really screw up ice cream, store-bought cakes, and a simple crepe/waffle batter mixture.  However, if given the choice, I will not EVER come to this Demetre's.  I'd much rather drive up to Richmond Hill."}
{"text":"Omg i cannot believe it's close to my neighborhood. The place is nice, the servers are wonderful. And plus the desserts are divine! I love that they have cake and coffee combo (i ordered the decaf) cos it was late at night but i wanted to try it. i was contented with what i got. The cake was so desserts we so tasty with  a pretty generous serving. My new favorite dessert place in Danforth! And oh, they close at midnight"}
{"text":"Very cute store! Perfect to bring yourself and a nice book or date, bestfriend or family! Probably one of the best places to get dessert here in Toronto. They have wide variety of ice cream, crepes, waffles, hot drinks etc. It gets busy late in the evening when people come in after dinner!   Thanks for reading!"}
{"text":"Demetre's is always good for dessert. Something to hit up after dinner. My cousins and I got to try the one in Vaughan. When we walked in the place wasn't too busy, so we were able to get a table quickly. As we started to look over the menu, it slowly started to get busier as more people started to walk in. I ordered the Splitsonian on a waffle and my cousin order the same one on a crepe. You can never go wrong with Demetres. The waffle tasted amazing and the fruits were delicious. The ice cream was out of this world. I would definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Despite how busy it was, the customer service was very friendly and as efficient as possible. A table for 5 was ready for us in 5 minutes rather than the 15 mins they quoted us. Everything was delicious- food and drinks!  Will be back."}
{"text":"The service here sucks. We waited 45 mins for our order and then it was wrong. Very unsatisfied. Never coming back"}
{"text":"Awww yeah back again! Got the Belgian waffle this time (Fudgement Day). Washed it down with an overpriced, but fully satisfying mint green tea. This place is my absolutely favorite dessert place in the area, and perhaps all of Toronto that I've been to.  Bf got a sundae (which looked like a relatively smaller portion in comparison to my dessert) which was pretty delicious, too.  My critiques of the place are mainly the service and the \"rules\" of the establishment. Service is a little lacking for a place this small -- the waiters are hard to flag down after they get your initial order.   I don't know if the menu is outdated but, the \"no photography\" warning on each page is kind of weird. I'm pretty sure it's not enforced. And if it was, I'd be pretty turned off by the place. Anyway, I'll be backkkk!"}
{"text":"*Disclaimer* I try not review places in which time has passed since I had been there but it's unlikely I will be here again not because it was that bad but because im  not in the area alot. So with that take my review with cation  Cafe Demetre is one of those places I should avoid due to how expensive and rich their dessert are but its hard to resist since it tasty so good. I stop in because I noticed this was in the area and through the rain, I went. I didnt really want dessert but just grab a shake to go, and I did, I went with Shake and Awe, who doesnt like nutella milkshake. Since I didnt stay, I cant rate their table service but the two working were nice, quick and friendly and it was a great milkshake, definetly worth the trip. Wasnt too busy but this was around 6pm, so people could be having dinner not dessert but who knows. Dessert could be dinner."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday night with friend. Demetre is one of those places where you can satisfy your sugar cravings without feeling guilty bc everyone around you is doing the exact same thing! Good date night food that's affordable but not expensive enough to break the bank. Also good food for de-stress before Monday comes around.  Funny how this place can get just as busy as that Destiny place nearby. Would have given 5-stars if the chairs were more comfortable."}
{"text":"I came hear after watching a flick at the nearby Cineplex.  What really made my group decide on coming here was the fact that it was open late at night, whereas everything else, save for McD's, was already closed by 10 pm.  This place gets brownie points for that.   I've frequented the branches in downtown and central Toronto before, but they had revamped their menu this time around when I dined here.  There were new items, but by that same token, there was also a 1-2 dollar price increase, which is a little disappointing since each dessert is 15-20+ dollars after tax and tip, a hefty amount when there are so many other competing dessert restaurants (eg. cheap Asian dessert joints).   The saving grace is the variety on the menu and the portion size.  This place has an excellent array of sundaes, parfaits, crepes, Belgian waffles, cakes, and so forth - all the snazzy desserts you can possibly dream of that has anything to do with ice cream and a second stomach for sugar.  The staple is definitely the Belgian waffles, with the strawberry kind as my personal preference.  The staff loads up these bad boys with home-made or high quality ice cream and other toppings, making them large enough to share between two people.  However, this branch gave a smaller mountain of ice cream than what I had in the past (or maybe there are new regulations on this), so if you're good with sugar, you can probably finish one by yourself.  Service: They have very friendly staff members (my server even knew who Hatsune Miku was when she saw my friend's phone cover - extra brownie points there!)   Atmosphere: This place is usually packed, but the sofa rounds and other seating areas make it a nice place to chill with your friends after a meal or a great place for a date.  If you don't want to seem cheap on a date, pass on the bubble tea places and come to one of these branches instead!"}
{"text":"I haven't been to Demetre's in a while.  My kids love this place way too much.  For my birthday my wife and I came here after dinner.  There was a line, but we were seated in about 15 min.  Since it had been a while we had forgotten just how big the portion sizes are.  I had ordered the Fridges of Madison County (chocolate cake with ice cream) and my wife ordered a brownie with ice cream.  Both servings were huge.  Each came with at least 500ml of ice cream on the side.   In reality we would have been better off sharing one dessert between the two of us.  Of course portion size doesn't matter in as much as taste.  Well I tell you thise was great.  I loved the cake and the ice cream.  We ended up taking about half of our desserts home with us!  We will definitely repeat when the next opportunity presents itself."}
{"text":"Pretty spacious inside with updated d√©cor.  Greek music plays in the background with large black and white photos hanging on the walls.  It IS a good place to get your share of sweets and calorie-busting treats, and its usually pretty good.  The service, however, is atrocious!  I think my neck got stiff just from turning side to side looking for our server, on multiple occasions.  I would stick with the crepes, as I don't think their waffles are very tasty at all."}
{"text":"Okay, so there is a time to come to Demetres. My friend and I always come here in the afternoon to beat the evening rush. The place is empty and the server's are attentive. Of course you can expect rushed service when there are about 50 other people around you. I love Fudgment Day on waffle and the brownie cheesecake dish, whose name I always forget.  4 stars just for the dessert alone."}
{"text":"If you go any days amazing. I went on a Friday night and my Crepe was so hard and nasty. I guess because it was busy .."}
{"text":"I love their chocolate fudge cake! Get the Cocoa Ono, they warm up the slice of cake and give you a delicious scoop of vanilla ice cream. One of my favourite places to get cake!"}
{"text":"I have been here and at the danforth location since my  lastest visit was here. I leave my review here. Their selection is unbelievable, on top of wide range of selection, you can even create your own if you arent wanting anything of precombined choices. I had, the cake, sundae (ice cream) and even the waffe dessert combos.   Cant go wrong with any of it. Thou most of it really rich and filling but yeah. The serving are fair in size so it's not so bad, it enough to be filling after dinner treat.   Price maybe a bit much but I think its worth it. It's price point is only thing stopping me from giving it at 5 star.  Also it does get busy at time, not a huge place so Friday, and weekend night it is usually packed and you will have to wait to get a table."}
{"text":"What Demetre lacks in service, it makes up in selection of desserts. There are so many delectable treats to choose from! From Oreo Sundaes and Cappuccino Cheesecake to Dessert Coffees and Specialty Milkshakes!   I opted for an Oreo Sundae (I mean, if you're at a dessert place then eat a proper dessert!) and it was divine! I got them to add in some strawberries and it was probably my best decision of the day (clearly it wasn't a decision making type of day). I also tried their chocolaty coffee, which my friend ordered - and while it was a bit too chocolaty for my taste and I can see chocolate aficionados loving it!  The service wasn't that great - but I mean once you get your dessert, are you really paying attention to anything else? It's a 3.5 star kind of place."}
{"text":"We visited this chain restaurant meant for desserts a second time and liked it."}
{"text":"As usual, 20 to 30 minutes of waiting time on a weekend. Ice creams were good, but meant more for youngsters due to calories and sugar content.  Would recommend anyone to go there once as it is a chain especially meant for Desserts, although this one was not as spacious as the one we visited in midtown Toronto near Yonge & Eglington, but had a better parking lot then the one in midtown, where parking is a challenge."}
{"text":"I have tried several Demetre locations throughout the GTA, and must say this one ranks best for their service, never run into problems with the staff and never had anything to complain about.   Love their ice cream crepes, had to limit myself from visiting this place as I was becoming too much of a regular. (This is probably not the best idea since it is an ice cream place after all)."}
{"text":"Waiter was very nice. Food was huge and fresh and very tasty. Would go again. Definetly a place to go and split a dessert. So many options."}
{"text":"Years ago, I swore I would never go to Demetre again. On this evening, I was with a friend who was on the polar opposite side of the scale as me. She swore by this place, and said it was the greatest place ever and she goes often. So I figured I would give it a shot considering it had been literally years since my last visit.  It was a Sunday night and fairly late, so the place was basically empty. We were seated and served immediately. I ordered the Pomme Pilot on a waffle and she ordered The Fork Awakens. Our hot beverages came quickly and the waffles didn't take long.  The waffle was fresh, hot, and incredible. I was motivated to find SOMETHING to complain about to prove my point about how horrible this place was years ago, but I couldn't find anything. The ice cream was fresh and creamy, the toppings were fresh, and the service was great.  I was reviewing this Yelp page when we arrived to read some of the horrible reviews that it got, basically as a way of reinforcing my point on how I disliked this place previously, but most of the complaints are unwarranted. It clearly states there is a minimum $5 charge per person... you cannot go here, order hot water, and expect to loiter in a restaurant for free. I understand that poor service affects your experience, but typically the people who work at Demetre are young students... these are not the stakeholders or backbone of the company.  Anyway, my opinion has changed. Demetre and I are friends again!"}
{"text":"Caffe Demetre is probably one of my favourite dessert places! It is a bit on a pricier side, but once in a while, it is worth it ;).   Pastries are all freshly baked and the combination of desserts is very nice :) I will definitely come back!  What we ordered:  1. Waffle with chocolate ice cream and strawberries (Don't remember the name, unfortunately).  2. Chocolate Fudge Brownie with Belgian Chocolate Sauce.   Pro-Tip:  Share your dessert, you will probably not be able to finish the entire dessert yourself."}
{"text":"It must be the allure of The Danforth and the fact that this was a place frequented in my youth, as this location is my go to, regardless how close I am to the other franchises.   Oftentimes we purposely leave room just to enjoy the atmosphere but more so their array of desserts!"}
{"text":"I love their wide array of choices, and their portions. Invariably our group always over order - all good!   Personally, I prefer this location to all others because of ease of parking, and the mood, decor and overall atmosphere here.  Don't be surprised if you need to wait for a little while for a table."}
{"text":"Much better service Sat night even though they were packed.  We waited 5 min, seated,  ordered and had desserts -all within an hour  Great service,  good desserts  Ice cream and cheesecake is always a great combo!"}
{"text":"I was there 20mins ago, but bad service ever. I didn't expect like this horrible services and terrible manners. Got ruined my day. I couldn't order anything during 40mins. When we got seated, nobody serves to us, No cares, No servers, worst of worst service ever. Actually, it wasn't look like a busy when I saw other tables. So, I was look at some servers, but nobody cares. They were look like \"I'm not your server\". Terrible service ever and I got wasted my time and so embarrased and was so horrible experience ever. When I complained about this to server(maybe manager), she said only \"sorry\". That's it. If I were she, I wouldn't say only \"sorry\". At least, I would explain the situations and tried to make guest 100% satisfaction. However, she looked  like \"I don't care you will come back or not. because we are busy enough and everyone likes this place\". Don't want to recommend this horrible place. Worst of worst service ever. Hope their manager and their owner can read this. Because of them, I joined this yelp app today right away."}
{"text":"Worst service! Last few times I've been here, the service has been terrible, but since the next closest Demetres has been closed. I've brushed off the bad service since the dessert has always been great, but this time my boyfriend and I gave them 20 minutes to even bring us a water or come get our order, before we got fed up and left."}
{"text":"Substantially good food, little on the expensive side but good quality. Haifa was our server and we LOVED her! Overall good experience!"}
{"text":"Mixed feelings about this place. Food for the most part is good, service is hit or miss. Prices don't reflect the quality of the food anymore"}
{"text":"They kept the windows open near the kitchen area, mosquitos were flying around while we were waiting. After waiting a while for our crepes, and finishing most of mine.... I noticed something in my crepe.... Yeah it was a mosquito cooked into my crepe. Told the manager and he didn't charge us for it, still left a bad taste in my mouth"}
{"text":"After speaking with the new owner, Padra, I have decided to remove my review, which was of an experience from more than 7 years ago.   I don't believe in punishing people from someone else's poor business management."}
{"text":"Came here while visiting family in the area. Highly recommended by them. They had several vegan options - opted for the Ariana Sundae. It was absolutely delicious! Definitely on my list for when I go back to the area. Highly recommend for their desserts and even better for some vegan options."}
{"text":"The bf took me here as a treat since I was visiting. Came around 10 PM and boy was it PACKED. I didn't think that many people would be out at this time. We didn't have to wait more than 10 minutes.   Once we were seated it took me awhile to figure out what I wanted exactly. Seeing that the menu is quite large, I was told that everything was great. I ended up choosing the scoop dogg. Since it didn't come in a single scoop, I thought I could handle the 2 scoop on my own. It was great!...until the end it got quite sweet and I ended up ordering a coffee to cut the sweetness.   I'd definitely come back again to try some of their other desserts."}
{"text":"My wife and I went to Cafe Demetre based upon a recommendation and we were completely underwhelmed. The server started off as indifferent that we were there, then downshifted to almost ignoring us. There were only three tables occupied in the place and the server was completely focused upon socializing with one of the tables. We ordered waffles. I could see the kitchen staff making them and taking them off the grill and setting them on to the shelf for the waitress to pick up...the waitress was zoned out doing busy work and socializing. Once she eventually brought our order to us the waffles were cold. They weren't great. We may as well have stayed home and had Eggos! This place is poorly managed, overpriced and we won't be back."}
{"text":"Came here after dinner with a friend and my fiance.   We were greeted quickly and our orders were promptly taken.   My fiance got an earl grey tea. My friend and I got the tongue depressor crepe and I ordered a side of mango sorbet for the fiance. It's called a wrecking ball, in case you're wondering and it costs $4, which isn't bad for good quality ice cream, or in this case, sorbet. Huge scoop.  The tea came with a beautiful presentation. It even came with a little information card about earl grey tea (where it was discovered, who drank it, if it's caffeinated, etc). My fiance asked for honey with his tea and our server gladly got it for him.   The tongue depressor crepe comes with brownie pieces, dark chocolate ice cream, white chocolate buttons, and a chocolate drizzle. Total indulgement. Generous scoop of ice cream and a fair amount of toppings. My friend and I couldn't finish the crepe.    I love how we are given chocolate when the bill comes. As if we didn't just eat enough sweets, here's another sweet for you to eat!   I loved the decor of this location. Very eclectic and just fun. Nice, victorian style couches with funky clocks everywhere. Like, who thinks of these things?! And the servers wear suspenders. Um, adorable!"}
{"text":"When I am hankering for a sinful late night dessert Demetre's is always near the top of my list because they will always have something to satisfy my ENORMOUS sweet tooth.   I have been to this location a few times and have always had a pleasant experience. On my most recent visit a friend and I came here after dinner to indulge in some dessert. The place was barely half full since it was a weekday evening, I have been here on weekends and they do get pretty busy. My friend and I decided to share a waffle and the task of choosing the waffle was left up to me, I decided to venture away from my first love (their nutella ice cream) and go for the \"life sentence\" waffle. This waffle came with peanut butter ice cream, chocolate brownie pieces, bananas and chocolate sauce. No need to adjust your computer screen, you read the succession of ingredients correctly. I suppose they call it the \"life sentence\" because if you ever finish one on your own it will take a lifetime of exercise to burn it off.   Our waffle took a while to be made but was definitely worth the wait. OMFG the peanut butter ice cream was ridiculous, not only did it have an intense peanut butter flavour but also had whole peanuts and chocolate chunks in it, it was over the top delicious. The brownie pieces were quite decadent (but a little heavy) and bananas are always a great compliment to peanut butter. The waffle came in a cute flower shape; it was crunchy on the outside and fluffy inside. This was probably the most well put together waffle I have had at any Demetre's, the single scoop of ice cream was ginormous and looked like 3 scoops had morphed into 1 mega scoop, the other toppings were piled on generously which made this ideal for sharing and more than justified the $13 price tag.   The service here has always been good and in my experience they are willing to accommodate any special requests. As many have noted the d√©cor at this particular location is quite dated, they are also lacking a patio which the Markham location has.  This place is easily accessible by car or transit and is a great destination for all kinds of desserts. Now excuse me while I go grab some insulin"}
{"text":"Caffe Demetre you had me at Nutella Ice Cream!   Remember those days when your parents wouldn't let you skip eating your veggies and go straight to dessert? Well if you're ever in the mood to rebel against your parents head to Caffe Demetre where you can go straight to dessert... dessert heaven that is!    This place has a dessert menu that would make any sugar junkies head spin. They have crepes, waffles, sundaes, cakes, pies, fancy coffees (iced and hot), so basically everything your inner child desires. My personal favourites are their waffles; freshly made Belgian waffles topped with ice cream and assorted toppings (everything from fruit to brownies). You can choose to have one of their pre-conceived combinations or you can feel free to design your own. The waffles themselves are crispy on the outside but beautifully fluffy inside. My personal favourite is their rusty pelican (nutella ice cream, chocolate sauce, and nuts) mmmm I want one now!   I've also had their sundaes which are HUGE too and also quite decadent. I believe they make their ice cream in house and they do have some intriguing flavours (my favourite is the nutella; I'm dying to go back and try the peanut butter). With their sundaes and crepes you can choose a pre-set combination or design your own. All their desserts will run you around $8-10 dollars and are well worth it as they are delicious and quite large.   This particular location has a pretty large patio, and is quite bright and clean on the inside. You cannot beat the location (404 and 7), and this is a great place to go after dinner or simply if you are craving something sinfully sweet. Service has always been good at this location and I will definitely keep coming back!"}
{"text":"I was in the area and craving a waffle so I decided to drop by Demetres. It's an establishment that I've been visiting since I was young so it's usually a safe choice. I ordered the \"Moo la la\" waffle which had Roche ice cream, banana, pralines and Nutella. The waffle was was delicious...very rich and filling (I shared it, I can never finish my own). However, the desserts here are quite pricey and at $15 a waffle, there are many other alternatives."}
{"text":"Been there twice and received the worst service both times. They had riculous wait times. The serving staff obviously don't know what they're doing. We left after sitting for 20 mins and no one acknowledged us. Some of the wait staff were just standing around and waiting for their order. I have never had this issue at the Etobicoke location. The servers need to be better trained."}
{"text":"This place was awful- they had no cake available, the service was slow, they had no pop, and it was expensive. The desser- belgian waffle with apple crisp was decent overall."}
{"text":"I've been to AMC location before, moved closer to this one now. Service is a bit slow but the girl was friendly. I like their crepes more than the other stuff they offer. I do find them a bit prices and loaded with cream. Besdies that, an ok place for sweets."}
{"text":"Demetres is one of those classic dessert restaurants that everyone used to go to after a late night movie or for a late night snack. My last visit was 5 years ago at the exact same location. It was a cute, popular little gem in the heart of Woodbridge.  We went yesterday after a movie at Colossus hoping for some late night dessert. We got there promptly at 11:30pm and it was as busy as ever by mostly teenagers. We waited about 5 minutes for someone to seat us, but we were told that they were no longer seating anyone because they stop accepting guests 20 minutes early (meanwhile we were still there 25 minutes early). Then she mentioned that they were all university students and have lots of work to do  for the next 2 days which was very inappropriate. Thankfully we spoke to the manager and told him we came early and he told us we could stay.  We were seated in a comfortable area even though the whole place was packed. People were still receiving their desserts while we were sitting. The manager was  kind enough to apologize and handled the situation very well and for that reason I gave this location a 3 stars. Overall, our encounter with the girl in the front left a bitter taste in our mouth. The crepes were just as good as they were before. Had we not talked to her I would have rated this place a 4. There is a new menu,  a nice vibe, but just needs better customer service."}
{"text":"My first visit in many years, my first to this location. I felt that interior was cute, or used to be cute, when it was new?! It Felt a little Old And out dated. First impression was also a little bit of a turn off because Most of the tables were very dirty.  We sat and waited for our waiter for many 5 Minutes to bring our menus ( there Was One other table there) The waiter was Pleasant, he took our order, and later We politely mentioned that the tables around seemed a bit dirty...  Although a while later, he did come Out and wash every single One!)  We all enjoyed our drinks and dessert although the place is not gluten free or friendly, I was ok to have the cappuccino, it was very smooth and frothy sprinkled with chocolate powder. One of the bat I've had in a while!"}
{"text":"If you like desserts...this is a good place to go and enjoy...they have tons of choices with ice cream, chocolate and fruits!  The fruits are always fresh which I really like, but I am not a fan of their chocolates. We also have to wait in line to sit which it's a little bit annoying!"}
{"text":"Simply went to order strawberries and Belgium waffles for takeout did so why i wait over 10 minutes until 2 staff members completed their conversation before receiving my order?  Like seriously where is customer service going these days?  Never is it acceptable for a customer to wait while you and your girlfriend discuss trivial things! I am the only one allowed to waste my time,  not some inconsiderate restaurant employee, especially when I've paid MY money!  Food was good though,  but let's try to improve the service."}
{"text":"Went to this place on a friday night, and it was packed to the brim. Been to many cafe demetre's over the years to many different location, and i think the standard has been pretty consistent over the years.  The The ice cream at cafe demetre's for their waffle and crepe deserts is very much unique. They house specialty ice cream flavors, which is always a great sign, and was very good. I had the Silk Belgian white chocolate ice cream, and my other party member had the Salted Carmel pecan Ice cream flavor. we each did something different, i did the crepe, and she did waffle.   The Waffle and crepes had great balance of toppings and the scoop size was a good portion for the waffle size, they definitely make sure you have enough ice cream to fill it up. Overall the service was decent, it was what you expected from a desert place. The only issue was that the seating is a bit cramped as i noticed along with my table a lot of people had their chair right up against each other and could barely move when its back to back with another table. i understand they are trying to fit more people into the desert place. However perhaps a simplier method could just be arranging the tables better for the fit. Also the crepes/waffles were on the pricier side expect to pay around 30 something for 1 crepe and 1 waffle   Overall this place gives you a consistent to be applauded and i would recommend friends go if they want to splurge a little"}
{"text":"First time here. Walk in and got a warm welcome. We had a table of 10 and it didn't take long to get it. The dessert was very big! Although it pricey but they gave you a lot. Overall this is a nice place to hang to have desert!"}
{"text":"We visited at 9pm on a Friday. It was very crowded, so we weren't expecting stellar service, but it took about 20 minutes to get our coffee, and the waiter entirely forgot to put our order in the system, so we were not served until well after several larger parties that were seated well after us. It took another 10 minutes to get a refill on the coffee, and I had to ask for water twice before finally receiving two filthy glasses of water. One glass had water stains that looked like it had been sitting on its side in stagnant, dirty dish water for quite some time. Overall, it took over an hour to get a sundae, a waffle, and two coffees, and finally the bill. The vanilla ice cream was freezer burned, but otherwise the food was fine. Just not worth the $30."}
{"text":"My favorite dessert place in toronto. With the renovation the place has a new, clean and modern look that is tasteful and a tiny bit artsy. The ice cream is truly Toronto's best. It is home made and very rich and creamy. The portions are huge and the creeps are made to order. The service is just ok (slightly understaffed so it can be slow), but friendly, polite and helpful.  I highly recommend Demetre's for their ice cream, waffles, crepes, and coffees."}
{"text":"Such a delicious crepe place.  We got the Smithsonian crepe and it was packed with strawberries, bananas, ice cream and whipped cream.  The chocolate drizzle was so delicious on top of the dish.  We did also add brownie bits to the dish as well and it was well worth the $2.  The only reason it's not a 5 star review Is because we had to wait 15-20 minute wait for a table that we realized it was available the entire time."}
{"text":"If I could put 0 stars I would.  Just had the worst experience at the Richmond Hill East Beverly Creek branch.  I normally wouldn't post a complaint but my whole family just got yelled at be Eric \"the store manager.\"   After waiting 30min for a table for our party of 6 where he let 3 separate parties of 4 bud the line before us.  We asked if we could sit separately at two tables to accommodate him and he yelled at us at the top of his lungs with a violent expression saying \"DON'T TELL  ME HOW TO DO MY JOB !!!\"  I have never been so embarrassed and insulted in my life.  My younger cousin is also injured in crutches and had to sit behind a poll as we waited and he payed no attention to that fact.   He also let other people who came later go before us and one member with a party of 5 squished together and even blocked the walkway which he earlier claimed was the reason for not seating us.  He could've easily pushed two of the earlier free tables together to accommodate us but instead gave it to another two separate  parties.  When we asked why he was letting people go before us he angrily old us \"don't make the situation worse\".  I acknowledge that there may be a store policy not to move tables but his behavior and attitude was unacceptable. I also have a video of him yelling at my family from the outside.  I had to step outside because he looked violent.  I have no idea what type of training,  or lack there of,  occurs when your companies hires and trains managers.  But this experience has left me shocked and disgusted and our family will never go back.  His arrogance and attitude was aggressive and uncalled for.  I would advise the owner to review security tapes to see if it caught his expression and threatening words towards us.  This is coming from someone who is usually very tolerant,  but the lack of respect and dignity with which my family was treated was disgusting.  I am not even sure if he is the real manager because his lack of professionalism in a service job seems unlikely.  The incident of occurred today March 16 between 9:00pm to 9:30."}
{"text":"This location sucks, we ordered drinks to go and it took 30 MINUTES to get them to our table. Mind you one of them was an iced coffee and that took 40 minutes and it was just milk with a bit of coffee. I wouldn't recommend especially if you're in a rush."}
{"text":"Really good quality food with big portions. Great choice for celebration or to get together. The shakes are a little expensive but good though."}
{"text":"This location is quite busy and it's kind of ghetto compared to the Brampton location or the bigger one in Mississauga. It's not that bad that we're kind of annoyed right now so maybe were just having a worse time than everyone else. My husband loves the moo la la so we usually get that each time we come. We decided to get the splitsonian this time with cocoa chanel and it was so good.  I got a Nutella macchiato and husband got the basic brew. Not bad."}
{"text":"This location was nice and big and as usual was very busy for a Friday night. We got seated fairly quickly for having such a long wait after only waiting in line for about 10 minutes. We got our menus fairly quickly but we waited for quite a while to order our dessert and then for our dessert to come. When it was time to pay we kept asking our waitress for the bill and it took her about 30 minutes to finally bring it over which it was quite a disappointment. She was really nice but she was slammed for the night so it's not fair to her either but we are really disappointed in the service because we've been here numerous times and we've always had great service."}
{"text":"I tried the Belgian waffle with Nutella, vanilla ice cream and strawberry which I halved with my companion.  It was just the right size and was so incredibly delicious!! I am not a sweets/dessert loving person, but when I'm around an area with a Demetre's, I want to go in and eat there! Dessert of my dreams! The place was pretty empty when I went, the service wasn't quick and it took awhile to get acknowledged and to put in our order, but they did deliver on a timeline. This Demetres is right by the movie theatre so we advised that we are on a timeline to watch a show. I definitely recommend the Belgian waffle with Nutella and strawberries!!!"}
{"text":"Came in here on a Saturday night after having dinner in the area in a restaurant that did not offer dessert. Ordered the Brownie Points for 2 (Salted Caramel Fudge Brownie Cheesecake * Cocoa Chanel Iced Cream * Salted Caramel Sauce) when I was initially thinking of ordering that + a slice of cheesecake (which they had run out of). This could've turned into a true rookie mistake because the one dish was more than enough for both of us. The cheesecake was delicious and the ice cream tasted like pure cocoa heaven. Our waitress was really friendly and full of energy. I'd definitely come back to try something else on the menu."}
{"text":"I had an excellent experience here! Everything was incredible. From the moment I walked in the hostess Tanya was so kind and helpful. We had a huge party and thought we would never be able to be seated, but Tanya took care of us quickly and calmly. Their crepes and waffles are to DIE for!!! I definitely see myself coming back!"}
{"text":"This place used to be good. I think a chinese lady bought the location so the standards have changed. They burnt my crepe and tried to hide it by placing the burnt side on the inside and covering it up with all the ice cream and toppings. I can still taste it, genius. How hard is it to mAke a new crepe. If you screwed up just make a new one so I don't have to be here writing a review and complaining about it.   But like I said before, the standards have changed and the restaurant itself is not maintained and kept as clean and nice as it was before."}
{"text":"Where do I start ? I've been here many times in the past and the service gets worse and worse. Party of three arrived at the door. Hostess and waiter Tylen were the only good thing that happened on this visit. We were quoted 30 minutes wait, it ended up being 15. Great ! Our waiter Tylen came by and was very personable and happy, unlike the rest of the waiters we've had to deal with. We ordered a tea with milk and a latte. Tea arrived without milk and had to wait for it. Ordered a simple cheesecake and strawberries, crepes with banana and Nutella and a banana split. Cheesecake arrived, 15 minutes went by and nothing else arrived. Two waiters walked by asking how everything was , both times we told them we were missing two out of three dishes. Their  answer, \" it's coming \". 35 minutes went by and I got fed up with waiting so I told the other waiter working to cancel my banana split. Latte was cold and almost finished. No apologies but just a simple \" oh I see it, it's there\". Tylen came later on to apologize and told us that 3 out of 4 \"cooks \" in the kitchen were brand new and had never worked on a Friday night during rush hour. Experience was once again ruined since only two out of three people ended up having desert. Bill came and they had the audacity to charge me for the only thing I had at their establishment, my $7.00 latte. The crepes were discounted but considering it was me who didn't get to enjoy the dessert, it was very disappointing. Here are some pointers Cafe Demetre's . Coming from somebody who works at real restaurant where we take pride of what we do and and the products we serve, take notes : * if you indeed are running a weak kitchen for the night with 3 out of 4 so called cooks, inform the customers, so at least we know what's happening behind the curtains as we wait for almost 45 minutes for a simple dessert.  * in our order in particular, two out of the three items were cold items, why not just make the crepes first and once the crepes are ready, place the frozen cheesecake with the strawberries on a plate... as the other one scoops three ice cream scoops, slice a banana and puts some whipped cream on top and send everything together at the same time. It's not rocket science.   I understand that maybe our expectations were a bit higher, I mean... who expects to get all desserts to arrive at the same time so all guests get to enjoy them. But due to the Mickey Mouse operation they seem to be running at this so called restaurant, this was my last visit. I want to end this review with praising the Hostess working yesterday and Tylen of course who couldn't have apologized enough for the screw up. His colleague ( chubbier version of Tylen ) needs a lesson on customer service and customer recovery as well."}
{"text":"Please is a little chaotic and the service a little lacking, what I mean by that is ..... Lack of it and not friendly   Asked for water got Half a glass of room temperature water   The ice cream and waffles were good however it took 35 mins to get them..... I don't even expect that time for a steak"}
{"text":"Came here this afternoon (12.23.10).  For a good hour, we were the only patrons in the establishment. I will give them the benefit of the doubt as it was mid-day on a weekday.  The menu is extensive with various desserts - ice cream, crepes, waffles etc. I decided to start with an espresso, while I contemplated getting something sweet. As we passed the hour mark, a couple of other patrons entered. They ordered a crepe so I decided to hold off on my decision until their desserts arrived. They are massive... to the point of not enjoying it. One could say, 'take it home.' Sadly with ice cream you can't really put it into a brown paper bag and have it for lunch the next day. I ordered a double shot of espresso, but it was so weak ... it was so watered down that it was more like an Americano.  I only came here because I was invited. My date didn't compliment the place so I'm assuming they had the same thoughts as me."}
{"text":"Just give me one of everything! This is my happy place , my go-to when I'm having a bad day. I literally have dreams about the dolce banana waffle. Great place to kill time before the movies.   Portion sizes are massive. I'm dreading the day they decide to add the calorie count to the menu   Prices are pretty decent and service is always quick and friendly.   Expect a line up on Friday/Saturday nights. (Usually moves pretty quickly)."}
{"text":"Waffle and crepe galore perfect for teenagers to hang out and eat delicious desserts.   Coming in on a Friday night, their store is packed and we waited approximately 15 minutes in line for a seat, rather crammed in my opinion. Their names for their desserts are very creative - e.g. Moo La La, Interstella, Tongue Depressor, etc. Most of the prices are approximately $10-$15 for one waffle or one crepe. I didn't realize how expensive that was until I grew older and had to pay for my own bills.   Their crepes and waffles are made very well, but for a place that specializes in desserts, I feel like they're waffles and crepes lacked a secret mystery kind of taste to it. There are secret ingredients that I know of to enhance the taste of the waffle and crepe, making it smell and taste much better than regular ingredients.   The portion of these dishes are huge as well! Definitely a giant scoop of ice cream topped with delicious brownies or strawberries with sauce drizzled nicely over and sprinkled with icing sugar. Come in and give Demetres a try, it's pricey, but definitely a big portion."}
{"text":"Ambiance is perfect, servers are friendly & efficient, the ice cream & crepes are really good! I just find the cakes here a bit too sweet. If they can tone down the sugar on those, it would be perfect. Otherwise a very good dessert place, will come back for more!"}
{"text":"Amazing. I've been here many times but went here last night for the first time in years. Ordered one if the crepes. Very tasty and well presented. It was pretty busy for a Sunday evening. We ended up seating ourselves and we had to ask for the bill. No refills on water either. Overall I'm really satisfied with the desserts. The customer service is a bit lacking but I let it go because they were so busy. Will definitely go again."}
{"text":"they don't have maple ice cream anymore!  Anyway, I shared a waffle (fudgement day) with a friend (about $15-16) because portions are large. i don't think it was worth the price in my opinion. The waffle itself is amazing- light and fluffy, the way it should be and chocolate drizzles and chips are crunchy but the vanilla ice cream is thick, gooey and doesn't taste like vanilla at all to me. Bananas were okay, thinly slice, nothing special. I don't think i'll choose this combo again, probably a different flavour or just a plain waffle.  they were so busy that they didn't have time to wait us. It's a sat night so it got really busy at 9:30. good thing we went at 7:30pm and there was no line up."}
{"text":"Haven't been to a demetre's in a while. Stumbled upon this branch with my coworkers. Place was very noisy and very warm inside. Service wasn't the greatest.  We must have waited 20 to 30 minutes to even order.  It was just hard to move to another place since we were a party of 11 and we were  done having dinner.   Half of the group ordered 1 scoop sundaes that supposed to have a waffle cone with it. Half of us had no waffle cone because they ran out of waffle cone batter. This was only around 9pm so it wasn't like they were closing soon.  Thank goodness for the great company that made up for the dining experience."}
{"text":"When I heard Parental Unit 1' declare that we would be going out to Caffe Demetre before dinner, I knew that this place was going to pack a punch. You have to go hungry if you have any hope of finishing your dinner-sized serving of dessert.   Although we were a big group and hadn't made reservations, we were seated tout de suite. My second positive impression was the plenty pun-ny menu. I was told by veterans that this establishment is known for its decadently topped crepes and waffles and these were what the majority of our party ordered. It was difficult but I opted not to go for the chocolate options since that flavor was covered several fold by the other orders. Thus I settled on the waffle version of the Pomme Pilot which is topped with white chocolate ice cream. Indeed, although the ice cream could easily have been mistaken for vanilla, it definitely didn't taste like it and had a straightforward sugary taste. This item was also topped with a caramel/toffee crumble whose texture contrasted nicely with the fluffy waffles and creamy ice cream. The tastes I had of the other orders (Sweetcare Named Devour, Interstella and Tongue Depressor) were equally good. Personally I think the waffles are a better option than crepes because they soak up the ice cream and prevent a milky puddle in your plate.  The portions are not large. They are extra, extra large and the prices reflect this fact. If what you're looking for is dessert after an already sumptuous meal, kidnap 2 friends and share one order. Otherwise, prepare yourself to eat a week's worth of dessert in one sitting.   Overall, this was the best dessert venue I've ever been to. It was certainly worth the hype I had been hearing about for over five years!"}
{"text":"Frequented this place years ago but just visited again and had quite an experience.   Waited 20 mins before a server came around to ask us about our order. Waited another 20 mins before the server came back, but they were out of certain ingredients for our orders. He could've mentioned this before our orders were placed. Had to order something else at that point and we waited another 20 minutes for our supplement order to come.    When our order did come, there was a a huge piece of plastic in our sundae.   I spoke with the manager (Matea) and I told her about our situation. She quickly resolved the issue and apologized for the actions of her server and waived our bills.   Overall, the place is overrated and quite overpriced for the dessert that you get."}
{"text":"Came here for late night dessert and the service was good. Ordered a 2 scoop ice cream: Roche and coco Chanel. My friends both ordered crepes. The presentation was very good, whip cream with a fresh cherry on top... Not the preserved kind. Overall was a good treat, hard to finish by yourself so share if you can. Parking is a bit of an issue, street parking is all I saw and there was construction too. Service picked up a lot around 10pm. First time being there during a birthday song so that was very startling because it was so loud and random."}
{"text":"Caffe Demetre is a regular dessert spot for my friends and I. We've been here so many times it would be virtually impossible to count. Talk about calories, each menu item probably has enough sugar to put you into a coma! However that would be one sweeet coma.  My favourite is a dessert called Moo-La-La, which is full of chocolaty goodness. Add a cappuccino onto that order and it is, how you say, parfait.   What I love about this place is that they make their own ice cream on site. Yes that's right. The following is an excerpt from their website:  \"Each Caff√© Demetre has been set up with equipment to prepare and harden ice cream in small batches using Caff√© Demetre original recipes.  While ice cream is extracted from the machines, inclusions such as nuts and chocolate chips are added in.  Real cream and a lower amount of sugar are used to make a formulated mix which is pasteurized and homogenized \"to spec\" for Caff√© Demetre by a local dairy. During our manufacturing process we freeze our mix with flavours, emulsions, real melted chocolates and other \"goodies\" to create the smoothest ice cream imaginable.  Then we take the finished product and fast-freeze it overnight, down to -40 degrees F.  The next day the ice cream is tempered to a \"scoopable\" consistency and served in our cafes.  Because the product is not exposed to \"heat shock\" (melting and refreezing -many times over when ice cream sits on loading docks and truck bays -such as store bought ice cream) it remains smooth, rich and creamy.  Our stores currently make 65,000 litres of Ice Cream annually.  Our Iced Cream is truly an artisan product and we take great pride in making it for you.\"  I'm all about quality, and Caffe Demetre is just that."}
{"text":"Great Waffles, tasty toppings - do not forget the icecream :)"}
{"text":"The food is over priced... and wait it LOOONNGGG. So if your willing to spend your money and wait go ahead!"}
{"text":"Before I explain my experience, I want to stress that this location deserves 0 stars. My friend and I were ongoing customers at the York Blvd location before it closed down recently, so we decided to try the Richmond Hill location. First off, we walked into the location with not a single staff noticing us while we waited there patiently. After about 5 minutes or so, the manager Majid, quickly sits us down and disappears behind the counter. My friend and I waited for 20 minutes before we flagged down a waiter, then realizing the table beside us who was waiting before us had been waiting to be served as well. ( ridiculous) After waiting for another 20 minutes for our desserts, they were finally delivered to our table to find that our ice creams were melted and our crepes were cold and hard. Needless to say my friend and I are not impressed whatsoever at the lack of service and care they put into this location. I am extremely disappointed and I advise anyone who is thinking of trying this location to refrain at all costs, unless you want to waste your money on terrible food and horrible customer service. The manager could have done a better job at communicating with his staff to have this location run a lot smoother. Moreover, I was appalled at how miserable the manager was who completely disregarded other customers needs and requests. DO NOT COME TO THIS LOCATION."}
{"text":"This is a great place for sugary sweet desserts! They have a great selection of crepes and waffles, as well as cakes. Compared to the Demetre's in Burlington, the cake selection at this place was limited. I went for the strawberry and creme crepe. Soooo tasty...a good serving size that can be shared between two. I think the crepe was around $10-12.   I was here on a Saturday around 11pm. Easy to get a seat even though the place was busy. They are open till 130am so a great alternative to the bar.  To note, the washrooms are gross. Could really invest in renovating them!"}
{"text":"I had a really bad experience at this location. First of all when we were entering through the door the waitress kicked us out and told us to use the other door when we were basically inside. So we left and used the other door. We were surged and given the menu. I order the crepes with the white chocolate sauce that came on it but on the side which I was charged an extra 2 dollars for that. The chocolate ice cream came in a big glass and was hard to eat because it was too chocolaty and dense- didn't even get to finish it. Everything was really expense and not even worth it. Our waitress gave us the cheque when we were still eating and basically tried to rush us out of the place even though the place was empty. Also, the food came at different times so we couldn't eat at the same time and some people were don't before other even got there plate. Overall I wouldn't come to this place again, it sucked. Save your money go someplace else."}
{"text":"Loved the moo la la crepe with added strawberries! A must try! It's got Roche ice cream and small pieces of peanuts that give each bite that perfect crunch! Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Awful service. I came in Saturday June 3rd at 2:20PM asking for a table for 14. Once all my parties came and settled in, the server was non-existent. Our group had to go up to the server and ask for everything (that we were ready to order, our bills, our change and she never came to ask whether everything was fine). Whenever I went up to ask for anything, the server (a she) will reply with 'I know' which is not an appropriate response for dealing with customers. I was not happy with paying at least a 15% gratuity for a service where the server didn't even bother with probably her biggest table at that time (the place was not that packed for such an unacceptable and extremely unsatisfactory service). Next time, I will take my party to another place that can accommodate and provide 200% better service. Such a shame for a dessert cafe that offers decent and affordable desserts."}
{"text":"Here for a late night dessert with my daughter and sister, we ordered moolala,fifty shades ..the moolala is ok,I'm still looking for the old moolala and the fifty shades is my fave but the size is too small for the price that i paid,it would be too much to make it a tiny bit bigger. The server is good, The last time we went service is bad but this time its good."}
{"text":"Very, very slow service. So many other tables were seated after us, got their food before us and left. We had to ask for water and weren't brought it until a good 10-15 mins later. Orders came almost 10 minutes apart. Upon entering we noticed there were many tables that weren't cleaned amd figured they must've been short staffed. There seemed to be only one waitress working the entire place and yet 3-4 staff members were hanging out at the back of the restaurant. I wanted to give her the benefit of the doubt but she didn't even bring us water. We used to live in the area 3 years ago and had a couple of bad experiences with service but decided to give it another shot. Sad to say things aren't only the same but probably worse. I'd recommend going to another location. I'm shocked this has lasted as long as it has."}
{"text":"I always question my teenage self on why I used to love this place so much... so much to the point where when I was in my first year of university, I was 5'4 at 160lbs. I BLAME YOU, DEMETRES! And my lack of control back then.  Almost 4 years later, I'm here trying it again for the first time in forever (cue the frozen soundtrack) .. and I am just not impressed. Sure, your store is super cute and you have adorable names for your desserts (Hey Sexy latte - sooo cute!) But no. No no no. $9 is NOT worth it for a simple sundae that is wayyy too sweet. Their crepes/waffles are their hot sellers - they're piled with ice cream, fruit, brownies, and other random sweet things. Too much? Yes.. a little too much. At $12, it's something you'd eat maybe once a year and be like 'k my sugar intake has overloaded.'  Their prices keep going up and they stay popular because it seems to be a ideal 'date night' for many of our youth out there.  The service is pretty good at demetres, hence the extra stars! They're really kind and they pay attention to small things and unlike some other dessert joints, they actually have manners. And plus, tall and cute asian waiters bringing me food? Yes please!  So verdict- yes, it is worth a try. No, do not eat it more than once a few months or else your scale will have something to say about that."}
{"text":"I've been going here with my family for years - this time we went, we took family that had recently moved to Canada and we ordered a bunch of their crepes and waffles.  The names they give their desserts are unique and the family we took liked the experience.   We ordered:  Fudgement Day on a waffle - Honey Madagascar Vanilla Iced Cream with sliced bananas, Belgian dark chocolate sauce, and Belgian dark chocolate buttons - it was super good, super pretty sweet - the dark chocolate was a nice decision - made it less sweet for such a chocolatey dish.    Tongue depressor on a crepe - Cocoa Chanel Iced Cream, brownies, Belgian Dark Chocolate Sauce, and Belgian White Chocolate Buttons - this one's for the chocolate lovers. I, a chocolate fan and a sweet tooth, loved it.   The Last Straw on a crepe - Honey Madagascar Vanilla Iced Cream, Fresh Strawberries, an Strawberry coulis - we had to take a break from all the chocolate so this was a nice, but still sweet, change to our palette.   Chewbaclava on a crepe - Sweet Baklava iced cream, baklava bits, Quebec maple syrup, and cinnamon streusel.  This one was my favourite - it's different from the classic iced cream flavours you expect (strawberry, vanilla, chocolate).  The baklava bits sprinkled over the top gives it a nice chewy and somewhat crunchy texture - like granola.  It's another sweet crepe choice but it's a great one for those looking to try something new.  The fact that it's baklava iced cream also makes its flavour pop out more.   Costs:  Crepes - $12.75 Waffles - $13.25  The plates are huge - one crepe/waffle is good for 2-3 people.   I would definitely come again, as we usually do for a nice sweet ice cream treat. A lot of people have come to Demetre dessert restaurants for a long time - they serve good, consistent, and yummy desserts for a decent price."}
{"text":"This was my first time at this particular location, I obviously have been to other Demetre locations before. Upon entering this location the front waiting area is quite small and cramped. There was a party of 6 waiting ahead of us and it just felt like there were too many people in the small area that would comfortably fit 2. It is not a small place but it looks small due to the tight and narrow look of the unit.   But when seated, some may feel that they are being intrusive to their neighbour but it seems to be a wide enough gap for it to be comfortable and be able to speak without your neighbour knowing your secrets.  I was seated in the back corner where the exit to the office building was...good in case there's a fire, bad because the employees use this exit to go in and out to get supplies or chairs etc. At first I thought it was a terrible seat as I could see behind the counter and was essentially sitting next to the coffee maker but I found this seat to actually be more intimate than anything. Another great thing was that the server always came back to the counter and always checked on us, that earned him an extra dollar!  I usually order the same thing and of course this time was no different but what was different was how they laid it out. I usually get the crepe with ice cream inside and the ice cream is usually placed in the middle of the plate with the crepe around it, but this time the ice cream was on the side with the crepe folded like a fan making it look almost like...a dumpling. Now that may not mean anything but the fact that the entire staff is Chinese (not Asian, CHINESE) is not lost on me and the irony of the dumpling looking dessert. Of course it still tasted delicious but that's already a given.  So my server who had hair that looked like a Dragon Ball-Z character was great, constantly refilling my empty tea pot with more hot water so that I could be warm, and on a chilly night like we had, there's nothing better. I would probably visit this location a lot more if there wasn't the problem of the HORRIBLE parking lot, but it has impressed me and I'll probably think about this location more so than I have in the past."}
{"text":"The ice cream is to die for...but very, very sweet.  Well, the white chocolate was!  My niece had the waffle with ice cream and apples.  She loved it.  My daughter had the Oreo ice cream and also love it.  Very expensive and can get very crowded."}
{"text":"This place is completely mediocre.  Its not bad but not great either.  I would give it a 2 or 3 star rating but the prices are soooo completely crazy that it gets a 1.  A $7 milkshake should be mind blowing.  Their milkshakes would get a 3 star review from me if they were $3 (they are sooo bad!)  The glass is 1/3 full of whip cream and its not a big glass to begin with.  This place just falls very short.  People who give this place higher than 2 stars are only doing so because they've never been to another desert place before."}
{"text":"Freakin ridiculous.  Came here for a quick snack and there was a storm outside with hurricane like winds. Halfway through the storm the debit machine wasn't working and when it was time to pay the manager literally told us to walk down the street in the middle of the storm and go get cash from an ATM and to leave our belongings with them so we don't dine and dash. In a situation like this they lacked sooo much professionalism. I tried to drive to the bank but every street was closed cause there was a broken tree on every street. Ended up driving in circles, and had multiple branches hit my face and a glass door swung open and hit me in the face. you bet your ass I'm pissed. I told the manager I don't know the area but she said there was a bank right down the street- she lied it was 2 and a half blocks down. The manager should have just waved the small bill since they were at fault. I'm never coming back here again. The manager is stupid, I told her about my adventure trying to go to the bank & and how I got hurt & she didn't even bother apologizing."}
{"text":"Disappointing. Spend your money (and calories) elsewhere, caffe demetre is terrible and you shouldn't go there.  After hearing good things about cafe demetre for a while now, I can't believe how terrible this place is. Sugar and sweet things always taste good! But not here, and I have a sweet tooth too.. I feel like I just wasted a ton of calories - This place brings true meaning to 'empty calories'. The prices are on the higher side as well which is almost an insult.   My experience here started on a high and ended at rock bottom, I felt like a kid when I first stepped into this place with the colours and the smell of desserts in the air. The menu looked great and their puns are cool. That's about it.   Their ice cream is no better than any standard grocery store ice cream. I had the customize it ice cream sandwich with choco Chanel ice cream. It was supposed to be French chocolate or something. They really made everything sound much better than it is in their menu. The ice cream was flat, it wasn't chocolatey enough, and it was just sweet without adding anything. The ice cream was way too soft as well, it was dripping all over the place and it was a mess to eat. Simply put, their ice cream aren't good. The chocolate chip cookies were soggy and again, no better than what you can find in a grocery store. I ordered caramel sauce with this sandwich and it was terrible too. It was like they squeezed it from pre-made store bought caramel bottle. I haven't eaten such a bad ice cream sandwich before.   I tried some of my friends other desserts and they were more or less than same.   All in all, don't bother coming here."}
{"text":"This is my second time coming a Demetres and I had a much better experience this time around!   I was surprised just how packed this location was. We arrived a bit after 9pm on a Sunday evening and it was absolutely packed and there was even a wait line (which continued to even when we left after 10pm).   We went with the blush crepe and sweetcar named devour waffle. Get these if you like strawberries! The strawberries were quite fresh and sweet too! I was expecting an extraordinarily sweet affair and was pleasantly surprised that these desserts weren't overly sweet! The chocolate ice cream was much better than I expected, it's a very good ice cream and I know they make all their ice creams here (and you can tell!). The waffle and crepe was also excellent! The waffle was very soft, airy on the inside, and the consistency was right. Same with the crepe! You know these are all freshly made as they were warm.  Service was really friendly. Desserts came out in a reasonable time, and the atmosphere was quite lovely with all the people there - there were 4 birthdays in a span of a hour or so - maybe you should also celebrate your birthday at Demetres too?"}
{"text":"It's recommended that you go during the afternoon as even an hour after dinner wasn't enough for me to finish the Pomme Pilot. Very big portions and delicious crepes overall. Service wasn't very good - the host kept ignoring everyone in line and went to clean the tables and the staff who were helping the patrons kind of just stood there and waited for the people already sitting down rather than taking over for the host (who was, for some reason, cleaning up the tables). Since there wasn't that many staff on board, shouldn't someone take over the people who need attending to the most (aka people who are lining up for 15 minutes)? Negligent service aside, Demetre's is a good option if you're really craving dessert."}
{"text":"My family and I went there last night.   We waited and waited no one approached us at our table.   Then I went to ask will someone be serving us we have been waiting fir a while.  A server came took our order gave us water and we waited and waited!   Then my father said can we at least have our coffee the last explained they are making desserts for two other tables then we are next didn't bring my father a coffee even after he asked, 80 year old grandpa poor guy   Then the table beside us made a comment to us along when are you going to get your order we are feeling bad for you, you have waited now for one hour.   Then my six year old son starts crying asking mommy why are we not getting our ice cream.   Once again we asked the lady what's going on look my son is crying and people at other tables are noticing we are the only ones not served.   Her response was we are doing our best, we then all got up and left and her response was just go.  How nice was that! It was a special occasion for my family we were celebrating my nieces confirmation our whole night was now ruined.   Horrible place"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is very fun and welcoming- a great place to hang out with family, friends & kids. We got lucky because it wasn't super busy when we came.   Food: there are many dessert options to choose from, but I went with the cocoa ono cake. It wasn't out of this world but it was quite tasty. I couldn't finish it so I had to let my uncle have it. My dad ordered the Moo La La crepe which is also my little cousin's favorite dish here. I tried it and it was amazing! I loved how light the crepe was and the banana was fresh.   The service was alright. They brought everyone's dish out at different times which was kind of annoying since the ice cream dishes would melt by the time everyone else's dishes would arrive. So we had to eat right away while my cousin's dish took forever to come out.  All in all a good experience (although extremely unhealthy)."}
{"text":"Hi everyone,  1) The desserts were made of quality ingredients but the prices have gone up after you read the rest of the review, I assure we will not be back.  Also, our server was wonderful.  2) The store itself is a mess.  Worn out and tattered seat covers, dirty tables, dirty carpets.  3) The washrooms are unsanitary and a health scare.  Urine and other matters on the walls and stalls.  Dirty toilets.  The dirtiest floors I have ever seen in my life. Mildew on the tiles and all around the sink and a gross smell to blend in all in together.  4) The owners and staff should be embarrassed for the state of this location and for allowing patrons to have to endure all the nasty unhealthy and unsanitary conditions.  5) We will never go there again and I encourage you to think twice. If they have no concerns for what the forward facing aspect of the caffe is about, can you imagine behind the scenes?"}
{"text":"They say they are open on Fridays till 12am, I called at 11:45pm several times and they didn't answer.  I went there and it was closed at 11:50pm.  They should correct and list their honest hours on Yelp and stop misleading customers.  Customers might be coming from very far and expect them to open but they are closed.  Therefore I am leaving a one star."}
{"text":"Worst demetries in whole GTA. Places four adults on table that barely fit 2 plates and refused to reseat to other empty seats because order was already placed. Server name Megan ( front server)"}
{"text":"They`ve really changed their look, the atmosphere is very nice. I really enjoy coming to this place and this location. The selection on the menu is great and parking is not too difficult"}
{"text":"We needed a place for coffee that was open late, and ended up here. The place is too brightly lit with nothing pleasing to look at. It is not cozy at all, and is in serious need of a face-lift. The coffee was okay, kind of weak and milky. We will not be back, like ever. The one by the AMC complex is better. There is a new dessert place called Spin that opened in the same area as this and the decor, staff, prices, coffee and dessert is a lot better."}
{"text":"Desserts are generally good to very good, and although it can be a little pricey portions are huge! However service can be bizarrely slow at times (have waited 15 mins for them to cut a slice of already made cheesecake for takeout), with all the staff wandering around aimlessly while avoiding eye contact (I don't think I have crazy eyes...). Just about worth it on balance, but I tend to avoid because of the slow service."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE!!!!!! literally hated everything about this place. Food was crap, waiter was rude, we asked them to write on our plate and we couldn't even read it. Will never go again!"}
{"text":"Really nice ambiance for a casual date night or if you just want to grab dessert late at night. The portions are also very sizeable ( sharing size maybe?). Will definitely be back, even though the staff had to sing Happy Birthday 4 times in our 1 hour visit. We got the plush crepe, and the coco ono on a waffle. Both were delicious and satisfying"}
{"text":"Desserts are great. However space is small for large group. It's good place for indulging awesome desserts:)"}
{"text":"This place has the most expansive dessert menu I've seen yet. There's much to choose from, including crepes, cakes, waffles, pies, and ice creams.  Portions are huge and are therefore ideal for sharing. I ordered the apple pie with ice cream; my only complaint about it is that there was way too much icing sugar dusted on top (maybe next time I'll ask for it without the sugar).   The place is a bit slow midday, but it gets more hectic in the evening hours. With that said, a good place to come and enjoy some dessert."}
{"text":"This is the place for premium deserts!  After a great Chinese meal around the corner, I just had to pack a desert on top.  Sure, a dumb move, but I am very glad I did it!  I had The Fork Awakens, which has a healthy serving of pecan ice cream, blanketed by a fresh, chewy crepe, drizzled with caramel and Nutella and a generous portion of chopped pecans.  Forget taking any of it home!  This is a desert meant to be savoured to the end.  I had a coffee with my desert, at least the part that I did not spill all over the place.  Then I followed up with the Cider House Rules, a hot cup of buttery apple cider that is the most incredible balance I have ever had in a beverage.  For years I have driven past Cafffe Demetre locations all over.  I wish I had stopped in sooner.  I need to make up for lost time!"}
{"text":"Nice dessert as always, we always go to the location at Royal York. But this location lack of service, we never get menu+wait 15 mins for 2 glass of water+ask for the bill until we walk to pay at the counter.  To the manager, you need to get more server indeed.  Unpleasant meal today."}
{"text":"Horrible service. The place had four tables total and it took us 25 minutes to get water. Extremely unorganized staff, desert sat for 5 minutes before getting picked up at the waffle was cold. Best of all they brought us the bill while we were still eating and brought us the terminal to pay before we had finished our food. Absolutely horrible. I would highly suggest people do not go here. If the service was this bad with no one inside, imagine how bad it would be if it's full."}
{"text":"Really cool place to have desert. Huge portions so you can even have them as main dish. Waffle in particular were delicious. Crepe was also good. I saw others have milk shakes which seemed amazing. Definitely worth to go more than once to try different sweets."}
{"text":"Busy, overcrowded place with basic desserts. There's a nice selection and it's a cute concept to create a dessert only restaurant however the pricing for what you get is not reasonable."}
{"text":"We drove to Courtney park location and it was closed so we drove to demetres city center. It was already tough looking for parking, we went in and it was really humid and hot, the air conditioner was probably broken. Took about 10 mins to be seated; it was very dirty and customer's hairs were stuck on the sofas and It felt really runn'd down. After looking at the menu and being seated for about 15 min, we told one of the serves/hostess that we were ready to order and she said she will have our server to serve us. The lady just came and dropped water off and walked away without taking our order. So we waved the hostess/ server down again and she said she will grab our server; then she came back to tell us she couldn't take our order yet because the kitchen is behind. I asked her what do you mean? You aren't even that busy, she said it has been all day. So I asked her how long am I expecting to wait to place my order? She said she doesn't know, it usually takes 5min each to make a waffle. So I said am I expected to wait for an hour then? She said she didn't know. So I walked away angry. The servers couldn't even tell me they aren't taking orders prior to seating me down if they knew they were behind. The whole process was 30min wasted"}
{"text":"The food is great but the staff? Not so much. My friend and I were the only people in the cafe for an hour to hour and a half. Not even halfway through our desserts, the waitress dropped our bill on the table and forced us to pay. She kept trying to take away our plates even though we were still eating. This was not even two hours after they opened for the day. The entire time she was extremely cold and unprofessional. She didn't offer to refill our water at all, kept trying to take our plates, kept trying to get us to pay and leave, and was just overall not a pleasant person.  The food was great, so kudos to the chef, but your staff need an attitude check. It's also concerning that she had a full manicure with painted nails, considering that is a major food safety violation in the food industry everywhere else in the country. I won't be coming to this location ever again."}
{"text":"My husband and I spotted Caffe Demetre our first night in the Toronto area. When we first saw the cafe we were going to a movie and didn't really feel like eating desserts that late at night, but we both agreed that we wanted to try it during our stay.  We looked forward to trying some of the delicious looking desserts for our entire vacation and we finally indulged on the last night. However, we were sorely disappointed. When we walked in and told the hostess that we wanted to take out instead of dine in we were immediately treated like second class citizens.   We stood there completely ignored by at least 7 staff members for about 10 minutes before I finally asked somebody if we could order. She very rudely told me that we had to wait. If the desserts hadn't looked so yummy, we would have been out of there. The whole process took about 25 minutes to get ignored, place our order, and actually receive it.   We excitedly returned to our hotel only to be immediately let down. Instead of the Black and White Mousse my husband ordered they had given him a berry concotion that tasted terrible. But, it was late at night and as we had a 10 hour early morning drive the next day we decided that instead of calling to get the correct dessert we would settle for writing a bad yelp review."}
{"text":"Disappointed. Came on a Friday night it was a little busy. I was seated right away waited almost 15 min and no one approached my table.  I saw servers behind in the kitchen talking to each other one cane into my section a couple of tones but never said anything.   I had no patience and left without ordering. I ended up at another dessert place down the street Spin which I thought had better desserts and reasonable price.   This was not the first time I've experienced poor or slow service at demetres."}
{"text":"Like some of the reviews here, its a pretty decent place to dine in. This cafe is a walk away from surrounding businesses and residential places (not too far from square one too).. also, theres not a lot of line ups or crowd to be expected here so the noise level is between moderate or quiet. You get the odd loud ones here and there if your lucky.  The menu is pretty straight forward that offers a variety of desserts that suit your taste... as usual their waffles and crepes are good so anything from that menu is recommended. I don't have a permanent favourite so I cant really say whats good because their all yummy to me. Alas, too bad I cant say the same for their milkshake though, I got the chocolate one and it tasted blah.. like generic ice cream with plastic ...ugh... just dont... trust me, try somewhere else.  On a positive note, service was great. Our server was super attentive and was always there for us if we needed anything.   Overall, I recommend going here if your around the area. If you don't expect too much and just want the food itself (never mind the cold and stale decor) then this is the place to go. Its a nice hangout to talk while having dessert."}
{"text":"We were here over the weekend with my friends, our waiter Brandon was the most amazing waiter ever, he was super nice and patient, even that we were so many and everybody will talk at the same time, he got all our orders right and the bills as well, everything was delicious, but we really love the service!"}
{"text":"haven't been here in years, but glad to be back for my sweet tooth had a craving. Just south of 16th avenue on Yonge is Caffe Demetre's.  Its selection of sweet tooth desserts from Crepes, and waffles, to ice cream, and shakes can make obese.   With a few friends we decided to order their crepes with the choice of upgrading it to a waffle. I ended up having the Fudgement day, filled with bananas, and chunks of brownies, lathered up with chocolate it was as blissful and filling like an actual meal. Portion is worth it, esepecially for those who love their desserts. The service was very polite, efficient, and knowledgable when it came to decisions.  No complaints!!!  Its a location that can easily be missed, so keep your eyes out!!"}
{"text":"In the busy east beaver creek area this demetre location had been here for a long time.  Though this place is small,  it's always packed. It's staff are friendly, efficient and always on the go! after Smash kitchen our entourage was in dire need of some sweet sweet loving, since we all have sweet teeth lol.  Keep in mind SATURDAY night at Demetres can be a wait especially if you're with a big group.   For dessert my friend and I decided to share their waffles, topped with a lot of fruit, and two big scoops of vanilla...lets just say yum all the way. The portion was huge and we just barely finished the dish.  To help wash it down, we both ordered green tea :)  overall a great place whether for coffee, tea or desserts..."}
{"text":"oh boy! for some reason I always hate waiting in line, but again right next door to Prince Sushi was Demetres.  Coming here after 10pm was a mistake, most probably because the movie crowds were coming straight to this place.  HOwever luck must had been on our sides as we didnt have to wait too too long lol... YES the FOOD GODZ are on our side! firstly this place was quite loud! but again its no surprise. The service was at par, mainly because this place was busy, so I can't really blame our server. In terms of desserts, since we were so full, I decided to play it safe with their Mint tea and my friend opted for a macchiato...which was too big lol.... but she ALMOST finished it :)   overall Demetre's has always kept it positive reputation as a go-to dessert cafe."}
{"text":"Good selection of gelato and desserts. All tasty (at least the flavors of gelato and few cakes I've had) but they come at a premium price. If you're into dessert places then it's definitely worth a stop."}
{"text":"Yummy dessert place! Crepes and waffles and ice cream. How can you go wrong?"}
{"text":"Berries tea amazing, crepes were a little thick but very good, excellent costumer service, love the place, I will come back for sure."}
{"text":"Great service! Delicious latte and waffle with ice cream. Super friendly staff. And no wait!! Amazing! This has become my favourite location now."}
{"text":"2.5 STARS  Ahhh...this was THE place back in the day.  Everyone went to a Caf√© Demetre's on a Friday or Saturday night.    This particular location has been totally renovated so it looks pretty nice inside - fancy booths, upscale type of wallpaper, lightening etc.  It's also pretty large which is a good thing b/c it's always packed.  Luckily we got a booth for our group.  The menu is split between ice creams; waffles/crepes; cakes etc.  I will say they have very interesting flavor combinations and the names of the desserts are hilarious  - Pomme Pilot (I feel like you need to be over 30 to get this one...LOL); Tongue Depressor; Miami Slice....you get the picture.  Points for creativity.  I don't particularly have a sweet tooth - I just wanted a scoop of ice cream.  I choose the Passionfruit Sorbetto.  I'm not sure in what universe one scoop looks like 5, but it apparently in Caf√© Demetre's world is does!  But I guess since they charge $7 for a scoop you should be happy...?  The ice cream itself was nice - tart, which I like.  But I can't really justify paying $7 for it.  But I did.   Would I come back...probably not. It's a nice treat and the service we had was friendly, but gone are the memories (and the prices!) of back in the day :("}
{"text":"Demetres is a dessert cafe for adults as a candy shop is for little children.. except children can enjoy Demetres as well, which makes it - the best goddamn dessert place for ANYONE!  Large portions of heavenly desserts (waffles, crepes, cakes, hot and cold drinks with/without ice cream and other toppings) the possibilities are endless!!! Hope their menu was that way too. But in all seriousness, it's a great place to go for dessert and a coffee if you're not feeling the whole dinner thing and want to skip right to dessert (I have a bad habit of doing that a lot). Prices are reasonable, the place is almost always packed at night, service is great and the food is even better!"}
{"text":"One of the best desserts spots i've been to in my life. Ive tried many dessert spots but this cafe blew me away with their selection and amazing quality. highly recommend."}
{"text":"Big portions, delicious, but slightly pricey and a mixed crowd."}
{"text":"One of the very few places in North York to get desserts, especially at night. The interior looks great and the waiters/waitresses are really friendly. It's in a great location next to Yorkdale which is nice. The food is pretty good, but nothing too extravagant. Some of the prices for some items such as milkshakes are definitely not worth the buy (you can make better milkshakes at home for much less). This is still a good place for desserts but there isn't too much that's different from you going home and making it yourself- waffles, crepes, ice cream scoops and the like. Go here if you have the time and money, but don't be prepared to make this your \"go-to\" dessert place."}
{"text":"I love going here with my family for deserts. It's so yummy and it smells so good once you walk in. The portions are pretty big so I always share with one other person. It's always busy whenever I go, regardless if it's summer or not. I definitely love the waffles they make, it's very good."}
{"text":"I would have given this a negative star, if I was able to.   So, my boyfriend and I walked into the cafe, and the manager told us to sit at this tiny little place. We kind of wanted to sit by the window, but then she came up and told us not to. The place was not that packed, but we let it go by.  Anyways, so we ordered our desserts, and then we waited for an hour and half to get our desserts and milkshake. an hour and a half. that's a little extreme. But, we waited.  When we got our desserts, it wasn't good. It was very very sweet, and the milkshakes were really thick. And I didn't eat it. We then asked for our bill, and believe it or not, we had to wait for half an hour to get our bill. Yes, we also asked like 3 people for our bill.  I would definitely not ever go back here again. nope."}
{"text":"Amazing fresh desserts for cravings. Although the service is poor every time! I went the other day at 210pm when it had opened and there was only two other tables. Server was slow to take order and to bring bill, he barely talked to anyone. Another table that had just walked in also got their order before us as well."}
{"text":"Came here over the summer for a banana nutella crepe with whipped cream. It tasted as good as it sounds. What I like about this place is that you get to customize your own crepe to your liking. So you get the flavours you want. Can't go wrong with that.   Service and atmosphere is nice as well. 4/5"}
{"text":"Like Lan says this place has been there (Etobicoke's Royal York area) for a while now. There aren't a lot of late night, non Irish pub, venues for people to hang out with friends (especially if you're under 19) and Demetre sort of hits that niche. The place does get crazy busy on the weekends.   I can't say I've tried the food but I do enjoy their waffles/crepes/ice cream savories and their whip cream is outstanding. Nothing is cheap in life these days, especially if it has a GTA postal code, but as a once in a while treat, I come back from time to odd time."}
{"text":"What a hidden gem! Great food, friendly staff, and a great selection to order from.  We ordered the apple crisp Belgium waffle (I can't remember the exact name) it was absolutely amazing. To drink we had the chai tea latte was average a bit too milky for me.   You may think the prices are steep but the quantity is worth it. Most dishes can be shared between 2-3 people.  Note: the menu design was original and fun!"}
{"text":"My friends and I used to frequently come to this place for mega-portioned desserts.  We came to Caffe Demetre recently and realized they changed up the ice cream & waffle / crepe selections..They changed their whole menu! They took away my favourite one! I can't remember the name of it - it's the one with oreo cookie crumbles. Oh well, we had a great time nonetheless.  MOO LA LA + BELGIAN WAFFLE (4/5) (Roche Ice cream, Sliced Banana, Nutella and Praline Croquant) My friend and I shared this. I'll probably order this again when I re-visit. The ice cream is so yummy. :D"}
{"text":"This is a place where you see everyone happy. There is ample parking space and the staff is friendly. There is a lot of rush on weekends but you find seating space pretty quick. In spite of all the rush, they do get your order right. There is no push to get you out and you can relish your deserts. Try out the Banana split and the Crepes. These are my personal favourite. I will give this place 5 stars as I come in for a late night desert and is never disappointed."}
{"text":"Caffe Demetre is always open late, so it's a great place to catch up and have late night conversations with your friends. If you're a fan of Nutella, you'll love \"Moo La La\" as much as I do (strongly suggest the waffle instead of the crepe!) I always get it with strawberries substituted in place of bananas. Other classics include \"The Last Straw\", which is great on a crepe or waffle and consists of a whole whack of strawberries and strawberry syrup as well as vanilla ice cream, and the Toffee Snob cake, which is served warm and ooey gooey delicious. They recently got new menus which are very cute with punny titles like \"Game of Cones\". Prices have raised a couple dollars since last year, but I'll still come back for a waffle or two (or ten) when I'm craving something sweet."}
{"text":"I can to this place the other day. I ordered the hot chocolate. The drink was good I liked it. The place is well organized and the service is amazing. Washrooms were good as well. I like this place if I will ever be around that area will recommend to give it a shot. The place is busy on Friday night as that is when I went. At that night we were at fox and fiddles and there was a fire alarm but once we were forced out it was cold and we end up going to this place."}
{"text":"Had one of the waffles, and absolutely loved it. Everything was great, from the ice cream to the waffle itself, really can't think of anything that was wrong. I think the wait was probably the biggest downside; it took a little long for the order to arrive, not a huge deal since I was with some friends. The portion size is really generous as well (for 1 person). If I were to go back, I'd probably share a plate as I definitely had a tough time finishing it all by myself."}
{"text":"Went here on a busy night with two friends to satisfy one of their sweet tooth cravings. We've come here a few times and have always had a good experience.  The atmosphere is warm and comfortable while the seating can be a little tight. The servers were attentive and refilled water multiple times. The food was prepared relatively quick given that the place was packed.  I ordered the Tongue Depressor on a waffle, cost about $20 including tax and tip. If you love chocolate and have a big appetite (the waffle is big and the brownie pieces are dense and will fill you up), this is probably a good choice. You get chocolate ice cream, white chocolate buttons, chocolate brownies, and chocolate sauce (a lot of chocolate right?)  A lighter but also satisfying choice is The Last Straw (crepe option) that my friend ordered. Accompanied with fresh strawberries, fruit coulis, and vanilla ice cream, it's hard to go wrong with it."}
{"text":"The most decadent deserts.  Demetre is a chain now, but it started from the Greektown-Danforth location.  The ice cream is so delicious and so fatty, one goes into sugar/fat induced coma after a portion.  The 'baklava' crepe with baklava ice cream is so sweet and delicious.  The cake and ice cream special (I had the caramel one) is a bit smaller portion, but just as filling and delicious.    If you're gonna order the crepe+ice cream specials (their specialty) be sure to have  A LOT of space in your stomach as the portions are HUGE :)"}
{"text":"This is the place to be on Friday/Saturday night in the Dufferin and hwy 401 area. But be warned you will probably be in for a wait.  They use a very unique (to me anyway) system for those groups waiting for a table. They will text you when your table is ready; however, saying that, today I got the text 10 minutes after we were seated. Can't explain that one.  They've revamped the enterprise so expect a more upscale experience that remains family friendly. They have new ice cream flavours and new sundae combinations. IMO they seem to have moved their focus away from their infamous waffles/crepes (though they are definitely still on the menu) and focused on their sundae and hot/cold drink option. In the corner of the menu my cousin noticed that they also offer ice cream sandwiches but haven't tried or seen those yet.  On both recent visits, I've created my own two-scoop sundae. Mainly because they offer white chocolate silk ice cream (I have a soft spot for white chocolate) with Nutella, strawberries and dark chocolate sauce. Add the complimentary whip cream and waffle biscuit and you've got a little piece of bliss.  Price point is on the slightly higher side of reasonable (1 scoop is $9, 2 scoops is $10.75 plus tax) but I think it's worth every penny.  Servers are attentive and friendly.  Nothing bad to say, except wise this enterprise had more franchises around the city so the place wasn't always do packed.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"According to the sign on the wall, this was the original Demetres location; however, it's never been my favourite place.   It's small and cozy, that part I like! But they have always had limited hours compared to other locations. Many a night, I've gone with friends for an evening out and found them closed.   Last night, I must say, I was surprised to find them open and somewhat busy. Granted it was Saturday night so why was I surprised?   Servers appeared slightly overwhelmed but wasn't going to judge, it happens. Completely impressed that our server could remember two customized sundaes without writing anything down.  I've never had a bad experience at Demetres nor have I ever had to complain but when my cousin and I were served two bowls of completely melted ice cream, I had to say something.  Within 5 minutes we were presented two new frozen offerings that were delicious!  Otherwise, everything was great as always! And would not hesitate to return!"}
{"text":"I have been to at least 4-5 other Caffe demetre locations and this by far was the worst experience I've had at one of their places.  Service is terrible, I can't figure out whether the problem is with the waiters/waitresses or the people preparing the food but it should not take 30-40 minutes to order and receive two ice cream sundaes. I've been to busier locations and it usually takes no more than 10 minutes to get what you've ordered.  I will give them credit with d√©cor. This has been the most creatively designed outfit that I've been to but that doesn't make up for the below par service.  I would not recommend this location to anyone. It's just not worth it."}
{"text":"The dessert and portion size was great but the service was slow. We noticed a line up a desserts waiting to be brought to the tables, ours was sitting there for at least 5mins so when it made it to our table the waffle was cold. The delay was caused because they were waiting on our drink order???? We only ordered a latte. Very strange."}
{"text":"Always happy to be at a demetres. Although I did notice that the menu options were reduced from before, I still enjoy the crepes. This time opted for a sundae \"choc this way\". Did not disappoint-huge brownie chunks, delicious chocolate ice cream. I also HIGHLY recommend the belgian dark hot chocolate."}
{"text":"Always a fan...moo la la crepe being one of my favourites. The hot chocolate ALWAYS makes me extremely happy...I cannot figure out what they do to make it so decadent.  Come early, or prepare to wait. Later in the night is also a good option."}
{"text":"This location is a bit disappointing. Soon as we got in, we were not greeted and we waited a bit to get seated. Once seated I noticed that the tables have not been cleaned (mind you, it was not that busy). Service was not that good. Getting their attention was difficult; I had to ask 3 times for the bill.   We ordered the Red Velvet Cheesecake with Ice cream. Presentation was not that good, and the flavour was alright. Nothing special, just average Cheesecake you could get from a local grocery store.   Would I order this again? Probably not. Would I come here again? Probably not."}
{"text":"Second time. The cafe Americano and coffee we were served were cold by the time our mountainous dessert came. The Americano and coffee were very good but when the served offered to refill my wife's coffee she informed me that she was not allowed to top up my Americano. So I had a $12 dessert and $6 with if coffee but I'm not allowed a bit of coffee topup? Really Management? That is silly. Give the waitresses some leeway and discretion. I understand abuse of refills (by the way said Mgmt only allows three) but she could obviously see that I had nothing to drink when my wife had a full cup."}
{"text":"Caffe Demetre, commonly referred to as \"Demetres\" is a staple in Whitby. I remember going to Demetres as a kid, back when the movie theatre in that plaza was still an AMC. I've recently visited again and it is just as delicious and whimsical as I remembered.   Demetres is a full-on dessert restaurant serving extravagant waffles, crepes, sundaes, milkshakes, cakes, and more. Anything I've ever ordered is delicious (how can ice cream ever be wrong?) and the service is also quick and courteous.  If you pay close attention to the menu (which can conveniently be found on their website), you'll notice that many of their items are a play-on-words of popular culture references. For example, the sundae in my photo is titled Katy Berry and it is possibly my favourite on their menu.   Overall, this is an excellent dessert stop which will suit almost anyone's preferences from chocolate, to fruity, to caramel, and everything in between. Best of all, it is in a great plaza with lots of activities for a fun-filled night. If you're in Durham definitely give Demetres a try!!"}
{"text":"Went on a Friday night- very busy at the courtney park location. It makes sense as the movie is closed by. Pretty friendly customer service.  Only hick was we had a hair in one of our orders- the waitress did change it to a new one and apologise."}
{"text":"With their funky decor, Caffe Demetre offers many scrumptious desserts. Try their crepes or belgian waffles. My favourite's the Forbidden Fruits. Be careful of the \"Gorge-Us Sundae.\" It's deadly."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I  were hanging in the area saturday night and decided to go to caffe Demetre. It was our first time and we werent really sure what to expect but everything was amazingggg . loved the crepes and our server was very friendly!!! definitely recommend this place !"}
{"text":"What you need to know?  1. Desserts range around $9 - $20  2. Portions are HUGE  My Advice?   1. Order one plate and share. One plate/3 people, easy."}
{"text":"We have been coming here for 14 years and it is still a fav.  I believe that they do brunch on the weekends but the best thing to come here for is their homemade ice cream.  Demetre's desserts are the best.  My fav is their Peanut Better Ice Cream in the Nut Job sundae.  Put chocolate nut, chunks, fudge sauce and the ice cream together and you have a wonderful dessert.  You can get crepes or waffles and ice cream too  We have had them before also and I have never been disappointed.  The Tiramisu and Chocolatta ice cream flavours are also great.  They do have cakes and pies here also -- my niece raves about \"The Fridges of Madison County\" - which is a triple layer chocolate cake with chocolatta ice cream.  I have never attempted it personally -- too close to the ledge! haha  If you want some really creamy ice cream served up in lots of inventive ways, check out Demetre.  They have multiple locations across the GTA also.  They do a variety of types of coffees too.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The two stars are for the food because it's too good for me to give an overall review of zero stars. Every time I come here the service is horrible and it's enough for me to make a bad review this time around. Not sure why I have to wait for more than 15 minutes before my server comes and on top of that she isn't even friendly. Has a \"hurry up and order\" attitude and doesn't even bring us water... I never expect much from a restaurant but the service at this location has got to step it up."}
{"text":"If you have a sweet tooth this place will satisfy. Be prepared to wait a long time though especially if you go at night. It is in the same plaza as a movie theater so there are always tons of people nearby this place.  I've only ever gotten the Tongue Depressor because I love chocolate. The first time I couldn't even finish it because it was way too sweet for me. Second time I went I was able to finish it but man that is a lot of chocolate and sweet for one sitting."}
{"text":"Overall 3.5 stars.  Where in Richmond Hill can you have a decent and affordable slice of cake?  Where can you sit in an outdoor patio to enjoy it?  It will be at Caffe Demetre.  We ordered the cake and coffee combo.  For $10, we got a slice of cake of our choice plus a small latte.  Considering the latte is $4, and the cake is a good size to share between 2 people, I call the value pretty good.  We got a chocolate cake.  It was rich, creamy and dressed with fruit bits and melted Belgian chocolate.  OMG, it was sooo good.  The small latte was a good size for one person.  We should have added $1 to make it a large latte for sharing.  A few wait staffs served us.  They were all friendly, well presented and efficient.  The interior seating is average.  The outdoor patio is decent in the evening.   I like this place.  And a lot of people agree with me, cause there was a crowd waiting for tables by the time we left."}
{"text":"My wife and I ordered the same thing and they brought them 6 minutes apart. Had apple pie with ice cream. Ice cream was good. Large portions but for $14, I would expect better than microwave reheated pie. Makes the pastry soft. Probably won't return."}
{"text":"Demetre offers a wide variety of desserts primarily crepes, waffles, sundaes, and cake. Though for me I didn't find that the desserts were anything special since I didn't get the feeling that they had a \"hit\" dessert that everyone would get. However if you're looking to satisfy some dessert cravings and no where else to go, I suppose coming here is not too bad of an option."}
{"text":"Never again. I have never seen this poor style of mgmt before where a lineup of people stretching from the door to halfway up the restaurant was allowed while the back remained empty. Perhaps hoping to entice more customers ? Problem is - this is not a dance club, so no idea what mgmt was thinking. In addition, there was an empty table for 6 that was just left available up to almost 30 min next to us! We brought our 10 yr old and met up with my family. It took half an hour to get a waitress and then ONE hour to receive my son's juice! The manager apologized but never even offered anything to compensate like better establishments would have with actual customer service standards. We were appalled at the dismal lack of ability in the servers and mgmt. we joked that perhaps they had to milk the cows to get my son's one scoop ice cream! Many places would have at least ensured that the child gets their food first, or something to gnaw on! We love to go out and dine or have dessert, and this was by far one of the worst experiences ever. It took almost 2 hours to get our food in total. Disgusting. The food was good but not great, and definitely not worth the wait. The clientele was mostly young people and teens, so I quickly realized that this place has definitely changed in the years since we have last visited it. I would have had more fun at a Dairy Queen or Baskin Robbins. I would not recommend this place for any night, especially Friday, and if you have children, a quieter and customer-oriented place would be better, or, bring pjs and some snacks."}
{"text":"Place is always good and packed, never had an issue with the food,  smells great when entering"}
{"text":"They really hate their customers! Terrible service, with attitude. DO NOT use the washrooms..... the smell alone will stop you at the door.  Its filthy and needs renovations - and some cleaner!  Yuk!  I've been 2x and will never go back"}
{"text":"Don't get it why people are crazy about this place....?!  I only tried Waffles and in my opinion they are very mediocre ones plus a scoop of regular ice-cream on top which you can easily find in supermarkets!   Nothing special about the taste of these desserts except they are really huge and appealing and if you are craving something sweet you can go there and they are big enough to share with s/o else.  Maybe other desserts are better I have no idea!   The place itself is toooo busy and noisy and you have to stand in the line for a long time!  I think it is enough to go to this place once. You can buy a 6-pack of Waffles for $5 and put your favorite ice-cream on it and pure your favorite sauce on top instead of paying $13."}
{"text":"I love this place! Have tried numerous desserts from them and none have left me down.  It is slightly on the pricier side but the quality you get per per order is ridiculously large. I always struggle to finish even 75% of my plate despite the fact that it's delicious because the quantities are so huge.  The atmosphere is great. Very calming with some music in the background. There is lots of space for coming here with large groups of people."}
{"text":"Very nice and fri ndly staff.   They don't have any peanut butter in thr menu which is understandable but otherwise everything else is on point."}
{"text":"Unfortunately as usual there is no way to rate zero. We came to this place tonight and waited for over 45 minutes to get an order. There are people who got sit literally half an hour later than us and already got served. Another thing is that we got wrong order twice. Not happy!"}
{"text":"Pretty packed place, service was a tad slow. Long wait to be seated. New management they told us. Place looked a lot better than past visits. They took away the cone from the a la fraise. For me, it was the best part of the dish, and even on the menu it states it's supposed to have it. Asked for it, said it's not part of the dish anymore. 4/5 stars because it's a great place, but they ruined my favourite dish."}
{"text":"Good dessert place if your looking to sit with friends or a date after a dinner or lunch!    Pros:  - Food Options: They have so many dessert options if you have a hard time deciding, ranging from crepes, waffles, ice creams, and more!  - Service: Service is decent and the servers are really nice.    Cons:  - Parking: If your going late at night, hard to get parking as there are lots of people waiting for other restaurants or for Burger King (which is right beside there).  - Price: I think the price per plate is a little pricey. I think if you split each dessert amongst two people, it will make it more worthwhile and not to tiring to eat.  - Wait times: If you go during prime time (late night Friday, Saturday and Sunday), you and your group will probably be waiting about 20-45 minutes which is very long for a dessert place.    Foods I like:  - Splitsonian (In Crepe or Waffle)   Overall, I don't come here to often because I don't like to wait that long for dessert but when I'm craving for ice cream and crepes, it's my go to spot."}
{"text":"This Demetre location would be 5 stars, but minus 1 star for the poor service.   Demetre offers a wide selection of desserts including ice-cream, sundaes, cakes, crepes, waffles, and an assortment of beverages.   I had the Hokey Pokey on the waffle and Fridges of Madison Cownty. Both were amazing!! My cousin, a local resident, has tried most of the desserts and recommends them all.   All of the desserts are delicious!! A great treat for all ages."}
{"text":"Came here after lunch on a Thursday afternoon and wanting something sweet. Decent drinks and okay desserts. Very difficult to find the place but the best description I can give is to look for the office building with greenish tinted windows that has \"100 York\"  labeled on the building.  The atmosphere is more targeting teens and the younger crowed with menus that look more like a child's story book. Its weird see men in suit and tie holding what looks like a child's menu. If I was opening a cafe in this area I would probably be targeting the many office workers in the area. But I guess it gets most of its business from the younger crowed during the night since its been around for so long.  Large Macchiatto $6 - WARNING - wait for it to cool down or sip very slowly or else you might get burned like I did. The drink is topped with cool whip cream so when the scolding hot drink hits your lips its a painful surprise. The drink itself is sweet and pretty good.  Large Cappuccino $5 - lots of foam on top, pretty decent flavour.  Also got a slice of cake called the Cherry Potter for $8.50 - probably the most expensive slice of cake I have ever purchased. Fell way short of expectations. It was basically a New York cheese cake with apple crumble and cherries. The syrup sauce from the cherries were over powering and really didn't taste really good and ruined the cheese cake itself. Most expensive and one of the worst cheese cakes I have ever had.  Service was good as there wasn't really that many customers at about 2:30pm."}
{"text":"Last night we visited this overcrowded place and realized we made a mistake when I placed my name on waiting and while insisting they told us that time for wait could be anywhere less than an hour resulting into compell us to order take out, while take out was packed, my name on waiting list announced and since it was my daughter's birthday (which the owner knew as while I'm paying the bill we told him that) we took a seat thinking to entertain my daughter at her favourite place. To our shockingly surprise the owner being greedy to entertain more guests insulted all of us by literally asking us not to seat as we ordered take out without recognizing our intent to seat their by putting our name on waitlist. The correct customer service would have been granting us an exception to whatever stupid rule they have, considering the fact that we shared about our special day before even our waitlist turn shows up.   I have never ever experienced such a rude behaviour from any owner for few dollars additional income from another guests by literally expelling us from our right to occupy the seat. It was the highest level of disappointment I hv experienced from any retail hospitality/Resturant/cafe/bakery services.  Unfortunate events happen at reknown places too."}
{"text":"Always a best place to go for dessert. I think you should experince their service and ice creams with crepes/ waffles etc. Never ending experince if u like chocolate alot so go for TOUNGE DEPRESSER"}
{"text":"3.5 stars. A good place to have dessert after watching a movie or having dinner. It seems like the menu is being updated constantly as we had ordered a waffle with ice cream called The Fork Awakens, which is in homage to the latest Star Wars movie. It is a combination of salted butter pecan ice cream, whipped cream, caramel sauce and we substituted the milk chocolate sauce for white chocolate sauce. It was delicious and unfortunately we noticed it was no longer on the menu during our last visit.   The O.C., aka the Oreo cookie milkshake, is definitely one of my go-to orders. Just the right mix of oreos, ice cream, milk, whipped cream and chocolate syrup, a must for Oreo lovers.   I find that the service is hit or miss but on the most recent visit, our server was very accommodating and prompt although it was 15 mins before closing. Our orders came very quickly and we did not feel rushed at all."}
{"text":"I wish the service was better. This USE to be the only location I would go to but after my recent visit I don't think I'll be returning anytime soon. I feel that caf√© Demetre's food quality really went down hill. I didn't enjoy my dessert at all and I had a really bad tummy ache afterwards. Our server was very UNattentive, she didn't even greet my boyfriend and I she just asked us if we knew what we wanted,  I find that very rude. Overall I will not be returning to this location."}
{"text":"way too big portions & reasonable prices. Evenings & weekends seem busiest with the movie theatre directly across so don't go expecting a quiet date but still great place:-)   probably not the best seating/tabletop surface area layout for large groups."}
{"text":"I really like how they are open late. Not a lot of dessert / cafe places are, so this place is great to go after dinner with friends. They are open on a lot of holidays too which is awesome because for some reason, I always crave cake when it's like Christmas Day or Thanksgiving. I normally get their cheesecakes... they are delicious. And the ice cream makes it even better! They're just good, they're not spectacular. I love sweets and chocolate but I can't handle their triple layer chocolate cake. It's like 3x too sweet that it's gross. Cheesecakes and crepes are safe choices. And I personally like the Yonge and Hwy 7 location better. The vibe is different but I don't know how to describe it. You'd have to check it out yourself :)"}
{"text":"We come here at least twice a month ; and this place NEVER fails to satisfy us ; from the wait at the door - to the end payment. We're quite content. Except for today ... we were seated very quickly and given menus. We were given water & then another waitress came around with water.. (I'm guessing we were the second waitresses table) but anyway ... we sat and 15 minutes passed by and our waitress by the name \"Cat\" decided to finally come around to take our order. We then proceeded to wait another 15 minutes for our food , (we ordered the tongue depressor ... oh how it made the experience a 5) the table across from us sat 6 teens and they all received their food before us although they got here after us ... disappointment is not even the word. After finishing our food. We waited another 10-15 minutes just for Cat to notice we were done and ready to pay. We literally sat at the table and watched her and she walked around NO FOOD IN HER HANDS NO DEBIT MACHINE FOR PAYMENT NOTHING... ugh. Not to be rude. Maybe she was having an off day but I hope we don't encounter her next time."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Kicked out almost 5 parties 30 Mins before closing time since they were Tired! Service is a shame! Skip this place!"}
{"text":"The previous location that I frequent has been closed permanently(east beaver creek location) this one isn't too far.  This location is much larger and can seat almost double the other one. On a cold sat it was very busy but was seated quite fast. They are very organized and the servers are all very nice.  I got the crepe (Nutella strawberry and vanilla ice cream) it was delicious and made very pretty. Idk where they get the ice cream but their vanilla ice cream is the best. Would come back."}
{"text":"Favourite demetre's. They are so good with kids at this location and we go every year at the end of the school year.  I love that they make the ice cream themselves so they know what is in it - making it a breeze for egg allergies. Our server today was very sweet. My daughter could not have the waffle cone so she gave her extra ice cream. She also packed up our leftovers to take home.  These giant sundaes are the one scoop size! Mine was packed with strawberries, Roche ice cream and praline. My daughter had the white chocolate ice cream with Oreos and Belgian chocolate drizzle."}
{"text":"Demetres is the place to go when you want to have dessert as a full on meal. I question how some people can finish a whole crepe or waffle to themselves, or how I used to do it back in the day. Now I'll only go there if I know someone will be splitting with me.   Usually the service is decent but just yesterday when I went, I waited about 20 minutes for water and someone to acknowledge us. That's pretty ridiculous considering their water comes from tap and it's a small restaurant.. however I won't let this one thing ruin my entire experience.  We ordered the Moo La La crepe which was about $13, had some kind of chocolate ice cream topped with bananas and Nutella. I liked it a lot, definitely worth the price considering the size and if you are going to share it with someone.   At the end of the night while our friends were still talking, the waiter randomly threw down the cheque on our table. I say randomly because we didn't ask for the cheque. It would have been nice if the waiter warned us if it was last call or asked if we wanted anything else.   Overall I would say the atmosphere is alright .. It gets quite loud in the place and the service is okay. I would come back for the crepes, they are worth it."}
{"text":"Always a fan of Caffe Demetre.  Great desserts with wonderfully fun and whimsical names.  Great place for meeting up with friends with a sweet tooth.  My go-to place when my friends are wondering where to go for dessert.  I had a waffle with bananas and nutella.  So good.  So satisfying."}
{"text":"I don't post often, but I felt I needed to warn others. I hope this was an isolated incident on Thursday night. I have been to a few Demetres throughout the years; this one included, and had pleasant experiences. We ordered the Tikipedia waffle (coconut sorbet) and red velvet cake with white chocolate ice cream. Both the sorbet and the ice cream had ice shards throughout, presumably because they weren't churned properly. i.e. it was not creamy in consistency at all; almost partially melted popsicle-like, you taste ice more than anything. Surprisingly, you can mess up ice cream. The cake and waffle weren't great, but the cherry on top (pun intended) was the terrible service. The waitress acknowledged us but quickly dropped off water and never came back. We flagged her down eventually. She gave us curt service and we later had to ask for the bill, twice. This place is a far cry from what it used to be. We noticed the couple beside us shared the same frustrations. Avoid this place at all costs until they get their act together."}
{"text":"Nice and quiet seat - yourself caffe. The staff was friendly, and the atmosphere was great. I ordered the \"Tongue Depressor\" on a waffle, which i definitely recommend. I'm going back for sure!"}
{"text":"Even though I've lived within 10 minutes of Cafe Demetre for 5 months now, and have a tremendous sweet tooth, I've only gone here once.  I had a crepe with peanut butter ice cream and bananas on it.  I don't remember the name of it.  The ice cream was awesome (I love peanut butter ice cream).  The crepe I found a little bit rubbery - I guess that's how it's supposed to be though - I see that some people have described it as chewy, which is fair.  Why haven't I been back?  Hmmm.... Although their menu is huge, it's also limited, in that it is almost all crepes and ice cream, or sundaes.  Also, the portions are huge, which of course is fun, but I would rather have a small treat every day then a huge one that I feel guilty about for 3 days.    They do have a big selection of cakes though, in a display case at the front.  I think I will go back one day soon to try one of them."}
{"text":"Loved how spacious this location was, stayed here for hours and weren't rushed to leave."}
{"text":"Nicely renovated, decor reminds me of a French cafe with tall benched tables and bright colour a. Service was a bit absent, but still enjoyable experience. A lot better than the older location when it looked so run down."}
{"text":"Superb superb superb! Have no other words to write about this place. Awesome variety in the menu and awesome preparation. You cannot call an outing an outing without going to this place.  Very convenient to reach. Located at a central location near cinema, food, bar and what not. Could have made it a bit more clean though!   Must try their coconut milk. This is the latest of the things that I tasted there and loved."}
{"text":"Sugar, sugar and more sugar.   What would be nice is if there was more variety on the ridiculously busy menu.  I know that Caffe Demetre is for sweets but it would be nice if there were a few extra options that were of the sweet persuasion but less likely to make you a diabetic.    This is an eyes before stomach place!"}
{"text":"This used to be one of those places in the neighbourhood that we would go to as teenagers for dessert. Unfortunately even after the nice renovations and revamp, it was a disappointing evening. I ordered the Pomme Pilot Belgian Waffle and it was utterly disappointing because the waffle was undercooked and the ice cream was very melty even though I had ordered it on the side. The service could usually win me over but it was very slow and inaccurate... we waited a while before being greeted by any server after we sat down, and even getting water took forever. I doubt I'll be returning any time soon."}
{"text":"So much better from my previous experience. The manager or business owner had reached out to me after my previous yelp review. I returned since they took the time to. The service was ten times better the second round. The server was attentive and catered to our needs. Our food also came out a lot faster. Great service and quality! I would definetly return to this location!"}
{"text":"Went here on the recommendation of a friend who is familiar with the area, after having had dinner a bit further away.  Good Lord. Good luck trying to find any parking on a Saturday night. I had no idea. We ended up having to find a spot in a business park across Beaver Creek and braving the frigid night to walk back over.  So, the place was incredibly packed and busy, but we actually didn't have to wait long to get a place to sit. It's set up as a little adorable ice cream shop/cafe. Their menus are gigantic, in fact it was actually a bit difficult to navigate at our tiny table, but I had also perused the menu online beforehand, so I had a general idea what I wanted.  Lee ordered a Nobel Piece Prize, and I ordered a Fudgment Day. At first, they were out of peanut butter cheesecake, but then magically some appeared, and we were served pretty quickly.  It was good. I would put the ice cream quality pretty high, and the combination of ice cream and waffle was pretty good. Lee had problems even finishing his, and I think that the cheesecake actually was too heavy for him. He ended up stealing some of my waffle to go with his ice cream..  Were I to go again, I would definitely just order one dessert and split it. Two was overkill, especially with the prices.   Then the weird thing. You would think that with how packed it was, that the servers would be wanting to flip the tables faster. Lee and I were quite obviously done with our food, but it took almost waving my hand in the air and whistling (which I did not do, I did have to catch his eye at least twice) in order to get his attention.  We would have considered lingering, but the sound was just too deafening. There aren't a lot of soft surfaces to absorb noise, so I was getting a bit of a headache by the time they let us escape.  I'd go back for sure, but I am not sure if I'd go to this specific location again."}
{"text":"This is the second Cafe Demetre that I've visited, and this one was a much more pleasant experience than my first. It may be the location, which is in more of a downtown area than a massive shopping mall area, it may be the time of night we went, or it may have been the better level of service.  This time we were a bit more intelligent than our previous visit as well, opting to split one dessert waffle between us, instead of each ordering something and overindulging. This made the evening much more pleasant, as we didn't feel overstuffed afterwards. Service was quick and fast, the dessert waffle was delicious. The manager of this location was incredibly attentive as well, making sure tables were arranged and getting turnarounds done much more quickly and calmly.   Overall, this is a nice spot for dessert and coffee, and I would definitely make a return visit."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst restaurant I have been to in my life, if they have negative stars to give I would give them -100 stars...I wasn't talking about the food even tho it was still mediocre as my waffles were not fresh, but I'm talking about the service here is the worst I have had...first off we sat at our table for a good 15 mins without knowing who our server was...I kept waving down for waitress/waiters but they always avoided me...finally after 20mins our f****** server comes and we had a pissed off look on our face and she's like of sorry for the wait, when we finally finished our dessert the service got even worse, we waited 20mins for them to get a f****** credit card machine over after waving down 3 servers to get us the dam machine, our waitress finally came...I gave a $0 tip and this is the first....never coming back to this dam place again"}
{"text":"This has to be my least favorite location for Demetre's for a few reasons, given I have only visited once my experience was so horrible I will not be risking it for a second one.   First of all I will once again harp on the parking issue, now unless your visiting in the off hrs you are going to be paying for parking or walking a fair distance to your vehicle which I find annoying right off the bat. The location itself has to be the smallest of all the locations I have visited and the decor was far off from the usual decorative ambiance the chain usually boasts. Strange, circular booths with plastic surrounding them in what seems like an attempt to be colorful, playful and modern but resulting in cheap and almost cheesy. The use of space, colors, lighting, decor everything was not what I have come to enjoy from Demetre's.  We were greeted by a server/hostess that immediately put everyone off by stating she was sorry but the only tables she had left were situated at the \"back\" of the restaurant, which I myself wouldn't have known was any different from the front had she not mentioned it.   My guests had to use the bathroom on arrival and were absolutely appalled by a foul stench emanating from the woman's washroom so they literally used the men's in desperation and some embarrassment as well   Now the service at the table did not get much better, the same server who told us she was seating us in the least desirable table possible took our orders in somewhat of a rush however she did make helpful suggestions that I did not heed at the time  to my dismay but she did know the menu well. Strangely enough, even though it wasn't a busy time, it still took a while to get our orders, one of which was actually under cooked... the crepe was chewy and doughy tasting which was worsened by the fact that we had to wait so long for under cooked crepes  All in all this is not a location I will be returning to, I do not think it does the chain any justice as it does not live up to what their customers have come to expect"}
{"text":"What happened to this place!? It used to be good food, good company, and all the good stuff. Now the ice cream is no longer creamy (did it melt but was frozen again?), the red velvet cake was dry and crumbly, the waffle lacks texture (as though they watered down the batter). This is all on top of the major menu changes. Don't be fooled by the busy page, they're simmered down on variety of ingredients: all you get is different combinations of the same few things: chocolate, whipped cream, and strawberries. I miss all the different toppings they used to offer.   Oh and the service. When you arrive, you'll be seated at any open table, but you'll have to wait 10 mins before anyone brings you a menu and utensils/ water. When you're ready to order, the waitress will probably take down orders of 3 other parties that were seated after you. It's chaos. Maybe when you finally run out of patience,  you'll have to chase after the waitress if you want to place an order. Perhaps the place is under staffed, but when you'll done, good luck finding the waitress so you can pay for your unsatisfactory food or what they'll call dessert.   I miss the old Demetres."}
{"text":"By far the best demetres! Very well kept and nicely decorated! Staff are always friendly, service is fast and food is good!"}
{"text":"This has been my favourite dessert place (and location) for years! I always order the same thing: Cocoa Chanel ice cream on a waffle topped with strawberries and chocolate drizzle. Cozy atmosphere, & friendly staff. The presentation of these desserts never fail. The menu layout changes quite often, but it's generally the same items. The prices have increased a bit over the years as well, but the portions are large so I guess it's worth it, especially if you're sharing with your significant other or friends."}
{"text":"Dropped by this place on Friday after 10pm. It was super busy - we had to wait for 35 minutes to get a table for 15 which wasn't bad. Time flies when you are chit chatting. I ordered a waffle with icecream - \"Splitsonian\" honey vanilla icecream with fresh strawberries, sliced banana and Nutella and whipped cream ($15.50) it was perfect size to share though a bit expensive. Since adding tax and tip to $15.50 would easily make the dish $21 total.  Waffle was fluffy and soft (too bad the edges of the waffle wasn't crispy) and of course Nutella was heavenly.   overall the whole dessert was delicious but the only part I didn't like - the vanilla icecream had bits of ice in the scoop. I think the icecream was left to thaw and refreeze too often so it formed ice crystals. There was patches of ice in each bite of icecream.  Great spot for a late night dessert in a casual setting. The menu is nice and simple but I do miss their old look - retro design and pictures of their dishes and drinks. Service was attentive and polite. If you wanted extra napkins or extra forks it was easy to get their attention. They were efficient!"}
{"text":"Great desserts but evening time usually has a lineup to get in and service is a bit slower due to all the tables full, but worth the wait"}
{"text":"Fantastic desserts. Expect a wait but worth every penny. Massive servings can easily serve two people so the price is the very fair. Good atmosphere for a relaxed date."}
{"text":"Fuck this I almost puked from your Tongue Depressor. You're supposed to depress my tongue lightly not assault it with ingredients from Costco. And by that I mean cool whip whipped cream that's sat out in the open fermenting for a week, and fudge sauce that is not drizzled, but dumped on. The ice cream and brownies were fine but the crepe was average. Too bad I could only really taste the fudge sauce and the disappointment after ordering what I thought would be mediocre. That's a low bar to fall under and you did it. Hip hip hooray Edit: i think a cool new idea for this dessert would be to change the name to Tongue Depression"}
{"text":"I love dessert, and this place has enough variety on their menu to take care of most of my cravings. Everything I have had so far tasted as it looked/was described, delicious! The staff is always nice and relaxed. They are not in your face too much, but around enough to get you your stuff. This is a good spot to enjoy some forbidden calories, without getting rushed out.  One thing that needs improvement here is the bathroom. It could be a tad cleaner."}
{"text":"I'm a sucker for dessert. And this place delivers. I mean, really. Whoever said you can't have dessert before dinner OR for dinner hasn't been here. With a plethora of desserts to choose from it can be overwhelming. Often times I have trouble choosing because everything sounds fantastic. However, on this visit, I opted to go for something chocolatey yet simple. I ordered from one of their 10 hand-crafted ice creams. Roch√© with their praline croquant. Now, Ferraro Roch√© is my favourite chocolate. EVER. This ice cream tasted like it. The only thing missing was an actual Ferraro Roch√©. It was yummy and cream and delicious that it's really not worth sharing. The praline was also a nice salty crunch to balance the all the sweet. Now that was just about the dessert. I found the service was great and our waitress was pleasant and helpful. My mom, who is always up for trying new things came with me, likes to ask for suggestions and the waitress was quick to point out the popular items as well as her favourites. (Personally, I think my mom was lying to me about not having been to Caffe Demetre. Her sweet tooth is as bad as mine...or is it the other way around???). Our waitress was patient but attentive as we made our selections (she came back to our table 5 times as we scoured the menu). And when we finally ordered we didn't have to wait long either. My mom ordered the Blush Waffle with fresh strawberries and Belgian White Chocolate Sauce. Which looked absolutely delicious and tasted even better. Yes, my mom shared and I didn't. Clearly, I didn't learn anything about sharing! Either way, this place is great of you've got a sweet tooth and, if you're so inclined, the desserts are great for sharing. So grab a friend, family member, significant other and check this place out. The sugar high will be worth it! (:"}
{"text":"This review is strictly based on the service at this location. Very poor management. Huge line out the door with empty seats inside. People come in and order take out and sit at the tables and eat it. The hostess is no where to be seen. Waited in line for 30 minutes until I asked a server if we could sit and she gave us menus and took our order. Very disorganized."}
{"text":"Its a nice place for ice cream lovers with cold and warm desserts. I have tried quite a few desserts and all are really good, rich and filing. The ice cream is served on a crepe as well as on waffles. The serving is really big,( at least for me) for I am not a big eater.    I had guests from Chicago, we were about 9 people.  Everyone ordered what they wanted. The server brought 2 orders immediately and then after a 15 minutes wait brought 4 more orders, the rest of us were just waiting.  Anyways, we called the server to cancel rest of our order to which she said Sorry, its almost done.   I go there often and it has always been a good experience but just today it was frustrating."}
{"text":"Not bad but not amazing, you know?  Came for a late dessert with my date on a Friday night around 10pm.  Here's what we saw; kids running back and forth on complete sugar highs, teeny boppers taking selfies with their alpha female, elderly couples on a nice Friday date, post fine dining dinner groups looking to fill their sweet tooth, exhausted parents, overly enthused servers.  Don't get me wrong, the above isn't necessarily a bad thing, just not what I expected at all. Aside from their cartoon-like menu, I expected a mix between the Second Cup ambiance and a gaze-through-the-window-at-the-chefs crepery. Do not be fooled. Caffe Demetre is more so a Chuck E Cheese dessert place for kids, at least during the time we went. I saw they stay open until 1:30am so maybe their customers die down and 'mature' (ugh, that word...) past 11pm.   I ordered a latte and Cappuccino Royale on a crepe while my date had the banana milkshake. It totally threw me off that the crepe and milkshake arrived before the latte but that's okay cause it all went into my belly in the end. Flavours were alright, a bit too much caramel for my likings but hey, I should have asked for less anyhow. The server explained that the cappuccino ice cream has fresh made espresso folded in - we thought that was the coolest! The crepe was light and I didn't feel too bogged down afterwards. It came to $29 without tip and I was a bit surprised to see I was charged for a large latte ($5) instead of a small ($3). I definitely received a large latte but didn't realize it until the bill came. I just assumed the default would be small... but I'm learning to never assume.   All in all, I'd return much later than 10pm and I'll order something with less caramel.  NOTE: it took a lengthy amount of time to get our bill as it was jammed. I'd say close to 10-15 minutes, so keep that in mind if you're in a rush."}
{"text":"We came here on a Thursday night and the place was about 3/4 full. Service was horribly slow. We sat for a good 15 mins before our server came to take our drink order and another 15 mins for our order to arrive. By then the ice cream I ordered was already half melted!! And they charged me $1 for hot water?!?!  Definitely not coming back to this location."}
{"text":"Caffe Demetre is a must-visit if you're a fan of desserts or sweets. It was my first visit on a Sunday night, but finding parking was surprisingly pretty difficult. I went with a friend and arrived at about 8:30 p.m. with no line-up. However, a line started to form around 9:00 p.m., so try to come earlier if you can, especially on the weekends. It would probably be better to go in smaller groups (I suggest maybe 2-4 people).  I was pretty surprised how colourful the menus were and the variety of dishes Caffe Demetre had, so you would certainly find something you would like. I ordered the Robert Brownie Jr. crepe, while my friend ordered the Smashin Pumpkins Belgian Waffle. Some of the other menu items had funny names too (such as Moo La La). It would be a good idea  to visit Caffe Demetre if your dinner wasn't filling enough, but make sure you have room in your stomach because the portions are very large. Both my friend and I are relatively big eaters, and we almost had trouble finishing the desserts ourselves.  I was very impressed with the amount of ice cream that our desserts had since I was expecting a much smaller portion size. I also liked how it was a unique specialty flavour: honey vanilla. There are also other flavours to choose from, but it depends which dessert you order. Although the crepe seems a bit ordinary at first glance, it tasted very soft and complemented the ice cream very well. The toppings that came with the Robert Brownie Jr. also included peanut butter sauce and brownies. These were great additions and made the dessert more unique. The sauce was very smooth, however, I did find that the brownies were a bit sweeter than I would have liked. Regardless, they were very easy to eat since they were in bite-sized pieces. My friend really liked his dessert as well and felt that the toppings and scoop size were balanced. In addition, the waffle was large enough to satisfy him. Overall, the presentation of both of our desserts was very appetizing. The service was also excellent since our food came pretty quickly (around 15 minutes), and there was no need to ask the server for the cutlery. It's like they're trained to give it to you a few minutes before the desserts arrive (not too early or too late before the desserts arrive).  One downside would definitely be the prices. Although the desserts were delicious and Caffe Demetre uses quality ingredients, both of our orders were around $14. With tax included for just a party of two, the bill will come to about $30, which is quite pricey for a pure dessert place. Another downside is that the seats are a bit cramped. The other tables were pretty close to ours and there is not a lot of walking space for certain parts of Caffe Demetre. However, it wasn't claustrophobic, so it was not a big problem.  I would definitely visit Caffe Demetre again for the unique desserts especially since it's a great place to sit down and have a conversation."}
{"text":"Been about 10 years since my last visit to caffe Demetre. Like they say Once on the lips twice on the hips...or in my case on the belly.  But it was a great place to top off an excellent evening. We both had crepes and enjoyed every bit of them."}
{"text":"My first visit at this Demetre was in 2007. At that point in time, it had fantastic food and decent service. Their service worsened over the years and I got so fed up that I neglected to come here for the past 3 years (and that last visit was also really bad). I finally gave this location another chance a couple weeks ago. When we entered the establishment, there was a hostess at the front (wow, a first), and she was seating the line that was forming at the front. She did it pretty quick. The group of 6 before me was seated, and she quickly came to sit me and my friend. I wish she told us her name because she provided the best service I've ever received at this location. She handed us the menu and water simultaneously. My friend and I came here intending to share a crepe. Demetre's menu appears to have been downsized so that they may excel in delivering certain items (unless my memory is just poor and their old menu was just spaced really well). My friend and I opted for a Streetcar Named Devour, an old Demetre favourite of mine. We got this within 5-10 minutes and started digging in. It was as good as I remembered it. Our waitress (also the hostess) was pleasant throughout our stay. She was attentive and aware (I dropped my fork and she got me a new one without me having to flag her and ask). She checked on our table twice, which is two times more than I have ever gotten before. When we were done, she came over and we asked for the bill. Overall, it was a pleasant experience, and it looks like I'll be coming here for dessert again."}
{"text":"Puurfect!!! I've been here several times but the most recent visit was the best! I'm very hesitant to try anything with pumpkin so when my boyfriend suggested it, I just had to go with it. It was heaven! I did not expect it to go so well with strawberries and banana. Oh btw, we ordered the DIY waffle with nutella. We're definitely going back there while PSL is still in season."}
{"text":"I'm not from Toronto so it shouldn't surprise you when I say \"What the fuck? Caffe Demetre is a chain?\" I don't believe it. I can't believe it. I am going to go ahead and deny I even know this information. The desserts here are too ridiculously delectable to be associated with a chain like status. But I guess that's the reason why there is more than one Caffe Demetre BECAUSE it is so fucking good.   I had THEE best Carrot Cake of my life here. That's right as in never had better and probably never will have better. My life seems bleak knowing this but somehow I'll find a way to carry on my sad existence."}
{"text":"I was there on this weekend and ordered the Tongue Depressor and was very disappointed with it.  It is just one note chocolate on chocolate on chocolate.  I should have read the ice description because for a dessert to have brownie pieces on top of it I would have never guessed it would also have brownie chunks in the ice cream.  I barely got any ice cream due to the brownies in the Ice Cream.  I was very unhappy with it.   I mentioned to the server how disappointing and almost inedible (after a few bites of just ridiculous amount of chocolate) and she looked and said \"too much chocolate\".  Which seems to me it had been a complaint she had heard before.  I suggested if I could get a berry sauce to help add some other flavor dimension and she stated it would be an extra charge.  I couldn't eat it the way it was and would be charged extra.    It was very disappointing.  I got an item that was just terrible like chocolate and it was just sickening amount of chocolate.  I wasn't even going to send it back just wanted to try and fix it and was charged extra.  She was a good server besides that maybe just location policy but honestly if a customer isn't happy should try and fix it at no extra charge."}
{"text":"I come here once in a while to hang out with friends, then I remember why I always recommend other places.  If your definition of dessert is sweet on top of sweet, you will love this place. I prefer my dessert to be sweetened but also to bring out the true flavour of the main ingredient (matcha, chocolate, vanilla, etc, which is never sugar).   I tried Piece Talk and Tougue Deppressor. They give you A LOT of food, but unfortunately I don't like to share my food and had to waste more than half of it. The desserts are so sweet that I drank at least 4-5 cups of water every time. For the price and the quantity, I would prefer if they made it smaller, and put more emphasis on the true flavours instead of sugar. If you are one to share your food, this will be a great spot.  They have a cute menu and friendly service. It's a nice place for friend gathering or taking your kids to. It is definitely not a bad dessert spot, but for a foodie like me, I would much rather spend my $12 on a tiny piece of dessert at high end dessert shop that's nicely crafted."}
{"text":"Great place to go with friends, something for everyone. But it's a chain and the ice cream isn't anything special."}
{"text":"Quality was good, I ordered waffle with ice cream and banana & it was yummy, only issue was we had to wait so long to get our order due to the few waiters"}
{"text":"Terrible service. You have to beg for the attention of the waiter. Asked for ice water and received warm water. Strawberries for the crepe were not ripe and the banana's weren't appealing. Would not invest any more time/money here."}
{"text":"Great place to go after a movie or hang out with friends.  Very busy location.  Wait time to be seated was 10-15 minutes. Caf√© Demetre known for their waffles and crepes and sinful ice cream flavors and toppings. Great menu hard to chose.  I had the salted caramel ice cream, delicious. Our friends had apple pie which not only looked good but tasted amazing.  Their selection of cakes was limited to cheesecakes of different flavors. Not a fan of cheesecakes myself.  Good coffee, lattes and shakes where but a few drinks offered on the menu.  Not a place to go if you are watching calories. I started to salivate as I watched the many plates of decadent delights being served at the other tables.  I knew it had to be good by the expressions after that first bite."}
{"text":"Demetres is my go to for late night cravings or a meet spot with the ladies. I tend to come to this location because it's at a convenient location for me. Although, this particular location is alright.   The service is very slow. They do not even come to check on you once you have ordered. Three times in a row I waited for a long time until I went to the counter and paid for my bill there, and two other tables followed soon after. For a dessert place the staff is not as friendly and inviting as you would expect compared to other great desert places in Toronto now.  The decor also needs to be updated. It was nice a few years back, but it needs to change. The Bramble location has a new modern sleek look.  The food is good (uniform taste though all locations) and the presentation is very pretty, but the environment and staff of the restaurant needs improvement."}
{"text":"This place always has a long wait...guess Vaughan loves its sweets!  Service here is always spotty and orders take longer than they should. But when the orders do come, they sure will fulfill that sugar tooth of yours.  My go-tos are a crepe or waffle, served with their housemade ice cream - which is good but not the greatest I have ever had - and toppings like caramel sauce, chocolate curls, and brownies. Either can definitely be shared, as they're pretty generous with portions here."}
{"text":"The best Demetres by far. This location smokes the Woodbridge one and the one on east beaver creek.   I've had the exact same dessert \"the fork awakens\" at all three locations. This is the only location where the waffle was fresh and by fresh I mean hot and served right away when it's done. The cream wasn't melting at all. The Woodbridge location and east beaver creek all had cold waffles as if they made them ahead of time to beat the rush.   I will only go to this Demetres from now on and never go to the other ones.  T.c is the man he always makes sure this place is running proper and on point."}
{"text":"This location by far is the worst Demetries ever. Go to Richmond hill they are way better.  Here these guys never make their waffles fresh some idiot always makes them ahead of time so they are lukewarm at best. Won't ever come here again."}
{"text":"I always love going to Demetres. Best place hands down for ppl who love their sweets.  I have been to many locations, this one is great. Service and food was on point. Been to some Demetres before (woodbridge) where the waffles are made ahead of time and are not fresh. Also the dessert waits in the pass too long and the ice cream is already starting to melt by the time it gets to you. No problem with this location, especially on a Sunday night.  Only reason for 4 star and not 5, was the parking it's limited and you have to pay.   Got the \"MoLaLa\" and it was scrummmmpcheeeDoooodaLLLLEEEEee!!!!!!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing. Great service. Couldn't ask for a better staff. They were accommodating and attentive. Really got into our rambunctious conversations with us."}
{"text":"Not sure what the hype was about. We waited for 20-30 minutes for crepes-- service was HORRIBLE.. Our waiter forgot to bring us spoons and this place is a dessert place??/ (didn't get that). When we asked for it, he said \"oh yea, thaaat.\"   Also, it took a while for the desserts to come out, but it shouldn't! Crepes cook under 1.5 mintues, then they just put a dollop of ice cream and add the pre-cut fresh fruit or nuts. Also, while there were MANY items to choose from, after a while, they all really just sounded the same sans one item or two. The funky names were cute, but all three crepes we had were supposed to be different, but tasted alike.... I need real inventive variety.    Nothing that unique or inspiring... tasted nice, but definitely not worth the wait or a revisit."}
{"text":"Do not go to this restaurant.  The service is horrible, the atmosphere is horrible and the food isn't really that great.   We were served 20 minutes after being seated. Someone brought one glass of water for the two of us. The manager or whoever took our order because I don't think the waiters could figure out who should be serving us. We were served after another 20 minutes and of course there was a hair in our food. The waiter was apologetic, but I know for sure they didn't make a new plate, they just removed the hair and sprinkled some cocoa on the plate. We were also given one set of knives.  The atmosphere is a cross between a club and a diner. Loud dance music and dingy tables.   I will not be going back."}
{"text":"Wow, what a great classic Toronto landmark that's stood the test of time and evolved as a place to hang out. Great service, friendly staff and overall amazing atmosphere. We came here after watching a movie close by and to get out of the snowy winter weather and we had a decent time here. I used to live behind the original Danforth location until it went up in flames, I know it's been rebuilt but the Eglinton location maintains its charm.  If you aren't much of a dessert fan you're coming to the wrong place. Consider this your only warning, the desserts here are pretty large so you get exactly what you've paid for. The assortment of teas and coffees is pretty good to accompany that massive serving of whatever you got. Way better than the local bubble tea/dessert place which is overpriced compared to Demetre."}
{"text":"Demetres is never on the top of my list when I am craving for dessert.  It is overpriced and not very considerate of those with a nut allergy.  Despite the negative remarks, my friend and I still decided to give it a go tonight.    I have two complaints to note:  1.  We waved down one of the waitresses to request for our bill.  She was very unhelpful and approached the male waiter that was initially taking our order to assist us.  He then came to our table just to tell us that we have to pay up at the cash registry.  Why couldn't the waitress just tell us that??   2.  Demetre has decided to remove dollar signs and decimals from the prices on their menu items and resorted to using fraction of 1/4, 1/2 and 3/4.  I am perplexed as to why they would do such a thing.  Does it make it easier for consumers?  No.  Is it unique? No. Please consider redesigning your menu."}
{"text":"Yes, to Caffe Demetre anytime! I'm In love with their  gorgeous waffle with honey vanilla ice cream, slivers of strawberry, white melted chocolate drizzle and strawberry homemade coulis. Also the crepe is a bit more calorie conscious, buts so000ooo delectable with a chunky creamy  ball of honey vanilla ice cream, fresh kiwi, clementines, strawberry, banana, grapes and cantaloupe chunks.  It's  topped with whipped cream and creme englaise.  Boom, game over......!"}
{"text":"It was my second time coming to cafe demetres in Greek town with a bunch of my friends. Even though we were a big group ,the service and food was absolutely amazing!!! Totally recommend this place for people who want to have a good time and enjoy great desserts!!!"}
{"text":"I have been here around 40 times. Even though the prices increased and the menu changed, the food is exactly the same and worth every penny. The open kitchen is nice, I love to watch the chefs. The restaurant is open very late, which is great if you're going after seeing a film next door. The fruit always seems to be tasty even if it's not in season. This is one of my favourite restaurants."}
{"text":"Yummmmmmmmmmmmyyyy!!!!! Went with my cousins for the first time since I am from California's and this was delicious!"}
{"text":"Came here on Sunday around 6:30 PM. Place was busy. We ordered our desserts and coffees. Coffees arrived first. Desserts arrived 20 minutes later. Coffee turned cold by then. I undestand that the place is most likely understaffed, however it would be great if our server asked whether it was ok to serve coffee first. Desserts themselves were not bad."}
{"text":"Worse experience ever. We went with family on a Saturday night. First we waited 30 min for the waitress to approach us then all the orders came wrong. Not to mention the delays between the dishes. I received mine after 30min of ordering and after 45 min my brother and by the time I finished my plate they just served my parents. Worst service ever"}
{"text":"This is probably the worst demetres that I have EVER been to.  I went there with 6 of my friends and when we sat down, we immediately found out that the table they have given to us was filthy. Apparently they have cleaned the table but somehow forgotten the sides of the table. We told our waitress if she could clean the table again and she seemed very displeased but did it anyway and obviously, didn't wipe it well enough. We even took our napkin and a little bit of water and cleaned the table ourselves and the napkin turned grey-ish which is disgusting!! The waffle that I ordered was undercooked and soggy, the hot drink I had wasn't hot at all (more like room temperature) and some of us got our order way earlier than others so some of us has to wait longer for our desserts.  Overall, don't bother with this demetres. The one located in Courtney Park is probably the best one and the cleanest!k"}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday afternoon, not many people. I ordered The OC (Oreo Milkshake) and my girlfriend got 2 scoops of ice cream (honey vanilla & PSL).   Takeaways  1. Portions are huge so better to share 2. Food is very sweet  3. Desserts are around $7-$15  We didn't finish our order instead we finished our water because it was just too sweet. We were light headed after eating.   I would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"Portions are huge but the taste is sub par to say the least. I wish Mississauga up'ed their game with dessert restaurants like Cacao 70 or Juliette et Chocolat!!!   Update: Thank you for getting back to me. I have to say that your cafe definitely has a certain market of people very satisfied. There are many people who are very happy with the dessert at Demetre. The service is always great and the place is very clean. Unfortunately, I am looking for a dessert restaurant with less offerings but quality offerings. I'm not overly impressed by large portions, but a small serving of something of quality would be fantastic. A small flourless chocolate cake, dark chocolate fondue, premium gelato... For example.Thanks so much!"}
{"text":"Oh Cafe Demetre, why aren't you in the states?!! Having something like this would be amazing! We tried this place while in Canada for vacay, and loved it! Tikipedia is amazing, especially for starting off. Shakes are super good- definitely try the Nutella shake!"}
{"text":"Got here when the place was empty and didn't get greeted until the server came to our table to bring us menus. Food came out really quick and tasted great especially since I have a sweet tooth.  The staff didn't check on us after they brought our food until they took our plates and brought us the bill. As we were eating the two staff were sitting at a table chatting and drinking coffees.. I work as a bartender, and sitting down in the middle of the restaurant just chilling is a big service industry no-no (even if the place has like 4 people in it).  Overall I would probably go to another location eventually but would most likely avoid this one."}
{"text":"Love the crepes at Demetre's. I've been going there for many years, except I do agree with the previous reviewer. I wished that they had more fruits available and ice cream flavours, so it's not a 5."}
{"text":"The menu at Demetre's is dizzying. With the gazillion combinations that make up the many fabulous options of \"iced creams\" served in waffle cones, crepes, and yachts, one can be easily brainwashed into thinking that you want more than you'll actually be able to stomach. And even when you think you'll be conservative (to both your waist line and pocket book), you'll still end up with more than you can finish. Demetre's golden scoop is enormous. I've seen it. He's breaking all of the regulations of the Ice Cream Scooper's Union and he doesn't care.  The other night, with some ordering experience and a few extra pounds of dinner under my belt, I knew that I had to limit myself to the single scoop ($6.50). Served in a warm waffle cone with fluffy whipped cream and a maraschino cherry on top, my mint chocolate iced cream was pleasantly un-florescent and perfectly balanced between minty and chocolatey.   The decor is more Chuck E. Cheese than I would prefer for my dates and late night sugar indulgences, but I've never been there for a fete and that seems to be the only reason everyone else visits. I used to find the random light flickering during the store-wide sing-a-long of Happy Birthday ridiculous, but everything changed when I witnessed an unsuspecting employee gleefully flicking the switches manually to the music. It was amazing. I'm going to tell them it's my birthday next time just so I can watch him do it again."}
{"text":"Well i guess they have it all. They don't have anything unique and my standards for dessert is pretty high. Its your standard shake, cake, waffle and ice cream kinda place. I think the thing that kind of makes me annoyed is how big the portions are. Even their single scoop is pretty big. The plus is its open pretty late so if you have a craving, its a good place to come. Also, the ambiance is nice. Its a pretty nice place to hang out with friends."}
{"text":"Y-U-M-M-Y Y-U-M-M-Y Y-U-M-M-Y! Come in to see the cutest cafe with a sweet treat! My husband and I love coming here because we enjoy the dessert! Although the wait times are long, sometimes even at nights, I will say that my husband and I always have a good time here!"}
{"text":"My girlfriends and I have just left upset with the service that we got at this location. After we ordered we still waited at least half an hour before the first item arrived. They made my order wrong and I let the waitress know-- she apologized and brought back another wrong order a while later that was sent back to the kitchen. My girlfriend finally got her order and in the first bite she put a hair in her mouth. We decided to get up and leave right then, and I saw the waitress bringing back the same first order that was wrong to begin with. When we told her we decided to leave all we got was an \"okay, sorry\". I know sometimes service can be slow but at least you can make sure your waitresses are properly trained and you would look over your dishes to ensure proper health and safety maintenance. I don't think I will ever go back to this location again-- I wasted an hour of my life for nothing."}
{"text":"I love Caffe Demetre and will always continue to go back but this review is specifically for this WHITBY location who needs to work on CERTAIN staff members (perhaps a lesson or two will work). And judging by other reviews, it's not the first time a wonderful place has gotten a less than stellar review because of a sour individual.  Monday night, not busy at all, at 9pm - an hour before closing.  I was with my family and we ordered for almost $100.  Our waitress was wonderful the whole time, thank you so much!  Reason for the 1 star - around  9:55, they turned off the lights (not so subtle hint to leave so let's start finishing up, we get it) and another waitress who seemed to be the one in charge at that time  started clearing up our tables which is fine but then she attempted to clear up drinks that we weren't even done with! Drinks we had paid for and were still enjoying! My cousin was still HOLDING hers and when she tried to TAKE IT OUT OF HER HAND. she had to tell the girl \"umm I'm not done with that\" to which the reply was \"you know we are closed now right?\" RUDE! Perhaps this was her first job in a FOOD establishment (or ever) but I have never been expected to clear out from a place that has just struck it's closing hour if I am very near to finishing up! We know how to be considerate, i mean we wouldn't walk in 5 min to closing and stay for hours but she was being ridiculously rude.  She continued to rush us out even though it had just turned 10pm and was not apologetic at all! Her rude attitude was a completely turnoff and will direct all of us to other, friendlier, just as tasty locations."}
{"text":"I'm lactose intolerant so I tried the Ariana Sundae. It's vegan and made with Coconut Sorbetto. Most importantly, It was delicious and I can't believe it's not made with milk. I had trouble finishing it because I'm not use to eating that much ice cream/desert. It's good for sharing. The building is accessible and close to Orfus Rd outlets and Yorkdale Mall. My only concern is I wish there were more vegan options that included crepes or cakes. I hope they expand."}
{"text":"Yum! Who doesn't love freshly made crepes and waffles? Demetres always smells delicious as soon as you walk in.   Sure, it's a little on the pricier side (I think they've recently raised their prices?), but it's a great treat every so often :) The service is also great! On my last visit I had a crepe topped with apple crisp and caramel sauce ... so good!"}
{"text":"This place is definitely great for quality desserts. I ordered a Choc this Way sundae which is a great choice for chocoholics. The only issue that day was how understaffed they were. Given that this place is pretty popular, we waited quite a bit for our ice cream which was already ready and sitting on the counter for 10 minutes before our server brought them to us. Overall, a great place that I'd recommend to friends."}
{"text":"Caff√® Demetre's is definitely a sweet tooth's paradise. I have never seen a decked out menu with as many delicious-sounding dishes.   I got the Pomme Pilot and according to my friends, I had the best dessert than the rest on the table after they all tried it. It was really good but once you continue with your last couple bites, the sweetness will definitely dig in and might influence you to not finish it. I don't regret ordering it though, it definitely was tasty.  Service was pretty good considering how busy it was and the servers were cool."}
{"text":"First time visiting this place with a friend  & was still quite busy (arrived at 10.30 pm). I had a nice Pecan ice cream treat - but was too sweet for me but liked it anyway. Would visit again :-)"}
{"text":"The ice cream sundaes, strawberry granita, latte, waffles, apple pie and coffee were superb, though I think if you pay $1.50 for an extra fruit topping, which I added to my Pomme Sundae, you should get more then 5 slices on the top. The service was not so good. The waiter brought the coffee 10 minutes before he brought our iced water, making everyone wait. Then he brought the ice cream sundae last and entirely forgot my Strawberry Granita. I had to complain. Apparently my husband is weird for not ordering any ice cream with his apple pie and I am weird for wanting a strawberry smoothie with my apple sundae. Waiter, can you please just write down the order and not judge your guests with your attitude?"}
{"text":"There have been many changes to the Demetre's menu since we were last here and the changes are NOT for the better. I used to be able to order granita drinks which I loved. Not any more. I used to be able to top my ice cream desserts with nuts. Not any more. Only choice is praline, tiny little crumbs. The waiter said they had to take nuts off the menu due to people's nut allergies? I used to have a choice of fruits other than strawberries and banana. I loved kiwi and apple compote. Can't have that either. There really isn't very much choice left on the menu at Demetre's anymore. I am deeply disappointed and not coming here anymore. Thanks for breaking my dessert loving heart, Demetre's!"}
{"text":"So glad they moved across the street to a bigger and better venue. The previous place was too small for the demand, and was really slow.   The new location is decorated interestingly... Not too sure what a forest wallpaper has to do with desserts but okay!  POMME PILOT! That's all you need to know. Soooooo delicious, hits all the right spots. Apple, cinnamon, white chocolate ice cream... Need I say more?"}
{"text":"Nice coffee shop. I love their cocochanel ice cream. The portion is soooo big and enough for 2 persons.  I surely recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"I have been coming to demetres for years and I have been waiting for a 5 star experience. The food is consistently good but they always lose stars for service (I usually go to the Courtney park location) but tonight was different.   Upon entering I was immediately greeted and seated by the hostess who brought us menus, napkins, utensils and waters before our bums hit the chairs. It was a pleasant surprise because if I'm not waiting to be seated I'm usually waiting for water or for our waiter or to come back to take our order.  Our waiters name was Erica and she was delightful. She was super knowledgeable about the new menu and answered all our questions. I was super impressed with the new menu and look forward to coming back to try some of the new additions and I appreciated the pop culture references in the menu titles.   We ordered the Bella swan, toute suite and cider in the house. The Bella swan and toute suite are new waffles options that are dairy free. They were so good and definitely filled my funnel cake void (due to ribfest being rained on). I decided to order the cider in the house because I have never had apple cider. They have a regular one and this one which has vanilla, cinnamon and whip cream. It's is basically liquid apple pie! I recommend it for all my apple pie lovers. But be warned it is sweet and more then enough on its own.   Erica checked up on us throughout dessert to make sure we were ok and make small chat. She is the first waitress that has stood out at any demetre location I have visited. Thank you!"}
{"text":"The crepe and waffles here are delicious and consistent. I would give them 5 stars BUT a) it's too cold in there. I don't know if its to keep the ice cream and desserts cold but its too cold and b) the music is too loud and that's probably why my server messed up my order. C) the service is nothing special. I've never had a memorable server in all my years of coming to this location. I went last night with my boyfriend. Upon walking in I was seated immediately. For ten minutes no one came to our table. No water, no ill be with you shortly. My boyfriend and I started making jokes and seeing which ones we could make eye contact with, that didn't work. Then we tried calling a waiter walking by and they didn't hear us. Then we tried calling another one and as he couldn't hear us we called a little louder and he said \"oh ill be right with you\". Finally he came back and took our order. I told him my order and he said it was too fast and asked me to repeat it. I said it again (another two times) then he clarified do I want white chocolate chips and I said no, i would like sauce and he said ok. He came back with white chocolate chips all over my food. Then I reminded him it was sauce. He asked if he could just add sauce and I said I'd prefer he didn't. So the cooks looked frustrated and I watched carefully as they prepared my second waffle. My boyfriend being the hungry man he is offered to take the waffle if they were going to throw it out (embarrassing) which they did give to him. So I guess that counts for good service. I just think on busy nights they need a better system in place. There were multiple hostess maybe they should let the waiters know when they seat someone in their section."}
{"text":"Menu is extensive, portions are big, waffle and ice cream were delicious, service was great although the place was empty on a Friday afternoon."}
{"text":"Every time I've been to this location something or the other has gone wrong. Not having a particular item, there's been a hair in my food not once but twice and the wait is so not worth it. The one in Mississauga is way better.  Very disappointed"}
{"text":"Considering the price they charge for your dessert, this place gives back. The portions are huge. It's meant for 2 unless you skipped a meal.  The inside is a bit tacky but I do like the red walls since red is my favorite colour! However, if you come here at night, the noise level here is ridiculous. Since they have pretty high ceilings, everyone's voice just echoes back and forth making it even hard to hear myself speak!  I ordered some apple pie with white chocolate ice-cream and it was not memorable at all. The apple pie wasn't good and the crust wasn't as hard as I wanted it to be. The ice cream was a bit rich, but I didn't really like it.  I sampled my sisters triple ice-cream sundae thing which was REALLY rich and chocolately. BLEH. However, my cousins waffle was not bad. Can't really go wrong with waffles. My other cousin got a nutella and banana crepe which again, you can't go wrong with the already-made nutella at hand with ripe bananas. Yummy. But I didn't wanna order that 'cause you can buy a 700ml nutella + bananas for less than the price she paid.  Overall:  Y'no."}
{"text":"Caffe Demetre on Danforth used to be so good! Or I used to have poorer judgement...  I've always enjoyed my visits there in the past- the waffles and crepes were great, along with the ice cream and toppings served on them. They used to feel overloaded.  The last two visits there have been very disappointing. During the last visit, my friend and I shared a chocolate-y waffle. It tasted really dry and they really skimped out on the toppings. This time around, I really hoped that the last visit was just bad luck. I ordered an apple, peanut, and caramel crepe with honey vanilla ice cream. The crepe was far too chewy, and to my dismay, the apples were cold (and they are gooey so it tasted kind of gross). The peanuts were half peanuts that are usually found in supermarket tin cans. The waiter was really nice- nothing wrong with the service."}
{"text":"Definitely visit this place if you have a sweet tooth. Great vegan options as well.  We began with an Espresso Double Shot with Almond MIlk and \"Make Your Mango Crazy\" (Mango Smoothie). Espresso was great. I didn't really need the almond milk - coffee was great. Mango smoothie was very good - tasted very much like the mango juice in India. For desserts, we went for an Ariana Sundae and Pomme Pilot. Ariana Sundae is essentially bruleed banana, maple coconut caramel sauce with praline croquant. It was great - a little more towards the sweet side. Definitely to be tried if you are a vegan. Pomme Pilot, which is essentially oven baked apple crisp with butter caramel sauce and a cinnamon streusel - was good. The portion was US-style - very huge. Good enough tor 2 people if you just want to enjoy and not stuff your stomach. It is NOT vegan, so vegan folks need to take care.  Overall, the place is great to enjoy some amazing desserts and even an great shot of espresso."}
{"text":"This location is decent. It's super convenient on the Danforth for when you want a dessert run. Dining area is nice and spacious. It can be a little loud when there are a lot of people there, but most of the time you can hear conversation just fine. They've also extended their hours, so that's a plus when I want cake at 11pm.   Their menu got a makeover with a bunch of punny names for every item. I had the chocolate cake with ice cream (Cocoa Ono) and it was great. Portion was huge, could barely finish it. I've also had the cheesecake with fruit (Fruit & Tie), and it was just okay. Tasted stale, and the bottom was rubbery and totally inedible.   Staff and service are awful. I've been here multiple times and service has always been sub-par at best. Barely know their own menu, even though the new one's been out for months now. It's at least a 15-20 minute wait time from ordering something to it being in front of you. Had to wait over 10 minutes when we were done our meal because waiter was impossible to find, and then just decided to take his time.   It has a dependable chocolate cake, so I'll probably keep coming back. I'll probably also keep slightly regretting it after."}
{"text":"Dessert was great the only part I didn't like is that my waiter was literally starring at us eat it was so uncomfortable.."}
{"text":"Service was decent. Focused mainly on the dessert served which was good Menu was filled with too many options.   Ordered Sliced Banana Split & some waffle with bananas (forgot what it's called)"}
{"text":"Caffe Demetre was the first place I ever tried waffle/crepe with ice cream on top - hard to believe how amazed I was back then about something so common now. Fast forward to 2016, and oh my have things things fallen for this place....  To be honest, I was surprised that Caffe Demetre was still even open. When my friend and I had a sudden craving for ice-cream, we decided to check this place out...and was quickly reminded about why I probably stopped coming here so many years back. The dessert options here still suffice, but are pretty much just on par now with most other dessert places/cafes in terms of selection and quality...the service and management here though literally had me shaking my head.  We were actually surprised at how popular this place still is, but were fine waiting in a short line for our turn to be seated. What was a bit of a turn-off though was watching servers and the manager repeatedly walk right by empty tables (there were at least 3), without realizing it might be a good idea to quickly clean them off and actually seat some of the patrons standing in the growing and increasingly crowded line-up. At first I considered that perhaps they were understaffed, or busy with something else, until I noticed staff members literally just standing around and joking with each other.   I do like how customers are able to customize their crepe/waffle topics - I went with the \"Roche\" ice-cream, with white-chocolate sauce and roasted nuts on a waffle, and it tasted great! What was much less great however was the $15 cost. $15 for a waffle and ice cream, really?   The fact that the server got my order wrong TWICE, was also a bit frustrating...my friend was not pleased either with the glass of water that arrived at our table, as it was only about 1/4 filled, an looked as though it might have just been another customer's leftovers lol.  I don't know if this place recently changed management or not, but the lifeless expression on the face of our server screamed \"I hate my job.\" So...with the poor table management, inaccurate orders (without even cursory apology), unfriendly demeanor of servers, cheque-pushing, and sky-rocketed prices, I can say that it will again be another long time before I come back to Caffe Demetre...at least to this location."}
{"text":"I'm usually willing to ignore the increasingly high prices at Demetre's locations, because their desserts (especially their ice cream) are still high quality. Unfortunately, horrible service appears to be a pattern now, with this location definitely not an exception.  At first, I assumed that the rude service we received was just another case of disinterested highschool kids, not being too invested in a temporary job...but when I read through other reviews, and the long history of terrible customer service, I'm starting to suspect these kids might be related to the owners?? How else have they not been fired by now?   Our server Shabnam seated us at a sticky/dirty table, and looked annoyed when we asked her to actually wipe the table (gasp!). She and her co-worker ignored us several times as we tried to flag them down to order - the place was not busy either, they just preferred to chat. When seeking clarification about the confusing descriptions of one of the dishes, our server wouldn't (couldn't?) offer a simple explanation regarding the ingredients.   The disappointing banana split we ended up trying did not come close to making up for the server's poor attitude - it was small and filled mostly with whipped cream. I love the Roche ice cream here, but I think I'm done with Demetre's until they clean up their act (and their tables!)."}
{"text":"Go to spot for dessert. The menu is literally massive with lots of mouthwatering choices accompanied with quite punny names. I usually end up building my own waffle - choice of three toppings with the option of ice cream. Love love love the Belgian waffles. Worth the extra. Of course, these desserts are almost as massive as the menu and are best shared.  The service is friendly enough although the ratio of waitstaff to tables is a bit atrocious so water refills are pretty much nonexistent. I do find the tables are a bit small and on crowded nights, table arrangements and chairs makes it hard to walk around.   I can't say I've actually finished a dessert here on my own yet but I always try! One day."}
{"text":"Such delicious dessert HEAVEN!!!! Worth the price for the amount of deliciousness you are getting."}
{"text":"My order was flooded with chocolate ice cream and it gave me a cavity. Do not recommend going here and this is not a good place to have a birthday party."}
{"text":"Waffles and ice cream, coffee, and red velvet cake were good for after-dinner treat. It is a place to go if you really need to satisfy your sweet tooth.  Noise level is too loud for first dates because of bare floors, walls, glass windows, but that shouldn't be an issue if your date is crappy and you want to drown out the person talking to you (or not talking to you for that matter).  Can smell their bathroom cleaner chemicals from my table, but I wasn't seated close to the bathroom at all. Don't like that experience.  Don't come here in the winter because there's no second door/storm door to the cafe, so each time people swing open their door, a cold draft comes in. And if there's a wait for seating, people keep the door open to shuffle groups half-in half-out so they don't have to stand in the cold."}
{"text":"Great place! Had the waffle with one scoop of ice cream with Apple crisp, pralines and caramel. Daughter had the crepe. Delicious!!"}
{"text":"I love their crepes. I really do! I love the dessert titles a little more than the actual dessert though :)) I couldn't help but to giggle when I ordered something that ended with Moomoo! lol Our bill came to $40.  A waffle and a crepe with Nutella and ice cream in both is more than enough for a party of 5 people. By the end of this experience we were all so full that we could barely get up and leave our table.  Ah... good times!  I wish the tables weren't so close to the counter though. I definitely makes it difficult to get out of your chair, especially if you had too much dessert!  LOL Also, you need to pay for parking which sucks!"}
{"text":"I was craving good caffeinated drinks and decided to go here instead of the old boring starbucks with my cousin. We went on a Sunday and it was quite busy, mostly families with small kids and couple of young folks were sitting next to our table. We were quickly seated by the young waiter. I ordered a latte with the tiramisu ice cream and cheese cake. My cousin ordered black tea and the Nutella banana crepe. I wish I had ordered a different dessert because what I had in mind was completely different from what the description said. There was a small chunk of cheesecake hidden under a massive amount of tiramisu flavoured ice cream. It tasted ok, but I was not entirely satisfied. I was expecting more cheesecake and less ice cream.  The latte on the other hand was delicious and way different from ordinary drinks.  My cousin liked her crepe and tea.  So, in short: yay for the drinks, nay for the cheesecake"}
{"text":"We always visit this place whenever we can. The desserts here are tasty, have big portions, and lots of variety. I know that the prices may seem much to some people but for the portions I think they are competitive. It's not some random place that sells desserts. This place is nice and decorated...not upscale but it's a nice place for late night meeting and desserts.   This place has good service and I have never had any issues. I have been coming for years and ordered many different things from the menu. It's always packed...so that should tell you something. Especially weekends are the busiest. In the summer they have a small patio for outdoor seating which is a nice touch."}
{"text":"Now this is something. A great redefinition of dessert with weird funny names to their platters.  Budget friendly and huge platters that can be good for two.  A date there would be sweet and nice."}
{"text":"Grabbed a movie at AMC and decided to hop by here after for a quick sweet bite. We ordered a chocolate/peanutbutter crepe. the portion was large enough to share. It wasnt anythign mind blowing... but it was good. this place is very nostalgic. I used to come here ALL THE TIME when i was younger with my friends. this was the palce to go. And it was ncie to see other kids/youth also here enjoying themselves. The annoying bday music made me a bit crazy but i hope this place sticks around.... its in the perfect location and really a sweet way to end a date or to hang out with friends."}
{"text":"Worst customer services plus waitress a rude . We waited an hour to get a table for 3 once we were sat down waited for 20 min for waitress to come over for our order! Waited 30 min for our  dessert to come out! Worst experience ! Will never return!"}
{"text":"The desserts we ordered looked as good as they tasted, great. The decor was looked upon as an odd jumble of lighting and objects on the walls, looked like they threw a supplier catalogue at the wall and ceiling and used those pages.  We got there just before the evening rush and the order took a long time to be taken. Yes I was asked just after being seated but my party didn't join me until a moment later. It then took a long time, long enough to notice. Once ordered the items arrived in good time. Almost had to ask for the bill too. These small issues could have got us out of there as much as fifteen minutes earlier and allowed some of those now waiting for seating, a place."}
{"text":"Came by again with a friend just to hang out. It really does seem like they fixed the problem with waiters that they used to have.  The service was great, they were friendly and very helpful whenever I had a question. The food never disappoints, I love the cheesecakes and ice cream :)  Will be coming back again!"}
{"text":"What major disappointment! We used to be regulars at Demetre caf√© in many of its locations, but Alot of them has been shutting down within the past year and this location is one of the very few that are still there  However, it seems like it has been sold to franchisees or whatever the case is, because the menu is different, the atmosphere is different, the prices, quality and service is all at rock bottom level  Starting with the menu, where at lost its pretty and cool design, pictures and feeling, it is now just a boring list of items that you can find at any mediocre caf√© with nothing special On top of this, they were out of many of the basic items such as chocolate cake, white chocolate cake, raspberry sauce, etc.  The taste was absolutely terrible, this Cafe used to have delicious top notch desserts, now it really is very similar to a 5 pound pack that you can buy at your local grocery store  As for service, again it's nothing different from the above, the servers are rude, we wear three people and wanted to sit at a booth was the place 95% empty, and Sherif used to sit us at the six people table because it is for six people, keeping in mind that there are at least five or six versus like that and they are all empty  Finally, Frases have at least doubled or so, We used to get two items and two coffees an average of about $17-$19 bill with the tap, this time our bill was $30 plus for two desserts only with no drinks,it is a price I would be happy to pay for something worth that, but certainly not press  What a tragedy ending for this great name that it was once!"}
{"text":"The new cafe is beautiful inside very cute and retro. The food is more or less the same as it was before, but I swear the portions got bigger. I got a slice of cake with ice cream on the side and the slice of ice cream - yes a SLICE of ice cream, not a scoop - was bigger than my cake."}
{"text":"I was really craving for dessert yesterday and I said I had to have it.. I got it!! I took it to go because we were in a hurry, I wasn't expecting it to look all beautiful and saucy and wonderful! I got the banana kinadict or whatever that waffle was called.. it had Caramelized Bananas on it with melted Nutella and strawberry sauce and strawberries and lots of whipped cream (Which I Love) and it had a Big Chunk of Banana Ice cream and the best part was it wasn't to sweet! It was light and creamy, with a very light banana taste (Not Over Powering).. I would definitely come here again for this! I was the first customer there, walked right in as soon as the employee unlocked the doors at 2pm and he made my waffle fresh! I ate it in the car, I couldn't wait to get home! I finished the rest at home! I love waffles!"}
{"text":"Went to Demetre during dinner time before the movies with my boyfriend. It wasn't busy at that time but we stood waiting at the entrance while the 2 waitresses walked back and forth, making no efforts in making eye contact or acknowledge our presence. When we were finally seated, for some reason they took us to the table at the far end of the restaurant where he washrooms were located rather than to a table closer to the other guests. It was hard to flag the waitress down for ordering since we were seated so far away from the rest of the group. We finally got to order a scoop of ice cream but it took 30 mins to receive it. Nothing special about the ice cream but the customer service at this location is awfully terrible. My visit to Demetre was my first and last."}
{"text":"So I generally have a hard time when I go for dinner on the Danforth, because as much as I want baklava at the restaurant, I have to keep in mind that I will REALLY WANT Demetres afterwards. Always.  Demetres is heaven for anyone who loves ice cream or treats. You can basically customize whatever you want in the form of ice cream or crepes, waffles, etc, with all sorts of delicious toppings and sauces.  Like I said, the only problem is finding room for all the delicious food. Come to Demetres before your dinner to make it easier on your belly."}
{"text":"Yummy but too experience. One ice cream with crepe or waffle was around 15 dollars include tax."}
{"text":"I had my first dessert experience here on a surprisingly packed Friday night. Ended up sitting in a corner table, which might have contributed to the somewhat lackluster service. Ordered the Cappuccino Royale waffle, which came with affogato ice cream, brownie chunks and chocolate chips. While I would say the waffle was good - soft waffle, delicious ice cream - and the portion was sufficiently large, I have to admit I was slightly underwhelmed. I guess I was expecting the ice cream to have a stronger coffee flavour, so I was a little disappointed that it didn't. It tasted more like caramel. Also I thought the brownie chunks were too hard and dry, and would have preferred for them to be softer.   However, overall I would say it was pretty decent dessert, although kind of overpriced (like $13 for a waffle?) and over commercialized. They have a very vast menu though, and lots of things looked really good, so I would not be opposed to coming again and trying something else."}
{"text":"Located in the Whitby Entertainment Centrum and right beside the AMC Theatres, it's a great place for some after dinner or after movie desert.  They offer a wide selection of artisan ice cream for sundaes and milkshakes as well as crepes, bound to please the sweet tooth in anyone. Their selection is more on the chocolatey sweet side; fruit options are mostly strawberry based although there is a crepe that includes a medley of fruits you would find in a traditional 'fresh fruit mix' (melons, etc.)   I made my own sundae with Nutello ice cream (hazelnut chocolate with bittersweet fudge) topped with spiced apples and white chocolate chips. It was pretty good though next time I would counter the rich ice cream with something a bit more neutral or acidic. It was a good sized portion, perfect for sharing. All sundaes come with a waffle wafer and whipped cream with a maraschino cherry. Prices are moderate, $7-$10 per dessert item."}
{"text":"This place is THE place to INDULGE!! I always feel guilty eating desserts but this is one of those places I never regret. We get the customize your own waffle most of the time and it's heavenly! Their waffles are so warm and fluffy and the mix of cold ice cream and waffle carb in your mouth is amazing. I love how you can choose 3 toppings and they range from different sauces like Nutella, or fruits like strawberry, apple crisp, and other good assortments. You can always mix and match and have a different flavour each time! They have an interesting delicious selection of ice cream.  Only thing that bothered me was how busy this location is and the service is very very slow. Waited 10 mins for water and to be able to order. I tried to flag down waiters and a lot of times they would see me and make eye contact but ignore me because I'm not their table, they wouldn't even answer me with \"your waiter is coming\", they'd just literally ignore you."}
{"text":"The first time back to Demetre's in over a year (my second choice for dessert since Spin was closed) and not much has changed.   The service was okay, the dessert wasn't bad, but nothing exciting. Same old Demetre's, just the way I left it.   Used to have the dessert game on lock, but with so many other dessert options out there, Demetre's, you've got to step it up!"}
{"text":"Demetres is a classic!  The renovations make this place way more youthful/hip than they used to be. Demetres is a little expensive compared to other dessert options but the ambience of the place makes up for this a little bit.  A crepe with ice cream is about $14.50 and the waffle is $15.50. I shared the Splitsonian crepe,  which has strawberries, bananas and Nutella. We didn't realize till later we can still build our own crepes and it will cost the same! We might try that next time.   This location was BUSY on a Saturday night at 11PM. Didn't have to wait long but it was pretty much at full capacity."}
{"text":"I love Demetre's and I have been to Yorkdale location and Chester location in Toronto. Both of those places were amazing. They gave you a good amount of toppings on your crepe/waffle and the service was always excellent.  I have been to this Mississauga location a few times and every time it is the same thing! The service is horrible. You're being ignored the whole time and they don't refill your water while you're eating. They get busy, and I feel as though they do these things to rush you out so they can seat the next guests waiting in line. And if you complain to the manager, she will not care. They also seat as many people as possible at a table to the point that your plates are touching and there is no extra space on the table. \"It is their policy\".  I have been there once right before they closed and if they wanted us to eat quickly, they should have said something or they shouldn't have seated us. We ordered and got our food right away and 10 minutes later they dimmed the lights because they were closed. All the other guests left (me and my guests were still eating) and they started vacuuming and no one once came over to check up on us and so they dimmed the lights even further...as though it was them telling us to leave. We ended up leaving right after. I will never go back to that location.  Demetre's waffles and crepes are delicious though! And their cheesecakes."}
{"text":"Love this place! I've been here a handful of times after a movie or dinner. The location is prime right across from the busy Colussus plaza.   The crepes menu is overwhelming with several great combinations. Portions are large! If you're grabbing dessert after dinner defiantly explore the option of sharing.  Prices are fair at slightly over $10 for a crepe with ice cream and all the toppings. Keep in mind a Belgian waffle is a cheap upgrade that I think is well worth it!  Le Pommier & Moo La La are my two personal favourites. They also allow you to create your own combination so you can pick exactly what your craving.  4.5 stars. Every visit has consisted of good service and a delicious dessert. Well recommended hangout spot in Woodbridge."}
{"text":"I personally would not come to this location ever again. I've been twice on a date and it was horrible service and the food did not taste like it does other times ive been at other locations. Its very small and not very clean."}
{"text":"Horrible service and rude servers! The ice cream is way over priced! Too busy and extremely crowded! Everyone is squished together like sardines!! Not a place to go on a first date!"}
{"text":"As several others have mentioned, the service is far from spectacular. The staff is highly inattentive. The majority of the times, you'll find the waitresses standing around giggling with one another.  The food could use some revision as well. I had some sort of waffle topped with apples, whipped cream, and ice cream.   While the flavors were fair, the dessert took on the form of a pur√©ed dish of some sort. There was no textural contrast about the dessert. It was soft on soft on soft. Everything was mushy. The waffles were flimsy and read more as a pancake. Had they cooked their waffles longer, the vessel be able to stand up to the toppings, rather than falling prey to the mountain of apples and cream.  The dish was crying out for some sort of textural note, which they failed to appeal to. This was by no means a $16 dessert. Skip the mediocre offerings and take your money elsewhere."}
{"text":"Giant desserts!!! If you are going to share, choose the waffles. Crepes are big but you can do it! Waffles are worth to share. Milkshakes are also delicious. Be prepared to an overdose of sugar."}
{"text":"It's definitely delicious but way too sweet for my tastes! I suggest you share a plate because that sugar is going to hit you real quick! But definitely go with a group so everyone can share!"}
{"text":"Probably one of my favourite dessert places now! We got the Spiltsonian on a Belgian waffle and the Moo La La on a Belgian waffle. Both of them were delicious, however I would recommend the Moo La La on a Belgian waffle!   The waiters were attentive and friendly, however they had two waitresses helping us at the same time, and they both got so confused which took long for orders, to pay the bill, etc.. hopefully they can fix that issue. However, I will def. be back :)"}
{"text":"First time back here since they renovated and think there is a new set of owners. Really nice new decor but for some reason think they had a problem with heating because it was incredibly warm and humid in here today! Service was a bit slower than it used to be and the serving  size of cake seems to have shrunk compared to before. I'll probably give them another chance since I still like their desserts."}
{"text":"Everybody raves about this place as the -to-go destination for dessert fanatics, but, honestly, I don't see what the big deal is. Everything is way overpriced and the quality of the desserts is mediocre at best.   I had the crepe with ice cream and my girlfriend had the banana split.  The crepe looked amazing as i was about to dig in, but once I got a taste of it, I knew that they hadn't made it themselves and were probably buying them in packages. A girl just knows.  On the other hand, the banana split was delicious! The right amount of everything you expect on a traditional banana split!  This is a place that everyone should visit once, to get it over with, and never return again because you've found a much more reasonably priced dessert cafe."}
{"text":"Cute dessert place  It smelled really nice upon arriving. I ordered the Piece talks. It came with the red velvet cheesecake torte topled with cream cheese icing and white chocolate ice cream.It was very sweet but the ice cream balanced it out. Really enjoyed it. My friends ordered the splitsonian and tongue depressor. They really enjoyed their dishes too. Overall great experience but for some reason when I got home I felt like i had food posioning. Not 100 percent sure if this was the cause but i only ate this prior. Def will come back though because its worth it, very yummy desserts in greektown!"}
{"text":"I'm a dessert person, but I don't drop everything when I'm asked to go. Their food is kinda pricey, but their portions are a bit bigger & super fancy looking, so it's kinda justified.  Overall, I'd go there if I was in the area. The quality is good, the service is good unless it's packed, then it gets slow, but it's understandable. Overall, this place is good."}
{"text":"This is the 2nd Demetre I have been to. And by far my favorite. It is large and spacious. Plenty of friendly staff. Food yummy as always."}
{"text":"Came here yesterday evening after a visit to The Burgers Priest (pro-tip: don't go there if you can avoid it) and was pleasantly surprised by the decor - LOVE the nature wall at the back! The neon signs on the walls were very nice and even the lighting was unique and pretty.  My friend and I were promptly seated, and given menus and water. We decided on the Pomme Pilot on a waffle between the two of us, which was well worth it. Basically tastes like a deluxe apple pie - make sure to get waffle, streusel AND ice cream all in the same bite! It started to get busy around 8 pm, and it was hard to flag our server down for the bill, but overall I would definitely visit again! This location has great decor, great vibes, is clean and quiet (for 7 PM on a Monday, anyways). Definitely go here if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"This place is not worth it to me. It's just so so. I only go for a rare special occasion. We were going to celebrate a birthday and stopped in for a slice of cake and some ice cream.   The place was not busy at all but yet service was still super slow. We had to call for someone's attention to take our order because I think they forgot about us.   The dessert itself was not great either. We ordered the Oreo milkshake and the only Oreo included was sprinkled on top. The milkshake itself was mostly Nesquick syrup. We also ordered strawberry ice cream and it melted very quickly. And the other item we ordered was the red velvet cheesecake. It did not taste like cheesecake at all. Mostly just icing and way too sweet. And overall this place is really over priced. Not interested in returning any time soon."}
{"text":"After 15mins being seated we asked if we could order. The waiter said he'll get us a waiter...after another 5 mins we asked another waiter if we could order and he said he'll get us a waiter..another 5 mins go by and a waiter came to take our orders. She asked us if we wanted water and we said just bring us one glass and another waiter brings us 4 glasses. Then all of a sudden the first waiter we spoke to brought us the check when we haven't received our food yet. It wasn't even for our table. We waited another 20mins for them to bring us a slice of cake and ice cream. When we were done we flagged for a waiter to bring us the check and he stops to look at us and walks to another table. We asked our waiter to bring us the check and we waited 10mins to only find out its sitting at the front desk with the cashier while our waiter is sweeping the floors."}
{"text":": Cafe Demetres : Piece Talks : Cafe Demetres is a gem but unfortunately I have to drive 30 minutes to have it! I love their red velvet cake but piece talks is a bit too sweet for me. Recommend to only get the red velvet cake. : Very sweet  : $13"}
{"text":"I want this place to be good, I really do. It's got a great atmosphere, good lighting and not bad service but, this might be the worst dessert place in all of Toronto. I've been here four times and every time I leave in disbelief of how terrible it is. Everything is incredibly processed, cheap ingredients and very tasteless. The crepes taste like paper and even the ice cream is flat. It blows me away that they can get these simple desserts so wrong. Do yourself a favour and save your time and calories for somewhere else. ...Or Caffe Demetre, you have all the right ingredients to be fantastic, so step it up."}
{"text":"placed an order for take out, 3 pieces of cake. They forgot 1. I called when I got back to my hotel and noticed to try and get a refund since I didn't feel like walking all the way back. After putting me on hold for 10 min they said they couldn't. So I walked back.   Since I was there I decided to just take the cake over the refund. The cake came with ice cream so they made me a fresh one. I asked if I could have the old one since there was a homeless guy outside my hotel, they wouldn't give it to me. After first screwing up my order then not being able to give me a refund and making me walk back they rather throw out food then give it to a person in need."}
{"text":"The food is great! I always order a vegan sundae (I have a dairy allergy) and it is one of the only dessert places with a few allergen friendly options.  HOWEVER, the wait and the way you are seated is terrible! I have gone several times and you have to force your way to the front to ask to have your name put on the list.  There is no room to wait and you often are literally on top of other people waiting and trying to move when people leave (it's the same entry and only one door is open). There are often several empty tables (both cleaned and uncleaned) that sit there for 10-20 minutes before the host seats you. The table I was sat at (table for 2) had been open and cleaned for the entire 20 minutes we waited. The host will often debate whether to clean tables, take out menus then put them back, and overall has no idea how to properly seat people.  He also sat us at a booth that could have easily sat 4-5 people when there were groups of 4-5 in front of us! The problem is not the lack of space but staff who clearly don't know how to count!"}
{"text":"Tried out their Street Car named Devour with their waffle upgrade. It is chocolate ice cream which is just right in terms of sweetness. It had a few strawberries as well which enhanced the flavor. Only thing was their whipped creme was a bit on the non rich side, but that did not really stop me.   Anyway I only ate half since we ordered to share. I recommend doing that unless you want to gain weight.   Free wifi is a very nice bonus."}
{"text":"Portion sizes are very big, even a single scoop of ice cream in a waffle cone is enormous. Staff are friendly and efficient, and good with my young son.  But there is one major down side to here: Why, oh why, does a business that specialises in desserts feel that it's ok to use edible oil and not real whipped cream? The oil tastes nasty and is virtually inedible without making you feel nauseous. If Demetre would start using real whipped cream instead of the vile oil product I would definitely give more than 3 stars."}
{"text":"Great comeback. Really nice decor. Still as good as before. Lots more choices. Some minor changes but new stuff is just as good.   Will definitely return to sample them all."}
{"text":"If you're in the mood for an over-the-top, sugar-coma inducing, beautiful dessert, then look no further than Demetres. I don't have much of a sweet tooth, but have been to several of their locations and have always enjoyed what I've ordered. The presentation is always particularly inviting - everything comes out photo-shoot ready.  On this particular occasion, three of us shared the Say Cheese (Cheesecake + Strawberries). The cheesecake was very good - a little sweet, but the whipped cream balanced it out nicely. The only drawback was the slow service. Even for a Tuesday evening, the place was quite busy and it looked like there was only one waiter on the floor. That said, if you're not in a rush, it's worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Ice cream is good , the courteousness was badly lacking from the servers. The ambience was oknok with parking being a pia. Possibly will be in the look out for better ice cream parlours."}
{"text":"I have been doing to this Caffe Demetre for about 10 years now and have only had a few mishaps (one time was so bad I actually wanted to leave and not pay). When I came in for 8:00pm with a friend we were seated promptly and our waiter came right away for our drink order. The portions here are way generous and I feel like I could have shared with my friend. My friend got a crepe with vanilla ice cream, caramel, and glazed apples. I got the chocolate cheese cake. Everything was super tasty. I was so full and probably should have gone to the gym afterwards.  More into our visit the service from our waiter was getting a bit sparse but when I asked him why he told me that they were short staffed. He was still able to check up on us a few times which was nice."}
{"text":"Stopped by here to satisfy a sweet tooth craving. We ordered what's called the Interstellar and the Sweetcar Named Devour. Both delicious and were very large portions, we both couldn't finish our plates. Service was good and the waitress always made sure we had water.   Overall, nice place if you're really craving something sugary. Super cute for a date on the danforth."}
{"text":"Hadn't been to Demetris in a while...cake and coffee was great...our server Megan was polite and courteous...she did a wonderful job...will be back!"}
{"text":"After having dinner at a neighbouring greek restaurant I decided to hop on over to Demetres to satisfy my sweet tooth!  The menu here is hugeee packed with an array of fresh made ice creams, crepes, waffles, cakes, shakes, and coffee drinks!  I was craving ice cream and they had two flavours which immediately jumped out at me a peanut butter one and a coffee tiramisu ice cream. Our waitress was nice and gave us plenty of time and some suggestions because I couldn't decide on a flavour she said I should go for the peanut butter one but i could get two scoops for a $1 more so i decided on getting both!  They serve two huge scoops in a fresh made waffle cone piled in a tall glass topped with whipped cream and a cherry on top!  The coffee tiramisu ice cream was good but not my favourite..... i was expecting a stronger coffee flavour but it was much more milder with stronger cinnamon and honey flavours with graham crackers pieces in it. But the peanut butter ice cream was out of this world soooo good! Sweet cream ice cream blended with peanut butter with chopped peanuts just the perfect balance! and the waffle cone was nice and warm and sweet also!  I will definately be returning for a double scoop of there fresh made peanut butter ice cream!"}
{"text":"This is one the prettiest Demetres I've been to perhaps because its a newer location. The inside boasts lots of colorful decor which gives off a whimsical feeling. There is a nice patio outside which is great to enjoy a giant ice cream on a hot summer's day.  Upon entering we were kindly greeted and taken to a cozy seat by the window. Our waitress was really friendly and went over the menus with us and told us to close em up when we were ready to order and she'd be over. Demetres offers a great selection of crazy ice cream creations, milk shakes, smoothies, coffee drinks, crepes and waffles plus they have a cake display case with changing selections.  Our Orders:  Sub Zero Latte - A frosty blend of single shot espresso, sweetened cream & milk, ice, Honey Vanilla ice cream, whipped cream and cinnamon This tasted amazing! Just like a sweetened frozen latte! It was pretty huge as well, I believe it was 14oz.  Double Scoop Ice Cream Peanut Butter Overload - Rice peanut butter flavour, salty pan roasted peanuts, pure dark chocolate chunks & fudge swirl Chocolatta - Melted Bitter Sweet Chocolate & Sweet Cream I adored the peanut butter ice cream it was sweet and salty with the bits of peanuts and the chocolate ice cream was nice and creamy and not overly sweet  The only thing I didn't like about the sundae was the waffle they topped the sundae with was still kinda raw not crisp at all. When I told the waitress about it she said they were having problems with there waffle machine and lots of other tables complained of the same thing however nothing was done about it? Another inconsistency I noticed about this place is that portion sizes of ice cream differed alot! I saw some single scooped sundaes that looked much bigger than my double scoop and other double scooped sundaes that looked smaller & larger than mine as well.   Overall it is a really nice location with amazing dessert selections. Perhaps the inconsistencies were to due the mass amount of students working there?"}
