{"text":"$1oylster is definitely a steal. Not sure how often they offer such promotion though. Nice modern & chill atmosphere. A bit quiet on a Saturday night though, like less than half of the restaurant filled. Menu is extremely selective, with main focus on appetizers to share. All the options we tried were pretty good and original. Had enjoyed the experience."}

What a freakin mess!

Haven't given a one stay review in a long time but these guys are legit a mess. They signed up for oyster mania but then lose their minds when people come in? 

One star goes to the over worked shucker who I seen sweating like crazy trying to get the oysters out. Oysters were done great and I didn't have any funky ones so no complaints there. 

Now let's get to the good stuff.
We showed up looking for a great dinner and of course we got nothing short of a nightmare. The tables were dirty nobody was doing anything. Our \"waiter\" said he would prep a table for us. Went in the back took some calls so we decided to seat ourselves. 

The guy who came by looks like he should be working as a bus boy or at a pub not this kind of establishment. We were asking what kind of wine comes with the oysters and of course he just said \"blanc\" we looked over the wine list and the prices were ridiculous ( all over $50) we asked about some items and the guy had the audacity to sit their biting his nails while answering our question about the wine. Beyond disgusted I didn't say anything but the way he answered us after about the price was insulting he spoke with the rudest slang in French just not customer friendly. The same
Guy came us to us to tell us oh we're over whelmed it will take time for your oysters. After 45 minutes I had to flag someone down and ask the blonde manager I guess who she was for a menu and maybe some water. They turned the lights almost all the way down lucky I had my lighter in my purse to light our candle on our table.

Two girls beside us ordered the shrimp which they didn't touch and sent back as well as the ravioli. Once my boyfriend saw that we decided to make a reservation at OTHYM because we couldn't bare to spend one more minute in this place.

I don't give them more than a year this is a really poorly run restaurant, with rude staff and not professional at all. The manager (blonde lady) was to busy filling up some older grey haired mans glass of wine free poor then come around to actually check on the customers. Unbelievable.

The worst part was the table beside us when we sat down didn't leave much as a tip a few nickles and dollar. I watched the long haired red headed waitress pick it up roll her eyes and go up to our waiter open her hand to show what kind of tip was left behind and he rolled his eyes as well.

Get your sh*t together ! You're lucky you guys got a tip from who ever was there before us because the service was beyond unbearable. I will not return I will not recommend. 

0 stars minus the oysters so they get 1."}

{"text":"Nous sommes allés à l'occasion de l'oystermania (douzaine d'huîtres avec un verre de vin blanc). 

Les huîtres sont fraîches. On n'a rien commandé d'autre, c'est donc difficile de juger la nourriture. Le resto est bien situé à côté de métro st-laurent et a une terrasse en avant!"}
