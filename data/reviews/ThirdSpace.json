{"text":"It's a cool little place with some eclectic shops just outside. The service at lunch was quick, the ice ginger black tea was tasty, and the Greek salad with gyro meat was delicious."}
{"text":"The Manhattan sandwich was fresh and spectacular!  The potato salad was rich and delicious,  while the couscous was playful and light.  The quiche was perfect.  Great draft beers and the service was friendly and helpful. 

Thank you!"}
{"text":"Great place for a relaxed dinner. Ask the owner to tell you about the history of the place. WWII barracks make up the coffee shop, hair salon, eyeglass repair shops that ring the courtyard where live musicians play. Terrific tortilla soup in the Third space and a great white coffee in the coffee shop."}
{"text":"Good food. Funny comedy shows every Thursday (free). Parking is wonky,  but on the street parking is there."}
{"text":"Great food....the green chili pork tostada & chicken tortilla soup were delicious and just the right size for lunch! Nice work chef!!!"}
{"text":"I appreciated Neil's response to my first review so much so I decided to give ThirdSpace a second try and I am so glad I did. Our server Erica was the absolute best, super friendly and helpful, and our food was really yummy and served to us in a timely manner. I will keep coming back."}
{"text":"Bourbon bacon! House made pickles! Unique and delicious sandwiches....I'll be eating here again."}
{"text":"this place rules!

went 9pm on a sunday night, hadn't eaten in like 6 hours.
thought all hope was lost on something good to eat late night west of 7th ave on roosevelt in the evening, that wasn't expensive or all in my face with their vibe.

wow! I was wrong!

I got the grilled cheese with bacon jam AND tomato jam, with potato salad. I think it was feta potato salad.

AND!

we got 'the mex', a pork sandwich with a salad! really good feta dressing. 

A nice zin, friendly service from the owners, and norah jones, I was surprised it was only 30$!

great value, great food, great location. reminded me of bisbee quite a bit, prob my fave vacation spot in phx. 

check it out! new, local, fresh, good menu. A winner."}
{"text":"I was in the area  looking for a place to grab lunch to go. I found Third Space on yelp and decided to take a chance. I'm glad I did the service was friendly, the menu is eclectic and the food is fresh. Not much parking,  but other than that all good . Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Cowboy caviar yummy!

Street tacos yum

Music fun

Comedy show- fun

This is a huge asset to grand. Keep it going guys"}
{"text":"Wow. This is a must! Great food,  good drink, out of this world atmosphere.  Bring a group it's fun."}
{"text":"I'm sorry thirdspace I'd love to give you higher scores because your food is not bad at all but just not worth the disrespect I received during my visit. I came here a couple weeks ago and that was a pleasant experience with attentive service, good sandwich and great nitro cold brew coffee from next door. So today I came back to have some food before checking out the grand avenue festival. I came in and seated myself and I can see it's definitely more crowded than last time. So I waited patiently to get a menu. 10 minutes later, after a number of eye contact with 4 different staffs I'm still sitting here with no menu or even any greetings acknowledging I'm here! Three different staffs came to take the order, bring out food, check if everything is ok with the table in front of me and to my right, yet no one cares to stop by to say anything to me! 15minutes later I walked to the bar asked for a menu and put in my order! All by myself! Still I gave them reasonable amount of tip to show them my respect in return to all the disrespect from them. Then I got my food, ate my food and finished it. Cannot complain about the quality of the food but once again no one has come to check on me even though they keeping walking past me 10plus times to check on tables next to mine! Until my departure no one has said anything!!! Thanks to thirdspace I received the 'warmest' service I've ever had anywhere in the whole world. Even a Viennese restaurant is not on the same level as you guys lol. I don't know you are racist or what, it has been such a disgusting experience and no thanks I won't bring myself to go through all this again!"}
{"text":"We had a great moment there for lunch time!  I order \" The Count\" served with homemade pickles and a choice of 1 side. I recommend the house Pesto potatoes salad was yummy!  The patio is pet frendly  (my dog love it) and super cute!  We will be back!"}
{"text":"I stopped here for lunch a few weeks ago on a Saturday.  I was waiting on my boyfriend and had been meaning to check this place out so I figured I'd stop in.  I was a little confused about where to park and which building it was at the location, but I figured it out.  I sat at the bar, got some good suggestions from the bartender and ordered my lunch. I don't remember the name of what I got, but the sandwich was amazing!  The prices are better for dine in ($10 I think), but I was definitely not disappointed.  The pesto, cheese, veggies and bread make my mouth water thinking about them.  I'll be coming back for sure.  One complaint I have is that it is difficult to find parking around there.  I noticed that there were a lot of run-down vehicles parked on the street so I'm guessing there's a vehicle hoarder/restorer nearby.  Hopefully the run-down vehicle issue will change so that it's easier to support this awesome little spot."}
{"text":"A very relaxed and friendly atmosphere with on point customer service. Currently for being just a beer and wine bar it has so many great opportunities to experience from there tattoo and barber shop to there nightly theme. Whether it be the nightly DJ to one of the numerous hilarious comedians that do stand up on Thursday nights."}
{"text":"Not the best coffee in town but it's OK. I like the fact that the bar is open at 7:30 in the morning... It's always beer o'clock!!!"}
{"text":"Such a cute and tasty spot with friendly service! Went for lunch and had the curry cauliflower soup to start, it was beyond DELICIOUS! Then had the turkey sandwich with homemade strawberry jam, wow! Ended my meal with a lemon bar, it was the perfect touch. Not too \"lemony\" but absolutely perfect. Everything was fresh and homemade. I was in need for a meal like this. So happy I was able to check third space out. I will definitely be dining here again when I'm in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"As an urban planner, i greatly appreciate the appropriately named bar, \"Third Space\".  Home is your first space. Work is second space. \"Third Space\" is  this place - a great, interesting, friendly neighborhood bar/restaurant that serves-up an amazing appetizer worth coming back for time after time -- a layered, dip served with toasted pita wedges.  Mind you this is no ordinary dip.  We chose the Farmer which is bacon jam, goat cheese, and tomato jam.  MY GOD, it is good!  I see my future -- happy hour beers and these layered dips!

To keep things interesting, a D.J. started to spin until the rain started on August's First Friday Art Walk but this gave us the opportunity to shop and look around the small studios and shops made out of relocated, converted German office quarters from Popago Park.   

Really this a friendly bar with easy conversation born at the bar with the  locals and staff.  No doubt I'll be back and striking-up a conversation when you arrive for the first time.  I'll recommend the layered dip, of course!  Unless I find something equally as good which I'm sure they have!"}
{"text":"This place offers a lot, but I'm just commenting on lunch.  Sandwiches are fresh, flavorful, and a definite break from the usual lunch fare.  The Count is a great twist on the Monte Cristo.  Turkey Pesto is the best.  Or for simple, you cant go wrong with grilled cheese.  Matched with home made soup they are the bomb.  Nice outdoor space."}
{"text":"My sister and I ordered the Chicken Chipotle street tacos (3) but they were so good I had a second order. My bf ordered the N.W Smoked Salmon Flatbread and the New England Clam Chowder. I had a taste of both and they were amazing! So glad we stopped at Thirdspace. We will be back!!"}
{"text":"This place is really cool. I came here on the First Friday, actually wrapped up the evening here. I met great people, the DJ was shining my songs and the Mex sandwich n curry cauliflower soup was delicious. I will be back."}
{"text":"Food is amazing! Patio is awesome too!  Listening to live bands out back as I write this.  I would highly recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"Love this place!! Had a great time last night eating and drinking with friends; we watched an open mic that had it's moments, lol but overall the service was amazing and the bartender was awesome even when dealing with a psycho that he had to call the cops on. We are definitely coming back and telling our friends about this place!! High fives Thirdspace!!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Food is great  - it is the kind of place that is part of the neighborhood and community."}
{"text":"This place is fun fun. I love that they have the little shops surrounding the patio. I think it's really cool that they repurposed & saved some of those POW barracks. Just wish they were all open late like the ice cream shop. The bar service is quick, beer is cold & the cocktails are so tasty. Love the live local music & art. Just a great place to hang & chat. Everyone is very chill no dbags allowed.  I haven't tried the food yet. But everything looks delish that I've seen online recently. So I'm betting that will push my review to 5 stars."}
{"text":"Sheesh!!! It's hot here in Phoenix but glad you have fresh iced tea and hummus plate!!"}
{"text":"I'm giving ThirdSpace five stars even though I have never yet consumed food here. Never yet does not = never will. In fact, I have been to ThirdSpace a number of times in the past (first for coffee, once for a photo shoot, another time for drinks) and fully intend to continue visiting.

ThirdSpace is truly unique in that it's a total community. A miniature community, but a community nonetheless. You've got your main hub (the bar) encircled by a bunch of cool little \"huts\", each one with its own featured attraction.

One of the huts is a coffee shop. One of the huts is a tattoo parlor. One of the huts is a hair salon of some sort. It's just super diverse and the spirit is super cooperative. It's everything you'd expect from a Grand Ave. establishment.

You've also got the added pleasure of regular events at the main bar. Plenty of interesting (live) music and DJs, plenty of seating indoors and out, and plenty of intriguing local art covering the interior walls.

Service has always been great. Even my first visit, which featured a very confused barista who couldn't even seem to locate the coffee beans was a positive one by simple virtue of the girl's positive attitude and general state of kindness despite the confusion!

(For the record, I've heard really good things about their coffee; I think I just managed to catch a poor newbie barista alone in the wild without appropriate supervision. I'll definitely be going back for a second attempt soon!)

ThirdSpace does a wonderful job of incorporating all the most positive and powerful elements of the Grand Avenue experience within its little community \"walls\". If you haven't been by for a visit, you should definitely go.

Choose a night where you're feeling unrushed, then go and relax for a while. You won't be disappointed. Very highly recommended."}
{"text":"Good customer service, great music, consistently amazing food and drinks are on point. This is the go-to spot for sure"}
{"text":"Definitively a great place for Sunday brunch or a relaxing evening on the laid back patio.  Have a great time listening to the D.J spin some jams.  Will gladly return"}
{"text":"The kind of place that feels comfy and great spot to have a beer and hang with friends, yet a great vibe so you feel \"out\"... No specific \"crowd\" type, just friendly people, yummy food, and definitely will be a regular hang out of ours.  . ."}
{"text":"Great specials every Sunday and Wednesday made by the chef! Sunday brunch is always fantastic- with cool creations like a breakfast sandwich on a waffle!"}
{"text":"This place was on point. I like the theory and practice of it. Good food, great atmosphere, good location, a place you might just want to hang out for a while, a true \"third space.\" 

I had \"the count\" sandwich, the pepper soup, the pork tostada, and the hummus app. I was not a fan of the hummus, but the sandwich and tostada were very good. The pepper soup was much like a tomato bisque and was also very good."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place Mardi Gras.   They have an amazing patio with a unique setup.  We had team and coffee from the coffee shop in back, and the atmosphere was great with the band they had playing.  The bar is unique and everyone was very nice."}
{"text":"We stumbled on this cutie little cafe while the Grand Avenue festival was going on. It was completely packed but luckily we found 2 stools at the bar. Outside there was a little market set up with local artists and musicians. It was a great little spot!"}
{"text":"They've been serving excellent food since the new ownership took over. Great atmosphere and great wine also. A hidden gem."}
{"text":"Came here for Taco Tuesday.  Small light tacos but fresh and delicious:  street tacos.  Great atmosphere, friendly service, delicious food!"}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE! Went for lunch one afternoon & it was not only delish but everyone there was awesome! great customer service"}
{"text":"We stopped in here on Sunday evening. It was a quiet time to be in here.
The two ladies working the bar were so nice and genuinely friendly. We tried the pork street tacos. They were so good!  We were told that they are opened for brunch as well on the weekends. Don't let the area of location fool you. It's a unique experience.....we will return!"}
{"text":"Had the roasted red pepper tomato bisque soup and lemon bar which were okay. But what makes this place great is that they have events going on most nights. There's a Comedy show Thursdays 7:30-9:00, Hip Hop nights Fridays 9-2, and live bands Saturday nights 9-2 (if you're lucky, ska)!"}
{"text":"Loved this place. Went yesterday! Had Tito's, the Athena appetizer and enjoyed sitting outdoors listening to Djs spinning old school vinyl house music to a crowd that danced the evening away. Even a mini performer found his groove. Casual, friendly, diverse, not pretentious, can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"I actually was disappointed. Ordered the Grand Melt with tomatoes and bacon jam with the pesto potato salad. Sandwich was ok. Little on the sweet side. Potato salad was excellent! Waitress was very attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"Just ate the most incredible appetizer of my life.  I walked in and was confused as to why I got recommended to come here but after taking in the vibe of the atmosphere I found its a pretty unique little spot! The bartender is super friendly!! Order the trifecta (the farmer).. The bacon jam is melt in your mouth amazing.. Go. Right. Now."}
{"text":"I took myself on a coffee date one evening after work. Why not? I'm great company and the people watching did not disappoint. The air was cool and the sky was clear ... just your typical Phoenix March day. It was beautiful outside and I felt so utterly content to bask in the fading evening light while drinking a nitro cold brew. Sometimes, just sitting and observing is nature's best medicine. If you're like me and actually enjoy your own company, this is great place to sit alone. If you need to constantly be surrounded, it's also a great place to catch up with a friend. Either way, very chill vibes. It's the kind of place you could hang out for a while and not feel weird about it."}
{"text":"I initially stopped here because I liked the name and the idea that this wasn't home or work, but an actual Third Space. Really cool concept! 

I stopped in on a weekday afternoon for lunch. It wasn't crowded but there were still people hanging out or lingering around. It was a nice day so I took a seat outside. Ted, one of the servers helped me out almost immediately. I went with, \"The Veg,\" sandwich with the pesto potato salad. The sandwich was awesome! Goat cheese, olive tapanade and spinach between two slices of grilled bread. So good. But the pesto potato salad. OMG. This was divine! (If you know me, I usually dislike potato salads or anything of the same consistency. It's just usually not my thing.) But the pesto potato salad at ThirdSpace, don't miss out! 

After eating, I walked around to check out the shops and cool little artist things they had. I've  highlighted this before in other posts, but I REALLY REALLY love the shared/collaborative space here. There's a salon, art gallery, coffee roaster, coffee shop, restaurant and bar all in one space. It even looks as if its set up to have live performance. PHOENIX NEEDS MORE OF THIS! So thank you, ThirdSpace. 

All in all, I love it! Everyone was super friendly, prices were great, and the food was incredible. ThirdSpace will probably soon be my actual third space!"}
{"text":"I've been here now a couple of times.  I've been here once with friends for some late night drinks and today I came here for lunch during the Grand Avenue Festival after seeing the positive reviews.  Last time I was here the place was pretty calm and relaxed and the service me and my group received was excellent.  Admittedly today was nuts with everyone on Grand for the festival, though I still left a bit wanting for my experience this go around.  Here's the lowdown and you can judge for yourself.

ThirdSpace is a funky indoor/outdoor bar and restaurant with a super cool outdoor patio perfect for live music.  Today, the Grand Avenue Festival brought with it live music on the patio and a packed house.  I've been here late at night for drinks and board games in the lounge seating area inside and had drinks with friends on the patio and I can definitely say it was a fun experience.  If you're only coming here for booze and tunes, ThirdSpace will more than satisfy.  They have a solid selection of cocktails, a decent beer and wine selection, and music lineup I've heard here fits perfectly with the venue. 

Today I came in looking to check out the food.  I sat at the bar alongside a bevy of other patrons determined to try a sandwich a fellow Yelper raved about.  The Grand Melt.  A grilled three cheese (cheddar, jack, and parm) sandwich with your choice of toppings (I went with tomato and pesto).  Comes with your choice of a side (I went with their soup of the day, which I believe was a roasted pepper soup).  I used my 10% entree discount with Yelp Check-In (yes, they do honor it).  Total including drink, tax and tip came to just over $10.  Unfortunately the food took more than 20 minutes to make it out to me, which I can forgive a little bit since today was unusually busy.  But I gotta say, once the grilled cheese finally arrived, the taste was kind of meh.  It wasn't bad.  Just really average.  The soup also didn't really do much for me by itself, though dipping my sandwich in the soup was a good way to mix it up.

It may just be that the owner(s) priority here is good booze and music.  And again, on that front ThirdSpace has you covered.  On the food side, I guess I'll need to try something else or catch them on a day that isn't nuts in order to get a good meal.  As with a lot of food and drink establishments on Grand Avenue, there's room for experimentation provided the product delivers the goods.  From my first two experiences here, ThirdSpace delivers on some, but not all of what they put forward."}
{"text":"Food was good, service was friendly but casual.  Didn't refill waters or bring check unless asked, likely because she was eating.  Hipster atmosphere in a not great part of town."}
{"text":"In ThirdSpace nobody can hear you scream. ThirdSpace is the place. ThirdSpace: the final frontier. 10/10 would come again, come support this amazing establishment. Don't ever BOTHER with First and SecondSpace 

(seriously a great place. The food and drink is incredible)"}
{"text":"What a great fun/funky place! Nice laid back vibe, wonderful patio! They just bought all new patio chairs and came out to ask how we liked them. Comfy and even rocked back a bit. Service was attentive and super friendly. We shared the turkey pesto sandwich and pesto potato salad. Yum & yum.. Really good sourdough bread. Only one suggestion; crispy dill pickle spear rather then bread/butter pickle. Served some good brews. Will be back for taco Tuesday!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite spots. Surrounded by amazing little shops and filled with wonderful food and a great staff."}
{"text":"This was my first time coming to ThirdSpace and I absolutely love this place. All the waiters were awesome and the waitress whom took care of me was awesome and really had some good insight as to what I should try. The cowboy caviar. Best thing I ever had."}
{"text":"Found this gem by accident, but the barista at this joint made the best iced chai lattes I have had in Phoenix.  Took his time and made a marvel of a drink.  
9.6.17
My sister and I had lunch here bc I was dying to try the curry chicken.  I really liked it and I liked it a on a bed of lettuce instead of on the bread.  I picked pesto potato salad and that was also good."}
{"text":"We stopped in yesterday for a drink and really enjoyed our experience!  Laid back vibe, great music and good drink selection.  We opted to sit inside yesterday and I enjoyed a cider and my husband enjoyed the Epicenter Amber.  They have a great outdoor space and love that Novel ice cream is right next door...such a great combo.  We watched the staff making coffee and I was really impressed even though I don't even drink coffee.  Check this place out!"}
{"text":"We were in the area looking at mattresses and was trying to figure out something close by, so of course we pull out Yelp for advice.  When we got there it wasn't busy, I think we may have just avoided the lunch crowd. But we were pleasantly surprised when we got there. Surrounding the restaurant were these cottage like looking stores, which I find out later that  they once housed POWs during WWII. It's pretty neat to see historical buildings re-purposed since we don't get to see that very often in Phoenix.Their sandwiches were AH- MAZING. I also noticed on their event calendar that they have comedy and karaoke night. I hope to make more visits in the future!"}
{"text":"So .. Today I went out for lunch after building sets for Comicon downtown.. The only place open that early on Grand ave was Third Space (2pm) .. Hadnt been in since they were doing Film Nights a few years back and decided to check it out and try out a new place to eat lunch while we're building sets for a couple of months.. Came in the heat of the day to two very nice servers behind a cool bar and ordered a grilled cheese and red pepper bisque that was great. Aftert my lunch, sat around for awhile and enjoyed the laid back atmosphere and tried to pay for my lunch with a $100 dollar bill (the holographic kind). They politely told me they couldnt break it and asked if I had anything smaller, I said no, and they again politely pointed me to the ATM for which I had no card.. I said keep the hundred and I'll come back after work and collect the change minus tip. Relaxed for 20 minutes before heading back to work .. Why would I leave my hundred and trust them? Because we're all part of the same tiny downtown Phoenix art scene and Third Space has been around for a hell of a long time, like me. I knew I could leave my money there especially since i'd supported their business in the past and the servers we're so cool about the situation. Left Third Space and went back to work until closing, then went back to my gallery, had a shower and headed over to Third Space for a drink and my change.. The guy, apparently the owner, (tats and beard) came over and asked me what I was drinking. Told him I left my money with them earlier because they couldn't make change. He went to the point of sale system hit some buttons and turned around and rudely said to me \"I have no idea why they would do that\" .. Embarrassed, I asked him if he was mad at me, when he blurted out WHATS WITH YOUR ATTITUDE?!!.. I was shocked?! I told him I just asked if you were mad at me? Told him I was just here to have a drink and grab my change and said there was ZERO reason to be angry with me as I was just here eating lunch earlier and they couldn't break the bill, AND I left without $90 dollars in change because the servers said that would be fine.. They even left a note in the register explaining why?!! Told him if theres a problem take it up with your servers, don't yell at your customers.. He turned around with the hundred, threw it on the bar and said DONT COME BACK, we don't want your business.. Pretty apparent after a tantrum like that I wouldn't.. Drove down the street, got change for the bill, returned, walked in, paid it and told him we both have all the same friends (they've even done events in his place) even though he doesn't know me yet I trusted his business with my change, I told him I couldn't understand why he lost his composure over a lunch bill! He told me to get out, called the cops?!?!?! All over eating a good lunch at his place AND trusting him with my $90 in change?!?! He then walks out and throws a crumpled up ten dollar bill at me and says \"There, I paid for your lunch\" He then told me not so politely to leave using expletives ?!?! I stood on the sidewalk and waited for the cops to arrive for about 20 minutes, and explained to them my side. They were very polite and laughed about my story. They told me the guy seemed like he had a chip on his shoulder, especially considering it was all over NOT having enough change in his drawer or pockets to change a hundred dollar bill.. Anyway.. They trespassed me from the property at his request.. Thats not how you treat a customer or old school gallery owners.. Thanks to the ladies for being so cordial and sorry you have to work with that guy.."}
{"text":"Love the patio. Nice hip little spot on Grand. The grilled cheese was excellent as was the soup and pesto patato salad. Would like to see a few more craft brews on tap, but had some SanTan Brews that totally sufficed."}
{"text":"I have passed by the shop while riding the bus into work and have wanted to check it out. Today I had the opportunity and was very pleased. Friendly baristas, artistic environment, and finally great coffee. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Such a cute spot to grab drinks and some food. ThirdSpace also had a calendar that shows things that they host throughout the week. I saw stand up comedy, brunch with cumbias, and a trivia night. Also a good place to grab some lunch and look at cool artwork. Staff is a lot of fun and friendly."}
{"text":"Really awesome little restaurant. I had a turkey sandwich with some of their bacon marjoram jam and it was amazing. Good food, fair prices, and a nice outside patio to enjoy."}
{"text":"Neat little place, with delicious, scratch-made food.  Bartender/server was super friendly and attentive.  Nice bar atmosphere - I think this would be an awesome live music venue.  Not necessarily where I'd take a client for a business lunch, but just fine to go with a co-worker or a friend. 

I had the Count and my friend had the turkey pesto sandwich.  Both were excellent sandwiches.  I had the pesto potato salad which was terrific as well.  My friend had a ham and lentil soup that had more ham in it that most ham sandwiches.  

All-in-all I think ThirdSpace is a nice place for a very casual bite to eat of a drink.  When it's cooler, looks like a good place to sit and relax on the patio also."}
{"text":"Wow.  Just wow.  So we land at Phoenix airport and rent a car to drive up to the Grand Canyon.  We need to stop for lunch somewhere and this place shows up on Yelp as a nearby spot with many stars.  Not being familiar with the area, we end up at this hole in the wall single building in an industrial area.  We walk in and see that it's a bar with some tables and we're completely out of place.  There are no other customers there and when we ask if it's open for lunch someone grunts yes.

BUT--the waitress appears and flashes a big smile and a hearty welcome.  We sit down and proceed to have one of the most delicious, freshest lunches of our trip.  The food is organic and high quality and well prepared.  I mean, we were really impressed.  I wish I could eat this for lunch every day.

After a very satisfying meal and not too many dollars later, we hit the road for the GC, sated and plotting a stopover on our way back to the airport."}
{"text":"The Count was an excellent sandwich. The couscous side was interesting. I would eat here again."}
{"text":"Tiny place. Modern and cool feel. The food was good, but the service was subpar. 

I asked for water no ice, and I got water with ice. 
I ordered a turkey sandwich and got a chicken curry sandwich. 
We had some dips with pita bread and although they were good they were $10 for each for what it felt like 1 pita bread and about 2 oz of dip... teeny tiny hummus, etc. The menu refers to them as trio, trifecta or something like that, so I thought the price was for a sampler and ended up being $10ish each.
They do not have real dishes, apparently only disposables.
I ordered a coffee and our server had no clue how many ounces a cappuccino was going to be. She guessed a number and offered a real cup, came back with a super small disposable cup, not even full to make room for the cappuccino's foam.
It would have been OK for free but we even had to pay : P Well, my dear friend paid.

*They did eventually get me the turkey sandwich and charged us for it, but it took so long that my companions were already done and I took it to go."}
{"text":"Great hang out place full of art and good music. The food is really really good. The staff and owner are super friendly. Stopped in for a drink but stayed for dinner. Then checked out the tattoo parlor and got a great cup of coffee from a cute little coffee shop in back. To make a great experience even better my son got the best hair cuts he's ever gotten from the salon out back. You haven't experienced Phoenix until you've stopped by here for there \"Spoken Word Night\"."}
{"text":"You GUYS. This place/these places...so good. I'm sippin on a cold brew, having just wolfed down my delicious lunch combo of turkey pesto and pepper soup, wishing only that I'd ordered the full sammy. I asked for it grilled, which was among my better choices this week, and you betcha I dunked that bad boy in and around the perfectly seasoned pepper soup. SO YUM. The lunch combo was around $7, which I have no objection to, especially because everything was so fresh and tasty. 

I'd like to go back for happy hour or live music soon."}
{"text":"It's not home. It's not work. It's your third space; the place you go for social satisfaction and to meet new and old Friends. This friendly bar would put Cheers to shame. 

This is my favorite bar in Phoenix. The staff is amazing and the prices are reasonable. They host a variety of events including live music and have the best patio in Phoenix. There's numerous other shops on the property too. Be sure to check this place out."}
{"text":"Best grilled cheese sandwich I've ever had. Top it off with the coldest PBR's in the Valley and you have a winner here folks."}
{"text":"TOTAL FAN!!!  It is a hidden gem.  Love the vibe, food, and staff!  Got angry orchard, the basic, and the lemon chicken soup.  Just recently discovered my love for hard ciders.... YUM!  The basic is the mother of all grilled cheese sandwiches (melted cheese top - what, what?).  The soup of the day was lemon chicken with rice, so GOOD not too sour.  Loved it, inhaled in!  Also got the side of the pesto potato salad (come there just to try it), it was a little disappointing since the hyped was all there.  it needed more pesto in the flavor but it was good."}
{"text":"My wife and I landed in Phoenix at 10 pm on a Tuesday night with no plan for the evening and this was the only place we could find with an open kitchen.  Much to our surprise it turned out to be absolutely perfect for us.  We got to sit outside on a beautiful evening and eat some amazing food...the chicken tacos were literally the best tacos I've ever had, the salad was very fresh, and the tots were killer.  Definitely a great place to support!"}
{"text":"What a lovely little place! It wasn't super busy (of course I was there at 1), and the staff was so nice and knowledgeable. They are friendly, fast and just welcoming. And now for what you've been waiting for: ambiance.
I was bummed I couldn't enjoy their patio. (Its slight scorching in the summer)...It is quaint, set for casual. Think laid back date, jeans, but bc of artsy vibe, fine to bring a date. There are 3 little houses there apparently from WWII, super colorful, and it creates interesting focal points. 
Great place to grab a drink or coffee. Too bad I live over an hour from here. So no mojito for me!"}
{"text":"Nice little venue downtown. Great happy hour and delicious food. Awesome entertainment. Just an FYI to anyone planning on coming here, the crowd is a little older (definitely not saying that's a bad thing!). I will be back!"}
{"text":"I went in for lunch. The place is very laid-back. I liked that it was pretty quiet and the music was nice. I love the local artwork. The food was delicious and the pour over coffee was delicious. I bought a couple of Mexican wedding cookies that were incredible.
Their service was good and the young lady was attentive and nice."}
{"text":"Good staff. Good food. Decent prices. So those are the \"pros\". 

The \"con\" that would cause us to look elsewhere for lunch was the music: so loud in the restaurant we had to shout. Wound up sitting outside in a light rain. 

Maybe it's not always like that but if you want the downtown business lunch crowd, turn the flippin' music down. It's not rocket science."}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and check this place out! I checked it out for the first time today - for lunch - and WILL be back. Great service - nice, friendly, fast. I had one of, if not, the best turkey sandwiches ever (turkey pesto). Bread is from a bakery around the corner, lots of pesto, lots of cheese etc. Super cute and quaint, and has character (surrounded by other places with character - galleries, coffee, food). Lots of events/live music that I will be back for! And of course again for my lunches :) Oh! and I noticed they are pet friendly!"}
{"text":"Went for the Thursday night comedy and had a very good time. The comedians were funny, the crowd was nice and responsive as they preformed. Wish the comedians had had a little more time because some felt very short and I was hoping to be laughing it up a bit longer. Bur I will return for Thursday's though, I had a good time and the drinks were cheap and the bartender making them was very nice to accommodate our request for not the norm mixed drinks."}
{"text":"This place is artistic, quaint, and one of a kind. The food was unique and really delicious. I ate a turkey sandwich with pesto potato salad; it was really good!  I'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"It's truly a hole in the wall place with huge outdoor space and coffee place along side. Music is not loud, not crowded. My kind of place."}
{"text":"Super nice waitress on a Wednesday at lunch. My grilled cheese sandwich was better than average and the homemade mushroom soup was delicious. I will return!"}
{"text":"Blink and you might miss ThirdSpace. A cool (beer-wine only) bar on the corner of Grand Ave and 11th Avenue, I've driven past it every day but hadn't stopped in until this past weekend.

A warm welcome awaits from the friendly bartender through a window that serves the outside patio. The weather was co-operating so we sat outside in the early evening and enjoyed the surroundings. The outside area, surrounded by quaint little shops and trees give it a New Orleans courtyard kind of feel. Citronella candles had been placed to deter the blood-sucking insects, and that was most appreciated. 

The beer selection was impressive, recited filibuster-style by the bartender. They even had $2 PBRs and High Life to cater to the Hipsters. Didn't have an opportunity to try the food, but it gets good reviews here, so I'll come back for that soon.

As we were leaving a band was setting up for the evening, kinda looked like Wilson Phillips, but I didn't \"Hold On\" to hear them...."}
{"text":"It's rare that I'm so impressed about a lunch spot, but Third Space gets it all right! Food is delicious and all made from scratch. Service is very friendly and makes you feel like a regular from your first visit. The ambiance makes you feel like you stepped into the local cafe in a town of 5,000 people. Love it!!"}
{"text":"I went to Third Space with my mom a few days ago during the work week. I can honestly say that I can imagine eating lunch there EVERY SINGLE DAY. Here's how good it was: I hate mayo and sour cream and basically all ingredients that are creamy but the waitress suggested that I try the potato salad which, interestingly enough, had nearly every one of those  ingredients.  It was without a doubt, the best potato salad on the face of the earth. And the turkey sandwich with bacon jam? What?! SO good. To top it off, Neil, the owner was there and talk about an all-around good person! My mom and I were so impressed. Can't wait to try Third Space again....and again....and again."}
{"text":"Very cool spot. There are so many different options depending on what you'd like. They're great for lunch, drinks, in or outside. Behind the main building are multiple other small buildings. There's a shop for icecream, tattoos, coffee, hair salon...I lucked out today because the weather was perfect and I was craving icecream from Novel. I was able to sit outside and people watch which is always awesome. I love seeing people enjoying themselves. I did venture inside the main space and it was kinda odd to me. It's more of a local place so if you're waiting for someone to seat you they won't. The attention of employees is mainly at the bar, but I get it. Great place to spend some time on the weekend."}
{"text":"Was in down town and found this Gem on Yelp! Very cool little place and the food was delicious."}
{"text":"Really nice place, we had lunch there.
Great staff, \"take it easy\" style, I loved it!
The food was tasty, house made pesto potato salad, we took the Mex hot sandwich, nice as well.
Great atmosphere and music."}
{"text":"I'm never eating here again! Food is by no means abominable, sometimes it's even \quite\ good [soups especially], but the service is just not there. I am tired of being made to feel like I'm inconveniencing people whose job it is to provide a service. 

This might be my most frustrated yelp review ever.

I like the people but constantly feel like customer service is the last priority here. Today was the last straw. Last time I was there [before today], I ordered a BBQ sandwich and the bottom bun was so soaked through and drippy that there was no eating it as a sandwich. I raised this complaint to the barkeep, who registered that I'd spoken words, but did nothing further to acknowledge the situation. Literally imagine \"Um, this isn't quite right, the bottom is completely soaked through\" met with a half interested \"Oh?\" and then nothing. Moved on. ...Ok. 

So today I finally got over my frustration f to check out their \"WTF Wednesday\" special, a muffuletta. I asked whether it was grilled, told it wasn't, I asked that it be grilled [my preference being for some crusty bread to go with all that mush in the middle]. 

Barkeep heard and confirmed my ask. Sandwich is ready, and given my past experiences here, I check the food before leaving [I'm so not that person usually]... and the bread is plain and dry, not grilled, not toasted [despite the cook claiming it was]. 

I ask \"Was it not possible to grill the bread?\" to the barkeep. 

So here's what kills me and why I wont be back [for food]: Rather than being asked how the problem can be fixed, I get an explanation from the cook about how what I wanted was wrong. 

...

I'm paying money for food. That means it has to be better than something I can make myself. And, it has to be to my liking. That's just a fact of the market; if you're in a service industry, the food has to be UNGODLY good to be the 'no modifications/substitutions' type of place. This is not that place. So being told how things 'should be' in the face of twice expressing an unmet preference is just shitty shitty shitty service. Especially when I'm asking for something as simple as grilling a sandwich. It's not busy, I'm the only one in the place... yet I'm being told why I shouldn't want what I want, rather than being asked how things can be fixed. 

Terrible service instincts abide at this place and it will prevent me from recommending it to people, especially when there are so many superior options in the surrounding area. 

As I mentioned, I do genuinely like the people at this spot; they're overall nice and I support their success. But I feel like every time I raise a concern I am met with indifference, so why bother raising concerns if they fall on deaf ears?  Sincerely hope a focus on service can turn things around here; it's a great space with some positive attributes and I hope it thrives. I just wont support it like I normally would prefer because I don't send my friends to places with bad service."}
{"text":"stopped in for lunch and enjoyed the phx bowl, sooo yummy lots of different flavors for a great price, the atmosphere is very nice and the staff is always extremely friendly! this place has definitely come a long way and looks like it's only going up from here!"}
{"text":"What a cute place!  Had an amazing lunch on their outdoor patio.  It was so hard to decide what to get.  Ended up getting The Mex with a side salad.  Delicious!!"}
{"text":"Wonderfully funky, good food, all the right drinks and laid back comfortable atmosphere."}
{"text":"Checked out Thirdspace on First Friday's after viewing the galleries on Grand. The artsy place was packed and hopping. We expected slow service and average food. What we got was good service and outstanding food all served up in a quaint little bar with music, dj, art, interesting design, creative vibes all around. Perfect late night date night for us. Really made my wife happy. And street tacos 3 for $5 made my wallet happy. We'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"Was driving down the street and this place caught my eye. I'm a sucker for places with patio seating! Walked right inside to find a very intimate bar with casual sofa seating. Ordered my drink at the bar top and proceeded to take in the environment. Definitely a chill place with lots to offer for the type just looking to relax. The walls showcase paintings done by local artists. One corner has board games to play too! Oh and if being a bar alone wasnt enough it's also a coffee joint! Came in too late but apparently Tuesdays are taco Tuesday so I'll have to catch that next time. I can't wait to be back in Phoenix for a chance to visit this place again! Oh and the bartenders are very cute too:)"}
{"text":"I came into Third Space with my boyfriend during our lunch break. The two young women working there greeted us and then gave us no instruction about what the seating situation was, nor even asked us if we intended on dining. We asked if we were to seat ourselves and then sat at a table across from the bar when they said \"yes\".

The server with the short hair came to our table and served us promptly with waters. We placed our order quickly and she even refilled my boyfriend's water promptly. That is where the good notes end.

It took us at least twenty minutes to get one and a half sandwiches and side salad. My boyfriend requested that his sandwich be toasted, it was not. My sandwich was the vegetarian option with no cheese. The woman with the longer hair was kind enough to ask if I wanted hummus instead. I found out later that's because they put so little tapenade on that at first I thought they had forgotten it. We were over charged for my boyfriend's sandwich, and later I found a short hair in my salad (I have hair past my shoulders so it was not mine.) The salad dressing was also unbelievably salty almost to the point of not being edible.

When I asked the server with the short hair if it was normal to take this long for such a small order she interrupted me and blamed the small kitchen. When I brought up that we were the only people in the restaurant she responded, \"We had an order before you...if you needed it done quickly you should have called ahead.\" I was a bit shocked. The two women were not doing anything when we got there and didn't get started on anything until after we ordered, so they obviously weren't in a hurry to fulfill the other person's order either.

If it is true that the size of this establishment's kitchen makes it impossible to make less than two sandwiches and a side salad in a timely manner then the owners should seriously rethink whether they are capable of being a restaurant. If not then they should look toward hiring new employees."}
{"text":"Grilled Cheese with Bacon Jam. Don't forget to say CHEESE IT! A layer of cheese burnt to the outside of the bread. Yum! Just go check this place out!"}
{"text":"Dude, ThirdSpace is where it is at. Went here with a party of 20 and they were hosts par excellence  

First, the atmosphere. They sat us on the patio and it was vibes vibes vibes. Surrounded by some nice trees, cool little string lights hanging up, surrounded by all these little shops. There was a coffee shop, a thrift/oddities shop, a tattoo place, etc. Next, (and some people may not be down with this) there were 3 little cats! the gentlest, calmest creatures. The dopest of homies. the fluffiest of fluff. Those guys were the real hosts of the evening. 

Second, da fooooood. On that point, I got 8 words for you : The Curry Hen and the Pesto Potato Salad

Get it get it get it get it

You may be like \"oh curry, i don't mess with the curry\" 

Two things - 1) you're an idiot. 2) nike. just do it. 

Its the mildest curry flavor swimming in a creamy stream of goody goodness. So subtle, almost sweet, perfect for a chicken salad. 

Next you got the pesto potato salad. and thats just bomb. the embodiment of bomb.


Lastly, this place is just really cool GO"}
{"text":"Stopped in, not really much about the place. It's definitely more of a hang out and bar, than a place to get food. I give it four stars for the environment and service. Food was 2 star but, it's still a cool place to have a drink or a cup of coffee."}
{"text":"Remember that feeling you'd get when you could step into a Central Phoenix bar your friends hadn't heard of yet? Remember how cool it felt to have a pint in a hip place that's NOT surrounded by luxury condos? If so, you're like me and already feeling nostalgic for late 2000s, when the middle of town was quirky, kitsch, and best of all--accessible. 

That magic isn't dead yet. You can recreate it at ThirdSpace. 

Begin at the stylish bar, with its groovy menu and its local, affordable draught selection. Wander into several incorporated businesses of your choice. Want to grab yourself a nice curio? You don't even know what that is, but I promise it's cool. There's also a tattoo parlor, barber, and...coffee? Yes, coffee. Why leave? 

It's like Desoto Market for people who don't want to ruin Phoenix 

It's like piece of Roosevelt Row that didn't sell out. 

It's everything you want...you just have to brave the wrong side of the tracks. Totally worth."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch and while there wasn't a big crowd it sure deserves one.  The food was fantastic and the service was as good as any service I've experienced. I definitely recommend the \"trifecta\". They make all of their own sauces and jelly.  They even pickle their own pickles and other items.  This place is definitely a winner!"}
{"text":"Love this place! I've only gone once because it's kinda far from me but the food is great and I love the outdoor area! Anything with pesto is a safe bet and definitely check out the little shops. Great place to hang out with some cocktails for a bit!"}
{"text":"While the atmosphere was fun I specifically asked what I could eat being gluten free and what didn't have wheat. I was told to have one of their salads. I ordered a salad and  while I was eating It realized that the dressing tasted like it had soy sauce in it. When I asked the person I had previously questioned what I could eat without wheat she said yes it had soy sauce. Thanks for exposing me to my allergy. I won't be visiting your establishment again."}
{"text":"Food was great! They have some different and tasty sandwiches! 
Me and my gf went for dinner and found a cool enviroment, with a lot of stylish folks and a fun hip hop beat as background. The inside is nice, but the outside tables are the best! A patium shared with a coffee shop, a tattoo studio... A great experience!"}
{"text":"We like their weekend afternoon brunch until 4, when they have live music. The vegan breakfast burrito was very tasty, but the chilaquiles use sriracha instead of an actual salsa. The service is usually pretty good and the atmosphere is very chill."}
{"text":"Great service! It a wonderful neighborhood. And on the patio, they have a delicious ice cream shop, tattoo parlor, hair salon. Just an overall cute little outside area. They have a bunch of board games and a couple of arcade games. There is also a foosball table outside. The bartender Torre was great. He was delightful! Most days they have live music. Definitely worth stopping by! Highly recommend"}
{"text":"After several visits, I am quite impressed by ThirdSpace.  Had \"the count\" sandwich today for lunch, and it was like desert - white wine, strawberries, turkey, perfectly pressed - these guys know what they are doing with sandwiches!  The couscous was great too, with nuts and dried fruit - but the house-made pickles totally blew it out of the park.

They are also serving specialty coffee roasted just feet away at Morning Bell Coffee Roasters, which is located just in back of the restaurant.  Good stuff!"}
{"text":"We decided to stop in and grab lunch and check out the vibe. 
We certainly appreciate the atmosphere and laid back feel of this great spot. 
Sophia welcomed us and poured us a delicious blood orange cider before our lunch arrived. Our blue cheese bacon wrapped jalapeños was perfect. 
We chatted with Ray their Monday night DJ and enjoyed meeting the locals who return here. If you want to know a place that is under the radar of being hip without the hype ...this place is the scene."}
{"text":"Thirdspace is a cute little place to grab some food or a beer. I came here most recently for brunch, which was surprisingly tasty. I got a breakfast tostada that consisted of green chili pork, black beans, and eggs.... it was super tasty. Additionally, you can get beer or coffee to go with brunch. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This is my 2nd time coming here. The first time was with a large party for work and the food was pretty good so I thought I'd try it again. It was a bit slow with service but we ordered our food - I got the lunch special with a 1/2 grand melt with tomato jam and asked them to 'cheese it' with the pesto potato salad and small garden salad with the creamy cilantro dressing. My son ordered the Count with chicken tortilla soup. He ordered an Arnold Palmer as well. 

We got the food but no drink delivered by someone else so we asked her for the drink, I received soup instead of the potato salad and she exchanged it out. I also noticed the sandwich did not have the cheese on the outside like I asked for, flipped it over and the under side was over done. I just decided to go with it since we already had issues with the drink and potato salad. As far as the food, it's pretty good (outside of the overdone bread, etc). The jam is quite sweet but good. The salad dressing on the salad was really good, and the pesto potato salad was pretty good. My son said all of his food was pretty good. I think the person that took our order may have been the issue but then again the bread was over done so who knows. Overall, a bit disappointed and its a little slow there, but the food is still decent and creative."}
{"text":"Really good vanilla latte
Really great sand which with a well mixed salad"}
{"text":"This place is always great. Make your own bloody Mary bar is awesome. I love the outdoors patio. The only complaint would be the occasional fly but that's because of the open window and door."}
{"text":"Thirdspace is unique.  There is a regular bar (beer and wine only) with a patio, and then you go out back, and there are these amazing, tiny cottages that now hold businesses.  A coffee shop, a tattoo parlor, a hair salon, you get the idea.   There is a large patio style area where live music is played, you can walk around with the drinks that you get at the bar, and server staff are everywhere.  SO FUN!!  I went there for an art show by my friend Jules Demetrius, but I think I'll go back for a drink and an appetizer since I hear the food is great too.  The only bummer is that while you are enjoying your drink on the patio and listening to the music, the cigarette smoke will KILL you.  The buildings create a valley or bowl-like effect, and the smoke can't escape.  Fans or something would alleviate that and it would be at least 4 stars if not 5."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, fun atmosphere, and good food. I had \"The Count,\" a hot turkey sandwich with strawberry jam and powdered sugar. I look forward to eating it again!"}
{"text":"Cool place, weirdly eclectic. Not a lot of parking but whatever. It has the little weird shops around it and great patio space."}
{"text":"THE FOOD IS SO GOOD! I got the turkey pesto and my husband got the green chili tostada. He LOVES super spicy food, and to quote him: \"they really know what they're doing.\" Definitely coming back the next time we're downtown?!"}
{"text":"The service has gotten alot better. Thumbs up. 
The drinks are delicious. And somehow he always remembers my drink. I dig it. 
The food is also very good. Not greasy or heavy. I'm a fan of the street tacos."}
{"text":"Relaxed homey yet refined atmosphere. Bar and restaurant areas mix well together and openness of location made eating here very enjoyable. Lunch prices were very fair; we got the Grilled Cheese / Soup and regular Poke bowl. Grilled cheese literally had queso a half inch thick and tomato soup it was pared with was great. Poke bowl was very fresh as well. We had served over quinoa as they were out of rice (bummer, but the quinoa was cooked well). Definitely coming back for lunch again!"}
{"text":"Great lunch spot.  Food is excellent. Their hummus is homemade and perfect. Unlike most downtown restaurants they don't have a huge lunch line. Easy parking. Quick service."}
