{"text":"This place is totally awesome. A fantastic local bar. My bartender Baili was fantastic. I witnessed a confrontation with another guest that was totally disrespectful and Baili handled it with total class and professionalism. Some patrons just need to realize when they have had too much to drink and take criticism respectfully and learn to call it a night. I come here frequently and love the food drink and atmosphere."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed in the whole experience. I am local and wish it was better because it would be nice to have a good place to eat and hang out. The meals we had were pricey for the quality we received. One of us had a burger and for the price a McDonalds dollar cheese burger was much better, there was hardly any meat. My wife had the Reuben and for an Irish place, not good.  For the price the burger and the Reuben should of been bigger and juicy. The price is fine if the quality was good but it's not. This place could be fixed easily. We also ordered chicken poppers for appetizers and there was no chicken at all. Don't order those unless you want fried pieces of breading. Service is also slow.  If your going to drink beer your safe."}
{"text":"Terrible food. Terrible quality. Felt sorry for the shorthanded waitstaff cuz the kitchen obviously doesn't know what they are doing. Go to buffalo wild wings if you want this type of food and atmosphere. Terrible!"}
{"text":"I haven't had any food here, but with $2 draws on football game days and friendly service, I give them high marks so far."}
{"text":"Not a bad place. We went there tonight to try it out. Wasn't busy for a Friday night. Took advantage of the happy hour drinks after 9. Little one had a pretzel bun burger and my wife and I shared an appetizer of their steak nachos. Pretty well fed for the money spent. Also they offer a 20% military discount at this location!"}
{"text":"Best wings in town! Great Draft beer selection and friendly staff. Princess is the best bartender in town, pours monster shots!!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went to this restaurant for a quick meal and we would be hard pressed to find a reason to go back.  The best part of the meal was the water and the beer.  We ordered appetizers as well as entrees and both were lacking.  I ordered the appetizer sampler and the chicken strips were burned!  my wife ordered buffalo wings (a specialty) and I ordered a burger and fries.  Both my wife's meal and my fries were burned and my burger was supposed to be medium rare and it came out much closer to well done.  When the waitress came back over and we mentioned the issues, she offered to get us something else but since our party was done with their meal, we declined.  Before going, we had heard bad reviews but decided to try it our for ourselves. Needless to say, we should have listened to our friends.  We have made sure to pass along our bad experience so that none of our friends make the same mistake that we did."}
{"text":"Don't order \"the big catch\" entry...super salty and overcooked. Not impressed with this place at all."}
{"text":"If you like reheated food fast, this is your place. If you want quality, look elsewhere."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time w this place! Lousy slow service both times I went , bland generic food that tastes like it was frozen and just thawed then not cooked long enough, they even screw up simple things, the worst part is the staff, the owner Andrew is creepy and clingy, the bar tender Shannon is so slow I ordered a beer at the bar and instead of then getting it she walks over to another table where her boss is already harassing people who just want to eat their meal in peace and try and talk about bs for. 5 min while I'm just standing there, or you get her attention for a beer then have to wait until it's convenient for her to get it, she needs to learn a bit about customer service WONT BE BACK AGAIN"}
{"text":"My family and I hoping to enjoy a local establishment stopped for lunch today. We had a less than satisfying experience. The waitress forgot to place our order and on two separate occasions lied about why our food came to the table nearly 35 minutes after we placed our order. The manager when addressed at the end of our visit asked why we hadn't mentioned it to him when he flew past our table. He did acknowledged that the waitress had forgotten to put in our order and had expedited the order although he had not take it upon himself to let us know that he was trying to rectify the situation at any time.    Despite the service the food quality was average at best.  Sadly this local establishment will not receive our future business  Actual date 5/28/2012"}
{"text":"Awesome place! The food was great and the service was even better! Highly recommend! Go Tribe!"}
{"text":"Food is garbage and over priced !! Staff was nice !! 35 dollar check for 2 people for lunch !!! Don't waste your money !! Go somewhere else !!!"}
{"text":"After walking through the cloud of cigarette smoke at the back entrance we found the hostess stand and were greeted with \"we are out of bone in wings\". Um ok, table for 2 adults and 1 kid. We got the last table right next to the bar. The bar tender waited on us then we really never saw her again. Food took forever, was brought by the hostess and was cold. That is the worst - waiting for cold food. cause you know it got cold cause no one bothered to bring it to you. I sent my cold nachos (the cheez whiz kind) back and they microwaved them. Let me repeat that. They.microwaved.nachos. Lettuce and all. It was disgusting. I woulda drank some water to get rid of the one bite of soggy lettuce taste but we never got any refills. I asked the manager to take them away and to just forget it and bring the check. He made me some new ones  anyway - but we had to go, we'd been there forever already and did not want to listen to the insanely loud dude with the guitar who set up shop in the bar with a screeching amp. Never again."}
{"text":"Fricken awesome.  I love their spring rolls and their chicken phone is the best.  The people are warm and friendly and the food is made fresh"}
{"text":"Waited 15 minutes for service on a sunday around 1p. Not crowded at all. Finally just got up and left."}
{"text":"We usually din in at Beef O' Brady's, but one day we decided to order take out. They said that my order would be ready in 20 mins so, I was there on time. The hostess took my card and said that my order will be ready in a few mins... 15 mins later, they said they were looking for a plastic bag to put my order in... 10  mins later... still waiting and my order finally came out. When I got home, my wings and cheese sticks were cold and so was everything else. That was the last time we ordered out from Beef's."}
{"text":"Excellent, friendly servers (especially at the bar) and a wide selection of beers on tap. Decided to try the pizza and was surprised at the quality! The dough was nice and fresh and there were plenty of toppings. Very tasty!!!"}
{"text":"Disappointing. Inconsistent. Took our 10-lb furbaby to lunch today on outside patio. Owner quickly arrives to explain DHEC rules. With a pet, your food must be served in to-go box. First time ever, but whatever!  Not 20-min later, another couple with their furbaby, two tables away, is served with regular plates & baskets instead of to-go box. What the what?!?!  A DHEC rule is a DHEC rule & should be applied to all. Sought out owner to complain before we paid & left. Bye bye, Beef's, won't be back!"}
{"text":"Average at best.   Have eaten here 3 times over past year and a half and have yet to be satisfied.  We arrived around 5pm and were greeted with a friendly hello from the bartender and the hostess.  However, our waitress seemed to care less that we were there.  I ordered the prime rib sandwich and substituted the wedding soup for the fries.  Soup was good, but the size was small and not worth the additional $1.99.  The sandwich was tasty, but small.  My wife ordered the Reuben, which was a good size but had very little flavor."}
{"text":"5 of 5 for the beer selection alone.   Every palate can find a decent craft brew to enjoy.  3.5 of 5 for food quality and selection.. ..it is \"above average\" bar food, and a good spot for lunch...  (5 star bar-food in my book is AZWBC..)    4/5, overall.  I am here once or twice a week.    Service has been GREAT every time.  My reference: Hooters scores a 2/5 for food. 1/5 for beer \"selection\".. I do not waste my money there.     (5/5 for ... ehh..  scenery...)"}
{"text":"Decent spot for a cold beer and an appetizer.  Plenty of flat screen televisions for the sport fans."}
{"text":"Sad to say this place can do a lot better. Service here was horrible. Came with friends and it took for ever to get our food ordered. When the food came out the girl forgot to put in my order. Acted like it was no big deal, told me maybe I could share with my friends... Smh. I love beef o Brady.. But not the stow location!"}
{"text":"Have to rate a one at best.  Only one bartender/ waitress in the restaurant.  After 15 minute wait, asked the owner (Byron) why and he get got mad and said \"your going do me like that\" and walked away.  No apology, didn't want our business.  Then went to teakwoods and received great service."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to this new Beef O'Brady's location last Friday night and thought it was just wonderful. We got there a little after 6:00pm. and did not have a long wait. We saw lots of people we knew, as expected. I ordered the Montana chicken dinner, which was 2 boneless breasts with barbecue sauce, cheddar and jack cheeses, bacon, and onion straws, though I omitted the bacon. The chicken was the juiciest I have ever tasted and what I liked most is that is was not drowning in the toppings. The cheese, sauce and straws were what I would describe as light but perfect. My husband had the turkey reuben, which had on it coleslaw instead of kraut. I am a coleslaw lover and theirs is quite tasty so having it on the sandwich was delicious. The food was hot, fresh, and delicious. I know will be going to Beef's often. My meal also came with my choice of 2 sides."}
{"text":"Have to say, pulled this off yelp as our hotel is walking distance and wow, Shannon was amazing. She was so a accommodating with our orders. Plus she was adorable and so friendly. Great time, thanks for your amazing service!"}
{"text":"Horrible. A \"quick\" bite has taken a total of 1.5 hours and the food was horrible. There is zero direction in this place."}
{"text":"Great food good service and Ording come up in a timely manner so the manager came out personally and comped our appetizer not seen nowadays franchise"}
{"text":"This place has never been good.  I went about a half dozen times when it first opened because they had 99 cent taps and 50 cent wings during happy hour.  The taps were bud/miller and the wings were blah, but for the price it was a good deal.  The service was always slow and anytime I got food outside of that it was bland and overpriced.  I tried this place last night after about a year or so absence.  The place was dead.  The server came up and asked what we wanted to drink.  He then informed us they \"have soda and beers.\"  Wow, thanks!  I asked if they had a beer list and was told no, just look at the taps.  Ok, not the end of the world I guess.  When we were ordering we were told of the buffalo wing special which was some wings and fries for whatever price.  My friend ordered that and was then told they were out of boned wings and had only boneless.  I ordered the half ribs / half chicken combo.  About five minutes later the server yelled from behind the bar \"what kind of sauce you want for your ribs?\"  Then after about another five minutes he came back and said, oh we are out of ribs.  So, out of wings and out of ribs.. got it.  The food wasn't awful, but again, bland.  We asked him to split the bill down the middle, just cutting the cost in half.  This was too much for him to handle I guess.  He said this was the best he could do, my bill had my food, the appetizer, and one of my friends beers.  My friends bill had his food, my beers and his beers.  My total was $28 and his was $20.  I guess that's kinda half.. sorta... maybe.  Needless to say this place wont be missed when it goes out of business."}
{"text":"Good,fresh BBQ hamburger,good service from new waitresses. Choc cake was yummy. Not crowed on a Saturday afternoon. Didn't try their appetizers. Nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Definitely a one time only for us, unless we go only to drink.  (Lagunitas IPA on tap...yay!). The nachos were nothing special and certainly the cheese was poured from a can.  The chicken on the nachos may well have been cooked days earlier.  Same with the chicken on the dinner salad.  The dinner salad greens were also poured from a bag, I'm sure. The sliders were made from microwaved diskettes of beef, very clearly not grilled to order.  Also there are three different sliders so be sure to specify exactly what you want.  I thought we did, but we got something other than what we ordered.  The food in the pictures on the menu looks beautiful.  The food on the plate didn't deliver."}
{"text":"Bar service is great. Wings are delicious and the tacos are great. Owner is nice and so is the manager. Check them out!"}
{"text":"Fries are always stale. The ribs were unappetizing. I've eaten here before and the atmosphere is always great for families and sports. But the food has always been subpar."}
{"text":"Used to be very good but it became a company store and the portions got smaller, they charged me for a side or jalapeños that used to be free. Here is the worst part, I am on  A diet and asked for just a hamburger patty and they charged me full price, Saying they are a company store and They have rules now. Paying eight bucks for a patty left a bad taste in my mouth. Wish they would go back to the way they were before."}
{"text":"Flat beer & undercooked food, McDonalds & Shomars are a definite step up. Management never visited the table even after food was sent back, obviously the employees take notice and don't care either."}
{"text":"Horrible service!! Smells like a dam nursing home!! Freezing cold had to ask for them to shut the door! Food is not good."}
{"text":"Some straight garbage. The owner, manager, and chef should be embarrassed.Service wasn't bad but the good was a disgrace. They need help."}
{"text":"I was so excited when this establishment was about to open. I dearly wanted another pub in the Surprise area. We tried it within the first week and the food seemed average at best. However it was new and we went along with it.  Fast forward to three months ago and I took my friend there for her birthday lunch. I ordered a cheeseburger with a side salad. My friend ordered a salad. Neither dish tasted like it was supposed to. The salad greens were already wilting and I found a chopped lettuce core on my plate. The burger tasted sour and when I asked the waitress, I was told it was oregano. But it tasted fishy or rotten.  We have never returned."}
{"text":"Can you give less than a 1 star.  Absolutely awful!  Second visit there and the food was stale, old, dry, flavorless - just lousy.  We sent one plate back because it looked and tasted as it had sat for hours before being given to us.  What was resent by the staff was not much better.  Chicken sandwiches were tough, fries were cold, chicken wings were old and stale and fried pickles were awful - tasted as if they were fried with a bunch of fish.    Only good note was that the beer was cold.  Second visit there - first visit was not much better and we thought we'd give it a second chance.  Will never be back - save your money and go 15 minutes north to more options in the Dilworth area - or south to the Pump house along the river."}
{"text":"I don't know why we keep going back.  Rarely do we really like the food.  Today had Philly Steak sandwich. Was so greasy and French fries were under cooked. Waited a very long time for food.  Chairs outside need to be replaced. Some of the chairs were almost laying down because springs were broken.  These are outdoors chairs with a little recline and rocker.  Nice location.  Terrible food and service."}
{"text":"I am very surprised of how clean and nice this sports bar is considering the reviews. Great service. Our waitress was friendly and spoke clearly. Great drink specials. Although we are from the Tampa area we are Cowboy fans and needed to find a place to watch the game. They a compadres out request and seated us in a nice section of the restaurant. The food was well prepared. I suggest the new breaded pickles when you visit. Thanks for a great time with family and a great game."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with the \"beef\". Ordered the Prime Rib sandwich. Awful to say the least. The bun was stale and the sandwich was barely warm. No sense in further details.  Not worth the visit. The icing on the cake came when I visited the men's restroom before leaving. Nuff said. I won't ever be back.  The Beef should be embarrassed as the facility is a mess. There was more urine on the floor than in the urinal."}
{"text":"we had a great night out with friends and our family at Beef O Brady's- they even ran out of milk for my our sons during our meal and the owner ran over to the nearly grocery to purchase more for them. The owner and his crew were attentive to our party and willing to cater to us to make sure we had the best experience possible."}
{"text":"Wait and wait for sub-par food.  I've given this particular restaurant three chances.  Every time, the service seemed to be in slow-motion and food has never been good.  The last time I went, I decided to play it safe and order the burger.  It was cooked very well-done after asking for it medium.  The fries were soggy and the beer tasted like the taps are never cleaned.  How this place survives in a trendy neighborhood is beyond me.  Try: Leaving and going somewhere else  Avoid:  Going in the first place"}
{"text":"Features fast food quality combined with exceptionally long waits.  \"Specialty\" fish & chips looked & tasted worse than fish sticks.  Would have rather choked down a Big Mac than attempt their hamburger. Took nearly an hour to receive our food.  If it wasn't for location & TVs, this place would have likely been gone long ago."}
{"text":"My husband had been to this chain in FL years ago and was eager to try it out here in AZ.  Unfortunately, it was not how he remembered.  I had never been but was disappointed by the experience.    The food did not look or taste fresh and seemed overpriced.  Service was very slow.  With so many other restaurant choices in the Valley, we will not be returning here."}
{"text":"Sorry just terrible   Service. Freezer burnt tasting food. No refills after we asked.  Held us captive to get our check. Just not a great place. Incompatible to other franchises."}
{"text":"Gross, bland food. I ordered a garlic roast beef sandwich and they didn't even have horseradish. The roast beef was rubbery. There were fruit flies all around our table, and we saw a bug crawling on the floor. I ordered they're \"fruit\" sangria, and it was all raspberry. I hate raspberry and when I told the waitress it was gross and sent it back she STILL charged us for it."}
{"text":"First the good news:  got seated fast, service was quick and friendly.  And they got that mega Coke machine which gives you a choice of link a gazillion pop combinations.  Ok, that's about all the good I can say about this place.    The bad news:  food lacked in both quality and quantity.  The person I was with ordered the fish and chips.  He got 4 tiny, over-breaded, greasy filets, greasy corn chips, a smattering of fries and a little serving of cole slaw.  NOT worth the $12.99 they charge.  I got a burger which was actually pretty good, but for $15, I'd expect to feel at least a bit full.  As far as the fried food went, it seemed like they cooked it all ahead of time, then re-dunked it in the grease when ordered (as someone who worked as a cook for 10 years, I speak from experience).  The menu is big, but it seemed filled with lots of stock photos...a bad sign.  If your food is decent, you should show it.  I heard of this chain and always wanted to try it.  Well, at least I know better now."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. I was surprised by the hospitality and warmness of the employees. I didnt try any of there food there,but the drinks and service were impressive"}
{"text":"Music is great. Nice family atmosphere. Food is varied and good. Lots of options on the menu. Very kid friendly.  Tonight the food was ok. Not hot. Usually it is great"}
{"text":"Food was overcooked and service was horrible. Would not recommend to anyone. Only positive was they offer military discount."}
{"text":"Food bland, service slow.  You would think that an establishment with Beef in their name would offer prime beef products instead of poor quality food at prime prices.    If you like frozen pre-formed hamburger patties and dry bland cheese steaks, then this is the place for you.  I'm done with Beefs and will not be going back.    Teakwoods is the place for excellent service and consistent quality foods."}
{"text":"Food not great. Got a burger, bun was cold and u get very little fries for the price. Not recommended"}
{"text":"The service was good but the food not so much. I ordered a Ruben with a side of wings. The Ruben was a lunch meat sandwich and the wings were tuff and chewy. 2 thumbs down"}
{"text":"I frequent Beefs quite often as I work near by.  I walk in, order my food at the bar and in 10-15 minutes im out.  The staff is always friendly to me and offers me drinks while I wait.  The decor is very approriate for an Irish pub... dark and green, lol.  My \"odor\" so many people comment on is not the fault of the establishment.  Other places in the area have the smae problem.  It has something to do with the pipes under the building.  Recently I have noticed scented candles put out and the bar/patio window opened.  This has helped the issue.  I LOVE the Garlic Roast Beef melt that has been mentioned in other reviews.  It is my go to sandwich.  I get it with shredded cheddar and mustard.  All of my coworkers LOVE the fried zucchini and fried mushrooms for happy hour.  People have told me good things about the bacon and cheese chips, but I am not a \"kettle chip\" type of person.  I recommend this place to many of my clients."}
{"text":"First time there and will be the last.  We sat at the bar and they do have a good selection of beers.  We ordered food at the bar and each had sandwiches that the meat was very bland and dry, fries were ok."}
{"text":"The first time I ate here it was great! Service was on point and the food was yummy. I couldn't wait to go back. My second experience did me in, though. Our waitress was someone who I suppose was also working the bar and she was neither friendly nor helpful. Quite possibly one of the worst experiences I've had with a waitress. When my boyfriend and his friend asked what beers they had on tap, all she said was, \"a lot\" with a blank, annoyed expression, and never offered to get us a drink menu. We were never asked if we wanted our drinks refilled, either. I looked over and saw our waitress texting on her phone at the bar, so maybe that's why she didn't pay much attention to us. I'd like to try this place again, but if I had the same waitress as before, i'd run the other way. The food was still good that day. Service left a lot to be desired, though."}
{"text":"Finally tried this place out so my husband and I sat at the bar since we didn't have the kids. The bartender was really nice and attentive always checking on us we did order an appetizer which was the pretzel bread sticks and it came with a cheese dipping sauce and boy we enjoyed it so much l. We will be back to try out more of the menu tonight was just to feel out the place."}
{"text":"Beef O' Brady's makes Applebees food seem gourmet by comparison. Not long ago I won a Beef's gift card in a raffle and I actually gave it away. Even for free, I'm not going there.  This place is a total pass."}
{"text":"The lay out of this place is weird and it makes for an uncomfortable meal.  The food was bland and the drinks were OK at best.  The service was good though and that made up for a lot of the rest."}
{"text":"I haven't had worse food in years. Pickle chips were like rubber; pizza sauce tasted like tomato paste. If you just want a drink, this is an ok place, but avoid the food!"}
{"text":"5 of us visited this new restaurant yesterday. I have been to many other Beef O'Brady's in other states and have been happy.  Sadly, this restaurant needs help. I ordered their traditional 8 wing baskets, which is one of their \"signature\" dishes.  If this was their signature, then they sign using an X.  I have never received smaller wings, even the generic brand at the grocery store are larger. Then to make it worse they were over cooked and dried out. Most had no sauce on them, it appeared, rather than coating them in sauce, they just poured a small amount over the wings after they were placed in the basket.   The others food was no better.  Typical frozen fried fish, frozen tasteless fries, etc.   My meal came with cole slaw, which didn't come, I had to ask several times for it.  We were told the kitchen was having problems as much of the kitchen staff didn't come in.   I hope they can pull it together, but I have my doubts.  My comments fell on deaf ears, and the wait staff was indifferent at best.   I feel their menu is much too large, and because of that, they offer typical frozen generic foods.  I would much rather see a smaller but fresh menu.   I will not be going back to this location, which is sad since it it so close."}
{"text":"Very Generic looking place with a buffalo wild wings type menu. This was our first time here but unless I'm abducted and brought here against my will, I don't think I'll be back. Everything was bad. The food was cold and the beer was warm. I hope they turn it around."}
{"text":"This place is largely a disappointment. Everyone who works there is very nice. However the food is terrible. We have been twice and it has been bad both times. It is really over priced for the food quality. I would go somewhere else."}
{"text":"This restaurant just opened up in a location which used to be an old dive bar. It is entirely remodeled and updated-it doesn't smell like puke anymore like the old place.  We ordered the \"famous\" wings and an appetizer sampler.  The wings were good, but there are some other joints nearby with better wings.  The food was good, I would like to go back and try some other items.   They have a great patio, a lot of indoor seating. The service was good.   Overall, a great place to have in the neighborhood. We will be back."}
{"text":"What a nasty place. We went as a family to mediocre food, mediocre service, and mediocre cleanliness. Bill was $90.01 we left 5-$20 bills. Once we left we walked around to see other shops near by. On our way to our car a manager ran up to us and blamed us for leaving only $67 on the bill. The waitress claimed we shorted her. We told him he is wrong and asked him to review the cameras. We walked back to the restaurant only for him to tell us they don't have cameras. Then the waitress hid instead of confronting us. That manager is a loser, the waitress is a liar and thief, and really hope everyone sees this review. How dare you blame us and confront us on some petty money."}
{"text":"This is a sports bar with the basic menu you would expect from such offerings.  The fries are good, but everything else is just blah.  The biggest offense is that this sports bar has dated tvs that are losing their picture."}
{"text":"Went here not long after they opened. I expected pub food. Pub food can be awesome. I ordered a burger and fries. The burger might as well have been a cow patty, it tasted like one. The fries just plain sucked. I didn't leave anything there, so I don't have a reason to go back."}
{"text":"It was ... OK. Waitstaff was awkward. I don't understand why people who are unfamiliar with interaction with other people go into a service job."}
{"text":"As my girlfriend and I decided where we wanted to watch the UNC vs Duke game she suggested Beef O Brady's. I agreed we walked over to the location in Baxter.  I am walking up to the location I see it says family sports bar, never been here before wanting to give it a try. Our waiter was great the food was pretty good. Regular bar food, made a little change to my order and the waiter made sure it came out like I wanted. While I am eating I look up and see a man, a woman, and a child sitting at a table near the bar. The man is in the woman's face yelling at her about something, he continues to the point where I wanted to get up and say something to him.  I didn't, I flagged our waiter down and told him \"that gentleman is yelling at that lady\" the waiter responds \"yes I know that's our owner and his wife!\"  I said that's crazy.  The waiter responds \"I'm sorry I wish there was something I could do\".   We will not be back, I can't respect a place when the owner is going to cause a scene in front of his customers by yelling at his wife in front of everyone and his child.   If a family friendly place wants business the best place to start is probably with the owners own family. Just saying."}
{"text":"Our server was Evan J we where at table 56 and there was 3 of us store#408 Found a long black hair in my fish taco I understand things happen in restaurants first it took us forever to get Evans attention because he wasn't coming back to the table checking to see if everything was okay then we proceeded explain to him about the long hair in the taco he immediately picked up the plate and took it away he asked if wanted something else I said no he just took it back and never sent a manager out and never came back to say oh I'm sorry do you want something which is very unprofessional my wife works as a sever and was shocked that a manager never came out and said anything very bad experience."}
{"text":"Not bad...asked for my burger Med Rare...came in Med well....but wasn't expecting much. Kids eat free on Tuesdays, and from 4-6 they have  .99 Yuengling Drafts...can't beat that. For the price it's worth a shot...I'll come back and give them another try. Some other people near us had Wings and they looked pretty good.."}
{"text":"Are you hungry - don't stop @ Beef O Brady's.  You will starve to death before you ever get served.   By far the worse service that I have had at a restaurant in the last decade.  The place was beyond disorganized.  The staff is in desperate need of training, processes and leadership.  It was a mid-week dinner for us. We thought that it would be quicker to grab a bite while we were in the area.  The hostess we reduced to using a crayon on the back of a kids coloring book page. There wasn't a pen to be seen in the disorganized space. She told us that it would be a 10-15 minute wait for a table and she was accurate.  Her accuracy was the best part of our dining experience.  While we were outside waiting we could here one waitress loudly complaining to a table of guests how they were short handed and blaming people who didn't come in for all the problems.  I should have gone home. But I was hungry, thirsty and 30 minutes from home.  We got our table and menus. And waited  And waited  And waited  After about 15 minutes our server finally showed up. She took our drink order and before we could tell her that we were ready to order food, she bolted.  So we waited  And waited.  And waited.  15 minutes later she came back with the water for my wife, soda for my son. But no beer for me.  And before we could tell her that we were ready to order food, she bolted. So we waited.  And waited.  5 minutes later I had my beer.  And we were finally able to order food.  Fried pickles for an appetizer and two dinners. She tried to bolt before taking my son's order. After stopping her from bolting she took my son's order.  (She was sitting next to him in the booth when she was taking our orders so I have no clue how she forgot about him).  About 15 minutes later we got our dinners.  But not the appetizer that we ordered.  Fine, I had my soup and could finally eat. Or so I thought. My soup was room temperature and inedible. Although at this point my beer and my son's drink was empty. No offer was made for refills or waters.  Whatever. I just want to eat and go home. But I had no soup and no pickles.  5 minutes later she came back with the pickles and took the soup back.  She took 5 minutes to microwave the bowl and bring it back. At this point the soup tasted like they opened up a can of Chunky soup.  Sorry, that isn't fair to Chunky. They make decent soup. Whatever. at this point I just want to go home.  We finished eating and then waited for the server to clear the table and bring our check.  And waited.  And waited.  She finally made her way back.  She cleared the table, but did not have our check ready. So we waited.  And waited.  Finally brought the check and bolted.  The check was wrong.  It had more food than we ordered on it.  I was still charged for the lukewarm microwaved soup.  Whatever. I just want to go home.  I put my card in the slot and waited  And waited.  Finally she came back. We told her about the mistake on the bill for the extra food.  She bolted. And you guessed it - we waited  And waited.  5 minutes later we finally got the credit card receipt and I could finally go home.  Total time - 1 hour 48 minutes in the middle of the week for a beer, fried pickles and bowl of soup.  Wife had a burger and son had soup and sliders.  We won't every be back.  I recommend finding some other place to attempt to eat."}
{"text":"Been to Beef O'Brady's twice.  My hubby and I were psyched about having a place nearby to have some appetizers, a few drinks, maybe watch a game and chill.    Unfortunately the service and food was below average.  Service was very slow in taking our order and delivering our food (both times).  We had to stop waitress to give us another drink refill (sodas AND beer)...had wings (average tasting), nachos (never had been someplace that \"messed up\" nachos)---apparently the chips are made there and were overdone around the edges.  My mozarella sticks were undercooked and the dipping sauce was runny.    We tried to give them a second shot after the first disappointment, but the second visit was just as much of a bummer....don't plan on making a third visit...had heard awesome things about this franchise, this one is a forgettable dining experience!"}
{"text":"Zzzzzzzzzz.  Passable bar food at best.  About two ticks below a Winking Lizard.  Is that even possible?"}
{"text":"Too many low life locals in this place especially the fat guy that wear a dew rag and road a Harley."}
{"text":"i ask for a burger the waitress ask how you want that done i said well done not burnt it came barely cooked"}
{"text":"I really want to like this place because it's so close & I can see the potential of this being a great sports bar. THE GOOD: I went for happy hour & you definitely get a lot of food for the $.  THE BAD: The servers need a bit more experience. THE UGLY: The overall decor is flat out lacking. Maybe they aren't done... please say it's not done."}
{"text":"Welp....if it had not been for the excellent waitress, I would not have given this place 3 stars.. Hannah was awesome, very friendly and attentive during our visit.   But the food was just....MEH....I tried a grilled chicken wrap, which has grilled chicken, mayo, lettuce, tomatoes, cheese and a side of ranch dressing. All wraps come with fries, they are shoe string very typical...nothing special.   The food was bland in my opinion, nothing really stood out to me from the wrap, my friend ordered the chicken tenders they were hard and crunchy....which in this instance was not  good thing, because most of the tenders were left on the plate.   I mean the food was good for what it was, nothing that makes me want to return any time soon."}
{"text":"Completely new menu.  New items and a sweet coke freestyle machine.   I have the steak burrito and it was delicious"}
{"text":"Well I decided to try it out yesterday(Sunday) despite the reviews and I was terribly disappointed. We walked in and waited five minutes to be seated(the place was dead btw)  the waitress didn't seem to want to serve us and kept disappearing, we waited a very long time for the food and it was cold. But the best part was the bill... waaayyy to expensive for cold food and bad service. I will never go here again. Don't waste your time and money on this place."}
{"text":"Dish was prepared to per perfection and our waitress Kayleigh was very friendly and knowledgeable about menus and food"}
{"text":"The food was mediocre at best, their drinks were actually pretty fairly priced, and our server had a delightful personality, but that's as far as the good things went. Now for the bad.. In order to get anything brought to our table I feel like it had to be put in a wait line. THEY WEREN'T EVEN BUSY! Seriously, we ordered drinks, ten minutes later we got them, do they have a brewery in the kitchen that nobody knows about? Are they brewing the beer themselves? That's the only acceptable reason for me. At a certain point it began to be humorous because after our drinks came, one of my party members asked for ice water, WHY would it take anyone ANOTHER ten minutes to get a glass of ice water? Are they flying to the Himalayan mountains and gathering snow in a bucket and bringing it back? Then going to Antarctica and chipping off blocks of ice for the perfect glass of ice water? Come on now. And maybe calling it a party is kind of extensive, there was ONLY four of us. If that's overwhelming then they're in the wrong line of work. After we had finished and asked for the check it took twenty-five minutes, our server came dropped off the checks and left without even so much as a, \"sorry for the wait.\" Although we did ask the check to be split three ways, but twenty-five minutes?  We might give it another chance if we have some time to KILL."}
{"text":"Most of my family loves this place it's a very fun entertaining place with a mini arcade and average food. Awesome for me and kids not for adults."}
{"text":"The food was not very good but the service was great and the restaurant itself is nice. The bar would be a great place to drink and watch a game."}
{"text":"I can second the motion on all the other reviews of customers who had long wait times. I went with my friend around 8pm, and the place was nearly empty. There were 2 dozen tables we could have been seated at but the server told us \"Someone will seat you shortly\". Well that \"Shortly\" turned into 45 minutes, and it was the same lady that eventually seated us. We learned from our waitress that she was the manager, and that both her servers didn't come in that evening. So she was running the floor by herself. The food was ok, it just took way too long to get it. What was supposed to be a \"Quick bite to eat\" turned into 2 hours."}
{"text":"Poor service and even worse bar food. Tried this place twice but it seemed to get worse. If you're by the movie theater and want to eat the Mexican place next to It had great food and a friendly staff."}
{"text":"One of the beat restaurants in surprise, great food and great service."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner before heading to the Comedy Zone nearby and was SEVERELY DISAPPOINTED.  It was your typical bar food, re-heated from frozen pre-made stuff.  I got the steak nachos and they were nothing special.  The steak was dry.  Their \"award-winning\" wings were no better than any others I've ever had and on top of it we, we were seated at a table right next to the door that let the cold air in every time someone walked in and out.  We were freezing!  Our waitress was not good at all.  We had to ask three times for re-fills on our drinks and she was pretty much rude the whole time.  Like we were bothering her when we were ordering food.  Needless to say, we will not be going back.  There are plenty of other restaurants nearby to pass this one up."}
{"text":"Good beer selection, ok neighborhood bar. Food was typical American bar food. Nothing really special here, nothing bad here."}
{"text":"First let me say I am in the restaurant business. That being said I HATE to give poor reviews. In this case I have no choice. When i first walked in I thought : GENERIC Bennigans. Those of you old enough to remember Bennigans restaurants will understand.  THE SERVICE  Sara our server was good. She was very polite and genuine. I appreciated her service. She was the only bright spot.  THE FOOD   GENERIC, lower quality,  I completely understand that the franchisees in these types of business have zero to next to zero input as far as suppliers and food quality. They are buying a cookie cutter type operation with brand standards and operations set in stone. It takes an act of congress to create any real substantial change. This is NOT a reflection of the franchisee who I do not know. The food was lower quality product to start with so how much can they really do with it. The presentation was ho hum at best.  I can not stress enough the GENERICness of the food. The food was a total dissapointment.  THE AMBIENCE  Misses totally ! A trip to Wal-Mart and you could buy 90% of the decor. Unimaginitive and showed lack of any substantial design other then put it on the wall and it will be a sports bar. Pictures, jerseys, pennants, and TVs do not make an environment. It felt empty and hollow.   OVERALL  Dont bother. You can do better many other places. I am sorry to say. I do not know anything about the finances behind the restaurant However, if it is not going to be supported as a losing entity Beef O Bradys days are aleady numbered."}
{"text":"\"Slow service. Received hardly any fries with meal. Guacamole was frozen. Broccoli was not fresh. Not coming back\""}
{"text":"I was here last night, this place looked amazing. I was impressed from the moment I walked. Great atmosphere great service. They have only been open for a few months and there wasn't much of a crowd but it's a great spot to grab a beer and watch the game."}
{"text":"Been to Beefs a few times since I live in the area. Good pub style food and decent drinks. My recent visit was for lunch. Ordered the fried fish tacos. Fish and toppings especially the spicy aioli were delicious but the tortillas weren't heated which was odd. The chips served with it were very good. Mom had a soup/ salad combo and the tomato soup was fabulous an the sandwich - a Reuben was  good.   I would have gone 4 stars but the waitress was pretty bad. For instance when she took our drink order I asked if they had a drink menu to show drinks and she said no. When she left I found it on the table. Waited quite a while to place order and get the check. When working the lunch crowd, ya gotta be quick. She was talking to another employee and people at the bar. So basically good decent pub food (Baxter prices though) not so great service.  They also need serious upgrades. Some flat screen TVs but most are old 90s box TVs with pretty crummy quality. That upgrade alone might make A biiiiig differences"}
{"text":"Amazing beer selection at awesome prices..  And with NFL ticket I won't miss a game!"}
{"text":"Love the food and service. Great for the family or for sitting at the bar. Gods food and spirits!"}
{"text":"Food was good. Service just above good. Outside sitting was nice and they are dog friendly. We will be coming back if we are in the area."}
{"text":"Order the Pub Chips - so yummy!  My husband and I go here occassionally for drinks and apps, never been disappointed.  Service is always good.  The owner is a cool dude.  Food is hot and fresh.  Family friendly (go on Wednesday nights).  Affordable."}
{"text":"Good location and a nice, clean, updated facility.  That's about all the nice things I can say.  Most of the wait staff are good, but some are bad and a few just don't care.  The prices are kind of high.  However, if you get emailed specials from corporate, most of the wait staff say \"what specials?\"  Apparently, the owner doesn't honor chain-wide advertisements like the \"Value Menu\" (which you know has to exist and have to specifically ask for that menu, otherwise, you'll never see it), Customer Appreciation day on the 20th of every month (I've visited on the 20th 4 times in the past year and have not received the advertised promo coupon).  It seems like the restaurant runs itself without any supervision.  The owner never seems to be around and the managers goof off in the kitchen or at the bar.  The owners or managers never visit tables or ask people about their dining experience.  The problems in this restaurant are fixable, but only if the owner starts to care and takes a more active role in ensuring quality control."}
{"text":"Usually good.  Last two times, including tonight, food has been sub-par.  Stale pretzel mini-burger buns...   Old cheese sauce for the nachos (they even said they had to thaw out old frozen sauce for us)...   Just bot good or fresh.  Service was excellent though."}
{"text":"Hadn't been in here for awhile so tried it Sunday 10/12 to catch the Bears game. Place was pretty busy but we got seated fast. The hostess (who was super cute with some great looking cans that I'd love to see in person) changed the channel to the gane we  wanted on the TV closest  to us. I really like that because most places have assigned seating for the NFL package and you need to arrive early to get a good seat. The service was a touch on the slow side but not bad considering how busy they were. The food was what you'd expect for this type of place. Better then last time for sure. The fries were over done and the chips needed more cheese but other than that everything went great. Probably make this my NFL ticket spot, especially if that hostess works every Sunday!"}
{"text":"Decent tap list. They had Sculpin on tap so that speaks for itself. Food is ok but typical bar grub. Overall the place has improved from when it first opened."}
{"text":"We went on May 9 and had a pretty nice experience. I'm not sure what's with all of the 2 star ratings because honestly, this place was much better than I was expecting and for those who read my reviews, I have pretty high expectations.   What was good: They offer school fundraisers. This is why we happened to go that night and they donate back 15% to schools. That's a big plus for me.  Although the menu was nothing overly specia, there is a wide selection of items so even if you are watching your weight (as I am), you can make healthy choices without being relegated to the salad section. And the food was tastier than I was expecting. My friend had a Cuban Sandwich and said it was pretty good. The bread was fresh and the meats were plentiful and tasty. My son had fish and chips. The fish was a little greasy, but overall, it was very tasty. We had to ask for tartar sauce and it didn't come with the malt vinegar but I suspect that if we asked, we'd have gotten it. I had a veggie wrap which was brown rice with a variety of mixed veggies with some kind of sauce wrapped in a very large tortilla. It was pretty darn tasty.  My friend and I both had broccoli on the side which was overcooked, but it was nice to have that as an option in a sports bar setting all things considered. We also had a steak quesadilla to start and the steak was VERY flavorful and nicely done.    Our server was SUPER nice and although she made a few mistakes, she took ownership and rectified the problems promptly. For example, she brought us steak nachos when we ordered the steak quesadilla. She apologized, took ownership rather than doing the \"blame the kitchen\" routine, and quickly brought us a new appetizer. She was a little slow on keeping the drinks filled but it was busy so we'll cut her some slack.   What I didn't like:  Thinking back, there wasn't much I didn't like. The food was flavorful, the service was nice, though slow, and the place was nicely lit, open, and inviting. I'd definitely go back for a girls night out situation or at least an adults night out. I guess the one thing I'd have to question is whether or not it's a sports bar or a family restaurant with a sports theme. It's hard to decipher. I guess that would explain some of the other reviews complaining about the lighting and the ambiance because it is hard to determine which theme the restaurant is going for. They do Kids Eat Free on Tuesday nights....so if it's a sports bar...you don't really want kids there. I don't know. I'm rambling.  Here's the bottom line....give it an honest, open minded try. If you don't like it, blame me. If you do like it, blame me. :)"}
{"text":"The food was average at best. The prices were on the moderate to higher for typical bar food. They do have a big selection to choose from, but I'm not sure that will help if it's all average. My friend that joined me said his sampler plater appetizer had no flavor. The pretzel bun sliders were a joke, with a half dollar size patty on a bun 2 1/2 times as big.   I would say the Mushroom burger I had was pretty bland as well.  There were not many mushrooms, and you couldn't taste them. They asked how I wanted the burger cooked, but they only have 2 options, either medium or well. The ice tea they had was nasty!  I thought it was odd that a place with Beef in the name would claim to be famous for wings their wings, but they do. I don't understand why people pay prime rib prices for chicken wings? The one order of wings that I saw go past didn't look like the wings were all that big. At $1 a wing I just say no.   The waitress was pretty good with the service, and the owner did come to our table to check on our thoughts after we finished. That was why I gave them 3 stars instead of 2.   Based on the businesses I've seen in the same location over the last 20 years, I would give these guys 6 to 9 months. They took out the pool tables and added more booths, so this place thinks it's a restaurant. To make it in the restaurant game you have to have food that stands out to make people want to come back.   It's the closest place to my house, so I'll likely give them another try."}
{"text":"My husband has been waiting for them to open as he's from Florida and experienced the original Beefs. He loves their wings. I had a pretzel burger that was excellent. We've also tried the appetizer with fried pickles, onion rings, and pulled pork sliders that were amazing. They have a HUGE menu, great section of beers, and a nice atmosphere. Local feel despite being a chain."}
{"text":"This is another place that makes me wish that we could award half stars... I would give this place 2-1/2 stars, it is just not quite good enough to be in the 3 star range.  Not a bad place to go have a beer and a burger... The atmosphere is that of a typical chain restaurant. There are tons of TV's lining the walls. The food is not bad, not great, but not bad. Nothing on the menu is great; the rueben is decent, and the burgers are ok; I would stay away from the fish and chips. They have about 6-7 taps of which a couple are craft, a couple are pseudo craft, and the rest are BMC. The servers were attentive and helpful, and the manager was making rounds, stopping by each table to ensure that everyone was happy with their meals.  Overall, this is a decent place to stop and have a beer and a burger if you are in the area. If you are just looking for a beer and you are in Baxter Village, I would recommend Grapevine, as you will find a better selection of craft beer on tap."}
{"text":"Terrible service. They left us standing at the door when the sign clearly said \"wait to be seated.\" Finally the bartender asked us if we needed something..ummm, yeah, how about a table? Once we were FINALLY seated they flipped the sign to \"seat yourself\" then flipped it again before we left to \"wait to be seated.\" Once we got a server the service was OK, but the food was terrible. Complete waste of $$. Each person in our party ordered something different and we all tried each others food and all of them were bland with zero taste. That is $40 I'll never see again in my life. This place may be good to watch the game and have a few beers, but don't plan on actually eating anything here."}
{"text":"Low prices on craft beer, large booths and kid friendly before 8pm. Happy hour starts at 3PM"}
{"text":"Service was great - servers were all nice.  Good selection of beer on tap.  We did not eat so I can't rate that yet.  The lights are a big problem at night.  I understand they are working on dimmers for the bar side and hope that happens soon.  The long table in the middle of the bar area should be separated into 2 or may even 3 tables.  Not everyone wants to sit with strangers that are very loud."}
{"text":"Got a good selection of craft beers!! Everyone is super friendly bartender shannon and Amenda remembered my name and what I ordered the 2nd time I walked in. Got a great making for neighborhood hangout!!"}
{"text":"Consistent food and has been for years, great beer selection and they are now able to sell alcohol (have been for a while) the drinks are a bit high. Pet friendly on the outside patio. The interior is getting a bit aged and in need of some new tv's, they still have tube tv's."}
{"text":"The food is really good but the prices are a bit steep. I ordered the O'Brady burger (medium) with fries. It was more food than I could eat and I was pretty famished.The service was also really good. I would go back."}
{"text":"Food is always good and staff is helpful and friendly. Fun place to eat and enjoy the trivia nights."}
{"text":"Went to Beef O'Brady's for lunch, it was empty at 1 p.m. Not a good sign.  I think if Denny's were to do pub fare it would be Beef O'Bradys. The menu has salads, wings, burgers and sandwiches. Nothing fancy. But its decent. I just suspect most things here came pre-packaged from a can or frozen from a bag.   I had the fish and chips. My friend ordered a burger. They were both ok just not delicious. My fish and chips tasted like something I could get at Long John Silver. My friend's burger was on par to something from Wendy's. Again, edible but not amazing.  I imagine that they might be busier during a game, since there are lots of tvs in the bar area. But who knows. I will not be clamoring to go back."}
{"text":"I hate to give a poor review to a restaurant in the city I live in, but I have no choice.  This is supposed to be a sports bar, but I have never been in one where the lighting was so bright.  Hopefully that has changed since I was there.  Also, the seats are booths, which I normally like.  But if you want  it to be a lively place, then it should be a little more open.   The food was okay.  It was a decent deal since we went to the reverse happy hour.  I would suggest going during those hours.  Our server did her best.  It didn't seem like she really knew the menu too well.  I had the sliders with the pretzel bun...The bacon is good.  That's about it.  I didn't like the bun at all.  It was really dry.  The curly fries were good.  I really do hope they improve."}
{"text":"It's a sports bar.  For being a sports bar the service is good, the food is fine and the atmosphere is good.  Solid 4 stars."}
{"text":"They have a very nice food and beer selection to fulfill any taste. I have been here several times, usually to watch games: there are plenty of screens to view your preferred sporting event.  The service is attentive, friendly, and helpful- very impressive. On my recent visit, I had the buffalo chicken wrap, which was excellent. I will be back."}
{"text":"Sorry to do this but!!!! I brought my wife here for the first time after we caught a movie. It was on Sunday, during football games. Now this place was half empty, not good when you depend on the football crowd. Service was great, and very nice. We order their double pepperoni pizza, and their burger sliders. Pizza, was awful! Tasted like it was a frozen pizza!!! HOLD ON, I can find frozen pizza that taste better!!! It was even worse, when we reheated at home!! Their burger sliders were good, nothing special. Seems like the food just not that great! Now when we where there watching a game, there was a table of four playing dominoes!!! Seriously! They were loud, slamming their so called bones on the table!! Just stay home and play your game! I'm surprised they let them treat their tables like that?? But then again, when your business is slow, you start being desperate! I hate giving out 1-Star reviews, and almost gave one!!! Just put out better food, and stop allowing customers to do what they want to!!!"}
{"text":"We eat here often for many reasons.... 1, it's right around the corner! 2, it's good! The ribs... Omg! So yummy! 3,4,5,6 it's right around the corner!! Kids eat free on Tuesdays, make sure you call ahead to confirm, as it has changed in the past.   It's priced decent. You can get 4 ribs, 4 chicken tenders and fries for $10. That is enough to feed 2 kids or 2 adults if you are looking for something lite to eat.   Lots on the menu. The have drink specials on weekends and ladies nights.   By the amount of my check ins, you can tell I am a fan!!"}
{"text":"From the outside/location my boyfriend and I thought this place had to be pretty good. We were wrong, first of all, the TVs ( they have a lot) but are from the 80s, can't read the score. I got the soup/Cuban he got the \"firecracker\" both tasted horrible.  Go to mcdonalds for a better burger and panera for soup and sandwich."}
{"text":"From the corner that brought you Hitts, Howie's, and the Regal Beagle comes... BEEF O'BRADY'S.  Awful location, awful name.  The food, however, was pretty decent for bar food.  My burger had fresh toppings and a tasty brioche bun, even though the patty seemed to be pre-formed.  The onion rings were battered.  I prefer breaded, but the spicy dipping sauce was delicious.  And that's about all there was to say that's good about this place.  It was not cheap.  The burger was $8.50, and the onion rings cost extra.  They snuck in a charge for cheese on my friend's burger, whereas it was included on mine.  Despite having several nice TV's, the viewing angles weren't great to see multiple TVs.  And the staff wasn't up to speed on the menu or the bill.  (It's a new place, so I guess I should cut them some slack.)  The place has potential for happy hour.  $2 domestic drafts.  $4 import drafts with a nice selection.  Large outdoor patio.  But I think the location dooms Beef O'Brady's to a dead crowd except for maybe Friday happy hour."}
{"text":"Food is average at best and service is hit or miss. Been here a few times...never walked away impressed."}
{"text":"Fun place to watch game and eat.   Friendly staff   It's a chain and feels like a chain- shame they can't make it feel more local.  Food good, dependable, nothing spectacular  Get pie if they have Linda's pies- maybe only local item on menu from Linda's Kitchen in Tallmadge."}
{"text":"We love Beefs!  Great for families and wonderful to sit outside and eat on a nice day.  The burgers are fabulous and you can't beat that kids eat free on Sundays and Tuesday evenings.  We always have wonderful service, and we eat here often."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere! We really enjoy it on football Sundays....they have given us our very own Cleveland Browns room. :) That...in itself..is hard to come by! Maybe they are hiding us...who knows. Appetizers and beers are yummy and our own personal Browns waitress is always fantastic. We find it similar to BWW's. Can't say much more as we've never done a real meal there. Good to have a  local place that offers a coupon that can be found in that clipper magazine thingy. Always a good experience :)"}
{"text":"Our Beefs in Florida was always so good. This one did not hit the mark for us. All Beefs should be treated the same. It was no bueno."}
{"text":"Well, I'm just going to say that we walked in we were seated by the hostess in the bar area and waited, and waited, and waited some more while the bartender flirted with some women at the bar,  and finally we got up and left.  There are a lot of new restuants opening in the same plaza and we took our business where people noticed they had customers."}
{"text":"We came here with a few colleges during lunch one day and I have to say I was not impressed. The service is painfully slow! other than that this is just an Irish themed sports bar with the basic menu offering and \"OK\" food. However the atmosphere is very authentic, being decorated to reflect a true Irish pub Establishment ."}
{"text":"Local bar with good drink specials ($3.00) during Happy Hour.  They also have an extensive menu; although, I have not tried the food yet.  Bartenders are really sweet too!"}
{"text":"Recently had lunch here and I could not of been more disappointed. The place was empty but still had to wait to be seated then it took our server a long time to take our drink order. Once we finally ordered the food took almost 40 minutes to arrive and the food was subpar. Basically the entire experience was horrible and I will never return.  If you have other options go there instead of this place."}
{"text":"I've been a patron since they've opened in Surprise. The food is always consistent and the staff is always friendly, the only thing I can ding them on is their housekeeping. It seems that they have become laxed in that department, the last time my family and I ate there we noticed a very distinct smell coming from the restroom/kitchen area. We have not been back since but plan on giving them another try....if the odor is not present. If it is... we will move on and find a new favorite place in Surprise!"}
{"text":"As my 8 year old put it very eloquently when we walked in, Daddy we can't eat here, it's just a beer place  no honey, they have food... but I should have said \"they have Bar Food\" as that's really what it is. Despite being very local we hadn't been in here in about 3 years. And unfortunately it might be another 3 before we come back.  It's fine if your just hungry and need to fill that void in life as we all do, 3 times a day. The pizza was the best item but still just slightly above a $5 Hot n Ready. My daughters chicken fingers were over cooked and my wife and daughter did not like them at all. I actually thought the chicken was ok but I did have a tall IPA. However on draft that's the most flavor you are going to get. I like Micro Brews, darks, Amber's, etc. and I don't like IPAs, but I suffered through it since it had been several years and I didn't want Bud, Bud Light, Miller, Miller Light, yada yada. My side salad was fine, it's hard to mess up a side salad, but the wings were lacking. Seemed like they didn't toss the wings in the sauce and I got their house Buffalo but didn't seem anything more special than standard red hot buffalo sauce. Next time I'll get a burger, I'm guessing that's their better item...."}
{"text":"Didn't know what to order so the server suggest Travis since it was taco Tuesday.  Sure glad she did their salsa is the best.  Definitely doing that again."}
{"text":"First and last time here. Our waitress was friendly and efficient. Unfortunately the food was a disappointment. My husband became ill after eating the trio fajitas. My Greek salad was not worth the price I paid for it. Perhaps different food choices would have resulted in a more favorable review. In addition if you are a vegetarian don't waste your time. Menu had little to offer beside disappointing salad options and grilled cheese."}
{"text":"If you are looking for cheap bar food and really slow service in a bar atmosphere, than this place is for you! The worst thing about our experience was the extremely slow service. There is slow and than there is this place. I am guessing the slow service is do to under staffing issues, lack of lending a hand from a manager and the servers being new. Either way, if they don't do something about it soon they won't stay open long because everyone I have spoke with that has been here has experienced the slow service and said they won't go back because of it.  On to the food... the food is cheap/frozen bar food, but its tasty. There is no culinary genius behind this menu or in the kitchen. Teakwoods down the street from here has much better food, that you can tell had more culinary thought put into it. Despite that the food was pretty good, and priced fair.  The fish taco was disappointing however, but again, fish sticks were used so I can't expect much I suppose. If we order from here again it may be take out. If we dine here again and the service is slow we won't be back."}
{"text":"The owner reached out concerning my previous review which showed care for customer satisfaction!  While I still feel the same about the food, I would go there for drinks based on the care to send personal message to follow up."}
{"text":"I was immediately served when my ass hit the bar stool amazing service. The food was out before I could finish my beer, the bartender was fantastic quick, polite, on top of things and personable. The wings I had where amazing, fresh and very crispy; and the fries where incredible! On top of all this the price was very reasonable."}
{"text":"My wife and I belong to a church group that goes out for lunch once a month. We had made reservations here about two weeks in advance for 12-15 people. First the good. Our waitress Melody was fantastic. She did everything she could to make our visit a good experience. Our group had a large variety of food from the menu. We all agreed that the food was excellent. As I had mentioned Melody was the best waitress. Now the bad. Melody had mentioned that the day before there were two waitresses on duty and the place was dead. Today there was only one waitress, her. In addition, the restaurant was busy. All in all, she literally had to run in order to wait on the tables. The  bartender actually had to leave the bar in order to help. Now I grew up in a business atmosphere, so I have a better than average understanding on how to run a business. 1, for a business that has been open for over a year you have a history on the amount of business you will average on a given day. You plan for this. 2, accidents happen with over/under staffing. That is where a good, responsible, courteous, manager comes into play. The manager gets up off their backside, looks out into the restaurant and if it appears busy, they start helping the employees. In other words, they become waiters or waitresses. Mainly because it shows consideration for their employees, but also because it improves the experience of the customers. Did we see the manager anywhere in the restaurant? NEVER! We only saw our waitress running around, and the bartender trying to do two jobs. Now the big question, will we be back. Quite possibly because of our waitress, definitely not because of the manager (if he/she lasts, of which he/she shouldn't)."}
{"text":"We live across the street and my  husband and sister-in-law have been waiting eagerly for this place to open as it is an homage to their previous residence in Florida. We decided to sit outside on the patio because it's been so beautiful here lately. I'm not sure if that was the reason it took nearly two hours to get our food (two orders of wings, two house salads, and fish and chips) or if it was because they opened two weeks ago and are still learning. I can tell you that it definitely was NOT the fact that they were extremely busy...we went on a Tuesday. Either way, I'm not super impressed. We didn't even order alcohol, which usually slows things down even more. My husband sent his drink (flavored Dasani water) back because of the artificial sweetener taste. Even though the waitress said she would take that off the bill, she didn't. We didn't say anything because we were afraid of how long that was going to take, too. We sat without plain ol' water for a while. I eventually got up and took all of our cups to the bar to get water. I want to go back in hopes that they iron out all the kinks after the newness wares off...but I don't want to have to schedule another two hour chunk out of my night."}
{"text":"I didn't go into this place expecting more than cold beer and bar food, and that's what we got. As a bonus, they also included terrible service. The four of us ordered, one of us ordered a buffalo chicken salad. Three of us got our meals, no salad. 10 minutes later they showed up with a small side salad, which we pointed out was incorrect. 15 minutes later, when our waitress finally came by... she gave us some excuse and said they would comp the salad. Then the slob of a manager came over, gave us a different excuse and told us she wouldn't charge us for the salad. 20 minutes later, after asking AGAIN... It finally showed up. By now all of our food is cold, since we didn't want to start eating until we all had our food.  I had a Reuben... Pretty gross. Pickle chips were bland, greasy and didn't taste like pickles. No one finished their entrée.  Not surprised this place was almost empty on a Friday night... in an area where the spots are almost always packed."}
{"text":"Yum very good good great beer specials during happy hour. Come on Wednesdays and get cheap wings and cheap beer."}
{"text":"Went for lunch, was sat immediately. Service was okay, food was on point. Would return if ever in the area."}
{"text":"I had never been to Beef O'Bradys before but had heard good things so decided to give them a shot.  Hostess sat us down immediately but we got the last open table in the relatively small dining room.  Not sure who our server was \"supposed\" to be but after about 7 or 8 minutes with no one acknowledging we were even there a girl came out from behind the bar to check on us.  She took care of us the rest of the evening and SHE was great. The food was very good and if it had not been for basically being ignored for the first few minutes it would have been a great experience."}
{"text":"First time here after hearing so much about it.  Stopped in for lunch.  Your basic pub menu with burgers and wraps.  Limited variety of entrees as well.  Server was nice and friendly.  They also have the automated soft drink machine so you have a large variety of choices.  Burgers were well prepared.  Fries were OK.  Overall good, but not outstanding location."}
{"text":"Lots of taps.  Not the greatest atmosphere. It's in a mini mall.  But what I love  about this place: bedsides the usual pub food ,  a GRILLED fish sandwich."}
{"text":"Basic frozen food prepared for you.  Can just go to grocery store and buy TGIF frozen wings, chips and salsa and prepare at home for less.  Very slow service."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now. Very impressed with the cleanliness of it. Food is great. Staff is friendly. Great choices on draft beers and bottled. TVs all around to watch the sporting events. Most importantly the menu is VERY affordable and has a very wide variety of items."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE service  and food !!My daughters chicken tenders had jalapeños all over them ! It was clear that the breading is not cleaned out after other foods are dipped .Still had to pay full price because they remade them . Servers are inattentive and no management in sight. Will not be back and will warn  others to avoid."}
{"text":"Standard generic sports pub.  Family friendly which is nice.  Good beer selection and specials!"}
{"text":"Terrible meal, terrible waitress. Nothing good to say about this place. Waitress dumped drink in my lap, forgot 1 out of 4 meals. Would never tell anyone about this place."}
{"text":"I had some time for a burger and beer, so stopped in. They do have a decent selection of local beers and others so I was initially impressed. Looking at the menu, I was equally impressed by the stock photos of the burgers and selected the \"Omaha\". Wasn't a lunch special on this Wednesday afternoon, but for $10, had to be decent.   This was a frozen burger, heavily marinated with  Worcestershire sauce. Real salty, and bland to bat. The pub chips were okay but not worth $10.  Emily the bartender noticed that I didn't eat even half and discounted the meal.    Bartender the best part of this place.   She was professional and talkative, what you expect out of a local pub.   Won't give this place real long, people will catch on to stock photos eventually."}
{"text":"Not very exciting, I'm sorry to say.  We had the philly cheesesteak sandwich, and rib basket combo.  Both were entirely underwhelming and left us thinking we could do better making these dishes at home.  In fact, we'd be more inclined to eat at the divey JB's in Sun Prairie than stop here again."}
{"text":"Grossly over prices. They do have a good drink selection in both sodas and spirits. But I ordered a prime rib dip sand which and the cost was $13. It was not a $13 meal. Everything else my family had was just mediocre. I don't like to leave bad reviews but this place just wasn't worth it."}
{"text":"Food is average and for the price they don't give you much. For what they charge I always seem to leave here hungry. Service is always fairly good.Although the last time we were here the service was the worst.Note to the so called \"manager\" that likes to peek his head out from the kitchen If you see it is busy and your staff is running around because there is only 2 or 3 of them HELP THEM!!!"}
{"text":"I've visited the Stow location twice and was disappointed both times. The second time I didn't even leave a tip the service was so bad. I had a burger both times since I would think that would be the prime focus of a restaurant with \"beef\" in the title. The burger  had no taste. There was no seasoning, and the bun on the bottom was about 2/3 the size of the patty. There were at least 8 servers when I was there both times, and they just huddled together talking and having fun rather than servicing their tables. Have no plans to return and assume they'll be out of business soon."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner and ordered off the 2 for 20 menu.  Started with the buffalo chicken dip which had a good flavor but not much chicken.  Had the bacon chicken and steak bowl.  Both dishes didn't have much flavor.  The chicken was very chewy.    Probably a good place to grab a beet and watch a game but not much in the food department."}
{"text":"Waited over an hour for a patio table to hear the band Oneppo Brothers. Ate a mediocre appie at the bar (with their cheap house wine...Barefoot) and realized the band 'holds' tables for friends and the manager sat folks ahead of us. Eat somewhere else and sit outside their bar and listen from a nearby place instead."}
{"text":"Best fish tacos I have ever tried, and I have tried many. I head here almost every Tuesday and get the two fish taco deal with fries. I have never been disappointed.   The service is fast and friendly. The tacos are amazing and the salads are good too. The facility is clean and easy to spot from the road.   This is a great place to get that Tuesday fix under $10."}
{"text":"First time I was there and the service was great. No complaint there. The food was decent. I ordered a chicken cheesesteak with French fries and I've had better. I don't think I'll order that again. However, I will give it another shot and try something else. Service is what kept me intrigued and willing to return."}
{"text":"This is the place to go for wings! I've been going to Beef's in Florida all my life and couldn't be happier to find they have expanded to Chandler. Great place to have a beer and watch the game. Their happy hour is pretty good and they have a large patio. The staff was really friendly too!"}
{"text":"The Smell We tried it twice both times the odor hits you when you walk in. It smells like sewer gas. I am in the HVAC and pluming business there are some issues there with the venting of the sewer line or Grease trap?"}
{"text":"Food is horrible,  tv's are old and crappy,  this place sucks.  Total identity crisis,  is it a sports bar,  live music venue,  bar?  No idea,  but I do know the food just blows,  do not under any circumstantial order the ribs.  They are baked,  no smoke flavor,  covered with BBQ sauce.  Just disgusting.  If the owner reads this please fix the grub,  this would be a great neighborhood place if the food wasn't so God awful."}
{"text":"I went there today with my daughters for lunch.  I ordered the philly steak sandwich, which looked totally yummy in the menu picture.  What I received was anything but!  The menu picture showed a philly steak sandwich in a hoagie roll, overflowing with meat, cheese and peppers.  What is received was 2 halves of an open face roll with dried up crumbly beef, uncooked peppers and semi melted sliced cheese.  I requested curly fries....what I received was the dried up bits left in the fry basket.   The wasn't a curl on the whole plate.  The diet coke however, was good.  My younger daughter wanted a pink lemonade.   The waitress informed her that they had regular lemonade or a raspberry limeade which she recommended.  My daughter opted for the limeade.  After waiting what seemed like forever to my daughter, she received a drink that was way too tart for a child to drink.    The waitress was nice though not very attentive, however, I was willing to overlook this given the lunch rush.  However, now that I've read other reviews, it would seem that this level of service in the norm.  The manager came over and apologized for my sandwich, took the price of the sandwich and the limeade off my bill and gave me a $10 gift certificate to entice me to come back.  To be honest, after reading the other reviews, I don't think I will be back.  It seems as if they have seriously gone down in quality and service, which is rather a shame as we used to like this eatery."}
{"text":"After reading the previous reviews I was hesitant to go to this particular site, I'm glad I followed my personal history with Beef's rather than others reviews. The Watterson was excellent, the dry rub Cajun wings were great, my wife's grilled buffalo chicken salad got eaten very fast, and my son couldn't finish the chef salad it was so big. The staff, Nicole and Alyssa, were very attentive and kept our drinks full and the food coming. I would recommend this location, and I don't usually do that. Like I told Nicole when I was there, as we discussed the Yelp reviews, \"sometimes you just have to have a Watterson!\" So dang good."}
{"text":"I can't DISAGREE more with all of the negative posts'! I haven't been here in a while but I want to voice MY opinion... I've had several meals here and ALL were excellent along with every aspect of service. I've also enjoyed the live bands in the summer that play outside. I've patronized every one of the other high priced and overrated neighboring restaurants in Baxter Village. My hope was to enjoy a good meal close to home and avoid driving to the south park area of Charlotte to go to a \"nice\" restaurant THERE. Needless to say, I've regretted not making the 25 minute treak - to support LOCAL  business. Thankfully Beef's mitigates the short comings of the others nearby and brings redemption without pretentiousness."}
{"text":"There is absolutely no reason to go to Beef O' Brady's.  There are better Irish Pubs out there and near the same area.  The location isn't good at all.  It's located in the corner in a plaza with nothing to do in that plaza besides watch a movie.  If that's the case, then there are plenty of other Irish pubs you can head to.  The food is typical pub food and there is zero variety or difference or even speciality that would separate it from the dozens of other Irish Pubs littered all over West Phoenix.  Furthermore the beer prices and happy hours are either more expensive, or some really disgustingly cheap beer that nobody wants to drink anyways.  They need a gimmick, and a reason for people to go there."}
{"text":"First Thing.  I rated this 4 stars because I am comparing it to other restaurants that are similar (Teakwoods, Hooters, other bar/restaurants), I don't rate 4 stars because I am comparing it to a good steakhouse or Italian food place.  Apples to Apples, right?  So along with my husband and 4 other friends we visited for a quick bite to eat during the week.  None of us had ever been to this restaurant, here or any other location.  The place was really clean, and smelled like a restaurant, not like a bar (certainly not like pissy beer and puke like the previous bar that was here).  We were told to seat ourselves as the place was pretty empty.  The menu was pretty extensive, for bar food.  I actually had a hard time deciding.  For appetizers the table ordered a basket of fried pickles and a basket of fried jalapeno rings.  The fried jalapenos were awesome, probably the best thing I ate there.  The fried pickles were ok.  They were cut too thin in my opinion and lacked any sort of \"pickle flavor\".    For dinner I got that wing basket.  I ordered half honey BBQ and half medium buffalo.  The basket comes with fries.  The rest of the table ordered honey garlic wings, habenero mango?, nuclear, another mild buffalo basket, a Philly cheese-steak, and an order of steak nachos.  My order of wings were good.  The medium buffalo was good, but nothing stood out as fantastic or unique.  Wish they were a little crispier.  The honey BBQ tasted just like sloppy joe sauce was on them.  I'm not kidding, it was strange.  The person that ordered the Philly cheese-steak had to ask for a side of queso, no cheese was available besides provolone.  The woman that ordered the steak nachos said they were good, but asked if next time they could actually melt the cheese on the nachos.  I think everyone felt the same about the wings.  Good, but not great.  We will visit this place again and order something new next time and see how they do.  The service was good, fast, but they up charge for everything.  There is a reason they ask you if you want celery with your wings, not to cut back on waste, but to charge you $.69 for the celery!    In my opinion this place is far better, quicker, cleaner, and nicer than Teakwoods!!"}
{"text":"Good burgers and fries, cold drinks. Staff is very friendly, especially Princess at the bar  Lots of tvs with all the games. Not too loud or crowded."}
{"text":"Went there after a meeting in Fort Mill and sat on the patio. It was busy but the service was great. we had some beers. They have a decent selection on tap. We ordered the appitizer sampler which was great but fried food usually is. ;)"}
{"text":"The food is not very good, both times our meal was served cold. Not overly friendly staff either."}
{"text":"I would go back if they had better drink specials! I didn't think too highly of this place. I'd rather go to Great Eagle Bar & Grill in Surprise then here! Way cheaper beer."}
{"text":"I SO want to love this place as I absolutely love the food in other locations.  However, after 2 visits I'm still torn...The pulled pork sliders are very good, but I've been disappointed by the fried pickle appetizer and fish tacos.  The pickles were breaded in a super salty batter that actually masked any identifiable pickle flavor.  The fish tacos were also breaded in a similar strong batter, that was a bit overwhelming considering the surface area of the skinny fish fingers on the taco.  That said, the Freestyle sodas here are amazing, and the staff is super friendly.  I will be back in a few months to allow time for the menu & kitchen to iron out the kinks that are inevitable in a new establishment."}
{"text":"No. Just no. I can't remember the last time I thought food at a restaurant was disgusting. This food isn't even \"ok\" - it was TERRIBLE. I don't mind chain restaurant food, the occasional unhealthy restaurant, but it the taste has to be worth it!!  Buffalo chicken sandwich was horrible, on a stale bun. Taco quesidilla type of burger tasted like a frozen patty covered in an obscene amount of cheese. The fries were probably fried in 5 week old oil and had a strange taste. No seasoning.   Should have known better than to try the \"beignets\" for dessert. Ugh. Gross  I wouldn't eat here for free."}
{"text":"This place is Amazing the owners are great the food is Amazing cold beer and all family oriented a matter of fact I'm watching football and eatting with one of the owners and his daughter doesn't get better than that"}
{"text":"Umm, it's mostly just meh. We went here on a Tuesday night for their free kids meal night (per adult entree), and it was a super mediocre experience. First off, the service was soooooooo slow. It looked busy outside but def not inside. Seemed like it took 15 mins just to get our waters and 2 lil Sprites. And then the food took even longer. We only got 2 kids' meals and 2 wings entrees. Nothing I would think would be crazy hard. Anyway, I had glanced up within our 30-40 min wait for food--and there were 3 employees standing around chatting and doing nothing. I could see at least 2-3 waitresses working the inside section, but it was hard to tell where they went after visiting tables.   Our food finally came out, and it was cold. Like it had been made at least 10 mins prior and was sitting around for some reason. The only thing that was \"hot\" were my onion rings. Even my wings were cold. They tasted ok, not as hot as what I hoped for Buffalo sauce. The general texture was not my favorite though. I always expect a bit of crispiness to the skin, and the chicken skin on these wings were a lil too soft--as in maybe they were boiled and then dipped in sauce??? I ate them cuz I was ravenous by the time they came out, but I will never eat the wings here ever again. I can get way better wings for a better price somewhere else (like DD Peckers).   Overall, service was extremely slow. Food was cold and not that great. A bit pricey even with free kids meals, around $40 with 2 entrees and 1 beer + tip. Next time, I think we're gonna hit up McAlisters next door where we know what we're gonna get--faster service with a lil bit better food and not the higher prices."}
{"text":"My husband and I went there for lunch today, we both ordered the shareable appetizers and a order of wings. I had the chicken fingers, mozzarella sticks and onion rings, my husband had the ribs and chicken finger basket. I thought the ribs were decent my husband didn't cAre for them, he said they did not taste grilled. He felt the chicken fingers were ok.  I did not care for my meal, mozzarella sticks were ok, didn't eat much of my chicken fingers or the onion rings.  We ordered the Parmesan garlic wings and blackened wings, they came out both tasting the same, no seasoning except a hint of garlic on the par/gar wings.   Our waitress Erica was very nice, she took notice that we did not eat a lot of our food and when offered to go boxes we declined.  The owner happend to be there, he came over and inquired about our meal, we told him we were not satisfied.  Usually in situations where a customer has not ate majority of their meal the manager or owner will give you a discount, not this place he gave us a 10% off coupon for the next time (which there will not be) we visit. He was very nice about it, I did expect more than a coupon .  Needless to say we will not be returning. BTW, we had the sangria and it was not good either ."}
{"text":"This place has 3 stars for a reason. It is absolutely disgusting!! Do NOT waste your money at this place. I have never been to a restaurant as horrible as this one. And don't try to speak with management, what a joke"}
{"text":"I've had a good meal here, and a not so good meal here.   The good- $5.99 burger night. Not only was it a good deal, but the food was awesome. I'd certainly come back for the burger. I picked toppings and it was like a higher quality Big Mac. Walked away full and happy.  The bad- \"The Big Catch\"- I got it blackened, and I really wish I would have gotten it fried. I was trying to eat healthier, but looking at the calories, it was still pretty high even for a basic filet of fish. I'm sure they use plenty of butter, but it really didn't have much flavor. Tasted about the same as when I make it home, which isn't great. That's why I try and get fish when I go to restaurants. Let the professionals handle it, right?   I think you need to stick to ordering what they're better at: pub food. My fault for ordering a fish entree when I should have known it was probably going to be similar to something that was microwaved. Go with a burger, Reuben, ribs, etc.  All in all, it's adequate. About what you expect from a chain. Nothing wrong with the service or the building. I'd go back for the specials, but otherwise there are so many better private small businesses you can spend the same amount of money at."}
{"text":"Nothing about this place makes me want to come back.  The margarita was described as amazing and fresh, but was so bad my wife who loves margaritas took a sip and couldn't finish it.  It was advertised as all natural and from scratch but the bar tender even said it's just a mix. It was just so sweet and not good. Service was very slow and took forever to even pay. Try another bar nearby."}
{"text":"Not sure what was going on at Beef's on Father's Day (Dad's eat free). We decided to go for a late lunch (1:30pm) rather than dinner. We waited 20 minutes to be seated while several empty tables needed bussed. Many times employees walked by the tables, but no bussing.  When we finally were seated, it took well over 10 minutes for our drinks to get to our table. We placed our order when the drinks arrived, since we had amble time to decide while waiting. The waitress warned us that the kitchen was behind and she couldn't even ring the order in yet, so it would be a while. Then we didn't see her for a while. I don't mean she was waiting other tables, I mean we didn't see her at all. We spent over 2 hours at this restaurant Sunday afternoon. Not in my plans for Father's Day. Not to mention that the AC wasn't working well, so the restaurant was uncomfortably warm."}
{"text":"This was so bad... I ran in to the house to write this review! We went to the restaurant because of a promotion they were running for the High School .... NEVER AGAIN!  I ordered the wings, which were okay. Not great. My wife ordered the burger, well done... it came to the table red. My other daughter ordered wings with Pub Chips. The wings were okay, but the pub chips were soggy and underdone.  We would have pointed this out to the waitress... HAD WE SEEN HER! She came by a couple of times and I tried to get her attention, but she obviously was not terribly interested in checking on us. No drink refills... no checking with us. My wife asked to have the Burger removed from the check when we finally did catch her, since we were all done eating. She was less than personable after we requested the burger be removed.  I can only assume that the people in this very trendy neighborhood simply don't want to leave the neighborhood to eat... I can't believe they are going to have a long term future given the food and service."}
{"text":"Do not eat at this place if you are looking for Irish food.  This place was not at all  what you would think from the name.  My husbands food was good mine was cold.  Sent it back and than they brought it back like a minute later all microwaved for me..... how sweet.  Waitress was new and clueless.  Told management and they seemed to careless.  Will not go back!!!"}
{"text":"Eh, this place is ok! I've never eaten here, but our office has gotten several to go orders from here. Each time they were not that great. I tried a wrap here and it wasn't that great. It was soggy which I know sometimes a to go order can do that but the person picking up the food was actually waiting on the to go order and we don't work far at all from this location. My coworker got the burger from here and she said the fries were soggy. This place is just ok for me."}
{"text":"Went here tonight for dinner, first thing I noticed right off the bat was the smell when I walked in, couldn't pin point it but didn't like it either . We were seated promptly , after that an waitress showed up and began to take our drink order we the hostess blurted out \"no\" meaning we were not her table however she took order..   Another waitress showed up to bring drinks and yet a 3 rd on brought our food.. I got fish and chips which was just ok, pieces are pretty small for almost 9 bucks.. Batter was really good but the tarter sauce I could have lived without, had a strange taste...  Daughter had the chicken wrap and seemed to enjoy it, I did taste it and it wasn't bad..I will go back to try other items to see if it gets better... Hopefully the smell will go away by then.."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped by the other day for lunch. The restaurant was clean and nicely decorated. The staff was friendly but not very knowledgeable of the menu. My wife ordered the Fish Tacos and was very disappointed. It came on flour tortillas with no option for corn tortillas (the only way to make authentic fish tacos). The fish was bland and did not have a crunchy or crisp coating. When she ordered she specifically asked for extra crispy. She even asked the server to take it back to the kitchen to make it crispier but the server returned telling her the cook refused and said that's as crispy as it's gonna get. I ordered the Chicken Philly which was OK. The chicken was kind of bland and the Hoagie Roll was cold. It would have been nice if it was warmed and toasted. Hopefully they will improve their cooking methods but chances are we won't be going back any time soon."}
{"text":"Ugh. Nothing about our experience two weeks ago was good. The restaurant was cold. Food gross. Service blah."}
{"text":"First time here and it was just what we needed after a long day at the moto track - cold beer, football and kid friendly options!  I opted for the Cuban and it was a huge - not typical for most Cubans. Wish I lived on this side of town so I could be a regular!"}
{"text":"I was hoping for a little more from a place could capitalize on the fact that BBW just went out of business.  The restaurant was very small and the only background noise was coming from the bar TV's no music in the dining area at all.  I got the fish and chips based on the server's obvious excitement when I asked about them but when it came out, about 20 minutes later the three pieces were sitting on the \"chips\" (fries) so they were extremely soggy and grease filled.  When I brought it to the attention of the server her remark was \"yeah, that happens.\"   I must have looked dumb founded because I wasn't sure how to respond so she just walked away.  I won't be back.  Go to the Irish Wolfhound, you'll be happier."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place since its so nearby and has a respectable beer selection....  The space has a great patio and a snazzy interior, along with the aforementioned draft lineup. And that's pretty much where the positive portion of this review ends.  My biggest issue is with the crowd this place attracts. For example, I heard  loud banter between a bar patron and the bartender about wine:  Bartender to server: \"Here's the wine for table 3\" Customer to bartender: \"Who drinks wine anyway, queers?\"  While I'm not gay, I do respect people's choice of sexual orientation. Plus, what a stupid thing to say hahahha! Everyone knows only gays drink Bud Lite. All joking aside, I find it FUCKING ABSURD that there is anyone inside Chandler city limits who would say such a thing in public.  The rest of my visit was spent uncomfortably trying to ignore the babbling of said idiot.  Follow on visits have put me in similar situations, where I am consistently surrounded by people who are on the verge of being too drunk and borderline, if not absolutely, obnoxious.  The food looks like typical American chain swag, although I've never tried.  I see this place slowly devolving into a shithole dive bar and I don't mean in like a hipster way. Perhaps it can be the go to joint for white supremacists softball teams after a game.    Maybe that corner is cursed??? Won't be returning."}
{"text":"My first time here and took the server's recommendation of the lemon pepper fillet and glad I did.  Very good!"}
{"text":"Much like BWW or Wolfhound. Food was good, lots of TV's, good quick stop in for dinner then a movie."}
{"text":"We frequented the location in Palm Coast Florida which was good but often had clunky execution. This location is AWESOME! The service was great, our server fantastic, and the food was delicious."}
{"text":"We ordered the appetizer sampler- chicken fingers were over fried so the breading tasted burnt, the mozzarella sticks and onion rings however were amazing. Burgers were the main course and they were extremely bland and disappointing. Fries were really tasty tho. Also I ordered a sangria-Rita and not only was it good but the bartender brought me the extra margarita too! Would go back again but definitely will not order burgers!"}
{"text":"Beef O'Brady's is a franchise hailing from Florida that is basically a sports bar with a full menu (pizza, burgers, wings, BBQ, etc.) however is more \"kid friendly\".  Overall a great concept to come to the Ultra Star Cinema/new bowling alley complex on Waddell & Litchfield.  TVs everywhere, employees dressed in referee jerseys, and all the typical sports bar type tchotchkes on the wall.  They even have an area for kids that has XBox consoles setup with NHL 2012 and other sports oriented video games to play.      The beer was cold, and the service was great, but my \"beef' (pun intended) was that the food was below average.  At the time of our visit they had been open less than a week, so I'm not going to be overly critical, but there are definitely some kinks to work out.  The management didn't appear to be overly engaged, and the cook staff seemed really confused and the kitchen was incredibly slow considering how few people were in there.  The wings I had were average - somewhat overcooked and not enough sauce (and certainly not spicy enough).  Fries were good.    I'm sure they'll get their restaurant off the ground, but for management - I would have expected you to be more proactive, touching tables, asking for feedback - I'm not sure whether this was a \"soft opening\" but regardless you need to be chatting it up with customers and really ensuring things are running smoothly.  My rating is weighted high considering the newness of the operation and I look forward to your improvement.  Let's just hope that's sooner rather than later - there is plenty of competition in the area."}
{"text":"This hurts me to do this, as a family member and the owner are friends. But...  This location is terrible. Bad service, questionable food. I tried this one twice just to make sure the first time wasn't a fluke.  Funny thing is their Brimfield location kinda rocks. The Stow, not so much."}
{"text":"Horrible. My family and I call it Beef O' Pukeys. Food is absolutely wretched. The service is sub-par. I'd rather go to Applebee's if I was in that area and I'm not a fan of Applebee's either. It just happens to be less awful than Pukeys."}
{"text":"Lunch on a Wednesday was very mediocre. The Service was the problem. There were only 2 customers in the restaurant when we arrived and despite this, the service was very poor.  As the name might suggest, the menu boasts nothing for the Vegetarian. Even though it was not on the menu, I asked for a Grilled Cheese. They agreed to make it on Rye bread with tomato. I ordered Fresh broccoli as the side. I loved this option, instead of fries. I was looking forward to a good lunch. The food arrived cold, after a good 25 minute wait. The server forgot the broccoli and when she finally served it, it had nothing on it. After a closer glimpse, I noticed that the \"fresh\" vegetable was actually frozen cuts of broccoli in a small bowl, with no seasoning and no butter. No creativity here. Because the Server kept disappearing for long periods of time, I knew retrieving the check would be a challenge.After a 15 minute wait, we had to stand up to get the check. We will not go back."}
{"text":"Best chicken tacos I've ever had!  A must have.  Molten lava cake the bomb.  Hats off to Brittany the bartender!  Great experience here."}
{"text":"We loved it. Typical bar fare with a few exceptions. The server gave me a drink based on my preferences, which is girly and sweet. It was citrusy and perfect. I ordered the Fish and Chips. It came with fries and I asked for a little coleslaw. The fish (cod) was battered and came out crispy and delicious. It  wasn't greasy and the fish had a pure white firm texture with a clean, fresh taste. I even got Baldie to try it and he doesn't do fish in a bar and he loved it! Kept stealing a bite. I got the curly fries with it and thank God they didnt season them with salty house seasoning bullshit. They were crispy and delicious. I didn't like the cole slaw. Baldie ate his and mine . He also had the suggested Cuban. Wrong choice. Who puts lettuce and tomato on a Cuban? It wasn't as great as server claimed. I told him to stick with something beefy, like roast beef or steak tacos. It was good, just not as expected. Overall, food was pretty good, like bar food should be, nothing spectacular, but good. We'll be back to try other stuff, tho."}
{"text":"Service was fine, no issues others had with wait times, but the food was really not that impressive. Upcharge $1 for a little 2oz scoop of guacamole is absolutely nuts.  The flavored water shots are kind of a cool feature, but not enough to make me want to come back."}
{"text":"I'm not certain what the other dishes at this restaurant are like, but I found something for which I've been on a quest for some time.  Yeah, it's a chain and yeah the name is unimaginative at best, but they have a salad that has a griilled whitefish filet on top featured on their luncheon menu!  Why is this impossible to find elsewhere?  Salad is good for you, but not very filling.  Fish is good for you, but it's almost always deep fried and made to be worse for you than a Big-Mac!  They will pan sear it or blacken it or one of two additional options and it's reasonably priced!!!  It was a very nice sized piece of fish, not overcooked, although a bit over-seasoned!  The salad it sat on was a generous in size and a bit umimaginative like the name of the place, (cukes are 3/$1 this time of year, spring for one or two Mr O'Brady) consisting exclusively of lettuce one or two slices of tomato and a bit of red onion, nary a crouton, romaine leaf or other salad accoutrement was to be found anywhere.  Hey if Subway can put pepper rings and green pepper and black olives and jalapenos on my sandwich for $5, offer me the same on my $10 salad, yaknowahadImean?  And ONE light dressing option should be offered if you're selling salads, hey some of us actually know how many calories are in a half cup of bleu cheese dressing, (a billion), yes children, A BILLION!  So the next time you feel good about yourself when you order a salad and the bleu cheese dressing is dripping from  the corner of your mouth onto your plus-sized blouse, lose the holier-than-thou attitude beyatch, 'cause your're only fooling the illiterate and the stupid, and after all they fool themselves all the time, so no prize there, Bonzo! In a nutshell Great salad but it could use a bit of window dressing. Like the place will return."}
{"text":"Typically out of multiple beer selections and the food is average. It could use some updates on the sports bar front (i.e. bigger bar, wider beer selection, updated decor, etc.) and its children's arcade area is unnecessary."}
{"text":"Overall not good. Run of the mill bar food that's half good if & when they change the fryer grease. Unfortunately that is not often enough. The service is mostly teenagers that have little if any clue what the value of good service is. Most have a false sense of entitlement around here. I hate to say it, but If it wasn't for the live entertainment on the weekends & multi tv coverage for sports this place should just give up."}
{"text":"We have eaten here four times in last few months never had a wait of more than five minutes contrary to other posts. The wait staff have always been responsive and attentive. Wraps are good, the Reuben prepared as it should and burgers medium as required by stupid stupid state laws. Their curly fries are outstanding, so much so that they are the only fries I can eat without ketchup. I do recommend Beef o' Brady."}
{"text":"Well, I ate here and I didn't die... I can't say the same for my taste buds...  Look, I'm going to keep it short and just say this: I've eaten here two times and both times, I have been disappointed... So has everyone else in my party...  The service was really spotty... Sometimes, the server would be all over us, but it took like 20 minutes to get the check and we didn't see her at all that whole time...   Anyway, the food... I got the chicken tenders and ribs app with fries and it was all meh... The ribs themselves were of a questionable quality to me, but the boyfriend tolerated them...  The tenders tasted mostly like breading...  The next time, I tried a salad with a cup of soup... The salad managed to be bland, even with dressing... I don't know what happened... The soup tasted like Spaghettio's without the pasta... Just thick and really sweet...  They have trivia on Tuesday nights, which is pretty fun, so give them a shot... It's a good time... Just eat dinner before you go... Please."}
{"text":"My family and I enjoy this place.  The environment is very nice.  It is comfortable,  friendly, and very welcoming of children.  When we went,  management had walked around (several times)  and checked in with guests.   The waitresses we have had did seem somewhat new at it but are very friendly.   The food is not top of the line but it isn't like we went there thinking we would get that.  I like that their menu offers a nice variety of foods to choose from.   My family and I plan to return to this location,  which is conveniently located!"}
{"text":"Went for the fish and chips and fried shrimp. Awful- literally tasted like the frozen fish entrees we could buy from Harris Teeter."}
{"text":"Been here twice. Prompt service and great food each experience!  Love the patio when the weather is cooler!"}
{"text":"Bad vibe, disgusting regulars with no manners. The only Irish beer they had was Guinness. Will never recommend or go back."}
{"text":"I took my sister here after just picking her up at Sky Harbor from Seattle. I had seen this place off of Kyrene and I looked it up online, seemed legit. We needed a place to watch the Phi vs. Ari game anyway.   On the inside, the place looks like a sports bar that opted for nicer booth tables. It appears small first walking in but ends up stretching back in two directions, adding more space to sit. From what I gathered, Beef's is a Florida chain that ended up in AZ. I could tell by the Devil Rays and Bucs swag - nothing over the top, just representing.   The menu has many options and the choices overall are a step up in recipe and quality from your typical bar food. Angus beef is found all over the menu. The happy hour is M-F and this was a Sunday. Using Yelp, I was able to check in and get a free Coke on top of the beers we ordered. I added a couple shots of Whiskey to the order because I know businesses have a bottom line too.   My sister and I both ordered the OMG pretzel bun sliders which were fine. The Angus beef tasted very good and the pretzel buns were OK. The fries were straight-cut and not over salted or greasy. The server was friendly and earned a good tip. Who I presume was the owner checked on us often and offered to change the closest TVs to whatever game(s) we wanted.   My only \"Beef\" would be that the place could be a little more cleanly, meaning there were a few tables inside/outside that were needing to be cleared off. I'll give them that I believe they were busy cleaning, what I presume to be, a drunk's mess. Despite that small item (it happens, it's a bar on game day) I could see myself going back to catch a game in the future."}
{"text":"\"EVICTED\"   Yes, sorry to say, Beef O'Bradys at 6045 W. Chandler Blvd., Chandler, AZ (SW Corner Chandler Blvd. and Kyrene Rd.) was \"EVICTED\" as of March 27, 2015 Signs are posted on the doors.  The Franchisee was : Andrew Yontz. There are no more Beef O'Bradys in Arizona at this writing."}
{"text":"I like to try a place out before reading reviews, just so I can give an unbiased opinion.  LISTEN TO ALL OF THESE REVIEWS!!!!  This place could easily be negative stars.  I gave them 3 because I actually had a great waitress (young and new, but great) and the food was correctly cooked, tasted good and had a pleasant atmosphere.    It's a pub with regular pub food.  Nothing special, normal American fair.  I ordered a buffalo chicken sandwich with fries.  Cooked to perfection.  Chicken was done and juicy.  Fries hot and fresh with no salt like I ordered.  My drink was refilled before I hit bottom.  Hubby and I stopped in on a Saturday afternoon and they were empty with the exception of a few gentlemen at the bar and an elderly couple behind us. The couple had an expired coupon and the manager took it off their bill anyways and all was pleasant.  TVs everywhere but little else in decorations.  It really is hit or miss.  I don't know if i'll go back, but I can't complain about our service this trip."}
{"text":"Pretty good place. The food was tasty, if not slightly bland (but hey, when you go to a place that serves a lot of beer, you should never expect their food to be huge on taste). I'd suggest you aim for food that tastes better when bland (like the Dubliner) to make sure you're not disappointed in your order. I've heard from a few nearby customers at how ridiculous their extra charges are... thankfully, we never ordered any extras.  Oddly enough, we experienced none of the service problems others had. We were seated quickly, we were tended to quickly, and our server was very attentive and felt genuine in her friendliness. I suppose it really depends on the time of day on what kind of service you'd get. We came around an odd time, slightly before sundown.  One thing you have to know though: It is rather noisy in here. Even when there's a not too many people in here, the overall mood of the place is just loud.  All-in-all not a bad place. Not a MUST-GO-TO kind of place, but not entirely disappointing if gone to. Just don't plan an evening of coming here, or you'd definitely end up disappointed. 3 stars for the food and service! An extra star to our extremely welcoming waitress~!"}
{"text":"This was my second time trying the restaurant and unfortunately will be my last. From the moment I sat down the venue seems dark and dingy like an outdated sports bar (this bar would be a great candidate for the shoe Bar Rescue), with the smell of spilt beer from the night before resonating from the carpet. Today is St. Patricks day yet they only had two servers/ bar tenders (had to make their own drinks/ run their own food/ refill drinks/ answer the phone/ take to go orders/ and cash people out), terrible management mistake for a busy holiday like SPD with a name like Beef 'O' Brady's. I ordered an Arnold Palmer and for got how bad it was the first time, and got the same rancid moldy flavored drink. I'm not sure if they don't clean the iced tea machine or if the lemonade is bad, but I can tell you anyone with a iced tea was not drinking it (as I witnessed many people with full glasses). All I wanted was some fresh corned beef on a ruben and got, thinly sliced lunch meet that had been grilled to a crisp and then put on greasy rye bread (dripping with grease). Since the Arnold Palmer was bad, I decided to opt for a beer (no Irish beers except for Guinness) so I ordered a Shiner Bock. The beer came out stale/ flat/ warmer than expected. I then returned that beer and opted for a bottled beer...   I was not happy with any of my experiences here, and will never return as this is not my cup of tea. Oh, and by the way it wasn't cheap as the quality of food would have you expect. My tab for a Ruben and Stella was $15 not including tip.   I feel bad for the overworked wait staff as they remained friendly throughout the whole time. If you have taste buds, like your money, and a good atmosphere to enjoy a lunch or dinner; this is not your spot.   Sorry guys, I wanted to like it but I couldn't.   Areas for improvement:  * Heighten the roof and brighten up the place * Get rid of the carpet * hire more staff  * lunch specials (drive in the businesses around you) * Higher quality ingratiates (you should have had fresh cooked thick corned beef on St. Patricks day) * Make sure your beer is being stored at the right temperature and test all your beers for freshness.  * Take pride in your business or you'll lose the opportunity to serve repeat customers."}
{"text":"Went to this place about a month ago. The place was not busy, the only server seemed to be working the bar also.  My order was taken quickly, food delivered quickly and it was hot. It seemed overly salty. I was never asked how my food tasted, my beverage sat empty while the server gave all her attention to the 3 people at the bar. Never was offered a refill. After this experience, I wouldn't go back.  I drove by last week and it looked closed - had a \"remodeling\" sign in the window.  Even if they re-open, I doubt that I'd go back."}
{"text":"Ft.Mill - I ate here for lunch and I was full for the rest of the day !!! The helpings was great and the taste of the food was good. I had the cheeseburger slider appetizer and loved it. The waitress we had was very knowledgeable and friendly at the same time.  Will be returning for a lighter plate :)"}
{"text":"I liked this place better when it was a Blockbuster video store. The couple of times I have visited this restaurant it wasn't busy and it's very clear why... this place SUCKS.   Let's start with the wings. The hottest wing sauce is surprisingly hot (which I like) but the wings tasted terrible. I've ordered wings from here three times and each time they had the wings ready in about 7-10 minutes, meaning they heat them up rather than deep frying them... the difference? Dried out wings!! If you're a fan of wings you know what I'm talking about. You're a sports pub and you can't make the wings right!  Second, the atmosphere. The bartenders are hit and miss... one day I had a nice woman serve me, she showed a personality and knew how to be a bartender. Although the last time I visited there the bartender was a different girl who never stood behind the bar for more than 30 seconds, never spoke to anyone and showed no personality. Now if you're going to be a sports bar then hire someone that makes you feel at home!   Third, the drinks. My mother visited this place with her friends and tried a specialty mix drink from their menu and she said, \"it was awful!!\".  Again, if you're going to be sports bar, learn to mix the drinks properly!  Finally, you may have noticed that I said that I've visited this place several times, so why did I keep coming back? Because I was hoping my previous experiences were a fluke. In fact I spaced out my visits to give them the benefit of the doubt. It still sucked. I wanted this place to succeed because it's close to home and in a great location but unfortunately it's a real disappointment.   If you're looking for a sports pub with good food, go down the road to The Tavern of Stow, or even Bellacino's. Go anywhere, just not here."}
{"text":"Ugh. Dirty menus and silverware,  cold food that should have been returned to the general direction of the microwave from whence it came, and very questionable fish. Fish, my friends,  cannot be questionable."}
{"text":"I liked the food here and the atmosphere is great. It doesn't even feel like Broadview Heights. None of the ugly Tollis Parkway hillbilly vibe that festers when the weather gets warm like a trailer park urinal sluicing down into a fetid backwoods Arkansas spillway. The fries are great.   I ordered one of their specialty burgers that had onion rings on it which I never understand, so I removed them, ate them and then worked the perimeter of the burger to avoid the condiment/add-on displacement that can cause frustration and, frankly, despair. The burger was disturbingly round and didn't have that look of a fresh-made beef patty but it worked anyway. It did not fill me up but there was plenty going on around it to make the meal complete.  I drank the beer lustily and was rewarded with fresh, cold cheap replacements throughout the experience.   I got mayo in a little plastic tub and gouged my fries into it not unlike a condemned Belgian prisoner. I was careful to only do this when no one was looking as I have received looks of disgust from strangers not attuned to the luxurious delight of spooning mayonnaise into one's mouth with a French fry. Damn them and their judging ways. Damn them all.   There was a pickle. It seemed a bit overplayed as if a man at an earlier seating had used it as a gesticulation prop. Wait. Perhaps I have misinterpreted the pickle and its place on a plate. Maybe the pickle is just another form of garnish that moves from plate to plate throughout the evening and is not intended for consumption. Like the fat man who eats the kale from beneath the potato salad, maybe I have just not come to terms with the concept of food as visual aid. I do not mean to say the pickle I received was dug out of someone else's refuse and I hope you will not be deterred by my esoteric considerations. It was just a little rubbery. Perhaps there was no pickle at all. Does this change your view of the restaurant? I doubt it. What does it mean to actually be a pickle anyway? Let's move on.  I had wings before my burger and they lit up like a dried-out faux Cuban cigar purchased at a gas station in Ontario. Hot wings should be crispy and full of chicken taste and still be hot enough to corrupt your system all the way to that last intestinal turn. These wings were that and more. I couldn't talk about how miserable these wings made me feel as I ate them but I loved everything about them. If you get the 'nuclear' flavored wings, get the blue cheese dressing even if you don't like it. In Broadview Heights' terms, it's like peeing on a fire out behind the soccer fields off of Lazarro Road. It might be gross but the alternative is a conflagration that you can't handle.  This place was clean and awesome and did everything they said they'd do. Beer, wings, rings, fries, burger; all good."}
{"text":"My wife and I really enjoy dining at Beef O'Brady's in Iowa and were super excited to learn there was one in Surprise.  We went to the Surprise location the same day we discovered that it was open.  The location seems perfect for this type of restaurant.  Unfortunately our visit to the Beef O'Brady's in Surprise was a sad disappointment.  Both meals that were ordered included the beef.  It was not only clearly evident that frozen patties were used, but there was also the taste of freezer burn and staleness.  In other words the patty melt and hamburger we had pretty much sucked.  I can't really say anything to incredibly positive about the french fries and ranch dressing.  The chances of returning to the Beef O'Brady's in Surprise is pretty low, but we will still be looking forward to dining in the one in Iowa.  There can never be a substitution for genuine, fresh mid-western beef : - )"}
{"text":"Been going here for years. Go-to spot for a quick bite. Well, they have a new server who was so friggin rude, it kinda turned us off on ever returning. I have a paralyzed vocal cord so she had difficulty understanding me and was actually kinda ticked. Hubby stepped in and ordered. She brought out our baskets, literally slid them across the table and that was that. She disappeared. Never saw here again. Never asked was everything okay. Never asked if we wanted another beer. Or dessert. Noth-ing! Didn't see her again till she \"dropped\" the check on the table and walked away. WOW. If you don't like dealing with the public, or especially can't deal with people with disabilities, find a different profession!!!"}
{"text":"I love their chicken wraps and the home made pub chips! They are SOOO good! I haven't tried anything else yet but I will be coming back"}
