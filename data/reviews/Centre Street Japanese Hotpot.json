{"text":"This place is a ripoff!!  Be aware! Last Sunday after church our family (my wife and3 kids) were having lunch at the restaurant my wife double checked their special before we order, we ordered 3 special and a large hot pot so she can share with my son. At end when the bill comes we were charged each $15.99+ $4.00 for the drink times 3 orders, the owner refused to give us the special because she didn't key in the special and she didn't want to change, my wife didn't want to argue she just paid the overcharged bill, but this is the last time  for my family and all of my friends there!!!"}
{"text":"Good food and quantity for the price.
Quick and friendly service 
Really love the drinks here!!"}
{"text":"There has been a change in ownership recently. This place used to be awesome with a very friendly owner and waitress but under new ownership quality, quantity and service declined. 

To start off, the delicious free tea is now gone and replaced with water and a watered down excuse for black tea.

The portion sizes have decreased greatly. What used to be 1 whole meatball or fish ball is now cut into halves. 

The new server is almost nowhere to be seen, and did not top up my soup base until I was almost done my meal... only stopped by our table once.

I used to come here a few times a month. I will look else where to satisfy my hot pot cravings now...."}
{"text":"Been here for a couple of times and the service is really awesome. I love the food and the wintermelon milk tea is my favourite drink here. Will definitely coming back"}
{"text":"Great hotpot with a variety of flavors.  Service for lunch was great and timely.   Food is authentic and instantly became my wife's new favorite restaurant, reminded her of home in Asia."}
{"text":"For the longest time, I resisted hot pot. Why? Because I didn't understand the appeal of having to pay AND cooking your own food.

Buuuuuuut, I got over that real quick once a good friend of mine recommended this place. 

I've actually been here a couple times - once for a late lunch and another for dinner, both times it was pretty busy.

The menu can be a bit overwhelming, there are so many options (both food and bevvies) For a small hot pot ($15.99), you get a choice of broth, meat and noodles. (Or for an additional $3 you can add any drink to make it a combo)

It's kinda fun to have your own heating station for your various meat, seafood, veggies and noodles. And everything cooks up relatively quickly too! 

The best thing is that if you go with other people, you can all get different combos for your hot pot and try all the options!

Parking at this complex is really limited though, so probably best to go at an off time?"}
{"text":"Nice little place for personal hotpot! They have a really good lunch special where $13 can get you a bubble tea, a plate of veggies and assorted hotpot items, a plate of meat of your choice, and rice! 

Some items included were fish balls and other hotpot meatballs, imitation crab, napa cabbage, taro/potato, shrimp, enoki mushroom, those vermicelli bundle things, spam, radish, wintermelon, etc! 

There a little knob on the side of the table where you can control the heat which I liked. The sauce table had a huge variety. 

Overall, had a good experience! I love leaving the napa cabbage, wintermelon and radish boiling until the end so it soaks up all the flavour of the broth :) 

Verdict:
4/5 - service
4/5 - food 
3.5/5 - atmosphere 
Would I return: yes!"}
{"text":"This is a good place to go if you're looking for a meal that will surely fill you up. They are open late and you can get their $15.99 hot pot and drink special if you are there at lunch time or past 9pm. The quality of food isn't the greatest but a satisfying meal is easily obtainable. You might want to order extra side plates of meat as the small comes with 1 plate and the large comes with 2 plates. Each plate of meat has approximately 4-5 slices"}
{"text":"I decided to check this place out a couple days ago, I had wanted something hot and yummy. For lunch they have lunch deals that was really a good deal. For like $12 you get your own personal hot pot cooking in front of you in one of there many broth choices and you can pick one meat and the pot is already filled with yam, taro, carrot, potato, shrimp and many other items. As for hot pot goes it was just OK. They had no Shabu Shabu nor was it very memorable. I ordered the Stay broth and the broth was lacking in flavour, however they do have a sauce station and you can combine all these ingredients to make your own concoction, with the sauce the hot pot was then more flavorful and it was good. For the $12 set lunch you also get unlimited cold Assam tea and also they throw in a drink of your choice, slushes, bubble tea, sugar cane juice etc. So for the value it was really a great deal. Would I come back here again?? Mmmm, maybe if I had no other choices or trying to budget lunch."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a decent hot pot with lots of different flavours then this is the spot. There was an assortment of soups and sauce combination that you can pick from. It was definitely filling and it was really nice to have your own pot.  With this place, you get to pick your soup, meat (beef, lamb, chicken and pork) and grains (rice, rice with meat sauce +$0.50, glass noodles, udon, ramen and instant noodles).  Each order came with a variety of vegetables (napa cabbage, enoki mushrooms, a slice of tomato, lotus root, yam, potato and taro, and a lettuce.  You also get a prawn, fish ball, pork ball, imitation crab, fried wonton, and fried and regular tofu. The small was definitely filling, however if you have a bigger appetite then go for the large.  With the large you can have two different types of meat which will give you more variety."}
{"text":"Every time I go here and order milk tea it just gets better and better, staff is very nice too! I have my regular server, name is Puck I believe, very accommodating."}
{"text":"Definitely the go to for hot pot. Good service and food is always delicious. It's not all you can eat, but the portion they have you is more than enough to fill your tummy"}
{"text":"Best thing to eat on a cold day is hotpot with my hot date..lol. It's a small shop in a strip mall hidden in the corner. There not much parking. 

The service was great. The staff was attentive and friendly; which is rare at an Asian restaurant. We ordered two types of broth (extra $2 a person but worth it). One order small and one big order. Total price was $40 for the both of us. 

The portions are fair for the price. They give you a mix of veggies, a noodle and a mix of random stuff like tofu, fish ball, shrimp, etc. Overall it was a good meal at a fair price. 

PS they have a large selection of bubble tea and dessert house type snacks."}
{"text":"This used to be my favourite hot pot in Calgary. I came here recently and noticed a lot has changed. They used to provide delicious cold tea for free! Now it is replaced with water and a tasteless black tea. The portions have seemed to be a bit smaller. The small hot pot combo used to come with spam and shrimp, but it was not provided for me. There was also less vegetables. The pork bone broth was my favourite, so sweet and savoury. Now it is pretty bland. The tom yum broth however, was great. 

This place has potential, but with the new changes I do not see it lasting much longer. There are other places in Calgary to get sub-par broth and far bigger portion of meat and veggies. I think I will stick to 1pot for now."}
{"text":"The worst experience ever! Went there for a few time, their food quality goes from good to poor.  The waitress has a huge attitude!  We are wondering why there's a minimum expense requirement for each consumer and the response was \"u should blame the people who came during special hour, shares one hotpot and sits forever\"! 
Speaking with another girl about that unprofessional respond, she tries to explain about the rule, however, ignores the major reason of why I'm complaining, \"unprofessional response of the first waitress which leads to an unpleasant dining experience\", ask us about how the food taste.  Seems she asked, so we told them honestly that the food quality has dropped, the meat sauce is more salty and the drinks are not up to standard.  After awhile the cook came out and ask us what's wrong with the food.  My friend told him the same thing, he ask us, do you know what the ingredients are? Do you even know how to cook?  
My friend gets upset, she said, you are the one who ask how the food taste, we simply respond to the question with our true thought why do you get angry.  The cook said, I'm no angry, am I angry? I am smiling, didn't u see the smile on my face? and I would like to know that if you have ever cook before? 
I don't see how this is a professional response at all!  
They are looking for excuses on their poor customer service, downgraded food quality and the worst of all, the new cook acts as if he owns the restaurant, which we find out that he is a new hire who claims to have 8 years of cooking experience!  
I then request him to leave as we do not wish to speak with him anymore.  We don't want to stay there anymore so we get up and make our way to the register to pay.  The cook run out to the register counter when we are paying, just to yell at us to never go back again! 
The reason we complain is because we are not happy with how we get treated by the waitress and as a paying customer, And the situation got worse because we complained.  I don't expect to be eating downgraded food yet being treated like we are an uneducated bunch. I don't expect to be treated like a VIP for a $18.99 meal, but at the same time, there's the basic line on customer service! If you can't accept pointers then don't ask! 
Worst experience, a nightmare! Will never visit this restaurant ever again."}
{"text":"I would rate this place a 3.5 if Yelp allowed half stars! 

I visited here on a Wednesday night and was surprised at how busy it got. It looks like it mostly caters to asians which makes sense I guess.

The parking lot for this little strip mall is tiny and looks like an accident waiting to happen. There are streets around the area that I would park at next time and walk a little as the parking lot was a gong show (cars parking horizontally parking behind parking spots and blocking everyone in, etc.). 

The restaurant itself looks like a hole in a wall in the corner but the inside is much cleaner and spacious than the exterior. Each table has a little hot plate for the individual hot pots.

Our server was really awesome and I felt so bad that she was serving the entire restaurant by herself. One more person started working closer to 6 or 7pm but they were both running around trying to run the food and make drinks. I think if they are constantly this busy, they should definitely hire someone to make all the drinks and run the food. 

She explained that the only difference in the large and small hot pots were the amount of meat and veggies you get - the broth is the same amount for both. You get two plates of meat in the large and one plate for the small. You get to pick what kind of meat you want (beef, pork, chicken, lamb) and what type of side you want (rice, udon, glass noodles, etc.). 

Everything was brought out really nicely and there was a good variety of stuff. There's also the usual sauces you see at hotpot but I didn't see anything particularly special. Soy sauce, garlic, green onions, oyster sauce, etc..

The meat and veggies were fine and I guess the most important thing for hot pot is the broth, which they did have a lot of variety to choose from. We had the pork broth and the sukiyaki, and both were okay but nothing amazing. I thought the sukiyaki was a bit salty and the pork broth didn't have much flavour, it was almost bland. 

Overall, I think I would visit this place again but only during their lunch special hours where it's cheaper for the hot pot and drink combo. They have happy hour too, from 9 until 11pm I think. Nothing was bad but I also didn't think anything stood out very much other than our service which was great."}
{"text":"We came here during lunch around 1 30. My positives about this place is how the lunch menu was set up - a small medley of veggies,  meats,  and seafood was included in the pot.  You are able to choose what broth you would like and what meat (choice of beef,  pork,  lamb or chicken and comes out in a small plate). As well it came with a drink! 

My small complaint is ...  They say it's a Japanese hot pot  but it's almost like a Chinese hot pot with the dippings."}
{"text":"We went on a Friday afternoon. The store was hard to find since it is tucked in a corner. Inside looks clean-ish. The condiment table has a good selection. However, the cilantro was dry looking. The sesame paste was quite watery, although pungent. I had to ask many times before it was refilled. 

Overall, food was fresh and decent for the price. However, the quantity was on the low side. My lamb came on a neat black square tray. There were roughly 5 thin slices. There was 1 small slice of tofu, a square fried tofu, a 5cm long ish Chinese donut, a piece of imitation crab, a fishball, half a pork ball, a small bunch of enoki, choice of noodle, some cabbage... good variety but so limited in quantity it looked quite sad. I did not like the small piece of spam in my soup. And the Sichuan mild spicy soup was actually quite spicy for us. Although the chicken cooked in the spicy soup came out delicious! An extra serving of meat would cost $2. Our server came back multiple times to refill the broth which was nice, especially for more inexperience or slower eaters. 

A nice bonus is the unlimited self-serve ice water and unsweetened black tea. Both are great and 100% necessary with hotpot. They also have bbt and Taiwanese fried chicken for order on the side. 

The store is quite small and can likely hold max 40-45 participant at each time. 

Overall, a neat place to visit. Have lots of potential and room for improvement. Will likely be back again."}
{"text":"Let's get the fact out of the way that Centre Street Japanese Hot Pot is NOT an AYCE restaurant. This place was recommended to me by my sister, who seems to know all the hole in the wall places to try these days. It's located in the All Best Plaza strip mall across the street from Lina's Italian Market and is tucked in the corner beside the Caribbean food store. The inside of the restaurant is modern, bright and clean. It's a small place, and it's owned by Chinese people but I've never had trouble getting a table. They do take reservations. 

Let's talk about the hot pot. You can choose between two options: the small ($13.99) meal or the large ($18.50) and cook it in your own individual pot. Both meals with a substantial amount of veggies such as Chinese cabbage, lettuce, enoki mushrooms, tomatoes, taro, sweet potato, daikon, etc. The small comes with one choice of meat and the large comes with two choices of meat of either chicken, beef, lamb, or pork. Both also come with a serving of noodles (udon, vermicelli etc) or rice. The large also comes with some seafood items and is a very filling, even for someone with a big appetite. Trust me, my friends are big eaters and  they were stuffed to the brim. Only get the large when you're very hungry!! Otherwise, I always get the small. The choice of broth is extensive and unlike other hot pot restaurants, Centre Street does not charge you extra for the broth. I recommend the Japanese chicken and the Japanese pork bone broths. They're flavorful without being too salty. If you're adventurous and love spicy, the spicy broth is VERY spicy. There's also self-serve complimentary iced teas and a sauce bar. 

The rest of the menu includes noodles, and deep fried snacks. I haven't tried those dishes yet since I always go for the hot pot. 

Service-wise, it was decent. The servers were friendly, refilled our broths frequently and the food came out quick. 

Overall, I highly recommend Centre Street Japanese Hot Pot if you don't want to spend $25+ for AYCE hot pot. Yes, you lose out on choice, but you certainly get more than what you can eat."}
{"text":"We usually go for the happy hour which is after 9 or 10 pm. You get the hotpot with a bubble tea for about $13 to $15.  The hot pot is not all you can eat but they give you more than enough food.  I've tried the satay, sukiyaki and chili and have liked all of them. It's just your preference.  We like going her so everyone can order their own thing based on their taste."}
{"text":"I won't come here for the food again. The service is good and the minced pork rice is good. The beef tataki \"highly recommended!!!\" Was a super thick cut, over seared and bland. The nice part was you can get water yourself at the condiment bar. Nothing too special with the soups and half the items on the menu were crossed out"}
{"text":"I was there once when it opened. it was not bad but nothing special. But my friends took me there for lunch last weekend. I was surprised! the lunch special was only $12.99 including a pot of soup with food, one kind of meat, a bowl of rice and Bubble Tea!!!! good food, good price and very good service!!! I definitely will go again :)"}
{"text":"My first time trying Japanese hotpot and had a great time making my own ramen, food turn out to be good and I wasn't a fan of desert but overall all good"}
{"text":"Went there on March 18, 2018. The meal was good. Unfortunately the workers thought it was a good idea to take smoke breaks at their back door or in the washroom. The smell wafted into the dining room a bunch during our meal.  A few times later, you can smell cigarette smoke coming from the kitchen - which is right next to the restaurants sauce station. 

We spoke to their manager, she claims it is the smell of soup burning. Really unfortunate that she thought we are idiots and lied to us.  There were kids and a pregnant lady that were in the dining room.  For shame, I'm pretty sure this is a violation regardless where the smell originated from."}
{"text":"This place is one of the best places to get hot pot because I haven't had one broth that I didn't like! My personal favourite is the sukiyaki. I prefer this place over any all you can eat hot pot because they give perfect portions in fact more than I can eat so it's perfect and only $15. They also make really good bubble tea here too definitely come here if you haven't tried it yet"}
