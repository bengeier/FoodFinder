{"text":"I love it here! it's so cute, dainty, and the macarons are delicious. I come here once in a while when I can and there is always something new to look forward to! The Cocoa Chai, Lemon Lavender and the Umeshu Cherry Blossom are my favourites :) The cream puffs are also great. I've also tried the tree cake, which is amazingly moist and perfectly layered, dense, and flavourful at the same time.  The owner, Stephanie also carries a couple of Belvoir Press√© drinks, and who can say no to a bottle of that stuff!? not me :)  I also love getting half a dozen or a dozen of the macarons because of the cute boxes!"}
{"text":"The shop assistant is super nice, but the taste (macarons) is nothing impressive. I'm a bit disappointed it's just sweet that's it.  If you happen to pass by, try it. Otherwise, don't go for it."}
{"text":"This place was hard to find.  It's literally a small box. However, I do love this place. It's truly a gem that deserves more exposure! The owner was super nice and sweet, and she makes all the food items herself! I got the matcha latte, which had a distinct and strong taste.  It's very authentic and not artificial tasting.  However,  I would advise those who enjoy sweet lattes to not get this drink, as the matcha is strong.  I also got a box of macarons, which were all delicious! My favourite was the earl grey."}
{"text":"I never write reviews, but I had to write something. The macarons and cream puffs are so delicious. All flavours are excellent, but really like the milky earl grey and lemon lavender the most.  You may need to look around for the shop. It's in the alley close to the park.  Can't wait for another visit"}
{"text":"I am so happy that I found Petit Nuage.  It's a great tiny little store that doesn't look like much, but has really incredible macarons.  I tried lots of different flavours and really loved the Earl Grey and Lemon Lavender.  The prices are reasonable and the service is great.  I will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"One of the best macaron places I've been to in Toronto, and I've been to the better known ones like Nadege, Butter Avenue, and Bobbette & Belle. My foodie friends introduced me to Petit Nuage and I was very surprised by the moment I saw it. It's a tiny little shop operating out of a transformed cargo container and can't fit more than 3 or 4 people at once. The decor is adorable as are the macaron boxes.  The size of the macarons is quite substantial. I split a half dozen box with two friends. It cost about $14 total. I tried the Nimbus and HK Style Milk Tea flavours and both were delicious. The Nimbus one was very light and fluffy and the HK Milk Tea one tasted exactly like HK milk tea, down to the tea flavour and creaminess that I love. The only downside was that the HK Milk Tea macaron was hard when I had it, but I suspect that had to do with the fact that I was out in the cold for a long time so it possibly froze/hardened. None of the other ones that my friends had had any problems. 10/10 would go back and try the other flavours."}
{"text":"Delicious. When I went, there were still 10/12 flavours there (missing: Nimbus and umeshu cherry blossom) and no cream puffs - really wanted to try one! Anyway, the macarons were delicate and so good. It's a tiny little store, but inside is beautiful!  Try not to eat a whole dozen in one sitting, haha. Will definitely be back to try the other products/drinks available!"}
{"text":"Great service and wonderful macarons. I liked the Lemon Lavender and the Milky Earl Grey."}
{"text":"Crazy good. Everything. Today was the green matcha cream puff. So good. Simply divine at any price, let alone $4.00."}
{"text":"The Milky Earl Grey macaron is so rich and worth every penny. Uji Matcha is very good, too. The tiny shop is meticulous and detailed. Owner is friendly and excited to share her little spot with you. Will be back for more Milky Earl Greys."}
{"text":"Delicious, beautiful, not too sweet, original flavours. Cute store, hard to find!! It is on a little path in a little portable hut. The owner/baker is kind, as well as very talented. These are indeed the city's best just like you've been told by reviewers, and you're friends, and the media."}
{"text":"Amazing ! Such a small little bakery but it does not disappoint. The macaroons are are chewy with the perfect sweetness. I also tried the cream puffs which was really good. Would definitely love to go back again just for the cream puffs. So glad I have tried to place. For someone that has tried macaroons all over Toronto, I would say their macaroons are pretty good."}
{"text":"Near the backwoods of Chinatown, on the edge of Alexandra Park, at the corner of Bathurst & Dundas, at the mouth of a dark alleyway (unless it's daytime then it's not so dark), tucked in a sea container lies....a desserts shop specializing in macaron. Not exactly the beginning to a horror story.  Petite Nuage occupies 1/4th of a sea container, along with two or three other sea container businesses that are starting to spring up in Toronto. The variety of these businesses range from Jamaican food, to consumer electronics. The addition of Petite Nuage gives a touch class to the variety of businesses here. Although, normally, a touch of class was not exactly ever an issue anyplace where sea containers are found.   Macaron, a patrician dessert of French origin normally associated with English high tea, and arguably the most instagramed food item of 2013. It was not until my VIP tour to the Royal York hotel did I taste my first (complimentary) macaroon, the ones here taste better. Not to disparage my favourite hotel in Toronto, they don't make their own. The obscurity of the setting is not to distract from the overall 'cuteness' of the store. It's no bigger than a hotel bathroom, which led me to stupidly ask the owner how much the rent costs, and then immediately retract my question after realizing what a completely rude question it was.  Macaron, rolls of them rivaling any full sized bakery, cream puffs, locally made 'from scratch' chocolates, Sicilian lemonade (they grew lemons in Sicily?), ginger 'beer', even wooden broaches? I don't understand the concept, but I care because the desserts here are bad ass. Apparently, the owner lady is a formally trained baker who apprenticed at the Park Hyatt in Yorkville. Why she ever left is a mystery to me, but I'm not one to complain as these elitist sweets have found their way into my Dickensian budget, through the miracle of retired cargo containers of the high seas.  To Hell with Green P parking, Just station your vehicle right on the winding road while you get out for a quick bite. You can keep your eye your vehicle without worry with the way these shops are situated. Looking at the setting, I am reminded how this part of the world is resembling more of a 3rd world-esk market with it's dwindling economy, and what a different story it is overseas in Asia, where these things would be expected, but don't exist. Sea container shops for Goodness sakes, how kitsch, and yet; how beautifully local.  I made the mistake of bringing one of the cream puffs back to work with me, I bit into the thing without having any knowledge what a cream puff is. The cooled white creamy centre exploded all over my face the moment my supervisor walked in on me."}
{"text":"Was quite impressed with the quality for this tiny little shop run by one person. Overall I think this place is definitely worth a try. The filling for one of them was a little more thick than im used to, but the flavour was really good!  I got the following flavours: Peach sake - probably the most unique of the bunch. There is kind of a syrupy thing in the macaron which had a slight liquor flavour to it.  Hojicha - the filling was a little thick and paste-ish with tea flavour HK Milk Tea - good Royal Earl Grey - one of my faves Matcha - another fave Yuzu Honey - ok"}
{"text":"Amazing gem! Stephanie is super nice and makes amazing unique flavour macarons and serves amazing earl grey tea. Got a dozen macarons for an amazing price (we spent $27). Will definitely come back for more treats!"}
{"text":"Ok I would give this four stars because the shop itself is pretty small and some of the stuff can get a bit pricey (like 4.50 cream puffs) but everything is so worth it. The cream puffs are a bit small but they are abolutely DELISH. The cream inside is just matcha, no heavy cheesey custard or anything. It's beautiful, and the puff itself is sweet and remniscent of a pineapple bun but more crunchy. The matcha latte and macarons are also the Bomb.com."}
{"text":"Cute little shop. Very little indeed but it's like a slice of Paris planted along Dundas.  Had to try a cream puff due to the reviews and there was only one left when we arrived at 3PM. The flavour of the day was matcha.  Firstly, the cream puff was huge and impossible not to have the filling explode on you. Make sure you grab napkins (or bring a bib)! It isn't your typical cream puff shell--it is crispy and comparable to the crust topping of a HK pineapple bun. It was delicious and each bite definitely sends you up into a petit nuage :)  If you are a macaron fan, the ones they had on display looked perfect!"}
{"text":"Went second time for a cream puff filled with Matcha cream. The puff was crispy and the Matcha cream was perfectly sweetened and very creamy.  It is a hidden gem"}
{"text":"great, great, great. i'm not a sweets nut. but even i have to admit these treats deserve your respect and attention :-) #dontstop"}
{"text":"I didn't believe the five star at first so I had to go and try it out myself. It's not a big bakery but more on size of a kiosk sized little shop. They don't have much of a variety in desserts except macarons, lattes,  other drinks and cream puffs but if those are what you are looking for then this is a great small shop to stop by at. Macaroons are flavourful and rich. I love how the sizes are a tad larger than the typical macaron and the texture is fresh and chewy! Did I mention the owner is quite friendly and she uses fine matcha powder all the way from Uji (place in Japan) :) Oh last but not least, their cream puffs, specifically the matcha cream puffs are to die for! I normally don't like or eat cream puffs but I absolutely love this one and I know when I'm craving macaron or cream puffs I'll definitely return here!"}
{"text":"Best macarons in the city ! Also tried the lemon cream puff and it was perfect."}
{"text":"A little shop that's not eye catching at all however it's definitely worth the walk/ride to come to this area just for its matcha cream puff and macarons!   The matcha cream puff was just simply on point  nothing much to say about it but the fact that it's just amazingly delicious! Crusty melon bread on the outside with the combination of soft and smooth matcha cream on the inside. My friend immediately bought seconds after finishing the puff in one gulp!  The macarons were not a disappointment either. As a person with sweet tooth, the sweetness was just too fine  but it was a little too sweet for my friends however they still loved it! The macarons are sold at a completely reasonable price! Suitable as a small simple yet cute exquisite gift for others!   The owner was sweet and nice! She runs the place herself! Highly recommend everyone to visit her for some delicious cream puff and macarons!"}
{"text":"Great macarons, lovely and passionate chef / owner.  Come here to get your macarons on! Flavours are forever rotating and there are seasonal cakes to try from time to time.   Been here a few times now and each time left with delicious sweets. Packaging is on point too!"}
{"text":"Definitely a hidden gem in the Bathurst and Dundas area. Upon arriving to Petit Nuage, you notice a bunch of cargo units, colourful and small. Petit Nuage is tucked in the back of majority of the other stalls.  As you enter in, there is only really room for 2 customer at a time. Very cute atmosphere (small kitchen behind, with a cooler filled with her sweet treats.) The owner was very friendly and helpful as we asked her questions about her baked goods. I got the matcha cream puff and a dozen of assorted macarons (ranging from flavours such as: Matcha, Sake peach, hk Milk Tea, milky earl gray) All flavours are very asian inspired and unique. Price is also very fair as a dozen macaron was only 22$ (compared to butter avenue and nadeage it is a very fair price). The size of the macaron are normal and texture is just perfect! Crispy shell with not too heavy filling.  The matcha cream puff is amazing. I am still dreaming about it to this day! She filled up the cream puff with so much matcha filling that when you bite in everything squirts out! The cream puff shell is also very crispy and taste a little bit like the asian pineapple bun crust! So good and so worth it for the price.  Definitely an amazing place to stop by if you are having an asian sweet tooth craving!"}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this store's instagram and decided to Yelp it. The reviews were glowing so I had to come check it out myself! I took the 1 and a half hour bus ride from Scarborough to the tiny little shop right at Bathurst and Dundas. Was it worth it? If there was a response that expressed \"yes\" more than \"yes\" then....Yes! The owner had car troubles so opened the place about an hour late, but the extra waiting did not dampen my experience there. She is a very friendly lady who's down to earth; her enthusiasm is infectious. :)   There were only macarons for sale that day in terms of baked goods so I decided to get 12. Two of each flavour: uji matcha, yuzu honey, HK milk tea, milky earl grey, black sesame and lychee raspberry. The uji matcha macaron is ON POINT, I liked this one more than Butter Avenue's. The earl grey, black sesame and lychee raspberry are also delicious. I have yet to try the others but if they're anything like the previous ones I've tried then I'm in for a treat. :)  What really made my experience amazing was Steph offering me a free cup of warm peaches and cream white tea and a free matcha macaron for my troubles. That really brightened my day. The packaging on everything is also very very cute (I love the teatime cats).  I am 100% going to return to this awesome little joint to try some of the cream puffs, cake and matcha latte!"}
{"text":"1 star for the lovely owner/baker - mad props to her for making all those delicious treats alone! 1 star for the macarons; most of them were bursting with flavors...especially the tea flavored ones as it's pretty hard sometimes to taste the light flavor teas. The macarons aren't as chewy as I'd like...but they do have some pretty unique flavors i have not seen elsewhere. 1 star for the matcha cream puff I had today. loved that that puff was filled when purchased, that way the cream did not make the puff soggy.  1 star for the matcha filling, it was full of flavor! I love it when i can taste a bit of green tea bitterness.  It's a pretty good place, however, don't expect to sit and enjoy your dessert in the shop as it's just a food stall and there's no seating...which made it pretty tough for cold weather, you must get it to-go. The treats were memorable, however, if I have to drive 45 mins down there, it might just not be worth the trip. However, if i am in the area and I need a little pick-me-up then I would definitely visit."}
{"text":"This was our last stop at Market 707 during our downtown food trip, and we got a matcha cream puff ($4.50) and two macarons ($2.25 each).   The matcha cream puff we ate at a table right outside of Petit Nuage. The matcha cream was fresh (we watched them make it), and for $4.50, it's a treat that I would not buy every day, but would consider doing again. They were nice enough to get us a knife and plate so we could cut it up and share it.   The macaron flavors we bought were lemon-lavender, and sake peach blossom. We had the sake peach blossom. I did not think it tasted particularly of sake, but there was a dollop of something akin to peach jam on the inside that I thought was quite nice. The lemon-lavender one I ended up giving to a certain little cousin of mine who told me that if I went, she wanted a macaron (she's never been to Petit Nuage, but saw me looking up places on Yelp and told me she wanted me to go to this one).  If I'm in the area, I wouldn't mind stopping for another cream puff, but I'm not the biggest fan of macarons, so I think I'd pass on those next time."}
{"text":"Was so excited to finally try this tiny but attractive bakery, situated slightly back from the row of storage container market stores along Dundas West. Stephanie was very pleasant and went over the bakery offerings for today, which included matcha cream puffs ($4), black sesame matcha roll cake slices ($5/slice), and various colourful macarons including royal earl grey, hk milk tea, black sesame, hojicha, yuzu honey, as well as others.   I purchased 2 cream puffs, a slice of roll cake, and 2 macarons. They also sell Sloan tea.  The black sesame matcha roll cake was moist and had a noticeable amount of matcha flavour. The black sesame cream filling was more subtle to me but I enjoyed the white chocolate crunchy pearls and the fact that it wasn't too sweet. Hubby and I shared this with my mother in law and she enjoyed it as well.  The matcha cream puff had a crunchy exterior not unlike a HK pineapple bun but filled with a very generous amount of matcha pastry cream. Messy but delicious and again, not too sweet (as I like it).  Looking forward to coming back here again to try their earl grey roll cake as earl grey is one of my faves!  (44/100)"}
{"text":"We stopped by Petit Nuage on a trip to Toronto. 100% worth it. Best macarons ever, incredibly adorable, and with unique and creative flavors. The shop is very cute and it's easy to just stop in and pick up a treat on your way."}
{"text":"Easily the best place in Toronto for macarons. The size is generous and definitely worth the price ($2.25/ea).  The owner, Steph, bakes everything herself and her flavors are both unique and delicious.   The matcha green tea mac is a personal favorite as well as the apple pie (which is a seasonal flavor)."}
{"text":"After Cereal Box event last week, my friend and I decided to fight the cold and walk instead of Uber (instant regret). Passed by Gushi and trying to see if it was opened (because I wanted takoyaki ) when I saw this sign saying \"Voted Best Macarons by BlogTO\". Got my attention and decided to go in and check it out! The store is really tiny so the owner makes her pastries at a community kitchen before bringing them to her shop. O and the boxes she uses for the macarons are so adorable!! Would make a great gifts for your lady friends   Got 6 different flavours: hk milk tea, royal earl grey, houjicha, royal pistachio, chestnut & Italian cherry. I really like the macaron cookies, outside was a bit crunchy and inside was moist and chewy. But the fillings were a little bit too sweet for me and the flavours were not as distinct as the macarons at Butter Avenue. Would definitely go back and try the cream puff as it got really good reviews and maybe try some different flavours of macarons as well (the yuzu honey & uji matcha)"}
{"text":"Ratings: Food: 9.5/10 Drink: 9/10 Service: 9/10 Value: 9/10 Hygiene: 10/10 Aesthetics: 8/10  I was in the area waiting for a couple friends to go for dinner and just happened on this shop. I love french macarons so I had to give this place a shot.  I ended up getting a 6-pack of macarons and a iced matcha latte. The matcha was prepared fresh and was an excellent refresher on a hot day outside.   The macarons were fantastic, the textures were all just right. The outside was crispy, the inside was chewy and the ganache was smooth and creamy. I ended up picking the peach sake, lemon lavender, uji matcha, dark and stormy, jasmine rose, and the earl grey. All of them were awesome, but the earl grey was probably my favorite.   The decor is simple and cute. Unfortunately, being inside a shipping crate doesn't give it a lot of floor space or any seating space.   I highly recommend this place if you like macarons."}
{"text":"What a nice surprise to find this cute little macaron and sweet treat shop!  I stumbled upon this on Yelp as I was in the area for an appointment. I did not expect to find something like this in the area since it was located in row of shipping containers. So creative and cute!  I was early on a weekday and there were around 10+ flavours to choose from. I got the HK milk tea, Earl grey, Hojicha, and peach & jasmine. They were all pretty good. To be honest, I find macarons quite sweet in general but I loved how this place had so many flavours including the Asian ones!  There was also the matcha cream puff but I resisted but definitely will try their other treats next time. The macaron packaging did not disappoint. I also really liked how the small shop had cute cat decor and also you can find teas and jams for sale as well.  I believe I did meet the owner and she was very nice. She took the time to run through macarons and her suggestions. Thumbs up :)"}
{"text":"Just a single girl She's holding the whole place down Oh yes you go Steph!  Delicate desserts From a shipping container Tiny surprises  Details are on point Macaron flavours are gems Shining bright each bite  All that being said, this is one of the most interesting enterprises to take up shop in the Market 707 cluster of converted shipping container shops at the Scadding Court Recreation Centre, animating that stretch of Dundas Street. And all that being said off-pattern still, {TTC: 505 or 511 streetcars to Dundas at Bathurst}"}
{"text":"The store is small and kinda tucked into the street so you might miss it the first time. Macarons are cheap,  bucks for one, and are individually wrapped. They had a huge air pocket in the shell and were more crumbly than the soft and melt in your mouth texture i expected. I enjoyed the apple cinnamon macaron and the lemon lavander one."}
{"text":"These are the best macarons in Toronto. THE BEST. No contest. Amazingly delicate, gooshy gooey flavorful. So decadent. Just wonderful! Also the most innovative and fun flavour combinations - think  Lemon Lavender, Yuzu Honey, Vanilla Rose, Uji Matcha, Ginger Orange, Earl Grey, Jasmine Apricot, Nimbus... Nimbus is a sky blue bite of heaven, and it really does taste like a perfect fluffy cloud. The texture of these macarons is just BEYOND. It's perfect. Lighter, airy yet substantial, with better, more perfect filling than any other macaron shop in Toronto. These never taste fridge burnt, they are never hard, they are perfect light mouthfuls of happiness and joy. Did I mention that they are perfect?! PERFECT. The owner is really fun to chat about baking with, and I also love her cream puffs - the lemon is my fave. It's not the easiest location if you are driving, but if you are walking/biking in the area, I highly recommend. I also love that Petit Nuage is open a little later - usually til 7 I think? A great place to stop and pick up treats on your way to a dinner party. ;)"}
{"text":"Super friendly service and the best desserts!! I love the Hong Kong milk tea flavoured macaron and matcha cream puff."}
{"text":"Amazing macarons ordered from petite!  Was kind enough to allow me to preorder and had it ready for pickup at this neat little shop of hers.  Bought two dozens, ones for the office and one for the SO. Was an absolute hit!  Loved the unique flavours (12+) offered unlike some other shops.  Will definitely swing by again sooner rather than later!"}
{"text":"From the outside it doesn't look like much, but when you go in you're welcomed by calm music and a bright atmosphere. Everything is beautifully decorated. Because the space is so tiny, every crevice is meticulously filled, and its cute to just examine the store. The arrangement of the products are really nice. I was surprised to see that there were some non-food items- cards, cups and buttons. I was told by the shopkeeper that the goodies were all made that same morning. With that I purchased three items and hurried home to try them all:  Vanilla Cream Puff: Really tasty. The cream puff was an interesting experience for me. I've had Papa's Beard cream puffs before and found these to be quite different- but in a good way. Compared to Papa's Beard, this cream puff's shell has an interesting texture. It is flakey and it's like soft cookie or gingerbread crumbs. It has a slight \"crunch\" factor that I'm not used to, but it is still good. The cream itself was very good- not too sweet and not too plain. Overall I liked it very much.  Uji Matcha Cream Puff: This cream puff is good too. When you first bite into it, you can really taste the matcha, but that may be just because of the matcha sprinkled on the TOP of the cream puff. There is some matcha flavour in the cream itself, however it's a bit more subtle. It's not a bad puff overall, but I believe it could be improved if there's more matcha flavour in the cream.  Milky Earl Grey Cream Puff: The outer layer was soft and moist and inside has a filling. I cannot quite place what the filling is exactly, but it's reminiscent of a gingerbread/ banana bread flavour? I found the filling to be a bit too sweet for my liking. In terms of if it actually tastes like Earl Grey or not, it sorta did. In the beginning I was able to catch some hints of Earl Grey flavouring in the shell, but unfortunately the filling was too strong and overpowered it. Overall, I did not like the macaroon too much because I found the filling much too sweet for my liking- but then I usually like things that are a bit more plain in general. Just because I didn't enjoy it too much doesn't mean it was a poorly made macaron though.  Verdict: I will recommend this store to my friends and I'll be returning in the future. I'm also curious and want to give the other macaron flavours a try."}
{"text":"I swing by whenever I can, which ends up being a few times a month! My absolute favourite treat from here has to be the roll cakes. Unfortunately they're only available on weekends but definitely worth the trip if you are nearby on a weekend! Steph is such a sweet heart and you can't help but admire her talent and hard work!"}
{"text":"After reading rave reviews on Yelp - dropped by Petit Nuage in the afternoon hoping they don't run out of macarons. I was on a mission for finding a gift. When I arrived there were already two people inside choosing through a variety of macaron flavours and their seasonal flavours. Purchased salted caramel, yuzu honey, lychee raspberry, matcha, oolong honey and earl grey macaron and a nice slice of earl grey cake roll for me! It tasted so good, dived right in with a fork the moment I got home! Highly recommend checking out their Facebook page for their hours and variety of selection for the day. Also received a complimentary heart macaron, thanks!"}
{"text":"*The macaron and pastry boxes are designed by Steph's friends. She also sells some cat magnets (of course I got a pack), local jams and imported Japanese candies as well.  *The selection of cakes and pastry varies throughout the days, whereas the flavors of macarons are depended on the seasons.   (Psh insider secret.. To check what type of pastry Steph will have for the day, follow her Instagram @petitnuagetoronto :). If you see something that you like, comment on the photo to reserve that item and of course, make sure to pick it up on the same day before the store closed).   -Key Lime Cream Puff - $4:  There are other flavors as well, such as green tea and vanilla. Steph advised that the cream puff is best to be eaten after the lid is taken off, unless you want to save it for later then store in the fridge with lid on! Before you devour the cream puff, make sure to bite from the hole where the cream was piped in, or else you will be faced with an explosion mess - you have been warned.  The cream puff was really really tasty. I liked Steph's cream puff more than Papa's beard cream puffs as I found the latter to be incredibly messy to eat. The cream puff's shell here is not too flakey and had a slight crunch, which was quite interesting. The cream itself was smooth, not too sweet and had a hint of sour taste from the key lime :).  -Black sesame honey matcha cake - $6: The cake itself is a bit harder than I thought, and although the flavors might seems a bit strange, the bitter green tea and nutty black sesame was a perfect combination! However I would have prefered to have more of the matcha flavor, as I found the black sesame was too rich and the sweetness from the honey was a bit overwhelming as well.  -Plum & Matcha hard candy: At first I disliked the initial taste, but then I decided to keep the candy in my mouth longer, it starts to get sweet inside. It's like eating a sour and salty plum then it slowly get better and sweeter. Though I couldn't detect the matcha flavor, I don't mind it as much as the candy is actually quite addicting!  -Iced matcha latte - $4.75: Petit Nuage was recently crowned as having the best green tea latte in Toronto, so of course I have to get it on all my visits ;). Steph told me the matcha powder that she used is imported from Japan, and it is not being sell anywhere in Canada but Steph has the connection :p. Interestingly she said all high grade matcha powder should be stored in the fridge to preserve the powder, if someone tell you otherwise, that means the matcha powder is not a good quality one! The iced matcha latte at Petit Nuage was really refreshing and not too sweet (you can ask her to add more syrup if you like). It had a deep, vegetal taste, a strong aroma and a lingering sweetness that leaves your mouth watering.  -Macarons:  Petit Nuage sells a box of 6 macarons for $12, whereas a box a dozen is $25. In general I found that the macarons at Petit Nuage can be more sweet compared to other macarons I have had in the city. Their macarons are perfectly made in terms of texture.  *Strawberry Basil: This is a seasonal (summer) flavor and it was really good! There was strawberry jelly in the middle with a sweet basil ganache. *Vanilla Rose: the rose flavor is a bit too strong and I felt it was clashing with the sweet vanilla, which made this macaron too sweet for my taste. *Yuzu Honey: I wished the yuzu flavor was a bit stronger since it didn't have a lot of that tangy, tart note but overall it's really good! A must try! *Hong Kong milk tea: tasted just like a cup of good old HK milk tea. A favourite! *Jasmine Apricot: understated jasmine and apricot flavor. Not too sweet, It's like drinking a nice cup of jasmine tea with apricot syrup. *Uji Matcha: My favorite! The moment you bite into it, you get a gentle mouth feel of green tea (matcha) flavour along with the slight bitter ganache. *Roasted tea and Persimmon: strong roasted tea flavor with (I believe) a subtle persimmon jam in the middle. *Milky Earl Grey: I'm not sure what is the filling here, but there was only a slight hint of earl grey and I felt the filling overpowered the tea flavor. *Lemon Lavender: I usually don't like lavender as too much of it can taste like a hand soap, but this macaron had a strong lemon flavor with a faint taste of lavender. One of my favourite! *Coconut Pineapple: Not too sweet with a strong taste of coconut until you get that slight tartness from the pineapple jam and coconut bits."}
{"text":"I loved this little place and I'll be dreaming about these macaroons when I get back home. They are simply amazing! Get a espresso or matcha tea and enjoy the best macaroons in town."}
{"text":"Came here before the new year and got a few macarons to taste test, and they were great. A lot of flavors run out faster than the others, so my original plan to get a huge box for a party fell kind of short. Either way, it was a great set that I had, tasty and a bit sweeter than normal so they're great for tea time (if people still do that). The place is real small and cant have more than 1-2 buyers at a time so go check out something else in the Scadding market and come back if there's a line.  Will definitely be back to some of the other stuff they have."}
{"text":"Walked by while walking from Red Pegasus to the Eaton Centre.  Such a tiny, beautiful store, part of several businesses which fit into a renovated shipping container, as is the style at Scadding Court! At first I felt like a bit of a bull in a china shop but the owner put me at ease and offered me a cup of tea.  Macaroons and cakes and Japanese pastries and Matcha sweets were neatly arranged on the shelves.  Pinky-sized terrariums.    Cards and buttons.  Just the thing to fill out Christmas stockings!  What a find!  High school French was a long time ago, but I believe 'Petit Nuage' means 'Little Cloud'.  Don't ask me, visit the store and ask for yourself!"}
{"text":"my new fave spot for cakes! their Earl gray roll cake was just so amazing. great flavors, with soft creamy texture, and added rice cracker? I believe. paired so well. 10/10 Macaroons were also great. although it would have been better if the outer shell was more crispy. but the flavour!! OMG. the patisserie must be a wizard of flavour. 10/10 for flavour, 8.5/10 for the shell texture."}
{"text":"you'd never guess that this place sells macarons that are on par with the best in the city.  creative flavors that work and are delicious.  they also make a great macha latte."}
{"text":"Coffee Caramel Roll Cake!!!  It was perfection on a plate.  Not too sweet, beautiful caramel flavour and crunchy little crispy beads in the cream filling within a subtly flavoured coffee sponge cake all rolled up into a beautiful dessert.  As soon as I saw the photo on Facebook, I knew it was my dream cake, but I wouldn't be able to get there until later in the day, so I sent a message asking her to save me some and I am so grateful that she did.  Hubby is not a dessert fan but he loved this cake too.  I have had the cream puffs from Petit Nuage before and they were great, and Macarons are the claim to fame here but it's not a dessert I go for, but Roll Cake, I usually can only find good Roll Cake at Christmas... so Petit Nuage to the rescue on this cold rainy weekend!  I look forward to trying other flavours of roll cake but sure do hope she makes this Coffee Caramel one again!  Yum!  PS - I didn't take a picture of the masterpiece before we devoured it, so I am sharing the photo she tempted me with on Facebook!  Looks amazing, tasted even better!"}
{"text":"I LOVED the cream puff.  I've never had a cream puff like this before.  The outside, pastry, was like the normal pastry crossed with the top of a pineapple bun.  Amazing!  The inside cream filling was a matcha filling, that filled the pastry to the brim!"}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this little hidden gem via Instagram and actually made the trek out here alone one day because I just had to give it a try. It's a tiny little shop, and to be honest when I was in there I was kind of terrified I was going to knock something over or destroy the whole thing like a bull in a china shop, but really the place is quite charming in its own way. I came specifically to try the macarons and also the iced matcha latte. They usually have a selection of about 10-12 macaron flavours, which I think is pretty impressive given the size of the store. I got a box of six - milky earl grey, matcha, yuzu honey, jasmine apricot, HK milk tea, and coconut pineapple. All of the macarons are these lovely pastel colours and the boxes they come in are ADORABLE with pictures of cats on them. My two favourite flavours were HK milk tea and jasmine apricot, but honestly I don't think you could go wrong with any of the flavours. To be quite honest, the texture of the macarons wasn't the very best I've ever had (both Nadege and Butter Avenue still share the #1 spot), but these came really close, and I was very pleasantly surprised and impressed! I think I would have liked them to be just the tiiiiinest bit chewier, but mad props to Steph on a solid job well done. The iced matcha latte was also very refreshing - I got mine unsweetened so the matcha flavour was VERY potent, so die-hard matcha fans are sure to enjoy this. Anyways I would definitely come back again the future to try other flavours as well as some of the other pastries that they offer here!"}
{"text":"Cute store and yummy macarons but a bit too sweet for my liking. Matcha is the best and for 6 it's $14. Would rather go to Butter Avenue since they are only $0.75 more expensive and their macarons are not as sweet. Definitely check it out though. The area that it is located has a lot of tiny food stalls."}
