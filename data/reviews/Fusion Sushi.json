{"text":"There was 11 of us that went for lunch. The variety of food was really good for all the different types of eaters at our table (picky to eats everything). I think the price was right for the amount we ate so highly recommended. We also enjoyed the ice cream dessert at the end (I had the green tea...yum!)"}
{"text":"We waited an incredibly long time to get seated as it was dinner rush and we were 7 but it was 30+ minutes of a wait. The service was fast though. I must say that the plates weren't exactly clean and the washrooms not very modern, outdated mostly. 

The food was boring and it was quantity over quality. Everything was fast and all but there was nothing good. I stopped eating after a 3 dishes because  of how boring and used to it I got. The tempura was not worth it, soggy yet a tad crispy. Highlight was the beef spare ribs but you get tired of them like all the food on the menu. I wouldn't come back but if you never tried it you should as it's good experience"}
{"text":"Ehhh...It was okay. Ordering on the iPad was fun, but I don't know if I would return. Sushi was pretty decent for an all you can eat place - Thai food was terrible!"}
{"text":"My friend and I decided to try this place out as I was craving sushi and we both wanted to find a good AYCE place in Calgary. We were not greeted when we walked in even though there were two young guys at the front, bustling with nothing in particular. It wasn't until my friend said hello that one of them decided to pay attention to us. Mind you, that was the biggest hint of what type of service we were going to get. We were seated toward the back of the restaurant and it was pretty cold. Granted, it was -26C that day but their furnace was definitely not working as other tables were commenting on the temperature too.

As it was our first time here, we decided to try a little bit of everything. Their menu has a number of options available for both Japanese and Thai cuisine, which I was happy about, but if you're hoping to satisfy your sashimi craving, look elsewhere as it's non-existent. They also have limited ingredients available so you may find that you're eating very similar things even though you ordered different dishes.

First thing I noticed was their portion sizes weren't very big, but considering it's an AYCE and you can order as much as you want (without wasting food,) that didn't really bother me. The sushi rice is stickier and softer than what I've found at other sushi restaurants so I can't help but think that they either don't use Japanese rice at all or they mix it with other rice. They are also a bit stingy with the amount of ingredients they use as our seafood teppanyaki udon noodles had only one tiny piece of squid, two shrimps, and half a piece of imitation crab meat in it.

The service definitely lacked as we always had to flag down someone, otherwise, they would stay far, far away. I would be more inclined to try one of their different locations with better ratings. Overall, I would say this is an ok place to go to if you want tons of mediocre sushi at an ok price."}
{"text":"I came here with my friend and her son for lunch and on the menu it says that children under 3 years old eat free. Her son is 2 years old. Anyways, my friend and I ordered from the all you can eat menu and after a little while the manager came over to our table. He said that we would have to pay for her son because he did not believe he was 3. My friend is very shy, so I spoke for her and I asked him if he was calling me a liar, and the manager continued to argue with me and said that he looked very big and he needed proof. I told him that he is a big 2 year old and that she does not carry around his birth certificate with her everywhere she goes! Then he said he would make an exception for this one time only, which is ridiculous since it says on the menu that children under 3 eat free. Then he told my friend and I to only order what we need and he tried to charge us the dinner price when we were paying! Safe to say that I will never be coming back here again! The manager is so cheap and inconsiderate to his customers."}
{"text":"nice little place for a few friends to dine. recommend their scallop tempura dynamite roll and dragon roll. will come back"}
{"text":"The sashimi and rolls I had were delicious. Friendly, quick service. As it is a new restaurant, it will take time to grow in popularity but I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Most of the food was good, however, the service was absolutely horrible. We had some dumplings and sushi that we didn't finish because we didn't know they contained certain ingredients and because we just didn't like the taste in particular. A guy (possibly the manager?) came to our table and told us in a very condescending and belittling tone, \"You ordered that right? So you're gonna eat it\". His reasoning was that they didn't want to waste food, which is understandable--we don't want to waste food either. But I've never been in a buffet restaurant where you are forced to eat everything that you take. 

Definitely the worst $60 I've ever spent. We're never going back."}
{"text":"visited for the first time for lunch. Excited to try a new all you can eat place for sushi, but i would have to say it was fairly average experience.

Service wise they were friendly and nice. When i first ordered they brought the food out fairly quickly. The rounds after than was longer and they sometimes didnt bring all of our items.

I ordered mostly the sushi and hand rolls and found them to be average in terms of quality for all-you-can sushi.
I wouldnt recommend the tuna sushi, i couldnt taste the tuna over the rice.
I was happy that they have hand cones, although they were also a bit heavier with the rice.

The salmon belly is pretty good!

Overall, foods ok for an all-you-can. service was pretty good other than a few missing food items."}
{"text":"As this is an ayce place you cant expect to have top notch food like a specialized restaurant, but in comparison to the other ayce places in Calgary, i found this one to be the most decent . Food portion and taste are consistent so you know exactly what you r getting. Price is the same w other places ($30-$33 incl tip and gst per person). Clean and attentive service, most dishes are spiced well not overly salty or spicy...highly recommend if you got a bad craving for sashimi and sushi!

( I do wonder if most ayce places in Calgary r owned by the same owner tho, since concept and menu r so similar??)"}
{"text":"Love it! For lunch the price is perfect! With tip you're looking at about 20 bucks! All you can eat sushi, rolls, tempura, dumplings, rices, udons...etc. The rice is a bit warm so it threw me off the first time I went here. The service is pretty quick, but they did forget some things that we had ordered and it was too late for them to make it for us after as we had to go back to work.

All in all, this is one of my favorite all you can eat sushi places! I wouldn't recommend going for dinner, because the sashimi is a bit small for the price you pay, but lunch is perfect!"}
{"text":"Not consistent. My first order was perfect and well priced. My next order for delivery July 15th was $85 and teriyaki chicken was forgotten. The deliver took 2 hours. When I called they said they would send it to me. They didn't.

Great food, slow delivery. (Don't cook just eat)"}
{"text":"Wow! This is our favourite Japanese all you can eat. We came here with 4 other friends for Sunday dinner. The food was delicious; Beautiful presentation. We like the fact that all the dishes came in small portions, Tapas style. This way we get to sample many different varieties. 
We loved many dishes; too many to list but to name a few: the fried salmon belly, rolls, sashimi, , beef tataki and mango yogurt for desert. 
We can't wait to go back again."}
{"text":"If I could give a minus star I would! We stopped by for lunch one day & like most people we only get an hour for lunch so as we were not familiar with this place we expected a buffet style. No smiles or welcome for us at the door just a grunt and a host that walked away as we looked around for the buffet. We mentioned that this was our first time there, only to be met with stony silence. Nice! Try as we might we could not get anyone to come to the table & speak to us or take our drink order. 10 minutes later we finally flagged down someone to come & take our order (we had given up on getting drinks by this time). We ended up ordering a number of items (about 10) hoping for the best.   2 of the appetizer items came fairly quickly annndddd we waited aannnddd we waited.  People that came in after us were served and eating & we still waited. After some frantic arm waving (just short of begging someone to come & talk to us) a waitress stopped & we asked about the rest of our order.  She nodded and walked away, never to be seen again!  About 20 minutes had passed since the appetizers were finished and so were the people that came in after us, we had to leave to get back to work on time. Again we flagged down someone to check on the rest of our order and asked that it be wrapped to go because we were out of time. If you guessed that she disappeared and never returned you would be right!  Making our way to the cashier we asked if our order was ready to go & pointed out the waitress we spoke to. Nope, nothing was ready & we paid 16.95 for 2 small appetizer plates.  We asked to speak with the manager only to be met with another charming grunt. 
The veggie dumplings & the spring rolls that we did manage to eat were decent enough but as for this place...a waste of time & money."}
{"text":"Cute little place
Fresh and tasty
Sashimi was fresh
Sushi tasted very rich in a good way
Service was A+"}
{"text":"Excellent service and food was great -- especially for all-you-can-eat sushi."}
{"text":"My fam jam and I decided to do AYCE at Fusion for a belated Father's Day lunch. At $16.95/person, I figured worst case scenario we'd order a bunch of hot dishes and call it even.

Well, I was pleasantly surprised at not only the quality but the variety of food you can get here. In addition to the array of sushi (pieces and rolls), we also got pretty much everything on the menu (pad thai, fried rice, teriyaki chicken/beef, dumplings, etc).

Everything came out relatively quickly and our servers were really friendly. 

This was probably one of my best AYCE experiences, and I wouldn't be opposed to coming back again."}
{"text":"The Fusion Sushi is a new place and is becoming my favourite.  They have an incredible variety of ethnic and fusion food like sushi pizza;)  The service is very good though sometimes there is a language barrier so speak slowly.  The order sizes have gotten smaller since opening, though the quality of the food has remained high and is very enjoyable.  I certainly believe it is best to order the all you can eat style thought individual dishes are amazing too.
Make sure you reserve your table or group as I have been waiting a few times.  
***The only reason for not getting 5 stars is the portion size has gone down (and I like bigger sushi) and the difficulty with my waiters understanding my orders, etc. so it makes it difficult on both sides of the dining experience.  
I would highly recommend visiting Fusion Sushi!"}
{"text":"The sushi is pretty good, but the reason for the two stars is the same as other peoples posts.  When we arrived it took a long time for someone to come and take our drink order, long enough that we had time to pick out our entire meal order as well.
The first item to come was seafood soup, which we thought we had ordered a miso soup, the server walked away and then came back with our original order to point out the error was indeed ours, which we apologize for but they insisted we must eat the soup, just blank expressions and no acknowledgement of our apologies, just continued saying we must eat the soup.
During our meal we had coconut shrimp, after eating three pieces we found a hair swimming in the sauce on the plate, we pointed it out to the server, who grabbed the plate and walked away, no apology, nothing, not even a look of apology, just walked away.  She finally returned and said, we buy you a round of drinks for the hair, but still never said sorry.  So we asked for two beers and she said \"no you get what you already ordered\", which was one beer and one cup of tea that is listed on the menu for $1.00.  
Mistakes happen, but how you handle them is everything and this is why it only gets two stars and I'm not sure we will ever return."}
{"text":"This place was unreal! Great prices and all you can eat!!!! Great people too:) 
10/10 would recommend
Excellent service!!!! Very prompt and fast"}
{"text":"Great food, great prices. Service could be better, sometimes they forget to bring out an order but for they price you pay its not bad."}
{"text":"Fusion is stepping up the sushi game in Kensington and I don't see anything slowing it down.

We made an early reservation for a Thursday night dinner, and making a reservation was a good idea. We arrived to an empty restaurant, with nearly all tables sporting a \"reserved\" sign. We were seated and ordered a few drinks, then had the menu briefly explained to us, along with the already infamous chef's specials board. 

We ordered salmon and tuna sashimi to start, followed by a classic spicy salmon roll, the Alberta roll off the specials rolls, unagi nigiri, and a green dragon roll off the chef's daily special rolls. The sashimi came out promptly, placed in a bowl of ice with a mini ice sculpture (fun!), and it was some of the best sashimi I have had in Calgary. Served at the perfect temperature, the buttery soft, fresh tasting fish was to die for. I am still thinking about that sashimi.

Next were the rolls and let me tell you, this meal just got better and better. Everything was again plated beautifully, and looks weren't all that this sushi had to offer. The green dragon roll from the chefs daily special menu was so perfect: warm tempura, avocado, mayo and green tobiko for snap - loved it all.  The Alberta roll was original and bold, and clearly well thought out, with seared steak, green onions and a spicy sauce coming together for perfection.  We couldn't decide which was our favorite - everything was so fresh and so even handed. Ordering a smattering from the different offerings on the menu proved to be the way to go.

Is Kensington becoming little Vancouver? I sure felt transported.  Even just walking in - there is something so familiar about this place, with the table setup and bar seating along the chefs tables. The service is amazing, on point and friendly. The food is fresh and original, and prepared with thought. By the time we left, the restaurant was full and many of the people who had come in were obviously regulars and greeted warmly by the staff as if they were old friends. It's no surprise this place already has a solid following."}
{"text":"Went for all you can east Sushi and started with just a couple small items to see portion sizes (I hate being wasteful). After these came, we placed the remainder of our order. We waited for a good 45 minutes, but those items never came. When we asked about our order we were given our bill instead. We asked again is our remaining items were coming and the server just shook his head and walked away.

Yipes!! The sushi itself (that we got) was ok. Not great or terrible.The service on the other hand makes me unlikely to return. Don't bother with this place. You can get the same quality sushi elsewhere but with better service."}
{"text":"Its not worst all you can eat, however it won't be a second time restaurant. Servers are walking around and not looking for customers' need. Food is not impressed. It's below standard as a grand open restaurant."}
{"text":"A friend and I went here after having a bad experience at Blufin on MacLeod Trail and this place didn't disappoint.

You need to come in hungry for sure, they have lots of different things to pick from and there was nothing we tried and we both didn't enjoy. I would recommend coming here for all you can eat, the food is yummy and the staff is super friendly and it comes out in a decent amount of time."}
{"text":"Disgusting! The ipads are NEVER washed. they all have 10,000 finger prints on them as well as the green tea pots.  If the front of the restaurant is this dirty I shudder to imagine the food prep area. 

The food was bland and the portions were miniscule.  what a waste of money.  FLU BREEDING GROUND!  They should be reported.  So disgusting and unacceptable.  NEVER eating here again"}
{"text":"Food was excellent. This has become our new go to sushi place. Love that there is all you can eat Thai available too.

Both delivery through skip and eat in experiences were pleasant. We encountered no service issues or food quality issues mentioned in the other reviews.  And we definitely ate our $30 worth of food!"}
{"text":"Fusion sushi seriously my favourite place to eat all you can eat sushi for a very reasonable (pretty cheap) price!! First of all,  the service is AMAZING!! The people are so welcoming and brings your food to the table pretty quickly. Washrooms are generally clean and the music they play is mostly Korean music! 

I'ts mainly not super busy but when it is, it's worth the wait! I only gave it 4/5 because there are SOME times and only some that they forget your order (hardly ever happens, like 1 out of 10) but they're generally good about it. They just let you order it again and they bring it to your table immediately. 

love, love, LOVE this place! Amazing sushi!!"}
{"text":"I've had really good experiences overall at this fusion location. The dine in all you can eat has been fresh and quick and the service has been decent considering how busy it gets. I also like to order take-out from here a lot as well. The takeout portions are larger than the all you can eat portions and definitely recommend the bento boxes and the sushi pizza. Not the highest quality sushi in calgary but it is it bad for the price point."}
{"text":"Nom tasty for me and you, great quality, huge selection, all you can eat option for $20 daytime."}
{"text":"All you can eat buffet. Regular food. Nothing extraordinary, but got good vegetarian options. Tried mango Avocado rolls, Udon, veggie red curry, veg fried rice and sushi pizza"}
{"text":"Delicious, great atmosphere. Music is always fun too.
Sooo much to order so make you go with an empty tummy and a couple hours to eat everything on the menu."}
{"text":"Have been coming to this place since it opened. Has been very good until recently. Food is still great but the service sucks. The place was not busy when we arrived but waited for along time to get order. Food was cold. Then they took it back and just microwaved it. Dried the meat out. Service needs to improve"}
{"text":"All you can eat for a very decent price. The sushi and sashimi was very quick and fresh. we tried a variety of items on the menu, very nice portion sizes and very delicious.  We loved everything we ordered, and we ordered a lot! Perfect for sharing! Good service as well."}
{"text":"Went here with a group of about 8 of us. 

The restaurant is good-sized, clean, and pretty nice. We ordered a mix of things - some people ordered sushi rolls, some ordered nigiri, I ordered a chirashi bowl. 

My chirashi bowl was $17.95 and came with a miso soup and a small salad with a really great dressing. The bowl itself was a good size, with three pieces each of four types of fish, as well as about 5-6 thin slices of tamago. I was really happy with the portion size. The salmon and tuna sashimi was good, but the red snapper sashimi definitely tasted a tad fishy to me. I did eat it anyway, because it wasn't too bad. 

Everyone else seemed to like their food too. The service was attentive, if a bit inexperienced. On more than one occasion I had to severely out of the waiter/waitresses's way while they reached right over me to grab/serve food. But overall not bad."}
{"text":"This place is pretty expensive for a restaurant that doesn't serve real crab.

If you're going to charge $30 per person you should be able to afford to use real crab ."}
{"text":"I'm not normally a fan of AYCE sushi but I was delightfully surprised by the quality of Fusion. I have 3 kids that love sushi so having this nearby is awesome. Plus you don't have to take out a second mortgage to take your group of 5 out for a sushi dinner. The place is clean and the food arrives fast and furious. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Fusion Sushi locations seem to have cropped up all over the place. They are definitely doing well as think they have 6-ish locations now in Calgary.

This one is very similar to the ipad ordering -all-you-can-eat sushi place on Macleod Trail. Except they don't have the same deep fired cheese wontons - the other place has better ones.

But outside of that. Great options. Enough variety to choose from. Hot food as well as sushi. And the price is right.

Not too much else to say really."}
{"text":"Upon a family friend's recommendation, I tried the lunch buffet at this restaurant about 3 months ago.  I was impressed with the food quality and service back then.  During subsequent visits, however, everything just kept going downhill.  The service, it seemed just got worse, even during off-peak hours.  My most recent visit on the 28th of January 2016, would be my last time to dine here.  In spite of being one of the first customers to come in at 11-ish that day - which means that they weren't that busy yet - the crew managed to miss a couple of items that I ordered.  I cannot imagine how it would take them an hour and 15 minutes to cook a couple of chicken skewers or serve a scoop of green tea ice cream.  I left the restaurant terribly disappointed!"}
{"text":"This was the most disappointing dining experience I have ever had. First, we were served shrimp that had not been deveined, resulting in large visible excrement sacks. Secondly, one of our sushi rolls had a hair on it. And lastly, our dessert tiramisu was COVERED in green and black mold on the bottom. The best part was that we were expected to pay for the whole meal and we had to negotiate for a small discount. Absolutely appalling, would never have believed it if I hadn't experienced it myself. Never again."}
{"text":"Really great sushi! The restaurant is clean, the owner is very friendly, and the sushi and sashimi are very fresh, the presentation of the food is beautiful, and the price is reasonable. It is definitely a small and yet intimate place to go."}
{"text":"This is our second time at this location.  The first time was during the Thanksgiving weekend.  Service was mediocre at best.  Meat items were good just don't order anything with crab meat as they use fake crab meat.  Went there last Sunday for a late lunch and this would probably be our last.  Service was miserable.  We were waiting for an hour for 2/3 of our orders but they never came.  Our server did not even approach us as they were just busy wiping down the bar and tables.  When asked, our server even acted surprised.  We lost our appetite after that.  Although we were given a 10% discount, it still was not worth the time and money spent there.  A lot of competition in that area and unless they make drastic changes, their grand opening will quickly turn into a grand closing."}
{"text":"Alright, so 1st recommendation...make reservations, we stopped in around 7pm.  We waited 30 minutes approximately.  But let me give you the rundown.  The menu has drinks with prices, everything else is numbered and you choose what you want.  Staff was pretty nice.  Venue decor pretty chill.  They were missing some of the unique stuff like uni.  But they definitely made it up with the sashimi they had.  Huge servings for salmon.  I would love to tell you about the tuna, but they never brought out our 40 pieces of tuna.  They may have mixed up orders as well.  But finishing off with some mango, strawberry, vanilla ice cream, all you can eat was fulfilling.  Now paying for it this morning...lol.  try this place, it's one of the better places for sushi in calgary.  Stay hungry my friends...."}
{"text":"I've been here twice, both times in a group and they seem to do better when the group is a more manageable number (around 6 at the table).The food is what you would expect from an all you can eat sushi joint, palatable. Passable as food, nothing to wow you but is good value at their lunch price. I would caution you on the wasabi though, they seem to prepare them either in the morning or the night before and serve them at any given time of day. Which unfortunately means you get a dry crusted wasabi paste that no amount of soy sauce can reconstitute."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to try this when our favourite spot, Ikemen, was closed at the time of our visit. They are only a few doors apart. Well... what a pleasant surprise!! We enjoyed it so much last month that we went back again this past weekend. Our server both visits was Shirley! She is super delightful! The food is so fresh, hot and amazingly tasty! There are so many menu options. Go before 3 and it is $17.95 for all you can eat Thai and sushi! We have tried a quarter of the menu now and have love everything we have tried. So far our favs are the Fusion sushi and the delicate tempura shrimp. Shirley recommended we try her fav; the fried wonton cheese balls and yup! Yummy! A must try restaurant if you like variety of sushi, Thai, soups and appies"}
{"text":"Sushi here is awful. They can't even get the california rolls right, and it's one of the most simple rolls! The crab sticks they use in it are disgusting and the sushi rice is ALWAYS mushy and gross. The menu is incredibly limited for the sushi section as well. 

Every server looks like they'd rather be anywhere else but here and they act the same way, too. 

Plates are sometimes decorated with fish tank ornaments that are absolutely massive and take up so much space (and are incredibly ugly and unnecessary). 

Price is not worth what you get. Every food item I ordered was sub par and lacked any flavour."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, great service. Suggested first order, Dragon Fruit Roll and Fairy Tale In Autumn."}
{"text":"Valentine's Day.  Our group decided to try our luck and see if we could make a reservation for dinner and they took it down without hassle.  However, when we arrived at 6:30pm (the time of our reservation) I noticed about 50 people waiting at the front... we were on a full list of reservations and were given a numbering sequence to sort out the order of seating.  Why bother taking reservations if you decide to overbook like that? We were on the 9th place at 6:40pm and had to wait who knows how long to actually sit down... yeah, we left.  I wasn't the only one complaining but didn't have the patience like others to wait.  The place was fully booked and no one looked like they were close to finish. 

Really bad business tactics, and this has deterred me from trying them out ever again."}
{"text":"Lovely lunch spot. Took over old Sushi Club location on Kensington road. Decor is clean, bright and a very low inviting sushi bar greets you along the wall in full view as you enter. Two large TV screens behind the chef; one with the menu, one a tv show I'd not seen before. Photos of the menu items were mesmerizing. A dozen tables for 2 or 4 people fill the restaurant. 

As I can eat a lot of sushi and sashimi, I have to clear up the understanding of gluten free/celiac with the staff right away so I can read the menu properly. Gluten free rice wine vinegar used in their sushi rice. We confirmed on the box. Sadly the California roll is not, (imitation crab), however they do have a gluten free soy sauce if you do not want to bring your own. It's a sweeter taste than my usual brand. Not bad, just different.

On the day of our visit they were out of Ika (squid, and my favourite) since my coworker was on a food adventure - I try to introduce her to a new sashimi every time we dine, we opted for hamachi (yellowtail). Our combo came with surf clam (hokkaigai), a second new meat for her to try, and it did not disappoint. Steamed perfectly. Tooth tender and not chewey at all. Texture of all the sashimi was good. Fresh, or well thawed and prepared. 

A large and unique variety of rolls and house creations. 

Ramen as well that looks great but isn't usually gluten free so I can't comment on it. 

Tea was delicious, and very hot. Seldom were our cups empty. Water served was lemon water today. Not that Calgary has bad tap water to hide, (ok, sometimes in the spring), it was refreshing. 

We'll be back to explore other menu items soon!"}
{"text":"I went with a bunch of students who frequent this all-you-can-eat venue. Service was great. Staff was friendly and it was easy to catch their attention. We received almost everything we ordered and no attitude to our requests for more sashimi.

The menu is a lot smaller than Oishii (Riverbend). There is no seaweed salad, soft shell crab, chopped scallop, oysters, etc. But, you get all the salmon sashimi you want. 

I liked the salmon sashimi, any of the skewers (chicken, shrimp in particular), pad thai, and the shrimp tempura. The salmon tasted fresh. I felt like we got our $30 bucks worth here. 

I didn't try the tuna sashimi because it was white as snow... the people we ate with said it was good. The rolls were too saucy and the rice wasn't the best. In summary, if you're a student with a healthy appetite, you'll like this place. I personally try not to eat-all-I-can eat, so this won't be a frequent stop for me."}
{"text":"Just do do not go here!
1. Quality of the dishes are low with expensive price:you can find scale and fishbone in salmon sashimi 
And sand in surf clam sashimi 
2. The variety of the dishes are small
3. The plate is not clean
If you compare this sushi with other sushi restaurant like Oishii sushi, you will know how bad the fusion sushi is. You guys can try by yourself!"}
{"text":"Went here with a group of 12 for all-you-can-eat sushi 
the sushi is OK, not spectacular and I would probably give 3 stars if it wasn't for the tuna sashimi.
I ordered 8 each of salmon and tuna sashimi. they came all on one plate and that's fine but the tuna was as white as the background on this site and almost perfectly rectangular. I've eaten a lot of tuna sashimi in almost every well rated place in Calgary and Edmonton as well as locations in Asia and have NEVER seen white color tuna. I questioned it and was told that is \"white tuna sir\"...BULLSHIT!!! it didn't look like tuna, didn't taste like any tuna I've ever had, IT IS NOT TUNA!!! I'd guess pollock at best, the same crap that fake crab is made from. 
It's bad enough that you served that crap, but to lie to your patrons and tell them something like that?!?!
I will not recommend anyone go here, EVER!!!"}
{"text":"Came here for AYCE on Saturday for dinner. For two people plus a bottle of sake it cost about $80. Price is comparable other all you can eat sushi restaurants. Food came out quick not much waiting and the waiters were friendly but didn't speak much English. Menu consist of a variety of sashimi, sushi, rolls and hot food. Portion sizes are good. Don't forget to try the deep fried milk for dessert with vanilla ice cream.... A must try!!!!"}
{"text":"I spent the evening with my wife and friends there. We were celebrating her birthday. 

So, I went there a couple of nights before asking if I could make a reservation. A very polite lady helped me and did all for me. 

Then I bought one roll just to try it and I liked it.

So we all went the next week and the attention was amazing, the food was amazing. Very good variety, different types of flavours. 

My only con will be, rolls are small so you would most likely need to order more than one roll.

Totally recommended"}
{"text":"We went here with 6 of us for dinner earlier this week. All in all, it is good value for your money.  I am not sure what people expect out of a AYCE sushi restaurant, but this definitely was of good value.   All the sashimi was quite large and great (also rare to have AYCE sashimi!), while the sushi pieces are smaller but are decent for what they are.  Rolls were good, some were better then others for sure but all pretty good.  As for cooked food, we mostly had tempura which was great and some cooked meats which were all tasty.  

The only negatives would be that our empty dishes did start piling up, but we also had enough water and the speed was decent for having only two chefs.  

Overall, it is great value for what you pay.  Obviously some of the quality is going to be average but you should know that going in or go elsewhere and pay for the better quality."}
{"text":"My friend and I came here looking for a quick sushi fix since we were right around the corner. Unfortunately, both my friend and I were very disappointed, as the customer service was terrible, and the food was mediocre at best. Not worth it, skip this restaurant."}
{"text":"One of the worst places I've been to.. bad service and the food came really slow. We ordered 3 rounds and the other 2 rounds didn't seem to come as quick or didn't come at all. We had to tell the waiter to bring our food, if not, we wouldn't have received it. On the menu it says that the shrimp teriyaki came in 2 pieces and we ordered 5 sets so I expected 10pcs but there was only 6pcs when it came?? Very disorganized and we felt like we were ignored or didn't receive as much attention.The place was also expensive for a place that served fake crab. I would not recommend this place to a friend or coming back."}
{"text":"This place has the freshest sashimi in an all you can eat restaurant! Everything in the restaurant was good!"}
{"text":"Really good service and the all you can eat is ridiculous. The tuna and salmon sashimi were the best I've ever had. Salmon sometimes feels a bit stringy but not here, it was super soft. Would eat here every day if I could!"}
{"text":"Do you ever get in the situation where you're with a group of people and no one can decide what to have for dinner? Somehow I ended up at fusion for sushi and all of us regretted it. 

One of my habits that I have is Checking out  washrooms facilities in a restaurant.  I always take note of the cleanliness of restrooms because I believe that gives me a good indication on how clean the kitchen is. If I had done this before sitting down to eat sushi I would have left. Unfortunately for me I was starving and my companions were in the same state.  Some major TLC was needed in the facilities! 

The particular evening that I had visited this establishment happened to be quite busy. That still shouldn't have effected the lack of Service that we received. It felt like we were cattle being herded to a table and rushed to leave as quick as we arrived.  To the point that we were receiving orders of items that we hadn't even selected. It seemed as if whatever sushi was made showed up on the table,  thankfully the group of people I was with are quite adventurous and willing to try anything. It became more of an annoyance then anything.   

As the evening went on amused at the variety of sushi showing up at our table going through the menu trying to figure out what was showing up on the table we noticed that the numbers that we requested on the order slip would get reversed. We weren't dealing with random sushi showing up at our table or another tables order, NO! the kitchen staff or server was having dyslexic tendencies. Cucumber rolls number 49  no I'm sorry you're going to enjoy number 94 rainbow roll...

 Full and frustrated!"}
{"text":"Ate here on a Monday night. It wasn't too busy when we went in but it got very busy soon. Ordering is all done on an iPad, which worked well although I was a little sceptical at first. No room for mistakes though and it came fairly quickly or at least in a decent space of time.
The curried chicken cutlet was my favorite, just the right amount of spice and the sauce was incredible. The Pad Thai was excellent, smokey taste and not too sweet or tangy. It wasn't highly spiced but that suits me fine.
The Spring rolls were excellent too
The piece de resistance was the sushi dish I ordered. It was a medley of different sushi  and it was really excellent.
I made the mistake of eating a hot chilli bean that came with the General Tsao chicken....aargh...very hot...Soo had to have mango ice cream to cool the fires....all in all a great dining experience."}
{"text":"Not to be confused with the AYCE with the same down the street, Fusion Sushi offers quality sushi. I've walked by the store front many times on my way to Hayden Block but never thought to try it until hubby and I had a hankering for good sushi. 

They weren't busy on a Saturday night but I saw lots of people taking out. In terms of offerings, there's nothing special about their menu that sets them apart from other Japanese restaurants but the quality is better. I really enjoyed their tempura, and especially the sushi rice. It wasn't too vinegary or soft. They are also honest about the quality of their fish, like when they refused to serve me ikura because they felt it was past its prime. Points for integrity and not giving me diarrhea! 

The server was also attentive and made sure we were satisfied with our meal. Our bill came to $60 which was fairly reasonable for sushi. 

I used to think Fusion Sushi was out of place among the hustle and bustle of Kensington, but it's actually a nice place for a romantic quiet evening. I'll definitely return some day to this gem."}
{"text":"Good place for sushi. All you can eat sushi at lunch does not have the same number of selections as dinner menu."}

{"text":"Stopped by for lunch with a friend on a Monday afternoon and it was pretty quiet. I've been to their other location and it seems that this one has fewer food options, which might just be because it opened up only recently? The food was mostly mediocre - the udon tasted like nothing and a lot of the other dishes were incredibly bland. They also don't offer sashimi, and the salmon slices on the nigiri that we ordered was dry and poorly sliced, so I'm a little dubious as to the quality of the food you're getting for the price (especially if you show up for dinner, which is so much more expensive). The tempura was yummy and I also enjoyed the mango and spicy salmon hand rolls. Otherwise, everything was pretty standard. I wouldn't expect anything memorable, but it's a convenient and decent place to stop by if you're super hungry and strolling around 17th."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came to check out this place because of reviews, it wasn't as good as we anticipated it to be. 

We ordered takoyaki and it came out microwaved. Miso soup was loaded with salt. An employee came in long after we ordered and the chef prepared her sushi before preparing ours which was quite a disappointment since we came on a Sunday night and were the only customers there. 

The sushi was quite a let down, terribly plated. Sashimi served in an awkward plant display bowl. There are better places to have sushi at. Not a place I'd recommend personally."}
{"text":"I came here for the lunch AYCE ($15.99) which is a reasonable price, but one of the things that I quickly noticed about their menu was that they lacked variety. All the sushi (nigiri, rolls, hand cones..) were the same (salmon, tuna, crab meat, spicy salmon, spicy tuna, spicy crab meat). The salmon nigiris were so thinly sliced that I thought it as better off to have ordered the spicy salmon, where the cuts were a lot more generous.

This is a good place for a quick and cheap \"sushi fix\" where you want quantity over quality. But what threw me off was our treatment at the end of our meal. We had 2 pieces of nigiris and 2 pieces from a roll left that we just could not finish. We were going to leave it. Now I am fully aware that AYCE establishments have a policy where you get charged for leftovers that are not finished. I know this is a way to prevent people from over-ordering and wasting food. But with a minimal amount of food left, it was clear that we were not wasting food on purpose. One of the male servers (possibly management) approached us as we were getting up to go pay, and told us that we would be charged for wasting food. We were totally thrown off by this. I've been to a handful of AYCE restaurants, and never have I been told this before. Fusion Sushi definitely has some strict policy going on. We just couldn't finish our food, so we opted to pay for the remaining, while deciding that we would pay for the leftover 4 rolls but not return again. I hope Fusion Sushi learns that returning customers are more valuable than 4 pieces of sushi rolls."}
{"text":"This restaurant is quite alright indeed. I was been a bit concerned due to the reviews that I'd read on this and word-of-mouth, but alas on December 24, not a single other place was open for lunch so off we went. 

The restuarant was empty, and the decor was pleasant and so was the service. The IPAD ordering was very straightforward, and overall it was a very accessible ordering process. 

For $19, the selection of AYCE for lunch was pretty diverse. Sure, you don't get the sashimi and a lot of fancy sushi, but you get the great staples such as the salmon avocado roll, which is superb for fish quantity, they didn't skimp on the salmon at all. Overall, the food quality was reasonable for the price, and there were no issues with the fish. The tempura left something to be desired, but overall it wasn't offensive.

While generally I only go for sushi at AYCE, their extended menu which included thai food was also pretty attractive. 

From a value-quality ratio perspective, I think Fusion is pretty good. I would definitely go again, considering that if I were to order 20$ worth of sushi I'd get less value than if I just spent $20 on the AYCE. 

Overall I definitely think the negativity that I assumed was overblown. This is a solid restaurant. I definitely would go back."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time a week ago and did not like it at all. I went with a friend and we went around 4 pm. When we got there, the staff were quite disorganized and we didn't even get any water until after our food came which was about 15-20 mins. The food was mediocre. My friend got fried rice which she hated, because it was hard and brittle (like the bottom of a rice cooker). I ordered a Thai curry which was ok, the chicken was weird because it felt like it was left for days. Also they gave us tea that we didn't ask for but charged us for. It just wasn't a great experience and I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Had dinner here last night and i felt that the sashimi was especially delicious last night, great customer service, love the amount of selection they have too. Even if you have someone in your family or group of friends that do no enjoy sushi there are also a good amount of non seafood sushi and other delicious asian dishes to be had!
Only complaints I have is that they always forget some of your orders, out of an entire list of orders throughout the night they will forget a couple, but if you just let your server know they will grab it for you at that moment. My last complaint is of the amount parking space, it is always a struggle to find parking space. 
Even though I have complaints, they arent too major for me to stop coming here for all you can eat sushi and sashimi! 
Also be sure to make reservation if you have a big group or if its a weekend! Be sure to check this place out!"}
{"text":"Service was amazing, the staff were all so friendly and attentive. The food was delicious and well presented. I would recommend trying out the BBQ squid and the seared salmon. Other than that the sushi was all pretty good. The restaurant is quite small so be sure to make reservation just to be on te safe!"}
{"text":"The food was not good. Their salad was drenched in dressing, green curry was just gross, and sushi was covered with sauce. I normally like sauce, but you just need a little drizzle, they loaded almost all their sushi with the crazy sugary sauce. 

We called for the server on the iPad, and waited for 15 minutes, so we just waved her over, she seemed upset that we didn't eat all the food, but I should've just been honest and told her the food wasn't good."}
{"text":"Extremely poor service. 

My family made a reservation with them at 7PM for 12 people. When we arrived I checked in and the lady at the counter seemed like she was confused, confirmed that we did make the reservation and told a coworker beside her. He then proceeded to say in Chinese: \"Doesn't matter if they're here. They still have to wait.\" Right in front of me assuming I don't understand and no one got back to me at all about how long it'll be or at least a \"yes we'll have a table for you in a moment\"  

About 10-15 minutes later I then asked another worker how long do you think the wait will be. He told me to hold on and went to find someone else and found the same person as before who said 'doesn't matter if they're here' he asked the boy who found him and said 'what do you want' and then, nothing. Nothing as in no one got back to me, completely ignored and left again without a word. 

Did a walk around the restaurant and saw that nearly all the big tables had people who just sat down or people that have not even started eating yet, waiting for their food. Not wanting to wait an hour after our reservation, we left. 

So the point is, if you come to this chain, even though you made a reservation, it doesn't matter because they won't care if you're here and you still have to wait possibly half an hour to an hour. Possibly ignored when you ask them for service too. What they should do is just take the reservation option off and advertise themselves as first come, will serve you later instead."}
{"text":"Second times the charm. Their mix of music confused me, Keisha and Lil Wayne are perfect for sushi aren't they? Finally got my sashimi fix this time around. Much better experience :) The cuts of sashimi kept changing sizes and counts, no matter how much we ordered. The servers didn't tell us if there were limits to each order, each time we ordered 8 pieces of salmon sashimi, but some times we would get 12... or 6... 

Thai food comes in large portions. Too much for two people if you're wanting to try a variety of dishes. 

Overall, good experience, highly recommend you to go for dinner vs lunch; much more worth it."}
{"text":"As a frequent guest of the McKnight location, I was truly excited to see this location of Fusion All You Can Eat Sushi and Thai opening up in Kensington in the old Osteria de Medici location.

I went in for lunch which was a bit more than the McKnight location but still reasonably priced at $17.95 for the all you can eat sushi and Thai menu. Al a carte is also available.

The restaurant was quiet during my visit. I am not certain many people know about this new location as it is not yet on the internet anywhere that I can find. Hopefully once their web presence picks up, so will their business.

The service I had her was highly attentive and fantastic. Sometimes at the McKnight location service can be lacking but it seems as though they have made a point to ensure that is not the case here.

All the rolls and sushi I had was fresh, delivered extremely fast and was of very good quality. I would highly recommend you try out the special rolls - delicious! They also don't seem to load you up excessively on the rice with the sushi and rolls as some all you can eat places tend to do.

If this location keeps up with the great service and quality that I experienced I imagine there will be line ups here in no time!"}
{"text":"I frequent here. Good food for good lunch prices! One of my favourites! Clean and good service!"}
{"text":"The fish is smelly here, which isnt a good sign. I have had better at middle-of-nowhere sushi restaurants. Spare yourself the belly ache."}
{"text":"Come with an appetite, the food is crazy good!

I had the opportunity to be taken to Fusion on a dinner date, and it's now hands down one of my favourites. I had never been before and so my dining partner explained to me how to order. You are given menus and order forms, and can choose to order as much as you want of whatever you want, as long as you can finish it in 90 minutes. All orders are delivered to you by the servers so it's not your traditional self-serve buffet, which I thought was neat (that being said, it's also a little pricier than your traditional buffet).

Our teriyaki beef had been pretty over cooked but seeing as the other 95% of the meal was absolutely delicious and the staff was great, it was forgiven. I will be returning for future date nights!"}
{"text":"Awesome place! Great sushi! Can be quite busy at dinner hour. Get there a little early!"}
{"text":"Fusion sushi is o.k. The miso soup was standard, seaweed salad was on its last legs ( a little to close to expiration for me when it starts to have a gluey texture). The sashimi was presented with an ice sculpture ( kinda cool). Spicy tuna roll needed more spice, philly roll was tough grainy salmon, the special veggie roll was very nice. Doesn't compare to sushi club which dominated this space previously. Not sure why all the hype on this place"}
{"text":"Excellent all you can eat Sushi. We had a business lunch there and tried many different rolls that were all excellent. Price is reasonable and the entire staff works hard to make the experience enjoyable."}
{"text":"Been twice now and it's petty terrible.   Tables are sticky, rolls are sloppy. The pics on the really dirty ipads look great then when food comes out, nothing is recognizable."}
{"text":"AVOID AVOID AVOID

Seriously.... hate the downtown location too. Thought maybe a different location would mean different quality. NOPE
Ordered takeout from skip the dishes and 17th ave location.
They didn't even send soy sauce, Wasabi, or ginger...even tho I paid for extra ginger.
Both special requests were ignored (no seaweed in soup, no fish eggs on roll)
All food soggy and slimy (even tho it was delivered in a timely manner)

Then when I called to have the things missed sent along, I was dealt with in a very unhelpful and dismissive manner.

WILL NEVER ORDER FROM ANY LOCATION EVER. SAVE YOUR MONEY AND DISAPPOINTMENT. 

GROSS"}
{"text":"I love, love, love this place!   Busy all the time.  I've been there about 6 times and there will be more.  I love that it's all you can eat (for $18 at lunch), but each item comes individually prepared.  You just look through the menu, mark what you want on a sheet, and voila - Thai food, japanese food... what's not to love?  I prefer tapas to a meal, so this is perfect for me.  And they have free parking in Kensington!!  I mean, that is hard to find!"}
{"text":"Step into Fusion Sushi and you will think you have died and gone to Sushi heaven.

All you can eat. Yes, I said it. All you can eat.

You play one flat rate (I believe it was $12.99) and you can order anything and as much as you want off the menu. 

If you ordered the california rolls, you would receive two smallish rolls. Which is good because that would give you a chance to try the spicy tuna pizza. Or the sweet potato tempura. Or the pad thai. 

Each dish is served in small quantities so you can have a lot of different options. The service was quick, friendly and helpful. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"The mango roll was very good!! This cozy place in Kensington has a good sushi, and a very friendly service... I really enjoyed it, and would recommend it..."}
{"text":"In terms of sushi, they have a decent selection of maki. Well worth the lunch all you can eat price. The lunch menu is extensive and they have a number of Thai items to choose from"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this all you can eat sushi place the rolls were flavourful and well presented. The salmon sashimi was buttery and we ate a tonne of it. The bbq squid was awesome probably some of the best I have ever had. I really don't have many complaints other than the fact that some of the food didn't come out no big deal just order again I think they just forgot. We will definitely go back again"}
{"text":"We had good food and great service at the Fusion Sushi in Kensington so we came here expecting the same. Big mistake! 

The food was okay. The service was not good at all. They seemed extremely confused by my allergies (simply asked for nothing to have sesame on it). The worst part of all was that the restaurant smelled so bad!!! We were seated in the back portion of the restaurant towards the bar and I'm really not sure if that was the washroom or the kitchen but either way it made the meal absolutely unpleasant. We'll probably be back at Fusion- but not this location."}
{"text":"Fusion Sushi in Kensington is pretty great! The service was quick and the staff were very careful and attentive with my orders given my various allergies. The food was all well presented. Although it's not the best sushi ever, it's pretty great for an all you can eat joint! 

Prices are very reasonable and the restaurant is well taken care of."}
{"text":"This is my second time coming to Fusion Sushi at lunch time.  $16.99 for their all-you-can-eat lunch menu.  A good variety of Japanese and Thai items.  Personally, I prefer their Japanese food to their Thai food, but hey, its all you can eat, so no harm in trying it for yourself to see if you like it right???  Service is friendly and fast.  Your food comes out quickly.  Again, try not to over-order, because like most all-you-can-eat establishments, you'll be charged for any excess you don't eat.  So order something manageable and keep ordering a few more items at a time until you know you can't eat another bite!  I'm usually not a fan of all-you-can-eat, because I find the price is a little expensive, but their lunch price and menu is very reasonable, so I highly recommend going for lunch!"}
{"text":"This location just opened up on 17th Ave.  The space is nice and large enough for big groups.  The menu is has a good variety to choose from.  There's an efficient electronic ordering system...you pick and click and a few minutes later, food is on your table.  The service was pretty good, consistent clearing of our plates and filling of our water glasses.  The best items we found were the beef short rib, sashimi (decent thick pieces), sushi rolls, shrimp tempura and dessert (Mango pudding and yogurt, plus ice cream...pretty decent selection).  We also ordered the chicken wings, which I enjoyed, nice and crispy.  Other items such as beef tataki, dumplings, deep fried chicken nuggets were in our opinion, just ok.  We did try the pad-tai and was not a big fan, although, the portion is small, easy to finish, so if you'd like to try for yourself, go for it!

It's $26.95 for all you can eat dinner menu. Although its not the most mind blowing meal you'll ever have, food comes out quick and service in our experience was good.  As with all \"all you can eats\", its about what you order, the menu is extensive enough to sample various dishes which will allow you to determine which dishes are the best and keep ordering those."}
{"text":"The best sushi place I have ever tried in Calgary!!! The fish is fresh and special. Try their fusion roll there. The lemon and tomato are quite matched! I do like the Unagi and the mango! Dragon roll is amazing! I know you'll like spicy tuna as well! The ice sculpture is so cute! Try their takoyaki and the green tea gelato! Hope it's helpful and enjoy your meal! Xoxo"}
{"text":"Slow service, half our food never came, never once offered to refill drinks. Rolls were ok, wonton soup was just dumplings in hot water."}
