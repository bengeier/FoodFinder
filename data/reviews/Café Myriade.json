{"text":"This stylish café is one of the cozier spots downtown for coffee with a friend. It has a small selection of delicious pastries, and the service is excellent. A big thank you to Sarah for always being so welcoming."}
{"text":"Coffee is great, pastries are very fresh. Enjoyed it very much. Not to mention, great service."}
{"text":"I went there on 7/2/15 to get some croissants.  They were so good.  Fresh and flaky. I was happy with what I got at that time, but I went to several other places and I realized that their prices are high..."}
{"text":"Low key cafe located downstairs of the club monaco stores, the only way to get there is through club monaco. Very professional and cosy place for quick meetings, it is not a place for studying or chilling long hours..myriad is good overall Gone up from concordians' favourite , now to partnering with club monaco and targeting professionals ..very smart business"}
{"text":"This place was a little hard for me to find at first, but after walking back and forth past Club Monaco and having the Google Maps dot consistently tell me I was at the cafe, I finally realized that I was, in fact, above the cafe.   Located in the basement of the retail store, this little shop almost blends right in. As you walk down the spiralling stairs, the smell of coffee from the floor below greets you immediately. The marble accents and little single tables make the whole area feel pretty upscale; with the free wifi and good lighting, it makes for a great working environment!   The staff were friendly and quick. I got a latte, and the latte art was cute! I didn't get any pastries, but there were a few available. Considering the nice downtown location and overall vibe, I'll probably come back soon!"}
{"text":"Wandered in here after walking down Rue Sainte. An incredibly clean and beautiful shop. It's hidden inside Club Monaco, which might scare some people but the quiet and inviting atmosphere makes it more than comfortable. The coffee was fantastic, had a V60 pour; it was impeccably smooth and chocolatey. I was recommended to visit this shop by a friend and I would do the same to anyone who asked for coffee in Montreal."}
{"text":"Magnifique café situé dans le tout nouveau Club Monaco. Ce n'est pas un endroit où vous pourrez étudier pendant des heures, car les tables sont petites et que c'est assez bruyant, mais il y a tant d'autres avantages!  Le plus important : le café en soi est si délicieux, mais ça, on le savait déjà puisqu'il existe deux autres succursales du café Myriade. Je vous le dit, leurs produits en valent le détour! Les employés sont toujours hyper courtois et sympathiques, c'est génial. Il est également possible de feuilleter quelques revues et livres qui sont en vente au café. Puisque c'est un endroit où les gens ne restent généralement pas longtemps, il y a presque tout le temps de la place où s'asseoir pour prendre une petite pause de notre magasinage.   L'endroit est chaleureux et chaque petit détail est à couper le souffle... Regardez le joli plancher! Hihi.  Bref, un endroit où vous ne regretterez pas de vous être arrêté ou d'être passé chercher un café lors de votre visite au centre-ville."}
{"text":"A beautiful downstairs space in a Club Monaco store. Helpful, knowledgable and friendly staff. Delicious pastry selection, although the donut was bland. A great brewed coffee from a V60. Good drinking chocolate. A great place to get away from the noise of the street."}
{"text":"Another excellent specimen from the Myriad group. Get your excellent coffee always! Trust in the bean."}
{"text":"Dur a trouver a travers la boutique de linge. Je me sentais vramant mal d'etre mal habillé, mais meilleur café (au goût) a Montreal je pense."}
{"text":"Solid third wave coffee. I speak for the Americano. Excellent taste. Definitely one of the better spots in Montreal. Both locations are solid."}
{"text":"If you want to have a perfect espresso and croissant it really is a great and classy Cafe. I guess there is the drawback that it's in the middle of a retail store but doesn't really bother me ."}
{"text":"Difficile de trouver le café et presqu'impossible de s'asseoir puisqu'il manque de places et de tables. Ambiance un peu \" snob \" et c'est également situé dans un sous-sol donc aucune lumière du jour. Staff correct. Chai glaçé bon mais pas assez goûteux pas contre grand éventail de choix de lait sans lactose!"}
{"text":"It's a best location for shoppers to walk in club Monaco and to go downstairs. We enjoyed a break having a hot latte, filtered coffee and chai latte. Coffee were great with reasonable price. Small but cozy place."}
{"text":"A must try place when in Montreal. Very warm service, very good pastry and more. The atmosphere is very good too. A very quiet place that you will like."}
{"text":"This little cute coffee shop was a bit hard to find (located in the basement)...but once I was in it, I didn't want to leave. Ordered a green tea latte and a cupcake."}
{"text":"Myriade nous offre une troisième location à l'intérieur du nouveau Club Monaco sur Ste-Catherine. Bien qu'initialement j'ai questionné la décision d'ouvrir un second café dans le même secteur de la ville (la première location étant à Guy Concordia, pour les novices du #mtlcafecrawl), ça comble mon côté paresseux d'avoir accès au meilleur café de Montréal (voilà c'est dit!) sans avoir à faire un détour après mon magasinage.   Les magasineux du centre-ville sont maintenant très choyés avec une grande sélections de cafés indépendants ayant fait leur apparition cette année (je me crois encore en 2014, laissez-moi faire mon deuil). Par contre, le nouveau Myriade gagne sur plusieurs points: Directement sur la rue Ste-Catherine, au milieu des magasins, le café est là, sur notre chemin, au moment où l'envie nous frappe. Pas à 8 minutes de marche. L'ambiance est détendue et amicale, une belle décoration qui nous donne envie de regarder partout et aller piner tout ce qu'on voit sur Pinterest, des baristas souriants plein d'amour, les produits frais et locaux d'Hof Kelsten, Société Orignal et Rhubarbe, mais surtout, un cappucino soyeux, bien équilibré et qui nous donne le ''pep'' pour terminer notre session de magasinage au milieu de l'hiver sibérien qui nous gèle les orteils.  Par contre, l'endroit a clairement été fait pour prendre une pause brève de l'animosité de la grande rue; le wi-fi n'est pas disponible et les tables sont très petites. On ne prévoit donc pas s'y installer durant des heures pour faire des travaux ou écrire un review sur Yelp, par exemple. Sauf quand tu t'appelles Audrey Rose et que tu en fais qu'à ta tête. Voilà, ça aussi c'est dit."}
{"text":"Cute coffee shop. Very friendly staff. Great latte, delicious croissants and cookies too. It is located inside the Club Monaco store (on basement level), which we thought was a bit weird and hard to find, but also different. The decor is very unique and stylish."}
{"text":"Cafe Myriade is a coffee shop that has several locations in Montreal.  They work with the 49th Parallel Roasters that's based out in Vancouver and offer a variety of pastries from local bakers.  This particular location is located downstairs of Club Monaco - yes, the clothing boutique!  When you enter the store, make your way over to the stairs and just go on down.  You will find Cafe Myriade with coffee beans that are being sold as well as a small menu of hot/cold beverages and some pastries.  I had a Chai Latte as well as a chocolate croissant - the chai latte was okay, a little less sweet and slightly watered down; the chocolate croissant was not buttery, but more on the dry side.  The chocolate within was not melted at all, and it was just a small stick of chocolate.  There was no offering of heating the croissant up, so it was a little disappointing.  The cafe itself is cute, and I loved the teal cup that the drink was served.  There were some seats available where you can enjoy your beverage and/or do some work.  +located downstairs of Club Monaco +not-so-fresh croissants +watered down Chai Latte"}
{"text":"Great little cafe. They had a special pumpkin spice latte that I really loved! We went here a few times while in town and will return during our next trip to MTL."}
{"text":"My favourite chic coffee shop in downtown Montreal. It's hidden in the basement of Club Monaco. The espresso is very aromatic, the full bodied taste brings out a cocoa kind of taste."}
{"text":"Such a cute little cafe tucked downstairs. Yesterday was a rainy day and the perfect weather that called for a warm tea and coffee break. Staff was friendly and although a small place, it was cozy and relaxing. I would recommend it if you're shopping on Saint Catherine's in Montreal."}
{"text":"Great coffee sourced from some of the best roasters in the US and Canada (Intelligentsia, 49th parallel, and a few others). Great lattes, cold brew and drink coffee.  This location in particular (downstairs, in club monaco) has a chic vibe, with a wonderfully curated selection of books for sale."}
{"text":"Petit café coquet et discret, situé au sous-sol du magasin Club Monaco rue Ste-Catherine.  Peu de places pour s'asseoir mais chaleureux endroit sympa.  Excellent café 49e Parallèle, bien exécuté.  Je le recommande! :)"}
{"text":"Upscale little coffee shop in the basement of Club Monaco (clothing/department store).  I wanted an afternoon coffee and a pastry and this looked promising on Yelp, so I decided to give it a try.  Would have been a little easier had I known it was in the basement level of Club Monaco, but hey, that can be the fun of searching out a new place sometimes.  It's a small spot with a handful of tables and a limited amount of pastries.  It's appointed very nicely with a lot of the original buildings finishes of iron and marble.  I opted for an Espresso and a Croissant, which was a perfect afternoon treat.  The coffee was superb and the croissant flaky and buttery.  After a day of traveling it was a nice place to unwind."}
{"text":"This location of Café Myriade is among my favorite coffee shops in the city!  Located on the lower level of Club Monaco, the space's decor is beautiful, inviting and private, sitting only 10 people at a time. The noise level is usually low, creating a calm and peaceful atmosphere. Shelves whose back panels are mirrors feature a selection of books from Drawn and Quarterly available to browse and purchase. Being a book worm myself, it's one of the features that keep me coming back for more.  The coffee is perfect and the lemonade is pretty good as well. The service is always courteous and professional.   The only aspect which could use improvement in my humble opinion is the food/pastry selection which is meager. Knowing this, my husband and I come primarily for coffee and lemonade, so all is well.  Two thumbs up, we love it and we'll keep on visiting!"}
{"text":"This location is almost hidden inside club Monaco but you just have to walk to the back and down the staircase where you'll find this adorable little cafe. You can just follow your nose too since you get that great coffee scent as soon as you walk in club Monaco. There isn't a huge amount of seats but there are a few , although to me this may be more of a pick up and go sort of place. The staff was so pleasant and the coffee is great ! My go to is usually their cold brew (at least during the warmer months) and I recently discovered their lemonade which I LOVED (fresh lemon, ginger and honey) it was so refreshing and delicious and not something you find everywhere. They also have some great looking pastries (donuts, brownie, cookies etc )."}
{"text":"J'adore ce petit café caché au sous-sol du magasin Club Monaco sur Ste-Catherine. Non seulement j'aime ce magasin mais c'est aussi une bonne excuse pour moi de descendre prendre une petite pause dans ce petit coin adorable quand je fais mon shopping au centre-ville. Ils offrent de très bon cafés et leur viennoiseries bien qu'il n'y ait pas beaucoup de choix sont excellentes. Elles proviennent de la boulangerie Hof Kelsten. Le café est assez petit avec de petites tables, donc il n'y a pas beaucoup de places pour ceux qui voudraient rester là à étudier ou travailler. Il n'y a pas de wifi mais vous pouvez toujours venir siroter votre café tout en feuilletant un des nombreux livres qu'ils ont à la disposition de tous."}
{"text":"I only care for the coffee, but if you want to snap or cellfie yourself with expertly crafted coffee with pretty latte art, pretty local pastry, and pretty Montrealites all while Insta-modeling Ralph Lauren's down-wallet mid-priced casual urban prepster clothes so you can hashtag to the foodies and the fashionistas, this is probs one of the first places in MTL that should come to mind. Gets crowded tho w others that have the same idea, so be prepared for standing-room-selfies-only cuz there's more merchandise racks than tables here."}
{"text":"I stumbled in here accidentally and I'm glad I did. I ordered a latte and an apple turnover. The cafe latte was delicious and had a beautiful design on it. The pastry was flaky and scrumptious. However the location is strange and feels a bit stuck up or pretentious. The tables are tiny and there is no wifi. It's good for a quick coffee or snack but not for hanging out and reading a book or doing work."}
{"text":"Aussi bien caché qu'un bar à cocktail et une déco cosy-classy entre le bar trendy et le coffee shop. On y déguste un expresso parfait en bouquinant une sélection de livres de Drawn and Quaterly, la référence librairistique du Mile End et même de Montréal."}
{"text":"BEST ESPRESSO I'VE EVER HAD!!! This is a small coffee shop hidden inside a shop, in the basement of Club Monaco. The decor is very cozy, beautiful atmosphere. It's small and lovely. It's a small place so you can study in peace and smell the coffee in the air. Perfect! Just one thing. Small tables. That's my only complaint!"}
{"text":"This place was a little hard to find, as its in the basement of a Club Monaco and there are very few signs to point you in the right direction. Despite this location, the cafe itself was very nicely set up, airy, and open. I ordered a chai latte, and was happy to see a wide variety of plant-based milks!! (They had almond, soy, oat, and macadamia). I will say it was a little pricey at $5 for a small mug, and they seemed to pre-sweeten their tea as I didn't add any sugar and it was quite sweet. I would have preferred a stronger chai flavour. At first when I got there it was fairly empty, but around 12pm it started to fill up and the line was nearly up the staircase, so it seems to be a pretty popular mid-day caffeine fix spot."}
