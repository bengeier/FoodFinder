{"text":"We are regulars here. A great little hardworking mom and pop dive. Nothing fancy but everything hits the spot. Prices are fair and portions are balanced. 

Homestyle Korean food.

Bonus, you can buy Kimchi and their marinated meats to cook up at home."}
{"text":"Went there because of the positive reviews, but... Probably one of the worst Korean food I've ever had, given there's not that many selections I guess you have no choice but live by"}
{"text":"Loved the service! Even though it was slightly slow, the lady was very cheerful and made you really feel like a valued customer. The food was decent as well. Definitely an option if you're in a rush and just want to find something fast to eat"}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of Korean food (id love to be but i cant eat too spicy stuff unfortunately) however i went to Korea and this place often enough to give a recommendation. Delicious homey cuisine, tasty appetizers, corn tea service, various choices of menu, reasonable price. 
It's worth to drive there, just to taste Korean food and shop in Kim phat to try cooking one by yourself?"}
{"text":"I heard so many great things about this restaurant from my Korean friend and my boyfriend so we finally all decided to go and give it a try. I was definitely not disappointed. This Korean restaurant is humble and small but packs a punch. We ordered vegetarian pancakes which were so tender and delicious. We also ordered a kimchi pajeon which was also delicious. It was crispy and mildly spicy! For our main dishes we ordered jap chae, soondubu jigae, some sort of honey flavored grilled chicken, and bulgogi. All were fantastic. My tofu stew was amazing and the portion size was just right. The jap chae was the best jap chae I've ever tried in my life, it had a salty and sweetish taste to it! My boyfriend's honey chicken dish was absolutely amazing...it had a hint of sweetness but still had that grilled chicken taste to it. Not to strong at all. All the portion sizes I noticed were just right...some restaurants give too much or too little food. I found Dae Jang Kum to give appropriate portions like Kazu. Service was excellent and friendly. This place was definitely authentic and really not pricey at all. Expect to spend 20$/less on a decent meal. They also sold stainless steel chopsticks from Korea! And they sell delicious kimchi for 4.50$ (small) and around 6.50$ (large).  If only this place was in Montreal...I'd be a regular."}
{"text":"This is an authentic Korean restaurant. It's a little mom and pop operation. The owner will warm up to you and is a gem. She absolutely loves people and has a special soft spot for children. All meals come with complimentary soup and appetizer (Kimchi (made by the owners mother) potatoes, and bean sprouts). All the food is result made in house. This is my go-to Korean restaurant!"}
{"text":"I went there because I wanted to dodge the traffic. It looked like a legit korean mom and pop shop, but i was disappointed with every single dish i ordered. 

The seafood pancake was full of fake crab. 

First and last time."}
{"text":"I had dinner there two days ago and its was AMAZING. Friendly service! We ordered haemul pajeaon, tteokbokki, dolsot bulgogi bibimbap and the dwegee bulgogi (my favorite dish among the four dishes I tried, it came with a bowl of rice, a plate of lettuce and samjang). The haemul pajeon was good too, a big portion with a lot of seafood. The tteokbokki wasn't spicy neither super red as it is suppose to be but it was still good. Strongly recommend this place.

P.S: the sauce for the bibimbap isn't really spicy so don't be afraid to put more than you usually would :)"}
{"text":"We order takeout from Dae Jang Kum at least once a month! It's a small family business and they cook homestyle korean food. Our favourites are the dolls bibimbap, the gable gooyi combo (grilled chicken) and all their pancakes! Prices are very reasonable, for 15$ per person you have a full meal. Each meal also comes with a selection of appetizers and a soup! They also make homemade Gochujang sauce and kimchi, which can be purchased there.  Absolutely recommend!"}
{"text":"Little restaurant serving homemade Korean food. Very delicious. Try the bulgogi or the short ribs beef. Great typical appetizers as well. Definitively worth a visit."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the food here. The food was good and the service as well. My mother and I ordered way too much food and had a lot for takeout. A bit on the sweet side, I would of prefer it more salty but that's just my personal preference. My mother thought it was spot on. Our seafood pancake came out a bit underdone and not hot enough. We asked the waitress to have it cooked more which she did without hesitation. She was very nice and sweet. We had an excellent service! At one point, my mom and the waitress and the waitress started chatting about Korean actors and movies. It was fun to see. I will most definitely come back since it's much closer to home then to have to drive all the way into Montreal ;)"}
