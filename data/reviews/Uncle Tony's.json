{"text":"Delicious pizza and pasta at a reasonable price! You have to try the butternut squash pasta. It's difficult to find Comfort food done right in Toronto, but we finally found our spot.
Been here several times and find it hard to leave as between the music, service and coziness it feels like a Saturday evening at home by the fireplace with your favorite people!"}
{"text":"Good food but the service was slow. We sat down at 5:30 and weren't served until 7:00.  Not good since we had theater tickets for 8:00."}
{"text":"So much more than pizza.  I was so pleasantly surprised to see Osso Buco with polenta on the menu.  It was delicious.  Our server was nice and attentive.   Would certainly return the next time I visit Toronto."}
{"text":"The pizza is delicious and cooked to perfection. Ask for their chili oil to dip your crust in, so tasty. The restaurant ambiance has a cozy, old world Italy feel to it... you just want to use your nose to roll a meatball off the top of your spaghetti over to your date while an old Italian dude serenades you with an accordion."}
{"text":"Great food, great service! The olive oil cake and basil ice cream is to die for! The menu is small, but i think that is what makes it a unique place."}
{"text":"Cute little place. Has the mood lighting that makes it good for date night.

The server (there was only one on the floor when we went) is super nice - attentive, helpful with suggestions and moved fast between the tables.

Food was ok...quite bland had the tomato salad, mozzarella sticks, chicken milanese and spaghetti/meatballs (everything needed salt and a few sprinkles of red chillies). Was expecting better flavor based on previous review. 

The place has a good location - walking distance from the Canadian Stage, Sony Centre and ACC so if  you want to get a quieter hangout spot before a play or a concert, then its a decent pick."}
{"text":"My company and I were hesitant to try Uncle Tony's due to the mixed reviews on Yelp. We decided to give it a try because the place had very cute retro vibe to it when we looked in from the outside window. 

We were worried about the service after reading all those mixed reviews, but our server was very professional and nice. We ordered a Vongole pasta dish and a potato pizza to share. Everything tasted amazing, and though I had not so high expectation for their food in the beginning, it was above just 'better-than-I-expected.' 

Vongole flavor was very well soaked into the pasta dish, and all the ingredients in the dish were fresh. They didn't over-sauce the pizza, which made thin crust not so soggy like some of other hipster pizza stores, and it was still flavorful.  

They had a live music going on while we were eating, and both of us enjoyed it a lot. 

I would have given them 5 stars if they had a better ventilation system.. The smoke out of kitchen was traveling in the store, and my eyes were hurting at one point. Other than that, everything else was great!"}
{"text":"What a warm and welcoming and inviting environment! My pizza was good and my wife thought her pasta and chicken was 5-star. White wine by the glass is limited - only one choice. We met friendly people eating there. The place is small and has a friendly vibe. So glad we found it. Good place for family or romantic dinner."}
{"text":"Visiting from LA, this restaurant was fantastic! Great food and ambiance! A definite must if you like Italian food."}
{"text":"It was raining- we were tired and with our kids...
Found this place with YELP.
Service was OUTSTANDING.  The kind of service you remember.  Our waiter, possibly the host not sure... Made this place for us.  He was an older man not sure he's there everyday as I look at the other reviews...  Food was good so were the drinks...  Nice decor, kind of kitsch- Exactly what we needed."}
{"text":"Excellent Italian pizza! As Italian I can confirm that you get real genuine Italian food and Italian feeling."}
{"text":"Great spot for a  casual date. It has a fun kitchy vibe. Pizza was great and gnocchi bolognese was good not quite what I was expecting but still good. The nutmeg threw me. Fills up pretty fast so make reservations. And to add to the experience there's an older gentleman playing the accordion. Service was a bit slow at first but our waitress was nice and topped off our wine on the house. I'd come back!!"}
{"text":"Service was great, Pizza was great (One of the best in my opinion!) can't wait to try the pastas. Super cute inside with the decor and candles. Will be back again."}
{"text":"Uncle Tony's was one of my favourite places because of the veal Oso bucco, however they took it off the menu ! So I go the other veal dish , it was terrible, the risotto was watery and the veggies in it tasted raw . We also got the meatball and spaghetti that was amazing . The tiramisu was odd, I've had many tirimisu's and this one tasted like whip cream not marscapone . Anyways 3/5 stars I would rate it , would have given it a higher rating , but the veal dish was terrible ."}
{"text":"Uncle Tony's is a super cute Italian mom and pop shop in the heart of the St. Lawrence market area downtown. The interior is comprised of exposed brick and several round and intimate booths. The staff is extremely friendly and helpful. We went with a group of friends and we purchased the fat tony and funghi pizzas. They were cooked to perfection in stone ovens and every topping was super fresh (LOVED the spicy Italian sausage on the fat tony). 

We are also purchased the squash ravioli and it was amazing! Highly recommend this dish (see picture).


To enhance your dishes, be sure to request their homemade spicy sauce...but beware...it is actually quite spicy! 

As a final tip, I highly recommend you make reservations....this place is always at capacity!! You will not be disappointed. 

Price: 4/5
Ambiance: 5/5
Service: 5/5"}
{"text":"Amazing ambiance, service and love music (Albert on the accordion). The margarita pizza was fantastic and a huge bonus that they offer gluten-free crust. We also had the spaghetti and meatballs, gnocchi and cauliflower appetizer and all were delicious. We will definitely be repeat customers and recommend Uncle Tony's to anyone looking for great Italian food!"}
{"text":"My dinner started out incredible. I got take out of the tomato burrata salad and fettuccini carbonara.
Unfortunately I found a produce sticker on one of the tomatoes! Good thing I didn't eat it... This was a careless mistake on whoever prepped the fresh tomatoes."}
{"text":"This place is amazing, probably the best pizza in Toronto (that I've had). Thin crust pizza with amazing toppings. I would come here again and again. I've been there a few times, but last night we had the chance to sit in front of the guy who makes the pizza. It was awesome to watch the pizzas cook in the 700 degree ovens right in front of us.. He told us it takes 4 minutes to cook, and the pizzas came out hot and crispy. We watched as he made our pizzas right in front of us! Definitely the best seat in the house. The pizza guy (sorry, he told us his name, but after a bottle of wine I can't remember it) was super friendly, we ordered appetizers, mozzarella sticks and the tomato salad, and he surprised us by putting it on a nice platter with an assortment of meats and cheeses. A very nice touch. We ordered the Uncle Tony's, the Magarita pizza, and the special with salumi, sausage and other toppings... all were spectacular. I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Had dinner here before a concert at the Sony center. Loved the ambience, with the checked table cloths and the candles. Ordered a glass of pinot grigio to start. It came warm. White wine should not be warm and no I don't want ice to dilute my lovely wine. That completely turned me off of the place. 
Started with a salad and had margherita pizza as the main. Nothing special. Walked out thinking, well, I tried it, but doubt very much if I'll go back."}
{"text":"Ambiance: dim lighting, checkered tables, nice light music in the back. 

Serving: attentive, very gracious with splitting receipts. Food did take about 20-30 minutes for a party of 10 entrees.

Reservations are needed! It was packed when we came in, even around 8:30PM on a Thursday night.

Prices: 18-30 per entree, a little on the pricey side for what food we got. Quantities were perfect sized to share. 

Food: 

We got the squash agnolotti - tasty, creamy, sweet taste. Good to eat but hard to eat alone due to overpowering flavour.

Funghi pizza - lighter fare and balanced well with the other entrees

Dominic pizza - meaty and good

Tony pizza - overhyped but crispy bacon was yummy

Gnocchi primavera - pan fried almost, definitely not the expected flavour and texture.

Rigatoni - kinda heavy flour taste 

Bonus: hot chilli oil was a nice kick and I covered my plate with it to soak into the pizza crusts. 

Pass, but not the most amazing I've had."}
{"text":"This place is a cute little spot that isn't as busy as it should be. The first time I went about a year ago, it was packed, but this time around, there were only 2 other tables that came after us during lunch time. The first time I went, I tried their fat tony pizza and didn't really enjoy it considering it cost $22. The pizza was too salty and although it is thin crust it was slightly mushy. This time around, I shared the funghi pizza, butternut squash agnolotti and the arugula salad. Everything was delicious! The pizza was perfectly thin and crispy with the right amount of cheese to mushroom ratio. The butternut squash agnolotti was soft, creamy and slightly sweet. I loved this dish! The pizza and pasta go so well together and the arugula salad was a great addition. I will definitely come back for all three of those dishes."}
{"text":"One of the best pizza's I've ever had. Or two pizza's. Had the Fungi and the Prata I think it was called with rosemary and fingerling potatoes. It comes with meat but I ordered without. It was great. 
The mozzarella sticks were not so good but the tomato sauce for dipping was killer. 
This was a takeout order.
The other night I tried this place for the first time and had a mushroom pasta that was also one of the best I've had. Although it was too small and would be good as a side dish but not a main course for a hungry person.  
I will for sure go back, I'll just order two pasta dishes next time....."}
{"text":"My partner and I ventured in here after spending happy hour at Pravda a few doors away.  We ordered the fat Tony pizza and pasta with clams.  Both items arrived promptly.  The pasta with clams was excellent, pasta was al dente and obviously made fresh.  The clams were plump and plentiful.  We were equally impressed with the pizza.  The sauce used was richly flavored with garlic and fennel and the sausage used wasn't overly greasy. The pizza crust was outstanding, good amount of chew and the right amount of crispness to the crust.  The wine list was very very limited but this could be due to their recently opening.  Our server was very attentive.  We would definitely return."}
{"text":"I had seen this place from the outside, going to closeby restaurants, and was always intrigued by the setting - red and white checkered tablecloths, candles, etc. I finally decided to try it out on a date night recently. The food is good - we had the calamari and mozzarella sticks for starters, and the butternut squash and the meatball spaghetti for main course. There was live music which was a nice touch but a little too loud to carry on a conversation at times. Overall we had a good experience and will go back."}
{"text":"We live close by and had been meaning to try Uncle Tony's for quite some time now. The other night the restaurant we had been planning to go to had a 1.5 hour wait, and we realized we should finally give this place a try, and we're glad we finally did.

The atmosphere is great. It's a smaller restaurant, so it's rather intimate, and it has that classic Italian-American eatery charm. The red and white table clothes, the candles in wine bottles, posters for films like The Godfather, and even as we were finishing up, a gentleman playing the accordion. 

But, obviously, you're not going for the atmosphere but rather the food. My wife and I decided to order two pizzas to share (The Margherita and the Fat Tony). Both were excellent, especially the Fat Tony. They weren't as cheesy as one might expect, but I actually liked that it meant I got to taste the ingredients a bit more than usual.

We also ordered a caesar salad, which while nothing to write home about, was good enough. Nicely dressed with fresh crisp lettuce and crunch croutons.

The staff seemed quite pleasant, and even though they needed us out by 8pm (they had a large party coming in) never rushed us or made us feel unwelcome.

The prices were also not unreasonable, especially for a downtown Toronto restaurant. It wasn't exactly *cheap* but perfectly fine for a date night.

All in all we'd definitely return for when we're jonesing for delicious home-made pizza or pasta."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza and pasta at very reasonable price point. I'd recommend it for a really cute date night spot, or whenever you just want really good italian food."}
{"text":"Ended up here by accident, and it was outstanding. The interior vibe is bang on - checkered table cloths and all. The place is appropriately crowded, noisy, and dark. The pizza is absolutely terrific - thin crust, good density of toppings and cheese ratio, and full of flavour. It really reminded me of what I was eating while I travelled the coast of Italy. 

Bonus points to the hosting and wait staff for accommodating us without a wait during a busy evening."}
{"text":"Last night my fiancé and I are here.. this place was AMAZING. 
--we started with a salad which was great 
--we then ordered the Margherita pizza it honestly was one of the best pizzas I have tasted the dough was crunchy not to much sauce the right amount of cheese! Just perfect! 
-- and for the best dish of all that made my meal was the butternut squash stuffed pasta topped with porcini cream sauce .. Out of this world .. Our waitress Sarah was very friendly and helpful -- thanks again when I come back in town I will most definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Phenomenal pizzas and on Friday they had a live performer playing the trumpet."}
{"text":"Finally - a non-Neapolitan pizza joint! Don't get me wrong, I love Neapolitan too, but it's taken over the city and I like my pizza options.

Uncle Tony's was excellent. Fantastic price point, really delicious pizza with a refreshingly crispy crust (I had the margherita) and pretty good house wine. The caesar salad was surprisingly great as well (many other pizza places call those in, I find). Our service was terrific as well. A really nice spot."}
{"text":"3 of us shared 2 pizzas with a bottle of wine, and it made for a great night. Great local spot - I hope it doesn't become too popular or we'll have to fight for space. The pizzas were both very tasty - fresh, simple ingredients and very flavourful. Our server was helpful and friendly, and I liked the energy and decor. Will return."}
{"text":"We came to Toronto for the Rotary Convention and stumbled upon this quaint little piece of Italy. Excellent, relaxed cozy atmosphere with traditional red and white checked tablecloths with Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin singing in the background with very friendly staff. We had tasty appetizers including excellent, freshly fried calamari, fried cauliflower and fresh focaccia bread. We enjoyed their vodka tomato creme rigatoni and traditional spaghetti and meatballs,both dishes were excellent and impressive my wife who grew up in an Italian family. We can't wait to go back to Toronto again to enjoy this place!!"}
{"text":"I was tasked to find an Italian restaurant in Toronto for a friends birthday. I've never been to Toronto so all I had were online recommendations to pull from. That is how I found Uncle Tony's. They were happy to accommodate all 16 of us and without a group gratuity which most restaurants require. We had such a great time last night! It's a smaller restaurant so we took up about half. They have live music, a wonderful accordion player. The service was top notch, always checking in with us. And the food was great! Traditional Italian with lots of options ranging from pizza to spaghetti and meatballs! Birthday girl was so happy so thank you Uncle Tonys!"}
{"text":"We love this Italian eatery. Pasta, pizza and services all superb! It's almost perfect for a date night. Make sure you ask for the candle-lit, lover's booth if it's available."}
{"text":"The best authentic Italian restaurant downtown Toronto. The ambiance is super cute, the decor is fun and chic. You actually feel like you're in Italy.
As for the food, it was just delicious! On point! I was never a fan of Italian food but this restaurant passed my expectations. Super super good. 
If you like squash then I recommend their butternut squash pasta! The best I've ever had.
Their pizza is great and the crust is thin so you can definitely enjoy all the ingredients in it.
I would definitely come back and recommend this place.
Great for a date, family or friends dinner.
Just fell in love with uncle Tony's"}
{"text":"The vibe at Uncle Tony's is fantastic. Checkered tables, small intimidate setting with candle-lit tables, dimmed light (evening meal) with a soft backdrop of pleasant music to listen to...  I was very pleased with what I saw! A sharp contrast to the busy & loud neighborhood you just stepped out of.

I went with one of their pizzas and it was just fantastic. Thin crust, bursting with flavor it really made my evening. Barely 10 minute wait time. I matched the pizza with one of their jack cocktails and a little Brio, I was in heaven. MMMMMMM

My waitress ended up being my hostess as well, very friendly and attentive, truly a 5 star experience.

I will knock it down a notch however as the dessert of fried doughnuts and side chocolate left me less than impressed. Their dessert menu didn't seem very interesting and I feel they could do much better in that regards. Italian cuisine is FILLED with amazing Italian unique styled desserts, kindly incorporate those in your dessert menu, maybe even have a dessert of the week. A good dessert is a great way to sign off a fantastic meal for your patrons. Please consider it.

Price is pretty decent, lots of value here and definitely worth trying out."}
{"text":"Great place for affordable delicious pasta. The pizzas are also really good.  Great atmosphere and the service was fantastic. Nice little gem hidden on Wellington. One added bonus was the chef ending up custom making a pizza half half for my wife and I since we have different tastes, it was a thoughtful accommodation that usually doesn't happen at restaurants downtown."}
{"text":"4.5.  Place is small so make a reso if you can.  Service was decent.  They had a few big parties when we went so they were busy.

Prices are phenomenal.  Everything is so cheap.

They have these adorable little booths for 2 tops.

We had the nozarella sticks calamari and a pizza to split.  The pizza is brick oven which is so popular in Toronto. Most places won't have a nice crispy crust on the bottom but uncle Tony's does it perfectly.

The mozzarella sticks and calamari were also really good.  Sticks clearly homemade.  My only complaint was that it was cold by the time it came out.  Warm plates would have helped keep the food warm.  

Can't wait to try their fresh made pasta"}
{"text":"Great place for a casual dinner - the menu is small but it is perfectly curated. The staff is nice and the decoration is lovely."}
{"text":"The pizzas were too salty and way too crunchy (they were more like \" flambé flatbread - flammekueches \". It was VERY noisy in there. Their red chairs are very uncomfortable. We were close to the door so a little cold. Not the best experience. We enjoyed the accordion player though."}
{"text":"This restaurant does not have the capacity to serve a large party (20+ people) in an adequate time frame, has abysmal service, and mediocre food. 

My friend hosted her birthday here and it was for a large party of around 20 people. The restaurant was not busy for a Saturday night and there were maybe 3-4 other tables. Everyone arrived by 8:15 and we ordered by 8:30........only for our food to arrive around 10:30. What really gets on my nerves is the servers, they gave us ZERO reassurance about our food. They just came, filled our glasses with water and left. Nothing about getting some more appetizers, or apologizing for the delay, or suggesting that maybe some people can get there food first? When asked, they simply said \"soon\"...which meant waiting for another 1.5 hours. I think the strategy for the restaurant is to starve their patrons so the food would seem to taste better.

As for the food, the pizza wasn't bad, but not good either. Thin crust, little sauce, little cheese, non-existent toppings. The taste was good, but for the value...not worth it. Some of my friends ordered the pasta and I have to say that it was the worst pasta I have ever eaten. The carbonara linguine was overcooked and every bite left this powdery residue in the mouth. It also had this terrible after taste to it...simply unpleasant.

I really wanted to like this restaurant especially because of the unique look. I have also never heard an accordion been played so well, although it was disruptive at times. At the end of the night, the 18% mandatory gratuity was not deserved. Will not be coming back"}
{"text":"Great place. Randomly ended up here and it was perfect. Good food. Good wine. Pretty cheap overall."}
{"text":"5 stars for ambiance! Are you kidding me? They have an accordion player! Great Italian restaurant with a cool, intimate and trendy European flair. Love the decor! The focaccia with bean spread was out of this world! Please do yourself a favour and order it! The butternut squash agnolotti was good too, but not as fantastic. The donuts for desert were good too. I would come back for the atmosphere alone! Very unique place. Love the vibe!"}
{"text":"I tried to go to Uncle Tony's at 3 pm today. They were closed even though their hours listed say they should be open. There was a guy walking around inside but the door was locked."}
{"text":"My gf and I tried their seafood pasta on our Valentine's Day dinner. The atmosphere is really nice and cosy. The seafood pasta has ample amount of seafood, especially the mussels. We wanted plain as neither of us could handle spicy tomato sauce and the kitchen accommodated our request. However, they seem to not clean the mussels cleanly because I can taste the sand in the mussel. They also appear not to replace the tablecloth because there were some garlic bread crumbs on my elbow when I put my arm on the table (and we did not order any bread in our visit). Other than this minor blip, everything else is great"}
{"text":"This is a cute little 60s inspired pizza joint! 

In an area surrounded by overpriced restaurants, this is a glimmer of reasonably priced good food. 

The ingredients are fresh, the menu is concise but has something for everyone, and there is a great cocktail list.

So why the three stars? I think this place was a solid four except for the service. I found our server a bit rude honestly, which kind of dampened the whole experience. 

However, I will likely be back as proximity and price often win out."}
{"text":"Can't believe it took me an actual visit to realize that all the five star reviews were written by people with no \"friends\" on yelp. Should've known better.

So... went to the family-friendly looking restaurant because we had a child, only to find that they had no high chairs, no utensils, cups or anything for non-adults, and the juice available was the orange juice mixer at the bar. Waiter was polite but offered very little additional help. Likewise, the pizza was non-offensive, but the lukewarm spaghetti-meatball mix was just edible, all for about 40 dollars.... and the glass of wine I ordered to calm myself down ended up being a finger width, which was even more distressing.

One thing I might note is that I'm from the US, where red-checker-cloth pizza joints named \"Uncle Tony's\" that have a cartoon logo are supposed to be festive places that smell like spices and tomato sauce with accordion music and laughter in the air... whereas in Canada I guess it has more somber and tragic connotations."}
{"text":"We were looking for a well priced, basic Italian place.  We laughed a little when we walked in - it is very kitschy (which they pride themselves on).  It was perfect.  Very small, attentive staff, and GREAT FOOD.  Just what we were looking for. I had a pizza, and it was probably the best pizza crust we've ever had.  The spaghetti was also good, just the right combo of heat and sweet.  Don't give in to the hype of the fancy places.  Come here for authentic food at a good price in a warm, friendly setting."}
{"text":"Items that we had:

-appetizer special of the day: zucchini flowers $12
- fungi pizza: $17
- Deep fried cheesecake: $8? 

service: service was exceptional, I called ahead of time to see if they'd have space, and I didn't even ask for a reservation, and the server made one for me. I was extremely impressed by this.

ambience: won't get much cuter atmosphere than this place. Ideal for date nights. Honestly having the red picnic tablecloths, candle, and accordion player made it look like something out of a movie

food: perhaps it was the dishes we chose, but the food was definitely not worth it.  The zucchini flowers were good but you got four small flowers for $12, I thought it'd be worth $8 at most. The pizza was good but it was pretty plain and standard, nothing special. And finally, the deep-fried cheesecake was the most disappointing of all, it tasted nothing like cheesecake. It was made of something like ricotta and wasn't the least bit sweet. I would never recommend this dessert to anyone.

all in all I really liked everything about this place except the food, and I wish I could give it 3.5 stars, but I don't think it deserves quite 4 stars"}
{"text":"Very charming little restaurant! I loved the kitschy decor and simple menu. Everything we ordered was tasty, and while the service was a little slow (it was NYE), our waitress was exceptionally nice & gave us a great wine recommendation."}
{"text":"If you want delicious food with a charming ambience then this is your place. Reservation recommended unless you plan on an early meal. The staff was excellent as well, we showed up without a reservation but they were able to seat us and we made it out in time for the next group to have their table. Great place."}
{"text":"First dinner in Toronto was Uncle Tony's. We're American tourists here for the Rotary International Convention. This restaurant was a delight and we highly recommend it!!! It was bustling with Friday night diners, there was a gentleman playing the accordion, and they had the dining room lit with candlelight. Great ambiance. We didn't have a reservation and were offered a 15-minute wait, a seat at the bar or the chef's table. We selected the chef's table where we watched Tom, the chef, and his crew in action. Tom hosted us for appetizers and desserts and made us feel extremely welcome.  We also ordered the fried calamari, Fat Tony's pizza, and spaghetti with meatballs. The food exceeded our expectations but what made this dinner super special was the warm and friendly staff. We'll be back and we hope you will also give them a try!"}
