{"text":"I usually never review anything but this I had to!! The food was beyond disgusting. Ate it last night and I'm surprised I'm still alive. Fried rice was burnt and soggy. Chicken undercooked. I feel like I'm gonna vomit just thinking about it. I have no clue how this restaurant is still in business. DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY"}
{"text":"nobody speaks a word of English and the food tastes like shit, waste of money do not order. especially delivery"}
{"text":"They have student specials every day.... but the place is sooooo dirty and filthy that I would never go back again."}
{"text":"We have been to this restaurant numerous times and it wasn't until yesterday that I decided to use the washroom to find that I was sharing the stall with a cockroach.  I have truly lost my appetite and have decided to venture elsewhere to get chinese food.  The sign outside says \"conditional pass\" but honestly, it should be shut down.  I can't even begin to think about where it has been and who's food it has touched. DISGUSTING. EW."}
{"text":"I've eaten here on many occasions.  Food is not consistent.  Sometimes good, sometimes spoiled.  However, on an good note, the staff is really great and friendly.

Unfortunately, my last experience here ended with a critter (baby cockroach?) in our wonton soup.  Needless to say, I will not be frequenting this restaurant in the future.  I can live without the \"extra\" seasoning."}
{"text":"I really wish there was an option to give this restaurant zero stars! So I walked into this place to order a takeout. I took one of the takeout menus to skim looking for General Tao Chicken. Not seeing it there I asked this guy lounging at the counter. Now this guy  clad in clothes two sizes small barely glances up from up from whatever he was doing on a tablet or whatever.  He informs me it wasn't on the menu, but I can order it anyway. I asked if i could get vegetables as well. my order came to $18.00. Go figure, I've been to better quality and service eateries that cost less, but I digress. the server then rudely snatches the takeout menu from my hand and stacks it back with the rest. I took one back, because I wanted to make sure I had the right name and address of this restaurant. When my dinner arrived, it was tossed onto the table in front of me without a word. I looked at the food and tasted it it. Ugh! worst Chinese food I've ever had! The chicken was virtually tasteless, except salty in a watery sauce. the vegetable was in the same type of sauce as well. I know Gen tao chicken, it should have a type of crunchiness along with the sauce. Tainted by my displeasure at the poor service, didn't make it any better. I will never, ever, buy food at this place again! People should spend their hard money elsewhere"}
{"text":"The best Chilli Chicken in town and the best sweet & sour chicken balls! I spent over $50.00 for take out and they threw in 1/2 a chicken. Staff is really nice and I had planned to give it 4 stars but after reading the other review here knocked it down. I really never noticed the conditional pass on the door and they need to get that up to pass. That's when I'll go back, not before. But honestly? The food is really, really good."}
{"text":"My friend suggested this place since I was in her area and we were both hungry for Chinese. She has been here before and highly recommended it! It is a tiny place off of Jane just south of Wilson in a strip plaza. You wouldn't know it's there unless you are looking for it. The place itself was pretty basic holding maybe 40 people at most. Service was quick and correct. When we got there it was pretty empty by the time we left it was packed. Every table was seated. 

We ordered the beef fried cantonese noodles, chicken fried rice and the lemon chicken. All dishes came out within 15 minutes of ordering. The portions were a great size and perfect for sharing! I was a little thrown off guard by the lemon chicken, i'm use to seeing lemon chicken pieces tossed and cooked in the sauce. This lemon chicken was crispy chicken plain with a side dish filled with the sauce and you determine how much you want to use. Different but great experience. The noodles and rice were cooked to perfection. I got exactly what I expected to get. The taste was authentic and true to what I've been use to.

Being out of my normal area I don't see myself making a trip out there to this place just for their food it would be because I'm with my friends and we are around. That being said if this place is close to you and you feel like trying something new then I suggest this place. Great food, awesome service and at a reasonably cheap price where can you go wrong?"}
