{"text":"Recently had dinner there. The server, Scott, was excellent. The food? Not worth the price. Don't get me wrong. It was good. But, frankly there are at least 2 restaurants within 50m that offer same quality for less price. 

The wine selection was good, if a bit pricey. My only issue here is that restaurants don't generally decant the wine which isn't good for the flavour. 

Would I go back? Honestly? I don't know. 

Decor: too much metal. Too much neon. The ambience is dry. Sterile. And not very conducive to a romantic dinner. A business lunch? Sure."}
{"text":"You can really tell a lot about a business by how they treat their most privileged clients.

I'm going to approach this review in a unique way - from the perspective of a media practitioner attending an event and as a regular customer.

I attended a going-away party for a good friend of mine a couple days back, as of this writing. When I got to the venue, I was told that there was a $25 cover for every person coming into the restaurant (whether it was for just the party or everyone wasn't clear). I was also told that this was non-negotiable, and that they didn't have an ATM on-site either, so I had to whip out my credit card and pay sight unseen. 

Even with the caveat that I was a member of the media (and gave them my card, to boot), they didn't budge, which suggests to me that they have no understanding of what publicity is or how to react when someone who's covering an event and may have to leave early walks through their door.

That initial experience left a bad taste in my mouth, and I soon found myself wondering if I'd wandered into a high-priced tourist trap. Luckily, the rest of the experience was better.

There's no doubt that this is the most-staffed restaurant in Port Credit, if not Mississauga. The aloof hostess gave way to a lineup of pizza cooks and chefs furiously turning out pizzas while a legion of busboys and waitresses buzzed around the restaurant, which has an expansive patio and plenty of seating. Make no mistake - this IS a marquee destination if you're looking for a site with great views. It overlooks the docks near the Credit River bridge and has plenty of unobstructed views.

The party included a catered menu that featured three types of pizza - from what I could tell, this included the Margherita and Quattro Formaggio varieties, as well as one I couldn't identify that had mandarin orange slices on it. They also had what I considered the standout item - polenta fries (cooked to perfection) - and small bowls of what appeared to be rigatoni in a cream sauce. I was so-so on the pizza and pasta, but the polenta was fantastic and I found myself going back for seconds and thirds.

Service was very prompt and quick, and a waitress appeared in a flash when a slightly-inebriated guest/realtor broke a wine glass. Easily a standout aspect of the visit.

(Also, a shoutout to the owner [manager?], who explained to a friend of mine about how the restaurant can handle customers with allergies, and riddled off an impressive list of alternate dishes and preparation options - save for celiacs. Was quite surprised to hear how thorough they are in that respect.)

I could see this being a prime date night location, as it has just the right ambiance and site to handle a lot of people in a more intimate setting, an opinion that was reinforced by how busy it was inside before I left (and this was already at 3 p.m.). I found myself lounging under one of the gazebos with a group of friends, and ended up ordering a mojito (it pays to have good friends), which I was actually very surprised by.

Say what you will about the overpriced drinks ($14-18 a pop? wew lad), but they knew how to make that drink - a subtle mint flavour that sneaks up on you, with all the fixings, presented in a classy art-style glass. Points for that one.

I could see myself definitely coming to POSTA regularly, but I'll need another visit to fully evaluate the site. Considering this was on my list of restaurants to visit ASAP, I left with some mixed feelings. The service (from most corners) and atmosphere is fantastic, but there are some deficiencies in other areas that could stand to be worked on.

Regardless, I will try to get back soon."}
{"text":"Was here the other night for a family birthday. We first were in awe of how beautiful the space was! Everything from the decor to it being right by the water, which I'm sure will be great in summertime, blew us away. 

Our server, Mary, was attentive, efficient and friendly and made for a great night. 

What really took the cake, however, was the food. I had the gnocchi and loved the freshness of the sauce. Everyone at our table enjoyed their meals, and the panna cotta was to die for! Can't wait to come back to this restaurant."}
{"text":"My hubby took me for Valentine's Day dinner. They had a pre fix menu for $75 per person.  It included four course meal.  I must say the ambiance was very romantic. The service was equally fantastic.

We both enjoyed the food very much.  I had the beet salad (10/10) 
The butternut squash risotto was creamy and delicious (10/10)
The halibut with kale was huge and divine
And the Dessert was just to die for.

Worth every penny!!  My only complaint 
Too much food 
Such a beautiful evening"}
{"text":"Posta just opened and so we had to check it out.  Fantastic.  Good service and atmosphere were amazing.   You must order the mushroom ravioli. So Light, so sensuous and delicious.    Thank you. We had an amazing dinner. Highly recommend it"}
{"text":"We came here for my birthday dinner based on a recommendation from a friend and were very pleased. The menu, although limited, is excellent. The service was top notch; quick, efficient and friendly. I don't know much about Italian wines and got some very good recommendations. We didn't have to wait long for our food. 

The atmosphere is nice, although a bit loud but you can still hear your date ;)"}
{"text":"Went for the first time last night. A great addition to our neighbourhood! 

Love the decor, the view and the service. Made reservations for a busy Saturday night and were seated promptly.

Good food (quality over quantity) and being Italian I would say I have higher expectations. 

Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday for brunch and was hugely disappointed by the small serving size.  We ordered the omelette Fritatta del Giorno and it was not much larger than the size of a poached egg in a little pan.  The meal didn't come with anything but the omelette. The price was \"market price\" and only had a bit of mushroom and soft cheese and it was $16.  My husband ordered Italian sausage on the side so luckily he shared a little with me.  Drinks are expensive, even the coffee.  I suggest that you plan to eat ahead or after.  The pizza looked more substantial and a better choice if you are hungry."}
{"text":"Being a local boy to Port Credit I love to support all establishments and Posta has been a great addition to the area.
I went to dinner with friends/clients on Friday night and Posta was buzzing. The music was great, clean and well laid out restaurant. I had a drink at the bar first and Justin the bartender recommended the Winter Negroni cocktail. Justin was professional, fun and his recommendation was delicious.
Our server was Erica, oh Erica. You can tell she has experience since it was packed and she was working her tables but always had time to check in. She knew the menu items to a T and I went with her recommendation of the Pappardelle (beef rago). The pasta is made their and this dish was fresh, tasty and plentiful. Erica has a great sense of humour and made our experience wonderful. 
My friends had the Veal, they enjoyed it but they wished it came with a little pasta.
The experience for a new place was above average and I cannot wait to go back."}
{"text":"Prior to coming to Posta I had a lot of high hopes with the reviews and the menu. Came in on a Saturday night with reservation, was mistakenly brought to 2 different tables that were already seated.. didn't actually get seated until about 20 minutes after our actual reservation time. 

When we finally did get seated our server came immediately and took our drink orders. I thought that was a good sign especially since we waited so long already for a table.. little bit after he came and took our appetizer order. Tried their charcutteri board (3 cheese and 3 meats); the board itself was not as nicely presented as other restaurants would present their board. In my opinion it was quite sloppy. The 3 cheese they provided were good and imported from Italy. The meats were not as spectacular but they do go through a cycle of different items for the board each day. The best part of the board was the calabrese spread, spicy and has a good kick to it. Wish the bread sticks were not cold and hard! We had a table of 4 and it only came with 3 bread sticks which was quite disappointing.  Also ordered the fried calamari,shrimp, scallop dish. This one was good, in terms of portion size and taste! Was crispy and hot when we got it and was definitely the winner of the night. We also ordered the fried risotto balls and nothing overly special about it, comes in 3 and the taste was very bland! No spice or even salt in the risotto balls which is quite disappointing.

For our mains, we shared the parpedella ragu, pasta was cooked nicely and the meat sauce was delicious! Portion size is on a smaller side but we were full from the apps so it was ok. Also order the gnocchi... super bland and when we got it, it was cold! Portion size for this is also on a smaller side so that was disappointing. Lastly we shared the pizza with sausage and potato and that was the most unflavourful pizza I've ever had! It was cook nicely (crust and pizza it self was thin) but come on where is the taste?!??! Truly disappointing.

Furthermore, we had to wait a while between each course. Our server also punched in the wrong orders for our main so had to wait longer for everyone's dish to arrive which resulted to our other dishes to be cold.. At the end of the night, we noticed our server was not sober and that makes sense why the service wasn't as on point as we wished it was. Definitely would not return."}
{"text":"What a disappointing experience. I came across with this restaurant on instagram from my foodie friends. Anyways,  I wish I was told when making the reservations that the street access was fenced off and that there is underground parking as we parked on the street and have to go around the complex to enter.

For the drinks, we've ordered the following: 

LOVE LETTER
16.00 2.5 OZ
Beefeater, strawberry jasmine syrup,
Bodegas Maron Oloroso sherry, lemon juice

FLUID SPRITZ
18.00 2.5 OZ
Evan Williams Black, blood orange puree, housemade
Pomegranate hibiscus falernum, Brachetto d Aqui, soda

The Love Letter was an interesting concept, this drink comes with an envelop as a mat with a real lipstick mark. It's neat but again not worth that price point. Nothing to write home about. 

For the appetizer, I've attempted to order

VONGOLE OREGANATE $18.00 
Baked littleneck clams, parsley, bread crumbs, lemon, garlic and olive oil. However, the waitress told me they don't have that. Note: I was at the 5:00pm reservations and should be the first round. 

Moving on for the highlight that I have been looking forward to for a few weeks.

POSTA PARMIGIANO WHEEL FOR TWO (MP)
Daily pasta or risotto tossed in a wheel of three-year old D.O.P. parmigiano-reggiano
The (MP) for tonight was $39 and the portion was like for one portion. They flame the cheese and add the risotto on, it's great if your \"neighbour\" ordered this so you can watch. But it was soooo salty. So salty that I am thirsty and got a headache after!  The daily risotto was just with mushrooms. Definitely the portion seemed like portion for one person or not to price it at that price point. 

The guest beside me couldn't order this because she had some sort of food allergy so I told my husband \"lucky her\" that she didn't end up ordering this! 

ARAGOSTA $34.00 
Nova Scotia lobster, mascarpone, blistered tomatoes, leeks, fennel pollen

There were pieces of lobster, very limited and the base tasted a bit dry. 

The ambiance was nice, service was good but as a huge foodie, this dinner, the actual food that I was looking forward to kind of ruined my Saturday."}
{"text":"We just came back from our lovely evening at Posta for their soft opening night. Place was packed up. Walked into a beautiful nice modern look restaurant, they have side bar which they will serve Gelatto in the summer and take out in the future. Loved how attentive the servers and hostess were and we were quickly seated in a nice private area overlooking the harbor/ lighthouse. 

Husband ordered the Funghi Pizza and I had the Funghi Ravioli with Seafood Breaded Appetiazer. All were quickly bought out! we were actually quite surprised how quickly the food came out. Portions were good and the prices were quite reasonable. Our server seemed quite knowledgeable and gave us some great suggestions. 

We will definitely be back in the future!"}
{"text":"Had an amazing girls night with my bestie. We sat by the window enjoying delicious food.

Got the papardelle with out the meat and mushroom pizza. Thr pizza was thin, chewy and gobsmacked with garlic chive flavors! They were very accomodating for my dietary needs. Really wanted papardelle pasta so they tossed it in the spaghetti sauce~~~ and boy was it soft and delicious in their tomato sauce with a huge portion of house made fresh mozzarella! 

Their different chili and sauce options are all flavorful and pack a punch on their own! Ended on a delicious tiramisu that was beautifully plated.

We enjoyed our visit for 3.5 hours while catching up on life. The staff was always respective and you could see they made an effort not to interrupt our conversation. Not once did we feel rushed. They didnt bring a bill until we asked for the bill.

Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Came here to celebrate my birthday. Food and drinks, superb! My son enjoyed the Italian cheeses and cured meats. Great night!"}
{"text":"1st visit to Posta.  We will definately be back.  Friend and i decided to enjoy a meal at the bar section.  Wonderful service.   Started with wine .. dinner was gnocci ...  heavenly .. and an off the charts dessert that was surreal.   The vibe is stellar."}
{"text":"Really good Italian food. I had the gnocchi with walnuts and rapini and it was delicious. My husband had the pappardelle bolognese which he said was very good. I think though they need to cut down on the salt a bit but I don't mind the salt. Ambiance is very nice classy and upscale with a nice vibe and view of the Credit river . Great buzz in the place with both young and older clientele. I am going back again to try their pizza."}
{"text":"Posta is a great addition to the Mississauga food scene. The food is fantastic, especially the pizzas. I highly recommend the Trio Pizza Metro, where you get to sample three pizzas (excl. the La Perla). My favourite was the Funghi. The Pasta Parmigiano Wheel was fun, but the Ravioli was divine. The service was fantastic (Paula & Co.) A+, and the atmosphere was lively. I would come back for sure."}
{"text":"Overall there were a number of mishaps related to service and the food was adequate.
The place opened recently so maybe it can attributed to that.
Overall: charcuterie board came 45min after we ordered, and food came over an hour after we ordered. They gave us complimentary prosecco to compensate for the wait
Charcuterie board: tasted good, would've expected something a little more for the cost
Tortellini: lacked flavour, not seasoned well, sauce was a broth which was odd bc it was ricotta and hardly any truffle
Ravioli: ravioli was probably the best of the three mains
Pizza burrata: decent, could've gotten the same taste somewhere else
Tiramisu: just okay, not overwhelmed
Have to commend the waitress for being so wonderful and for being very attentive."}
{"text":"Located in an old post office in port credit. The entrance is around the back and not actually on Lakeshore.
It is a big restaurant with lots of lights, alcohol bottle racks, bar and a patio overlooking the water.
They do offer gf pizza crust and gf pasta.
The food was good and enjoyed by everyone. I did not find many vegan items on the menu as most had dairy or cheese. Parking on street or lots close by.
Washrooms were clean and simple.
Staff were friendly but very busy and rushed....we did not get bread on the table and our apps and some mains came out at the same time, while other mains came later.
One member of our party was given a drink in one glass, ice in another and sofa water in another as requested. All the glasses were smelly and when he asked for a replacement he was given empty glasses. He had to specify to replace the 3 items in 3 new, non smelly glasses.
Our teas arrived lukewarm....not hot."}
{"text":"Finally checked this place out on Feb 9 for my mom's birthday dinner. We were a party of four. I made a reservation through their instagram page but we arrived at the restaurant earlier than my reservation and were accommodated, no problem. We were offered complimentary coat check and underground parking and greeted by someone I'm guessing was either the GM or owner. Once he heard that we were there to celebrate my mom's birthday he took us to the bar and offered us all a shot...only thing is, as Muslims we don't drink lol! After a good laugh, he offered us some bottled water instead and showed us to our seats. 
The menu is enticing but obviously full of pork and alcohol based dishes. Would be nice to have maybe a smoked salmon pizza/pasta option. Chicken? Come to think of it, I don't think I remember seeing a single chicken dish!
We had the seafood fritti, risotto croquettes and cheese board to start. Everything was delicious. The fritti was perfectly fried and seasoned. Croquettes come as a serving of three which I thought was awkward..I think four pieces would be better, especially in our case. Cheese board was great- definitely my mom's favourite. 

For mains we had mushroom ravioli, seafood pasta, shrimp pizza and the most elegant ricotta stuffed pasta dish any of us had ever seen. 
There was a bit of a wait between apps and mains but once they came, they were all definitely worth the wait. 
Portion sizes were spot on! The two stuffed pasta dishes were very rich but also well balanced. The seafood pasta was delightful and the pizza was amazing. The dough was the perfect texture- a mix between chewy and crisp. 

For dessert we had a panna cotta, tiramisu and chocolate hazelnut cake. I've never had a panna cotta before so I don't have anything to compare it to but it seemed more of a modern interpretation as opposed to a traditional one. Again, all three were super tasty! 
Our server, Erica (yes, with a \"c\" and yes, I asked haha) was an absolute delight. She was very attentive and had a great energy and presence. 
My mom had a wonderful birthday dinner, we all left feeling full and satisfied but not weighed down. 
I can't wait to return with my husband for date night!

I truly believe Posta is a wonderful addition to the Port Credit dining scene!"}
{"text":"The food, the service and the ambiance were spot on. Everything we had was absolutely delicious! Service was fast for food that was being freshly prepared. Looking forward to the patio opening in the warmer weather. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Posta Port Credit is a new casual Italian restaurant with an upscale feel and a great location on Port Credit Marina. The design is modern yet intimate with several seating options including booths, tables, a private dining room for approx. 30 people, seats at the Pizza and Salumeria bars and a great outdoor patio that is due to open in the spring.

The restaurant features a large marble bar with some of the best cocktails anywhere. The Winter Negroni features chai infused gin, Campari and house made vermouth and comes with a perfect square ice cube consisting of a cinnamon stick and a star anise. The combination is magical. The Love Letter features a perfect blend of house made jasmine strawberry syrup, oloroso sherry and a Bergmot essence sprayed with a perfume atomizer, all served on a kissed envelope coaster with a Posta post card. Unbelievably awesome!

The menu consist of various Antipasti, Insalata, Salumeria, Pasta, Pizza and Dolce selections. During the Friends and Family event we tried the Friturra di Pesce alla Veneziana consisting of fried calamari, shrimp, cuttlefish and zucchini with a tomato maionese. The result is a light breaded casing around fresh, tender fish. 

The Pizza bar makes some of the best Neapolitan pizza anywhere in the city. The dough is light and the cheese and toppings used are perfectly balanced. The Marco features Fior di latte, heirloom cherry tomato, radicchio and bottarga. The combination is wonderful.

The pastas are fresh house made and the POSTA Parmigiano Wheel for Two is an experience that is well worth the table side preparation by Mark Brown, the Head Chef. The Agnolotti Aragosto and the Pappardelle Bolognese were cooked perfectly al dente with flavorful sauces.

The staff is attentive, friendly and accommodating. This place has no where to go but up and will soon become the most popular restaurant in Mississauga. Can't wait to visit again and certainly in the spring when the outdoor patio opens. The official opening is January 8th and this place will be busy. I would assume reservations will be highly recommended."}
{"text":"This place has so much potential to be an amazing experience. What hinders this is the staff. Came here for some drinks on the patio and there was something wrong with all 4 drinks ordered for the table. First of all we asked for drink recommendations and the bartender helping us went onto diss the menu and said she personally would not drink anything on the menu. And while I appreciate the honesty that reflects poorly on the restaurant. For my drink which was a concoction of watermelon juice, vodka and mint there was a fly in it which already is off to a bad start. She did replace it but the fact that it happened was very offputting. A friend ordered the same thing and there was 1 mint leaf in her drink. She proceeded t ask for more mint and the bartender came back with a whole sprout of mint with her bare hands and handed it to my friend. Did not take the drink and muddle it. Not to mention they have a \"farm to plate\" slogan but she was holding store bought mint leaves and did not care to wash it either before handing it off. The Stella on tap was Luke warm. Last drink was an aperol spritz and usually there would be an orange slice in the drink, it was missing. When we asked for one she again came to the table with it in her hands and put it in the drink. This is not the first questionable customer service experience I've heard of from Posta, I was excited to come and try the food and it is a beautiful place but after this experience my willingness to come back here is questionable. Stars for the atmosphere    But the foul experience ruined it for me."}
{"text":"Just opened in Jan 2018, Posta is a very good sized restaurant with a chic, contemporary look to it. Even though it looks upscale, it feels very approachable, and I was comfortable dining here in casual clothing.

The restaurant has different sections - a takeout \"Xpress\" counter for quick grab and go foods; a pizza counter, and a dining room area. A fully stocked bar is right in the centre of the restaurant and makes for a great place to be if you just want to stop by for drinks.

Posta is pulling out all the stops here. The Executive Chef, Mixologist and the Pizzaiuolo are all award winning talents - and it really shows because everything here is fantastic.  

We started off our night with some cocktails. Their mixologist has a one of a kind \"farm to bar\" mixology program, sourcing seasonal ingredients from nearby local farms whenever possible. We tried The Love Letter (Beefeater, strawberry jasmine syrup, Bodegas Maron Oloroso sherry, lemon juice, Bergamot mist); and the Rusty Nail (Ballantines, house made Drambuie scotch, Ontario honey liqueur) and both are great. I loved the extra touch on these cocktails - The Love Letter actually comes with an envelop with a kiss imprinted; and the Rusty nail does have a \"rusty nail\" (a clean nail with cinnmon coated on it). Neat!

The pizza here are some of the best pizzas I have had in the GTA. The crust is nicely crispy with a light fluffy dough - and I highly recommend the Funghi Pizza (Fior di latte, talleggio, mixed mushrooms, black garlic, truffle oil, chives). Absolutely delicious. We were also treated to an off-menu award winning pizza by the Pizzaiuolo - a pizza that looks like a Clam shell, with a Burrata \"pearl\" inside it. It was a truly special experience!

I highly recommend getting the Posta Parmigiano Wheel, which tosses the risotto/pasta of the day in a big cheese wheel after setting it on fire with vodka. We had a mushroom risotto this way and it was a joy to watch and eat. Among the pasta we've tasted, I really enjoyed the Agnolotti di Mare, which is jam packed with Lobster, crab, sheeps milk cheese and semi-dried tomato, in a pine nut and saffron butter sauce - Delicious!

Overall, we enjoyed our meal here immensely. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"We had high hopes for this place, especially after seeing a video about their Parmesan wheel pasta which looked delicious. Upon arrival, we had to wait twenty minutes past our reservation time as they got the table ready. The service was the worst I've seen in a long time - the waitress poured a lot of water on our table while filling our glasses, including in my bread plate and on my friend's cellphone! She half heartedly apologized and left - we assumed she'd be back to wipe it up but she never bothered and eventually my friend pulled a napkin out of her purse to clean it up herself. We ordered the cheese wheel pasta, which ended up being a risotto that day and it was alright - pretty bland and not really hot. It is cool to see it being made. The waitress forgot to bring us the bread when we asked for it and it finally arrived towards the end of our meal. The dry bread plate I'd asked for never made it. We tried the dessert with the fried strips of dough and Nutella and it was just okay. The dough was tough and not nearly as good as similar desserts I've had. All in all, I'd say the food was mediocre at best but the service was what determined that I'll never go back and would not recommend to others."}
{"text":"I can't say enough good about this place!   We went there as a group (9 people) on February 16, 2018...Valentine's weekend.  I had to call the reservation in since had a larger group and I also wanted to give the restaurant a heads up with regards to a few dietary restrictions two people had.   Upon our arrival we all noted how large the venue was and how busy it was for such a new resto.  We were already impressed!  They have a beautiful and large bar area, private room for larger parties and a gelato bar which had yet to be filled with gelato but sure to be a hit come the summer months.  On that note, there is also a large patio which overlooks part of the port.  Again, sure to be a coveted area that will definitely require a reservation.  
Our server was friendly, offered suggestions and was expedient at ensuring everything was well paced.  Beyond that, the two people that had dietary restrictions were well accommodated.  I was given an item that was not even on the menu since I was on a special diet.  Edward, one of the chefs, was extremely understanding and went above the call to ensure I got what I wanted.   All in all, a fabulous experience from my phone call to book the reservation right down to the service.  
A few side notes, it is a louder restaurant, great for older kids (we did see a few smaller children there as well), there could be more choices for the secondi dishes, pizzas were a big hit with our group and everyone loved theirs, ravioli dish doesn't have many ravioli, charcuterie board is substantial and good for sharing."}
{"text":"This new restaurant in Port Credit is in a prime location on the waterfront and has been really well designed with a modern stylish interior. The menu looks really promising with some classic Italian dishes and some elegant modern iterations too. Unfortunately the food quality and flavour does not live up to the promise and was decent, but not what one would hope for in a restaurant of this location, style and price bracket. The other disappointment was the attitude and demeanour of the staff, with one or two exceptions, the rest of the crew were really lacking in customer service skills and serving etiquette.
I may return to have prosecco on the patio, but it's unlikely we'll come expecting a quality meal or romantic evening."}
