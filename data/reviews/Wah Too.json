{"text":"Chilli chicken, spicy shrimp a bowl of white rice and you're good to go. They need to change the decor though. It's been like that for years. Renovate and clean!"}
{"text":"This is better than soul food.its great food that is always fresh and awesome! Beer is cheap! The service may not be the best but who cares?! You are getting the food that's good for your soul... I have taken people here on multiple occasions and all have been satisfied. Looking at this place, you wouldn't expect much... Try it and be surprised!"}
{"text":"the crab tastes like it has stayed in the fridge for some time. The service is poor but they still cares about tips!"}
{"text":"A great place for lunch. They have a large selection of specials. A bit drab on the inside but if the weather is nice Nathan Phillips square is just a few minutes away."}
{"text":"Not impressed. Fried chicken balls for the kids came cold in the center, wonton soup a bit too sweet with bbq pork flavoring, the three seafood dish was just ok - not piping hot possibly because it came out 3 minutes after the soup), very limited \"surf and turf\" options - I had to order a seafood dish and add beef. Not enough white rice, never got water refills. Just wasn't impressed."}
{"text":"This place is just off Dundas on Center.  Great food, great value, fast and friendly!

I recommend the Shrimp with Lobster sauce on Rice or Noodles, Beef with Bok Choy on Rice or Noodles and last but not least the Chili Chicken (dry) on Fried Rice."}
{"text":"We ordered beef ho fun (my staple Chinese dish), Chinese broccoli with oyster sauce, shredded pork in garlic sauce, and shrimp fried rice.  The vegetable dish was serviceable but both the noodle dish and the pork dish were pretty woeful.  The noodles in the beef ho fun were a little too hard and chewy (and thus bland since the soy sauces barely penetrated the noodles) while the pork in garlic sauce was way too sweet.  The shrimp fried rice was fine though.  Reading positive reviews both here and elsewhere though makes me think we either ordered their worst dishes or we went on an off-day.  If we're in the area again anytime soon, and we choose to eat here again, we'll probably go with their seafood dishes since they seem to be popular among the reviews here and elsewhere."}
{"text":"Late night drunk food you say??

Right across a well known Toronto establishment which is known as Hong Shing is Wah Too. $5 beers and chinese food that is made in a hurry.

I ordered the hakka chow mein- which was string noodles with chicken and shrimp. Very large portion. However - there was a LOT of salt in my dish. Like overwhelmed. I drenched it with sriracha and it tasted better.

However my highlight is the spicy shrimp which tasted amazing. MUST TRY!!! 

This place is great for late nights and cheap Chinese."}
{"text":"Finger licking yummmmy food. One star has been deducted  due to gloomy ambience.  Apart from this, food is awesome and heavenly delicious.  Their Chilli Chicken,  Crispy fried shrimps, chow mein, chilli fish, egg fried rice all are winners. You won't regret spending your money at this restaurant.  If you are out in downtown Toronto,  please do not waste your money in any other restaurant.  Just go to Wah Too. The only down fall is, just like any other place in downtown,  you don't have free parking here."}
{"text":"This place is super lowkey but it's SO good. For $10, you can get a lobster dish that you can share amongst 3-4 friends. Delicious Chinese food :) don't let the appearance/aesthetic throw you off! The place looks sketchy from the outside but the food is good! Hence the high rating of the place. :3 the servers are pretty attentive and friendly. Great for groups because they have big round tables. All dishes are sharable, and thus every dish comes with a generous portion.

Highly recommend the lobster, soooo good!"}
{"text":"Get the chilli chicken, I get it once a week soooooooooo good, havnt had anything else I heard they have good spicy squid"}
{"text":"In town for business and was able to walk here for dinner.  Wow!  Spicy shrimp and wonton soup were amazing.  The reviews on the appearance not being the most appealing are true but don't judge a book by it's cover.  Great service and even better food.  I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Love the Lobster. They do a few different styles. Don't expect some amazing ambience or something. It is good food plain and simple."}
{"text":"Toronto has two Chinatown's, one in the east at Broadview and then the one on Spadina, but in pockets around town there exists small versions where real Chinese restaurants actually exists and in one of these on Centre St is Wah Toos. 

Now, as is the case with many great finds, you trip upon it by accident. An old co-worker told me about this place, and one day when hanging out after work we hit it up, and let me tell you, I'm glad we did. Tasty, quick delicious food and lunch specials that are actually full size portions at actual lunch special prices, not $14.99 and they threw in a small salad as an afterthought. These are real deals.

But something happened in between all the love of tasty lunch specials and humongous dinner helpings: bad service. Grumpy servers, a few bad dishes and one instance where I had been incredibly polite and yet the server almost threw the plate onto the table, and then I didn't come back for a long time. 

But one day I was by city hall and had a hankering for some cheap Chinese and didn't want to go to the noise and craziness of the Eaton food court. So I decided to give Wah Too another try. And as the old expression goes, re-united and it feels so good!

The service was great and both servers I had were friendly and helpful. And the food was quick. And delicious. I ordered two specials because it was so good. And I had beaten the office  lunch time rush so it was nice and quiet. And the lunch specials go until 3:30pm!

I had the chicken balls on fried noodle and the Szechuan beef on fried noodle. So good. I'll be back. Again. And probably again. And again!

Go!"}
{"text":"Trust me and ignore the bad Yelp reviews this time. The food and service at this place was superb. We had nothing bad to say about this place, though we suspected a slightly heavy hand with the MSG. One of their specialties appeared to be the spicy salt and pepper shrimp we ordered, big, plump shrimp that had a batter coating to which chili paste has been added. The taste was incredible, different than the usual salt pepper shrimp that is just flash fried and coated with salt and pepper. This one crackled with its coating and presented spicy, tangy, salty tastes, along with the sweetness of the fresh shrimp and the sauce. Our other dish, seafood pan fried noodles, was also packed with flavor. Even the tea was good, not the usual watered down overused tea leaves you get in dives. I would not even call this a dive. Bestie, who has eaten at serious dives in NYC, remarked that I like greasy spoons. Compared to immaculate Vancouver Chinese spots, this would get a B. But compare it to a typical NYC Chinatown restaurant, an A plus indeed. The food isn't overly greasy by the way,  but is reasonably priced and even cheap for the generous portions you get. This place is outside Chinatown, and, we were told, popular with clubbers late night. I could see why. After a night of spinning and gyrating, you definitely want to chow down on the delicious piles of food here.  It seems to be a fave of groups too. We were agape when we saw the mountain of lobster the table behind us had, and was told it was only two lobsters. We doggie bagged the goods, tucked it into our hotel fridge, and I had a great, cold Chinese breakfast. Even Bestie availed herself of cold spicy shrimp the next day. I don't know if this place changed management, but the gracious service we got was so contrary to the bad Yelp reviews from years ago. The decor wasn't memorable,but it was pretty clean and the bathroom was very clean.This restaurant would be a repeat if I lived in Toronto."}
{"text":"Food: a OK chinese food, taste worse than food court
Price: $10 per person
Only recommend if you are really really hungry and has nothing opens around you.

A group of us went here after nuit blanche. Only this place opens 3 in the morning. The food is pretty bad in my opinion. The portion is good, the food comes pretty fast, however, the food does not taste good, even worse than the food court or fast food.
I don't think I would come again."}
{"text":"I suppose my expectations were higher than just blindly walking in since my parents and aunt had gone and enjoyed their lunch. One of my favourite dishes is pork loin with salt and chilli. What was brought out looked different from what I'm used to. The version at this restaurant had some kind of hot sauce all over it. It looked more like sweet and sour pork than pork with salt and chilli. When we asked the owner (?) about our dish he said that a lot of their patrons prefer the version with sauce. So, I guess they aren't that traditional with their dishes? 

At a table nearby their order came out wrong. They had ordered 2 shrimp fried rice and 1 chicken. They got 2 chicken fried rice instead. The owner was good to take it back and redo their order. 

Just disappointed."}
