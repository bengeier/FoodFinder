{"text":"First visit but not the last. Great food, atmosphere, service, and price. When you walk in to this open room it might remind you of the place down the street, well it is that place. A young couple with a great story working in the family establishment for a couple of years. Rantoul needs quality restaurants and this is definitely a hit with me.  We enjoyed Jalapeno Poppers, Horseshoes (hamburger smothered with great french fry and cheese layer) and a Chicken wrap with Waffle Fry side. Now these are about as simple as it gets which makes a great test of whether they can prepare and serve food. Wow, they made a solid hit."}
{"text":"This place was great.  We thought it was just regular bar food, but they also have mexican dishes and empanadas.  I enjoyed a $3.50 margarita that was delicious and a shrimp and steak salad.   The server and cook were super nice.  Get out and support this business.  Your tummy will be happy."}
