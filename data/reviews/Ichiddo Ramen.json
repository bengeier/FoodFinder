{"text":"Niku Soba Ramen...my favorite but daughter loved the Char Siu Ramen. Nice modern ramen house decor. Will definitely return. Great location, too."}
{"text":"The chopsticks are interesting. I took a picture of it. I first thought it was a give away take home souvenir because I was there on Wednesday 10/11/17 their Grand Opening Day. But it was not - My question is how do you clean and sanitize the most fancy pair of chopsticks for commercial restaurant use. I really think their portion is really small. My Dad used to say - you must fill your customer with food when they come to your restaurant. I guess the word is 'satisfy' well I came. I try. I will most likely not going to come back unless I know they will increase the portion. good luck guys. The food actually tasted ok."}
{"text":"Nice decor. Friendly staff. I ordered the beef ramen and flavor was pretty good, but not enough ramen!! Come on man it's a ramen restaurant!! Show me the ramen!! Not worth the price. I was still hungry! Too bad I wanted to like this place."}
{"text":"Not very good service.. My party of 4 waited over 30 minutes for our appetizers of 1 order takoyaki and 2 char siu buns..  Only the takoyaki came and we never got the buns. But...  They put it on our bill.  They also messed our order.  My bf said no bamboo shoots and black fungus,  but he gets them in his ramen....  I do not know why they took forever when it was just us and another party of 5 in the restaurant... They had 2 waitresses, but everything was messed up.  Food was a bit pricey and does not even compare to other ramen places I've been to.  Our bill was $55+ for 4 ramens and 1 order of takoyaki.  

Ambience: quiet
Food: below average and pricey
Service: off and slow


Will not be coming back to this place."}
{"text":"First time in Ichiddo Ramen. we had pork bun, tofu bum,calamari and gyoza for appetizers. All of them tasted delicious.i got Niku Soba Ramen, very flavorful ramen for Tonkotsu lovers. Plentiful ramen for a single bowl."}
{"text":"Loved the takoyaki and donburi! My friends had the ramen, especially the shredded spicy cha sky ramen and crispy chicken ramen, which were really yummy!"}
{"text":"Really good food and great service as well. The beef ramen is very flavorful, we will be back."}
{"text":"This is now my favorite Asian restaurant.  From their pork buns to the ramen and donburi.  Better than Monta Chaya."}
{"text":"great restaurant, the ramen was delicious and the service was great and it wasn't too expensive either. Definitely going to come back."}
{"text":"it's nice to see a new ramen joint in the Henderson area, especially with monta chaya closed now. place is very nice and I like the feel of the place. also, there's not many places in Vegas that serves tsukemen, and it's pretty good here with the spicy broth."}
{"text":"The char siu ramen and gyoza hit the spot for me. Hot green tea was also good. Convenient location for those on this side of town."}
{"text":"Good service once you walk in a lot of sitting area for a small place & clean.  Ramen & other food was very good!! We ordered vegetable ramen, seafood ramen, beef teriyaki ramen & I had the chicken ramen the broth was tasty I did  ask for more chili oil to make it more spicy which made it even better. This is our new go to place for ramen every-time were here in Vegas."}
{"text":"Service was delightful, atmosphere was great, and the chopsticks were awesome!! This ramen is delicious."}
{"text":"Been here twice now. Went back to get a second taste before settling in my opinion. I had the crispy chicken ramen both times. The first time the broth had a burned pot flavor, which I thought was normal until I tried my girlfriend's (she had the same thing) and it was fine. Same thing the second time but I scooped out most of the brunt specks and it tasted alright. Wasn't too spicy, but as for a full flavor? It left something to be desired. The service was also pretty barebones, but I didn't expect top of the line, it's a quick ramen spot. All in all, it was whatever. Fifty fifty chance to go back. Give it a try. Or don't. It's whatever."}
{"text":"this was a really great ramen restaurant! the atmosphere is amazing and food is just as great. i highly recommend coming here if you aren't interested in driving all the way to chinatown for quality japanese dining."}
{"text":"This is our 3rd time here and food is excellent and affordable. Charsiu Ramen is our fave. This place is never crowded we get seated as soon as we enter the door and because we already know what to order we never wait more than 10 minutes for our order to come out. Friendly staff too.."}
{"text":"Just wanted to thank the Ichiddo staff for their patience & promptness. We were waited on by multiple servers that were quick to get our orders in and plated to us. 

We came in for the first time tonight because my mom was craving ramen for her birthday! Immediately after being seated; myself, three siblings, and grandmother ordered appetizers before our server even finished handing out place settings.. he was very kind about a whole bunch of items being shouted out to him at once, as all our servers were throughout the whole night as we continued to order many items one after the other. 

We were the largest party in at the time and honestly the loudest but I was quick to feel reassured that we weren't a bother once they presented my mother with complimentary mochi ice cream & gifted my younger sister with a bag of Chinese candies for knowing Chinese (the staff was multicultural but very knowledgeable in Japanese cuisine & staying true to form btw). 


Everything was very yummy so we had back to back orders in of most of the items such as the...
salted cucumber - not salty at all which is great.. it was a flavor very new & different from others.. very addicting! 

gyoza - my sister's husband had gyoza for the first time and he himself ordered 3

calamari - Japanese calamari is a must try -much thinner & crispier - as well as a different flavor profile than Italian calamari 

We also ordered the:
Sweet potato fries - not salty at all [ as they should be ] nicely fried waffle cut fries that were not too oily to the touch & didn't give you the overwhelming feel of eating fried food 

Tofu Buns - had mine with no mayo since I am vegan
Vegetarian Dry Ramen -

Chicken wings - spicy sauce 
Chicken Kara Age -

{"text":"Came here during the holidays to visit my family. Heard that this is a new ramen shop, so we went to try it. The feel of this place feels very modern. I really enjoy the layout of their interior. It's very clean, the staffs are friendly, and there are so many selections on their menu.

We ordered two ramen bowls; Char Siu Ramen and Beef Ramen Spicy, and one stir fried seafood noodle. The broth of the Ramen was pretty good, the noodles are tender, it doesn't feel overcooked or undercooked, and the Char Siu pieces were chewable. There were at least 3 pieces in the bowl which is a lot! (Consider that a good thing!) The Stir-Fried noodle was amazing. Everyone at the table enjoyed that more than the Ramen soup. There was a hint of spicy powder but that is to give it flavor. The seafood is not overwhelming so it is very delicious. 

Overall of this place, I really enjoy my stay in Vegas. The staffs here are nice and best of all, there is no wait! It got busier a little after 6:30."}
{"text":"The flavor of the broth was really good with deep flavors and the noodles definitely premium. The service was over all good. My family of 4 ordered ramen but I decided to add another entrée so I picked the char su  rice dish.  When the ramen came I was hungry and forgot about the rice dish so did the the staff. That was kind of a bummer I was still hungry."}
{"text":"We are beyond happy that we have a new Ramen place to go to. They recently shut down our favorite spot, \"Munta\" and here's a their replacement. YUMMY! Noodles and broth in point! We will be back with the family!!"}
{"text":"Tried this place out since Monta on eastern closed down. Very nice decor. Friendly staff. Ramen was decent, can't beat Monta or Ramen Sora.. but it is definitey worth the try!"}
{"text":"Henderson has been lacking on the ramen places, but this place does the trick. Though a little more expensive compared to other ramen places, the ramen they serve are very good quality. My friend and I weren't too hungry when coming here, but we wanted to try it out. We shared the short rib appetizer and the house special Char Siu Ramen. 

The short ribs were not what we expected; I was expecting a sweeter flavor, but the short ribs were savory and salty. The meat was savory and tender and grilled to perfection. The only complaint I had was that only 4 pieces were served for $6 and some of the pieces were quite fatty for my liking. Now for the ramen. We had the Char Siu Ramen, which had an impressive 3 pieces of pork belly (where most ramen places I've been to only have 1 piece). The half egg was cooked perfectly, with a creamy yolk center. The dish was served with thin ramen and it had a great bite to it, while the broth was salty and, smooth, and creamy and very delicious. The oils in it were not overpowering at all and accentuated the flavors in the broth. 

I would recommend giving this place a try. Their ramen is great and their appetizers are just as good!"}
{"text":"Today I went to this restaurant because Ramen and noodles was my flavor.This place was so good,noodles is so delicious and everything is wonderful!Chif's did a great job!Thank you so much
Very like it!"}
{"text":"Came here having really high hopes for a ramen place close by but was extremely disappointed. Waited 30 minutes for appetizers that were given to the only other table in the restaurant.  After addressing it, they only gave us 1 of 2 appetizers ordered and forgot the 2nd one. 

When the ramen came, it wasn't as great as we'd hope to have it. The char siu was fairly dry and noodles undercooked.

Overall, was not a pleasant experience and would not recommend this and will not come back here."}
{"text":"Its a good place to eat. The portion size of the ramen seemed on the smaller side, but they make up for it with the quality of their food."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I enjoy sitting next to each other, not across from one another. I had asked the lady waitress if we can have a table that allows me to sit next to my boyfriend. Her answer (with an attitude) was, \"that is for only 4 people\", and gave a nasty look. I just settled for the two seating table because I was hungry and wanted to eat. She took our order and she had a hard time understanding my order. Thankfully another gentleman helped us out and took our orders. Our original waitress DID NOT come back to our table to refill our waters, or ask if the food was okay - nor did she ask if we needed anything else. She could've easily came to our table because she wasn't helping any other customers, instead she stood behind the desk and continued to give dirty looks. It took another gentlemen to realize that we were done eating and that we wanted the check. That lady waitress needs to learn proper manners. 

- 1 insufficient customer service 
- 1 attitude"}
{"text":"ordered for pickup last week at night time. I arrived few minutes early and waited. i live literally 2 minutes away and when i opened up my food, it was cold. If you didnt want to cook food 30 minutes before closing, just say so and we will happily understand. I own restaurant here in Vegas too and will understand. Better then prepping shit. 

The dumplings were good tho!"}
{"text":"Very nice staff here. Nice little building and atmosphere as well. I was in the neighborhood since I was working here in Henderson for the day. Everything came out quick. After visiting Japan this last May all I can do is compare what I tried from there now. It is delicious here. A good amount of options, and also friendly for people who are vegetarian. If you're around, give it a try."}
{"text":"If this is your first foray into the world of ramen, then this new place, Icchido Ramen will do just fine. This place works in a pinch, and convenient location for Anthem residents. 

Now if you are a ramaniac, you'll find this place okay. I liked Icchiddo's Ramen noodles. The miso broth is good. The tonkatsu broth falls a bit short for me though. It's missing that umami ness.... Blame my obsession to Ohjah for that.

The dining area is spacious and beautiful...and clean. Cool wall art/mural. The staff is friendly and attentive.

The prices are slightly higher than my favorite place, but if we're in the area, Im open and dont mind coming here when out with friends."}
{"text":"Love this place! Different and really nice flavors, and the staff was extremely nice and friendly. We will be back, happily!"}
{"text":"Waiting for ichiddo ramen long time. So happy it's open right now. So beautiful place and she food very awesome and delicious . I will come back again!"}
{"text":"So good! Welcome to the neighborhood! Worth the visit! We had pork buns and each a different ramen. The soy based ramen was great and I added the fried tofu. The other was teriyaki which was sweeter then expected, but still tasty."}
{"text":"Cheap ingredients and watered down flavor.  Skip this spot. It tastes like doctored up College Ramen packs."}
{"text":"Service is good. Food came out in a reasonable time. Over priced. Not enough food comes out for the price. Ramen was very oily. Char siu was over cooked. Ramen didn't taste that good. Kinda ashamed as a Japanese that this \"ramen\" is served at a restaurant . I'm sad people eat this thinking this is what ramen is suppose to taste like.... This is not ramen. I will definitely not go back."}
{"text":"I went here a couple times and I was greatly pleased their krispy chicken ramen is super duper good it's my favorite and it always leaves me craving for more. It's environment is really nice too I love the spoon decorated wall they have."}
{"text":"I thought I had left a review the first time I tried this place out shortly after Grand Opening but that doesnt seem to be the case. So needed to try again to remind myself what I like/dislike. 

The broth is good. The half boiled egg is good although you only get a half an egg (I prefer a full egg). The noodles weren't cooked all the way so I had to let them soak in the hot broth for several minutes before attempting to eat them. The Chashu was disappointing. It wasnt melt in your mouth like its expected to be. And the portion size to cost ratio makes it ridiculously expensive. I can get a larger bowl with more toppings for the same price I paid for this small bowl today. 

Its great a ramen place opened up on this side of town and I will be back with friends who live here but I will be sticking to China Town for my ramen. 

See my other reviews for ramen places in town."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this place and it was a huge disappointment. 

Atmosphere and the inside of the restaurant was beautiful. Staff was extremely nice. 

The gyoza's were okay. meh 

The char siu ramen was very disappointing. Extremely tasteless, and the broth was flavorless. Noodles were hard. The char siu meat was basically a fried ham steak. I couldn't even eat it because it was so gross. 

You know when you are at a restaurant and the water from the machine that has that weird yuck after taste? The entire soup was like that. 

There went my 34$"}
{"text":"I had high hopes for the reviews given here. 
 
The ramen menu was slightly confusing. 

The appetizers were all incredibly underwhelming. The short ribs had no flavor without adding salt myself. The takoyaki was undercooked with very little pieces of tako. The karaage wasn't very crispy and the sauce that came with it was awkwardly watery. The bun had so much mayo and lettuce I forgot there was pork in there. 

Last but not least, the ramen. The flavor was painfully light and the menu stated that it comes with black garlic oil which was no where to be found in my soup. 

I will most likely never come back and I really hope monta opens up sooner than later. We need good ramen in Henderson!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars really. Overall, a good broth but a few details were missing and service was a little slow.

Tried the tsukemen ramen, a little pricey at about $12. I'm used to cold noodles and super hot, almost lava hot, broth. We got room temp noodles and warm broth. Okay, no big deal. I usually prefer bigger/thicker noodles but that's just nitpicking. The broth was solid, I liked that it was stronger and richer since it's dipping broth, and the flavor was rich and salty but not overbearing. Was served with one half egg and a single thin slice of char siu.

Don't get me wrong, this tasted fine. But with so much competition and so much good ramen in the city it's hard to give that 4 star rating. Also, no beer on the menu, and I can't lie, I always like a Super Dry with my ramen.

If they increased the portion size or decreased the price I think this would be a winner. I may return and try the other ramen and update this review. Stay tuned."}
{"text":"Yup. Pretty delicious and reasonably priced ramen. The presentation, atmosphere, and customer service are spot-on as well.  Check it out"}
{"text":"Solid traditional ramen, their Chasu is a little too tough for my liking...it is definitely to add texture to the ramen, but not my favorite. The noodles are the best I've had since Sora, which has the best noodles I've had over 20 ramen places in Vegas and SoCal."}
{"text":"Simple Ramen menu. The staff is friendly and the service is great. The crab jalapeno is one of the best appetizers! I recommend this place if you're in the Eastern and St. Rose area."}
{"text":"Extremely good flavorful food and the service here is top notch and was just amazing definitely come by here and try the food."}
{"text":"I like this place a lot. I'm a ramen guy and been to Japan 7 times. I'm also full Japanese, it's not your traditional style but I think it's cool and taste great! Plus it's the only option near Henderson."}
{"text":"It was a rainy day and me and my sis were craving ramen. Usually wed go to Monta Chaya, and we came here hoping we'd get something similar ... I ordered the Kimchi Ramen, and the broth was quite oily. It tasted as if there was chemicals in my soup. But, the charsu ramen was pretty delicious. If you're looking for something like the shoyu ramen at monta, order the charsu ramen. The gyoza was alright, the sauce was sweet and not quite the best. Pretty good, but will not be returning."}
{"text":"The staff tried their best to do with who they had on staff.  They had a hostess and a cook and someone else during the lunch hour.  I ordered the Tsukemen dipping noodle.  It was a plate of cold noodles with a spicy or more concentrated broth.  The broth was cold and the hostess/waitress reheated it in the microwave.  I know it was reheated because when she came back-the bowl was hot too. The amount of noodles for $13+ was not enough. I told the waiter/cook for another serving of noodles, he was all sweaty and confused and then 15 minutes later he came back with an entire order.  I just wanted extra noodles!!! I felt bad but, that's not my fault he couldn't understand English and/or he wasn't paying attention.  
The prices are a bit higher here and the broth was nothing to rave about. I also had an itty bitty piece of overcooked pork, not the melt in your mouth kind of deal. Overall, the food reminded me of hot water with salt, the amount of noodles was atrocious and the service could use a tweak, but at least they were nice about it. 
Oh yeah, on my husband's to go order, I asked for pickled ginger..and they said they usually charge !.75 cents for it, but this time, it was free! Imagine that?! Being charged for a small condiment after spending $25!!!"}
{"text":"I am a fan!  My wife and I ordered beef and pork belly ramen respectively and it satisfied our cravings. Just enough spice and the broth was so tasty. We also tried the aged tofu and I will order it again when we come back! Awesome place!"}
{"text":"The vegetarian ramen broth is one of the tastiest ones I've had. Many vegetarian ramen broths are much too watery. This place has got it just right. Come here if you enjoy creamy vegetarian ramen broths! I'm glad I did! Service was great too. The workers are super friendly and helpful in every way."}
{"text":"Great place! The decor is very cute and the ambience is great. The service was amazing, we were recommended great choices and they were very attentive at all times. The ramen and soup were tasty, no need to bring your own lemons Generous on the meat portions. Overall, a very good experience and completely recommend."}
{"text":"I had a all-you-can-eat buffet at Umiya earlier.  
I seldomly have noodles in buffet.  
For fun, I tried the Tonkotsu Ramen.  Both Ramen and the soup are very very yammy!!! I seldomly drink the noodles soup, but I drank all the Tonkosu soup in Umiya!

I couldn't forget the yammy taste, always wanted to have Tonkotsu Ramen again.  

So I first tried Ramen Sora on Springs Mountain.  It was ok, but disappointed compare it to the Tonkotsu Ramen in Umiya.  

Then I tried another place - Ohjah Ramen on Horizon Ridge, Henderson.  The noodles are very thin and disappointed about the taste again compare to Umiya. 

Then I tried another place - Ichiddo Ramen on Eastern Ave.  Same type of very thin noodles as Ohjah, very disappointed again about the taste compare to Umiya. 

The problem of Umiya is, it is all-you-can-eat buffet, I don't want to pay $30 for the whole buffet because of the Tonkotsu Ramen only."}
{"text":"Ok so let me start by saying I love my ramen...i found this place by accident getting donuts. Brought my family ...char siu ramen was actually very tasty..seafood ramen was a bust...friend rice was good...nikku  ramen was so so as with the beef ramen. The gyoza was run of the mill. Pork bun was a nice twist , the short ribs lack marinate but was fairly tasty. This visit food wise was decent,if I don't want to drive far I will come back.service was odd...the young lady must have been having a rough day and the young man was very friendly and up beat. So like I said earlier...if I am feeling lazy I might come back. The Apple candy is reminiscent of my youth."}
{"text":"I have been here a couple times. I like this place! No, it's not in Chinatown. However, living in Henderson, it's very close! If I need a ramen fix, this is the nearby spot. I liked the restaurant that was here previously too. Not sure if it's the same owners. The decor is very classic and simple Japanese. Lovely! The servers are very attentive and kind. Everyone always has a smile. It's a wonderful place to dine! The ramen broth is good, but it could be better. I'm missing some umami, I think. Love all the other stuff! Noodles are great, the soft-boiled eggs are yummy and the meats are done well. If you ask really nice, they'll bring you a side of chili oil if you like a dah spice, like me. Henderson, get your ramen on and let's keep this place around! It's awesome! The gyoza is very good too!"}
{"text":"Very sweet staff here, very attentive! Keep checking on us!  Pretty decorations, simple but unique! Love the big table in the middle, great and perfect for big party! No rush beThe taste of appetizers ( we got different ones every time ) and broth are very flavorful. They have perfect portion! Anyway, our newest and ONLY ramen spot now! Will come back for everyone's birthday ! ( they are so sweet to have Little balloon toys for little kids, my babies love it)"}
{"text":"Very good!food good service good! Thank goodness I have to go tomorrow to see my mom and dad and I'll be sure I will see if you have time to"}
{"text":"We went last night for dinner. The food was good, overall a perfect portion to not feel like you are overdoing it, but are satisfied. We all had different ramens (veggie, soba, char sui) and all were finished completely. The only negatives were 1)wings were super salty and our 2 orders came 20 minutes apart although ordered together 2) Service was slow, both front and back of house. I will grant they are new though and wouldn't mind to try again once they settle."}
{"text":"Super cute environment, however no liquor license which put a dent in my dinner plans. The ramen noodles came stuck together in a big clunk and we had to work them apart. Seemed as though it was pulled out of the fridge and then poured the broth over the noodles which lacked flavor."}
{"text":"These guys have stepped it up the last 2 visits.  Admittedly, there is not another ramen place in the area and my cravings could not pass up another try. Yesterday ramen came out fast, hot and tasty.  Beverage service was prompt and place was very clean."}
{"text":"Perfect for a Ramen spot! Love the food and service was great. Everything I've ordered has been good from Appetizers to Ramen. Atmosphere and decors are great too! I'll definitely recommend this place to my friends and family."}
{"text":"Pretty good food overall. Fresh made gyoza and a good, grilled char siu (chashu at other places). The ramen broth was good - we tried their tonkatsu and seafood. The Char Siu in the tonkatsu was grilled so it didn't really melt like we find at other spots.

They do a house made \"spice paste\" that wasn't very spicy, and was like a cold ground beef chili. Kind of confusing and I'm glad it got put on the side or it would have been a pretty big turn off for my soup."}
{"text":"Finally found a good Ramon on this side of town! I found the pot stickers are great the spicy chicken is also great!"}
{"text":"Ichiddo is a modern, trendy ramen place. The setting was pretty hip, the food was decent, but the biggest standout was the phenomenal service. 

I stopped by this place before hitting the road back to LA because, hey, I'm always craving ramen. My choice was the standard Char Siu (chashu) ramen with additional cha shu slices ($1/per piece) and homemade spicy sauce (0.75) I also tried the Tsukemen dipping ramen. 

The char siu ramen was decent, my favorite part was the perfectly cooked noodles. The broth was pretty flavorful but lacking spice, even after adding the House spicy sauce. In fact, the term \"sauce\" is pretty misleading. It is served as a scoop of ground meat that is marinated in a chili sauce, which completely threw me off, and it wasn't spicy at all. For reference, I think hot Cheetos are super spicy. 

Tsukemen is served with the noodles cold and separate from the broth, which should be more concentrated in flavor. I'm not a fan of dipping ramen bc I'm lazy and would probably dump it altogether in the same bowl, but my boyfriend liked it! Overall, 4/5 experience !"}
{"text":"My nephew and I wanted to get some ramen so we turned to where else?  Yup Yelp it was.  We read the reviews and decided to try this place out as it was close to where we were.  We both decided on the Char Siu Ramen ($11.95) and got the Pork Bun ($3.00). 

The break down:

The pork bun was nice and tasty and yes I would definitely get it again. 

Ramen:
Broth:  Nice, light and refreshing pork bone broth. It's not thick and heavy like some other places 

Noodles: traditional Japanese ramen noodles. To me it was a little on the thinner side but good. 

Char Siu:. On the thin side. Maybe because of that it is cooked more than the soft falling apart ones that I'm used to. It is tasty though. 

The service here is really good then again we came in between lunch and dinner so it wasn't full to capacity. 

I wanted to give it 3.5 stars but decided to round up until I found out that they charge for chili oil and house sauce. Who does that???  I'm sorry, I guess it's either my Chinese side coming out or I've never experienced a place charging me for the oil and sauce so I had to down grade to three stars. 

If you are in the area and in the mood for ramen, then come and give this place a try especially if you don't like thick rich broth.  If your not, it isn't one of those places you go out of your way for."}
{"text":"Thank you, Ichiddo, for being so accommodating of our little one! The ramen was delicious and the gyoza was very good. The noodles were perfectly cooked and even though I spent the first 12 min feeding my niece. The noodles had the perfect chew and the broth was a light, Tokyo style. Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"2nd time here...got my donburi Chirashi rice bowl....Definately gonna get that again....my tastebuds literally melted with the sauce....so yummmmmmmmm"}
{"text":"NOTHING ABOUT THIS PLACE WAS GOOD! First off, the service? Or should I say what service? Absolutely terrible.  Now I would over look it if the food was good, but no. You could make tastier ramen from an instant noodle ramen. The broth didn't taste authentic, actually just meh. My daughter also ordered the short ribs, it is like the worst short ribs I've ever eaten. I'm a big guy so I love meat, but the short ribs was like marinated in pure salt. It was so salty, I couldn't eat it. I had to return it. They forgot to take it off my check, so that was another 20 minute ordeal for the servers. I was on this side of town and really just wanted to have some ramen. I feel like it was a total waste of my money because I paid for extra stress in my life and terrible food."}
{"text":"After moving here 2 months ago from SoCal, my mission was to find a ramen place equal to Hokkaido Santouka Ramen. Well after trying many ramen places in and around the area, we found this gem and le me tell you, it's fucken amazing! The service, the food, the ambience, the decor, and did i mention the food!!!!? Yummmm! I ordered the Char Sui ramen in spicy broth, the broth is everything!!! We also ordered the short ribs, char sui bun,  and the chicken stir fry ramen! All items were delicious, well seasoned, hot and fresh. The short ribs are simply amazing, great flavor, seasoning and sear. The char sui buns' spices were on point and the stir fry ramen was a great twist with lots of flavor and fresh veggies. Everyone is friendly, especially our waiter Kevin, who although might know very little English is so helpful at explaining the menu and providing excellent service. If you're looking to dine in a clean, friendly, delicious and inexpensive place, this is it!"}
{"text":"I am usually cautious when it comes to ramen places because I have a very picky palate but this restaurant was very accomodating to my preferences and they assisted so kindly as well. 

The size of the restaurant is moderate sized to accomodate the ramen demand of the area with about 9 various tables, ranging from 2-person to 12-person groups. The atmosphere has a modern design with wooden furniture; it is not overwhelming and the overhead music is not distracting. The chopsticks are really cool looking too. They have a screw-like appearance at the bottom so it helps with grasping food better.

Many of their soups have spicy chili oil added in already so I was worried it might be too spicy for me. My chicken soup was delicious, but I think next time, I'll ask for less chili oil. Will definitely come back again for my next ramen fix in the Henderson area."}
{"text":"We sampled about 5 dishes and most were about average. But the Niku Soba Ramen broth blew me away! It was rich, flavorful, and the grilled onions gave it a hint of sweetness that I absolutely loved. I was expecting the usual rolled up roasted char siu so the thinly sliced, crispy pork on top of my soup made be a bit apprehensive, but it was surprisingly good.

I am usually quite apprehensive about asian restaurants this far from chinatown, but it was a pleasant surprise and a decent option for the Henderson area. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Tried this place because Monta got closed down on this side of town. The atmosphere itself is nice. It's really spacious and the decor is cute. Service, however, isn't very attentive. The food is definitely something I wouldn't come back for. It is way too oily and salty. The rice dishes are also extremely salty. Flavor wise, also wasn't the best. I probably will not be back! If you're looking for good Ramen, try jinya or somewhere else. Only perk about this place is that it's the only ramen spot on this side of town right now."}
{"text":"ordered the char siu ramen. Their broth is pretty tasty but everything else is seemed okay. However I do think it is quite pricy for its small size. However, if you mentioned yelp they do take 15% off your bill (I saved $1.79 on my bowl, woot woot)"}
{"text":"The interior is not bad. I like the additional toppings you can add to your ramen. Prices are standard, menu includes appetizers, ramen, and donburi. I only tried the vegetable miso ramen and chicken ramen. They are both pretty good. I will go back again for sure."}
{"text":"Monta Chaya was our go to ramen spot in the area.  But since they have shut down to relocate, we have yet to find a back up option.  Until now.  I heard a new ramen place opened up where Noodle Pot II use to reside.  I was craving ramen on this particular day and decided to check it out.

They did a great job renovating the place.  It has a simple and modern feel compared to what it was before. Absolutely loved the soup spoon wall.  Very art deco feel.  We came during lunch time and it was fairly quiet.  

Ordered the short ribs for an appetizer and Char Siu ramen.  The short ribs were super fatty and not very appetizing.  It had a \"lamb\" smell to it and although I really wanted to send it back, my kid was hungry and so was I.  I wish I went with a different appetizer option.  The crab jalapeno looked interesting and I thought about getting the Tokoyaki as well.  Maybe next time.  The Char Siu ramen was noted as spicy and although I love spicy, I was also sharing with my kid so I asked for the spicy oil and sauce on the side.  The Char Siu was very tasty and had good texture.  The spicy sauce was delish.  And the noodles were quite good.  

Not a bad alternative to Monta when you're craving ramen.  We'll be back!  Thank you for opening a ramen spot in the area Ichiddo!  We really needed it."}
{"text":"The char sui ramen was very good. The pork was flavorful and had a lot of goodies in it. The broth was delicious. Service was really good. How can you go wrong when the waitress kinda smells like peaches.  Right?!

Any constructive criticism would be:

A little heavy on the green onion, the egg was a little wired like a half processed egg. And the nori was a big sheet and I would recommend shredding it up a bit. 

I would recommend and will come back again. Always need another round to make sure it is as good as the first."}
{"text":"I just tried this ramen place for the first time tonight, and I'm very impressed. The decor is amazing, and I love the fact that this spot is very spacious unlike most ramen places. You don't have to worry about your private conversations as this place gives you plenty of room away from the next table.

I tried the char siu ramen, and it was so good. The base for the soup is amazing and has a great amount of flavor without being too much. What I love most bough is the ramen itself; I love the texture of it and it taste fantastic as well. I added fried tofu to my ramen and it made it even more memorable.

I'm so glad this place is near my house and that I no longer have to drive far whenever I have the craving for ramen. I will definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"I was having a boba break at the Matcha House when I was looking up restaurants nearby to eat at.
Ichiddo Ramen was 1 minute on foot, so I decided to try it out despite the reviews. 
For the most part, service was pretty good and the ramen as well. I got my ramen quickly and the server checked up on me a good amount of times. He was incredibly nice when explaining some items on the menu for me. 
Now for the food, I had the Crispy Chicken Ramen and the crispy chicken held out pretty well. I was thoroughly surprised. The broth was slightly spicy and paired fairly well with everything else in the bowl. I enjoyed it very much!
The interior holds one wall with soup spoons elegantly stringed together and the dining space itself is huge. I give them a point for that because other ramen joints are just crowded and I absolutely hate the long lines. On the other hand, the restroom is uninviting haha... try not to use it if you can. 
Overall, I'll come back here for the convenience and I'll be sure to try some of their desserts as well."}
{"text":"I came here on a whim wanting some ramen and I wasn't disappointed. They have a super tasty pork bun appetizer and the bbq pork (char sui) ramen is delicious. It's like a mix of Chinese and Japanese.  You don't have options of broths but honestly I didn't care the miso broth was so good, and for me, the ramen bowl was the perfect amount. They offer orders of extra broth or noodles if you really need more. This place seems really authentic and definitely worth a try. The servers are really nice and everybody's so polite. 5 stars, everything was great :)"}
{"text":"Amazing food and amazing flavor!!! Love finding new ramen places in Vegas. Quick and accurate must try the chicken bun."}
{"text":"My secretary and I have been on a search of Ramen Restaurants for the past several months.  We went here for lunch on Tuesday.  We had the Gyoza and the marinated pork as an appetizer.  The Dumplings were perfection with a nice crunch. The pork was delicious.  It was cut very thin and seems like a different style of pork compared to what we are used to.  Very good.  I had the Niku Soba Ramen with extra egg and corn and she had the char Siu Ramen with added sea weed and egg. They were both delicious.  We both agreed that there was not as much broth as we would have liked.  Aside from that this was a delicious destination."}
{"text":"2 stars due to the staff is very friendly and they try.. I would not recommend going here for ramen very greasy my soup was not hot at all I sent it back it took very long time for it to return to the table I gave this place a second chance first time was a carry out super greasy.. The chicken buns sauce extremely salty.. I wish they could get it together they had advantage being the only Ramen spot in our area. The place is very clean but I'm sure they lost quite a few customers this evening the place was very busy and only had two servers very understaffed poor management decision on Valentine's Day. I watched several customers upset waiting on their billsNot getting the food that they ordered had to get some to go. Waiting on customers that were their customers out of order it was a fiasco. So based on that second time I will not be returning nor will I be recommending this spot.it's sad."}
{"text":"Loved the fried ramen, and the salted cucumber!  This is the best ramen place I've been to!  Also had the fried chicken bun, which was delicious, wanted to have more but too full.  Price is average, not crowded."}
{"text":"I like this place a lot. Their kimchi ramen is really good. I recommend this place . Its clean and the food is very delicious"}
{"text":"I've been looking for a good, nearby ramen place after the Monta on Serene closed, and I think Ichiddo takes that place nicely. The atmosphere is very classy and comfy, and the servers are prompt and polite. The prices are slightly higher than average (~$10-13 per bowl) but they fit the neighborhood. The charsiu is delicious and the egg is perfectly cooked and marinated."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!! The restaurant is clean and super cute! I love how they re-made the place, the last restaurant in their was blah and seemed kinda gross. 

Char siu Ramen was soooo good!!! The noodles had a firm bite, broth was perfect, egg cooked perfectly, just amazing! 

We also ordered the Age Tofu and Jalapeño crab poppers. Age wasn't what i was expecting... I thought Age tofu was short for agedashi tofu, fried tofu crispy on the outside soft on the inside swimming in some type of broth sprinkled with bonito flakes. Their Age tofu is also fried but didn't have the broth or bonito flakes, instead they drizzled some type of sweet sauce. It was good but not what i expected. 

Jalapeno poppers were good and super crispy. The imitation crab was tucked in nicely in the jalapeño too!"}
{"text":"It's ok. The decor is nice but the ramen itself did not stand out for me. The noodles seriously looked exactly like the ones from the supermarket. 
I expected a bit more authenticity."}
{"text":"Pretty small portions and very thin chasiu. Broth has a slight kick but only after pouring a cup of their house \"spicy sauce\" which is just chili oil and a $0.75 upcharge. The noodles were fine but pretty unremarkable. Everything about he meal was fine.  Menu had unique options like crispy chicken meat and stir fry ramen, but I always judge a restaurant like this or their normal ramen. Pricy at $12 for a normal bowl with additional topping at about $1 a piece. I guess if you're in Henderson and craving ramen, this place can get the job done, but I'd recommend taking the trek 15 more minutes to Spring Valley or China Town for true ramen royalty in Las Vegas"}
{"text":"So I've been avoiding this place when I saw it was a Japanese Chinese fusion ramen shop. Once I see a fusion menu I don't even bother looking into it. Don't get me wrong, I'm down for the beauty of blending but I take ramen serious. But I was craving it and sometimes goin our to spring mtn is too much work. 
 
The place was clean, decor was trendy, and big enough. The staff was super polite and welcoming. 

My husband ordered tsukemen ramen (dipping ramen) and I got the char siu ramen with gyoza. Gyoza could've been a little more crispy and the sauce was too sweet for me, but my husband liked it. (Im more of a straight up shoyu and vinegar sauce person) Now for the important part: the ramen was A-maze-balls!!!! The noodles were chewy and not over or undercooked. The broth was rich but not too salty. The slices of meat were i think grilled before being placed in the bowl. The egg was cooked perfectly where it wasn't runny but it wasn't a boiled egg. It was just a beautiful bowl of noodles with super hot broth. I think that's important in ramen, the soup has to be hot!!! Like I wanna be scared to burn my tongue but I won't stop eating cause it's that good. Eating good ramen has to be a little suicidal lol"}
{"text":"Ever since Monta closed down on Eastern, I've been feeling a bit of ramen void in my life. I mean there's always Sora in Chinatown, but it's just out of the way. I've been meaning to try this place since it's opened.. and alas, it was just eh. 

It wasn't disgusting to where it'll warrant 1-2 stars, but it was just okay. The broth was super lacking. Lacking that certain umami flavor. The beef slices in my ramen, super bland. No flavor whatsoever. Tasted like I was chewing on old leather. The egg though was cooked pretty good. The noodles had enough spring to the chew, which I liked. All in all, nothing to get excited about. 

I'll just have to keep making my trek to Chinatown for some yummy ramen."}
{"text":"Love love love this place! Costumer service is on point and fast. It's so nice to walk in and feel that you are a priority. Very decent prices and a great variety of add ons and ramen. 
Beautiful art and decor, feels warm and cozy perfect for the comfort food they serve. 
I eat here once or twice a week at least. 
I HIGHLY recommend!!
I ordered to go and the packaging was also excellent!!!"}
{"text":"Everything was delicious, great service, the servers were very attentive and polite! I'll definitely be coming here again!"}
{"text":"Some great things come from St Paul and Minneapolis, MN like SPAM, Prince, Terry Lewis and Jimmy Jam.  Who would have thought that great ramen would come from there as well?  Welcome Ichiddo Ramen to Henderson, I've been waiting for you.

Winter is coming and so I have been on the hunt for a new ramen restaurant in the Henderson/Anthem/Seven Hills area. While searching Yelp, Ichiddo Ramen came up. Yay! 

As I made my way to the restaurant, I realized Ichiddo Ramen is in the same exact spot as Noodle Pot 2. Now I've been to Noodle Pot a few times, and it was my go to place for noodle soup. I was somewhat sad to see it gone. 


Decor
Because I've been here several times before, I wasn't sure what to expect. From the outside looking in, you can't see anything except your reflection because of the tinted windows. So far, everything looks the same except the sign on the door.  If you've ever been to NP2, then you remember that it was all what walls, round tables with red plastic table cloths and traditional Chinese restaurant décor.  To my delight, the whole restaurant has been updated. It is truly a contemporary ramen restaurant with the horizontal woods divider, wood floors, wooden tables, black seats, large shared seating area in the middle of the restaurant instead of counter seating. And best of all ramen mural! I so want that in my dining room.

Because few people know that the restaurant is open, it was empty. I was able to choose my own seat and chose to sit in the corner next to the window where the sun was coming in.


Food
I ordered my usual gyoza ($4.95 for 6-pieces) while I peruse the menu. Two things that stand out. 1. No broth options. No big deal as long as the broth is good. 2. The price. It seemed a little higher compared to what I am used to. 

For ramen, I got the Shredded Char Siu @ $9.95. It comes with shredded char siu, nori, fishcake, half boiled egg, bamboo shoots, bean sprouts, bamboo shoots, corn, pickled ginger, green onions, spicy oil, spicy sauce and soy sauce. I got it! You have to read the whole recipe to find the soup base at the end! Other ramen joints don't have as many toppings as this does, so after I did some comparison shopping, $9.95 is average cost.

Gyoza was good but the dipping sauce wasn't anything that I've ever had. It is sweeter while other restaurants are tangy because of the vinegar. I'm not a dipper, but the last couple of pieces of gyoza I had, I drowned it in the sauce. Yummy!

And then the ramen came in a tall narrow bowl. Tall narrow bowls always throws me off because it doesn't look like much food at the top, but then as you eat, it seems like it never ends.  I'm not sure why I ordered it spicy because there was a huge glob of chili on top of my ramen that I had to scoop out. After taking my picture, I sipped the broth first to check out the flavor and to check the temperature. I happy to say that the soy sauce broth is delicious. The noodles are the real deal. Although I ordered the shredded char siu, it really is more like ground pork. But that's fine. At least I had a little bit of meat. All in all, it was a really good bowl of ramen.


Customer Service, Excellent!


Great first opening day. Great food. Great price. Great décor. Great customer service. Can't wait for winter to roll in to warm me up. 5-stars for this ramen shop!"}
{"text":"I have been to many ramen restaurants over Vegas and this was one of the worst for me...
I ordered the teriyaki ton ramen. 
The bbq pork was the best part it was delicious and juicy that's what saves this place from a 2 star rating.
The broth was not flavorful and it was very greasy, the menu claimed there was spice and I barely tasted any spice..
I left feeling unsatisfied.. which sucks because Ramen is one of my all time favorite foods.
Strongly dislike having to give a ramen place 3 stars but I have to because the quality in the broth here needs to improve..."}
{"text":"Great at what they do , Ramen. Outstanding ramen broth, great ingredients; I almost never drink all the broth in any ramen house but I do here because it's flavorful without being too salty; some really good appetizers. My only knock is that you can't get unsweetened ice tea or ice green tea and maybe some sweets like a dessert would give it five stars for me. We are here weekly!"}
{"text":"I'm so glad that my wife and I tried out this new ramen spot. The broth is phenomenal and I can't seem to keep it a secret! I've been recommending it for a few weeks now to everyone. The salted cucumbers and pork bun are a couple appetizers we always get. The service here is excellent. I'm very glad this spot is so close to home. I only have 1 small issue that keeps me from giving 5 stars. The amount of broth that is served is kinda small. When paying for a $12 bowl of ramen I would expect to get enough broth . Overall though great food"}
{"text":"Not a fan of the broth or the noodle style.  I'll try again one more time and get the top picture Ramen rather than the \"Char Sui\" Ramen which was honestly bland and mediocre.  I didn't like the noodles, they felt store bought and a bit too tough.  I prefer thin noodles, but I will come again to see if they offer thin.  I didn't like the broth.  It tasted odd to me.  Not like the garlic style I was expecting.
I also had a pork bun which was a bit small compared to some other places I've been to.  Condiments are a bit lacking.  No chili oil unless you pay, no chili sauce, no regular pepper.

Small things add up.  Best thing was service and how quiet it was.  Felt nice to sit down here.  Wasn't worth the $15 I paid."}
{"text":"The service was fantastic, the place is spacious and looks great inside and out. The quality of the dining utensils and area are also a nice touch. The spicy with chicken has a nice heat to it and the veggies perfect, but I prefer the chicken not fried. The pork was probably the best, very flavorful with a nice darkening. Definitely a return visit in the future."}
{"text":"Very clean, neat looking place.
Well attended!
Good variety of ramen clear descriptions.
Glad I came :-)"}
{"text":"Delicious Ramen and bao buns, both pork and fried chicken. Tried many ramen and all were delicious. Fried chicken always crispy on the outside and juicy and tender on the inside. Always had great service"}
{"text":"The ramen broth is really greasy. Giving them a few stars since I only liked the noddles and meat toppings. There was only one server he was hard to understand I believe English was his second language but he was trying really hard and was nice. He seemed flustered and overwhelmed since there was no one else to help him on the floor. The pork buns were not good at all and the sweet potato fries didn't come with sauce or anything. The atmosphere was nice but the service and food was not that great it's one of those places you feel bad when you like ask for another bowl or fork. I told the server I was sharing my soup with my boyfriend and I never got an extra bowl, I literally ate my part of the soup small sauce bowl that our extra cabbage came in. For four people we spent $70 with tip so wouldn't come back again it's mediocre and priced high."}
{"text":"Great Food! Excellent Ramen. It's usually not crowded. Very beautiful and serene atmosphere. Been here 3 times now in the past month. I get the Veg Ramen which is great. I just wish the serving portion was larger. 
Service is also excellent. They constantly check on you. Overall, great food for the price."}
{"text":"I thought this place was really good but there was something different from the rest of the ramen I've tried. The restaurant is really cute with the spoons on the wall. 

I had the vegetable ramen, I really enjoyed the flavor and the vegetables they added into the soup. It had the bamboo shoots which I love, mushrooms, corn green onion and ginger. Nothing extravagant but tasty. 

Our friend ordered the shredded Char Siu Ramen, it looked good. She said it was better when she added more pickled ginger in it, but she couldn't figure out what she really liked about it. 

My partner ordered the Shredded Char Siu Donburi which she really enjoyed, she even saved half of it so she can eat it for dinner. 

Last a seafood ramen was ordered by our other friend. That looked really good, it had muscles, shrimp and the vegetable works. He said he wasn't wow'd by the soup but that it tasted good.

We will have to try this again, maybe it's a more than once spot to try."}
{"text":"What a cute quiet restaurant. The food was great
And so was the Customer service. Everyone should give it a try"}
{"text":"Ichiddo has replaced Noodle Pot in this location and the decor looks way nicer. It's more sleek and modern instead of looking like an outdated mom n pop Chinese restaurant. We ordered the Char Siu Ramen, chicken karaage, and Niku Soba Ramen. I really liked mine but the bf's Niku Soba broth was really salty and he had to add water to it.

Service staff was slow and seemed confused even though there was only us and 2 other tables at the time. Definitely worth the extra few mins drive to Chinatown if you want some good ramen. This one will suffice if you live in Henderson and really really really want to stay close to home."}
{"text":"This was as disappointing and overpriced restaurant meal as I've had in quite sometime. Maybe I'm out of touch but 11.95 for average lukewarm ramen seems high...The server had no personality whatsoever and was inattentive as could be. Water was never refilled, bowl not provided for sharing. I had to leave the table to ask. We were with a baby who burst out crying and we did take him out immediately. Dishes never cleared and to-go bowl not offered. To add insult to injury a cup of hot tea is 2.50. We were never offered refills of hot water. 3 bowls of Ramen 3 teas 2 cans of soda an astounding $53.00. I'm usually a very generous tipper but in this case I could barely muster the nerve to leave 10 percent...Monta, Jinya or Tetsu worth the drive. I wish we had gone to one of those instead."}
{"text":"Used the 15% coupon and wasn't charged for the soda. So happy there is finally a ramen place in Henderson. Ordered gyoza, jalapeño crab meat, char siu ramen, and beef ramen. Gyoza was average; jalapeño should've been roasted before deep fried, but still good and crab meat is imitation; ramen had great broth flavor and noodles were fully cooked. Next time I will order extra spicy. I will def be back!"}
{"text":"Our ramen was delicious, very rich and flavorful. We tried the Niku Soba with pork belly. We were looking for a good ramen place in Henderson and we found it. The gyoza was great as well.   The service was amazing and the decor is very modern and clean. We'll definitely come back."}
{"text":"I was very surprised in a good way!

The presentation and ambiance of the dining area was nice, peaceful and I really enjoyed it.

The service was very professional, very helpful and always checking on the table if we needed anything.

The food can out in great timing and it really tasted great.

Note, The one thing I would change is get rid of the can coke products and go to a fountain drink system with free refills.

I would definitely recommend this place for a nice eating environment, good selection of entrees and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Food is very good...
Very nice atmosphere 
Noticed lots of people in for lunch by themselves 
Tasty!!
Great service... Everything is fresh so be patient"}
{"text":"HELLA FIRE. The homie that served us was super nice I wish I remembered his name but I know that his fav appetizer is the cool looking fried pepper (shown below) and also he likes the fried chicken ramen and so do I  

Honestly I think the bowls are kinda deceptive cuz they don't look like allot but they filling me and the homie both killed it... soooo 

Overall, real chill vibes and cool ambiance. If you're into ramen and wanna try something new come through. But if you already know about this spot... you're dope."}
{"text":"Nice decor and lovey tableware! Food presentation is nice than most ramen spots. Flavor...I've had better. It was good but was very oily. Had the need ramen for $10.95 and ordered the gyoza for $4.95. Loved the dipping sauce for the gyoza and very friendly staff and clean restaurant. Will eat there again when this place is close."}
{"text":"Ichiddo ramen is my favorite place to eat. special Short ribs,tokoyaki and char siu ramen.the food is very delicious."}
{"text":"Super delicious! I've had the Char siu pork buns, age tofu, and crab jalepeno for apps and everything was amazing. then I got the char siu ramen, the egg and bbq pork was next level. My go-to ramen spot now!"}
{"text":"First i ordered ramen , wasn't what i expected . The waitress didn't tell me that it was pork belly so i returned it and asked for another dish. I was told i would have to pay for the first dish although i didn't even take a bite out of it . I agreed to pay but the remainer of the meal , the waitress ignored us and worst service ever !!"}
{"text":"I feel like there's not much to say about ramen joints in Vegas. Most people compare them to Monta. It's either good enough to go there or just wait in line at Monta LOL.

Anyways.

I just started working in the 89123/89052 side of town and am always trying new lunch spots. I have been here a couple of times for ramen cravings and it's pretty okay. The pork chashu definitely isn't the best. It is very flavorful but the texture is more like grilled pork belly than soft pork belly for ramen and it isn't my favorite. 

With that said this establishment is okay. I've had a few of their appetizers like the gyoza, the takoyaki, and the Karraage. Everything is just okay.

I'm a pretty simple ramen person though and usually get a tonkatsu and again they do the trick but nothing too special.

I'm usually alone on my lunch break and the staff are good so kudos to them. 

My favorite ramen place is still Fukumimi, but this is still a decent ramen spot."}
{"text":"Ive been here numerous times and had no problems.  I Actually love this place.  Tonight i ordered one order of shortribs and it was pathetic.  I asked my server why the pieces were so small,  so he went to ask the chef why it was so small and the chef said thats the way they got it.  Are you kidding me!!  That chef should be ashamed of himself for even sending it out.  Normally when something like this happens,  being the cut of the meat was so small the chef would put a piece or two extra to accommodate the portion.  Server was good but that chef that sent out that order of short ribs shame on you."}
{"text":"Absolutely love it ! Finally a ramen place in our neighborhood. Food is delicious, I got the kimchi ramen . Just the right amount of spices. Very cool ambience and the staff is super friendly."}
{"text":"Ichiddo is one of the newer Ramen joints in the Anthem area and I am a fan...!

Service:  Upon entering, we were greeted immediately and seated in the open area dining area.  The food came out timely after ordering and everyone who served us was friendly.  

Ramen & more: The Char Siu Ramen I had was very good.  The broth was tasty but not too salty which can happen as Ramen broth gets tastier/heavier.  The noodles were good and everything else in the bowl was fresh.  We tried the Char Siu Donburi. The Japanese mayo, special sauce along with other seasonings really made for a good Char Siu and rice bowl.  Nice alternative to have if you're feeling rice in a Ramen joint, it happens.

Ambiance: One big open dining room with 3 different dining areas. The Ramen Bar, the rectangular community table in middle of the room, and numerous tables lining the wall.  Ramen house vibe with dark wood everywhere on the tables, chairs and walls.  A very cool Japanese Sumo Mural and a wall of soup spoons make for some very cool decorations.  Casual, but definitely doable for a date place with the great interior.

I'm glad to find a new Ramen house on this side of town so when I'm fiending Ramen, a drive to Spring Mountain isn't necessary. Soft drinks are sold by the can here fyi.  Hopefully they'll get a soft drink fountain system soon.  I'm looking forward to checking out their other ramen bowls and dishes, but that's another Yelp tale.  =)"}
{"text":"Meh, I've experienced better. But I guess I'll do 3 stars if I'm grading on a curve.

Ichiddo Ramen is a chain originally from Minneapolis. This new outpost is in old Noodle Pot II site just around the corner from Kabob Oasis and one building over from new hot spots Matcha House and Purple Potato. I've never heard of that region as a ramen hotbed, but the location is convenient enough for me that I had to try it in case it was worth a regular visit.

They'd announced plans on Facebook for a Sunday opening, but I was told that it was postponed to Wednesday for them to make final preparations. Come Wednesday, I called and verified that they were open, then met up with some friends that night for dinner. We shared some appetizers and mostly kept separate on ramen.

\"Tokoyaki\" ($4.95): six rather small balls with the usual sauces but with lifeless bonito flakes. The octopus (tako, not toko) pieces inside each piece were really tiny. The said, the interior did have a creamy texture and the overall flavors were the same as you'd expect from more traditionally sized and portioned takoyaki, so it's a passable take if you're not too picky about the tako or the cultural knowledge / spelling awareness

Chicken Karaage ($4.95): another plate of unusually small pieces. You'll usually find large hunks of meat on this that take at least two bites to finish. However, the bite-sized portions here did have a reasonable crispy exterior, juicy interior, and proper salting. My friend complained about lack of pepper, but that's the least distressing of all of the appetizer choices which I witnessed.

Chicken Wings ($5.95): did I get teleported to the Strip? These are shockingly overpriced for three small wings. Yes, they were reasonably crispy and seasoned, but the (medium at most) spicy sauce wasn't all that special.

Niku \"Soba\" Ramen ($12.95): first off, this was served with all regular, thin ramen noodles (not especially al dente at that), and zero soba. You're calling it soba but not delivering. What gives? And then the niku part - while my Googling and conversations with more experienced friends suggest that there is some sweetness to niku broths, this was distractingly sweet to the part where the tonkotsu aspect was masked and other flavors were lost. It was like sukiyaki soup: thinly sliced meat, onions, and noodles, and no other major traditional ramen toppings (you know, like egg, kikurage, bamboo shoots) unless you count the unusually small square of nori.

Seafood Ramen ($11.95): I pretty much just tasted the broth. It was identified on the menu as a miso broth, but it didn't have much of the miso character to it. One friend noted a prominent rice wine note instead. Also, it wasn't briny or anything. Without seeing or biting into seafood, it would be very difficult to distinguish this as a \"seafood\" broth.

I asked my friends at the end whether they'd return to Ichiddo. They replied that they would go if I would, to which I remarked that I would've said that I'll tag along when they decide to go. Looks like we're at an impasse.

I didn't find any flavors or textures awful tonight, but the pricing and the flavors are not on par with the better ramen places in town. If I cast my net a little wider to include my California experiences, not to mention the praise I've heard for ramen-yas in Japan (which I've sadly not had the pleasure of visiting yet), then the ramen here does have more of a 2-star feel. Oh well, it was worth a try anyway."}
{"text":"Just tried Ichiddo Ramen for the first time and it was most excellent!  I had the spicy Kim chi ramen and it was very delicious with the perfect amount of spicy that I truly enjoy.  The atmosphere is very chill and comfortable and my food was delicious!  10/10 would go here again!  Bring your friends!"}
{"text":"First time trying this place. Pricing is about average to most ramen joints, and so were the portions. Their tonkotsu ramen was on the sweeter side; not usually a sweet type of guy but it was good. Noodles were cooked really well and had a nice flavor to them. I would come back if in the area again."}
{"text":"The taste is so so.  I prefer ramen at Monta, Jinya, Fukumimi and Ramen Kobo much more. The price is high and it isn't worth to pay for this ramen. There are so many mistakes with Japanese words on the menu and signs on the wall."}
{"text":"Since Monta Chaya in Henderson closed, I've been trucking about town and trying new ramen spots in Vegas. This place just opened about 2 weeks ago, and about 3 miles from me! Just ate it, and there are really bright things it has going for it. Great decor, very upscale for a ramen place. Love the unusual chop sticks they have, very clever.  
The ramen was decent, but not earth-shattering. Had the chashu ramen, and I did love the broth quite a bit. They grill the chashu, and it was the let-down of the meal. Dry, and not even well seasoned, like Monta always is. 

My saviour was the nitamago! Very well seasoned, with the perfect enhanced flavor of shoyu, it was a joy to scarf down those creamy and salty soft eggs. 

I'll be back."}
{"text":"This place is bomb! Living in henderson, you don't have to drive to china town for great ramen."}
{"text":"This is not an authentic ramen place. We were so disappointed! Their gyoza sauce is not the real dipping sauce. Their servers did not know the menu and can hardly speak in English. They charged for chili oil that usually is just on the table in any ramen place. Thus, this is a make a make shift ramen place."}
{"text":"My friend and I decided to try this new ramen spot after Monta has permanently closed.  I was so excited to try out this new restaurant. We ordered gyoza and ramen.  As soon as we got the gyoza, I noticed how unappetizing it looked, reminded me of buying it from the frozen section in the grocery store.  Our ramen was even worse, noodles were undercooked, pork was underseasoned and broth was not even close to Monta's.  We could not even eat it and had to send it back. Disappointment."}
{"text":"Good food. Fast service. Place looks nice and clean. Like the decorations. The chopsticks are nice."}
{"text":"Ordered takeout the other day because the girlfriend and I were sick, I got the teriyaki  ramen and she got char siu ramen. I must say we were fairly impressed. 

The soup was still hot when we arrived home which is a biggie on takeout so go Ichiddo for that, the flavor were on point and we both finished everything we ordered. 

-1 star for portion size,  compared to other ramen joints I've been to the portion felt a bit small. 

Otherwise a pretty good meal, especially if you're sick!"}
{"text":"Ever since Monta closed down on Eastern, the Henderson area has been barren ramen-wise. I was excited to see a ramen restaurant open up and had some high hopes. My food was decent, but it's not something to rave about.

They're located in the former restaurant, Noodle Pot. I was a little sad to see it go, but man, I do love ramen. It's a bittersweet feeling. Their interior decor is pretty spot on. It's modern, sleek, and inviting. The central table has a cool/interesting plant centerpiece, and their choice of decor/paint makes the restaurant feel very intimate.

My friend ordered the char siu ramen, and I was feeling zesty, so I got the kimchi ramen. The kimchi itself had a nice crunch accompanying that signature spice and slightly acidic flavor. The downside to my ramen was that the kimchi drowned out the flavor of the broth. The broth is really strong with that one.

The char siu ramen's broth was nice and nutty. I really liked that broth over my own and found myself sneakily stealing spoonfuls from my friend's bowl. The char siu itself was a little different from your usual pork.

Overall, the service and char siu ramen is good here. I probably wouldn't get the kimchi ramen the next time I go. The location is perfect for where I live, so I'll be returning to try different dishes in hopes that the other ramens change my mind."}
{"text":"My wife and I found this place while looking for some good  noodle joints.  She had some kimchi ramen and I had the beef stir fry and let me tell you it was amazing to say the least.  I also need to recommend the pork buns as well as an appetizer.  They are simply amazing and I could eat them all night.  The staff were super friendly and very accommodating.  You have to try them out, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"It's... decent. 

Stay away from the seafood ramen. The broth is great, but the previously frozen seafood tastes like previous frozen seafood.

The shredded char siu was serviceable. It was supposedly spicy, but it was definitely not. And the sriracha sauce that the server gave me to make it spicier, doesn't particularly cut it. But it was still tasty enough.

The noodles in both were slightly al dentier than I would like, but they were solid.

Overall, this is a good place to quiet a ramen craving, but it's not quite good enough to completely satisfy. 

However, location is everything. There isn't a great ramen place in the Henderson area. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"This Ramen House is hip with simple décor, the music is a bit loud. Service is great, friendly staffs! I ordered the Kimchi Ramen  soup base is ok, Noodle could be better.  4/5 Mediocre."}
{"text":"I was super skeptical about trying this place because I was so devoted to Monta Ramen. BUT I tried it and I'm loving the food. No disappointments."}
{"text":"Craving Ramen and this place was close by. Customer service was excellent, though a bit over zealous, few customers a lot of workers.  Ordered the Gyoza to start and a bowl of their Beef ramen. The Gyoza lacked flavor and could have been cooked a bit longer on one side. I like my Gyoza crispy. The Ramen looked great but really lacked flavor. The broth and the bits of beef which came in it were bland. Ramen is all about that broth and if you don't have good broth.. you can't have good ramen. Hopefully they work on their recipe, it is a new place after all. Prices are ok, and the place looks great.. but the food just wasn't great."}
{"text":"Everything was amazing! My family loved this cute new ramen spot. Vegetarian and vegan options! Awesome appetizers. We tried the age tofu, short ribs, and sweet potato fries and were not disappointed with any of our choices! The beef donburi was super tasty! Veggie ramen was on point and the char siu ramen was our favorite. Customer service was great as well. Everyone was so friendly!"}
{"text":"Surprisingly good!  My first time trying tonkatsu based, used to soy or miso based. I loved it. Nice atmosphere. Good service. We will be coming back."}
{"text":"The inside is really nice. I don't know about the food though. I love ramen and the broth here was pretty bad. I used to go to Monta Chaya and I miss it. I wish there ramen was half as good. Very beautiful inside though. The food can be better I hate writing negative reviews."}
{"text":"Pretty good restaurant, a little disappointed to go to a Japanese restaurant that did not have sake or beer though :(

Location:this restaurant is very hidden making it a little hard to find. 

Environment: The inside is clean and spacious, a pretty quiet atmosphere. I would say this is a nice restaurant to catch up with friends or maybe grab a meal alone or with family. 

Food: the pork belly bao was delicious and warm. The chicken karage was good, a little more fried than I'm used to and they give you sweet and sour to dip it in. I got the char siu ramen which had a delicious broth and yummy egg. I'm pretty picky, but I thought the noodle and pork slice was little more chewy than I would like. I believe they sear the pork on a stove that makes it have a tougher consistency. 

Overall, I would recommend this place as a homie styled restaurant that is easy to access and get seated. Again, I love my ramen with some Asahi beer haha but that is personal preference."}
{"text":"Best broth and great atmosphere! Also tried the pork and chick buns which were also good. Ver friendly service"}
{"text":"First time to this place with my friend today,I order the Char Shiu Ramen and my friend taked fried noodles,it was very delicious food and order up time is so fast!What are mazing place!We will come back again :)"}
{"text":"Just left this establishment. When we entered it was empty besides 1 table. We were greeted within 10 seconds by a woman who said \"for two?\" And then she sat us at a table by the window and walked away.
A young man came over and put utensils and plates on the table and walked away. 
The woman came back to ask about drinks. I got a water and my boyfriend got a can of Fanta. 
I looked around at the restaurant and it is pretty cute and clean. 
We ordered a fried chicken appetizer and edamame to start. Both came out quickly and piping hot. We enjoyed the appetizers the most.
He ordered the seafood Ramen bowl and I ordered the chicken stirfry Ramen. 
Those came out quickly too. 
The stirfry Ramen was basically like lo mein to me. The seafood bowl was different but decent. Came with 2 mussels, 2 shrimp, crab and bean sprouts and corn with the noodles. 
I Also ordered a green tea which came out very hot. 
The food was decent but the interactions with the employees were bare minimum.
I've worked in restaurants for so long...
You'd think a newly opened restaurant would be a lot more inviting to guests. 
But hey, maybe it's a culture difference. I just don't know. I am always sure to be super grateful because i know what it's like to serve. But they probably wouldn't have noticed a difference.
Probably won't be back honestly."}
{"text":"It's getting cold, the work day is done, and a hot bowl of steaming ramen is in order. Located in a packed strip mall, parking can be tricky as there are a lot of cars coming and going in a narrow entry and exit way. I was able to find parking pretty close to the restaurant, so that was good. When I walked in the place it was actually spacious with modern decor. It is very clean and welcoming. 
 
There is huge mural of a anime like character on the wall where the bar side seating was. A community table setting was in the middle while two and four seating tables lined up on the side walls of the restaurant. We were seated fairly quickly and began to order right away. For starters, we had the edamame, pork bao, and short ribs. The pork bao was ok. I really enjoyed the bun it came in as it was hot and fluffy. The pork itself was a bit on the sweet side, so I would say this bao is the sweet savory kind. The short ribs were a little dry, but for the price, I probably would not order again. The star of the show are the ramen noodles. The entrees were the Kim Chi Ramen with extra egg and extra corn and Shredded Char Siu Ramen. Both ramen had a good broth base and was not salty. The Kim Chi Ramen had a good slow spice burn as you're eating, then pow! The spice gets ya, your sinuses are cleared, but your taste buds are awakened. The corn adds a welcomed sweetness to the heat too. Will order the Kim Chi one again. The Shredded Char Siu was not as spicy, but was a full bodied broth, mild, and comforting. The noodles were firm and held up well to the hot broth. 

Day 2
Had to go back to try other menu items! Ordered the Char Siu ( not shredded ) ramen and the Teriyaki Chicken ramen as well. Also ordered extra eggs to be added on the side because they are the perfect half boiled delight addition to the soup (or honestly by itself). It has a slightly soft yolk and when served on the side it is a little chilled so the contrast in temperature and texture is a mouth feel bonus.The extra egg and extra corn will be an extra charge, but the eggs are so worth it for me. I think they are soft boiled in a seasoned broth and not just salt and water because they are so flavorful by itself. The Char Siu had good sized pork belly pieces in it and the soup base is just as good as the first time I had it. The Teriyaki Chicken ramen had more of a smokey broth base, but the chicken was moist and tender. The waiters checked up on us several times and I think one of them was the owner. Either way, everyone working there was super friendly and hard working. Tables were cleared promptly, but even after I finished my meal I never felt rushed to leave. Nice! Needless to say, I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"First visit here..came during the week-great time to come in.
Service was excellent..ramen was awesome !
Will definitely come back"}
{"text":"I ordered the crispy chicken ramen and it was great! The amount of chicken they give you is far more than any place I ever had. So full! We also order the chicken stir fry and chicken bun. Everything tasted great. The staff is also incredibly friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Holy shit this place blows.

My friend wanted to try this place because it was new and the reviews were decent. Service was so slow it was comical.

The server took our orders, but didn't write anything down. He came back and had to ask what my friend ordered because he couldn't remember. 

I ordered tan tan ramen and karaage. The server brought out calamari instead. I told him it was supposed to be karaage so he took it back.

Our ramens came out and he gave me a teriyaki ton ramen instead of the tan tan. At that point I was so over it that I just decided to eat it. 

The ramen was decent. It was slightly above average, but nothing worth coming back to.

My karaage finally came out when we were almost done eating. The chicken was not very flavorful and I was served with a sweet and sour sauce instead of kewpie. 

I would just recommend avoiding this place.

Edit: 2 stars instead of 1 because my server understood he made a mistake and gave me a 15% discount."}
{"text":"I had Ichiddo Ramen bookmarked for a while and I finally got around to trying it. 

We had a great experience. We were pleased with both the food and the service. 

To start we ordered the Age Tofu. The Age Tofu was thin slices of tofu which were lightly fried, making them crisp on the outside. They were topped with a sauce which reminded me of something close to Teriyaki. The Age Tofu was a perfect appetizer. We enjoyed the crisp outside and the sauce it was topped with. 

For dinner we both ordered the vegetable ramen. We got the vegetable broth as my partner and I are both vegetarians. Our ramen came out before we even finished the appetizer. What I noticed right away was how flavorful the broth was.  The toppings that were added, corn, bamboo shoots, red ginger, just to name a few, were all fresh and flavorful. We both were impressed with the flavor, especially because we ordered the vegetarian version. 

The service was quick and friendly. The server was super attentive, never letting our waters run empty, bringing us more napkins etc. 

Very happy that I tried this place. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"So this will be the second time trying this place and I'm not impressed. They are so unorganized it's not even funny. I ordered Yakitori and they didn't have any ingredients to make them yet it's on their online menu. Sigh.. 

So I get my Kimchi Ramen from Postmates and the Ramen was so bad. So first off the broth had a \"spoiled\" taste to it which could have been from using old or improperly stored Kimchi. (I always have Kimchi in my home and mine never tasted spoiled even when keeping for months) Also the \"Beef\" should have been called Fat with bits of boiled meat. It  was so gross. I had to pick out tons of tiny globules of just fat with no meat attached whatsoever and the the tiny parts that had meat were pale and flavorless. Needless to say my big pile of picked out fat with bits of meat and the spoiled taste made it hard to keep eating it so I only ate the noodles and threw the rest away.

I definitely will just head to China Town next time for good Ramen and I will not be visiting this place again nor recommending it. Even my son said among his friends they don't like this place because the ramen isn't that good. I have to agree."}
{"text":"I went here thinking it was still Noodle Pot 2.  We went inside and it was totally remodeled!  I was surprised it was a different restaurant!  Although no Noodle Pot 2, we still like ramen, so we decided to try it out.  

We ordered the Tsukemen (dipping ramen), and the Niku Soba Ramen.  Both were $12.95 and is priced higher than the majority of the ramen places in town.  

My bar for Tsukemen ramen is Tsujita LA Artisan Noodle, so in comparison to that, this was nothing of the sort.  The dipping broth was a very salty standard watery ramen broth, which is good since you're just dipping the noodles in it.  Although it was just okay.

The Niku Soba Ramen was good, although I was thrown off by the sweetness of the thin-sliced pork belly.  The sweetness permeated the broth and it wasn't really what I was looking for. 

Service was slow. There was only one other table eating with us when we were there and the servers were standing behind the bar talking to each other.  We were clearly done with our food, wallet on the table awaiting the check for nearly 10 minutes before I just raised my hand to get their attention.

Since Monta Chaya is gone (and I don't want to drive far), it looks like I'm going to Fukumimi from now on."}
{"text":"We came here in the hopes of finally having some decent ramen in this side of town since Monta closed its doors a while ago. Unfortunately, we were sorely disappointed. 

The décor was dark and unspectacular. We were seated right away and was brought iced water and menu. The menu was quite interesting because it has Chinese, Korean and Japanese dishes. (after listening to the staff speak in Chinese, I knew this was a Chinese owned operation.  It's of no significant importance but just an interesting observation.) 

We tried the Korean short ribs and teriyaki spicy noodle (I forgot what my companion ordered.). The short ribs were brought out within minutes.  Excellent! I was starving. One bite and I couldn't continue chewing. It was disgustingly salty. We couldn't eat it and had to let our server know. She took it to the kitchen and came back to ask us if we want to get something else. She recommended the calamari. 

In the meantime, our noodles came. My ramen was nothing to write home about. It was not spicy and the pork is not the cut you normally get at other ramen places. The pork was fine but it's like eating a hamburger with beef that's not grounded. 

The calamari arrived and it was coated heavily with the batter; the outside was way too crunchy. The calamari itself was mediocre, as was the sweet tangy sauce that came with it. 

The service was not bad. You can tell they are trying but they have only been opened for ten days! The grand opening should be amazing!  They should be hitting the ground running; not this lackluster performance. 

I hope they will significantly improve on the quality of everything or the landlord is going to have to find, yet another, tenant to fill this spot."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS! One of the best places I've been! I had the niku soba ramen, a small bowl of kimchi and gyoza! VERY VERY GOOD!"}
{"text":"Delicious! We enjoyed everything we ordered! Very friendly staff! Our kids even gave our server a hug when we left! We'll be going back...often!"}
{"text":"Tried the vegetable ramen & tofu bun and thought both were excellent. I'm not a ramen aficionado but thought the dish had fresh ingredients and was tasty. Decor is nice and service was very fast.  This gets top marks for me for a lunch place - good food, reasonably priced and served quickly."}
{"text":"I was in Japan in May and found out very fast that the hot spots after work were the Ramen restaurants. The locals would stand in line for a half hour to get good ramen.  My quest back home was to find a great ramen place and I would stand in line for this restaurant. My favorites are the Niku Soba Ramen, it has a flavorful onion broth and the Ton Ramen."}
{"text":"I was looking for a ramen place around Henderson after Monta closed down. This place used to be Noodle
Pot 2.

The food was ok. Broth not as flavorful as other ramen places but definitely cleaner and nicer with the renovations. Maybe I will try it out again later."}
{"text":"Got the veggie ramen. Ramen was alright. Portion is small. Miso flavor was meh. Not enough broth. Service is meh, but the language barrier could be the reason. Ambiance is nice with the paintings on the wall. Probably won't come back."}
{"text":"This ramen place is great. My husband and I love goyza and this place has some of the best goyza we have ever tasted. My husband loved their stir-fried ramen, and I thought it was a bit spicy.  My pork ramen noodle bowl was amazing I got the one with miso base.  Our only complaint would be not enough veges in our meal but next time we can order that."}
{"text":"Finally found a decent ramen place. I got the beef ramen, it had the right amount of spice, with the perfect amount of beef. I spent the summer in Japan and have been missing their ramen, and this place satisfied my craving. 

Also, this restaurant has interesting decor. A little quiet, but the ambience is still nice. 

Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Great simple menu and service. The atmosphere is pleasant and modern enough to feel like a special ramen place. I wish the ramens included some kind of side to make it feel more authentic. Of course you can order sides for reasonable price. The value and portion is ok. Flavor is good and not too bland or salty. The noodles are important and they were perfectly chewy. Good job."}
{"text":"First time visiting this establishment. Not impressed, placed an order of beef ramen it was so so nothing special somewhat bland. Ordered to go and when I got home I was missing my edamame. Called restaurant and girl who answers was very short And rude! Tried to explain my problem and she kept cutting me off, was finally able to explain and not once did she apologize but proceeded to tell me to go back and get it. I told her I was not driving all the way back for the edamame, I would stop by the next day and she said \"NO\"tonight. Let's just say I won't be back ever."}
{"text":"Delicious food and wonderful service! We had the Char Siu ramen and Niku Soba ramen. They had very different broths and I can't decide which one I liked more. I ereally liked how the pork was very thinly sliced in the Niku Soba dish- I had never had pork prepared this way before but this cut gave the meat a light and delicate flavor. We brought our toddler and they were very accommodating- the highchairs were stored in the back so they brought one out for us. The highchair was clean so that was appreciated!"}
{"text":"There is a void of good ramen places in the anthem area.  For soup cravings, you're better off getting pho.  Between two visits, not much has changed my mind about this place.  I really wanted to like this place because it fills the Monta void; however; it is really not up there with my favorite Ramen places in town.  
For starters, the pork belly bun was tasty, but nothing will ever compare to Ippudo NYC.  
I ordered the char siu ramen and I was very disappointed.  The way they cooked the pork was different than what I am used to. The meat layer was not tender and the fat layer chewy.  Other places in town have tender pork that kind of melts in your mouth.
I tried the crispy chicken ramen. It was an extra crispy chicken katsu that topped my ramen.  I appreciate the extra crispiness because it held up well in the broth.  
The beef bowl was actually really good, despite it's anemic appearance.  It didn't look like the photo in the menu and was missing some toppings or garnishings.  
Service is polite, but forgetful.  This area needs improvement.  We did not get any waters until mid meal and one of of side dishes was forgotten.
I may be back to try their donburi bowls or stir fry ramen."}
{"text":"Finally decided to try this place out and I'm so glad. Most of the time ramen places always have a huge line, but not this place. Or was it because I came at like 5pm... well whatever the case, I'm glad it wasn't busy! 

Parking was annoying. For some reason the block where the ramen spot is was only 30 min parking all around. Annoying. But you can prob park there and no one will care. There is a big lot behind it too if you are worried. 

Service was extremely attentive and very accommodating since I have two toddlers. They tried their best to keep my lil ones happy so we can have a peaceful meal with no tantrums. They brought the kids balloon animals near the end of the meal. Can we say A+ for family friendly!!

Food: we didn't get too much variety. Sweet potato fries, nothing special, to start since then little ones need something quick. 

We ended up getting the beef ramen and teriyaki-ton ramen. Surprisingly the broth was very rich and flavorful. A lil on the salty side, but not bad. Just the right amount of softness to the ramen noodles as well. Definitely enjoyed it. 

I'm looking forward to coming back to try other flavors. My kids loved the ramen noodles and broth as well. They usually don't eat much for dinner, but loved that they ate a lot here. I just wish they had lil toppings in the kids ramen"}
{"text":"This place was simply spectacular!  I'm plant based and was happy they had a vegetarian option.  I ordered the tofu bun, (wow!  Divine!) and vegetarian ramen with kimchi spicy base, (life!).  

I'm visiting from San Diego and this place is a gem!  Too wonderful.  My fav go to place was Monta, and this is just what the dr ordered. Woot!"}
{"text":"Probably the best ramen I've had thus far. I definitely love the broth. Typically most ramen places for me are super salty. This place was favorable and not that salty. Considering I had the seafood ramen bowl.   It didn't even have that fishy taste either. Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Pretty cool new ramen spot with a bunch of good appetizer options as well. They also do some rice dishes called donburi. Service was pretty good, no complaints. Pork bun was simple and delicious, well executed- definitely a reo-order. Chicken kara-age had good flavor, decent texture. Good but maybe not a reorder. For mains, the donburi with hand sliced pork was great- definitely recommend. Ramen dish was good with pork, broth had decent flavor. Overall pretty solid place. 4.5/5"}
{"text":"Not a fan. I had the Char Siu Ramen, was ok, comes with bamboo shoot which has a very distinct taste."}
{"text":"Loved it. Delicious ramen. Super happy I came in will definitely be coming back often... convenient location and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Really good food. The interior is beautfiul. The prices are a little bit high compared to other ramen restaurants. The donburis are super good though!"}
{"text":"Not quite Monta Ramen.  It felt a bit more fusion which was s probably ok for the location.  The broths were too spicy food my kids and didn't have anything memorable that would keep me coming back.  Its the only ramen now in the area, so it will have to do for now."}
{"text":"There's finally a new ramen place in Henderson! It doesn't quite compare to the other ramen places I've been to, but it's one of the closer ones. It's also one of the larger ramen places in town. 

I've been here three times and still can find a bowl I really like. I've tried the seafood ramen which is yummy because of the different kinds of seafood in the dish, but the broth isn't quite how I like it. I've also tried the beef ramen which is yummy because of the spiciness and beef. But still not loving the broth. I'm also a bit disappointed with the size of the little fish cake. It's only a little bit bigger than a quarter but it's so cute! Lol. 

The char siu pork bun is a delicious appetizer! The bun is so fluffy and the pork is flavorful!

Like I said, this place is good for the location and the ramen isn't bad. But it's not the best ramen I've had."}
{"text":"Not bad for such a small establishment, staff are nice and fast with the orders. Not much of a selection, but well worth eating here. Love the seafood noodles and their jalapeno poppers."}
{"text":"Probably some of the best ramen this side of Henderson. Happy we finally have a few places that compete with Chinatown."}
{"text":"Wife and I stopped by on a Wednesday evening. We were looking for the Noodle Pot which has been replaced by a new ramen place. We were seated right away. There was no wait or line. Ordered the crab jalapeño appetizer which was very good. We ordered different ramen, pork belly for me, crispy chicken for her. Both were excellent. Broth was outstanding and the portion size was perfect. We will definitely return. 

Second trip just as good as the first. I would not recommend the short rib appetizer, was a little tough."}
{"text":"Mediocre at best kind of felt like I could have made it myself. Dark and empty spot not really a good food atmosphere. Im sure they mean well but it just wasn't worth the trip or money. Won't be returning."}
{"text":"It was ok but not as good as Monta Chaya. The lady server was not welcoming today during 1:30pm time. 

Will be looking for other ramen spots since Monta Chaya Henderson closed."}
{"text":"My daughter and I decided to try this place as we had been craving ramen.  She is a vegetarian and many ramen places don't offer a vegetarian broth.  The service was quick and the food came out fairly quickly.  She enjoyed her vegetable ramen and sweet potato waffle fries and I liked my gyoza and Char Sui Ramen.  My ramen broth could have been a little more flavorful, but overall it was a satisfying meal and had good options for my daughter."}
{"text":"So yummy!!!  Definite go to for char siu Ramen and what an awesome location!!!  Looks like I'll be coming back here quite often :-) for my Ramen cravings."}
{"text":"Food: Char siu ramen. My bar for ramen is pretty high (Santouka Ramen in San Jose, CA) and the closest I've come so far since moving here is Fukumimi. The broth was decent and at least the noodle was al dente, however the meat really threw me off. It was weird and thick and overcooked and I did not like it at all. Not authentic.

Ambiance: very nicely remodeled from the old Taiwan noodle place. I like the dark colors and japanese anime on the wall.

Service: Efficient and our food came out quickly enough since I was starving that day!

Location: Behind Tide Cleaners on Eastern.

I will continue to make the trek to Fukumimi, but in a pinch I would go here since it's so close to me if I needed ramen. That pork is gross though so I'd get something else or leave out the meat. Or give it to my husband. ;-)"}
{"text":"I like this ramen place for it's convenience, ambiance, and of course, ramen! It's a medium sized restaurant with adequate space and tall ceilings; a big table in the center can seat groups. You're immediately seated by friendly staff and the place is always clean & spacious. I usually get the niku soba ramen because it's creamy and savory over their char siu ramen."}
{"text":"We went on lunch Saturday, it was empty, just 2 tables including us and the food came out quite slow so the first impression is not so good. Then I ordered fried chicken (karage) And no it's not chicken karage, the crunch is not there, flavor is really lite the only decent thing about it is the meat is not dry. 

For ramen, chashu is decent, I like the touch of smoked burnt that comes with it, they torched it before serve seem like. The meat can be a bit more tender I think. The broth is ok nothing special, not really full body taste for a pork broth. The noodle can be fresher but it's packaged noodle if I'm not wrong. 

It's just not a ramen place I would go back to."}
{"text":"Thank you for the most beautiful and tasty delivery I've had in 20 years in Vegas!  And thank you for understanding my food restrictions. Love the saffron touch."}
{"text":"So my hubs and I decided to try this place after searching for 'Asian fusion' and we were blown away.  Not only by the food and atmosphere, but by the amazing customer service!  They were very attentive and were constantly checking on us, it was impressive.  We each had a pork bun as an appetizer (which I would eat a bunch as a meal, they were amazing!) and the sauce and pork were to die for.  I think they grilled or charred it or something, as there was a nice smoky flavor to the pork. Then I got the kimchi ramen and my hubs got the beef stir fry ramen.  These were both delicious, as well.  The broth in mine was delicious and has the usual ramen broth as an undertone, as well as the kimchi flavor.  The beef was cooked perfectly.  We were very happy with this place and will be back again!"}
{"text":"Not sure why this place is rated so low. I'm not a ramen expert by any means but I've eaten at many places in Vegas and this one is at the top. I ordered the fried chicken ramen which is something I've never heard of before, but it was delicious and had lots of flavor! Usually I need to add extra spicy paste to my ramen due to lack of flavor, but the broth was seasoned beautifully and it was an excellent bowl of ramen. The service was quick and friendly and made for a nice, casual Friday date night. I would return."}
{"text":"First time coming here , def recommend.  Ordered the fried rice w/ shrimp to go, it was delicious. Price was a little on the high side for what I got, but it was worth it.  Waiter was very nice , gave me a free glass of water while I waited for my food.  It was a nice, quiet environment.  Might try the ramen next time."}
{"text":"This remarkable neighborhood restaurant is located in a sort of hard to find spot near Carrabba's on Eastern Avenue. It's beautifully decorated, extremely clean, the service is on the spot and the prices are fair.  My husband and I ordered an appetizer of gyoza which was accompanied by a delicious sauce. We each ordered a different bowl of ramen.. teriyaki tan ramen for me and beef ramen for  my hubby.  The broth was flavorful and rich and loaded with goodies. If you wish to add different items to your Ramen they are available at a reasonable cost.  The portions were more than ample. . The waitress mention that those particular dishes are spicy which was okay by us.

We will definitely be returning to this restaurant."}
{"text":"I was craving some ramen so i decided to use yelp for a close spot near my house in silverado ranch area. This one popped up and has decent reviews so i decided to try this place out. 
Upon entering the waitress at the front was very sweet, polite and friendly! She sat me at a table and came back shortly after. I ordered a hot tea... and unfortunately it was tea with a tea bag.. it tasted ok but would prefer a matcha type tea you get at traditional japanese restaurants or a more flavorful tea. It was light and tasted ok.. something i can make at home. 
So for starters i ordered the japanese style short ribs around $6... presentation wise it looked tasty.. but upon eating it.. it lacked flavor!! I guess Im used to the korean style short ribs that has a stronger flavor. I don't think I would ever order this dish again.  I also ordered the pork bun around $3 each. The bun was soft and tasty but I'm sure its a pre made one anyone can buy. They have a THINLY sliced char siu pork in the middle with a shred of lettuce with it. Again i was disappointed cause the pork was dry ...and i guess i was expecting a more moist pork belly type of meat in the middle.. I've never had a pork bun with such a small amount of meat. I would PASS on this one as well... 
Okay so the char siu ramen ($12) came out and it looks very pleasing.. it was hot enough.. and the egg was yummy! the pork meat was super thin and DRY as the desert...the broth was tasty enough and noodles were chewy enough.  Ive had many many bowls of ramen in my lifetime and this one because of the meat I won't order again. I prefer my meat a thicker cut, moist and tender! 
Overall I don't think I would come back...I think I rather take the longer drive into china town and order a bowl of ramen that will blow me away! Yes this place is much closer to my house.... but I was not impressed with this place. I honestly really really wanted to like this place cause its so close to me... but Im not a fan."}
{"text":"After reading mixed reviews, I decided to check this place out. The ramen is probably a solid 4 stars, but the service was absolutely just meh. 

Our waiter helped 2-3 customers before us, which unfortunately, left a salty impression on this establishment. 

I ordered the char siu ramen and while the flavor was tasty, the soup was a tad bit too oily. The meat was was flames with flavor, which was awesome. The egg was perfectly cooked too.

This place is a solid ramen shop if you're in the market for a hot soup. I'd probably still drive to Monta. But yes, the decor was awesome and the place was extremely clean. It was pretty empty when we went, so at least there won't be a long line at this restaurant ;)"}
