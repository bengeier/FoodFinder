{"text":"This is my go-to place to eat whenever I'm at the mall.  Food is fresh, fast, and made to order.  Their prices are so cheap it's a wonder how they make any money at all...all of their combos include a small fountain pop.  My only complaint is that service isn't the greatest (see: really quite rude).  Despite the bad service, I have been going to Select Grill for years and years because the food is just that good.  I hate to say it but be prepared to take some verbal lashings if you want good food from an unexpected place!"}
{"text":"For over a decade now select grill has always been there when I'm looking for a quick meal fix. They have always been loyal with their pretty generous portions. Unfortunately there are no vegetarian option at all as their cook top and grill are always covered with large amount of meat. This place is usually quite busy during meal times on the weekend, so expect to line up. They cook your meal in front of you so it does take some time. You can also call ahead to place a takeout order. 

Keep in mind this is a food court so their customer service amount to how most fast food restaurants are run. I've never had any problems with my orders. They will give you extra sauce if you ask! Get your order to go because I feel they give more food in the take out box :)"}
{"text":"So, this isn't a five star dining experience (what food court experience is?), but I'm still giving it five stars because of the fact that it's probably one of the best food court meals I've ever had.  I didn't find the lady at the counter rude as others have, I just think she isn't the most comfortable speaking English (clearly not her first language) and she comes from an old school Chinese restaurant server mentality of \"food and efficiency come before service (if service counts at all)\".  I might care more if it were a sit-down restaurant, or if she were egregiously rude, she was to-the-point, but not rude.

Anyhoo, the food was great!  The lamb and beef were grilled and seasoned perfectly, and were of a quality that allowed me to slice it with a woefully inadequate plastic knife.  Fries were pretty good, as was the basic salad.

Listen, for a food court option, this was pretty darn good."}
{"text":"I've been going to eat at select grill for years. I love the food, cleanliness and quick service.  
Never again.  

Since Yen and her sister have left (the two older ladies that run the place) it's gone totally down the tubes.  

I was there yesterday and there were to younger asian gentlemen and a newer Indian Woman.  One of the guys took my order which was standard. Then the second went ahead to make the meal.

First: The grill is usually spotless. Now it's black and caked with grease.
Second: The meat must have been sitting there for a while. They have bowl under the grill where they are reusing old meat constantly so it's either super dry or really burnt. 
Third: They usually have very fresh fries but they are now re-frying the old fries that are sitting there so by the time it cools down to eat is super hard and gross.

Yesterday when I asked the guy to give me fresh fries, he was so annoyed and didn't want to. After asking again he finally went ahead and put a new batch in.
Halfway through making my meal he left and the woman came by to put it all together. When she started to put the old fries into my container I told her no and the first gentleman yelled at me that it was fresh which it wasn't. I told him that he should not speak to customers like that. 

I've worked in the mall for 10 years and have never had a problem with select Grill. I send all our clients over there as the food is always good and fresh. But since these new staff have come in, the food, service and cleanliness of the place is disgusting. They don't care about the company the way that Yen and her sister do.

I'm truly disappointed and would like my money back if I could get it. But I know that is not the case."}
{"text":"Excellent food court restaurant and I wish there were more locations. The food is fresh and the options are awesome. Always order the short ribs with salmon and shrimp and it is the best Ive had. For a food court resturant I am impressed and will go there as much as I can."}
{"text":"Anytime I'm at Dixie Mall I have gotta get me some of that Select Grill!

Found tucked away in the food court this family owned business is the hit of Dixie Mall. There is always line ups and for good reason the food is hella good.

What makes the food good is that the food is prepared fresh and made to order. The meats, chicken, beef, steak, and shrimp, is very well marinated and tender. Along side the meat you get three sauces to compliment them, teriyaki, tzatziki, or bbq. With the meat you get two choices of salad, pasta salad, fries, noodles, or rice. All the goods for under $10.

I believe this is a family owned business, with one twin taking orders, while the other one gets your food ready. There is also a brother (I think it's their brother at least) who is the grill master. Great people and great food, you can't go wrong.

Only downfall of this place is that drinks do not come with the combos so you're looking at an extra $2 to your meal, or just head to the dollar store before you head to this place and you should be good.

Items to definitely get

- grilled chicken with tzatziki sauce on the side 
- grilled pork with bbq sauce on the meat
- fries"}
{"text":"This is one of the places I will never go back to because of the service. Which is a shame because the meat is quite good. But the old lady that works here 90% of the time is SO incredibly rude, and SO incredibly slow it's unbelievable...considering she might actually be the owner. She will actually REFUSE you the special of the day even though the sign is posted RIGHT up and tell you it's actually the \"cheaper\" option (I'm assuming to save money and scam her customers). My girlfriend still goes here every time despite of the service, and this old hag is literally like this EVERY TIME."}
{"text":"Located in the middle of the Dixie mall food court, Select grill has been around for YEARS. There is an older, grouchy,  Asian women that is either cooking or cashing you out. Don't be afraid she adds to the charm of the place. I don't think the food is the healthiest choice but is sure taste good and they give large portions. You can choose from various proteins chicken, steak, shrimp, etc. paired with either rice or fried and a side salad. They have various sauces to choose from to customize you meal to your liking. I honestly don't know if the food is that good or its that nostalgic feeling of eating here on my lunch break during simpler days but I like it and I hope you will too!"}
