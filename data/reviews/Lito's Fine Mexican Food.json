{"text":"Total hole in the wall. Absolutely fantastic burros. We had red chili.  Excellent service. Wish they had one on the East side of town."}
{"text":"Excellent fare, friendly service appropriate pricing. Don't be  fooled by the hole - in -the- wall 
ambiance. All the charm and authenticity   of  an abuela's kitchen. Plan to return ...with family and friends."}
{"text":"I asked what they recommended and was given a plain burrito filled with chunks of pork and a runny green chili sauce. I was very disappointed because of all the great reviews. I'm sure they must have something better, but I'd think they'd recommend something better tasting and better presented than a burrito with an uncooked tortilla, nothing on top of it, and a filling that seemed to be made from canned food."}
{"text":"I have been coming to Lito's consistently for years they always provide wonderful service and amazing food love the beans!"}
{"text":"This is the ultimate hole in the wall. If you can find it then you are in for a treat. The green chili burro is unreal. The tacos are legit! Also, make it a point to check out the specials board before you order, they always have some great deals on there. For whatever reason it is easy to miss.  Skip all the -tos restaurants and get here. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Litos was at one time named Ritos two it was opened by the son of the original Ritos hole in the wall on Garfield. He ran it for about a year or so and sold it along with the recipes but not the name. The second owner named it Tito's and kept the recipes but expanded the menu. I know this because I have been going to Ritos since 1981 and as regulars know at Ritos nothing is guaranteed. No more enchilada style was one trend, then it came back and they eliminated enchiladas. Now you can't get a taco except for when they are in the mood to make them. I became very frustrated and one of the sisters told me about Ritos Two so I started making the drive. By coincidence the second owner that named it Titos was my next door neighbor in Scottsdale. He sold it and it became Litos and they sold it again and kept the name Litos.

The Red Chile/enchilada sauce is the same as Ritos, the Tacos are very very close to the same. The green chile is an acceptable substitute as are the refried beans. The menu is 10 times the size of Ritos and all the items are available when you order them, not just on a whim or the mood of the kitchen staff like at Ritos.

Given a choice of going to Ritos or Litos I would pick Litos because I know I can order and receive what I want. Ritos is too unreliable. If I was in the hood I make take a chance on Ritos making me what I want but if I am traveling for food it will always be Litos."}
{"text":"Every time i eat here i ask my self why. prices are high and the food is very average..Soggy food that is never packed rite and poor customer service. Its a whole in the wall that is hardly open . Dine in prices for Filberto type take out ..This place is closed on Monday and  closes at 7 witch is weird."}
{"text":"Best Green Chili Burrito's in the state or maybe the USA. Esther and Ana are fantastic. Love this place, have been going here for years. I would give the Green Chili Burrito's 10 stars if that was an option."}
{"text":"Overall, we had a good experience. The food prices were average for the type of restaurant, as was the decor and service. The food seemed closer to Tex-mex, rather than Mexican. It was an average, good experience but not much to rave about."}
{"text":"I am very picky with my Mexican. I have to say that this is the best green chili bean and beef burrito I have ever eaten. The attention to detail and how they prepare than meat...  there's no fat or sinew in the meat. The seasoning of the meat and the beans are great and compliment the green chili sauce. The green chili sauce is simply the best green chili sauce I have ever eaten. Don't let the fact that it's a hole in the wall scare you away."}
{"text":"I've driven by more times than I can count and never realized it was there. They suggested I try the red and green chili as it was my first time. I looooved the green chili, it has a bit of kick to it but it's worth the heat! I ordered a green chili chimichanga and it was amazing! Very tasty, not greasy at all, and filling. The service was great, the lady taking the order was very polite and helpful. Very friendly atmosphere. A few regulars came in after I ordered and they were all greeted with a smile and friendly welcome. I'll definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"Great green and red burritos.
4 stars because it's hours are hard to work within. They close at 7 during the week which is hard when I get off work at 6 & Closed Sundays & Mondays,
the days I most often eat out."}
{"text":"This is hands down the best green chili burro and tacos you can find. The flavor is absolutely unbeatable, the green chili burro is like nothing you have ever tasted before, it is a tastebuds dream, so much in just one bite. The tacos, both chicken and beef are just amazing, the crispy shell and the flavor of the meat is just heavenly. 
 Lito's is a must try, once will never be enough. The down side is it has limited seating about 6-10 people , so might be best to order and take it to go"}
{"text":"So I was craving Mexican food really bad and from where I live, there aren't many choices. So I go on my handy dandy yelp and come across this place. All of the 17 reviews were 5 stars. I read a few reviews, looked at the pictures, and I was SOLD!  When I went inside, I was greeted with a smile by Esther. I let her know it was my first time here and she informed me that the red chili and the green chili were their best dishes. She brought me a sample of both. The green is a little too spicy for me (because I'm a big baby) but I decided on the red. Overall, the food was delicious. The ONLY two things I would change are the thickness of the beans (they're a little too runny for me) and the chips. They were too thick and a little overcooked. Besides that, amazing service and amazing food. I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"The green chili is bomb. It's very flavorful and packs some heat. They have the good shredded beef tacos... you know, the ones that are not soggy on the bottom and fall apart. They are crispy and delicious. They are friendly.  I definitely recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"Favorite place to come for green Chile burritos. I also love their rice and beans. Owner is very nice and never had a bad experience. I usually come here once a week."}
{"text":"Ordered the beef w green chile burrito w beans n cheese. The green chile is delicious and beef was tender. The only down side was that the burrito was a bit smaller than I expected for what I paid. 
It was my 1st time here today.  It's a small restaurant not fancy but the lady that was taking orders for sweet and pleasant and happy to recommend different dishes for me."}
{"text":"I won't go into too much detail. Long story short... Food did not agree with me. I will not be back."}
{"text":"Litos is not bad.  Definitely not the best green chile burritos you will ever have.  For the bombest green chile burritos everyone who is in the know goes to Ritos down on Garfield in the hood.  However, in a pinch Litos will do just fine.  Someone told me they were relatives of the owners of Ritos and paid to use their recipes.  I don't know whether this is true or not so take it with a grain of salt.  Either way, their green chile burritos are a little pricey but definitely not lacking on flavor and better than average."}
{"text":"Though it may seem like a hole in the wall. I started coming to Litos when Ritos (Glendale) was not being consistent with the hours they had of operation. My family and I often get Green Chil Burritos which are flavored with enough spices. The meat is cut in just the right size so you taste it but so some little kid won't choke on it. I often come in now after getting or waiting for a haircut from the barber next door."}
{"text":"One of Phoenix Greatest Secrets. The food here is Awesome. A bit pricey but worth it."}
{"text":"I saw this place in the corner of my eye when I went into the smoke shop nearby and I decided I wanted to give them a try since I'm always looking for good Mexican food. At first I was a little hesitant because I wasn't sure what to expect. I  am glad that I decided to walk in and try them! If you want home style Mexican food then you have to come here! This place reminds me of where I grew up (Globe, AZ). 

I went ahead and got me a simple red chili burro and I loved it! 

The place is clean, but it is small. 

I cannot wait to go back and try some more food!"}
{"text":"I have tried a number of things now.  I think my favorite is the Green chille burrito.  This is family owned and operated.  The staff speak English and take customer service with pride. This a great whole in the wall."}
{"text":"I've been coming here since I was 16 and it had a different name and owner. The food is not amazing it's unbelievable. You really do get the family vibe here. The food is authentic and the owner and her family are authentic. The owner is a wonderful person and very welcoming. 
My favorite is the green chimichanga. Hmmmmmm. If you can't handle spice don't get it but if you don't get it you're missing out. Everything is good and will beat out any of those large restaurants by far."}
{"text":"As others have suggested, the green chili is fantastic.  It really is the best.  

Their beans are very good too.  Not too salty like other places.  

I wasn't overly impressed with their tacos though.  It wasn't bad, just that I've had better.  When I go back (and I will be back!) I'll pass on the tacos, but that just leaves more room for green chili burros."}
{"text":"So far, so good. I was told by a friend to get a green chili burrito from Lito's months ago and finally found myself there for lunch. I was not disappointed and am anxious to try something else. Sorry Federico's."}
{"text":"It was my first time finding this place...& they were so nice offering me to try their signature red and green chili - the green chili was amazing and everything else was great I definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"This is by far one of my favorite places to eat! Their food is so good, it's authentic Mexican food, they honestly have the best green and red chili burritos. I recommend my favorite which is the green mix burrito with beans and enchilada style. Best food along with really great costumer service, big hole in the wall!!!!!"}
{"text":"My kids and I tried this place not too long ago.  I read about how its like Ritos but better.  I don't personally find that comment true.  I thought it was not nearly as good as Ritos myself.  If you are looking for this style of Mexican food I would obviously recommend Ritos and I would go to the location at 14st.  The green chili here was not as flavorful and the beans also lacked the flavor I am looking for."}
{"text":"Soooooo good. Best red and green chili ive had. Awesome service as well. When she found out it was our first time there she gave us samples to make sure we liked it. Will definitely go back. Doesn't look like much from the outside but you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"The hole-in-the-wall restaurants that I frequent would think this place is small and dirty. That being said, their enchilada sauce has a nuttiness that takes work. And it must have been a labor of love cause the green burro enchilada style is definitely made with love. 

They aren't set up for a lot of people so if your party is more than 4 people, you don't like weird smells, or don't enjoy Mexican television then plan on taking it to go."}
{"text":"Omgoodnes! I have been a LOYAL customers of Litos for at last 4 yrs now.that is....until now. Being in the service industry myself....I have a serious lack of patience for those who lack not only customer service skills but also....just a decent sense of ethics. Here's a brief synopsis of how my experience today went:
Litos lady: litos! How can I help u?
Me: id like t place n order to go plz. Bean n cheese burrito
LL: ok bean n cheese burro....that will be about 10 min.
Me: thx
I drive my happy butt to 47th n olive.....super excited for my BEAN N CHEESE BURRITO.
LONG STORY short.....wen asked to pay $7.83 I was taken abak n confirmed my order. She says yes its a b n c burro.
Imagine my disappointment to get to wrk n realize...not only is this NOT a B n C burro..but in fact' this colorful array of..well....mulch. when I called to ask if I could return it for what I ordered...the wman INSISTED that the \"mushy tortilla thing\" was wht I ordered. Instead of arguing w the lady....what's the point rite? I simply asked if I may be remibursed' her response....that's what u ordered so NO..
I will NEVER return to Litos. U want AMAZING mexican food? Check out RITOS ON 51ST N GLENDALE OR THE ONE ON GARFIELD."}
{"text":"Filthy place, small portions and crappy food. I have no idea why the ratings are so high on this dump.
Just look at the filth on the leading edge of the front door says it all."}
{"text":"Im in love with this restaurant! It's one of the only places I know of that have authentic Mexican food! I recommend the Green Chimichanga Enchilada style! It's my favorite ! If you want good food, then this is your place !! You're welcome!"}
{"text":"Great food, great price, really nice people. The neighborhood lucky to have  them. Stop in for the best beans ever and try the green chili beef burrito, so yummy!"}
{"text":"Hands down to this place! I ended up by coincidence just yelping a place to eat for lunch in my way to a meeting in Phoenix. 5 stars sounded good and 5 stars it was. I had the RED super burro for I was told by the server the green salsa is their spicier one. Unfortunately I have to avoid too spicy food. Wow, what a delicious choice. Flavor, size, and look was amazing. Highly recommended. Lucky those who live around this little Mexican restaurant. Beware it is the ultimate hole in the wall, don't let it fool you!"}
{"text":"Sooo good exceeded my expectation! Very good flavored sauces! Green chili burrito with red sauce.  The beans are also delicious!"}
{"text":"Consistent hours, not like Rito's right down the road.  More meat in their green chile burritos than Rito's."}
{"text":"Tucked into a little corner of a strip mall on 47th and Olive/Dunlap you will find this little gem with the most amazing red and green Chile burritos. If you haven't been here you're missing out!!!

The staff is very friendly.  My first time here i had a hard time deciding what to eat so the ladies behind the counter offered me a sample of both the red and the green Chile.  She explained that everything was homemade and the ingredients they use.  

Not only is this place amazing for its food and staff but  for their prices as well. Don't go in expecting too much.  The facility is small with two tables.  I've eaten in there twice and most of the sales seem to be to-go orders.  One more thing to keep in mind.  They are closed Sunday and Monday.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"So even though I live right down the street from this place I haven't been here in about 1 year. But I've been on this Mexican food kick these last few days so I decided to visit the neighborhood restaurant. The cashier I'm not sure if it's the owner or not was very blunt and kind of impatient because I didn't know what I wanted to order. I usually get their green or red chile burrito which is bomb but I got there super nachos which they don't give you much for a $7-8 plate. But I will definitely be back they have very good food."}
{"text":"This place is THE BEST mom and pop place for Mexican food! The food is great and so is the family that operate the place. Their green chili is hands-down the best! I used to eat here a lot when I lived in Phoenix, but now I always stop in and stockpile food when I'm in town. They are open Tuesday through Saturday."}
{"text":"I was really craving their awesome Mexican food today as it's cold and rainy.  They are so good I have no problem going far to eat there or take it to go.  I usually get the monster burro. Everything is great tho.   Please be on Door Dash and be open on Mondays too!!"}
{"text":"I have to say this is my second trip and per my bride. Why have we never knew this place here. Surprisingly thirr Green Sauce delivered oh so good burn, chip's are one of my favorites possibly due to the light salt and fresh made daily tortillas. Tonight they ran out of Pollo for tacos ao the boy had beef (devoured as usual).

May need to join a gym 

Later"}
{"text":"Stopped in during a visit to Phoenix based on Yelp reviews.  Green Chili Burro special was fantastic.  Super friendly and great atmosphere.  Not much seating but great for 1 to 4 for a lunch outing or takeout."}
{"text":"Best green and red chili I have eaten this side of the border. For anyone who wants true authentic Mexican Food check it out."}
