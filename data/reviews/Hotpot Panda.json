{"text":"We are very happy to eat here. it is a great place for us to eat, and it is a traditional Chinese hot pot, perfect!!!"}
{"text":"Yummy! Went there twice in 2 days. I would love to go back. Great service and delicious food.:-)"}
{"text":"Not that good. Their meat slices are too thin! It melts in the mouth! Doesn't even taste like meat. Not many food choices. I only liked the decoration of the place."}
{"text":"The service is very good and the stuffs are very nice.The  soup base is decent and have a lot of options, lamp and beef are fresh and good. The spicy one is my favourite it tastes amazing"}
{"text":"First time going to a hot pot restaurant and the staff was unbelievably friendly and eager and happy to help and answer first timer questions, and of course the food and soups we got recommended were amazing.  After a long day this place will warm your belly and heart"}
{"text":"Nice to find a new place (especially a hot pot restaurant in downtown) to eat after a disastrous final exam (uhhh). It's been only 2 weeks since they opened, according to the staff there. The space is quite big - two floors with 30-40 seats on each floor. They also have large tables that can seat as many as 6-8 people.  There are more than six different flavors of fondue soup to choose from, and I chose to have a Yin-Yang pot with royal spicy soup and mushroom soup. The spicy soup is not that spicy, and I don't eat spicy food (Tabasco sauce will burn me to death lol).   One point that will make me to dine here next time is that meat or vegetables taste so fresh, and you can order as much meat as you want for free!!! Since it's included in the combo (wonderland for meat eaterrrrrrs!).   Will come back with my friends! Also hope to try their new dishes of spicy stew next time!  (Pictures are taken by my friend Julie and many thanks to her :))"}
{"text":"We ordered the tripod with the original spicy, tomato soup, and tom yum base. The spicy and tomato based was supe4 delicious. However, the Tom yum was too sour to our taste. There is also not a lot of selections for the hot pot. Only about 2 or 3 types of noodles and several hot pot fish balls. Overall, the food was good and service was excellent."}
{"text":"They have several broth to choose from, but my fave will always be the mushroom and the spicy one. It's an all you can eat so you get a variety of meat and veggies to choose from as well as drinks and side dishes. You also don't smell too much like hot pot afterwards.   However, I find it a bit pricey since you have to pay an extra 3.5-4.5$ for the broth. Also, i went there 3 times and there were never any bears :(   Overwall, it's a pretty good place for hot pot."}
{"text":"You get to choose 3 options of soup and then boil fresh ingredients and seafood on the soup. It's an all you can eat place for $21. I liked the tomyum soup and the spicy soup but not the classic (#1 ) because it had too much ginger for my taste. It was a very different experience for me and my friends who've never had hotpot before."}
{"text":"When you foolishly make the long trek up North in the middle of below freezing winter, you must warm the body and soul with some hot pot! Such a cute place with some risqué artworks on the wall. Love the atmosphere and decor! The service was absolutely phenomenal as well. The staff are so friendly and efficient. Even though there was a wait, they kept us well hydrated and updated us on the wait frequently.   I like the trio soup style...keeps the tastebuds interested. We chose the tom yum, spicy and mushroom soups. All three were delicious. My favorite has to be the tom yum. The soups were so well seasoned that you don't even need sauces on the side. The beef slices were abundant and fresh. Probably one of the best hot pot places I've had in my lifetime so far. Decent selections of meat, seafood and veggies at a very reasonable price.   Dear Hotpot Panda, you've got yourself a huge fan! I would love to come back and highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Waited 35 mins for a table even though there were open tables available - service was slow and had to ask for things that are typically preset at the table, like chopsticks, spoons, bowls, plates, napkins. Very unusual especially since it's a restaurant handling raw food... hello, cross contamination?   The selection at the buffet was basic. The add ons like the beef and spareribs served separately carried a funky smell, maybe it was the marinade or the wood cups they are kept in. The broth was good, got the spicy and tom yum, neither were too spicy. $75 for a 2 person dinner. Cleanliness was questionable and the food was not worth returning for, imo."}
{"text":"One of the best Chinese Style Hotpot. I really missed the panda style frozen jelly soup in the Hotpot."}
{"text":"°The low-down: New, fun little hot pot place. °What does that mean?: They're a buffet, and offer both a traditional and non-traditional hotpot flavours for you to bathe your selected produce/meats in. °What do they have?: Fish balls, beef balls, sausage, luncheon meat, shrimp, frog legs, mussels, bok choy, mushrooms, tofu, etc. °Extras: Meats (not the ones mentioned but fresh pork and beef) will cost you $ on top of the base buffet price. °Booze?: Nope, sorry. °Service: Very kind and attentive, our waitress was still learning English but she did a marvelous job considering. °What stock to chose?: #1, the traditional Szechuan spicy stock, all the way (pro-tip: I added the cilantro and chopped garlic provided in the buffet to the stock in abundance, made it even better...unless you one of those weirdos that hates cilantro - teehee, I'd say try it).  °OMG!: Cute little bears and kitty cats to put into your pan! Eek! °Mega bonus: Extremely affordable.  ~Will go again~"}
{"text":"I think this is the best hotpot in the city at the moment, which is why I am giving it 5 stars. If you don't want to wait for a table, arrive early because it's a fairly small spot and all these reviews are making it more popular, I'm sure. The staff was very helpful, from explaining all the soup bases to checking on our broth level and offering more napkins. The concept is similar to other hotpot restaurants: a small appetizer area, a make your own sauce bar, all-you-can-eat section, and then premium items that come at an additional cost. This will be my my \"go-to spot\" for hotpot in the future...and the cute guys working there don't hurt either."}
{"text":"Wow, all I gotta say is WOW. Really tasty hot pot. It's a Sichuan style Hotpot, totally different from the Mongolian one. Love it."}
{"text":"Disappointed  They just want ppl finish eating and leave right away!(not even finish actually)"}
{"text":"Grosse déception ici. Peut-être parce que je n'ai pas le palais assez aiguisé?   Le service était vraiment particulier. Le serveur ne maîtrisait pas du tout l'anglais alors tout était super approximatif. Pas génial pour une première visite dans un resto de hotpot. On nous a installées dans un endroit bizarre, en face de la caisse et à côté des frigos. J'imagine qu'on était surprises parce qu'on n'a pas bronché.  Beaucoup de difficulté à comprendre le fonctionnement de la chose par la suite, la barrière de la langue n'aidant pas.   J'ai adoré le bouillon doré du panda. Celui aux champignons goûtait excessivement le soufre et l'autre dont j'oublie le nom n'était pas beaucoup mieux.   À cuire, nouilles, légumes, énormément de fruits de mer tous très cheap. Les boulettes de pâte de crevette m'ont honnêtement donné un haut le cur. Tout ça coûte trop cher pour la qualité.  Les entrées sont bonnes, au moins, et on peut s'arranger pour manger à sa faim avec les nouilles si on a le bon bouillon, pour les Plus difficiles. L'agneau aussi était bon, mais impossible de connaître sa provenance.   Bref, vous ne m'y reverrez plus. En souhaitant que le Hotpot Panda s'améliore avec le temps, parce que le concept est vraiment génial."}
{"text":"Even though the inside of the restaurant could use a bit of TLC I'd say this is the best tasting hotpot in Montreal. Compared to Little Sheep Hotpot they offer a lot more different types of broth and they even offer a 3 way hotpot which I've never seen anywhere else. Something I didn't like about this restaurant was that I felt that the sauce station could've been a little more sanitary."}
{"text":"Went back recently with fond memories of our previous meal and was sadly disappointed (and somewhat embarrassed having hyped it up). Staff will give you 10% off to leave a 5* google review for them which might help explain their ratings standing. Broths were far less flavorful than previous visit and it made all the difference. Some of their premade appetizers were overcooked while others were undercooked. Bamboo beef was very spicy but not actually flavorful. Service was ok... but really nothing special. Staff had difficulty trying to explain their setup which would have been a struggle for anyone who was going for their first time. The broth is half the meal here because it affects everything you eat. I hope to try again but would probably literally ask for a sip of the broth to try first before deciding to sit down."}
{"text":"Different kinds of meat and vegetables are pretty good, but the spicy soup is not even spicy, I guess it's good for people don't really eat spicy food. Except one thing, since there were too many people there on Friday night, I waited for about 1h 40mins for a seat :("}
{"text":"Im going to give it 4 stars because i see its potential. They just opened so i guess they're still trying to catch their grip.    We got 3 flavor hot pot. Tom yum, spicy and mushroom soup. Flavors were great and the food was fresh. The waiter noticed it was our first time so he explained the menu and how everything worked. Basically u order your soup and meat. All seafood  veggies and appetizers u serve yourself at the food bar.  Great options all kinds of food to choose from. The waiter passes by from time to time and ads more broth as needed. Food was good and service was good.   What i meant about them not catching their grip is that i felt like they didnt have enough utensils and plates to ease the manipulation of the raw vs cooked food. We had a scoop spoon to scoop up our food from the soup pot and was expected to use the same scoop to pick up our raw food.  That left too much room for cross contamination. After asking the waiter how to better handle the raw meat i was putting in my soup...he suggested that i use my chopstick that i was eating with to pick up the raw meat....what? I kindly asked for a second chopstick.  Their also isint enough plates to seperate your cooked food , raw food and throwaways.   But they recently opened so ill give them some more time.   Oh and also they dont have their liquor license ready yet..so no cold beer with your hot pot. Atleast for now"}
{"text":"Food is good. A lot of choices including Chinese appetizers. The space is a little small."}
{"text":"Looking at the positive ratings, I hate to be the one break the party. While the atmosphere and deco are fine, the food itself is definitely subpar in Chengdu standard. We spent additional $10 for two orders of brains (people who live in Sichuan love to eat in hotspot), the portion we got were disappointing... Also it was frozen which you would never get in any authentic hotpot place. When inquired with the staff, he tried to take the bigger one away as I thought I did not want the big one. When you cook it, it became absolutely disaster and disgusting. Moreover, the fish paste (or written as shrimp paste in chinese menu), it has way too much starch in it!!! Enough brains, the store is lack of alcohol offering by only providing one type of beer and one type of wine. The owner also charges extra for flavour, which is also unprecedented. For those who have never had real hotpot, go to toronto or ottawa.  Just to give a last perspective, this place WILL NOT last 3 months in Chengdu given the quality of the food."}
{"text":"Similar choices and prices to the Hot Pot place in ChinaTown. Good selection of meats, and seafood during dinner time. The mushroom (non-spicy) broth is really good, as are the spicy variants. There's no time limit, which is a nice touch after having eaten hot pot in Taiwan. The service is really good and all of the employees are friendly, and the prices seem reasonable for what you get.   Be sure to arrive hungry, and you will enjoy yourself!"}
{"text":"Dinner price 21.99$, plus soup base 4.5$. I like it that even for a small pot you get to choose two soup bases by adding 50 cents.  I had a spicy and a tomato one. I like them both. However, the flavours only came out after a while of boiling.  The meat is too lean for hotpot slices. I like the beef in a bamboo very much which only served in dinner. The meat is marinated very well so flavorful but not spicy.  The dipping sauce offer you many combinations. I recommend one authentic Sichuan sauce which mixes one spoon of sesame oil, one spoon of coriander, half spoon of garlic flakes and half spoon of seafood sauce (thick black one). When you enter, before you can sit down, the waiter will ask you what size of pot you want. Most people may take seconds to decide. I would recommend have individual pot for each one."}
{"text":"Had a really mixed experience at Hotpot Panda. We were here to celebrate the New Year, and it wasn't *super* busy but all the two-person tables were taken. There were about five empty six-person tables.   We get given a number and told to wait.   We wait in total for 45 minutes. 45 MINUTES.   Early on in the wait time, maybe about 15-20 minutes, the guy comes up to us and says a bunch of stuff in Chinese then walks off and when we ask him the next time to repeat what he said in English he says there was a couple before us - I watched them get frustrated with the wait time and leave, so I tell the guy that. He asks if we want to share a table. We say that we'd rather have a separate one. He then disappears. FOR TWENTY MINUTES.   By this time I'm super hungry so when a different guy FINALLY comes over, even though he's clearly trying to ignore us, we ask how long it will be.   (those tables of six are still empty, by the way.)  He asks if we'd share a table and at this point, yeah, fine, whatever. We finally get seated.   A woman comes over and explains the incredibly confusing menu. It takes a while to confirm our choices with her - I get the feeling most of the clients are fluent in Chinese and also hotpot but I'm definitely neither so it took a while to understand the menu for me!  Eventually we get our soup and we pile our plates high.   Except the fish is largely frozen into large ice blocks, the staff keep rudely shooing us out of the way to refill things, half the stuff is missing, and the Diet Coke machine is producing something that is DEFINITELY not Diet Coke. It's a very light beige and it tastes like water. I had three full glasses, and none of them tasted like Diet Coke.   The food was pretty good (except for the chicken wing tips which were kinda gross, but that's personal preference - we also didn't order the beef stomach or the chicken gizzards because we knew we wouldn't want them) and the pricing pretty good for a satisfying all-you-can-eat.   I had the spicy soup and even though I like spice, it was way too much for me. I also had noodles, tofu (which soaked up all the spice and squirted it into the back of my throat), veggies and dumplings.   I would appreciate if the restaurant labelled its food better - I'm allergic to shrimp and I had no idea what contained shrimp. Luckily it's a mild allergy but I have no idea if I ate shrimp.   I really would give this place a 1-star review because of the service and general experience, were it not for a pretty good meal.   Also, weirdly, I started to feel really drunk towards the end of the night? I hope it wasn't the not-Coke. I definitely didn't drink anything but I was definitely tipsy for some reason. Can you get drunk on food?"}
{"text":"One of the hottest new all you can eat hot pot place in town! One of their gimmick is the frozen teddy bear shape soup base.  Food is fresh, it is very important for a hot pot place. They have hand battered fish meat (fish ball), as well as pork meat. They also have a few hot appetizers such as fried dumplings, spring rolls and cold noodles.  Soup based is a bit disappointed, not much flavour. The teddy bear is really a gimmick, it's just ice in a teddy bear shape and melt into your soup.  Overall is good, I like the fact they have a pot for 3 separate soup base, so you can try a little bit of everything."}
{"text":"The bear is very cute and the service is very good.the meat and veggie are all fresh.just the hot pot make me a little bit disappointed.i can only feel spicy and salty,hope they can improve in the future.Also,maybe because it is lunch time so not much choice of meat and veggie.but overall this place is okay."}
{"text":"It was a decent place for enjoying & experiencing the Chinese hot pot. I went lunch and our group had a share of tree soup bases and it became around $24 per each- good price for all you can eat restaurant. Liked the appetizer and dipping sauce bar and the food was fresh.   Generally satisfied!"}
{"text":"This place has the same concept as the hotpot place we already have in Montreal. Really great  area as well. I haven't taste all their broths but I was happy with our choices.  The only thing I didn't like was the pork ribs and how some items/foods was missing from time to time at the food bar.  Otherwise, it's a really nice hangout place to eat at and the services was good."}
