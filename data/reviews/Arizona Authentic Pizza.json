{"text":"Pretty tasty for a $5 pizza.  Always ready in 15mins or less and super friendly over the phone when I call in an order for pick up."}
{"text":"My family and I love pizza and when we see $5 pizza we get skeptical, but omg! I was not expecting this pizza to be so bomb! I don't like little ceasars $5 pizza yuck! This pizza is good if you like Costco pizza or Peter piper. And hey it's $5 a large to pick up just call in for it so you don't have to wait."}
{"text":"Very delicious pizza not too greasy & has plenty of sauce . The wings are okay  . Fast service. Got my order under 20 minutes maybe less on a Friday night."}
{"text":"For 5 bucks it's so good! I can probably eat this pizza everyday. Its just that good! Also very nice workers. I suggest anybody wanting a cheap and very yummy pizza to stop by Arizona Authentic Pizza."}
{"text":"Knowing I had plans for people to come over for dinner, but having also put in extra hours at work, the last thing I wanted to do was cook when I got home so pizza delivery seemed like the best option.  Unfortunately, that option is limited outside of pizza chains when you live in downtown Phoenix, unless you want to spend $20 for a 12-inch pie.  I took a chance on these guys and I can honestly say I found my new pizza joint.  The price was great, they delivered promptly (especially considering it was a Saturday night) and the pizza was damn near perfection.  The only complaint I heard was that there wasn't enough!  Next time (and there will DEFINITELY be a next time) I'm ordering enough to feed my guests AND have leftovers for myself ;-) I highly recommend this place, as they have made me a new loyal customer with their product.  Keep up the good work, guys!"}
{"text":"AZ Authentic always has great pizza at ridiculous prices. It's hard to beat their value. I really love their pineapple and sausage pizza, but they do pepperoni really well too. Not to mention the people are always friendly! Definitely a frequent spot."}
{"text":"Do not order with this company online!  There normal large pepperoni pzza is 4.99 fantastic, online it is 6.99 plus a dough charge then their small pizza is $3.25 in the restaurant but 5.99 plus a dough charge plus a toppng charge comes to 5.99 and it is 6 inches thin crust, plus a $1.65 online fee so we paid $16.70 for what normally is $9.00. Embarrassing as a company."}
{"text":"I went to Arizona Authentic Pizza not expecting much, yet I was impressed by the food.  For the price they get 5 stars the crust was just the perfect amount for the toppings not too thick not too thin.  The 4.99 pepperoni special is the best deal in town.  I drive out of the way to eat here, it is clean the staff is great the place is small yet I enjoy eating there.  They guys there will make any pizza any way you want it yes they bake it when you order it and believe me there is nothing like a hot pizza that does not taste like cardboard like Little Caesars.  Support the little guy and try it I assure you it is great.  Have tried the other pizzas on the menu and also find them quite good."}
{"text":"1st time ordering delivery. Food was mediocre and cold. They also sent 2 people to deliver the food which I've never experience on a delivery before. A girl and guy who looked like they took their time getting here... Do yourself a favor and order from someone else these people give off bad vibes"}
{"text":"I'm only giving these guys a 5 because I can't rate higher. I wasn't feeling well after driving 10+hours and called in for a delivery to my Airbnb. They were short staffed but still went out of their way to accommodate me and deliver when short handed. Then by my mistake I was a bit short in cash (it had been a long day) and they graciously took what I had and gave me the pizza with no complaints and nothing but smiles and kind words. If this isn't customer service at it's finest, I don't know what is. Not to mention their pizza was delicious and perfectly seasoned. Needless to say I will choose their pizza every time."}
{"text":"my roommate and I tore up a large pepperoni, mushroom, and jalape√±o pizza just the two of us. it was about 25 minutes till close and we ordered for pick up, it was bomb as hell. it looks a lil ugly but damn is this place good!"}
{"text":"Just got to try this pizza place and highly recommend it. Good price for a better quality and service in comparison to Little Caesar or Dominos."}
{"text":"I used to work right by this place but rarely stopped in. However, if you're the type to see \"$5 pizza\" and jump right in, you're not going to get much better. It's on par with most chain places and beats the pants off of other bargain basement places like Little Ceasar's or Pizza Patron. Granted, there's a Domino's right up the street that can give you more for a couple more bucks, but this place hits the pizza spot for sure, and does it at a price you can't touch. The breadsticks were surprisingly good, as well."}
{"text":"I discovered this place while driving by to the am-pm gas station next to it,  the sign advertising a large pepperoni pizza for 4.99 grab my attention, so I went in first thing first the place was clean and it seem to work for take out orders only, since it doesn't have much space for a dine-in (Little Caesars style)...  Pizza was really good, different taste than its rival mention above, will recommend  to anyone who likes Little Caesars pizza, skip the big chains and support local small businesses.  -It did take a while to make but i'll definitely stick with this guys when it comes to pizza on the Go!  *Note: You might want to call and order for take-out, will save so much time!!!"}
{"text":"Yum! Pizza that tastes fresh! They also have wings if you're feeling more spicy! Great atmosphere and awesome customer service! They also deliver!"}
{"text":"This review is based on the delivery service! As I haven't actually been to the location. It got here freaky fast,like 30 minutes from the time I ordered. Did I mention it was Friday and this is unheard of,even on a weekday! It was Hot & Fresh! A plethora of cheese and crusted to protection,just as I requested! I am a pizza fanatic and the taste of this pizza is truly unique! I will be ordering here on a regular because of this spectacular experience!"}
{"text":"Im not from around here but i read the reviews so i placed an order told me it would take 30 min after 40 min i called to see the status an they told me rudely that they did not say 30 min that they said an hour well after the hour they called us to notify us that they still havnt started our order so i didnt even get to taste it had to catch my flight to california"}
{"text":"17 bucks for large pepperoni a 2 liter coke and 10 hot wings great deal! Quick and friendly service. *quick update* still think better than little caesars. Skip on the wings they are no good. Still good for the price"}
{"text":"Great pizza and mazing customer service! I'm now one of their loyal customers and every time I carryout or ask for delivery I am greatly satisfied. Their pizza is amazing and so cheap. Everyone try the \"Bacon Ultimate\" it's one of the most unique, great tasting, meat-filled pizzas. The delivery takes around 15-45 minutes which is not bad for a non-chain pizza joint. Also, the staff is so nice and they give me free food or drinks sometime. Amazing, local, and cheap? Sign me up. I hope you guys open another location soon, t's a bit far out of way if you don't live in Downtown Phoenix but so worth it. Great job guys!"}
{"text":"Wow, After reading multiple rave reviews for Ariz Authentic Pizza here on Yelp, we decided to try the meat lovers pizza for $12.00 planning to eat it while watching opening day football. As soon as I carried the pizza to my vehicle and noticed the smell from the box, I immediately knew this pizza was gonna be less than delicious, but I still had hopes, and I was very hungry so took it on home. Once we opened it up and started munching.... OMG!! If you've ever been so hungry you didn't stop to really taste what you're eating until it was too late then you know that sick feeling of a lead bomb in your stomach..UGH, this is the absolute worse pizza I have EVER eaten! I can only imagine the owner must require his employees and family to make up all those positive reviews, because I doubt there is ANYONE on this planet that would not know, without a doubt, that this is horrible pizza. The crust was dry and burnt, barely ANY sauce or cheese, and the meat actually had a rancid smell, like meat that's old and has gone bad! eeewww.!  I would be worried to give this to my dog, seriously."}
{"text":"I have never had any complaints I love the Wings and Pizza! Best tasting and very good prices, can't go wrong!"}
