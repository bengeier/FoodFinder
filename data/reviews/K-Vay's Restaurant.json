{"text":"Amazing buffalo chicken pizza. The service was excellent. Great place to take your whole family. Very kid friendly."}
{"text":"We had a great Sunday lunch there. The stuffed chicken breast and pork chop were delicious. The dinners include a big salad. I Couldn't eat it all. Dining area is pretty basic but comfortable. The waitress was pleasant and the service was fast, almost too fast. We didn't get to eat the salad before the dinner came."}
{"text":"Had the best steak hoagie ever!!! It is real steak so very good.it's not the chipped steak that I have had from other restaurants.love this place!!"}
{"text":"This has been one of my favorite places since I was very young. Lately though, the service has been horrible on the past few occasions. This week, we were seated quickly and it was a very empty - only two other tables were filled. However, we still waited 15 minutes to be acknowledged. We would have moved on to another restaurant, but this was the third we'd stopped at where the wait wasn't over a half hour. We watched two waitresses wipe tables. I don't know why the camaraderie among employees doesn't exist here where one of the others could have gotten our drinks while our waitress was at the other tables.   The food is just as good as it always has been. The pizza is very good - they have some of the best dough and cheese around. They make grilled chicken salads the way Pittsburghers like them - with fries and all. The food is as good as it always has been, and that's the only thing keeping the rating.  I would say your best bet is to order take-out. Then you won't have to deal with it."}
{"text":"great food at reasonable prices. extra friendly service. I highly recommend this restaurant for a casual dinner or a fantastic lunch"}
{"text":"Favorite place for years. No one in the area does more for less. Large portions, fair prices, has that home cooked comfort food in a quiet polite atmosphere you just need from time to time. No one does what this place does. Super clean kitchen too!"}
{"text":"great food and worth the short drive out into the \"country\"   I have eaten here a few times, including a fabulous Mother's day buffet.  We had a large group on Mother's day and everyone in our group was happy with the food selection and service.  I hear they have awesome pizza, but I have not tried it yet.."}
{"text":"Pizza soup is great. Good food."}
{"text":"K-vays sucks. Sunday, waited for over 10 minutes to be seated, even though there were at least 6 open booths and 5 open tables. Then, after being seated, waited another 15 minutes and wasn't waited on. There were 3 servers that just walked right past us. Walked out and went to Rodneys where you get excellent service!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I used to get pizza here all the time and loved it. Not sure what is going on or if I just hit an unlucky day but ordered two mediums pizzas the other night a seafood and a regular with mushrooms and I was completely unimpressed. The taste was meh and both were very salty. The topping amount was comical. $30 for two medium pizzas isn't cheap and I won't be back here for probably anything but ordering catered chicken. Too many other pizza options for mediocrity."}
{"text":"Before I start, I'll say that I hate reviews where the reviewer has an axe to grind because of some perceived slight and colors the entire review accordingly. Well, this isn't that, but it's close.   Went there on a Friday night...not that many cars in the parking lot...thought \"good to go\". Open door, multiple parties waiting...not good to go.   Plenty of open tables so thought it was just a matter of seating people. Waited...and waited...no one being seated.   Turns out, they had two large parties in the back and waitresses were \"too busy\" so, rather than seating people, they have them wait in the lobby.   To me, this is on management. If you know you have two large parties, you staff accordingly. Even if they are a surprise, you should still be staffed well since it's a Friday night. At the worst, you tell people the deal, if they are game, you seat them, give them drinks...rather than make them wait in the lobby.   K-Vays has good food (hence the 2nd star), just not good management."}
{"text":"Stopped here late Saturday afternoon with a party of eleven.  The service was friendly and professional, and the prices very reasonable.  I ordered one of the specials, zucchini parm that was delicious, served on a hot plate with a side of pasta, and a crisp fresh salad.  Home made garlic toast and what appeared to be home made dinner rolls were served in a basket, and refilled when asked.  Everyone else at the table was very happy with their meals, some of us taking home a doggie bag.  My only complaint is that this place is 25 miles away from home.  I will definitely find my way here again."}
{"text":"Great food. Great service. Great prices. Everything you want in a family restaurant The country fried steak is the best I ever had. The grilled chicken salad is enormous and loaded with chicken and fries. All rolls and deserts are home made. The apple dumpling is my all time favorite dessert, add a scoop of ice cream and you will think you are in Heaven!"}
{"text":"I was invited to attend a bridal shower here.  Seeing how I have never heard of this place I was skeptical.  Maybe even a little on edge because of the location.  On what can be called a rural road outside of Irwin area, after all the twists and turns on the windy road you find this quaint restaurant.  I'll be honest I wasn't expecting much from such an establishment, being in the middle of nowhere is usually not a good indication of a great place.  Was I ever wrong.  Walk in and it's spacious, dining room to the left, bar area with a TV for your sports fans, and a banquet room to your right, more than enough room.  The banquet room is adequate with a bar area for drinks in case you are having an event that needs alcoholic beverages served.  Buffet type tables towards the back.  Best for a small wedding or baby/bridal shower to be held in.  I was limited in what I could taste from the menu, seeing how it was a planned even here, but the food was delicious.  Most definitely all made on premise and not from a freezer.  It was a brunch type of affair.  Two types of eggs to choose from, bacon, sausage, french toast, toast, home fries, and assorted pastries.  In other reviews I have done in the past, the Irish in me comes out with my love of potatoes.  These potatoes were amazing.  You could tell they were fresh cut ones, skins still on them, mixed with peppers and a few other spices.    Great place to go for a Sunday dinner, or if you are just out for a lazy drive and happen upon this place.  I may go back myself one time to taste other parts of the menu."}
{"text":"K-Vay's is a very cute & local family style (non-chain) restaurant.  PROS: It's just so d@mn cute! Newer building makes for a more professional feel and a meal eaten with confidence in cleanliness. Good Food Very nice staff Very reasonably priced HOMEMADE PIES EVERY SINGLE DAY!!    :)  CONS: It's a bit difficult to locate if you're not a local.   This is where you go for all of those comfort foods that mom used to make, they do a nice job of helping one fulfill that craving.  K-Vay's is known for their fresh homemade pies; on any given day they have about 10-15 different varieties of pies for dine6-in or carry-out, by the slice or one can purchase an entire pie.  While it is family friendly (very much so), there is also a secluded bar area if you're just looking for a quick sandwich and a beer--where they offer 6-ers to go, too.   There are none of those nifty Survey-style multiple choice questions yet for this restaurant on yelp, but...  PARKING:  Private lot (plentiful) WHEELCHAIR ACCESS:  yes GOOD FOR KIDS:  yes FULL BAR:  yes TAKE OUT:  yes DELIVERY:  no WAITER/WAITRESS:  yes TAKES RESERVATION:  Not sure OUTDOOR SEATING:  no"}
{"text":"My group of 3 was seated immediately, which was nice considering how busy the place was. Since it's Saturday, the pizza soup was one of the specials. I'm glad i ordered it, the soup was excellent. The seafood Stromboli I ordered was very large and filled with mozzarella, baby shrimp and crab meat. Overall, it was a satisfying meal, at a great a price...plus half of the Stromboli to take home."}
{"text":"was there last night!!!!!!!!! good food as usual highly recommend this place it beats sandwitch with cold fries anytime will be back again"}
{"text":"I wanted to update my review of K-Vay's....Since the restaurant has a new owner, I have noticed some improvements: new paint and tv's, and an overall more pleasant looking appearance. (Although, I do think they have a ways to go.) Many of the same staff are here, and the majority of them are friendly and efficient. There are one or two that I do not like to wait on me, because there always seems to be a problem with my order. However, otherwise, I am happy with the updates to K-Vay's. Hope to continue to see improvements!"}
{"text":"This is a great inviting little dinner.  Also, they have a huge area for receptions and other events.  My pap and I came here for lunch, and it was definitely a solid meal.  Both of us got salads, and they were pretty huge.  I got the large, and the only real big difference I saw was the larger bowl.  I don't think I had thaaatttt much more lettuce, but I really cannot complain about the portion because it was packed with turkey.   This was a great find, and I am sure we will be back soon."}
{"text":"For some reason K Vay's has trouble making a good meal and providing good service on Tuesdays.   This is our third bad experience here and all three have been on a Tuesday.   My wife's French Onion Soup was cold and not really cooked thru and her baked fish appeared to be broiled, refrigerated and then microwaved. The fries she had as a side were cold to the touch when served.   My battered fish dinner was absolutely battered and fried earlier in the day and then microwaved as the crust was soft and soggy with zero crunch. My onion rings were over cooked but still managed to be served barely warm to the touch.   The best part of both meals was the garlic toast, which seems to be simple enough for the Tuesday crew to get right.   They removed the charge for my meal from the check so they made the attempt to compensate but  we would gladly pay full price to have a decent meal.   Too bad the older of the two waitresses actually rolled her eyes at our complaints/concerns so that eliminates the credit for removing the charge for one of the meals.   This is not typical of this establishment and when we have come on Friday or Saturday, the wait staff has been excellent and we have never had issues with the food.   Bottom Line - 1 Star on K Vay's on Tuesdays, safe on Friday and Saturday"}
